The Dippers (Cinclidae) are essentially an  Arctic group diffused all over the Palaearctic and the Arctic Regions. It  is singular, however, that this form should reoccur at higher elevations  in the Neotropical Region. A _Cinclus_ is found in the mountains of  Colombia, another in the Andes of Peru, and a third has lately been  discovered in the northern sierras of the Argentine Republic. As regards  Passerine birds, therefore, which great order makes up more than one  half of the Argentine Ornis, we may say that Finches, Tyrants, and  Wood-hewers are remarkable for their abundance, Plant-cutters and  Tapacolas for peculiarity of type, and Dippers as an instance of the  occurrence of an Arctic form in Antarctic latitudes.      +------------------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+    |                        |      I.     |     II.     |     III.    |    |                        |   No. of    |   No. of    |             |    |                        | Neotropical |  Argentine  | Proportion. |    |                        |   Species.  |   Species.  |             |    +------------------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+    |     I.

Although eleven species of this remarkable group have  been met with within our limits, the great mass of the Trochilidae,  which are now known to number some 400 species, belong to the Tropics.  The Swifts are also scantily represented by a single species. The  Caprimulgidae are comparatively more abundant, but slightly below the  average in number of species.    The Argentine Woodpeckers enumerated in the present work are thirteen in  number, but several of those are somewhat doubtful species, and others  only occur in the extreme northern limits of the Republic. On the whole  we may say that the _Pici_ are decidedly deficient in Argentina.    Nine families of the fourth order, Coccyges, are included in the  Neotropical Avifauna, but of these only five are represented in the  Argentine Ornis--the Motmots, Todies, Jacamars, and Barbets being  entirely wanting. The Trogons, Puff-birds, and Toucans are also  essentially Tropical forms, and have but one or two representatives  on the northern outskirts of the Republic; so that the Cuckoos and  Kingfishers are the only two families of Coccyges which play any  material _role_ in the Argentine Ornis.    Of the order of Parrots it will be seen from our Table that 142 species  are known as belonging to the Neotropical Region, and that only ten of  these have been met with within our limits. Of these ten, moreover,  several are either doubtful, or only occur on the northern outskirts of  Argentina, so that Parrots must be held to be deficient in the Argentine  Ornis. As is well known Parrots are mostly inhabitants of the Tropics,  and it is quite an exception to the rule that several of these  warmth-loving birds should extend into the cold latitudes of Patagonia  and Chili. This, however, is paralleled in the Old World by the  existence of Parrots in some of the Antarctic Islands south of New  Zealand.    Of the Birds of Prey of the Argentine Republic, Diurnal and Nocturnal,  it is not necessary to say much; both of these orders are rather in  excess as regards the average number of species, the Accipitres  especially so. The wide open pampas offer a fine field for Kites and  Buzzards and their kind, and they are as numerous in individuals as in  species in such favoured haunts.    In the next order, Steganopodes, the Argentine Ornis seems to be very  deficient. Out of the five families of this group which occur in the  Neotropical Region, one only is yet known to us to be represented in the  Argentine Ornis, and that by a single species. But when the sea-birds of  the Argentine coast-land come to be better known, there is no doubt that  several additions will be made to the list.    The next following order, Herodiones, is of much more importance in  Argentine Ornithology, not less than 19 species of this group being  already known to exist within our limits, out of a total of 44  Neotropical species. And amongst these we can pick out the little  Variegated Bittern (_Ardetta involucris_) and the four species of  Ibises as being highly characteristic members of the Argentine Ornis.    The tenth order, that of Anseres, or Waterfowl, commonly so-called, is  also largely in excess as regards the number of species. Out of a total  of 64 Anseres belonging to the Neotropical Regions, 23 are met with  in the Argentine Republic. Moreover, the greater number of these are  exclusively Antarctic species, restricted to the Patagonian Subregion.  Amongst them we may specially call attention to the Black-necked Swan  (_Cygnus nigricollis_), the Chiloe Wigeon (_Mareca sibilatrix_), and  the Rosy-billed Duck (_Metopiana peposaca_) as highly characteristic  and ornamental species.    Proceeding to the next order, that of the Pigeons (Columbae), we find the  number of Argentine species to be slightly below the average. Several  fine Pigeons and Doves are well-known inhabitants of the Republic, but  the Columbine order is not a prominent one within our limits.    The Gallinaceous birds of the Neotropical Region are about ninety in  number, the greater part of these belonging to the Curassows, Cracidae,  a family specially adapted for habitation in the extensive forests  of the New World. Four species of Cracidae have been met with in the  forest-region of Northern Argentina; but the Gallinaceous group as a  whole must be held to be deficient in this part of South America, the  place in Nature which these birds fill in other regions being occupied  here by the more lowly organized Tinamous, of which we shall speak  further on.    The Geranomorphae of the Argentine Republic are much in excess as regards  the number of species. This arises mainly from the abundant supply of  Rails and Crakes which Nature has provided for the more swampy districts  of the pampas, and to the presence of no less than three distinct  species of Coots (_Fulica_), which appear to be generally abundant  on the lakes and pools. Nor must we forget to mention as of special  interest the two Cariamas which belong to this order, and which are the  only representatives of a family of very peculiar structure. One of the  two Cariamas is, so far as we know, absolutely confined to the Northern  provinces of the Argentine Republic; the second is a bird of the campos  of Southern Brazil, which only just comes within our limits.    The Snipes and Plovers and their allies, constituting the Order  Limicolae, are again in excess in the Argentine Avifauna, not less than  25 out of a known total of 73 Neotropical species having been already  met with within our limits. A large proportion, however, of these birds  are merely winter visitors, and breed only in the far north. On the  other hand, the Slender-billed Plover (_Oreophilus ruficollis_) and the  Winter Plover (_Eudromias modesta_) are species highly characteristic of  the Patagonian subregion, and come to the neighbourhood of Buenos Ayres  from a contrary direction. Another especially characteristic Patagonian  family of this order is the Thinocoridae or Seed-Snipes, of which two  species occur within our limits.    Of the Gaviae, or Gulls and Terns, of the Argentine Republic, nine  species are already known out of a total of 53 Neotropical members of  the group, and additions no doubt will be made to the list when the  coast-birds of La Plata come to be better known.    The seventeenth order of Birds, Pygopodes, is represented in the  Argentine Ornis by five species of Grebes. Two of these are widely  diffused over all America, the remaining three are Antarctic species  belonging to the Patagonian subregion. As only nine species of this  groups are known to occur in the whole Neotropical Region, the Pygopodes  are highly in excess in the Argentine Avifauna.

The  mesa top drains southeast into a pour-off at the head of Bobcat Canyon.  A stand of big sagebrush, _Artemisia tridentata_, grows in the sandy  soil of the drainage, and extends northwest for several hundred yards  from the pour-off. The sagebrush invades the pinyon-juniper forest at  the periphery of the area.    Two traplines were set in the drainage, with trapping stations at  intervals of 25 feet. The lines traversed elevations of 7,000 to 7,100  feet, and were run from June 26 to 29, 1962.    Grasses are the most abundant plants in the ground cover. _Artemisia  dracunculus_ is common in the drainage, and _A. nova_ grows around the  periphery of the drainage. Other species occurring in this stand  include:      _Aster bigelovii_    _Tetradymia canescens_    _Tragopogon pratensis_    _Bromus tectorum_    _Poa fendleriana_    _Sitanion hystrix_    _Stipa comata_    _Lupinus argenteus_    _Calochortus gunnisonii_    _Sphaeralcea coccinea_    _Phlox hoodii_    _Eriogonum umbellatum_    _Peraphyllum ramosissimum_    _Purshia tridentata_    _Penstemon linarioides_    No mice were caught in three nights of trapping (360 trap nights), and  only one mammal, a _Spermophilus variegatus_, was seen.      _North of Long House, Wetherill Mesa_    Pinyon-juniper forest with a dominant ground cover of _Poa fendleriana_  was described by Erdman (1962) as one of the three distinct types of  pinyon-juniper woodland on Wetherill Mesa. Such a woodland occurs  adjacent to the Bobcat Canyon drainage, and is continuous across the  Mesa from above Long House to the area near Step House. Plants in the  ground cover include:      _Cryptantha bakeri_    _Opuntia rhodantha_    _Chrysothamnus depressus_    _Solidago petradoria_    _Koeleria cristata_    _Lupinus argenteus_    _Yucca baccata_    _Phlox hoodii_    _Eriogonum racemosum_    _Eriogonum umbellatum_    _Cordylanthus wrightii_    _Pedicularis centranthera_    _Penstemon linarioides_    _Penstemon strictus_    Two traplines were run from July 9 to 12, 1962, in the area south of the  Bobcat Canyon drainage at an elevation of 7,100 feet. No mice were  caught in three nights of trapping. Four additional lines were  established on July 24, 1962, and were run for three nights, in the area  north of the Bobcat Canyon drainage at elevations of 7,100 to 7,150  feet.    _P. maniculatus_ and _P. truei_ were caught here (Table 1). This  vegetational association may have few rodents because there is a  shortage of places where they can hide. Although _Poa fendleriana_ is  abundant, the lack of shrubs leaves little protective cover for mammals.      _Mug House--Rock Springs_    A juniper-pinyon-mountain mahogany association extends from the area of  Mug House to Rock Springs, on Wetherill Mesa. On that part of the ridge  just above Mug House, the understory is predominantly _Cercocarpos  montanus_ (mountain mahogany), but northward toward Rock Springs the  understory changes to _Fendlera rupicola_, _Amelanchier utahensis_,  _Cercocarpos_, and _Purshia tridentata_. The ground cover is essentially  the same as that in the pinyon-juniper-muttongrass association described  previously.    Four traplines were run from July 31 to August 2, 1962, and from August  13 to 15, 1963. These lines ran northwest-southeast, starting 1,000 feet  southeast of, and ending 3,000 feet northwest of, Mug House. The lines  traversed elevations of 7,225 to 7,325 feet. Individuals of _P.  maniculatus_ and _P. truei_ were caught here (Table 1).    Deer and rabbits inhabit the trapping area. Bobcats have been seen, by  myself and by others, near Rock Springs. Lizards of the genera  _Cnemidophorus_ and _Sceloporus_, as well as gopher snakes were seen in  this area.      _Juniper--Pinyon--Bitterbrush_    Three pairs of traplines were run from August 7-9, 1962, in a  juniper-pinyon-bitterbrush stand on the southern end of Wetherill Mesa,  starting 200 yards southwest of Double House (Fig. 1).    The forest on the southern end of the mesas consists of widely-spaced  trees, which reflect the low amounts of precipitation at these lower  elevations. Juniper trees are more numerous than pinyons, and both  species are stunted in comparison to trees farther north on the mesa.  _Purshia tridentata_ (bitterbrush) is the understory codominant.  _Artemisia nova_ (black sagebrush) is present and grasses are the most  abundant plants in the ground cover. Herbaceous species in the sparse  ground cover include the following:      _Opuntia polyacantha_    _Solidago petradoria_    _Lathyrus pauciflorus_    _Penstemon linarioides_    _Lupinus caudatus_    _Yucca baccata_    _Phlox hoodii_    Only _P. maniculatus_ was caught in this stand; all mice were caught in  the first night of trapping.    Five areas were selected for trapping in the summers of 1963 or 1964, in  order to test hypotheses concerning habitat preferences of each of the  species of _Peromyscus_. Four of these areas appeared to be ideal  habitat for one species, but not for the other. The fifth area was  expected to produce both species of _Peromyscus_. Each of these areas is  discussed below.      _One Mile Southeast of Park's Entrance_    A small stand of _Artemisia tridentata_, occurring one mile southeast of  the entrance to the park, is bordered to the north and northeast by a  grassy meadow, discussed in the following account. Kangaroo rats have  been reported in this general area, and I wanted to determine whether  _P. maniculatus_ and _Dipodomys_ occurred together there. Fifty trap  nights in this sagebrush, on June 20, 1963, yielded only _P.  maniculatus_ (Table 1).      _Meadow, One-Quarter Mile Southeast of Park's Entrance_    A grassy meadow lies just to the east of the highway into the park,  one-quarter of a mile southeast of the park's entrance. On July 30,  1963, one hundred traps were placed in two lines through the meadow, and  were run for one night. Only individuals of _P. maniculatus_ were caught  (Table 1).      _M-2 Weather Station, Chapin Mesa_    The M-2 weather station of the Wetherill Mesa Archeological Project was  on the middle of Chapin Mesa at an elevation of 7,200 feet. This site  was in an old C. C. C. area, about one mile north of the park's U. S.  Weather Bureau station. The vegetation surrounding the M-2 site was a  pinyon-juniper-muttongrass association. It was thought that both species  of _Peromyscus_ would occur in this habitat.    On May 10, 1964, 25 traps were placed in this area and were run for one  night. Only individuals of _P. truei_ were caught (Table 1).      _Grassy Meadow, Southern End Moccasin Mesa_    This large meadow is located eight miles south of the northern rim of  Moccasin Mesa. The meadow lies in a broad, shallow depression that forms  the head of a large drainage (Fig. 1). To the south of the meadow the  drainage deepens, then reaches bedrock as it approaches the pour-off.    On August 23, 1964, one hundred traps were set in pairs in a line  through the middle of the meadow; adjacent pairs were 20 feet from each  other. Only individuals of _P. maniculatus_ were caught (Table 1).    Grasses are dominant in the ground cover, and _Sphaeralcea coccinea_  (globe mallow) is codominant. The abundance of globe mallow is due to  the present and past disturbance of this meadow by a colony of pocket  gophers. Trees are absent in the meadow. Species of plants include the  following:      _Opuntia polyacantha_    _Chenopodium_ sp.    _Artemisia ludoviciana_    _Chrysothamnus nauseosus_    _Koeleria cristata_    _Poa pratensis_    _Lupinus ammophilus_    _Calochortus gunnisonii_    _Erigeron speciosus_    _Gutierrezia sarothrae_    _Tetradymia canescens_    _Tragopogon pratensis_    _Bromus tectorum_    _Sphaeralcea coccinea_    _Eriogonum racemosum_    _Polygonum sawatchense_    _Comandra umbellata_    _Penstemon strictus_      _Bedrock Outcroppings, Southern End Moccasin Mesa_    Two miles south of the preceding site, much of the mesa is a wide  expanse of exposed bedrock, which extends approximately 100 feet inward  from the edges of the mesa. Pinyon-juniper-mixed shrub woodland adjoins  the bedrock.    On August 23, 1964, 25 traps were placed along the bedrock, near the  edge of the forest. Only two mice, both _P. truei_, were caught. (Table  1).          HOME RANGE      In order to learn how extensively mice of different ages travel within  their habitats, whether their home ranges overlap, and how many animals  live within an area, it was necessary to determine home ranges for as  many mice, of each species, as possible (Hayne, 1949; Mohr and Stumpf,  1966; Sanderson, 1966).    In 1961, the"]]]
