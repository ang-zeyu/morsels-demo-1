POLYZOA:--      1. ? _Plumatella emarginata_!$.      2. _Pectinatella burmanica._    The most striking feature of this list is the evidence it affords as to  the distinct character of the fauna of the Malabar Zone, a feature that  is also remarkably clear as regards the Potamonidae, one genus of which  (_Gecarcinucus_) is peculiar, so far as India is concerned, to that  zone. As regards the sponges we may note the occurrence of no less than  three species of the subgenus _Stratospongilla_, which has not been  found elsewhere in India except on one occasion in Mysore, and of a  species of the genus _Corvospongilla_, which is unknown from the rest of  Peninsular India and from the Himalayas. The genus _Pectispongilla_ is  only known from the Malabar Zone. Among the polyzoa the genus  _Fredericella_[D] appears to be confined, so far as the Indian and  Burmese fauna is concerned, to the Malabar Zone, and the same is true as  regards the group of species to which _Plumatella tanganyikae_, an  African form, belongs.         [Footnote D: Mr. S. W. Kemp recently obtained at Mangaldai,       near the Bhutan frontier of Assam, a single specimen of what       may be a species of _Fredericella_.]    A further examination of the list of Malabar species and a consideration  of allied forms shows that the majority of the forms restricted to the  Malabar Zone are either African or else closely allied to African forms.  The genus _Corvospongilla_, except for one Burmese species, is otherwise  peculiar to Tropical Africa; while _Stratospongilla_, although not  confined to Africa, is more prolific in species in that continent than  in any other. _Spongilla (Stratospongilla) bombayensis_ has only been  found in Bombay, the Western Ghats, Mysore, and Natal, and _Plumatella  tanganyikae_ only in the Western Ghats and Central Africa. The genus  _Fredericella_ (which also occurs in Europe, N. America, and Australia)  is apparently of wide distribution in Africa, while _Lophopodella_  (which in India is not confined to the Malabar Zone) is, except for a  Japanese race of the Indian species, restricted outside India, so far as  we know, to East Africa.    A less definite relationship between the sponges and polyzoa of the  Malabar Zone and those of countries to the east of India is suggested by  the following facts:--         (1) The occurrence of the genus _Corvospongilla_ in Burma;         (2) the occurrence of the subgenus _Stratospongilla_ in       Sumatra, China, and the Philippines;         (3) the occurrence of a race of _Lophopodella carteri_ in       Japan;         (4) the occurrence of a species allied to _Plumatella       tanganyikae_ in the Philippines.    It will be noted that in each of these instances the relationship  extends to Africa as well as to the Eastern countries, and is more  marked in the former direction. The species of _Stratospongilla_,  moreover, that occurs in Sumatra (_S. sumatrensis_) also occurs in  Africa, while those that have been found in China and the Philippines  are aberrant forms.    At first sight it might appear that these extra-Indian relationships  might be explained by supposing that gemmules and statoblasts were  brought to the Malabar Coast from Africa by the aerial currents of the  monsoon or by marine currents and carried from India eastwards by the  same agency, this agency being insufficient to transport them to the  interior and the eastern parts of the Peninsula. The work of La  Touche[E] on wind-borne foraminifera in Rajputana is very suggestive in  this direction; but that the peculiar sponge and polyzoon fauna of  Malabar is due to the agency either of wind or of marine currents may be  denied with confidence, for it is a striking fact that most of the  characteristic genera and subgenera of the Zone have resting  reproductive bodies that are either fixed to solid objects or else are  devoid of special apparatus to render them light. The former is the case  as regards all species of _Corvospongilla_ and all Indian and most other  species of _Stratospongilla_, the gemmules of which not only are  unusually heavy but also adhere firmly; while the statoblasts of  _Fredericella_ have no trace of the air-cells that render the free  statoblasts of all other genera of phylactolaematous polyzoa peculiarly  light and therefore peculiarly liable to be transported by wind.         [Footnote E: See Mem. Geol. Surv. Ind. XXXV (1), p. 39       (1902).]    A true geographical or geological explanation must therefore be sought  for the relationship between the sponges and polyzoa of Malabar, of  Africa, and of the Eastern countries--a relationship that is well known  to exist as regards other groups of animals. No more satisfactory  explanation has as yet been put forward than that of a former land  connection between Africa and the Malaysia through Malabar at a period  (probably late Cretaceous) when the Western Ghats were much higher than  they now are[F].         [Footnote F: See Ortmann, \"The Geographical Distribution of       Freshwater Decapods and its bearing upon Ancient Geography,\"       Proc. Amer. Phil. Soc. xli, p. 380, fig. 6 (1902); also       Suess, \"The Face of the Earth\" (English ed.) i, p. 416       (1904).]    There is little to be said as regards the distribution of the sponges,  hydroids, and polyzoa of fresh water in other parts of India. It may be  noted, however, that the species known from the Punjab are all widely  distributed Palaearctic forms, and that the genus _Stolella_ is  apparently confined to the Indo-Gangetic Plain. Two species of sponge  are peculiar to Lower Burma, one of them (_Corvospongilla burmanica_)  representing the geographical alliance already discussed as regards the  Malabar Zone, the other (_Tubella vesparioides_) closely related to a  Malaysian species (_T. vesparium_ from Borneo) and perhaps representing  the northern limit of the Malaysian element well known in the fauna of  Lower Burma. Of the sponges and polyzoa of Ceylon we know as yet too  little to make it profitable to discuss their affinities. All that have  as yet been discovered occur also in Peninsular India; nor do they  afford any evidence of a connection with the Malabar Zone.    The question of the geographical range of the sponges, hydroids, and  polyzoa of brackish water may be considered briefly, for it is of  importance in considering that of those which are confined to fresh  water. Some of these species from brackish water (e. g., _Membranipora  lacroixii_) are identical with others (e. g., _Victorella bengalensis_  and _Bowerbankia caudata_ subsp. _bengalensis_) closely related to  European forms. Others again (e. g., _Loxosomatoides colonialis_ and  _Sagartia schilleriana_) are known as yet from the Ganges delta only. In  our ignorance of the Indian representatives of the groups to which they  belong, it is impossible to assert that their distribution is actually  so restricted as it seems.      SOME SPECIAL LOCALITIES.    In order to avoid constant repetition as regards the conditions that  prevail at the places most frequently mentioned in this volume, a few  details as regards them may be conveniently stated here.    _Lower Bengal._    CALCUTTA is situated on the River Hughli at a point about 90 miles from  the open sea. The water of the river is practically fresh, but is  strongly affected by the tides; it is always turbid and of a brownish  colour. The river, however, is not a good collecting ground for sponges,  coelenterates, and polyzoa, and none of the species described in this  volume have been obtained from it. It is in the Calcutta \"tanks\" that  most of my investigations have been made. These tanks are ponds, mostly  of artificial origin, very numerous, of varying size but never very  large or deep. Most of them contain few solid objects to which sedentary  organisms can fix themselves, and such ponds are of course poor in  sponges and polyzoa. Others, however, support a prolific growth of weeds  such as "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36564"],[0,"The International Monthly, Volume 4, No. 3, October, 1851 (#4)"],[1,", some of which are of considerable merit. In the house of a  priest, who officiates in one of them, I observed a \"Crucifixion,\" without  a frame, apparently quite newly painted, and, on inquiring, I found it was  the work of an artist in Antwerp; that it had been bought by the  glass-makers of the district, or rather obtained in exchange for some part  of a cargo sent to that city, from which they had brought and presented it  to their little chapel; it was valued at Antwerp, against the glass, at  seven hundred florins ($150).    The little chapels in the glass districts are also beautifully decorated  with colored glass, the rich ruby lamps suspended before the altars, with  their ever-burning lamps, the clusters of prisms in the great centre  chandelier, reflecting the ruby lights, and gold, and flowers, from the  altar, are always--independent of any other feeling--subjects worthy the  contemplation of the artist. All the vases for flowers which richly  decorate the country churches are of native manufacture--ruby, emerald,  topaz, chrysophras, turquoise, and crystal chalices, full of the rarest of  those flowers which form so much the delight and pastime of the inhabitants  to cultivate, shed their delicious perfume through their chapels, mingled  with the incense which, renewed daily, at morning and evening service,  fills the buildings with perpetual fragrance. Another great resource for  the arts in this country, which is offered by the Church, is the sculpture  of wood. I have often been surprised and confounded by seeing an exquisite  Virgin, or Crucifixion, or figure of a patron or local saint, in some far  out of the way chapel in the hills, or in some lonely shrine, and even in  the niches on the exterior of these buildings: but on inquiry I found that  these were often the works of the first artists! the foreman of some native  Canova, or Max, whose health, impaired by inhaling the fine dust of the  marble, was not obliged to work on till death put an end to his talent;  but, before the disease had become incurable, forsook _marble_ for _oak_,  and reproduced in that material all the beauties of the original; and under  the fostering wing of the Church recovered his health, and filled his  native village church with works of the highest order. It is the same with  artists, natives of larger towns; I do not speak of such works as are to be  seen in Antwerp, and other cities of note--wonderful productions of rare  art in carving, such as the figures which stand on each side of the  numerous confessionals in the north transept of the glorious cathedral of  the former, nearly as large as life, all emblematical of repentance and  forgiveness, and other attributes of contrition and mercy; with many others  of nearly, if not quite, the same merit, in the various churches with which  this town abounds. These are the works of great masters whose celebrity is  European; but to find in the wild and unknown districts of these mountains  such works of art--to know there is a sure and safe means for the suffering  artist to continue his work and regain his health, while he fills his  country with fine objects of art, carved in wood, and which could never be  obtained in any other way, is a blessed encouragement to talent, and a  field for the arts which can only be appreciated by those who are relieved  by it, or those who are dying for want of its protecting hand. Mr. Steel,  in Edinburgh, the last time I had the happiness of visiting him in his  studio, when he was engaged on that exquisite work the Scott statue, and  which has since been placed within the monument erected to that illustrious  man, told me he had, then, lately lost one or two of his best men from  pulmonary complaint, brought on by inhaling the marble dust; that he had  tried every means to counteract its effects, by providing the men with  veils and masks, but to no purpose. His best man then at work upon this  national masterpiece, was fast failing beneath the effects of the same  cause, and is now probably laid with all his talent in the dust, lost to  his country in the prime of life, when _here_ such a man would soon be  restored to health, while he reproduced his works in wood, and maintained  himself and family in a comfortable and illustrious independence, enriching  his country, and carrying the arts into the remote valleys of his native  home.    Thus far we make use of a letter to the Art Journal. In the Great  Exhibition we perceive that the glass of Bohemia has attracted much  attention, not more for the grace and beauty of its forms than for the  recent improvements which have been made in its colors. The principal agent  for the sale of Bohemian Glass in the United States is Mr. Collamore, of  447 Broadway, in whose extensive establishment may be seen in particular  all the varieties of those vases, and other mantel ornaments, of Bohemian  Glass, which, to a great extent, are taking the place of porcelain fabrics,  of the same description, in the more fashionably furnished houses. One of  these vases we copy here from the Art Journal Catalogue of the Hyde Park  Exhibition; others are of different forms, and of colors equalled in  richness only in other manufactures of the same country.    [Illustration]    Of other industrial pursuits in this class we shall give accounts  hereafter.    FOOTNOTES:    [1] The moulds are made of beech-wood.    [2] These earthen floors are not, as might be supposed from their name,  dirty and untidy; they are made with wet clay, which, when dry, becomes  quite hard, and can be kept as clean as brick or stone.    [3] This excellence in the decoration of glass is, probably, only a branch  of the high proficiency of the art of engraving and carving, in Germany, on  all materials--the metal work of guns, seals engraved on steel and stone,  wood, ivory, up to the copper plates of landscape and history; with regard  to the second, seal engraving on steel, it cannot be surpassed, and  scarcely, if at all, equalled in any other part of Europe. It is wrought  with a delicacy unrivalled, and the impressions are equal to the best  cutting on stone; it is done, too, at a cost wholly unknown in England,  even among the lowest order of seal engravers, for initials on brass for  sealing wine or sauce bottles! It is not only in the depth and sharpness of  the cutting, that they excel, but in the beauty of the drawing of the  various subjects--figures of men, animals, birds, and the lambrequins and  mantlings with which the German heraldry abounds. The cheapness arises, no  doubt, from the great patronage enjoyed by the seal engravers. Every  nobleman has a large office-seal for each of his properties, and some have  a vast number, as, for instance, the Prince Schwartzenberg, who has upwards  of _forty_; the full coat of arms is engraved on the office-seal of each  lordship. Such, of old, was the case with us; and I remember, among others,  a beautiful gold seal, in the possession of the late Gordon of Fyvie, which  had a thin topaz, with the arms of Sealton (the ancient lords of Fyvie)  engraved upon it, with the colors enamelled on the gold beneath.    A comparison, however, between the prices of these works of art, here and  in England, will be more satisfactory and interesting; for an office-seal,  which would cost in the latter country, if cut on brass, from 5_l._ to  7_l._, costs here from 30_s._ to 2_l._ on _steel_! including a beautifully  ornamented base, and polished Bohemian granite, porphyry or agate handle,  three inches in length; and such coats of arms as would cost in England, on  stone, from 10_l._ to 20_l._, can be had here for a third of that sum, and  executed in the best style of the art.    Carving in ivory is equally good, and equally moderate. Pipes, also, of  that beautiful material erroneously called Meerschaum, and of large  dimensions, are carved either with a superb coat of arms or historical  subjects, the prices of which vary according to the size of the pipe and  number of figures, from 30_s._ to 2_l._!    [4] Their name is Lehmann; residence--Schonfeld, near Kreibitz.    [5] The ruins of similar little chapels are found all over the highlands  and isles of Scotland, however remote, with other sacred edifices, in some  of which may still be traced the remains of frescoes. In the ruins of  larger buildings the frescoes are more apparent: thus, in the abbey church  of Pluscardine, near Elgin, the four Evangelists were distinctly visible in  1826, after more than 500 years of ruin and decay.          THE SANDWICH ISLANDS TO-DAY.      [Illustration: VALLEYS AND MOUNTAINS OF WAILUKU, MAUI.]    Whatever may be said of the influence of European and American profligacy  in the Islands, they may be pointed to with perfect satisfaction for  illustrations of the benefits of Christian civilization, and the people of  this country are greatly indebted to the Rev. Henry T. Cheever, whose works  on the subject we have had frequent occasion to praise, for the eminently  judicious and interesting accounts he has given us of society, manners, and  religion, and of industrial resources, and every kind of natural phenomena,  throughout the \"island world,\" especially in the Sandwich Islands, to which  his last work[6] is altogether devoted. Of the important question of the  political destiny of this group Mr. Cheever says:         \"Perhaps it is in the providential plan of the world's great       Ruler, that the Sandwich Islands should yet be adopted into       the Great American Confederacy. Won as they have been from       the lowest barbarism by American missionaries,--having had       expended upon them in the process nearly a million and a       half of dollars from America, and the services of fifty       families now possessing there valuable       homesteads,--harboring a permanent American population,       foremost in energy and influence, now little short of one       thousand, besides a"]]]
