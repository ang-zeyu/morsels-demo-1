When near the present city of Keokuk,  at the mouth of the Des Moines River, on June 25th, they perceived the  first signs of man in all this solitude: foot-prints by the riverside,  and then a beaten path, which, entering a beautiful prairie, impressed  them as leading to some Indian village.    They had journeyed seventeen days without seeing the face of man, and  so, after deliberation, they resolved to visit the village; this  decision doubtless being urged by Marquette, who for years had sought by  prayer \"to obtain of God the grace to be able to visit the nations on  the river Mississippi,\" and who now would allow no danger to deter him.  Joliet was fully aware of the great risk, and took most careful  precautions to ensure the safety of their canoes and people by charging  them strictly to beware of surprise, while he and Marquette ventured to  put themselves at the discretion of an unknown savage people. Cautiously  following the little path in silence across the beautiful prairie and  through the thickets for a distance of two leagues, they suddenly came  in view of an Indian village, picturesquely placed on a river bank, and  overlooked by two others on a neighboring hill; they pressed on with  successful caution and silence, but with much doubt and fear. Having,  as Marquette says, \"recommended ourselves to God with all our hearts,\"  and \"having implored his help, we passed on undiscovered, and came so  near we even heard the Indians talking.\" Stepping into the open, they  halted and announced themselves by a loud cry; at which the Indians  rushed out of their cabins, and recognizing them as French, and seeing a  \"Blackgown\" (the well-known Indian name for a Jesuit), sent four of  their chief warriors forward. Two chiefs, carrying calumets, or  tobacco-pipes, elaborately trimmed with various feathers, advanced very  slowly and in silence, lifting their calumets as if offering them for  the sun to smoke. Marquette, encouraged by their friendly attitude, and  still more on seeing that they wore French cloth, broke the silence; to  which the Indians answered that they were Illinois, who, in token of  peace, presented their pipes to smoke and invited the strangers to their  village.    [Illustration: The Reception of Joliet and Marquette by the Illinois.]    Joliet and Marquette were received at the door of a wigwam, as was usual  for strangers, by an old chief, who stood perfectly naked, with  outstretched hands raised toward the sun, as if to screen himself from  its rays, which nevertheless passed through the open fingers to his  face. As they came near him, he said: \"How beautiful is the sun, O  Frenchmen, when thou comest to visit us. All our town awaits thee, and  thou shalt enter all our cabins in peace.\" After smoking the calumet,  they went by invitation to visit the Great Sachem of all Illinois, at a  near village. With good nature and childish curiosity, a throng of  Indians went along, and says Marquette, \"could not tire looking at us;  they threw themselves on the grass by the wayside; they ran ahead, then  turned and walked back to see us again, all in silence, with marks of  great respect.\" They were received by the Great Sachem and two old  chiefs, all naked and with their calumet turned to the sun. After  smoking the calumet, Marquette, speaking in Algonquin, said that they  marched in peace to visit the nations on the river to the sea; that God  their Creator had pity, and had sent his messenger to make him known as  their Creator, whom they should acknowledge and obey; that Frontenac had  spread peace everywhere; and last asked for all the information they had  of the sea and the nations between them and it.    The Sachem answered in a beautiful speech worthy of the occasion:    \"I thank thee, Blackgown, and thee, Frenchman,\" addressing M. Joliet,  \"for taking so much pains to come and visit us; never has the earth been  so beautiful, nor the sun so bright, as to-day; never has our river been  so calm, nor so free from rocks, which your canoes have removed as they  passed; never has our tobacco had so fine a flavor, nor our corn  appeared so beautiful as we behold it to day. Here is my son, that I  give thee, that thou mayst know my heart. I pray thee to take pity on me  and all my nation. Thou knowest the Great Spirit, who has made us all;  thou speakest to him and hearest his words: ask him to give me life and  health, and come and dwell with us, that we may know him.\"    It is interesting to note the condition of the Illinois when first  visited. Their chiefs wore over the left shoulder a belt, ingeniously  made of the hair of bear and buffalo, which passed around the waist and  ended in a long fringe; arm, knee, and wrist bands of deer or  buffalo-skin, and the rattles of deer hoofs were also worn, and the face  was painted with red ochre. In addition to abundant game, they raised  beans, melons, squashes, and Indian corn. Their dishes were of wood,  their spoons of the bones of buffalo, their knives stone, their arms,  bows and arrows with an occasional gun bought from other tribes.    The word calumet is due to Father Marquette, and his description of this  interesting Indian pipe and its uses among the Indians over two hundred  years ago is best given in his own words:    \"It now remains for me to speak of the calumet, than which there is  nothing among them more mysterious or more esteemed. Men do not pay to  the crowns and sceptres of kings the honor they pay to it. It seems to  be the god of peace and war, the arbiter of life and death. Carry it  about you and show it, and you can march fearlessly amid enemies, who  even in the heat of battle lay down their arms when it is shown. Hence  the Illinois gave me one, to serve as my safeguard amid all the nations  that I had to pass on my voyage. There is a calumet for peace and one  for war, distinguished only by the color of the feathers with which they  are adorned, red being the sign of war. They use them also for settling  disputes, strengthening alliances, and speaking to strangers. It is  made of a polished red stone, like marble, so pierced that one end  serves to hold the tobacco, while the other is fastened on the stem,  which is a stick two feet long, as thick as a common cane, and pierced  in the middle; it is ornamented with the head and neck of different  birds of beautiful plumage; they also add large feathers of red and  green and other colors, with which it is all covered. They esteem it  peculiarly, because they regard it as the calumet, or pipe, of the sun;  and, in fact, they present it to him to smoke when they wish to obtain  calm, or rain, or fair weather.\"    Leaving the Illinois one afternoon, about the end of June, they embarked  in sight of the whole admiring tribe, and, following the river, reached  the mouth of the muddy Missouri. They were the first white men who had  ever gazed on the turbulent waters of this mighty stream. Impressed by  the size and majesty of the Missouri Marquette believed and hoped that  later, by making a prairie portage of twenty or thirty leagues, he could  reach a deep westerly running river that would carry him to the Red Sea  (the Gulf of California).    The Missouri, or Pekitanoui, as Marquette called it, was evidently at  the flood stage, for he says: \"A mass of large trees, entire with  branches, real floating islands, came rushing from the mouth of the  river so impetuously that we could not pass across without exposing  ourselves to great danger. The agitation was so great that the water was  all muddy.\"    Immediately above the site of Alton, Ill., they came in sight of the  famous Piasa pictograph, which was totally destroyed about fifty years  ago. Of it Marquette wrote: \"As we coasted along rocks, frightful for  their height and length, we saw painted thereon two monsters, which  startled us at first, and on which the boldest Indian dare not gaze  long. They have a fearful look, are as large as a calf, have red eyes,  the horns of a deer, the beard of a tiger, and the face of a man, while  around the scale-covered body was a fish's tail twice encircling it. The  two monsters were very well painted in green, red, and black colors, and  so high upon the rocks that they were apparently inaccessible to man.\"    Later they discovered a very rich iron-mine of many veins, one a foot  thick, and large masses of metal combined with pebbles; also purple,  violet, and red clay, which colored the water a blood red. They now  passed the dreaded home of the Manitou, or demon, who devours all who  pass; which proved to be a frightful rapid where large detached rocks  and a narrow channel caused a furious commotion of the waters tumbling  over each other, and a tremendous roaring, which struck terror to the  Indian's heart. Passing this, they reached the mouth of the Ohio, which  Marquette calls \"Ouaboukidou,\" on which there were no less than  thirty-eight villages of the Chaouanons (Shawnees). A little beyond,  Marquette's eye was delighted by the appearance of breaks, wherein the  canes were of an exquisite green, with knots crowned by long,  narrow-pointed leaves. At every landing the keen eyes of the Canadian  explorers searched out everything that was new or that seemed suitable  for food; so we find the persimmon and the chicopin and other fruits and  nuts described in detail.    By this time, in early July, they found themselves suffering from the  double annoyance of mosquitoes and the excessive and insupportable heat  of the sun, from which they sheltered themselves as best they could by  making a kind of cabin with their sails, while their canoes were borne  on by the current.    Finally they perceived on the river-bank Indians armed with guns, who  awaited their approach.

[Illustration]      Mr. Colton is a man of very decided abilities, voluminous and various  in their manifestation, and assiduously cultivated during a long life,  in which he has never failed of the curiosity, ambition, and industry  of a learner. The untiring freshness and hopefulness of his spirit is  shown by his undertaking the study of the French language not more  than three or four years ago, and obtaining such a mastery of it as to  read with delight its most abstruse authors, and to preach in it with  fluency and even with eloquence. It is characteristic of him that he  is always earnest, and that he considers whatever he has to do worthy  of his best abilities, so that in writing of theology, economy,  polity, or manners, he arrays in order for each particular subject all  the forces of his understanding, and makes its discussion their  measure and illustration. He has been in an eminent degree devoted to  literature as a profession, and although he has produced works which  may be deemed unfortunate in design or defective in execution, it must  be admitted that he is entitled to a highly respectable position as a  thinker and as a writer, and that in opinion and in affairs he has  exercised a steady and large influence.    He was born in Long Meadow, Massachusetts, graduated at Yale College  in 1812, studied divinity at Andover, and in 1815 took orders in the  Presbyterian church. For several years he was settled in the village  of Batavia in western New-York, but his voice failing in 1826, he  became a contributor to several of the principal periodicals occupied  with religion and learning, and in the summer of 1831, after an  extended tour through the western states and territories, proceeded to  London, as a correspondent of the New-York Observer.    In England, he led a life of remarkable literary activity. In 1832 he  published a _Manual for Emigrants to America_, which had a large sale  among the middling classes; and _The History and Character of American  Revivals of Religion_, of which there were two or three editions. In  1833, in a volume entitled _The Americans, by an American in London_,  he replied, with an unanswerable display of facts, to the libels on  this country by British travellers and reviewers; and published _The  American Cottager_, a religious narrative. _A Tour of the American  Lakes and among the Indians of the North-West Territory_, in two  volumes, and _Church and State in America_, a vindication of the  religious character of the country and the voluntary principle for the  support of religion, in reply to the Bishop of London, who had  endeavored to show that the United States were going back to paganism  because the church was not here connected with the state.    Returning to New-York, in 1835, he published _Four Years in Great  Britain_, in two volumes, which were soon after reprinted, with some  additions, in a more popular form. In 1836 he gave to the public  anonymously, _Protestant Jesuitism_, a criticism of the constitution,  extreme opinion, and unwise action of many of the benevolent and  religious societies; and having taken orders in the Episcopal church,  _Thoughts on the Religious State of the Country, and Reasons for  preferring Episcopacy_, a work which was much read and the cause of  much critical observation in Great Britain as well as in the United  States.    From that time Mr. Colton has written very little on any subject  intimately connected with religion, but directing his attention to  public affairs, has been as conspicuous in the state as he was  previously in the church. In 1838 he published _Abolition a Sedition_,  and _Abolition and Colonization Contrasted_, in which he contended  with equal earnestness and ability that the entire subject of slavery  is beyond the limits of the proper action of the national government,  and that there is no justification of its discussion, except in the  states where slavery is established, or for the wise and really  philanthropic purpose of promoting African Colonization. In 1839 he  again took up the argument of our social relations with Great Britain,  in a work written in Philadelphia, but published in London, under the  title of _A Voice from America to England, By an American Gentleman_.  The plan was judicious: it was not so much to express opinions as to  state facts which should compel opinions in the adverse audience he  addressed. While mainly defensive, he was at the same time bravely  critical. He contended that in its constitution our government was  republican and not democratic, but that the extraordinary force of  public opinion among us has made it democratic in fact. A large  portion of the work was devoted to the several ecclesiastical polities  existing here, which he treated with singular freedom and originality,  so that the frequent impertinences of ignorant laymen and  obtrusively-meddling women, in the affairs of churches, rendering the  clerical profession humiliating and difficult to a person of manly  character and cultivation, were stated without any hesitation or  attempt at concealment. The entire performance is still attractive for  frequent sound observation upon institutions, judicious criticism of  manners, happy illustration, and good humor, and its opportune  appearance was advantageous to the best fame of the country.    In 1840 he made a more distinct and powerful impression than ever  before, by the publication of _The Crisis of the Country, American  Jacobinism_, and _One Presidential Term_, a series of tracts under the  name of \"Junius,\" which were circulated in all the states by thousands  and hundreds of thousands, and were supposed to have had great  influence in the overthrow of the democratic administration. In 1842  he edited at Washington a paper called _The True Whig_, and in 1843  and 1844 he brought out a second series, embracing ten publications,  still more popular than the first, of the _Junius Tracts_.    In the autumn of the latter year, when the fortunes of the whig party  seemed to be entirely broken, when full half the nation felt a  personal grief for the defeat of a leader, added to the mortification  of political discomfiture, Mr. Colton determined to write the life of  the chief he had followed with unwavering admiration and unfaltering  activity. Casting aside all other cares, so that his every thought  might be given to the work until its completion, he set out for  Kentucky, where he was sure of the friendly assistance of Mr. Clay in  whatever concerned the investigation of facts. In November, 1844, he  reached Lexington, where Mr. Clay laid open to him the stores of his  correspondence, and the documentary history of his career. The work  was finished in the spring of 1846, and published in two large  octavos; and so great was the demand for it, that the first impression  of five thousand copies was sold in six months. It is unquestionably  an able performance, and from the circumstances under which it was  composed and the conclusiveness of some of its arguments it is  probable that it will always be regarded as a valuable portion of the  material for contemporary political history; but, it appears to me  very unequal in execution, and signally unfortunate in design, if  considered either as a biography or a history. For the subjective  rather than the chronological arrangement of the facts in it there is  however this defence, that it rendered the work much more easy of  citation, and therefore more valuable as a magazine for partisan  controversy. The influence it obtained may be illustrated by reference  to a single point: for a quarter of a century the staple of  declamation against Mr. Clay, the opposition which thrice cost him the  presidency, was his supposed bargain with John Quincy Adams; but since  the appearance of Mr. Colton's exposition of this subject any person  in an intelligent society would forfeit the consideration given to a  gentleman who should repeat the charge.    For several years the attention of Mr. Colton had been more and more  attracted to the literature and philosophy of political economy. In  1846 he printed his first work in which it is formally treated, _The  Rights of Labor_, in which he asserted, illustrated, and with  unanswerable logic vindicated the American doctrine of the privileges  and dignity of Industry; and in 1848 he gave to the world his last and  most important work, _Public Economy for the United States_. From the  formation of the first system of society the subjects embraced in this  production have employed the most powerful intellects of all nations.  But though illustrated by the liveliest genius and the profoundest  reflection, they have not until recently assumed even the forms of  science. We cannot tell what formulae of economical truth passed from  existence in the lost books of Aristotle. The father of the  peripatetic philosophy undoubtedly brought to public economics the  severe method which enabled him to construct so much of the  everlasting science of which the history goes back to his times; but  whatever direction he gave to the subject, by the investigation of its  ultimate principles and their phenomena, his successors, and the  writers upon it since the revival of learning, have generally been  guided by empirical laws, which in an especial degree have obtained in  regard to the economy of commerce. Scarcely any of the literature or  reflection upon the subject has gone behind the bold hypotheses of  free trade theorists, which have been as unsubstantial as the"]]]
