The nipple of which the head forms part is  set at the bottom of this hump.    After the metathorax, the shape becomes regular and cylindrical, while  decreasing slightly in girth in the last two or three segments. Close to  the line of separation of the last two rings, I am able to distinguish,  not without difficulty, two very small stigmata, just a little darker  in color. They belong to the last segment. In all, four respiratory  orifices, two in front and two behind, as is the rule among Flies. The  length of the full sized larva is 15 to 20 millimeters and its breadth 5  to 6.    Remarkable in the first place by the protuberance of its thorax and  the smallness of its head, the grub of the Anthrax acquires exceptional  interest by its manner of feeding. Let us begin by observing that,  deprived of all, even the most rudimentary walking apparatus, the animal  is absolutely incapable of shifting its position. If I disturb its rest,  it curves and straightens itself in turns by a series of contractions,  it tosses about violently where it lies, but does not manage to  progress. It fidgets and gets no farther. We shall see later the  magnificent problem raised by this inertness.    For the moment, a most unexpected fact claims all our attention. I refer  to the extreme readiness with which the Anthrax' larva quits and returns  to the Chalicodoma grub on which it is feeding. After witnessing flesh  eating larvae at hundreds and hundreds of meals, I suddenly find myself  confronted with a manner of eating that bears no relation to anything  which I have seen before. I feel myself in a world that baffles my old  experience. Let us recall the table manners of a larva living on prey,  the Ammophila's for instance, when devouring its caterpillar. A hole is  made in the victim's side; and the head and neck of the nursling dive  deep into the wound, to root luxuriously among the entrails. There is  never a withdrawal from the gnawed belly, never a recoil to interrupt  the feast and to take breath awhile. The vivacious animal always goes  forward, chewing, swallowing, digesting, until the caterpillar's skin is  emptied of its contents. Once seated at table, it does not budge as long  as the victuals last. To tease it with a straw is not always enough  to induce it to withdraw its head outside the wound; I have to use  violence. When removed by force and then left to its own devices, the  creature hesitates for a long time, stretches itself and mouths around,  without trying to open a passage through a new wound. It needs the  attacking point that has just been abandoned. If it finds the spot,  it makes its way in and resumes the work of eating; but its future is  jeopardized from this time forward, for the game, now perhaps tackled at  inopportune points, is liable to go bad.    With the Anthrax' grub, there is none of this mangling, none of this  persistent clinging to the entrance wound. I have but to tease it with  the tip of a hair pencil and forthwith it retires; and the lens reveals  no wound at the abandoned spot, no such effusion of blood as there would  be if the skin were perforated. When its sense of security is restored,  the grub once more applies its pimple head to the fostering larva,  at any point, no matter where; and, so long as my curiosity does not  prevent it, keeps itself fixed there, without the least effort, or the  least perceptible movement that could account for the adhesion. If I  repeat the touch with the pencil, I see the same sudden retreat and,  soon after, the same contact just as readily renewed.    This facility for gripping, quitting and regripping, now here, now  there and always without a wound, the part of the victim whence the  nourishment is drawn tells us of itself that the mouth of the Anthrax  is not armed with mandibular fangs capable of digging into the skin and  tearing it. If the flesh were gashed by any such pincers, one or two  attempts would be necessary before they could be released or reapplied;  besides, each point bitten would display a lesion. Well, there is  nothing of the kind: a conscientious examination through the magnifying  glass shows conclusively that the skin is intact; the grub glues  its mouth to its prey or withdraws it with an ease that can only be  explained by a process of simple contact. This being so, the Anthrax  does not chew its food as do the other carnivorous grubs; it does not  eat, it inhales.    This method of taking nourishment implies an exceptional apparatus of  the mouth, into which it behooves us to inquire before continuing. My  most powerful magnifying glass at last discovers, at the center of the  pimple head, a small spot of an amber-russet color; and that is all. For  a more exhaustive examination we will employ the microscope. I cut off  the strange pimple with the scissors, wash it in a drop of water and  place it on the object slide. The mouth now stands revealed as a round  spot which, for hue and for the smallness of its size, may be compared  with the front stigmata. It is a small conical crater, with sides of a  pale yellowish-red and with faint, more or less concentric lines. At the  bottom of this funnel is the opening of the gullet, itself tinted red in  front and promptly spreading into a cone at the back. There is not the  slightest trace of mandibular fangs, of jaws, of mouth parts for seizing  and grinding. Everything is reduced to the bowl shaped opening, with a  delicate lining of horny texture, as is shown by the amber hue and  the concentric streaks. When I look for some term to designate this  digestive entrance, of which so far I know no other example, I can find  only that of a sucker or cupping glass. Its attack is a mere kiss, but  what a perfidious kiss!    We know the machine; now let us see the working. To facilitate  observation, I shifted the newborn Anthrax grub, together with the  Chalicodoma grub, its wet nurse, from the natal cell into a glass tube.  I was thus able, by employing as many tubes as I wanted, to follow from  start to finish, in all its most intimate details, the strange repast  which I am going to describe.    The worm is fixed by its sucker to any convenient part of the nurse,  plump and fat as butter. It is ready to break off its kiss suddenly,  should anything disquiet it, and to resume it as easily when  tranquillity is restored. No Lamb enjoys greater liberty with its  mother's teat. After three or four days of this contact of the nurse and  nursling, the former, at first replete and endowed with the glossy skin  that is a sign of health, begins to assume a withered aspect. Her sides  fall in, her fresh color fades, her skin becomes covered with little  folds and gives evidence of an appreciable shrinking in this breast  which, instead of milk, yields fat and blood. A week is hardly past  before the progress of the exhaustion becomes startlingly rapid. The  nurse is flabby and wrinkled, as though borne down by her own weight,  like a very slack object. If I move her from her place, she flops and  sprawls like a half-filled water bottle over the new supporting plane.  But the Anthrax' kiss goes on emptying her: soon she is but a sort of  shriveled lard bag, decreasing from hour to hour, from which the sucker  draws a few last oily drains. At length, between the twelfth and the  fifteenth day, all that remains of the larva of the mason bee is a white  granule, hardly as large as a pin's head.    This granule is the water bottle drained to the last drop, is the  nurse's breast emptied of all its contents. I soften the meager remnant  in water; then, keeping it still immersed, I blow into it through  an extremely attenuated glass tube. The skin fills out, distends and  resumes the shape of the larva, without there being an outlet anywhere  for the compressed air. It is intact, therefore; it is free of any  perforation, which would be forthwith revealed under the water by an  escape of gas. And so, under the Anthrax' cupping glass, the oily bottle  has been drained by a simple transpiration through the membrane; the  substance of the nurse grub has been transfused into the body of the  nursling by a process akin to that known in physics as endosmosis. What  should we say to a method of being suckled by the mere application of  the mouth to a teatless breast? What we see here may be compared with  that: without any outlet, the milk of the Chalicodoma grub passes into  the stomach of the Anthrax' larva.    Is it really an instance of endosmosis? Might it not rather be  atmospheric pressure that stimulates the flow of nourishing fluids and  distils them into the Anthrax' cup-shaped mouth, working, in order to  create a vacuum, almost like the suckers of the Cuttlefish? All this  is possible, but I shall refrain from deciding, preferring to assign a  large share to the unknown in this extraordinary method of nutrition.  It ought, I think, to provide physiologists with a field of research  in which new views on the hydrodynamics of live fluids might well be  gleaned; and this field trenches upon others that would also yield  rich harvests. The brief span of my days compels me to set the problem  without seeking to solve it.    And the second problem is this: the Chalicodoma grub destined to feed  the Anthrax is without a wound of any kind. The mother of the tiny larva  is a feeble Fly deprived of whatsoever weapon capable of injuring her  offspring's prey. Moreover, she is absolutely powerless to penetrate the  mason bee's fortress, powerless as a fluff of down against a rock. On  this point there is no doubt: the future wet nurse of the Anthrax has  not been paralyzed as are the live provisions collected by the Hunting  Wasps; she has received no bite nor scratch nor contusion of any sort;  she has experienced nothing out of the common: in short, she is in her  normal state. The billeted nursling arrives, we shall presently see how;  he arrives, scarcely visible,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3424"],[0,"For the Term of His Natural Life (#4)"],[1,"men and boys were prisoners of  the Crown, and the cattle-pen was their exercise ground. Their prison  was down the main hatchway, on the 'tween decks, and the barricade,  continued down, made its side walls.    It was the fag end of the two hours' exercise graciously permitted each  afternoon by His Majesty King George the Fourth to prisoners of the  Crown, and the prisoners of the Crown were enjoying themselves. It was  not, perhaps, so pleasant as under the awning on the poop-deck, but  that sacred shade was only for such great men as the captain and his  officers, Surgeon Pine, Lieutenant Maurice Frere, and, most important  personages of all, Captain Vickers and his wife.    That the convict leaning against the bulwarks would like to have been  able to get rid of his enemy the sun for a moment, was probable enough.  His companions, sitting on the combings of the main-hatch, or crouched  in careless fashion on the shady side of the barricade, were laughing  and talking, with blasphemous and obscene merriment hideous to  contemplate; but he, with cap pulled over his brows, and hands thrust  into the pockets of his coarse grey garments, held aloof from their  dismal joviality.    The sun poured his hottest rays on his head unheeded, and though every  cranny and seam in the deck sweltered hot pitch under the fierce heat,  the man stood there, motionless and morose, staring at the sleepy sea.  He had stood thus, in one place or another, ever since the groaning  vessel had escaped from the rollers of the Bay of Biscay, and the  miserable hundred and eighty creatures among whom he was classed had  been freed from their irons, and allowed to sniff fresh air twice a day.    The low-browed, coarse-featured ruffians grouped about the deck cast  many a leer of contempt at the solitary figure, but their remarks were  confined to gestures only. There are degrees in crime, and Rufus Dawes,  the convicted felon, who had but escaped the gallows to toil for all his  life in irons, was a man of mark. He had been tried for the robbery and  murder of Lord Bellasis. The friendless vagabond's lame story of finding  on the Heath a dying man would not have availed him, but for the curious  fact sworn to by the landlord of the Spaniards' Inn, that the murdered  nobleman had shaken his head when asked if the prisoner was his  assassin. The vagabond was acquitted of the murder, but condemned to  death for the robbery, and London, who took some interest in the  trial, considered him fortunate when his sentence was commuted to  transportation for life.    It was customary on board these floating prisons to keep each man's  crime a secret from his fellows, so that if he chose, and the caprice of  his gaolers allowed him, he could lead a new life in his adopted  home, without being taunted with his former misdeeds. But, like other  excellent devices, the expedient was only a nominal one, and few out of  the doomed hundred and eighty were ignorant of the offence which their  companions had committed. The more guilty boasted of their superiority  in vice; the petty criminals swore that their guilt was blacker than it  appeared. Moreover, a deed so bloodthirsty and a respite so unexpected,  had invested the name of Rufus Dawes with a grim distinction, which his  superior mental abilities, no less than his haughty temper and powerful  frame, combined to support. A young man of two-and-twenty owning to no  friends, and existing among them but by the fact of his criminality,  he was respected and admired. The vilest of all the vile horde penned  between decks, if they laughed at his \"fine airs\" behind his back,  cringed and submitted when they met him face to face--for in a convict  ship the greatest villain is the greatest hero, and the only nobility  acknowledged by that hideous commonwealth is that Order of the Halter  which is conferred by the hand of the hangman.    The young man on the poop caught sight of the tall figure leaning  against the bulwarks, and it gave him an excuse to break the monotony of  his employment.    \"Here, you!\" he called with an oath, \"get out of the gangway!\" Rufus  Dawes was not in the gangway--was, in fact, a good two feet from it, but  at the sound of Lieutenant Frere's voice he started, and went obediently  towards the hatchway.    \"Touch your hat, you dog!\" cries Frere, coming to the quarter-railing.  \"Touch your damned hat! Do you hear?\"    Rufus Dawes touched his cap, saluting in half military fashion. \"I'll  make some of you fellows smart, if you don't have a care,\" went on the  angry Frere, half to himself. \"Insolent blackguards!\"    And then the noise of the sentry, on the quarter-deck below him,  grounding arms, turned the current of his thoughts. A thin, tall,  soldier-like man, with a cold blue eye, and prim features, came out of  the cuddy below, handing out a fair-haired, affected, mincing lady,  of middle age. Captain Vickers, of Mr. Frere's regiment, ordered for  service in Van Diemen's Land, was bringing his lady on deck to get an  appetite for dinner.    Mrs. Vickers was forty-two (she owned to thirty-three), and had been  a garrison-belle for eleven weary years before she married prim John  Vickers. The marriage was not a happy one. Vickers found his wife  extravagant, vain, and snappish, and she found him harsh, disenchanted,  and commonplace. A daughter, born two years after their marriage, was  the only link that bound the ill-assorted pair. Vickers idolized little  Sylvia, and when the recommendation of a long sea-voyage for his failing  health induced him to exchange into the --th, he insisted upon bringing  the child with him, despite Mrs. Vickers's reiterated objections on the  score of educational difficulties. \"He could educate her himself, if  need be,\" he said; \"and she should not stay at home.\"    So Mrs. Vickers, after a hard struggle, gave up the point and her dreams  of Bath together, and followed her husband with the best grace she could  muster. When fairly out to sea she seemed reconciled to her fate, and  employed the intervals between scolding her daughter and her maid, in  fascinating the boorish young Lieutenant, Maurice Frere.    Fascination was an integral portion of Julia Vickers's nature;  admiration was all she lived for: and even in a convict ship, with her  husband at her elbow, she must flirt, or perish of mental inanition.  There was no harm in the creature. She was simply a vain, middle-aged  woman, and Frere took her attentions for what they were worth. Moreover,  her good feeling towards him was useful, for reasons which will shortly  appear.    Running down the ladder, cap in hand, he offered her his assistance.    \"Thank you, Mr. Frere. These horrid ladders. I really--he, he--quite  tremble at them. Hot! Yes, dear me, most oppressive. John, the  camp-stool. Pray, Mr. Frere--oh, thank you! Sylvia! Sylvia! John, have  you my smelling salts? Still a calm, I suppose? These dreadful calms!\"    This semi-fashionable slip-slop, within twenty yards of the wild beasts'  den, on the other side of the barricade, sounded strange; but Mr. Frere  thought nothing of it. Familiarity destroys terror, and the incurable  flirt, fluttered her muslins, and played off her second-rate graces,  under the noses of the grinning convicts, with as much complacency as  if she had been in a Chatham ball-room. Indeed, if there had been  nobody else near, it is not unlikely that she would have disdainfully  fascinated the 'tween-decks, and made eyes at the most presentable of  the convicts there.    Vickers, with a bow to Frere, saw his wife up the ladder, and then  turned for his daughter.    She was a delicate-looking child of six years old, with blue eyes and  bright hair. Though indulged by her father, and spoiled by her  mother, the natural sweetness of her disposition saved her from being  disagreeable, and the effects of her education as yet only showed  themselves in a thousand imperious prettinesses, which made her the  darling of the ship. Little Miss Sylvia was privileged to go anywhere  and do anything, and even convictism shut its foul mouth in her  presence. Running to her father's side, the child chattered with all the  volubility of flattered self-esteem. She ran hither and thither, asked  questions, invented answers, laughed, sang, gambolled, peered into the  compass-case, felt in the pockets of the man at the helm, put her tiny  hand into the big palm of the officer of the watch, even ran down to the  quarter-deck and pulled the coat-tails of the sentry on duty.    At last, tired of running about, she took a little striped leather ball  from the bosom of her frock, and calling to her father, threw it up  to him as he stood on the poop. He returned it, and, shouting with  laughter, clapping her hands between each throw, the child kept up the  game.    The convicts--whose slice of fresh air was nearly eaten--turned with  eagerness to watch this new source of amusement. Innocent laughter and  childish prattle were strange to them. Some smiled, and nodded with  interest in the varying fortunes of the game. One young lad could hardly  restrain himself from applauding. It was as though, out of the sultry  heat which brooded over the ship, a cool breeze had suddenly arisen.    In the midst of this mirth, the officer of the watch, glancing round the  fast crimsoning horizon, paused abruptly, and shading his eyes with his  hand, looked out intently to the westward.    Frere, who found Mrs. Vickers's conversation a little tiresome, and  had been glancing from time to time at the companion, as though in  expectation of someone appearing, noticed the action.    \"What is it, Mr. Best?\"    \"I don't know exactly. It looks to me like a cloud of smoke.\" And,  taking the glass, he swept the horizon.    \"Let me see,\" said Frere; and he looked also.    On the extreme horizon, just to the left of the sinking sun, rested, or  seemed to rest, a tiny black cloud. The gold and crimson,"]]]
