Errors of this nature range from 40 to 100 feet.\"    This then is a considerable source of error, but the most serious source  of uncertainty affecting the value of heights is the refraction of the  atmosphere. A ray of light from a peak to an observer's eye does not  travel along a straight line but assumes a curved path concave to the  earth. The ray enters the observer's eye in a direction tangential to  the curve at that point, and this is the direction in which the observer  sees the peak. It makes the peak appear too high. Corrections have  therefore to be applied. But there is no certainty as to what should be  the amount of the correction; and it is now believed that the computers  of the height of Mount Everest applied too great a correction for  refraction and consequently reduced its height too much.    Burrard brings together in the following table the different errors to  which the carefully determined height of Mount Everest is liable:--      ---------------------------------------------------+--------------------                   Source of error.                    |   Magnitude of                                                       |  possible error.    ---------------------------------------------------+--------------------    Variation of snow level from the mean              |  Unknown    Errors of observation                              |  10 feet    Adoption of erroneous height for observing station |  10 feet    Deviation of gravity                               |  60 feet, too small    Atmospheric refraction                             | 150 feet, too small    ---------------------------------------------------+--------------------    The following table shows how the different values of the height of  Mount Everest have been deduced:--                           HEIGHT OF MOUNT EVEREST      ----------------------------------------------------------------------                |              |           |             |  Determination                |              |           | Height as   |    of height     Observing  |   Year of    | Distance  | determined  |  with revised     station.   | observation. | in miles. | by Waugh.   | correction for                |              |           |             |  refraction.    ------------+--------------+-----------+-------------+----------------                |              |           |    Feet     |      Feet     Jirol      |     1849     |    118    |   28,991    |     29,141     Mirzapur   |     1849     |    108    |   29,005    |     29,135     Joafpati   |     1849     |    108    |   29,001    |     29,117     Ladnia     |     1849     |    108    |   28,998    |     29,144     Harpur     |     1849     |    111    |   29,026    |     29,146     Minai      |     1850     |    113    |   28,990    |     29,160     Suberkum   |     1881     |     87    |     --      |     29,141     Suberkum   |     1883     |     87    |     --      |     29,127     Tiger Hill |     1880     |    107    |     --      |     29,140     Sandakphu  |     1883     |     89    |     --      |     29,142     Phallut    |     1902     |     85    |     --      |     29,151     Senchal    |     1902     |    108    |     --      |     29,134    ------------+--------------+-----------+-------------+----------------     Mean       |      --      |     --    |   29,002    |     29,141    ----------------------------------------------------------------------    The height 29,141 is still, Burrard thinks, too small, as it has yet to  be corrected for the deviations of gravity. But though it is a more  reliable result than 29,002, the latter is still to be retained in maps  and publications of the Survey of India.    As to the name, it was called Everest after the distinguished  Surveyor-General of India under whose direction the triangulation had  been carried out, one result of which was the discovery of the mountain.  From the Indian side and Nepal it is not a conspicuous peak on account  of its lying so far back. No native name for it could be discovered and  Sir Andrew Waugh, the successor of Sir George Everest, called it after  his predecessor. From the Tibetan side it is much more conspicuous and,  as General Bruce stated in his lecture to the Royal Geographical Society  in November 1920, and as Colonel Howard-Bury found in 1921, the Tibetans  call it Chomolungma, which Colonel Howard-Bury translated, the \"Goddess  Mother of the Mountains\"--a most appropriate name. But the name Mount  Everest is now so firmly established throughout the world that it would  be impossible to change it. It is therefore now definitely adopted.    Now, this mountain so coveted by mountaineers is unfortunately situated  exactly on the border between two of the most secluded countries in the  world--Nepal and Tibet. To reach it the climbers must pass through one  or other of these countries and the difficulty of getting the necessary  permission is what has so far prevented any attempt being made to attack  Mount Everest. But recently access through Tibet has become more  possible, and it so happens that it is on the Tibetan side that the  summit seems most accessible. From the distant views that could be  obtained of it from Sandakphu beyond Darjeeling and from Kampa Dzong in  Tibet, a ridge running from the summit in a northerly direction seemed  to give good promise of access. Major Ryder and Captain Rawling in 1904,  viewing the mountain from a distance of sixty miles almost due north,  thought the mountain might be approached from that direction. At the  same time the Tibetans were distinctly more favourable to travellers  than they had ever been before. The chances therefore of at least  exploring Mount Everest were much more promising, and Major Rawling was  planning an expedition of exploration when the war broke out and he was  killed.    Mr. Douglas Freshfield would certainly have taken the matter up during  his Presidency of the Royal Geographical Society, but he had the  misfortune to hold that post during the years of the war and no action  was possible. But as soon as the war was over interest in Mount Everest  revived. In March 1919 Captain J. B. L. Noel read a paper to the Royal  Geographical Society describing a reconnaissance he had made in the  direction of the mountain in the year 1913. He showed how attention  during the last few years had been focused more and more upon the  Himalaya and said, \"Now that the Poles have been reached, it is  generally felt that the next and equally important task is the  exploration and mapping of Mount Everest.\" So he urged that the  exploration which had been the ambition of the late General Rawling with  whom he was to have joined should be accomplished in his memory. \"It  cannot be long,\" he continued, \"before the culminating summit of the  world is visited and its ridges, valleys and glaciers are mapped and  photographed.\" And at the conclusion of his lecture he said that \"some  day the political difficulties will be overcome and a fully equipped  expedition must explore and map Mount Everest.\"    It was not clear whether Captain Noel was advocating a definite attempt  to climb the mountain and reach the actual summit, and Mr. Douglas  Freshfield and Dr. Kellas who followed after him referred only to the  approaches to Mount Everest. But Captain J. P. Farrar, the then  President of the Alpine Club, seems to have considered it \"a proposal to  attempt the ascent of Mount Everest,\" and said that the Alpine Club took  the keenest interest in the proposal and was prepared not only to lend  such financial aid as was in its power, but also to recommend two or  three young mountaineers quite capable of dealing with any purely  mountaineering difficulties which were likely to be met with on Mount  Everest.    The hour was late, but I was so struck by the ring of assurance and  determination in the words of the President of the Alpine Club that I  could not help asking the President, Sir Thomas Holdich, to let me say a  few words. I then told how General Bruce had made to me, twenty-six  years ago, the proposal to climb Mount Everest. I said the Royal  Geographical Society was interested in the project and now we had heard  the President of the Alpine Club say that he had young mountaineers  ready to undertake the work. I added, \"It must be done.\" There might be  one or two attempts before we were successful, but the first thing to do  was to get over the trouble with our own Government. If they were  approached properly by Societies like the Royal Geographical Society and  the Alpine Club, and a reasonable scheme were put before them and it  were proved to them that we meant business, then, I said, they would be  reasonable and do what we wanted. This was a big business and must be  done in a big way and I hoped that something really serious would come  of that meeting.[1]      [1] In the enthusiasm of the moment I seem to have displayed a        regrettable excess of \"nationalism\"! According to the record,        I expressed the hope that it would be an Englishman who first        stood on the summit of Mount Everest. I trust my foreign friends        will excuse me! I have this at least to plead in extenuation,        that if I have always striven for my own countrymen when they        led the way, I have never been backward in helping explorers of        other nationalities whom I have met in the Himalaya; and I have        received the thanks of both the French and Italian Governments        for the help I have given to French and Italian explorers.    Sir Thomas Holdich in closing the meeting advocated approaching Mount  Everest through Nepal, and hoped that at some time not very remote we  should hear more about the proposed expedition to Mount Everest.    Only a few days after the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/39465"],[0,"Eleven Years in the Rocky Mountains and Life on the Frontier (#4)"],[1,"at that time to renew his enterprise on the Columbia River,  had Congress been disposed to grant him the necessary protection which  the undertaking required. Failing to secure this, when the United States  sloop of war Ontario sailed away from Astoria, after having taken formal  possession of that place for our Government, the country was left to the  occupancy, (scarcely a joint-occupancy, since there were then no  Americans here,) of the British traders. After the war, and while  negotiations were going on between Great Britain and the United States,  the fort at Astoria had remained in possession of the North-West  Company, as their principal establishment west of the mountains. It had  been considerably enlarged since it had come into their possession, and  was furnished with artillery enough to have frightened into friendship a  much more warlike people than the subjects of old king Comcomly; who, it  will be remembered, was not at first very well disposed towards the  \"King George men,\" having learned to look upon the \"Boston men\" as his  friends in his earliest intercourse with the whites. At this time  Astoria, or _Fort George_, as the British traders called it, contained  sixty-five inmates, twenty-three of whom were whites, and the remainder  Canadian half-breeds and Sandwich Islanders. Besides this number of men,  there were a few women, the native wives of the men, and their  half-breed offspring. The situation of Astoria, however, was not  favorable, being near the sea coast, and not surrounded with good  farming lands such as were required for the furnishing of provisions to  the fort. Therefore, when in 1821 it was destroyed by fire, it was only  in part rebuilt, but a better and more convenient location for the  headquarters of the North-West Company was sought for in the interior.    About this time a quarrel of long standing between the Hudson's Bay and  North-West Companies culminated in a battle between their men in the  Red River country, resulting in a considerable loss of life and  property. This affair drew the attention of the Government at home; the  rights of the rival companies were examined into, the mediation of the  Ministry secured, and a compromise effected, by which the North-West  Company, which had succeeded in dispossessing the Pacific Fur Company  under Mr. Astor, was merged into the Hudson's Bay Company, whose name  and fame are so familiar to all the early settlers of Oregon.    At the same time, Parliament passed an act by which the hands of the  consolidated company were much strengthened, and the peace and security  of all persons greatly insured; but which became subsequently, in the  joint occupancy of the country, a cause of offence to the American  citizens, as we shall see hereafter. This act allowed the commissioning  of Justices of the Peace in all the territories not belonging to the  United States, nor already subject to grants. These justices were to  execute and enforce the laws and decisions of the courts of Upper  Canada; to take evidence, and commit and send to Canada for trial the  guilty; and even in some cases, to hold courts themselves for the trial  of criminal offences and misdemeanors not punishable with death, or of  civil causes in which the amount at issue should not exceed two hundred  pounds.    Thus in 1824, the North-West Company, whose perfidy had occasioned such  loss and mortification to the enterprising New York merchant, became  itself a thing of the past, and a new rule began in the region west of  the Rocky Mountains. The old fort at Astoria having been only so far  rebuilt as to answer the needs of the hour, after due consideration, a  site for head-quarters was selected about one hundred miles from the  sea, near the mouth of the Wallamet River, though opposite to it. Three  considerations went to make up the eligibility of the point selected.  First, it was desirable, even necessary, to settle upon good  agricultural lands, where the Company's provisions could be raised by  the Company's servants. Second, it was important that the spot chosen  should be upon waters navigable for the Company's vessels, or upon  tide-water. Lastly, and not leastly, the Company had an eye to the  boundary question between Great Britain and the United States; and  believing that the end of the controversy would probably be to make the  Columbia River the northern limit of the United States territory, a spot  on the northern bank of that river was considered a good point for their  fort, and possible future city.    The site chosen by the North-West Company in 1821, for their new fort,  combined all these advantages, and the further one of having been  already commenced and named. Fort Vancouver became at once on the  accession of the Hudson's Bay Company, the metropolis of the northwest  coast, the center of the fur trade, and the seat of government for that  immense territory, over which roamed the hunters and trappers in the  employ of that powerful corporation. This post was situated on the edge  of a beautiful sloping plain on the northern bank of the Columbia, about  six miles above the upper mouth of the Wallamet. At this point the  Columbia spreads to a great width, and is divided on the south side into  bayous by long sandy islands, covered with oak, ash, and cotton-wood  trees, making the noble river more attractive still by adding the charm  of curiosity concerning its actual breadth to its natural and ordinary  magnificence. Back of the fort the land rose gently, covered with  forests of fir; and away to the east swelled the foot-hills of the  Cascade range, then the mountains themselves, draped in filmy azure, and  over-topped five thousand feet by the snowy cone of Mt. Hood.    In this lonely situation grew up, with the dispatch which characterized  the acts of the Company, a fort in most respects similar to the original  one at Astoria. It was not, however, thought necessary to make so great  a display of artillery as had served to keep in order the subjects of  Comcomly. A stockade enclosed a space about eight hundred feet long by  five hundred broad, having a bastion at one corner, where were mounted  three guns, while two eighteen pounders and two swivels were planted in  front of the residence of the Governor and chief factors. These  commanded the main entrance to the fort, besides which there were two  other gates in front, and another in the rear. Military precision was  observed in the precautions taken against surprises, as well as in all  the rules of the place. The gates were opened and closed at certain  hours, and were always guarded. No large number of Indians were  permitted within the enclosure at the same time, and every employee at  the fort knew and performed his duty with punctuality.    The buildings within the stockade were the Governor's and chief factors'  residences, stores, offices, work-shops, magazines, warehouses, &c.    Year by year, up to 1835 or '40, improvements continued to go on in and  about the fort, the chief of which was the cultivation of the large farm  and garden outside the enclosure, and the erection of a hospital  building, large barns, servants' houses, and a boat-house, all outside  of the fort; so that at the period when the Columbia River was a romance  and a mystery to the people of the United States, quite a flourishing  and beautiful village adorned its northern shore, and that too erected  and sustained by the enemies of American enterprise on soil commonly  believed to belong to the United States: fair foes the author firmly  believes them to have been in those days, yet foes nevertheless.    The system on which the Hudson's Bay Company conducted its business was  the result of long experience, and was admirable for its method and its  justice also. When a young man entered its service as a clerk, his wages  were small for several years, increasing only as his ability and good  conduct entitled him to advancement. When his salary had reached one  hundred pounds sterling he became eligible to a chief-tradership as a  partner in the concern, from which position he was promoted to the rank  of a chief factor. No important business was ever intrusted to an  inexperienced person, a policy which almost certainly prevented any  serious errors. A regular tariff was established on the Company's goods,  comprising all the articles used in their trade with the Indians; nor  was the quality of their goods ever allowed to deteriorate. A price was  also fixed upon furs according to their market value, and an Indian  knowing this, knew exactly what he could purchase. No bartering was  allowed. When skins were offered for sale at the fort they were handed  to the clerk through a window like a post-office delivery-window, and  their value in the article desired, returned through the same aperture.  All these regulations were of the highest importance to the good order,  safety, and profit of the Company. The confidence of the Indians was  sure to be gained by the constancy and good faith always observed toward  them, and the Company obtained thereby numerous and powerful allies in  nearly all the tribes.    As soon as it was possible to make the change, the Indians were denied  the use of intoxicating drinks, the appetite for which had early been  introduced among them by coasting vessels, and even continued by the  Pacific Fur Company at Astoria. It would have been dangerous to have  suddenly deprived them of the coveted stimulus; therefore the practice  must be discontinued by many wise arts and devices. A public notice was  given that the sale of it would be stopped, and the reasons for this  prohibition explained to the Indians. Still, not to come into direct  conflict with their appetites, a little was sold to the chiefs, now and  then, by the clerks, who affected to be running the greatest risks in  violating the order of the company. The strictest secrecy was enjoined  on the lucky"]]]
