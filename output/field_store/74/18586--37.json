Taylor (1952:856) followed Dunn and Emlen with  reservation and noted some differences. Duellman (1966a:271) showed  that the holotype of _lancasteri_ was a juvenile of a species  subsequently named as _Hyla moraviaensis_ by Taylor (1952:865).    In Central America, _Hyla boulengeri_ can be confused only with _Hyla  foliamorta;_ the latter is restricted to central and eastern Panama  and northern Colombia. The snout of _foliamorta_ is more pointed and  protruding, and the vocal sac is darker than in _boulengeri_; the  groin of _foliamorta_ usually is creamy white, whereas _boulengeri_  usually has a dark spot. The skulls differ in that _boulengeri_ has a  frontoparietal fontanelle, the prevomer is larger and elongate,  anteriorly connected to the premaxillary, and posteriorly separated  from the sphenethmoid by cartilage; _foliamorta_ lacks a fontanelle,  the prevomer is smaller, anteriorly separated from the premaxillary by  cartilage, but connected by a bony suture to the sphenethmoid. The  mating call of _boulengeri_ differs by having shorter notes, twice as  many pulses per second, a higher fundamental frequency, and more  closely approximated major frequencies than does that of _foliamorta_.    _Hyla boulengeri_ need not be compared in detail with the other Central  American members of the _Hyla rubra_ group, because all of them are  smaller and have shorter snouts, smoother skin, and dissimilar color  patterns.    _Distribution._--In Central America _Hyla boulengeri_ inhabits the  forested lowlands in locally humid areas in Guanacaste Province, Costa  Rica, and in the humid Golfo Dulce region of Costa Rica; it occurs on  the Carribbean lowlands from central Nicaragua to South America, where  it ranges to Guyana and Ecuador. The highest elevations where _H.  boulengeri_ has been found are 620 meters at Turrialba, Cartago  Province, and 700 meters at Tilaran, Guanacaste Province, Costa Rica  (Fig. 4).    _Specimens Examined._--Costa Rica: _Alajuela_: 9 km N Ciudad Quesada,  near La Florencia, USC 8059 (4); 18 km N Florencia, USC 2624; Laguna  Monte Alegre, KU 64334; Las Playuelas, 11 km S Los Chiles, USC 7216,  7217 (2), 7219; 3 km NE Muelle del Arenal, USC 2644 (5). _Cartago_:  Turrialba, KU 24741. _Guanacaste_: 7 km N Liberia, USC 8096 (2), 8138  (6); 13.6 km N Liberia, USC 8151, 8171 (2); 20.5 km S Liberia, USC  8205; Taboga, 20 km SE Las Canas, KU 102170, USC 7166; 4 km NE Tilaran,  USC 8023; 6 km NE Tilaran, USC 523 (3), 6262, 7019. _Heredia_: Puerto  Viejo, KU 64323-7 (skeletons), 104351-3 (skeletons), 64330-3,  103592-620; 1 km NE Puerto Viejo, UMMZ 126042; 1 km S Puerto Viejo, KU  84983-4 (skeletons), 86317-22, 87774 (skeleton); 4.2 km W Puerto Viejo,  KU 64329, 64328 (skeleton). _Limon_: Mountain Cow Creek, near Banano,  KU 37031, 41067 (skeleton); 3 km S Rio Tortuguero, AMNH 69057; Suretka,  KU 36482-8, 36699. _Puntarenas_: 4.8 km S Bahia Rincon on NW side Rio  Rincon, USC 705; Parrita, USC 6163; 4.5 km W Rincon de Osa, KU  102177-9, 104295-6 (tadpoles); 6 km SW Rincon de Osa, KU 102171-6; 4.4  km NW Villa Neilly, USC 8003; 10.5 km WNW Villa Neilly, KU 64321. _San  Jose_: 21 km WSW San Isidro el General, KU 34104-6.

NW Miraflores Locks, Canal      Zone, Panama; M. J. Fouquette, Jr. collector].    _Diagnosis._--Size medium (Male to 43 mm., Female to 41 mm.); skull  longer than wide; frontoparietal fontanelle absent; snout acuminate,  projecting; interorbital triangle bordered by white lines; scapular  region having two or more elongate spots; dorsum smooth; vocal sac  dark gray; groin creamy white; traces of web between fingers.    _Description._--Head flattened, longer than wide; snout flat, pointed,  protruding beyond lower lip; loreal region slightly concave; canthus  moderately prominent; eyes smaller than interorbital space; tympanum  distinct, 55 to 75 per cent of diameter of eye, smaller than  internarial space; arms short; fingers having rudimentary webs; median  palmar tubercle tripartite; inner palmar tubercle on base of first  finger flat; subarticular tubercles distinct; discs of fingers smaller  than diameter of tympanum; legs long; tarsal fold lacking; inner  metatarsal tubercle larger than outer; one phalanx free on second,  third, and fifth toes, two and one half phalanges free on fourth toe;  narrow fringe continuing from web to discs of toes; discs of toes  about the size of those on fingers; skin smooth on dorsum and flanks,  that on belly and posterior part of thighs granular; tongue oval,  longer than wide; vocal slits oblique, about one half length of  tongue.    In life, dorsum pale tan to pale reddish brown with irregular reddish  brown markings; small dark spots on head; distinct dark brown  triangular mark between eyes, bordered by thin white lines; apex of  triangle always directed backward; supratympanic fold with black edge;  scapular region having two to five small, elongate black spots; belly  creamy tan with small brown spots; vocal sac uniformly dark brown with  scattered creamy tan flecks; upper jaw dark brown; limbs creamy white  below with scattered brown spots; groin marked with small brown spots  in some specimens; anterior and posterior surfaces of thighs  yellow-orange with three distinct black blotches; two dark bands on  upper surface of shanks; webbing of feet yellowish tan with brown  mottlings (Pl. 1B).    In preservative, dorsum brown or gray with darker markings; interorbital  triangle distinct, bordered by white lines; supratympanic fold with  black edge; two or more small elongate black spots in scapular region;  belly white with numerous brown flecks; edge of upper lip dark brown;  vocal sac dark gray; undersides of limbs creamy white; groin creamy  white with or without brown spots; anterior and posterior surfaces of  thighs having three black blotches separated by creamy white spaces;  shanks having two brown bands; webbing of feet mottled with brown.    _Variation._--Twenty-eight breeding males from the area between Chepo  and Tocumen, Panama, have snout-vent lengths of 39.0 mm. to 46.0 mm.  (mean 42.5 mm.). In these specimens, the ratio of the tibia length  to the snout-vent length is 0.54 to 0.61 (mean, 0.57); the ratio  of the diameter of the tympanum to that of the eye is 0.55 to 0.75  (mean, 0.67). One female has a snout-vent length of 41.0 mm.,  tibia/snout-vent length ratio of 0.57, and tympanum/eye ratio of 0.76.  Two to five (usually three) elongate black spots are present in the  scapular region in different individuals. The flanks in some are  spotted with brown; in others they are creamy white. A small black  spot is present in the groin of some specimens. Usually two to four  blotches are present on the anterior and posterior surfaces of the  thighs; in some specimens the blotches are reduced to small spots. One  or two brown spots are present proximally on the shanks in most  specimens. In some individuals tuberculations are scattered on the  head and in the tympanic and scapular regions, but the dorsum is  smooth in most specimens; the belly is creamy white flecked with  brown.    _Cranial Osteology._--The skull of _Hyla foliamorta_ is flat and  longer than it is wide. The premaxillary is small and bears 13 to 16  teeth (mean for 2 specimens, 14.8). The alary process of the  premaxillary is vertical and concave posteriorly. Ventrally, the  premaxillary is completely separated from the prevomer by cartilage.  The maxillary is slender; each bears 77 to 84 teeth (mean for 2  specimens, 81). The pars facialis of the maxillary is laterally convex  and less than three times the height of the pars dentalis.    The nasal is large and pointed anteriorly and posteriorly in dorsal  view. The length of the nasal comprises about 40 per cent of the total  length of the skull. The nasals are separated anteromedially by the  cartilaginous septum nasi. One protuberance is present on the  midlateral concavity of the nasal. Posteriorly, the nasal overlaps the  sphenethmoid; posterolaterally the nasal articulates with the  palatine. The sphenethmoid is completely ossified and pentagonal in  dorsal view. The frontoparietal is elongate, without a pronounced  anterior supraorbital process. The frontoparientals are sutured  medially throughout their lengths; the frontoparietal fontanelle is  absent.    The bony part of the prooetic is narrowly separated dorsolaterally from  the squamosal by the cartilaginous crista parotica. The squamosal is  large; the anterior arm is pointed. The posterior arm of the squamosal  is broad, rounded terminally, and articulates with the prooetic  medially.    The prevomer is short and separated anteriorly from the premaxillary  and maxillary by cartilage. The posterior margin of the prevomer has a  bony articulation with the sphenethmoid. Each prevomer bears five to  seven teeth. The palatine is small and edentate. The anterior end of  the parasphenoid is narrow (more pointed than in _Hyla boulengeri_).  The pterygoid is slender and well developed (Fig. 5A).      [Illustration: Fig. 5.

I should probably have been much hurt by the fall, as I was not  yet clever enough to tumble on my feet, but that I came down plump upon  the back of a very stout Cat, who was standing a little aside quite  tired out with his exertions. Him I knocked completely over, sending him  flying, to his astonishment, a dozen paces off; the rat, detached from  my nose by the shock, was at once strangled by my brother; and the rest  of the party, running up to me, whom they thought dead, were not a  little surprised to find the daughter of their friend. My father himself  took the matter very quietly; I heard him exclaim, \"I say, Tommy, how  came your sister here? There will be a fine noise at home when your  mother hears of this;\" but I heard no more; I had fainted from loss of  blood, and I did not recover my senses till I found myself in my own  bed, with my mother's mild eyes, full of sorrow, looking down upon me.    Notwithstanding the great cause she had to feel anger at my conduct,  which was in direct opposition to her wishes and even to her commands,  so frequently expressed, I had little cause to fear a scolding while  I was still confined to the house and suffering pain. And even when  I recovered, her remarks upon the folly of my behaviour were made  with such tenderness that, while I could not help admitting their  truth, I felt that I loved my mother the better for her correction.  I promised,--oh! how warmly I promised her, while the smart was still  within my wound, and my face was yet swollen and inflamed, that I would  never more be guilty of an act of disobedience; that I would, from that  time, do only what I was sure must cause her pleasure, and that I would  strive in all things to acquire a good name for gentleness and other  female virtues.    Alas! a Kitten's resolutions, made in the midst of pain and sorrow  caused through not attending to the advice of elders, are too apt to  be forgotten, when the aches are gone and the grief has worn away;  at least, to my shame be it spoken, it was so in my case, for when  I recovered I was more than once guilty of acts of mischief, which,  by good luck only, happened to be less serious in their results than  the event of the rat-hunt.    A circumstance which helped to make me thus doubly naughty and  disobedient, was the falling among bad companions. I had, at that time,  the dangerous fault of easily making acquaintance, no matter whether the  animals were such as I should or should not associate with. Not content  also with simply speaking and being civil to them, I became at once  extremely intimate, and therefore very naturally often found myself in  places and among dangers which I had no right to enter into or incur.    There came into the town, from a distant and wild part of the country,  a family of Cats, consisting of a father and nine daughters. They were  strange, shabby, half-savage looking creatures, and, having lost their  mother at an early age, had unhappily possessed no one who could  restrain or teach them better, so had grown up more like Toms than quiet  female Pussies. I was too young to know this at the time, and no warning  voice had been raised against them; for, fearing I should be denied the  pleasure of going out with my new acquaintance if I confessed to my  mother that I knew them, I never said a word concerning them, but ran  out to meet them on the sly. The elder Cats of the family rather  frightened me, they were so terribly wild; but the three youngest, who  were about my own age, I very much admired. They seemed so good-natured,  so bold, and were so free in their manners, that we became, in a few days,  the firmest friends; and although I was a little shocked at first at the  naughty words they used,--the biggest, I am grieved to say, sometimes  really swore,--yet I even got accustomed to that, and thought, silly  Kitten that I was, that it sounded grand and spirited.    Many and many a time, when my good mother thought that I was visiting  a relation or one of her own steady friends, was I scampering over the  country with these dangerous playmates, until, had I not possessed  so kind yet strict a guide at home, I should have become as bold and  shameless as they. Fortunately for me, I discovered their real character  before they had succeeded in ruining mine; and as the circumstance  caused a final break between us, I will relate it just as it fell out.    At the distance of an easy walk from the city of Caneville was the  residence of a very wealthy bloodhound, who was as proud of his noble  descent as he was of his riches and influence. The grounds attached  to his splendid mansion were very extensive and beautiful, and one  portion, which contained some tall trees and low bushes, was called  the \"preserve,\" because birds of all kinds had their nests among the  branches. In order to guard this property from thieves and intruders,  several fierce dogs paraded about the grounds, and, as they had orders  to kill all animals that were discovered lurking there, you may believe  the place was tolerably quiet. All these particulars I only learned  afterwards, when I had nearly fallen a victim to my folly; but I knew  perfectly well that this ground was private property, and that I had  no business whatsoever to go into it.    My three friends and myself, being out one day upon an excursion, such  as I have described, I, having slipped away from home, as usual, on the  sly, with only a little pinafore for clothing, came upon these beautiful  grounds, and having crossed a park, where we rolled upon the green turf  undisturbed, we at last stood in the \"preserve.\"    [Illustration: AN UNWELCOME VISITOR.]    Here we were at once attracted by the quantities of birds which flew  from branch to branch above our heads, and twittered gaily in the  fancied security of their leafy homes. We looked, and sniffed, and  watched them as they flew, until our mouths watered at the sight. Having  eaten nothing since morning, our appetites were very keen, and the  thought of a little poultry was not by any means a disagreeable one. But  how was it to be procured? My friends, bold as they seemed, had a great  objection to climb one of the trees to hunt for it; and I, although  sufficiently strong and active to mount to the very highest in the  course of a few seconds, had just sufficient sense of propriety left to  feel that it would be wrong. What, however, will not the persuasions of  the wicked sometimes do? Although I knew perfectly well that it was a  great sin, that the birds were not mine, and that I had not only no  right to them, but no right either to be within those grounds, I was, in  a moment of weakness, prevailed on to climb a lofty oak, and seize upon  the contents of a nest we could discover among the branches.    Quick as thought, I sprang upon the gnarled trunk, and mounted to the  upper boughs; in a few seconds, I stood high up in the air, with one  foot resting on a convenient ledge, my fore-paws outstretched upon a  nest, wherein three half-fledged birds were chirping, one of which had  opened its beak at my approach, as though I were its mother, whom it  asked for food.    At another time I should have been touched at the spectacle of these  little helpless creatures, and could have found it in my heart to  place something in their yellow mouths; but now giving heed only to my  voracious appetite and the cries of my friends, who kept calling out to  me to pitch them down, I seized them cruelly by their necks, and cast  them, one by one, below, desiring my companions, as I did so, not to  divide them till I had descended to have my share.    Imagine, however, my astonishment, my anger, at their ingratitude, when,  instead of waiting my coming, each seized a bird as it fell, and began  devouring it with all speed, paying no more attention to my claims or  words than if I had been a stranger, instead of their _friend_ and the  provider of the feast.    Enraged at their baseness, I had commenced my descent, to punish their  perfidy, when the terrible sound of a dog's voice broke upon my ear.  From my leafy hiding-place I peeped, in trembling, below, and saw two  enormous brutes rush from a neighbouring bush, and, with a tremendous  growl, fall upon my ungrateful companions. In an instant one was seized  by the back of the neck, and dragged off, I knew not where; the other  two fled, with shrieks of fear, pursued by the remaining dog, which,  I suppose, had been attracted to the spot, with his companion, by the  cries of the Cats, when telling me to throw them down the birds.    Oh! how my heart beat as I witnessed the scene I have just described,  and thought that I too might have been one of the victims! Even now I  might be unable to escape, but lose my life in attempting to get away.  How bitterly I reproached myself for having been weak enough to choose  such creatures for associates! What advantage had they ever procured me?  Had I learnt from them one single thing of good? I grieved to think, not  one. But what evil had their acquaintance not brought me? I had been not  only guilty of disobedience to my mother,--that tender mother!--but I  had trespassed upon the property of others: I had taken that to which I  had no possible right; I had caused the death of three little creatures;  and I had not even had the consolation of putting the smallest bit of  one of the innocents into my own mouth. All these reflections passed  through my Cat's brain, as I sat shivering on my elevated perch; and  I resolved, as I had so often resolved before, that if I got safely  out of this danger, nothing should induce me to commit such sins, or  trust to such worthless _friends_ again.
