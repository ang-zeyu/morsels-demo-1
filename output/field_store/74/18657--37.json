During these centuries, one notable scholar at least stood forth in  open hostility to the slavish devotion to Aristotle's writings and  with hearty appreciation for the greater scientific accuracy of  \"infidel philosophers among the Arabians, Hebrews and Greeks.\"[51] In  his _Opus Tertium_ (1267), Roger Bacon also pointed out how inaccurate  were the astronomical tables used by the Church, for in 1267,  according to these tables \"Christians will fast the whole week  following the true Easter, and will eat flesh instead of fasting at  Quadragesima for a week--which is absurd,\" and thus Christians are  made foolish in the eyes of the heathen.[52] Even the rustic, he  added, can observe the phases of the moon occurring a week ahead of  the date set by the calendar.[53] Bacon's protests were unheeded,  however, and the Church continued using the old tables which grew  increasingly inaccurate with each year. Pope Sixtus IV sought to  reform the calendar two centuries later with the aid of Regiomontanus,  then the greatest astronomer in Europe (1475);[54] the Lateran Council  appealed to Copernicus for help (1514), but little could be done, as  Copernicus replied, till the sun's and the moon's positions had been  observed far more precisely;[55] and the modern scientific calendar  was not adopted until 1582 under Pope Gregory XIII.    [Footnote 51: Roger Bacon: _Opus Tertium_, 295, 30-31.]    [Footnote 52: Ibid: 289.]    [Footnote 53: Ibid: 282.]    [Footnote 54: Delambre: _Moyen Age_, 365.]    [Footnote 55: Prowe: II, 67-70.]    What was the state of astronomy in the century of Copernicus's birth?  Regiomontanus--to use Johann Mueller's Latin name--his teacher Puerbach,  and the great cardinal Nicolas of Cues were the leading astronomers of  this fifteenth century. Puerbach[56] (1432-1462) died before he had  fulfilled the promise of his youth, leaving his _Epitome of Ptolemy's  Almagest_ to be completed by his greater pupil. In his _Theorica  Planetarum_ (1460) Puerbach sought to explain the motions of the  planets by placing each planet between the walls of two curved  surfaces with just sufficient space in which the planet could move. As  M. Delambre remarked:[57] \"These walls might aid the understanding,  but one must suppose them transparent; and even if they guided the  planet as was their purpose, they hindered the movement of the comets.  Therefore they had to be abandoned, and in our own modern physics they  are absolutely superfluous; they have even been rather harmful, since  they interfered with the slight irregularities caused by the force of  attraction in planetary movements which observations have disclosed.\"  This scheme gives some indication of the elaborate devices scholars  evolved in order to cope with the increasing number of seeming  irregularities observed in \"the heavens,\" and perhaps it makes clearer  why Copernicus was so dissatisfied with the astronomical hypothesis of  his day, and longed for some simpler, more harmonious explanation.    [Footnote 56: Delambre: _Moyen Age_, 262-272.]    [Footnote 57: Delambre: _Moyen Age_, 272.]    Regiomontanus[58] (1436-1476) after Puerbach's death, continued his  work, and his astronomical tables (pub. 1475) were in general use  throughout Europe till superseded by the vastly more accurate  Copernican Tables a century later. It has been said[59] that his fame  inspired Copernicus (born three years before the other's death in  1476) to become as great an astronomer. M. Delambre hails him as the  wisest astronomer Europe had yet produced[60] and certainly his renown  was approached only by that of the great Cardinal.    [Footnote 58: It has been claimed that Regiomontanus knew of the  earth's motion around the sun a hundred years before Copernicus; but a  German writer has definitely disproved this claim by tracing it to its  source in Schoener's _Opusculum Geographicum_ (1553) which states only  that he believed in the earth's axial rotation. Ziegler: 62.]    [Footnote 59: Ibid: 62.]    [Footnote 60: Delambre: _Op. cit._: 365.]    Both Janssen,[61] the Catholic historian, and Father Hagen[62] of the  Vatican Observatory, together with many other Catholic writers, claim  that a hundred years before Copernicus, Cardinal Nicolas Cusanus[63]  (c. 1400-1464) had the courage and independence to uphold the theory  of the earth's motion and its rotation on its axis. As Father Hagen  remarked: \"Had Copernicus been aware of these assertions he would  probably have been encouraged by them to publish his own monumental  work.\" But the Cardinal stated these views of the earth's motions in a  mystical, hypothetical way which seems to justify the marginal heading  \"Paradox\" (in the edition of 1565).[64] And unfortunately for these  writers, the Jesuit father, Riccioli, the official spokesman of that  order in the 17th century after Galileo's condemnation, speaking of  this paradox, called attention, also, to a passage in one of the  Cardinal's sermons as indicating that the latter had perhaps  \"forgotten himself\" in the _De Docta Ignorantia_, or that this paradox  \"was repugnant to him, or that he had thought better of it.\"[65] The  passage he referred to is as follows: \"Prayer is more powerful than  all created things. Although angels, or some kind of beings, move the  spheres, the Sun and the stars; prayer is more powerful than they are,  since it impedes motion, as when the prayer of Joshua made the Sun  stand still.\"[66] This may explain why Copernicus apparently  disregarded the Cardinal's paradox, for he made no reference to it in  his book; and the statement itself, to judge by the absence of  contemporary comment, aroused no interest at the time. But of late  years, the Cardinal's position as stated in the _De Docta Ignorantia_  has been repeatedly cited as an instance of the Church's friendly  attitude toward scientific thought,[67] to show that Galileo's  condemnation was due chiefly to his \"contumacy and disobedience.\"    [Footnote 61: Janssen: _Hist. of Ger._, I, 5.]    [Footnote 62: _Cath. Ency._: \"Cusanus.\"]    [Footnote 63: From Cues near Treves.]    [Footnote 64: Cusanus: _De Docta Ignorantia_, Bk. II, c. 11-12:  \"Centrum igitur mundi, coincideret cum circumferentiam, nam si centrum  haberet et circumferentiam, et sic intra se haberet suum initium et  finem et esset ad aliquid aliud ipse mundus terminatus, et extra  mundum esset aluid et locus, quae omnia veritate carent.

Terrae  igitur figura est mobilis et sphaerica et eius motus circularis, sed  perfectior esse posset. Et quia maximum in perfectionibus motibus, et  figuris in mundo non est, ut ex iam dictis patent: tunc non est verum  quod terra ista sit vilissima et infima, nam quamvis videatur  centralior, quo'ad mundum, est tamen etiam, eadem ratione polo  propinquior, ut est dictum.\" (pp. 38-39).]    [Footnote 65: Riccioli: _Alm.

(_Allgemeine Deutsche  Biographie._) The manuscript authority Dr. Prowe cites (Prowe: I,  19-27 and footnotes), requires the double p in Copernicus's name, as  Copernicus himself invariably used the two p's in the Latinized form  _Coppernic_ without the termination _us_, and usually when this  termination was added. Also official records and the letters from his  friends usually give the double p; though the name is found in many  variants--Koppernig, Copperinck, etc. His signatures in his books, his  name in the letter he published in 1509, and the Latin form of it used  by his friends all bear testimony to his use of the double p. But  custom has for so many centuries sanctioned the simpler spelling, that  it seems unwise not to conform in this instance to the time-honored  usage.]    [Footnote 69: Prowe: I, 85.]    [Footnote 70: _Ency.

The victim at the same time of a fall, and of a  nocturnal shower-bath, Carrat cried out against his double misfortune.  \"This is horrible,\" he yelled at the top of his voice; while Hortense  maliciously said aloud to her mother, Madame de Crigny (afterwards Madame  Denon), Madame Charvet, and to several others in the room, \"Oh, Mamma,  those toads and frogs in the water will get on him.\" These words, joined  to the utter darkness, served only to increase the terror of Carrat, who,  becoming seriously frightened, cried out, \"It is horrible, Madame, it is  horrible, to amuse yourself thus at the expense of your servants.\"    I do not say that the complaints of Carrat were entirely wrong, but they.  served only to increase the gayety of the ladies who had taken him for  the object of their pleasantries.    However that may be, such was the character and position of Carrat, whom  I had known for some time, when General Bonaparte returned from his  expedition into Egypt, and Carrat said to me that Eugene de Beauharnais  had applied to him for a confidential valet, his own having been detained  in Cairo by severe illness at the time of his departure. He was named  Lefebvre, and was an old servant entirely devoted to his master, as was  every one who knew Prince Eugene; for I do not believe that there has  ever lived a better man, or one more polite, more considerate, or indeed  more attentive, to those who served him.    Carrat having told me that Eugene de Beauharnais       [Born 1781, viceroy of Italy 1805. In 1806 married the daughter     of the King of Bavaria. Died 1824. Among his descendants are the     present King of Sweden and the late Emperor of Brazil.--TRANS.]    desired a young man to replace Lefebvre, and having recommended me for  the place, I had the good fortune to be presented to Eugene, and to give  satisfaction; indeed, he was so kind as to say to me that my appearance  pleased him, and he wished me to enter upon my duties immediately. I was  delighted with this situation, which, I know not why, painted itself to  my imagination in the brightest colors, and without loss of time, went to  find my modest baggage, and behold me valet de chambre, ad interim, of M.  de Beauharnais, not dreaming that I should one day be admitted to the  personal service of General Bonaparte, and still less that I should  become the chief valet of an Emperor.          CHAPTER II.    It was on Oct. 16, 1799, that Eugene de Beauharnais arrived in Paris on  his return from Egypt; and almost immediately thereafter I had the good  fortune to be taken into his service, M. Eugene being then twenty-one  years of age. I soon after learned a few particulars, which I think are  little known, relative to his former life, and the marriage of his mother  with General Bonaparte.    His father, as is well known, was one of the victims of the Revolution;  and when the Marquis de Beauharnais had perished on the scaffold, his  widow, whose property had been confiscated, fearing that her son,  although still very young, might also be in danger on account of his  belonging to the nobility, placed him in the home of a carpenter on the  rue de l'Echelle where, a lady of my acquaintance, who lived on that  street, has often seen him passing, carrying a plank on his shoulder. It  seems a long distance from this position to the colonelcy of a regiment  of the Consular guards, and the vice-royalty of Italy.    I learned, from hearing Eugene himself relate it, by what a singular  circumstance he had been the cause of the first meeting between his  mother and his step-father. Eugene, being then not more than fourteen or  fifteen years of age, having been informed that General Bonaparte had  become possessor of the sword of the Marquis de Beauharnais, took a step  which seemed hazardous, but was crowned with success. The general having  received him graciously, Eugene explained that he came to beg of him the  restoration of his father's sword. His face, his bearing, his frank  request, all made such a pleasant impression on Bonaparte, that he  immediately presented him with the sword which he requested. As soon as  this sword was in his hands he covered it with kisses and tears; and the  whole was done in so artless a manner, that Bonaparte was delighted with  him.    Madame de Beauharnais, being informed of the welcome the general had  given her son, thought it her duty to make him a visit of gratitude.  Bonaparte, being much pleased with Josephine in this first interview,  returned her visit. They met again frequently; and as is well known, one  event led to another, until she became the first Empress of the French;  and I can assert from the numerous proofs that I have had of this fact,  that Bonaparte never ceased to love Eugene as well as if he, had been his  own son.    The qualities of Eugene were both attractive and solid. His features  were not regular, and yet his countenance prepossessed every one in his  favor. He had a well-proportioned figure, but did not make a  distinguished appearance, on account of the habit he had of swinging  himself as he walked. He was about five feet three or four inches  [About five feet six or seven inches in English measurement.--TRANS.]  in height. He was kind, gay, amiable, full of wit, intelligent,  generous; and it might well be said that his frank and open countenance  was the mirror of his soul. How many services he has rendered others  during the course of his life, and at the very period when in order to do  so he had often to impose privations on himself.    It will soon be seen how it happened that I passed only a month with  Eugene; but during this short space of time, I recall that, while  fulfilling scrupulously his duties to his mother and his step-father, he  was much addicted to the pleasures so natural to his age and position.  One of his greatest pleasures was entertaining his friends at breakfast;  which he did very often. This amused me much on account of the comical  scenes of which I was often a witness. Besides the young officers of  Bonaparte's staff, his most frequent guests, he had also frequently at  his table the ventriloquist Thiemet, Dugazon, Dazincourt, and Michau of  the Theatre Francais, and a few other persons, whose names escape me at  this moment. As may be imagined, these reunions were extremely gay;  these young officers especially, who had returned like Eugene from the  expedition to Egypt, seemed trying to indemnify themselves for the recent  privations they had had to suffer. At this time ventriloquists, among  whom Thiemet held a very distinguished position, were the fashion in  Paris, and were invited to private gatherings. I remember on one  occasion, at one of these breakfasts of Eugene's, Thiemet called by their  names several persons present, imitating the voices of their servants, as  if they were just outside the door, while he remained quietly in his  seat, appearing to be using his lips only to eat and drink, two duties'  which he performed admirably. Each of the officers called in this manner  went out, and found no one; and then Thiemet went out with them, under  the pretext of assisting them in the search, and increased their  perplexity by continuing to make them hear some well-known voice. Most  of them laughed heartily at the joke of which they had just been the  victims; but there was one who, having himself less under control than  his comrades, took the thing seriously, and became very angry, whereupon  Eugene had to avow that he was the author of the conspiracy.    I recall still another amusing scene, the two heroes of which were this  same Thiemet, of whom I have just spoken, and Dugazon. Several  foreigners were present at a breakfast given by Eugene, the parts having  been assigned, and learned in advance, and the two victims selected.  When each had taken his place at table, Dugazon, pretending to stammer,  addressed a remark to Thiemet, who, playing the same role, replied to  him, stammering likewise; then each of them pretended to believe that the  other was making fun of him, and there followed a stuttering quarrel  between the two parties, each one finding it more and more difficult to  express himself as his anger rose. Thiemet, who besides his role of  stammering was also playing that of deafness, addressed his neighbor, his  trumpet in his ear:    \"Wha-wha-what-do-does he say?\"--\"Nothing,\" replied the officious  neighbor, wishing to prevent a quarrel, and to supply facts while  defending the other stammerer.--\"So-so-he-he-he-he's mamaking fun of me!\"  Then the quarrel became more violent still; they were about to come to  blows, when each of the two stammerers seizing a carafe of water, hurled  it at the head of his antagonist, and a copious deluge of water from the  bottles taught the officious neighbors the great danger of acting as  peacemakers. The two stammerers continued to scream as is the custom of  deaf persons, until the last drop of water was spilt; and I remember that  Eugene, the originator of this practical joke, laughed immoderately the  whole time this scene lasted. The water was wiped off; and all were soon  reconciled, glass in hand. Eugene, when he had perpetrated a joke of  this sort, never failed to relate it to his mother, and sometimes to his  stepfather, who were much amused thereby, Josephine especially.    I had led for one month a very pleasant life with Eugene, when Lefebvre,  the valet de chambre whom he had left sick at Cairo, returned in restored  health, and asked to resume his place. Eugene, whom I suited better on  account of my age and activity, proposed to him to enter his mother's  service, suggesting to him that he would there have an easier time than  with "]]]
