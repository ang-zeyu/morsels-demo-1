It seems that the vertebrae in Urodela have at least the following  components: perichordal centra, separate basidorsal cartilages, and  basiventrals, which are somewhat specialized in their manner of  development. The vertebrae of Anura develop in the fashion just  described except that basiventrals are lacking. It would seem no more  difficult to accept the derivation of salamander vertebrae from the  temnospondylous type than it is in the case of frogs, if other evidence  points to such an ancestry.    [Illustration: Fig. 7. Vertebrae of _Eusthenopteron_ (x1) and  _Ichthyostega_ (x2/3, after Jarvik, 1952), _Trimerorhachis_ (x1-1/2,  after Case), and _Amphibamus_ (x10, after Watson, 1940) in lateral and  end views; the two lower right-hand figures are from Watson (1940, as  _Miobatrachus_); the lower left is from a cast of the \"_Miobatrachus_\"  specimen in Chicago Natural History Museum, No. 2000, in the presacral  region (original, x10).]    Fig. 7, lower right, is Watson's (1940) illustration of the anterior  trunk vertebrae of _Amphibamus_ (_Miobatrachus_), in which the  intercentrum is shown as a single median piece. Fig. 7, lower left,  shows two of the more posterior trunk vertebrae seen as impressions in a  cast of the type of \"_Miobatrachus romeri_;\" evidently the inter-centra  were paired at about the level of the 16th vertebra, and relatively  large. Gregory's (1950) figure of the type specimen of \"_Mazonerpeton_\"  (also equivalent to _Amphibamus_) shows the anterior trunk vertebrae in  relation to the ribs essentially as they appear to me in the cast of  _Miobatrachus_, and rather differently from Watson's figure of the  latter. Gregory is probably right in considering the specimens to  represent various degrees of immaturity. So far as present information  goes, then, the vertebrae of salamanders and frogs show no _clear_  evidence of derivation from those of any particular group among the  early Amphibia, but their features are not inconsistent with a  simplification of the pattern of Temnospondyli.    [Illustration: Fig. 8. Pectoral girdles of _Protobatrachus_ (after  Piveteau, 1937), _Notobatrachus_ (after Stipanicic and Reig, 1956),  Ascaphus (after Ritland, 1955 a) and _Rana_ (original); all x2. For  explanation of abbreviations see Fig. 3.]          PECTORAL GIRDLE      Hecht and Ruibal (Copeia, 1928:242) make a strong point of the nature of  the pectoral girdle in _Notobatrachus_, as described recently by  Stipanicic and Reig (1955, 1956) from the Jurassic of Patagonia, and  quite rightly recommend that the significance of the arciferal and  firmisternal types of girdle be restudied. That of _Notobatrachus_ is  said to be firmisternal; in view of the arciferal condition in the  supposedly primitive _Leiopelma_, _Ascaphus_, _Bombinator_, etc., this  comes as a surprise. Is the firmisternal girdle, as seen in _Rana_,  _Bufo_, and others, actually the ancestral type, and has the arciferal  been derived from something like this?    In the figures given by Stipanicic and Reig the ossified parts of the  girdle are figured in detail (Fig. 8) and Reig's discussion of it is  thorough. The decision to call it firmisternal was taken with some  hesitancy, for no median elements are indicated, and the position and  shape of those seen is closely similar to the ossified parts in  _Ascaphus_ and _Leiopelma_; there is no bony sternum or omosternum. It  is safe to suppose that some cartilage lay in the midline between the  clavicles and coracoids, but there is no evidence as to its extent,  rigidity, or degree of overlapping if any. Apparently, then, there is  not sufficient reason to infer that this Jurassic frog had a pectoral  girdle comparable with the modern firmisternal type.    Piveteau (1955:261) remarks that the only living Anuran that can be  compared usefully with _Protobatrachus_ (Triassic) with regard to its  pectoral girdle is _Ascaphus_. Again, the extent of cartilage in  _Protobatrachus_ (Fig. 8) can only be inferred, and there are no median  elements. The agreement with _Ascaphus_ includes the presence, in both,  of a separate coracoid ossification situated posterior to the ossified  \"scapulocoracoid\" (actually scapula). This ossification is evidently  that shown in _Notobatrachus_ as \"coracoid.\" Direct comparison of the  three genera with one another suggests that if we use the term arciferal  for any, we should use it for all.    In the remote predecessor of Anura, _Amphibamus_ of the Pennsylvanian,  the pectoral girdle was less substantial than in many of its  contemporaries, but it contained the primitive median interclavicle in  addition to the clavicle, cleithrum, and scapulocoracoid. (The figure of  Watson, 1940, and that by Gregory, 1950, are of individuals of different  ages, the latter being older.) It is clear that the paired elements of  such a girdle were held rigid by their attachment to the interclavicle,  _via_ the clavicles. Subsequent elimination of the interclavicle in the  Anuran line of descent, and decrease of ossification, left a girdle like  that of _Protobatrachus_, _Notobatrachus_, _Ascaphus_ and _Leiopelma_.  But in several advanced families a more rigid median \"sternum,\" of one  or two bony pieces plus cartilage, is developed secondarily, possibly  (as Cope, 1889: 247, suggested) in correlation with axillary amplexus.    Among Urodela no dermal bones occur in the pectoral girdle. There is  usually a scapulocoracoid ossified as a single piece, from which a thin  cartilaginous suprascapula extends dorsally and a broad cartilaginous  coracoid plate extends medially, overlapping the one from the opposite  side; a precoracoid lobe of this reaches forward on either side, and a  median, posterior \"sternum\" of cartilage may make contact with the  edges of the two coracoids. In _Siren_ and _Amphiuma_ two centers of  ossification are found for each scapulocoracoid, and in _Triton_ and  _Salamandra_ three. Probably the more dorsal and lateral of these  represents the primitive scapula and the other one (or two) the  primitive coracoid.    Comparing the girdle of a salamander with that of a frog, the closest  similarity can be seen between _Ascaphus_ and a salamander in which the  scapula and coracoid ossify separately. Both have the median \"sternum\"  in contact with the coracoid plates. The major difference, of course, is  the lack of clavicle and cleithrum in the salamander.          CARPUS AND TARSUS      In _Ascaphus_ (Ritland, 1955a; cleared and stained specimens of nearly  grown males) distal carpals 1, 2, 3 and 4 are present and separate,  increasing in size in the order given (Fig. 9). A prepollex rests  against centrale 1; centralia 2 and 3 are fused; the radiale fuses with  centrale 4, and the intermedium fuses with the ulnare; radius and ulna  are fused with each other as in other frogs. The digits (and  metacarpals) are considered by Ritland to be 1-4, in addition to the  prepollex, rather than 2-5.    [Illustration: Fig. 9. Skeleton of fore foot of _Notobatrachus_ (after  Stipanicic and Reig, 1956, terminology revised) and _Ascaphus_ (after  Ritland, 1955 a); all x5. For explanation of abbreviations see Fig. 3.]    In the Jurassic _Notobatrachus_ Stipanicic and Reig (1956) have shown  the carpus with surprising clarity (Fig. 9). If their nomenclature of  the parts be revised, we obtain a fairly close resemblance to  _Ascaphus_, except that centralia 2 and 3 are not fused, distal carpals  1 and 2 do not show (which would easily be understood if they were of  the size of those in _Ascaphus_, or not ossified), and the intermedium  remains separate from the ulnare.    In _Salamandra_ (Francis, 1934; Nauck, 1938) distal carpals 1 and 2 are  fused in both larva and adult, and 3 and 4 are separate; the radiale,  intermedium and ulnare are separate in the larva but the latter two fuse  in the adult; centrale 1 (labelled prepollical cartilage by Francis) and  centrale 2 are separate. Francis considers the digits (and metacarpals)  to be 1-4. Apparently the arrangement here indicated for the larva is  characteristic of other larval salamanders, except where further  reduced, and reduction below the number given for the adult is common in  other terrestrial forms. The radius and ulna are, of course, separate.    The ossification of carpals is more likely to be complete in adult frogs  than in salamanders, but some ossification of all parts named is found  in several of the latter. A common ancestor of frogs and salamanders  could be expected to have the following elements present and ossified in  the adult: distal carpals 1-4 separate; 3 centralia; radiale,  intermedium and ulnare separate. Comparison with fossils older than  _Notobatrachus_ is fruitless on these points, unless we go back to forms  too distant to have any special value, such as _Eryops_. This is because  of inadequate preservation and because the elements are not fully  ossified in many immature specimens.    For the purpose of this review there is no special value in a comparison  of the tarsi of frogs and salamanders, since the leaping adaptation of  the former leaves very little common pattern between them. Even in  _Protobatrachus_, where the legs were not yet conspicuously lengthened,  the tibiale and fibulare (\"astragalus\" and \"calcaneum\" respectively)  were already considerably elongated. The carpus and tarsus of  _Amphibamus_ are as yet undecipherable.          THE LARVA      Considering the postembryonic developmental stages of modern Amphibia,  there can be no doubt that a gill-bearing, four-legged larva of a  salamander, in which lateral line pores and a gular fold are present,  represents much more closely the type of larva found in labyrinthodonts  than does the limbless, plant-nibbling tadpole of the Anura.  Salamander-like larvae of labyrinthodonts are well known, especially  those formerly supposed to comprise the order Branchiosauria.

Mr. 'Coon and Mr. 'Possum shook their heads. They had their troubles,  too.          THE HOLLOW TREE POETRY CLUB    HOW MR. DOG CAME TO A POETRY CLUB, AND WHAT HAPPENED      ONCE upon a time, when it was getting along toward fall in the Hollow  Tree, when Jack Rabbit and Mr. Robin and the others had come to live  with the 'Coon and 'Possum and the Old Black Crow, there began to be  long evenings, and the Hollow Tree people used to think of new ways to  pass the time. They tried games at first, and sleight-of-hand tricks.  Then they tried doing things, and Mr. Turtle carried them all together  twice around the big parlor room on his back. But even that wasn't so  funny after the first evening, and Mr. Crow, who did most of the  thinking, had to scratch his head and think pretty hard what to do next.    All at once he happened to remember that Jack Rabbit, who was the big  man of the party, was also a first rate poet, and liked to read his own  poetry better than anything. So, when he thought of that, he said:--    \"I'll tell you. We'll have a poetry club.\"    And of course that made Mr. Rabbit wake up right away.    \"What's that?\" he said. \"What kind of a thing is a poetry club?\"    \"Why,\" said Mr. Crow, \"it's a place where the members each write a poem  and read it at the next meeting. You're the only real, sure enough poet,  of course, and will be president, and write the best poem, but the rest  of us can try, and you can tell us our mistakes. I've heard that Mr. Man  has clubs, and they're ever so much fun.\"    [Illustration: HAD TO SCRATCH HIS HEAD AND THINK PRETTY HARD]    Jack Rabbit thought so, too, and all the others liked the plan. So they  elected Mr. Rabbit president and then went to work on their poems.  They couldn't have the first meeting very soon, for it took longer to  write poems in those days than it does now, so before they got half  ready the news got out some way, and even Mr. Dog had heard of it.    Poor Mr. Dog! It made him really quite ill to think he wasn't on very  good terms with the Hollow Tree people, for he thought he could write  pretty nice poetry, too, and he wanted to belong to that club worse than  anything he could think of. He wanted to so bad that at last he told Mr.  Robin that if they'd just let him come he'd promise anything they asked.    [Illustration: POOR MR. DOG]    They didn't want to let him, though, until Mr. Crow, who always felt  kind of sorry for Mr. Dog, said he didn't see why Mr. Dog shouldn't come  and look in through the window shutters, and that they could nail a seat  for him on a limb just outside. They could pull him up to it with a rope  and he could sit there and listen and applaud the poems all through  without being able to do any damage to the poets, and he would be glad  enough to be let down by the time they got done reciting.    So they sent him an invitation, and Mr. Dog was as happy as a king. He  went right to work on his poem, and he worked all night and walked up  and down the yard all day trying to think up rhymes for \"joyful\" and  \"meeting,\" and a lot of other nice words. Even when he was asleep he  dreamed about it, and said over some of the lines out loud and jerked  his paws about as if he were reciting it and making motions. You see,  Mr. Dog hadn't always done just right by the Hollow Tree people, and he  was anxious to make a good impression and fix up things. He fixed  himself all up, too, when the night came for the meeting, and took his  poem under his arm and lit a cigar that he'd borrowed of Mr. Man for the  occasion, and away he went.    The Hollow Tree people were on the look-out for him and had the rope  down and ready. So Mr. Dog tied it around under his arms, and they  pulled and pulled, and up he came. Then, when he got pretty close to the  window, they closed the shutter and put the rope through and pulled him  up still a little higher, so that he could reach the seat on the limb,  which was fixed just right for him to sit there and lean on the window  sill while he listened and looked in.    Of course, Mr. Dog wished he was inside, like the others, but he knew  why he wasn't, and he was glad enough to be there at all. He peeked  through the slats at the big room and smiled and said some nice things  about how pretty the room looked, till they all got real sociable with  him. Then Jack Rabbit called the meeting to order and made a few  remarks.    He said the duties of his office had kept him from writing quite as long  and as good a poem as he would have liked to write, but that he hoped  they might be willing to hear what he had done. Then they all shouted,  \"Yes, yes!\" and \"Hear, hear!\" and Mr. Rabbit bowed first to the ones  inside and then to Mr. Dog outside, and began:--      THE JOYS OF POETRY    BY J.

For 'tis then, from Dan to Dover,             I'm a rover 'mid the clover,          Seeking rhymes the country over             With a ring, sing, swing--             With a ding, dong, ding,             And a ting a ling a ling--          For I'm the rhyming rover of the spring.            Oh, sweet the joys of poetry             In the pleasant summer time!          For 'tis then I have no trouble             To compose my gentle rhyme;          In a nooklet by the brooklet          I can think up quite a booklet,          As with fishing line and hooklet             I assist the fish to climb             To the music of my chime,             For with rollick and with rhyme          I'm the poet of the pleasant summer time.    [Illustration: MR. RABBIT BOWED]            Oh, sweet the joys of poetry             When any days have come,          When the autumn zephyrs whisper             Or the winter breezes hum!          For 'tis then my thoughts unfurling,          While the smoke goes upward curling,          Come a whirling, swirling, twirling,             With a rumty, tumty, tum,          Come a twirling, swirling, whirling,             Like a rattle of a drum.          Come a whirling, come a swirling;             For in spring or in the summer,             In the autumn or the winter             I'm the rumty, tumty, tummer          That rejoices in the seasons as they come.    Well, when Mr. Rabbit got through everybody sat still for a minute, till  Mr. Dog called out for somebody to come and unwind him so he could get  his breath again. Then they all commenced to laugh and shout and pound  on the table. And Mr. Rabbit coughed and looked pleased and said it was  easy enough to do when you knew how.    Then Mr. 'Possum, who was next on the program, said he hoped they'd let  him off this time because he could only think of four lines, and that  he was a better hand at the dinner table than he was at poetry, anyway.  But they wouldn't do it, so he got up and looked foolish and swallowed  two or three times before he could get started.      WHAT I LOVE    BY A. PUFFINGTON 'POSSUM            I love the fragrant chicken pie            That blooms in early spring;          I love a chicken stew or fry,            Or any old thing.    Mr. 'Possum's poem was short, but it went right to the spot, and the way  they applauded almost made Jack Rabbit jealous. He said that it was  'most too true to be good poetry, but that it was good for a first  effort, and that being short helped it. Then Mr. Robin spoke his  piece:--      MOTHER AND ME    BY C. ROBIN            When the bud breaks out on the maple bough           Mother and me we build our nest--          A twig from the yard and a wisp from the mow            And four blue eggs 'neath the mother breast.          Up in the tree, mother and me,          Happy and blithe and contented are we.            When the daisies fall and the roses die,            An empty nest in the boughs to swing--          Four young robins that learn to fly            And a sweet adieu till another spring.          Then up in the tree, mother and me,          Happy once more and contented we'll be.    The applause wasn't so loud after Mr. Robin's poem, but they all said it  was very pretty, and Mr. 'Possum even wiped his eyes with his  handkerchief, because it made him remember something sad. Mr. Rabbit  said that it ought to be \"Mother and I,\" but that it didn't make much  difference, he supposed, about grammar, so long as it rhymed and sounded  nice. Then Mr. Crow got up.    [Illustration: LOOKED FOOLISH AND SWALLOWED TWO OR THREE TIMES]      JUST NOTHING    BY J. CROW            While others may sing of the pleasures of spring,            Or winter or summer or fall,          I'll sing not of these, because, if you please,            I'll sing of just nothing at all.          Just nothing at all, because, oh, ho!          I'll sing of myself, an old black crow.            As black as a coal and as homely as sin--            What more can I tell you, I pray?          For when you have nothing to sing of, why, then,            Of course there is nothing to say.          Nothing to say at all, oh, ho!          Except good-by to the old black crow--          The rollicking old black crow!    They made a good deal of fuss over Mr. Crow's poem. They applauded, of  course, but they said it wasn't so at all, and that Mr. Crow was a good  deal more than \"just nothing.\" They said that it was he who had got up  this party, and that he was the best man to plan and cook anywhere.
