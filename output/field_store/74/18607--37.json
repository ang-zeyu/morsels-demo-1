Payment       must be made as follows: There must be eighty (80) leathern       bags, each containing one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000)       in gold; the amount of ransom being eight million dollars       ($8,000,000) for four weeks' board at one million dollars       ($1,000,000) a week apiece. This money must be paid and its       genuineness certificated upon the honor of the United States by       the Secretaries of State and of the Treasury. If there is any       suspicion of infidelity on the part of the nation, the       President and his wife will be held for another month on the       same terms. Should we be betrayed in the trust which we have       reposed in the American people, on the 6th of July, at, or       previous to the time of delivery, the distinguished hostages       will immediately be put permanently beyond reach of hope._    Unscrupulous and stern was the message, yet tinged with a spurious color  of honor that demanded the true blue in return. It was the consensus of  opinion that it would be madness to attempt arrest during the  culminative ceremonies. The required gold was transferred from the  treasury vaults to the new and swift cruiser _Washington_.    Final arrangements were made for giving the imprisoned couple the most  glorious reception which ingenuity and patriotism could devise.  Reporters by hundreds bivouacked on the grounds of Mt. Vernon on the  night of the fifth. Gunboats, steamers, yachts and sail of every  description congregated to the scene of the surrender. The land teemed  with sight-seers and soldiers with stacked arms. In the midst of all  this apparent disorder, Inspector Byrnes, on his own responsibility, had  his thousand trained men, who patrolled every foot of ground within five  miles of the historic site, and who had surveyed every inch of water  from the mouth of the Potomac to the city of Washington. He had hoped to  retrieve his fame by a successful capture at the eleventh hour.    At last, though it seemed a century in coming, the morning of the sixth  of July broke solemnly upon Mt. Vernon. The revered site was flanked on  all sides by seething, excited, hopeful humanity such as these historic  shores had never before witnessed. The official command had been to  abstain from all noise and confusion on land or water from the time of  the sunrise gun.    The cannon boomed from the new navy. Then came the hush. The last hours  of waiting were spent in maddening inactivity, in strained repose. From  what quarter would the ominous signal be seen? Who would catch the first  glimpse of the boldest and most successful gang of malefactors that this  country had ever produced?          PART II.      Colonel Oddminton was a widower, with only one son, fifteen years old.  It was natural, then, that the colonel himself should balance between  forty-five and fifty years of age. Let the fact only be whispered in  desert places that the colonel was no more a colonel than you are. He  had never smelt powder, except when shooting mallard ducks. He never had  seen a regiment, except when it was marching on Decoration Day  peacefully through the woebegone streets of Charleston, preparatory to a  good dinner. His nearest idea of regalia and medals consisted of the  many adornments worn by Queer Fellows or any other order of Honorable  Unextinguished Redskins as they either laid a corner-stone or a comrade  ceremoniously in the ground. Where could he have lived and not have been  an active partisan in the stirring days of our devastating civil war?  Surely, not in the United States!    Of English exile blood, that came over a hundred years ago, he would  have been a thorough American had his parents and his environment  permitted. His family had settled on one of the many Sea Islands that  dot the coast of South Carolina, and there they had staid and raised the  famous Sea Island cotton which is still successfully used, so fine its  fibre, to adulterate a fashionable fabric. Like the baryte of Cheshire,  the cotton of Oddminton Island became valuable as it became an ally to  fraud. The one increased the weight of white lead; the other swelled the  unlawful receipts of the manufacturers of silk. Oddminton Island did not  follow the regular markets of trade. It always had its peculiar channels  of commerce; its cotton had an undiscoverable destination.    The colonel, as we will still call him, was, from his earliest memory,  sternly brought up under an atmosphere of uncanniness and secrecy, nor  did he leave his fertile island, except, as we shall mention, until his  father died and made him sole proprietor of land, slaves and family  traditions. Fully two hundred acres were under cotton cultivation. The  insignificant remainder was unentangled marsh.    Colonel Oddminton's father died in eighteen hundred and sixty-one. Then  the colonel began to expand. He had two hobbies that consumed his  imagination by day and agitated his visions by night. The one had been  shared by his deceased parent, namely, an inordinate desire to be rich;  not as wealthy as the richest family in Charleston, but as rich as all  the merchants in the \"City by the Sea\" put together. Cotton had always  given a comfortable living, but cotton was declining. It became  unsatisfactory. It was not enough.    Colonel Oddminton's other hobby was a fast boat. He had always been a  more than enthusiastic sailor. When the boy was only eighteen, his  father had given him a ten-ton sloop and allowed him to go anywhere,  provided he did not touch the mainland. This order was in accordance  with the old man's peculiarities, but was strictly obeyed. With his  black sailors the boy had cruised in every bay and inlet for a hundred  miles about. Though no one else knew it, he was the best pilot those  waters ever saw. During the war, when he was master, he never left his  island except to put his own cotton aboard English blockade runners. In  these hazardous attempts he never failed. This experience cultivated his  native qualities of courage and of self-possession.    On this island of his there was a bay that afforded fine anchorage for  two large boats. It abutted on the marsh. It was there he had built a  small camphouse. Neither the cove nor the house could be seen from the  open sea. The former could only be entered through an intricate channel,  and that when the wind and tide were favorable. The latter was  approached through heavy underbrush by a winding passage that was known  only to a few.    Colonel Oddminton was a tall, fine-looking man. He wore a long flowing  beard that had never seen the razor. His build was massive; his height  was manly.    About the time of which we are writing--this was in--but the reader  remembers--his new schooner, which he had dignified by the name of  yacht, much to the amusement of a few acquaintances, had been easily  beaten by a trim stranger, that ploughed its way to windward as if it  had been a knife eating into the teeth of the gale. He had followed this  new craft to harbor and found her to be a Herreshoff model. That night,  for the colonel's schooner was really an able and fast one, the  disappointed man was sadder than when he saw his only friend, his  father, die. He was proud of his schooner. He had cruised in her from  Baltimore to the St. John's river, and had never been so disgracefully  out-pointed and outfooted by any boat of her size before.    It was at this time that he fell into a revery that lasted a month. It  was the longest month in his life, the only one he had ever spent upon  the mainland. People pronounced him \"daft,\" decidedly cracked, but  \"harmless, you know.\" His tall figure flitted from the lobby of the  Charleston Hotel to the great cotton wharves, and then back again. At  last he awoke, and this was the outcome of his supposed aberration.    \"I don't care if it costs me my last cent, I'll have the fastest boat in  the world, and no one shall beat me again, by gum!\"    To make a long story short, he sold to an eager syndicate of English  capitalists his island for an asparagus farm, reserving for himself the  odd acres of marsh, his camp house and bay with its two moorings. On  this sale he realized a hundred thousand cash down. He then turned his  father's savings, fifty thousand dollars' worth of London consols, into  ready money. He now had a hundred and fifty thousand dollars. With this  he and his boat disappeared. No note was taken of his absence either on  his former property or in Charleston, the only other place that really  knew him, so frequent were his vagaries, so infrequent his presence.    Let us follow the Colonel in his unostentatious wanderings. He first  sailed with his son and his two trusty men direct to Washington city.  He took in the sights of the Capital for a few weeks, and then, leaving  his boat behind, pushed on by train to New York, that wonderful  metropolis that obliterates or worships men with an idea. He took  lodgings with his son in a modest boarding-house, and there met a  Swedish sailor, a man who had been captain of a steam yacht during the  summer, and now happened to be out of employment. Nautical people do not  take a long time to become acquainted. Colonel Oddminton at the end of a  week had engaged Hans Christian on the strength of his name, without  further references, at a salary of one hundred and twenty-five dollars a  month, with the proviso that his new captain should hold his tongue and  obey orders. This was about the first of November. During the last week  of the same month the yachting world, and indeed the whole maritime  contingency, were interested in the following paragraph, which was duly  copied and commented upon by the national and foreign press:         \"_The famous builders, the Herreshoffs, have taken a contract       to build a steel yacht that shall develop the enormous speed of       35 knots an hour. They are given 'carte blanche' for"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33687"],[0,"Illustrative Anecdotes of the Animal Kingdom (#4)"],[1,"by his  forbearance under injuries, which were grievous before he was excited  to revenge; but he always avoided those who often teased him. He soon  became strongly attached to those who kindly used him. By their side he  was fond of sitting; and getting as close as possible to their persons,  would take their hands between his lips, and fly to them for  protection. From the boatswain of the Alceste, who shared his meals  with him, and was his chief favorite, although he sometimes purloined  the grog and the biscuit of his benefactor, he learned to eat with a  spoon; and might be often seen sitting at his cabin door, enjoying his  coffee, quite unembarrassed by those who observed him, and with a  grotesque and sober air, that seemed a burlesque on human nature.    \"On board ship he commonly slept at the masthead, after wrapping  himself in a sail. In making his bed, he used the greatest pains to  remove every thing out of his way that might render the surface on  which he intended to lie uneven; and, having satisfied himself with  this part of his arrangement, spread out the sail, and, lying down upon  it on his back, drew it over his body. Sometimes I preoccupied his bed,  and teased him by refusing to give it up. On these occasions he would  endeavor to pull the sail from under me, or to force me from it, and  would not rest till I had resigned it. If it were large enough for  both, he would quietly lie by my side.    \"His food in Java was chiefly fruit, especially mangostans, of which he  was extremely fond. He also sucked eggs with voracity, and often  employed himself in seeking them. On board ship his diet was of no  definite kind. He ate readily of all kinds of meat, and especially raw  meat; was very fond of bread, but always preferred fruits, when he  could obtain them.    \"His beverage in Java was water; on board ship, it was as diversified  as his food. He preferred coffee and tea, but would readily take wine,  and exemplified his attachment to spirits by stealing the captain's  brandy bottle. Since his arrival in London, he has preferred beer and  milk to any thing else, but drinks wine and other liquors.    \"I have seen him exhibit violent alarm on three occasions only, when he  appeared to seek for safety in gaining as high an elevation as  possible. On seeing eight large turtles brought on board, whilst the  Caesar was off the Island of Ascension, he climbed with all possible  speed to a higher part of the ship than he had ever before reached,  and, looking down upon them, projected his long lips into the form of a  hog's snout, uttering, at the same time, a sound which might be  described as between the croaking of a frog and the grunting of a pig.  After some time, he ventured to descend, but with great caution,  peeping continually at the turtles, but could not be induced to  approach within many yards of them. He ran to the same height, and  uttered the same sounds, on seeing some men bathing and splashing in  the sea; and since his arrival in England, has shown nearly the same  degree of fear at the sight of a live tortoise.\"    This animal survived his transportation to England from August, 1817,  when he arrived, to the 1st April, 1819; during which interval he was  in the custody of Mr. Cross, at Exeter 'Change, as much caressed for  the gentleness of his disposition as he was noticed for his great  rarity. There was no need of personal confinement, and little of  restraint or coercion; to his keepers, especially, and to those whom he  knew by their frequent visits, he displayed a decided partiality.  During his last illness, and at his death, his piteous appearance,  which seemed to bespeak his entreaties to those about him for relief,  did not fail to excite the feelings of all who witnessed them--an  excitement evidently heightened by the recollection of human suffering  under similar circumstances, which the sight of this animal so strongly  brought to mind.    The CHIMPANSE;--a native of Guinea and Congo, in Africa. Its frame is  more analogous to that of man than to that of any other tribe, and it  is the only one that can walk erect with ease. It lives in troops, uses  stones and clubs as weapons, and was mistaken for a species of wild  man, by early voyagers along the African coast.    _The Chimpanse on Board a Vessel._--M. De Grandpre, speaking of the  Chimpanse, says that \"his sagacity is extraordinary; he generally walks  upon two legs, supporting himself with a stick. The negro fears him,  and not without reason, as he sometimes treats him very roughly. He  saw, on board a vessel, a female chimpanse, which exhibited wonderful  proofs of intelligence. Among other arts, she had learnt to heat the  oven; she took great care not to let any of the coals fall out, which  might have done mischief in the ship; and she was very accurate in  observing when the oven was heated to the proper degree, of which she  immediately apprized the baker, who, relying with perfect confidence  upon her information, carried his dough to the oven as soon as the  chimpanse came to fetch him. This animal performed all the business of  a sailor, spliced ropes, handled the sails, and assisted at unfurling  them; and she was, in fact, considered by the sailors as one of  themselves.    \"The vessel was bound for America; but the poor animal did not live to  see that country, having fallen a victim to the brutality of the first  mate, who inflicted very cruel chastisement upon her, which she had not  deserved. She endured it with the greatest patience, only holding out  her hands in a suppliant attitude, in order to break the force of the  blows she received. But from that moment she steadily refused to take  any food, and died on the fifth day from grief and hunger. She was  lamented by every person on board, not insensible to the feelings of  humanity, who knew the circumstances of her fate.\"    The GIBBON;--a native of Sumatra, Borneo, and Malacca. The arms are of  immense length, and the hands and feet are formed for clinging to the  limbs of trees, where it throws itself from branch to branch with  surprising agility. The expression of the face is gentle, and rather  melancholy. There are many species, all of which utter loud cries.    _The nimble Gibbon, at the Zoological Gardens in London._--\"This  specimen,\" says the editor of the Penny Magazine, \"was a female, and  had been four years in captivity at Macao, previous to her arrival in  this country. On entering the apartment in which she was to be kept,  where a large space, and a tree full of branches, were allotted for her  accommodation, she sprang upon the tree, and, using her hands in  alternate succession, she launched herself from bough to bough with  admirable grace and address, sometimes to the distance of twelve or  eighteen feet. Her flight might be termed aerial, for she seemed  scarcely to touch the branches in her progress. It was curious to  witness how abruptly she would stop in her most rapid flight. Suddenly  as thought, she would raise her body, and sit quietly gazing at the  astonished spectators of her gymnastics.    \"She possessed great quickness of eye; and apples, and other fruit,  were often thrown at her with great rapidity, but she always caught  them without an effort. On one occasion, a live bird was set at liberty  in her apartment. She marked its flight, made a spring to a distant  branch, caught the bird with one hand, on her passage, and attained the  branch with her other hand. She instantly bit off the head of the bird,  picked off its feathers, and threw it down, without attempting to eat  it.    \"While exerting herself in feats of agility, the gibbon ever and anon  uttered her call-notes, consisting of the syllables _oo-ah_, _oo-ah_,  in a succession of ascending and descending semitones, during the  execution of which, the lips and frame vibrated. The tones were not  unmusical, but deafening, from their loudness.    \"In disposition, this creature was timid, being apparently afraid of  men, but allowing women to come near her, and stroke her fur, and pat  her hands and feet. Her eye was quick, and she seemed to be perpetually  on the watch, scrutinizing every person who entered the room. After  exercising in the morning from three to four hours, she would, if  allowed, spend the rest of the day quietly on one of the branches.\"      THE BABOON.    This is a large and ferocious species of ape, common in the south of  Africa, and Asia.    _Le Vaillant's Baboon._--This celebrated traveller, while in Africa,  had a dog-faced baboon, whom he called _Kees_. He accompanied his  master in his wanderings, and of his way of life we have the following  sketches: \"I made him,\" says Le Vaillant, \"my taster. Whenever we found  fruits, or roots, with which my Hottentots were unacquainted, we did  not touch them till Kees had tasted them. If he threw them away, we  concluded that they were either of a disagreeable flavor, or of a  pernicious quality, and left them untasted. The ape possesses a  peculiar property, wherein he differs greatly from other animals, and  resembles man--namely, that he is by nature equally gluttonous and  inquisitive. Without necessity, and without appetite, he tastes every  thing that falls in his way, or that is given to him.    \"But Kees had a still more valuable quality: he was an excellent  sentinel; for, whether by day or night, he immediately sprang up on the  slightest appearance of danger. By his cry, and the symptoms of fear  which he exhibited, we were always apprized of the approach of an  enemy, even though the dogs perceived nothing of it. The latter at  length learned to rely upon him with such confidence, that they slept  on in perfect tranquillity. I often took Kees with me when I went  a-hunting; and when he saw me preparing for sport, he exhibited the  most lively demonstrations of joy. On the way, he would climb into the  trees, to look for gum, of which he was very fond."]]]
