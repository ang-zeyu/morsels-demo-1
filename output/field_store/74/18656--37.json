In the midst of this city sat Nebuchadnezzar,  enthroned in royal splendor and magnificence, and swaying his sceptre  over all the kingdoms of the world, when it pleased God, in a vision  of the night, to unveil the dark curtain of the future, and to present  before him, at one view, the history of the world, even down to the  consummation of all things. Behold, a great image stood before him,  whose head was of fine gold, his breast and arms of silver, his belly  and thighs of brass, his legs of iron, his feet and toes part of iron  and part of miry clay. He beheld, till a stone was cut out of the  mountain without hands, which smote the image upon the feet, which  were part of iron and part of clay, and brake them in pieces; then was  the iron, the brass, the silver, and the gold, broken to pieces  together, and became as the chaff of the summer threshing-floors; and  the wind carried them away, and there was no place found for them; but  the stone which smote the image became a great mountain, and filled  the whole earth. When Daniel was brought in before the king, to tell  the dream and the interpretation, he exclaimed, \"There is a God in  heaven that revealeth secrets, and maketh known to the king,  Nebuchadnezzar, what shall be in the latter days.\" Then, after telling  the dream, he continues thus: \"Thou, O king, art a king of kings; for  the God of heaven hath given thee a kingdom, power, and strength, and  glory. And wheresoever the children of men dwell, the beasts of the  field and the fowls of the heaven hath he given into thine hand, and  hath made thee ruler over them all. Thou _art_ this head of gold. And  after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee, and another  third kingdom of brass, which shall bear rule over all the earth. And  the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron: forasmuch as iron breaketh  in pieces and subdueth all _things_; and as iron that breaketh all  these, shall it break in pieces and bruise. And whereas thou sawest  the feet and toes, part of potters' clay, and part of iron, the  kingdom shall be divided: but there shall be in it of the strength of  the iron, forasmuch as thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay. And  _as_ the toes of the feet _were_ part of iron, and part of clay, _so_  the kingdom shall be partly strong, and partly broken. And whereas  thou sawest iron mixed with miry clay, they shall mingle themselves  with the seed of men: but they shall not cleave one to another, even  as iron is not mixed with clay. And in the days of these kings shall  the God of heaven set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed:  and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, _but_ it shall  break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand  forever. Forasmuch as thou sawest that the stone was cut out of the  mountain without hands, and that it brake in pieces the iron, the  brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold; the great God hath made  known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter; and the dream  _is_ certain, and the interpretation thereof sure.\"    In this great view of the subject we have presented before us, in  succession, first, the kingdom of Nebuchadnezzar; second, the Medes  and Persians, who took Babylon from Belshazzar, and reigned over all  the earth; third, the Greeks under Alexander, who conquered the world,  and reigned in the midst of Babylon; and fourth, the Roman empire,  which subdued all things; fifth, its division into eastern and western  empires, and its final breaking up or subdivision into the various  kingdoms of modern Europe, represented by the feet and toes, part of  iron and part of clay. And, lastly, we have presented before us an  entirely new kingdom, organized by the God of heaven in the last days,  or during the reign of these kings, represented by the feet and toes.  This last kingdom was never to change masters, like all the kingdoms  which had gone before it. It was never to be left to another people.  It was to break in pieces all these kingdoms, and stand forever. Many  suppose that this last kingdom alluded to was the kingdom of God which  was organized in the days of Christ, or his Apostles. But a greater  _blunder_ could not exist; the kingdom of God set up in the days of  Christ, or his Apostles, did not break in pieces any of the kingdoms  of the world: it was itself warred against and overcome, in fulfilment  of the words of Daniel, chapter vii, 21; \"I beheld, and the same horn  made war with the saints, and prevailed against them;\" also 22d verse,  \"Until the Ancient of Days came, and judgment was given to the saints  of the Most High; and the time came that the saints possessed the  kingdom;\" also verse 27th, \"And the kingdom and dominion, and the  greatness of the kingdom, under the whole heaven, shall be given to  the people of the saints of the Most High, whose kingdom is an  everlasting kingdom; and all dominions shall serve and obey him.\"    John records, Rev. xiii. 7, \"And it was given unto him to make war  with the saints, and to overcome them; and power was given him over  all kindreds, and tongues, and nations.\" In fulfilment of these  sayings, power has been given, to the authorities of the earth to kill  the Apostles and inspired men, until, if any remained, they were  banished from among men, or forced to retire to the desolate islands,  or the dens and caves of the mountains of the earth, being men of whom  the world was not worthy; while at the same time, many false prophets  and teachers were introduced in their place, whom men heaped to  themselves, because they would not endure sound doctrine. In this way  the kingdom of God became _disorganized_, and _lost_ from among men,  and the doctrines and churches of men instituted in its place. But we  design to speak more fully on this subject when we come to treat on  the subject of the kingdom of God. Suffice it to say, that the kingdom  spoken of by Daniel is something to be organized in the last days, by  the God of heaven Himself, without the aid of human institutions or  the precepts of men. And, when once organized, it will never cease to  roll; all the powers of earth and hell will not impede its progress,  until at length the Ancient of Days shall sit, and the Lord Jesus will  come in the clouds of heaven, with power and great glory, as the King  of kings, and Lord of lords, and destroy all these kingdoms, and give  the kingdom and the greatness of the kingdom, under the whole heaven,  to the Saints. Then there will be but one Lord, and His name one, and  He shall be King over all the earth.    We will now return to Nebuchadnezzar, whom the Lord, by the mouth of  Jeremiah, calls His servant, to execute His judgment upon the nations.  It seems that the Lord exalted this great man, and made him a king of  kings, and lord of lords, arming him with His own sword, and clothing  him with power and authority, for the express purpose of executing His  judgments, and scourging and humbling all the nations of the earth.  Jeremiah, chapter xxv, says that the Lord purposed to bring  Nebuchadnezzar and his army against Jerusalem, and against all the  nations round about, that he might bring them to desolation and  captivity for seventy years; and after seventy years, He would turn  and punish the king of Babylon and that nation for their iniquity.  Now, who can trace the history of the fulfilment of these great  events, so exactly pointed out by Jeremiah, Isaiah, and Ezekiel, and  not be struck with astonishment and wonder at the marvellous _gift of  prophecy_ enabling men in those days to read the history of the future  as they read the history of the past? Indeed, the reader of history in  the nineteenth century, holding in his hand the history of the  Babylonians, Medes and Persians, Greeks, Romans and Egyptians,  together with that of the Jews, will hardly render himself more  familiar with the events which transpired among those nations, than  the Prophets were seventy years previous to their accomplishment.    The Jews were reduced to subjection by Nebuchadnezzar; their city,  Jerusalem, was burned, together with their temple; their princes,  nobles, and people were carried to Babylon, together with all their  holy things. All the particulars of this destruction and captivity  were distinctly foretold by Jeremiah, and the time of its continuance,  viz., seventy years. After subduing the Jews, the king of Babylon  marched his army against Tyre, the city of merchants, situated at the  haven of the sea, surrounded not only by the sea, but by a strong  wall. A hold so strong required the utmost skill and perseverance of  Nebuchadnezzar and his whole army, who labored incessantly for a long  time, and at length succeeded in taking Tyre, and bringing it into  captivity for seventy years. After which they returned and established  their city, for Jeremiah had previously foretold the reduction of  Tyre, its captivity for seventy years, and its restoration at the  expiration of that time. After the restoration of Tyre, the city  flourished for a time, but was afterwards reduced to an entire  desolation. Its ruined fragments are seen to this day in the bottom of  the sea; its site has become a barren rock, only occupied by poor  fishermen. All this desolation, and even its present appearance of  desolation and perpetual waste, were clearly pointed out by the  Prophets.    But when the king of Babylon had succeeded in taking Tyre, after many  a bald head and peeled shoulder, caused by the hard service of his  army in the siege, the Lord, by the mouth of Ezekiel, promised to give  the spoils of Egypt unto him, for wages for his army, in order to pay  him for the great service, wherewith he had served God, against Tyre.  Next, witness his war in the taking of Egypt, and bringing it into  captivity, until the seventy years were accomplished."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3567"],[0,"Memoirs of Napoleon Bonaparte — Complete (#4)"],[1,"attention has been paid to the Memoirs of  Madame de Rémusat. She, as also Madame Junot, was the wife of a man  on whom the full shower of imperial favours did not descend, and,  womanlike, she saw and thought only of the Court life of the great man  who was never less great than in his Court. She is equally astonished  and indignant that the Emperor, coming straight from long hours of work  with his ministers and with his secretary, could not find soft words  for the ladies of the Court, and that, a horrible thing in the eyes of  a Frenchwoman, when a mistress threw herself into his arms, he  first thought of what political knowledge he could obtain from her.  Bourrienne, on the other hand, shows us the other and the really  important side of Napoleon's character. He tells us of the long hours in  the Cabinet, of the never-resting activity of the Consul, of Napoleon's  dreams, no ignoble dreams and often realised, of great labours of peace  as well as of war. He is a witness, and the more valuable as a reluctant  one, to the marvellous powers of the man who, if not the greatest, was  at least the one most fully endowed with every great quality of mind and  body the world has ever seen.    R. W. P.        AUTHOR'S INTRODUCTION.    The trading upon an illustrious name can alone have given birth to the  multitude of publications under the titles of historical memoirs, secret  memoirs, and other rhapsodies which have appeared respecting Napoleon.  On looking into them it is difficult to determine whether the impudence  of the writers or the simplicity of certain readers is most astonishing.  Yet these rude and ill digested compilations, filled with absurd  anecdotes, fabricated speeches, fictitious crimes or virtues, and  disfigured by numerous anachronisms, instead of being consigned to  just contempt and speedy oblivion, have been pushed into notice  by speculators, and have found zealous partisans and enthusiastic  apologists.         --[This Introduction has been reprinted as bearing upon the     character of the work, but refers very often to events of the     day at the time of its first appearance.]--    For a time I entertained the idea of noticing, one by one, the numerous  errors which have been written respecting Napoleon; but I have renounced  a task which would have been too laborious to myself, and very tedious  to the reader. I shall therefore only correct those which come within  the plan of my work, and which are connected with those facts, to a more  accurate knowledge of which than any other person can possess I may lay  claim. There are men who imagine that nothing done by Napoleon will ever  be forgotten; but must not the slow but inevitable influence of time be  expected to operate with respect to him? The effect of that influence  is, that the most important event of an epoch soon sinks, almost  imperceptibly and almost disregarded, into the immense mass of  historical facts. Time, in its progress, diminishes the probability as  well as the interest of such an event, as it gradually wears away the  most durable monuments.    I attach only a relative importance to what I am about to lay before  the public. I shall give authentic documents. If all persons who have  approached Napoleon, at any time and in any place, would candidly record  what they saw and heard, without passion, the future historian would be  rich in materials. It is my wish that he who may undertake the  difficult task of writing the history of Napoleon shall find in my notes  information useful to the perfection of his work. There he will at least  find truth. I have not the ambition to wish that what I state should  be taken as absolute authority; but I hope that it will always be  consulted.    I have never before published anything respecting Napoleon. That  malevolence which fastens itself upon men who have the misfortune to  be somewhat separated from the crowd has, because there is always  more profit in saying ill than good, attributed to me several works on  Bonaparte; among others, 'Les Memoires secrets d'un Homme qui ne l'a pas  quitte', par M. B-------, and 'Memoires secrets sur Napoleon Bonaparte,  par M. de B------, and 'Le Precis Historique sur Napoleon'. The initial  of my name has served to propagate this error. The incredible ignorance  which runs through those memoirs, the absurdities and inconceivable  silliness with which they abound, do not permit a man of honour and  common sense to allow such wretched rhapsodies to be imputed to him.  I declared in 1816, and at later periods in the French and foreign  journals, that I had no hand in those publications, and I here formally  repeat this declaration.    But it may be said to me, Why should we place more confidence in you  than in those who have written before you?    My reply shall be plain. I enter the lists one of the last I have read  all that my predecessors have published confident that all I state is  true. I have no interest in deceiving, no disgrace to fear, no reward to  expect. I neither wish to obscure nor embellish his glory. However great  Napoleon may have been, was he not also liable to pay his tribute to the  weakness of human nature? I speak of Napoleon such as I have seen him,  known him, frequently admired and sometimes blamed him. I state what I  saw, heard, wrote, and thought at the time, under each circumstance that  occurred. I have not allowed myself to be carried away by the illusions  of the imagination, nor to be influenced by friendship or hatred. I  shall not insert a single reflection which did not occur to me at the  very moment of the event which gave it birth. How many transactions and  documents were there over which I could but lament!--how many measures,  contrary to my views, to my principles, and to my character!--while the  best intentions were incapable of overcoming difficulties which a most  powerful and decided will rendered almost insurmountable.    I also wish the future historian to compare what I say with what others  have related or may relate. But it will be necessary for him to attend  to dates, circumstances, difference of situation, change of temperament,  and age,--for age has much influence over men. We do not think and act  at fifty as at twenty-five. By exercising this caution he will be able  to discover the truth, and to establish an opinion for posterity.    The reader must not expect to find in these Memoirs an uninterrupted  series of all the events which marked the great career of Napoleon; nor  details of all those battles, with the recital of which so many eminent  men have usefully and ably occupied themselves. I shall say little about  whatever I did not see or hear, and which is not supported by official  documents.    Perhaps I shall succeed in confirming truths which have been doubted,  and in correcting errors which have been adopted. If I sometimes differ  from the observations and statements of Napoleon at St. Helena, I am  far from supposing that those who undertook to be the medium of  communication between him and the public have misrepresented what he  said. I am well convinced that none of the writers of St. Helena can be  taxed with the slightest deception; disinterested zeal and nobleness  of character are undoubted pledges of their veracity. It appears to me  perfectly certain that Napoleon stated, dictated, or corrected all they  have published. Their honour is unquestionable; no one can doubt it.  That they wrote what he communicated must therefore be believed; but it  cannot with equal confidence be credited that what he communicated was  nothing but the truth. He seems often to have related as a fact what  was really only an idea,--an idea, too, brought forth at St. Helena, the  child of misfortune, and transported by his imagination to Europe in the  time of his prosperity. His favourite phrase, which was every moment  on his lips, must not be forgotten--\"What will history say--what will  posterity think?\" This passion for leaving behind him a celebrated name  is one which belongs to the constitution of the human mind; and with  Napoleon its influence was excessive. In his first Italian campaign he  wrote thus to General Clarke: \"That ambition and the occupation of high  offices were not sufficient for his satisfaction and happiness, which he  had early placed in the opinion of Europe and the esteem of posterity.\"  He often observed to me that with him the opinion of posterity was the  real immortality of the soul.    It may easily be conceived that Napoleon wished to give to the documents  which he knew historians would consult a favourable colour, and to  direct, according to his own views, the judgment of posterity on  his actions: But it is only by the impartial comparison of periods,  positions, and age that a well founded decision will be given. About  his fortieth year the physical constitution of Napoleon sustained  considerable change; and it may be presumed that his moral qualities  were affected by that change. It is particularly important not to lose  sight of the premature decay of his health, which, perhaps, did not  permit him always to, possess the vigour of memory otherwise consistent  enough with his age. The state of our organisation often modifies our  recollections, our feelings, our manner of viewing objects, and the  impressions we receive. This will be taken into consideration by  judicious and thinking men; and for them I write.    What M. de Las Casas states Napoleon to have said in May 1816 on the  manner of writing his history corroborates the opinion I have expressed.  It proves that all the facts and observations he communicated or  dictated were meant to serve as materials. We learn from the Memorial  that M. de Las Casas wrote daily, and that the manuscript was read over  by Napoleon, who often made corrections with his own hand. The idea of a  journal pleased him greatly. He fancied it would be a work of which the  world could afford "]]]
