It am  sort of like de small town, 'cause everything we uses am made right  there. There am de shoemaker and he is de tanner and make de leather  from de hides. Den massa has 'bout a thousand sheep and he gits de wool,  and de niggers cards and spins and weaves it, and dat makes all de  clothes. Den massa have cattle and sich purvide de milk and de butter  and beef meat for eatin'. Den massa have de turkeys and chickens and de  hawgs and de bees. With all that, us never was hongry.    \"De plantation am planted in cotton, mostly, with de corn and de wheat a  little, 'cause massa don't need much of dem. He never sell nothin' but  de cotton.    \"De livin' for de cullud folks am good. De quarters am built from logs  like deys all in dem days. De floor am de dirt but we has de benches and  what is made on de place. And we has de big fireplace for to cook and we  has plenty to cook in dat fireplace, 'cause massa allus 'lows plenty  good rations, but he watch close for de wastin' of de food.    \"De war breaks and dat make de big change on de massas place. He jines  de army and hires a man call' Delbridge for overseer. After dat, de hell  start to pop, 'cause de first thing Delbridge do is cut de rations. He  weighs out de meat, three pound for de week, and he measure a peck of  meal. And 'twarn't enough. He half starve us niggers and he want mo'  work and he start de whippin's. I guesses he starts to edumacate 'em. I  guess dat Delbridge go to hell when he died, but I don't see how de  debbil could stand him.    \"We'uns am not use' to sich and some runs off. When dey am cotched there  am a whippin' at de stake. But dat Delbridge, he sold me to Massa House,  in Blanco County. I's sho' glad when I's sold, but it am short gladness,  'cause here am another man what hell am too good for. He gives me de  whippin' and de scars am still on my arms and my back, too. I'll carry  dem to my grave. He sends me for firewood and when I gits it loaded, de  wheel hits a stump and de team jerks and dat breaks de whippletree. So  he ties me to de stake and every half hour for four hours, dey lays ta  lashes on my back. For de first couple hours de pain am awful. I's never  forgot it. Den I's stood so much pain I not feel so much and when dey  takes me loose, I's jus' 'bout half dead. I lays in de bunk two days,  gittin' over dat whippin', gittin' over it in de body but not de heart.  No, suh, I has dat in de heart till dis day.    \"After dat whippin' I doesn't have de heart to work for de massa. If I  seed de cattle in de cornfield, I turns de back, 'stead of chasin' 'em  out. I guess dat de reason de massa sold me to his brother, Massa John.  And he am good like my first massa, he never whipped me.    \"Den surrender am 'nounced and massa tells us we's free. When dat takes  place, it am 'bout one hour by sun. I says to myself, 'I won't be here  long.' But I's not realise what I's in for till after I's started, but I  couldn't turn back. For dat means de whippin' or danger from de patter  rollers. Dere I was and I kep' on gwine. No nigger am sposed to be off  de massa's place without de pass, so I travels at night and hides durin'  de daylight. I stays in de bresh and gits water from de creeks, but not  much to eat. Twice I's sho' dem patter rollers am passin' while I's  hidin'.    \"I's 21 year old den, but it am de first time I's gone any place, 'cept  to de neighbors, so I's worried 'bout de right way to Massa Haley's  place. But de mornin' of de third day I comes to he place and I's so  hongry and tired and scairt for fear Massa Haley not home from de army  yit. So I finds my pappy and he hides me in he cabin till a week and den  luck comes to me when Massa Haley come home. He come at night and de  next mornin' dat Delbridge am shunt off de place, 'cause Massa Haley  seed he niggers was all gaunt and lots am ran off and de fields am not  plowed right, and only half de sheep and everything left. So massa say  to dat Delbridge, 'Dere am no words can 'splain what yous done. Git off  my place 'fore I smashes you.'    \"Den I kin come out from my pappy's cabin and de old massa was glad to  see me, and he let me stay till freedom am ordered.

An interesting character at Centerville, Texas, is \"Uncle Willis\"  Anderson, an ex-slave, born April 15, 1844, 6 miles west of Centerville  on the old McDaniels plantation near what is now known as Hopewell  Settlement. It is generally said that \"Uncle Willis\" is one of the  oldest living citizens in the County, black or white. He is referred to  generally for information concerning days gone by and for the history of  that County, especially in the immediate vicinity of Centerville.    \"Uncle Willis\" is an interesting figure. He may be found sitting on the  porches of the stores facing Federal Highway No. 75, nodding or  conversing with small groups of white or colored people that gather  around him telling of the days gone by. He also likes to watch the  busses and automobiles that pass through the small town musing and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30626"],[0,"Birds, Illustrated (#4)"],[1,"in a corner of the porch, but  oftener it is saddled on the horizontal limb of an orchard tree. It is  so large and poorly concealed that any boy can find it, yet it is seldom  molested. The Robin is not a skillful architect. The masonry of its nest  is rough and the material coarse, being composed largely of leaves or  old grass, cemented with mud. The eggs number four to six and are  greenish blue in color.    An observer tells the following story of this domestic favorite:    \"For the last three years a Robin has nested on a projecting pillar that  supports the front piazza. In the Spring of the first year she built her  nest on the top of the pillar--a rude affair--it was probably her first  effort. The same season she made her second nest in the forks of an Oak,  which took her only a few hours to complete.    [Continued page 59.]    [Illustration: AMERICAN ROBIN.]          [Illustration: MEXICAN MOT MOT.]          THE AMERICAN ROBIN. (Continued)    \"She reared three broods that season; for the third family she returned  to the piazza, and repaired the first nest. The following Spring she  came again to the piazza, but selected another pillar for the site of  her domicile, the construction of which was a decided improvement upon  the first. For the next nest she returned to the Oak and raised a second  story on the old one of the previous year, but making it much more  symmetrical than the one beneath. The present season her first dwelling  was as before, erected on a pillar of the piazza--as fine a structure as  I ever saw this species build. When this brood was fledged she again  repaired to the Oak, and reared a third story on the old domicile, using  the moss before mentioned, making a very elaborate affair, and finally  finishing up by festooning it with long sprays of moss. This bird and  her mate were quite tame. I fed them with whortleberries, which they  seemed to relish, and they would come almost to my feet to get them.    The amount of food which the young robin is capable of absorbing is  enormous. A couple of vigorous, half-grown birds have been fed, and in  twelve hours devoured ravenously, sixty-eight earth worms, weighing  thirty-four pennyweight, or forty-one per cent more than their own  weight. A man at this rate should eat about seventy pounds of flesh per  day, and drink five or six gallons of water.    The following poem by the good Quaker poet Whittier is sweet because  _he_ wrote it, interesting because it recites an old legend which  incidentally explains the color of the robin's breast, and unique  because it is one of the few poems about our American bird.      THE ROBIN.         My old Welsh neighbor over the way         Crept slowly out in the sun of spring,       Pushed from her ears the locks of gray,         And listened to hear the robin sing.         Her grandson, playing at marbles, stopped,         And--cruel in sport, as boys will be--       Tossed a stone at the bird, who hopped         From bough to bough in the apple tree.        \"Nay!\" said the grandmother; \"have you not heard,         My poor, bad boy! of the fiery pit,       And how, drop by drop, this merciful bird         Carries the water that quenches it?        \"He brings cool dew in his little bill,         And lets it fall on the souls of sin:       You can see the mark on his red breast still         Of fires that scorch as he drops it in.        \"My poor Bron rhuddyn! my breast-burned bird,         Singing so sweetly from limb to limb,       Very dear to the heart of Our Lord         Is he who pities the lost like Him.\"        \"Amen!\" I said to the beautiful myth;         \"Sing, bird of God, in my heart as well:       Each good thought is a drop wherewith         To cool and lessen the fires of hell.        \"Prayers of love like rain-drops fall,         Tears of pity are cooling dew,       And dear to the heart of Our Lord are all         Who suffer like Him in the good they do.\"          THE KINGFISHER.      Dear Children:    I shall soon arrive from the south. I hear that all the birds are going  to tell stories to the boys and girls.    I have never talked much with children myself for I never really cared  for people. They used to say that the dead body of a Kingfisher kept  them safe in war and they said also that it protected them in lightning.    Even now in some places in France they call us the moth birds, for they  believe that our bodies will keep away moths from woolen cloth.    I wish that people would not believe such things about us. Perhaps you  cannot understand me when I talk. You may think that you hear only a  child's rattle.    Listen again! It is I, the Kingfisher. That sound is my way of talking.  I live in the deep woods. I own a beautiful stream and a clear, cool  lake. Oh, the little fish in that lake are good enough for a king to  eat! I know, for I am a king.    You may see me or some of my mates near the lake any pleasant day.  People used to say that we always brought pleasant weather. That is a  joke. It is the pleasant weather that always brings us from our homes.  When it storms or rains we cannot see the fish in the lake. Then we may  as well stay in our nests.    My home once belonged to a water rat. He dug the fine hall in the gravel  bank in my stream. It is nearly six feet long. The end of it is just the  kind of a place for a nest. It is warm, dry and dark. In June my wife  and I will settle down in it. By that time we shall have the nest well  lined with fish bones. We shall put in some dried grass too. The fish  bones make a fine lining for a nest. You know we swallow the fish whole,  but we save all the bones for our nest.    I shall help my wife hatch her five white eggs and shall try in every  way to make my family safe.    Please tell the people not to believe those strange things about me and  you will greatly oblige,                          A neighbor,                           THE KINGFISHER.     [Illustration: KINGFISHER.                  Copyrighted by                  Nature Study Pub. Co., 1897, Chicago.]          THE KINGFISHER.    The Lone Fisherman.      The American species belongs to the true group of Kingfishers. It  occupies the whole continent of North America and although migrating in  the north, he is a constant resident of our southern states. The belted  Kingfisher is the only variety found along the inland streams of the  United States. Audubon declares that \"belted\" should apply only to the  female, however.    Like most birds of brilliant plumage, the Kingfisher prefers a quiet  and secluded haunt. It loves the little trout streams, with wooded and  precipitous banks, the still ponds and small lakes, ornamental waters  in parks, where it is not molested, and the sides of sluggish rivers,  drains and mill-ponds.    Here in such a haunt the bird often flits past like an indistinct gleam  of bluish light. Fortune may sometimes favor the observer and the bird  may alight on some twig over the stream, its weight causing it to sway  gently to and fro. It eagerly scans the shoal of young trout sporting in  the pool below, when suddenly it drops down into the water, and, almost  before the observer is aware of the fact, is back again to its perch  with a struggling fish in its beak. A few blows on the branch and its  prey is ready for the dexterous movement of the bill, which places it  in a position for swallowing. Sometimes the captured fish is adroitly  jerked into the air and caught as it falls.    Fish is the principal food of the Kingfisher; but it also eats various  kinds of insects, shrimps, and even small crabs. It rears its young in  a hole, which is made in the banks of the stream it frequents. It is a  slatternly bird, fouls its own nest and its peerless eggs. The nesting  hole is bored rather slowly, and takes from one to two weeks to  complete. Six or eight white glossy eggs are laid, sometimes on the bare  soil, but often on the fish bones which, being indigestible, are thrown  up by the bird in pellets.    The Kingfisher has a crest of feathers on the top of his head, which he  raises and lowers, especially when trying to drive intruders away from  his nest.    The plumage is compact and oily, making it almost impervious to water.  The flesh is fishy and disagreeable to the taste, but the eggs are said  to be good eating. The wings are long and pointed and the bill longer  than the head. The voice is harsh and monotonous.    It is said that few birds are connected with more fables than the  Kingfisher. The superstition that a dead Kingfisher when suspended  by the throat, would turn its beak to that particular point of the  compass from which the wind blew, is now dead. It was also supposed  to possess many astonishing virtues, as that its dried body would avert  thunderbolts, and if kept in a wardrobe would preserve from moths the  woolen stuffs and the like contained in it.    Under the name of \"halcyon,\" it was fabled by the ancients to build its  nest on the surface of the sea, and to have the power of calming the  troubled waves during its period of incubation; hence the phrase  \"halcyon days.\"    A pair of Kingfishers have had their residence in a bank at the south  end of Washington Park, Chicago, for at least three seasons past. We  have watched the Kingfisher from secluded spots on Long Island ponds and  tidal streams, where his peculiar laughing note is the same as that  which greets the ear of the fisherman on far inland streams on still  summer days.          THE BLACKBIRD.        \"I could not think so plain a bird         Could sing so fine a song.\"          One on another against the wall      Pile up the books--I am done with them all;      I shall be wise, if I ever am wise,      Out of my own ears, and of my own eyes.
