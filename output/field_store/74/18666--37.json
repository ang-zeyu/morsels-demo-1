The shirts ran with prodigious speed, their speed       exposing their bare, black, and meager shanks to the scandal       of all beholders; and the strange baboon in trowsers       struggled close in their rear, with ludicrous earnestness,       holding up his redundant and troublesome apparel with his       hand. In a moment they reached the brook with unchecked       speed, and, as the banks were muddy, and the dogs had become       entangled with the racers in their path, two or three were       precipitated into the water. This only increased the       merriment, and they continued the contest in this new       element by floundering, kicking, and splashing about, like a       brood of ducks in their first descent upon a pool. These       young negroes have wonderfully flat noses, and the most       oddly disproportioned mouths, which were now opened to their       full dimensions, so as to display their white teeth in       striking contrast with their complexions. They are a strange       pack of antic and careless animals, and furnish the       liveliest picture that is to be found in nature of that race       of swart fairies, which, in the old time, were supposed to       play their pranks in the forest at moonlight. Ned stood by,       enjoying this scene like an amateur--encouraging the negroes       in their gambols, and hallooing to the dogs, that by a       kindred instinct entered tumultuously into the sport and       kept up the confusion. It was difficult to decide the       contest. So the money was thrown into the air, and as it       fell to ground, there was another rush, in which the hero of       the trowsers succeeded in getting the small coin from the       ground in his teeth, somewhat to the prejudice of his       finery.    [Illustration: DRILLING THE NEGRO BOYS.]         \"Rip asserts a special pre-eminence over these young serfs,       and has drilled them into a kind of local militia. He       sometimes has them all marshalled in the yard, and       entertains us with a review. They have an old watering-pot       for a drum, and a dingy pocket handkerchief for a standard,       under which they are arrayed in military order, and parade       over the grounds with a riotous clamor.\"    [Illustration: TREADING OUT WHEAT.]    The farmers of Virginia are scarcely as far advanced in the  application of science as the more active-minded Yankees, and among  the ancient customs which still obtain among them is that of treading  out grain with cattle. At Swallow Barn the operation is described:         \"Within the farm-yard a party of negroes were engaged in       treading out grain. About a dozen horses were kept at full       trot around a circle of some ten or fifteen paces diameter,       which was strewed with wheat in the sheaf. These were       managed by some five or six little blacks, who rode like       monkey caricaturists of the games of the circus, and who       mingled with the labors of the place that comic air of       deviltry which communicated to the whole employment       something of the complexion of a pastime.\"    We hope this edition of _Swallow Barn_ will be so well received that  the author will give us all his other works in the same attractive  style. _Horse-shoe Robinson_, _Rob of the Bowl_, _Quodlibet_, and all  the rest, except the _Life of Wirt_, are now out of print, and all  have been greeted on their first appearance with an approval that  should satisfy a more ambitious writer than Mr. Kennedy.    [Illustration]          GEORGE H. BOKER.    [Illustration]      Mr. Boker is one of the youngest of American authors. He is a native  of Philadelphia, and was born, we believe, in the year 1824. After the  usual preparatory studies in the city of his birth, he entered the  college at Princeton, New Jersey, of which he is a graduate. In  addition to the collegiate course, however, he devoted much time to  the study of Anglo-Saxon, and to the perusal of the early masters of  English literature, whose influence is discernible in all his earlier  poems. Soon after leaving college he made a visit to France and  England, but was obliged to return after having been but a short time  abroad, owing to the critical state of his health. He was at that time  suffering under a pulmonary disease which threatened to be fatal, but  all symptoms of which, fortunately, have since disappeared. On his  return he took up his residence in Philadelphia, which continues to be  his home. Three or four years since he was married to an accomplished  lady of that city.    Mr. Boker first appeared as an author at the commencement of the year  1848, when a volume of his poems, under the title of _The Lesson of  Life_, was published in Philadelphia. The publication of a volume was  no light ordeal to a young poet whose name was unknown, and who, we  believe, had never before seen himself in print. The lack of  self-observation and self-criticism, which can only be acquired when  the author's thoughts have taken the matter-of-fact garb of type,  would of itself be sufficient to obscure much real promise. In spite  of these disadvantages, the book contained much that gave the reader  the impression of a mind of genuine and original power. We remember  being puzzled at its seeming incongruity, the bold, mature, and  masculine character of its thought being so strikingly at variance  with its frequent crudities of expression. It seemed to us the work of  a man in the prime of life, whose poetic feeling had taken a sudden  growth, and moved somewhat unskilfully in the unaccustomed trammels of  words, rather than the first essay of a brain glowing with the fresh  inspiration of youth.    No one saw the author's imperfections sooner than himself; and before  the year had closed, his tragedy of _Calaynos_ was published--a work  so far in advance of what he had hitherto accomplished, so full, not  only of promise for the future, but of actual performance, that it  took his most confident friends by surprise. To write a five act  tragedy is also a bold undertaking; but there is an old French proverb  which, says, \"if you would shoot lions, don't begin by aiming at  hares,\" and we believe there are fewer failures from attempting too  much than from being content with too little. The success of  _Calaynos_ showed that the author had not aimed beyond his reach. The  book attracted considerable attention, and its merits as a vigorous  and original play, were very generally recognized. Although written  with no view to its representation on the stage, it did not escape the  notice of actors and managers, and a copy happening to fall into the  hands of Mr. Phelps, a distinguished English tragedian, it was first  performed under his direction at the Theatre Royal, Saddler's Wells,  Mr. Phelps himself taking the part of Calaynos. Its success as an  acting play was most decided, and after keeping the stage at Saddler's  Wells twenty or thirty nights, it went the round of the provinces. It  has already been performed more than a hundred times in different  parts of Great Britain.    _Calaynos_ gives evidence of true dramatic genius. The characters are  distinct and clearly drawn, and their individualities carefully  preserved through all the movements of the plot, which is natural and  naturally developed. The passion on which the action hinges, is the  prejudice of blood between the Spanish and Moorish families of Spain.  The interest of the plot, while it never loses sight of the hero, is  shared in the first three acts by the other personages of the story,  but concentrates at the close on Calaynos, whose outbursts of love and  grief and revenge are drawn with striking power and eloquence. The  play is enlivened with many humorous passages, wherein the author  shows his mastery of this element, so necessary to the complete  dramatist.    Mr. Boker's next publication was the tragedy of _Anne Boleyn_, which  appeared in February, 1850. In this work he touched on more familiar  ground, and in some instances, in his treatment of historical  characters, came in conflict with the opinions or prejudices of the  critics. The necessity of adhering to history in the arrangement of  the plot and selection of the dramatis personae, imposed some restraint  on the author's mind, and hence, while _Anne Boleyn_ exhibits a calmer  and more secure strength, and a riper artistic knowledge than  _Calaynos_, it lacks the fire and passionate fervor of some passages  of the latter. We should not forget, however, that the Thames has a  colder and sadder sun than the Guadalquiver. Objections have been made  to Mr. Boker's King Henry, especially to his complaint of the torments  of his conscience, and his moralizing over Norris's ingratitude. But  those who cavil at these points seem to forget that however vile and  heartless King Henry appears to them, he is a very different man to  himself. The author's idea--and it is true to human nature--evidently  is, that a criminal is not always guilty to his own mind. This marked  insensibility of King Henry to his own false and corrupt nature is a  subtle stroke of art.    The language of the tragedy is strong, terse, and full of point,  approaching the sturdy Saxon idiom of the early English dramatists. We  might quote many passages in support of our opinion, as, for instance,  the scene between the Queen and her brother, Lord Rochford; between  the Queen and King Henry; Wyatt and Rochford, and King Henry and Jane  Seymour. Two or three brief extracts we cannot avoid giving. Wyatt and  Rochford are in \"The Safety,\" the thieves' quarter of London--the St.  Giles of that day. Wyatt speaks:        \"I oft have thought the watchful eye of God      Upon this place ne'er rested; or that hell      Had raised so black a smoke of densest sin      That the All-Beautiful, appalled, shrunk back      From its fierce ugliness. I tell you, friend,      When the great "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36496"],[0,"On the cattle plague: or, Contagious typhus in horned cattle. Its history, (#4)"],[1,"  ox which had been imported from Hungary, that constant focus of typhus,  displayed the most deadly form of the cattle disease, in the Venetian  territory, although no alteration in the air or waters had been observed  in Italy, and the seasons had been regular and the pastures abundant.  The contagion spread into Piedmont, where it carried of 70,000 head of  cattle; thence it extended to France and Holland, each of which  countries lost 200,000 of these animals. The trade in hides introduced  the distemper into England, where it proved no less fatal. It was the  same in the other countries of Europe.    In this disease, the intestines of the affected cattle were, as in the  present epizootia, inflamed, and strewed over with livid spots and  ulcerations, and the blood, though apparently fluid in the body of the  animal, _coagulated directly after it had issued from the vein_.    Herment thence concludes, that this epizootia is nothing more than an  inflammation of the blood. Lancisi advised his contemporaries to put to  death without pity every animal which was affected or seemed to be  affected with the disease; and it was in England that this spirited  resolve was first acted upon.    The three counties of Middlesex, Essex, and Surrey arrested the course  of this contagion in less than three months, by adopting this measure;  whilst in the rest of the stricken counties of Great Britain, and  likewise in Holland, where this decisive course was not taken at all,  the disease prevailed among the cattle for several years. Since that  time, it has been insisted on by some authors, that the barbarous  process of general extermination offers the most effectual remedy which,  in our present state of ignorance and improvidence, we could have  recourse to, in order to check the diffusion and the duration of this  fell disease.    The learned Goelicke describes an epizootia which was witnessed in 1730,  at Frankfort-on-the-Oder. His narrative, written with a masterly hand,  might very properly be applied to the disease which we are now  considering; and the treatment recommended by this earnest and vigilant  observer is so wisely deduced from the symptoms, that even in the  present day we might take that treatment as a model.    We could have borrowed much more largely from this source of  biographical researches had we not deemed that these quotations would be  sufficient for the purpose we had in view in this work. But from these  authorities we think it may justly be concluded, that infectious and  contagious diseases among horned cattle have frequently appeared from  the remotest times down to the middle of the eighteenth century.    All these attacks of epizootia were a frequent and severe cause of  suffering and misery among animals and men; but the ravages which they  left behind them were of slight importance each time, if we compare them  with those attending the epizootia which towards the year 1746 affected  the animal kingdom. This dreadful scourge lasted ten years, and swept  away nearly the whole race of horned cattle throughout Europe. It was  closely studied and thoroughly understood in its causes, its symptoms,  and its treatment by the scientific authors of that day, and those  writers, more judicious than we, did not designate the malady by the  title of PLAGUE. This particular visitation deserves to fix our  attention in an especial manner, not only on account of its striking  resemblance to the disease which now makes us all so anxious, but  because it induced two English physicians, Malcolm Flemming and Peter  Layard, to write on this disease two accounts or statements which are  equal, if not superior, to all the volumes which have since appeared on  the subject of the Cattle Disease. There is no help for it, and our  pride must bend itself to the acknowledgment: these two men, our seniors  by a century, were men of quite another stamp. Their expositions,  enriched with quotations from the Greek and Latin authors, abounding in  facts, ingenious insights and inferences, are far superior in merit to  the multitude of voluminous works which have been written and published  since then. It would be easy to prove that these two sagacious inquirers  far better understood than we have done the real nature of this cattle  disease, and that we must be grateful to them for first opening the way  which all of us must take in order to discover the preventive and  curative means of which we are still ignorant.    Let us observe, in passing, that these two physicians, who appear to  have been scarcely known, enlightened by the effects of the inoculation  of small-pox, then practised from man to man, appear to have first  conceived the idea, now practised in Russia, of preventing the  propagation of the contagious cattle disease by means of inoculation;  and we may raise the interest of this remark by reminding the reader  that their experiments to inoculate cattle were made in 1757, eight  years after the very year which gave birth to the future inoculation of  man with animal virus by the celebrated Jenner. By this it would appear  that the twofold honour of applying the method of inoculation as both  preventive and curative means in respect of contagion in cattle, and as  the preventive means by the variola of the cow to resist the ravages of  the small-pox in man, is the indisputable claim of English  physicians.[A]      III.    Very little is known of the origin or first outbreak of the epizootia  which produced such fearful ravages in the middle of the eighteenth  century. Some suppose that it first appeared in Tartary, where it  occasioned a disorder twice as extensive in its pernicious effects as  any similar distemper which had been known up to that time. Thence it  passed into Russia, from which it spread on one side into Poland,  Livonia, Prussia, Pomerania, and Holland, and from that country into  England; on the other side towards the East, it invaded the Turkish  Empire, Bohemia, Hungary, Dalmatia, Austria, Moravia, Styria, the Gulf  of Venice, Italy, Spain, Portugal, France, the banks of the Rhine, and  Denmark.    But another opinion has assigned Bohemia as the source from which this  destructive epizootia took its rise, and its supporters allege that  during the siege of Prague the cattle feeding in its plains had been  deprived of their usual fodder by the continual _razzias_ of the French  to supply their own cavalry.    Be this as it may, this virulent cattle disease having at length  assumed the proportions of a public calamity, the several governments  were obliged to take it into serious consideration, and the medical  faculties and most celebrated physicians began to make it the subject of  their studies and reports. In France, therefore, the professors of the  faculty of Paris and Montpellier, suspending every other pursuit,  devoted their most assiduous care and attention to dumb animals.    Sauvages, the Dean of the Faculty at Montpellier, drew up a most  philosophical and learned account of the prevailing disease, in which,  like Stahl, he forgot probably for a moment the part which, in the  progress of distempers, he ascribes to the soul.    The professors of Paris, very famous in their day, but who, having left  behind them no works so valuable as the \"Nosologia\" of Sauvages, are now  completely forgotten, likewise addressed the result of their inquiries  and lucubrations to the King.    Doctor Leclerc was sent into Holland, whence he brought back a Memorial,  which was a reflex of the opinions he found current in Denmark, and  which has been transmitted to us in the _Memorials of the Royal Society  of Science at Copenhagen_.    It is evident from the reflections found in the writings of Malcolm  Flemming, Layard, and other competent observers, that this formidable  epizootia was in its character identical with the one described by  Ramazzini and Lancisi in 1711; and we feel warranted in saying, after  having examined every work of any importance which has treated of that  visitation, that it resembles the disease now prevailing among cattle,  in its march, in its symptoms, and in its gravity. We believe that these  three visitations constitute but one and the same malady, occurring at  three different periods. This appears to us a most important fact, for  if such be the case, the tentative treatment of that time deserves our  most particular attention. Consequently, a few retrospective glances may  perhaps be permitted us, in considering the subject of cattle disease.    The medical professors (including several English physicians), who  observed and described the epizootia of 1745, divided the same into  three periods.    The duration of the disease, when it passed through all its phases up to  the death of the affected animal, consisting of from ten to twelve days,  they usually ascribed to each of these periods or stages an average  continuance of three or four days.    _1st Period._--After a few days of latent incubation, which the observer  could not suspect, the sick animal betrayed signs of the morbid state  which was about to declare itself, by his careless feeding, by drooping  his head, and by exhibiting the deepest dejection of spirits in his  attitude and look. Rumination, already imperfect, soon ceased  altogether, the appetite failed, the horns, ears, and hoofs were cold,  the hair grew stiff, the tongue and mucus looked white; the eyes were  tearful and fixed, the hearing obtuse, whilst, in the cows, the supply  of milk diminished. In cases of unusual gravity, transient shiverings  testified to a serious disturbance in all the animal functions. These  shiverings were followed by a violent fever, the blood became inflamed,  the breath hot, the respiration hurried and sometimes attended with  slight coughing; when, if too violent a repercussion was transmitted to  the nervous centres, the pressure on the vertebral line became  intolerable, and the animal, seized"]]]
