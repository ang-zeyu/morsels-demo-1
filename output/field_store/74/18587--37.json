He paused a moment. \"Listen!  Can you hear me? This is Phil Kramer. Can you hear me, Professor. Can  you hear me? I want you to release the controls.\"    There was silence.    \"This is Kramer, Professor. Can you hear me? Do you remember who I am?  Do you understand who this is?\"    Above the control panel the wall speaker made a sound, a sputtering  static. They looked up.    \"Can you hear me, Professor. This is Philip Kramer. I want you to give  the ship back to us. If you can hear me, release the controls! Let go,  Professor. Let go!\"    Static. A rushing sound, like the wind. They gazed at each other.  There was silence for a moment.    \"It's a waste of time,\" Gross said.    \"No--listen!\"    The sputter came again. Then, mixed with the sputter, almost lost in  it, a voice came, toneless, without inflection, a mechanical, lifeless  voice from the metal speaker in the wall, above their heads.    \"... Is it you, Philip? I can't make you out. Darkness.... Who's  there? With you....\"    \"It's me, Kramer.\" His fingers tightened against the microphone  handle. \"You must release the controls, Professor. We have to get back  to Terra. You must.\"    Silence. Then the faint, faltering voice came again, a little stronger  than before. \"Kramer. Everything so strange. I was right, though.  Consciousness result of thinking. Necessary result. Cognito ergo sum.  Retain conceptual ability. Can you hear me?\"    \"Yes, Professor--\"    \"I altered the wiring. Control. I was fairly certain.... I wonder if I  can do it. Try....\"    Suddenly the air-conditioning snapped into operation. It snapped  abruptly off again. Down the corridor a door slammed. Something  thudded. The men stood listening. Sounds came from all sides of them,  switches shutting, opening. The lights blinked off; they were in  darkness. The lights came back on, and at the same time the heating  coils dimmed and faded.    \"Good God!\" Winter said.    Water poured down on them, the emergency fire-fighting system. There  was a screaming rush of air. One of the escape hatches had slid back,  and the air was roaring frantically out into space.    The hatch banged closed. The ship subsided into silence. The heating  coils glowed into life. As suddenly as it had begun the weird  exhibition ceased.    \"I can do--everything,\" the dry, toneless voice came from the wall  speaker. \"It is all controlled. Kramer, I wish to talk to you. I've  been--been thinking. I haven't seen you in many years. A lot to  discuss. You've changed, boy. We have much to discuss. Your wife--\"    The Pilot grabbed Kramer's arm. \"There's a ship standing off our bow.  Look.\"           *       *       *       *       *    They ran to the port. A slender pale craft was moving along with them,  keeping pace with them. It was signal-blinking.    \"A Terran pursuit ship,\" the Pilot said. \"Let's jump. They'll pick us  up. Suits--\"    He ran to a supply cupboard and turned the handle. The door opened and  he pulled the suits out onto the floor.    \"Hurry,\" Gross said. A panic seized them. They dressed frantically,  pulling the heavy garments over them. Winter staggered to the escape  hatch and stood by it, waiting for the others. They joined him, one by  one.    \"Let's go!\" Gross said. \"Open the hatch.\"    Winter tugged at the hatch. \"Help me.\"    They grabbed hold, tugging together. Nothing happened. The hatch  refused to budge.    \"Get a crowbar,\" the Pilot said.    \"Hasn't anyone got a blaster?\" Gross looked frantically around. \"Damn  it, blast it open!\"    \"Pull,\" Kramer grated. \"Pull together.\"    \"Are you at the hatch?\" the toneless voice came, drifting and eddying  through the corridors of the ship. They looked up, staring around  them. \"I sense something nearby, outside. A ship? You are leaving, all  of you? Kramer, you are leaving, too? Very unfortunate. I had hoped we  could talk. Perhaps at some other time you might be induced to  remain.\"    \"Open the hatch!\" Kramer said, staring up at the impersonal walls of  the ship. \"For God's sake, open it!\"    There was silence, an endless pause. Then, very slowly, the hatch slid  back. The air screamed out, rushing past them into space.    One by one they leaped, one after the other, propelled away by the  repulsive material of the suits. A few minutes later they were being  hauled aboard the pursuit ship. As the last one of them was lifted  through the port, their own ship pointed itself suddenly upward and  shot off at tremendous speed. It disappeared.    Kramer removed his helmet, gasping. Two sailors held onto him and  began to wrap him in blankets. Gross sipped a mug of coffee,  shivering.    \"It's gone,\" Kramer murmured.    \"I'll have an alarm sent out,\" Gross said.    \"What's happened to your ship?\" a sailor asked curiously. \"It sure  took off in a hurry. Who's on it?\"    \"We'll have to have it destroyed,\" Gross went on, his face grim. \"It's  got to be destroyed. There's no telling what it--what _he_ has in  mind.\" Gross sat down weakly on a metal bench. \"What a close call for  us. We were so damn trusting.\"    \"What could he be planning,\" Kramer said, half to himself. \"It doesn't  make sense. I don't get it.\"           *       *       *       *       *    As the ship sped back toward the moon base they sat around the table  in the dining room, sipping hot coffee and thinking, not saying very  much.    \"Look here,\" Gross said at last. \"What kind of man was Professor  Thomas? What do you remember about him?\"    Kramer put his coffee mug down. \"It was ten years ago. I don't  remember much. It's vague.\"    He let his mind run back over the years. He and Dolores had been at  Hunt College together, in physics and the life sciences. The College  was small and set back away from the momentum of modern life. He had  gone there because it was his home town, and his father had gone there  before him.    Professor Thomas had been at the College a long time, as long as  anyone could remember. He was a strange old man, keeping to himself  most of the time. There were many things that he disapproved of, but  he seldom said what they were.    \"Do you recall anything that might help us?\" Gross asked. \"Anything  that would give us a clue as to what he might have in mind?\"    Kramer nodded slowly. \"I remember one thing....\"    One day he and the Professor had been sitting together in the school  chapel, talking leisurely.    \"Well, you'll be out of school, soon,\" the Professor had said. \"What  are you going to do?\"    \"Do? Work at one of the Government Research Projects, I suppose.\"    \"And eventually? What's your ultimate goal?\"    Kramer had smiled. \"The question is unscientific. It presupposes such  things as ultimate ends.\"    \"Suppose instead along these lines, then: What if there were no war  and no Government Research Projects? What would you do, then?\"    \"I don't know. But how can I imagine a hypothetical situation like  that? There's been war as long as I can remember. We're geared for  war. I don't know what I'd do. I suppose I'd adjust, get used to it.\"    The Professor had stared at him. \"Oh, you do think you'd get  accustomed to it, eh? Well, I'm glad of that. And you think you could  find something to do?\"    Gross listened intently. \"What do you infer from this, Kramer?\"    \"Not much. Except that he was against war.\"    \"We're all against war,\" Gross pointed out.    \"True. But he was withdrawn, set apart. He lived very simply, cooking  his own meals. His wife died many years ago. He was born in Europe, in  Italy. He changed his name when he came to the United States. He used  to read Dante and Milton. He even had a Bible.\"    \"Very anachronistic, don't you think?\"    \"Yes, he lived quite a lot in the past. He found an old phonograph and  records, and he listened to the old music. You saw his house, how  old-fashioned it was.\"    \"Did he have a file?\" Winter asked Gross.    \"With Security? No, none at all. As far as we could tell he never  engaged in political work, never joined anything or even seemed to  have strong political convictions.\"    \"No,\" Kramer, agreed. \"About all he ever did was walk through the  hills. He liked nature.\"    \"Nature can be of great use to a scientist,\" Gross said. \"There  wouldn't be any science without it.\"    \"Kramer, what do you think his plan is, taking control of the ship and  disappearing?\" Winter said.    \"Maybe the transfer made him insane,\" the Pilot said. \"Maybe there's  no plan, nothing rational at all.\"    \"But he had the ship rewired, and he had made sure that he would  retain consciousness and memory before he even agreed to the  operation. He must have had something planned from the start. But  what?\"    \"Perhaps he just wanted to stay alive longer,\" Kramer said. \"He was  old and about to die. Or--\"    \"Or what?\"    \"Nothing.\" Kramer stood up. \"I think as soon as we get to the moon  base I'll make a vidcall to earth. I want to talk to somebody about  this.\"    \"Who's that?\" Gross asked.    \"Dolores. Maybe she remembers something.\"    \"That's a good idea,\" Gross said.           *       *       *       *       *    \"Where are you calling from?\" Dolores asked, when he succeeded in  reaching her.    \"From the moon base.\"    \"All kinds of rumors are running around. Why didn't the ship come  back? What happened?\"    \"I'm afraid he ran off with it.\"    \"He?\"    \"The Old Man. Professor Thomas.\" Kramer explained what had happened.    Dolores listened intently. \"How strange. And you think he planned it  all in advance, from the start?\"    \"I'm certain. He asked for the plans of construction and the  theoretical diagrams at once.\"    \"But why? What for?\"    \"I don't know. Look, Dolores. What do you remember about him? Is there  anything that might give a clue to all this?\"    \"Like what?\"    \"I don't know. That's the trouble.\"    On the vidscreen Dolores knitted her brow. \"I remember he raised  chickens in his back yard, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32530"],[0,"Armageddon—2419 A.D. (#4)"],[1,"been  successful in dodging them for some two hours before the shooting began,  at the moment when I arrived on the scene.    \"But we must not stay here talking,\" Wilma concluded. \"I have to take  you in, and besides I must report this attack right away. I think we had  better slip over to the other side of the mountain. Whoever is on that  post will have a phone, and I can make a direct report. But you'll have  to have a belt. Mine alone won't help much against our combined weights,  and there's little to be gained by jumping heavy. It's almost as bad as  walking.\"    After a little search, we found one of the men I had killed, who had  floated down among the trees some distance away and whose belt was not  badly damaged. In detaching it from his body, it nearly got away from me  and shot up in the air. Wilma caught it, however, and though it  reinforced the lift of her own belt so that she had to hook her knee  around a branch to hold herself down, she saved it. I climbed the tree  and, with my weight added to hers, we floated down easily.          CHAPTER III    Life in the 25th Century      We were delayed in starting for quite a while since I had to acquire a  few crude ideas about the technique of using these belts. I had been  sitting down, for instance, with the belt strapped about me, enjoying an  ease similar to that of a comfortable armchair; when I stood up with a  natural exertion of muscular effort, I shot ten feet into the air, with  a wild instinctive thrashing of arms and legs that amused Wilma greatly.    But after some practice, I began to get the trick of gauging muscular  effort to a minimum of vertical and a maximum of horizontal. The correct  form, I found, was in a measure comparable to that of skating. I found,  also, that in forest work particularly the arms and hands could be used  to great advantage in swinging along from branch to branch, so  prolonging leaps almost indefinitely at times.    In going up the side of the mountain, I found that my 20th Century  muscles did have an advantage, in spite of lack of skill with the belt,  and since the slopes were very sharp, and most of our leaps were upward,  I could have distanced Wilma easily. But when we crossed the ridge and  descended, she outstripped me with her superior technique. Choosing the  steepest slopes, she would crouch in the top of a tree, and propel  herself outward, literally diving until, with the loss of horizontal  momentum, she would assume a more upright position and float downward.  In this manner she would sometimes cover as much as a quarter of a mile  in a single leap, while I leaped and scrambled clumsily behind,  thoroughly enjoying the novel sensation.    Half way down the mountain, we saw another green-clad figure leap out  above the tree tops toward us. The three of us perched on an outcropping  of rock from which a view for many miles around could be had, while  Wilma hastily explained her adventure and my presence to her fellow  guard; whose name was Alan. I learned later that this was the modern  form of Helen.    \"You want to report by phone then, don't you?\" Alan took a compact  packet about six inches square from a holster attached to her belt and  handed it to Wilma.    So far as I could see, it had no special receiver for the ear. Wilma  merely threw back a lid, as though she were opening a book, and began to  talk. The voice that came back from the machine was as audible as her  own.    She was queried closely as to the attack upon her, and at considerable  length as to myself, and I could tell from the tone of that voice that  its owner was not prepared to take me at my face value as readily as  Wilma had. For that matter, neither was the other girl. I could realize  it from the suspicious glances she threw my way, when she thought my  attention was elsewhere, and the manner in which her hand hovered  constantly near her gun holster.    Wilma was ordered to bring me in at once, and informed that another  scout would take her place on the other side of the mountain. So she  closed down the lid of the phone and handed it back to Alan, who seemed  relieved to see us departing over the tree tops in the direction of the  camps.    We had covered perhaps ten miles, in what still seemed to me a  surprisingly easy fashion, when Wilma explained, that from here on we  would have to keep to the ground. We were nearing the camps, she said,  and there was always the possibility that some small Han scoutship,  invisible high in the sky, might catch sight of us through a  projectoscope and thus find the general location of the camps.    Wilma took me to the Scout office, which proved to be a small building  of irregular shape, conforming to the trees around it, and substantially  constructed of green sheet-like material.    I was received by the assistant Scout Boss, who reported my arrival at  once to the historical office, and to officials he called the Psycho  Boss and the History Boss, who came in a few minutes later. The attitude  of all three men was at first polite but skeptical, and Wilma's ardent  advocacy seemed to amuse them secretly.    For the next two hours I talked, explained and answered questions. I had  to explain, in detail, the manner of my life in the 20th Century and my  understanding of customs, habits, business, science and the history of  that period, and about developments in the centuries that had elapsed.  Had I been in a classroom, I would have come through the examination  with a very poor mark, for I was unable to give any answer to fully half  of their questions. But before long I realized that the majority of  these questions were designed as traps. Objects, of whose purpose I knew  nothing, were casually handed to me, and I was watched keenly as I  handled them.    In the end I could see both amazement and belief begin to show in the  faces of my inquisitors, and at last the Historical and Psycho Bosses  agreed openly that they could find no flaw in my story or reactions, and  that unbelievable as it seemed, my story must be accepted as genuine.    They took me at once to Big Boss Hart. He was a portly man with a \"poker  face.\" He would probably have been the successful politician even in the  20th Century.    They gave him a brief outline of my story and a report of their  examination of me. He made no comment other than to nod his acceptance  of it. Then he turned to me.    \"How does it feel?\" he asked. \"Do we look funny to you?\"    \"A bit strange,\" I admitted. \"But I'm beginning to lose that dazed  feeling, though I can see I have an awful lot to learn.\"    \"Maybe we can learn some things from you, too,\" he said. \"So you fought  in the First World War. Do you know, we have very little left in the way  of records of the details of that war, that is, the precise conditions  under which it was fought, and the tactics employed. We forgot many  things during the Han terror, and--well, I think you might have a lot of  ideas worth thinking over for our raid masters. By the way, now that  you're here, and can't go back to your own century, so to speak, what do  you want to do? You're welcome to become one of us. Or perhaps you'd  just like to visit with us for a while, and then look around among the  other gangs. Maybe you'd like some of the others better. Don't make up  your mind now. We'll put you down as an exchange for a while. Let's see.  You and Bill Hearn ought to get along well together. He's Camp Boss of  Number 34 when he isn't acting as Raid Boss or Scout Boss. There's a  vacancy in his camp. Stay with him and think things over as long as you  want to. As soon as you make up your mind to anything, let me know.\"    We all shook hands, for that was one custom that had not died out in  five hundred years, and I set out with Bill Hearn.    Bill, like all the others, was clad in green. He was a big man. That is,  he was about my own height, five feet eleven. This was considerably  above the average now, for the race had lost something in stature, it  seemed, through the vicissitudes of five centuries. Most of the women  were a bit below five feet, and the men only a trifle above this height.    For a period of two weeks Bill was to confine himself to camp duties, so  I had a good chance to familiarize myself with the community life. It  was not easy. There were so many marvels to absorb. I never ceased to  wonder at the strange combination of rustic social life and feverish  industrial activity. At least, it was strange to me. For in my  experience, industrial development meant crowded cities, tenements,  paved streets, profusion of vehicles, noise, hurrying men and women with  strained or dull faces, vast structures and ornate public works.    Here, however, was rustic simplicity, apparently isolated families and  groups, living in the heart of the forest, with a quarter of a mile or  more between households, a total absence of crowds, no means of  conveyance other than the belts called jumpers, almost constantly worn  by everybody, and an occasional rocket ship, used only for longer  journeys, and underground plants or factories that were to my mind more  like laboratories and engine rooms; many of them were excavations as  deep as mines, with well finished, lighted and comfortable interiors.  These people were adepts at camouflage against air observation. Not only  would their activity have been unsuspected by an airship passing over  the center of the community, but even by an enemy who might happen to  drop through the screen of the upper branches to the floor of the  forest. The camps, or household structures, were all irregular in shape  and of colors that blended with the great trees among which they were  hidden.    There were 724 dwellings or \"camps\" among the Wyomings, located within  an area of about fifteen square miles. The total population was 8,688,  every man, woman and child, whether member or \"exchange,\" being listed.    The plants were widely"]]]
