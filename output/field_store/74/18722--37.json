The _Musimon_, inhabiting Corsica, Sardinia, and other  islands of the Mediterranean, the mountainous parts of Spain and Greece,  and some other regions bordering upon that inland sea. These have been  frequently domesticated and mixed with the long-cultivated breeds.    2. The _Argali_ ranges over the steppes, or inland plains of Central  Asia, northward and eastward to the ocean. They are larger and hardier  than the Musimon and not so easily tamed.    3. The _Rocky Mountain Sheep_--frequently called the _Bighorn_ by our  western hunters--is found on the prairies west of the Mississippi, and  throughout the wild, mountainous regions extending through California  and Oregon to the Pacific. They are larger than the Argali--which in  other respects they resemble--and are probably descended from them,  since they could easily cross upon the ice at Behring's Straits, from  the north-eastern coast of Asia. Like the Argali, when caught young  they are readily tamed; but it is not known that they have ever been  bred with the domestic sheep. Before the country was overrun by the  white ram, they probably inhabited the region bordering on the  Mississippi. Father Hennepin--a French Jesuit, who wrote some two  hundred years ago--often speaks of meeting with goats in his travels  through the territory which is now embraced by Illinois, Wisconsin, and  a portion of Minnesota. The wild, clambering propensities of these  animals--occupying, as they do, the giddy heights far beyond the reach  of the traveller--and their outer coating of hair--supplied underneath,  however, with a thick coating of soft wool--give them much the  appearance of goats. In summer they are generally found single; but when  they descend from their isolated, rocky heights in winter, they are  gregarious, marching in flocks under the guidance of leaders.    [Illustration: ROCKY MOUNTAIN SHEEP.]    4. The _Bearded Sheep of Africa_ inhabit the mountains of Barbary and  Egypt. They are covered with a soft, reddish hair, and have a mane  hanging below the neck, and large, locks of hair at the ankle.    Many varieties of the domesticated sheep--that is, all the subjugated  species--apparently differ less from their wild namesakes than from each  other.    The _fat-rumped_ and the _broad-tailed sheep_ are much more extensively  diffused than any other, and occupy nearly all the south-eastern part of  Europe, Western and Central Asia, and Northern Africa. They are  supposed, from various passages in the Pentateuch in which \"the fat and  the rump\" are spoken of in connection with offerings, to be the  varieties which were propagated by the patriarchs and their descendants,  the Jewish race. They certainly give indisputable evidence of remote and  continued subjugation. Their long, pendent, drowsy ears, and the highly  artificial posterior developments, are characteristic of no wild or  recently domesticated race.    This breed consists of numerous sub-varieties, differing in all their  characteristics of size, fleece, color, etc., with quite as many and  marked shades of distinction as the modern European varieties. In  Madagascar, they are covered with hair; in the south of Africa, with  coarse wool; in the Levant, and along the Mediterranean, the wool is  comparatively fine; and from that of the fat-rumped sheep of Thibet the  exquisite Cashmere shawls of commerce are manufactured. Both rams and  ewes are sometimes bred with horns, and sometimes without, and they  exhibit a great diversity of color. Some yield a carcass of scarcely  thirty pounds, while others have weighed two hundred pounds dressed. The  tail or rump varies greatly, according to the purity and style of  breeding; some are less than one-eighth, while others exceed one-third  of the entire dressed weight. The fat of the rump or tail is esteemed a  great delicacy; in hot climates resembling oil, and in colder, suet.    It is doubtful whether sheep are indigenous to Great Britain; but they  are mentioned as existing there at very early periods.      AMERICAN SHEEP.    In North America, there are none, strictly speaking, except the Rocky  Mountain breed, already mentioned. The broad-tailed sheep of Asia and  Africa were brought into the United States about seventy years ago,  under the name of the Tunisian Mountain sheep, and bred with the native  flocks. Some of them were subsequently distributed among the farmers of  Pennsylvania, and their mixed descendants were highly prized as  prolific, and good nurses, coming early to maturity, attaining large  weight, of a superior quality of carcass, and yielding a heavy fleece of  excellent wool. The principal objection made to them was the difficulty  of propagation, which always required the assistance of the shepherd.  The lambs were dropped white, red, tawny, bluish, or black; but all,  excepting the black, grew white as they approached maturity, retaining  some spots of the original color on the cheeks and legs, and sometimes  having the entire head tawny or black. The few which descended from the  original importations have become blended with American flocks, and have  long ceased to be distinguishable from them. The common sheep of Holland  were early imported by the Dutch emigrants, who originally colonized New  York; but they, in like manner, have long since ceased to exist as a  distinct variety.    Improved European breeds have been so largely introduced during the  present century, that the United States at present possesses every known  breed which could be of particular benefit to its husbandry. By the  census of 1860, there were nearly twenty-three and a half millions of  sheep in this country, yielding upwards of sixty and a half million  pounds of wool. An almost infinite variety of crosses have taken place  between the Spanish, English, and \"native\" families; carried, indeed, to  such an extent that there are, comparatively speaking, few flocks in the  United States that preserve entire the distinctive characteristics of  any one breed, or that can lay claim to unmixed purity of blood.    The principal breeds in the United States are the so-called \"Natives;\"  the Spanish and Saxon Merinos, introduced from the countries whose names  they bear: the New Leicester, or Bakewell; the South-Down; the Cotswold;  the Cheviot; and the Lincoln--all from England.      NATIVE SHEEP.    This name is popularly applied to the common coarse-woolled sheep of the  country, which existed here previously to the importation of the  improved breeds. These were of foreign and mostly of English origin, and  could probably claim a common descent from no one stock. The early  settlers, emigrating from different sections of the British Empire, and  a portion of them from other parts of Europe, brought with them, in all  probability, each the favorite breed of his own immediate neighborhood,  and the admixture of these formed the mongrel family now under  consideration. Amid the perils of war and the incursions of beasts of  prey, they were carefully preserved. As early as 1676, New England was  spoken of as \"abounding with sheep.\"    These common sheep yielded a wool suitable only for the coarsest  fabrics, averaging, in the hands of good farmers, from three to three  and a half pounds of wool to the fleece. They were slow in arriving at  maturity, compared with the improved English breeds, and yielded, when  fully grown, from ten to fourteen pounds of a middling quality of mutton  to the quarter. They were usually long-legged, light in the  fore-quarter, and narrow on the breast and back; although some rare  instances might be found of flocks with the short legs, and some  approximation to the general form of the improved breeds. They were  excellent breeders, often rearing, almost entirely destitute of care,  and without shelter, one hundred per cent. of lambs; and in small  flocks, a still larger proportion. These, too, were usually dropped in  March, or the earlier part of April. Restless in their disposition,  their impatience of restraint almost equalled that of the untamed  Argali, from which they were descended; and in many sections of the  country it was common to see from twenty to fifty of them roving, with  little regard to enclosures, over the possessions of their owner and his  neighbors, leaving a large portion of their wool adhering to bushes and  thorns, and the remainder placed nearly beyond the possibility of  carding, by the tory-weed and burdock, so common on new lands.    To this general character of the native flocks, there was but one  exception--a considerably numerous and probably accidental variety,  known as the _Otter breed_, or _Creepers_. These were excessively  duck-legged, with well-formed bodies, full chests, broad backs, yielding  a close, heavy fleece, of medium quality of wool. They were deserved  favorites where indifferent stone or wood fences existed, since their  power of locomotion was absolutely limited to their enclosures, if  protected by a fence not less than two feet high. The quality of their  mutton equalled, while their aptitude to fatten was decidedly superior  to, their longer-legged contemporaries. The race is now quite extinct.    An excellent variety, called the Arlington sheep, was produced by  General Washington, from a cross of a Persian ram upon the Bakewell,  which bore wool fourteen inches in length, soft, silky, and admirably  suited to combing. These, likewise, have long since become incorporated  with the other flocks of the country.    The old common stock of sheep, as a distinct family, have nearly or  quite disappeared, owing to universal crossing, to a greater or less  extent, with the foreign breeds of later introduction. The first and  second cross with the Merino resulted in a decided improvement, and  produced a variety exceedingly valuable for the farmer who rears wool  solely for domestic purposes. The fleeces are of uneven fineness, being"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/39235"],[0,"A Manual of Toy Dogs: How to breed, rear, and feed them (#4)"],[1,"basket. Some folks, whose  lower regions do not answer this description, or whose servants are not  amenable, may have an occupied stable at command, where the puppies can  have a loose box or stall. This plan I do _not_ recommend, for toy pups  do far better in constant human companionship; but it, or the  alternative one of keeping them in a room with an oilcloth floor, are  all that offer themselves, failing the desirable kitchen. I have known  toy pups do splendidly in a sunny little room, floored with cork carpet,  provided with cosy sleeping boxes, and opening into a terrace-walk,  where on all fine and sunny days they were allowed to play; but they  were not too much left to themselves, and their apartment was carefully  looked after, and brush and sawdust-pan kept going, just as, in my  kitchen, the servants hasten to remove any unbecoming traces of their  presence. This period, while toy pups are too young to be trained, too  old for their mother to clean them up, and also so young as to require  warmth and constant watching, is the troublesome one in their lives and  the one in which so many of them die. Neglect, or dirty surroundings,  are fatal to these little delicate atoms, which really call for the same  attention we should give a baby; monotony--being kept shut up in one  small room for hours or days--and lack of fresh air, carry off many;  while sour milk, meals left about in odds and ends, irregular feeding,  and lying to sleep in draughts, are all elements of danger. We want to  give them warmth and dryness, without stuffiness and overheating; we  want to give them sweet, tempting, _clean_ little meals, regularly, four  times a day, just as much as they can eat eagerly and no more; we want  to give them a cosy day-bed to go to sleep whenever they feel  inclined--which will be often--and, lastly, to let them have all the  fresh air and out-of-door sunshine they can get without fear of chill.  Thus it is that summer puppies, born in the spring, with all the best  weather before them, do so much better than those which have the  critical teething period to pass through in winter time.    A toy puppy grows more quickly than, for instance, a terrier, and, of  course, is adult far sooner than a big dog; the short-haired varieties,  again, coming to maturity sooner than the long-coated ones. A Yorkshire  terrier is adult at a year, but does not get his full beauty of coat  until he is two years old, or thereabouts. A toy Schipperke is, so to  speak, grown-up at ten or eleven months, but goes on thickening and  improving in shape, and probably increasing and hardening in coat for  another year at least. A Pom's jacket gets grander at each moult until  he is three years old. As a general rule it may be laid down that the  dog is a puppy no longer at ten months, when his teething is almost  always entirely completed. This same teething is a tiresome process,  comprising the change of the first set of wee ivories for the permanent  forty-two which are to carry the owner through life. Nearly every puppy  suffers more or less in the process, some from fits, some from skin  irritation, some from colds in the head and eyes, some from general  feverishness; but the troubles are ephemeral, and generally subside  between whiles, returning as each big tooth is cut. What makes the worst  trouble is when the first teeth are severally not shed, but remain _in  situ_, a second tooth forcing itself up at one side of the lingering  intruder. This condition is pretty sure to mean teething fits, of which  more anon. Dentition begins about the fourth month, and once safely  over, the dog may be considered well reared.    Illustration: POMERANIAN PUPPY. _At the ugly age._    Distemper, that is, the two diseases usually so described, are a  bugbear, but it is enough to say that no puppy ought to have them. If he  does, it is because some one has allowed him to get the contagion, by  accident or carelessness; left to himself, he could not indulge in it,  for it is not, cannot be, spontaneous.    Small skin troubles, such as puppy pox, in which the skin in the under  parts of the body is red, and small pustules form and suppurate, after  the manner of chicken pox--though puppy pox is not catching--often  affect the strongest puppies; and a pup which \"teethes with a rash\" is  generally thought by breeders to be one which, if in the way of  contagion, will not take \"distemper\" very badly, if at all, though  whether there is any foundation for this opinion I cannot undertake to  say. Personally, my puppies never have distemper, simply because they  never have a chance; but where other dogs from the house are going to  and fro to shows they are almost certain, sooner or later, to bring it  home to the babies. Some day we shall have a crusade for stamping these  horrible diseases out, or discover prophylactics, no doubt; at present  they must be looked upon as ill-luck which _may_ never come our way. The  training of puppies to the house is a task which is most easily  accomplished by bringing them in from the kitchens, or wherever they  live in a general way, to some sitting-room for a short time daily, and  by degrees teaching them that each offence is instantly followed by  dismissal to the garden, or out of doors. Beating little dogs is useless  and unkind, but a mild scolding may be given and the infant be carried  out by the scruff of its neck. The great thing is to make this sequel  invariable, as dogs have a great sense of justice, and soon learn that  they have done wrong in this case; whereas, if they are allowed to do a  thing three times and beaten for it on the fourth occasion they quite  fail to understand the reason of the rebuke.    Some breeds of toys are much easier to teach than others; personally, I  have found Poms comparatively difficult dogs to train to the house, and  black-and-tan terriers are seldom altogether reliable; while fawn pugs  are generally averse to going out of doors in wet or very cold weather;  but patience and perseverance will do it in almost all cases. On the  other hand, some little dogs take to the house at once, and give no  trouble at all from the very first. A dog just off a journey, or strange  to a place, is not generally well-behaved just at first, so that the  buyer of a puppy, warranted trained, ought to give it a little law  before deciding that its education is not properly complete. I am  sometimes asked if there is not some magical preparation which cures  dogs of untidy habits, but am compelled to own that, in the present  state of our knowledge, such a thing not only does not exist, but does  not seem likely to be discovered! Small puppies, under three or five  months, are physically incapable of resisting any impulse, therefore it  is quite useless to attempt to train them too soon. Comparison between  the sexes in this matter is sometimes made; some preferring males as  house dogs, and others females. I fancy there is not the least  difference, and certainly, given a promising and intelligent individual,  a little boy pup is as easy to teach manners to as a little girl, and  _per contra_. Much depends upon character; here and there we find some  toy dogs which have mean, cringing spirits, and these are generally the  ones which won't go out in rain. They may be vulgarly described as  \"sneaks,\" and I would not keep a dog of this description. Mere timidity  is a different thing altogether, and can be eradicated by kindness and  judicious petting. The \"sneak\" is no companion, and should not be bred  from. It will not follow well out of doors, is seldom a good mother, and  is apt to transmit its faults of disposition to its offspring.          CHAPTER V    ON FEEDING TOYS      In feeding toys, variety is essential, and it is also desirable to give  them food which will nourish and support the constitution without  fattening them unduly, or heating the blood. It is far better to give a  toy a very small dinner, as far as bulk is concerned, of roast meat cut  up; or a little boiled mutton and rice; or a bit of cutlet minced, than  to give a much larger dinner of rice and biscuit flooded with milk or  soup. Big, sloppy meals are most undesirable, and the last meal at  night, above all, should be dry. Half a penny sponge cake makes an  excellent supper for a toy dog, or a couple of Osborne biscuits. Toy  dogs should never be given any biscuit containing oatmeal or Indian corn  meal, or peameal. These two are much used in dog-biscuit making, on  account of their cheapness, and they are both too heating for toy dogs,  and, in quantity, indigestible, although oatmeal is occasionally  valuable, as in the form of groats, to be made into milk gruel and given  to bitches after confinement. Rice, well boiled, is used as a staple, to  give bulk to meals, by all breeders of Yorkshire terriers, and it is a  valuable food, for this purpose, for it does not fatten, and is as  easily digested as any cereal can be. Although I advocate small, dry  meals as against large, sloppy ones, I do not mean to say that a certain  amount of bulk is not desirable--it is, for without it there would not  be the natural stimulus of distension to the intestinal canal. But  although the dog has a very large gullet and can swallow, and wishes to  swallow, very large quantities as compared to its size, its stomach is  not so very large in proportion, and the _juste milieu_--enough and not  too much--is easy to ascertain. Eating between meals is quite as bad for  dogs as for babies. They should be fed regularly, and restrained from  picking up bits out of doors--which may be poisoned, and are sure to be  unwholesome. Many dogs have a shocking habit of scavenging, which often  means that they are anaemic and harbour worms; if a tonic and worm dose  does not mend matters, a muzzle will.
