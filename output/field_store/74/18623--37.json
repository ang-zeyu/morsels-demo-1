Use your own  judgment. Of course you will sometimes find it is not necessary to go  to all this bother. For instance, sometimes you will find a natural  hanger for your trap. Then you don't have to have the long peg or  pole to hold it stiff.      [Illustration: MARTEN TRAP TRIGGERS.]    This trap is used heavy enough by some \"long line\" trappers for  wolverine. They blacken bait and cover as shown in  No. 4. In the two  small illustrations the triggers are shown in No. 1 separate and in  No. 2 set. A is the bait and trip stick, B the lever, C is the  upright. B in No. 1 is where the bait should be.      [Illustration: ANOTHER MARTEN DEADFALL.]    In No. 3 A is bait, E is pin which fastens deadfall to under pole and  prevents deadfall from turning to one side. F is post to keep under  pole from bending.    In No. 4 HH are nails which fasten down a springy piece of wood to  keep cover over bait. Cover with fir or spruce boughs.      * * *    Another deadfall much used by marten trappers is constructed by  cutting a notch in a tree about a foot in diameter, altho the size of  the tree makes little difference. The notch should be four inches  deep and a foot up and down and as high up as the trapper can  cut--four or five feet.    Only one pole is needed for this trap as the bottom of the notch cut  answers for the bed or bottom piece. (See illustration.) The pole for  the fall should be four inches or more in diameter and anywhere from  six to ten feet in length, depending upon the place selected to set.    The end fartherest from the bait or notched tree must be as high as  the notch. This can be done by driving a forked stake into the ground  or by tying that end of the pole to a small tree if there is one  growing at the right place.      [Illustration: HIGH BUILT MARTEN DEADFALL.]    If the pole for the fall is larger than the notch is deep, the end  must be flattened so that it will work easy in the notch, as a piece  of wood has been nailed over the notch to hold the fall pole in  place.    The triggers used are generally the figure 4 and set with bait  pointing as shown. There is no place for the marten to stand while  eating bait, only in shelf, and of course when the spindle is pulled,  down comes the pole killing the animal.      [Illustration: TREE DEADFALL.]    This shelf protects the bait and bed piece and the snow does not fill  in between and require so much attention as the one first described.    This deadfall may also be built on a stump with a small enclosure or  pen and the two-piece trigger used. Most trappers place the bait or  long trigger on bottom pole, when trapping for marten. It will be  readily seen that a marten, to get the bait, will stand between the  \"fall\" and bed or under pole and of course is caught while trying to  get the bait.      [Illustration: MORE MARTEN TRAP TRIGGERS.]    The height that deadfalls for marten should be built depends upon how  deep the snow gets. In the fall and early winter they can be built on  the ground or logs and other fur-bearers are taken as well.    A few inches of snow will not interfere with the workings of  deadfalls on the ground, but deep snows will. To make catches the  trapper must clean out under the fall pole each round. This is no  small task. The trapper is always on the lookout for suitable places  to construct Marten deadfalls.    When the snows get several feet deep, and the trapper makes his  rounds on snowshoes, the deadfalls constructed several feet above the  ground are the ones that make the catches.        CHAPTER V.    STONE DEADFALLS.    The stone deadfall here described is used by trappers wherever flat  stones can be found and is a good trap to catch skunk, opossum, mink  and other small game in. The trap is made as follows:    The figure 4 trigger is best for this trap and is made after this  manner: standard (1) is made by cutting a stick five or six inches  long out of hard wood and whittling it to a flat point, but blunt at  one end; (2) is about five inches long with a notch cut within about  one and one-half inches of the end with the other end made square so  that it will fit in (3) which is the bait stick. This is only a  straight stick sixteen or eighteen inches long, while the other end  of the stick should have a small prong on it, a tack driven in, or  something to hold the bait in position. The best way will be to tie  the bait on also.      [Illustration: FLAT STONE TRAP.]    After you have found a flat stone weighing from 50 to 100 pounds,  depending upon what game you expect to trap, select the place for the  trap, first place a small flat stone underneath so that your game  will be killed quicker and also so that the upright trigger will not  sink into the ground. Lift up the large, or upper stone, kneeling on  one knee before the stone resting the weight of the stone on the  other. This leaves both hands free to set the trap. This is done by  placing the triggers in the position shown in illustration and then  letting the stone down very easily on the triggers. You should keep  your knee under the stone all the time until you see that it comes  down easily and does not \"go off\" of its own weight. The bait should  always be put on before the trap is set. This trap will go off easy  and you must be careful that the bait you put on is not too heavy and  will cause the trap to fall of its own accord.    This trap can be made to catch rabbits which will come in handy to  bait other traps for larger game. In trapping for rabbits bait with  apples, cabbage, etc.    This trap does not take long to make, as no pen need be built, the  top stone is large enough to strike the animal, making no difference  in what position it gets when after the bait. A stone two or three  inches thick and say thirty inches across and the same length or a  little longer is about the proper size for skunk, opossum, etc., but  of course larger or smaller stones can be used--whatever you find  convenient.      * * *    This trap consists of a flat piece of stone supported by three fits  of wood, the whole trouble being in making these three fits right,  and this can be done by carefully comparing the description here  given with illustrations, whenever they are referred to. The parts  are all made of wood about three-eighths of an inch thick. Fig. 1 is  thirteen inches long, with notches about one-sixteenth of an inch  deep cut in its upper side, two of the notches near together and at  one end, and another four and a half inches from the first two. The  latter notch should be cut a little sloping across the stick.      [Illustration: STONE DEADFALL TRIGGERS.]    Figure 1 represents a top view and the piece next below it is a side  view of the piece of wood as it should be made, and end fartherest  from the notches being trimmed to a point to hold the bait. This  constitutes the trigger.    The lever is shown in Fig. 2, the cut above giving a side view and  that below it a bottom view of this part of the trap. The piece of  wood needed for it is six and one-half inches long, one inch wide at  one end, and tapering down to three-sixteenths of an inch at the  other; a notch is cut across the under side one and a half inches  from the wide end. Level off the upper side of the narrow end to  about one-half the original thickness. If the flat stone to be used  is a heavy one, the notch must not be more than 1 inch from the end;  otherwise the leverage on the notches would be greater than is  desirable, tending to hold the parts together too rigidly.    The upright post, Fig. 3, is seven inches long, slightly forked at  the bottom (to make it stand firm and prevent twisting round when in  use), the upper end beveled from the front backwards at an angle of  about 45 degrees. The front of the upright is the side that would  face a person standing exactly opposite the trap when set.    On the right side cut a long notch, half the width of the wood in  depth, commencing the hollow slope of the notch one inch from the  lower end and making the square shoulder just three inches from the  bottom of the post; level the shoulder off from the front so as to  leave only a narrow edge. Place the post upright, (see Fig. 4) it's  forked end standing on a small piece of wood or flat stone, to  prevent it from sinking into the ground; bait the pointed end of the  trigger and hold it up horizontally with its middle notch, catching  behind the shoulder of the notch in the upright post; then place the  beveled end of the lever in the notch at the end of trigger, the  notch in the lever laying on the edge of the top of the upright post.    Lastly, make the stone rest on the top of the lever, arranging the  stone so that the bait will be near the lower end of the stone.    It is a good plan to hollow out the ground somewhat under where the  stone falls, to allow a space for the pieces of the Fig. 4 to lay  without danger of being broken. The bait, also, should be something  that will flatten easily and not hard enough to tilt the stone up  after it has fallen.    The trouble with most deadfalls usually set, is in the weight of  stone. When you get one heavy enough it will not trip easy when game  takes hold, and oftentimes break head piece where the head takes hold  of standard. The head piece from stone down to where standard sets in  notch should be fully 2 1/4 inches, so when stone starts to fall it  throws triggers out from under; otherwise, stone will catch and break  them.      [Illustration: THE INVITATION--SKUNK.]    Young trappers when you are making triggers preparatory for your  sets, tie each pair together separately as they are finished, then  when you are ready to set there are no misfits. Now we are up to the  bait stick. It should under no condition, be more than 9 inches long,  and oftentimes shorter will answer better. A"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34131"],[0,"Butterflies and Moths (British) (#4)"],[1,"of vision (the _optic_ nerve). Hence the eye is  often spoken of as _compound_.    If you look closely into the eyes of various butterflies and moths you  will generally see a ground colour of grey, blue, brown, or black; but  when viewed at certain angles in a strong light the most gorgeous hues  of metallic brilliancy--gold, copper, and bronze--are to be observed.  All such colours are due to the reflection of light from the colouring  matter that lies between the numerous conical compartments.    [Illustration: FIG. 4.--SECTION OF THE EYE OF AN INSECT.]    A glance at the section of a compound eye will show you that all the  little cones radiate from a common centre. And, as each little  compartment is surrounded by opaque colouring matter, it is clear that  perpendicular rays only are capable of penetrating to its base and  exciting the nerve fibre that lies there. Thus each little division of a  compound eye forms its own image of the object that happens to be  exactly opposite its facet. But how many facets do we find in a single  eye? Sometimes only a few hundreds, but sometimes as many as seventeen  or eighteen thousand! We must not, however, conclude that the nature of  the vision of butterflies and moths is necessarily very different from  our own. We have two eyes, but the images formed by them are both  blended, so that we do not see double. We can understand, therefore,  that the thousands of images formed in a single eye may be blended  together so as to form one continuous picture. Still there remains this  difference: while in our own case the two images formed by the two eyes  are practically the same, in the case of insects every one of the little  conical tubes of a compound eye forms an image of an object that cannot  possibly be formed by any one of the others. Thus, if the lepidopterous  insect sees a continuous picture of its surroundings, such a picture is  produced by the overlapping and blending, at their edges, of hundreds or  thousands of distinct parts.    There is yet another interesting difference between the vision of these  insects and that of ourselves. As already stated, our two eyes are both  turned toward the same point at the same time. But look at the  butterfly's eyes. Here are no movable eyeballs, and the two eyes, placed  as they are at the _sides_ of the head, are always turned in _opposite_  directions. The corneae, too, are very convex; and consequently the range  of vision is vastly wider than ours. A boy is often easily surprised by  a playmate who approaches him stealthily from behind, but did you ever  try the same game with a butterfly? I have, many a time. After getting  cautiously so near to a butterfly at rest as to be able to distinguish  between its head and its hinder extremity, I have quietly circled round  it so as to approach it from behind, being at the time under the  impression that it wouldn't see me under those circumstances. But not  the slightest advantage did I derive from this stratagem, for the  position and construction of its eyes enabled it to see almost all ways  at once.    In addition to the two compound eyes, the _Lepidoptera_, or at least  most of them, are provided with two small simple eyes; but these are  generally so hidden among the closely set hair that covers the head,  that it is doubtful whether they are of much service as organs of  vision.    [Illustration: FIG. 5.--ANTENNAE OF BUTTERFLIES.]    [Illustration: FIG. 6.--ANTENNAE OF MOTHS.]    The antennae proceed from two points close to the upper borders of the  eyes. They are jointed organs, and are of very different forms in the  various species of _Lepidoptera_. They are generally long, slender, and  clubbed at the extremity in butterflies, but exhibit several minor  points of difference which we shall have to note later on. In moths the  antennae are sometimes long, slender, and pointed. Some are thick, and  more or less prismatic in form; while others are slightly or deeply  pectinated or comb-like. The antennae of butterflies are always  straight, or only slightly curved; and, although the insects can sway  them bodily, they have no power to bend them, or to stow them away in  any place of shelter. Moths, on the other hand, when at rest, are almost  invariably found to have their antennae snugly tucked under the wings,  and brought so closely against the side of the head for this purpose  that even the uncovered portion is often difficult to find.    There are two other prominent appendages belonging to the heads of the  _Lepidoptera_. These are the _labial palpi_ or feelers of the lips. They  are generally easily seen, projecting forward on the under side of the  head, sometimes so long and conspicuous as to give one the idea of a  snout or long nose. The palpi are jointed--usually in three parts--are  covered with scales, and often furnished with hairs or bristles.    If you watch a moth or butterfly when it is feeding on the sweet juices  of a flower, or on some kind of artificial sweet with which you have  provided it, you will observe its long trunk or _proboscis_, by which  food is sucked up. This instrument is so long and slender that it seems  almost impossible that it can be a tube through which a liquid freely  passes. But a careful examination will show that this is the case. It is  composed of two separate pieces--two half tubes, which, when closely  applied to each other, form a very thin and flexible pipe, perfectly  air-tight and adapted for suction. Sometimes you can see a butterfly or  moth manipulating with its proboscis as if it required readjustment in  some way or other. It has split the tube throughout its length, so that  it now looks like two exceedingly fine hairs. Then, after a short time,  the two halves are put together again, and immediately, as if by magic,  become a single tube in which no kind of seam is to be observed without  a powerful magnifier.    In order to observe the nature of such a wonderful arrangement we must  have recourse to the aid of a good microscope. Thus assisted, we can see  at once how the junction of the two sides of the proboscis is brought  about so quickly and so perfectly. The inner edges of each half are very  regularly fringed with lines of closely set hairs--so regular, in fact,  are they, that they give one the idea of long yet minute beautifully  formed combs. When the two parts are brought together, the hairs of two  opposite edges interlock, those on one side exactly filling the spaces  between those of the other.    The microscope also reveals another interesting fact, viz. that the  proboscis is not a single tube, but, although so remarkably thin, is  really a set of three distinct pipes, one lying on each side of the  central one. It is said that the central tube only is used for sucking  up the liquid food, and there seems to be some doubt as to the uses of  the other two. Some naturalists are of opinion that the latter are air  tubes, and are connected with the respiration of the insect; while  others say that through these the insects eject a thin watery fluid with  which to dissolve or dilute those sweetmeats that are not sufficiently  liquid to be readily sucked up. But possibly both these opinions are  correct, the proboscis serving all three of the purposes here named. The  only observation of my own bearing on the subject is this. While a moth  was feeding on a drop of syrup in a strong light, a powerful lens  revealed drops, of liquid, mingled with bubbles of air, passing  alternately _up and down_ the two lateral tubes of the proboscis. At the  same time the upward current of syrup in the central tube was by no  means steady and continuous.    [Illustration: FIG. 7.--SECTION OF THE PROBOSCIS OF A BUTTERFLY.]    When this organ is not in use, it is beautifully coiled into a close  spiral which lies between the labial palpi. The length varies  considerably in different insects, and consequently the number of turns  in the spiral must differ also. Sometimes there are less than two turns,  while some of the longer ones form spirals of from six to ten turns.    In concluding our brief account of the head of lepidopterous insects it  is, I suppose, hardly necessary to add that there is no kind of chewing  apparatus to be described; all the members of this order, at least in  the perfect state, deriving the whole of the little nourishment they  require entirely by suction through the proboscis or 'trunk.'    The second division of the body is the _thorax_. This is much larger  than the head, and consists of three ring-like segments, joined one  behind the other so intimately that the lines of junction are hardly  visible, even after the thick clothing of fine hair has been brushed  off. Behind the thorax is the abdomen, which is composed of several  segments, the junctions between the rings often being most distinct.    From the sides of the thorax proceed the two pairs of wings, the general  structure of which we have already to a certain extent examined. But  when we are a little farther advanced in our insect studies, we shall  have to become acquainted with detailed descriptions given as aids to  the identification of species. Now, such descriptions cannot be  satisfactory, either to the one who gives or to him who receives, unless  expressed in such definite terms as render a misunderstanding  impossible. A botanist cannot give an accurate and concise description  of a flower without the use of certain names and expressions which have  gradually become an almost necessary part of his vocabulary; neither can  an entomologist give a really useful, and, at the same time, a  _succinct_ description of an insect unless he is acquainted with the  names of its parts. Therefore, seeing that we distinguish the various  species of butterflies and moths _mainly_ by the arrangement and colour  of the markings of their wings, it is really necessary that we should  know the names of the different parts"]]]
