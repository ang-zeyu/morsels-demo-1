The French government stipulates in its contracts for  rails, that flaws shall be planed, drilled, or filed out; that the  rails shall not be allowed to drop on the ground, but shall be carried  by men and slid down. The Lyons railroad does not pay for its rails  until 15,000 trains have passed over them.    By imperfect mechanical composition is meant imperfect union of the  parts of rails. Steel heads are welded to the rest of the rail in a  variety of ways, and this welding is necessarily imperfect. A number  of sections of rails etched with acid plainly showed this want of  homogeneity, as did likewise prints taken from the etched surfaces.  Before such rails have lost weight appreciably, they are used up by  the constant rolling they undergo. The advantage of a steel rail is  its homogeneity, but a good iron rail, such as those made under the  direction of the speaker, for the Reading Railroad Company, is likely  to prove better than one of poor steel. The life of a steel rail  is chiefly affected by the temperature at which it is rolled and  annealed. It ought not to wear off more than 1 mm. for 20,000,000  tons of traffic, and is usually calculated to wear 10 mm. before it is  taken up. In other words, it would last about 20 years on roads doing  as much business as the New York Central. It is, however, unlikely  that our steel rails will stand more than half this amount of traffic.    The effects of chemical composition are but little understood. Some  of the purest irons have turned out utterly worthless. Apparently the  absolute quantities of carbon, silicon, aluminum, phosphorus, etc.,  present are not of so much importance as their relative proportion.  One specimen containing carbon 0.16, silicon 0.08, and phosphorus  0.012, could be bent double when cold, while another, containing  carbon 0.58, silicon 0.56, and phosphorus 0.011 broke at once.    The physical tests for tensile and torsional strength, usually made on  a portion cut out of the head of the rail, are not sufficient, because  the flaws before spoken of exist mostly in the flange of the rail, and  fracture usually begins there.    The effect of cold rolling and shocks that a rail is exposed to was  shown by a piece of rail made by the Campbells, Sheffield, Eng., which  had been worn 3 mm. by a traffic of 60,000,000 tons at Spuyten Duyvel.  The head had been somewhat flattened, and the flange driven down into  the foot to a certain extent. Under such usage an iron rail would have  gone to pieces long ago.    Sometimes steel rails crumble all at once and pieces fall out of  the head. This is probably due to some physical defects or to  crystallization from shocks. The cause has not yet been definitely  ascertained.    Mr. Collingwood stated that of a rail only a section of 3/8 square  inch was pressed by the wheel of a locomotive, the effect being to  cause this portion to act like a wedge, and thus to contribute to the  disintegration of the rail. He also exhibited a hook which had been  used to hoist stones of 10 to 12 tons, and then suddenly broke with a  weight of only 61/2 tons. It had been worn from a thickness of 2 inches  to 1-7/8. The pressure at the upper surface crowded the particles and  caused them to act as wedges. Their fracture was crystalline, while  that of the lower surface, which parted more slowly, was fibrous.    Professor Egleston asserted that there was no such thing as fibrous  iron; what appeared so being simply crystalline with the ends  drawn out. A sharp blow would cause this to fall off and show the  crystalline structure beneath.    The discussion was continued by Professors Trowbridge, Egleston, and  Newberry.    C. F.

The following is an abstract of a paper on the Present and Future of  Sanitary Science in the United States, read by Professor Albert R.  Leeds, of the Stevens Institute of Technology, before the New York  Academy of Sciences at their meeting, November 11th, 1878:    Sciences, such as the one under consideration, that have in them a  side largely practical, are sure of a welcome in our midst. The study  of the laws of public health grew into prominence in this country  during the war, when the Sanitary Commission undertook to supervise  the camps and hospitals. Sanitary associations were then formed  in many States and smaller communities, and these have led to the  establishment of State and city boards of health, clothed to a greater  or less degree with executive functions. Every epidemic has been the  cause of wider dissemination of sanitary knowledge by the daily press.  The yellow fever plague, by which more than twelve thousand people  have perished, has thoroughly aroused public interest. During its  continuance the papers were full of homilies on private and public  hygiene, the people everywhere sent aid and sympathy to the afflicted,  and a lady offered to defray the expenses of a scientific commission  of sanitary experts to inquire into the cause and prevention of the  scourge. The proper execution of sanitary laws depends on the free  and intelligent co-operation of individuals much more than on the  influence of a strong central authority. A general health department  at Washington could not legislate pure air, pure water, and pure  food into use throughout the nation. The people themselves, in each  community, must be educated to demand these requisites of health and  to secure them in their own way.    I. _Vital Statistics._--The first \"Bill of Mortality\" in New York city  extended from November 1st, 1801, to January 1st, 1803. In it people  are said to have died of \"flux,\" \"hives,\" \"putrid fever,\" \"breaking  out,\" \"stoppage,\" \"fits,\" of \"rash,\" and, by way of contrast,  of \"lingering illness.\" This rude beginning gradually led to the  organization of the Metropolitan Board of Health, whose first report  was made in 1866. Their second report showed a decrease of 3,152  deaths, mainly in districts where the greatest amount of sanitary work  had been done. Valuable illustrations of the relation between damp  houses and consumption were obtained by constructing maps of certain  wards, on which every death from phthisis for several years was noted  opposite each house. It was found that the disease was most fatal in  the lowest levels, in rainy seasons, and in crowded localities.    The registration of marriages continued so defective that a writer on  the subject declares it would be impossible for a large portion of  the adult native population of the United States to prove by any legal  document that they have a right to the name they bear, or that their  parents were ever married. The mortality returns of 1871 were probably  nearly perfect, and their very accuracy told against New York city,  whose death rate was 28.6 per thousand, while St. Louis reported 17,  Rochester 16, Buffalo 14, and Jersey City 7 per thousand. To secure  accuracy in the returns of marriages and births, etc., more stringent  legislation will be necessary.    In New Jersey the State Sanitary Association has conclusively  shown the utter worthlessness of the State vital statistics. They  memorialized the legislature, and caused the passage of a law which  gives to New Jersey one of the best systems of registration yet  devised. It owes its excellence to the following features, which  should be universally copied:    1. _Burial Permits_ are issued only after registry has been made by a  properly qualified person; and    2. The returns are made to an _expert_, who collates them and deduces  practical lessons from them.    II. _Registration of Disease_.--A large class of diseases may be  prevented from becoming epidemic if their existence is known in time.  For this purpose the boards of health should be invested with power  and provided with means to investigate, reform, and, if necessary,  to punish delinquency. Yet in the face of so practical a requirement  little more is annually appropriated for the Board of Health of New  Jersey than for the pay of two policemen.    III. _State Sanitary Legislation_.--The agitation for sanitary reform  caused by the yellow fever should not be allowed to die out with the  pressure of the calamity that aroused it. It should continue until  every State that has been the seat of yellow fever, year after year,  has as efficient a health code as Massachusetts and Michigan. The  necessity of educating the people before it is possible to secure  the requisite legislation will cause a considerable period of time  to elapse before all the States have laws in accordance with modern  knowledge. Probably no community takes the trouble to protect itself  until it has actually suffered. To the distress of London the world  owes the report of the Royal Commissions on water supply and the  pollution of rivers, still the best repertory of the best knowledge on  the subject. The manufactories of England have made it necessary for  the government to take cognizance of aerial impurities. Similarly in  this country the pollution of the Passaic has caused inquiries to be  set on foot in the same direction.

A heavy local rain fell during the evening, and was followed by or  attended with a sudden and great lowering of the temperature. A chilly  fog hung over the belt of country invaded by the disease, and a heavy  \"swampy\" odor and taste were in the air.    The malady reached its climax in about twenty-four hours. It was first  suspected that the water supply had been somehow poisoned, but many  people who had not used the water were prostrated, while others  who used it freely escaped. Adams has hitherto been regarded as an  exceptionally healthy town, and the surrounding country is high and  wholesome.           *       *       *       *       *          CANNONADING OF OIL TANKS.    On the morning of Friday, June 11, lightning struck an oil tank  belonging to the Tidioute and Titusville Pipe Line, at Titusville,  Pa. The fire thus kindled, raged until Sunday night, consuming 200,000  barrels of oil, crude and refined, and destroying property to the  amount of $1,500,000. The most appalling feature in this fire was the  successive \"boiling over\" of oil from burning tanks of the liquid.  To empty rapidly a tank containing 20,000 barrels of oil, while the  latter is on fire, is no easy matter. The pipes connected with the  tanks were utterly inadequate to remove the oil rapidly enough to rob  the \"boiling over\" of its terrors. A happy thought suggested itself  on Friday to Mr. D. R. Herron, of the Titusville Battery. Obtaining  permission, Mr. Herron brought out one of the Parrott guns of the  battery, loaded it with solid shot, and began firing against the  three-eighths iron sheets of the distant blazing tank. The first  shot glanced, but subsequent volleys pierced the shell of the tank,  releasing a large quantity of oil that otherwise would have fed the  flames. The battery then moved on to the Emery tank, also burning, and  lastly to the Acme tank. Large rents were made in all these, and the  liberated oil ran harmlessly down into a stream. This novel target  practice greatly shortened the duration of the fire at these tanks,  and so drained them that the flames died out for want of fuel, and no  \"boiling over\" resulted.    The peculiar attraction for lightning which these iron oil tanks  appear to possess has been several times referred to in our columns.  Whenever a thunderstorm passes fairly over one of them it seems to be  devoted to destruction. Millions of dollars' worth of property have  thus been destroyed. No practical safeguard has yet been suggested.    Ordinary buildings, when properly provided with rods that are  well grounded in the earth, are comparatively safe from lightning.  Structures made of iron and simply resting upon the earth, without  rods, are also exempt from electrical damage. Such structures always  present a continuous body of conducting material for the free passage  of electricity to earth. Why is it, then, that iron oil tanks form  such conspicuous exceptions to our common experience with lightning?  Rods put on other structures save them; but rods have been put on oil  tanks, masts with rods have surrounded the tanks, but the tanks were  exploded by lightning all the same.    We will repeat a possible explanation which we have heretofore given.  From every oil tank, according to our theory, there is a constant  escape of light hydrocarbon vapor, which forms a permanent cloud or  column, rising to a great height above the tanks, far above any  rod that could be erected. This vapor rod is a conductor, which the  lightning naturally follows, sets on fire the vapor, and explodes the  tank.    A column of heated air or vapor rising from a chimney is well known  to be a conductor for lightning; the rise of hydrocarbon vapors is  illustrated by the balloon.    If the theory we have outlined is correct, the remedy for the  electrical explosion of oil tanks is to be found in such a treatment  of the oil, or such a construction of tank, as shall prevent any  escape of the light vapors.           *       *       *       *       *          NAVIGATION IN FOGS.    The disastrous collision of the Sound steamers Narragansett and  Stonington was quickly followed by one at sea, by which two great  passenger ships escaped instant destruction almost by a hair's  breadth.    Shortly after noon, Monday, June 12, the National Line steamship  Queen, bound from London to New York, and within 300 miles of her  journey's end, ran into the Anchor Line steamship Anchoria, on the way  from New York to Glasgow. The bow of the Queen struck the Anchoria on  the port side, about twenty feet abaft the foremast, smashing a great  hole through the iron hull. Two compartments of the Anchoria filled  immediately, but the partitions stood firm, and the other compartments  sufficed to keep the vessel afloat. The bow of the Queen was badly  crushed, and her forward compartment was flooded. Fortunately the  bulkhead proved stanch, and the ship was saved. The fog was very  thick, and both ships were going at full speed. It is said that the  captain of the Anchoria mistook the whistle of the Queen for that of  the Anchoria's companion vessel, the Victoria, which left New York at  the same time, and was probably not far away, and before the error was  discovered the ships were too close to avoid the catastrophe. Had the  sea been rough or the partitions less stanch, both ships must have  gone to the bottom almost instantly.    The passengers of the Anchoria were transferred to the Queen, which  was least hurt, and the two ships sailed together for New York,  arriving Tuesday noon.    These two collisions, coming in such quick succession and imperiling  so many lives, give terrible emphasis to the dangers attending  navigation in foggy weather. They make very pertinent also the query  whether the means now employed for discovering the position  and nearness of unseen vessels are at all commensurate with the  necessities of the case, or with the means already known, and known  to be well calculated to prevent such dangers. In a dense fog the  ordinary ship's light is visible scarcely more than a ship's length;  and as it proved in the case of the Narragansett and Stonington, the  time between thus sighting an approaching vessel and the instant of  collision is fatally brief. The recent test of electric headlights  for ships in this harbor clearly demonstrated the possibility of  projecting a beam of electric light through the densest fog for a  thousand feet or more, and through ordinary fogs a distance several  times as great.    Except in very rough weather the steam whistle can be heard a long  distance, but it is liable to be a treacherous guide. It is not always  possible to determine by the ear alone the direction from which a  sound comes; and it would seem that a mistake of this nature was made  on the Stonington, since the order intended to change her course  away from that of the Narragansett only served to precipitate the  collision. Had the whistle of the Queen signaled her course it could  not have been mistaken for that of a ship sailing in the opposite  direction, and the safety of two great floating hotels and their  occupants would not have been imperiled thereby.    Means for the better penetration of fogs, for determining the  direction of unseen sources of sounds, and for enabling steamers to  announce to all within hearing the course they are pursuing, seem  therefore to be imperative necessities on shipboard. The first is  furnished by the electric headlight, with a system of projection  similar to but more efficient than that used on locomotives. The last  would be provided by an efficient code of whistle signals to indicate  the several points of compass. The second need is supplied by the  instrument figured in the accompanying illustration.    [Illustration: PROFESSOR MAYER'S TOPOPHONE.]    The aim of the topophone, which was invented and patented by Professor  A. M. Mayer, last winter, is to enable the user to determine quickly  and surely the exact direction and position of any source of sound.  Our figure shows a portable style of the instrument; for use  on ship-board it would probably form one of the fixtures of the  pilot-house or the \"bridge,\" or both. In most cases arising in sailing  through fogs, it would be enough for the captain or pilot to be  sure of the exact direction of a fog horn, whistling buoy, or steam  whistle; and for this a single aural observation suffices.    Every one has twirled a tuning fork before the ear, and listened to  the alternate swelling and sinking of the sound, as the sound waves  from one tine re-enforce or counteract those from the other tine. The  topophone is based upon the same fact, namely, the power of any sound  to augment or destroy another of the same pitch, when ranged so that  the sound waves of each act in unison with or in opposition to those  of the other.    Briefly described, the topophone consists of two resonators (or any  other sound receivers) attached to a connecting bar or shoulder rest.  The sound receivers are joined by flexible tubes, which unite for part  of their length, and from which ear tubes proceed. One tube, it will  be observed, carries a telescopic device by which its length can be  varied. When the two resonators face the direction whence a sound  comes, so as to receive simultaneously the same sonorous impulse, and  are joined by tubes of equal length, the sound waves received from  them will necessarily re-enforce each other and the sound will be  augmented. If, on the contrary, the resonators being in the same  position as regards the source of sound, the resonator tubes differ in  length by half the wave length of the sound, the impulse from the one  neutralizes that from the other, and the sound is obliterated.    Accordingly, in determining the direction of the source of any sound  with this instrument, the observer, guided by"]]]
