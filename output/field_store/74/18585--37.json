Nor did Jem return again till the  war was over. Then he came, and came with prize-money. He and Tom had  many talks of going into business together, with Tom's brains and Jem's  money. But nothing came of this. The land was no place for Jem. He was a  regular Norse man, as are almost all of the Tripp's Cove boys who have  come from the loins of the \"Fighting Twenty-seventh.\" They sniff the  tempest from afar off; and when they hear of Puget Sound, or of Alaska,  or of Wilkes's Antarctic Continent, they fancy that they hear a voice  from some long-lost home, from which they have strayed away. And so  Laura knew, and Tom knew, that any plans which rested on Jem's staying  ashore were plans which had one false element in them. The raven would  be calling him, and it might be best, once for all, to let him follow  the raven till the raven called no more.    So Jem put his prize-money into a new bark, which he found building at  Bath; and they called the bark the \"Laura,\" and Tom and Laura Cutts went  to the launching, and Jem superintended the rigging of her himself; and  then he took Tom and Laura and the babies with him to New York, and a  high time they had together there. Tom saw many of the old army boys,  and Laura hunted up one or two old school friends; and they saw Booth in  Iago, and screamed themselves hoarse at Niblo's, and heard Rudolphsen  and Johannsen in the German opera; they rode in the Park, and they  walked in the Park; they browsed in the Astor and went shopping at  Stewart's, and saw the people paint porcelain at Haighwout's; and, by  Mr. Alden's kindness, went through the wonders of Harper's. In short,  for three weeks, all of which time they lived on board ship, they saw  the lions of New York as children of the public do, for whom that great  city decks itself and prepares its wonders, albeit their existence is  hardly known to its inhabitants.    Meanwhile Jem had chartered the \"Laura\" for a voyage to San Francisco.  And so, before long, her cargo began to come on board; and she and Tom  and the babies took a mournful farewell, and came back to Tripp's Cove  again, to Moses Marvel's house. And poor Tom thought it looked smaller  than ever, and that he should find it harder than ever to settle down to  being of no use to anybody, and to eat Moses Marvel's bread,--without  house or barn, or bin or oven, or board or bed, even the meanest, of his  own. Poor Tom! and this was the reward of being the first man in Maine  to enter for three years!    And then things went worse and worse. Moses Marvel was as good and as  taciturn as ever. But Moses Marvel's affairs did not run as smoothly as  he liked. Moses held on, upon one year's cutting of lumber, perfectly  determined that lumber should rise, because it ought to; and Moses paid  very high usury on the money he borrowed, because he would hold on.  Moses was set in his way,--like other persons whom you and I know,--and  to this lumber he held and held, till finally the bank would not renew  his notes. No; and they would not discount a cent for him at Bangor, and  Moses came back from a long, taciturn journey he had started on in  search of money, without any money; and with only the certainty that if  he did not mean to have the sheriff sell his lumber, he must sell it for  himself. Nay! he must sell it before the fourth of the next month, and  for cash; and must sell at the very bottom of a long falling market!  Poor Moses Marvel! That operation served to show that he joined all the  Cutts want of luck with the Marvel obstinacy. It was a wretched  twelvemonth, the whole of it; and it made that household, and made Tom  Cutts, more miserable and more.    Then they became anxious about the \"Laura,\" and Jem. She made almost a  clipper voyage to California. She discharged her cargo in perfect order.  Jem made a capital charter for Australia and England, and knew that from  England it would be easy to get a voyage home. He sailed from  California, and then the letters stopped. No! Laura dear, no need in  reading every word of the ship-news in the \"Semi-weekly Advertiser;\" the  name of your namesake is not there. Eight, nine, ten months have gone  by, and there is no port in Christendom which has seen Jem's face, or  the Laura's private signal. Do not strain your eyes over the  \"Semi-weekly\" more.    No! dear Laura's eyes will be dimmed by other cares than the ship-news.  Tom's father, who had shared Tom's wretchedness, and would gladly have  had them at his home, but that Moses Marvel's was the larger and the  less peopled of the two,--Tom's father was brought home speechless one  day, by the men who found him where he had fallen on the road, his yoke  of oxen not far away, waiting for the voice which they were never to  hear again. Whether he had fallen from the cart, in some lurch it made,  and broken his spine, or whether all this distress had brought on of a  sudden a stroke of paralysis, so that he lost his consciousness before  he fell, I do not know. Nor do I see that it matters much, though the  chimney-corners of Tripp's Cove discuss the question quite eagerly to  this hour. He lay there month after month, really unconscious. He smiled  gently when they brought him food. He tried to say \"Thank you,\" they  thought, but he did not speak to the wife of his bosom, who had been the  Laura Marvel of her day, in any different way from that in which he  tried to speak to any stranger of them all. A living death he lay in as  those tedious months went by.    Yet my dear Laura was as cheerful, and hopeful, and buoyant as ever. Tom  Cutts himself was ashamed to brood when he got a sight of her. Mother  Cutts herself would lie down and rest herself when Laura came round,  with the two children, as she did every afternoon. Moses Marvel himself  was less taciturn when Laura put the boys, one at one side, one at the  other, of his chair, at the tea-table. And in both of those broken  households, from one end to the other, they knew the magic of dear  Laura's spells. So that when this Christmas came, after poor Mr. Cutts  had been lying senseless so long,--when dear Laura bade them all take  hold and fit up a Christmas-tree, with all the adornments, for the  little boys, and for the Spaulding children, and the Marvel cousins, and  the Hopkinses, and the Tredgolds, and the Newmarch children,--they all  obeyed her loyally, and without wondering. They obeyed her, with her own  determination that they would have one merry Christmas more. It seems a  strange thing to people who grew up outside of New England. But this was  the first Christmas tree ever seen at Tripp's Cove, for all such  festivities are of recent importation in such regions. But there was  something for every child. They heaped on more wood, and they kept a  merry Christmas despite the storm without. This was Laura's will, and  Laura had her way.    And she had her reward. Job Stiles came round to the door, when he had  put up his horses, and called Tom out, and gave him a letter which he  had brought from Ellsworth. And Tom read the letter, and he called Laura  to read it. And Laura left the children, and sat at the kitchen table  with him and read it, and said, \"Thank God! this is a Christmas present  indeed. Could any thing in this world be better?\"    This is the letter:--        JOHN WILDAIR TO TOM CUTTS.        DEAR TOM,--I am just back from Washington. I have seen them all,      and have done my best, and have failed. They say and I believe      that the collectorship was promised to Waters before the old      man's death,--that Waters had honest claims,--he has but one      leg, you know,--and that it must go to him. As for the      surveyorship, the gift of that is with Plumptre. And you know      that I might as well ask the Pope to give me any thing as he.      And if he hates anybody more than me, why it is your wife's      father. So I could do nothing there.        Let me say this, though it seems nothing. If, while we are      waiting to look round, you like to take the Bell and Hammer      Light-house, you may have the place to-morrow. Of course I know      it is exile in winter. But in summer it is lovely. You have your      house, your stores, two men under you (they are double lights),      and a thousand dollars. I have made them promise to give it to      no one till they hear from me. Though I know you ought not take      any such place, I would not refuse it till I let you know. I      send this to Ellsworth for the stage-driver to take, and you      must send your answer by special messenger, that I may telegraph      to Washington at once.        I am very sorry, dear Tom, to have failed you so. But I did my      best, you know. Merry Christmas to Laura and the babies.            Truly yours,              JOHN WILDAIR.        PORTLAND, Dec. 24, 1868.    That was Laura and Tom's Christmas present. An appointment as  light-house keeper, with a thousand a year!           *       *       *       *       *    BUT even if they had made Tom a turnpike keeper, they would not have  made Laura a misanthrope. He, poor fellow, gladly accepted the  appointment. She, sweet creature, as gladly accepted her part of it.  Early March saw them on the Bell and Hammer. April saw the early flowers  come,--and May saw Laura with both her babies on the beach, laughing at  them as they wet their feet,--digging holes in the sand for them,--and  sending the bigger boy to run and put salt upon the tails of the peeps  as they ran along the shore. And Tom Cutts, when his glass was clear to  his mind, and the reflectors polished to meet even his criticism, would  come down and hunt up Laura and the children. And when she had put the  babies to sleep, old Mipples, who was another of the descendants of the  \"Fighting Twenty-seventh,\" would say, \"Just you go out with the Major,  mum, and if they wake up and I can't still them, I'll blow the horn.\"  Not that he"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32472"],[0,"Food in War Time (#4)"],[1," living cells.    The total quantity of heat produced by the body is a measure of the  intensity of the oxidation of carbohydrate, fat, and protein within the  body.    It is important to know definitely whether there is any constant measure  of the level of the basal metabolism in normal people, so that one may  determine in cases of disease whether the heat production is normal or  increased or decreased.    Rubner discovered that the heat production of mammalia during rest was  the same per square meter of surface whether the being was a horse, a  man, a dog, or a mouse. The proposition has appeared so improbable as to  call forth much antagonism. DuBois deserves the credit of having  established this relationship for man beyond the possibility of a doubt.  He was able to do this on account of his discovery of a new and accurate  method of measuring the area of the body surface. It appears from his  work that the _basal metabolism_ for men between twenty and fifty years  old is approximately 40 calories per hour per square meter of body  surface, within a +/- error of 10 per cent.    Boothby has found that the metabolism of patients who have recovered  their health after hospital operations and who have been confined in the  hospital between twenty and fifty days does not vary from the normal  standard of DuBois.    It has been found by DuBois that the basal metabolism in boys of twelve  is 25 per cent. higher than for an adult of the same height and weight,  or {50} calories per square meter of body surface; and that in boys of  fifteen the metabolism is 11 per cent. higher than for the adult of the  same size and shape, or {44} calories per square meter of body surface  (unpublished work of DuBois). These results explain the large appetites  of boys.    Women show a metabolism which is 7 per cent. lower than that of men, or  {37} calories per hour per square meter of surface.    From the charts of the average heights and weights of men varying  between fifteen and fifty-five years old, given by American life  insurance companies, Mr. H. V. Atkinson, of my laboratory, has  calculated the basal metabolism in a table here presented.  Unfortunately, the weights given in these statistics include clothes  worn by the individuals. The calculated heat production, however, is in  each case based upon the weight without clothes. The table is computed  from the following values:                        Calories per                      square meter    Age in years       of surface      15                    44    20-50                 40    55                    37    The table may also be used as follows:       To find the metabolism of--       Women between twenty to fifty years, multiply values for man     by 0.93.       Boys of twelve to thirteen years, multiply values for boys of     fifteen years by 1.10.

This is the same as that of a man  twenty-five years old, weighing 126 pounds and 5 feet, 2 inches tall.    A boy thirteen years old and weighing 156 pounds, his height being 6  feet, 1 inch (there are such cases), would have a basal metabolism of  2300 calories, or larger than that of any grown man given in the  table--larger than a man weighing 211 pounds and 6 feet, 4 inches in  height. I personally know a boy of this age and size. His parents are  said to have sent him to boarding school in order to reduce their food  bills.    It is evident from this discussion that the food requirement of boys  over twelve years old is about the same as that of men. The emaciation  of the children of the poor probably reduces their requirement of food.  It is not generally recognized that the boy needs as much food as his  father. The requirements of girls have not been investigated, but they  probably need as much as their mothers.    These data will give with close scientific precision the _minimal  requirement for energy_ which is necessary for the maintenance of the  bed-ridden.    Ordinary life, however, is not constituted after this fashion. \"By the  sweat of thy brow shalt thou eat bread.\"    From the work of F. G. Benedict one may calculate the increase in the  basal metabolism, as follows:                                   Increase in                                  the basal                                  metabolism    Occupation                   in per cent.

Passing to a consideration of the subject of mechanical work done by a  man, one finds that it requires about 1.1 calories to transport a pound  of body weight three miles during an hour, and that increasing power  must be generated if the speed is increased above this rate of _maximal  economic velocity_.    These relations are shown below:                                 Extra calories                             per hour required                              to move 1 pound    Rate of movement              of body      Walking 3 miles per hour        1.1    Walking 5.3 miles per hour      3.6    Running 5.3 miles per hour      3.1    If one wishes to determine the heat production of a man weighing 156  pounds and 5 feet, 7 inches in height, and who is walking or running,  the following calculations can be made:      Rate of travel per hour in miles            3[3]  5.3[3]  5.3[4]                                               Cals.

If the man's food cost 10 cents a thousand calories, it may be  calculated that he would have to walk over eight miles at a rate of  three miles per hour in order to save money when he pays a 5-cent  carfare. (This, however, does not include the cost of shoe leather.)    The carrying of a load of 44 pounds is done at the same expenditure of  energy as the carrying of one's own body weight when the rate is three  miles an hour, so the soldier's equipment would call for the added  expenditure of 48 calories (44 x 1.1), making his total hourly  expenditure of energy nearly 300 calories (249 + 44) during a hike on a  level road. His daily requirement for energy might be:  "]]]
