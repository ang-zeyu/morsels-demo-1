Hark! they are going  to him; you must go too!\" She turned toward the window, swayed heavily,  and was caught in his arms.    It was a brief swoon, but when she opened her eyes and looked about her,  the sound of the flying wheels was dying away in the distance,  southward.    He had found the pail of pure spring water, and applied some of it to  her hands and temples with the quickness and ease of a woman, and he now  held a glass to her lips.    She drank feverishly, put a hand before her eyes, raised herself with an  effort, and seemed to struggle mutely for self-control. Then she turned  toward him.    \"I am Hilda Grant,\" she said, brokenly.    \"My brother's friend! My sister that is to be!\"    \"No, no; not now. Something has happened. You should have gone with  those men--with the doctor. They are going to bring him back.\"    \"Miss Grant, sister!\" His hands had closed firmly upon her wrists, and  his voice was firm. \"You must tell me the worst, quick. Don't seek to  spare me; think of him! What is it?\"    \"He--he went from home early, with his pistol, they say, to shoot at a  target. He is dead!\"    \"Dead! Charley dead! Quick! Where is he? I must see, I must. Oh! there  must be some horrible mistake.\"    He sprang toward the door, but she was before him.    \"Go this way. Here is his wheel. Take it. Go south--the lake shore--the  Indian Mound.\"    A moment later a young man with pallid face, set mouth and tragic eyes  was flying toward the Indian Mound upon a swift wheel, and in the  school-room, prone upon the floor, a girl lay in a death-like swoon.          CHAPTER III.    NEMESIS.      \"Mr. Brierly, are you strong enough to bear a second shock? I must  confer with you before--before we remove the body.\"    It was Doctor Barnes who thus addressed Robert Brierly, who, after the  first sight of the outstretched figure upon the lake shore, and the  first shock of horror and anguish, had turned away from the group  hovering about the doctor, as he knelt beside the dead, to face his  grief alone.    Doctor Barnes, besides being a skilled physician, possessed three other  qualities necessary to a successful career in medicine--he was prompt to  act, practical and humane.    Robert Brierly was leaning against a tall tree, his back toward that  group by the water's edge, and his face pressed against the tree's  rugged trunk. He lifted his head as the doctor spoke, and turned a  white, set face toward him. The look in his dark eyes was assurance  sufficient that he was ready to listen and still able to manfully endure  another blow.    The two men moved a few steps away, and then the doctor said:    \"I must be brief. You know, do you not, the theory, that of these men,  as to the cause of this calamity?\"    \"It was an accident, of course.\"    \"They make it that, or suicide.\"    \"Never! Impossible! My brother was a God-fearing man, a happy man.\"    \"Still, there is a bullet-hole just where self-inflicted wounds are  oftenest made.\"    Brierly groaned aloud. \"Still,\" he persisted, \"I will never believe it.\"    \"You need not.\" Doctor Barnes sank his voice to a yet lower pitch. \"Mr.  Brierly, there is a second bullet-wound in the back!\"    \"The back! And that means----\"    \"It means murder, without a doubt. No huntsman could so mistake his mark  in this open woodland, along the lake. Besides, hunting is not allowed  so near the village. Wait,\" as the young man was about to speak, \"we  have no time to discuss motives now, or the possible assassin. What I  wish to know is, do you want this fact known now--at once?\"    \"I--I fear I don't understand. Would you have my brother's name----\"    \"Stop, man! Knowing that these men have already jumped at a theory, the  thought occurred to me that the work of the officers might be made  easier if we let the theory of accident stand.\"    He broke off, looking keenly at the other. He was a good judge of faces,  and in that of Robert Brierly he had not been deceived.    The young man's form grew suddenly erect and tense, his eye keen and  resolute.    \"You are right!\" he said, with sudden energy, as he caught at the  other's hand. \"They must not be enlightened yet.\"    \"Then, the sooner we are back where we can guard this secret, the safer  it will be. Come. This is hard for you, Mr. Brierly, I know, and I could  say much. But words, no matter how sincerely sympathetic, cannot lighten  such a blow as this. I admire your strength, your fortitude, under such  a shock. Will you let me add that any service I can render as physician,  as man, or as friend, is yours for the asking?\"    The doctor hesitated a moment, then held out his hand, and the four  watchers beside the body exchanged quick glances of surprise upon seeing  the two men grasp hands, silently and with solemn faces, and then turn,  still silently, back to the place where the body lay.    \"Don't touch that pistol, Doran,\" the doctor spoke, in his capacity of  coroner.    \"Certainly not, Doc. I wanted to feel, if I could, whether those side  chambers had been discharged or not. You see,\" he added, rising to his  feet, \"when we saw this, we knew what we had to do, and it has been  'hands off.' We've only used our eyes so far forth.\"    \"And that I wish to do now with more calmness,\" said Robert Brierly,  coming close to the body and kneeling beside it.    It lay less than six feet from the very water's edge, the body of a  tall, slender young man, with a delicate, high-bred face that had been  fair when living, and was now marble-white, save for the blood-stains  upon the right temple, where the bullet had entered. The hair, of that  soft blonde colour, seen oftenest upon the heads of children, and rarely  upon adults, was thick and fine, and long enough to frame the handsome  face in close half rings that no barber's skill could ever subdue or  make straight. The hands were long, slender, and soft as a woman's; the  feet small and arched, and the form beneath the loose outlines of the  blue flannel fatigue suit in which it was clad, while slender and full  of grace, was well built and not lacking in muscle.    It lay as it had fallen, upon its side, and with one arm thrown out and  one limb, the left, drawn up. Not far from the outstretched right arm  and hand lay the pistol, a six-shooter, which the brother at once  recognised, with two of the six chambers empty, a fact which Mr. Doran  had just discovered, and was now holding in reserve.    The doctor, upon his discovery of the second bullet-wound, had at once  flung his own handkerchief over the prostrate head, and called for the  carriage robe from his own phaeton, which, fortunately for the wind and  legs of the black pony, had stood ready at his office door, and was now  in waiting, the horse tethered to a tree at the edge of the wood not far  away.    This lap robe Robert Brierly reverently drew away as he knelt beside the  still form, and thus, for some moments remained, turning his gaze from  right to left, from the great tree which grew close at the motionless  feet, and between the group and the water's edge, its branches spreading  out above them and forming a canopy over the body to a dead stump some  distance away, where a small target leaned, its rings of white and black  and red showing how often a steady hand had sent the ball, close and  closer, until the bull's eye was pierced at last.    No word was uttered as he knelt there, and before he arose he placed a  hand upon the dead man's shoulder with an impulsive caressing motion,  and bending down, kissed the cold temple just above the crimson  death-mark. Then, slowly, reverently, he drew the covering once more  over the body and arose.    \"That was a vow,\" he said to the doctor, who stood close beside him.  \"Where is--ah!\" He turned toward the group of men who, when he knelt,  had withdrawn to a respectful distance.    \"Which of you suggested that he had fallen--tripped?\"    Doran came forward and silently pointed to the foot of the tree, where,  trailing across the grass, and past the dead man's feet, was a tendril  of wild ivy entangled and broken.    \"Oh!\" exclaimed Brierly. \"You saw that too?\"    \"It was the first thing I did see,\" said the other, coming to his side,  \"when I looked about me. It's a very clear case, Mr. Brierly.  Target-shooting has been quite a pastime here lately. And see! There  couldn't be a better place to stand and shoot at that target, than right  against that tree, braced against it. It's the right distance and all.  He must have stood there, and when he hit the bull's eye, he made a  quick forward step, caught his foot in that vine and tripped. A man will  naturally throw out his arm in falling so, especially the right one,  and in doing that, somehow as he lunged forward it happened.\"    \"Yes,\" murmured Brierly, \"it is a very simple theory. It--it might have  happened so.\"    \"There wasn't any other way it could happen,\" muttered one of Doran's  companions. And at that moment the wheels of an approaching vehicle were  heard, and all turned to look toward the long black hearse, divested of  its plumes, and with two or three thick blankets upon its velvet floor.    It was the doctor who superintended the lifting of the body, keeping the  head covered, and when the hearse drove slowly away with its pathetic  burden, he turned to Doran.    \"I'll drive Mr. Brierly back to town, Doran,\" he said, \"if you don't  mind taking his wheel in charge;\" and scarcely waiting for Doran's  willing assent, he took Richard Brierly's arm and led him toward his  phaeton.    The young man had picked up his brother's hat, as they lifted the body  from the ground, and he now carried it in his hand, laying it gently  upon his knees as he took his seat.    When the doctor had taken his place and picked up the reins he leaned  out and looked about him.

Hotels in the city is branching out. Why, you take the dining-room  side of it,\" continued Mr. Smith, looking round at the group, \"there's  thousands in it. The old plan's all gone. Folks won't eat now in an  ordinary dining-room with a high ceiling and windows. You have to get  'em down underground in a room with no windows and lots of sawdust round  and waiters that can't speak English. I seen them places last time I was  in the city. They call 'em Rats' Coolers. And for light meals they want  a Caff, a real French Caff, and for folks that come in late another  place that they call a Girl Room that don't shut up at all. If I go to  the city that's the kind of place I mean to run. What's yours, Gol? It's  on the house?\"    And it was just at the moment when Mr. Smith said this that Billy, the  desk-clerk, entered the room with the telegram in his hand.    But stop--it is impossible for you to understand the anxiety with which  Mr. Smith and his associates awaited the news from the Commissioners,  without first realizing the astounding progress of Mr. Smith in the  three past years, and the pinnacle of public eminence to which he had  attained.    Mr. Smith had come down from the lumber country of the Spanish River,  where the divide is toward the Hudson Bay,--\"back north\" as they called  it in Mariposa.    He had been, it was said, a cook in the lumber shanties. To this day Mr.  Smith can fry an egg on both sides with a lightness of touch that is the  despair of his own \"help.\"    After that, he had run a river driver's boarding-house.    After that, he had taken a food contract for a gang of railroad navvies  on the transcontinental.    After that, of course, the whole world was open to him.    He came down to Mariposa and bought out the \"inside\" of what had been  the Royal Hotel.    Those who are educated understand that by the \"inside\" of a hotel is  meant everything except the four outer walls of it--the fittings, the  furniture, the bar, Billy the desk-clerk, the three dining-room girls,  and above all the license granted by King Edward VII., and ratified  further by King George, for the sale of intoxicating liquors.    Till then the Royal had been a mere nothing. As \"Smith's Hotel\" it broke  into a blaze of effulgence.    From the first, Mr. Smith, as a proprietor, was a wild, rapturous  success.    He had all the qualifications.    He weighed two hundred and eighty pounds.    He could haul two drunken men out of the bar each by the scruff of the  neck without the faintest anger or excitement.    He carried money enough in his trousers pockets to start a bank, and  spent it on anything, bet it on anything, and gave it away in handfuls.    He was never drunk, and, as a point of chivalry to his customers, never  quite sober. Anybody was free of the hotel who cared to come in. Anybody  who didn't like it could go out. Drinks of all kinds cost five cents,  or six for a quarter. Meals and beds were practically free. Any persons  foolish enough to go to the desk and pay for them, Mr. Smith charged  according to the expression of their faces.    At first the loafers and the shanty men settled down on the place in a  shower. But that was not the \"trade\" that Mr. Smith wanted. He knew  how to get rid of them. An army of charwomen, turned into the hotel,  scrubbed it from top to bottom. A vacuum cleaner, the first seen in  Mariposa, hissed and screamed in the corridors. Forty brass beds were  imported from the city, not, of course, for the guests to sleep in, but  to keep them out. A bar-tender with a starched coat and wicker sleeves  was put behind the bar.    The loafers were put out of business. The place had become too \"high  toned\" for them.    To get the high class trade, Mr. Smith set himself to dress the part.  He wore wide cut coats of filmy serge, light as gossamer; chequered  waistcoats with a pattern for every day in the week; fedora hats light  as autumn leaves; four-in-hand ties of saffron and myrtle green with a  diamond pin the size of a hazel nut. On his fingers there were as many  gems as would grace a native prince of India; across his waistcoat lay  a gold watch-chain in huge square links and in his pocket a gold watch  that weighed a pound and a half and marked minutes, seconds and quarter  seconds. Just to look at Josh Smith's watch brought at least ten men to  the bar every evening.    Every morning Mr. Smith was shaved by Jefferson Thorpe, across the way.  All that art could do, all that Florida water could effect, was lavished  on his person.    Mr. Smith became a local character. Mariposa was at his feet. All the  reputable business-men drank at Mr. Smith's bar, and in the little  parlour behind it you might find at any time a group of the brightest  intellects in the town.    Not but what there was opposition at first. The clergy, for example,  who accepted the Mariposa House and the Continental as a necessary and  useful evil, looked askance at the blazing lights and the surging crowd  of Mr. Smith's saloon. They preached against him. When the Rev. Dean  Drone led off with a sermon on the text \"Lord be merciful even unto this  publican Matthew Six,\" it was generally understood as an invitation to  strike Mr. Smith dead. In the same way the sermon at the Presbyterian  church the week after was on the text \"Lo what now doeth Abiram in the  land of Melchisideck Kings Eight and Nine?\" and it was perfectly plain  that what was meant was, \"Lo, what is Josh Smith doing in Mariposa?\"    But this opposition had been countered by a wide and sagacious  philanthropy. I think Mr. Smith first got the idea of that on the night  when the steam merry-go-round came to Mariposa. Just below the hostelry,  on an empty lot, it whirled and whistled, steaming forth its tunes on  the summer evening while the children crowded round it in hundreds. Down  the street strolled Mr. Smith, wearing a soft fedora to indicate that it  was evening.    \"What d'you charge for a ride, boss?\" said Mr. Smith.    \"Two for a nickel,\" said the man.    \"Take that,\" said Mr. Smith, handing out a ten-dollar bill from a roll  of money, \"and ride the little folks free all evening.\"    That night the merry-go-round whirled madly till after midnight,  freighted to capacity with Mariposa children, while up in Smith's Hotel,  parents, friends and admirers, as the news spread, were standing four  deep along the bar. They sold forty dollars' worth of lager alone that  night, and Mr. Smith learned, if he had not already suspected it, the  blessedness of giving.    The uses of philanthropy went further. Mr. Smith subscribed to  everything, joined everything, gave to everything. He became an  Oddfellow, a Forester, A Knight of Pythias and a Workman. He gave a  hundred dollars to the Mariposa Hospital and a hundred dollars to the  Young Men's Christian Association.    He subscribed to the Ball Club, the Lacrosse Club, the Curling Club,  to anything, in fact, and especially to all those things which needed  premises to meet in and grew thirsty in their discussions.    As a consequence the Oddfellows held their annual banquet at Smith's  Hotel and the Oyster Supper of the Knights of Pythias was celebrated in  Mr. Smith's dining-room.    Even more effective, perhaps, were Mr. Smith's secret benefactions,  the kind of giving done by stealth of which not a soul in town knew  anything, often, for a week after it was done. It was in this way that  Mr. Smith put the new font in Dean Drone's church, and handed over a  hundred dollars to Judge Pepperleigh for the unrestrained use of the  Conservative party.    So it came about that, little by little, the antagonism had died down.  Smith's Hotel became an accepted institution in Mariposa. Even the  temperance people were proud of Mr. Smith as a sort of character who  added distinction to the town. There were moments, in the earlier quiet  of the morning, when Dean Drone would go so far as to step in to the  \"rotunda\" and collect a subscription. As for the Salvation Army, they  ran in and out all the time unreproved.    On only one point difficulty still remained. That was the closing of  the bar. Mr. Smith could never bring his mind to it,--not as a matter of  profit, but as a point of honour. It was too much for him to feel that  Judge Pepperleigh might be out on the sidewalk thirsty at midnight, that  the night hands of the Times-Herald on Wednesday might be compelled  to go home dry. On this point Mr. Smith's moral code was simplicity  itself,--do what is right and take the consequences. So the bar stayed  open.    Every town, I suppose, has its meaner spirits. In every genial  bosom some snake is warmed,--or, as Mr. Smith put it to Golgotha  Gingham--\"there are some fellers even in this town skunks enough to  inform.\"    At first the Mariposa court quashed all indictments. The presiding  judge, with his spectacles on and a pile of books in front of him,  threatened the informer with the penitentiary. The whole bar of Mariposa  was with Mr. Smith. But by sheer iteration the informations had proved  successful. Judge Pepperleigh learned that Mr. Smith had subscribed a  hundred dollars for the Liberal party and at once fined him for keeping  open after hours. That made one conviction. On the top of this had come  the untoward incident just mentioned and that made two. Beyond that  was the deluge. This then was the exact situation when Billy, the desk  clerk, entered the back bar with the telegram in his hand.    \"Here's your wire, sir,\" he said.    \"What does it say?\" said Mr. Smith.    He always dealt with written documents with a fine air of detachment. I  don't suppose there were ten people in Mariposa who knew that Mr. Smith  couldn't read.    Billy opened the message and read, \"Commissioners give you three months  to close down.\"    \"Let me read it,\" said Mr. Smith, \"that's right, three months to close  down.\"    There"]]]
