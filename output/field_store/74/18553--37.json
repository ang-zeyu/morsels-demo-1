[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30755"],[0,"The Stones of Venice, Volume 2 (of 3), (#4)"],[1," are feeding and resting upon the site of the city that they  left; the mower's scythe swept this day at dawn over the chief street of  the city that they built, and the swathes of soft grass are now sending  up their scent into the night air, the only incense that fills the  temple of their ancient worship. Let us go down into that little space  of meadow land.    Sec. III. The inlet which runs nearest to the base of the campanile is  not that by which Torcello is commonly approached. Another, somewhat  broader, and overhung by alder copse, winds out of the main channel of  the lagoon up to the very edge of the little meadow which was once the  Piazza of the city, and there, stayed by a few grey stones which present  some semblance of a quay, forms its boundary at one extremity. Hardly  larger than an ordinary English farmyard, and roughly enclosed on each  side by broken palings and hedges of honeysuckle and briar, the narrow  field retires from the water's edge, traversed by a scarcely traceable  footpath, for some forty or fifty paces, and then expanding into the  form of a small square, with buildings on three sides of it, the fourth  being that which opens to the water. Two of these, that on our left and  that in front of us as we approach from the canal, are so small that  they might well be taken for the out-houses of the farm, though the  first is a conventual building, and the other aspires to the title of  the \"Palazzo publico,\" both dating as far back as the beginning of the  fourteenth century; the third, the octagonal church of Santa Fosca, is  far more ancient than either, yet hardly on a larger scale. Though the  pillars of the portico which surrounds it are of pure Greek marble, and  their capitals are enriched with delicate sculpture, they, and the  arches they sustain, together only raise the roof to the height of a  cattle-shed; and the first strong impression which the spectator  receives from the whole scene is, that whatever sin it may have been  which has on this spot been visited with so utter a desolation, it could  not at least have been ambition. Nor will this impression be diminished  as we approach, or enter, the larger church to which the whole group of  building is subordinate. It has evidently been built by men in flight  and distress,[4] who sought in the hurried erection of their island  church such a shelter for their earnest and sorrowful worship as, on the  one hand, could not attract the eyes of their enemies by its splendor,  and yet, on the other, might not awaken too bitter feelings by its  contrast with the churches which they had seen destroyed. There is  visible everywhere a simple and tender effort to recover some of the  form of the temples which they had loved, and to do honor to God by that  which they were erecting, while distress and humiliation prevented the  desire, and prudence precluded the admission, either of luxury of  ornament or magnificence of plan. The exterior is absolutely devoid of  decoration, with the exception only of the western entrance and the  lateral door, of which the former has carved sideposts and architrave,  and the latter, crosses of rich sculpture; while the massy stone  shutters of the windows, turning on huge rings of stone, which answer  the double purpose of stanchions and brackets, cause the whole building  rather to resemble a refuge from Alpine storm than the cathedral of a  populous city; and, internally, the two solemn mosaics of the eastern  and western extremities,--one representing the Last Judgment, the other  the Madonna, her tears falling as her hands are raised to bless,--and  the noble range of pillars which enclose the space between, terminated  by the high throne for the pastor and the semicircular raised seats for  the superior clergy, are expressive at once of the deep sorrow and the  sacred courage of men who had no home left them upon earth, but who  looked for one to come, of men \"persecuted but not forsaken, cast down  but not destroyed.\"    Sec. IV. I am not aware of any other early church in Italy which has this  peculiar expression in so marked a degree; and it is so consistent with  all that Christian architecture ought to express in every age (for the  actual condition of the exiles who built the cathedral of Torcello is  exactly typical of the spiritual condition which every Christian ought  to recognize in himself, a state of homelessness on earth, except so far  as he can make the Most High his habitation), that I would rather fix  the mind of the reader on this general character than on the separate  details, however interesting, of the architecture itself. I shall  therefore examine these only so far as is necessary to give a clear idea  of the means by which the peculiar expression of the building is  attained.    [Illustration: Plate I.                 PLANS OF TORCELLO AND MURANO.]    Sec. V. On the opposite page, the uppermost figure, 1, is a rude plan  of the church. I do not answer for the thickness and external  disposition of the walls, which are not to our present purpose, and  which I have not carefully examined; but the interior arrangement is  given with sufficient accuracy. The church is built on the usual plan of  the Basilica[5] that is to say, its body divided into a nave and aisles  by two rows of massive shafts, the roof of the nave being raised high  above the aisles by walls sustained on two ranks of pillars, and pierced  with small arched windows. At Torcello the aisles are also lighted in  the same manner, and the nave is nearly twice their breadth.[6]    [Illustration: Plate II.                 THE ACANTHUS OF TORCELLO.]    The capitals of all the great shafts are of white marble, and are among  the best I have ever seen, as examples of perfectly calculated effect  from every touch of the chisel. Mr. Hope calls them \"indifferently  imitated from the Corinthian:\"[7] but the expression is as inaccurate as  it is unjust; every one of them is different in design, and their  variations are as graceful as they are fanciful. I could not, except by  an elaborate drawing, give any idea of the sharp, dark, deep  penetrations of the chisel into their snowy marble, but a single example  is given in the opposite plate, fig. 1, of the nature of the changes  effected in them from the Corinthian type. In this capital, although a  kind of acanthus (only with rounded lobes) is indeed used for the upper  range of leaves, the lower range is not acanthus at all, but a kind of  vine, or at least that species of plant which stands for vine in all  early Lombardic and Byzantine work (vide Vol. I. Appendix 8); the leaves  are trefoiled, and the stalks cut clear so that they might be grasped  with the hand, and cast sharp dark shadows, perpetually changing, across  the bell of the capital behind them. I have drawn one of these vine  plants larger in fig. 2, that the reader may see how little imitation  of the Corinthian there is in them, and how boldly the stems of the  leaves are detached from the ground. But there is another circumstance  in this ornament still more noticeable. The band which encircles the  shaft beneath the spring of the leaves is copied from the common  classical wreathed or braided fillet, of which the reader may see  examples on almost every building of any pretensions in modern London.  But the mediaeval builders could not be content with the dead and  meaningless scroll: the Gothic energy and love of life, mingled with the  early Christian religious symbolism, were struggling daily into more  vigorous expression, and they turned the wreathed band into a serpent of  three times the length necessary to undulate round the shaft, which,  knotting itself into a triple chain, shows at one side of the shaft its  tail and head, as if perpetually gliding round it beneath the stalks of  the vines. The vine, as is well known, was one of the early symbols of  Christ, and the serpent is here typical either of the eternity of his  dominion, or of the Satanic power subdued.    [Illustration: FIG. 1.]    Sec. VI. Nor even when the builder confines himself to the acanthus leaf  (or to that representation of it, hereafter to be more particularly  examined, constant in Romanesque work) can his imagination allow him to  rest content with its accustomed position. In a common Corinthian  capital the leaves nod forward only, thrown out on every side from the  bell which they surround: but at the base of one of the capitals on the  opposite side of the nave from this of the vines,[8] two leaves are  introduced set with their sides outwards, forming spirals by curling  back, half-closed, in the position shown in fig. 4 in Plate II., there  represented as in a real acanthus leaf; for it will assist our future  inquiries into the ornamentation of capitals that the reader should be  acquainted with the form of the acanthus leaf itself. I have drawn it,  therefore, in the two positions, figs. 3 and 4 in Plate II.; while fig.  5 is the translation of the latter form into marble by the sculptor of  Torcello. It is not very like the acanthus, but much liker than any  Greek work; though still entirely conventional in its cinquefoiled  lobes. But these are disposed with the most graceful freedom of line,  separated at the roots by deep drill holes, which tell upon the eye far  away like beads of jet; and changed, before they become too crowded to  be effective, into a vigorous and simple zigzagged edge, which saves the  designer some embarrassment in the perspective of the terminating  spiral. But his feeling of nature was greater than his knowledge of  perspective; and it is delightful to see how he has rooted the whole  leaf in the strong rounded under-stem, the indication of its closing  with its face inwards, and has thus given organization and elasticity to  the lovely group of spiral lines; a group of which, even in the lifeless  sea-shell, we are never weary, but which becomes yet more delightful"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30756"],[0,"The Stones of Venice, Volume 3 (of 3) (#4)"],[1,"mind of the reader.    Sec. XVIII. The effect, then, of the sudden enthusiasm for classical  literature, which gained strength during every hour of the fifteenth  century, was, as far as respected architecture, to do away with the  entire system of Gothic science. The pointed arch, the shadowy vault,  the clustered shaft, the heaven-pointing spire, were all swept away; and  no structure was any longer permitted but that of the plain cross-beam  from pillar to pillar, over the round arch, with square or circular  shafts, and a low-gabled roof and pediment: two elements of noble form,  which had fortunately existed in Rome, were, however, for that reason,  still permitted; the cupola, and, internally, the waggon vault.    Sec. XIX. These changes in form were all of them unfortunate; and it is  almost impossible to do justice to the occasionally exquisite  ornamentation of the fifteenth century, on account of its being placed  upon edifices of the cold and meagre Roman outline. There is, as far as  I know, only one Gothic building in Europe, the Duomo of Florence, in  which, though the ornament be of a much earlier school, it is yet so  exquisitely finished as to enable us to imagine what might have been the  effect of the perfect workmanship of the Renaissance, coming out of the  hands of men like Verrocchio and Ghiberti, had it been employed on the  magnificent framework of Gothic structure. This is the question which,  as I shall note in the concluding chapter, we ought to set ourselves  practically to solve in modern times.    Sec. XX. The changes effected in form, however, were the least part of  the evil principles of the Renaissance. As I have just said, its main  mistake, in its early stages, was the unwholesome demand for  _perfection_, at any cost. I hope enough has been advanced, in the  chapter on the Nature of Gothic, to show the reader that perfection is  _not_ to be had from the general workman, but at the cost of  everything,--of his whole life, thought, and energy. And Renaissance  Europe thought this a small price to pay for manipulative perfection.  Men like Verrocchio and Ghiberti were not to be had every day, nor in  every place; and to require from the common workman execution or  knowledge like theirs, was to require him to become their copyist. Their  strength was great enough to enable them to join science with invention,  method with emotion, finish with fire; but, in them, the invention and  the fire were first, while Europe saw in them only the method and the  finish. This was new to the minds of men, and they pursued it to the  neglect of everything else. \"This,\" they cried, \"we must have in all our  work henceforward:\" and they were obeyed. The lower workman secured  method and finish, and lost, in exchange for them, his soul.    Sec. XXI. Now, therefore, do not let me be misunderstood when I speak  generally of the evil spirit of the Renaissance. The reader may look  through all I have written, from first to last, and he will not find one  word but of the most profound reverence for those mighty men who could  wear the Renaissance armor of proof, and yet not feel it encumber their  living limbs,[2]--Leonardo and Michael Angelo, Ghirlandajo and Masaccio,  Titian and Tintoret. But I speak of the Renaissance as an evil time,  because, when it saw those men go burning forth into the battle, it  mistook their armor for their strength: and forthwith encumbered with  the painful panoply every stripling who ought to have gone forth only  with his own choice of three smooth stones out of the brook.    Sec. XXII. This, then, the reader must always keep in mind when he is  examining for himself any examples of cinque-cento work. When it has  been done by a truly great man, whose life and strength could not be  oppressed, and who turned to good account the whole science of his day,  nothing is more exquisite. I do not believe, for instance, that there is  a more glorious work of sculpture existing in the world than that  equestrian statue of Bartolomeo Colleone, by Verrocchio, of which, I  hope, before these pages are printed, there will be a cast in England.  But when the cinque-cento work has been done by those meaner men, who,  in the Gothic times, though in a rough way, would yet have found some  means of speaking out what was in their hearts, it is utterly  inanimate,--a base and helpless copy of more accomplished models; or, if  not this, a mere accumulation of technical skill, in gaining which the  workman had surrendered all other powers that were in him.    There is, therefore, of course, an infinite gradation in the art of the  period, from the Sistine Chapel down to modern upholstery; but, for the  most part, since in architecture the workman must be of an inferior  order, it will be found that this cinque-cento painting and higher  religious sculpture is noble, while the cinque-cento architecture, with  its subordinate sculpture, is universally bad; sometimes, however,  assuming forms, in which the consummate refinement almost atones for the  loss of force.    Sec. XXIII. This is especially the case with that second branch of the  Renaissance which, as above noticed, was engrafted at Venice on the  Byzantine types. So soon as the classical enthusiasm required the  banishment of Gothic forms, it was natural that the Venetian mind should  turn back with affection to the Byzantine models in which the round  arches and simple shafts, necessitated by recent law, were presented  under a form consecrated by the usage of their ancestors. And,  accordingly, the first distinct school of architecture[3] which arose  under the new dynasty, was one in which the method of inlaying marble,  and the general forms of shaft and arch, were adopted from the buildings  of the twelfth century, and applied with the utmost possible refinements  of modern skill. Both at Verona and Venice the resulting architecture is  exceedingly beautiful. At Verona it is, indeed, less Byzantine, but  possesses a character of richness and tenderness almost peculiar to that  city. At Venice it is more severe, but yet adorned with sculpture which,  for sharpness of touch and delicacy of minute form, cannot be rivalled,  and rendered especially brilliant and beautiful by the introduction of  those inlaid circles of colored marble, serpentine, and porphyry, by  which Phillippe de Commynes was so much struck on his first entrance  into the city. The two most refined buildings in this style in Venice  are, the small Church of the Miracoli, and the Scuola di San Marco  beside the Church of St. John and St. Paul. The noblest is the Rio  Facade of the Ducal Palace. The Casa Dario, and Casa Manzoni, on the  Grand Canal, are exquisite examples of the school, as applied to  domestic architecture; and, in the reach of the canal between the Casa  Foscari and the Rialto, there are several palaces, of which the Casa  Contarini (called \"delle Figure\") is the principal, belonging to the  same group, though somewhat later, and remarkable for the association of  the Byzantine principles of color with the severest lines of the Roman  pediment, gradually superseding the round arch. The precision of  chiselling and delicacy of proportion in the ornament and general lines  of these palaces cannot be too highly praised; and I believe that the  traveller in Venice, in general, gives them rather too little attention  than too much. But while I would ask him to stay his gondola beside each  of them long enough to examine their every line, I must also warn him to  observe, most carefully, the peculiar feebleness and want of soul in the  conception of their ornament, which mark them as belonging to a period  of decline; as well as the absurd mode of introduction of their pieces  of colored marble: these, instead of being simply and naturally inserted  in the masonry, are placed in small circular or oblong frames of  sculpture, like mirrors or pictures, and are represented as suspended by  ribands against the wall; a pair of wings being generally fastened on to  the circular tablets, as if to relieve the ribands and knots from their  weight, and the whole series tied under the chin of a little cherub at  the top, who is nailed against the facade like a hawk on a barn door.    But chiefly let him notice, in the Casa Contarini delle Figure, one most  strange incident, seeming to have been permitted, like the choice of the  subjects at the three angles of the Ducal Palace, in order to teach us,  by a single lesson, the true nature of the style in which it occurs. In  the intervals of the windows of the first story, certain shields and  torches are attached, in the form of trophies, to the stems of two trees  whose boughs have been cut off, and only one or two of their faded  leaves left, scarcely observable, but delicately sculptured here and  there, beneath the insertions of the severed boughs.    It is as if the workman had intended to leave us an image of the  expiring naturalism of the Gothic school. I had not seen this sculpture  when I wrote the passage referring to its period, in the first volume of  this work (Chap. XX. Sec. XXXI.):--\"Autumn came,--the leaves were  shed,--and the eye was directed to the extremities of the delicate  branches. _The Renaissance frosts came, and all perished!_\"    Sec. XXIV. And the hues of this autumn of the early Renaissance are  the last which appear in architecture. The winter which succeeded was  colorless as it was cold; and although the Venetian painters struggled  long against its influence, the numbness of the architecture prevailed  over them at last, and the exteriors of all the latter palaces were  built only in barren stone. As at this point of our inquiry, therefore,  we must bid farewell to color, I have reserved for this place the  continuation of the history of chromatic decoration, from the Byzantine  period, when we left it in the fifth chapter of the second volume, down  to its final close."]]]
