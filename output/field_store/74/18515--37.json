Footnotes              TO THE READER.      [Transcriber's Note: This 17th-century book was printed in the  typographical conventions and spelling of that time; for instance, the  printed book used the long _f_-shaped glyph for the letter _s_, it  included old spellings such as _Kingdome_, _civill_, and _publick_, and  old words such as _hes_, _samine_, and _welas_, and numbers generally are  ended with a period. In this transcription, archaic printing is replaced  with modern characters, so the letter _s_ appears as _s_, with the effect  that what in the original book would look like _Minifters_ is here  transcribed _Ministers_, but archaic spelling, capitalization,  punctuation, and usage are transcribed as they appeared in the printed  book.]    It were long, neither do we now intend, to represent, what in the  beginning, by the Mercies of our _God_ and Ministry of his faithful  Servants, was the reformation of this Kirk: what purity of Doctrine and  Worship, what Order, what Authority, and what Unity continued for many  years, by the Prayers and Labours of Ministers and Professors, what  Novations and Corruptions have been introduced upon us of late, in the  time of our Division and Detection, by such as have ever been enemies to  the Cross of _Christ_, and who have minded earthly things: How manifold  and how comfortable experience we have at this time of the care and  compassions of our _Lord_ and _Saviour_ preventing the utter ruine of  Religion, and the horrible vastation of this Kirk, by looking upon the  afflictions of his people, by hearing their groans, mocked by the World:  And by moving the Heart of our gracious and dread Soveraign the Kings  Majesty to conveen a free national Assembly for redressing the wrongs done  to Religion, and what undeniable testimonies, and notable manifestations  of the divine presence and assistance of _Christ_, have accompanied this  meeting and whole work. _Who so is wise and observeth these things will  see the loving kindness of the Lord_.    For the present it seemed necessary that such of the Acts and  Constitutions of the Assembly as are of most general concernment should be  published in print; the correct writing of so many Copies as were called  for, not being possible to be exped in due time, and the Kirk having  resolved upon this course in former times, which, had it been keeped, our  defection through the almost invincible ignorance of the proceedings of  the Kirk, had not proven so dangerous and deplorable.    In these Acts and Constitutions special regard was had to our _National  Confession of Faith_, as it was at first and diverse times after professed  and is now of late sworn and subscribed, that all mens minds, who delight  not to cavil, might rest satisfied in the true meaning thereof, found out  by the diligent search of the Ecclesiastick Registers. Our care was also  rather at this time to revive and bring to light, former laudable Acts,  than to make any new ones, reflecting as little as might be upon the  reformation of other Kirks, and choosing to receive our directions from  our own _Reformation_, approven by the ample testimony of so many  _Forreign Divines_: according to the example of the venerable Assembly at  _Dort_, where special caution was, that the 30. and 31. article of the  Confession of the _Belgick_ Kirks touching _Ecclesiastick Order_ should  not be examined by _Strangers_, there being a _Difference_ touching that  point amongst _Reformed Kirks_, So many as were present can bear witness  that all the _Members of the Assembly_ were many times called on, and  required to propone their _Doubts_, and to give their _Judgments_ of every  _Article_, before it was Enacted, that every one might receive  _Satisfaction_, and from the full perswasion of his mind might give his  _Voice_: Wherin the _Unanimity_ and _Harmony_ was the more admirable, that  many parting from their _preconceived Opinions_, which had possessed their  _Minds_, did most willingly receive the _Light_, which did now  unexpectedly appear from the _Records_ of the _Kirk_.    That this _Extract_ shall stop the _Mouthes_ of the malicious, is more  than we can promise, or should be expected, We know there be some  Incendiaries who would with great joy and content of mind, seek their lost  penny in the ashes of this poor Kirk and Kingdom: And we have already  found, that our _Laboures_ and the grounds whereupon we have proceeded,  before they be seen, are misconstrued by so many as finds their hopes  blasted, and are come short of their earthly projects: but our comfort is  that we have walked in the truth of our hearts as in the sight of God,  That the Adversaries of the Kirk have not transformed themselves into  Angels of light, nor can say they are doing _God_ service, but are seen in  their colours, and do seek themselves, and that so many as have erred  before, not knowing the order and constitutions of this Kirk, will as  absent Children to their mother speaking plainly and powerfully of old and  now after long silence opening her mouth again, and uttering her mind in a  free Assembly, hear her voice, and with that reverence that beseemeth  under the supreme Majesty of _Christ_, obey her directions, that being all  of one mind, peace may be upon us, and upon the Kirk of _God_; and the  _God_ of peace, and love may be with us. 1639.            THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY, AT GLASGOW.          Act Sess. 6. November 27. 1638.      The testimony of the Committy for tryall of the Registers, subscribed with  their hands, being produced, with some reasons thereof in another paper,  and publickly read; _My Lord Commissioner_ professed that it had resolved  him of sundry doubts, but desired a time to be more fully resolved.    The Moderatour desired that if any of the Assembly had any thing to say  against the said testimonie for the books, that they would declare it, and  finding none to oppon, yet be appointed the day following, to any to  object any thing they could say; and if then none could object the  Assembly would hold the Registers as sufficient approven.          Act. Sess 7. November 28.        _Act. approving the Registers._      Anent the report of the Assemblies judgement of the authority of the books "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2897"],[0,"The Sequel of Appomattox: A Chronicle of the Reunion of the States (#4)"],[1,"a harsh exile, the victims  of ostracism or open hostility. One of them, William H. Smith, later  Governor of Alabama, testified that the Southern people \"manifest the  most perfect contempt for a man who is known to be an unequivocal Union  man; they call him a 'galvanized Yankee' and apply other terms and  epithets to him.\" General George H. Thomas, speaking of a region more  divided in sentiment than Alabama, remarked that \"Middle Tennessee  is disturbed by animosities and hatreds, much more than it is by the  disloyalty of persons towards the Government of the United States.  Those personal animosities would break out and overawe the civil  authorities, but for the presence there of the troops of the United  States.... They are more unfriendly to Union men, natives of the State  of Tennessee, or of the South, who have been in the Union army, than  they are to men of Northern birth.\"    In the border states, society was sharply divided, and feeling was  bitter. In eastern Tennessee, eastern Kentucky, West Virginia, and parts  of Arkansas and Missouri, returning Confederates met harsher treatment  than did the Unionists in the lower South. Trowbridge says of east  Tennessee: \"Returning rebels were robbed; and if one had stolen unawares  to his home, it was not safe for him to remain there. I saw in Virginia  one of these exiles, who told me how homesickly he pined for the hills  and meadows of east Tennessee, which he thought the most delightful  region in the world. But, there was a rope hanging from a tree for him  there, and he dared not go back. 'The bottom rails are on top,' said  he, 'that is the trouble.' The Union element, and the worst part of the  Union element, was uppermost.\" Confederates and Confederate sympathizers  in Maryland, West Virginia, Tennessee, and Kentucky, were disfranchised.  In West Virginia, Tennessee, and Missouri, \"war trespass\" suits were  brought against returning Confederates for military acts done in  war time. In Missouri and West Virginia, strict test oaths excluded  Confederates from office, from the polls, and from the professions of  teaching, preaching, and law. On the other hand in central and western  Kentucky, the predominant Unionist population, themselves suffering  through the abolition of slavery, and by the objectionable operations  of the Freedmen's Bureau and the unwise military administration,  showed more sympathy for the Confederates, welcomed them home, and soon  relieved them of all restrictions.    Still another element of discord was added by the Northerners who came  to exploit the South. Many mustered-out soldiers proposed to stay.  Speculators of all kinds followed the withdrawing Confederate lines and  with the conclusion of peace spread through the country, but they  were not cordially received. With the better class, the Southerners,  especially the soldiers, associated freely if seldom intimately. But the  conduct of a few of their number who considered that the war had opened  all doors to them, who very freely expressed their views, gave advice,  condemned old customs, and were generally offensive, did much to bring  all Northerners into disrepute. Tactlessly critical letters published in  Northern papers did not add to their popularity. The few Northern women  felt the ostracism more keenly than did the men. Benjamin C. Truman, an  agent of President Johnson, thus summed up the situation: \"There is a  prevalent disposition not to associate too freely with Northern men  or to receive them into the circles of society; but it is far from  unsurmountable. Over Southern society, as over every other, woman reigns  supreme, and they are more embittered against those whom they deem  the authors of all their calamities than are their brothers, sons,  and husbands.\" But, of the thousands of Northern men who overcame the  reluctance of the Southerners to social intercourse, little was heard.  Many a Southern planter secured a Northern partner or sold him half his  plantation to get money to run the other half. For the irritations of  1865, each party must take its share of responsibility.    Had the South assisted in a skillful and adequate publicity, much  disastrous misunderstanding might have been avoided. The North knew as  little of the South as the South did of the North, but the North was  eager for news. Able newspaper correspondents like Sidney Andrews of  the Boston Advertiser and the Chicago Tribune, who opposed President  Johnson's policies, Thomas W. Knox of the New York Herald, who had given  General Sherman so much trouble in Tennessee, Whitelaw Reid, who wrote  for several papers and tried cotton planting in Louisiana, and John  T. Trowbridge, New England author and journalist, were dispatched  southwards. Chief of the President's investigators was General Carl  Schurz, German revolutionist, Federal soldier, and soon to be radical  Republican, who held harsh views of the Southern people; and there were  besides Harvey M. Watterson, Kentucky Democrat and Unionist, the  father of \"Marse\" Henry; Benjamin C. Truman, New England journalist and  soldier, whose long report was perhaps the best of all; Chief Justice  Chase, who was thinking mainly of \"How soon can the Negro vote?\"; and  General Grant, who made a report so brief that, notwithstanding its  value, it attracted little attention. In addition a constant stream of  information and misinformation was going northward from treasury agents,  officers of the army, the Freedmen's Bureau, teachers, and missionaries.  Among foreigners who described the conquered land were Robert Somers,  Henry Latham, and William Hepworth Dixon. But few in the South realized  the importance of supplying the North with correct information about  actual conditions. The letters and reports, they thought, humiliated  them; inquiry was felt to be prying and gloating. \"Correspondents have  added a new pang to surrender,\" it was said. The South was proud and  refused to be catechized. From the Northern point of view, the South,  a new and strange region with strange customs and principles, was of  course, not to be considered as quite normal and American, but there  was on the part of many correspondents a determined attempt to describe  things as they were. And yet the North persisted in its unsympathetic  queries when it seemed to have a sufficient answer in the reports of  Grant, Schurz, and Truman.    Grant's opinion was short and direct: \"I am satisfied that the mass of  thinking men of the South accept the present situation of affairs in  good faith.... The citizens of the Southern States are anxious to return  to self-government within the Union as soon as possible.\" Truman came to  the conclusion that \"the rank and file of the disbanded Southern army...  are the backbone and sinew of the South.... To the disbanded regiments  of the rebel army, both officers and men, I look with great confidence  as the best and altogether the most hopeful element of the South, the  real basis of reconstruction and the material of worthy citizenship.\"  General John Tarbell, before the Joint Committee on Reconstruction,  testified that \"there are, no doubt, disloyal and disorderly persons in  the South, but it is an entire mistake to apply these terms to a whole  people. I would as soon travel alone, unarmed, through the South as  through the North. The South I left is not at all the South I hear and  read about in the North. From the sentiment I hear in the North, I would  scarcely recognize the people I saw, and, except their politics, I liked  so well. I have entire faith that the better classes are friendly to the  Negroes.\"    Carl Schurz on the other hand was not so favorably impressed. \"The  loyalty of the masses and most of the leaders of the southern people,\"  he said, \"consists in submission to necessity. There is, except in  individual instances, an entire absence of that national spirit which  forms the basis of true loyalty and patriotism.\" Another government  official in Florida was quite doubtful of the Southern whites. \"I would  pin them down at the point of the bayonet,\" he declared, \"so close that  they would not have room to wiggle, and allow intelligent colored people  to go up and vote in preference to them. The only Union element in the  South proper... is among the colored people. The whites will treat you  very kindly to your face, but they are deceitful. I have often thought,  and so expressed myself, that there is so much deception among the  people of the South since the rebellion, that if an earthquake should  open and swallow them up, I was fearful that the devil would be  dethroned and some of them take his place.\"    The point of view of the Confederate military leaders was exhibited by  General Wade Hampton in a letter to President Johnson and by General Lee  in his advice to Governor Letcher of Virginia. General Hampton wrote:  \"The South unequivocally 'accepts the situation' in which she is placed.  Everything that she has done has been done in perfect faith, and in the  true and highest sense of the word, she is loyal. By this I mean that  she intends to abide by the laws of the land honestly, to fulfill all  her obligations faithfully and to keep her word sacredly, and I assert  that the North has no right to demand more of her. You have no right  to ask, or expect that she will at once profess unbounded love to that  Union from which for four years she tried to escape at the cost of  her best blood and all her treasures.\" General Lee in order to set an  example applied through General Grant for a pardon under the amnesty  proclamation and soon afterwards he wrote to Governor Letcher: \"All  should unite in honest efforts to obliterate the effects of war, and to  restore the blessings of peace. They should remain, if possible, in the  country; promote harmony and good-feeling; qualify themselves to vote;  and elect to the State and general legislatures wise and patriotic men,  who will"]]]
