The phenomenon of the progression of the apsides of an oval       orbit, which is here alluded to, is familiar to all students       in mechanics.         \"It is perfectly absurd for persons unacquainted with       mechanical and geometrical science to presume to make the       experiment. Indeed, such efforts deserve rather the name of       conjuring than of experiment; but in this, as in many other       matters of life, it is true that \"fools rush in where angels       fear to tread.\" Perhaps the too hasty rush at the       experimental verification of Foucault's law may account for       some persons in England, whose opinions when given with due       deliberation are entitled to respect, having allowed       themselves to express doubts (which I understand, however,       have been since retracted) as to the truth of the law       itself. In Paris there was no difference of opinion among       such men as Lame, Poinsol, Binet, Leonville, Sturm, Chasles,       Bruvues, I believe Arago, Hermite, and many others with whom       I conversed on the subject, except as to the best mode of       making the theory popularly intelligible.\"    Explanations will be necessary from lecturers and others who give  imitations of M. Foucault's ingenuity to render it intelligible to  those unacquainted with mathematics, or with the laws of gravity and  spherical motion. For instance, it will not be readily understood by  every one why the pendulum should vibrate in the same plane, and not  partake of the earth's rotation in common with the table; but this  could be _shown_ with a bullet suspended by a silkworm's thread. Next,  the apparent horizontal revolution of the table round its centre will  be incomprehensible to many, as representative of its own and the  earth's motion round its axis.    Doubtless we shall soon have public exhibitions of the demonstration  in all our cities.    The pendulum is indeed an extraordinary instrument, and has been a  useful handmaid to science. We are familiar with it as the  time-regulator of our clocks, and the ease with which they may be made  to go faster or slower by adjusting its length. But neither this nor  the Pantheon elucidation constitutes its sole application. By it the  latitude may be approximately ascertained, the density of the earth's  strata in different places, and its elliptical eccentricity of figure.  The noble Florentine already quoted was its inventor; and it is  related of Galileo, while a boy, that he was the first to observe how  the height of the vaulted roof of a church might be measured by the  times of the vibration of the chandeliers suspended at different  altitudes. Were the earth perforated from London to our antipodes, and  the air exhausted, a ball dropped through would at the centre acquire  a velocity sufficient to carry it to the opposite side, whence it  would again descend, and so oscillate forward and backwards from one  side of the globe's surface to the other in the manner of a pendulum.  Very likely, the Cardinals of the Vatican would deem this heresy, or  \"flat blasphemy.\"    [Illustration]          THE BUTCHERS' LEAP AT MUNICH.      A correspondent of the London _Athenaeum_, writing from Munich, gives  the following account of the festival of the Butchers' Leap in the  Fountain: \"This strange ceremonial, like the _Schaeffler Tanz_, is said  to have its origin in the time of the plague. While the Coopers danced  with garlands and music through the streets, the Butchers sprang into  the fountain in the market-place, to show their fellow-citizens that  its water was no longer to be dreaded as poisoned. Perhaps they were  the Sanitary Commissioners of those days; and by bathing themselves in  the water and dashing it about on the crowd would teach the true means  of putting pestilence to flight.         \"Though the Coopers' Dance takes place only once in seven       years, the Butchers' Leap occurs annually, and always on       _Fasching Montag_,--the Monday before Shrove Tuesday. I       believe the ceremony is of great importance to the trade of       the Butchers; as certain privileges granted to them are       annually renewed at this time, and in connection with the       Leap. These two ceremonies--of the Coopers' Dance and the       Butchers' Leap--are now almost the last remains of the       picturesque and quaint customs of old Munich.         \"The Butchers commence proceedings by attending High Mass in       St. Peter's Church,--close to the Schrannien Platz, or       market-place, in which the fountain is situated. It is a       desolate-looking church, this St. Peter's, as seen from       without,--old, decaying, and ugly; within, tawdry       and--though not desolate and decaying--ugly. From staringly       white walls frown down on the spectator torture-pictures,       alternating with huge gilt images of sentimental saints in       clumsy drapery. The altars are masses of golden clouds and       golden cherubs.         \"Music, as from the orchestra of a theatre rather than from       the choir of a church, greeted us as we entered. The       Butchers were just passing out. We caught glimpses of       scarlet coats; and saw two huge silver flagons, covered with       a very panoply of gold and silver medals, borne aloft by       pompous officials clothed in scarlet. Having watched the       procession--some half-dozen tiny butchers' sons, urchins of       five and six years old, with rosy, round faces and chubby       hands, mounted on stalwart horses and dressed in little       scarlet coats, top-boots, and jaunty green velvet       hats--seven butchers' apprentices, the Leapers of the day,       also dressed in scarlet and mounted on horseback--the       musicians,--the long train of master-butchers and journeymen       in long dark cloaks and with huge nosegays in their       hats--and the scarlet officials bearing the decorated       flagons,--having watched, I say, all these good folk wend       their way in long procession up the narrow street leading       from the church, and seen them cross the market-place in the       direction of the Palace, where they are awaited by the       King,--let us look around, and notice the features of the       market-place:--for it is, in fact, a quaint old bit of the       city, and well worth a glimpse.         \"If I love the Ludwig Strasse as the most beautiful portion       of the new Munich, I almost equally love the Schrannien       Platz as about the quaintest part of old Munich. It is long       and narrow as a market-place, but wide as a street. The       houses are old; many of them very handsome, and rich with       ornamental stucco-work,--            'All garlanded with carven imageries          Of fruit and flowers and bunches of knot-grass.'         The roofs are steep, red tiled, and perforated with rows of       little pent-house windows. The fronts of the houses are of       all imaginable pale tints,--stone colors, pinks, greens,       greys, and tawnies. Three of the four corners of the       market-place are adorned with tall pepper-box towers, with       domed roofs and innumerable narrow windows. At one end is       the fountain; and in the centre a heavy, but quaint       shrine,--a column supporting a gilt figure of the Madonna.       The eye wanders down various picturesque streets which open       into the market-place; and on one hand, above steep roofs,       gaze down the two striking red-brick towers of the _Frauen       Kirche_--the cathedral of Munich:--those two red towers       which are seen in all views of this city, and which belong       as much to Munich as the dome of St. Paul's does to the city       of London,--those towers which in the haze of sunset are       frequently transformed into violet-tinted columns, or about       which in autumn and winter mists cling with a strange       dreariness as if they were desolate mountain peaks!         \"But the quaintest feature of all in the Schrannien Platz is       a sort of arcade which runs around it. Here, beneath the low       and massy arches, are crowded thick upon each other a host       of small shops. What queer, dark little cells they are,--yet       how picturesque! Here is a dealer in crucifixes,--next to       him a woollen-draper, displaying bright striped woollen       goods for the peasants,--then a general dealer, with heaps       and bundles and tubs and chests containing every thing most       heterogeneous,--and next to him a dealer in pipes. There are       bustle and gloom always beneath these heavy low arches,--but       they present a glorious bit of picturesque life. There are       queer wooden booths, too, along one portion of the       Schrannien Platz where it rather narrows, losing its       character of market-place, and descending to that of an       ordinary street. But the booths do not degenerate in their       picturesque character. The earthenware booths--of which       there are several--are truly delicious. Such rows and piles       of dark green, orange, ruddy chocolate-brown, sea-green,       pale yellow, and deep blue and grey vessels of all forms and       sizes--all quaint, all odd--jugs, flagons, pipkins, queer       pots with huge lids, queer tripods for which I know no       name--things which always seem to me to come out of a       witch's kitchen, but by means of which I suspect that my own       dinner is cooked every day. All these heaps of crockery lie       about the doors, and load the windows of the wooden booths,       and line shelves and shelves within the gloom of the little       shops themselves. When I first came here these old crockery       shops were a more frequent study to me than any thing else       in the old town.         \"We ascended a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3623"],[0,"The Golden Bough: A Study of Magic and Religion (#4)"],[1,"to  his service. Horses were excluded from the Arician grove and  sanctuary because horses had killed Hippolytus. It was unlawful to  touch his image. Some thought that he was the sun. \"But the truth  is,\" says Servius, \"that he is a deity associated with Diana, as  Attis is associated with the Mother of the Gods, and Erichthonius  with Minerva, and Adonis with Venus.\" What the nature of that  association was we shall enquire presently. Here it is worth  observing that in his long and chequered career this mythical  personage has displayed a remarkable tenacity of life. For we can  hardly doubt that the Saint Hippolytus of the Roman calendar, who  was dragged by horses to death on the thirteenth of August, Diana's  own day, is no other than the Greek hero of the same name, who,  after dying twice over as a heathen sinner, has been happily  resuscitated as a Christian saint.    It needs no elaborate demonstration to convince us that the stories  told to account for Diana's worship at Nemi are unhistorical.  Clearly they belong to that large class of myths which are made up  to explain the origin of a religious ritual and have no other  foundation than the resemblance, real or imaginary, which may be  traced between it and some foreign ritual. The incongruity of these  Nemi myths is indeed transparent, since the foundation of the  worship is traced now to Orestes and now to Hippolytus, according as  this or that feature of the ritual has to be accounted for. The real  value of such tales is that they serve to illustrate the nature of  the worship by providing a standard with which to compare it; and  further, that they bear witness indirectly to its venerable age by  showing that the true origin was lost in the mists of a fabulous  antiquity. In the latter respect these Nemi legends are probably  more to be trusted than the apparently historical tradition, vouched  for by Cato the Elder, that the sacred grove was dedicated to Diana  by a certain Egerius Baebius or Laevius of Tusculum, a Latin  dictator, on behalf of the peoples of Tusculum, Aricia, Lanuvium,  Laurentum, Cora, Tibur, Pometia, and Ardea. This tradition indeed  speaks for the great age of the sanctuary, since it seems to date  its foundation sometime before 495 B.C., the year in which Pometia  was sacked by the Romans and disappears from history. But we cannot  suppose that so barbarous a rule as that of the Arician priesthood  was deliberately instituted by a league of civilised communities,  such as the Latin cities undoubtedly were. It must have been handed  down from a time beyond the memory of man, when Italy was still in a  far ruder state than any known to us in the historical period. The  credit of the tradition is rather shaken than confirmed by another  story which ascribes the foundation of the sanctuary to a certain  Manius Egerius, who gave rise to the saying, \"There are many Manii  at Aricia.\" This proverb some explained by alleging that Manius  Egerius was the ancestor of a long and distinguished line, whereas  others thought it meant that there were many ugly and deformed  people at Aricia, and they derived the name Manius from _Mania,_ a  bogey or bugbear to frighten children. A Roman satirist uses the  name Manius as typical of the beggars who lay in wait for pilgrims  on the Arician slopes. These differences of opinion, together with  the discrepancy between Manius Egerius of Aricia and Egerius Laevius  of Tusculum, as well as the resemblance of both names to the  mythical Egeria, excite our suspicion. Yet the tradition recorded by  Cato seems too circumstantial, and its sponsor too respectable, to  allow us to dismiss it as an idle fiction. Rather we may suppose  that it refers to some ancient restoration or reconstruction of the  sanctuary, which was actually carried out by the confederate states.  At any rate it testifies to a belief that the grove had been from  early times a common place of worship for many of the oldest cities  of the country, if not for the whole Latin confederacy.        2. Artemis and Hippolytus    I HAVE said that the Arician legends of Orestes and Hippolytus,  though worthless as history, have a certain value in so far as they  may help us to understand the worship at Nemi better by comparing it  with the ritual and myths of other sanctuaries. We must ask  ourselves, Why did the author of these legends pitch upon Orestes  and Hippolytus in order to explain Virbius and the King of the Wood?  In regard to Orestes, the answer is obvious. He and the image of the  Tauric Diana, which could only be appeased with human blood, were  dragged in to render intelligible the murderous rule of succession  to the Arician priesthood. In regard to Hippolytus the case is not  so plain. The manner of his death suggests readily enough a reason  for the exclusion of horses from the grove; but this by itself seems  hardly enough to account for the identification. We must try to  probe deeper by examining the worship as well as the legend or myth  of Hippolytus.    He had a famous sanctuary at his ancestral home of Troezen, situated  on that beautiful, almost landlocked bay, where groves of oranges  and lemons, with tall cypresses soaring like dark spires above the  garden of Hesperides, now clothe the strip of fertile shore at the  foot of the rugged mountains. Across the blue water of the tranquil  bay, which it shelters from the open sea, rises Poseidon's sacred  island, its peaks veiled in the sombre green of the pines. On this  fair coast Hippolytus was worshipped. Within his sanctuary stood a  temple with an ancient image. His service was performed by a priest  who held office for life; every year a sacrificial festival was held  in his honour; and his untimely fate was yearly mourned, with  weeping and doleful chants, by unwedded maids. Youths and maidens  dedicated locks of their hair in his temple before marriage. His  grave existed at Troezen, though the people would not show it. It  has been suggested, with great plausibility, that in the handsome  Hippolytus, beloved of Artemis, cut off in his youthful prime, and  yearly mourned by damsels, we have one of those mortal lovers of a  goddess who appear so often in ancient religion, and of whom Adonis  is the most familiar type. The rivalry of Artemis and Phaedra for  the affection of Hippolytus reproduces, it is said, under different  names, the rivalry of Aphrodite and Proserpine for the love of  Adonis, for Phaedra is merely a double of Aphrodite. The theory  probably does no injustice either to Hippolytus or to Artemis. For  Artemis was originally a great goddess of fertility, and, on the  principles of early religion, she who fertilises nature must herself  be fertile, and to be that she must necessarily have a male consort.  On this view, Hippolytus was the consort of Artemis at Troezen, and  the shorn tresses offered to him by the Troezenian youths and  maidens before marriage were designed to strengthen his union with  the goddess, and so to promote the fruitfulness of the earth, of  cattle, and of mankind. It is some confirmation of this view that  within the precinct of Hippolytus at Troezen there were worshipped  two female powers named Damia and Auxesia, whose connexion with the  fertility of the ground is unquestionable. When Epidaurus suffered  from a dearth, the people, in obedience to an oracle, carved images  of Damia and Auxesia out of sacred olive wood, and no sooner had  they done so and set them up than the earth bore fruit again.  Moreover, at Troezen itself, and apparently within the precinct of  Hippolytus, a curious festival of stone-throwing was held in honour  of these maidens, as the Troezenians called them; and it is easy to  show that similar customs have been practised in many lands for the  express purpose of ensuring good crops. In the story of the tragic  death of the youthful Hippolytus we may discern an analogy with  similar tales of other fair but mortal youths who paid with their  lives for the brief rapture of the love of an immortal goddess.  These hapless lovers were probably not always mere myths, and the  legends which traced their spilt blood in the purple bloom of the  violet, the scarlet stain of the anemone, or the crimson flush of  the rose were no idle poetic emblems of youth and beauty fleeting as  the summer flowers. Such fables contain a deeper philosophy of the  relation of the life of man to the life of nature--a sad philosophy  which gave birth to a tragic practice. What that philosophy and that  practice were, we shall learn later on.        3. Recapitulation    WE can now perhaps understand why the ancients identified  Hippolytus, the consort of Artemis, with Virbius, who, according to  Servius, stood to Diana as Adonis to Venus, or Attis to the Mother  of the Gods. For Diana, like Artemis, was a goddess of fertility in  general, and of childbirth in particular. As such she, like her  Greek counterpart, needed a male partner. That partner, if Servius  is right, was Virbius. In his character of the founder of the sacred  grove and first king of Nemi, Virbius is clearly the mythical  predecessor or archetype of the line of priests who served Diana  under the title of Kings of the Wood, and who came, like him, one  after the other, to a violent end. It is natural, therefore, to  conjecture that they stood to the goddess of the grove in the same  relation in which Virbius stood to her; in short, that the mortal  King of the Wood had for his queen the woodland Diana herself. If  the sacred tree which he guarded with his life was supposed, as  seems probable, to be her special embodiment, her priest may not  only have worshipped it as his goddess but embraced it as his wife.  There is at least nothing absurd in the supposition, since even in  the time of Pliny a noble Roman used thus to treat a beautiful  beech-tree in another sacred grove of Diana on the Alban hills. He  embraced it, he kissed it, he lay under"]]]
