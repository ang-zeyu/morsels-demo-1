Borax has  been found useful with any water when making goods to be exposed in the  window or on the counters, such as taffies, rocks and clear boiled  sugars generally. Where the supply of water, as in most large towns is  suitable, given good sugar, cream of tartar or glucose, in proper  proportions, and careful boiling up to the standard, the addition of  borax is unnecessary and should only be resorted to under special  circumstances.      PLAIN TAFFY.      14 lbs. White Sugar.    2 quarts Water.    1/2 ounce Cream Tartar.    PROCESS.--This is an easy and capital recipe to begin with. The process  is practically the same as for all other clear goods, but the  ingredients being fewer there is little chance of their getting  complicated. With a thermometer it is hardly possible to make a mistake,  besides it will make the instruction more intelligible: should he not  possess this appliance, we must ask that the instructions \"How to boil  sugar\" should be committed to memory, as it would be tedious and a great  waste of time and space to keep explaining how to tell the different  degrees through which the sugar passes before it comes to the point  required for the different goods given in this book. For this and other  reasons I will assume the learner to be working with one.    Put the sugar and water in a clean pan, place it on the fire and stir it  occasionally till melted; when it comes to the boil add the cream of  tartar and put a lid on the pan; allow it to boil in this way for ten  minutes, remove the lid and immerse the bottom part of the thermometer  in the boiling liquid and allow it to remain in this position until it  records 310 degrees, then quickly take out the thermometer, lift off the  pan and pour contents into frames, tins, or on a pouring slab, which  have been previously oiled. If on a pouring slab, mark the boil into  bars or squares, while warm, with a knife or taffy cutter: when quite  cold it is ready for sale.      LEMON TAFFY.      14 lbs. White Sugar.    1/2 ounce Cream Tartar.    Saffron Coloring.    2 quarts Water.    Lemon Flavoring.    PROCESS.--Proceed as directed for plain taffy. When the sugar reaches  305 degrees, add a few drops of saffron color; when it reaches 310  degrees, add a few drops of oil of lemon and pour out immediately into  frames or tins; or if on pouring slab, mark out into bars or squares  before it gets cold. The pouring slab should be level so that the sheet  should be all the same thickness.      BUTTER SCOTCH.      8 lbs. White Sugar.    1 lb. Fresh Butter.    Lemon Flavoring.    1/4 oz. Cream of Tartar.    1 quart Water.    PROCESS.--Melt the sugar in the water by an occasional stir when the pan  is on the fire, then add the cream of tartar and boil up to 300, lift  the pan on to the side of the furnace and add butter in small pieces  broken off by the hand; slip the pan on the fire again, adding the lemon  flavoring; let it boil through so that all the butter is boiled in then  pour into frames; when partly cold mark with cutter into small squares;  when cold divide the squares; wrap each in wax-paper; sold generally in  one cent packages.    N.B.--There is good butter scotch and better butter scotch, but no bad  butter scotch; this quality may be improved by the addition of a large  proportion of butter: some makers would put 2 lbs. or even 3 lbs. to  this quantity, but that would be regulated by the class of trade and the  size squares. These frames are made to hold 144 squares; a boil this  size will make each square weigh about 1 oz., but any weight of square  may be arranged by the adding or deducting from the boil.      EVERTON TAFFY.      12 lbs. White Sugar.    2 lbs. Dark Sugar.    2 lbs. Fresh Butter.    1/2 oz. Cream of Tartar.    2 quarts Water.    Lemon Flavoring.    PROCESS.--Melt the sugar in the water, add the cream of tartar and boil  the whole to the degree of 300; lift the pan on the side of the fire put  in the butter in small pieces, place the pan again on the fire and let  it boil through; add the lemon and give it time to mix in, then pour out  contents into frame, or on pouring plate to cut up into bars. Everton  taffy and butter scotch are similar, except in color; same remarks as to  quality will apply in both cases; if the fire is very fierce, do not put  the pan down flat on it after adding butter; nurse it gently to prevent  burning; little fresh coke shaken over the fire would assist.      RASPBERRY TAFFY.      14 lbs. White Sugar.    1/2 oz. Cream of Tartar.    Raspberry Flavor.    2 quarts Water.    Brilliant Rose.    PROCESS.--Bring the sugar and water to a boil, add the cream of tartar,  put on the lid for ten minutes, then uncover and immerse the  thermometer; continue to boil to 300; tinge a bright red with liquid,  brilliant rose; add raspberry essence; pour out on frame or pouring  plate and mark into bars or squares of convenient size; when cold the  taffy is ready for packing and sale.      FIG TAFFY.      10 lbs Good Yellow Sugar.    2 lbs. Glucose.    3 lbs Figs Chopped Fine.    3 pints Water.    PROCESS.--Boil the sugar, water and glucose to a weak crack, 295; lift  the pan partly off the fire, putting a piece of iron under it to prevent  it burning; add the figs, gently letting the whole thoroughly boil  through and mix; pour in oiled tins or on slab, and mark into squares.  When adding the figs let them drop through the fingers, not in a heap.      WALNUT TAFFY.      5 lbs. Brown Sugar.    5 lbs. Crystal Sugar.    2-1/2 lbs. Glucose.    3 lbs. Walnuts.    2 quarts Water.    Lemon Flavoring.    PROCESS.--Shell the walnuts, peel off the skin chop very fine. Boil the  glucose, sugar and water as before directed to the degree of weak crack,  300. Lift the pan a little from the fire; add the prepared nuts by  letting them run through the finger gently; let the whole boil through,  then add a few drops of the oil of lemon; when thoroughly mixed in, pour  out the boil and mark into bars before too cold. The flavor is improved  by roasting the walnuts a little before putting in the boil.      PEANUT CANDY.    Boil to the crack, 1 quart best New Orleans Molasses, 1 lb. glucose and  1 quart water.    Prepare the meats by removing the thin reddish skin in which they are  enveloped and fill a tray to about the depth of an inch. Pour over them  the hot candy prepared as directed, stirring the meats till each one is  covered. A little less candy should be used than will suffice to  entirely cover the meats, though each separate one should be covered,  the object being to use just enough of the candy to cause the meats to  adhere firmly together, thus forming a large cake, which when nearly  cold may be divided into squares or bars with a sharp knife.    Almonds and other nuts may be used in the same manner above described.      BARCELONA TAFFY.      5 lbs. Brown Sugar.    5 lbs. Crystal Sugar.    3 lbs. Barcelona Nuts.    2 lbs. Glucose.    2 quarts Water.    Lemon Flavoring.    Prepare the nuts by chopping them fine, boil the sugar, glucose and  water to the degree 300. Remove the pan a little from the fire add the  nuts carefully; when thoroughly boiled through and amalgamated, add a  few drops of lemon and pour out contents into frame or on pouring plate  and mark into bars.      COCOANUT TAFFY.      6 lbs. Granulated Sugar.    2 lbs. Desiccated Cocoanut Unsweetened.    4 lbs. Brown Sugar.    2 lbs. Glucose.    3 pints Water.    Lemon Flavoring.    PROCESS.--Melt the sugars in the water, bring it to the boil, add the  glucose and continue to boil to the degree 300; lift the pan a little  way from the fire; let the desiccated cocoanut run gently in the boil;  continue to boil until the lot is well mixed through; add a few drops of  oil of lemon and pour out in frames; use the lemon cautiously, too much  spoils the flavor.

A good plan is  to have "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3031"],[0,"Wild Animals I Have Known (#4)"],[1,"least, so I concentrated all my energies on this one enterprise  of catching him before he left the region, and while yet in this  reckless mood. Then I realized what a mistake I had made in killing  Blanca, for by using her as a decoy I might have secured him the next  night.    I gathered in all the traps I could command, one hundred and thirty  strong steel wolf-traps, and set them in fours in every trail that led  into the canyon; each trap was separately fastened to a log, and each  log was separately buried. In burying them, I carefully removed the sod  and every particle of earth that was lifted we put in blankets, so that  after the sod was replaced and all was finished the eye could detect no  trace of human handiwork. When the traps were concealed I trailed the  body of poor Blanca over each place, and made of it a drag that circled  all about the ranch, and finally I took off one of her paws and made  with it a line of tracks over each trap. Every precaution and device  known to me I used, and retired at a late hour to await the result.    Once during the night I thought I heard Old Lobo, but was not sure of  it. Next day I rode around, but darkness came on before I completed the  circuit of the north canon, and I had nothing to report. At supper one  of the cowboys said, \"There was a great row among the cattle in the  north canyon this morning, maybe there is something in the traps there.\"  It was afternoon of the next day before I got to the place referred to,  and as I drew near a great grizzly form arose from the ground, vainly  endeavoring to escape, and there revealed before me stood Lobo, King  of the Currumpaw, firmly held in the traps. Poor old hero, he had never  ceased to search for his darling, and when he found the trail her body  had made he followed it recklessly, and so fell into the snare prepared  for him. There he lay in the iron grasp of all four traps, perfectly  helpless, and all around him were numerous tracks showing how the cattle  had gathered about him to insult the fallen despot, without daring  to approach within his reach. For two days and two nights he had lain  there, and now was worn out with struggling. Yet, when I went near him,  he rose up with bristling mane and raised his voice, and for the last  time made the canyon reverberate with his deep bass roar, a call for  help, the muster call of his band. But there was none to answer him,  and, left alone in his extremity, he whirled about with all his strength  and made a desperate effort to get at me. All in vain, each trap was a  dead drag of over three hundred pounds, and in their relentless fourfold  grasp, with great steel jaws on every foot, and the heavy logs and  chains all entangled together, he was absolutely powerless. How his  huge ivory tusks did grind on those cruel chains, and when I ventured to  touch him with my rifle-barrel he left grooves on it which are there to  this day. His eyes glared green with hate and fury, and his jaws  snapped with a hollow 'chop,' as he vainly endeavored to reach me and my  trembling horse. But he was worn out with hunger and struggling and loss  of blood, and he soon sank exhausted to the ground.    Something like compunction came over me, as I prepared to deal out to  him that which so many had suffered at his hands.    \"Grand old outlaw, hero of a thousand lawless raids, in a few minutes  you will be but a great load of carrion. It cannot be otherwise.\" Then I  swung my lasso and sent it whistling over his head. But not so fast; he  was yet far from being subdued, and before the supple coils had fallen  on his neck he seized the noose and, with one fierce chop, cut through  its hard thick strands, and dropped it in two pieces at his feet.    Of course I had my rifle as a last resource, but I did not wish to spoil  his royal hide, so I galloped back to the camp and returned with a cowboy  and a fresh lasso. We threw to our victim a stick of wood which he  seized in his teeth, and before he could relinquish it our lassoes  whistled through the air and tightened on his neck.    Yet before the light had died from his fierce eyes, I cried, \"Stay,  we will not kill him; let us take him alive to the camp.\" He was so  completely powerless now that it was easy to put a stout stick through  his mouth, behind his tusks, and then lash his jaws with a heavy cord  which was also fastened to the stick. The stick kept the cord in, and  the cord kept the stick in so he was harmless. As soon as he felt his  jaws were tied he made no further resistance, and uttered no sound, but  looked calmly at us and seemed to say, \"Well, you have got me at last,  do as you please with me.\" And from that time he took no more notice of  us.    We tied his feet securely, but he never groaned, nor growled, nor turned  his head. Then with our united strength we were just able to put him on  my horse. His breath came evenly as though sleeping, and his eyes  were bright and clear again, but did not rest on us. Afar on the great  rolling mesas they were fixed, his passing kingdom, where his famous  band was now scattered. And he gazed till the pony descended the pathway  into the canyon, and the rocks cut off the view.    By travelling slowly we reached the ranch in safety, and after securing  him with a collar and a strong chain, we staked him out in the pasture  and removed the cords.    Then for the first time I could examine him closely, and proved how  unreliable is vulgar report when a living hero or tyrant is concerned.  He had not a collar of gold about his neck, nor was there on his  shoulders an inverted cross to denote that he had leagued himself with  Satan. But I did find on one haunch a great broad scar, that tradition  says was the fang-mark of Juno, the leader of Tannerey's wolf-hounds--a  mark which she gave him the moment before he stretched her lifeless on  the sand of the canyon.    I set meat and water beside him, but he paid no heed. He lay calmly on  his breast, and gazed with those steadfast yellow eyes away past me down  through the gateway of the canyon, over the open plains--his plains--nor  moved a muscle when I touched him. When the sun went down he was still  gazing fixedly across the prairie. I expected he would call up his band  when night came, and prepared for them, but he had called once in his  extremity, and none had come; he would never call again.    A lion shorn of his strength, an eagle robbed of his freedom, or a dove  bereft of his mate, all die, it is said, of a broken heart; and who will  aver that this grim bandit could bear the three-fold brunt, heart-whole?  This only I know, that when the morning dawned, he was lying there still  in his position of calm repose, his body unwounded, but his spirit was  gone--the old kingwolf was dead.    I took the chain from his neck, a cowboy helped me to carry him to the  shed where lay the remains of Blanca, and as we laid him beside her,  the cattle-man exclaimed: \"There, you would come to her, now you are  together again.\"          SILVERSPOT, The Story of a Crow      I    HOW MANY of us have ever got to know a wild animal? I do not mean merely  to meet with one once or twice, or to have one in a cage, but to really  know it for a long time while it is wild, and to get an insight into its  life and history. The trouble usually is to know one creature from his  fellow. One fox or crow is so much like another that we cannot be sure  that it really is the same next time we meet. But once in awhile there  arises an animal who is stronger or wiser than his fellow, who becomes a  great leader, who is, as we would say, a genius, and if he is bigger, or  has some mark by which men can know him, he soon becomes famous in his  country, and shows us that the life of a wild animal may be far more  interesting and exciting than that of many human beings.    Of this class were Courtant, the bob-tailed wolf that terrorized  the whole city of Paris for about ten years in the beginning of the  fourteenth century; Clubfoot, the lame grizzly bear that left such  a terrific record in the San Joaquin Valley of California; Lobo, the  king-wolf of New Mexico, that killed a cow every day for five years,  and the Seonee panther that in less than two years killed nearly three  hundred human beings--and such also was Silverspot, whose history, so  far as I could learn it, I shall now briefly tell.    Silverspot was simply a wise old crow; his name was given because of  the silvery white spot that was like a nickel, stuck on his right side,  between the eye and the bill, and it was owing to this spot that I was  able to know him from the other crows, and put together the parts of his  history that came to my knowledge.    Crows are, as you must know, our most intelligent birds.--'Wise as an  old crow' did not become a saying without good reason. Crows know the  value of organization, and are as well drilled as soldiers--very much  better than some soldiers, in fact, for crows are always on duty, always  at war, and always dependent on each other for life and safety. Their  leaders not only are the oldest and wisest of the band, but also the  strongest and bravest, for they must be ready at any time with sheer  force to put down an upstart or a rebel. The rank and file are the  youngsters and the crows without special gifts.    Old Silverspot was the leader of a large band of crows that made  their headquarters near Toronto, Canada, in Castle Frank, which is a  pine-clad hill on the northeast edge of the city. This band numbered  about two hundred, and for reasons that I never understood did not  increase. In mild winters they stayed along the Niagara River; in cold  winters they went much farther south. But each year in the last week of  February, Old Silverspot would muster his followers and boldly cross the  forty miles of open water that lies between Toronto and Niagara; not,  however, in a straight line would he go, but always in a curve to "]]]
