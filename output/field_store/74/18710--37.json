[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38398"],[0,"Amphibians and Reptiles of the Rainforests of Southern El Pet√©n, Guatemala (#4)"],[1," resemblance, I have departed from the  formulae discussed by Simpson (1960) and have analyzed the degree of  resemblance by the following formula used to calculate an index of  faunal relationships:          C (2) / (N_{1} + N_{2}) = R, where          C = species common to both faunas.          N_{1} = number of species in the first fauna.          N_{2} = number of species in the second fauna.          R = degree of relationships (when R = 1.00, the faunas are        identical; when R = 0, the faunas are completely different).    The herpetofauna of southern El Peten has been compared with that in the  Tikal-Uaxactun area (Stuart, 1958), that in the humid lowlands of Alta  Verapaz (Stuart, 1950, plus additional data), and that in the Mexican  state of Yucatan (Smith and Taylor, 1945, 1948, and 1950). The  herpetofaunas of lowland Alta Verapaz and Yucatan are the largest,  having respectively 94 and 91 species, where as there are 78 species  known from southern El Peten and 64 from the Tikal-Uaxactun area. An  analysis of faunal relationships (Table 2) shows that the faunas of the  rainforests of southern El Peten and lowland Alta Verapaz are closely  related. The relationships between these two areas and the  Tikal-Uaxactun area in northern El Peten is notably less. Apparently  the biggest faunal changes take place between southern El Peten and the  Tikal-Uaxactun area, and between the latter and Yucatan. As stated by  Stuart (1958:7) the Tikal-Uaxactun is transitional between the humid  rainforests to the south and the dry outer end of the Yucatan Peninsula.  The transitional nature of the environment is exemplified by a rather  depauperate herpetofauna consisting of some species of both dry and  humid environments and lacking a large fauna typical of either.  Contrariwise, the continuity of the environment from southern El Peten  to the lowlands of Alta Verapaz is reflected in degree of resemblance of  the herpetofaunas.

ACCOUNTS OF SPECIES      In the following pages various aspects of the occurrence, life  histories, ecology, and variation of the species of amphibians and  reptiles known from southern El Peten are discussed. Only _Cochranella  fleischmanni_ reported by Stuart (1937) from Rio Subin at Santa Teresa  was not collected by us and is excluded. Because more worthwhile  information was gathered for some species than others, the length and  completeness of the accounts vary. All specimens listed are in the  Museum of Natural History at the University of Kansas, to which  institution all catalog numbers refer. Preceding the discussion of each  species is an alphabetical list of localities from which specimens were  obtained; numbers after a locality indicate the number of specimens  obtained at each locality.      =Bolitoglossa dofleini= (Werner)          Chinaja, 1.    An adult female having minute ovarian eggs has a snout-vent length of 81  mm., a tail length of 59 mm., 13 costal grooves, two intercostal spaces  between adpressed toes, 38-35 vomerine teeth in irregular rows forming a  broad arch from a point posterolaterad to the internal nares to a point  near the anterior edge of the parasphenoid teeth, and 43-44  maxilliary-premaxillary teeth. In life the dorsum was rusty brown with  irregular black and orange spots and streaks. The flanks were bluish  gray with black in the costal grooves and creamy tan flecks along the  ventral edge of the flank. The belly and underside of the tail were  yellowish tan with dark brown spots laterally. The limbs were orange  proximally and black distally; the pads of the feet were bluish black.  The dorsal and lateral surfaces of the tail were yellowish orange with  black spots. The iris was grayish yellow.    Stuart (1943:17) reported this species from Finca Volcan, Alta Verapaz.  He diagnosed his specimens as having 13 costal grooves and two or three  intercostal spaces between adpressed toes. He stated that the vomerine  teeth were about 12 in number and that in life the dorsum was mottled  gray and black, the sides gray and brown, and the undersurfaces  uniformly dark gray. These specimens differ noticeably from the  individual from Chinaja in the number of vomerine teeth and in  coloration.    In August, 1961, I obtained a specimen of _Bolitoglossa dofleini_ at  Finca Los Alpes, Alta Verapaz, approximately 13 kilometers airline  south-southwest of Finca Volcan and at approximately the same elevation.  Although the salamander was dead when found, it obviously was more  heavily pigmented than the individual from Chinaja. The belly was bluish  gray with black spots laterally; the dorsum was dull brownish gray with  some brownish red streaks. The specimen is a female having small ovarian  eggs, a snout-vent length of 90 mm., 13 costal grooves, and two  intercostal spaces between adpressed limbs. There are 28-29 vomerine  teeth, more than twice as many as in specimens from Finca Volcan  (Stuart, 1943:17), but noticeably fewer than in the specimen from  Chinaja.    The presence of this species at Chinaja lends support to the idea that  the specimen from the Rio de la Pasion listed by Brocchi (1882:116)  also is _Bolitoglossa dofleini_. Furthermore, the confirmed presence of  this species in the lowlands of El Peten suggests that there may be  genetic connection between _B. dofleini_ in the Alta Verapaz and _B.  yucatana_ in the Yucatan Peninsula. _Bolitoglossa yucatana_ differs from  _B. dofleini_ in having five intercostal spaces between adpressed toes  and in having a different color pattern. Both are robust species having  no close relationships to other species of _Bolitoglossa_ in northern  Central America.    The specimen from Chinaja was found in water in the axil of a large  elephant-ear plant (_Xanthosoma_) by day in March. Its stomach contained  fragments of beetles and a large roach. The natives did not know  salamanders and had no name for them.      =Bolitoglossa moreleti mulleri= (Brocchi)          Chinaja, 2; Rio San Roman, 1.    One specimen is a female having a snout-vent length of 80 mm., a tail  length of 82 mm., and a total length of 162 mm. It contains 63 large  eggs, the largest of which has a diameter of about three millimeters.  This specimen has 13 costal grooves, four intercostal spaces between  adpressed toes, and 12-13 vomerine teeth. A juvenile having a snout-vent  length of 39 mm. and a tail length of 33 mm. has 12 costal grooves,  three intercostal spaces between adpressed toes, and 8-8 vomerine teeth.  In life these salamanders were uniformly dull brownish black above with  a dull creamy yellow irregular dorsal stripe beginning on the occiput  and continuing onto the tail. There are no yellow or orange streaks or  flecks on the head or limbs. The specimen from the Rio San Roman was  taken from the stomach of a _Pliocercus euryzonus aequalis_ and has not  been studied in detail, because of its poor condition.    The present specimens show no tendency for the development of a broad  irregular dorsal band that encloses black spots or forms irregular  dorsolateral stripes, as is characteristic of _B. moreleti mexicanus_, a  subspecies that has been reported from La Libertad (Stuart, 1935:35) and  Piedras Negras (Taylor and Smith, 1945:545) in El Peten, and from  Xunantunich, British Honduras (Neill and Allen, 1959:20).    Schmidt (1936:151) and Stuart (1943:13) found _B. moreleti mulleri_ in  bromeliads at Finca Samac, Alta Verapaz. Taylor and Smith's (1945:545)  and Neill and Allen's (1959:20) specimens of _B. moreleti mexicanus_  were obtained from bromeliads, but Neill and Allen (_loc. cit._) stated  that the natives in British Honduras said that they had found  salamanders beneath rubbish on the forest floor. My specimens were  obtained from beneath logs on the forest floor in the rainy season.  Possibly in drier environments the species characteristically inhabits  bromeliads, at least in the dry season.      =Bufo marinus= (Linnaeus)          Chinaja, 3; 10 km. NNW of Chinaja, 1; 11 km. NNW of Chinaja,        1.    During both visits to Chinaja this large toad was breeding in a small  permanent pond in the camp. During the day the toads took refuge in  crevices beneath the buildings or beneath large boulders by the pond. At  dusk from four to ten males congregated at the pond and called. Tadpoles  of this species were in the pond in March and in July. One juvenile was  found beneath a rock in the forest, and another was on the forest floor  by day.    The natives' name for this species and the following one is _sapo_.      =Bufo valliceps valliceps= Wiegmann          Chinaja, 52; Rio San Roman, 8; Sayaxche, 2; Toocog, 1.    This is one of the most abundant, or at least conspicuous, amphibians  inhabiting the forest. Breeding congregations were found on February 24, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38404"],[0,"A Journey from Prince of Wales's Fort in Hudson's Bay to the Northern Ocean in (#4)"],[1," In the year  1719, Captain Knight and his associates sailed from England in two  ships, the _Albany_ and the _Discovery_, well provided with stores and  provisions, and even with strong iron-bound boxes in which to bring back  the copper and other precious metals. Unfortunately the expedition was  wrecked on Marble Island, and all the officers and crew were lost,  although their fate was not definitely known until nearly half a century  later.    Three years later, when the two ships had not returned, and no word had  been received from them, Captain Scroggs was sent by the Hudson's Bay  Company from Churchill to look for them, and at the same time to  continue the search for copper. The story of his journey, as given by  Dobbs in his \"Account of the Countries adjoining to Hudson's Bay\"  (London, 1744), says nothing about the explorers who had been lost, but  comments on the copper deposits as follows:--        \"He [Scroggs] had two Northern [Chipewyan] Indians with him, who      had wintered at Churchill, and told him of a copper mine      somewhere in that country upon the shore near the surface of the      earth, and they could direct the sloop so near it, as to lay her      side to it, and be soon laden with it; and they brought some      pieces of copper from it to Churchill that made it evident there      was a mine thereabouts. They had sketched out the country with      charcoal upon a skin of parchment before they left Churchill,      and so far as they went it agreed very well. One of the Indians      desired to leave him, saying he was within three or four days'      journey of his own country, but he would not let him go. Captain      Norton, late Governor of Churchill, was then with him.\"      The Captain Norton here mentioned was the father of Governor Moses  Norton who afterwards despatched Hearne to look for the Coppermine  River. Captain Carruthers, who is mentioned above, and who, according to  his own statement, had \"quitted\" the service of the Hudson's Bay Company  thirty-five years before 1748, said that he \"himself carried Mr. Norton,  who was afterwards Governor, and two Northern Indians to Churchill where  he put them in a canoe, and the purpose of their voyage was to make  discoveries and encourage the Indians to come down to trade and bring  copper ore.\"[5]    The journey of Mr. Norton referred to by Captain Carruthers was probably  undertaken about 1714, in which year York Factory was restored to the  English, after having been occupied by the French for seventeen years.  Probably it was on account of this and similar journeys that, in 1719, a  gratuity of L15 was voted to Mr. Norton by the Hudson's Bay Company, on  account of having endured \"great hardships in travelling among the  Indians.\" In 1733 the same Mr. Norton wrote to the directors of the  Hudson's Bay Company in London that he had \"served your Honors many  years and gone through many difficulties and hardships in taking long  journeys with the natives to promote your trade with them, even many  times to the hazard of my own life.\"[6]    In the same Parliamentary Report Alexander Browne, a surgeon who had  been for six years in the Company's service, testified \"that the Indians  brought down the ore at the request of Governor Norton,\" and also \"that  he had heard the late Mr. Norton say that he had been at this mine and  that a considerable quantity of copper might be brought down.\"[7] It is  not probable that Browne's statement with reference to Norton having  visited the Coppermine River is correct, but it would be rash to deny  that such a journey had been accomplished until the letters and records  of the Hudson's Bay Company are finally made public.    After the unsuccessful voyages of Captains Knight and Scroggs, several  other expeditions were sent from Churchill northward along the shore of  Hudson Bay. Most of these doubtless more than paid their way by trading  for furs with the Eskimos, but to the outside public they were  ostensibly to find the North-West Passage to China and the \"mine\" of  copper ore. The most important of these expeditions were those of the  _Furnace_ and _Discovery_ under Captains Middleton and Moor, in 1741-2,  and of the _Dobbs_ and _California_ under Captains Moor and Smith in  1746-7. After these expeditions, interest in the copper may have  languished for a while, but the numerous references to it in the  Hudson's Bay Report of 1749 show that it was not by any means forgotten.    Meanwhile, Richard Norton of Churchill had died, and his half-breed son  Moses Norton had been appointed Governor in his stead. In the year 1767  the remains of Knight's ill-fated expedition were found on Marble  Island, and the thoughts of the people on Hudson Bay were undoubtedly  again turned to the object for which his voyage had been undertaken. To  add to the interest in the copper, the Northern Indians, who came to  Churchill in the year 1768, brought with them some fine specimens of ore  which they said came from Coppermine River. By this time Governor Moses  Norton's interest was thoroughly aroused in the possible value of the  copper \"mines,\" and as they were said to be only four hundred miles from  Churchill, he determined that, if possible, something definite should be  learned about them. Accordingly, that very summer, when the ship came  from England, he took passage back in it to London, and laid a plan for  the discovery of this supposed great body of copper ore before the  directors of the Company and received their approval for its execution.  The plan was not to entail any very great expense to the Company. A man  was to be sent out with the Indians, who should be supported by them and  live as they lived.    Before that time other men had been sent into the wilderness, in the  same way, from factories, especially from York, where, in 1690, Henry  Kelsey had travelled southward until he met the so-called \"Naywatamee  poets\" or Mandan Indians, somewhere near the banks of the Assiniboine or  South Saskatchewan Rivers,[8] and in 1754 Anthony Hendry had made a  notable journey up the North Saskatchewan River to the great plains,  where he had endeavoured to establish friendly relations with the  Blackfeet Indians and their allies, and to prevent them from selling  their furs to Luc la Corne and the French merchants from Montreal, who  had penetrated into the same country several years before. Both these  men had been treated with the greatest kindness by the natives and had  brought back intelligent accounts of the countries visited by them,  though neither of them had the ability of Samuel Hearne to enable them  to prepare a report such as the one here published.    Governor Norton was a man of much more than the ordinary intelligence  and strength of character, and he saw that if the expedition was to be a  success it must be conducted by some one who would be able to make full  and accurate surveys of the route followed, and who could intelligently  describe the character and value of the \"mine\" and determine its  latitude and longitude by astronomical observations. For this purpose he  chose Samuel Hearne, now a young man twenty-four years of age, who,  after his service as a midshipman in the British Navy, was at the time  employed as a mate on the _Charlotte_, one of the Company's sloops  trading from Churchill with the Eskimos. The story of his journey, the  hardships which he endured, and the success which he achieved, form the  subject of this book and need not be discussed here.[9]    Hearne's character, which had been moulded to a large extent by his  surroundings, can be fairly well understood from a careful reading of  his book. He was diligent and reasonably accurate but not strong or  forceful. In this latter particular he differed from his great  successor, Sir Alexander Mackenzie, who descended the Mackenzie River  eighteen years after Hearne had reached its waters at Great Slave Lake.  Alexander Mackenzie was a man of masterful temperament, and those who  accompanied him, whether white men or natives, were merely so many  instruments to be used in the accomplishment of any purpose which he had  in hand. Their likes and dislikes, and their habits of life, were merely  interesting to him in so far as they affected the results that he wished  to attain. His book is a detailed description of the directions and  distances which he travelled each day, and of the incidents of travel as  they occurred. To Samuel Hearne the natives with whom he travelled were  beings whose thoughts and habits of life he found supremely interesting.  Their intentions and desires largely controlled the expeditions on which  he had embarked. With the exception of the accomplishment of the main  object in view, of reaching the Coppermine River, their wishes were  everything, his nothing.    His first expedition was a complete failure, as the Indians simply took  him off with them for a couple of hundred miles into the wilderness  until they became tired of his company and then robbed him of everything  he had and left him to find his own way back to Churchill as best he  could. His second expedition was more successful, as the Indians  tolerated his company for eight months and supported him as long as food  was plentiful, but their enthusiasm, or duty to the Master at Churchill,  did not last long enough to carry them to the Coppermine River.    Of his third and successful expedition Hearne was the historian and  surveyor, while Matonabbee, a bold and forceful Chipewyan Indian about  ten years his senior, was its leader. If at any time Hearne tried to  interfere with the arrangements made by the leader he was promptly told  to follow instructions if he wished to reach the copper mine. While  Matonabbee probably reciprocated, to some extent at least, Hearne's  affection for him, he was evidently thinking of and working for Moses  Norton, the rough but powerful governor of Fort Prince of Wales, rather"]]]
