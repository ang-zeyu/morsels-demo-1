Departure from Monte Video--Port Santa Elena--Geological remarks--Cape    Fairweather--Non-existence of Chalk--Natural History--Approach to Cape    Virgins, and the Strait of Magalhaens (or Magellan)    We sailed from Monte Video on the 19th of November 1826; and, in company  with the Beagle, quitted the river Plata.    According to my Instructions, the Survey was to commence at Cape San  Antonio, the southern limit of the entrance of the Plata; but, for the  following urgent reasons, I decided to begin with the southern coasts of  Patagonia, and Tierra del Fuego, including the Straits of Magalhaens.[4] In  the first place, they presented a field of great interest and novelty; and  secondly, the climate of the higher southern latitudes being so severe and  tempestuous, it appeared important to encounter its rigours while the ships  were in good condition--while the crews were healthy--and while the charms  of a new and difficult enterprize had full force.    {2}    Our course was therefore southerly, and in latitude 45deg south, a few  leagues northward of Port Santa Elena, we first saw the coast of Patagonia.  I intended to visit that port; and, on the 28th, anchored, and landed  there.    Seamen should remember that a knowledge of the tide is of especial  consequence in and near Port Santa Elena. During a calm we were carried by  it towards reefs which line the shore, and were obliged to anchor until a  breeze sprung up.    The coast along which we had passed, from Point Lobos to the north-east  point of Port Santa Elena, appeared to be dry and bare of vegetation. There  were no trees; the land seemed to be one long extent of undulating plain,  beyond which were high, flat-topped hills of a rocky, precipitous  character. The shore was fronted by rocky reefs extending two or three  miles from high-water mark, which, as the tide fell, were left dry, and in  many places were covered with seals.    As soon as we had secured the ships, Captain Stokes accompanied me on shore  to select a place for our observations. We found the spot which the Spanish  astronomers of Malaspina's Voyage (in 1798) used for their observatory, the  most convenient for our purpose. It is near a very steep shingle (stony)  beach at the back of a conspicuous red-coloured, rocky projection which  terminates a small bay, on the western side, at the head of the port. The  remains of a wreck, which proved to be that of an American whaler, the  Decatur of New York, were found upon the extremity of the same point; she  had been driven on shore from her anchors during a gale.    The sight of the wreck, and the steepness of the shingle beach just  described, evidently caused by the frequent action of a heavy sea, did not  produce a favourable opinion of the safety of the port: but as it was not  the season for easterly gales, to which only the anchorage is exposed, and  as appearances indicated a westerly wind, we did not anticipate danger.    While we were returning on board, the wind blew so strongly that we had  much difficulty in reaching the ships, and the boats were no sooner hoisted  up, and every thing {3} made snug, than it blew a hard gale from the S.W.  The water however, from the wind being off the land, was perfectly smooth,  and the ships rode securely through the night: but the following morning  the gale increased, and veered to the southward, which threw a heavy sea  into the port, placing us, to say the least, in a very uneasy situation.  Happily it ceased at sunset. In consequence of the unfavourable state of  the weather, no attempt was made to land in order to observe an eclipse of  the sun; to make which observation was one reason for visiting this port.    The day after the gale, while I was employed in making some astronomical  observations, a party roamed about in quest of game: but with little  success, as they killed only a few wild ducks. The fire which they made for  cooking communicated to the dry stubbly grass, and in a few minutes the  whole country was in a blaze. The flames continued to spread during our  stay, and, in a few days, more than fifteen miles along the coast, and  seven or eight miles into the interior were overrun by the fire. The smoke  very much impeded our observations, for at times it quite obscured the sun.    The geological structure of this part of the country, and a considerable  portion of the coast to the north and south, consists of a fine-grained  porphyritic clay slate. The summits of the hills near the coast are  generally of a rounded form, and are paved, as it were, with small,  rounded, siliceous pebbles, imbedded in the soil, and in no instance lying  loose or in heaps; but those of the interior are flat-topped, and uniform  in height, for many miles in extent. The valleys and lower elevations,  notwithstanding the poverty and parched state of the soil, were partially  covered with grass and shrubby plants, which afford sustenance to numerous  herds of guanacoes. Many of these animals were observed feeding near the  beach when we were working into the bay, but they took the alarm, so that  upon landing we only saw them at a considerable distance. In none of our  excursions could we find any water that had not a brackish taste. Several  wells have been dug in the valleys, both near the sea and at a considerable  distance from it, by the {4} crews of sealing vessels; but, except in the  rainy season, they all contain saltish water. This observation is  applicable to nearly the whole extent of the porphyritic country.  Oyster-shells, three or four inches in diameter, were found, scattered over  the hills, to the height of three or four hundred feet above the sea. Sir  John Narborough, in 1652, found oyster-shells at Port San Julian; but, from  a great many which have been lately collected there, we know that they are  of a species different from that found at Port Santa Elena. Both are  fossils.    No recent specimen of the genus _Ostrea_ was found by us on any part of the  Patagonian coast. Narborough, in noticing those at Port San Julian, says,  \"They are the biggest oyster-shells that I ever saw, some six, some seven  inches broad, yet not one oyster to be found in the harbour: whence I  conclude they were here when the world was formed.\"    The short period of our visit did not enable us to add much to natural  history. Of quadrupeds we saw guanacoes, foxes, cavies, and the armadillo;  but no traces of the puma (_Felis concolor_), or South American lion,  although it is to be met with in the interior.    I mentioned that a herd of guanacoes was feeding near the shore when we  arrived. Every exertion was made to obtain some of the animals; but, either  from their shyness, or our ignorance of the mode of entrapping them, we  tried in vain, until the arrival of a small "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38967"],[0,"The History of Painting in Italy, Vol. 4 (of 6) (#4)"],[1,"ol, that on the decease of the latter, he was  employed in the service of the prince, to complete his labours in the city,  and in the country. Ippolito Andreasi also painted a good deal upon the  cartoons of Giulio, and produced pictures of merit in S. Barbara as well as  elsewhere. There are moreover two frescos in the dome, at the chapel of S.  Lorenzo, attributed to one Francesco Perla; an altar-piece at S. Cristoforo  by Gio. Batista Giacarolo, neither of them greatly celebrated in this  class. Raffaello Pippi was a son of the head of the school; and there only  remains of him the honourable recollection of the very promising efforts of  his youthful genius, cut off in its happiest spring.    Following Giulio, his pupil, the cavalier Gio. Batista Bertani continued to  labour, and to instruct the school. He had accompanied his master to Rome;  he was a great architect, and an excellent writer on the subject, as well  as a painter of no ordinary talent. Assisted by his brother of the name of  Domenico, he ornamented several chambers in the castle of the court; and he  committed various altar-pieces to different painters, in the dome erected  by Giulio, in Sta. Barbara, which is the work of Bertani himself, and in  other churches of the place. To some of these artists he gave his designs.  He was esteemed almost as another Giulio by Duke Vincenzio, though very  inferior to his predecessor. For what Vasari observes of him, that his  knowledge did not equal that of his master, is no less true, than that the  chief part of his own assistants surpassed him. His assistants were Gio.  Batista del Moro, Geronimo Mazzuola, Paol Farinato, Domenico Brusasorci,  Giulio Campi, Paol Veronese; whose works, displayed in that cathedral, do  no less honour to the sanctuary than to the city. Yet let this be said  without the least reflection upon his merit, which, particularly in design,  was undoubtedly very great. This, indeed, we gather from his picture of the  Martyrdom of Sta. Agata, which, executed from the design of Bertani by  Ippolito Casta, approaches much nearer to the composition of Giulio than  other works of Ippolito, drawn from his own invention.    There is reason to believe that Ippolito was of the family of Lorenzo  Costa, together with Luigi, and another Lorenzo, both named Costa, and both  Mantuans. Orlandi states Ippolito to have been a pupil of Carpi. Baldinucci  includes him in the school of Giulio, either from his having frequented his  academy, or in other ways having availed himself of his instructions and  his models; and, indeed, his style betrays no slight traces of them. Lamo,  who wrote an account of the artists of Cremona, describes him to us as a  master, who about 1538 instructed Bernardino Campi; and moreover gives us  reason to suppose that his brother Luigi was likewise initiated by him in  the art. But he proved an inferior artist, and drew his chief celebrity  from his surname. Among the assistants of Taddeo Zuccari, about 1560,  Vasari mentions Lorenzo Costa, a Mantuan; and it seems likely that he  sprung either from Luigi or from Ippolito; and had such name conferred upon  him, as was usual, in memory of Lorenzo Costa, his grandfather, or from  some other relationship to him. We frequently read in the Guide of Mantua,  written by Cadioli, that such a painting is from the hand of Costa, without  giving his proper name; and it appears probable, that pursuing their  labours in the same studio, they may have contracted a sort of family  style, not indeed very correct or learned, but of a practical kind. There  is a pleasing air about the heads, and some care in the colours; for the  rest it is minute; not exact, nor sufficiently shaded; and in fine,  modelled upon the composition of one who aimed at imitating the grace, not  of rivalling the power of Giulio. The Costa are esteemed in Mantua among  the last disciples of the great school; nor do I know of their having  produced any pupil besides Facchetti, who devoted himself altogether to  portraits.    It will here be proper to state that Giulio in imitation of Raffaello gave  rise, by the influence of his taste, to a great number of artificers, who  ornamented other professions. He was possessed of those general ideas of  beauty and proportion, from which he drew his rules for the particular  direction of every work; an enviable distinction of that age, in which the  leading men were at once painters, modellers, and architects, extending  their influence even from the noblest works of art down to vases and plates  of earthenware, and cornices of wood. I am not certain whether Giulio, like  Raffaello, formed the taste of another Gio. da Udine, in drawing fruits and  trees, &c.: but I know that Camillo, a Mantuan, declared by Vasari to be  most excellent in point of landscape,[1] flourished about this period. Some  specimens in fresco still continue to adorn his native place; but he  chiefly produced his works in Venice, in Urbino, and at the ducal palace in  Pesaro, where, in a chamber, since changed into an armour-room, he painted  a grove, executed with so much taste and truth, that it would not be  difficult to number every separate leaf upon the trees. It is certain that  Giulio educated a pupil as his Perino, for his stuccos; and this was,  besides Primaticcio, a Gio. Batista Briziano, commonly called Mantovano,  who likewise became his Marc Antonio, engraving on copper many of the  pictures of his master, as well as of other distinguished artists of his  day. To him ought to be added Giorgio Ghisi, or Ghigi, who flourished at  the same period; and to these succeeded Diana, daughter of Gio. Batista,[2]  celebrated for her fine engravings; and this branch of art, introduced into  Mantua by that eminent artist, continued to prosper there for a long course  of years.      Footnote 1: In the _Life of Genga_.      Footnote 2: She is also called _Civis Volaterrana_, from her       connexion with that city; an instance that ought to be       present to our recollection, when we find that different       writers ascribe different countries to the same painter.    Another branch of the fine arts, that of miniature, seemed to attain its  perfection under one of Giulio's scholars. His name was D. Giulio Clovio,  of Croazia, a regular Scopetine Canon, afterwards becoming a layman by a  dispensation from the Pope. He had first turned his attention to the higher  branches of the art, but Giulio, who saw he possessed a peculiar talent for  diminutive figures, prevailed upon him to apply himself to these; and  taught him the first of any in Rome, the method of applying tints and  colours in gum and water colours, while in miniature he obtained  instructions from Girolamo da' Libri of Verona. He is esteemed at the head  of his profession in this line. In his design he displays a good deal of  study of Michelangiolo, and of the Roman School, though approaching nearer  to the practice of a good naturalist, exquisitely graceful in his colours,  and admirable in his exactness of drawing the minutest objects. Great part  of his labours were undertaken for sovereigns and princes, in whose  libraries may be found books ornamented by him in miniature with such a  degree of truth and spirit, that we appear to view these diminutive objects  rather through some camera-optica, than in a picture. It is related by  Vasari, that in an Office of the Virgin, made for the Cardinal Farnese,  there were figures which did not exceed the size of a small ant; and that  each part was nevertheless distinctly drawn. It is worth while, indeed, to  read the whole description given by that historian of the miniatures there  inserted, in which he likewise selected subjects adapted for a multitude of  figures, such as the procession of the _Corpus Domini_ at Rome, and the  feast of the Monte Testaceo: a labour of nine years, which was distributed  into twenty-six little histories. He produced numerous small portraits  painted for private people; (an art in which he is said by Vasari to have  equalled Titian) besides a few little pictures. These are rarely to be met  with in collections. There is one of the _Deposizione_, in the library of  the Padri Cisterciensi, at Milan, a piece quite original in its  composition, but which breathes altogether the taste of the golden period.  Indeed, I am inclined to be of opinion that Giulio promoted this very study  in Mantua; having myself seen there some exquisite miniatures, though by  unknown hands. It is also worthy of notice, as Vasari remarks, that by  means of Giulio, the art advanced towards perfection, not only in Mantua,  but throughout all Lombardy, (a state which, in the native acceptation of  the term, includes also a portion of the modern Venetian territories). This  we have already in part seen; and in part shall continue to see more  clearly in the course of this history.        MANTUAN SCHOOL        EPOCH III.         _Decline of the School, and Foundation of an Academy in       order to restore it._      Subsequent to the period in which Giulio flourished, the school of Mantua  produced no new names which at all approached the reputation of the first.  The disposition of its sovereigns was always inclined rather to invite  painters of celebrity from elsewhere, with a sure prospect of being  speedily and well served, than to promote the education of their young  subjects in the study of an art, slow in producing fruits, and subject to  rapid decay. We have already recounted a tolerable number assembled by Duke  Vincenzio for the object of ornamenting his churches; of several of whom he  also availed himself for the decoration of the palaces. Antonmaria Viani,  called _il Vianino_, a native of Cremona and a scholar of the Campi, thus  filled the double capacity of an artist and an architect. The frieze  surrounding the gallery of the court presents a specimen of their style,  where, in a ground of gold, are seen a group of"]]]
