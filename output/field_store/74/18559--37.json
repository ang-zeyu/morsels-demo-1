But such accidents  were only vexations crossing the fancies of the poet: they did not  essentially injure the magnificence, the pomp, and the fairy world  opened to the spectators. So little was the character of these Masques  known, that all our critics seemed to have fallen into repeated  blunders, and used the Masques as Campion suspected his painters to have  done, \"either by simplicity, negligence, or conspiracy.\" Hurd, a cold  systematic critic, thought he might safely prefer the Masque in the  _Tempest_, as \"putting to shame all the Masques of Jonson, not only in  its _construction_, but in the _splendour_ of its show;\"--\"which,\" adds  Gifford, \"was danced and sung by the ordinary performers to a couple of  fiddles, perhaps in the balcony of the stage.\" Such is the fate of  criticism without knowledge! And now, to close our Masques, let me apply  the forcible style of Ben Jonson himself: \"The glory of all these  solemnities had perished like a blaze, and gone out in the beholder's  eyes; so short-lived are the bodies of all things in comparison of their  souls!\"[13]      FOOTNOTES:      [2] Sir Philip Sidney, in his \"Defence of Poesy,\" 1595, alludes to      the custom of writing the supposed locality of each scene over the      stage, and asks, \"What child is there that coming to a play, and      seeing _Thebes_ written in great letters on an old door, doth      believe that it is Thebes.\" As late as the production of Davenant's      _Siege of Rhodes_ (_circa_ 1656), this custom was continued, and is      thus described in the printed edition of the play:--\"In the middle      of the frieze was a compartment wherein was written _Rhodes_.\" In      many instances the spectator was left to infer the locality of the      scene from the dialogue.--\"Now,\" says Sidney, \"you shall have three      ladies walke to gather flowers, and then we must believe the stage      to be a garden. By and by we heare newes of shipwracke in the same      place; then we are to blame if we accept it not for a rock.\" In      Middleton's _Chaste Maid_, 1630, when the scene changes to a      bed-room, \"a bed is thrust out upon the stage, Alwit's wife in it;\"      which simple process was effected by pushing it through the curtains      that hung across the entrance to the stage, which at that time      projected into the pit.      [3] The play of _Pyramus and Thisbe_, performed by the clowns in      Shakspeare's _Midsummer Night's Dream_, is certainly constructed in      burlesque of characters in court Masques, which sometimes were as      difficult to be made comprehensible to an audience as \"the clowns of      Athens\" found _Wall_ and _Moonshine_ to be.      [4] It is due to a great poet like Ben Jonson, that, without      troubling the reader to turn to his works, we should give his own      description of these characters, to show that they were not the      \"perplexed allegories\" they are asserted to be by Granger; nor      inappropriate to the _Masque of Christmas_, for which they were      designed. MINCED-PIE was habited \"like a fine cook's wife, drest      neat, her man carrying a pie, dish, and spoon.\" BABY-CAKE was \"drest      like a boy, in a fine long coat, biggin-bib, muckender (or      handkerchief), and a little dagger; his usher bearing a great cake,      with a bean and a pease;\" the latter being indicative of those      generally inserted in a Christmas cake, which, when cut into slices      and distributed, indicated by the presence of the bean the person      who should be king; the slice with the pea doing the same for the      queen. Neither of these characters speak, but make part of the show      to be described by Father Christmas. Jonson's inventive talent was      never more conspicuous than in the concoction of court Masques.      [5] The first employment of these two great men was upon _The Masque      of Blackness_, performed at Whitehall on Twelfth-Night, 1603; and      which cost nearly 10,000_l._, of our present money.      [6] The music of Whitelocke's _Coranto_ is preserved in Hawkins's      \"History of Music.\" Might it be restored for the ladies as a waltz?      [7] This was _Chloridia_, a Masque performed by the queen and her      ladies at court, on Shrovetide, 1630; upon the title-page of which      is printed \"the inventors--Ben Jonson, Inigo Jones.\" Jonson was, by      reason of the influence of Inigo, deprived of employ at court ever      after, supplanted by other poets named by the architect, and among      them Heywood, Shirley, and Davenant.      [8] George Chapman's _Memorable Maske_, performed at Whitehall,      1630, by the gentlemen of the Middle Temple and Lincoln's Inn, cost      the latter society nearly 2000_l._ for their share of the expenses.      [9] Ben Jonson records the names of the noble ladies and gentlemen      who enacted his inventions at court.      [10] The figures and actions of dancers in Masques were called motions.      [11] Memoirs of Jonson, p. 88.      [12] See Gifford's Jonson, vol. vii. p. 78. This performance was in      the _Masque of Hymen_, enacted at court in 1605, on the occasion of      the marriage of the Earl of Essex to the daughter of the Earl of      Suffolk.      [13] Splendour ultimately ruined these works; they ended in gaudy      dresses and expensive machinery, but poetry was not associated with      them. The youthful days of Louis XIV. raised them to a height of      costly luxuriance to sink them ever after in oblivion.          OF DES MAIZEAUX, AND THE SECRET HISTORY OF ANTHONY COLLINS'S MANUSCRIPTS.      Des Maizeaux was an active literary man of his day, whose connexions  with Bayle, St. Evremond, Locke, and Toland, and his name being set off  by an F.R.S., have occasioned the dictionary-biographers to place him  prominently among their \"hommes illustres.\" Of his private history  nothing seems known. Having something important to communicate  respecting one of his friends, a far greater character, with whose fate  he stands connected, even Des Maizeaux becomes an object of our inquiry.    He was one of those French refugees whom political madness or despair of  intolerance had driven to our shores. The proscription of Louis XIV.,  which supplied us with our skilful workers in silk, also produced a race  of the unemployed, who proved not to be as exquisite in the handicraft  of book-making; such were _Motteux_, _La Coste_, _Ozell_, _Durand_, and  others. Our author had come over in that tender state of youth, just in  time to become half an Englishman: and he was so ambidextrous in the  languages of the two great literary nations of Europe, that whenever he  took up his pen, it is evident by his manuscripts, which I have  examined, that it was mere accident which determined him to write in  French or in English. Composing without genius, or even taste, without  vivacity or force, the simplicity and fluency of his style were  sufficient for the purposes of a ready dealer in all the _minutiae  literariae_; literary anecdotes, curious quotations, notices of obscure  books, and all that _supellex_ which must enter into the history of  literature, without forming a history. These little things, which did so  well of themselves, without any connexion with anything else, became  trivial when they assumed the form of voluminous minuteness; and Des  Maizeaux at length imagined that nothing but anecdotes were necessary to  compose the lives of men of genius! With this sort of talent he produced  a copious life of Bayle, in which he told everything he possibly could;  and nothing can be more tedious, and more curious: for though it be a  grievous fault to omit nothing, and marks the writer to be deficient in  the development of character, and that sympathy which throws inspiration  over the vivifying page of biography, yet, to admit everything, has this  merit--that we are sure to find what we want! Warburton poignantly  describes our Des Maizeaux, in one of those letters to Dr. Birch which  he wrote in the fervid age of study, and with the impatient vivacity of  his genius, \"Almost all the life-writers we have had before Toland and  Des Maizeaux are indeed strange, insipid creatures; and yet I had rather  read the worst of them, than be obliged to go through with this of  Milton's, or the other's life of Boileau; where there is such a dull,  heavy succession of long quotations of uninteresting passages, that it  makes their method quite nauseous. But the verbose, tasteless Frenchman  seems to lay it down as a principle, that every life must be a  book,--and, what is worse, it seems a book without a life; for what do  we know of Boileau after all his tedious stuff?\"    Des Maizeaux was much in the employ of the Dutch booksellers, then the  great monopolisers in the literary mart of Europe. He supplied their  \"nouvelles litteraires\" from England; but the work-sheet price was very  mean in those days. I have seen annual accounts of Des Maizeaux settled  to a line for four or five pounds; and yet he sent the \"Novelties\" as  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31103"],[0,"A Christmas Greeting: A Series of Stories (#4)"],[1,"ice and snow, and the wind blew so that it cut the face.    As the old man trembled with cold, and the little child slept a  moment, the mother went and poured some ale into a pot and set it on  the stove, that it might be warm for him; the old man sat and rocked  the cradle, and the mother sat down on a chair close by him, and  looked at her little sick child that drew its breath so deep, and  raised its little hand.    \"Do you not think that I shall save him?\" said she, \"_Our Lord_ will  not take him from me!\"    And the old man,--it was Death himself,--he nodded so strangely, it  could just as well signify yes as no. And the mother looked down in  her lap, and the tears ran down over her cheeks; her head became so  heavy--she had not closed her eyes for three days and nights; and now  she slept, but only for a minute, when she started up and trembled  with cold: \"What is that?\" said she, and looked on all sides; but the  old man was gone, and her little child was gone--he had taken it with  him; and the old clock in the corner burred, and burred, the great  leaden weight ran down to the floor, bump! and then the clock also  stood still.    But the poor mother ran out of the house and cried aloud for her  child.    Out there, in the midst of the snow, there sat a woman in long, black  clothes; and she said, \"Death has been in thy chamber, and I saw him  hasten away with thy little child; he goes faster than the wind, and  he never brings back what he takes!\"    \"Oh, only tell me which way he went!\" said the mother: \"Tell me the  way, and I shall find him!\"    \"I know it!\" said the woman in the black clothes, \"but before I tell  it, thou must first sing for me all the songs thou hast sung for thy  child!--I am fond of them; I have heard them before; I am Night; I saw  thy tears whilst thou sang'st them!\"    \"I will sing them all, all!\" said the mother; \"but do not stop me  now;--I may overtake him--I may find my child!\"    But Night stood still and mute. Then the mother wrung her hands, sang  and wept, and there were many songs, but yet many more tears; and then  Night said, \"Go to the right, into the dark pine forest; thither I saw  Death take his way with thy little child!\"    The roads crossed each other in the depths of the forest, and she no  longer knew whither she should go; then there stood a thorn-bush;  there was neither leaf nor flower on it, it was also in the cold  winter season, and ice-flakes hung on the branches.    \"Hast thou not seen Death go past with my little child?\" said the  mother.    \"Yes,\" said the thorn-bush; \"but I will not tell thee which way he  took, unless thou wilt first warm me up at thy heart. I am freezing to  death; I shall become a lump of ice!\"    And she pressed the thorn-bush to her breast, so firmly, that it might  be thoroughly warmed, and the thorns went right into her flesh, and  her blood flowed in large drops, but the thorn-bush shot forth fresh  green leaves, and there came flowers on it in the cold winter night,  the heart of the afflicted mother was so warm; and the thorn-bush told  her the way she should go.    She then came to a large lake, where there was neither ship nor boat.  The lake was not frozen sufficiently to bear her; neither was it open,  nor low enough that she could wade through it; and across it she must  go if she would find her child! Then she lay down to drink up the  lake, and that was an impossibility for a human being, but the  afflicted mother thought that a miracle might happen nevertheless.    \"Oh, what would I not give to come to my child!\" said the weeping  mother; and she wept still more, and her eyes sunk down in the depths  of the waters, and became two precious pearls; but the water bore her  up, as if she sat in a swing, and she flew in the rocking waves to the  shore on the opposite side, where there stood a mile-broad, strange  house, one knew not if it were a mountain with forests and caverns, or  if it were built up; but the poor mother could not see it; she had  wept her eyes out.    \"Where shall I find Death, who took away my little child?\" said she.    \"He has not come here yet!\" said the old grave woman, who was  appointed to look after Death's great greenhouse! \"How have you been  able to find the way hither? and who has helped you?\"    \"_Our Lord_ has helped me,\" said she. \"He is merciful, and you will  also be so! Where shall I find my little child?\"    \"Nay, I know not,\" said the woman, \"and you cannot see! Many flowers  and trees have withered this night; Death will soon come and plant  them over again! You certainly know that every person has his or her  life's tree or flower, just as every one happens to be settled; they  look like other plants, but they have pulsations of the heart.  Children's hearts can also beat; go after yours, perhaps you may know  your child's; but what will you give me if I tell you what you shall  do more?\"    \"I have nothing to give,\" said the afflicted mother, \"but I will go to  the world's end for you!\"    \"Nay, I have nothing to do there!\" said the woman, \"but you can give  me your long black hair; you know yourself that it is fine, and that I  like! You shall have my white hair instead! and that's always  something!\"    \"Do you demand nothing else?\" said she,--\"that I will gladly give  you!\" And she gave her her fine black hair, and got the old woman's  snow-white hair instead.    So they went into Death's great greenhouse, where flowers and trees  grew strangely into one another. There stood fine hyacinths under  glass bells, and there stood strong-stemmed peonies; there grew water  plants, some so fresh, others half sick, the water-snakes lay down on  them, and black crabs pinched their stalks. There stood beautiful  palm-trees, oaks, and plantains; there stood parsley and flowering  thyme: every tree and every flower had its name; each of them was a  human life, the human frame still lived--one in China, and another in  Greenland--round about in the world. There were large trees in small  pots, so that they stood so stunted in growth, and ready to burst the  pots; in other places, there was a little dull flower in rich mould,  with moss round about it, and it was so petted and nursed. But the  distressed mother bent down over all the smallest plants, and heard  within them how the human heart beat; and amongst millions she knew  her child's.    \"There it is!\" cried she, and stretched her hands out over a little  blue crocus, that hung quite sickly on one side.    \"Don't touch the flower!\" said the old woman, \"but place yourself  here, and when Death comes,--I expect him every moment,--do not let  him pluck the flower up, but threaten him that you will do the same  with the others. Then he will be afraid! he is responsible for them to  _Our Lord_, and no one dares to pluck them up before _He_ gives  leave.\"    All at once an icy cold rushed through the great hall, and the blind  mother could feel that it was Death that came.    \"How hast thou been able to find thy way hither?\" he asked. \"How  couldst thou come quicker than I?\"    \"I am a mother,\" said she.    And Death stretched out his long hand towards the fine little flower,  but she held her hands fast around his, so tight, and yet afraid that  she should touch one of the leaves. Then Death blew on her hands, and  she felt that it was colder than the cold wind, and her hands fell  down powerless.    \"Thou canst not do anything against me!\" said Death.    \"But that _Our Lord_ can!\" said she.    \"I only do His bidding!\" said Death. \"I am His gardener, I take all  His flowers and trees, and plant them out in the great garden of  Paradise, in the unknown land; but how they grow there, and how it is  there I dare not tell thee.\"    \"Give me back my child!\" said the mother, and she wept and prayed. At  once she seized hold of two beautiful flowers close by, with each  hand, and cried out to Death, \"I will tear all thy flowers off, for I  am in despair.\"    \"Touch them not!\" said Death. \"Thou say'st that thou art so unhappy,  and now thou wilt make another mother equally unhappy.\"    \"Another mother!\" said the poor woman, and directly let go her hold of  both the flowers.    \"There, thou hast thine eyes,\" said Death; \"I fished them up from the  lake, they shone so bright; I knew not they were thine. Take them  again, they are now brighter than before; now look down into the deep  well close by; I shall tell thee the names of the two flowers thou  wouldst have torn up, and thou wilt see their whole future life--their  whole human existence: and see what thou wast about to disturb and  destroy.\"    And she looked down into the well; and it was a happiness to see how  the one became a blessing to the world, to see how much happiness and  joy were felt everywhere. And she saw the other's life, and it was  sorrow and distress, horror, and wretchedness.    \"Both of them are God's will!\" said Death.    \"Which of them is Misfortune's flower? and which is that of  Happiness?\" asked she.    \"That I will not tell thee,\" said Death; \"but this thou shalt know  from me, that the one flower was thy own child! it was thy child's  fate thou saw'st,--thy own child's future life!\"    Then the mother screamed with terror, \"Which of them was my child?  Tell it me! save the innocent! save my child from all that misery!  rather take it away! take it into God's kingdom! Forget my tears,  forget my prayers, and all that I have done!\"    \"I do not understand thee!\" said Death. \"Wilt thou have thy child  again, or shall I go with it there, where thou dost not know!\"    Then the mother wrung her hands, fell on her knees, and prayed to our  Lord: \"Oh, hear me not when I pray against Thy will, which is the  best! hear me not! hear me not!\"    And she bowed her head down in her lap, and Death took her child and  went with it into the unknown land.
