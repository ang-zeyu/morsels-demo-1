[Illustration: Fig. 2.--Bryozoa from the Shore of the Devonian Sea that  Covered Eastern New York. _From a specimen in Yale University Museum,  prepared by Dr. Beecher._]    Sometimes it happens that shells or other small objects imbedded in  limestone have been dissolved and replaced by silica, and in such cases  it is possible to eat away the enveloping rock with acid and leave the  silicified casts. By this method specimens of shells, corals, and  bryozoans are obtained of almost lace-like delicacy, and as perfect as  if only yesterday gathered at the sea-shore. Casts of the interior of  shells, showing many details of structure, are common, and anyone who  has seen clams dug will understand how they are formed by the entrance  of mud into the empty shell.    Casts of the kernels of nuts are formed in much the same way, and  Professor E. H. Barbour has thus described the probable manner in which  this was done. When the nuts were dropped into the water of the ancient  lake the kernel rotted away, but the shell, being tough and hard, would  probably last for years under favorable circumstances. Throughout the  marls and clays of the Bad Lands (of South Dakota) there is a large  amount of potash. This is dissolved by water, and then acts upon quartz,  carrying it away in solution. This would find its way by infiltration  into the interior of the nut. At the same time with this process,  carrying lime carbonate in solution was going on, so that doubtless the  stone kernels, consisting of pretty nearly equal parts of lime and  silica, were deposited within the nuts. These kernels, of course, became  hard and flinty in time, and capable of resisting almost any amount of  weathering. Not so the organic shell; this eventually would decay away,  and so leave the filling or kernel of chalcedony and lime.[1]    [1] _Right here is the weak spot in Professor Barbour's explanation, and  an illustration of our lack of knowledge. For it is difficult to see why  the more enduring husk should not have become mineralized equally with  the cavity within._    \"Fossil leaves\" are nothing but fine casts, made in natural moulds, and  all have seen the first stages in their formation as they watched the  leaves sailing to the ground to be covered by mud or sand at the next  rain, or dropping into the water, where sooner or later they sink, as we  may see them at the bottom of any quiet woodland spring.    Impressions of leaves are among the early examples of color-printing,  for they are frequently of a darker, or even different, tint from that  of the surrounding rock, this being caused by the carbonization of  vegetable matter or to its action on iron that may have been present in  the soil or water. Besides complete mineralization, or petrifaction,  there are numerous cases of incomplete or semi-fossilization, where  modern objects, still retaining their phosphate of lime and some animal  matter even, are found buried in rock. This takes place when water  containing carbonate of lime, silica, or sometimes iron, flows over beds  of sand, cementing the grains into solid but not dense rock, and at the  same time penetrating and uniting with it such things as chance to be  buried. In this way was formed the \"fossil man\" of Guadeloupe, West  Indies, a skeleton of a modern Carib lying in recent concretionary  limestone, together with shells of existing species and fragments of  pottery. In a similar way, too, human remains in parts of Florida have,  through the infiltration of water charged with iron, become partially  converted into limonite iron ore; and yet we know that these bones have  been buried within quite recent times.    Sometimes we hear of springs or waters that \"turn things into stone,\"  but these tales are quite incorrect. Waters there are, like the  celebrated hot springs of Auvergne, France, containing so much carbonate  of lime in solution that it is readily deposited on objects placed  therein, coating them more or less thickly, according to the length of  time they are allowed to remain. This, however, is merely an  encrustation, not extending into the objects. In a similar way the  precipitation of solid material from waters of this description forms  the porous rock known as tufa, and this often encloses moss, twigs, and  other substances that are in no way to be classed with fossils.    But some streams, flowing over limestone rocks, take up considerable  carbonate of lime, and this may be deposited in water-soaked logs,  replacing more or less of the woody tissue and thus really partially  changing the wood into stone.    The very rocks themselves may consist largely of fossils; chalk, for  example, is mainly made up of the disintegrated shells of simple marine  animals called foraminifers, and the beautiful flint-like \"skeletons\" of  other small creatures termed radiolarians, minute as they are, have  contributed extensively to the formation of some strata.    Even after an object has become fossilized, it is far from certain that  it will remain in good condition until found, while the chance of its  being found at all is exceedingly small. When we remember that it is  only here and there that nature has made the contents of the rocks  accessible by turning the strata on edge, heaving them into cliffs or  furrowing them with valleys and canyons, we realize what a vast number  of pages of the fossil record must remain not only unread, but unseen.  The wonder is, not that we know so little of the history of the past,  but that we have learned so much, for not only is nature careless in  keeping the records--preserving them mostly in scattered fragments--but  after they have been laid away and sealed up in the rocks they are  subject to many accidents. Some specimens get badly flattened by the  weight of subsequently deposited strata, others are cracked and twisted  by the movements of the rocks during periods of upheaval or subsidence,  and when at last they are brought to the surface, the same sun and rain,  snow and frost, from which they once escaped, are ready to renew the  attack and crumble even the hard stone to fragments. Such, very briefly,  are some of the methods by which fossils may be formed, such are some of  the accidents by which they may be destroyed; but this description must  be taken as a mere outline and as applying mainly to vertebrates, or  backboned animals, since it is with them that we shall have to deal. It  may, however, show why it is that fossils are not more plentiful, why we  have mere hints of the existence of many animals, and why myriads of  creatures may have flourished and passed away without so much as leaving  a trace of their presence behind.      _REFERENCES_    _A very valuable and interesting article by Dr. Charles A. White,  entitled \"The Relation of Biology to Geological Investigation,\" will be  found in the Report of the United States National Museum for 1892.

This may take the  form of a wish to know how a millionaire made his first ten cents, or it  may lead to the questions--What is the oldest animal? or, What is the  first known member of the great group of backboned animals at whose head  man has placed himself? and, What did this, our primeval and  many-times-removed ancestor, look like? The question is one that has  ever been full of interest for naturalists, and Nature has been  interrogated in various ways in the hope that she might be persuaded to  yield a satisfactory answer. The most direct way has been that of  tracing back the history of animal life by means of fossil remains, but  beyond a certain point this method cannot go, since, for reasons stated  in various places in these pages, the soft bodies of primitive animals  are not preserved. To supplement this work, the embryologist has studied  the early stages of animals, as their development throws a side-light on  their past history. And, finally, there is the study of the varied forms  of invertebrates, some of which have proved to be like vertebrates in  part of their structure, while others have been revealed as vertebrates  in disguise. So far these various methods have yielded various answers,  or the replies, like those of the Delphic Oracle, have been variously  interpreted so that vertebrates are considered by some to have descended  from the worms, while others have found their beginnings in some animal  allied to the King Crab.    Every student of genealogy knows only too well how difficult a matter it  is to trace a family pedigree back a few centuries, how soon the family  names become changed, the line of descent obscure, and how soon gaps  appear whose filling in requires much patient research. How much more  difficult must it be, then, to trace the pedigree of a race that  extends, not over centuries, but thousands of centuries; how wide must  be some of the gaps, how very different may the founders of the family  be from their descendants!
