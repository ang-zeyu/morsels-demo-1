Next morning I was up betimes, eager to make acquaintance with my new  surroundings. My first impression on coming out of my hut was that I  was hemmed in on all sides by a dense growth of impenetrable jungle:  and on scrambling to the top of a little hill close at hand, I found  that the whole country as far as I could see was covered with low,  stunted trees, thick undergrowth and \"wait-a-bit\" thorns. The only  clearing, indeed, appeared to be where the narrow track for the railway  had been cut. This interminable nyika, or wilderness of whitish and  leafless dwarf trees, presented a ghastly and sun-stricken appearance;  and here and there a ridge of dark-red heat-blistered rock jutted out  above the jungle, and added by its rugged barrenness to the dreariness  of the picture. Away to the north-east stretched the unbroken line of  the N'dungu Escarpment, while far off to the south I could just catch a  glimpse of the snow-capped top of towering Kilima N'jaro. The one  redeeming feature of the neighbourhood was the river from which Tsavo  takes its name. This is a swiftly-flowing stream, always cool and  always running, the latter being an exceptional attribute in this part  of East Africa; and the fringe of lofty green trees along its banks  formed a welcome relief to the general monotony of the landscape.    When I had thus obtained a rough idea of the neighbourhood, I returned  to my hut, and began in earnest to make preparations for my stay in  this out-of-the-way place. The stores were unpacked, and my \"boys\"  pitched my tent in a little clearing close to where I had slept the  night before and not far from the main camp of the workmen. Railhead  had at this time just reached the western side of the river, and some  thousands of Indian coolies and other workmen were encamped there. As  the line had to be pushed on with all speed, a diversion had been made  and the river crossed by means of a temporary bridge. My principal work  was to erect the permanent structure, and to complete all the other  works for a distance of thirty miles on each side of Tsavo. I  accordingly made a survey of what had to be done, and sent my  requisition for labour, tools and material to the head-quarters at  Kilindini. In a short time workmen and supplies came pouring in, and  the noise of hammers and sledges, drilling and blasting echoed merrily  through the district.          CHAPTER II    THE FIRST APPEARANCE OF THE MAN-EATERS      Unfortunately this happy state of affairs did not continue for long,  and our work was soon interrupted in a rude and startling manner. Two  most voracious and insatiable man-eating lions appeared upon the scene,  and for over nine months waged an intermittent warfare against the  railway and all those connected with it in the vicinity of Tsavo. This  culminated in a perfect reign of terror in December, 1898, when they  actually succeeded in bringing the railway works to a complete  standstill for about three weeks. At first they were not always  successful in their efforts to carry off a victim, but as time went on  they stopped at nothing and indeed braved any danger in order to obtain  their favourite food. Their methods then became so uncanny, and their  man-stalking so well-timed and so certain of success, that the workmen  firmly believed that they were not real animals at all, but devils in  lions' shape. Many a time the coolies solemnly assured me that it was  absolutely useless to attempt to shoot them. They were quite convinced  that the angry spirits of two departed native chiefs had taken this  form in order to protest against a railway being made through their  country, and by stopping its progress to avenge the insult thus shown  to them.    I had only been a few days at Tsavo when I first heard that these  brutes had been seen in the neighbourhood. Shortly afterwards one or  two coolies mysteriously disappeared, and I was told that they had been  carried off by night from their tents and devoured by lions. At the  time I did not credit this story, and was more inclined to believe that  the unfortunate men had been the victims of foul play at the hands of  some of their comrades. They were, as it happened, very good workmen,  and had each saved a fair number of rupees, so I thought it quite  likely that some scoundrels from the gangs had murdered them for the  sake of their money. This suspicion, however, was very soon dispelled.  About three weeks after my arrival, I was roused one morning about  daybreak and told that one of my jemadars, a fine powerful Sikh named  Ungan Singh, had been seized in his tent during the night, and dragged  off and eaten.    Naturally I lost no time in making an examination of the place, and was  soon convinced that the man had indeed been carried off by a lion, as  its \"pug\" marks were plainly visible in the sand, while the furrows  made by the heels of the victim showed the direction in which he had  been dragged away. Moreover, the jemadar shared his tent with half a  dozen other workmen, and one of his bedfellows had actually witnessed  the occurrence. He graphically described how, at about midnight, the  lion suddenly put its head in at the open tent door and seized Ungan  Singh--who happened to be nearest the opening--by the throat. The  unfortunate fellow cried out \"Choro\" (\"Let go\"), and threw his arms up  round the lion's neck. The next moment he was gone, and his  panic-stricken companions lay helpless, forced to listen to the  terrible struggle which took place outside. Poor Ungan Singh must have  died hard; but what chance had he? As a coolie gravely remarked, \"Was  he not fighting with a lion?\"    On hearing this dreadful story I at once set out to try to track the  animal, and was accompanied by Captain Haslem, who happened to be  staying at Tsavo at the time, and who, poor fellow, himself met with a  tragic fate very shortly afterwards. We found it an easy matter to  follow the route taken by the lion, as he appeared to have stopped  several times before beginning his meal. Pools of blood marked these  halting-places, where he doubtless indulged in the man-eaters' habit of  licking the skin off so as to get at the fresh blood. (I have been led  to believe that this is their custom from the appearance of two  half-eaten bodies which I subsequently rescued: the skin was gone in  places, and the flesh looked dry, as if it had been sucked.) On  reaching the spot where the body had been devoured, a dreadful  spectacle presented itself. The ground all round was covered with blood  and morsels of flesh and bones, but the unfortunate jemadar's head had  been left intact, save for the holes made by the lion's tusks on  seizing him, and lay a short distance away from the other remains, the  eyes staring wide open with a startled, horrified look in them. The  place was considerably cut up, and on closer examination we found that  two lions had been there and had probably struggled for possession of  the body. It was the most gruesome sight I had ever seen. We collected  the remains as well as we could and heaped stones on them, the head  with its fixed, terrified stare seeming to watch us all the time, for  it we did not bury, but took back to camp for identification before the  Medical Officer.    Thus occurred my first experience of man-eating lions, and I vowed  there and then that I would spare no pains to rid the neighbourhood of  the brutes. I little knew the trouble that was in store for me, or how  narrow were to be my own escapes from sharing poor Ungan Singh's fate.    That same night I sat up in a tree close to the late jemadar's tent,  hoping that the lions would return to it for another victim. I was  followed to my perch by a few of the more terrified coolies, who begged  to be allowed to sit up in the tree with me; all the other workmen  remained in their tents, but no more doors were left open. I had with  me my .303 and a 12-bore shot gun, one barrel loaded with ball and the  other with slug. Shortly after settling down to my vigil, my hopes of  bagging one of the brutes were raised by the sound of their ominous  roaring coming closer and closer. Presently this ceased, and quiet  reigned for an hour or two, as lions always stalk their prey in  complete silence. All at once, however, we heard a great uproar and  frenzied cries coming from another camp about half a mile away; we knew  then that the lions had seized a victim there, and that we should see  or hear nothing further of them that night.    Next morning I found that one of the brutes had broken into a tent at  Railhead Camp--whence we had heard the commotion during the night--and  had made off with a poor wretch who was lying there asleep. After a  night's rest, therefore, I took up my position in a suitable tree near  this tent. I did not at all like the idea of walking the half-mile to  the place after dark, but all the same I felt fairly safe, as one of my  men carried a bright lamp close behind me. He in his turn was followed  by another leading a goat, which I tied under my tree in the hope that  the lion might be tempted to seize it instead of a coolie. A steady  drizzle commenced shortly after I had settled down to my night of  watching, and I was soon thoroughly chilled and wet. I stuck to my  uncomfortable post, however, hoping to get a shot, but I well remember  the feeling of impotent disappointment I experienced when about  midnight I heard screams and cries and a heart-rending shriek, which  told me that the man-eaters had again eluded me and had claimed another  victim elsewhere.    At this time the various camps for the workmen were very scattered, so  that the lions had a range of some eight miles on either side of Tsavo  to work upon; and as their tactics seemed to be to break into a  different camp each night, it was most difficult to forestall them.  They almost appeared, too, to have an extraordinary and uncanny faculty  of finding out our"]]]
