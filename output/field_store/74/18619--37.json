[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3407"],[0,"The Spell of Egypt (#4)"],[1,"I feel very far away, as a child feels distance from  dear, familiar things. I look to the horizon expectant of I know not  what magical occurrences, what mysteries. I am aware of the summons to  advance to marvellous lands, where marvellous things must happen. I am  taken by that sensation of almost trembling magic which came to me  when first I saw a mirage far out in the Sahara. But Egypt, though  it contains so many marvels, has no longer for me the marvellous  atmosphere. Its keynote is seductiveness.    In Egypt one feels very safe. Smiling policemen in clothes of spotless  white--emblematic, surely, of their innocence!--seem to be everywhere,  standing calmly in the sun. Very gentle, very tender, although perhaps  not very true, are the Bedouins at the Pyramids. Up the Nile the  fellaheen smile as kindly as the policemen, smile protectingly upon  you, as if they would say, \"Allah has placed us here to take care of the  confiding stranger.\" No ferocious demands for money fall upon my ears;  only an occasional suggestion is subtly conveyed to me that even the  poor must live and that I am immensely rich. An amiable, an almost  enticing seductiveness seems emanating from the fertile soil, shining  in the golden air, gleaming softly in the amber sands, dimpling in the  brown, the mauve, the silver eddies of the Nile. It steals upon one. It  ripples over one. It laps one as if with warm and scented waves. A sort  of lustrous languor overtakes one. In physical well-being one sinks  down, and with wide eyes one gazes and listens and enjoys, and thinks  not of the morrow.    The dahabiyeh--her very name, the _Loulia_, has a gentle, seductive,  cooing sound--drifts broadside to the current with furled sails, or  glides smoothly on before an amiable north wind with sails unfurled.  Upon the bloomy banks, rich brown in color, the brown men stoop and  straighten themselves, and stoop again, and sing. The sun gleams on  their copper skins, which look polished and metallic. Crouched in his  net behind the drowsy oxen, the little boy circles the livelong day with  the sakieh. And the sakieh raises its wailing, wayward voice and sings  to the shadoof; and the shadoof sings to the sakieh; and the lifted  water falls and flows away into the green wilderness of doura that, like  a miniature forest, spreads on every hand to the low mountains, which do  not perturb the spirit, as do the iron mountains of Algeria. And always  the sun is shining, and the body is drinking in its warmth, and the soul  is drinking in its gold. And always the ears are full of warm and drowsy  and monotonous music. And always the eyes see the lines of brown bodies,  on the brown river-banks above the brown waters, bending, straightening,  bending, straightening, with an exquisitely precise monotony. And always  the _Loulia_ seems to be drifting, so quietly she slips up, or down, the  level waterway.    And one drifts, too; one can but drift, happily, sleepily, forgetting  every care. From Abydos to Denderah one drifts, and from Denderah to  Karnak, to Luxor, to all the marvels on the western shore; and on  to Edfu, to Kom Ombos, to Assuan, and perhaps even into Nubia, to  Abu-Simbel, and to Wadi-Halfa. Life on the Nile is a long dream, golden  and sweet as honey of Hymettus. For I let the \"divine serpent,\" who at  Philae may be seen issuing from her charmed cavern, take me very quietly  to see the abodes of the dead, the halls of the vanished, upon her green  and sterile shores. I know nothing of the bustling, shrieking  steamer that defies her, churning into angry waves her waters for the  edification of those who would \"do\" Egypt and be gone before they know  her.    If you are in a hurry, do not come to Egypt. To hurry in Egypt is as  wrong as to fall asleep in Wall street, or to sit in the Greek Theatre  at Taormina, reading \"How to Make a Fortune with a Capital of Fifty  Pounds.\"          VI    DENDERAH    From Abydos, home of the cult of Osiris, Judge of the Dead, I came  to Denderah, the great temple of the \"Lady of the Underworld,\" as the  goddess Hathor was sometimes called, though she was usually worshipped  as the Egyptian Aphrodite, goddess of joy, goddess of love and  loveliness. It was early morning when I went ashore. The sun was above  the eastern hills, and a boy, clad in a rope of plaited grass, sent me  half shyly the greeting, \"May your day be happy!\"    Youth is, perhaps, the most divine of all the gifts of the gods, as  those who wore the lotus-blossom amulet believed thousands of years ago,  and Denderah, appropriately, is a very young Egyptian temple,  probably, indeed, the youngest of all the temples on the Nile. Its  youthfulness--it is only about two thousand years of age--identifies it  happily with the happiness and beauty of its presiding deity, and as I  rode toward it on the canal-bank in the young freshness of the morning,  I thought of the goddess Safekh and of the sacred Persea-tree. When  Safekh inscribed upon a leaf of the Persea-tree the name of king or  conqueror, he gained everlasting life. Was it the life of youth? An  everlasting life of middle age might be a doubtful benefit. And then  mentally I added, \"unless one lived in Egypt.\" For here the years drop  from one, and every golden hour brings to one surely another drop of  the wondrous essence that sets time at defiance and charms sad thoughts  away.    Unlike White Abydos, White Denderah stands apart from habitations, in  a still solitude upon a blackened mound. From far off I saw the facade,  large, bare, and sober, rising, in a nakedness as complete as that of  Aphrodite rising from the wave, out of the plain of brown, alluvial soil  that was broken here and there by a sharp green of growing things. There  was something of sadness in the scene, and again I thought of Hathor as  the \"Lady of the Underworld,\" some deep-eyed being, with a pale brow,  hair like the night, and yearning, wistful hands stretched out in  supplication. There was a hush upon this place. The loud and vehement  cry of the shadoof-man died away. The sakieh droned in my ears no more  like distant Sicilian pipes playing at Natale. I felt a breath from the  desert. And, indeed, the desert was near--that realistic desert which  suggests to the traveller approaches to the sea, so that beyond each  pallid dune, as he draws near it, he half expects to hear the lapping of  the waves. Presently, when, having ascended that marvellous staircase  of the New Year, walking in procession with the priests upon its walls  toward the rays of Ra, I came out upon the temple roof, and looked upon  the desert--upon sheeny sands, almost like slopes of satin shining  in the sun, upon paler sands in the distance, holding an Arab _campo  santo_, in which rose the little creamy cupolas of a sheikh's tomb,  surrounded by a creamy wall, those little cupolas gave to me a feeling  of the real, the irresistible Africa such as I had not known since I had  been in Egypt; and I thought I heard in the distance the ceaseless hum  of praying and praising voices.    \"God hath rewarded the faithful with gardens through which flow  rivulets. They shall be for ever therein, and that is the reward of the  virtuous.\"    The sensation of solemnity which overtook me as I approached the temple  deepened when I drew close to it, when I stood within it. In the first  hall, mighty, magnificent, full of enormous columns from which faces of  Hathor once looked to the four points of the compass, I found only one  face almost complete, saved from the fury of fanatics by the protection  of the goddess of chance, in whom the modern Egyptian so implicitly  believes. In shape it was a delicate oval. In the long eyes, about the  brow, the cheeks, there was a strained expression that suggested to me  more than a gravity--almost an anguish--of spirit. As I looked at it, I  thought of Eleanora Duse. Was this the ideal of joy in the time of the  Ptolemies? Joy may be rapturous, or it may be serene; but could it ever  be like this? The pale, delicious blue that here and there, in tiny  sections, broke the almost haggard, greyish whiteness of this first hall  with the roof of black, like bits of an evening sky seen through tiny  window-slits in a sombre room, suggested joy, was joy summed up in  color. But Hathor's face was weariful and sad.    From the gloom of the inner halls came a sound, loud, angry, menacing,  as I walked on, a sound of menace and an odor, heavy and deathlike.  Only in the first hall had those builders and decorators of two thousand  years ago been moved by their conception of the goddess to hail her,  to worship her, with the purity of white, with the sweet gaiety of  turquoise. Or so it seems to-day, when the passion of Christianity  against Hathor has spent itself and died. Now Christians come to seek  what Christian Copts destroyed; wander through the deserted courts,  desirous of looking upon the faces that have long since been hacked to  pieces. A more benign spirit informs our world, but, alas! Hathor has  been sacrificed to deviltries of old. And it is well, perhaps, that her  temple should be sad, like a place of silent waiting for the glories  that are gone.    With every step my melancholy grew. Encompassed by gloomy odors,  assailed by the clamour of gigantic bats, which flew furiously among the  monstrous pillars near a roof ominous as a storm-cloud, my spirit was  haunted by the sad eyes of Hathor, which gaze for ever from that column  in the first hall. Were they always like that? Once that face dwelt with  a crowd of worship. And all the other faces have gone, and all the glory  has passed. And, like so many of the living, the goddess has paid for  her splendors. The pendulum swung, and where men adored, men hated  her--her the goddess of love and loveliness. And as the human face  changes when terror and sorrow come, I felt as if Hathor's face of stone  had changed upon its column, looking toward"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34076"],[0,"Fox Trapping: A Book of Instruction Telling How to Trap, Snare, Poison and Shoot (#4)"],[1,"has been said pro and con relative to trapping that most wary of  our wild animals, the red fox. A few incidents pertaining thereto  that have come under my observation may be worthy of mention, says J.  A. Newton, of Michigan.    There are practically three conditions under which trapping the fox  may be done. First, by setting in beds, so called, of dry chaff or  ashes before snow falls; secondly, in snow during the coldest  weather, and lastly spring water setting as some writers have  described.    I shall confine myself to the two first mentioned conditions. In the  first instance a spread of chaff or ashes covering three or four feet  of space is made where foxes are known to travel. As a rule the most  acceptable bait is lard scraps, suet, smoked meat rinds, etc. These  are scattered in small bits in the bed, and as a lure nothing can be  more efficacious than a few drops sprinkled in the bed composed of  the female fox gland taken in the rutting season that has been  dissolved in alcohol. It must be kept tightly corked. The same taken  from the female dog at this period is about as potent.    The traps must first be thoroughly smoked with some resinous twigs or  corn cob, or be boiled in ashes to eradicate the scent of iron, rust,  and of other game that has been caught. After this do not handle  traps or bait except with gloves.      [Illustration: AWAITING THE TRAPPER.]    All old trappers in my section bait a fox a few nights before placing  the trap, as the more visits Reynard makes to the bed, and devouring  bait without having his suspicions aroused, the more reckless does he  become and the easier is he taken when at last the trap is placed.    One old trapper, who is very successful, does not set his traps until  some night when the first snowfall is at hand. The new white mantle  covers the bed and all human sign made in setting the trap. The clog  should have been previously placed some days before so that the fox  will become accustomed to the sight of it. The fox has not forgotten  the exact location of the bed with its tidbits and comes to it with  unerring precision even when covered by snow, and unless he by good  luck kicks the trap over and springs it he now comes to grief.    Old man Titus says: \"Having nailed the game don't kill on the spot  but drag him off a ways. Then don't leave the carcass lying round  conspicuous or it will scare the rest out of the neighborhood.\"    My first insight into the manner of snow trapping I gained from a man  named Williams. Several of his sheep concluded to part company with  this cold unappreciative world, and their owner determined to make  them still serve a purpose. Hauling them off in as many directions as  there were of the dead, he left them until deep snow and severe  weather came, cutting off much of the natural prey of the fox which  reduced him to seeking carrion. After their inroads on the bait had  become well established, Williams placed a trap at each of the  remains, covering a little snow over them and stapling to pieces of  fence rails previously placed.    \"Now,\" said Williams, \"the only thing to do is to keep away from here  two or three days until a little more snow falls to cover our sign,  or is drifted a little by the wind.\" He used no scent of any kind,  saying that \"starvation is the best lure in the world.\" \"All I do is  to smoke the traps and not handle barehanded,\" he added.    After two or three days of snow flurrying weather we visited the  traps and noted that one was missing. We could see a dim trail where  it had been dragged away. We followed and found the fox in a drift.  He was poor and had frozen hard. Five were taken at the sheep bait  inside of two weeks, after which there came a thaw stopping further  snow trapping.    One old trapper tells of a fox that came near outwitting him, being  not only the most cunning but also possessing a degree of meanness  almost satanic. \"I baited him in a bed of chaff several nights,\" said  he, \"and then set my trap. The trap could not have contained scent,  but the old chap appeared to know it was there; he carefully nosed  out and devoured every scrap of bait, and then as deftly dug the trap  out, turned it over and sprung it and left a soiling evidence of his  scorn and contempt for me upon it. That I was mad you needn't doubt  for a minute.  I tried setting three and four traps, hoping he'd make  a miscue and get into some one of them, but no, he was too smart, he  sprung them all each night and insulted me besides. All at once the  thought struck me like a brick, I'll set the trap bottom side up.  This I did, removing all the traps but one. \"The cat came back\" and  as before turned the trap, bringing it right side up. I had set it  full catch so that it would spring rather hard. He slipped a cog in  not taking into account that the trap didn't spring when he turned  it; when bestowing his disdain a too close contact brought a sharp  click and he was fast. I never saw so sneaking and beat out an animal  in my life. He would like to have had the ground open up and swallow  him if it could.\"    An acquaintance of mine who is a settler in Northern Michigan heard a  great squealing and commotion among his hogs one night late in  November, and bounced out just in time to see a large bear drop one  of his shoats as it passed through the bars. The porker was stone  dead, being bitten through the nape of the neck. The settler, whose  name is Clark, drew the pig into the woods and left it between two  fallen trees. With his axe he chopped a niche large enough to contain  a trap, when set, from each of the logs; a piece of moss was  carefully fitted over each cavity and all of the chips were removed.    Foxes there are very numerous, and Clark soon noticed that the bait  was being sampled; he knew the fox nature in that they have a habit  of walking logs or on the highest points when investigating an  attraction. When the tracks to and from and circling the bait became  frequent Clark placed a trap on each log, covering them neatly with  patches of moss; the chain was fastened to clogs concealed under the  logs, and the chains were hidden with strips of moss. Upon his first  visit to the traps, two days later, the trapper found a fox in each  trap, and several more were taken before crows and other scavengers  had polished the bones of the bait.      [Illustration: AFTER THE CHASE.]    On the quiet, boys, I will say that it requires so much preparation,  caution and patience to successfully trap the red fox that I have  more frequently resorted to the hound and shotgun; by this means I  have often taken the jacket of a cunning old dog fox, after running  him over the hills an hour or two, that it would have taken much time  and patience to trap. After one gets the runways learned, and if he  possesses a good gun that loads properly, and is a tolerably fair  shot at running game, the means is much quicker. It is like digging  out a nest of skunks as against the slow process of trapping one at a  time.      * * *    I had a little experience with a sly old female fox last winter, says  Claude Roora, of Ohio. I had noticed on early snows where this old  fox had two holes under an old rail fence where she would pass  through every night, and also a stone beside a sheep path where she  would stop. I picked out those three places to set traps for her  under the next snow.    One morning I thought it looked as though it was fixing for a snow. I  got three No. 2 Victor traps and told my wife I was going to catch  that old fox that night if it snowed. I went to the three places and  was very careful not to tear things up any more than just to dig  places the size of the traps. I had grapnels fastened to chains and  dug holes deep enough to bury them, so that when the traps were set  on top of them it would be just a little below level of the surface  of the ground, and covered all up with dead grapevine leaves. About  the time I got the last trap set it commenced snowing and quit  snowing before dark.      [Illustration: TRAP AND GRAPNEL.]    Next morning I went early to get my fox before the hound men got out,  thinking sure I would have her. When I got within one hundred yards  of set No. 1 I saw her tracks leading straight to it. She went up  within five or six feet of the trap, turned short off to the right  and went down to set No. 2, went up within five or six inches of trap  where she turned short off to the right again, made a few jumps down  the hill, jumped over top of fence, circle back up the hill to sheep  path, followed it out to set No. 3. She went up to this trap, raked  every bit of snow and leaves off of trap and left trap bare and in  plain sight, not even springing trap. I covered trap up again  thinking I might fool some other fox, but in about half an hour the  hounds came along on her track and one of them set his foot in the  trap and his owner let him loose and threw the trap away.    The hounds followed the fox up over the hill, routed it and ran it  about an hour and holed it under a big rock, and the men went off and  left it. Now the hounds had been in the habit of holing this fox  under the same rock, and the most of us know that when a pack of  hounds hole a fox they generally tear things up some. In other words,  they leave some signs. I set the traps as nice as I knew how, and  when I went back the next morning traps were turned upside-down and  fox gone.    So I concluded I would follow the track and see if I couldn't find  her asleep and shoot her, but had not gone far when I found the snow  had drifted so I could not follow her. I came back home discouraged.  Next morning I thought I would go and see if she had been back on the  hill. When I got to set No. 2 I saw where she had come up from the  opposite side from what she had been in the habit of doing and stuck  her right foot square in the trap. She went about one hundred yards  where she got"]]]
