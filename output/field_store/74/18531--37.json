Their nesting habits are the  same as those of the other Auklets, they placing their single white egg  on the bare rocks, in crevices on the cliffs. Size 1.55 x 1.10.  Data.--Pribilof Is., Alaska, June 8, 1897. Single egg laid in crevice.  Thousands breeding on the island.      21. ANCIENT MURRELET. _Synthliboramphus antiquus._    Range.--Pacific Coast, breeding from the border of the United States,  northward, and wintering south to southern California.    The Murrelets have no crests or plumes and the bills are more slender  than the Auklets and are not highly colored. The ancient Murrelet or  Black-throated Murrelet, as it is also called, has a gray back, white  under parts and a black head and throat, with a broad white stripe back  of the eye and another formed by the white on the breast extending up on  the side of the neck. They breed abundantly on the islands in Bering  Sea, laying one or two eggs at the end of burrows in the banks or on the  ground, and in some localities in crevices on the cliffs. The eggs are a  buffy white color and are faintly marked with light brown, some of these  being in the shape of spots and others lengthened. Size 2.40 x 1.40.  Data.--Sanak Islands, July 1, 1894. Two eggs on the ground under a tuft  of grass and in a slight excavation lined with fine grass.    [Illustration: Least Auklet. Ancient Murrelet. Marbled Murrelet.]  [Illustration: White.]  [Illustration: Buff.]  [Illustration: left hand margin.]    Page 27    23. MARBLED MURRELET. _Brachyramphus marmoratus._    Range.--North Pacific Coast, breeding from Vancouver Island. South in  winter to southern California.    In the breeding plumage, this bird is brownish black above, barred with  rusty and below is marbled with brownish gray and white. Its nesting  habits and eggs are very similar to those of the Ancient Murrelet, they  placing their single eggs in holes in the ground or crevices among the  cliffs. Size 2.20 x 1.40. Data.--Chichagof Is., Alaska, June 18, 1898.  Single egg in crevice on face of cliff. Large colony breeding in company  with Ancient Murrelets.      24. KITTLITZ MURRELET. _Brachyramphus brevirostris._    Range.--North Pacific Coast in the Aleutian Islands and north to  Unalaska, breeding on isolated islands throughout its range. This  species is very similar to the Marbled Murrelet, the chief difference  being in the bill which is shorted. They have been found breeding on the  same islands with the preceding species. Their single white egg is laid  in crevices in the cliffs. Size 2.40 x 1.30. Data.--Sanak Is., Alaska,  June 25, 1890. Nest in a hollow under a bunch of rank matted grass. Many  ancient Burrelets breeding on the same Islands. Collector, Capt. Tilson.      25. XANTUS MURRELET. _Brachyramphus hypoleucus._    Range.--Resident along the coast of southern and Lower California.    This bird is blackish above and entirely white below, including the  sides of the head below the eye. The whole of the under surface of the  wing is also white. They breed on the coast islands from Santa Barbara  southward. The single egg is laid at the end of a burrow or in crevices  among the rocks. It is a pale buffy white in color and thickly, but  finely dotted over the whole surface with purplish brown, and with some  larger spots at the larger end. Size 2.05 x 1.40. Data.--Galapagos  Islands, March 2, 1901. No nest. Single egg laid in a crevice in the  rocks. Collector, Rollo H. Beck.    [Illustration 029: Buff.]  [Illustration: White.]  [Illustration: Pale Blue.]  [Illustration: right hand margin.]    Page 28    26. CRAVERI'S MURRELET. _Brachyramphus craveri._    Range.--Both coasts of Lower California, breeding chiefly on the Gulf  side. Craveri Murrelet is very similar to the last except that the under  surfaces of the wings are dusky. Breeds on the islands near Cape St.  Lucas, burrowing in the ground as do most of the others of this species.  They lay a single egg, the ground color of which is buff; they are quite  heavily blotched with brownish. Size 2.00 x 1.40.    27. BLACK GUILLEMOT. _Cepphus grylle._      Range.--Coasts and islands of the North Atlantic, breeding from Maine  northward to southern Greenland. Guillemots are larger birds than the  Murrelets (length 13 inches) and their plumage is entirely different.  This species in summer is entirely black except the wing coverts which  are white. The bases of the greater coverts, however, are black, this  generally breaking the white mirror as it is called. The under surfaces  of the wings are white. Legs red. These birds breed abundantly on the  rocky islands and high cliffs along the coast. Soon after the first of  June the eggs are laid in the crevices of the rocks and sometimes upon  the bare ledges. Two or three eggs make the set. The ground color is a  pale bluish or greenish white and the markings are various shades of  brown and black. Size 2.40 x 1.60. Data.--Grand Manan, June 15, 1896.  Two eggs laid in a cavity back of large boulder. No nest. Collector, D.  H. Eaton.    [Illustration 030: Xantus Murrelet. Mandt's Guillemot.]  [Illustration: Bluish white.]  [Illustration: Black Guillemot.]  [Illustration: left hand margin.]    Page 29    28. MANDT'S GUILLEMOT. _Cepphus mandti._    Range.--North Atlantic coast, more northerly than the preceding,  breeding from Labrador to northern Greenland.    The bird differs from the Black Guillemot only in having the bases of  the coverts white also. The nesting habits and eggs are identical. They  nest in colonies of thousands and place the eggs upon the bare rock with  no attempt at nest building. Generally the eggs are in the crevices so  as to be difficult to get at. Size 2.30 x 1.55. Data.--Depot Island,  Hudson Bay, June 6, 1894. Two eggs laid on bare rocky ground. Collector  John Comer.      29. PIGEON GUILLEMOT. _Cepphus columba._    Range.--The Pacific Coast of North America, breeding from southern  California northward. This bird is very similar to the Black Guillemot  except that the under surfaces of the wings are dark. They breed  abundantly on some of the islands of Bering Sea and a few of them nest  on the Farallones. They lay their two eggs on the bare rock in dark  crevices. The color is grayish or pale greenish blue and the markings  are brown and black with paler shell markings of lilac. Size 2.40 x  1.60. Data.--S. Farallone Islands, Cal. Two eggs laid on gravel at the  end of a burrow, about two feet from the entrance and 285 feet above the  sea level. Collector, Claude Fyfe.      30. MURRE. _Uria troile troille._    Range.--North Atlantic coasts and islands, breeding from Bird Rock  northward. Murres are similar in form to the Guillemots, but are larger,  being about 16 inches in length. Entire head and neck sooty brown; rest  of upper parts grayish black except the tips of the secondaries which  are white. Under parts white. These birds nest by thousands on Bird Rock  and on the cliffs of Labrador. They build no nests but simply lay their  single egg on the narrow ledges of cliffs, where the only guarantee  against its rolling off is its peculiar shape which causes it, when  moved, to revolve about its smaller end instead of rolling off the  ledge. The eggs are laid as closely as possible on the ledges where the  incubating birds sit upright, in long rows like an army on guard. As  long as each bird succeeds in finding an egg to cover, on its return  home, it is doubtful if they either know or care whether it is their own  or not. The ground color of the eggs vary from white to a deep greenish  blue and the markings of blackish brown vary in endless patterns, some  eggs being almost wholly unspotted. Size 3.40 x 2.00. Data.--South  Labrador, June 19, 1884. Single egg laid on the bare cliff. Large colony  breeding. Collector, M. A. Grasar.    [Illustration 031: Murre.]  [Illustration: Pale bluish gray.]  [Illustration: right hand margin.]    Page 30    30a. CALIFORNIA MURRE. _Uria troille californica._    Range.--Pacific Coast, breeding from the Farallones north to Alaska.    This Pacific form of the common Murre is the most abundant breeding bird  on the Farallones. Their eggs are used in enormous numbers for  commercial purposes and these islands being located, as they are, within  easy distance from San Francisco, thousands of dozens of the eggs are  sold yearly, chiefly to bakeries. Although continually robbed, their  numbers have not as yet diminished to any great extent. They lay but a  single egg on the bare ledge. Individual eggs are indistinguishable from  the last species but in a large series the ground color averages  brighter. They show the same great difference in color and markings. The  first set is laid in May, but owing to their being so often molested,  fresh eggs can be found during August. Data.--Farallones, July 4, 1895.  Single egg laid on bare cliff. Collector, Thos. E. Slevin.      31. BRUNNICH MURRE. _Uria lomvia lomvia._    Range.--North Atlantic Coast, breeding range the same as the common  Murre.    This species differs from the common Murre in having a shorter and  thicker bill, the base of the cutting edge of which is less feathered.  They breed on the same islands in company with the common Murre and  their eggs are indistinguishable. Data.--Coast of South Labrador. Single  egg laid on ledge of cliff. About three hundred birds in the colony.    [Illustration 032: Varies from white to greenish blue.]  [Illustration: left hand margin.]    Page 31    31a. PALLAS MURRE. _Uria lomvia arra._    Range.--The Pacific coasts and islands.    This is the Pacific form of Brunnich Murre. Its breeding range is more  northerly than that of the California variety. Countless thousands of  them breed on the islands off the coast of Alaska, their breeding habits  and eggs being the same as the more southern form.      32.

The next Hellenistic source of which we must take note is a fragmentary  and almost unintelligible chapter in the works of Hero of Alexandria.  Alone and unconnected with his other chapters this describes a model  which seems to be static, in direct contrast to all other devices which  move by pneumatic and hydrostatic pressures; it may well be conjectured  that in its original form this chapter described a mechanized rather  than a static globe:      The World represented in the Centre of the Universe: The    construction of a transparent globe containing air and    liquid, and also of a smaller globe, in the centre, in    imitation of the World. Two hemispheres of glass are made;    one of them is covered with a plate of bronze, in the    middle of which is a round hole. To fit this hole a light    ball, of small size, is constructed, and thrown into the    water contained in the other hemisphere: the covered    hemisphere is next applied to this, and, a certain    quantity of the liquid having been removed from the water,    the intermediate space will contain the ball; thus by the    application of the second hemisphere what was proposed is    accomplished.        _Pneumatics_, XLVI, Woodcroft's translation.    It will be noted that these earliest literary references are concerned  with pictorial, 3-dimensional models of the universe, moved perhaps by  hand, perhaps by waterpower; there is no evidence that they contained  complicated trains of gears, and in the absence of this we may incline  to the view that in at least the earliest such models, gearing was not  used.    The next developments were concerned on the one hand with increasing the  mathematical sophistication of the model, on the other hand with its  mechanical complexity. In both cases we are most fortunate in having  archaeological evidence which far exceeds any literary sources.    The mathematical process of mapping a sphere onto a plane surface by  stereographic projection was introduced by Hipparchus and had much  influence on astronomical techniques and instruments thereafter. In  particular, by the time of Ptolemy (_ca._ A.D. 120) it had led to the  successive inventions of the anaphoric clock and of the planispheric  astrolabe.[12] Both these devices consist of a pair of stereographic  projections, one of the celestial sphere with its stars and ecliptic and  tropics, the other of the lines of altitude and azimuth as set for an  observer in a place at some particular latitude.    In the astrolabe, an openwork metal rete containing markings for the  stars, etc., may be rotated by hand over a disc on which the lines of  altitude and azimuth are inscribed. In the anaphoric clock a disc  engraved with the stars is rotated automatically behind a fixed grille  of wires marking lines of altitude and azimuth. Power for rotating the  disc is provided by a float rising in a clepsydra jar and connected, by  a rope or chain passing over a pulley to a counterweight or by a rack  and pinion, to an axle which supported the rotating disc and  communicated this motion to it.[13]    [Illustration: Figure 5. PLATE OF SALZBURG ANAPHORIC CLOCK, a  reconstruction (see footnote 14) based on a photograph of the remaining  fragment. (_Courtesy of Oxford University Press._)]    Parts of two such discs from anaphoric clocks have been found, one at  Salzburg[14] and one at Grand in the Vosges,[15] both of them dating  from the 2nd century A.D. Fortunately there is sufficient evidence to  reconstruct the Salzburg disc and show that it must have been originally  about 170 cm. in diameter, a heavy sheet of bronze to be turned by the  small power provided by a float, and a large and impressive device when  working (see fig. 5). Literary accounts of the anaphoric clock have been  analyzed by Drachmann; there is no evidence of the representation of  planets moved either by hand or by automatic gearing, only in the  important case of the sun was such a feature included of necessity. A  model \"sun\" on a pin could be plugged in to any one of 360 holes drilled  in at equal intervals along the band of the ecliptic. This pin could be  moved each day so that the anaphoric clock kept step with the seasonal  variation of the times of sunrise and sunset and the lengths of day and  night.    The anaphoric clock is not only the origin of the astrolabe and of all  later planetary models, it is also the first clock dial, setting a  standard for \"clockwise\" rotation, and leaving its mark in the rotating  dial and stationary pointer found on the earliest time-keeping clocks  before the change was made to a fixed dial and moving hand.    We come finally to a piece of archaeological evidence that surpasses all  else. Though badly preserved and little studied it might well be the  most important classical object ever found; entailing a complete  re-estimation of the technical prowess of the Hellenistic Greeks. In  1901 a sunken treasure ship was discovered lying off the island of  Antikythera, between Greece and Crete.[16] Many beautiful classical  works of statuary were recovered from it, and these are now amongst the  greatest treasures of the National Museum at Athens, Greece. Besides  these obviously desirable art relics, there came to the surface some  curious pieces of metal, accompanied by traces of what may have been a  wooden casing. Two thousand years under the sea had reduced the metal to  a mess of corroded fragments of plates, powdered verdigris, and still  recognizable pieces of gear wheels.    If it were not for the established dates for other treasure from this  ship, especially the minor objects found, and for traces of inscriptions  on this metal device written in letters agreeing epigraphically with the  other objects, one would have little doubt in supposing that such a  complicated piece of machinery dated from the 18th century, at the  earliest. As it is, estimates agree on _ca._ 65 B.C. +-10 years, and we  can be sure that the machine is of Hellenistic origin, possibly from  Rhodes or Cos.    [Illustration: Figure 6.--ANTIKYTHERA MACHINE, LARGEST FRAGMENT. (_Photo  courtesy of National Museum, Athens._)]    The inscriptions, only partly legible, lead one to believe that we are  dealing with an astronomical calculating mechanism of some sort. This is  born out by the mechanical construction evident on the fragments. The  largest one (fig. 6) contains a multiplicity of gearing involving an  annular gear working epicyclic gearing on a turntable, a crown wheel,  and at least four separate trains of smaller gears, as well as a  4-spoked driving wheel. One of the smaller fragments (fig. 7, bottom)  contains a series of movable rings which may have served to carry  movable scales on one of the three dials. The third fragment (fig. 7,  top) has a pair of rings carefully engraved and graduated in degrees of  the zodiac (this is, incidentally, the oldest engraved scale known, and  micrometric measurements on photographs have indicated a maximum  inaccuracy of about 1/2 deg. in the 45 deg. present).    [Illustration: Figure 7.--ANTIKYTHERA MACHINE, TWO SMALLER FRAGMENTS.  (_Photo courtesy of National Museum, Athens._)]    Unfortunately, the very difficult task of cleaning the fragments is  slow, and no publication has yet given sufficient detail for an adequate  explanation of this object. One can only say that although the problems  of restoration and mechanical analysis are peculiarly great, this must  stand as the most important scientific artifact preserved from  antiquity.    Some technical details can be gleaned however. The shape of the gear  teeth appears to be almost exactly equilateral triangles in all cases  (fig. 8), and square shanks may be seen at the centers of some of the  wheels. No wheel is quite complete enough for a count of gear teeth, but  a provisional reconstruction by Theophanidis (fig. 9) has shown that the  appearances are consistent with the theory that the purpose of the  gears was to provide the correct angular ratios to move the sun and  planets at their appropriate relative speeds.    [Illustration: Figure 8.--ANTIKYTHERA MACHINE, DETAIL FROM FIGURE 6,  showing gearing. (_Photo courtesy of National Museum, Athens._)]    Thus, if the evidence of the Antikythera machine is to be taken at its  face value, we have, already in classical times, the use of astronomical  devices as complicated as any clock. In any case, the material supplied  by the works ascribed to Archimedes, Hero, and Vitruvius, and the more  certain evidence of the anaphoric clocks is sufficient to show that  there was a strong classical tradition of such machines, a tradition  that inspired, even if it did not directly influence, later developments  in Islam and Europe on the one side, and, just possibly, China on the  other.      _Note added in proof_:      Since the above lines were written, I have been privileged    to make a full examination of the fragments in the    National Museum in Athens. As a result we can read much    more inscription and make out many more details of the    mechanism. The cleaning and disentangling of the fragments    by the museum staff has proceeded to the stage where one    can assert much more positively that the device was an    astronomical computer for sidereal, solar, lunar, and    possibly also planetary phenomena. (See my article in the    _Scientific American_, June 1959, vol. 200, No. 6, pp.    60-67.) Relevant to the present study, it must also be    noted at this point that the machine is now shown to be    strongly related to the geared astrolabe of al-Biruni and    thereby the Hellenistic, Islamic, and European    developments are drawn together even more tightly.    Let us now turn our attention to those civilizations which were  intermediaries, geographically and culturally, between Greece and  medieval Europe, and between both of these and China.
