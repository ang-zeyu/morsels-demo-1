More directly bearing on our present enquiry are the particulars  furnished by Colonel Duringer of the weights carried in most of the  expeditions by the horses of the Chasseurs d'Afrique. These details were  ascertained by the Colonel at the moment of departure of a  column:--Horseman, 180 lbs.; equipment, 53 lbs.; pressed hay for five  days, 55 lbs.; barley for same period, 44 lbs. The man's own provisions  brought up the total burden to about 350 lbs. English = 25 stone! Daily  consumption of hay and grain would reduce this colossal burden  gradually; but the horse would never carry less than 16 stone 9 lbs. at  the end of his journey, starting with the load described.    As regards forced marches of comparatively short duration, Colonel  Duringer states that         \"A good horse in the desert ought to accomplish for five or six       days, one after the other, distances of 25 to 30 leagues. After       a couple of days' rest, if well fed he will be quite fresh       enough to repeat the feat. It is no very rare occurrence to       hear of horses doing 50 or 60 leagues in twenty-four hours.\"          PONIES IN MOROCCO.      Mr. T. E. Cornwell, who has had twenty years' experience of travel and  residence in Morocco, gives the ponies in common use in that country a  high character as weight carriers and for endurance on scanty food; they  are also very sure-footed. These horses he describes as Barbs, very  hardy with thick shoulders; they average 14 hands 2 inches, rarely  attaining a height of 15 hands. They generally receive a feed of  rough straw in the morning and a ration of barley, from 6 to 7 lbs., at  night; they are watered (when water can be obtained) once a day. Grass  can be had at some seasons of the year, but the horses, being tethered  during halts, cannot graze, and as the task of cutting grass would  entail delay it is never used.      [Illustration: _Here they come!_    _There they are!_    _On the Look Out._    _On the Look Out._    _Charging on them._    _Receiving the Charge._    _From original pencil sketches by Henry Alken._]    Mr. Cornwell, a 14 stone man, has ridden one of these ponies for  thirty-two consecutive days, with only one day's rest, covering an  average of thirty miles per day.    General Maclean, who for a long period was the \"Kaid\" or  Commander-in-Chief of the Sultan's forces in Morocco, once tried the  experiment of stabling his horses instead of picketing out in the open,  which is the usual practice. The experiment did not answer, for on his  next expedition every horse died; shelter for a period had no doubt  rendered them susceptible to maladies brought on by exposure at night.  These ponies could be purchased at a figure ranging from L8 to L11 per  head. An export duty of L3 10s., which is levied on every horse sent out  of Morocco, must be added to these rates by foreign purchasers.    Mr. Cornwell states that an infusion of English blood does nothing to  improve these hardy Morocco ponies. Blood horses from England have been  imported and crossed with the native mares, but the produce have always  been leggy and less capable of continued hard work than the native  breed.          PONIES IN EASTERN ASIA.      The pony commonly used in China is bred in the northern part of the  country. According to a writer in _Baily's Magazine_, immense droves of  ponies run on the plains three or four hundred miles from Pekin, and the  breeders bring them down every year for sale in the more populous  districts. They average about 13.1 in height, and though in very  wretched condition when brought to market, pick up rapidly on good food.  They are usually short and deep in the barrel, have good legs and feet,  and fairly good shoulders. Speed is not to be expected from their  conformation; but they can carry heavy weights, are of robust  constitution and possess great endurance.    The Burmese ponies are smaller than the Chinese, averaging about 12  hands 2 inches, a thirteen-hand pony being considered a big one. They  are generally sturdy little beasts with good shoulders, excellent bone  and very strong in the back; sound, hardy and enduring, capable of doing  much continuous hard work under a heavy weight on indifferent food. Like  the Chinese ponies, they are somewhat slow, but they are marvellous  jumpers.    Before the annexation of Upper Burma in 1885 the lower province was  dependent upon the breeders of the Shan Hills and on the breeders in  independent Burma for its ponies, as the export of stallions and mares  was forbidden.    Since the annexation the Indian Government have sought to improve the  native breed by the introduction of Arab pony stallions; the superior  size and good looks of the \"Indo-Burman,\" as the cross-bred is called,  are, the writer understands, steadily leading to the disappearance of  the pure Burmese. The half-bred Arab has much to recommend him over the  pure Burmese pony in greater docility and speed; but these advantages  appear to have been gained at some sacrifice of weight-carrying power  and endurance.    Captain M. H. Hayes, in _The Points of the Horse_, states that the  ponies of Sumatra, averaging about 12 hands 2 inches, are the strongest  for their size he has ever seen. He describes them as \"simply balls of  muscle,\" and notes the beauty of their heads, which would seem to  distinguish them as a breed from the ponies found on the mainland. The  Corean pony is the smallest of Eastern breeds, but his extraordinary  weight-carrying power makes him a marvel: averaging about ten hands in  height and slight of build, he is nevertheless able to carry a  full-grown man, on a saddle secured over a pile of rugs to atone for his  small size, and to do a long day's work under a burden wholly  disproportionate to his inches.          PONIES IN AUSTRALIA.      The Australian \"mail-man,\" or mounted postman, whose duty it is to  distribute and collect letters at the remote and scattered \"stations\"  far from railway centres, prefers small horses for his arduous work,  which demands endurance and speed. Thus they are described by  \"Australian Native\" in the _Field_ of June 11, 1892:--         \"The mail-man's riding horse is of an entirely different class       [from the pack horse which carries the bags], and is probably       best described as a 'big little' animal, or a symmetrical,       typical English three-quarter bred hunter of 16 to 16.2 focused       into 13.2 or 13.3, with slightly higher withers, which gives       the appearance of a somewhat low back.\"         \"Bearing in mind the character of mail-men's duty, it becomes       evident that of necessity their horses must possess combined       stamina, high courage and speed. The stamp described have these       qualities in a marked degree, and, in addition, their natural       paces of jog--not an amble--and daisy-cutting canter not only       enable them to get over the ground with great ease to       themselves but also to their riders. Moreover, these small       animals are not readily knocked up, but when they do get stale       and leg-weary through extra hard work on little food, a few       days on good grass is sufficient for them to regain their       vitality. In Australian parlance, they are 'cut-and-come-again       customers,' and unlike big horses, which, when they knock up,       knock up for an indefinitely long period.         \"The smartest stock horses, those in use for drafting cattle,       are also small, handy and well up to 12 stone, and as their       prices are the same as mail-men's nags, from L4 to L8 per head,       the evidence in favour of small horses for utilitarian       purposes, and also on the score of economy, preponderates.       Would such small animals, withal tough and wiry, be suitable       for light cavalry?\"    The answer to the concluding query is undoubtedly \"Yes.\"          PONIES IN AMERICA AND TEXAS.      The ponies of North-West America are famed for their powers of  endurance, which are the more remarkable in view of their make and  shape. These animals are without doubt the descendants of stock  introduced by the Spaniards when they invaded Mexico early in the 16th  century; the offspring of these Spanish horses in course of time spread  over the whole continent.    Colonel Richard Irving Dodge remarks, in his work _Our Wild Indians_  (1882), that the horses introduced by the Spaniards must have been very  inferior in size, or the race has greatly degenerated; as compared with  the American horse, the Indian pony is very small. As the subsequent  observations of Colonel Dodge prove, these ponies, if they have lost  size have lost absolutely nothing in working qualities; they have become  adapted to their conditions of life and have probably gained in  hardiness of constitution and endurance. He writes:--         \"Averaging scarcely fourteen hands in height, the Indian pony       is rather slight in build, though always having powerful       fore-quarters, good legs, short, strong back, and full barrel.       He has not the slightest appearance of 'blood,' though his       sharp, nervous ears and bright, vicious eye indicate unusual       intelligence and temper. But the amount of work he can do and       the distance he can make in a specified (long) time put him       fairly on a level with the Arabian or any other of the animal       creation.... Treated properly, the pony will wear out two       American horses, but in the hands of the Indian he is so abused       and neglected that an energetic cavalry officer will wear him       out.\"    The North-West American Indian, though a marvellous horseman as a \"trick  rider,\" has apparently no idea whatever of saving his mount, whatever  the distance he has to travel. According to Colonel Dodge, who has  enjoyed many opportunities of informing himself on Indian usages,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3785"],[0,"In the Reign of Terror: The Adventures of a Westminster Boy (#4)"],[1,"tailor's shop. The proprietor came up bowing, as Harry  thought, in a most cringing sort of way to his companion. M. du  Tillet gave some orders, and the tailor unrolled a variety of pieces  of cloth and other materials for Harry's inspection.    The lad shook his head and turned to his guide, and, pointing to  the goods, asked him to choose the things which were most suitable  for him; M. du Tillet understood the appeal and ordered four suits.  Two of these were for ordinary wear; another was, Harry concluded,  for the evening; and the fourth for ceremonial occasions.    The coats were cut long, but very open in front, and were far too  scanty to button; the waistcoats were long and embroidered; a white  and ample handkerchief went round the throat and was tied loosely,  with long ends edged with lace falling in front; knee-breeches,  with white stockings, and shoes with buckles, completed the costume.    Harry looked on with a smile of amusement, and burst into a hearty  laugh when the garments were fixed upon, for the idea of himself  dressed out in these seemed to him ludicrous in the extreme.    \"How they would laugh at home,\" he thought to himself, \"if they  could see me in these things! The girls would give me no peace.  And wouldn't there be an uproar if I were to turn up in them in  Dean's Yard and march up school!\"    Harry was then measured. When this was done he took out his purse,  which contained fifty guineas; for his father had thought it probable  that the clothes he would require would cost more than they would  in London, and he wished him to have a good store of pocket-money  until he received the first instalment of his pay. M.  du Tillet,  however, shook his head and motioned to him to put up his purse;  and Harry supposed that it was not customary to pay for things in  France until they were delivered. Then his companion took him into  another shop, and pointing to his own ruffles intimated that Harry  would require some linen of this kind to be worn when in full dress.  Harry signified that his friend should order what was necessary;  and half a dozen shirts, with deep ruffles at the wrist and breast,  were ordered. This brought their shopping to an end.    They remained three days in Paris, at the end of which time Harry's  clothes were delivered. The following morning a carriage with the  arms of the marquis emblazoned upon it came up to the door, and  they started. The horses were fat and lazy; and Harry, who had no  idea how far they were going, thought that the journey was likely  to be a long one if this was the pace at which they were to travel.    Twelve miles out they changed horses at a post-station, their own  returning to Paris, and after this had relays at each station, and  travelled at a pace which seemed to Harry to be extraordinarily  rapid.  They slept twice upon the road.    The third day the appearance of the country altogether changed, and,  instead of the flat plains which Harry had begun to think extended  all over France, they were now among hills higher than anything he  had ever seen before. Towards the afternoon they crossed the range  and began to descend, and as evening approached M. du Tillet pointed  to a building standing on rising ground some miles away and said:    \"That is the chateau.\"          CHAPTER II    A Mad Dog      It was dark before the carriage drove up to the chateau. Their  approach had been seen, for two lackeys appeared with torches at  the head of the broad steps. M. du Tillet put his hand encouragingly  on Harry's shoulder and led him up the steps. A servant preceded  them across a great hall, when a door opened and a gentleman came  forward.    \"Monsieur le Marquis,\" M. du Tillet said, bowing, \"this is the  young gentleman you charged me to bring to you.    \"I am glad to see you,\" the marquis said; \"and I hope you will make  yourself happy and comfortable here.\"    Harry did not understand the words, but he felt the tone of kindness  and courtesy with which they were spoken. He could, however, only  bow; for although in the eight days he had spent with M. du Tillet  he had picked up a great many nouns and a few phrases, his stock  of words was of no use to him at present.    \"And you, M. du Tillet,\" the marquis said. \"You have made a good  journey, I hope? I thank you much for the trouble you have taken.  I like the boy's looks; what do you think of him?\"    \"I like him very much,\" M. du Tillet said; \"he is a new type to  me, and a pleasant one. I think he will make a good companion for  the young count.\"    The marquis now turned and led the way into a great drawing-room,  and taking Harry's hand led him up to  a lady seated on a couch.    \"This is our young English friend, Julie. Of course he is strange  at present, but M. du Tillet reports well of him, and I already  like his face.\"    The lady held out her hand, which Harry, instead of bending over  and kissing, as she had expected, shook heartily. For an instant  only a look of intense surprise passed across her face; then she  said courteously:    \"We are glad to see you. It is very good of you to come so far to  us. I trust that you will be happy here.\"    \"These are my sons Ernest and Jules, who will, I am sure, do all  in their power to make you comfortable,\" the marquis said.    The last words were spoken sharply and significantly, and their  tone was not lost upon the two boys; they had a moment before been  struggling to prevent themselves bursting into a laugh at Harry's  reception of their mother's greeting, but they now instantly composed  their faces and advanced.    \"Shake hands with him,\" the marquis said sharply; \"it is the custom  of his country.\"    Each in turn held out his hand to Harry, who, as he shook hands  with them, took a mental stock of his future companions.    \"Good looking,\" he said to himself, \"but more like girls than boys.  A year in the fifth form would do them a world of good. I could  polish the two off together with one hand.\"    \"My daughters,\" the marquis said, \"Mesdemoiselles Marie, Jeanne,  and Virginie.\"    Three young ladies had risen from their seats as their father  entered, each made a deep curtsy as her name was mentioned, and  Harry bowed deeply in return. Mademoiselle Marie was two years at  least older than himself, and was already a young lady of fashion.  Jeanne struck him as being about the same age as his sister Fanny,  who was between fourteen and fifteen. Virginie was a child of ten.  Ernest was about his own age, while Jules came between the two  younger girls.    \"Take M. Sandwith to the abbe,\" the marquis said to Ernest, \"and do  all in your power to set him at his ease. Remember what you would  feel if you were placed, as he is, among strange people in a strange  country.\"    The lad motioned to Harry to accompany him, and the three boys left  the room together.    \"You can go to your gouvernante,\" the marquise said to the two  younger girls; and with a profound curtsy to her and another to the  marquis, they left the room. Unrestrained now by their presence,  the marquise turned to her husband with a merry laugh.    \"But it is a bear you have brought home, Edouard, a veritable  bear--my fingers ache still--and he is to teach manners to my sons!  I always protested against the plan, but I did not think it would  be as bad as this. These islanders are savages.\"    The marquis smiled.    \"He is a little gauche, but that will soon rub off. I like him,  Julie. Remember it was a difficult position for a boy. We did not  have him here to give polish to our sons. It may be that they have  even a little too much of this at present. The English are not  polished, everyone knows that, but they are manly and independent.  That boy bore himself well. He probably had never been in a room  like this in his life, he was ignorant of our language, alone among  strangers, but he was calm and self-possessed. I like the honest  straightforward look in his face. And look at the width of the  shoulders and the strength of his arms; why, he would break Ernest  across his knee, and the two boys must be about the same age.\"    \"Oh, he has brute strength, I grant,\" the marquise said; \"so have  the sons of our peasants; however, I do not want to find fault with  him, it is your hobby, or rather that of Auguste, who is, I think,  mad about these English; I will say nothing to prevent its having  a fair trial, only I hope it will not be necessary for me to give  him my hand again.\"    \"I do not suppose it will until he leaves, Julie, and by that time,  no doubt, he will know what to do with it; but here is M. du Tillet  waiting all this time for you to speak to him.\"    \"Pardon me, my good M. du Tillet,\" the marquise said. \"In truth  that squeeze of my hand has driven all other matters from my mind.  How have you fared? This long journey with this English bear must  have been very tedious for you.\"    \"Indeed, Madame la Marquise,\" M. du Tillet replied, \"it has been no  hardship, the boy has amused me greatly; nay, more, he has pleased  me. We have been able to say little to each other, though, indeed,  he is quick and eager to learn, and will soon speak our language;  but his face has been a study. When he is pleased you can see that  he is pleased, and that is a  pleasure, for few people are pleased  in our days. Again, when he does not like a thing you can also  see it.  I can see that he says to himself, I can expect nothing  better, these poor people are only French. When the gamins in Paris  jeered him as to his dress, he closed his hands and would have flown  at them with his fists after the manner of his countrymen had he  not put strong restraint on himself. From the look of his honest  eyes I shall, when he can speak our language, believe implicitly  what he says.  That boy would not tell a lie whatever were the  consequences.  Altogether I like him much. I think that in a very  little while he will adapt himself to what goes on around"]]]
