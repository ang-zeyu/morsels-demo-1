I vaguely remembered  the crash and the strange hands pulling me out of the wreckage and the  weeks I'd spent, broken-bodied and delirious, gently tended by one of  the red-eyed, twittering women of the trailmen. In all I had spent eight  years in the Nest, which was not a nest at all but a vast sprawling city  built in the branches of enormous trees. With the small and delicate  humanoids who had been my playfellows, I had gathered the nuts and buds  and trapped the small arboreal animals they used for food, taken my  share at weaving clothing from the fibres of parasite plants cultivated  on the stems, and in all those eight years I had set foot on the ground  less than a dozen times, even though I had travelled for miles through  the tree-roads high above the forest floor.    Then the Old-One's painful decision that I was too alien for them, and  the difficult and dangerous journey my trailmen foster-parents and  foster-brothers had undertaken, to help me out of the Hellers and  arrange for me to be taken to the Trade City. After two years of  physically painful and mentally rebellious readjustment to daytime  living, the owl-eyed trailmen saw best, and lived largely, by moonlight,  I had found a niche for myself, and settled down. But all of the later  years (after Jay Allison had taken over, I supposed, from a basic  pattern of memory common to both of us) had vanished into the limbo of  the subconscious.    A bookrack was crammed with large microcards; I slipped one into the  viewer, with a queer sense of spying, and found myself listening  apprehensively to hear that measured step and Jay Allison's falsetto  voice demanding what the hell I was doing, meddling with his  possessions. Eye to the viewer, I read briefly at random, something  about the management of compound fracture, then realized I had  understood exactly three words in a paragraph. I put my fist against my  forehead and heard the words echoing there emptily; \"laceration ...  primary efflusion ... serum and lymph ... granulation tissue....\" I  presumed that the words meant something and that I once had known what.  But if I had a medical education, I didn't recall a syllable of it. I  didn't know a fracture from a fraction.    In a sudden frenzy of impatience I stripped off the white coat and put  on the first shirt I came to, a crimson thing that hung in the line of  white coats like an exotic bird in snow country. I went back to  rummaging the drawers and bureaus. Carelessly shoved in a pigeonhole I  found another microcard that looked familiar; and when I slipped it  mechanically into the viewer it turned out to be a book on  mountaineering which, oddly enough, I remembered buying as a youngster.  It dispelled my last, lingering doubts. Evidently I had bought it before  the personalities had forked so sharply apart and separated, Jason from  Jay. I was beginning to believe. Not to accept. Just to believe it had  happened. The book looked well-thumbed, and had been handled so much I  had to baby it into the slot of the viewer.    Under a folded pile of clean underwear I found a flat half-empty bottle  of whiskey. I remembered Forth's words that he'd never seen Jay Allison  drink, and suddenly I thought, \"The fool!\" I fixed myself a drink and  sat down, idly scanning over the mountaineering book.           *       *       *       *       *    Not till I'd entered medical school, I suspected, did the two halves of  me fork so strongly apart ... so strongly that there had been days and  weeks and, I suspected, years where Jay Allison had kept me prisoner. I  tried to juggle dates in my mind, looked at a calendar, and got such a  mental jolt that I put it face-down to think about when I was a little  drunker.    I wondered if my detailed memories of my teens and early twenties were  the same memories Jay Allison looked back on. I didn't think so. People  forget and remember selectively. Week by week, then, and year by year,  the dominant personality of Jay had crowded me out; so that the young  rowdy, more than half Darkovan, loving the mountains, half-homesick for  a non-human world, had been drowned in the chilly, austere young medical  student who lost himself in his work. But I, Jason--I had always been  the watcher behind, the person Jay Allison dared not be? Why was he past  thirty--and I just 22?    A ringing shattered the silence; I had to hunt for the intercom on the  bedroom wall. I said, \"Who is it?\" and an unfamiliar voice demanded,  \"Dr. Allison?\"    I said automatically, \"Nobody here by that name,\" and started to put  back the mouthpiece. Then I stopped and gulped and asked, \"Is that you,  Dr. Forth?\"    It was, and I breathed again. I didn't even want to think about what I'd  say if somebody else had demanded to know why in the devil I was  answering Dr. Allison's private telephone. When Forth had finished, I  went to the mirror, and stared, trying to see behind my face the sharp  features of that stranger, _Doctor_ Jason Allison. I delayed, even while  I was wondering what few things I should pack for a trip into the  mountains and the habit of hunting parties was making mental lists about  heat-socks and windbreakers. The face that looked at me was a young  face, unlined and faintly freckled, the same face as always except that  I'd lost my suntan; Jay Allison had kept me indoors too long. Suddenly I  struck the mirror lightly with my fist.    \"The hell with you, Dr. Allison,\" I said, and went to see if he had kept  any clothes fit to pack.           *       *       *       *       *    Dr. Forth was waiting for me in the small skyport on the roof, and so  was a small 'copter, one of the fairly old ones assigned to Medical  Service when they were too beat-up for services with higher priority.  Forth took one startled stare at my crimson shirt, but all he said was,  \"Hello, Jason. Here's something we've got to decide right away; do we  tell the crew who you really are?\"    I shook my head emphatically. \"I'm not Jay Allison; I don't want his  name or his reputation. Unless there are men on the crew who know  Allison by sight--\"    \"Some of them do, but I don't think they'd recognize you.\"    \"Tell them I'm his twin brother,\" I said humorlessly.    \"That wouldn't be necessary. There's not enough resemblance.\" Forth  raised his head and beckoned to a man who was doing something near the  'copter. He said under his breath, \"You'll see what I mean,\" as the man  approached.    He wore the uniform of Spaceforce--black leather with a little rainbow  of stars on his sleeve meaning he'd seen service on a dozen different  planets, a different colored star for each one. He wasn't a young man,  but on the wrong side of fifty, seamed and burly and huge, with a split  lip and weathered face. I liked his looks. We shook hands and Forth  said, \"This is our man, Kendricks. He's called Jason, and he's an expert  on the trailmen. Jason, this is Buck Kendricks.\"    \"Glad to know you, Jason.\" I thought Kendricks looked at me half a  second more than necessary. \"The 'copter's ready. Climb in, Doc--you're  going as far as Carthon, aren't you?\"    We put on zippered windbreaks and the 'copter soared noiselessly into  the pale crimson sky. I sat beside Forth, looking down through pale  lilac clouds at the pattern of Darkover spread below me.    \"Kendricks was giving me a funny eye, Doc. What's biting him?\"    \"He has known Jay Allison for eight years,\" Forth said quietly, \"and he  hasn't recognized you yet.\"    But we let it ride at that, to my great relief, and didn't talk any more  about me at all. As we flew under silent whirring blades, turning our  backs on the settled country which lay near the Trade City, we talked  about Darkover itself. Forth told me about the trailmen's fever and  managed to give me some idea about what the blood fraction was, and why  it was necessary to persuade fifty or sixty of the humanoids to return  with me, to donate blood from which the antibody could be, first  isolated, then synthesised.    It would be a totally unheard-of thing, if I could accomplish it. Most  of the trailmen never touched ground in their entire lives, except when  crossing the passes above the snow line. Not a dozen of them, including  my foster-parents who had so painfully brought me out across Dammerung,  had ever crossed the ring of encircling mountains that walled them away  from the rest of the planet. Humans sometimes penetrated the lower  forests in search of the trailmen. It was one-way traffic. The trailmen  never came in search of _them_.           *       *       *       *       *    We talked, too, about some of those humans who had crossed the mountains  into trailmen country--those mountains profanely dubbed the Hellers by  the first Terrans who had tried to fly over them in anything lower or  slower than a spaceship. (The Darkovan name for the Hellers was even  more explicit, and even in translation, unrepeatable.)    \"What about this crew you picked? They're not Terrans?\"    Forth shook his head. \"It would be murder to send anyone recognizably  Terran into the Hellers. You know how the trailmen feel about outsiders  getting into their country.\" I knew. Forth continued, \"Just the same,  there will be two Terrans with you.\"    \"They don't know Jay Allison?\" I didn't want to be burdened with  anyone--not anyone--who would know me, or expect me to behave like my  forgotten other self.    \"Kendricks knows you,\" Forth said, \"but I'm going to be perfectly  truthful. I never knew Jay Allison well, except in line of work. I know  a lot of things--from the past couple of days--which came out during  the hypnotic sessions, which he'd never have dreamed of telling me, or  anyone else, consciously. And that comes under the heading of a  professional confidence--even from you.
