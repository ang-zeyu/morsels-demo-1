When crushed it can be  mixed with the food, or boiled to make linseed tea for sick horses; and  for this latter purpose I prefer it to linseed, as there is less oil in  it, the smell of which sometimes nauseates an animal and causes him to  refuse it.      Black Gram (_cooltee_).    In the Madras Presidency and Southern India black gram is used, the Bengal  white gram not being grown there. This has to be boiled before use.  Military horses are fed on it, but it is said that it makes them soft. I  have, however, no personal experience of black gram.      Preparation of Food.    In India it is the custom to damp the food before it is given. It should  not be saturated so as to turn it into a sloppy paste, but just damped  sufficiently to make the particles stick together. Grooms (syces)  generally deal out each feed into a bucket dry from the corn-bin, and then  damp it; but a better plan is to weigh out the whole of the amount  required for all the horses, and put it into a wide-mouthed earthen bowl  called a \"naund,\" that can be purchased for a few pence, or a box, such as  an old wine case, and damp the whole amount together, then portioning it  out for each animal. The reason of this is that, if the grain is damped in  the buckets, they are at once taken away, and, the probabilities are,  never cleaned; but if they have to be brought forward for each feed to be  put into them, and the owner takes the trouble now and again to inspect  them, \"syces,\" who are creatures of habit, get into the way of cleaning  them before they bring them forward. The box, or naund, in which the grain  is damped being stationary, can be looked at any time. It is necessary to  be very careful about this, as the particles of food left very quickly  ferment in a hot climate, and get sour, and quickly taint all the rest. As  a rule, about ten minutes is long enough to damp grain; and this should be  done as soon before feeding as possible, otherwise, if left long standing,  it will get sour. If a horse refuses his feed, it should be at once thrown  away, and on no account be kept till the next meal, by which time it is  pretty certain to have fermented.      Horses refusing Food.    Some horses are delicate feeders naturally, and take a long time in  eating, or refuse their food altogether. In the case of a delicate or slow  feeder, the food should be given in small quantities and often, rather  than in the usual somewhat rather large feeds three times a day; and the  horse should be fed by himself. This is easily done in India, as nearly  all stables are loose boxes; but if the animal is picketed out with others  that are likely to teaze him, he should be taken away and fed out of a  bucket in the \"compound\" (garden or enclosure round the house). \"Syces,\"  like all natives of India, have no idea of the value of time; and if he  has his \"hooka\" (pipe), and a friend to talk to about the price of  food-stuffs, rates of wages, and other such-like interesting bazaar  topics, he is perfectly content to sit holding the bucket before the horse  all day long, if necessary. If the animal refuses his food altogether,  then it should be taken away, for if left standing in front of him he  breathes on it, and if it remains any considerable time it becomes sour  and fermented, and he gets disgusted with it; whereas, if taken away and  nothing more given till next feeding-time, the appetite often returns, and  the food is consumed with a relish; especially in the warm weather, if he  is first led out and exercised, or picketed out under a tree. On no  account should the feed that has been refused be kept over till the next  feeding-time; a fresh one should be prepared, as in a hot climate wet  grain ferments and turns sour in a very short space of time.      Times of Feeding.    The stomach of the horse is very small in proportion to the size of his  body, and he requires to be fed often, and in small quantities. In  England hunters are fed four, or even five, times a day. In India it is  the usual custom to feed three times, and perhaps it is often enough. In  all military stations a gun is fired at noon, and the midday feed is given  at that hour; but the morning and evening one varies with the season of  the year. I usually give only half a feed in the evening about five  o'clock, and the remainder the last thing at night, about eight or nine,  according to the season of the year; but, unless carefully watched,  \"syces\" will not do this, as it is the custom only to feed three times  daily, and \"dastour\" (custom) is a thing it is impossible to make a native  break through.      Bolting Food.    Some horses have a trick of bolting their food without masticating it  properly, especially if another is being fed in their company. It is a  good plan to feed such horses apart from any others, which can easily be  done in an Indian stable, as they are all loose boxes, or, if picketed out  in the open, by moving him a short distance away from the others. A small  quantity of chaff, grass, straw, or what is known as \"bhoosa,\" which is  wheat straw that is crushed and broken into small pieces in the process  of treading out the grain by bullocks, mixed in with the feed, will  usually make them masticate it properly.      Spilling Food on Ground.    Horses have also a trick sometimes of throwing their food out of the  bucket or manger, and spilling a quantity on the ground. Not only is a  large amount wasted, but when the animal has finished what is left, and  tries at his leisure to gather up what is on the ground, he eats a large  amount of earth and dirt with it, which is injurious. The best way I know  to prevent this is to feed the horse on a cloth on the ground; any bit of  old sacking about four feet square will answer for the purpose.      Grass.    In India hay is not often seen, and horses are fed on grass; even  race-horses are trained on it. This may at first sound strange, but Indian  grass is very different to English meadow grass, and chiefly consists of  the roots and runners, the actual blade of grass not being more than about  an inch long. The best grass is what is known as \"dhoob.\" It is a short  grass, with long roots and suckers, which is dug up out of the ground with  a short iron hoe or trowel, called a \"kurpa,\" which is used with a  scraping motion of the hand, the process being called \"cheeling.\" A  considerable quantity of earth is taken up with it, which ought to be  knocked off against the hoe; but as the grass is sold by weight, and the  usual quantity a private \"grass-cutter\" is supposed to bring in daily is  20 seers (40 lbs. weight), it is not to his advantage to clean it. If  horses eat dirty grass for any length of time, the sand and dirt, besides  damaging the teeth, is likely to accumulate in the intestines and give  rise to what is known as sand colic. When the \"grass-cutter\" brings in his  bundle of grass that he has collected, which he generally does at midday,  it should be spread out and cleaned; sticks and thorns should be picked  out, as they are likely to lodge in the horse's throat and choke him, and  it should be well beaten with a stick to get rid of the sand and dirt. A  good plan is to fasten a net between the wooden framework of a \"charpoy,\"  or native bedstead, lay the grass on it, and beat it there with a stick,  and it is surprising what a quantity of rubbish will fall through. An old  lawn tennis net, if the meshes are not too big, answers well for this  purpose. Grass-cutters are fond of wetting the grass to make it weigh. If  it is brought in fresh, and damped with clean water beyond the actual  loss in weight, I do not know that it does much harm; but it is  exceedingly likely that the water has been obtained from some stagnant  dirty puddle, and the bundle has been left standing for some time so that  fermentation has set in, giving it an unpleasant smell. It is therefore  best to have the bundles at once opened out and spread in the sun to dry  as soon as they are brought in, and not allow the \"grass-cutters\" to take  them away to their own houses. In parts of the foot hills of the Himalayas  (\"hurriarie,\" or \"hurrialie\") grass is obtained. It is not found in the  plains, or in the very high mountains where it is cold. It is a long  grass, running to about three feet high, and is cut with a curved sickle.  When young and green it is a capital fodder grass; but when the seed is  shed, and it gets dry, it is unfit for any other purpose than bedding, as  the stalks get very hard and brittle, and so dry that there is little or  no nourishment in it. It should not then be allowed into the stable for  any other purpose than bedding; but being much easier to collect than  \"dhoob\" grass, the \"grass-cutters\" will bring it as long as they are  allowed to, even when it resembles nothing more than a bundle of sticks. I  have frequently heard owners of horses in the hills complain of their  animals getting thin and out of condition, the cause of which on inquiry  was simply due to the bad dry hurrialie grass that was brought for them to  eat.      Churrie.    This is the dried stalk of one of the shorgum tribe of plants, which is  also known as the Chinese sugar-cane. It is a summer crop cut in the  autumn. It grows to five or six feet high, and is cut and stored by the  natives as a fodder for the cattle. It would to the new-comer appear to be  a most unsuitable article of food, but is full of saccharine matter,  tasting quite sweet when chewed in the mouth, so much so that in parts a  rough sugar is extracted from it, but to look at is like a bundle of dried  reeds. Animals of all sorts are very fond of it, and I have frequently fed  my horses on it for days together in out-of-the-way places where no grass  was to be obtained. It is not used as a regular horse fodder, but it does  well for it on a pinch.      Bhoosa.
