It should mean everything that is  highest and best and happiest in human life, but it can be easily  perverted and ruined and made the cause of horrible suffering of both  mind and body.    There are two very terrible sexual diseases--syphilis and gonorrhea.  They are both frightfully infectious and very difficult to cure.  These diseases are usually acquired by sex contact with a diseased  person, but they can also be gotten by using public drinking cups,  towels, water-closets, or in any way by which an infected moist  article can come in contact with one's skin. The worst thing about  these diseases is that they are such invisible enemies. After the  outside appearance of the disease is gone, they often go reaching  farther and farther into the body, making awful results that hang on  for years. Men who get diseased frequently give the infection to  their wives, often causing them to be so ill that surgical operations  are necessary, by which their sex organs are so crippled that they  can never be mothers; and, worst of all, innocent unborn babies are  infected and come into the world sick or deformed or blind.    Men often get these dreadful diseases by having sex relations with  women who are called prostitutes or \"bad women,\" that is, they are  women who are not in love with any one, but who make money by selling  their sex relations to men who pay for them. Many prostitutes become  diseased, and there is, as yet, no way for either them or the men who  visit them to be positively safe from infection. But the doctors are  making progress in their study of these diseases, and they are  finding out how to control and cure them, just as they have in the  case of tuberculosis.    But even if presently these venereal diseases, as they are called,  can be entirely cured and prevented, prostitution will still remain a  thing to hate. For the idea of sex relations between people who do  not love each other, who do not feel any sense of belonging to each  other, will always be revolting to highly developed, sensitive  people.    People's lives grow finer and their characters better, if they have  sex relations only with those they love. And those who make the  wretched mistake of yielding to the sex impulse alone when there is  no love to go with it, usually live to despise themselves for their  weakness and their bad taste. They are always ashamed of doing it,  and they try to keep it secret from their families and those they  respect. You can be sure that whatever people are ashamed to do is  something that can never bring them real happiness. It is true that  one's sex relations are the most personal and private matters in the  world, and they belong just to us and to no one else, but while we  may be shy and reserved about them, _we are not ashamed_.    When two people really love each other, they don't care who knows it.  They are proud of their happiness. But no man is ever proud of his  connection with a prostitute and no prostitute is ever proud of her  business.    Sex relations belong to love, and love is never a _business_. Love is  the nicest thing in the world, but it can't be bought. And the sex  side of it is the biggest and most important side of it, so it is the  one side of us that we must be absolutely sure to keep in good order  and perfect health, if we are going to be happy ourselves or make any  one else happy.

FAMILY ODONTOPHORIDAE      BOB-WHITE    _Colinus virginianus virginianus. Case 1. Figs. 1, 2_              The black and white markings of the male are            respectively buff and brown in the female. In            flight the Bob-white, or Quail, suggests a            Meadowlark, but the tail is without white            feathers. L. 10.              _Range._ Eastern United States north to Minnesota            and Maine south to the Gulf. A Permanent Resident.            Severe winters and much shooting have made it rare            in the more northern parts of its range.              Washington, common P.R. Ossining, common P.R.            Cambridge, P.R. N. Ohio, not common P.R. Glen            Ellyn, rare P.R. SE. Minn., common P.R.    Except when nesting Bob-whites live in flocks or \"coveys\" usually  composed of the members of one family. Their song, heard in spring and  summer, is the clear, ringing two- or three-noted whistle which gives  them their common name. Their fall and winter notes, which sportsmen  term \"scatter calls\" are signals by which the members of a flock keep  within speaking distance of one another. \"_Where_ are you?\" \"_Where_ are  you?\" they seem to say. As with other protectively colored,  ground-inhabiting birds, Bob-whites do not take wing until one almost  steps upon them. Then, like a bursting bomb, the covey seems to explode,  its brown pieces flying in every direction. The nest is on the ground  and the 10-18 white, pear-shaped eggs are laid in May or June.    The Florida Bob-white (_C. v. floridanus_, Case 3, Figs. 1, 2), a  smaller darker race is resident in Florida, except in the northern part  of the state. It begins to nest in April.          GROUSE. FAMILY TETRAONIDAE      CANADA SPRUCE PARTRIDGE    _Canachites canadensis canace_              The male is a grayish bird with a jet black throat            and breast, the former bordered with white; the            skin above the eye is red. The female is barred            with black and reddish brown with a black mottled            tail tipped with brown. L. 15.              _Range._ Northern parts of United States from New            Brunswick to Manitoba. Other races are found            throughout the wooded parts of Canada and Alaska.    An unsuspicious inhabitant of swampy coniferous forests. Now rare in the  United States. It nests on the ground in June, laying 9-16 eggs, buff,  lightly speckled with brown.      RUFFED GROUSE    _Bonasa umbellus umbellus. Case 1, Fig. 3_              The female resembles the male in color but has the            black neck-tufts smaller. The tail-feathers vary            from gray to bright rusty. L. 17.              _Range._ Eastern United States south in the            Alleghanies to Georgia. In the southern states the            Grouse is often called 'Pheasant.' A Permanent            Resident.              Washington, not common P.R. Ossining, common P.R.            Cambridge, P.R., formerly very common. N. Ohio,            rare P.R. Glen Ellyn, rare and local P.R.    On our western plains and prairies there is a Grouse which we call  Prairie Hen and we might well apply the name Wood Hen to this Grouse of  our forests. To flush a Grouse in the quiet of the woods always makes  the \"heart jump.\" His whirring wings not only produce the roar which  accompanies his flight, but they are also responsible for the \"drumming\"  which constitutes the Grouse's song as sitting upright on some favorite  log, he rapidly beats the air with his wings.    The horny fringes which in winter border the toes of the Grouse, or  Partridge, as he is also called, form in effect snow-shoes which help to  support the bird on soft snow. At this season they also feed in trees on  buds and catkins, and they may roost in trees or seek a bed by plunging  into a snow-bank.    The nest, lined with leaves, is placed at the base of a tree or stump;  the 8-14 buffy eggs are laid in May.    The Canada Ruffed Grouse (_B. u. togata_), of northern New England and  northwards is grayer above and more distinctly barred below.      PRAIRIE CHICKEN    _Tympanuchus americanus_              The Prairie Hen has a rounded or nearly square            tail and a barred breast; in the Sharp-tailed            Grouse the tail is pointed, the breast with            V-shaped markings. L. 18.              _Range._ Central Plains region from Texas to            Manitoba, east to Indiana. Migratory at its            northern limits.              Glen Ellyn, P.R. local, S.E. Minn., P.R. much            decreased in numbers.    The Ruffed Grouse sounds his rolling, muffled drum-call in the seclusion  of the forest, but the Prairie Hen beats his loud _boom-ah-boom_ in the  open freedom of the plains. Hardy and strong of wing, he can cope with  winter storms and natural enemies, but against the combined assault of  man, dog, and gun, he cannot successfully contend.    About a dozen buff-olive eggs are laid on the ground in April or early  May.      HEATH HEN    _Tympanuchus cupido_    This is a close relative of the Prairie Hen, having the black neck-tuft  of less than ten feathers with pointed, not rounded, ends. It is now  found only on the Island of Martha's Vineyard, but formerly inhabited  plains or barrens, locally, from New Jersey to Massachusetts. It nests  in June.          TURKEYS. FAMILY MELEAGRIDAE      WILD TURKEY    _Meleagris gallopavo silvestris_              The Wild Turkey was formerly found as far north as            Maine and Ontario but it is unknown now north of            central Pennsylvania. South of Maryland it is not            uncommon locally.              _Range._ Kansas and central Pennsylvania to the            Gulf coast, and northern Florida. Non-migratory.              Washington, rare P.R.    Our domestic Turkey is descended from the Mexican Wild Turkey and like  that race has the upper tail-coverts and tail tipped with whitish,  whereas in our eastern Wild Turkey these tips are chestnut. The nest is  on the ground and 10-14 eggs, pale cream-color finely speckled with  brownish, are laid in April.    The Florida Wild Turkey (_M. g. osceola_), of southern Florida, is  smaller and the white bars on the primaries are narrower and more  broken.          PIGEONS AND DOVES. ORDER COLUMBAE          PIGEONS AND DOVES. FAMILY COLUMBIDAE      MOURNING DOVE    _Zenaidura macroura carolinensis. Case 3, Fig. 3; Case 5, Fig. 11_              Except the southern little Ground Dove, this is            our only Dove. Its long, pointed tail and the            swift, darting flight are its field characters. It            is often mistaken for the Wild or Passenger            Pigeon, now extinct. The two birds differ in size            and in color, but size is a matter of distance,            and color, of comparison, so it seems probable            that as long as there is a possibility of seeing a            Passenger Pigeon, Mourning Doves will be mistaken            for them. L. 11-3/4. The Wild Pigeon is about five            inches longer.              _Range._ North America. In a railway journey from            the Atlantic to the Pacific one may expect to see            the Dove daily. Winters from Virginia southward,            migrating northward in March.              Washington, P.R., common, except in midwinter.            Ossining, common S.R., Mch. 3-Nov. 27; a few            winter. Cambridge, rather rare T.V., Apl. 8-June            18; Sept. 18-Nov. 15. N. Ohio, common S.R., Mch.            20-Oct. 25; rare W.V. Glen Ellyn, tolerably common            S.R., formerly common, Mch. 12-Oct. 21. S.E.            Minn., common S.R., Mch. 15-Dec. 25.    Doves are particularly common in the southern states where, ranked as  game-birds, they are shot in large numbers. The Wild Pigeon's note was  an explosive squawk; the Dove's is a soft, mournful _coo-oo-ah,  coo-o-o-coo-o-o-coo-o-o-_. During the winter, Doves are usually found in  small flocks but, unlike the Wild Pigeon, they nest in scattered pairs.  The nest is"]]]
