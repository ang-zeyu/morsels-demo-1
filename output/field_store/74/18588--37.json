[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3261"],[0,"News from Nowhere; Or, An Epoch of Rest (#4)"],[1,"   I started off: \"When I was a boy, and for long after, except for a piece  about Queen Elizabeth's Lodge, and for the part about High Beech, the  Forest was almost wholly made up of pollard hornbeams mixed with holly  thickets.  But when the Corporation of London took it over about twenty-  five years ago, the topping and lopping, which was a part of the old  commoners' rights, came to an end, and the trees were let to grow.  But I  have not seen the place now for many years, except once, when we Leaguers  went a pleasuring to High Beech.  I was very much shocked then to see how  it was built-over and altered; and the other day we heard that the  philistines were going to landscape-garden it.  But what you were saying  about the building being stopped and the trees growing is only too good  news;--only you know--\"    At that point I suddenly remembered Dick's date, and stopped short rather  confused.  The eager weaver didn't notice my confusion, but said hastily,  as if he were almost aware of his breach of good manners, \"But, I say,  how old are you?\"    Dick and the pretty girl both burst out laughing, as if Robert's conduct  were excusable on the grounds of eccentricity; and Dick said amidst his  laughter:    \"Hold hard, Bob; this questioning of guests won't do.  Why, much learning  is spoiling you.  You remind me of the radical cobblers in the silly old  novels, who, according to the authors, were prepared to trample down all  good manners in the pursuit of utilitarian knowledge.  The fact is, I  begin to think that you have so muddled your head with mathematics, and  with grubbing into those idiotic old books about political economy (he  he!), that you scarcely know how to behave.  Really, it is about time for  you to take to some open-air work, so that you may clear away the cobwebs  from your brain.\"    The weaver only laughed good-humouredly; and the girl went up to him and  patted his cheek and said laughingly, \"Poor fellow! he was born so.\"    As for me, I was a little puzzled, but I laughed also, partly for  company's sake, and partly with pleasure at their unanxious happiness and  good temper; and before Robert could make the excuse to me which he was  getting ready, I said:    \"But neighbours\" (I had caught up that word), \"I don't in the least mind  answering questions, when I can do so: ask me as many as you please; it's  fun for me.  I will tell you all about Epping Forest when I was a boy, if  you please; and as to my age, I'm not a fine lady, you know, so why  shouldn't I tell you?  I'm hard on fifty-six.\"    In spite of the recent lecture on good manners, the weaver could not help  giving a long \"whew\" of astonishment, and the others were so amused by  his _naivete_ that the merriment flitted all over their faces, though for  courtesy's sake they forbore actual laughter; while I looked from one to  the other in a puzzled manner, and at last said:    \"Tell me, please, what is amiss: you know I want to learn from you.  And  please laugh; only tell me.\"    Well, they _did_ laugh, and I joined them again, for the above-stated  reasons.  But at last the pretty woman said coaxingly--    \"Well, well, he _is_ rude, poor fellow! but you see I may as well tell  you what he is thinking about: he means that you look rather old for your  age.  But surely there need be no wonder in that, since you have been  travelling; and clearly from all you have been saying, in unsocial  countries.  It has often been said, and no doubt truly, that one ages  very quickly if one lives amongst unhappy people.  Also they say that  southern England is a good place for keeping good looks.\"  She blushed  and said: \"How old am I, do you think?\"    \"Well,\" quoth I, \"I have always been told that a woman is as old as she  looks, so without offence or flattery, I should say that you were  twenty.\"    She laughed merrily, and said, \"I am well served out for fishing for  compliments, since I have to tell you the truth, to wit, that I am forty-  two.\"    I stared at her, and drew musical laughter from her again; but I might  well stare, for there was not a careful line on her face; her skin was as  smooth as ivory, her cheeks full and round, her lips as red as the roses  she had brought in; her beautiful arms, which she had bared for her work,  firm and well-knit from shoulder to wrist.  She blushed a little under my  gaze, though it was clear that she had taken me for a man of eighty; so  to pass it off I said--    \"Well, you see, the old saw is proved right again, and I ought not to  have let you tempt me into asking you a rude question.\"    She laughed again, and said: \"Well, lads, old and young, I must get to my  work now.  We shall be rather busy here presently; and I want to clear it  off soon, for I began to read a pretty old book yesterday, and I want to  get on with it this morning: so good-bye for the present.\"    She waved a hand to us, and stepped lightly down the hall, taking (as  Scott says) at least part of the sun from our table as she went.    When she was gone, Dick said \"Now guest, won't you ask a question or two  of our friend here?  It is only fair that you should have your turn.\"    \"I shall be very glad to answer them,\" said the weaver.    \"If I ask you any questions, sir,\" said I, \"they will not be very severe;  but since I hear that you are a weaver, I should like to ask you  something about that craft, as I am--or was--interested in it.\"    \"Oh,\" said he, \"I shall not be of much use to you there, I'm afraid.  I  only do the most mechanical kind of weaving, and am in fact but a poor  craftsman, unlike Dick here.  Then besides the weaving, I do a little  with machine printing and composing, though I am little use at the finer  kinds of printing; and moreover machine printing is beginning to die out,  along with the waning of the plague of book-making, so I have had to turn  to other things that I have a taste for, and have taken to mathematics;  and also I am writing a sort of antiquarian book about the peaceable and  private history, so to say, of the end of the nineteenth century,--more  for the sake of giving a picture of the country before the fighting began  than for anything else.  That was why I asked you those questions about  Epping Forest.  You have rather puzzled me, I confess, though your  information was so interesting.  But later on, I hope, we may have some  more talk together, when our friend Dick isn't here.  I know he thinks me  rather a grinder, and despises me for not being very deft with my hands:  that's the way nowadays.  From what I have read of the nineteenth century  literature (and I have read a good deal), it is clear to me that this is  a kind of revenge for the stupidity of that day, which despised everybody  who _could_ use his hands.  But Dick, old fellow, _Ne quid nimis_!  Don't  overdo it!\"    \"Come now,\" said Dick, \"am I likely to?  Am I not the most tolerant man  in the world?  Am I not quite contented so long as you don't make me  learn mathematics, or go into your new science of aesthetics, and let me  do a little practical aesthetics with my gold and steel, and the blowpipe  and the nice little hammer?  But, hillo! here comes another questioner  for you, my poor guest.  I say, Bob, you must help me to defend him now.\"    \"Here, Boffin,\" he cried out, after a pause; \"here we are, if you must  have it!\"    I looked over my shoulder, and saw something flash and gleam in the  sunlight that lay across the hall; so I turned round, and at my ease saw  a splendid figure slowly sauntering over the pavement; a man whose  surcoat was embroidered most copiously as well as elegantly, so that the  sun flashed back from him as if he had been clad in golden armour.  The  man himself was tall, dark-haired, and exceedingly handsome, and though  his face was no less kindly in expression than that of the others, he  moved with that somewhat haughty mien which great beauty is apt to give  to both men and women.  He came and sat down at our table with a smiling  face, stretching out his long legs and hanging his arm over the chair in  the slowly graceful way which tall and well-built people may use without  affectation.  He was a man in the prime of life, but looked as happy as a  child who has just got a new toy.  He bowed gracefully to me and said--    \"I see clearly that you are the guest, of whom Annie has just told me,  who have come from some distant country that does not know of us, or our  ways of life.  So I daresay you would not mind answering me a few  questions; for you see--\"    Here Dick broke in: \"No, please, Boffin! let it alone for the present.  Of  course you want the guest to be happy and comfortable; and how can that  be if he has to trouble himself with answering all sorts of questions  while he is still confused with the new customs and people about him?  No,  no: I am going to take him where he can ask questions himself, and have  them answered; that is, to my great-grandfather in Bloomsbury: and I am  sure you can't have anything to say against that.  So instead of  bothering, you had much better go out to James Allen's and get a carriage  for me, as I shall drive him up myself; and please tell Jim to let me  have the old grey, for I can drive a wherry much better than a carriage.  Jump up, old fellow, and don't be disappointed; our guest will keep  himself for you and your stories.\"    I stared at Dick; for I wondered at his speaking to such a  dignified-looking personage so familiarly, not to say curtly; for I  thought that this Mr. Boffin, in spite of his well-known name out of  Dickens, must be at the least a senator of these strange people.  However,  he got up and said, \"All right, old oar-wearer, whatever you like; this  is not one of my busy days; and though\" (with a condescending bow to me)  \"my pleasure of a talk with this learned guest is put off, I admit that  he ought to see your worthy kinsman as soon as possible.

Hist., 15:48, December      20, 1961.    _Diagnosis._--Maximum snout-vent length in males, 48 mm.; snout in  dorsal profile rounded; tarsal fold short and weak; inner metatarsal  tubercle moderate in size and elliptical; outer metatarsal tubercle  small, round, and indistinct; webbing extending to base of penultimate  phalanx of fourth toe; nuptial spines on thumb small; weak thoracic  fold present; anal opening above level of middle of thighs; dorsum  dark brown with dark reticulations; venter brown with cream-colored  flecks; flanks brown with creamy white spots; anal stripe absent;  small white spots in anal region; vocal slits absent.    _Description._--The following description is based on KU 57651 from El  Chico Parque Nacional, Hidalgo. Adult male having a snout-vent length  of 45.1 mm.; tibia length, 22.1 mm., 49.0 per cent of snout-vent  length; foot length (measured from proximal edge of inner metatarsal  tubercle to tip of longest toe), 21.5 mm.; greatest width of head,  13.7 mm., 30.4 per cent of snout-vent length; head length, 12.6 mm.,  27.9 per cent of snout-vent length; diameter of eye, 4.0 mm.; diameter  of tympanum, 1.8 mm., 45 per cent of diameter of eye. Snout short, in  lateral profile blunt, in dorsal profile round; canthus rounded;  loreal region slightly concave; lips thick, round, and not flaring;  nostrils slightly protuberant; internarial distance, 3.6 mm.;  interorbital distance, 4.0 mm., slightly broader than width of eyelid,  3.5 mm. A moderately heavy dermal fold from posterior corner of eye  above tympanum and curving downward towards insertion of forearm;  tympanum nearly round, covered by dermal fold above, its diameter  slightly less than its distance from eye. Forearm moderately robust;  distinct fold on wrist; prepollex much enlarged with patch of small  nuptial spines continuous on side of digit; similar line of nuptial  spines on inner edge of second finger; subarticular tubercles round,  moderate in size, none bifid; supernumerary tubercles small and  present only proximally; fingers long and slender; length of fingers  from shortest to longest, 1-2-4-3; discs moderately large, that on  third finger about size of tympanum; no web between first and second  fingers; rudimentary web between other fingers. Legs robust; heels  over-lap by about one-fourth length of shank when hind limbs  adpressed; tibiotarsal articulation extending to posterior corner of  eye; tarsal fold weak, extending to about middle of tarsus; inner  metatarsal tubercle moderately large, flat, and elliptical; outer  metatarsal tubercle small, round, and indistinct; subarticular  tubercles round; supernumerary tubercles small, in single row on  proximal segments of each digit; toes moderately long and slender;  length of toes from shortest to longest, 1-2-5-3-4, the fifth nearly  as long as third; toes nearly fully webbed; web extending to base of  penultimate phalanx of fourth toe and to discs on other toes; discs  small, about two-thirds size of those on fingers. Anal opening above  middle of thighs; anal sheath short, deeply creased medially; heavy  transverse dermal fold above anus; no large anal tubercles. Skin of  all dorsal surfaces, chin, and ventral surfaces of limbs, except  proximal parts of thighs, smooth; belly and proximal parts of thighs  areolate; thoracic fold present, weak. Tongue elliptical, slightly  longer than wide, not notched behind, and free posteriorly for about  one-fourth of its length; vomerine teeth 3-3, situated on small,  widely separated, transverse ridges between rather small elliptical  inner nares; no vocal slits.    Color (in alcohol) dark brown with irregular darker reticulations on  dorsal surfaces of head, body, and limbs; flanks brown with small  creamy white spots; posterior surfaces of thighs dark brown; chin  creamy tan; belly grayish brown with cream-colored flecks; ventral  surfaces of limbs pale brown; webbing on feet gray; small white spots  in anal region.    Color (in life) chocolate brown with darker brown reticulations and  irregular blotches above; flanks brown with yellow spots; belly gray  to grayish brown with faint cream-colored spots; iris a deep bronze  color.    _Variation._--In males the total number of vomerine teeth varies from  4 to 7. In many specimens the vomerine ridges are larger and more  closely approximated medially than in the specimen described above.  Females attain snout-vent lengths of 51 mm., have as many as 9  vomerine teeth, and have a proportionately larger tympanum than males.  Some of the largest specimens of both sexes have indistinct  cream-colored pustules scattered on the ventral surface of the  forearm. Some individuals have nearly uniform grayish brown ventral  surfaces; in others the chin, as well as the abdomen, is brown with  cream-colored spots. The dorsal surfaces of some specimens are nearly  uniform dark brown with no reticulations. In others the dorsum is  paler brown with distinct darker mottling; in some of these there is  little mottling laterally, so that there is the effect of an  irregular, pale brown, dorsolateral stripe.    _Tadpoles._--The tadpoles of this species were described by Rabb and  Mosimann (1955). Tadpoles obtained from streams at 3.3 kilometers  north and at 8.5 kilometers southeast of Zacualtipan, Hidalgo, are  like those described by Rabb and Mosimann in having 2/3 tooth rows,  peglike serrations on the beaks, and long rounded tails. The largest  tadpole (KU 60078) has small hind legs, a body length of 22 mm., and a  total length of 61 mm.    _Remarks._--Taylor (1940:393) found frogs of this species in plants  along small spring-fed rivulets in an open meadow at El Chico  Parque Nacional. Also, he noted that active frogs dove into the  streams and took refuge in the mud on the bottom. Rabb and  Mosimann (1955:1) found this species along banks of tiny streams  in open meadows and noted that the frogs sought refuge in the  water. At El Chico Parque Nacional on June 8, 1960, I found _Hyla  robertsorum_ under rocks along small rivulets by day; at night, when  the temperature was 14 deg. C., frogs were sitting on rocks and in  junipers overhanging a small stream. At the same locality on June  23 and 24, 1962, frogs of this species were found on rainy nights,  when the temperature varied from 10 to 12 deg. C. At this time the  frogs were sitting on the grassy banks of rivulets in the meadow.  During the day _Hyla robertsorum_ was found on the earthen banks  of the rivulets in places where dense growths of grass overhung  the streams. On December 23, 1959, one specimen of _Hyla robertsorum_  was found beneath a rock in a small stream in pine forest at  3.3 kilometers north of Zacualtipan.    Rabb and Mosimann (1955:1) obtained tadpoles of _Hyla robertsorum_  from quiet pools of a stream at El Chico Parque Nacional. I  found tadpoles in pools in rocky streams in pine forest at 3.3 kilometers  north and at 8.5 kilometers southeast of Zacualtipan. Four  completely metamorphosed juveniles obtained on June 8, 1960, at  El Chico Parque Nacional have snout-vent lengths of 30.6 to  32.0 mm. Gravid females were found at the same locality on June  8, 1960, and June 23, 1962.        [Illustration: FIG. 4. Map showing locality records for      _Hyla crassa_, _Hyla pachyderma_, and _Hyla robertsorum_.]    _Distribution.--Hyla robertsorum_ inhabits streams in the pine and fir  forests in the higher parts (2250 to 3050 meters) of the Sierra Madre  Oriental in extreme northern Puebla and eastern Hidalgo (Fig. 4).
