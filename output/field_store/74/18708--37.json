Since the rows are diagonally  arranged, it is necessary in counting scales to proceed either  anteriorly or posteriorly across the back; or the row may be counted in  either direction up to the center of the back and then reversed on the  other side of the snake. In order to count the scale rows in a position  where no scale reduction or addition was occurring and to avoid as much  error as possible, I counted from anterior to center and back on the  neck, in any direction at mid-body, and from posterior to center and  back near the anus. Because females generally are the larger in  circumference posteriorly, they could have more scale rows than males  just anterior to the anus. The few snakes having more than 21 scale rows  in the posterior region offer no conclusive evidence as to tendencies,  but in both instances in which this occurred the females outnumbered the  males three to one. An odd, rather than an even, number of scale rows  occurs on most of the length of the snakes examined, because there is a  mid-dorsal row and scale rows tend to be lost on both sides at about the  same level. An example of scale reduction of one snake was as follows:          6+7 (13)                  6+7 (96)     27 --------  25 --------  24 --------   23 ---------  22 ---------        5+6 (13)     5+6 (90)                   7+8 (111)     7+8 (114)                                    6+7 (122)                  +7, -5 (125)     23 --------  22 --------  23 ---------  21 --------  22 ------------        -6 (118)     +6 (119)     6+7 (121)     +6 (123)          -6 (126)     22 --------  21 (130).    This scale reduction follows the method proposed by Dowling (1951b: 133)  in which the numbers on the mid-line represent the number of scale rows,  upper figures refer to the right side of the snake, and figures in  parentheses indicate the number of the ventral scale (counted from the  anterior end of the series), thus marking the position of the addition  or reduction. Addition of a row is shown by a plus sign and the number  of the row, whereas reductions are shown by a minus sign and the number  of the row that is lost or by a plus sign between the number of two rows  that join. According to Dowling, variation in number of dorsal scales  characterizes the few genera and species of snakes in which it has been  studied. The time and difficulty involved in ascertaining the number of  scales explain why it has not been widely used in classification.    [Illustration: FIG. 2. Number of ventral scales in 48 female and 34  male _A. p. leucostoma_.]    Ventral scales on 34 males averaged 134.4 (128 to 139), and on 48  females 133.5 (128 to 137) (Fig. 2.). Barbour (1956:34) found an average  of 135.3 ventral scales on 64 males and 44 females, and Gloyd and Conant  (_loc. cit._) found an average of 134 for both males and females. The  average for the eastern cottonmouth obtained by Gloyd and Conant,  however, was 137 ventrals in both sexes. Some of my counts were made  before I knew of the standard system of counting ventrals proposed by  Dowling (1951a:97-99), in which the first ventral plate is defined as  the most anterior one bordered on both sides by the first row of  dorsals. Therefore, some inconsistencies may exist in my counts. Where  differences occur, Dowling's method probably will indicate the presence  of an additional scale, since it appears to begin farther anteriorly on  the average, than I began counting.

In the six  specimens from Tennessee, Blanchard (1922:16) found the same thing.  Caudals averaged 45.4 (41 to 50) on 34 males and 42.6 (39 to 49) on 44  females (Fig. 3). Barbour (_loc. cit._) found an average of 45.7 (30 to  54) caudals in males and 43 (17 to 56) in females. Caudal scale counts  by Gloyd and Conant (_loc. cit._) averaged 44 (38 to 49) in males and 42  (37 to 48) in females of _leucostoma_; in _piscivorus_ they averaged 48  (42 to 53) in males and 44 (41 to 49) in females. Another  seldom-mentioned, unusual characteristic of the caudal scales of  copperheads and cottonmouths is that some are single (usually those at  the base of the tail) and others divided (Table 5). To my knowledge, all  other species have either single or divided scales the entire length of  the tail. See Klauber (1941:73) and Fox (1948:252) concerning  correlation of few scales with warm environment.      Dentition    Cottonmouths, like other pit-vipers, have their teeth reduced in number  and have enlarged, highly specialized fangs. Small teeth occur on the  palatine and the pterygoid in the upper jaw and on the dentary in the  lower jaw. The dentary bone bears 17 curved teeth that decrease in size  posteriorly. The palatine bears five small, strongly curved teeth, and  the pterygoid bears 16 to 18 strongly curved teeth decreasing in size  posteriorly. The numbers of teeth mentioned above in each instance refer  to the number of sockets rather than the actual number of teeth, because  teeth are frequently shed, leaving some of the sockets empty at any one  time.    The maxillary bone has two sockets side by side which bear the poison  fangs, usually one at a time. During the period shortly before a fang is  to be shed, however, its replacement becomes attached in the alternate  socket; and both fangs may be functional for a short time. The old fang  then becomes weakened at its base, eventually breaks off, and is  swallowed. At any one time four or five replacement fangs in various  stages of development are found in the gum behind the functional fang.  These replacement fangs, which are arranged in alternate rows, gradually  enlarge as they move forward in their development and, in juveniles, are  generally slightly longer than the fangs that they replace.    In 1963 I examined the fangs of 14 cottonmouths at four- to seven-day  intervals for a period of six weeks. The fang-shedding cycle was found  to be highly irregular, with a double condition (on one or both sides)  occurring one-third of the time. Approximately the same proportion of  double fangs was found in preserved individuals. A replacement period of  at least five days was observed in one snake. One-half the cycle (from  replacement on one side to replacement on the other) varied from five to  twenty days, indicating that the cycles for each fang are independent of  one another. Bogert (1943:324) found that young rattlesnakes are born  with functional fangs in the two inner sockets. Nonsynchronous use of  the sockets on opposite sides of the head in rattlesnakes is a later  development which results from accidents or other conditions leading to  a longer retention of the fang on one side than on the other (Klauber,  1956:723). I found a double set of fangs in cottonmouths only twice in  the six-week period. A complete cycle was recorded in ten instances in a  period of 19 to 23 days and in two instances in 32 days. One cottonmouth  was examined periodically over a 34-day period by Allen and Swindell  (1948:12), but a complete fang-shedding cycle was not observed. Fitch  (1960:110) reported a 33-day cycle in copperheads; Klauber (1956:726)  estimated the normal active life of each fang of an adult rattlesnake to  be from six to ten weeks, but he made no observations to confirm his  estimation.    Fangs measured from the tip of the notch of the basal lumen to the end  of the fang vary from about 1.3 per cent of the snout-vent length in  juveniles to about 1.0 per cent in large adults (Table 6). The fangs are  longer than those of copperheads (Fitch, 1960:111). Klauber's (1956:736)  figures on fang-lengths in all species of rattlesnakes are percentages  of total length rather than of the snout-vent length. The fangs of  various species of rattlesnakes range from nearly the same proportionate  length"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38315"],[0,"Artistic Anatomy of Animals (#4)"],[1,"mammals.    We find, in studying the regions of the body in some of the vertebrates,  that, while they present differences from the corresponding regions of  the human body, they also offer most striking analogies. We can, for  example, recognise the upper limb of man in the anterior one of  quadrupeds, in the wing of the bat, in the paddle of the seal, etc. It  is, so to speak, those variations of a great plan which give such a  charm to the study of comparative anatomy.    The division of classes into orders, which we have just mentioned,  being still too general, it was found necessary to establish  subdivisions--more and more specialized--to which the names _families_,  _genera_, _species_, and _varieties_ were given.          CHAPTER I    OSTEOLOGY AND ARTHROLOGY      THE TRUNK    The Vertebral Column    We commence the study of the skeleton with a description of the trunk.    The trunk being, in quadrupeds, horizontal in direction (Fig. 1), the  two regions of which it consists occupy, for this reason, the following  positions: the thorax occupies the anterior part, the abdomen is placed  behind it; the vertebral column is horizontal, and is situated at the  superior aspect of the trunk; it projects beyond the latter: anteriorly,  to articulate with the skull; and, posteriorly, to form the skeleton of  the tail, or caudal appendix.    The number of the vertebrae is not the same in all mammalia. Of the  several regions of the vertebral column, the cervical shows the greatest  uniformity in the number of the vertebrae of which it consists, with but  two exceptions (eight or nine in the three-toed sloth, and six in the  manatee); we always find seven cervical vertebrae, whatever the length of  the neck of the animal. There are no more than seven vertebrae in the  long neck of the giraffe, but they are very long ones; and not less than  seven in the very short neck of the dolphin, in which they are reduced  to mere plates of bone not thicker than sheets of cardboard. If the  cervical region presents uniformity in the number of its bones, it is  not so with the other regions of the column.    The following table shows their classification in some animals:    VERTEBRAE.      +------------+-----------+---------+---------+    |            | Cervical. | Dorsal. | Lumbar. |    +------------+-----------+---------+---------+    | Bear       |    7      |    14   |    6    |    | Dog        |    7      |    13   |    7    |    | Cat        |    7      |    13   |    7    |    | Rabbit     |    7      |    12   |    7    |    | Pig        |    7      |    14   |  6 or 7 |    | Horse      |    7      |    18   |  6 or 5 |    | Ass        |    7      |    18   |    5    |    | Camel      |    7      |    12   |    7    |    | Giraffe    |    7      |    14   |    5    |    | Ox         |    7      |    13   |    6    |    | Sheep      |    7      |    13   |    6    |    +------------+-----------+---------+---------+    [Illustration: FIG. 1.--A HUMAN SKELETON IN THE ATTITUDE OF A QUADRUPED.  TO GIVE A GENERAL IDEA OF THE POSITION OF THE BONES IN OTHER  VERTEBRATES.]    It is worthy of notice that in birds the number of the cervical vertebrae  is not constant, as in mammals; they are more numerous than the dorsal.  These latter are almost always joined to one another by a fusion of  their spinous processes; the two or three last vertebrae are similarly  united to the iliac bones, between which they are fixed. The dorsal  vertebrae thus form one piece, which gives solidity to the trunk, and  provides a base of support to the wings, for the movements of flying.  There are, so to speak, no lumbar vertebrae, the bones of that region,  which cannot be differentiated from the sacrum, having coalesced with  the bones of the pelvis.

Of the  cervical vertebrae, the atlas and axis call for special notice. Apropos  of the atlas, we find that it, in the human being, is narrower than the  corresponding parts of the skull, and is therefore hidden under the base  of the cranium (Fig. 2); in quadrupeds its width is equal to that of the  skull, and sometimes exceeds, because of the great development of its  wing-shaped transverse processes, that of the neighbouring parts of the  head (Fig. 3). On this account those transverse processes often project  under the skin of the lateral surfaces of the upper part of the neck.    [Illustration: FIG. 2.--SIZE OF THE ATLAS COMPARED WITH THE TRANSVERSE  DIMENSIONS OF THE CORRESPONDING PARTS OF THE SKULL IN MAN.    1, Atlas; 2, mastoid process; 3, external occipital protuberance; 4,  inferior maxilla.]    The axis is furnished on its anterior surface with the odontoid process,  which articulates with the anterior (or inferior) arch of the atlas,  according to the direction of the neck. The spinous process, flattened  from without inwards, is more or less pointed; it is elongated from  before backwards, so as partly to overlap the atlas and the third  cervical vertebra.    We find that this process overlaps less and less the neighbouring  vertebrae when we examine in succession the bear, the cat, the dog, the  ox, and the horse. With regard to the other vertebrae of this region,  they diminish in width from the second to the seventh; and, in some  animals, the anterior surface of the body presents a tubercle which  articulates with a cavity hollowed in the posterior surface of that of  the vertebra before it; this feature dwindles away in the dorsal and  lumbar regions.    The spinous process, slightly developed in the third cervical vertebra,  gradually increases in size to the seventh, the spinous process of  which, long and pointed, well deserves the name of _the prominent_ which  is bestowed on it; but it should not be forgotten that the spinous  process of the axis is equally developed.    [Illustration: FIG. 3.--SIZE OF THE ATLAS COMPARED WITH THE TRANSVERSE  DIMENSIONS OF THE CORRESPONDING REGIONS OF THE SKULL IN A DOG.    1, Atlas; 2, zygomatic arch; 3, external occipital protuberance; 4,  inferior maxilla.]    On the inferior surface of the body of each of the vertebrae is found a  prominent crest, especially well marked at the posterior part; this  crest is but slightly developed in the bear and in the cat tribe, and is  not found in swine.    The transverse processes of the cervical vertebrae, from their relation  to the trachea, are known as the _tracheal processes_.    The most marked characteristic of the dorsal vertebrae is furnished by  the spinous processes. They are long and narrow. As a rule, the spinous  processes of the foremost dorsal vertebrae are the most developed and  are directed obliquely upwards and backwards. As we approach the last  vertebrae of this region, the processes become shorter and tend to become  vertical, and the last ones are even, in some cases, directed upwards  and forwards; this disposition is well marked in the dog and the cat. In  the cetaceans, on the contrary, the length of the spinous processes  increases from the first to the last.    [Illustration: FIG. 4.--LUMBAR VERTEBRAE OF A QUADRUPED (THE HORSE):  SUPERIOR SURFACE.    1, Spinous process; 2, anterior articular process and transverse process  of the first lumbar vertebra of the left side; 3, costiform process.]    In the horse the spinous processes of the first dorsal vertebrae produce  the prominence at the anterior limit of the trunk, where the mane ends,  which is known as the _withers_.    The lumbar vertebrae are thicker than the preceding; they are known by  their short and latterly-flattened spinous processes, and still more  readily by their transverse processes, which, as they are evidently  atrophied ribs, it is more accurate to denominate costiform processes  (Fig. 4). These are long, flattened from above downwards, and directed  outwards and forwards.    The true transverse processes are represented by tubercles situated on  the superior borders of the articular processes of each of the vertebrae  of the lumbar region. Apropos of these different osseous processes, we  are reminded that they are also present in the human skeleton.    In the horse the costiform processes of the fifth and sixth lumbar  vertebrae articulate, and are sometimes ankylosed, one with the other;  the terminal ones articulate with the base of the sacrum.
