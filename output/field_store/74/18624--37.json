I don't believe any of you little folks  have ever traveled as fast as that behind a locomotive.    Then our roosting places! Ah, you ought to see us there! There was one  in Kentucky, I remember, in a dense forest, where the trees were very  large, a forest forty miles long and three wide, larger than many  cities. The Pigeons began to collect after sunset, thousands upon  thousands, flock after flock continuing to arrive even after midnight.  There were not trees enough to go around, and so many of us perched upon  one limb that the largest branches broke, killing hundreds of Pigeons in  their fall. The noise we made could be heard at the distance of three  miles. People who like Pigeon pie came with long poles and guns, and  when morning broke, and the Pigeons that could fly had disappeared,  there were heaps and heaps of little fellows lying dead upon the ground.    We occupied that roost about two weeks. When we left it for good, the  forest looked like it had been swept by a tornado.     [Illustration: From col. Ruthven Deane.

Mamma laughed.    \"He does look solemn,\" she agreed, \"but about his wisdom I am not so  certain. Turn to the text and let us see what he does say about  himself.\"    \"_Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!_\"    \"That doesn't sound very wise,\" said Bobbie, reading aloud, \"though Mr.  Shouter's preaching sounds like that to me sometimes.\"    \"Does it?\" replied mamma, suppressing a smile, \"well, go on and see what  else he says.\"    \"I'm not a Screech Owl, nor a Barn Owl, nor a Great Horned Owl, nor a  Long-eared Owl, though I am related to each of them. Mr. Screech Owl  thinks he is a singer, and so does Mr. Horned Owl. Between you and me,  I think both their songs most doleful ditties. One gentleman says Mr.  Horned Owl hoots in B flat, another says in F sharp, and another in A  flat. I must confess it all sounds very flat to me. I don't pretend to  sing at all. Sometimes I feel like saying something, just to hear the  sound of my own voice, and then I shout '_Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!_' as loud  as I can. If there are little Owls in the nest, and anything approaches  them, I give a shrill, hollow cry, at the same time snapping my bill  spitefully.    \"I am sometimes called the Marsh Owl, because I frequent the grassy  marshes instead of the woods. I don't confine myself to prowling around  only in the night time, like some Owls I know, but you will see me about  also on dark days, and sometimes even when the sun is shining.    \"My eyes, you see, are round and yellow just like a cat's, shining in  the dark like his. Indeed there is a good deal of the cat in my nature.  When stealing on my prey I go about it just as stealthily as he does.  Like him I catch mice too, but I also like beetles, gophers, and all  sorts of little water birds.    \"I have only two eyes, but I have two sets of eyelids. One I draw over  my eyes in the day time, a thin sort of curtain to keep out the light,  and the other a heavy curtain which I pull down when I go to sleep. I'm  going to sleep now. Good night! or, rather, good morning!\"          THE SHORT-EARED OWL.      Marsh Owl, Meadow Owl, and Prairie Owl, are some of the names of this  species of an interesting family, which is found throughout North  America at large, though in greater numbers in the Arctic regions during  the nesting season than in the United States. It is believed that no  land bird has so extensive a range as this species, occurring, as it  does, throughout all the grand divisions of the earth's surface, except  Australia. In America it is found everywhere in favorable localities,  from Alaska and Greenland to Cape Horn. Truly a cosmopolitan bird,  observed by the inhabitants of nearly all countries.    The Short-eared Owl is seen in the marshes, the thickets of bottom  lands, and Davie says it seems to be particularly common in the tall  weeds and grass of fields and meadows. In the west it is found on the  extensive prairies, along sloughs, hiding in the day-time among the sage  bushes and tall grass. It is a night wanderer, but often hunts its food  on dark days, and field mice, moles, shrews, and other small rodents are  captured by it while on noiseless wing, or while standing motionless  watching for its prey.    The nest of the Short-eared Owl is made on the ground in the matted  grass of marsh land; sometimes in a depression at the foot of a bush,  beside a log, or in a burrow made by a rabbit or a muskrat. A few  sticks, soft grasses, and some of its own feathers usually comprise  the nest proper, though the eggs are not infrequently laid on the bare  ground. These are from four to seven, white and oval. In Ohio they are  laid in April, sometimes as early as the latter part of March, or as  late as the middle of May, within which dates it doubtless may be found  breeding throughout the United States.    Mr. Nelson says that this is the most abundant species of the Owl  family. They are common everywhere in Illinois during the winter,  remaining concealed in a bunch of grass or weeds until almost two  o'clock p.m., when they commence flying low over the ground in search of  food. When approached, while standing on the ground, they crouch and try  to escape observation. They are harmless and are easily tamed, and as a  rule, are silent. Mr. Nelson heard one of the birds, in Alaska, utter  rapidly a loud cry which sounded like the syllables _Hoo, hoo, hoo,  hoo_, in a higher key than the note of the Horned Owl, and in a much  less sonorous tone. When alarmed for their young, they have been heard  to utter a shrill hollow cry, and at the same time make quite a noise by  spitefully snapping their bills.    We fancy the Owl family alone will enable BIRDS to furnish a collection  of pictures--perhaps forty in number--that will fascinate the bird  lover, and make him eager to possess other groups for study, wonder, and  delight.

I look like a foreigner, don't I? You may search through the forests of  America and you won't find a bird that looks like me.    My family live in New Guinea; we speak English when we get among English  people, Spanish when we get among Spanish people, and French when we get  among French people.    If you don't believe it, just say \"_Parlez-vous Francais, Monsieur?_\"  and see how quickly I'll open my pretty mouth and answer \"_Oui._\"    If you don't understand that, ask your teacher what it means. I once  lived in a French family, you see.    You don't think my mouth is pretty, did you say? Well, that is according  to taste. I think it is. Of course, my bill turns in like a hook, as  Miss Poll Parrot's does, and my tongue is thick like hers, but I fancy I  talk much plainer than she does. Anyway I talk louder. Why, if you  should happen to hear, without seeing me, you would think it was a  man's strong voice talking to a deaf person.    And then my laugh! You should hear me laugh when I'm angry. Whew! Have  you ever heard a hyena in the Zoo? Well, it sounds something like that.    I am a large, handsome bird. My eyes also are large, and so are my feet.  That is the reason I not only talk, but walk Spanish, I suppose.    But, my cap! That is what distinguishes me. You never saw a common  Parrot with a crest like that. When I am angry the feathers stand  straight up, opening and closing just like a lady's fan.    The next time your mamma or papa takes you to the Zoo, turn to the cage  of foreign birds and see if one of our family is not there. Maybe he  will talk to you and maybe he'll not. He would if you could get into his  cage and stroke his head. I am sure he would laugh if you tell him _Mr.  Rose Cockatoo_ sends his love.          THE ROSE COCKATOO.      The Rose Cockatoo, as may be seen, is a remarkably handsome bird. The  species is gregarious, and they are very numerous in South Australia,  where they frequent woods and feed on seeds, fruits, and larvae of  insects. Their note is harsh and unmusical. The young ones tame readily  and some species show remarkable intelligence. They associate in flocks  of from one hundred to one thousand and do great damage to newly planted  grain, for which reason they are mercilessly destroyed by farmers. Two  eggs only, of a pure white color, are laid in the holes of decayed trees  or in the fissures of rocks, according to the nature of the locality in  which they live.    This is a rather large bird, equalling a common fowl in dimensions, and  assuming a much larger form when it ruffles up its feathers while under  the influence of anger. Many of these birds are fine talkers, and their  voice is peculiarly full and loud.    An authentic anecdote is told of a Cockatoo which was quite celebrated  for its powers of conversation; but as he was moulting at the time, his  voice was temporarily silenced, and he sat in a very disconsolate manner  on his perch, looking as if he had fallen into a puddle and not had time  to arrange his plumage. All the breast and fore-parts of the body were  quite bare of feathers and even the beautiful crest had a sodden and  woe-begone look. By dint, however, of talking to the bird and rubbing  his head, he was induced to say a few words, which were given in a  voice as full and rounded as that of a strong voiced man accustomed to  talking to deaf"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34175"],[0,"Domestic Animals (#4)"],[1,"ively, as  low as the sixth generation.    8th. It is always better to avoid close relationship, by the selection  of equally meritorious stock-getters of the same breed, from other  sources.    9th. Wholesome, nutritious food, at all times sufficient to keep the  animals steadily advancing, should be provided, but they must never be  allowed to get fat. Of the two evils, starving is preferable to surfeit.  Careful treatment, and the absence of disease, must be always fully  considered.    10th. Animals should never be allowed to breed either too early or too  late in life. These periods cannot be arbitrarily laid down, but must  depend on their time of maturity, the longevity of the breed, and the  stamina of the individual.    11th. No violent cross, or mixing of distinct breeds, should ever be  admitted for the purposes of perpetuation, as of cattle of diverse  sizes; horses of unlike characters; the Merino and the long-wools, or  even the long, or short, and the middle-wools. For carcass and  constitution, these crosses are unexceptionable; and it is a practice  very common in this country, and judicious enough where the whole  produce is early destined for the shambles. But when the progeny are  designed for breeders, the practice should be branded with unqualified  reprehension.      GENERAL FORM AND CHARACTERISTICS.    Within certain limits, these may be reduced to a common standard. All  animals should have a good head, well set up; a clean fine muzzle, and a  blight, clear and full, yet perfectly placid eye. With the exception of  the dog and cat, whose original nature is ferocity, and whose whole  life, unless diverted from their natural instincts, is plunder and prey;  and the jockey racehorse, which is required to take the purse, at any  hazard of life or limb to the groom; a mild, quiet eye is indispensable  to the profitable use of the domestic brute. The neck should be well  formed, not too long, tapering to its junction with the head, and  gradually enlarging to a firm, well-expanded attachment to the back,  shoulders, and breast. The back or chine should be short, straight, and  broad; the ribs springing out from the backbone nearly at right angles,  giving a rounded appearance to the carcass, and reaching well behind to  a close proximity to the hip; tail well set on, and full at its junction  with the body, yet gradually tapering to fineness; thighs, fore-arms,  and crops well developed; projecting breast or brisket; the fore-legs  straight, and hind ones properly bent, strong and full where attached to  the carcass, but small and tapering below; good and sound joints; dense,  strong bones, but not large; plenty of fine muscle in the right places;  and hair or wool, fine and soft. The chest in all animals should be  full, for it will be invariably found, that only such will do the most  work, or fatten easiest on the least food.      The Lungs.    From the last-mentioned principle, founded on long experience and  observation, Cline inferred, and he has laid it down as an  incontrovertible position, that the lungs should always be large; and  Youatt expresses the same opinion. This is undoubtedly correct as to  working beasts, the horse and the ox, which require full and free  respiration, to enable them to sustain great muscular efforts. But later  physiologists have assumed, perhaps from closer and more accurate  observations, that the fattening propensity is in the ratio of the  smallness of the lungs. Earl Spencer has observed, that this is fully  shown in the pig, the sheep, the ox, and the horse, whose aptitude to  fatten and smallness of lungs, are in the order enumerated.    This position is further illustrated by the different breeds of the same  classes of animals. The Leicester sheep have smaller lungs than the  South Down; and it has been found, that a number of the former, on a  given quantity of food, and in the same time, reached 28 lbs. a quarter,  while the South Downs with a greater consumption of food, attained in  the same period, only 18 lbs. The Chinese pigs have much smaller lungs  than the Irish, and the former will fatten to a given weight, on a much  less quantity of food than the latter. (_Playfair._) The principle would  seem to be corroborated by the fact, that animals generally fatten  faster in proportion to the quantity of food they consume, as they  advance towards a certain stage of maturity; during all which time, the  secretion of internal fat is gradually compressing the size, by reducing  the room for the action of the lungs. Hence, the advantage of carrying  the fattening beast to an advanced point, by which not only the quality  of carcass is improved, but the quantity is relatively greater for the  amount of food consumed. These views are intimately connected, and fully  correspond, with the principles of      RESPIRATION IN ANIMALS.    From careful experiments, it has been found that all animals daily  consume a much larger quantity of food than the aggregate of what may  have been retained in the system, added to what has been expelled in the  f[oe]ces and urine, and what has escaped by perspiration. Boussingault,  who combines the characteristics of an ingenious chemist, a vigilant  observer, and a practical agriculturist, made an experiment with a  \"milch-cow and a full-grown horse, which were placed in stalls so  contrived that the droppings and the urine could be collected without  loss. Before being made the subjects of experiment, the animals were  ballasted or fed for a month with the same ration that was furnished to  them, during the three days and three nights which they passed in the  experimental stalls. During the month, the weight of the animals did not  vary sensibly, a circumstance which happily enables us to assume that  neither did the weight vary during the seventy-two hours when they were  under especial observation.    The cow was foddered with after-math, hay, and potatoes; the horse with  the same hay and oats. The quantities of forage were accurately weighed,  and their precise degree of moistness and their composition were  determined from average samples. The water drunk was measured, its  saline and earthy constituents having been previously ascertained. The  excrementitious matters passed, were of course collected with the  greatest care; the excrements, the urine, and the milk were weighed, and  the constitution of the whole estimated from elementary analyses of  average specimens of each. The results of the two experiments are given  in the table on the next page.    The oxygen and hydrogen that are not accounted for in the sum of the  products have not disappeared in the precise proportions requisite to  form water; the excess of hydrogen amounts to as many as from 13 to 15  dwts. It is probable that this hydrogen of the food became changed into  water by combining during respiration with the oxygen of the air.\"      FOOD CONSUMED BY THE HORSE IN 24 HOURS.
