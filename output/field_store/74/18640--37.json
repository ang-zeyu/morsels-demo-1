Herodotus indeed puts both  poets 400 years before his own time; that is, at about 830-820 B.C., and  the evidence stated above points to the middle of the ninth century  as the probable date for the \"Works and Days\". The \"Theogony\" might be  tentatively placed a century later; and the \"Catalogues\" and \"Eoiae\" are  again later, but not greatly later, than the \"Theogony\": the \"Shield of  Heracles\" may be ascribed to the later half of the seventh century, but  there is not evidence enough to show whether the other 'developed' poems  are to be regarded as of a date so low as this.          Literary Value of Homer    Quintillian's [1111] judgment on Hesiod that 'he rarely rises to great  heights... and to him is given the palm in the middle-class of speech'  is just, but is liable to give a wrong impression. Hesiod has nothing  that remotely approaches such scenes as that between Priam and Achilles,  or the pathos of Andromache's preparations for Hector's return, even as  he was falling before the walls of Troy; but in matters that come  within the range of ordinary experience, he rarely fails to rise to the  appropriate level. Take, for instance, the description of the Iron  Age (\"Works and Days\", 182 ff.) with its catalogue of wrongdoings and  violence ever increasing until Aidos and Nemesis are forced to leave  mankind who thenceforward shall have 'no remedy against evil'. Such  occasions, however, rarely occur and are perhaps not characteristic of  Hesiod's genius: if we would see Hesiod at his best, in his most natural  vein, we must turn to such a passage as that which he himself--according  to the compiler of the \"Contest of Hesiod and Homer\"--selected as best  in all his work, 'When the Pleiades, Atlas' daughters, begin to rise...'  (\"Works and Days,\" 383 ff.). The value of such a passage cannot be  analysed: it can only be said that given such a subject, this alone is  the right method of treatment.    Hesiod's diction is in the main Homeric, but one of his charms is the  use of quaint allusive phrases derived, perhaps, from a pre-Hesiodic  peasant poetry: thus the season when Boreas blows is the time when 'the  Boneless One gnaws his foot by his fireless hearth in his cheerless  house'; to cut one's nails is 'to sever the withered from the quick  upon that which has five branches'; similarly the burglar is the  'day-sleeper', and the serpent is the 'hairless one'. Very similar is  his reference to seasons through what happens or is done in that season:  'when the House-carrier, fleeing the Pleiades, climbs up the plants from  the earth', is the season for harvesting; or 'when the artichoke flowers  and the clicking grass-hopper, seated in a tree, pours down his shrill  song', is the time for rest.    Hesiod's charm lies in his child-like and sincere naivete, in his  unaffected interest in and picturesque view of nature and all that  happens in nature. These qualities, it is true, are those pre-eminently  of the \"Works and Days\": the literary values of the \"Theogony\" are of a  more technical character, skill in ordering and disposing long lists of  names, sure judgment in seasoning a monotonous subject with marvellous  incidents or episodes, and no mean imagination in depicting the awful,  as is shown in the description of Tartarus (ll. 736-745). Yet it remains  true that Hesiod's distinctive title to a high place in Greek literature  lies in the very fact of his freedom from classic form, and his grave,  and yet child-like, outlook upon his world.          The Ionic School    The Ionic School of Epic poetry was, as we have seen, dominated by  the Homeric tradition, and while the style and method of treatment are  Homeric, it is natural that the Ionic poets refrained from cultivating  the ground tilled by Homer, and chose for treatment legends which lay  beyond the range of the \"Iliad\" and \"Odyssey\". Equally natural it is  that they should have particularly selected various phases of the  tale of Troy which preceded or followed the action of the \"Iliad\" or  \"Odyssey\". In this way, without any preconceived intention, a body of  epic poetry was built up by various writers which covered the whole  Trojan story. But the entire range of heroic legend was open to these  poets, and other clusters of epics grew up dealing particularly with the  famous story of Thebes, while others dealt with the beginnings of the  world and the wars of heaven. In the end there existed a kind of epic  history of the world, as known to the Greeks, down to the death of  Odysseus, when the heroic age ended. In the Alexandrian Age these  poems were arranged in chronological order, apparently by Zenodotus of  Ephesus, at the beginning of the 3rd century B.C. At a later time the  term \"Cycle\", 'round' or 'course', was given to this collection.    Of all this mass of epic poetry only the scantiest fragments survive;  but happily Photius has preserved to us an abridgment of the synopsis  made of each poem of the \"Trojan Cycle\" by Proclus, i.e. Eutychius  Proclus of Sicca.    The pre-Trojan poems of the Cycle may be noticed first. The  \"Titanomachy\", ascribed both to Eumelus of Corinth and to Arctinus of  Miletus, began with a kind of Theogony which told of the union of Heaven  and Earth and of their offspring the Cyclopes and the Hundred-handed  Giants. How the poem proceeded we have no means of knowing, but we may  suppose that in character it was not unlike the short account of the  Titan War found in the Hesiodic \"Theogony\" (617 ff.).    What links bound the \"Titanomachy\" to the Theben Cycle is not clear.  This latter group was formed of three poems, the \"Story of Oedipus\", the  \"Thebais\", and the \"Epigoni\". Of the \"Oedipodea\" practically nothing is  known, though on the assurance of Athenaeus (vii. 277 E) that Sophocles  followed the Epic Cycle closely in the plots of his plays, we may  suppose that in outline the story corresponded closely to the history of  Oedipus as it is found in the \"Oedipus Tyrannus\". The \"Thebais\" seems  to have begun with the origin of the fatal quarrel between Eteocles and  Polyneices in the curse called down upon them by their father in his  misery. The story was thence carried down to the end of the expedition  under Polyneices, Adrastus and Amphiarus against Thebes. The \"Epigoni\"  (ascribed to Antimachus of Teos) recounted the expedition of the  'After-Born' against Thebes, and the sack of the city.          The Trojan Cycle    Six epics with the \"Iliad\" and the \"Odyssey\" made up the Trojan  Cycle--The \"Cyprian Lays\", the \"Iliad\", the \"Aethiopis\", the \"Little  Iliad\", the \"Sack of Troy\", the \"Returns\", the \"Odyssey\", and the  \"Telegony\".    It has been assumed in the foregoing pages that the poems of the Trojan  Cycle are later than the Homeric poems; but, as the opposite view  has been held, the reasons for this assumption must now be given. 1)  Tradition puts Homer and the Homeric poems proper back in the ages  before chronological history began, and at the same time assigns the  purely Cyclic poems to definite authors who are dated from the  first Olympiad (776 B.C.) downwards. This tradition cannot be purely  arbitrary. 2) The Cyclic poets (as we can see from the abstract of  Proclus) were careful not to trespass upon ground already occupied by  Homer. Thus, when we find that in the \"Returns\" all the prominent Greek  heroes except Odysseus are accounted for, we are forced to believe that  the author of this poem knew the \"Odyssey\" and judged it unnecessary to  deal in full with that hero's adventures. [1112] In a word, the Cyclic  poems are 'written round' the \"Iliad\" and the \"Odyssey\". 3) The general  structure of these epics is clearly imitative. As M.M. Croiset remark,  the abusive Thersites in the \"Aethiopis\" is clearly copied from the  Thersites of the \"Iliad\"; in the same poem Antilochus, slain by Memnon  and avenged by Achilles, is obviously modelled on Patroclus. 4) The  geographical knowledge of a poem like the \"Returns\" is far wider and  more precise than that of the \"Odyssey\". 5) Moreover, in the Cyclic  poems epic is clearly degenerating morally--if the expression may be  used. The chief greatness of the \"Iliad\" is in the character of the  heroes Achilles and Hector rather than in the actual events which take  place: in the Cyclic writers facts rather than character are the objects  of interest, and events are so packed together as to leave no space for  any exhibition of the play of moral forces. All these reasons justify  the view that the poems with which we now have to deal were later than  the \"Iliad\" and \"Odyssey\", and if we must recognize the possibility of  some conventionality in the received dating, we may feel confident that  it is at least approximately just.    The earliest of the post-Homeric epics of Troy are apparently the  \"Aethiopis\" and the \"Sack of Ilium\", both ascribed to Arctinus of  Miletus who is said to have flourished in the first Olympiad (776 B.C.).  He set himself to finish the tale of Troy, which, so far as events were  concerned, had been left half-told by Homer, by tracing the course of  events after the close of the \"Iliad\". The \"Aethiopis\" thus included the  coming of the Amazon Penthesilea to help the Trojans after the fall of  Hector and her death, the similar arrival and fall of the Aethiopian  Memnon, the death of Achilles under the arrow of Paris, and the dispute  between Odysseus and Aias for the arms of Achilles. The \"Sack of Ilium\"  [1113] as analysed by Proclus was very similar to Vergil's version in  \"Aeneid\" ii, comprising the episodes of the wooden horse, of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34804"],[0,"Lectures on the Origin and Growth of Religion as Illustrated (#4)"],[1,"with the  broad ogives that recal the Moorish architecture of the Alhambra; while  at Tehuantepec an immense temple has been discovered, hollowed out of a  huge rock, like certain temples in India. The cultivation of maize was  to this region what that of wheat was to Egypt and Mesopotamia, or of  rice to India and China, the material condition, namely, of a precocious  civilization. For, as has been remarked, the primitive civilizations  could not be developed except where an abundant cereal raised man above  immediate anxiety for his subsistence, and rescued him from the  all-engrossing fatigues and the dangerous uncertainties of the hunter's  life.    This Maya race, having adopted the agricultural and sedentary life,  multiplied so greatly as to send out many swarms of colonists towards  the North, where the _Nahuas_, that is to say, \"the skilled ones\" or  \"experts\" (for so the emigrants from the Maya land were called), found  men of the same race as themselves, to whom they imparted their superior  knowledge. They kept on pushing northwards, established themselves on  the great plateau of Anahuac, or \"lake country,\" where the city of  Mexico is situated, and advanced up to the somewhat indefinite limit  opposed to their progress by the Red-skins. This migratory movement  towards the North was evidently not the affair of a day. It must have  continued for centuries; and during its process the Maya civilization  may have experienced great developments and undergone numerous  modifications; so that, without venturing to pronounce categorically  upon a problem yet unsolved, I should myself be inclined to ascribe to  a population, which either consisted of bands of emigrant Mayas or was  affected by this Nahua movement, those \"Mounds\" which still throw their  galling defiance at the modern methods of research, powerless to explain  their origin in regions which have since been under the reign of the  most absolute savagery.    However this may be, the movement by which in a remote antiquity the  peoples of Central America ascended towards the North, carrying with  them their relative civilization to Mexico and even beyond, was reversed  at the epoch of our Middle Ages by a migration in the opposite  direction. In this case it was the peoples of the northern regions that  tended to beat back upon the South. They invaded, conquered and brought  into subjection the peoples who had established themselves along the  path followed by the previous migrations; and it is probably to  invasions of this description that we must ascribe the fall of the  ancient Maya society of the isthmic region. But the civilization of  which it had sown the germs was not dead. Nay, the peoples who descended  upon the South had in great measure themselves adopted it; and in the  invaded districts there remained groups and nuclei of Nahua populations  who maintained its principles, its arts and its spirit, to which their  conquerors readily conformed. The last conquerors had been established  as masters in the Mexican district for more than a century when the  Spaniards arrived there. They were the _Aztecs_. They had conquered or  shattered what was called the _Chichimec_ empire, which in its turn had  destroyed, some centuries earlier, the _Toltec_ empire. But it would be  a mistake to think of three successive empires, Toltec, Chichimec and  Aztec, one supplanting the other in the same way as the Frankish empire,  for example, took the place of that of Rome, which in its turn had  replaced divers others more ancient yet. What really took place was what  follows.    The prolonged migrations of the Nahuas towards the North had not spread  civilization uniformly amongst all the tribes encountered on the route.  Thus, down to the sixteenth century, there still existed in the heart of  Mexico tribes very little removed from the savage state, such as the  Otomis or \"wanderers;\" whereas, in other districts, the Nahuas had  established themselves on a footing of acknowledged supremacy and  developed a brilliant civilization. Thus they founded at the extreme  north of the present Mexico the ancient city of Tulan or Tullan, the  name of which passed into that of its inhabitants, the _Toltecs_, and  this latter, in its turn, became the designation of everything graceful,  elegant, artistically refined and beautiful. Ethnographically, it simply  indicates the most brilliant foci of the civilization imported from  Central America. In fact, there never was a Toltec empire at all, but  simply a confederation of the three cities of Tullan, Colhuacan and  Otompan, all of which may be regarded as Toltec in the social sense  which I have just described. Many other small states existed outside  this confederation. It was destroyed by the revolt or invasion of more  northern tribes, hitherto held in vassalage and looked down upon as  belonging to a lower level of culture and manners. These tribes received  or assumed the name of _Chichimecs_ or \"dogs,\" which may have been a  term of contempt converted into a title of honour, like that of the  _Gueux_ of the Low Countries. Thus arose a Chichimec confederation, of  which Colhuacan (the name given for a time to Tezcuco), Azcapulzalco,  the capital of the Tepanecs, and Tlacopan, were the principal cities. At  Tezcuco the Toltec element was still powerful. Cholula, a sacred city,  remained essentially Toltec, and in general the Chichimecs readily  adopted the superior civilization of the Toltecs. This was so much the  case that Tezcuco became the seat of an intellectual and artistic  development, in virtue of which the Europeans called it the Athens of  Mexico. It was from the eleventh to the fourteenth centuries, according  to the historians, that what may be called the Chichimec era lasted.    At the beginning of the fifteenth century, the Aztecs--that is to say  _the white flamingos_ or _herons_ (from _aztatl_), the last comers from  the North, who had long been a poor and wretched tribe, and on reaching  Anahuac had been obliged to accept the suzerainty of Tezcuco--began to  assume great importance. They had founded, under the name of  Tenochtitlan, upon an island that is now united to the mainland, the  city which was afterwards called Mexico. But originally the name of  Mexico belonged to the quarter of the city which was dedicated to the  god of war, Mextli. At once warlike and commercial, the Aztecs grew in  numbers, wealth and military power; they saved Tezcuco from the dominion  of the Tepanecs, who tried to bring the whole Chichimec confederation  into subjection; presently they threw off all vassalage, and in the  fifteenth century they stood at the head of the new confederation which  took the place of that of the Chichimecs, and of which Mexico, Tezcuco  and Tlacopan (or Tacuba), were the three capitals.    There was no Mexican empire, then, at the moment when Fernando Cortes  disembarked near Vera Cruz, but there was a federation. On certain days  of religious festivity a solemn public dance was celebrated in Mexico,  in which the sovereign families of the three states, together with their  subjects of the highest rank, took part. It began at noon before the  palace of the Mexican king. They stood three and three. The king of  Mexico led the dance, holding with his right hand the king of Tezcuco,  and with his left the king of Tlacopan, and the three confederate  sovereigns or emperors thus symbolized for several hours the union of  their three states by the harmonious cadence of their movements.[4]      III.    The widely-spread error that makes Montezuma, the Mexican sovereign that  received Fernando Cortes, the absolute master of the whole district of  the present Mexico, is explained by the fact, that of the three  confederate states that of the Aztecs was by far the strongest, most  warlike and most dreaded. It was constantly extending its dominion by  means of a numerous, disciplined and admirably organized army, and  little by little the other two states were constantly approaching the  condition of vassalage. The Aztecs were no more recalcitrant to  civilization than the Chichimecs, but they were ruder, more  matter-of-fact and more cruel. They did no sacrifices to the Toltec  graces, but developed their civilization exclusively on its utilitarian  and practical side. They were no artists, but essentially warriors and  merchants. And even their merchants were often at the same time spies  whom the kings of Mexico sent into the countries they coveted, to study  their resources, their strength and their weakness. Their yoke was hard.  They raised heavy tributes. Their policy was one of extreme  centralization, and, without destroying the religion of the peoples  conquered by their arms, they imposed upon them the worship and the  supremacy of their own national deities. Their warlike expeditions bore  a pronounced religious character. The priests marched at the head of the  soldiers, and bore Aztec idols on their backs. On the eve of a battle  they kindled fresh fire by the friction of wood; and it was they who  gave the signal of attack. These wars had pillage and conquest as their  object, but also and very specially the capture of victims to sacrifice  to the Aztec gods. For the Aztecs pushed the superstitious practice of  human sacrifice to absolute frenzy. It was to these horrible sacrifices  that they attributed their successes in war and the prosperity of their  empire. If they experienced a check or had suffered any disaster, they  redoubled their blood-stained offerings. But note this trait, so  essentially pagan and in such perfect accord with the polytheistic ideas  of the ancient world--they sacrificed to the gods of the conquered  country too, to show them that it was not against them they were  contending, and that the new regime would not rob them of the homage to  which they were accustomed. The Aztec deities were not _jealous_. They  confined themselves to vindicating"]]]
