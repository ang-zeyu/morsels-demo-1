Until we are thus divinely qualified and are  10:9    willing to drink his cup, millions of vain repetitions          will never pour into prayer the unction of Spirit in          demonstration of power and \"with signs following.\"  10:12   Christian Science reveals a necessity for overcoming the          world, the flesh, and evil, and thus destroying all error.            Seeking is not sufficient. It is striving that enables  10:15   us to enter. Spiritual attainments open the door to a          higher understanding of the divine Life.                               Perfunctory prayers            One of the forms of worship in Thibet is to carry a  10:18   praying-machine through the streets, and stop at the          doors to earn a penny by grinding out a          prayer. But the advance guard of progress has  10:21   paid for the privilege of prayer the price of persecution.                                  Asking amiss            Experience teaches us that we do not always receive          the blessings we ask for in prayer. There is some mis-  10:24   apprehension of the source and means of          all goodness and blessedness, or we should          certainly receive that for which we ask. The Scrip-  10:27   tures say: \"Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask          amiss, that ye may consume it upon your lusts.\" That          which we desire and for which we ask, it is not always  10:30   best for us to receive. In this case infinite Love will          not grant the request. Do you ask wisdom to be mer-          ciful and not to punish sin? Then \"ye ask amiss.\"  11:1    Without punishment, sin would multiply. Jesus' prayer,          \"Forgive us our debts,\" specified also the terms of  11:3    forgiveness. When forgiving the adulterous woman he          said, \"Go, and sin no more.\"                              Remission of penalty            A magistrate sometimes remits the penalty, but this  11:6    may be no moral benefit to the criminal, and at best, it          only saves the criminal from one form of          punishment. The moral law, which has the  11:9    right to acquit or condemn, always demands restitu-          tion before mortals can \"go up higher.\" Broken law          brings penalty in order to compel this progress.                             Truth annihilates error    11:12   Mere legal pardon (and there is no other, for divine          Principle never pardons our sins or mistakes till they          are corrected) leaves the offender free to re-  11:15   peat the offence, if indeed, he has not already          suffered sufficiently from vice to make him turn from it          with loathing. Truth bestows no pardon upon error, but  11:18   wipes it out in the most effectual manner. Jesus suffered          for our sins, not to annul the divine sentence for an in-          dividual's sin, but because sin brings inevitable suffering.                               Desire for holiness    11:21   Petitions bring to mortals only the results of mor-          tals' own faith. We know that a desire for holiness is          requisite in order to gain holiness; but if we  11:24   desire holiness above all else, we shall sac-          rifice everything for it. We must be willing to do this,          that we may walk securely in the only practical road  11:27   to holiness. Prayer cannot change the unalterable          Truth, nor can prayer alone give us an understanding          of Truth; but prayer, coupled with a fervent habitual  11:30   desire to know and do the will of God, will bring us          into all Truth. Such a desire has little need of audible          expression. It is best expressed in thought and in life.                               Prayer for the sick    12:1    \"The prayer of faith shall save the sick,\" says the          Scripture. What is this healing prayer? A mere re-  12:3    quest that God will heal the sick has no          power to gain more of the divine presence          than is always at hand. The beneficial effect of  12:6    such prayer for the sick is on the human mind, mak-          ing it act more powerfully on the body through a blind          faith in God. This, however, is one belief casting out  12:9    another, - a belief in the unknown casting out a belief          in sickness. It is neither Science nor Truth which          acts through blind belief, nor is it the human under-  12:12   standing of the divine healing Principle as manifested          in Jesus, whose humble prayers were deep and con-          scientious protests of Truth, - of man's likeness to  12:15   God and of man's unity with Truth and Love.            Prayer to a corporeal God affects the sick like a          drug, which has no efficacy of its own but borrows its  12:18   power from human faith and belief. The drug does          nothing, because it has no intelligence. It is a mortal          belief, not divine Principle or Love, which causes a  12:21   drug to be apparently either poisonous or sanative.            The common custom of praying for the recovery of the          sick finds help in blind belief, whereas help should come  12:24   from the enlightened understanding. Changes in belief          may go on indefinitely, but they are the merchandise of          human thought and not the outgrowth of divine Science.                          Love impartial and universal    12:27   Does Deity interpose in behalf of one worshipper,          and not help another who offers the same measure of          prayer? If the sick recover because they  12:30   pray or are prayed for audibly, only peti-          tioners (/per se/ or by proxy) should get well. In divine          Science, where prayers are mental, /all/ may avail them-  13:1    selves of God as \"a very present help in trouble.\"          Love is impartial and universal in its adaptation and  13:3    bestowals. It is the open fount which cries, \"Ho,          every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters.\"                              Public exaggerations            In public prayer we often go beyond our convictions,  13:6    beyond the honest standpoint of fervent desire. If we          are not secretly yearning and openly striv-          ing for the accomplishment of all we ask,  13:9    our prayers are \"vain repetitions,\" such as the heathen          use. If our petitions are sincere, we labor for what we          ask; and our Father, who seeth in secret, will reward  13:12   us openly. Can the mere public expression of our de-          sires increase them? Do we gain the omnipotent ear          sooner by words than by thoughts? Even if prayer is  13:15   sincere, God knows our need before we tell Him or our          fellow-beings about it. If we cherish the desire hon-          estly and silently and humbly, God will bless it, and  13:18   we shall incur less risk of overwhelming our real          wishes with a torrent of words.                               Corporeal ignorance            If we pray to God as a corporeal person, this will  13:21   prevent us from relinquishing the human doubts and          fears which attend such a belief, and so we          cannot grasp the wonders wrought by infi-  13:24   nite, incorporeal Love, to whom all things are possible.          Because of human ignorance of the divine Principle,          Love, the Father of all is represented as a corporeal  13:27   creator; hence men recognize themselves as merely          physical, and are ignorant of man as God's image or re-          flection and of man's eternal incorporeal existence. The  13:30   world of error is ignorant of the world of Truth, - blind          to the reality of man's existence, - for the world of sen-          sation is not cognizant of life in Soul, not in body.                                 Bodily presence    14:1    If we are sensibly with the body and regard omnipo-          tence as a corporeal, material person, whose ear we  14:3    would gain, we are not \"absent from the          body\" and \"present with the Lord\" in the          demonstration of Spirit. We cannot \"serve two mas-  14:6    ters.\" To be \"present with the Lord\" is to have, not          mere emotional ecstasy or faith, but the actual demon-          stration and understanding of Life as revealed in  14:9    Christian Science. To be \"with the Lord\" is to be in          obedience to the law of God, to be absolutely governed          by divine Love,- by Spirit, not by matter.                           Spiritualized consciousness    14:12   Become conscious for a single moment that Life and          intelligence are purely spiritual, - neither in nor of          matter, - and the body will then utter no  14:15   complaints. If suffering from a belief in          sickness, you will find yourself suddenly well. Sorrow          is turned into joy when the body is controlled by spir-  14:18   itual Life, Truth, and Love. Hence the hope of the          promise Jesus bestows: \"He that believeth on me,          the works that I do shall he do also; . . . because I  14:21   go unto my Father,\" - [because the Ego is absent from          the body, and present with Truth and Love.] The          Lord's Prayer is the prayer of Soul, not of material  14:24   sense.            Entirely separate from the belief and dream of mate-          rial living, is the Life divine, revealing spiritual under-  14:27   standing and the consciousness of man's dominion          over the whole earth. This understanding casts out          error and heals the sick, and with it you can speak  14:30   \"as one having authority.\"            \"When thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and,          when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father  15:1    which is in secret; and thy Father, which seeth in          secret, shall reward thee openly.\"                               Spiritual sanctuary    15:3    So spake Jesus. The closet typifies the sanctuary"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34585"],[0,"The History of Painting in Italy, Vol. 2 (of 6) (#4)"],[1," shall here only add, that he  had for a pupil Pietro Alamanni, the chief of the painters of Ascoli, a  respectable _quattrocentista_, who painted an altarpiece at S. Maria  della Carita, in 1489. About this time also we find amongst their names  a Vittorio Crivelli, a Venetian, of the family, as I conjecture, and  perhaps of the school of Carlo. There is frequent mention of him in the  _Antichita Picene_.    Urbino, too, had her artists, as her princes were not behind the other  rulers of Italy in good taste. At the restoration of the art, we find  Giotto, and several of his scholars, there; and afterwards Gentile da  Fabriano,[12] a Galeazzo, and, possibly, a Gentile di Urbino. At Pesaro,  in the convent of S. Agostino, I have seen a Madonna, accompanied with  beautiful architecture, and an inscription--_Bartholomaeus Magistri  Gentilis de Urbino_, 1497; and at Monte Cicardo, I saw the same name on  an ancient picture of 1508, but without his birthplace. (Ant. Pic. tom.  xvii. 145.) I am in doubt whether this _M. Gentilis_ refers to the  father of Bartolommeo or his master, as the scholars at that time often  took their designation from their masters. At all events, this artist is  not to be confounded with Bartolommeo from Ferrara, whose son,  Benedetto, subscribes himself _Benedictus quondam Bartholomaei de Fer.  Pictor._ 1492. This is to be seen in the church of S. Domenico di  Urbino, on the altarpiece in the Chapel of the Muccioli, their  descendants.    In the city of Urbino there remain some works of the father of  Raffaello, who, in a letter of the Duchess Giovanna della Rovere, which  is the first of the Lettere Pittoriche, is designated as _molto  virtuoso_. There is by him in the church of S. Francis, a good picture  of S. Sebastian, with figures in an attitude of supplication. There is  one attributed also to him in a small church dedicated to the same  saint, representing his martyrdom, with a figure foreshortened, which  Raffaello, when young, imitated in a picture of the Virgin, at Citta di  Castello. He subscribed himself _Io. Sanctis Urbi._ (_Urbinas_). So I  read it in the sacristy of the Conventuals of Sinigaglia in an  Annunciation in which there is a beautiful angel, and an infant Christ  descending from the father; and which seems to be copied from those of  Pietro Perugino, with whom Raffaello worked some time, though it has a  still more ancient style. The other figures are less beautiful, but yet  graceful, and the extremities are carefully executed. But the most  distinguished painter in Urbino was F. Bartolommeo Corradini d'Urbino, a  Domenican, called Fra. Carnevale. To an accurate eye his pictures are  defective in perspective, and retain in the drapery the dryness of his  age, but the portraits are so strongly expressed that they seem to live  and speak; the architecture is beautiful, and the colours bright, and  the air of the heads at the same time noble and unaffected. It is known  that Bramante and Raffaello studied him, as there were not, at that  time, any better works in Urbino. In Gubbio, which formed a part of this  dukedom, were to be seen in that age the remains of the early school.  There exists a fresco by Ottaviano Martis in S. Maria Nuova, painted in  1403. The Virgin is surrounded by a choir of angels, certainly too much  resembling each other, but in their forms and attitudes as graceful and  pleasing as any contemporary productions.    Borgo S. Sepolcro, Foligno, and Perugia, present us with artists of  greater celebrity. Borgo was a part of Umbria subject to the Holy See,  and was, in 1440, pledged to the Florentines,[13] by Eugenius IV. at the  time Piero della Francesca, or Piero Borghese, one of the most memorable  painters of this age, was at the summit of his reputation. He must have  been born about 1398, since Vasari states that \"he painted about the  year 1458,\"[14] and that he became blind at sixty years of age, and  remained so until his death, in his eighty-sixth year. From his  fifteenth year he applied himself to painting, at which age he had made  himself master of the principles of mathematics, and he rose to great  eminence both in art and science.[15] I have not been able to ascertain  who was his master, but it is probable that as he was the son of a poor  widow, who had barely the means of bringing him up, he did not leave his  native place; and that under the guidance of obscure masters he raised  himself, by his own genius, to the high degree of fame which he enjoyed.  He first appeared, says Vasari, in the court of the elder Guidubaldo  Feltro, Duke of Urbino, where he left only some pictures of figures on a  small scale, which was the case with such as were not the pupils of the  great masters. He was celebrated for a remarkable drawing of a Vase, so  ingeniously designed that the front, the back, the sides, the bottom,  and the mouth, were all shewn; the whole drawn with the greatest  correctness, and the circles gracefully foreshortened. The art of  perspective, the principles of which he was, as some affirm, the first  among the Italians to develope and to cultivate, was much indebted to  him;[16] and painting, too, owed much to his example in imitating the  effects of light, in marking correctly the muscles of the naked figure,  in preparing models of clay for his figures, and in the study of his  drapery, the folds of which he fixed on the model itself, and drew very  accurately and minutely. On examining the style of Bramante and his  Milanese contemporaries, I have often thought that they derived some  light from Piero, for, as I have before said, he painted in Urbino where  Bramante studied, and afterwards executed many works in Rome, where  Bramantino came and was employed by Nicholas V.    In the Floreria of the Vatican is still to be seen a large fresco  painting, in which the above named pontiff is represented with cardinals  and prelates, and there is a degree of truth in the countenances highly  interesting. Taja does not assert that it is by Pietro, but says that it  is attributed to him.[17] Those which are pointed out in Arezzo  doubtless belong to him, and the most remarkable are the histories of  the holy cross in the choir of the church of the Conventuals, which shew  that the art was already advanced beyond its infancy; there is so much  new in the Giotto manner of foreshortening, in the relief, and in many  difficulties of the art overcome in his works. If he had possessed the  grace of Masaccio he might with justice have been placed at his side. At  Citta S. Sepolcro there still remain some works attributed to him; a S.  Lodovico Vescovo, in the public palace, at S. Chiara a picture of the  Assumption, with the apostles in the distance, and a choir of angels at  the top, but in the foreground are S. Francis, S. Jerome, and other  figures, which injure the unity of the composition. There are, however,  still traces in them of the old style; a poverty of design, a hardness  in the foldings of the drapery, feet which are well foreshortened, but  too far apart. As to the rest, in design, in the air, and in the  colouring of the figures, it seems to be a rude sketch of that style  which was ameliorated by P. Perugino, and perfected by Raffaello.    In the latter part of this century there flourished several good  painters at Foligno, but it is not known from whom they derived their  instructions. In the twenty-fifth volume of the Antichita Picene we  read, that in the church of S. Francesco di Cagli there exists (I know  not whether it be now there) a most beautiful composition, painted in  1461, at the price of 115 ducats of gold, by M. Pietro di Mazzaforte and  M. Niccolo Deliberatore of Foligno. At S. Venanzio di Camerino is a  large altarpiece on a ground of gold, with Christ on the Cross,  surrounded by many Saints, with three small evangelical histories added  to it. The inscription is _Opus Nicolai Fulginatis_, 1480; it is in the  style of the last imitators of Giotto, and there is scarcely a doubt  that the artist studied at Florence. I believe him to be the same artist  as Niccolo Deliberatore, or di Liberatore; and different from Niccolo  Alunno, also of Foligno, whom Vasari mentions as an excellent painter in  the time of Pinturicchio. He painted in distemper, as was common before  Pietro Perugino, but in tints that have survived uninjured to our own  times. In the distribution of his colours he was original; his heads  possess expression, though they are common, and sometimes heavy, when  they represent the vulgar. There is at S. Niccolo di Foligno a picture  by him, composed in the style of the fourteenth century, the Virgin  surrounded by saints, and underneath small histories of the Passion,  where the perspicuity is more to be praised than the disposition. In the  same style some of his pieces in Foligno are painted after 1500. Vasari  thinks they are all surpassed by his Pieta in a chapel of the Duomo, in  which are represented two angels, \"whose grief is so vividly expressed,  that any other artist, however ambitious he might be, would find it  difficult to surpass it.\"    Perugia, from whence the art derived no common lustre, abounded in  painters beyond any other city. The celebrated Mariotti formed a long  catalogue of the painters of the fourteenth century, and among the most  conspicuous are Fiorenzo di Lorenzo, and Bartolommeo Caporali, of whom  we have pictures of the date of 1487. Some strangers were also to be  found amongst them, as that Lello da Velletri, the author of an  altarpiece, and its lower compartments, noticed by Signor Orsini.  Benedetto Bonfigli was distinguished above all others, and was the most  eminent artist of Perugia in his day. I have seen by him, besides the  picture in fresco in the Palazzo Publico, mentioned by Vasari, a picture  of the Magi, in S. Domenico, in a style similar to Gentile, and with a  large proportion of gold; and another in a more modern style, an"]]]
