[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34093"],[0,"Mink Trapping: A Book of Instruction Giving Many Methods of Trapping (#4)"],[1,"as some seem  to think, and I find that one of the most important things is to find  where animals use and set your traps near these places. Of course you  must study the nature and habits of your game or you will not know  how to set the trap after you find the place. Then set your traps  carefully, work hard, keep your eyes open, use reason and good sense,  take care of your furs and you will be successful.    For mink I use a No. 1 or No. 1 1/2 trap. The latter is preferable.  For scent that obtained from the scent bags of the mink or weasel,  mixed with anise oil, is the best decoy I ever used, says a Minnesota  trapper. This scent is found near the root of the tail in two round  bags about the size of a pea, and is a yellow liquid smelling very  strong.    After setting the trap I scatter feathers around and over it. The  mink, seeing the feathers and scenting what he supposes to be a  weasel, will dig up the whole works looking for something a weasel  has overlooked, and he is mighty lucky if he don't get in the trap.  Canned sardines make good mink bait, and the sardine oil is good to  mix with the scent in the scent bottle. Skunk scent and feathers  attract and allay suspicions of all bird eating animals.        CHAPTER VI.    PLACES TO SET.    There is one place on my line of traps where I have caught six mink,  says an Iowa trapper. I have no doubt but what this particular place  is on their regular crossing place in going from one stream to  another. I have a few good places but they do not equal this one. At  these particular places I do not remove my traps during the entire  trapping season. I find a man gets fooled quite easy at times by  putting in traps at places that look extra good, when, in fact, it  proves to be no good at all for mink. I often read of trappers who  say to set traps at hollow trees, in hollow logs, and every place  where a mink is liable to go. Well, a mink is liable to go any place.  Also just as liable not to go, too. Now if you should place a trap in  all these places you would have traps strung all over creation.    In my locality after a mink leaves a ditch or stream you cannot tell  what direction he will go. Perhaps he will start across some farmer's  field down between two rows of corn. Now I expect some of these  nights Mr. Mink is going to take a run down through Farmer Jones'  cornfield. He is liable to. Shall I place a trap between every row of  corn? In my locality with snow on the ground they travel through  fields more than any other place. I will tell you boys, I have three  pet sets that I use, and which I stay just as close to the streams  with as I possibly can, for the condition of the weather is such at  most times that it would not pay to change the location of traps.    Some trappers will tell you that if a mink will throw his scent where  he is caught you will get another one soon at the same place. Well I  do not believe it, except from the female at mating time. I think  when an animal throws a scent it is a danger signal.    Many trappers have told me that a warm night was the night to catch  mink, because that was the time they ran most. That don't go with me  either. It is just because mink can smell bait better on a warm  night, as the old trappers around here hardly ever set without bait,  and think it is a wonder that I can catch mink without bait. In fact,  mink run well on cold and disagreeable nights, just as well as on  warm nights. I make it a point to have my traps in the very best  condition previous to a change in the weather, no matter what the  change may bring, there will be lots of mink on the move during the  change.    Now boys I am not going to advise you to make any particular set, but  if you have two or three good ways, stay with them. They will bring  good results. A man can spend lots of time trying to do something  with some fake set and perhaps neglect some better sets during this  time. A few good sets, well handled, will surely bring good results.    If I am to judge results from the conditions in my locality, I will  say that fifty traps are too many. Twenty-five gives a man plenty of  work here. During snowy weather you can set your traps with northeast  east, or southeast protection and it is all right, until the wind  gets to the northwest, then look out, for you will have some digging  to yet your traps in good condition. By that time the wind is in the  south. Then it begins to thaw, then the water soaks through on your  traps, then by the time you get around again they are frozen up  solid. Then how a fellow wishes for more weather with a \"sameness\"  about it.    An Eastern trapper says: My favorite set for mink is the water set. I  find a place where the water don't freeze up, and if there are any  stones around I lay a stone on each side of the stream, and then I  get a flat stone and lay it over the two stones. I place these  alongside the stream, making a hole like when the water comes out.  Then for a bait I use fish, brook trout if I can get them, or most  any kind of fresh water fish. I put a piece of fish back in this hole  so it lies in the water and set traps in entrance, and you are sure  to get most every mink that comes along.      [Illustration: A GOOD MINK STREAM.]    This set is for November, December, January and February until about  the last part, when running time begins. Then I like the runways  best, and you will find them under driftwood and along banks where  the water has washed the bank so the trees standing on the edge have  leaned over and made a hollow under the bank. I have taken a good  many mink this way and also with the water set. I took twelve mink  last year that I kept, and had six get away by gnawing off their feet  under the jaws of the trap.    The following is from an Indiana trapper: Here is one of the many  mink sets I have been successful with: Go along a creek, find a log,  one that is somewhat crooked will be better, as some part of it will  sink below the surface of the water, roll same into the creek and tow  along to a place where the water is two to three feet deep, take a  strong wire 6 or 7 feet long and fasten to the under side and to one  end of the log, fasten the other end of the wire to a stout stake and  drive down solid near the middle of the creek.    Now find a place where the water stands above the top of the log, and  chop out a place for the trap deep enough so the trap will be 1 or 2  inches under water. Now take some mud and smear over the fresh cut  place so it will have an old appearance. Now set your trap and cover  with a few water soaked leaves and a few pinches of mud. This set  should be made where the water does not run too swift. Muskrat will  bother this set some, as long as there are any near, but they are  troublesome about most any water set for mink.    The fur bearers here are fox, mink, skunk, opossum, raccoon and rats,  and none of them plentiful, writes a Tennessee trapper.      [Illustration: WHERE SIGNS ARE PLENTY.]    I will tell you how I captured a shy old mink that had run my line of  traps for two years. I had made up my mind to catch him or trap on  the balance of my days. I set my trap in the spring where he had been  wading; the first night he threw the trap and that seemed to make him  shy of the spring.    I took a piece of muskrat and nailed it to a root above the trap, and  the second morning I visited my trap I had a crow, not mink, and the  mink had killed the crow by biting him through the back of the head.    That made me more determined than ever to get that mink. I arranged  my traps all nicely, and the third morning I found a muskrat and he  was cut up badly by the mink. I took the fresh carcass of the rat and  rebaited again, and the fourth morning to my surprise I had another  crow.    It seemed from the amount of tracks that they had fought a duel and  the crow had come out ahead, for he was still alive. I fixed my trap  all back again and the fifth morning had a fine muskrat.    Well, I had about given up all hopes of catching him at that place so  I decided to move my set 200 yards up stream, where there was a log  projecting out over the water 2 feet above the water, where he  traveled under. There I gouged a hole back in the bank one foot back  so the water would flow back in enough to cover the trap, and I  baited with a fresh partridge, and the next morning I found my mink.  Now boys, this does not look as if they were very shy of human scent,  does it?    First find a den where they have been going under the ice or where  they have been eating a dead rabbit or chicken say an Iowa trapper.  Next I select my traps, Newhouse No. 1 or 1 1/2 or Hawley & Norton 1  1/2. I examine them to see if they are in good order. When setting at  a den or where they have been eating some dead animal, cover with  leaves, feathers or snow; fasten to a stick that can be dragged a  short distance. I bait with chicken, rabbit, birds and mice. Fish is  also good. Brush away your tracks and do not approach too close. If  the traps are undisturbed, I leave them for a week. Frequently mink  do not come out every night.    When setting where they go under the ice, I use a No. 2 Jump Trap. If  the water is not too deep, lay two sticks in the bottom of the stream  about two inches apart. Between these I lay bait, generally mice. Set  trap, and fasten it to a stick on top of the ice. Cover trap with  moss and leaves and you will generally get him, or, at least, that is  my luck.    I will always remember my first mink. I found the den. They went  under the ice and the hole was below the water. I set my trap  carefully, baited with sapsucker and the next morning I had him. Set  trap back and caught another one.        CHAPTER VII.    INDIAN METHODS.    Oftentimes while walking through the winter wood I find the track of  a mink, that starts or ends in a brook or pond, says a New England  trapper. To set a trap in this case, if "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34094"],[0,"Journal of Entomology and Zoology, Vol. 11, No. 2, June 1919 (#4)"],[1,"reference for \"Traite de zoologie      concrete\"        * Pg 38 Corrected spelling of \"say.\" to \"Say.\" in \"... say. subsp. ...\""]]]
