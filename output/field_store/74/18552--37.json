His head and  body are full of springs, and if anybody hits him in the face, or in the  pit of the stomach--favourite places to hit canvassers, the pit of the  stomach--it sets a strong spring in motion, and he fetches his right  hand round with a swipe that'll knock them into the middle of next week.  It's an awful hit. Griffo couldn't dodge it, and Slavin couldn't stand  up against it. No fear of any man hitting _him_ twice.    \"And he's dog-proof, too. His legs are padded with tar and oakum, and  if a dog bites a bit out of him, it will take that dog weeks to pick his  teeth clean. Never bite anybody again, that dog won't. And he'll talk,  talk, talk, like a suffragist gone mad; his phonograph can be charged  for 100,000 words, and all you've got to do is to speak into it what you  want him to say, and he'll say it. He'll go on saying it till he talks  his man silly, or gets an order. He has an order-form in his hand, and  as soon as anyone signs it and gives it back to him, that sets another  spring in motion, and he puts the order in his pocket, turns round, and  walks away. Grand idea, isn't he? Lor' bless you, I fairly love him.\"    He beamed affectionately on his monster.    \"What about stairs?\" said Dodge.    \"No stairs in the bush,\" said the Inventor, blowing a speck of dust off  his apparition; \"all ground-floor houses. Anyhow, if there were stairs  we could carry him up and let him fall down afterwards, or get flung  down like any other canvasser.\"    \"Ha! Let's see him walk,\" said Dodge.    The figure walked all right, stiff and erect.    \"Now let's hear him yabber.\"    The Genius touched a spring, and instantly, in a queer, tin-whistly  voice, he began to sing, \"Little Annie Rooney\".    \"Good!\" said Dodge; \"he'll do. We'll give you your price. Leave him here  to-night, and come in to-morrow. We'll send you off to the back country  with him. Ninemile would be a good place to start in. Have a cigar?\"    Mr. Dodge, much elated, sucked at his pipe, and blew through his nose a  cloud of nearly solid smoke, through which the Genius sidled out. They  could hear him sneezing and choking all the way down the stairs.    Ninemile is a quiet little place, sleepy beyond description. When the  mosquitoes in that town settle on anyone, they usually go to sleep, and  forget to bite him. The climate is so hot that the very grasshoppers  crawl into the hotel parlours out of the sun, climb up the window  curtains, and then go to sleep. The Riot Act never had to be read in  Ninemile. The only thing that can arouse the inhabitants out of their  lethargy is the prospect of a drink at somebody else's expense.    For these reasons it had been decided to start the Cast-iron Canvasser  there, and then move him on to more populous and active localities if he  proved a success. They sent up the Genius, and one of their men who knew  the district well. The Genius was to manage the automaton, and the other  was to lay out the campaign, choose the victims, and collect the money,  geniuses being notoriously unreliable and loose in their cash. They got  through a good deal of whisky on the way up, and when they arrived at  Ninemile were in a cheerful mood, and disposed to take risks.    \"Who'll we begin on?\" said the Genius.    \"Oh, hang it all,\" said the other, \"let's make a start with Macpherson.\"    Macpherson was a Land Agent, and the big bug of the place. He was a  gigantic Scotchman, six feet four in his socks, and freckled all over  with freckles as big as half-crowns. His eyebrows would have made  decent-sized moustaches for a cavalryman, and his moustaches looked like  horns. He was a fighter from the ground up, and had a desperate \"down\"  on canvassers generally, and on Sloper and Dodge's canvassers in  particular.    Sloper and Dodge had published a book called \"Remarkable Colonials\", and  Macpherson had written out his own biography for it. He was intensely  proud of his pedigree and his relations, and in his narrative made out  that he was descended from the original Fhairshon who swam round Noah's  Ark with his title-deeds in his teeth. He showed how his people had  fought under Alexander the Great and Timour, and had come over to  Scotland some centuries before William the Conqueror landed in England.  He proved that he was related in a general way to one emperor, fifteen  kings, twenty-five dukes, and earls and lords and viscounts innumerable.  And then, after all, the editor of \"Remarkable Colonials\" managed to mix  him up with some other fellow, some low-bred Irish McPherson, born in  Dublin of poor but honest parents.    It was a terrible outrage. Macpherson became president of the Western  District Branch of the \"Remarkable Colonials\" Defence League, a fierce  and homicidal association got up to resist, legally and otherwise,  paying for the book. He had further sworn by all he held sacred that  every canvasser who came to harry him in future should die, and had put  up a notice on his office-door, \"Canvassers come in at their own risk.\"    He had a dog of what he called the Hold'em breed, who could tell a  canvasser by his walk, and would go for him on sight. The reader will  understand, therefore, that, when the Genius and his mate proposed to  start on Macpherson, they were laying out a capacious contract for  the Cast-iron Canvasser, and could only have been inspired by a morbid  craving for excitement, aided by the influence of backblock whisky.    The Inventor wound the figure up in the back parlour of the pub. There  were a frightful lot of screws to tighten before the thing would work,  but at last he said it was ready, and they shambled off down the street,  the figure marching stiffly between them. It had a book tucked under  its arm and an order-form in its hand. When they arrived opposite  Macpherson's office, the Genius started the phonograph working, pointed  the figure straight at Macpherson's door, and set it going. Then the two  conspirators waited, like Guy Fawkes in his cellar.    The automaton marched across the road and in at the open door, talking  to itself loudly in a hoarse, unnatural voice.    Macpherson was writing at his table, and looked up.    The figure walked bang through a small collection of flower-pots, sent  a chair flying, tramped heavily in the spittoon, and then brought up  against the table with a loud crash and stood still. It was talking all  the time.    \"I have here,\" it said, \"a most valuable work, an Atlas of Australia,  which I desire to submit to your notice. The large and increasing demand  of bush residents for time-payment works has induced the publishers of  this----\"    \"My God!\" said Macpherson, \"it's a canvasser. Here, Tom Sayers, Tom  Sayers!\" and he whistled and called for his dog. \"Now,\" he said, \"will  you go out of this office quietly, or will you be thrown out? It's for  yourself to decide, but you've only got while a duck wags his tail to  decide in. Which'll it be?\"    \"---- works of modern ages,\" said the canvasser. \"Every person  subscribing to this invaluable work will receive, in addition, a  flat-iron, a railway pass for a year, and a pocket-compass. If you will  please sign this order----\"    Just here Tom Sayers came tearing through the office, and without  waiting for orders hitched straight on to the canvasser's calf. To  Macpherson's amazement the piece came clear away, and Tom Sayers rolled  about on the floor with his mouth full of a sticky substance which  seemed to surprise him badly.    The long Scotchman paused awhile before this mystery, but at last  he fancied he had got the solution. \"Got a cork leg, have you?\" said  he--\"Well, let's see if your ribs are cork too,\" and he struck the  canvasser an awful blow on the fifth button of the waistcoat.    Quicker than lightning came that terrific right-hand cross-counter.  Macpherson never even knew what happened to him. The canvasser's right  hand, which had been adjusted by his inventor for a high blow, had  landed on the butt of Macpherson's ear and dropped him like a fowl. The  gasping, terrified bull-dog fled the scene, and the canvasser stood over  his fallen foe, still intoning the virtues of his publication. He had  come there merely as a friend, he said, to give the inhabitants of  Ninemile a chance to buy a book which had recently earned the approval  of King O'Malley and His Excellency the Governor-General.    The Genius and his mate watched this extraordinary drama through the  window. The stimulant habitually consumed by the Ninemilers had induced  in them a state of superlative Dutch courage, and they looked upon the  whole affair as a wildly hilarious joke.    \"By Gad! he's done him,\" said the Genius, as Macpherson went down, \"done  him in one hit. If he don't pay as a canvasser I'll take him to town  and back him to fight Les Darcy. Look out for yourself; don't you handle  him!\" he continued as the other approached the figure. \"Leave him to  me. As like as not, if you get fooling about him, he'll give you a clout  that'll paralyse you.\"    So saying, he guided the automaton out of the office and into the  street, and walked straight into a policeman.    By a common impulse the Genius and his mate ran rapidly away in  different directions, leaving the figure alone with the officer.    He was a fully-ordained sergeant--by name Aloysius O'Grady; a squat,  rosy little Irishman. He hated violent arrests and all that sort of  thing, and had a faculty of persuading drunks and disorderlies and other  fractious persons to \"go quietly along wid him,\" that was little short  of marvellous. Excited revellers, who were being carried by their mates,  struggling violently, would break away to prance gaily along to the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30754"],[0,"The Stones of Venice, Volume 1 (of 3) (#4)"],[1,"itself be not the sign and evidence, rather than the cause, of national  enervation; or (lastly) whether, as I rather think, the history of  Venice might not be written almost without reference to the construction  of her senate or the prerogatives of her Doge. It is the history of a  people eminently at unity in itself, descendants of Roman race, long  disciplined by adversity, and compelled by its position either to live  nobly or to perish:--for a thousand years they fought for life; for  three hundred they invited death: their battle was rewarded, and their  call was heard.    Sec. VII. Throughout her career, the victories of Venice, and, at many  periods of it, her safety, were purchased by individual heroism; and the  man who exalted or saved her was sometimes (oftenest) her king,  sometimes a noble, sometimes a citizen. To him no matter, nor to her:  the real question is, not so much what names they bore, or with what  powers they were entrusted, as how they were trained; how they were made  masters of themselves, servants of their country, patient of distress,  impatient of dishonor; and what was the true reason of the change from  the time when she could find saviours among those whom she had cast into  prison, to that when the voices of her own children commanded her to  sign covenant with Death.[9]    Sec. VIII. On this collateral question I wish the reader's mind to be  fixed throughout all our subsequent inquiries. It will give double  interest to every detail: nor will the interest be profitless; for the  evidence which I shall be able to deduce from the arts of Venice will  be both frequent and irrefragable, that the decline of her political  prosperity was exactly coincident with that of domestic and individual  religion.    I say domestic and individual; for--and this is the second point which I  wish the reader to keep in mind--the most curious phenomenon in all  Venetian history is the vitality of religion in private life, and its  deadness in public policy. Amidst the enthusiasm, chivalry, or  fanaticism of the other states of Europe, Venice stands, from first to  last, like a masked statue; her coldness impenetrable, her exertion only  aroused by the touch of a secret spring. That spring was her commercial  interest,--this the one motive of all her important political acts, or  enduring national animosities. She could forgive insults to her honor,  but never rivalship in her commerce; she calculated the glory of her  conquests by their value, and estimated their justice by their facility.  The fame of success remains, when the motives of attempt are forgotten;  and the casual reader of her history may perhaps be surprised to be  reminded, that the expedition which was commanded by the noblest of her  princes, and whose results added most to her military glory, was one in  which while all Europe around her was wasted by the fire of its  devotion, she first calculated the highest price she could exact from  its piety for the armament she furnished, and then, for the advancement  of her own private interests, at once broke her faith[10] and betrayed  her religion.    Sec. IX. And yet, in the midst of this national criminality, we shall be  struck again and again by the evidences of the most noble individual  feeling. The tears of Dandolo were not shed in hypocrisy, though they  could not blind him to the importance of the conquest of Zara. The habit  of assigning to religion a direct influence over all _his own_ actions,  and all the affairs of _his own_ daily life, is remarkable in every  great Venetian during the times of the prosperity of the state; nor are  instances wanting in which the private feeling of the citizens reaches  the sphere of their policy, and even becomes the guide of its course  where the scales of expediency are doubtfully balanced. I sincerely  trust that the inquirer would be disappointed who should endeavor to  trace any more immediate reasons for their adoption of the cause of  Alexander III. against Barbarossa, than the piety which was excited by  the character of their suppliant, and the noble pride which was provoked  by the insolence of the emperor. But the heart of Venice is shown only  in her hastiest councils; her worldly spirit recovers the ascendency  whenever she has time to calculate the probabilities of advantage, or  when they are sufficiently distinct to need no calculation; and the  entire subjection of private piety to national policy is not only  remarkable throughout the almost endless series of treacheries and  tyrannies by which her empire was enlarged and maintained, but  symbolised by a very singular circumstance in the building of the city  itself. I am aware of no other city of Europe in which its cathedral was  not the principal feature. But the principal church in Venice was the  chapel attached to the palace of her prince, and called the \"Chiesa  Ducale.\" The patriarchal church,[11] inconsiderable in size and mean in  decoration, stands on the outermost islet of the Venetian group, and its  name, as well as its site, is probably unknown to the greater number of  travellers passing hastily through the city. Nor is it less worthy of  remark, that the two most important temples of Venice, next to the ducal  chapel, owe their size and magnificence, not to national effort, but to  the energy of the Franciscan and Dominican monks, supported by the vast  organization of those great societies on the mainland of Italy, and  countenanced by the most pious, and perhaps also, in his generation, the  most wise, of all the princes of Venice,[12] who now rests beneath the  roof of one of those very temples, and whose life is not satirized by  the images of the Virtues which a Tuscan sculptor has placed around his  tomb.    Sec. X. There are, therefore, two strange and solemn lights in which we  have to regard almost every scene in the fitful history of the Rivo  Alto. We find, on the one hand, a deep and constant tone of individual  religion characterising the lives of the citizens of Venice in her  greatness; we find this spirit influencing them in all the familiar and  immediate concerns of life, giving a peculiar dignity to the conduct  even of their commercial transactions, and confessed by them with a  simplicity of faith that may well put to shame the hesitation with which  a man of the world at present admits (even if it be so in reality) that  religious feeling has any influence over the minor branches of his  conduct. And we find as the natural consequence of all this, a healthy  serenity of mind and energy of will expressed in all their actions, and  a habit of heroism which never fails them, even when the immediate  motive of action ceases to be praiseworthy. With the fulness of this  spirit the prosperity of the state is exactly correspondent, and with  its failure her decline, and that with a closeness and precision which  it will be one of the collateral objects of the following essay to  demonstrate from such accidental evidence as the field of its inquiry  presents. And, thus far, all is natural and simple. But the stopping  short of this religious faith when it appears likely to influence  national action, correspondent as it is, and that most strikingly, with  several characteristics of the temper of our present English  legislature, is a subject, morally and politically, of the most curious  interest and complicated difficulty; one, however, which the range of  my present inquiry will not permit me to approach, and for the treatment  of which I must be content to furnish materials in the light I may be  able to throw upon the private tendencies of the Venetian character.    Sec. XI. There is, however, another most interesting feature in the  policy of Venice which will be often brought before us; and which a  Romanist would gladly assign as the reason of its irreligion; namely,  the magnificent and successful struggle which she maintained against the  temporal authority of the Church of Rome. It is true that, in a rapid  survey of her career, the eye is at first arrested by the strange drama  to which I have already alluded, closed by that ever memorable scene in  the portico of St. Mark's,[13] the central expression in most men's  thoughts of the unendurable elevation of the pontifical power; it is  true that the proudest thoughts of Venice, as well as the insignia of  her prince, and the form of her chief festival, recorded the service  thus rendered to the Roman Church. But the enduring sentiment of years  more than balanced the enthusiasm of a moment; and the bull of Clement  V., which excommunicated the Venetians and their doge, likening them to  Dathan, Abiram, Absalom, and Lucifer, is a stronger evidence of the  great tendencies of the Venetian government than the umbrella of the  doge or the ring of the Adriatic. The humiliation of Francesco Dandolo  blotted out the shame of Barbarossa, and the total exclusion of  ecclesiastics from all share in the councils of Venice became an  enduring mark of her knowledge of the spirit of the Church of Rome, and  of her defiance of it.    To this exclusion of Papal influence from her councils, the Romanist  will attribute their irreligion, and the Protestant their success.[14]  The first may be silenced by a reference to the character of the policy  of the Vatican itself; and the second by his own shame, when he reflects  that the English legislature sacrificed their principles to expose  themselves to the very danger which the Venetian senate sacrificed  theirs to avoid.    Sec. XII. One more circumstance remains to be noted respecting the  Venetian government, the singular unity of the families composing  it,--unity far from sincere or perfect, but still admirable when  contrasted with the fiery feuds, the almost daily revolutions, the  restless successions of families and parties in power, which fill  the annals of the other states of Italy. That rivalship should  sometimes be"]]]
