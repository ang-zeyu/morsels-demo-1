To kill them we  were wont to pinch off the head, and when all the blood had exuded the  flesh remained white and delicate. Greater delicacies even than ruffs  and reeves were godwits, which were fatted in like manner for the table.  Experiments in fattening were upon one occasion successfully tried with  a brood of greylag geese which we discovered on the marshes. As this is  the species from which the domestic stock is descended, we found little  difficulty in herding, though we were always careful to house them at  night, and pinioned them as the time of the autumnal migration came  round. We well knew that the skeins of wild geese which at this time  nightly cross the sky, calling as they fly, would soon have robbed us of  our little flock.    In winter, snipe were always numerous on the mosses, and were among the  first birds to be affected by severe weather. If on elevated ground when  the frost set in, they immediately betake themselves to the lowlands,  and at these times we used to take them in pantles made of twisted  horsehair. In preparing these we trampled a strip of oozy ground until,  in the darkness, it had the appearance of a narrow plash of water. The  snipe were taken as they came to feed on ground presumably containing  food of which they were fond. As well as woodcock and snipe, we took  larks by thousands. The pantles for these we set somewhat differently  than those intended for the minor game birds. A main line, sometimes as  much as a hundred yards in length, was set along the marsh; and to this  at short intervals were attached a great number of loops of horsehair in  which the birds were strangled. During the migratory season, or in  winter when larks are flocked, sometimes a hundred bunches of a dozen  each would be taken in a single day.    During the rigour of winter great flocks of migratory ducks and geese  came to the bay, and prominent among them were immense flocks of  scoters. Often from behind an ooze bank did we watch parties of these  playing and chasing each other over the crests of the waves, seeming  indifferent to the roughest seas. The coming of the scoter brought flush  times, and in hard weather our takes were tremendous. Another of the  wild ducks which visited us was the pochard or dunbird. We mostly called  it \"poker\" and \"redhead,\" owing to the bright chestnut of its neck and  head. It is somewhat heavily made, swims low in the water, and from its  legs being placed far behind for diving it is very awkward on land. In  winter the pochard was abundant on the coast, but as it was one of the  shyest of fowl it was always difficult to approach. If alarmed it  paddles rapidly away, turning its head, and always keeping an eye to the  rear. On account of its wariness it is oftener netted than shot. The  shore-shooters hardly ever get a chance at it. We used to take it in the  creeks on the marsh, and, as the matter is difficult to explain, I will  let the following quotation tell how it was done:    \"The water was surrounded with huge nets, fastened with poles laid flat  on the ground when ready for action, each net being, perhaps, sixty feet  long and twenty feet deep. When all was ready the pochards were  frightened off the water. Like all diving ducks they were obliged to  fly low for some distance, and also to head the wind before rising. Just  as the mass of birds reached the side of the pool, one of the immense  nets, previously regulated by weights and springs, rose upright as it  was freed from its fastenings by the fowler from a distance with a long  rope. If this were done at the right moment the ducks were met full in  the face by a wall of net, and thrown helpless into a deep ditch dug at  its foot for their reception.\"    In addition to our nets and snares we had a primitive fowling-piece,  though we only used it when other methods failed. It was an ancient  flint-lock, with tremendously long barrels. Sometimes it went off;  oftener it did not. I well remember with what desperation I, upon one  occasion, clung to this murderous weapon whilst it meditated, so to  speak. It is true that it brought down quite a wisp of dunlins, but then  there was almost a cloud of them to fire at. These and golden plover  were mainly the game for the flint-lock, and with them we were  peculiarly successful. If we had not been out all night we were  invariably abroad at dawn, when golden plover fly and feed in close  bodies. Upon these occasions sometimes a dozen birds were bagged at a  shot, though, after all, the chief product of our days were obtained in  the cymbal nets. We invariably used a decoy, and when the wild birds  were brought down, and came within the workings of the net, it was  rapidly pulled over and the game secured. For the most part, however,  only the smaller birds were taken in this way. Coots came round in their  season, and although they yielded a good harvest, netting them was not  very profitable, for as their flesh was dark and fishy only the  villagers and fisher-folk would buy them.    A curious little bird, the grebe or dabchick, used to haunt the pools  and ditches of the marsh, and we not unfrequently caught them in the  nets whilst drawing for salmon which ran up the creek to spawn. They had  curious feet, lobed like chestnut leaves, and hardly any wing. This  last was more like a flipper, and upon one occasion, when no less than  three had caught in the meshes, a dispute arose between us as to whether  they were able to fly. Kittiwake and I argued that whilst they were  resident and bred in the marshes, yet their numbers were greatly  augmented in autumn by other birds which came to spend the winter.  Whilst I contended that they flew, Kittiwake said that their tiny wings  could never support them, and certainly neither of us had ever seen them  on their journeyings. Two of the birds we took a mile from the water,  and then threw them into the air, when they darted off straight and  swift for the mosses which lay stretched at our feet a mile below.          [Illustration]    Chapter 4.    PARTRIDGE POACHING.      The bloom on the brambles; the ripening of the nuts; and the ruddiness  of the corn all acted as reminders that the \"fence\" time was rapidly  drawing to a close. So much did the first frosts quicken us that it was  difficult to resist throwing up our farm work before the game season was  fairly upon us. There was only one way in which we could curb the wild  impulse within. We stood up to the golden corn and smote it from the  rising to the going down of the sun. The hunters' moon tried hard to  win us to the old hard life of sport; but still the land must be  cleared. There was a double pleasure in the ruddy sheaves, for they told  of golden guineas, and until the last load was carried neither nets,  gins, nor the old duck-gun were of any use. The harvest housed the game  could begin, and then the sweet clover, which the hares loved, first  pushed their shoots between the stubble stalks. But neither the hares on  the fallows, the grouse on the moor, nor the pheasants on the bare  branches brought us so much pleasure as the partridge. A whole army of  shooters love the little brown birds, and we are quite of their way of  thinking.    A long life of poaching has not cooled our ardour for this phase of  woodcraft. At the outset we may state that we have almost invariably  observed close times, and have rarely killed a hare or game-bird out of  season. The man who excels in poaching must be country bred. He must not  only know the land, but the ways of the game by heart. Every sign of  wind and weather must be observed, as all help in the silent trade.  Then there is the rise and wane of the moon, the rain-bringing tides,  and the shifting of the birds with the seasons. These and a hundred  other things must be kept in an unwritten calendar, and only the poacher  can keep it. Speaking from hard experience, his out-door life will make  him quick; will endow him with much ready animal ingenuity. He will take  in an immense amount of knowledge of the life of the fields and woods;  and it is this teaching which will ultimately give him accuracy of eye  and judgment sufficient to interpret what he sees aright. To succeed the  poacher must be a specialist. It is better if he directs his attention  to \"fur,\" or to \"feather\" alone; but it is terribly hard to resist going  in for both. There is less scope for field ingenuity in taking game  birds; but at the same time there is always the probability of more  wholesale destruction. This arises from the fact of the birds being  gregarious. Both grouse and partridge go in coveys, and pheasants are  found in the company of their own kind. Partridges roost on the ground,  and sleep with tails tucked together and heads outwards. Examine the  fallow after they have left it in a morning, and this will be at once  apparent. A covey in this position represents little more than a mass of  feathers. It is for protective reasons that partridges always spend  their nights in the open. Birds which do not perch would soon become  extinct were they to seek the protection of woods and hedge-bottoms by  night. Such ground generally affords cover for vermin--weazels,  polecats, and stoats. Although partridges roam far by day, they  invariably come together at night, being partial to the same fields and  fallows. They run much, and rarely fly, except when passing from one  feeding ground to another. In coming together in the evening their calls  may be heard to some distance. These were the sounds we listened for,  and marked. We remembered the gorse bushes, and knew that the coveys  would not be far from them.    We always considered partridge good game, and sometimes were watching a  dozen coveys at the same time. September once in, there was never a  sun-down that did not see one of us on our rounds making mental notes.  It was not often, however, that more than three coveys were"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36974"],[0,"Old Trails on the Niagara Frontier (#4)"],[1," middle of February, 1641, when they began their retreat  from the land of the Neuters. The story of that retreat, as indeed of  the whole mission, has been most beautifully told, with a sympathetic  fervency impossible for one not richly endowed with faith to simulate,  by Dean Harris. Let his account of what happened stand here:    \"The snow was falling when they left the village Onguiara, crossed the  Niagara River near Queenston, ascended its banks and disappeared in the  shadowy forest. The path, which led through an unbroken wilderness, lay  buried in snow. The cold pierced them through and through. The cords on  Fr. Chaumonot's snow-shoe broke, and his stiffened fingers could  scarcely tie the knot. Innumerable flakes of snow were falling from  innumerable branches. Their only food was a pittance of Indian corn  mixed with melted snow; their only guide, a compass. Worn and spent with  hardships, these saintly men, carrying in sacks their portable altar,  were returning to announce to their priestly companions on the Wye the  dismal news of their melancholy failure and defeat. There was not a  hungry wolf that passed them but looked back and half forgave their  being human. There was not a tree but looked down upon them with pity  and commiseration. Night was closing in when, spent with fatigue, they  saw smoke rising at a distance. Soon they reached a clearing and  descried before them a cluster of bark lodges. Here these Christian  soldiers of the cross bivouacked for the night.    \"Early that evening while Chaumonot, worn with traveling and overcome  with sleep, threw himself to rest on a bed that was not made up since  the creation of the world, Father Brebeuf, to escape for a time the  acrid and pungent smoke that filled the cabin, went out to commune with  God alone in prayer.... He moved toward the margin of the woods, when  presently he stopped as if transfixed. Far away to the southeast, high  in the air and boldly outlined, a huge cross floated suspended in  mid-heaven. Was it stationary? No, it moved toward him from the land of  the Iroquois. The saintly face lighted with unwonted splendor, for he  saw in the vision the presage of the martyr's crown. Tree and hillside,  lodge and village, faded away, and while the cross was still slowly  approaching, the soul of the great priest went out in ecstasy, in loving  adoration to his Lord and his God.... Overcome with emotion, he  exclaimed, 'Who will separate me from the love of my Lord? Shall  tribulation, nakedness, peril, distress, or famine, or the sword?'  Emparadised in ecstatic vision, he again cries out with enthusiastic  loyalty, '_Sentio me vehementer impelli ad moriendum pro Christo_'--'I  feel within me a mighty impulse to die for Christ'--and flinging himself  upon his knees as a victim for the sacrifice or a holocaust for sin, he  registered his wondrous vow to meet martyrdom, when it came to him, with  the joy and resignation befitting a disciple of his Lord.    \"When he returned to himself the cross had faded away, innumerable stars  were brightly shining, the cold was wrapping him in icy mantle, and he  retraced his footsteps to the smoky cabin. He flung himself beside his  weary brother and laid him down to rest. When morning broke they began  anew their toilsome journey, holding friendly converse.    \"'Was the cross large?' asked Father Chaumonot.    \"'Large,' spoke back the other, 'yes, large enough to crucify us all.'\"    It is idle to insist on judgments by the ordinary standards in a case  like this. As Parkman says, it belongs not to history, but to  psychology. Brebeuf saw the luminous cross in the heavens above the  Niagara; not the material, out-reaching arms of Niagara's spray, rising  columnar from the chasm, then resting, with crosslike extensions on the  quiet air, white and pallid under the winter moon. Such phenomena are  not unusual above the cataract, but may not be offered in explanation of  the priest's vision. He was in the neighborhood of Grimsby, full twenty  miles from the falls, when he saw the cross; much too far away to catch  the gleam of frosted spray. Nor is it a gracious spirit which seeks a  material explanation for his vision. The cross truly presaged his  martyrdom; and although the feet of Father Brebeuf never again sought  the ungrateful land of the Neuters, yet his visit and his vision were  not wholly without fruit. They endow local history with an example of  pure devotion to the betterment of others, unsurpassed in all the annals  of the holy orders. To Brebeuf the miraculous cross foretold martyrdom,  and thereby was it a sign of conquest and of victory to this heroic  Constantine of the Niagara.           *       *       *       *       *    After Brebeuf and Chaumonot had turned their backs on the Neuters, the  Niagara region was apparently unvisited by white men for more than a  quarter of a century. These were not, however, years of peaceful hunting  and still more placid corn and pumpkin-growing, such as some romantic  writers have been fond of ascribing to the red men when they were  unmolested by the whites. As a matter of fact, and as Fathers Dallion,  Brebeuf and Chaumonot had discovered, the people who claimed the banks  of the lower reaches of the Niagara as within their territory, were the  embodiment of all that was vile and barbarous. There is no record that  they had a village at the angle of lake and river, where now stands old  Fort Niagara. It would have been strange, however, if they did not  occasionally occupy that sightly plateau with their wigwams or huts,  while they were laying in a supply of fish. If trees ever covered the  spot they were killed by early camp-fires, probably long before the  coming of the whites. Among the earliest allusions to the point is one  which speaks of the difficulty of getting wood there; and such a  treeless tract, in this part of the country, could usually be attributed  to the denudation consequent on Indian occupancy.    A decade or so after the retreat of the missionaries came that fierce  Indian strife which annihilated the Neuters and gave Niagara's banks  into the keeping of the fiercer but somewhat nobler Iroquois. The story  of this Indian war has been told with all possible illumination from the  few meager records that are known; and it only concerns the present  chronicle to note that about 1650 the site of Fort Niagara passed under  Seneca domination. The Senecas had no permanent town in the vicinity,  but undoubtedly made it a rendezvous for war parties, and for hunting  and fishing expeditions.    Meanwhile, the Jesuits in their Relations, and after them the  cartographers in Europe, were making hearsay allusions to the Niagara or  locating it, with much inaccuracy, on their now grotesque maps. In 1648  the Jesuit Ragueneau, writing to the Superior at Paris, mentions  Niagara, which he had never seen or approached, as \"a cataract of  frightful height.\" L'Allemant in the Relation published in 1642, had  alluded to the river, but not to the fall. Sanson, in 1656, put  \"Ongiara\" on his famous map; and four years later the map of Creuxius,  published with his great \"Historiae Canadensis,\" gave our river and fall  the Latin dignity of \"Ongiara Catarractes.\" One map-maker copied from  another, so that even by the middle of the seventeenth century, the  reading and student world--small and ecclesiastical as it mostly  was--began to have some inkling of the main features and continental  position of the mid-lake region for the possession of which, a little  later, several Forts Niagara were to be projected. It is not, however,  until 1669 that we come to another definite episode in the history of  the region.    In that year came hither the Sulpitian missionaries, Francois Dollier de  Casson and Rene de Brehant[3] de Galinee. They were bent on carrying the  cross to nations hitherto unreached, on Western rivers. With them was  the young Robert Cavelier, known as La Salle, who was less interested in  carrying the cross than in exploring the country. Their expedition left  Montreal July 6th, nine canoes in all. They made their way up the St.  Lawrence, skirted the south shore of Lake Ontario, and on Aug. 10th were  at Irondequoit Bay. They made a most eventful visit to the Seneca  villages south of the bay. Thence they continued westward, apparently by  Indian trails overland, and not by canoe. De Galinee, who was the  historian of the expedition, says that they came to a river \"one eighth  of a league broad and extremely rapid, forming the outlet or  communication from Lake Erie to Lake Ontario,\" and he continues with a  somewhat detailed account of Niagara Falls, which, although he passed  near them, he did not turn aside to see. The Sulpitians and La Salle  crossed the river, apparently below Lewiston. They may indeed have come  to the river at its mouth, skirting the lake shore. One may infer either  course from the narrative of de Galinee, which goes on to say that five  days after passing the river they \"arrived at the extremity of Lake  Ontario, where there is a fine, large sandy bay ... and where we  unloaded our canoes.\"    Pushing on westward, late in September, on the trail between Burlington  Bay and the Grand River, they met Joliet, returning from his expedition  in search of copper mines on Lake Superior. This meeting in the  wilderness is a suggestive and picturesque subject, but we may not dwell  on it here. Joliet, though he had thus preceded LaSalle and the  Sulpitians in the exploration of the lakes, had gone west by the old  northern route along the Ottawa, Lake Nipissing and the French River. He  was never on the Niagara, for after his meeting with LaSalle, he  continued eastward by way of the Grand River valley and Lake Ontario.  Fear of the savages deterred him from coming by way of the Niagara, and  thereby, it is not unlikely, becoming the white discoverer of Niagara  Falls.[4] He was the first white man, so "]]]
