Captain Cook  was then the only one remaining on the rock: he was observed making for  the pinnace, holding his left-hand against the back of his head, to  guard it from the stones, and carrying his musket under the other arm.  An Indian was seen following him, but with caution and timidity; for he  stopped once or twice, as if undetermined to proceed. At last he  advanced upon him unawares, and with a large club,[6] or common stake,  gave him a blow on the back of the head, and then precipitately  retreated. The stroke seemed to have stunned Captain Cook: he staggered  a few paces, then fell on his hand and one knee, and dropped his musket.  As he was rising, and before he could recover his feet, another Indian  stabbed him in the back of the neck with an iron dagger. He then fell  into a bite of water about knee deep, where others crowded upon him, and  endeavoured to keep him under: but struggling very strongly with them,  he got his head up, and casting his look towards the pinnace, seemed to  solicit assistance. Though the boat was not above five or six yards  distant from him, yet from the crowded and confused state of the crew,  it seems, it was not in their power to save him. The Indians got him  under again, but in deeper water: he was, however, able to get his head  up once more, and being almost spent in the struggle, he naturally  turned to the rock, and was endeavouring to support himself by it, when  a savage gave him a blow with a club, and he was seen alive no more.  They hauled him up lifeless on the rocks, where they seemed to take a  savage pleasure in using every barbarity to his dead body, snatching the  daggers out of each other's hands, to have the horrid satisfaction of  piercing the fallen victim of their barbarous rage.    I need make no reflection on the great loss we suffered on this  occasion, or attempt to describe what we felt. It is enough to say, that  no man was ever more beloved or admired; and it is truly painful to  reflect, that he seems to have fallen a sacrifice merely for want of  being properly supported; a fate, singularly to be lamented, as having  fallen to his lot, who had ever been conspicuous for his care of those  under his command, and who seemed, to the last, to pay as much attention  to their preservation, as to that of his own life.    If any thing could have added to the shame and indignation universally  felt on the occasion, it was to find, that his remains had been  deserted, and left exposed on the beach, although they might have been  brought off. It appears, from the information of four or five  midshipmen, who arrived on the spot at the conclusion of the fatal  business, that the beach was then almost entirely deserted by the  Indians, who at length had given way to the fire of the boats, and  dispersed through the town: so that there seemed no great obstacle to  prevent the recovery of Captain Cook's body; but the lieutenant returned  on board without making the attempt. It is unnecessary to dwell longer  on this painful subject, and to relate the complaints and censures that  fell on the conduct of the lieutenant. It will be sufficient to observe,  that they were so loud, as to oblige Captain Clerke publicly to notice  them, and to take the depositions of his accusers down in writing. The  Captain's bad state of health and approaching dissolution, it is  supposed, induced him to destroy these papers a short time before his  death.    It is a painful task, to be obliged to notice circumstances, which seem  to reflect upon the character of any man. A strict regard to truth,  however, compelled me to the insertion of these facts, which I have  offered merely as facts, without presuming to connect with them any  comment of my own: esteeming it the part of a faithful historian, \"to  extenuate nothing, nor set down ought in malice.\"    The fatal accident happened about eight o'clock in the morning, about an  hour after Captain Cook landed. It did not seem, that the king, or his  sons, were witnesses to it; but it is supposed that they withdrew in the  midst of the tumult. The principal actors were the other chiefs, many of  them the king's relations and attendants: the man who stabbed him with  the dagger was called Nooah (Nuaa). I happened to be the only one who  recollected his person, from having on a former occasion mentioned his  name in the journal I kept. I was induced to take particular notice of  him, more from his personal appearance than any other consideration,  though he was of high rank, and a near relation of the king: he was  stout and tall, with a fierce look and demeanour, and one who united in  his figure the two qualities of strength and agility, in a greater  degree, than ever I remembered to have seen before in any other man. His  age might be about thirty, and by the white scurf on his skin, and his  sore eyes, he appeared to be a hard drinker of Kava (awa). He was a  constant companion of the king, with whom I first saw him, when he paid  a visit to Captain Clerke. The chief who first struck Captain Cook with  the club, was called Karimano-craha[7] (Kalaimanokahoowaha), but I did  not know him by his name. These circumstances I learnt of honest  Kaireekea (Keliikia), the priest; who added, that they were both held in  great esteem on account of that action; neither of them came near us  afterwards. When the boats left the shore, the Indians carried away the  dead body of Captain Cook and those of the marines, to the rising  ground, at the back of the town, where we could plainly see them with  our glasses from the ships.    This most melancholy accident, appears to have been altogether  unexpected and unforeseen, as well on the part of the natives as  ourselves. I never saw sufficient reason to induce me to believe, that  there was any thing of design, or a pre-concerted plan on their side, or  that they purposely sought to quarrel with us: thieving, which gave rise  to the whole, they were equally guilty of, in our first and second  visits. It was the cause of every misunderstanding that happened between  us: their petty thefts were generally overlooked, but sometimes slightly  punished: the boat, which they at last ventured to take away, was an  object of no small magnitude to people in our situation, who could not  possibly replace her, and therefore not slightly to be given up. We had  no other chance of recovering her, but by getting the person of the king  into our possession: on our attempting to do that, the natives became  alarmed for his safety, and naturally opposed those whom they deemed  his enemies. In the sudden conflict that ensued, we had the unspeakable  misfortune of losing our excellent Commander, in the manner already  related. It is in this light the affair has always appeared to me, as  entirely accidental, and not in the least owing to any previous offence  received, or jealousy of our second visit entertained by the natives.    Pareah (Palea) seems to have been the principal instrument in bringing  about this fatal disaster. We learnt afterwards, that it was he who had  employed some people to steal the boat: the king did not seem to be  privy to it, or even apprized of what had happened, till Captain Cook  landed.    It was generally remarked, that at first, the Indians shewed great  resolution in facing our fire-arms; but it was entirely owing to  ignorance of their effect. They thought that their thick mats would  defend them from a ball, as well as from a stone; but being soon  convinced of their error, yet still at a loss to account how such  execution was done among them, they had recourse to a stratagem, which,  though it answered no other purpose, served to show their ingenuity and  quickness of invention. Observing the flashes of the muskets, they  naturally concluded, that water would counteract their effect, and  therefore, very sagaciously dipped their mats, or armour in the sea,  just as they came on to face our people: but finding this last resource  to fail them, they soon dispersed, and left the beach entirely clear. It  was an object they never neglected, even at the greatest hazard, to  carry off their slain; a custom, probably, owing to the barbarity with  which they treat the dead body of an enemy, and the trophies they make  of his bones.[8]          Some Particulars Concerning the Life and Character of Captain Cook      Captain Cook was born at Marton, in Cleaveland, in the county of York, a  small village, distant five miles south-east from Stockton. His name is  found in the parish register in the year 1729 (so that Captain King was  mistaken, in placing the time of his birth in the year 1727). The  cottage in which his father formerly lived, is now decayed, but the spot  where it stood is still shewn to strangers. A gentleman is now living in  that neighbourhood, with whom the old man formerly worked as a common  day-labourer in the fields. However, though placed in this humble  station, he gave his son a common school education, and at an early age,  placed him apprentice with one Mr. Saunderson, a shopkeeper at Staith  (always pronounced Steers), a small fishing-town on the Yorkshire coast,  about nine miles to the northward of Whitby. The business is now carried  on by the son of Mr. Saunderson, in the same shop, which I had the  curiosity to visit about a year and a half ago. In that situation young  Cook did not continue long, before he quitted it in disgust, and, as  often happens in the like cases, betook himself to the sea. Whitby being  a neighbouring sea-port, readily offered him an opportunity to pursue  his inclination; and there we find he bound himself apprentice, for nine  years, in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34645"],[0,"The History of Painting in Italy, Vol. 3 (of 6) (#4)"],[1,"is no more mention made of  Giovanni, but only of Antonio; sometimes alone, sometimes together with  some other of the Vivarini. Thus, his name is subscribed alone in San  Antonio Abate di Pesaro, upon an altarpiece of the titular saint,  surrounded by the figures of three young martyrs, with some smaller  paintings attached; the production of a very animated colourist, and  displaying forms inferior to none in the school of Murano. I have seen  two other specimens, in which he is mentioned together with a second  Vivarino. The least excellent of these is to be found in San Francesco  Grande, at Padua, consisting of a Madonna, with some saints, in various  compartments; and, at the foot of it, is the following memorandum, _Anno  1451, Antonius et Bartholomeus fratres de Murano pinxerunt hoc opus_.  Similar to this, the two brothers had produced another the year  preceding, in the Certosa of Bologna, where it is still in a high state  of preservation, beyond any other specimen I have seen belonging to this  family. There is much worthy of commendation in each figure of the whole  piece; features dignified and devout; appropriate dresses; care in the  disposition of the hair and beards, united to a colouring warm and  brilliant.    According to what appears, Bartolommeo must have been held of less  account than Antonio, until the discovery of painting in oil being  introduced into Venice, he became one among the first to profit by it,  and, towards the period in which the two Bellini appeared, was held in  pretty high repute.    The first specimen of his painting in oil exists at S. Giovanni e Paolo,  not far from the gate, and exhibits, among other saints, P. San  Agostino, with an indication of the year 1473. From that period he  continued to distinguish himself, producing a great number of pieces  both in oil and in water colour, sometimes with more, and sometimes with  less care, but always in the ancient taste for subdividing the  altarpiece into several parts, in each of which he represented separate  heads or entire figures. In these he often marked the name of Vivarino,  with the year of their production; and occasionally he has added a finch  or linnet by way of allusion to his family name. His last work, bearing  the date of the year, is a Christ risen from the dead, at San Giovanni,  in Bragora, where Boschini read the date of 1498, which is now no longer  apparent; but it is a piece which, in every part, may be said to vie  with that of the best Venetian artists who flourished during the same  period.    Contemporary with him was a Luigi of the same name, one of whose  productions was seen by Zanetti, in a collection of paintings, with the  date of 1490, and as appeared to him, strongly approaching, in point of  taste, to the best style of Bartolommeo. To Luigi, also, must  undoubtedly be ascribed the altarpiece, which, in San Francesco di  Trevigi, bears his name. There is another at the Battuti, in Belluno,  representing the saints Piero, Girolamo, and some others, a work which  cost that school 100 gold ducats, besides the expenses of the artist,  who has attached to it his name. But superior to every other of his  existing specimens, is that fine picture in the school of San Girolamo,  at Venice, in which he represented a history of the titular saint, in  emulation of Giovanni Bellino, whom he here equalled, and of Carpaccio,  whom he surpassed. He has drawn the saint in the act of caressing a  lion, while several monks are seen flying in terror at the sight. The  composition is very fine; the passions are tolerably well pourtrayed,  the colours as soft and delicate as in any other of the Vivarini; the  architecture solid, and in the ancient taste, while the epoch is more  modern than that which could be ascribed to the supposed Luigi, the  elder. Such is our exposition of the whole series of the School of  Murano, up to the period of its greatest improvement, so as to bring it  under one point of view. I shall now, therefore, resume the thread of my  narrative, relating to the elder artists of the fourteenth century, who  competed with the oldest of the school of Murano, until the era of  painting in oil; and I shall afterwards proceed to treat apart of the  more modern.    In the early part of the century, an artist of the name of Gentile da  Fabriano, had been employed in the public palace at Venice, highly  distinguished in his time, but of whom I must not here repeat what has  been said in the first volume of this work. He there depicted a naval  battle scene, a production greatly extolled in former times, which has  long since perished. He produced, also, some disciples, as we find  mention of a Jacopo Nerito, from Padua, who, in a painting at San  Michele di Padova, according to Rossetti, subscribes himself one of his  pupils. Nasocchio di Bassano, the elder, is to be ranked also, either as  one of his scholars or his imitators, if, indeed, a small picture  pointed out to me by the late Signor Verci was by his hand.    Among other Venetians, Jacopo Bellini, at once the father and the master  of Gentile and Giovanni of the same name, of whom more hereafter, was  certainly a pupil of Gentile da Fabriano. Jacopo, however, is better  known by the celebrity of his sons, than by his own works, at this time  either destroyed or unknown. He had painted in the school of S. Giovanni  Evangelista at Venice, and in the chapel of the Gatta Melata, at the  Santo di Padova, about 1456; but these labours survive only in history,  nor have I met with any other specimen besides a Madonna, discovered by  Sig. Sasso, bearing the signature of its author. The style appears taken  from that of Squarcione, to which he is supposed to have applied himself  in his more advanced years.    There was also another Jacopo in very high repute,[17] called Jacobello  del Fiore, who has been falsely accused by Vasari, of having drawn his  figures all resting on the tip of their toes, in the manner of the  Greeks. His father, Francesco, was considered in the light of a  Coryphaeus of the art, and his tomb is still to be seen at Santi Giovanni  e Paolo, with a figure of him in his toga, and a commendatory epitaph in  Latin verse. No works of his, however, are to be seen in Venice,[18] a  dittico, or small altar, with his name having been conveyed to London,  bearing the date of 1412. It was obtained by the Chevalier Strange,  together with some other productions of the old Venetian artists. The  son of Francesco rose to a still higher degree of celebrity. He began to  make himself known as early as 1401, by producing an altarpiece at San  Cassiano di Pesaro, in which city I discovered another, with the date of  1409, and both bear the signature of _Jacometto de Flor_. A much nobler  work is a coronation of the Virgin, in the cathedral of Ceneda,  extremely rich in figures, insomuch as to have deserved the name of the  \"Painting of Paradise,\" in a MS. of the lives of the bishops of that  place, which is preserved in the episcopal residence, and declares the  work to have been executed, _ab eximio illius temporis pictore Jacobello  de Flore_, 1432, at the expense of the bishop, Ant. Correr. There is a  Madonna, indisputably by his hand, in possession of Sig. Girolamo  Manfrini, painted in 1436, besides the _Giustizia_, drawn between two  archangels, in the _Magistrato del Proprio_, bearing the date of 1421. I  may venture to say that few artists of that time equalled him; both on  account of his having few rivals who had so early ventured to attempt  drawing figures as large as the life, and because of his power of  conferring upon them a certain grace and dignity, and, where called for,  a vigour and ease rarely to be met with in other paintings. The two  lions which he represented as symbols of his _Giustizia_ (Justice), are  truly grand, though the rest of the figures would have appeared to more  advantage had they been less loaded with ornaments, and in particular  the draperies glowing with gold lace, according to the custom of his  age. He had a rival in Giacomo Morazone, known by an altarpiece seen in  the island of St. Elena, of which I shall have to speak elsewhere.    Two pupils of Jacobello are recorded by Ridolfi, one of whom, Donato, is  superior to his master in point of style, and the other, Carlo Crivelli,  of whom the capital can boast only one or two pieces, and of whom little  mention is made in Venetian history. It would appear that he long  resided out of his native place, and in the Marca Trevigiana, from which  circumstance we find him repeatedly named in the _Storia Picena_, in the  _Guida di Ascoli_, and in the catalogue of Fabrianese paintings. At San  Francesco di Matelica, I saw an altarpiece and _grado_ by his hand, with  his name in the following inscription--_Carolus Crivellus Venetus miles  pinxit_, as well as another with his name at the Osservanti, in  Macerata, and a third which bears the year 1476, in possession of the  Cardinal Zelada. He is an artist more remarkable for his force of  colouring than for his correctness of design: and his principal merit  consists in those little history pieces, in which he has represented  beautiful landscapes, and given to his figures grace, motion, and  expression, with some traces of the colouring of the School of Perugia.  Hence his productions have occasionally been taken for those of Pietro,  as in the instance of that in Macerata; and if I mistake not, such an  opinion was entertained, even by the learned Father Civalli, (p. 60). In  Piceno, likewise, in Monsanmartino, or in Penna S. Giovanni, there  remain altarpieces by Vittorio Crivelli, a Venetian, most probably of  the same family, and produced in the years 1489 and 90, from which  period I lose sight of him, whether owing to his early decease, or his  having set out in pursuit of better fortune into foreign parts.    Hitherto we have examined only the productions of the capital and of the  "]]]
