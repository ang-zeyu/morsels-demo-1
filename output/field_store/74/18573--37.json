Olson's (1933) U.S. patent 1901926.]    Figure 21 shows a plan view[7] of the machine, and figure 22 a detailed  view of the sine-bar mechanism actuated by the master screw, 6, to  modify the effective pitch of the lead screw in accordance with the  realities of practice as stated in the preamble of the patent:         This invention relates to material working machines, and       particularly to machines such as hob grinders and the like, wherein       the work is reciprocated through the agency of a lead screw.         In the manufacture of hobs it is common practice to employ the same       machine for grinding hobs of varied diameters, and in order to       employ such a machine in this manner the pitch of the lead screw,       thereof, which actuates the work carrier, must conform to the axial       pitch of the hob to be ground. This will be readily apparent when       it is understood that the helix angles of hobs vary in accordance       with their diameters and, consequently, the difference between the       normal pitch and the axial pitch correspondingly varies. While the       requirement for the normal pitch may be the same for hobs of       different diameters, it is necessary to change the axial pitch in       accordance with a change in the hob diameter, and this axial pitch       of the hob is equal to the pitch of the lead screw which actuates       the work carrier in grinding machines heretofore used. Hence, in       order to adapt such machines to cover a wide range of leads, it is       necessary to provide a large number of interchangeable lead screws       and obviously this represents a large investment, and the       interchanging of these screws requires the expenditure of       considerable time in setting up the machine for each job.    Thread-grinding machines were being designed concurrent with the  development of hob-grinding machines. Many were entirely concerned with  features peculiar to the problems of wheel-dressing and to automatic  characteristics. An invention to embody the use of a master screw and  concerned with the precision grinding of worm threads, for use in  gearing, was patented by Frederick A. Ward in this era.[8] That part of  the invention pertaining to the use of a master screw, \"a rotary work  holder mounted on said carriage and provided with a driving spindle, an  exchangeable master screw and stationary nut detachably secured to said  spindle and head,...\" is shown in figure 23.    [Illustration: Figure 23.--DETAILS OF A WORK SPINDLE WITH WORK, showing  the use of a master lead screw to control the pitch of a precision worm  thread being ground. From the 1933 U.S. patent 1899654, of F. A. Ward's  worm-grinding machine.]    Machines embodying the principle of the master lead screw are found in  constant use by industry at the present time for specialized  application. Whenever technological changes again reopen the topic of  thread-cutting to a new degree of accuracy or call for a reevaluation of  popular methods for any other reason, we may expect to see another  resurgence of the master-screw method, for no other design eliminates so  many variables or rests on such firm and fundamental natural principles  as the machine of _Das mittelalterliche Hausbuch_ of 1483, the earliest  such machine now known.

[L] \"My dog is _very_ musical,\" I have heard said in all seriousness.    Should the dog take precedence of Berlioz?      [M] Such has been my own fate.    In a country like Italy, where all participate in the delights of music,  this differentiation becomes superfluous, and the term corresponding is  not found in the language. In France, where a living sense of music does  not permeate the people, there are musicians and non-musicians; of the  rest, some \"are very fond of music,\" and others \"do not care for it.\"  Only in Germany is it made a point of honor to be \"musical,\" that is to  say, not merely to love music, but more especially to understand it as  regards its technical means of expression, and to obey their rules.    A thousand hands support the buoyant child and solicitously attend its  footsteps, that it may not soar aloft where there might be risk of a  serious fall. But it is still so young, and is eternal; the day of its  freedom will come.--When it shall cease to be \"musical.\"                               *       *       *    THE creator should take over no traditional law in blind belief, which  would make him view his own creative endeavor, from the outset, as an  exception contrasting with that law. For his individual case he should  seek out and formulate a fitting individual law, which, after the first  complete realization, he should annul, that he himself may not be drawn  into repetitions when his next work shall be in the making.    The function of the creative artist consists in making laws, not in  following laws ready made. He who follows such laws, ceases to be a  creator.    Creative power may be the more readily recognized, the more it shakes  itself loose from tradition. But an intentional avoidance of the rules  cannot masquerade as creative power, and still less engender it.    The true creator strives, in reality, after _perfection_ only. And  through bringing this into harmony with _his own_ individuality, a new  law arises without premeditation.                               *       *       *    So narrow has our tonal range become, so stereotyped its form of  expression, that nowadays there is not one familiar motive that cannot  be fitted with some other familiar motive so that the two may be played  simultaneously. Not to lose my way in trifling,[N] I shall refrain from  giving examples.      [N] With a friend I once indulged in such trifling in order to    ascertain how many commonly known compositions were written according    to the scheme of the second theme in the Adagio of the Ninth Symphony.    In a few moments we had collected some fifteen analogues of the most    different kinds, among them specimens of the lowest type of art. And    Beethoven himself:--Is the theme of the Finale in the \"Fifth\" any    other than the one wherewith the \"Second\" introduces its Allegro?--or    than the principal theme of the Third Piano Concerto, only in minor?                               *       *       *    That which, within our present-day music, most nearly approaches the  essential nature of the art, is the Rest and the Hold (Pause).  Consummate players, improvisers, know how to employ these instruments of  expression in loftier and ampler measure. The tense silence between two  movements--_in itself music_, in this environment--leaves wider scope  for divination than the more determinate, but therefore less elastic,  sound.                               *       *       *    What we now call our Tonal System is nothing more than a set of \"signs\";  an ingenious device to grasp somewhat of that eternal harmony; a meagre  pocket-edition of that encyclopedic work; artificial light instead of  the sun.--Have you ever noticed how people gaze open-mouthed at the  brilliant illumination of a hall? They never do so at the millionfold  brighter sunshine of noonday.--    And so, in music, the signs have assumed greater consequence than that  which they ought to stand for, and can only suggest.    How important, indeed, are \"Third,\" \"Fifth,\" and \"Octave\"! How strictly  we divide \"consonances\" from \"dissonances\"--_in a sphere where no  dissonances can possibly exist_!    We have divided the octave into twelve equidistant degrees, because we  had to manage somehow, and have constructed our instruments in such a  way that we can never get in above or below or between them. Keyboard  instruments, in particular, have so thoroughly schooled our ears that we  are no longer capable of hearing anything else--incapable of hearing  except through this impure medium. Yet Nature created an _infinite  gradation_--_infinite!_ who still knows it nowadays?[O]      [O] \"The equal temperament of 12 degrees, which was discussed    theoretically as early as about 1500, but not established as a    principle until shortly before 1700 (by Andreas Werkmeister),    divides the octave into twelve equal portions (semitones, hence    'twelve-semitone system') through which mean values are obtained;    no interval is perfectly pure, but all are fairly serviceable.\"    (Riemann, \"Musik-Lexikon.\") Thus, through Andreas Werkmeister, this    master-workman in art, we have gained the \"twelve-semitone\" system    with intervals which are all impure, but fairly serviceable. But what    is \"pure,\" and what \"impure\"? We hear a piano \"gone out of tune,\" and    whose intervals may thus have become \"pure, but unserviceable,\" and it    sounds _impure_ to us. The diplomatic \"Twelve-semitone system\" is an    invention mothered by necessity; yet none the less do we sedulously    guard its imperfections.    And within this duodecimal octave we have marked out a series of fixed  intervals, seven in number, and founded thereon our entire art of music.  What do I say--_one_ series? Two such series, one for each leg: The  Major and Minor Scales. When we start this series of intervals on some  other degree of our semitonic ladder, we obtain a _new key_, and a  \"foreign\" one, at that! How violently contracted a system arose from  this initial confusion,[P] may be read in the law-books; we will not  repeat it here.      [P] It is termed \"The Science of Harmony.\"                               *       *       *    We teach four-and-twenty keys, twelve times the two Series of Seven;  but, in point of fact, we have at our command only two, the major key  and the minor key. _The rest are merely transpositions._ By means of the  several transpositions we are supposed to get different shades of  harmony; but this is an illusion. In England, under the reign of the  high \"concert pitch,\" the most familiar works may be played a semitone  higher than they are written, without changing their effect. Singers  transpose an aria to suit their convenience, leaving untransposed what  precedes and follows. Song-writers not infrequently publish their own  compositions in three different pitches; in all three editions the  pieces are precisely alike.    When a well-known face looks out of a window, it matters not whether it  gazes down from the first story or the third.    Were it feasible to elevate or depress a landscape, far as eye can  reach, by several hundred yards, the pictorial impression would neither  gain nor lose by it.                               *       *       *    Upon the two Series of Seven, the major key and the minor key, the whole  art of music has been established; one limitation brings on the other.    To each of these a definite character has been attributed; we have  learned and have taught that they should be heard as contrasts, and they  have gradually acquired the significance of symbols:--Major and  Minor--Maggiore e Minore--Contentment and Discontent--Joy and  Sorrow--Light and Shade. The harmonic symbols have fenced in the  expression of music, from Bach to Wagner, and yet further on until  to-day and the day after to-morrow. _Minor_ is employed with the same  intention, and has the same effect upon us now, as two hundred years  ago. Nowadays it is no longer possible to \"compose\" a funeral march, for  it already exists, once for all. Even the least informed  non-professional knows what to expect when a funeral march--whichever  you please--is to be played. Even such an one can anticipate the  difference between a symphony in major and one in minor. We are  tyrannized by Major and Minor--by the bifurcated garment.                               *       *       *    Strange, that one should feel major and minor as opposites. They both  present the same face, now more joyous, now more serious; and a mere  touch of the brush suffices to turn the one into the other. The passage  from either to the other is easy and imperceptible; when it occurs  frequently and swiftly, the two begin to shimmer and coalesce  indistinguishably.--But when we recognize that major and minor form one  Whole with a double meaning, and that the \"four-and-twenty keys\" are  simply an elevenfold transposition of the original twain, we arrive  unconstrainedly at a perception of the UNITY _of our system of keys_  [tonality]. The conceptions of \"related\" and \"foreign\" keys vanish, and  with them the entire intricate theory of degrees and relations. _We  possess one single key._ But it is of most meagre sort.                               *       *       *    \"Unity of the key-system.\"    --\"I suppose you mean that 'key' and 'key-system' are the sunbeam and  its diffraction into colors?\"    No; that I can not mean. For our whole system of tone, key, and  tonality, taken in its entirety, is only a part of a fraction of one  diffracted ray from that Sun, \"Music,\" in the empyrean of the \"eternal  harmony.\"                               *       *       *    However deeply rooted the attachment to the habitual, and inertia, may  be in the ways and nature of humankind, in equal measure are energy, and  opposition to the existing"]]]
