[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/418"],[0,"A Treatise on Good Works (#4)"],[1," of the Faith itself--how we are  daily to pray or recite it.    I humbly commend myself herewith to your princely Grace, Your Princely  Grace's Humble Chaplain,    DR. MARTIN LUTHER.    From Wittenberg, March 29th, A. D. 1520.          THE TREATISE    I. We ought first to know that there are no good works except those  which God has commanded, even as there is no sin except that which God  has forbidden. Therefore whoever wishes to know and to do good works  needs nothing else than to know God's commandments. Thus Christ says,  Matthew xix, \"If thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments.\" And  when the young man asks Him, Matthew xix, what he shall do that he may  inherit eternal life, Christ sets before him naught else but the Ten  Commandments. Accordingly, we must learn how to distinguish among good  works from the Commandments of God, and not from the appearance, the  magnitude, or the number of the works themselves, nor from the judgment  of men or of human law or custom, as we see has been done and still is  done, because we are blind and despise the divine Commandments.    II. The first and highest, the most precious of all good works is faith  in Christ, as He says, John vi. When the Jews asked Him: \"What shall we  do that we may work the works of God?\" He answered: \"This is the work  of God, that ye believe on Him Whom He hath sent.\" When we hear or  preach this word, we hasten over it and deem it a very little thing and  easy to do, whereas we ought here to pause a long time and to ponder it  well. For in this work all good works must be done and receive from it  the inflow of their goodness, like a loan. This we must put bluntly,  that men may understand it.    We find many who pray, fast, establish endowments, do this or that,  lead a good life before men, and yet if you should ask them whether  they are sure that what they do pleases God, they say, \"No\"; they do  not know, or they doubt. And there are some very learned men, who  mislead them, and say that it is not necessary to be sure of this; and  yet, on the other hand, these same men do nothing else but teach good  works. Now all these works are done outside of faith, therefore they  are nothing and altogether dead. For as their conscience stands toward  God and as it believes, so also are the works which grow out of it. Now  they have no faith, no good conscience toward God, therefore the works  lack their head, and all their life and goodness is nothing.  Hence it  comes that when I exalt faith and reject such works done without faith,  they accuse me of forbidding good works, when in truth I am trying hard  to teach real good works of faith.    III. If you ask further, whether they count it also a good work when  they work at their trade, walk, stand, eat, drink, sleep, and do all  kinds of works for the nourishment of the body or for the common  welfare, and whether they believe that God takes pleasure in them  because of such works, you will find that they say, \"No\"; and they  define good works so narrowly that they are made to consist only of  praying in church, fasting, and almsgiving. Other works they consider  to be in vain, and think that God cares nothing for them. So through  their damnable unbelief they curtail and lessen the service of God, Who  is served by all things whatsoever that are done, spoken or thought in  faith.    So teaches Ecclesiastes ix: \"Go thy way with joy, eat and drink, and  know that God accepteth thy works. Let thy garments be always white;  and let thy head lack no ointment. Live joyfully with the wife whom  thou lovest all the days of the life of thy vanity.\" \"Let thy garments  be always white,\" that is, let all our works be good, whatever they may  be, without any distinction. And they are white when I am certain and  believe that they please God.  Then shall the head of my soul never  lack the ointment of a joyful conscience.    So Christ says, John viii: \"I do always those things that please Him.\"  And St. John says, I. John iii: \"Hereby we know that we are of the  truth, if we can comfort our hearts before Him and have a good  confidence. And if our heart condemns or frets us, God is greater than  our heart, and we have confidence, that whatsoever we ask, we shall  receive of Him, because we keep His Commandments, and do those things  that are pleasing in His sight.\" Again: \"Whosoever is born of God, that  is, whoever believes and trusts God, doth not commit sin, and cannot  sin.\" Again, Psalm xxxiv: \"None of them that trust in Him shall do  sin.\" And in Psalm ii: \"Blessed are all they that put their trust in  Him.\" If this be true, then all that they do must be good, or the evil  that they do must be quickly forgiven. Behold, then, why I exalt faith  so greatly, draw all works into it, and reject all works which do not  flow from it.    IV. Now every one can note and tell for himself when he does what is  good or what is not good; for if he finds his heart confident that it  pleases God, the work is good, even if it were so small a thing as  picking up a straw. If confidence is absent, or if he doubts, the work  is not good, although it should raise all the dead and the man should  give himself to be burned. This is the teaching of St. Paul, Romans  xiv: \"Whatsoever is not done of or in faith is sin.\" Faith, as the  chief work, and no other work, has given us the name of \"believers on  Christ.\" For all other works a heathen, a Jew, a Turk, a sinner, may  also do; but to trust firmly that he pleases God, is possible only for  a Christian who is enlightened and strengthened by grace.    That these words seem strange, and that some call me a heretic because  of them, is due to the fact that men have followed blind reason and  heathen ways, have set faith not above, but beside other virtues, and  have given it a work of its own, apart from all works of the other  virtues; although faith alone makes all other works good, acceptable  and worthy, in that it trusts God and does not doubt that for it all  things that a man does are well done. Indeed, they have not let faith  remain a work, but have made a habitus of it, as they say, although  Scripture gives the name of a good, divine work to no work except to  faith alone.  Therefore it is no wonder that they have become blind and  leaders of the blind. And this faith brings with it at once love,  peace, joy and hope. For God gives His Spirit at once to him who trusts  Him, as St. Paul says to the Galatians: \"You received the Spirit not  because of your good works, but when you believed the Word of God.\"    V. In this faith all works become equal, and one is like the other; all  distinctions between works fall away, whether they be great, small,  short, long, few or many. For the works are acceptable not for their  own sake, but because of the faith which alone is, works and lives in  each and every work without distinction, however numerous and various  they are, just as all the members of the body live, work and have their  name from the head, and without the head no member can live, work and  have a name.    From which it further follows that a Christian who lives in this faith  has no need of a teacher of good works, but whatever he finds to do he  does, and all is well done; as Samuel said to Saul: \"The Spirit of the  Lord will come upon thee, and thou shalt be turned into another man;  then do thou as occasion serves thee; for God is with thee.\" So also we  read of St. Anna, Samuel's mother: \"When she believed the priest Eli  who promised her God's grace, she went home in joy and peace, and from  that time no more turned hither and thither,\" that is, whatever  occurred, it was all one to her. St. Paul also says: \"Where the Spirit  of Christ is, there all is free.\" For faith does not permit itself to  be bound to any work, nor does it allow any work to be taken from it,  but, as the First Psalm says, \"He bringeth forth his fruit in his  season,\" that is, as a matter of course.    VI. This we may see in a common human example. When a man and a woman  love and are pleased with each other, and thoroughly believe in their  love, who teaches them how they are to behave, what they are to do,  leave undone, say, not say, think?  Confidence alone teaches them all  this, and more. They make no difference in works: they do the great,  the long, the much, as gladly as the small, the short, the little, and  vice versa; and that too with joyful, peaceful, confident hearts, and  each is a free companion of the other. But where there is a doubt,  search is made for what is best; then a distinction of works is  imagined whereby a man may win favor; and yet he goes about it with a  heavy heart, and great disrelish; he is, as it were, taken captive,  more than half in despair, and often makes a fool of himself.    So a Christian who lives in this confidence toward God, a knows all  things, can do all things, undertakes all things that are to be done,  and does everything cheerfully and freely; not that he may gather many  merits and good works, but because it is a pleasure for him to please  God thereby, and he serves God purely for nothing, content that his  service pleases God. On the other hand, he who is not at one with God,  or doubts, hunts and worries in what way he may do enough and with many  works move God. He runs to St. James of Compostella, to Rome, to  Jerusalem, hither and yon, prays St. Bridget's prayer and the rest,  fasts on this day and on that, makes confession here, and makes  confession there, questions this man and that, and yet finds no peace.  He does all this with great effort, despair and disrelish of heart, so  that the Scriptures rightly call such works in Hebrew Avenama, that is,  labor and travail. And even then they are not good works, and are all  lost. Many have been crazed thereby; their fear has brought them into  all manner of misery. Of these it is written, Wisdom of Solomon v: \"We  have wearied ourselves in the wrong way;"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/419"],[0,"The Magic of Oz (#4)"],[1,"to get  the best of him in some way, and he resolved to keep a close watch on  his fellow-conspirator.  As long as he kept to himself the secret word  of the transformations, Ruggedo would not dare to harm him, and he  promised himself that as soon as they had conquered Oz, he would  transform the old Nome into a marble statue and keep him in that form  forever.    Ruggedo, on his part, decided that he could, by careful watching and  listening, surprise the boy's secret, and when he had learned the magic  word he would transform Kiki Aru into a bundle of faggots and burn him  up and so be rid of him.    This is always the way with wicked people.  They cannot be trusted even  by one another.  Ruggedo thought he was fooling Kiki, and Kiki thought  he was fooling Ruggedo; so both were pleased.    \"It's a long way across the Desert,\" remarked the boy, \"and the sands  are hot and send up poisonous vapors.  Let us wait until evening and  then fly across in the night when it will be cooler.\"    The former Nome King agreed to this, and the two spent the rest of that  day in talking over their plans.  When evening came they paid the  inn-keeper and walked out to a little grove of trees that stood near by.    \"Remain here for a few minutes and I'll soon be back,\" said Kiki, and  walking swiftly away, he left the Nome standing in the grove.  Ruggedo  wondered where he had gone, but stood quietly in his place until, all  of a sudden, his form changed to that of a great eagle, and he uttered  a piercing cry of astonishment and flapped his wings in a sort of  panic.  At once his eagle cry was answered from beyond the grove, and  another eagle, even larger and more powerful than the transformed  Ruggedo, came sailing through the trees and alighted beside him.    \"Now we are ready for the start,\" said the voice of Kiki, coming from  the eagle.    Ruggedo realized that this time he had been outwitted.  He had thought  Kiki would utter the magic word in his presence, and so he would learn  what it was, but the boy had been too shrewd for that.    As the two eagles mounted high into the air and began their flight  across the great Desert that separates the Land of Oz from all the rest  of the world, the Nome said:    \"When I was King of the Nomes I had a magic way of working  transformations that I thought was good, but it could not compare with  your secret word.  I had to have certain tools and make passes and say  a lot of mystic words before I could transform anybody.\"    \"What became of your magic tools?\" inquired Kiki.    \"The Oz people took them all away from me--that horrid girl, Dorothy,  and that terrible fairy, Ozma, the Ruler of Oz--at the time they took  away my underground kingdom and kicked me upstairs into the cold,  heartless world.\"    \"Why did you let them do that?\" asked the boy.    \"Well,\" said Ruggedo, \"I couldn't help it.  They rolled eggs at  me--EGGS--dreadful eggs!--and if an egg even touches a Nome, he is  ruined for life.\"    \"Is any kind of an egg dangerous to a Nome?\"    \"Any kind and every kind.  An egg is the only thing I'm afraid of.\"          5.  A Happy Corner of Oz      There is no other country so beautiful as the Land of Oz.  There are no  other people so happy and contented and prosperous as the Oz people.  They have all they desire; they love and admire their beautiful girl  Ruler, Ozma of Oz, and they mix work and play so justly that both are  delightful and satisfying and no one has any reason to complain.  Once  in a while something happens in Oz to disturb the people's happiness  for a brief time, for so rich and attractive a fairyland is sure to  make a few selfish and greedy outsiders envious, and therefore certain  evil-doers have treacherously plotted to conquer Oz and enslave its  people and destroy its girl Ruler, and so gain the wealth of Oz for  themselves.  But up to the time when the cruel and crafty Nome,  Ruggedo, conspired with Kiki Aru, the Hyup, all such attempts had  failed.  The Oz people suspected no danger.  Life in the world's nicest  fairyland was one round of joyous, happy days.    In the center of the Emerald City of Oz, the capital city of Ozma's  dominions, is a vast and beautiful garden, surrounded by a wall inlaid  with shining emeralds, and in the center of this garden stands Ozma's  Royal Palace, the most splendid building ever constructed.  From a  hundred towers and domes floated the banners of Oz, which included the  Ozmies, the Munchkins, the Gillikins, the Winkies and the Quadlings.  The banner of the Munchkins is blue, that of the Winkies yellow; the  Gillikin banner is purple, and the Quadling's banner is red.  The  colors of the Emerald City are of course green.  Ozma's own banner has  a green center, and is divided into four quarters.  These quarters are  colored blue, purple, yellow and red, indicating that she rules over  all the countries of the Land of Oz.    This fairyland is so big, however, that all of it is not yet known to  its girl Ruler, and it is said that in some far parts of the country,  in forests and mountain fastnesses, in hidden valleys and thick  jungles, are people and beasts that know as little about Ozma as she  knows of them.  Still, these unknown subjects are not nearly so  numerous as the known inhabitants of Oz, who occupy all the countries  near to the Emerald City.  Indeed, I'm sure it will not be long until  all parts of the fairyland of Oz are explored and their peoples made  acquainted with their Ruler, for in Ozma's palace are several of her  friends who are so curious that they are constantly discovering new and  extraordinary places and inhabitants.    One of the most frequent discoverers of these hidden places in Oz is a  little Kansas girl named Dorothy, who is Ozma's dearest friend and  lives in luxurious rooms in the Royal Palace.  Dorothy is, indeed, a  Princess of Oz, but she does not like to be called a princess, and  because she is simple and sweet and does not pretend to be anything but  an ordinary little girl, she is called just \"Dorothy\" by everybody and  is the most popular person, next to Ozma, in all the Land of Oz.    One morning Dorothy crossed the hall of the palace and knocked on the  door of another girl named Trot, also a guest and friend of Ozma.  When  told to enter, Dorothy found that Trot had company, an old sailor-man  with one wooden leg and one meat leg, who was sitting by the open  window puffing smoke from a corn-cob pipe.  This sailor-man was named  Cap'n Bill, and he had accompanied Trot to the Land of Oz and was her  oldest and most faithful comrade and friend.  Dorothy liked Cap'n Bill,  too, and after she had greeted him, she said to Trot:    \"You know, Ozma's birthday is next month, and I've been wondering what  I can give here as a birthday present.  She's so good to us all that we  certainly ought to remember her birthday.\"    \"That's true,\" agreed Trot.  \"I've been wondering, too, what I could  give Ozma.  It's pretty hard to decide, 'cause she's got already all  she wants, and as she's a fairy and knows a lot about magic, she could  satisfy any wish.\"    \"I know,\" returned Dorothy, \"but that isn't the point.  It isn't that  Ozma NEEDS anything, but that it will please her to know we've  remembered her birthday.  But what shall we give her?\"    Trot shook her head in despair.    \"I've tried to think and I can't,\" she declared.    \"It's the same way with me,\" said Dorothy.    \"I know one thing that 'ud please her,\" remarked Cap'n Bill, turning  his round face with its fringe of whiskers toward the two girls and  staring at them with his big, light-blue eyes wide open.    \"What is it, Cap'n Bill?\"    \"It's an Enchanted Flower,\" said he.  \"It's a pretty plant that stands  in a golden flower-pot an' grows all sorts o' flowers, one after  another.  One minute a fine rose buds an' blooms, an' then a tulip, an'  next a chrys--chrys--\"    \"--anthemum,\" said Dorothy, helping him.    \"That's it; and next a dahlia, an' then a daffydil, an' on all through  the range o' posies.  Jus' as soon as one fades away, another comes, of  a different sort, an' the perfume from 'em is mighty snifty, an' they  keeps bloomin' night and day, year in an' year out.\"    \"That's wonderful!\" exclaimed Dorothy.  \"I think Ozma would like it.\"    \"But where is the Magic Flower, and how can we get it?\" asked Trot.    \"Dun'no, zac'ly,\" slowly replied Cap'n Bill.  \"The Glass Cat tol' me  about it only yesterday, an' said it was in some lonely place up at the  nor'east o' here.  The Glass Cat goes travelin' all around Oz, you  know, an' the little critter sees a lot o' things no one else does.\"    \"That's true,\" said Dorothy, thoughtfully.  \"Northeast of here must be  in the Munchkin Country, and perhaps a good way off, so let's ask the  Glass Cat to tell us how to get to the Magic Flower.\"    So the two girls, with Cap'n Bill stumping along on his wooden leg  after them, went out into the garden, and after some time spent in  searching, they found the Glass Cat curled up in the sunshine beside a  bush, fast sleep.    The Glass Cat is one of the most curious creatures in all Oz.  It was  made by a famous magician named Dr. Pipt before Ozma had forbidden her  subjects to work magic.  Dr. Pipt had made the Glass Cat to catch mice,  but the Cat refused to catch mice and was considered more curious than  useful.    This astonished cat was made all of glass and was so clear and  transparent that you could see through it as easily as through a  window.  In the top of its head, however, was a mass of delicate pink  balls which looked like jewels but were intended for brains.  It had a  heart made of blood-red ruby.  The eyes were two large emeralds.  But,  aside from these colors, all the rest of the animal was of clear glass,  and it had a spun-glass tail that was really beautiful.    \"Here, wake up,\"  said Cap'n Bill.  \"We want to talk to you.\"    Slowly the Glass Cat got upon its feed, yawned and then looked at "]]]
