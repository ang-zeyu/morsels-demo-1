Now, Jane, get a large basket, and put in it lots of bread, and bacon--  the men who are working will want something; fill the largest stone jar  with beer; put in a bottle of brandy and a bottle of milk, and set to  and get some soup ready; bring three small mattresses downstairs and a  lot of blankets.\"    Five minutes later the search-party started, Mr Humphreys and the guide  leading the way; the men followed, one carrying five shovels; another,  the basket and jar; the other two, three hurdles on which were placed  the mattresses and blankets.    It was no easy matter so laden making their way over the hills and  through the deep drifts.  Mr Humphreys took his share of the labour;  but it was two hours from the time when they started before they arrived  at the spot where the flag was waving, and the night was already closing  in.    Mr Humphreys hurried forward to the flag; he knelt down beside it.    \"Are you still alive, Dick?--it is I, your father!\"    \"Yes, father, we are all alive, and we shall be all right now you have  come.  Don't get too near the stick; we are afraid of the hole closing  up, and smothering us.\"    \"Which side is the door,\" Mr Humphreys asked, \"so that we can dig that  way?\"    \"There is no door, father; but you had better dig from below, because of  the wall.\"    \"There must be a door,\" Mr Humphreys said to himself, as he rejoined  the men.  \"There can't be a hut without a door; Dick must be a little  lightheaded, and no wonder.  Now, lads, let us set to work from below.\"    The five men were soon at work, throwing aside the snow.  In a short  time the other parties arrived.    Mr Humphreys had brought with him a stock of candles.  These were lit  and stuck in the snow, where, as there was no wind, they burnt steadily,  affording sufficient light for the search.  The work was all the more  difficult from the lightness of the snow, as the sides fell in like sand  as they worked upon it, and they were obliged to make a very broad  cutting.    At last there was a cheer, as they struck the ground.    \"Now, working up hill we must be at the hut in a few feet.\"    Twenty willing hands laboured away incessantly, but to their surprise no  hut was met with; they worked and worked, throwing the snow behind them,  until Mr Jackson struck his shovel upon something hard.    \"Here is a wall or something,\" he said.    Another minute uncovered a low wall of two feet in height, and directly  afterwards a leg was popped up through the snow.  A loud cheer broke  from the men.    But again the snow-drift fell in from the sides, and it was another  quarter of an hour before the lads were lifted from the narrow shelter  where they had for five days lain.    The Jacksons were too weak to stand, but Dick was just able to keep on  his feet.  A cup of milk mixed with some brandy was given to each.  Then  Dick in a few words told the story, and the surprise of all, as they  examined the little hut and heard the details of the almost miraculous  preservation of the boys, was almost unbounded.    They were now wrapped in blankets and laid on mattresses placed on the  hurdles; the contents of the baskets--for others besides Mr Humphreys  had brought a stock of provisions, not knowing how long the search-party  might be engaged--were distributed among the workers, and then four men  lifted each hurdle and the party started for home, a messenger having  been sent back at full speed directly the boys were got out, to bear the  glad news to Castleton.    It was just midnight when the main body returned.  A second cup of  brandy and milk had done much to revive the two elder boys, and Dick had  been able to eat a piece of bread.  James, however, had fallen asleep  directly he was wrapped in the blankets, and did not awake until he was  set down at his father's door.    At both houses doctors were in waiting for their arrival.  Dick was at  once pronounced to be none the worse for his adventure, except that his  feet were frost-bitten from long contact with the snow; indeed had it  not been from this cause he could, on the following day, have been up  and about.  As it was, in a fortnight, he was perfectly himself again.    Tom Jackson was confined to the house for many weeks; he lost several of  his toes, but eventually became strong and hearty again.  James,  however, never recovered--the shock to his system had been too great; he  lingered on for some months, and then sank quietly and painlessly.    The events of the snow-storm left a far deeper trace upon Mrs Humphreys  than upon her son.  The terrible anxiety of those five days had told  greatly upon her, and after they were over she seemed to lose strength  rapidly.  She had never been very strong, and a hacking cough now  constantly shook her.  The doctor who attended her looked serious, and  one day said to Mr Humphreys--    \"I don't like the state of your wife; she has always been weak in her  lungs, and I fear that the anxiety she went through has somehow  accentuated her former tendency to consumption.  The air of this place--  you see she was born in the south--is too keen for her.  If I were you I  would take her up to London and consult some first-rate man in lung  diseases, and get his opinion.\"    The next day Mr Humphreys started for London.  The celebrated physician  examined his wife, and afterwards took him aside.    \"I cannot conceal from you,\" he said, \"that your wife's lungs are very  seriously affected, although consumption has not yet thoroughly set in.  If she remains in this country she may not live many months; your only  hope is to take her abroad--could you do that?\"    \"Yes, sir,\" Mr Humphreys said.  \"I can take her anywhere.  Where would  you advise?\"    \"She would benefit from a residence either in Egypt or Madeira,\" the  doctor said; \"but for a permanency I should say the Cape.  I have known  many complete cures made there.  You tell me that you are engaged in  agricultural pursuits; if it is possible for you to settle there, I can  give you every hope of saving her life, as the disease is not yet  developed.  If you go, don't stay in the lowlands, but get up into the  high plateaus, either behind the Cape itself, or behind Natal.  The  climate there is delicious, and land cheap.\"    Mr Humphreys thanked him and left, returning the next day to Castleton.  The astonishment of the boys, and indeed of Mrs Humphreys, was  unbounded, when the farmer announced in the evening at supper that he  intended to sell his land and emigrate at once to the Cape.    The boys were full of excitement at the new and strange idea, and asked  numerous questions, none of which the farmer could answer; but he  brought out a pile of books, which he had purchased in town, concerning  the colonies and their resources, and for once Dick's aversion to books  vanished, and he was soon as much absorbed as his brother in the perusal  of the accounts of the new land to which they were to go.    On the following Saturday, to the surprise of all Castleton, an  advertisement appeared in the Derbyshire paper announcing the sale by  auction at an early date of Mr Humphreys' farm.    Dick and John were quite heroes among their companions, who looked with  envy at boys who were going to live in a land where lions and elephants  and all sorts of wild beasts abounded, to say nothing of warlike  natives.    \"There always seem to be Kaffir wars going on,\" one boy said, \"out at  the Cape; you will have all sorts of excitement, Dick.\"    \"I don't think that sort of excitement will be nice,\" Dick replied; \"it  must be horribly anxious work to think every time you go out to work  that the place may be attacked and every one killed before you get back.  But that is all nonsense, you know; I have been reading about some of  the Kaffir wars; they are in the bush-country, down by the sea.  We are  going up on to the high lands at the back of Natal.  Father says very  likely we may buy a farm in the Transvaal, but mother does not seem to  like the accounts of the Dutchmen or Boers, as they are called, who live  there, and says she would rather have English neighbours; so I expect if  we can get a farm somewhere in the Natal colony, we shall do so.\"    \"You seem to know all about the place,\" the boy said, surprised.    \"Well, we have had seven or eight books to read about it, and I seem now  to know more about South Africa than about any other country in the  world.  There are the diamond-fields, too, out there, and I hope, before  I settle down regularly to a farm, that father will let me go for a few  months and try my luck there.  Would it not just be jolly to find a  diamond as big as a pigeon's egg and worth about twenty thousand  pounds?\"    \"And do they do that?\" the boy asked.    \"Well, they don't often find them as big as that; still, one might be  the lucky one.\"    The news that Mr Humphreys and his family were about to sell off and  emigrate naturally caused a great deal of talk in and around Castleton,  and put the idea into the minds of many who had never before seriously  thought of it.  If Mr Humphreys, who had one of the best farms in the  neighbourhood, thought that it would pay him to sell his land and go  out, it would surely be a good thing for others to do the same.  He was  considered to be a good farmer and a long-headed man; one who would not  take such a step without carefully looking into the matter--for Mr  Humphreys, in order to avoid questioning and the constant inquiries  about his wife's health, which would be made, did he announce that he  was leaving for that reason, did not think it necessary to inform people  that it was in the hopes of staving off the danger which threatened her  that he was making a move.    A great many of the neighbouring labourers would gladly have gone with  him; but he found by his reading that Kaffir labour was to be obtained  out there very cheaply."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32947"],[0,"On Snake-Poison: Its Action and Its Antidote (#4)"],[1,"this gland, is a thin, albuminoid, yellow liquid of neutral  reaction. On exposure to the air it becomes viscid and slightly acid. Of  its chemical composition we know as yet but little, and it is very  questionable whether the most perfect chemical analysis of its  constituents would ever have given us a clue to its action or will  enrich our present knowledge of it. Like all albuminoid secreta it  becomes putrid after prolonged exposure and then, through ammonia  production, loses its acid, and assumes an alkaline reaction, still,  however, though in a modified degree, retaining its toxic properties,  which are completely lost only after an exposure of many months.  Feoktistow found that freezing at 1 deg. R. caused the poison to separate  into a solid mass and a thin, very yellow liquid, which, even at a  temperature of 4 deg. R., remained liquid, and the poisonous properties of  which greatly exceeded those of the solid mass. Boiling diminishes and,  continued for any length of time, completely destroys the potency of the  poison.    The microscope has done good service in the investigation of  snake-poison. It has, in the first place, informed us with absolute  certainty that there are no micro-organisms or germs of any kind in the  fresh poison immediately after it leaves the gland. But a still more  important revelation we owe to it is the fact that these organisms, when  we introduce them into a 2% solution of the poison, do not die, but  live, multiply, and enjoy their existence most lustily, as they do in  any other non-poisonous albuminoid liquid, whilst animals of a higher  type--say a snail or a frog--soon perish in it. In watching the  movements of the latter we find that they get slower and slower, and  finally cease. We now follow up the interesting research, and take two  frogs. Under the skin of one of them we inject a few drops of the poison  solution, the other one for comparison we leave intact, and place both  into a glass globe partly filled with water. In a very short time we  have no difficulty to identify the poisoned frog. Its hind legs begin to  drop and their movements become sluggish. This difficulty increases from  minute to minute, until at last all motion ceases, and the legs hang  down completely paralysed. At the same time we observe that the animal  shows increasing difficulty of breathing, that, even when taken out of  the water, and placed on the table before us it gasps for breath and is  unable to move. At last respiration ceases altogether and the frog dies.    Two problems now present themselves for solution. In the first place we  have to account for the fact of the snake-poison leaving the lower forms  of animal life intact and being fatal to the higher ones. The symptoms  we have observed in the frog point unmistakably to an affection of the  nervous system as their cause. Now we know that the lower forms which  the poison does not affect have no such system, and we are justified to  infer that to the absence of this system they owe their immunity. This  inference leads us on to a second one equally justifiable, namely, that  there is a certain unaccountable attraction between the delicate nerve  tissue and the subtle ophidian poison, which renders the latter a  specific nerve poison.    Our second problem is to ascertain the nature of the change in the  nerves, to find out, if possible, whether it is merely functional or an  actual interference with the structure of either cells or fibres. With  this end in view we once more consult the microscope. We make two  preparations, one of nerve fibres and of nerve cells of the poisoned  frog, and, under the microscope, compare them carefully with an  analogous one from the killed healthy frog. The result is purely  negative as regards structural change. Both present identical and  perfectly normal pictures of apparently healthy cells and fibres. There  being no visible structural change we are driven to the conclusion that  only a functional one has been effected by the poison, and with the  symptoms observed all pointing in that direction, that it is of central  origin.    The writer's theory as to the action of snake-poison, formed, in the  first instance from observations made at the bedside of his patients  only, is thus confirmed by experiments specially instituted by him for  that purpose. Further proof of its correctness we have in the brilliant  results of the strychnine treatment of snakebite in Australia, which is  the outcome and practical application of this theory. In those desperate  cases more especially, reported from all parts of the colonies, in which  death was imminent, and pulse at wrists as well as respiration had  already ceased, the strychnine injections could not possibly have  effected complete recovery within a few hours if the structure of the  nerve centres had been impaired or blood changes brought about  incompatible with life.    Feoktistow's experiments, made with viper poison, fully bear out the  correctness of the writer's theory, besides proving that there is no  essential difference between the action of the viperine and colubrine  poisons. He proved conclusively that snake-poison does not destroy  protoplasm or interfere with infusorial life, that injected into the  heart of a mollusc it causes an almost immediate cessation of its  action, that hypodermic injections of it in fish produce contraction of  the pigment cells and bleaching of the integuments, followed by  asphyxial respiration, general paralysis and death. Similar results were  observed on frogs. In mammals the symptoms were: dyspnoea, asphyxia,  paresis and paralysis of the lower extremities with succeeding general  paralysis, sometimes tonic and clonic convulsions, haemorrhages from  bowels, lungs, nose and bladder, and finally complete paralysis of  respiration and of heart.          Action of Snake-Poison on Special Nerve Centres.      It must be borne in mind that the symptoms as about to be detailed are  successive only to some extent in the order presented. They commence  generally at the lower part of the spinal cord, but immediately  afterwards, if not simultaneously, are ushered in with great rapidity  from other centres, masking each other and rendering it extremely  difficult to observe and analyse them separately. They are also very  variable through the poison concentrating its action on special centres,  leaving others comparatively intact, and this not only when from  different varieties of snakes, but also from snakes of the same variety.  Another element increasing the difficulties of correct analysis are the  depressing effects of fear, inseparable in all but the strongest minds  from the consciousness of having been bitten, and so similar in  appearance to those of snake-poison, that sometimes it is by no means  easy to decide which of the two is in operation, and that only those  cases are of real value to the observer from which this element of fear  is completely excluded.      A.--Action on the Anterior Cornua of the Spinal Cord.    The anterior cornua are almost invariably the first of the motor-centres  attacked by the snake-poison, the affection (commencing with paresis and  in serious cases generally culminating in paralysis) beginning in the  lumbar ganglia and taking an upward course. The lower extremities feel  unnaturally heavy and a paretic condition of the muscles supervenes  _simultaneously on both sides_. The walk becomes unsteady and  staggering, very similar to that of persons under the influence of large  doses of alcohol. By a powerful effort of the will, however, persons in  this condition are often able to walk and even run for some distance,  especially if by prompt ligature the absorption of the poison has been  checked. As the affection proceeds, though still able to move the legs  in a sitting posture, they are unable to rise again. Ere long even  sitting up becomes impossible and they collapse helplessly. At this  stage sensation is still intact, and reflex action, by pricking the  skin, &c., still takes place. The upper extremities generally retain the  power of voluntary motion, even after the muscles of the neck have  become paretic and the head is held up with difficulty or sinks to one  side.    With birds, according to Feoktistow, the reverse is the case. The wings  are usually first attacked, or paresis comes on in wings and legs at the  same time.      B.--Action on the Medulla Oblongata.    a.--The Vaso-Motor Centre.    Whilst the voluntary muscles are thus brought under the influence of the  poison, symptoms denoting the invasion of the oblongata are rapidly  developing. The first of these is the deadly pallor and ashy hue of the  cold skin, evidently due to the blood receding from the surface, a  condition not unlike that obtaining in extreme anaemia. As persons in  this state complain of an agonising feeling about the heart and of  deadly faintness, a paretic condition of the heart suggests itself as  the most obvious cause, more especially when taken in conjunction with  the small, frequent, and compressible pulse. But though the heart muscle  is no doubt participating in the general paresis, the condition of the  surface of the body is in reality one of anaemia. The blood, even at this  early stage, begins to accumulate in the large veins of the abdomen,  which expand gradually in consequence of the diminishing motor force  supplied by the splanchnicus, keeping them in the normal state of  contraction when intact and having its centre in the medulla oblongata.  When this large vaso-motor nerve is cut in animals anywhere in its  course, the veins of the abdomen become distended enormously. The animal  is, so to say, bled into its own belly.    By a series of most interesting experiments Feoktistow has shown  conclusively that snake-poison has the same effect on the abdominal  circulation as section of the splanchnicus. Even slight intravenous  injections of"]]]
