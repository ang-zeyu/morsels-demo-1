Frequently a minute  hole will be observed upon the entrance, and within an inch beneath the  skin a large aperture will be seen where an explosion appears to have  taken place by the breaking-up of the lead, all of which has splashed  into fragments scattering in every direction.    Common sense will suggest that although such a bullet will kill, it is  not the sort of weapon to stop a dangerous animal when in full charge.  Weak men generally prefer the hollow Express because the rifle is  lighter and handier than the more formidable weapon, and the recoil is  not so severe, owing to the lightness of the bullet.    My opinion may be expressed in a few words. If you wish the bullet to  expand, use soft lead, but keep the metal solid. If you wish for great  penetration, use hard solid metal, either 1/10 tin or 1/13 quicksilver.  Even this will alter its form against the bones of a buffalo, but either  of the above will go clean through a wapiti stag, and would kill another  beyond it should the rifle be '577 fired with 6 drams of powder.    The same rifle will not drive a soft leaden solid bullet through a male  tiger if struck directly through the shoulder; it will be found  flattened to a mushroom form beneath the skin upon the other side,  having performed its duty effectively, by killing the tiger upon the  spot, and retaining intact the metal of which it was composed.    A post-mortem inquiry in the latter case would be most satisfactory. If  the bullet shall have struck fair upon the shoulder-joint, it will be  observed that although it has retained its substance, the momentum has  been conveyed to every fragment of crushed bone, which will have been  driven forward through the lungs like a charge of buckshot, in addition  to the havoc created by the large diameter of an expanded '577 bullet.  Both shoulders will have been completely crushed, and the animal must of  course be rendered absolutely helpless. This is a sine qua non in all  shooting. Do not wound, but kill outright; and this you will generally  do with a '577 solid bullet of pure lead, or with a Paradox bullet 1 3/4  ounces hard metal and 4 1/2 drams of powder. This very large bullet is  sufficiently formidable to require no expansion.    Gunmakers will not advise the use of pure lead for bullets, as it is apt  to foul the barrel by its extreme softness, which leaves a coating of  the metal upon the surface of the rifling. For military purposes this  objection would hold good, but so few shots are fired at game during the  day, that no disadvantage could accrue, and the rifle would of course be  cleaned every evening.    The accidents which unfortunately so often happen to the hunters of  dangerous game may generally be traced to the defect in the rifles  employed. If a shooter wishes to amuse himself in Scotland among the  harmless red deer, let him try any experiments that may please him; but  if he is a man like so many who leave the shores of Great Britain for  the wild jungles of the East, or of Africa, let him at once abjure  hollow bullets if he seeks dangerous game. Upon this subject I press my  opinion, as I feel the immense responsibility of advice should any  calamity occur. It is only a few months since the lamented Mr. Ingram  was killed by an elephant in the Somali country, through using a '450  Express hollow bullet against an animal that should at least have been  attacked with a No. 10. I submit the question to any admirer of the  hollow Express. \"If he is on foot, trusting only to his rifle for  protection, would he select a hollow Express, no matter whether '577,  '500, or '450; or would he prefer a solid bullet to withstand a  dangerous charge?\"    India is a vast empire, and various portions, according to the  conditions of localities, have peculiar customs for the conduct of wild  sports. In dense jungles, where it would be impossible to see the game  if on foot, there is no other way of obtaining a shot except by driving.  The gunners are in such case placed at suitable intervals upon platforms  called mucharns, securely fitted between convenient forks among the  branches of a tree, about 10 or 12 feet above the ground. From this  point of vantage the gunner can see without being seen and, thoroughly  protected from all danger, he may amuse himself by comparing the success  of his shooting with the hollow Express or with the solid bullet at the  animals that pass within his range, which means a limit of about 50  yards. I contend that at the short distance named; a tiger should NEVER  escape from a solid bullet; he often escapes from the hollow bullet for  several reasons.    It must be remembered that animals are rarely seen distinctly in a thick  jungle, countless twigs and foliage intercept the bullet, and the view,  although patent to both open eyes, becomes misty and obscure when you  shut one eye and squint along the barrel. You then discover that  although you can see the dim shadow of your game, your bullet will have  to cut its way through at least twenty twigs before it can reach its  goal. A solid bullet may deflect slightly, but it will generally deliver  its message direct, unless the opposing objects are more formidable than  ordinary small branches. A hollow bullet from an Express rifle will fly  into fragments should it strike a twig the size of the little finger.  This is quite sufficient to condemn the hollow projectile without any  further argument.    While writing the above, I have received the Pioneer, 24th June 1888,  which gives the following account of an escape from a tiger a few weeks  ago by Mr. Cuthbert Fraser, and no better example could be offered to  prove the danger of a hollow bullet. It will be seen that a solid bullet  would have killed the tiger on the spot, as it would have penetrated to  the brain, instead of which it broke into the usual fragments when  striking the hard substance of the teeth, and merely destroyed one eye.  The bullet evidently splashed up without breaking the jaw, as the  wounded animal was not only capable of killing the orderly, but Mr.  Fraser \"heard, in fact, the crunching of the man's bones.\" He says \"that  he felt that he had the tiger dead when he fired, but the Express bullet  unfortunately broke up.\" He had fired the left-hand barrel into the  tiger's chest without the slightest result in checking the onset; had  that been a solid bullet it would have penetrated to the heart or lungs.    ADVENTURE WITH A TIGER.    The following experience of a sportsman in the Deccan is from the  Secunderabad paper of 14th June 1888:--        \"Mr. Cuthbert Fraser had a most miraculous escape from a      tiger the other day at Amraoti. The lucky hero of this      adventure is a District Superintendent of Police in Berar.      He is well remembered in Secunderabad as Superintendent of      the Cantonment Police before Mr. Crawford. A son of Colonel      Hastings Fraser, one of the Frasers of Lovat, he has proved      his possession of that nerve and courage which rises to the      emergency of danger--on which qualities more than all else      the British Empire in India has been built, and on which,      after all is said, in the last resort, it must be still held      to rest. To quote the graphic account of a correspondent,      the escape was about as narrow as was ever had. Mr. Fraser      was told by his orderly that the tiger was lying dead with      his head on the root of a tree. The orderly having called      him up, he went to the spot. Mr. Fraser then sent the      orderly and another man with the second gun back, and knelt      down to look. Just then the tiger roared and came at him      from about eighteen feet off: he waited till the tiger was      within five feet of him and fired. As the tiger did not      drop, he fired his second shot hurriedly. The first shot had      hit exactly in the centre of the face but just an inch too      low. It knocked the tiger's right eye out and smashed all      the teeth of that side of the jaw. The second shot struck      the tiger in the chest, but too low. What happened then Mr.      Fraser does not exactly know, but he next found himself      lying in front of the tiger, one claw of the beast's right      foot being hooked into his left leg, in this way trying to      draw Mr. Fraser towards him; the other paw was on his right      leg. Mr. Fraser's chin and coat were covered with foam from      the beast's mouth. He tried hard to draw himself out of the      tiger's clutches. Fortunately the beast was not able to see      him, as Mr. Fraser was a little to one side on the animal's      blind side and the tiger's head was up. Suddenly seeing Mr.      Fraser's orderly bolting, he jumped up and went for the man,      and catching him he killed him on the spot. Mr. Fraser had      lost his hat, rifle, and all his cartridges, which had      tumbled out of his pocket. He jumped up, however, and ran to      the man who had his second gun, and to do so had to go      within eight paces of the spot where the tiger was crouching      over his orderly. He heard, in fact, the crunching of the      man's bones and saw the tiger biting the back of the head.      He now took the gun from his man. The latter said that he      had fired both barrels into the tiger--one when he was      crouching over Mr. Fraser, and the other when he was over      the prostrate body of the orderly. The man had fired well      and true, but just too far back, in his anxiety not to hit      the man he would save, instead of the tiger. When afterwards      asked if he was not afraid to hit the Sahib, 'I was very      much afraid"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36669"],[0,"Knitting, Crochet, and Netting, with Twelve Illustrations (#4)"],[1,"on each of 2 pins,     and 20 on the 3rd._    1st round--Knit 2, purl 2, for 20 rounds.    21st round--Plain.    22nd round--Purl 1, knit 3.    23rd round--Plain.    24th round--Knit 2, purl 1, knit 1.
