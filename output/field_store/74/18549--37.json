During those thousands of years the red man, in spite of his Arctic  handicap, by no means showed himself wholly lacking in originality and  inventive ability. In Yucatan two or three thousand years ago the Mayas  were such good scientists and recorded their observations of the stars  so accurately that they framed a calendar more exact than any except  the one that we have used for the last two centuries. They showed still  greater powers of mind in inventing the art of writing and in their  architecture. Later we shall depict the environment under which these  things occurred; it is enough to suggest in passing that perhaps at this  period the ancestors of the Indians had capacities as great as those of  any people. Today they might possibly hold their own against the white  man, were it not for the great handicap which they once suffered because  Asia approaches America only in the cold, depressing north.    The Indians were not the only primitive people who were driven from  central Asia by aridity. Another group pushed westward toward Europe.  They fared far better than their Indian cousins who went to the  northeast. These prospective Europeans never encountered benumbing  physical conditions like those of northeastern Asia and northwestern  America. Even when ice shrouded the northern part of Europe, the rest of  the continent was apparently favored with a stimulating climate. Then  as now, Europe was probably one of the regions where storms are most  frequent. Hence it was free from the monotony which is so deadly in  other regions. When the ice retreated our European ancestors doubtless  followed slowly in its wake. Thus their racial character was evolved in  one of the world's most stimulating regions. Privation they must have  suffered, and hardihood and boldness were absolutely essential in the  combat with storms, cold, wild beasts, fierce winds, and raging waves.  But under the spur of constant variety and change, these difficulties  were merely incentives to progress. When the time came for the people of  the west of Europe to cross to America, they were of a different caliber  from the previous immigrants.    Two facts of physical geography brought Europe into contact with  America. One of these was the islands of the North, the other the  trade-winds of the South. Each seems to have caused a preliminary  contact which failed to produce important results. As in the northern  Pacific, so in the northern Atlantic, islands are stepping-stones from  the Old World to the New. Yet because in the latter case the islands are  far apart, it is harder to cross the water from Norway and the Lofoten  Islands to Iceland and Greenland than it is to cross from Asia by way of  the Aleutian Islands or Bering Strait. Nevertheless in the tenth century  of the Christian era bold Norse vikings made the passage in the face of  storm and wind. In their slender open ships they braved the elements  on voyage after voyage. We think of the vikings as pirates, and so  they were. But they were also diligent colonists who tilled the ground  wherever it would yield even the scantiest living. In Iceland and  Greenland they must have labored mightily to carry on the farms of which  the Sagas tell us. When they made their voyages, honest commerce was  generally in their minds quite as much as was plunder. Leif, the son of  that rough Red Eric who first settled Greenland, made a famous voyage  to Vinland, the mainland of America. Like so many other voyagers he was  bent on finding a region where men could live happily and on filling his  boats with grapes, wood, or other commodities worth carrying home.    In view of the energy of the Norsemen, the traces of their presence  in the Western Hemisphere are amazingly slight. In Greenland a few  insignificant heaps of stones are supposed to show where some of them  built small villages. Far in the north Stefansson found fair-haired,  blue-eyed Eskimos. These may be descendants of the Norsemen, although  they have migrated thousands of miles from Greenland. In Maine the  Micmac Indians are said to have had a curious custom which they may  have learned from the vikings. When a chief died, they chose his largest  canoe. On it they piled dry wood, and on the wood they placed the body.  Then they set fire to the pile and sent the blazing boat out to sea.  Perhaps in earlier times the Micmacs once watched the flaming funeral  pyre of a fair-haired viking. As the ruddy flames leaped skyward and  were reflected in the shimmering waves of the great waters the tribesmen  must have felt that the Great Spirit would gladly welcome a chief who  came in such a blaze of glory. *          * For this information I am indebted to Mr. Stansbury Hagar.      It seems strange that almost no other traces of the strong vikings  are found in America. The explanation lies partly in the length and  difficulty of the ocean voyage, and partly in the inhospitable character  of the two great islands that served as stepping-stones from the Old  World to the New. Iceland with its glaciers, storms, and long dreary  winters is bad enough. Greenland is worse. Merely the tip of that  island was known to the Norse--and small wonder, for then as now most  of Greenland was shrouded in ice. Various Scandinavian authors, however,  have thought that during the most prosperous days of the vikings the  conditions in Greenland were not quite so bad as at the present day. One  settlement, Osterbyden, numbered 190 farms, 12 churches, 2 monasteries,  and 1 bishopric. It is even stated that apple-trees bore fruit and that  some wheat was raised. \"Cattle-raising and fishing,\" says Pettersson,  \"appear to have procured a good living.... At present the whole stock of  cattle in Greenland does not amount to 100 animals.\" * In those days the  ice which borders all the east coast and much of the west seems to have  been less troublesome than now. In the earliest accounts nothing is said  of this ice as a danger to navigation. We are told that the best sailing  route was through the strait north of Cape Farewell Island, where today  no ships can pass because of the ice. Since the days of the Norsemen the  glaciers have increased in size, for the natives say that certain ruins  are now buried beneath the ice, while elsewhere ruins can be seen which  have been cut off from the rest of the country by advancing glacial  tongues.          * O. Pettersson, \"Climatic Variations in Historic and Prehistoric  Times.\" Svenska Hydrogrifisk--Biologiska Kommissioneur Skrifter, Haft V.  Stockholm.      Why the Norsemen disappeared from the Western Hemisphere we do not  exactly know, but there are interesting hints of an explanation. It  appears that the fourteenth century was a time of great distress. In  Norway the crops failed year after year because of cold and storms.  Provinces which were formerly able to support themselves by agriculture  were obliged to import food. The people at home were no longer able to  keep in touch with the struggling colony in Greenland. No supplies came  from the home land, no reenforcements to strengthen the colonists and  make them feel that they were a part of the great world. Moreover in the  late Norse sagas much is said about the ice along the Greenland coast,  which seems to have been more abundant than formerly. Even the Eskimos  seem to have been causing trouble, though formerly they had been a  friendly, peaceable people who lived far to the north and did not  disturb the settlers. In the fourteenth century, however, they began to  make raids such as are common when primitive people fall into distress.  Perhaps the storms and the advancing ice drove away the seals and  other animals, so that the Eskimos were left hungry. They consequently  migrated south and, in the fifteenth century, finally wiped out the  last of the old Norse settlers. If the Norse had established permanent  settlements on the mainland of North America, they might have persisted  to this day. As it was, the cold, bleak climate of the northern route  across the Atlantic checked their progress. Like the Indians, they had  the misfortune of finding a route to America through regions that are  not good for man.    Though islands may be stepping-stones between the Old World and the New,  they have not been the bringers of civilization. That function in the  history of man has been left to the winds. The westerlies, however,  which are the prevailing winds in the latitude of the United States and  Europe, have not been of much importance. On the Atlantic side they were  for many centuries a barrier to contact between the Old World and the  New. On the Pacific side they have been known to blow Japanese vessels  to the shores of America contrary to the will of the mariners. Perhaps  the same thing may have happened in earlier times. Asia may thus have  made some slight contribution to primitive America, but no important  elements of civilization can be traced to this source.    From latitude 30 degrees N. to 30 degrees S. the tradewinds prevail. As  they blow from the east, they make it easy for boats to come from Africa  to America. In comparatively recent times they brought the slave ships  from the Guinea coast to our Southern States. The African, like the  Indian, has passed through a most unfavorable environment on his way  from central Asia to America. For ages he was doomed to live in a  climate where high temperature and humidity weed out the active type  of human being. Since activity like that of Europe means death in a  tropical climate, the route by way of Africa has been if anything worse  than by Bering Strait.    By far the most important occurrence which can be laid at the door of  the trade-winds is the bringing of the civilization of Europe and the  Mediterranean to the New World. Twice this may have happened, but  the first occurrence is doubtful and left only a slight impress.

BLACK-CROWNED NIGHT  HERON.]      THE BLACK-CROWNED NIGHT HERON.      What a beautiful creature this is! A mounted specimen requires, like  the Snowy Owl, the greatest care and a dust tight glass case to  preserve its beauty. Dr. Coues' account of it should be read by those  who are interested in the science of ornithology. It is a common bird  in the United States and British Provinces, being migratory and  resident in the south. Heronries, sometimes of vast extent, to which  they return year after year, are their breeding places. Each nest  contains three or four eggs of a pale, sea-green color. Observe the  peculiar plumes, sometimes two, in this case three, which spring from  the back of the head. These usually lie close together in one bundle,  but are often blown apart by the wind in the form of streamers. This  Heron derives its name from its habits, as it is usually seen flying  at night, or in the early evening, when it utters a sonorous cry of  _quaw_ or _quawk_. It is often called Quawk or Qua-Bird.    On the return of the Black-Crowned Night Heron in April, he promptly  takes possession of his former home, which is likely to be the most  solitary and deeply shaded part of a cedar swamp. Groves of swamp oak  in retired and water covered places, are also sometimes chosen, and  the males often select tall trees on the bank of the river to roost  upon during the day. About the beginning of twilight they direct their  flight toward the marshes, uttering in a hoarse and hollow tone, the  sound _qua_. At this hour all the nurseries in the swamps are emptied  of their occupants, who disperse about the marshes along the ditches  and river shore in search of food. Some of these nesting places have  been occupied every spring and summer for many years by nearly a  hundred pair of Herons. In places where the cedars have been cut down  and removed the Herons merely move to another part of the swamp, not  seeming greatly disturbed thereby; but when attacked and plundered  they have been known to remove from an ancient home in a body to some  unknown place.    The Heron's nest is plain enough, being built of sticks. On entering  the swamp in the neighborhood of one of the heronries the noise of the  old and young birds equals that made by a band of Indians in conflict.  The instant an intruder is discovered, the entire flock silently rises  in the air and removes to the tops of the trees in another part of the  woods, while sentries of eight or ten birds make occasional circuits  of inspection.    The young Herons climb to the tops of the highest trees, but do not  attempt to fly. While it is probable these birds do not see well by  day, they possess an exquisite facility of hearing, which renders it  almost impossible to approach their nesting places without discovery.  Hawks hover over the nests, making an occasional sweep among the  young, and the Bald Eagle has been seen to cast a hungry eye upon  them.    The male and female can hardly be distinguished. Both have the plumes,  but there is a slight difference in size.    The food of the Night Heron, or Qua-Bird, is chiefly fish, and his two  interesting traits are tireless watchfulness and great appetite. He  digests his food with such rapidity that however much he may eat, he  is always ready to eat again; hence he is little benefited by what he  does eat, and is ever in appearance in the same half-starved state,  whether food is abundant or scarce.          THE RING-BILLED GULL.      The Ring-billed Gull is a common species throughout eastern North  America, breeding throughout the northern tier of the United States,  whose northern border is the limit of its summer home. As a rule in  winter it is found in Illinois and south to the Gulf of Mexico. It is  an exceedingly voracious bird, continually skimming over the surface  of the water in search of its finny prey, and often following shoals  of fish to great distances. The birds congregate in large numbers at  their breeding places, which are rocky islands or headlands in the  ocean. Most of the families of Gulls are somewhat migratory, visiting  northern regions in summer to rear their young. The following lines  give with remarkable fidelity the wing habits and movements of this  tireless bird:        \"On nimble wing the gull      Sweeps booming by, intent to cull      Voracious, from the billows' breast,      Marked far away, his destined feast.      Behold him now, deep plunging, dip      His sunny pinion's sable tip      In the green wave; now highly skim      With wheeling flight the water's brim;      Wave in blue sky his silver sail      Aloft, and frolic with the gale,      Or sink again his breast to lave,      And float upon the foaming wave.      Oft o'er his form your eyes may roam,      Nor know him from the feathery foam,      Nor 'mid the rolling waves, your ear      On yelling blast his clamor hear.\"    This Gull lives principally on fish, but also greedily devours  insects. He also picks up small animals or animal substances with  which he meets, and, like the vulture, devours them even in a putrid  condition. He walks well and quickly, swims bouyantly, lying in the  water like an air bubble, and dives with facility, but to no great  depth.    As the breeding time approaches the Gulls begin to assemble in flocks,  uniting to form a numerous host. Even upon our own shores their  nesting places are often occupied by many hundred pairs, whilst  further north they congregate in countless multitudes. They literally  cover the rocks on which their nests are placed, the brooding parents  pressing against each other.    Wilson says that the Gull, when riding bouyantly upon the waves and  weaving a sportive dance, is employed by the poets as an emblem of  purity, or as an accessory to the horrors of a storm, by his shrieks  and wild piercing cries. In his habits he is the vulture of the ocean,  while in grace of motion and beauty of plumage he is one of the most  attractive of the splendid denizens of the ocean and lakes.    The Ring-billed Gull's nest varies with localities. Where there is  grass and sea weed, these are carefully heaped together, but where  these fail the nest is of scanty material. Two to four large oval  eggs of brownish green or greenish brown, spotted with grey and brown,  are hatched in three or four weeks, the young appearing in a thick  covering of speckled down. If born on the ledge of a high rock, the  chicks remain there until their wings enable them to leave it, but if  they come from the shell on the sand of the beach they trot about  like little chickens. During the first few days they are fed with  half-digested food from the parents' crops, and then with freshly  caught fish.    The Gull rarely flies alone, though occasionally one is seen far away  from the water soaring in majestic solitude above the tall buildings  of the city.    [Illustration: From col. Chi. Acad. Sciences. RING-BILLED GULL.]          THE MOCKING BIRD.      The Mocking Bird is regarded as the chief of songsters, for in  addition to his remarkable powers of imitation, he is without a rival  in variety of notes. The Brown Thrasher is thought by many to have a  sweeter song, and one equally vigorous, but there is a bold brilliancy  in the performance of the Mocker that is peculiarly his own, and which  has made him _par excellence_ the forest extemporizer of vocal melody.  About this of course there will always be a difference of opinion, as  in the case of the human melodists.    So well known are the habits and characteristics of the Mocking Bird  that nearly all that could be written about him would be but a  repetition of what has been previously said. In Illinois, as in many  other states, its distribution is very irregular, its absence from  some localities which seem in every way suited being very difficult to  account for. Thus, according to \"Birds of Illinois,\" while one or two  pairs breed in the outskirts of Mount Carmel nearly every season, it  is nowhere in that vicinity a common bird. A few miles further north,  however, it has been found almost abundant. On one occasion, during a  three mile drive from town, six males were seen and heard singing  along the roadside. Mr. H. K. Coale says that he saw a mocking bird in  Stark county, Indiana, sixty miles southeast of Chicago, January 1,  1884; that Mr. Green Smith had met with it at Kensington Station,  Illinois, and that several have been observed in the parks and  door-yards of Chicago. In the extreme southern portion of the state  the species is abundant, and is resident through the year.    The Mocking Bird does not properly belong among the birds of the  middle or eastern states, but as there are many records of its  nesting in these latitudes it is thought to be safe to include it.  Mrs. Osgood Wright states that individuals have often been seen in the  city parks of the east, one having lived in Central Park, New York  city, late into the winter, throughout a cold and extreme season. They  have reared their young as far north as Arlington, near Boston, where  they are noted, however, as rare summer residents. Dr. J. A. Allen,  editor of _The Auk_, notes that they occasionally nest in the  Connecticut Valley.    The Mocking Bird has a habit of singing and fluttering in the middle  of the night, and in different individuals the song varies, as is  noted of many birds, particularly canaries. The song is a natural love  song, a rich dreamy melody. The mocking song is imitative of the notes  of all "]]]
