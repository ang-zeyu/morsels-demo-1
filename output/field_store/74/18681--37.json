His face was expressionless,  but his whole body seemed to shake with suppressed emotion as he choked  in guttural Dutch:    \"Your excellency shall be obeyed.\" He salaamed to the ground.    Van Schouten glared at Peter Gross.    \"Mynheer Gross, the good name of our fair city is very dear to us,\" he  said sternly. \"Scenes of violence like this do it much damage. I would  have further discourse with you. Be at the _paleis_ within the hour.\"    \"I shall be there, your excellency,\" Peter Gross promised.    The governor shifted his frown to Ah Sing.    \"As for you, Ah Sing, I have heard many evil reports of this place,\" he  said. \"Let me hear no more.\"    While Ah Sing salaamed again, the governor strode pompously away,  followed at a respectful distance by Peter Gross. It was not until they  had disappeared beyond a curve in the road that Ah Sing let his face  show his feelings. Then an expression of malignant fury before which  even the two Thibetans quailed, crossed it.    He uttered a harsh command to have the debris removed. The Thibetans  jumped forward in trembling alacrity. Without giving them another glance  he waddled into the building, into a little den screened off for his own  use. From a patent steel safe of American make he took an ebony box,  quaintly carved and colored in glorious pinks and yellows with a flower  design. Opening this, he exposed a row of glass vials resting on beds of  cotton. Each vial contained some nail parings.    He took out the vials one by one, looked at their labels inscribed in  Chinese characters, and placed them on an ivory tray. As he read each  label a curious smile of satisfaction spread over his features.    When he had removed the last vial he sat at his desk, dipped a pen into  India ink, and wrote two more labels in similar Chinese characters. When  the ink had dried he placed these on two empty vials taken from a  receptacle on his desk. The vials were placed with the others in the  ebony box and locked in the safe.    The inscriptions he read on the labels were the names of men who had  died sudden and violent deaths in the East Indies while he had lived at  Batavia. The labels he filled out carried the names of Adriaan  Adriaanszoon Van Schouten and Peter Gross.          CHAPTER III    PETER GROSS IS NAMED RESIDENT      \"Sailor, the penalty for threatening the life of any citizen is penal  servitude on the state's coffee-plantations.\"    The governor's voice rang harshly, and he scowled across the big table  in his cabinet-room at the _Coryander's_ mate sitting opposite him. His  hooked nose and sharp-pointed chin with its finely trimmed Van Dyke  beard jutted forward rakishly.    \"I ask no other justice than your excellency's own sense of equity  suggests,\" Peter Gross replied quietly.    \"H'mm!\" the governor hummed. He looked at the _Coryander's_ mate keenly  for a few moments through half-closed lids. Suddenly he said:    \"And what if I should appoint you a resident, sailor?\"    Peter Gross's lips pressed together tightly, but otherwise he gave no  sign of his profound astonishment at the governor's astounding proposal.  Sinking deeper into his chair until his head sagged on his breast, he  deliberated before replying.    \"Your excellency is in earnest?\"    \"I do not jest on affairs of state, Mynheer Gross. What is your  answer?\"    Peter Gross paused. \"Your excellency overwhelms me--\" he began, but Van  Schouten cut him short.    \"Enough! When I have work to do I choose the man who I think can do it.  Then you accept?\"    \"Your excellency, to my deep regret I must most respectfully decline.\"    A look of blank amazement spread over the governor's face. Then his eyes  blazed ominously.    \"Decline! Why?\" he roared.    \"For several reasons,\" Peter Gross replied with disarming mildness. \"In  the first place I am under contract with Captain Threthaway of the  _Coryander_--\"    \"I will arrange that with your captain,\" the governor broke in.    \"In the second place I am neither a soldier nor a politician--\"    \"That is for me to consider,\" the governor retorted.    \"In the third place, I am a citizen of the United States and therefore  not eligible to any civil appointment from the government of the  Netherlands.\"    \"_Donder en bliksem!_\" the governor exclaimed. \"I thought you were a  freeholder here.\"    \"I am,\" Peter Gross admitted. \"The land I won is at Riswyk. I expect to  make it my home when I retire from the sea.\"    \"How long have you owned that land?\"    \"For nearly seven years.\"    The governor stroked his beard. \"You talk Holland like a Hollander,  Mynheer Gross,\" he observed.    \"My mother was of Dutch descent,\" Peter Gross explained. \"I learned the  language from her.\"    \"Good!\" Van Schouten inclined his head with a curt nod of satisfaction.  \"Half Holland is all Holland. We can take steps to make you a citizen at  once.\"    \"I don't care to surrender my birthright.\" Peter Gross negatived  quietly.    \"What!\" Van Schouten shouted. \"Not for a resident's post? And eight  thousand guilders a year? And a land grant in Java that will make you  rich for life if you make those hill tribes stick to their plantations?  What say you to this, Mynheer Gross?\" His lips curved with a smile of  anticipation.    \"The offer is tempting and the honor great,\" Peter Gross acknowledged  quietly. \"But I can not forget I was born an American.\"    Van Schouten leaned back in his chair with a look of astonishment.    \"You refuse?\" he asked incredulously.    \"I am sorry, your excellency!\" Peter Gross's tone was unmistakably firm.    \"You refuse?\" the governor repeated, still unbelieving.  \"Eight--thousand--guilders! And a land grant that will make you rich for  life!\"    \"I am an American, and American I shall stay.\"    The governor's eyes sparkled with admiration.    \"By the beard of Orange!\" he exclaimed, \"it is no wonder you Yankees  have sucked the best blood of the world into your country.\" He leaned  forward confidentially.    \"Mynheer Gross, I cannot appoint you resident if you refuse to take the  oath of allegiance to the queen. But I can make you special agent of the  _gouverneur-generaal_. I can make you a resident in fact, if not in  name, of a country larger than half the Netherlands, larger than many of  your own American States. I can give you the rewards I have pledged you,  a fixed salary and the choice of a thousand hectares of our fairest  state lands in Java. What do you say?\"    He leaned forward belligerently. In that posture his long, coarse hair  rose bristly above his neck, giving him something of the appearance of a  gamecock with feathers ruffled. It was this peculiarity that first  suggested the name he was universally known by throughout the Sundas,  \"De Kemphaan\" (The Gamecock).    \"To what province would you appoint me?\" Peter Gross asked slowly.    The governor hesitated. With the air of a poker player forced to show  his hand he confessed:    \"It is a difficult post, mynheer, and needs a strong man as resident. It  is the residency of Bulungan, Borneo.\"    There was the faintest flicker in Peter Gross's eyes. Van Schouten  watched him narrowly. In the utter stillness that followed the governor  could hear his watch tick.    Peter Gross rose abruptly, leaped for the door, and threw it open. He  looked straight into the serene, imperturbable face of Chi Wung Lo,  autocrat of the governor's domestic establishment. Chi Wung bore a  delicately lacquered tray of Oriental design on which were standing two  long, thin, daintily cut glasses containing cooling limes that bubbled  fragrantly. Without a word he swept grandly in and placed the glasses on  the table, one before the governor, and the other before Peter Gross's  vacant chair.    \"Ha!\" Van Schouten exclaimed, smacking his lips. \"Chi Wung, you  peerless, priceless servant, how did you guess our needs?\"    With a bland bow and never a glance at Peter Gross, Chi Wung strutted  out in Oriental dignity, carrying his empty tray. Peter Gross closed the  door carefully, and walked slowly back.    \"I was about to say, your excellency,\" he murmured, \"that Bulungan has  not a happy reputation.\"    \"It needs a strong man to rule it,\" the governor acknowledged, running  his glance across Peter Gross's broad shoulders in subtle compliment.    \"Those who have held the post of resident there found early graves.\"    \"You are young, vigorous. You have lived here long enough to know how to  escape the fevers.\"    \"There are worse enemies in Bulungan than the fevers,\" Peter Gross  replied. \"It is not for nothing that Bulungan is known as the graveyard  of Borneo.\"    The governor glanced at Peter Gross's strong face and stalwart form  regretfully.    \"Your refusal is final?\" he asked.    \"On the contrary, if your excellency will meet one condition, I accept,\"  Peter Gross replied.    The governor put his glass down sharply and stared at the sailor.    \"You accept this post?\" he demanded.    \"Upon one condition, yes!\"    \"What is that condition?\"    \"That I be allowed a free hand.\"    \"H'mm!\" Van Schouten drew a deep breath and leaned back in his chair.  The sharp, Julian cast of countenance was never more pronounced, and the  eagle eyes gleamed inquiringly, calculatingly. Peter"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3725"],[0,"Famous Men of the Middle Ages (#4)"],[1,", leaving his generals to  make terms with Alaric. It was agreed that Alaric should withdraw  from Rome upon the payment of 5,000 pounds of gold and 30,000 pounds  of silver.    When Honorius read the treaty he refused to sign it. Alaric then  demanded that the city be surrendered to him, and the people, terrified,  opened their gates and even agreed that Alaric should appoint another  emperor in place of Honorius.    This new emperor, however, ruled so badly that Alaric thought it  best to restore Honorius. Then Honorius, when just about to be  treated so honorably, allowed a barbarian chief who was an ally  of his to make an attack upon Alaric. The attack was unsuccessful,  and Alaric immediately laid siege to Rome for the third time. The  city was taken, and Alaric's dream came true. In a grand procession  he rode at the head of his army through the streets of the great  capital.    Then began the work of destruction. The Goths ran in crowds through  the city, wrecked private houses and public buildings and seized  everything of value they could find. Alaric gave orders that no  injury should be done to the Christian churches, but other splendid  buildings of the great city were stripped of the beautiful and  costly articles that they contained, and all the gold and silver  was carried away from the public treasury.    [Illustration: THE BURIAL OF ALARIC IN THE BED OF THE RIVER BUSENTO  AT MIDNIGHT]    In the midst of the pillage Alaric dressed himself in splendid  robes and sat upon the throne of the emperor, with a golden crown  upon his head.    While Alaric was sitting on the throne thousands of Romans were  compelled to kneel down on the ground before him and shout out his  name as conqueror and emperor. Then the theaters and circuses were  opened, and Roman athletes and gladiators had to give performances  for the amusement of the conquerors. After six days of pillage and  pleasure Alaric and his army marched through the gates, carrying  with them the riches of Rome.    Alaric died on his way to Sicily, which he had thought to conquer  also. He felt his death coming and ordered his men to bury him in  the bed of the river Busento and to put into his grave the richest  treasures that he had taken from Rome.    This order was carried out. A large number of Roman slaves were  set to work to dig a channel and turn the water of the Busento  into it. They made the grave in the bed of the river, put Alaric's  body into and closed it up. Then the river was turned back to its  old channel. As soon as the grave was covered up, and the water  flowed over it, the slaves who had done the work were put to death  by the Visigoth chiefs.          ATTILA THE HUN    KING FROM 434-453 A.D.    I    The fierce and warlike tribe, called the Huns, who had driven the  Goths to seek new homes, came from Asia into Southeastern Europe  and took possession of a large territory lying north of the River  Danube.    During the first half of the fifth century the Huns had a famous  king named At'ti-la. He was only twenty-one years old when he became  their king. But although he was young, he was very brave and ambitious,  and he wanted to be a great and powerful king.    Not far from Attila's palace there was a great rocky cave in the  mountains. In this cave lived a strange man called the \"Hermit of  the Rocks.\" No one knew his real name, or from what country he  had come. He was very old, with wrinkled face and long gray hair  and beard.    Many persons believed that he was a fortune-teller, so people often  went to him to inquire what was to happen to them. One day, shortly  after he became king, Attila went to the cave to get his fortune  told.    \"Wise man,\" said he, \"look into the future and tell me what is before  me in the path of life.\"    The hermit thought for a few moments, and then said, \"O King, I  see you a famous conqueror, the master of many nations. I see you  going from country to country, defeating armies and destroying  cities until men call you the 'Fear of the World.' You heap up  vast riches, but just after you have married the woman you love  grim death strikes you down.\"    With a cry of horror Attila fled from the cave. For a time he thought  of giving up his idea of becoming a great man. But he was young  and full of spirit, and very soon he remembered only what had been  said to him about his becoming a great and famous conqueror and  began to prepare for war. He gathered together the best men from  the various tribes of his people and trained them into a great  army of good soldiers.    II    About this time one of the king's shepherds, while taking care  of cattle in the fields, noticed blood dripping from the foot of  one of the oxen. The shepherd followed the streak of blood through  the grass and at last found the sharp point of a sword sticking  out of the earth. He dug out the weapon, carried it to the palace,  and gave it to King Attila. The king declared it was the sword of  Tiew, the god of war. He then strapped it to his side and said  he would always wear it.    [Illustration: A HUNNIC INVASION]    \"I shall never be defeated in battle,\" he cried, \"as long as I fight  with the sword of Tiew.\"    As soon as his army was ready he marched with it into countries  which belonged to Rome. He defeated the Romans in several great  battles and captured many of their cities. The Roman Emperor  Theodosius had to ask for terms of peace. Attila agreed that  there should be peace, but soon afterwards he found out that  Theodosius had formed a plot to murder him. He was so enraged at  this that he again began war. He plundered and burned cities  wherever he went, and at last the emperor had to give him a  large sum of money and a portion of country south of the Danube.    This made peace, but the peace did not last long. In a few years  Attila appeared at the head of an army of 700,000 men. With this  great force he marched across Germany and into Gaul. He rode on a  beautiful black horse, and carried at his side the sword of Tiew.  He attacked and destroyed towns and killed the inhabitants without  mercy. The people had such dread of him that he was called the  \"Scourge of God\" and the \"Fear of the World.\"    III    Attila and his terrible Huns marched through Gaul until they came to  the city of Orleans. Here the people bravely resisted the invaders.  They shut their gates and defended themselves in every way they  could. In those times all towns of any great size were surrounded by  strong walls. There was war constantly going on nearly everywhere,  and there were a great many fierce tribes and chiefs who lived by  robbing their neighbors. So the towns and castles in which there  was much money or other valuable property were not safe without  high and strong walls.    Attila tried to take Orleans, but soon after he began to attack  the walls he saw a great army at a distance coming towards the  city. He quickly gathered his forces together, marched to the  neighboring plain of Champagne and halted at the place where the  city of Chalons (_shah-lon'_) now stands.    The army which Attila saw was an army of 300,000 Romans and Visigoths.  It was led by a Roman general name A-e'ti-us and the Visigoth king,  The-od'o-ric. The Visigoths after the death of Alaric had settled  in parts of Gaul, and their king had now agreed to join the Romans  against the common enemy--the terrible Huns. So the great army  of the Romans and Visigoths marched up and attacked the Huns at  Chalons. It was a fierce battle. Both sides fought with the greatest  bravery. At first the Huns seemed to be winning. They drove back  the Romans and Visigoths from the field, and in the fight Theodoric  was killed.    [Illustration: ATTILA AND HIS TERRIBLE HUNS]    Aetius now began to fear that he would be beaten, but just at that  moment Thor'is-mond, the son of Theodoric, made another charge  against the Huns. He had taken command of the Visigoths when his  father was killed, and now he led them on to fight. They were all  eager to have revenge for the death of their king, so they fought  like lions and swept across the plain with great fury. The Huns  were soon beaten on every side, and Attila himself fled to his  camp. It was the first time he had ever been defeated. Thorismond,  the conqueror, was lifted upon his shield on the battle-field and  hailed as king of the Visigoths.    When Attila reached his camp he had all his baggage and wagons  gathered in a great heap. He intended to set fire to it and jump  into the flames if the Romans should come there to attack him.    \"Here I will perish in the flames,\" he cried, \"rather than surrender  to my enemies.\"    But the Romans did not come to attack him, and in a few days he  marched back to his own country.    Very soon, however, he was again on the war path. This time he  invaded Italy. He attacked and plundered the town of Aq'ui-le'i-a,  and the terrified inhabitants fled for their lives to the hills  and mountains. Some of them took refuge in the islands and marshes  of the Adriatic Sea. Here they founded Venice.    [Illustration: THORISMOND LIFTED UPON THE SHIELD]    The people of Rome and the Emperor Valentinian were greatly alarmed  at the approach of the dreaded Attila. He was now near the city,  and they had no army strong enough to send against him. Rome would  have been again destroyed if it had not been for Pope Leo I who  went to the camp of Attila and persuaded him not to attack the  city. It is said that the barbarian king was awed by the majestic  aspect and priestly robes of Leo. It is also told that the apostles  Peter and Paul appeared to Attila in his camp and threatened him  with death if he should attack Rome. He did not go away, however,  without getting a large sum of money as ransom.    [Illustration: ST. LEO HALTING ATTILA AT THE GATES OF ROME]    IV    Shortly after leaving Italy Attila suddenly died. Only the day  before his death he had married a beautiful woman "]]]
