Also, the falls are not without their romance. Tradition, dating back  to the Indian occupation, perhaps a hundred and fifty years ago,  tells of a beautiful Indian maiden who was wont to meet her lover at  midnight when the moon was full, at a spot just above the falls.  Coming down the river in her birch-bark canoe, the maiden would await  the arrival of the young warrior, who was of another and a hostile  tribe, living the other side of the mountain. When the moonlight  shadow of the tall pine fell upon a particular spot on the big rock,  the ardent lover arrived, guided through the dark and trackless  forest by the roar of the falls, which could be heard beyond the  mountain top.    Of course the chief, the girl's father, objected to the attentions of  this enemy lover, as also did other and rival admirers of her own  tribe.    On a mid-summer night the lovers parted, he to go on a mission to  Montreal, which then involved a long, difficult and dangerous tramp  through the wilderness. Both were pledged to meet again at the falls  at midnight of the harvest-moon. As the shadow of the September moon  fell upon the midnight mark on the big rock, the Indian maid arrived  in her canoe, but the lover came not. Instead, appeared one of the  rival warriors of her own tribe, who told of an ambush, of a poisoned  arrow and of a dead lover.      [Illustration: Buttermilk Falls]    The heart-broken maid then drifted out into midstream and with her  canoe passed over the falls and was killed on the rocks below.  Tradition goes on to relate how, at midnight of every harvest moon  since that tragic event, the ghost of the beautiful Indian maiden  appears in her birch bark canoe and sails over Buttermilk Falls,  disappearing in the foaming waters at their foot.    For many years I have tried to persuade Bige to join me in keeping  the date with this ghost, but up to the present writing it has never  been convenient.    Sitting, one day, at the foot of the falls, I was studying the  high-water marks on the adjacent rocks, indicating the immense volume  of waters that pass over the falls and down the rapids during the  freshets caused by melting snows and spring rains, trying to imagine  how it might look on such occasions, when a million logs, the cut of  the lumbermen during the previous winter, were let loose and came  crowding, climbing, jamming, tumbling over one another down through  the ravine and over the brink with the mighty rushing waters.    The ground about where I sat was strewn with rocks, boulders and  smaller stones, all worn by the ceaseless action of the waters, many  of them smooth, others seamed with strata of quartz, granite or  sandstone, some curiously marked and grotesque in shape.    As I sat thus, meditating, one of these curiously marked stones,  about the size and shape of one of those steel trench hats worn by  the \"doughboys\" in the late war, which had been lying close to the  edge of the water and partly in it, suddenly jumped up and appeared  to stand on four legs about six inches higher than it had been lying.  The legs seemed to be stiff and the movement was like the rising of a  disappearing cannon behind the walls of a fort. Instantly there  appeared a fifth leg or brace at the back which pushed the rear edge  of the trench hat upward and tilted it toward the water, when a  telescopic gun shot out from under this curious fighting machine and  plunged into the water. An instant later this telescopic gun lifted a  small trout out of the water, bit it in half, and with two snaps  swallowed it. The telescope then collapsed, the gun-carriage slowly  settled back, the tail brace curled up under the rear, the head was  drawn under the front of the shell, and the turtle's eyes closed to a  narrow slit. Again he looked like the stones among which he lay, but  his trap was set for another fish.      [Illustration: The Turtle with his trench hat]    In a few minutes another young trout strayed too close to the shore  and the operation was repeated. The maneuver, though awkward, was  swift and every time a fish was landed.    The turtle is a good swimmer and he remains under water a long time.  He doubtless also catches fish while swimming. This, however, was the  first time I saw him fishing from the shore.        SALMON RIVER is a swift flowing stream having an average width of  fifty feet, narrowing as it passes through gorges and having a number  of wide, deep pools in which the larger trout collect.    I have made diligent inquiry as to the reason for this name, and have  arrived at the conclusion that it was called Salmon River because  there were never any salmon in it, but there should be.    About three miles up stream, the beavers have built a dam across it,  backing the water up through a swampy section about a quarter of a  mile, flooding both banks of the river through the woods, thus  creating a fair sized artificial pond.    Bige and I decided that this would be a good place to fish, but that  it would be difficult, if not impossible, to reach the deep water of  the channel without a boat. So it was arranged that Bige should take  the basket containing food and cooking utensils up over the  tote-road, leave it at the beaver dam, then go on to Wolf Pond where  we had left one of our boats, and carry the boat back through the  woods to the dam where I should meet him about three hours later.    In order to make use of the time on my hands, I put on my wading  pants and hob-nailed shoes and proceeded to wade up stream, making a  cast occasionally where a likely spot appeared. It was a wonderful  morning. The weather conditions were exactly right for such an  expedition. I passed many spots that would have delighted the soul of  an artist. He, probably, would have taken a week to cover the  distance I expected to travel in three hours.    I had gone more than half way to the dam, had a few fish in my creel,  and was approaching an elbow in the stream. A high point of land  covered with bushes shut off my view of a deep pool just around the  corner, in which I had many times caught trout. As I came near this  bend in the river a most extraordinary thing occurred. I distinctly  saw a fish flying through the air over the top of the clump of bushes  on the point. A flying fish is not an unheard of thing, indeed I have  seen them several times, but not in the mountains, not in these  woods, where there are fresh waters only. Flying fish of the kind I  know about are met in the Sound and in bays near the ocean. Also, the  fish I just then had seen flying above the bushes, did not have the  extended wing-like fins of the orthodox flyer. This fish was a trout.  I had seen enough of them to feel sure of that. True, I had seen  trout jump out of the water, for a fly or to get up over a waterfall;  but I never before saw a trout climb fifteen or twenty feet into the  air, over the tops of bushes and young trees and land on the bank.      [Illustration: Wading Salmon River]    This was surely a matter that required explanation. An investigation  was necessary, and without hesitation I assumed the role of sleuth.  Carefully stepping out of the water, I sat on a rock and took off my  wading togs, then on stockinged feet and on hands and knees crept up  the bank. Peering through the bushes, I saw that since my last visit  a large birch tree had fallen across the pool and that the trunk of  this tree was partly submerged. Sitting on this fallen tree over the  center of the pool was a large black bear. Her back was toward me,  and she was in a stooping posture, holding one fore paw down in the  water. I was just in time to see a sudden movement of the submerged  paw and to see another trout, about twelve inches long, go sailing  through the air and fall behind some bushes just beyond where I was  in hiding. Rustling and squealing sounds coming from the direction in  which the fish had gone, indicated that a pair of cubs were behind  the bushes, and that they were scrapping over possession of the fish  their mother had tossed up to them. It was, perhaps, ten minutes  later I saw a third trout fly over the bushes toward the cubs. About  this time the bear turned her head, sniffed the air in my direction,  and with a low growl and a \"Whoof,\" started briskly for shore,  climbed the bank, collected the two cubs and made off into the woods,  smashing brush and fallen limbs of trees, occasionally pausing to  send back, in her own language, a remark indicating her disapproval  of the party who had interrupted her fishing operations.    The mystery of the flying trout was now solved, but a new conundrum  was presented to my enquiring mind; namely, how did the old lady  catch them? With what did the bear bait her hooks?    I have told the story to many guides and woodsmen of my acquaintance,  and from them have sought an answer to the question. Bige expressed  the opinion that the bear dug worms, wedged them in between her  toe-nails, and when the fish nibbled the worms the bear grabbed him.  Frank referred to the well known pungent odor of the bear, especially  of his feet, the tracks made by which a dog can smell hours, or even  days after the bear has passed. He said that fish are attracted by  the odor.    Also that many years ago, he had caught fish by putting oil of  rhodium on the bait, and that \"fish could smell it clear across the  pond.\" Frank admitted that this method of fishing was not  sportsman-like and that he had discontinued the practice. George said  he had many times watched trout in a pool rub their sides against  moss covered stones and often settle down upon the moss and rest  there.

I have dwelt, perhaps tediously, upon this swap; my excuses are--first,  that, having made few such good bargains during the days of my vanity,  the memory is a pleasant one; and, second, that the horse will necessarily play  a certain part in these memoirs.    \"Well, we'll be pushin' an, Billy,\" said M'Nab; \"the sun's gittin' low.  An' you needn't tail me up enny fardher,\" he added, turning to Rufus.  \"Loaf an these people the night.  A man thravellin' his lone,  an' nat a shillin' in his pocket!\"    \"O, go an' bark up a tree, you mongrel!\" replied the war-material,  with profusion of adjective.  \"Fat lot o' good tailin' you up!  A man that sets down to his dinner without askin' another man  whether he's got a mouth on him or not! Polite sort o' (person) you are!  Gerrout! you bin dragged up on the cheap!\"    \"Come! A'll bate ye fifty poun' A'm betther rairt nor you! Houl' an'!--  A'll bate ye a hundher'--two hundher', if ye lek, an' stake the money down  this minit\"----    \"Stiddy, now! draw it mild, you fellers there!\" thundered Cooper from behind.  \"Must n't have no quarrellin' while I'm knockin' round.\"    \"Ye'll be late gittin' to the ram-paddock, Tamson,\" remarked M'Nab,  treating Cooper with the silent contempt usually lavished upon men  of his physique.  \"Axpect thon's where ye're makin' fur?\"    \"I say--you better camp with us to-night,\" suggested Thompson,  evading the implied inquiry.    Without replying, the contractor put his horse into a canter, and,  accompanied by his esquire, went on his way, pausing only to speak to Mosey  for a few minutes as he passed the foremost team.    \"Curious sample o' (folks) you drop across on the track sometimes,\"  remarked Rufus, who remained with us.    \"No end to the variety,\" I replied.  Then lowering my voice  and glancing furtively round, I asked experimentally,  \"Haven't I seen you before, somewhere?\"    \"Queensland, most likely,\" he conjectured, whilst finding something  of interest on the horizon, at the side farthest from me.  \"Native o' that district, I am.  Jist comin' across for the fust time.  What's that bloke's name with the nex' team ahead--if it's a fair question?\"    \"Bob Dixon.\"    \"Gosh, I'm in luck!\" He spurred his mare forward, and attached himself to Dixon  for the rest of the afternoon.    But time, according to its deplorable habit, had been passing,  and the glitter had died off the plain as the sun went on its way  to make a futile attempt at purifying the microbe-laden atmosphere of Europe.    At last we reached the spot selected as a camp.  Close on our left  was the clump of swamp box which covered about fifty acres  of the nearer portion of the selection, leaving a few scattered trees  outside the fence.  On our right, the bare plain extended indefinitely.    I ought to explain that this selection was a mile-square block,  which had been taken up, four years previously, by a business man of Melbourne,  whose aim was to show the public how to graze scientifically on a small area.  Now Runnymede owned the selection, whilst its former occupier  was vending sixpenny parcels of inferior fruit on a railway platform.  The fence--erected by the experimentalist--was of the best kind;  two rails and four wires; sheep-proof and cattle-proof.    The wagons drew off the track, and stopped beside the fence  in the deepening twilight.  The bullocks were unyoked with all speed,  and stood around waiting to see what provision would be made for the night.    \"Look 'ere,\" said Mosey, taking a dead pine sapling from the stock of firewood  under his wagon, and, of course, emphasising his address by an easy  and not ungraceful clatter of the adjective used so largely by poets  in denunciation of war--\"we ain't goin' to travel these carrion a mile  to the gate, an' most likely fine it locked when we git there.  Hold on till I git my internal machine to work on the fence.  Dad!  Where's that ole morepoke?  O, you're there, are you?  Fetch the jack  off o' your wagon--come! fly roun'! you're (very) slow for a young fellow.  Bum,\" (abbreviation of \"bummer,\" and applied to the red-headed fellow)  \"you surround them carrion, or we'll be losin' the run o' them two steers.\"    A low groan from Bum's mare followed the heavy stroke of the ruffian's spurs.  \"Some o' you other (fellows) keep roun' that side,\" said he;  \"I'll go this road.  Up! you Red Roverite! \"--No use...  The mare had had enough for one day; she stumbled, and fell,  rolling heavily over her rider.  \"What the (quadruple expletive)'s the matter  with her?\" he continued, extricating himself, and kicking the beast  till she staggered to her feet.  \"Come on agen, an' don't gimme no more  o' your religiousness.\" He remounted, and the mare, under the strong stimulus  of his spurs, cantered laboriously out into the dark.    Meanwhile, Mosey had taken a hand-saw from its receptacle on his wagon,  and had cut the pine spar to a length of about eighteen inches less  than a panel of the fence.  \"Lash this 'ere saplin' hard down on the top rail,\"  he now commanded.  Price and Dixon obeyed, and Mosey laid  his powerful bottlejack on the rail, filling up the space, and began to turn it  with a long bolt, by way of lever.  \"You see, Tom,\" he remarked to me;  \"this fixter'll put the crooked maginnis on any fence from ere to 'ell.  It's got to come.  No matter how tight rails is shouldered,  they'll spring some; an' if every post'll give on'y half a inch, why then,  ten posts makes five or six inches; an' that's about all you want.  Then in the mornin', you can fix the fence so's the ole-man divil his self  could n't ball you out.  Ah!----! That's what comes o' blowin'.\"  For the post, being wild and free in the grain, had burst along  the two mortices; one half running completely off, just above the ground.  \"Serve people right for puttin' in rails when wire would do,\"  he continued, removing the screwjack.  \"Accidents will happen--  best reg'lated famblies.  'Tain't our business, anyhow.  Now, chaps,  round up yer carrion, an' shove 'em in.\"    The four wires in the lower part of the fence rung like harp strings  as the cattle stepped into or over them, and in a few minutes  the whole live stock of the caravan-eighty-four bullocks and seven horses--  were in the selection, but too thirsty to feed.  Then whilst Thompson, Mosey,  Willoughby and I tailed them toward the tank, Dixon hurried on ahead  with his five-gallon oil-drum, in order to replenish it before the water  was disturbed; and Price, by Mosey's orders, accompanied him  on the same business.  We steadied the bullocks at the tank till all  were satisfied, then headed them back to within fifty yards of the wagons,  where we hobbled all the horses, except Bum's mare.    \"Steve,\" said I to my old schoolmate:  \"of course, you and I are seized  of the true inwardness of duffing; but to those who live cleanly,  as noblemen should, this would appear a dirty transaction.\"    \"The world's full of dirty transactions, Tom,\" replied the bullock driver  wearily.  \"It's a dirty transaction to round up a man's team  in a ten-mile paddock, and stick a bob a head on them, but that's a thing  that I'm very familiar with; it's a dirty transaction to refuse water  to perishing beasts, but I've been refused times out of number,  and will be to the end of the chapter; it's a dirty transaction  to persecute men for having no occupation but carting, yet that's what  nine-tenths of the squatters do, and this Montgomery is one of the nine.  You're a bit sarcastic.  How long is it since you were one  of the cheekiest grass-stealers on the track?\"    \"Never, Steve.  You've been drinking.\"    \"Anyway, you need n't be more of a hypocrite than you can help,\"  grumbled Thompson.  \"If you want a problem to work out, just consider  that God constructed cattle for living on grass, and the grass  for them to live on, and that, last night, and to-night, and to-morrow night,  and mostly every night, we've a choice between two dirty transactions--  one is, to let the bullocks starve, and the other is to steal grass for them.  For my own part, I'm sick and tired of studying why some people  should be in a position where they have to go out of their way to do wrong,  and other people are cornered to that extent that they can't live  without doing wrong, and can't suicide without jumping out of the frying-pan  into the fire.  Wonder if any allowance is made for bullock drivers?--  or are they supposed to be able to make enough money to retire  into some decent life before they die?  Well, thank God for one good camp,  at all events.\"    \"How's the water?\" asked Cooper, meeting us at the fence.    \"Enough for to-night,\" replied Thompson; \"but very little left for posterity.\"    \"After us, the Deluge,\" observed Willoughby.    \"I hope so,\" replied Cooper devoutly.  \"Lord knows, it's badly wanted;  and I'm sure we don't grudge nobody the benefit.  Turnin' out nice an' cool,  ain't it?  The bullocks'll be able to do their selves some sort o' justice.\"    It was a clear but moonless night; the dark blue canopy spangled  with myriad stars--grandeur, peace, and purity above; squalor, worry,  and profanity below.  Fit basis for many an ancient system of Theology--  unscientific, if you will, but by no means contemptible.    Price and Cooper, being cooks, had kindled an unobtrusive fire in a crabhole,  where three billies were soon boiling.  And the tea, when cool enough,  needed no light to escort a due proportion of simple provender  into that mysterious laboratory which should never be considered too curiously.    After supper, we lay around, resting ourselves; everyone"]]]
