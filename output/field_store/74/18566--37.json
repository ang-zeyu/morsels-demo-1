They communicate by a network of roots that they've  developed.\"    \"I don't think that's so clever.\"    \"I merely said ... oh, what's the use of trying to explain everything to  you? You just don't want to understand.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Phyllis put down her needlework and closed her eyes. \"James,\" she said,  opening them again, \"it's no use pretending. I've been trying to be  sympathetic and understanding, but I can't do it. That tree--I've forced  myself to be nice to her, but the more I see of her, the more convinced  I am that she's trying to steal you from me.\"    Phyllis was beginning to poison his mind, he thought, because it had  seemed to him also, in his last conversation with Magnolia, that he had  discerned more than ordinary warmth in her attitude toward him ... and  perhaps a trace of spite toward his wife?    Preposterous! The tree had only been trying to cheer him up as any  friend might reasonably do. After all, a tree and a man.... Nonsense!  One had an anabolic metabolism, one a catabolic.    But this was a different kind of tree. She spoke, she read, she was  capable of conscious turgor movements. And he, he had often thought  secretly, was a different kind of man. Whereas Phyllis....    But that was disloyalty--to the type as well as the individual. The tree  could be a companion to him, but she could not give him sons to work his  land; she could not give him daughters to populate his planet; moreover,  she did not, could not possibly know what human love meant, while  Phyllis could at least learn.    \"Look, dear,\" he said, sitting down beside his wife on the couch and  taking her hand in his. She didn't draw away this time. \"Suppose that  what you say is true--not that it is, of course. Just because the tree  has a crush on me doesn't mean I necessarily have a crush on her, does  it?\"    His wife looked up at him, her rose-red lips parted, her moss-gray eyes  shining. \"Oh, if only I could believe that, James!\"    \"Anyhow, she doesn't know what the whole thing's about, poor kid!\"    \"Poor _kid_!\"    \"Phyllis, you know you're prettier than any tree.\" That was not  literally true, but reason was useless; he had to make his point in  terms she could understand. \"And, remember, she's got a lot of  rings--she must be centuries old--while you are only nineteen.\"    \"Twenty,\" Phyllis corrected. \"I had a birthday on the ship.\"    \"Well, you certainly must allow me to wish you a happy birthday,  darling.\"    She was in his arms at last; he was about to kiss her, and the tree  seemed very remote, when she drew back. \"But are you sure she  doesn't--she isn't--she can't be watching us?\"    \"Darling, I swear it!\" \"_Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear, that tips  with silver all these fruit-tree tops_\".... But he had sense enough not  to say it, and Elysium had not one blessed moon, but three, and  everything was all right.    For a while anyway.           *       *       *       *       *    \"I see your wife is developing a corm,\" the tree remarked, as James  paused for a chat. He hadn't much time to be sociable those days, for  there was such a lot of work to be done, so many preparations to be  made, so many things to be requisitioned from Earth. The supply ships  were beginning to come now, bringing necessities and an occasional  luxury for those who could afford it.    \"She's pregnant,\" James explained. \"Happened before I left Earth.\"    \"How do you mean?\"    \"She's about to fruit. Didn't I read that zoology book to you?\"    \"Yes, but--oh, James, it all seems so vulgar! To fruit without ever  having bloomed--how squalid!\"    \"It all depends on how you look at it,\" he said. \"I--that is, we had  hoped that when the baby came, you would be godmother to it. You know  what that is, don't you?\"    \"Of course I do. You read _Cinderella_ to me. I know it's a great honor.  But I'm afraid I must decline.\"    \"Why? I thought you were my--our friend.\"    \"Jim, there is something I must confess: my feelings toward you are not  merely those of a friend. Although Phyllis doesn't have too many rings  of intellect, she is a female, so she knew all along.\" Magnolia's leaves  rustled diffidently. \"I feel toward you the way I never felt toward any  intelligent life-form, but only toward the sun, the soil, the rain. I  sense a tropism that seems to incline me toward you. In fact, I'm  afraid, Jim, in your own terms, I love you.\"    \"But you're a tree! You can't love me in my own terms, because trees  can't love in the way people can, and, of course, people can't love like  trees. We belong to two entirely different species, Maggie. You can't  have listened to that zoology book very attentively.\"    \"Our race is a singularly adaptable one or we wouldn't have survived so  long, Jim, or gone so far in our particular direction. It's lack of  fertility, not lack of enterprise, that's responsible for our decline.  And I think your species must be an adaptable one, too; you just haven't  really tried. Oh, James, let us reverse the classical roles--let me be  the Apollo to your Daphne! Don't let Phyllis stand in our way. The Greek  gods never let a little thing like marriage interfere with their plans.\"           *       *       *       *       *    \"But I love Phyllis,\" he said in confusion. \"I love you, too,\" he added,  \"but in a different way.\"    \"Yes, I know. More like a sister. However, I have plenty of sisters and  I don't need a brother.\"    \"We're starting a conservation program,\" he tried to comfort her. \"We  have every hope of getting some pollen from the other side of the planet  once we have explained to the trees there how far we can make a little  go, and you've got to accept it; you mustn't be silly about it.\"    \"It isn't the same thing, Jim, and you know it. One of the penalties of  intelligence is a diffusiveness of the natural instincts. I would  rather not fruit at all than--\"    [Illustration]    \"Magnolia, you just don't understand. No matter how much you--well,  pursue me, I can never turn into a laurel tree.\"    \"I didn't--\"    \"Or any kind of tree! Look, some more books were just sent over from  Base.\"    Magnolia gave a rueful rustle. \"Just were sent? Didn't they come over a  month ago?\"    James flushed. \"I know I haven't had a chance to do much reading to you  in the last few weeks, Maggie--or any at all, in fact--but I've been so  busy. After the baby's born, things will be much less hectic and we'll  be able to catch up.\"    \"Of course, James. I understand. Naturally your family comes first.\"    \"One of the books that came was an advanced zoology text that might make  things a little clearer.\"    \"I should very much like to hear it. When you have the time to spare,  that is.\"    \"Tell you what,\" he said. \"I'll get the book and read you the chapter on  the reproductive system in mammals. Won't take more than an hour or so.\"    \"If you're in a hurry, it can wait.\"    \"No,\" he told her. \"This will make me feel a little less guilty about  having neglected you.\"           *       *       *       *       *    \"Whereupon the umbilical cord is severed,\" he concluded, \"and the human  infant is ready to take its place in the world as a separate entity. Now  do you understand, Magnolia?\"    [Illustration]    \"No,\" she said. \"Where do the bees come in?\"    \"I thought you were in such a hurry to get to Base, James,\" Phyllis  remarked sweetly from the doorway, wiping her reddening hands on a dish  towel.    \"I am, dear.\" He slipped the book behind his back; it was possible that,  in her present state of mind--induced, of course, by her delicate  condition--Phyllis might misunderstand his motive in reading that  particular chapter of that particular book to that particular tree. \"I  just stopped for a chat with Magnolia. She's agreed to be godmother to  the baby.\"    \"How very nice of her. Earth Government will be so pleased at such a  _fine_ example of rapport with the natives. You might even get a medal.  Wouldn't that be nice?... James,\" she hurried on, before he could speak,  \"you still haven't found any green-leafed plants on the planet, have  you? Have you looked everywhere? Have you looked _hard_?\"    \"Haven't I told you time and time again, Mrs. Haut,\" the tree said,  \"that there aren't any--that there can't be any? It's impossible to  synthesize chlorophyll from the light rays given off by our sun--only  cyanophyll. What do you want with a green-leafed plant, anyway?\"    Phyllis's voice broke. \"I think I'd lose my mind if I was convinced that  I'd never see a green leaf again. All this awful blue, blue, blue, all  the time, and the leaves never fall, or, if they do, there are new ones  right away to take their place. They're always there--always blue.\"    \"We're everblue,\" Magnolia explained. \"Sorry, but that's the way it is.\"    \"Jim, I hate to hurt your feelings, but I just have to take down those  curtains. The colors--I can't stand it!\"           *       *       *       *       *    \"Pregnant women sometimes get fanciful notions,\" James said to the tree.  \"It's part of the pregnancy syndrome. Try not to pay any attention.\"    \"Kindly don't explain me to a tree!\" Phyllis cried. \"I have a right to  prefer green, don't I?\"    \"There is, as your proverb says, no accounting for strange tastes,\" the  tree murmured. \"However--\"    \"We're going to have a formal christening,\" James interrupted, for the  sake of the peace. \"We thought we should, since ours will be the first  baby born on the planet. Everybody on Elysium will come--that is, all  the human beings. Only because they _can_ come, you know; we'd love to  have the trees if they were capable of locomotor movement.

Felicity remarked scornfully  that she would have thought the Story Girl would get tired wearing red  so much, and even Cecily commented apart to me that she thought when  you got so many things all at once you didn't appreciate them as much as  when you only got a few.    \"I'd never get tired of red,\" said the Story Girl. \"I just love it--it's  so rich and glowing. When I'm dressed in red I always feel ever so much  cleverer than in any other colour. Thoughts just crowd into my brain  one after the other. Oh, you darling dress--you dear, sheeny, red-rosy,  glistening, silky thing!\"    She flung it over her shoulder and danced around the kitchen.    \"Don't be silly, Sara,\" said Aunt Janet, a little stimy. She was a good  soul, that Aunt Janet, and had a kind, loving heart in her ample bosom.  But I fancy there were times when she thought it rather hard that the  daughter of a roving adventurer--as she considered him--like Blair  Stanley should disport herself in silk dresses, while her own daughters  must go clad in gingham and muslin--for those were the days when a  feminine creature got one silk dress in her lifetime, and seldom more  than one.    The Story Girl also got a present from the Awkward Man--a little,  shabby, worn volume with a great many marks on the leaves.    \"Why, it isn't new--it's an old book!\" exclaimed Felicity. \"I didn't  think the Awkward Man was mean, whatever else he was.\"    \"Oh, you don't understand, Felicity,\" said the Story Girl patiently.  \"And I don't suppose I can make you understand. But I'll try. I'd ten  times rather have this than a new book. It's one of his own, don't you  see--one that he has read a hundred times and loved and made a friend  of. A new book, just out of a shop, wouldn't be the same thing at all.  It wouldn't MEAN anything. I consider it a great compliment that he has  given me this book. I'm prouder of it than of anything else I've got.\"    \"Well, you're welcome to it,\" said Felicity. \"I don't understand and I  don't want to. I wouldn't give anybody a Christmas present that wasn't  new, and I wouldn't thank anybody who gave me one.\"    Peter was in the seventh heaven because Felicity had given him a  present--and, moreover, one that she had made herself. It was a bookmark  of perforated cardboard, with a gorgeous red and yellow worsted goblet  worked on it, and below, in green letters, the solemn warning, \"Touch  Not The Cup.\" As Peter was not addicted to habits of intemperance, not  even to looking on dandelion wine when it was pale yellow, we did not  exactly see why Felicity should have selected such a device. But Peter  was perfectly satisfied, so nobody cast any blight on his happiness by  carping criticism. Later on Felicity told me she had worked the bookmark  for him because his father used to drink before he ran away.    \"I thought Peter ought to be warned in time,\" she said.    Even Pat had a ribbon of blue, which he clawed off and lost half an hour  after it was tied on him. Pat did not care for vain adornments of the  body.    We had a glorious Christmas dinner, fit for the halls of Lucullus, and  ate far more than was good for us, none daring to make us afraid on that  one day of the year. And in the evening--oh, rapture and delight!--we  went to Kitty Marr's party.    It was a fine December evening; the sharp air of morning had mellowed  until it was as mild as autumn. There had been no snow, and the long  fields, sloping down from the homestead, were brown and mellow. A weird,  dreamy stillness had fallen on the purple earth, the dark fir woods, the  valley rims, the sere meadows. Nature seemed to have folded satisfied  hands to rest, knowing that her long wintry slumber was coming upon her.    At first, when the invitations to the party had come, Aunt Janet had  said we could not go; but Uncle Alec interceded in our favour, perhaps  influenced thereto by Cecily's wistful eyes. If Uncle Alec had a  favourite among his children it was Cecily, and he had grown even more  indulgent towards her of late. Now and then I saw him looking at her  intently, and, following his eyes and thought, I had, somehow, seen that  Cecily was paler and thinner than she had been in the summer, and that  her soft eyes seemed larger, and that over her little face in moments of  repose there was a certain languor and weariness that made it very sweet  and pathetic. And I heard him tell Aunt Janet that he did not like to  see the child getting so much the look of her Aunt Felicity.    \"Cecily is perfectly well,\" said Aunt Janet sharply. \"She's only growing  very fast. Don't be foolish, Alec.\"    But after that Cecily had cups of cream where the rest of us got only  milk; and Aunt Janet was very particular to see that she had her rubbers  on whenever she went out.    On this merry Christmas evening, however, no fears or dim foreshadowings  of any coming event clouded our hearts or faces. Cecily looked brighter  and prettier than I had ever seen her, with her softly shining eyes and  the nut brown gloss of her hair. Felicity was too beautiful for words;  and even the Story Girl, between excitement and the crimson silk array,  blossomed out with a charm and allurement more potent than any regular  loveliness--and this in spite of the fact that Aunt Olivia had tabooed  the red satin slippers and mercilessly decreed that stout shoes should  be worn.    \"I know just how you feel about it, you daughter of Eve,\" she said, with  gay sympathy, \"but December roads are damp, and if you are going to  walk to Marrs' you are not going to do it in those frivolous Parisian  concoctions, even with overboots on; so be brave, dear heart, and show  that you have a soul above little red satin shoes.\"    \"Anyhow,\" said Uncle Roger, \"that red silk dress will break the hearts  of all the feminine small fry at the party. You'd break their spirits,  too, if you wore the slippers. Don't do it, Sara. Leave them one wee  loophole of enjoyment.\"    \"What does Uncle Roger mean?\" whispered Felicity.    \"He means you girls are all dying of jealousy because of the Story  Girl's dress,\" said Dan.    \"I am not of a jealous disposition,\" said Felicity loftily, \"and she's  entirely welcome to the dress--with a complexion like that.\"    But we enjoyed that party hugely, every one of us. And we enjoyed the  walk home afterwards, through dim, enshadowed fields where silvery  star-beams lay, while Orion trod his stately march above us, and a red  moon climbed up the black horizon's rim. A brook went with us part of  the way, singing to us through the dark--a gay, irresponsible vagabond  of valley and wilderness.    Felicity and Peter walked not with us. Peter's cup must surely have  brimmed over that Christmas night. When we left the Marr house, he had  boldly said to Felicity, \"May I see you home?\" And Felicity, much to our  amazement, had taken his arm and marched off with him. The primness  of her was indescribable, and was not at all ruffled by Dan's hoot of  derision. As for me, I was consumed by a secret and burning desire to  ask the Story Girl if I might see HER home; but I could not screw my  courage to the sticking point. How I envied Peter his easy, insouciant  manner! I could not emulate him, so Dan and Felix and Cecily and the  Story Girl and I all walked hand in hand, huddling a little closer  together as we went through James Frewen's woods--for there are strange  harps in a fir grove, and who shall say what fingers sweep them? Mighty  and sonorous was the music above our heads as the winds of the night  stirred the great boughs tossing athwart the starlit sky. Perhaps it was  that aeolian harmony which recalled to the Story Girl a legend of elder  days.    \"I read such a pretty story in one of Aunt Olivia's books last night,\"  she said. \"It was called 'The Christmas Harp.' Would you like to hear  it? It seems to me it would just suit this part of the road.\"    \"There isn't anything about--about ghosts in it, is there?\" said Cecily  timidly.    \"Oh, no, I wouldn't tell a ghost story here for anything. I'd frighten  myself too much. This story is about one of the shepherds who saw the  angels on the first Christmas night. He was just a youth, and he loved  music with all his heart, and he longed to be able to express the melody  that was in his soul. But he could not; he had a harp and he often tried  to play on it; but his clumsy fingers only made such discord that  his companions laughed at him and mocked him, and called him a madman  because he would not give it up, but would rather sit apart by himself,  with his arms about his harp, looking up into the sky, while they  gathered around their fire and told tales to wile away their long night  vigils as they watched their sheep on the hills. But to him the thoughts  that came out of the great silence were far sweeter than their mirth;  and he never gave up the hope, which sometimes left his lips as a  prayer, that some day he might be able to express those thoughts in  music to the tired, weary, forgetful world. On the first Christmas night  he was out with his fellow shepherds on the hills. It was chill and  dark, and all, except him, were glad to gather around the fire. He sat,  as usual, by himself, with his harp on his knee and a great longing in  his heart. And there came a marvellous light in the sky and over the  hills, as if the darkness of the night had suddenly blossomed into a  wonderful meadow of flowery flame; and all the shepherds saw the angels  and heard them sing. And as they sang, the harp that the young shepherd  held began to play softly by itself, and as he listened to it he  realized that it was playing the same music that the angels sang  and that all his secret longings and aspirations and strivings were  expressed in it. From that night,"]]]
