Other possible explanations for the wolves' sudden  increase in movements will be discussed below.    The straight line distances traveled between consecutive weekly  locations (called the \"net weekly distances\") showed a similar  variation (table 3). The maximum net weekly distance for each wolf  varied from 4.6 miles for 1059 to 49.0 for 1055, with means ranging  from 2.9 to 15.6 miles for the same wolves. No doubt 1059's net weekly  distances were relatively short because her total range and that of her  pack were much smaller than those of the other wolves.    It is difficult to obtain comparable measures of the extent of the  ranges covered by each of the radiotagged wolves because their patterns  of travel varied so much. Thus the figures given in table 5 should be  regarded only as gross indicators of the minimum range of each animal.  The area figures are especially deceiving in the case of 1055, for she  had a horseshoe-shaped range, much of which apparently was not used.      _Table 3.--Straight line distances (miles) between consecutive locations of  radiotagged wolves_    #: _Number_  %: _Percent_    ---------------------------------------------------:----------------------------      :                                              :         Net weekly      :             Net daily distances              :          distances      :----------------------------------------------:----------------------------      :        :        :        :        :Mean net  :     :     :        :      :        :        :        :        :distance  :     :     :        :      :  Days  :Days no :  Days  :Mean net:per day   :     :Weeks:Mean net:  Wolf:  data  :  net   :movement:distance:excluding :Range:data :distance: Range    # :obtained:movement:        :per day :days of no:     :     :per week:      :        :        :        :        :movement  :     :     :        :      :--------:--------:--------:--------:----------:-----:-----:--------:-------      :    #   :  #   % :  #   % :  Miles :  Miles   :Miles:  #  : Miles  : Miles    1051    54     13  24   41  76     2.0      2.6   0.0-12.0  22   12.7   1.0-46.0  1053    37     20  54   17  46     1.0      2.1   0.0-5.0   23    6.3   0.0-23.6  1055    46      7  15   39  85     2.9      3.6   0.0-12.8  21   15.6   1.7-49.0  1057    29     11  38   18  62     1.0      1.5   0.0-4.5   15    4.6   0.0-31.0  1059    26      1   4   25  96     2.5      2.6   0.0-5.6   18    2.9   0.0-4.6  ----:--------:--------:--------:--------:----------:-----:-----:--------:-------      Nevertheless, one major piece of information is obvious from the  figures: 1059's pack of five wolves had a much smaller range than any  of the other uninjured animals--approximately 43 square miles when  figured by the minimum-area method (Mohr 1947). The next smallest range  was that of 1051 (excluding the area of his later dispersal--see  below), which was some seven times the size of the pack's range.      _Table 4.--Straight line distances (miles) traveled between consecutive  days (\"net daily distance\") by radiotagged wolves in northeastern  Minnesota during February 1969_    +-------+-------------------------+-------------------------+  |       |         Mean net        |       Greatest net      |  | Wolf  |      daily distance     |      daily distance     |  |number +------------+------------+------------+------------+  |       | Feb.  1-23 | Feb. 23-28 | Feb.  1-23 | Feb. 23-28 |  +-------+------------+------------+------------+------------+  | 1051       1.1          3.5          2.3          4.8     |  | 1053       0.7          2.5          3.0          5.0     |  | 1055       2.7          6.2          8.0         12.8     |  | 1057       1.0          1.5          4.0          4.5     |  | 1059       2.2          3.1          4.0          5.6     |  +-------+------------+------------+------------+------------+      There is little published information on the movements and ranges of  lone wolves with which to compare our data. Mech (1970) summarized  information regarding ranges of packs. Reported ranges varied from 36  square miles for a pack of two wolves in Minnesota (Stenlund 1955) to  5,000 square miles for a pack of 10 in Alaska (Burkholder 1959).  Considering only data based on intensive study in the same general  region (Minnesota, Isle Royale, and Ontario) as our study area, the  largest range reported was 210 square miles for a pack of 15 to 21  wolves on Isle Royale (Mech 1966, Jordan _et al._ 1967). On a per-wolf  basis, the ranges in this region varied from 6 to 28 square miles per  wolf. Our pack of five with its range of 43 square miles would have  about 9 square miles per wolf.    A more accurate assessment of the ranges of the radiotagged wolves  requires an individual discussion for each.    _No. 1051._--The range of 1051 was composed basically of three distinct  areas (fig. 19). Within 10 days after being released, the wolf left the  general area of his capture (Area A near Isabella Lake) and traveled to  Area B along Highway 1, some 17 miles to the southwest. From December 9  to January 4 wolf 1051 remained in Area B, which covers about 45 square  miles. Between January 4 and 6 he returned to Area A and stayed in 13  square miles until February 3. Between February 3 and 5 he shifted to  Area C east of Snowbank Lake, 11 miles northwest of Area A. He remained  in that 16-square-mile area until February 25, then suddenly left and  headed 8 miles to the northeast.      _Table 5.--Extent of ranges used by radiotagged wolves_    +--------+----------+----------+--------------+----------------------+  |  Wolf  | Greatest | Greatest | Total area[9]|Area[9] of intense use|  | number |  length  |  width   |              |  (before late Feb.)  |  +--------+----------+----------+--------------+----------------------+  |          _Miles_    _Miles_     _Sq. miles_    _Sq. miles_         |  |                                                                    |  |1051[10]   28.5       13.6          318          13 (Location A[11])|  |                                                 45 (Location B)    |  |                                                 16 (Location C)    |  |1053       31.1       22.0          392          31                 |  |1055       55.4       24.9          997          40                 |  |1057       32.3        3.8           77          14                 |  |1059[12]    8.4        8.0           43          39                 |  +--------+----------+----------+--------------+----------------------+    FOOTNOTES:    [9] Minimum area method (Mohr 1947).    [10] Before dispersal.    [11] See text and figure 19.    [12] Pack of five.      [Illustration: _Figure 19.--Locations and range of wolf 1051. Lines are  NOT travel routes; rather they merely indicate sequence of locations.  Only selected lakes are shown._]    From February 26 until April 24 the movements of 1051 were strongly  indicative of dispersal (fig. 20). His average weekly straight line  move during that period was 25 miles (compared with 6 miles per week  before this period), and until March 14 he maintained an almost  straight south-southwest heading to a location west of the town of  Castle Danger. After that the animal traveled a series of  northwest-southwest alternations that on April 3 took him east of Big  Sandy Lake to a point 129 miles southwest of where he had begun the  dispersal. There he remained for about 2 weeks, but between April 17  and 24 he traveled 26 miles northwest. We last saw him at 3:30 p.m. on  April 24 heading northwest through a swamp 15 miles southeast of Grand  Rapids, approximately 122 miles from where he had started. The total of  straight line distances between 16 consecutive pairs of locations taken  at intervals of from 1 to 8 days was 226 miles, which is the minimum  distance the wolf traveled during his dispersal.    [Illustration: _Figure 20.--Dispersal of wolf 1051. Lines merely  indicate sequence of locations. Only selected lakes are shown._]    We observed 1051 for distances of up to 5 miles during these travels;  he maintained a steady trot that seemed faster than usual, and he  appeared intent on heading in a straight line. He did chase deer  during his travels, and twice was seen feeding on carcasses. In the  area where he remained for about 2 weeks, he was twice seen closely  associated with another wolf. This relationship will be discussed  later.    An extensive search was made for 1051's signals on May 2 in an area of  at least 50 miles radius from his last known location, but it was  unsuccessful. On each subsequent tracking flight, the wolf's frequency  was also monitored with no success. Possible explanations for the loss  of the signal from this wolf include the following: (1) premature  expiration of the transmitter, (2) capture of the wolf and breakage of  the transmitter, (3) loss of the exposed antenna and consequent  reduction of range, and (4) travel of the wolf out of range of the  tracking aircraft.    During 1051's travels a number of interesting events took place:         Nov. 27, 1968--Captured and radiotagged         Dec. 4, 1968--Crossed road in front of tracking truck         Dec. 8, 1968--Moved to Area B         Dec. 9, 1968--Surprised on the ground at distance of 35 feet         Dec. 18, 1968--Chased by loggers with axes         Dec. 25, 1968--Almost shot by trapper who saw collar and       withheld fire         Jan. 5, 1969--Returned to Area A         Jan. 13, 1969--\"Bumped\" twice on logging road by loggers in       auto but no apparent injury         Feb. 4, 1969--Moved to Area C         Feb. 26, 1969--Began long-range southwest movement       considered to be dispersal         Mar. 14, 1969--Seen feeding on old carcass within 200"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37599"],[0,"The Legend of the Glorious Adventures of Tyl Ulenspiegel in the land of Flanders (#4)"],[1," the Sergeant summons me for having a child  without being married, they will make me pay twenty florins like a  girl of no reputation, and I shall be flogged in the Market Square.\"    Soetkin consoled and comforted her as sweetly as she could, then left  her, and returned thoughtfully home.    One day she said to Claes:    \"If I brought two children into the world instead of one, would you  be angry? Would you beat me, my man?\"    \"That I cannot say,\" Claes answered.    \"But if the second were not really mine, but turned out to be like  this child of Katheline's, the offspring of some one unknown--the  devil maybe?\"    \"Devils beget fire, death, smoke,\" Claes replied, \"but  children--no. Yet will I take for my own the child of Katheline.\"    \"You will?\" cried Soetkin. \"You really will?\"    \"I have said it,\" Claes replied.    Soetkin hurried off to tell Katheline the news, who when she heard  it could not contain her delight, but cried aloud with joy.    \"He has spoken, the good man, and his words are the salvation of my  body. He will be blessed by God--and blessed by the devil as well,  if really\"--and she trembled as she spoke the words--\"if really it is  the devil who is father to the little one that begins to stir beneath  my breast!\"    And in due time Soetkin and Katheline brought into the world,  the one a baby boy and the other a baby girl. Both were brought to  baptism as the children of Claes. Soetkin's son was christened Hans,  and did not live. But Katheline's daughter, who was christened Nele,  grew up finely.    She drank of the liquor of life from a fourfold flagon. Two of the  flagons belonged to Katheline, and two were Soetkin's. And there was  many a sweet dispute as to whose turn it was to give the child to  drink. But much against her will, Katheline was obliged to let her  milk dry up, lest questions should be asked as to where it came from,  and she no mother....    But when the little Nele, that was her daughter, was weaned, then  Katheline took her home to live with her, nor did she let her go back  to Soetkin except when Nele called for her \"mother.\"    The neighbours said that it was a right and natural thing to do for  Katheline to look after the child of Claes and Soetkin. For they  were needy and poverty-stricken, whereas Katheline was comparatively  well off.              X      One day Soetkin said to Claes:    \"Husband, I am heart-broken. This is now the third day that Tyl has  been away. Know you not where he is?\"    Claes answered her sadly:    \"He is with all the others, roving vagabonds like himself, on the high  road. Verily, it was cruel of God to give us such a son. When he was  born I thought of him as the joy of our old age, and as another help  in our house, for I hoped to make a good workman of him. But now some  evil chance hath turned him into a thief and a good-for-nothing.\"    \"You are too hard on him, my man,\" said Soetkin. \"He is our son, and he  is but nine years old, and filled with childish folly. It is needful  that he also, like the trees of the field, should let fall his husks  by the wayside ere he decks himself with the full foliage of virtue  and honesty. He is mischievous; I do not deny it. But later on this  spirit of his will be turned to good account, if instead of driving  him to tricks and frolics it is put to some useful purpose. He makes  fun of the neighbours; true. But one day you will find him take his  rightful place in the midst of a circle of gay and happy friends. He  is always laughing and frivolous; yes, but a young face that is too  serious bodes ill for the future. And if he is always running about,  it is because his growing body needs to be exercised; and if he is  idle and does no work, it is because he is not yet old enough to  feel the duty of labour. And if, now and then, he does stay away  from us for half a week at a time, it is only because he fails to  realize the grief he causes us; for he has a good heart, husband,  and at bottom he loves us.\"    Claes shook his head and said nothing, and went to sleep, leaving  Soetkin to her lonely tears. And she, in the morning, afraid lest her  son had fallen sick upon the road, went out and stood at the cottage  doorstep to see if he were coming back. But there was no sign of him,  and she came back into the cottage, and sat by the window, gazing  out all the time into the street. And many a time did her heart dance  within her bosom at the light footfall of some urchin that she thought  might be her own; but when the sound passed by, and she knew that it  was not Ulenspiegel, then she wept, poor mother that she was.    Ulenspiegel, meanwhile, with the fellow-scamps that bore him company,  was away at Bruges, at the Saturday market.    There were to be seen the shoemakers and the cobblers, each in his  separate stall, the tailors selling suits of clothes, the miesevangers  from Antwerp (they that snare tom-tits by night with the aid of an  owl); and the poulterers too, and the rascally dog-fanciers, and  sellers of catskins that are made into gloves, and of breast-pads and  doublets: buyers too of every kind, townsmen and townswomen, valets,  servants, pantlers and butlers, and cooks, male and female, all  together, buying and selling, each according to his quality shouting  his wares, crying up or crying down, with every trick of the trade.    Now in one corner of the market-place stood a wonderful tent made  of cloth, raised aloft on four piles. At the door of the tent was  a peasant from the level land of Alost, and by his side two monks  begged for alms. For the sum of one patard the peasant offered to  show to the curious or devout a genuine piece of the shoulder-bone of  St. Mary of Egypt. There he was, yelling out in his broken voice the  merits of the saint, and not omitting from his song that tale which  tells how she, being without money, paid the young ferryman in the  beautiful coinage of Nature herself, lest by refusing a workman his  due she might be guilty of sin. And all the while the two monks kept  nodding their heads, as much as to say that it was Gospel truth that  the peasant was speaking. And at their side was a fat, red-faced woman,  as lewd-looking as Astarte, blowing a raucous bagpipe, while at her  side a young girl sang in a voice sweet as a bird's, though no one  heeded her. Now above the door of the tent, and swung between two  poles by a cord fastened to either handle, was a tub of Holy Water  which the fat woman affirmed had been brought from Rome; and the two  monks lolled their heads backwards and forwards in confirmation or what  she said. Ulenspiegel, looking at the tub, grew suddenly thoughtful.    For to one of the posts of the tent was tied a donkey--a donkey that  to all appearance was wont to feed on hay rather than on oats. For  its head was down, and it scanned the earth in futile hopes of seeing  but a thistle growing there.    \"Comrades,\" said Ulenspiegel, pointing to the fat old woman, the two  monks, and the melancholy donkey, \"since the masters play so well,  let us also make the donkey dance.\"    And so saying he went to a stall close by and purchased six liards'  worth of pepper. Then he lifted up the tail of the donkey, and placed  the pepper underneath it.    When the donkey began to feel the sting of the pepper, he cast his eye  backwards under his tail, endeavouring to discover the cause of the  unaccustomed heat. Thinking that it must be at the least some fiery  devil from hell, the donkey conceived the not unnatural desire to run  away and escape him; so he began to bray as loud as he could, and to  kick up his heels, and to shake the post with all his strength. At  the first shock, the tub hanging between the two poles tipped over,  and the holy water ran about over the tent and over those that were  inside. And soon the tent itself collapsed, covering with a dripping  mantle all those who were listening to the wondrous tale of St. Mary  of Egypt. And Ulenspiegel and his comrades could hear a mighty noise  issuing from beneath the tent, a noise of moaning and lamentation. For  the devout folk that were within began to accuse one another of having  overturned the tub, and presently grew red with rage, and fell upon  each other with many furious blows. The tent began to bulge here and  there above the frantic efforts of the combatants. And each time that  Ulenspiegel descried some rounded form outlined through the cloth of  the tent, he went and gave it a prick with a pin. This was the signal  for new and louder cries, and for fiercer and more general fisticuffs.    Ulenspiegel was delighted, and soon he was to become even more so,  when he saw the donkey begin to run away, dragging behind him tent,  tub, tent-posts and all, while the master of the tent, with his wife  and daughter, hung on behind the baggage. At last the donkey, being  able to go no farther, raised his nose in the air, and gave vent to  bray after bray, a music that only ceased at those moments when he  was looking back under his tail to see if the fire that still raged  there would not soon go out.    All this time, the devout assembly in the tent were still  a-fighting. But the two monks, without troubling at all about what  was going on inside, began to gather up the money that had fallen  from the collection-plate, and Ulenspiegel assisted them devotedly,  but not without some profit to himself....              XI      Now all this time that the vagabond son of the charcoal-burner was  growing up in merriment and mischief, the moody scion of His Sacred  Majesty the Emperor was vegetating like a weed in moody melancholy. The  Lords and Ladies of the Court used to watch him as he mouched along  the rooms and passages of the palace at Valladolid, a frail, pitiful  specimen of humanity, with legs that shook and scarce seemed able  to support the weight of the big head that was covered with stiff  blond hair.    He loved to haunt dark corridors, and he would"]]]
