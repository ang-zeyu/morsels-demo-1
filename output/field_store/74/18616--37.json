In approximate order of their importance the  differences are as follows: 1) The red (or pale yellow or green or  buffy) marks on skin between the scales on the upper half of the  dorsolateral area (that is between the sixth and seventh, seventh and  eighth and eighth and ninth scale rows) present in _parietalis_ are  missing in _fitchi_ or are represented by only an occasional small  fleck. 2) The dorsolateral area is black or nearly so in _fitchi_ but  averages paler in _parietalis_, in which a wide range of shades may be  found from black to olive brown. 3) The red of the dorsolateral area  frequently invades the lateral stripe, which sometimes is mostly red,  and may even invade the ventrals in _parietalis_, but in _fitchi_ the  red marks are usually confined to the dorsolateral area, and do not  invade the lateral stripe. 4) The prominent paired black dots  or semicircular marks on the anterior edge of each ventral in  _parietalis_ are largely lacking in _fitchi_, which rarely has any  dark marks on the ventral surface. 5) The dorsal stripe consistently  involves the middorsal scale row and the adjacent half of the next row  on each side, and is bright yellow in _fitchi_, but in _parietalis_  it may be slightly wider, may be duller with more dusky suffusion, and  its edges may be less sharply defined.      INTERMEDIATE AND ATYPICAL POPULATIONS    Of many specimens examined from eastern Oregon, Idaho, Utah, Wyoming  and Colorado, few were typical of either _parietalis_ or _fitchi_.  Many were intermediate in some respects or showed a composite  of characters of the two subspecies. No well-defined belt of  intergradation exists, but the transition extends over more than a  thousand miles, with local populations somewhat isolated and slightly  differentiated along divergent lines. In view of this situation  some plausibility could be claimed for any of several dividing lines  between the subspecies. However, by far the most logical division  is the Continental Divide; south of the Teton Range it constitutes  a broad barrier separating eastern and western populations. Across  Montana and Canada also it constitutes a more or less formidable  barrier, with high altitudes and cold climates that probably are  limiting to garter snakes. With few exceptions the snakes from east of  the Continental Divide are more nearly like _parietalis_ in the sum of  their characters whereas those from west of the Divide are more nearly  like _fitchi_.    In the Teton Range and in Yellowstone National Park these garter  snakes occur in headwater streams up to the Continental Divide.  KU 27956 from Two Ocean Lake 3-1/2 miles northeast of Moran, Teton  County, Wyoming, agrees in its characters with _fitchi_, having the  red lateral marks small and inconspicuous, discernible only on the  anterior half of the body. The dorsolateral area is dark, almost  black. The ventrals lack dark markings.    In Utah, populations of _sirtalis_ occur in the drainages of the Bear,  Weber and Sevier rivers and other smaller streams of the western  half of the state. Obviously the species invaded Utah from the north,  probably at a time when Lake Bonneville, the predecessor of the  present Great Salt Lake, drained into the Snake River of Idaho.  Van Denburgh and Slevin (1918:190) separated from their western  \"_concinnus_\" and \"_infernalis_\" and allocated to _parietalis_ the  populations of Utah and southeastern Idaho, but presumably these  authors were not familiar with typical _parietalis_ of the Mid-west.  Subsequent authors (Wright and Wright, 1957:834; Stebbins, 1954:505;  Conant, 1958:328) have followed this arrangement. A re-examination of  specimens from Utah, including living individuals collected at Bear  Lake in the summer of 1959, indicates that they should be assigned to  _fitchi_ rather than to _parietalis_.    Likewise various specimens from the drainage basin of the Snake River  in Idaho are predominantly _fitchi_ in the sum of their characters,  although they differ from that subspecies in its most typical form and  resemble _parietalis_ in some respects. KU 23133 from two miles east  of Notus, Canyon County, Idaho, has the red crescents on the lower  part of the sides (between scale rows six and seven) consistently  developed on the anterior half of the body. KU 21873, a large female  from Bannock County, Idaho, is exceptional in having small lateral  black spots on the ventrals, resembling _parietalis_ most closely in  this respect. Also, it has the red lateral crescents unusually well  developed; the first three series are conspicuous, those of the fourth  series are consistently developed, and those of the fifth series show  occasionally.    Forty-five specimens in the University of Colorado Museum from  northwestern Colorado were subjected to pattern analysis. In three  specimens the dorsolateral black area between the dorsal stripe and  the lateral stripe on each side has no markings, and in eight others  there is only an occasional fleck or crescent on the skin between the  sixth and seventh scale rows. All others have the normal complement of  dorsolateral crescents or flecks between the scales of rows three and  four, four and five, and five and six. But, these specimens vary  in extent of development of the crescents in the upper half of the  dorsolateral area on each side--between scale rows six and seven,  seven and eight, and eight and nine. Only six snakes show traces of  the crescents of the uppermost series (between scale rows eight and  nine). Development of these crescents is variable but in all the  specimens the crescents are confined to the anterior half of the body.  The crescents between rows six and seven and between seven and eight  are present in 20 specimens and in ten of these the crescents are  conspicuous and regularly arranged, often meeting and consequently  form H-shaped markings. In most of the snakes the crescents are best  developed in the second fifth of the body and disappear posteriorly.  In five of the twenty, crescents between rows six and seven are fairly  regular, but those between rows seven and eight are few and appear  only sporadically. In eight specimens there are no crescents between  either rows seven and eight or eight and nine. In eight others the  crescents between rows six and seven are likewise absent, and only the  crescents between rows three to six are present.    These specimens from Colorado also differ from typical _parietalis_ in  having the black spots on the anterolateral edges of the ventrals less  developed. In three of the 45 these spots are lacking entirely and in  four others they are few and small. In the majority of specimens the  spots are from 1/4 to 1/5 the length of the ventrals. In approximately  one-third of the specimens the spots are absent posterior to mid-body.  In five specimens obtained at Sheridan Lake, Pennington County, South  Dakota, in the Black Hills in August, 1960, dorsolateral areas are  dark with red crescents small and inconspicuous, and with black spots  either lacking from the ventrals or only faintly developed. In two  specimens from Sundance, Crook County, northeastern Wyoming, the red  crescents are small and inconspicuous also. In one of these specimens,  KU 28028, small black spots are present in the corners of the  ventrals, but in the other, KU 23654, the spots are absent.    In having the dorsolateral area consistently black, with the three  uppermost series of red crescents reduced or absent, and in having the  ventral black spots reduced or absent, these specimens from Colorado,  Wyoming, and South Dakota differ from more eastern and more typical  _parietalis_, and tend toward _fitchi_, even more strongly than some  Idaho specimens tend toward _parietalis_. Nevertheless, all things  considered, the Continental Divide is the most logical boundary  between the two subspecies, even though occasional individuals and  even local populations deviate from the general trend of characters  from east to west.

No specimens were found when the type locality  was revisited in August, 1966.    Duellman (1960) placed _Hyla pinorum_ Taylor in the synonymy of  _Ptychohyla leonhardschultzei_ Ahl. At that time only the holotype, a  female, of _H. pinorum_ was known. In 1964 Kraig Adler and I  independently collected frogs and associated tadpoles in Guerrero that  subsequently proved to be _Hyla pinorum_ and provided evidence that  _Hyla pinorum_ is not conspecific with _Ptychohyla leonhardschultzei_.    The specific name _pellita_ is Latin, meaning covered with skin, and is  here used in reference to the complete concealment of the tympanum  beneath the skin.      Hyla siopela new species    Plate 18    _Holotype._--Adult male, KU 100981, from a small stream on the west  slope of Cofre de Perote, Veracruz, Mexico, elevation 2500-2550 meters;  obtained on July 30, 1966, by William E. Duellman.    _Paratypes._--KU 100976-80, 100982-5, same locality, date, and  collector; KU 105628-9, same locality, obtained on June 18, 1966, by  Howard L. Freeman; UIMNH 57687-57701, same locality, obtained on July  30-31, 1964, by Macreay J. Landy and John D. Lynch.    _Diagnosis._--A member of the _Hyla bistincta_ group characterized by  truncate snout with short rostral keel; fingers having little webbing  and bearing large discs; axillary membrane absent; thoracic fold weak;  prepollex large, flat, bearing small nuptial spines; vocal slits absent;  dorsum green or tan with small irregular dark spots; flanks mottled.    _Description of holotype._--Adult male having a snout-vent length of  44.3 mm.; tibia length 21.1 mm., 47.6 per cent of snout-vent length;  foot length (measured from proximal edge of inner metatarsal tubercle to  tip of longest toe) 20.4 mm., 47.2 per cent of snout-vent length; head  length 13.4 mm., 30.2 per cent of snout-vent length; head width 13.7  mm., 30.9 per cent of snout-vent length. Snout in lateral profile  truncate, in dorsal profile truncate with weak vertical rostral keel;  canthus angular; loreal region slightly concave; lips thick, not  flaring; snout short; nostrils barely protuberant, directed  dorsolaterally, situated about four-fifths distance from anterior corner  of eye to tip of snout; internarial distance 3.6 mm.; internarial area  not depressed; top of head slightly convex; interorbital distance 4.9  mm., 35.8 per cent of width of head; width of eyelid 3.5 mm., 26.0 per  cent of width of head. Diameter of eye 4.7 mm.; heavy dermal fold  curving posteroventrally from posterior corner of eye, covering upper  one-third of tympanum, to insertion of arm; tympanum barely distinct,  its diameter 2.2 mm., 46.8 per cent that of eye, separated from eye by  distance equal to half again diameter of tympanum.    Axillary membrane absent; thoracic fold weak; arms moderately robust;  fold on wrist heavy; fingers long, slender; length of fingers from  shortest to longest, 1-2-4-3; discs large, that on third finger as large  as tympanum; subarticular tubercles moderately small, round, none bifid;  supernumerary tubercles small, some barely distinguishable, in single  row on proximal segment of each digit; prepollex greatly enlarged, flat  ventrally, bearing nuptial excrescence composed of minute horny  spinules; webbing between first two fingers vestigial; web connecting  other fingers at bases of penultimate phalanges of second and fourth,  and base of antepenultimate phalanx of third fingers. Heels overlap by  about one-third length of shank when hind limbs adpressed; tibiotarsal  articulation extends to posterior edge of orbit; transverse dermal fold  on heel; tarsal fold thin, distinct, extending length of tarsus; inner  metatarsal tubercle large, elongate, flat, visible from above; outer  metatarsal tubercle absent; toes moderately long, slender; length of  toes from shortest to longest, 1-2-3-5-4; discs slightly smaller than  those on fingers; subarticular tubercles moderately small, round;  supernumerary tubercles small, in single row on proximal segment of each  digit; toes about two-thirds webbed; webbing extends from middle of  penultimate phalanx of first toe to base of penultimate phalanx of  second, from middle of penultimate of second to middle of  antepenultimate of third, from middle of penultimate of third to middle  of antepenultimate of fourth to middle of penultimate phalanx of fifth  toe.    Anal opening directed posteriorly at level of mid-thigh; anal sheath  short. Skin granular on chin, belly, and posteroventral surfaces of  thighs, smooth elsewhere. Tongue broadly cordiform, notched posteriorly,  barely free behind. Prevomerine teeth 4-4, situated on posteromedially  inclined elevations between small ovoid choanae. Vocal slits absent.    Color (in preservative): dull grayish brown above with small,  irregularly-shaped black spots on head, back, and limbs; flanks gray  mottled with creamy tan; anterior and posterior surfaces of thighs tan;  belly dull creamy tan; throat marked with gray blotches; anal region and  posterodorsal surfaces of thighs marked with small white spots.    Color (in life): dorsum pale green with black spots and reticulations;  flanks mottled dark brown and creamy white; outer edges of feet silvery  white with brown spots; anterior and posterior surfaces of thighs dull  brown; webbing and first three toes dull yellowish tan; belly creamy  gray; throat silvery white, mottled with gray; iris dull bronze-color  with black reticulations; palpebral membrane clear.    _Variation._--The snout-vent length in seven adult males is 47.2-50.0  mm., and in five females, 45.1-52.5 mm. In neither sex do the average  proportions differ noticeably from those of the holotype, except that  the tympanum is relatively larger in females. The ratio of the diameter  of the tympanum to that of the eye is 0.363-0.468 (mean 0.438) in males  and 0.500-0.545 (mean 0.516) in females. The average number of  prevomerine teeth in males is 7.9, in females 8.4.    In life dorsal coloration varied from pale green to olive-green with  darker green or black flecks or reticulations, or pinkish tan to brown  with dark brown flecks or reticulations. Some preserved specimens have  relatively few dark flecks, whereas in most specimens the dorsum is  heavily marked. All specimens have some white markings above the anus  and on the posterodorsal surfaces of the thighs, but in some individuals  the white flecks are expanded and interconnected forming an irregular  white line.    Juveniles have a notably different coloration in life. The dorsum is  uniform pale green; the anterior and posterior surfaces of the thighs,  fingers, first three toes, and webbing are deep yellow. The anal stripe  is creamy white, and the flanks are pale gray with black flecks. The  upper lip, supratympanic fold, and canthal stripe are a bronze color.  The belly is pale yellow with a silvery cast on the throat. Juveniles  having snout-vent lengths from 24.5 to 36.6 mm. are so colored in life,  and uniform dark bluish gray dorsally in preservative.    _Comparisons._--The absence of a quadratojugal and the presence of a  greatly enlarged, non-projecting prepollex place _Hyla siopela_ in the  _Hyla bistincta_ group (see Duellman, 1964, and Adler, 1965). The  presence of a rostral keel separates _Hyla siopela_ from other members  of the _Hyla bistincta_ group, which is composed of two species having  long anal sheaths (_bistincta_ and _pentheter_), two small species  having axillary membranes and lacking nuptial excrescences in breeding  males (_charadricola_ and _chryses_), and three species (_crassa_,  _pachyderma_, and _robertsorum_) having short heads, round snouts, short  anal sheaths, and nuptial excrescences in breeding males. _Hyla siopela_  differs from the last three species in the shape of the snout and from  each in certain structural features; _H. crassa_ has fully webbed feet;  _H. pachyderma_ has large nuptial spines, and _H. robertsorum_ has more  webbing and a shorter tarsal fold. Furthermore, the venter in _H.  robertsorum_ is brown with creamy white flecks.    In structure and coloration _H. arborescandens_ resembles _siopela_, but  the former is smaller, and males of _arborescandens_ have vocal slits.    _Remarks._--This description brings to eight the number of species now  recognized in the _Hyla bistincta_ group. _Hyla siopela_ is most closely  related to _Hyla robertsorum_ from the high mountains of the Sierra  Madre Oriental in northern Puebla and eastern Hidalgo. Possibly the four  species now recognized in the _crassa_ subgroup (_crassa_, _pachyderma_,  _robertsorum_, and _siopela_) are only subspecies of a single species,  but differences in the amount of webbing in _crassa_ and the nature of  the nuptial excrescenses in _pachyderma_ indicate that they are distinct  species.    The type locality of _Hyla siopela_ is a small stream cascading down the  western slope of Cofre de Perote; the lower reaches of the stream can be  reached by a dirt road leading east from the village of Perote for about  2 kilometers to a small park. The frogs were found in the stream at  elevations of 50 to 100 meters higher than the park. The stream flows  through a ravine supporting open, dry pine forest. Although the stream  was searched thoroughly in February, 1966, no frogs were found. In July,  1966, adults and juveniles were found in crevices and under overhanging  rocks behind small cascades and waterfalls by day and sitting on rocks  and branches in the spray of cascades at night.    The specific name _siopela_ is derived from the Greek _siopelos_,  meaning silent, and alludes to the absence of a voice in this species.      Hyla altipotens new species    Plate 19"]]]
