If I could read minds, just as soon as anybody found it  out, he'd be afraid of me, or hate me, like the book said, and you  said, too. If you believed it, you'd do something like having me  locked up in a hospital, maybe, instead of....\"    \"Instead of what, Lucilla?\"    \"Instead of being patient, and nice, and helping me see how silly I've  been.\" She reached out impulsively to touch his hand, then withdrew  her own, feeling somewhat foolish when he made no move to respond.  Her relief was too great, however, to be contained in silence. \"Way  back the first time I came in, almost, you said that before we  finished therapy, you'd know me better than I knew myself. I didn't  believe you--maybe I didn't want to--but I begin to think you were  right. Lot of times, lately, you've answered a question before I even  asked it. Sometimes you haven't even bothered to answer--you've just  sat there in your big brown chair and I've lain here on the couch, and  we've gone through something together without using words at all....\"  She had started out almost gaily, the words spilling over each other  in their rush to be said, but bit by bit she slowed down, then  faltered to a stop. After she had stopped talking altogether, she  could still hear her last few phrases, repeated over and over, like an  echo that refused to die. (Answered ... before I even asked ...  without using words at all ... without using words....)    She could almost taste the terror that clogged her throat and dried her  lips. \"You do believe it. And you could have me locked up. Only ...  only....\" Fragments of thought, splinters of words, and droplets of  silence spun into a kaleidoscopic jumble, shifted infinitesimally, and  fell into an incredible new pattern. Understanding displaced terror and  was, in turn, displaced by indignation. She stared accusingly at her  interrogator. \"But you look just like ... just like anybody.\"    \"You expected perhaps three legs or a long bushy tail or teeth like  that textbook tiger?\"    \"And you're a psychiatrist!\"    \"What else? Would you have talked to me like this across a grocery  counter, Lucilla? Or listened to me, if I'd been driving a bus or  filling a prescription? Would I have found the others in a bowling  alley or a business office?\"    \"Then there are ... others?\" She let out her breath on a long sigh  involuntarily glancing again at the framed picture. \"Only I love Paul,  and he isn't ... he can't....\"    \"Nor can Carol.\" His eyes were steady on hers, yet she felt as if he  were looking through and beyond her. For no reason at all, she  strained her ears for the sound of footsteps or the summons of a  voice. \"Where do you suppose the second little blob of protoplasm with  legs came from?\" Dr. Andrews asked. \"And the third? If that ape who  found he could stand erect had walked lonesomely off into the sunset  like a second-rate actor on a late, late show, where do you suppose  you'd be today?\"    He broke off abruptly and watched with Lucilla as the office door  edged open. The small girl who inched her way around it wore blue  jeans and a pony tail rather than an organdy frock and curls, but her  pixie smile matched that of the girl in the photograph Lucilla had  glanced at again and again.    \"You wanted me, Daddy?\" she asked, but she looked toward Lucilla.    \"I thought you'd like to meet someone with the same nickname as  yours,\" Dr. Andrews said, rising to greet her. \"Lucky, meet Lucky.\"    \"Hello,\" the child said, then her smile widened. \"Hello!\" (But I don't  have to say it, do I? I can talk to you just the way I talk to Daddy  and Uncle Whitney and Big Bill).    \"Hello yourself,\" said Lucilla. This time when the corners of her  mouth began to tick upward, she made no attempt to stop them. (Of  course you can, darling. And I can answer you the same way, and you'll  hear me.)    Dr. Andrews reached for the open pack of cigarettes on his deck. (Is  this strictly a private conversation, girls, or can I get in on it,  too?)    (It's unpolite to interrupt, Daddy.)    (He's not exactly interrupting--it was his conversation to begin  with!)    Dr. Andrews' receptionist paused briefly beside the still-open office  door. None of them heard either her gentle rap or the soft click of  the latch slipping into place when she pushed the door shut.    Nor did she hear them.           *       *       *       *       *"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3029"],[0,"Real Soldiers of Fortune (#4)"],[1," more distinction for their attacks on Fleet Street bars than they are  likely to earn on Servian battle-fields, but then I must not anticipate  history.\"    Another paper tells that at the end of the first week of his service as  a Servian officer, MacIver had enlisted ninety men, but that they were  scattered about the town, many without shelter and rations:    \"He assembled his men on the Rialto, and in spite of official  expostulation, the men were marched up to the Minister's four  abreast--and they marched fairly well, making a good show. The War  Minister was taken by storm, and at once granted everything. It has  raised the English colonel's popularity with his men to fever heat.\"    This from the _Times_, London:    \"Our Belgrade correspondent telegraphs last night:    \"'There is here at present a gentleman named MacIver. He came from  England to offer himself and his sword to the Servians. The Servian  Minister of War gave him a colonel's commission. This morning I saw him  drilling about one hundred and fifty remarkably fine-looking fellows,  all clad in a good serviceable cavalry uniform, and he has horses.\"'    Later we find that:    \"Colonel MacIver's Legion of Cavalry, organizing here, now numbers over  two hundred men.\"    And again:    \"Prince Nica, a Roumanian cousin of the Princess Natalie of Servia, has  joined Colonel MacIver's cavalry corps.\"    Later, in the _Court Journal_, October 28, 1876, we read:    \"Colonel MacIver, who a few years ago was very well known in military  circles in Dublin, now is making his mark with the Servian army. In  the war against the Turks, he commands about one thousand Russo-Servian  cavalry.\"    He was next to receive the following honors:    \"Colonel MacIver has been appointed commander of the cavalry of the  Servian armies on the Morava and Timok, and has received the Cross of  the Takovo Order from General Tchemaieff for gallant conduct in the  field, and the gold medal for valor.\"    Later we learn from the _Daily News_:    \"Mr. Lewis Farley, Secretary of the 'League in Aid of Christians of  Turkey,' has received the following letter, dated Belgrade, October 10,  1876:    \"'DEAR SIR: In reference to the embroidered banner so kindly worked by  an English lady and forwarded by the League to Colonel MacIver, I have  great pleasure in conveying to you the following particulars. On Sunday  morning, the flag having been previously consecrated by the archbishop,  was conducted by a guard of honor to the palace, and Colonel MacIver,  in the presence of Prince Milan and a numerous suite, in the name and  on behalf of yourself and the fair donor, delivered it into the hands  of the Princess Natalie. The gallant Colonel wore upon this occasion his  full uniform as brigade commander and chief of cavalry of the Servian  army, and bore upon his breast the 'Gold Cross of Takovo' which he  received after the battles of the 28th and 30th of September, in  recognition of the heroism and bravery he displayed upon these eventful  days. The beauty of the decoration was enhanced by the circumstances  of its bestowal, for on the evening of the battle of the 30th, General  Tchernaieff approached Colonel MacIver, and, unclasping the cross from  his own breast, placed it upon that of the Colonel.    \"'(Signed.) HUGH JACKSON,    \"'_Member of Council of the League_.\"    In Servia and in the Servian army MacIver reached what as yet is the  highest point of his career, and of his life the happiest period.    He was _general de brigade_, which is not what we know as a brigade  general, but is one who commands a division, a major-general. He was a  great favorite both at the palace and with the people, the pay was good,  fighting plentiful, and Belgrade gay and amusing. Of all the places  he has visited and the countries he has served, it is of this Balkan  kingdom that the general seems to speak most fondly and with the  greatest feeling. Of Queen Natalie he was and is a most loyal and  chivalric admirer, and was ever ready, when he found any one who did  not as greatly respect the lady, to offer him the choice of swords or  pistols. Even for Milan he finds an extenuating word.    After Servia the general raised more foreign legions, planned further  expeditions; in Central America reorganized the small armies of the  small republics, served as United States Consul, and offered his sword  to President McKinley for use against Spain. But with Servia the most  active portion of the life of the general ceased, and the rest has been  a repetition of what went before. At present his time is divided between  New York and Virginia, where he has been offered an executive position  in the approaching Jamestown Exposition. Both North and South he has  many friends, many admirers. But his life is, and, from the nature of  his profession, must always be, a lonely one.    While other men remain planted in one spot, gathering about them a home,  sons and daughters, an income for old age, MacIver is a rolling stone,  a piece of floating sea-weed; as the present King of England called him  fondly, \"that vagabond soldier.\"    To a man who has lived in the saddle and upon transports, \"neighbor\"  conveys nothing, and even \"comrade\" too often means one who is no longer  living.    With the exception of the United States, of which he now is a  naturalized citizen, the general has fought for nearly every country in  the world, but if any of those for which he lost his health and blood,  and for which he risked his life, remembers him, it makes no sign. And  the general is too proud to ask to be remembered. To-day there is no  more interesting figure than this man who in years is still young enough  to lead an army corps, and who, for forty years, has been selling his  sword and risking his life for presidents, pretenders, charlatans, and  emperors.    He finds some mighty changes: Cuba, which he fought to free, is free;  men of the South, with whom for four years he fought shoulder to  shoulder, are now wearing the blue; the empire of Mexico, for which he  fought, is a republic; the empire of France, for which he fought, is a  republic; the empire of Brazil, for which he fought is a republic; the  dynasty in Servia, to which he owes his greatest honors, has been wiped  out by murder. From none of the eighteen countries he has served has he  a pension, berth, or billet, and at sixty he finds himself at home in  every land, but with a home in none.    Still he has his sword, his blanket, and in the event of war, to obtain  a commission he has only to open his tin boxes and show the commissions  already won. Indeed, any day, in a new uniform, and under the Nineteenth  Flag, the general may again be winning fresh victories and honors.    And so, this brief sketch of him is left unfinished. We will mark  it--_To be continued_.          BARON JAMES HARDEN-HICKEY    THIS is an attempt to tell the story of Baron Harden-Hickey, the Man Who  Made Himself King, the man who was born after his time.    If the reader, knowing something of the strange career of Harden-Hickey,  wonders why one writes of him appreciatively rather than in amusement,  he is asked not to judge Harden-Hickey as one judges a contemporary.    Harden-Hickey, in our day, was as incongruous a figure as was the  American at the Court of King Arthur; he was as unhappily out of the  picture as would be Cyrano de Bergerac on the floor of the Board  of Trade. Judged, as at the time he was judged, by writers of comic  paragraphs, by presidents of railroads, by amateur \"statesmen\" at  Washington, Harden-Hickey was a joke. To the vacant mind of the village  idiot, Rip Van Winkle returning to Falling Water also was a joke. The  people of our day had not the time to understand Harden-Hickey; they  thought him a charlatan, half a dangerous adventurer and half a fool;  and Harden-Hickey certainly did not under stand them. His last words,  addressed to his wife, showed this. They were: \"I would rather die a  gentleman than live a blackguard like your father.\"    As a matter of fact, his father-in-law, although living under the  disadvantage of being a Standard Oil magnate, neither was, nor is, a  blackguard, and his son-in-law had been treated by him generously  and with patience. But for the duellist and soldier of fortune it was  impossible to sympathize with a man who took no greater risk in life  than to ride on one of his own railroads, and of the views the two men  held of each other, that of John H. Flagler was probably the fairer and  the more kindly.    Harden-Hickey was one of the most picturesque, gallant, and pathetic  adventurers of our day; but Flagler also deserves our sympathy.    For an unimaginative and hard-working Standard Oil king to have a  D'Artagnan thrust upon him as a son-in-law must be trying.    James A. Harden-Hickey, James the First of Trinidad, Baron of the  Holy Roman Empire, was born on December 8, 1854. As to the date all  historians agree; as to where the important event took place they  differ. That he was born in France his friends are positive, but at the  time of his death in El Paso the San Francisco papers claimed him as a  native of California. All agree that his ancestors were Catholics and  Royalists who left Ireland with the Stuarts when they sought refuge in  France. The version which seems to be the most probable is that he was  born in San Francisco, where as one of the early settlers, his father,  E. C. Hickey, was well known, and that early in his life, in order to  educate him, the mother took him to Europe.    There he was educated at the Jesuit College at Namur, then at Leipsic,  and later entered the Military College of St. Cyr.    James the First was one of those boys who never had the misfortune to  grow up. To the moment of his death, in all he planned you can trace the  effects of his early teachings and environment; the influences of the  great Church that nursed him, and of the city of Paris, in"]]]
