At about this time it was that Tara noticed a  kind of white sediment, quite inoffensive and not at all bad to  eat, in her morning milk dish; and this she welcomed, because in  some dim way it was connected in her mind with happy old days that  came before her parting with the Master, when she had lived with  him in a place not unlike this clean, fragrant down-land, which  stretched now, far as one could see on either hand, outside the  garden and the orchard, all about this new home, which Tara found  so good. (At certain times and in certain circumstances, some  breeders of big hounds believe in mixing precipitated phosphate of  lime with ordinary food, for the sake of its bone-forming  properties.)    To describe one half the many delightful incidents and occupations  which made the days pass quickly for Tara now, would require a  volume; but as time went the great hound tended to become less  active. There were any number of rabbits on the Downs beyond the  orchard, and at first, in her before-breakfast ramble with the  Master, Tara used greatly to enjoy running down one or two of  these. But after a little time the Master seemed to make a point of  discouraging this, even to the extent of resting a hand lightly  upon Tara's collar as she walked beside him; and, gradually, she  herself lost inclination for the sport, except where greatly  tempted, as by a rabbit's jumping suddenly for its burrow close  beside her. In the afternoon, when Tara generally went out with the  Mistress of the Kennels for a good long round, she wore a lead on  her collar now, so that even sudden inspirations to galloping were  checked in the bud, and a sedate gait was maintained always.  Without troubling her head to think much about it, Tara had a  generally contented feeling that these precautions were wise and  good. The same prudent feeling influenced her in the matter of  meals now. Though she frequently felt that she would much rather be  without her morning milk, she always lapped it carefully up, and  conscientiously swabbed the dish bright and dry with her great red  tongue. She could not have explained, even to herself, just why she  did these things; but sub-conscious understanding and fore-knowledge   play a large part in a Wolfhound's life, and so does sub-conscious  memory and the inherited thing we call instinct. Without considering  prehistoric ancestry, there were fifteen hundred years of lineal  Irish Wolfhound ancestry behind Tara; her own family dated back so far.  For instance:--    In the year 391, seven centuries before the Conqueror landed in  England, there was a Roman Consul whose name was Quintus Aurelius  Symmachus. In a letter that he wrote to his brother Flavianus, he  said:--    \"In order to win the favour of the Roman people for our Quaestor,  you have been a generous and diligent provider of novel  contributions to our solemn shows and games, as is proved by your  gift of seven Irish hounds. All Rome viewed them with wonder, and  fancied they must have been brought hither in iron cages. For such  a gift, I tender you the greatest possible thanks.\"    [Illustration]    That these Irish Wolfhounds of fifteen hundred years ago were big  and fierce, and brave and strong, you may know from the conviction  of the Roman people that they must have been brought in iron cages.  Also, friend Symmachus writes in other letters of the boars, and  lions, and the armed Saxons provided to do battle with the Irish  Wolfhounds. Also, he shows the quaintest sort of annoyance over the  fact that some twenty-nine of these perverse Saxons, who were  obtained to fight the Irish Wolfhounds, cut their throats on the  night before the games--their own throats, I mean--and so spoiled  sport for the holiday-loving Romans. In the first century of our  era, Mesroida, the King of the Leinstermen, had an Irish Wolfhound  which was so mighty in battle that it was said to defend the whole  province, and to fill all Ireland with its fame. For this hound,  six thousand cows, besides other property, were offered by the King  of Connaught, and about the same price was offered by the King of  Ulster. Irish Wolfhounds fought regularly in battle, through the  early centuries of our era; and fearsome warriors they were. Right  down to the period of a couple of centuries ago, a leash of Irish  Wolfhounds was considered a fitting and acceptable present for one  monarch, or lord, to offer to another king or great noble; while  from the earliest times, down to the day of Buffon, and, in our own  time, \"Stonehenge,\" the naturalists have written of the Irish  Wolfhound as the greatest, that is finest, and \"tallest of all  dogs.\"    But it was not alone in such matters as refraining from violent  exercise, and the taking of food whether inclined for it or not,  that a sort of prescience guided beautiful Tara at this time in her  new home beside the Sussex Downs. There came a morning when, as she  strolled about the strip of shrubbery and orchard which lay between  the stabling and the house, it occurred to her that it would be a  good thing to dig a hole somewhere in the ground; the sort of hole  or cave into which a great hound like herself could creep for  shelter if need be; a cave in which she could live for a while.  Tara did not know that the Master was watching her at this time;  but he was, and there was a sympathetic and understanding sort of  smile on his face, when Tara forced her way in between two large  shrubs, and began excavating. The earth was soft and moist there,  and Tara's powerful fore-feet scooped it out in regular shovelfuls,  for her hind feet to scatter in an earthy rain behind her. She made  a cavern as big as herself, and then divided the rest of the day  between the beautiful big dais in the coach-house, all dry, and  sweet, and clean, and her fragrant, carpeted great bed in \"th'old  parish room.\" Lying there at her ease, with one eye on the Master's  shoulder, where it showed round the side of his high-topped  writing-table, Tara wondered vaguely why she had troubled to dig  that hole in the wet earth. But the Master knew all about it,  though he could not claim to have fifteen hundred years of  Wolfhound ancestry behind him, and he seemed quite satisfied.    On the following day Tara gravely inspected the hole she had dug,  and decided that it was not altogether good. So she went and dug  another in a rather more secluded spot; and then came back and  dozed comfortably at the Master's feet while he wrote. Later on in  the day she strolled round the whole premises, and inspected  carefully the various places in which, during the past week or so,  she had buried large bones. The next day found Tara extremely  restless and rather unhappy. She had an uncomfortable feeling that  she had forgotten some important matter which required attention.  In her effort to recall what the thing could be that she had  neglected, she dug two or three more holes, and finally, a thing  she had never thought of doing before, took one of the Master's  slippers--always a singularly dear and comforting piece of property  to Tara--and buried it about two feet deep in a little ditch. She  felt vaguely ashamed about this, though she had no idea that the  Master had watched her taking the slipper away; but she could not  bring herself to return the slipper, because of the hazy need she  felt for laying up treasure and taking every sort of precaution  against a rainy day.    During the afternoon, Tara's general uneasiness increased. She felt  thoroughly uncomfortable and worried; convinced that she had  forgotten some really important matter, and disinclined either to  go out or to stay in. Fifty times the Master opened and closed  doors to suit her changing whims, until poor Tara felt quite  ashamed of herself, though still quite unable to settle down. As a  sort of savoury after dinner, the Master gave her some silky, warm  olive oil; an odd thing to take, Tara thought, but upon the whole  pleasing and comforting. Then, suddenly, and as she woke from a  doze of about ten seconds' duration, Tara decided that it would be  a good thing to tear a hole in the middle of the tight-stretched  old carpet on her big bed. She got to work at once, pleased to  think that she had remembered this little matter in good time, and  was distinctly disappointed when the Master came and sat beside her  on the edge of the bed and playfully held her paws, after gently  lowering her into a lying position. Still, it was good to have him  sit there and chat, as he did for some little time, rubbing the  backs of her ears, and being generally sociable. He was the only  human creature, with the exception of the Mistress of the Kennels,  who had ever really chatted with Tara.    While Tara was gradually forgetting her desire to tear the bed  covering, a cart stopped outside the house, and a whiff, the hint  of an odour, drifted in through the open door of the den, and  caused the great hound's nose to wrinkle ominously. Next moment she  gave a savage bark, deep, threatening, and sonorous, and sprang to  her feet. She was not quite sure what ailed her, but she was  conscious of an access of great anger, of passionate hostility.  After soothing her, the Master carefully locked the door of the  den, and then went round through the gateway leading to the front  of the house, and took delivery of a large hamper from the station  carrier. Then the Mistress of the Kennels came and sat in the  Master's den for perhaps half an hour, while he was busy down at  the coach-house with the hamper, and a lantern, and a dish of dog's  dinner of a milky, sloppy sort.

For, at any rate, by these  systematic, imitative repetitions they had secured the first requisite  of all music, coherence. This principle, once it was sanctioned by  growing musical instinct, and approved by convention, was developed  into such well-known types of polyphonic music as the Canon, the  Invention and the Fugue; terms which will be fully explained later on.  It is of more than passing interest to realize that these structural  principles of music were worked out in the same locality--Northern  France and the Netherlands, and by kindred intellects--as witnessed  the growth of Gothic architecture; and there is a fundamental affinity  between the interweavings of polyphonic or, as it is often called,  _contrapuntal_[14] music and the stone traceries in medieval  cathedrals. During the 13th and 14th centuries northern France, with  Paris as its centre, was the most cultivated part of Europe, and the  Flemish cities of Cambrai, Tournai, Louvain and Antwerp will always be  renowned in the history of art, as the birthplace of Gothic  architecture, of modern painting and of polyphonic music.[15] A great  deal of the impetus towards the systematic repetition of the voice  parts must have been caused by practical necessity (thus justifying  the old adage); for, before the days of printed music, or even of a  well-established tradition--when everything had to be laboriously  written out or transmitted orally--whole compositions could be  rendered by the singers through the simple device of remembering the  introductory theme and joining in from memory whenever their turn  came. Compositions in fact were often so recorded.[16] The following  old English round (circa 1609) shows clearly how the voices entered in  rotation.    [Music:    1 Three blind mice, three blind mice    2 ran around thrice, ran around thrice; The    3 miller and his merry old wife ne'er laugh'd so much in all their  life.]    For a Round in strict canonic imitation by the famous English composer  William Byrd (1542-1623) see the Supplement, Example No. 2. In due  time singers of that period became likewise very proficient in  improvising free parts about a given melody or _cantus firmus_, a  practice indicated by the term \"musica ficta\" which was beneficial in  stimulating the imagination to a genuine musical activity.    [Footnote 10: In comparatively recent times the term has been widened  to include music in which there is one _chief_ melody to which other  portions of the musical texture are subordinate; _e.g._, the  homophonic style of Chopin in whose works the chief melody, often in  the upper voice, seems to float on underlying waves of sound.]    [Footnote 11: For a complete account of these early attempts which  finally led to part-writing see Chapter IV in the first volume of the  _Oxford History of Music_.]    [Footnote 12: An historical account of this development as far as it  is ascertainable may be found in the fifth chapter of Pratt's _History  of Music_.]    [Footnote 13: Consult the article on the Round in _Grove's  Dictionary_.]    [Footnote 14: A rather crude English adaptation of the Latin term  \"Punctus contra punctum\" which refers to the notes as punct[=u]s  (plural) or dots which were pricked with a stylus into the medieval  manuscripts. In this phrase the emphasis is on the _contra_,  signifying a combination of _different_ melodies and rhythms, and  calling attention to that higher importance which, everywhere in art,  is caused by contrasted elements.]    [Footnote 15: For an interesting account of this tripartite activity  see Naumann's _History of Music_.]    [Footnote 16: See the facsimile of the original manuscript of \"_Sumer  is icumen in_\" cited in the first volume of the _Oxford History of  Music_, pp. 326-332.]    We can now begin to realize the importance of polyphonic music. In  fact, it is not too much to assert that _systematic repetition_ in  some form or other (several aspects of which we shall describe in due  season) is the most important constructive principle in music,  necessitated by the very nature of the material. This statement can be  corroborated by a glance at almost any page of music considered merely  as a _pattern_, quite regardless how the notes sound. We observe at  once that some portions of the page look much or exactly like other  portions. Frequently whole movements or long parts of a work are based  entirely upon some terse and characteristic motive. Famous examples of  this practise are the first movement of Beethoven's _Fifth Symphony in  C minor_ which, with certain subsidiary themes to afford contrast, is  entirely based on the motive:    [Music]    the Finale of Wagner's opera _The Valkyrie_ (see Supplement, Example  No. 3) the chief motive of which    [Music]    is presented in every phase of modulatory and rhythmic development,  and the middle portion of the _Reconnaissance_ from Schumann's  _Carnaval_ (see Supplement, Example No. 4.)    Music, just because its substance is so elusive and requires such  alert attention on the part of the listener, cannot continually  present new material[17] without becoming diffuse; but instead, must  make its impression by varied emphasis upon the main thought.  Otherwise it would become so discursive that one could not possibly  follow it. From these historical facts as to the structure of music  certain inferences may be drawn; the vital importance of which to the  listener can hardly be exaggerated. As polyphonic treatment (the  imitation and interweaving of independent melodic lines) is the  foundation of any large work of music, be it symphony, symphonic poem  or string quartet, so the listener must acquire what may be called a  _polyphonic ear_. For with the majority of listeners, the whole  difficulty and the cause of their dissatisfaction with so-called  \"classic music\" is merely lack of equipment. Everyone can hear the  tune in the soprano or upper voice, for the intensity of pitch makes  it stand out with telling effect; and, as a fact, many of the best  tunes in musical literature are so placed. But how about the tune when  it is in the _bass_ as is the case so frequently in Beethoven's  Symphonies or in Wagner's Operas? Some of the most eloquent parts of  the musical message are, indeed, often in the bass, the foundation  voice, and yet these are entirely ignored by the average listener.  Then what of the inner voices; and what--most important of all--when  there are beautiful melodies in _all parts_ of the musical fabric,  often sounding simultaneously, as in such well-known works as Cesar  Franck's _Symphony in D minor_ and Wagner's _Prelude to the  Mastersingers_! As we face these questions squarely the need for the  listener of special training in alertness and concentration is  self-evident. A very small proportion of those who attend a symphony  concert begin to get their money's worth--to put the matter on a  perfectly practical plane--for at least 50% of the musical structure  is presented to ears without capacity for receiving it. In regard to  any work of large dimensions the final test is this: can we sing all  the themes and follow them in their polyphonic development? Then only  are we really acquainted with the work; then only, in regard to  personal like or dislike, have we any right to pass judgment upon it.  The absurd attitude, far too common, of hasty, ill-considered  criticism is illustrated by the fact that while Brahms is said to have  worked for ten years on that Titanic creation, his _First Symphony_,  yet persons will hear it _once_ and have the audacity to say they do  not like it. As well stroll through Chartres Cathedral and say they  did not think much of it!    [Footnote 17: For a simple, charming example of persistent use of a  motive see Schumann's pianoforte piece _Kind im Einschlummern_, No. 12  of the _Kinderscenen_.]    We must now speak of the two other manifestations of the principle of  _repetition_. Fundamentally, to be sure, they are not connected with  polyphonic music; the third type, in fact,--restatement after  contrast--being instinctively worked out in the Folk-Song (as will be  made plain later) and definitely ratified as a structural principle by  the Italian opera composer Alessandro Scarlatti in the well-known Aria  da capo. These further applications of the principle of imitation are  _Transposition_, _i.e._, the repetition of the melodic outline, and  often of the whole harmonic fabric, by shifting it up or down the  scale; and the _Restatement_ of the original melody after an  intervening part in contrast, thus making a piece of music, the  formula for which may be indicated by A, B, A. Anyone at all familiar  with musical literature must have observed both of these devices for  securing coherence and organic unity; in fact, the principle of  restatement after contrast is at the foundation of any large work, and  supplies the connecting link between the structure of the Folk-Song  and that of the most elaborate modern music. A convincing illustration  of the use of Transposition may be found in Schumann's _Arabesque_,    [Music]    and in the opening theme of Beethoven's _Waldstein Sonata_, op. 53.    [Music]    It was a favorite device of Beethoven to impress the main theme upon  the hearer by definite repetitions on various degrees of the  scale.[18] For an elaborate example of Transposition nothing can  surpass the opening movement of Cesar Franck's _D Minor Symphony_, the  entire first part of which consists "]]]
