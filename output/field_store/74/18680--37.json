They rush into each other's arms and exchange cigarettes. And  the trains can't bear to part. And the station can't bear to part with  us. The officials tease themselves and us with the word _pronto_,  meaning _ready!_ Pronto! And again Pronto! And shrill whistles.  Anywhere else a train would go off its tormented head. But no! Here only  that angel's trump of an official little horn will do the business. And  get them to blow that horn if you can. They can't bear to part.           *       *       *       *       *    Rain, continual rain, a level grey wet sky, a level grey wet sea, a wet  and misty train winding round and round the little bays, diving through  tunnels. Ghosts of the unpleasant-looking Lipari islands standing a  little way out to sea, heaps of shadow deposited like rubbish heaps in  the universal greyness.           *       *       *       *       *    Enter more passengers. An enormously large woman with an extraordinarily  handsome face: an extraordinarily large man, quite young: and a  diminutive servant, a little girl-child of about thirteen, with a  beautiful face.--But the Juno--it is she who takes my breath away. She  is quite young, in her thirties still. She has that queenly stupid  beauty of a classic Hera: a pure brow with level dark brows, large,  dark, bridling eyes, a straight nose, a chiselled mouth, an air of  remote self-consciousness. She sends one's heart straight back to pagan  days. And--and--she is simply enormous, like a house. She wears a black  toque with sticking-up wings, and a black rabbit fur spread on her  shoulders. She edges her way in carefully: and once seated, is  terrified to rise to her feet. She sits with that motionlessness of her  type, closed lips, face muted and expressionless. And she expects me to  admire her: I can see that. She expects me to pay homage to her beauty:  just to that: not homage to herself, but to her as a _bel pezzo_. She  casts little aloof glances at me under her eyelids.    It is evident she is a country beauty become a _bourgeoise_. She speaks  unwillingly to the other squint-eyed passenger, a young woman who also  wears a black-rabbit fur, but without pretensions.    The husband of Juno is a fresh-faced bourgeois young fellow, and he also  is simply huge. His waistcoat would almost make the overcoat of the  fourth passenger, the unshaven companion of the squinting young woman.  The young Jupiter wears kid gloves: a significant fact here. He, too,  has pretensions. But he is quite affable with the unshaven one, and  speaks Italian unaffectedly. Whereas Juno speaks the dialect with  affectation.    No one takes any notice of the little maid. She has a gentle, virgin  moon-face, and those lovely grey Sicilian eyes that are translucent, and  into which the light sinks and becomes black sometimes, sometimes dark  blue. She carries the bag and the extra coat of the huge Juno, and sits  on the edge of the seat between me and the unshaven, Juno having  motioned her there with a regal inclination of the head.    The little maid is rather frightened. Perhaps she is an orphan  child--probably. Her nut-brown hair is smoothly parted and done in two  pigtails. She wears no hat, as is proper for her class. On her shoulders  one of those little knitted grey shoulder-capes that one associates with  orphanages. Her stuff dress is dark grey, her boots are strong.    The smooth, moon-like, expressionless virgin face, rather pale and  touching, rather frightened, of the girl-child. A perfect face from a  mediaeval picture. It moves one strangely. Why? It is so unconscious, as  we are conscious. Like a little muted animal it sits there, in distress.  She is going to be sick. She goes into the corridor and is sick--very  sick, leaning her head like a sick dog on the window-ledge. Jupiter  towers above her--not unkind, and apparently feeling no repugnance. The  physical convulsion of the girl does not affect him as it affects us. He  looks on unmoved, merely venturing to remark that she had eaten too much  before coming on to the train. An obviously true remark. After which he  comes and talks a few common-places to me. By and by the girl-child  creeps in again and sits on the edge of the seat facing Juno. But no,  says Juno, if she is sick she will be sick over me. So Jupiter  accommodatingly changes places with the girl-child, who is thus next to  me. She sits on the edge of the seat with folded little red hands, her  face pale and expressionless. Beautiful the thin line of her nut-brown  eyebrows, the dark lashes of the silent, pellucid dark eyes. Silent,  motionless, like a sick animal.    But Juno tells her to wipe her splashed boots. The child gropes for a  piece of paper. Juno tells her to take her pocket handkerchief. Feebly  the sick girl-child wipes her boots, then leans back. But no good. She  has to go in the corridor and be sick again.    After a while they all get out. Queer to see people so natural. Neither  Juno nor Jupiter is in the least unkind. He even seems kind. But they  are just not upset. Not half as upset as we are--the q-b wanting to  administer tea, and so on. We should have to hold the child's head. They  just quite naturally leave it alone to its convulsions, and are neither  distressed nor repelled. It just is so.    Their naturalness seems unnatural to us. Yet I am sure it is best.  Sympathy would only complicate matters, and spoil that strange, remote  virginal quality. The q-b says it is largely stupidity.           *       *       *       *       *    Nobody washes out the corner of the corridor, though we stop at  stations long enough, and there are two more hours journey. Train  officials go by and stare, passengers step over and stare, new-comers  stare and step over. Somebody asks _who_? Nobody thinks of just throwing  a pail of water. Why should they? It is all in the course of  nature.--One begins to be a bit chary of this same \"nature\", in the  south.           *       *       *       *       *    Enter two fresh passengers: a black-eyed, round-faced, bright-sharp man  in corduroys and with a gun, and a long-faced, fresh-colored man with  thick snowy hair, and a new hat and a long black overcoat of smooth  black cloth, lined with rather ancient, once expensive fur. He is  extremely proud of this long black coat and ancient fur lining.  Childishly proud he wraps it again over his knee, and gloats. The beady  black-eyes of the hunter look round with pleased alertness. He sits  facing the one in the overcoat, who looks like the last sprout of some  Norman blood. The hunter in corduroys beams abroad, with beady black  eyes in a round red face, curious. And the other tucks his fur-lined  long coat between his legs and gloats to himself: all to himself  gloating, and looking as if he were deaf. But no, he's not. He wears  muddy high-low boots.    At Termini it is already lamp-light. Business men crowd in. We get five  business men: all stout, respected Palermitans. The one opposite me has  whiskers, and a many-colored, patched traveling rug over his fat knees.  Queer how they bring that feeling of physical intimacy with them. You  are never surprised if they begin to take off their boots, or their  collar-and-tie. The whole world is a sort of bedroom to them. One  shrinks, but in vain.    There is some conversation between the black-eyed, beady hunter and the  business men. Also the young white-haired one, the aristocrat, tries to  stammer out, at great length, a few words. As far as I can gather the  young one is mad--or deranged--and the other, the hunter, is his keeper.  They are traveling over Europe together. There is some talk of \"the  Count\". And the hunter says the unfortunate \"has had an accident.\" But  that is a southern gentleness presumably, a form of speech. Anyhow it is  queer: and the hunter in his corduroys, with his round, ruddy face and  strange black-bright eyes and thin black hair is a puzzle to me, even  more than the albino, long-coated, long-faced, fresh-complexioned, queer  last remnant of a baron as he is. They are both muddy from the land, and  pleased in a little mad way of their own.    But it is half-past six. We are at Palermo, capital of Sicily. The  hunter slings his gun over his shoulder, I my knapsack, and in the  throng we all disappear, into the Via Maqueda.           *       *       *       *       *    Palermo has two great streets, the Via Maqueda, and the Corso, which  cross each other at right-angles. The Via Maqueda is narrow, with narrow  little pavements, and is always choked with carriages and  foot-passengers.    It had ceased raining. But the narrow road was paved with large, convex  slabs of hard stone, inexpressibly greasy. To cross the Via Maqueda  therefore was a feat. However, once accomplished, it was done. The near  end of the street was rather dark, and had mostly vegetable shops.  Abundance of vegetables--piles of white-and-green fennel, like celery,  and great sheaves of young, purplish, sea-dust-colored artichokes,  nodding their buds, piles of big radishes, scarlet and bluey purple,  carrots, long strings of dried figs, mountains of big oranges, scarlet  large peppers, a last slice of pumpkin, a great mass of colors and  vegetable freshnesses. A mountain of black-purple cauliflowers, like  niggers' heads, and a mountain of snow-white ones next to them. How the  dark, greasy, night-stricken street seems to beam with these vegetables,  all this fresh delicate flesh of luminous vegetables piled there in the  air, and in the recesses of the windowless little caverns of the shops,  and gleaming forth on the dark air, under the lamps. The q-b at once  wants to buy vegetables. \"Look! Look at the snow-white broccoli. Look at  the huge finocchi. Why don't we get them? I _must_ have some.

The hands of the government were on every branch of industry. Perverse  regulations, uncertain and ruinous taxes, monopolies, encouragements,  prohibitions, restrictions, cramped the national energy. Mistress of the  Indies, Spain swarmed with beggars. Yet, verging to decay, she had an  ominous and appalling strength. Her condition was that of an athletic  man penetrated with disease, which had not yet unstrung the thews and  sinews formed in his days of vigor. Philip the Second could command the  service of warriors and statesmen developed in the years that were past.  The gathered energies of ruined feudalism were wielded by a single hand.  The mysterious King, in his den in the Escorial, dreary and silent, and  bent like a scribe over his papers, was the type and the champion  of arbitrary power. More than the Pope himself, he was the head of  Catholicity. In doctrine and in deed, the inexorable bigotry of Madrid  was ever in advance of Rome.    Not so with France. She was full of life,--a discordant and struggling  vitality. Her monks and priests, unlike those of Spain, were rarely  either fanatics or bigots; yet not the less did they ply the rack and  the fagot, and howl for heretic blood. Their all was at stake: their  vast power, their bloated wealth, were wrapped up in the ancient faith.  Men were burned, and women buried alive. All was in vain. To the utmost  bounds of France, the leaven of the Reform was working. The Huguenots,  fugitives from torture and death, found an asylum at Geneva, their city  of refuge, gathering around Calvin, their great high-priest. Thence  intrepid colporteurs, their lives in their hands, bore the Bible and the  psalm-book to city, hamlet, and castle, to feed the rising flame. The  scattered churches, pressed by a common danger, began to organize. An  ecclesiastical republic spread its ramifications through France, and  grew underground to a vigorous life,--pacific at the outset, for the  great body of its members were the quiet bourgeoisie, by habit, as by  faith, averse to violence. Yet a potent fraction of the warlike noblesse  were also of the new faith; and above them all, preeminent in character  as in station, stood Gaspar de Coligny, Admiral of France.    The old palace of the Louvre, reared by the \"Roi Chevalier\" on the site  of those dreary feudal towers which of old had guarded the banks of the  Seine, held within its sculptured masonry the worthless brood of Valois.  Corruption and intrigue ran riot at the court. Factious nobles, bishops,  and cardinals, with no God but pleasure and ambition, contended around  the throne or the sick-bed of the futile King. Catherine de Medicis,  with her stately form, her mean spirit, her bad heart, and her  fathomless depths of duplicity, strove by every subtle art to hold the  balance of power among them. The bold, pitiless, insatiable Guise, and  his brother the Cardinal of Lorraine, the incarnation of falsehood,  rested their ambition on the Catholic party. Their army was a legion  of priests, and the black swarms of countless monasteries, who by the  distribution of alms held in pay the rabble of cities and starving  peasants on the lands of impoverished nobles. Montmorency, Conde, and  Navarre leaned towards the Reform,--doubtful and inconstant chiefs,  whose faith weighed light against their interests. Yet, amid  vacillation, selfishness, weakness, treachery, one great man was like a  tower of trust, and this was Gaspar de Coligny.    Firm in his convictions, steeled by perils and endurance, calm,  sagacious, resolute, grave even to severity, a valiant and redoubted  soldier, Coligny looked abroad on the gathering storm and read its  danger in advance. He saw a strange depravity of manners; bribery and  violence overriding justice; discontented nobles, and peasants ground  down with taxes. In the midst of this rottenness, the Calvinistic  churches, patient and stern, were fast gathering to themselves the  better life of the nation. Among and around them tossed the surges of  clerical hate. Luxurious priests and libertine monks saw their disorders  rebuked by the grave virtues of the Protestant zealots. Their broad  lands, their rich endowments, their vessels of silver and of gold, their  dominion over souls,--in itself a revenue,--were all imperiled by the  growing heresy. Nor was the Reform less exacting, less intolerant, or,  when its hour came, less aggressive than the ancient faith. The storm  was thickening, and it must burst soon.    When the Emperor Charles the Fifth beleaguered Algiers, his camps were  deluged by a blinding tempest, and at its height the infidels made a  furious sally. A hundred Knights of Malta, on foot, wearing over their  armor surcoats of crimson blazoned with the white cross, bore the  brunt of the assault. Conspicuous among them was Nicolas Durand de  Villegagnon. A Moorish cavalier, rushing upon him, pierced his arm with  a lance, and wheeled to repeat the blow; but the knight leaped on the  infidel, stabbed him with his dagger, flung him from his horse, and  mounted in his place. Again, a Moslem host landed in Malta and beset the  Cite Notable. The garrison was weak, disheartened, and without a leader.  Villegagnon with six followers, all friends of his own, passed under  cover of night through the infidel leaguer, climbed the walls by ropes  lowered from above, took command, repaired the shattered towers,  aiding with his own hands in the work, and animated the garrison to  a resistance so stubborn that the besiegers lost heart and betook  themselves to their galleys. No less was he an able and accomplished  mariner, prominent among that chivalry of the sea who held the perilous  verge of Christendom against the Mussuhuan. He claimed other  laurels than those of the sword. He was a scholar, a linguist, a  controversialist, potent with the tongue and with the pen, commanding  in presence, eloquent and persuasive in discourse. Yet this Crichton of  France had proved himself an associate nowise desirable. His sleepless  intellect was matched with a spirit as restless, vain, unstable, and  ambitious, as it was enterprising and bold. Addicted to dissent, and  enamoured of polemics, he entered those forbidden fields of inquiry and  controversy to which the Reform invited him. Undaunted by his monastic  vows, he battled for heresy with tongue and pen, and in the ear of  Protestants professed himself a Protestant. As a Commander of his Order,  he quarreled with the Grand Master, a domineering Spaniard; and, as  Vice-Admiral of Brittany, he was deep in a feud with the Governor of  Brest. Disgusted at home, his fancy crossed the seas. He aspired to  build for France and himself an empire amid the tropical splendors of  Brazil. Few could match him in the gift of persuasion; and the intrepid  seamen whose skill and valor had run the gantlet of the English fleet,  and borne Mary Stuart of Scotland in safety to her espousals with  the Dauphin, might well be intrusted with a charge of moment so far  inferior. Henry the Second was still on the throne. The lance of  Montgomery had not yet rid France of that infliction. To win a share  in the rich domain of the New World, of which Portuguese and Spanish  arrogance claimed the monopoly, was the end held by Villegagnon before  the eyes of the King. Of the Huguenots, he said not a word. For Coligny  he had another language. He spoke of an asylum for persecuted religion,  a Geneva in the wilderness, far from priests and monks and Francis of  Guise. The Admiral gave him a ready ear; if, indeed, he himself had  not first conceived the plan. Yet to the King, an active burner of  Huguenots, Coligny too urged it as an enterprise, not for the Faith, but  for France. In secret, Geneva was made privy to it, and Calvin himself  embraced it with zeal. The enterprise, in fact, had a double character,  political as well as religious. It was the reply of France, the most  emphatic she had yet made, to the Papal bull which gave all the western  hemisphere to Portugal and Spain; and, as if to point her answer,  she sent, not Frenchmen only, but Protestant Frenchmen, to plant the  fleur-de-lis on the shores of the New World.    Two vessels were made ready, in the name of the King. The body of the  emigration was Huguenot, mingled with young nobles, restless, idle, and  poor, with reckless artisans, and piratical sailors from the Norman  and Breton seaports. They put to sea from Havre on the twelfth of July,  1555, and early in November saw the shores of Brazil. Entering the  harbor of Rio Janeiro, then called Ganabara, Villegagnon landed men  and stores on an island, built huts, and threw up earthworks. In  anticipation of future triumphs, the whole continent, by a strange  perversion of language, was called Antarctic France, while the fort  received the name of Coligny.    Villegagnon signalized his new-born Protestantism by an intolerable  solicitude for the manners and morals of his followers. The whip and  the pillory requited the least offence. The wild and discordant crew,  starved and flogged for a season into submission, conspired at length  to rid themselves of him; but while they debated whether to poison him,  blow him up, or murder him and his officers in their sleep, three Scotch  soldiers, probably Calvinists, revealed the plot, and the vigorous hand  of the commandant crushed it in the bud.    But how was the colony to subsist? Their island was too small for  culture, while the mainland was infested with hostile tribes, and  threatened by the Portuguese, who regarded the French occupancy as a  violation of their domain.    Meanwhile, in France, Huguenot influence, aided by ardent letters sent  home by Villegagnon in the returning ships, was urging on the work. Nor  were the Catholic chiefs averse to an enterprise which, by colonizing  heresy, might tend to relieve France of its presence. Another  embarkation was"]]]
