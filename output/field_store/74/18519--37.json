The _hymenium_ consists of elongated cells or basidia  (singular, basidium) more or less club-shaped. Figure 2 will show how  these basidia appear on the hymenial layer when strongly magnified. It  will be seen that they are placed side by side and are perpendicular to  the surface of the gills. Upon each of these basidia are in some species  two, usually four, slender projections upon which the spores are  produced. In Figure 2 a number of sterile cells will be seen which  resemble the basidia except that the latter bear four sterigmata upon  which the spores rest. Among these basidia and sterile cells will  frequently be seen an overgrown bladder-like sterile basidium which  projects beyond the rest of the hymenium, and whose use is not as yet  fully known. They are called cystidia (singular, cystidium). They are  never numerous, but they are scattered over the entire surface, becoming  more numerous along the edge of the gills. When they are colored, they  change the appearance of the gills.    [Illustration: Figure 3.--Rootlike strands of mycelium of the  pear-shaped puff-ball growing in rotten wood. Young puff-balls in the  form of small white knots are forming on the strands. Natural  size.--_Longyear._]    The spores are the seeds of the mushroom. They are of various sizes and  shapes, with a variety of surface markings. They are very small, as fine  as dust, and invisible to the naked eye, except as they are seen in  masses on the grass, on the ground, or on logs, or in a spore print. It  is the object of every fungus to produce spores. Some fall on the parent  host or upon the ground. Others are wafted away by every rise of the  wind and carried for days and finally settle down, it may be, in other  states and continents from those in which they started. Millions perish  because of not finding a suitable resting place. Those spores that do  find a favorable resting-place, under right conditions, will begin to  germinate by sending out a slender thread-like filament, or hyphae, which  at once branches out in search of food material, and which always forms  a more or less felted mass, called mycelium. When first formed the hyphae  are continuous and ramify through the nourishing substratum from which  there arises afterward a spore-bearing growth known as the sporocarp or  young mushroom. This vegetative part of the fungus is usually hidden in  the soil, or in decayed wood, or vegetable matter. In Figure 3 is a  representation of the mycelium of the small pear-shaped puff-ball with a  number of small white knobs marking the beginning of the puff-ball. The  mycelium exposed here is very similar to the mycelium of all mushrooms.    In the pore-bearing genera the hymenium lines the vertical pores; in  teeth-bearing fungi it lines the surface of each tooth, or is spread out  over the smooth surface of the Stereum.    The development of the spores is quite interesting. The young basidia as  seen in Figure 2 are filled with a granular protoplasm. Soon small  projections, called sterigma (plural, sterigmata), make their appearance  on the ends of the basidia and the protoplasm passes into them. Each  projection or sterigma soon swells at its extremity into a bladder-like  body, the young spore, and, as they enlarge, the protoplasm of the  basidium is passed into them. When the four spores are full grown they  have consumed all the protoplasm in the basidium. The spores soon  separate by a transverse partition and fall off. All spores of the  Hymenomycetous fungi are arranged and produced in a similar manner, with  their spore-bearing surface exposed early in life by the rupture of the  universal veil.    In the puff-balls the spores are arranged in the same way, but the  hymenium is inclosed within an outer sack. When the spores are ripe the  case is ruptured and the spores escape into the air as a dusty powder.  The puff-balls, therefore, belong to the Gastromycetous fungi because  its spores are inclosed in a pouch until they are matured.    Another very large group of fungi is the Ascomycetes, or sac fungi. It  is very easily determined because all of its members develop their  spores inside of small membranous sacs or asci. These asci are generally  intermixed with slender, empty asci, or sterile cells, called  paraphyses. These asci are variously shaped bodies and are known in  different orders by different names, such as ascoma, apothecium,  perithecium, and receptacle. The Ascomycetes often include among their  numbers fungi ranging in size from microscopic one-celled plants to  quite large and very beautiful specimens. To this group belong the great  number of small fungi producing the various plant diseases.    In a work of this kind especial attention is naturally given to the  order of Discomycetes or cup fungi. This order is very large and is so  called because so many of the plants are cup shaped. These cups vary  greatly in size and form; some are so small that it requires a lens to  examine them; some are saucer-shaped; some are like goblets, and some  resemble beakers of various shapes. The saddle fungi and morels belong  to this order. Here the sac surface is often convoluted, lobed, and  ridged, in order to afford a greater sac-bearing surface.    [Illustration: Figure 4.--Small portion of a section through the  spore-bearing part of a morel in which the spores are produced in little  sacs or asci. (a) An ascus, (b) an ascus discharging its spores, (c) the  spores, (d) sterile cells. Highly magnified.--_Longyear._]    In the mushrooms, puff-balls, etc., we find the spores were borne on the  ends of basidia, usually four spores on each. In this group the spores  are formed in minute club-shaped sacs, known as asci (singular, ascus).  These asci are long, cylindrical sacs, standing side by side,  perpendicular to the fruiting surface. Figure 4 will illustrate their  position together with the sterile cells on the fruiting surface of one  of the morels. They usually have eight spores in each sac or ascus.    The stem of the mushroom is usually in the center of the cap, yet it may  be eccentric or lateral; when it is wanting, the pileus is said to be  sessile. The stem is solid when it is fleshy throughout, or hollow when  it has a central cavity, or stuffed when the interior is filled with  pithy substance. The stems are either fleshy or cartilaginous. When the  former, it is of the same consistency as the pileus. If the latter, its  consistency is always different from the pileus, resembling cartilage.  The stem of the Tricholoma affords a good example of the fleshy stemmed  mushroom, and that of the Marasmius illustrates the cartilaginous.    [Illustration: Figure 5.--Small portion of a stem of a morel showing  cell filaments. Highly magnified.--_Longyear._]    If the cap or stem of a mushroom is examined with a microscope of high  magnifying power it will be found to be made up of a continuation of the  mycelial filaments, interlaced and interwoven, branching, and the  tubular filaments often delicately divided, giving the appearance of  cells. Figure 5 represents a small portion of a Morel stem highly  magnified showing the cell filaments. In soft fungi the mycelial threads  are more loosely woven and have thin walls with fewer partitions.    The _veil_ is a thin sheet of mycelial threads covering the gills,  sometimes remaining on the stem, forming a _ring_ or _annulus_. This  sometimes remains for a time on the margin of the cap when it is said to  be _appendiculate_. Sometimes it resembles a spider's web when it is  called _arachnoid_.    The _volva_ is a universal wrapper, surrounding the entire plant when  young, but which is soon ruptured, leaving a trace in the form of scales  on the cap and a sheath around the base of the stem, or breaking up into  scales or a scaly ring at the base of the stem. All plants having this  universal volva should be avoided, further than for the purpose of  study. Care should be taken that, in their young state, they are not  mistaken for puff-balls. Frequently when found in the egg state they  resemble a small puff-ball. Figure 6 represents a section of an Amanita  in the egg-state and also the Gemmed puff-ball. As soon as a section is  made and carefully examined the structure of the inside will reveal the  plant at once. There is but little danger of confusing the egg stage of  an Amanita with the puff-ball, for they resemble each other only in  their oval shape, and not in the least in their marking on the surface.    [Illustration: Figure 6.--The lefthand figure represents a vertical  section through a young plant of the gemmed puff-ball showing the  cellular structure of the stem-like lower half, called the subgleba. The  righthand figure shows a vertical section of the egg stage of an  Amanita, a very poisonous fungus which grows in woods and which might be  mistaken for a young puff-ball if not cut open. The fungus forms just  below the surface of the soil, finally bursting the volva, sending up a  parasol mushroom. Natural size.--_Longyear._]      =WHAT IS A FUNGUS OR A MUSHROOM?= It is a cellular, flowerless plant,  nourished by the mycelium which permeates the soil or other substances  on which the fungus or mushroom grows. All fungi are either parasites or  saprophytes which have lost their chlorophyll, and are incapable of  supporting an independent existence.    There is a vast number of genera and species, and many have the  parasitic habit which causes them to enter the bodies of other plants  and of animals. For this reason all fungi are of economic importance,  especially the microscopic forms classed under the head of Bacteria.  Some recent writers are inclined to separate the Bacteria and  slime-molds from the fungus group, and call them fungus animals.

In each specimen of _L. c. curti_ the length of the ear measured       from the notch when the animal was in the flesh was eight       millimeters more than in the dried skin.    The cranial measurements given above are taken, in so far as possible,  in the same way that the measurements recorded by Nelson in his North  American Fauna (No. 29, 1909) were taken. In that publication he records  mostly average measurements but he records also some measurements of  individual specimens. Two of these specimens are the holotypes of  _Sylvilagus mansuetus_ Nelson and Romerolagus nelsoni Merriam. By  attempting to duplicate Nelson's measurements on these specimens, the  following opinions were formed.         \"Basilar length\" is basilar length of Hensel and the anterior       point probably was the posterior border of the alveolus of incisor       two. There is some evidence of lack of consistency with respect to       the anterior control point.         \"Length of nasals\" is the overall length, of the two nasal bones,       but in _Romerolagus_ the shorter (right) nasal alone seems to have       been measured.         \"Breadth of rostrum above premolars\" is easily duplicated in       _Lepus_ but in _Sylvilagus_ the control points are difficult to       find. Two other persons and I obtained three different       measurements, all different from Nelson's measurements, and we       thought that Nelson would have obtained different measurements by       measuring the same specimen of _Sylvilagus_ at different times.         \"Depth of rostrum in front of premolars\" seems to have been taken       perpendicular to the inferior longitudinal line of the rostrum,       approximately one-half millimeter anterior to the alveolus of the       anteriormost cheek tooth.         \"Interorbital breadth\" was taken across the supraorbital processes,       at the narrowest place, but _not_ from the notches medial to the       antorbital projections of the supraorbital processes.         \"Parietal breadth\" is the breadth, across the braincase, taken       approximately half way between the squamosal root of the zygoma and       the external auditory meatus, where there is a lateral bulge in the       squamosal bone. On each side of the skull, the calipers rest on the       squamosal bone, not on the parietal bone.         \"Diameter of bullae\" excludes the paroccipital process and was       taken from the anteriormost part of a tympanic bulla,       posterolaterally to the part of that same bulla, that is exposed at       the lateral side of the base of the paroccipital process.    _Specimens examined._--Total, four, all from Tamaulipas, Mexico, as  follows: 88 mi.
