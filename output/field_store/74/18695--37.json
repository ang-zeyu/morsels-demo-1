CHAPTER III    THE ANGLER AND THE FISHERMAN      One profound proof of the soundness in the philosophy that teaches  against wantonly wasteful slaughter in the chase is the disinclination  on the part of certain so-called sportsmen--a vulgar gentry that  resort to the woods and waters solely because it is fashionable to do  so--and their guides to honorably dispose of their game after the  killing. These greedy snobs are viciously adverse to losing a single  bird or fish in the pursuit, but they think little of letting the game  rot in the sun after the play. With this fact easily provable any day  in the year, it may be said that outside of market fishing and camp  fishing for the pot the one real object in fishing and angling is the  pursuit itself and not the quarry.    In baseball, it's the game, not the bases; in archery, it's the  straightest shooting, not the target. True, we play cards for prizes,  but surely as much for the game itself, not altogether for the prizes,  because it is possible to buy the prizes or their equivalent outright  or take the prizes by force.    My bayman develops fits bordering closely upon incurable hysteria if I  lose a single bluefish in the play, but he worries not when he goes  ashore with a sloopful of hand-liners and half a hundred fish he  cannot make good use of.    \"Pull it in! you'll lose it!\" \"We could catch a hundred if you  wouldn't fool!\" \"The other boats'll beat us badly!\" \"There's a million  right 'round the boat!\"    These are a few of his excitable expressions. But, when I say to him,  \"What's the difference, Captain, in losing one or two fish here and  wasting half a hundred on shore?\" he calms down for a minute or two.  Only for a minute or two, however, for he's in the game solely for  fish, not the fishing. It's all numbers and size with him, and he's  encouraged in this greed by nine out of every ten men he takes aboard  his boat.    \"We caught fifty,\" says Tom.    \"We caught a hundred and ten,\" says Dick.    \"We caught two hundred and sixty,\" says Harry.    And so the bayman brags, too, because it's purely business with him.    I have always found the greatest pleasure in fishing is the fishing  and not the blood and bones associated with the pursuit. I would  rather take five fair fish on fine tackle correctly manipulated than  fill the hold with a hundred horrid monsters mastered by mere  strength, as in hand-line trolling for bluefish in the ocean and for  muskellonge, etc., in fresh water.    \"But,\" says Captain Getemanyway, \"I can catch more fish with a  hand-line than you can with your fine rod and reel.\"    \"Of course you can,\" I reply, \"and you could catch more if you used a  net, a stick of dynamite, or a shotgun.\"    If it's the fish alone that is the object of the Angler's eye, why  resort to any sort of tackle when there's a fish stall in every  bailiwick?    There is great need of enlightenment in the common ethics of angling.  Many persons are under the impression that quantity rather than  quality makes the Angler's day.    According to their view of the pursuit, fishing is judged by figures,  as in finance--glory to the man with the biggest balance. This is not  so, because with this view accepted, Rockefeller would shine above  Christ, Shakespeare, and Lincoln.    The mere catch--the number of fish taken--is only one little detail;  it is not all of angling. If it were, the superior fisherman would be  the man who got his fish in any manner.    Some of our greatest Anglers purposely never excel in the matter of  numbers. The Angler's true qualities are based on the application of  correct tackle, correct methods in fishing, and a correct appreciation  of the pursuit, the game, the day, and the craft.    'Tis the day and the play, not the heads and hides that count.    An ancient writer says of the royal hounds: \"The hunter loves to see  the hounds pursue the hare, and he is glad if the hare escapes.\" So it  is in angling; we do not wish to catch all the fish we can take in any  fashion. We want to take some of them in a proper manner with  appropriate implements.    \"I can catch more trout with the angleworm and more bass with the  trolling spoon than you can with the artificial fly,\" says Robert.    \"Of course you can, Robert,\" say I, \"and you could catch still more if  you spread a screen across the tiny stream or set a trap, or if you  used a set line with a hundred hooks, just as the target shooter might  more readily puncture the circle with a charge of shot than with the  single bullet, or just as the greedyman with a blunderbuss might excel  in number the wing shot by potting quail bunched on the ground instead  of chivalrously bagging single birds on the wing with a pertinent arm.\"    The neophyte always confounds the angler with the indiscriminate  fisherman and so implicates the angler in the cruelty and wastefulness  associated with mere chance fishing, when in fact the Angler is the  real propagator and protector of the fishes, and is in no sense cruel  or wasteful.    The laws that prohibit greedy catches, and protect the mother fish in  breeding time, are made by, enforced by, and supported financially by  the Angler.    The rearing of the fishes that are placed in depleted waters was  originated by, is conducted by, and is paid for by the Angler.    No other class has earnestly bothered its head, honestly lifted its  hands, or liberally opened its purse in these matters, and the nearest  association man in general has with the preservation of both wild fish  and fowl is in uttering a cowardly, false accusation against the one  who really deserves sole credit for the work, the sportsman, the  genuine field sportsman, not the vicious sporting man of the race  track, cockpit, and gambling den--two distinct species of animal, as  vastly separated in character as the deerhound and the dragon.    And why this charge against the innocent? Simply because the guilty  wish to shield and profit themselves, as the thief cries fire that he  may pick your pocket in the panic that ensues.    But then there is a well meaning but wholly unenlightened element,  that, influenced by the cry of the methodical spoiler, ignorantly  condemns the honest man--the really humane men and women who are  sincere in their condemnation but totally ignorant of their subject.    One of this sort, an estimable woman in public life, loudly preaches  against the chase and is all the time drawing dividends that provide  her with the means to indulge in the vulgarest and cruelest of  fashionable extravagances--among them the wool of the unborn lamb,  furs from the backs of fast-disappearing quadrupeds, and feathers of  the farmers' most valuable insect-destroying song birds--and these  wicked dividends derived from several acid factories, a gas house, a  power plant, and a dye works that have not only killed off the  trillions of fishes in several rivers but destroyed forever the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37872"],[0,"The International Monthly, Volume 2, No. 1, December, 1850 (#4)"],[1,"the profession of the law, married a  daughter of Mills Olcott, of Hanover, and after a few years, rich in  promise of professional eminence, died of consumption at Hanover, in  1835.    The elder, Charles B. Haddock, was born in the house in which his  grandfather first lived, after he removed to the river, in Franklin;  though his childhood was chiefly spent at Elms Farms, in the mansion  built by his father, and now the favorite residence of his uncle, Daniel  Webster,--a spot hardly equaled for picturesque and tranquil beauty in  that part of New England. How much of his rural tastes and gentle  feelings the professor owes to the place of his nativity it is not for  us to determine. It is certain that a fitter scene to inspire the  sentiments for which he is distinguished, and which he delights to  refresh by frequent visits to these scenes, could not well be imagined.  Every hill and valley, every rock and eddy, seem to be familiar to him,  and to have a legend for his heart. His earliest distinct recollections,  he has often been heard to say, are the burial of a sister younger than  himself, his own baptism at the bedside of his dying mother, and the  death of his grandfather; and the first things that awakened a romantic  emotion were the flight of the night-hawk and the note of the  whippoorwill, both uncommonly numerous and noticeable there in summer  evenings.    From 1807 he was in the academy during the summer months, and attended  the common school in winter, until 1811, when, in his sixteenth year, he  taught his own first winter school. It had been his fortune to have as  instructors persons destined to unusual eminence: Mr. Richard Fletcher,  now one of the justices of the Superior Court of Massachusetts; Justice  Willard, of Springfield; the Rev. Edward L. Parker, of Londonderry; and  Nathaniel H. Carter, the well-known poet and general writer. It was  under Mr. Carter that he first felt a genuine love of learning; and he  has always ascribed more of his literary tastes, to his insensible  influence, as he read to him Virgil and Cicero, than to any other living  teacher. His earliest Latin book was the AEneid, over the first half of  which he had, summer after summer, fatigued and vexed himself, before  the idea occurred to him that it was an epic poem; and that idea came to  him at length not from his teachers, but from a question of his uncle,  Daniel Webster, about the descent of the hero into the infernal regions.  When a proper impression of its design was once formed, and some  familiarity with the language was acquired, Virgil was run through with  great rapidity: half a book in a day. So also with Cicero: an oration at  a lesson. There was no verbal accuracy acquired or attempted; but a  ready mastery of the current of discourse--a familiarity with the point  and spirit of the work. In August, 1812, he was admitted a freshman in  Dartmouth College. It was a small class, but remarkable from having  produced a large number of eminent men, among whom we may mention George  A. Simmons, a distinguished lawyer in northern New York, and one of the  profoundest philosophers in this country; Dr. Absalom Peters; President  Wheeler, of the University of Vermont; Governor Hubbard, of Maine; and  Professor Joseph Torrey, of the University of Vermont, since so  honorably known as the learned translator of Neander, and as being  without a superior among American scholars in a knowledge of the  profounder German literature. The late illustrious and venerated Dr.  James Marsh, the editor of Coleridge, and the only pupil of that great  metaphysician who was the peer of his master, was of the class below  his, and was an intimate companion in study.    From the beginning of his college life it was his ambition to  distinguish himself. By the general consent of his classmates, and by  the appointment of the faculty, he held the first place at each public  exhibition through the four years in which he was a student, and at the  last commencement was complimented with having the order of the parts,  according to which the Latin salutatory had hitherto been first, so  changed that he might still have precedence and yet have the English  valedictory. During his junior year, his mind was first decidedly turned  toward religion, and with Wheeler, Torrey, Marsh, and some forty others,  he made a public profession. The two years after he left college were  spent at Andover, in the study of divinity. While here, with Torrey,  Wheeler, Marsh, and one or two more, he joined in a critical reading of  Virgil--an exercise of great value in enlarging a command of his own  language, as well as his knowledge of Latin. At the close of the second  year he was attacked with hemorrhage of the lungs, and advised to try a  southern climate for the winter. He sailed in October, 1818, for  Charleston, and spent the winter in that city and in Savannah, with  occasional visits into the surrounding country. The following summer he  traveled, chiefly on horseback, and in company with the Rev. Pliny Fisk,  from Charleston home. To this tour he ascribes his recovery. He soon  after took his master's degree, and was appointed the first Professor of  Rhetoric and Belles-Lettres in Dartmouth College. From that time a  change was obvious in the literary spirit of the instruction given at  the institution. The department to which he was called became very soon  the most attractive in the college, and some of the most distinguished  orators of our country are pleased to admit that they obtained their  first impressions of true eloquence and a correct style from the  youthful professor. He introduced readings in the Scriptures, and in  Shakspeare, Milton, and Young, with original criticisms by his pupils on  particular features of the principal works of genius, as the hell of  Virgil, Dante, and Milton; and the prominent characters of the best  tragedies, as the Jew of Cumberland and of Shakspeare; and  extemporaneous discussions of aesthetical and political questions, as  upon the authenticity of Ossian, the authorship of Homer, the sincerity  of Cromwell, or the expediency of the execution of Charles. He also  exerted his influence in founding an association for familiar written  and oral discussions in literature, in which Dr. Edward Oliver, Dr.  James Marsh, Professor Fiske, Mr. Rufus Choate, Professor Chamberlain,  and others, acted a prominent part.    He retained this chair until August, 1838, when he was appointed to that  of Intellectual Philosophy and Political Economy, which he now holds,  but, which, of course, will be occupied by another during his absence in  the public service--the faculty having declined on any account to accept  his resignation or to appoint a successor.    Dr. Haddock has been invited to the professorship of rhetoric in  Hamilton College, and to the presidency of that institution, the  presidency and a professorship in the Auburn Theological Seminary, the  presidency of Bowdoin College, and, less formally, to that of several  other colleges in New England.    In public affairs, he has for four successive years been a  representative in the New Hampshire Legislature, and in this period was  active in introducing the present common school system of the State, and  was the first commissioner of common schools, originating the course of  action in that important office which has since been pursued. He was one  of the fathers of the railroad system in New Hampshire, and his various  speeches had the effect to change the policy of the State on this  subject. He addressed the first convention called at Lebanon to consider  the practicability of a road across the State, and afterward a similar  convention at Montpelier. For two years he lectured every Sabbath  evening to the students and to the people of the village, on the  historical portions of the New Testament. For several years he held  weekly meetings for the interpretation of Scripture, in which the ladies  of the village met at his house. And for twenty years he has constantly  preached to vacant parishes in the vicinity. He has delivered  anniversary orations before the Phi Beta Kappa Societies of Dartmouth  and Yale, the Rhetorical Societies of Andover and Bangor, the Religious  Society of the University of Vermont, the New Hampshire Historical  Society, and the New England Society of New York; numerous lyceum  lectures, in Boston, Lowell, Salem, Portsmouth, Manchester, New Bedford,  and other places; and of the New Hampshire Education Society he was  twelve or fifteen years secretary, publishing annual reports. The  principal periodicals to which he has contributed are the _Biblical  Repository_ and the _Bibliotheca Sacra_. A volume of his _Addresses and  Miscellaneous Writings_ was published in 1846, and he has now a work on  rhetoric in preparation.    He has been twice married--the last time to a sister of Mr. Kimball, the  author of \"St. Leger,\" &c. He has three children living, and has buried  seven.    In agriculture, gardening, and public improvements of all kinds, he has  taken a lively interest. The rural ornaments of the town in which he  lives owe much to him. He may be said to have introduced the fruit and  horticulture which are now becoming so abundant as luxuries, and so  remarkable as ornaments of the village.    In 1843 he received the degree of D.D. from Bowdoin College. Of  Dartmouth College nearly half the graduates are his pupils. While  commissioner of common schools, he published a series of letters to  teachers and students which were more generally republished in the  various papers of the country than anything else of the kind ever before  written. Perhaps no one in this country has discussed so great a variety  of subjects. His essays upon the proper standard of education for the  pulpit, addresses on the utility of certain proposed lines of railway,  orations on the duties of the citizen to the state, lectures before  "]]]
