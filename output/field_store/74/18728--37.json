It is not to last  forever; but is only of twelve hours; when it is over, daylight will  return.    11 Sigh not, therefore, neither be moved; and say not in your heart  that this darkness is long and drags on wearily; and say not in your  heart that I plague you with it.    12 Strengthen your heart, and be not afraid.  This darkness is not a  punishment.  But, O Adam, I have made the day, and have placed the sun  in it to give light; in order that you and your children should do your  work.    13 For I knew you would sin and transgress, and come out into this  land.  Yet I wouldn't force you, nor be heard over you, nor shut up;  nor doom you through your fall; nor through your coming out from light  into darkness; nor yet through your coming from the garden into this  land.    14 For I made you of the light; and I willed to bring out children of  light from you and like to you.    15 But you did not keep My commandment one day; until I had finished  the creation and blessed everything in it.    16 Then, concerning the tree, I commanded you not to eat of it.  Yet I  knew that Satan, who deceived himself, would also deceive you.    17 So I made known to you by means of the tree, not to come near him.  And I told you not to eat of the fruit thereof, nor to taste of it, nor  yet to sit under it, nor to yield to it.    18 Had I not been and spoken to you, O Adam, concerning the tree, and  had I left you without a commandment, and you had sinned--it would have  been an offence on My part, for not having given you any order; you  would turn around and blame Me for it.    19 But I commanded you, and warned you, and you fell.  So that My  creatures cannot blame Me; but the blame rests on them alone.    20 And, O Adam, I have made the day so that you and your descendants  can work and toil in it.  And I have made the night for them to rest in  it from their work; and for the beasts of the field to go forth by  night and look for their food.    21 But little of darkness now remains, O Adam, and daylight will soon  appear.\"          Chapter XIV - The earliest prophesy of the coming of Christ.    1 Then Adam said to God: \"O Lord, take You my soul, and let me not see  this gloom any more; or remove me to some place where there is no  darkness.\"    2 But God the Lord said to Adam, \"Indeed I say to you, this darkness  will pass from you, every day I have determined for you, until the  fulfillment of My covenant; when I will save you and bring you back  again into the garden, into the house of light you long for, in which  there is no darkness*.  I will bring you to it--in the kingdom of  heaven.\"    3 Again said God to Adam, \"All this misery that you have been made to  take on yourself because of your transgression, will not free you from  the hand of Satan, and will not save you.    4 But I will.  When I shall come down from heaven, and shall become  flesh of your descendants, and take on Myself the infirmity from which  you suffer, then the darkness that covered you in this cave shall cover  Me in the grave, when I am in the flesh of your descendants.    5 And I, who am without years, shall be subject to the reckoning of  years, of times, of months, and of days, and I shall be reckoned as one  of the sons of men, in order to save you.\"    6 And God ceased to commune with Adam.      * Reference: John 12:46          Chapter XV - Adam and Eve grieve over the suffering of God to save them  from their sins.    1 Then Adam and Eve cried and sorrowed by reason of God's word to them,  that they should not return to the garden until the fulfillment of the  days decreed on them; but mostly because God had told them that He  should suffer for their salvation.          Chapter XVI - The first sunrise.  Adam and Eve think it is a fire  coming to burn them.    1 After this, Adam and Eve continued to stand in the cave, praying and  crying, until the morning dawned on them.    2 And when they saw the light returned to them, they retrained from  fear, and strengthened their hearts.    3 Then Adam began to come out of the cave.  And when he came to the  mouth of it, and stood and turned his face towards the east, and saw  the sunrise in glowing rays, and felt the heat thereof on his body, he  was afraid of it, and thought in his heart that this flame came forth  to plague him.    4 He then cried and beat his chest, then he fell on the ground on his  face and made his request, saying:--    5 \"O Lord, plague me not, neither consume me, nor yet take away my life  from the earth.\"    6 For he thought the sun was God.    7 Because while he was in the garden and heard the voice of God and the  sound He made in the garden, and feared Him, Adam never saw the  brilliant light of the sun, neither did its flaming heat touch his body.    8 Therefore he was afraid of the sun when flaming rays of it reached  him.  He thought God meant to plague him therewith all the days He had  decreed for him.    9 For Adam also said in his thoughts, as God did not plague us with  darkness, behold, He has caused this sun to rise and to plague us with  burning heat.    10 But while he was thinking like this in his heart, the Word of God  came to him and said:--    11 \"O Adam, get up on your feet.  This sun is not God; but it has been  created to give light by day, of which I spoke to you in the cave  saying, 'that the dawn would come, and there would be light by day.'    12 But I am God who comforted you in the night.\"    13 And God ceased to commune with Adam.          Chapter XVII - The Chapter of the Serpent.    1 The Adam and Eve came out at the mouth of the cave, and went towards  the garden.    2 But as they went near it, before the western gate, from which Satan  came when he deceived Adam and Eve, they found the serpent that became  Satan coming at the gate, and sorrowfully licking the dust, and  wiggling on its breast on the ground, by reason of the curse that fell  on it from God.    3 And whereas before the serpent was the most exalted of all beasts,  now it was changed and become slippery, and the meanest of them all,  and it crept on its breast and went on its belly.    4 And whereas it was the fairest of all beasts, it had been changed,  and was become the ugliest of them all.  Instead of feeding on the best  food, now it turned to eat the dust.  Instead of living, as before, in  the best places, now it lived in the dust.    5 And, whereas it had been the most beautiful of all beasts, all of  which stood dumb at its beauty, it was now abhorred of them.    6 And, again, whereas it lived in one beautiful home, to which all  other animals came from elsewhere; and where it drank, they drank also  of the same; now, after it had become venomous, by reason of God's  curse, all beasts fled from its home, and would not drink of the water  it drank; but fled from it.          Chapter XVIII - The mortal combat with the serpent.    1 When the accursed serpent saw Adam and Eve, it swelled its head,  stood on its tail, and with eyes blood-red, acted like it would kill  them.    2 It made straight for Eve, and ran after her; while Adam standing by,  cried because he had no stick in his hand with which to hit the  serpent, and did not know how to put it to death.    3 But with a heart burning for Eve, Adam approached the serpent, and  held it by the tail; when it turned towards him and said to him:--    4 \"O Adam, because of you and of Eve, I am slippery, and go on my  belly.\"  Then with its great strength, it threw down Adam and Eve and  squeezed them, and tried to kill them.    5 But God sent an angel who threw the serpent away from them, and  raised them up.    6 Then the Word of God came to the serpent, and said to it, \"The first  time I made you slick, and made you to go on your belly; but I did not  deprive you of speech.    7 This time, however, you will be mute, and you and your race will  speak no more; because, the first time My creatures were ruined because  of  you, and this time you tried to kill them.\"    8 Then the serpent was struck mute, and was no longer able to speak.    9 And a wind blew down from heaven by the command of God and carried  away the serpent from Adam and Eve, and threw it on the seashore where  it landed in India.          Chapter XIX - Beasts made subject to Adam.    1 But Adam and Eve cried before God.  And Adam said to Him:--    2 \"O Lord, when I was in the cave, I said this to you, my Lord, the  beasts of the field would rise and devour me, and cut off my life from  the earth.\"    3 Then Adam, because of what had happened to him, beat his chest and  fell on the ground like a corpse.  Then the Word of God came to him,  who raised him, and said to him,    4 \"O Adam, not one of these beasts will be able to hurt you; because I  have made the beasts and other moving things come to you in the cave.  I did not let the serpent come with them because it might have risen  against you and made you tremble; and the fear of it should fall into  your hearts.    5 For I knew that the accursed one is wicked; therefore I would not let  it come near you with the other beasts.    6 But now strengthen your heart and fear not.  I am with you to the end  of the days I have determined on you.\"          Chapter XX - Adam wishes to protect Eve.    1 Then Adam cried and said, \"O God, take us away to some other place,  where the serpent can not come near us again, and rise against us.  For  fear that it might find Your handmaid Eve alone and kill her; for its  eyes are hideous and evil.\"    2 But God said to Adam and Eve, \"From now on, don't be afraid, I will  not let it come near you; I have driven it away from you, from this  mountain; neither will I leave in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/39996"],[0,"The History of Painting in Italy, Vol. 5 (of 6) (#4)"],[1,"at S. Marco and at the Mezzaratta,  farther confirms it; nor can I easily persuade myself that Avanzi would  have entitled himself _Jacobus Pauli_, had there flourished another artist  at the same period, likely, from similarity of signatures, to create a  mistake. In the _Notizia_ of _Morelli_, p. 5, he is called _Jacomo Davanzo,  a Paduan, or Veronese, or as some maintain a Bolognese_, words which may  create a doubt of the real place of his birth. Without entering on such a  question, I shall only observe, that I incline to believe that his most  fixed domicile, at least towards the close of his days, was at Bologna; and  it has already been remarked, that some artists were accustomed to assume  their place of residence for a surname. It would seem that two painters of  this age derive their parentage from him: one who on an altar-piece at S.  Michele in Bosco signs himself _Petrus Jacobi_, and the same Orazio di  Jacopo mentioned by Malvasia. At all events it is observable in each  school, that, where an artist was the son of a painter, he gladly adopted  his father's name as a sort of support and recommendation of his own. One  Giovanni of Bologna, unknown in his own country, has left at Venice a  painting of S. Cristoforo, in the school of the Merchants at S. Maria  dell'Orto, to which he adds his name, though without date; and, from his  ancient manner, we are authorized to believe that he really belongs to the  place which is here assigned him.    Lippo di Dalmasio, formerly believed to be a Carmelite friar, until the  Turin edition of Baldinucci proved that he had died married, sprung from  the school of Vitale, and was named Lippo dalle Madonne. It is not true, as  reported, that he instructed the Beata Caterina Vigri in the art, by whom  there remain some miniatures, and an infant Christ painted on panel.  Lippo's manner scarcely varies from the ancient, except perhaps in better  harmony of tints and flow of drapery; to which last, however, he adds  fringes of gold lace tolerably wide, a practice very generally prevalent in  the early part of the fifteenth century. His heads are beautiful and novel,  more particularly in several Madonnas, which Guido Reni never ceased to  admire, being in the habit of declaring that Lippo must have been indebted  to some supernatural power for his exhibition in one countenance of all the  majesty, the sanctity, and the sweetness of the holy mother, and that in  this view he had not been equalled by any modern. Such is the account given  by Malvasia, who relates it, he adds, as he heard it. He moreover assures  us, on the authority of Guido, that Lippo painted several histories of  Elias in fresco, with great spirit; while, on the experience of Tiarini, he  would persuade us that he painted in oil at S. Procolo in via S. Stefano,  and in private houses; on which point he impugns the commonly received  opinion respecting Antonello, examined by us more than once. Contemporary  with Lippo must have flourished Maso da Bologna, painter of the ancient  cupola of the cathedral.    Subsequent to 1409, the latest epoch of the paintings of Lippo, the  Bolognese School began to decline; nor could it well be otherwise.  Dalmatio, an instructor of youth, was not by profession a painter of  history; and, as portrait painters never particularly promoted the progress  of any school, so on his part he conferred little benefit on his own. This  decline has been attributed to some specimens of art brought from  Constantinople, overcharged with dark lines in the contours and folds, and  in the remaining parts resembling rather the dryness and inelegance of the  Greek mosaic-workers, than the softness and grace then sought to be  introduced by the most eminent Italians in the art. Copies of these were  eagerly inquired for in Bologna, and in all adjacent cities, which produced  that abundance of them, still to be seen in the sale shops and private  houses throughout those districts, besides several in the city and state of  Venice.[5] But, in these instances, they were only copied; in Bologna they  were imitated likewise by several pupils of Lippo, who, either in part or  altogether, adopted that style in their own compositions. One Lianori,  usually inscribing his name _Petrus Joannis_, and known by some works  interspersed in different churches and collections, is most accused of this  extravagance; an Orazio di Jacopo, (perhaps dell'Avanzi) of whom there  remains a portrait of S. Bernardino, at the church of the Osservanza; a  Severo da Bologna, to whom is ascribed a rude altar-piece, in the Malvezzi  Museum; with several others, either little known or unmentioned, whose  names I am not surprised should be omitted by Vasari, who, in the same way,  passes over the least distinguished of his own country. It is true, he  makes mention of one Galante da Bologna, who, he avers, designed better  than Lippo, his master; but in this he is still taken to task by Malvasia,  who includes Galante among the inferior pupils of Dalmasio.         Footnote 5: The Greeks, during the earliest periods, having       uniformly represented the Virgin in so rude a style, were       always pleased with similar paintings. I state this to       remove a very prevalent error, that every Madonna of Greek       style, with distended eyes, long fingers, and dark       complexion, in the style of that of Pisa, called _Degli       Organi_, or those of Cimabue, is to be referred to the       remotest dates. Indeed I have seen specimens of the       sixteenth, seventeenth, and even eighteenth centuries,       particularly in the Classe Museum, in that of Cattaio, and       in the palaces of Venetian nobles. One in the possession of       the E. E. Signori Giustiniani Recanati, has, notwithstanding       its very antique air, red letters inscribed on a gold       ground, expressing, CHEIR EMMANOUEL IEREOS ..... a ... lx,       _Manus Emanuelis Sacerdotis_. an. 1660. From the hand of the       same Greek priest, well known to Venetian artists, there are       other altar-pieces with a similar inscription; and it is       still customary in that city to reproduce specimens of a       similar kind, to satisfy the continual inquiries of the       Greek merchants. To judge correctly, then, of the age of       such images, we must look for other indications besides       their design, such as the _letters_, (see vol. i. p. 49),       the fashion of the cornice, the method of colouring, or       those cherubs, holding a gold crown over the head of the       Virgin, in the edges and the folds of whose drapery are       imprinted marks of ages nearer to our own.    Nevertheless, the germ of good painting was not wanting, as far as the  times permitted it to exist, both in Bologna and throughout Romagna.  Malvasia commends one Jacopo Ripanda, who long flourished at Rome, where,  as is commemorated by Volterrano, he began to design the bassi-relievi of  the Trajan Column; one Ercole, a Bolognese, who somewhat improved the  symmetry of the human figure; one Bombologno, a carver of crucifixes, like  Simone, but of more refined composition. He more particularly celebrates a  Michel di Matteo, or Michel Lambertini; in whose commendation it may be  enough to state, that Albano praised one of his pictures, supposed to be in  oil, completed in 1443, for the fish-market, and even preferred it for its  softness to those of Francia. The few which we still possess in our own  times, both at the churches of S. Pietro and S. Jacopo, might be put in  competition with the contemporary works of almost any master.    But the artist who produced an epoch in his school is Marco Zoppo, who  having transferred his education under Lippo to the studio of Squarcione,  rose to equal eminence with Pizzolo and Dario da Trevigi; and, like them,  vied with the genius of Mantegna, and gave a farther spur to his exertions.  He also studied some time in the Venetian School, where he painted for the  Osservanti, at Pesaro, a picture of the Virgin on a Throne, crowned, with  S. Giovanni the Baptist, San Francesco, and other saints, and signed it  _Marco Zoppo da Bologna Dip. in Vinexia_, 1471. This is the most celebrated  production which he left behind him; from which, and a few other pieces in  the same church, and at Bologna, we may gather some idea of his style. The  composition is that common to the quattrocentisti, particularly the  Venetians, and which he probably introduced into Bologna, a style which  continued to the time of Francia and his school, for the most part  unvaried, except in the addition of some cherub to the steps of the throne,  sometimes with a harp, and sometimes without. It is not a free and graceful  style, like that of Mantegna, but rather coarse, particularly in the  drawing of the feet; yet less rectilinear in the folds, and bolder, and  more harmonious, perhaps, in the selection of the colours. The fleshes are  as much studied as in Signorelli, and in others of the same age; while the  figures and the accessories are conducted with the most finished care.  Marco was, likewise, a fine decorator of facades, in which kind of painting  he was assisted by his companion and imitator, Jacopo Forti, to whose hand  is ascribed a Madonna, painted on the wall, at the church of S. Tommaso, in  Mercato. In the Malvezzi collection there is also attributed to Jacopo a  Deposition of the Saviour from the Cross; a work which does not keep pace  with the progressive improvements of that age. The same remark will apply  to a great number of others, produced about the same period, in the same  city, which, towards the close of the century, displayed a striking  deficiency in good artists. It was owing to this circumstance that Gio.  Bentivoglio, then master of Bologna, wishing to ornament his palace, which,  had fortune favoured him, would one day have become that of all Romagna,  invited a number of artists from Ferrara and Modena, who"]]]
