An abbreviated synonymy, in which  are listed all combinations and emendations of names and significant  contributions to our knowledge of the taxon, is given for each. For each  species and subspecies the following are given: descriptive diagnosis,  statement of range, remarks on taxonomy, list of specimens examined,  illustration of color pattern, and distribution map.      =Syrrhophus cystignathoides= (Cope)         _Phyllobates cystignathoides_ Cope, 1877:89-90          [Syntypes.--Originally USNM 32402-32409, (32405 now in MCZ)          from Potrero, near Cordoba, Veracruz, Mexico, Francis Sumichrast          collector.]    _Diagnosis._--Adults small, males 16.0 to 23.5 mm. in snout-vent length,  females 16.0-25.8 mm. in snout-vent length; vocal slits present in  males; finger tips slightly expanded; first finger longer than second;  outer metatarsal tubercle one-half size of inner, conical, compressed;  skin of dorsum weakly pustular, that of venter smooth to areolate;  tympanum 44 to 69 per cent diameter of eye (mean 55.5 per cent); ground  color yellow to brown in life with brown to black fleckings on dorsum  and flanks; limbs banded; interorbital bar present or not.    _Remarks._--Two geographic races (subspecies) are herein recognized;  previously these were held by various authors to be species (_campi_ and  _cystignathoides_). Intergradation occurs in southern Tamaulipas and  eastern San Luis Potosi, Mexico. The two subspecies can be distinguished  on the basis of color pattern and the condition of the skin of the  venter.    _Distribution._--Low to moderate elevations from the Rio Grande  embayment to central Veracruz, Mexico (Fig. 5).      =Syrrhophus cystignathoides campi= Stejneger, New combination         _Syrrhophus campi_ Stejneger, 1915:131-32. [Holotype.--USNM 52290,          from Brownsville, Cameron Co., Texas; R. D. Camp collector,          March 31, 1915]. Smith and Taylor, 1948:52. Martin, 1958:50.    _Diagnosis._--Venter smooth; usually no interorbital light and dark bars  present; ground color brown in life (Fig. 4a).    _Remarks._--Martin (1958) was the first author to point out  that _S. campi_ was probably a subspecies of the more southern  _S. cystignathoides_. Various references in the literature might lead  one to believe that the two were sympatric over much of northeastern  Mexico; this error was created by the use of a single character  (condition of the skin of the venter) to characterize the two  populations. Specimens from southern Texas have a smooth venter, lack  interorbital bars and have, in general, a brown ground color, whereas  specimens from central Veracruz have an areolate venter, interorbital  light and dark bars and a yellow ground color. In southern Tamaulipas  and eastern San Luis Potosi, these characters vary discordantly, thereby  strongly suggesting that the two populations intergrade. Both  populations agree in other morphological characters; therefore, they are  here treated as geographic variants.    _Etymology._--Named for the collector of the type specimens, Mr. R. D.  Camp of Brownsville, Texas.    _Distribution._--Lower Rio Grande embayment in Texas to central Nuevo  Leon and Tamaulipas, Mexico. Intergrades are known from southern  Tamaulipas and adjacent San Luis Potosi, Mexico (Fig. 5).    _Specimens examined._--(113) TEXAS, Cameron Co.: MCZ 10277-85, 10286  (10); Brownsville, AMNH 3215, 3218-20, 3221 (3), 5376, 62117, FMNH  105336, KU 8135-39, MCZ 3738-42, 3743 (10), TCWC 5908, 7139, TNHC 92-94,  20909, UMMZ 51760, 54031 (5), USNM 52290 (holotype); 22 mi.

Peters' (1871) original description corresponds well with  _S. cystignathoides_, and the type-locality (\"Huanusco\" = Huatusco) is  within the range of that species. Firschein (1954) expressed doubt that  _verruculatus_ was a _Syrrhophus_, because Peters placed it in another  genus. However, Peters described _verruculatus_ a decade before Cope  diagnosed the genus Syrrhophus. Most frogs now called _Syrrhophus_, plus  a number of lower Central American frogs now placed in a variety of  genera were placed in _Phyllobates_ by Boulenger, Cope, and Peters.    The types of _Phyllobates verruculatus_ were destroyed during World War  II (Guenther Peters, _in litt._); the specimens subsequently assigned to  the taxon by Kellogg (1932) are _Syrrhophus cystignathoides_. Because  the type specimens are lost and because the name antedates the more  established name, _cystignathoides_, I favor retaining _Phyllobates  verruculatus_ Peters as a _nomen dubium_.    Smith and Taylor (1948) reported _S. verruculatus_ from Tianguistengo,  Hidalgo, Mexico. These specimens are examples of _verrucipes_. Smith  (1947) reported a specimen of _verruculatus_ from San Lorenzo, Veracruz.  Firschein (1954) referred it to _cystignathoides_, and Duellman (1960)  concluded that both authors were in error and that the specimen (USNM  123530) was a _leprus_.    _Etymology._--The trivial name is the diminutive of _Cystignathus_, a  once-used generic name for several leptodactylid frogs.    _Distribution._--Low and moderate elevations in the foothills along the  Sierra Madre Oriental from eastern San Luis Potosi to Central Veracruz,  Mexico (Fig. 5).    _Specimens examined._--(130), MEXICO, _Puebla_: Necaxa, UMMZ 69519-20.  _San Luis Potosi_: 5 km.

Gold has  ever been the royal want, and nobles have always had open ears to  schemes that promised to fill the public treasury.    Magellan's interesting friend Francisco Serrao, who had remained in the  Indian possessions of the Portuguese, after Magellan's return, had  discovered resources of the tropical seas of the Orient that were almost  boundless. He had written to Magellan:    \"If you would become rich return to the Moluccas.\"    This letter would be a sufficient passport to the nobles who had the ear  of the King. He showed the letter to the King's ministers.    He thought that the point of South America turned _westward_, as the  Cape of Good Hope toward the East. He had an imaginary map in his mind  of an ocean world whose shape had no real existence, but that answered  well as a theory.    Magellan had brought a globe from Portugal on which he had drawn the  undiscovered world as he thought it existed. The strait which he had  hoped to find was omitted on this globe in his drawings that no  navigator might anticipate his discovery.    Some of the ministers listened to the project with indifference, a few  with ridicule; but as a rule Magellan appealed to willing ears. The  ministers as a body agreed to commend the enterprise to the King. The  Haros of Antwerp, the Rothschilds of the time, favored the expedition.  So Magellan and Faleiro made out a petition of formal proposals which  they desired to present to the King, and awaited the opportunity.    That opportunity soon came. Charles V, son of Joanna, who was passing  her days in solitude and grief on account of the loss of her husband,  was on his way to Aragon. He was Emperor of Germany and King of Spain.  He was a youth now; having been born in Ghent, February 24, 1500. He  came to the throne of Spain in 1516, as the disordered intellect of his  mother made her incapable of reigning. He was elected German Emperor in  1519.    [Illustration: Charles V. After a painting by Titian.]    In his youth he had been dissolute. Seeing the responsibilities that he  owed to the world and the age, he suddenly received new moral impulses  and conquered himself, and his moral life was followed by a religious  disposition. He received from the Pope the title of Roman Emperor. His  powerful intellect subdued a great part of continental Europe to his  will; but he became weary of the cares of state, retired from the  world, and ended his life as a religious recluse.    The young King entered Spain in triumph, but amid the glare of  receptions his ears were not dull to projects for acquiring gold.    Magellan and Faleiro, under the commendation of the ministry, were soon  able to lay their project before the young grandson of the great  Isabella. He received them in the spirit that Isabella had met Columbus.  He approved their plans, and charged them to make preparations for the  expedition.    Charles entered Zaragoza in May, 1518, a youth of eighteen, and Magellan  and Faleiro followed the royal train on its triumphal march in the  blooming days of the year. They were happy men, and their glowing  visions added to the joy of the court on its journey amid singing  nightingales and pealing bells.    The royal name signed to Magellan's commission was \"Juana,\" who had been  the favorite daughter of Queen Isabella, who had signed the commission  of Columbus.[A] This royal daughter of Aragon and Castile was born at  Toledo, November 6, 1479. She was in the bloom of her girlhood when the  news of the return of Columbus thrilled Spain.        [A] Donna Juana and Don Carlos, her son, by the grace of God, Queen      and King of Castile, Leon, Aragon, the two Sicilies, and Jerusalem, of      Navarra, Granada, Toledo, Valencia, Galicia, the Mallorcas, Seville,      Sardinia, Cordova, Corsica, Murcia, Jaen, the Algarves, of Aljazira,      Gibraltar, of the Canary Isles, of the Indies, isles and mainland of      the Ocean-sea, Counts of Barcelona, Lords of Biscay and Molina, Dukes      of Athens and Neopatria, Counts of Roussillon and Cerdana, Marquises      of Euristan and Gociano, Archdukes of Austria, Dukes of Bergona and      Brabant, Counts of Flanders and Tirol, etc.    She was a girl of ardent affections; a lover of music; not beautiful,  but charming in manner; and at the age of eighteen was betrothed to  Philip of the Low Countries, called Philip the Handsome.    The wedding of this daughter of Isabella was to be celebrated in  Flanders by fetes of unusual splendor. A fleet of one hundred and thirty  vessels prepared to bear the bride to her handsome Prince. The ships  were under the command of the chivalrous admiral of Castile.    Juana took leave of her mother at the end of August, 1496, and embarked  at the port of Laredo. A more interesting bride under more joyous  circumstances had seldom gone forth to meet a bridegroom.    The sails covered the sea under the flags of the glory of Spain. They  drifted away amid music and shoutings, but the salvos of the guns had  hardly died away before terrible storms arose. The fleet was shattered,  and many of the vessels were lost.    The young bride herself arrived in Flanders safely, and her marriage  with the archduke followed at Lille.    When Queen Isabella heard of the birth of Charles, she recalled that it  fell on the day of Matthias, and exclaimed, \"_Sors cecidit super  Mathiam_\"--\"the lot fell upon Matthias.\"    She predicted that the infant would become the King of Spain.    [Illustration: Ferdinand and Isabella. From a coin.]    Philip and Juana were summoned to Spain to meet the people over whom it  then seemed probable that they would soon be called to reign. They  entered France in 1501, attended by Flemish nobles, and wherever they  went was a holiday. There were weeks of splendid fetes in honor of the  progress.    When Ferdinand and Isabella heard of the arrival of Philip and Juana in  Spain they hastened to Toledo to meet them. Here Philip and his Queen  received the allegiance of the Cortes.    But Philip was a gay Prince, and he loved the dissipations of Flanders  more than his wife or the interests of his prospective Spanish  possessions. So he left his wife, and returned to Flanders.    The conduct of the handsome Prince drove Juana mad. She loved him so  fondly that she thought only of him, and sat in silence day after day  with her eyes fixed on the ground, as an historian says, \"equally  regardless of herself, her future subjects, and her afflicted parents.\"    She subsequently joined Philip at Burgos. Here Philip died of fever  after overexertion at a game of ball. Juana never left his bedside, or  shed a tear. Her grief obliterated nearly all things in life, and she  was dumb. Her only happiness now, except in music, was to be with his  dead body.    She removed her husband's remains to Santa Clara.    The body was placed on a magnificent car, and was accompanied in the  long way to the tomb by a train of nobles and priests. Juana never left  it. She would not allow it to be moved by day. She said:    \"A widow who has lost the sun of her soul should never expose herself to  the light of day!\"    Wherever the procession halted, she ordered new funeral ceremonies. She  forbade nuns to approach the body. Finding the coffin had been carried  to a nunnery at a stage of the journey, she had it removed to the open  fields, where she watched by it, and caused the embalmed body to be  revealed to her by torches. She had a tomb made for the remains in sight  of her palace windows in Santa Clara, and she watched over it in silence  for forty-seven years, taking little interest in any other thing.    But as she survived Ferdinand and Isabella, her name for a time was  affixed to royal commissions, and so Magellan sailed in the service of  Charles under the signature of Juana, who was silently watching over her  husband's tomb, in the hope that the Prince would one day rise again.    We relate this narrative to give a view of the events of the period, and  for the same reason we must speak of another eminent person who acted in  the place of the Queen in her unhappy state of mind.    [Illustration: Cardinal Ximenes. After a painting by Velasquez.]    This was the great political genius of the time, the virtuous and  benevolent Cardinal Ximenes, statesman, archbishop, the heart of the  people and the conscience of the Church. He was born of a humble family  in Castile in 1487. He was educated in Rome. His character and learning  were such that Queen Isabella chose him for her confessor, and made him  Archbishop of Toledo, with the approval of the Pope.    On the death of Philip in 1505, he was made regent for Juana. Ferdinand  named Ximenes regent of Spain on his deathbed, until Charles V should  return from Flanders to Spain.    The regency of Ximenes was one of honor and glory. He himself lived  humbly and simply amid all his associations of pomp and power.    He maintained thirty poor persons daily at his own cost, and gave half  of his income to charity. He excited the jealousy of Charles V at last,  and lost his power in consequence. He lived to extreme age, and left a  character that Spain has ever loved to hold in honor.    Such was the political condition of Spain in the early days of  Magellan.          CHAPTER V.    ABOUT THE HAPPY ITALIAN WHO WISHED TO SEE THE WORLD.--BEAUTIFUL SEVILLE!      We should have known but little of the adventures of Magellan, but for  Antonia Pigafetta, Chevalier, and Knight of Rhodes.    He was a young Italian of a susceptible heart and happy imagination.    He came wandering to Barcelona, Spain, in the generation that remembered  Columbus, and the splendid scenes that welcomed the return of Columbus  on the field of Sante Fe. He must have heard the enthralling description  of those golden days--he could not be a Columbus; but, if he could win  the good will of Magellan, he might go after Columbus"]]]
