The end being merely a question of hours General Leman ordered the  evacuation of the city by the infantry. He wisely decided it could be of  more service to the Belgian army at Dyle, than held in a beleaguered and  doomed city. Reports indicate that this retreat, though successfully  performed, was precipitate. The passage of it was scattered with arms,  equipment, and supplies of all kinds. An ambulance train was abandoned,  twenty locomotives left in the railway station, and but one bridge  destroyed in rear beyond immediate repair. After its accomplishment,  General Leman took command of the northern forts, determined to hold  them against Von Kluck until the last Belgian gun was silenced.    Early on August 7, 1914, Burgomaster Kleyer and the Bishop of Liege  negotiated terms for the surrender of the city. It had suffered but  slight damage from the bombardment. Few of the citizens were reported  among the killed or injured. On behalf of the Germans it must be said  their occupation of Liege was performed in good order, with military  discipline excellently maintained. They behaved at first fairly  impartial in establishing their rule in the city, and paid for all  supplies requisitioned. They were quartered in various public buildings  and institutions, probably to the number of 10,000. The German troops at  first seemed to present an interesting spectacle. They were mostly young  men, reported as footsore from their long march in new, imperfectly  fitting boots, and hungry from the lack of accompanying commissariat.  This is proof that the German's military machine did not work to  perfection at the outset. Later, alleged hostile acts by Belgian  individuals moved the German military authorities to seize a group of  the principal citizens, and warn the inhabitants that the breaking of a  peaceful attitude would be at the risk of swiftly serious punishment.  Precautions to enforce order were such as is provided in martial law,  and carried out in the beginning with some show of fairness. The Germans  appeared anxious to restore confidence and win a feeling of good will.    For some days after the capitulation of the city the northern forts  continued a heroic resistance. So long as these remained uncaptured,  General Leman maintained that, strategically, Liege had not fallen. He  thus held in check the armies of Von Kluck and Von Buelow, when every  hour was of supreme urgency for their respective onsweep into central  Belgium and up the Meuse Valley. The Germans presently brought into an  overpowering bombardment their 11-inch siege guns.    On August 13, 1914, Embourg was stricken into ruin. On the same day the  electric lighting apparatus of Fort Boncelles having been destroyed, the  few living men of its garrison fought through the following night in  darkness, and in momentary danger of suffocation from gases emitted by  the exploding German shells.    Early in the morning of August 14, 1914, though its cupolas were  battered in and shells rained upon the interior, the commander refused  an offer of surrender. A little later the concrete inner chamber walls  fell in. The commander of Boncelles, having exhausted his defensive,  hoisted the white flag. He had held out for eleven days in a veritable  death-swept inferno.    Fort Loncin disputed with Boncelles the honor of being the last to  succumb. The experience of its garrison differed only in terrible  details from Boncelles. Its final gun shot was fired by a man with his  left hand, since the other had been severed. Apparently a shell exploded  in its magazine, and blew up the whole fort. General Leman was  discovered amid its debris, pinned beneath a huge beam. He was released  by his own men. When taken to a trench, a German officer found that he  was merely unconscious from shock.    When sufficiently recovered, General Leman was conducted to General von  Emmich to tender his personal surrender. The two had previously been  comrades at maneuvers. The report of their meeting is given by a German  officer. The guard presented the customary salute due General Leman's  rank. General von Emmich advanced a few steps to meet General Leman.  Both generals saluted.    \"General,\" said Von Emmich, \"you have gallantly and nobly held your  forts.\"    \"I thank you,\" Leman replied. \"Our troops have lived up to their  reputation. War is not like maneuvers, _mon General_,\" he added with a  pointed smile. \"I ask you to bear witness that you found me  unconscious.\"    General Leman unbuckled his sword to offer it to the victor.    Von Emmich bowed.    \"No, keep it,\" he gestured. \"To have crossed swords with you has been an  honor.\"    Subsequently the President of the French Republic bestowed on Liege the  Cross of the Legion of Honor. To its motto in this instance might have  been added appropriately: Liege, the Savior of Paris. The few days of  its resistance to an overwhelming force enabled the Belgium army to  improve its mobilization, the British to throw an expeditionary army  into France, and the French to make a new offensive alignment. It will  forever remain a brilliant page in war annals. In a military estimate it  proved that forts constructed on the latest scientific principles, but  unsupported by an intrenched field army, crumple under the concentrated  fire of long-range, high-power enemy guns.    The fall of the northern and eastern Liege forts released Von Kluck's  army for its march into central Belgium. Meanwhile the Belgian army had  been concentrated on a line of the River Dyle, with its left touching  Malines and its right resting on Louvain. Its commander, General  Selliers de Moranville, made his headquarters in the latter city. The  Belgian force totaled 110,000 men of all complements. Whether this  included the reenforcement by the Liege infantry is uncertain.    During August 10 and 11, 1914, General Moranville threw forward  detachments to screen his main body in front of the German advance. On  the 11th a rumor that the French had crossed the Sambre, moved General  Moranville to extend his right wing to Eghezee, with the hope of getting  in touch with the Allies. That the French and British were hastening to  his support could not be doubted. They were already overdue, but  assuredly would come soon. That was the Belgian reliance, passing from  mouth to mouth among the Court, Cabinet Ministers, General Staff, down  to the factory toilers, miners, and peasants on their farms. The Sambre  report, like many others in various places, proved unfounded.          CHAPTER III    BELGIUM'S DEFIANCE      A view of the general situation in Belgium will assist in clearing the  way for swiftly following events. Germany had invaded Belgium against  the diplomatic and active protests of its Government. But the German  Government still hoped that the heroic resistance of Liege would satisfy  Belgian national spirit, and a free passage of German troops now be  granted. The German Emperor made a direct appeal to the King of the  Belgians through the medium of the Queen of Holland. From the German  point of outlook their victory could best be attained by the march  through Belgium upon Paris. The German Government asserted that the  French and British contemplated a similar breach of Belgian neutrality.  To their mind, it was a case of which should be on the ground first. On  the other hand, the Allies pronounced the German invasion of Belgium an  unprovoked assault, and produced countertestimony. The controversy has  continued to this day. But the war as it progressed has seen many  breaches of neutrality, and a certain resignation to the inevitable has  succeeded the moral indignation so easily aroused in its early stages.    Let us now glance at the condition of Belgium when war was declared. The  Belgians were an industrial and not a militant people. They had ample  reason to yearn for a permanent peace. Their country had been the  cockpit of Europe from the time of Caesar until Waterloo. The names of  their cities, for the most part, represented great historic battle  fields. Again and again had the ruin of conflict swept over their  unfortunately situated land. At all periods the Belgians were brave  fighters on one side or the other, for Belgium had been denied a  national unity. Doubtless, therefore, they welcomed the establishment of  their independent sovereignty and the era of peace which followed.  Historically, they had suffered enough, with an abundance to spare, from  perpetual warfare. Their minds turned hopefully toward industrial and  commercial activity, stimulated by the natural mineral wealth of their  soil. Thus the products of their factories reached all countries, South  America, China, Manchuria, and Central Africa, especially of later  years, where a great territory had been acquired in the Congo. The iron  and steel work of Liege was famous, Antwerp had become one of the chief  ports of Europe and growing into a financial power. But owing to the  confined boundaries of Belgium, there grew to be a congestion of  population. This produced a strong democratic and socialistic uplift  which even threatened the existence of the monarchy. Also, all that  monarchy seemed to imply.    The Belgians, doubtless with memories of the past, despised and hated  the display of military. Consequently it was only with difficulty, and  in the face of popular opposition, that the Belgium Government had  succeeded with military plans for defense, but imperfectly carried out.  Herein, perhaps, we have the keynote to Belgium's desperate resistance  to the German invaders. In the light of the foregoing, it is easily  conceivable that the Germans represented to the Belgians the military  yoke. They were determined to have none of it, upon any overtures or  terms. But they relied on France and England for protection, when common  prudence should have made the mobilization of an up-to-date army of  500,000 men ready"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29329"],[0,"Sandwiches (#4)"],[1,"crusts and cut into triangles.  Heap these at once on a napkin and send to the table.      Curried Oyster Sandwiches    Butter a slice of bread before you take it off the loaf; cut it about a  half inch thick and remove the crusts. First of all, cover each slice  with a thin layer of hard-boiled egg that has been pressed through a  sieve or chopped very fine. In the center of this sandwich put the soft  parts of six pickled oysters. Put a tablespoonful of butter and one of  flour into a little saucepan; mix without melting; add a gill of thick  cream, a teaspoonful of onion juice and a teaspoonful of curry and a  half teaspoonful of turmeric. Bring to boiling point; beat and stand  away until perfectly cold. When you are ready to serve the sandwiches,  cover each one with a thin layer of this sauce; put a slice of bread on  top, press together, and serve. The sauce must not go over the  sandwiches until you are ready to serve; and then, remember, you have  but one layer between two slices of bread.      Curried Egg Sandwiches    Hard boil four eggs, remove the yolks from the whites; chop the whites  very, very fine, and press the yolks through a sieve. Add to the yolks  gradually four tablespoonfuls of melted butter or olive oil, a half  teaspoonful of salt, a teaspoonful of onion juice, a half teaspoonful of  curry, and rub until thoroughly smooth. Spread thin slices of bread,  cover them with a very thin layer of the yolk mixture, then a layer of  the chopped whites, another slice of buttered bread. Press together,  trim the crusts and cut into shapes.      Curried Sardine Sandwiches    Remove the heads, tails and bones from one large box of sardines. Rub  them to a paste, add a tablespoonful of melted butter, a half  teaspoonful of curry powder and a saltspoonful of salt. Spread this  mixture between slices of buttered bread, press the two together, trim  the crusts and cut into shape.      Curried Chicken Sandwiches    Chop sufficient cold boiled chicken to make a half pint. Rub together  one tablespoonful of butter and one tablespoonful of flour; add a half  cupful of cold milk, and stir over hot water until you have a smooth,  thick paste. Add the chicken gradually to this, mashing and rubbing all  the while. Add a level teaspoonful of curry powder, a half teaspoonful  of salt, a teaspoonful of onion juice and a teaspoonful of lemon juice.  When cold, spread between layers of buttered bread, trim the crusts and  cut into shapes.    Almost any bits of left-over meat may be substituted for the chicken and  made into sandwiches of this kind.      Crab Sandwiches    Remove the meat from six hard-boiled crabs; mix it with four  tablespoonfuls of mayonnaise dressing; put it between slices of bread  and butter and press two together; trim off the crusts, cut into  triangles and serve at once.    Crab and lobster sandwiches should not be allowed to stand for more than  an hour, and then must be wrapped carefully in a clean, damp cloth.      Cream of Chicken Sandwiches    Take sufficient white meat of chicken to make a half cup; chop and  pound it; reduce it to a paste. Put a teaspoonful of granulated gelatin  in two tablespoonfuls of cold water; then stand it over the fire until  it has dissolved. Whip a half pint of cream to a stiff froth. Add the  gelatin to the chicken; add a teaspoonful of grated horseradish and a  half teaspoonful of salt. Stir this until it begins to thicken, cool and  add carefully the whipped cream and stand it away until very cold. When  ready to make the sandwiches, butter the bread and cut the slices a  little thicker than the usual slices for sandwiches. Cover each slice  with this cream mixture; trim off the crusts and cut sandwiches into  fancy shapes. Garnish the top with olives cut into rings. In the center  of each sandwich make just a little mound of capers, using the olives at  the four corners; each sandwich may be garnished in a different way.  Little pieces of celery, with the white top attached, make also a pretty  garnish. These sandwiches are not covered with a second slice of bread.      Deviled Sandwiches    Chop a quarter of a pound of cold, boiled tongue very fine; add to it  two tablespoonfuls of olive oil, a dash of red pepper, a teaspoonful of  Worcestershire sauce, and a saltspoonful of paprika; mix and add the  hard-boiled yolks of three eggs that have been pressed through a sieve.  Put this between thin slices of bread and butter, and garnish with water  cress.      Egg Sandwiches No. 1    Take the hard-boiled yolks of six eggs and rub them to a paste, adding  gradually two tablespoonfuls of olive oil or thick cream. Add a dash of  paprika, one-half teaspoonful of salt, spread and finish precisely the  same as tongue sandwich.      Egg Sandwiches No. 2    Put thin slices of hard-boiled eggs between slices of brown bread and  butter; dust the egg slightly with salt and pepper. Trim the edges of  the sandwiches with either cress or lettuce, and cut into triangles or  squares.      Fish Sandwiches    Rub to a smooth paste a quarter of a pound of cold, boiled fish; add  half a teaspoonful of Worcestershire sauce, a tablespoonful of olive  oil, a half saltspoonful of salt, and a half saltspoonful of black  pepper. Spread the slices of bread on the loaf, cut them off about a  half inch in thickness; trim off the crusts, put on each slice dainty  lettuce leaves, and fill the center with the fish mixture. Cover with  another layer of buttered bread from which you have trimmed the crusts,  and press the two together.      Flaked Fish Sandwiches    Flake cold boiled white fleshed fish, dust it with salt and pepper and  sprinkle it with lemon juice. Butter thin slices of brown bread; do not  trim off the crusts. Put on one slice a layer of thin crisp cucumber,  cover this with flaked fish, put a tablespoonful of mayonnaise in the  center, put on another layer of chopped cress, then a slice of buttered  brown bread. Press together and cut into halves.      Spanish Sandwiches    Mash the hard-boiled yolks of three eggs, add twelve boiled shrimps,  either pounded in a mortar or chopped very fine. Add three  tablespoonfuls of olive oil or butter, a tablespoonful of tomato catsup,  two saltspoonfuls of paprika, four tablespoonfuls of chopped parsley, a  half teaspoonful of salt, and at last stir in four tablespoonfuls of  mayonnaise dressing. Spread this between thin slices of buttered bread,  trim the crusts and cut into shape.      Salmon Sandwiches    Flake cold boiled salmon, or open a can of salmon, drain it free from  oil and break the fish apart in good-sized flakes; sprinkle them with  salt, pepper and lemon juice. Butter slices of whole wheat or brown  bread, cover with a layer of the salmon, then a thick layer of chopped  cress or shredded celery. Put a tablespoonful of mayonnaise in the  middle and cover with another slice of buttered bread. Press together,  trim the crusts and cut into triangles.      Swedish Sandwiches    Flake any cold cooked fish, dust it with salt, pepper and lemon juice.  Rub the bottom of a bowl with a clove of garlic, add a half cupful of  mayonnaise, four finely chopped gherkins, twelve chopped olives and two  tablespoonfuls of capers. Mix and stir in two tablespoonfuls of finely  chopped parsley. Spread a thin layer of this dressing over a plain slice  of bread, do not butter the bread, cover it with fish, put on top a  crisp lettuce leaf, then cover with another slice of bread that has been  spread with the dressing. Press, trim the crusts and cut into fingers.      French Chicken Sandwiches    Chop the white meat of one chicken very fine; pound to a paste. Add  one-half teaspoonful of salt and a dash of red pepper. Cover one  tablespoonful of gelatin, with a tablespoonful of cold water, soak it  for about five minutes, then add to it ten tablespoonfuls of thick  cream; stand this over teakettle and stir until gelatin is dissolved.  Now, beat into this the chicken, stand it aside in a square pan until  cold. Cut the chicken into very thin slices; put a slice on a slice of  buttered bread; cover this with another slice of bread and cut into  shape.      Game Sandwiches    Remove the breasts from two partridges after they have been baked or  roasted. Chop the meat rather fine; reduce two sardines to a paste.  While you are mashing the sardines, add gradually about two  tablespoonfuls of soft butter, a dash of red pepper and a half  teaspoonful of salt. Spread the bread first with the sardine paste; then  sprinkle over the chopped game; dust this with salt and a little pepper;  cover with another slice of bread, press lightly; trim into shape.      German Sandwiches    Cut thin slices of rye bread; butter before you take them from the loaf.  Spread each slice with a thin layer of limburger cheese. Cut bologna  sausage into the thinnest possible slices; cover the limburger with the  sliced bologna, and then a thin piece of pumpernickel; cover with  another slice of bread that has been coated with a layer of cheese.  Press the two together; do not remove the crusts. Serve on a napkin in a  wicker basket.      Ham Sandwiches    Chop cold boiled ham very fine. To each cupful of this ham, after it  has been chopped, stir in two tablespoonfuls of melted butter, dash of  red pepper and about one-half teaspoonful of onion juice. Have bread  sufficiently stale to cut nicely. Remove end crust, butter and cut a  very thin slice; remove the crusts, and spread with the ham paste. Serve  same as tongue sandwiches.      Indian Sandwiches    Take two sardines, remove skin and bones, put them into mortar and pound  fine; add a teaspoonful of anchovy paste, a dash of salt and red pepper  and the hard-boiled yolks of six eggs, rubbed smooth; stir two  tablespoonfuls of olive oil into the mixture at the last. Cut bread into  slices about half an inch thick, remove crusts, then cut into  crescent-shaped pieces, toast, butter and cover with the mixture,"]]]
