The following winter the same pack, or another  of the same number, was seen southwest of Three Oaks, and four of the  pack were killed just over the Indiana line.    _Vulpes fulva._ Eastern red fox. Common in the region. One was killed  in December, 1919, after having been chased from the Warren Woods by  dogs. Another was seen in January, 1920, half a mile north of Three  Oaks. In preceding winters a number have been killed south of Sawyer  where they evidently come from the sand dunes.    _Lutra canadensis canadensis._ Canada otter. Formerly occurred along  the streams, but are now apparently all gone.    _Felis couguar._ Cougar. One was killed a few miles northeast of Three  Oaks many years ago. Another was killed near New Buffalo in the early  days.    _Lynx ruffus ruffus._ Bobcat. One was killed a few years ago near the  Galien River a few miles northeast of Three Oaks.    _Erethizon dorsatum dorsatum._ Canada porcupine. Found here in the  early days.    _Sciurus carolinensis leucotis._ Northeastern gray squirrel. Black  squirrels were found in numbers in the early days.    _Glaucomys volans volans._ Eastern flying squirrel. Said to be common. A  large number were seen by Mr. Schmidt on one old stub in Warren Woods  some years ago. Several were seen in 1918 by Mr. Fox in second-growth  oak woods in a little ravine about one and one-fourth mile west of  Warren Woods. One was caught in Three Oaks in the fall of 1919.    _Cervus canadensis canadensis._ American elk. One horn from a large  swamp in Berrien County is in the Chamberlain Memorial Museum of Three  Oaks.    _Odocoileus virginianus borealis._ Northern white-tailed deer.  Formerly abundant in the region. Several molars were picked up in  Warren Woods.          FOSSIL MAMMALS OF BERRIEN COUNTY      The records of fossil mammals from Berrien County here published have  been collected by George R. Fox, who has also kindly loaned from the  collections under his care several specimens for identification. Dr.  E. C. Case assisted with the identification of the mammoth teeth.    _Mammut americanum._ Mastodon. (1) About 1897 the teeth of a mastodon  were dug up by a dredge within the village limits of Eau Claire. Their  disposition is unknown.    (2) At Snow, in section 36, Lake Township, a tooth was found. This  came into the possession of Frank Striker of Buchanan.    (3) A portion of a tusk and part of a skull were found on the Beebe  Farm near Baroda. These were sent to Washington, D.C.    (4) In the excavation of a ditch through a small marsh lying near  Bakerstown in Section 3, of Bertrand Township, the dredge uncovered in  the distance of between two and three miles bones, teeth, and other  evidences of six mastodons. Of these remains the most important was a  nearly complete skull with teeth in place and disintegrated parts of  the tusks. The skull was secured by Dr. E. H. Crane, who restored  parts, the tusks he did not attempt to restore. This skull is now on  exhibition at the Ward Museum, Rochester, New York.    The skull lay about seven feet deep. It was under a bed of matted oak  brush on top of which lay a huge stone slab, estimated to weigh two or  three tons. Above was a layer of silt, then gravelly clay; above were  more silt beds, three in number. W. Hillis Smith, who helped Dr. Crane  secure the skull, furnished the above information.    (5) On the Avery marsh, two miles east of Three Oaks, a badly decayed  mastodon skull and several teeth were excavated in 1884. Dr. Bonine,  Sr., of Niles, assisted at the excavation. The bones and teeth were in  the muck about twenty inches below the surface. Other teeth, making  seven in all, were found near the same place. Some of the teeth from  this locality are on exhibition at the Chamberlain Memorial Museum of  Three Oaks.    In addition to the above there are several indefinite records of  mastodon remains from the county.    _Elephas columbi._ Columbian mammoth. (1) One-half of the tooth of a  mammoth was found in the spring of 1917 on the Beeson and Holden farm in  Section 6, NE. 1/4, Township of Galien, by D. H. Beeson while  cultivating corn. Two weeks later the other half of the tooth was found.  The specimen is now in the Chamberlain Memorial Museum of Three Oaks.    The specimen is a well-worn lower third molar having twenty  ridge-plates, but some of the ridge-plates have been worn out and lost.  Seven and a half ridge-plates are included in a 100 mm. line. The  greatest length of the tooth is 280 mm. and its greatest breadth 95 mm.    (2) A complete set of mammoth teeth with some portions of the bones was  found about the year 1900 on a farm two miles southeast of Three Oaks  owned by E. K. Warren. They were discovered while digging post holes.  The specimens are on exhibition in the Chamberlain Memorial Museum.    One of the teeth sent us for identification proves to be a partly worn  lower third molar having twenty-four ridge-plates. There are seven and  a half ridge-plates in 100 mm. The greatest length of the tooth is 350  mm. and its greatest breadth 95 mm.    (3) There is another record of a mammoth tooth which was found at an  unknown location in Berrien County. It was at one time owned by Mr.  Smith, who gave it to Dr. Crane. Its present whereabouts is unknown.          PLATE I      A mud bar beside the Galien River in Warren Woods.

Average external measurements of  seven adults (two males and five females) are: total length, 138.0  (130-150); length of tail, 65.3 (59-74); length of hind foot, 17.1  (15-18.5); length of ear (six specimens only), 6.8 (6-7); weight in  grams (five specimens only), 12.9 (11.2-14.6). Selected cranial  measurements of the two males and two of the females are, respectively,  as follows: occipitonasal length, 24.0, 23.2, 23.5, 22.3; interorbital  breadth, 4.9, 5.2, 5.0, 5.0; mastoid breadth, 13.0, 13.1, 12.2, 11.9;  length of maxillary toothrow, 3.3, 3.3, 3.1, 3.4.      ~Perognathus hispidus paradoxus~ Merriam, 1889    Hispid Pocket Mouse    An adult female, not reproductively active, that was trapped in rather  sparsely vegetated rangeland to the southwest of Slim Buttes (14 mi. S  and 4 mi. W Reva) on July 19, 1961, is the only specimen of the hispid  pocket mouse on record from Harding County. Other species of small  mammals taken in the same or adjacent traplines were _Perognathus  fasciatus_, _Dipodomys ordii_, _Reithrodontomys megalotis_, _Peromyscus  maniculatus_, and _Onychomys leucogaster_.    A single individual reported from Wade, Grant Co., North Dakota, by  Bailey (1927:123), approximately 100 miles to the northeast, is the only  specimen known from a more northerly locality.      ~Dipodomys ordii terrosus~ Hoffmester, 1942    Ord's Kangaroo Rat    _Specimens examined_ (13).--NE 1/4 sec. 22, R. 1 E, T. 23 N, 6; 2 mi. N,  5 mi. W Ludlow, 1; 2 mi. S, 11 mi. W Reva, 1; 14 mi. S, 4 mi. W Reva, 4;  15 mi. S, 4 mi. W Reva, 1.    Ord's kangaroo rat is found in sparsely vegetated flatlands throughout  Harding County, although it appears to be uncommon except in localized  areas of relatively sandy soils. Five of seven specimens taken from June  18 through 24, 1961, were young of the year, as were three of six  individuals trapped on May 31, 1968. One adult female (81.1 grams)  obtained on May 31 was lactating and had four placental scars, whereas  another that weighed 67.2 grams evidenced no recent reproductive  activity. An adult male (67.9 grams) taken on May 31 had testes that  measured 9; those of a subadult male (46.5 grams) taken on the same date  measured only 6.    The two May-taken adult females mentioned above still were completely in  winter pelage, but the adult male trapped at the same time was molting.  An adult male (57.2 grams) obtained on June 22 had completed molt save  for a small patch between the ears and immediately behind the head.      ~Castor canadensis missouriensis~ Bailey, 1919    Beaver    _Specimens examined_ (2).--Sec. 22, R. 1 E, T. 20 N, 1; 32 mi. SE  Buffalo, 1.    According to local residents, the beaver is common along many of the  water courses in the county. One of our two specimens came from a  tributary of the Little Missouri River north of Camp Crook and the other  was taken from a tributary of the Moreau River in the southeastern part  of the county. Robert Kriege of Buffalo reported to us that beaver are  not restricted to wooded areas, but frequently inhabit streams and more  or less permanent impoundments bordered by grassland. In such places  they are said to construct bank dens and eat principally sage and forbs.    Visher (1914:89) reported this species along the Little Missouri River,  Boxelder Creek, the forks of Grand River, Bull Creek, and \"Devil's  Gulch\" in the North Cave Hills, and figured (pl. 6) a dam on Rabbit  Creek. We have observed evidence of beaver activity along the Little  Missouri River southwest of Ladner and along aspen-wooded stream banks  in the Short Pine Hills, where in the spring of 1963 abundant sign was  found.      ~Reithrodontomys megalotis dychei~ J. A. Allen, 1895    Western Harvest Mouse    _Specimens examined_ (27).--NE 1/4 sec. 22, R. 1 E, T. 23 N, 1; 4 mi. S,  7 mi. W Ladner, 3; 2 mi. N, 5 mi. W Ludlow, 7; 1/2 mi. W Reva, 14; 10  mi. S, 5 mi. W Reva, 1; 14 mi. S, 4 mi. W Reva, 1.    The western harvest mouse was taken commonly in stands of tall grasses  and forbs, particularly along roadways and fencerows. Occasional  individuals were trapped in areas of mixed shrubs and grasses. Four  pregnant females taken in late June carried the following number of  embryos (crown-rump lengths in parentheses): seven (4), six (5), six  (10), five (4). Three adult males taken in the same period had testes  that measured 7, 7, and 8, whereas those of two May-taken males measured  12 and 6.    Molt from winter to summer pelage was in progress, from anterior to  posterior, on both the dorsum and venter of many May- and June-taken  animals. Some individuals had completed molt, or had but a small patch  of winter pelage remaining on the rump, as early as the last week in  June.      ~Reithrodontomys montanus albescens~ Cary, 1903    Plains Harvest Mouse    _Specimens examined_ (3).--2 mi. N, 5 mi. W Ludlow, 2; 1/2 mi. W Reva,  1.    This harvest mouse is uncommon in northwestern South Dakota, although  the species probably occurs sparingly in upland grassy habitats  throughout Harding County. Our specimens, along with one in the  collections of the University of Michigan Museum of Zoology, not  previously reported, from 11 mi. S Mandan, Morton Co., North Dakota,  represent the northernmost known records of this mouse.    A young adult female, obtained on June 21, carried three embryos that  measured 17 and was in summer pelage; an adult male taken on June 27  still was in a worn winter pelage.    At the locality 1/2 mi. W Reva, where traps were set in sparse to  relatively lush grassy areas along South Dakota Highway 20, the  following small mammals were taken in the same trapline (or adjacent  lines) in which one plains harvest mouse was captured: _Spermophilus  tridecemlineatus pallidus_, _Reithrodontomys megalotis dychei_,  _Peromyscus maniculatus nebrascensis_, _Microtus ochrogaster haydenii_,  and _Microtus pennsylvanicus insperatus_.      ~Peromyscus leucopus aridulus~ Osgood, 1909    White-footed Mouse    Seven adults of this woodland inhabitant were trapped along  shrub-covered banks of the spring-fed stream and small impoundment in  Deer Draw of the Slim Buttes (10 mi. S and 5 mi. W Reva). Deciduous  trees grew in the bottom of the draw, but the slopes above supported  ponderosa pine and juniper. No white-footed mice were found along the  generally treeless tributaries of the Moreau and Grand rivers to the  east of Slim Buttes nor were these mice found along the Little Missouri  River or in likely-looking habitat in the North Cave Hills. The _P.  leucopus_ of Deer Draw likely represent, therefore, an isolated segment  of a formerly much more broadly distributed population of white-footed  mice on the Northern Great Plains in post-Wisconsin times. Other such  populations may exist in Slim Buttes and perhaps elsewhere in the  county. _Zapus hudsonius_ and _Microtus pennsylvanicus_ were trapped in  Deer Draw in association with white-footed mice.    Females collected on June 15 and August 7 were lactating and one taken  on June 20 contained six embryos that measured 15. Two males taken on  June 2 had testes that measured 12 and 15. These two males and a  lactating female taken on June 15 still were in winter pelage, whereas a  non-breeding female obtained on June 15 and a male and female (pregnant)  trapped on June 20 were in summer pelage or an advanced stage of molt to  that pelage. A lactating female taken on August 7 was in summer pelage  excepting that what definitely appeared to be new winter pelage was  present on the head, cheeks, and below the ears, and molt was evident  adjacent to these areas.    Selected average (and extreme) measurements of the seven adults from  Deer Draw are: total length, 184.4 (175-199); length of tail, 77.4  (70-88); length of hind foot, 21.1 (20-22); length of ear, 16.7 (16-18);  greatest length of skull, 27.8 (27.0-28.4); zygomatic breadth, 14.6  (14.0-14.9); least interorbital width, 4.1 (4.0-4.3); length of  maxillary toothrow, 4.2 (4.0-4.4). Three males and two non-pregnant  females weighed 34.9, 34.6, 30.5, 32.2, and 31.4 grams, respectively.      ~Peromyscus maniculatus nebrascensis~ (Coues, 1877)    Deer Mouse    _Specimens examined_ (214).--19 mi.

W Camp  Crook, 3300 ft., 2; NW 1/4 sec. 32, R. 1 E, T. 20 N, 4; 1/2 mi. W Reva,  2; SW 1/4 sec. 30, R. 7 E, T. 18 N, 5; 9 mi. S, 7 mi. W Reva, 3; 10 mi.  S, 5 mi. W Reva, 64; 14-15 mi. S, 4 mi. W Reva, 33; 2 mi. S, 5 mi. E  Harding, 16; 7 mi. S, 4-1/2 mi. E Harding, 3.    The deer mouse is the most abundant and widespread small mammal in  northwestern South Dakota. We took specimens in all terrestrial  habitats, although the species was commonest in upland situations such  as grassy fencerows, rocky areas, and hillsides supporting shrubs,  juniper, or pine.    Adult mice in reproductive condition were taken in each month from May  through August, although most of our information is for the months of  May and June. In the last half of May, seven pregnant females carried an  average of 5.0 (4-6) embryos that ranged in crown-rump length from 2 to  10; three others taken in the same period had six, six, and three recent  placental scars, and another was lactating. Twenty-three males collected  late in May had testes that measured 5 to 15 (average 10.2). In the last  half of June, 19 females contained an average of 4.9 (2-7) embryos that  ranged in size from 3 to 30 in crown-rump length, and two more were  lactating; seven males obtained in the period June 15-25 had testes that  averaged 8.7 (8-10).    Additionally, we took lactating females on July 6, July 7, and August 7,  and two individuals with recent placental scars on August 5. Twenty  adult males collected in the period July 6 to 18 had testes that  averaged 9.3 (6-11.5),"]]]
