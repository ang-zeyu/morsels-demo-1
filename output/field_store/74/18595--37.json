Great Jove,           Who shakes heaven's highest temples with his thunder,             And I, poor mortal man, not do the same!           I did it, and with all my heart I did it.\"    Not one whit more easily are the words learnt for all this vileness;  but by their means the vileness is committed with less shame. Not that  I blame the words, being, as it were, choice and precious vessels; but  that wine of error which is drunk to us in them by intoxicated teachers;  and if we, too, drink not, we are beaten, and have no sober judge to  whom we may appeal. Yet, O my God (in whose presence I now without hurt  may remember this), all this unhappily I learnt willingly with great  delight, and for this was pronounced a hopeful boy.    Bear with me, my God, while I say somewhat of my wit, Thy gift, and on  what dotages I wasted it. For a task was set me, troublesome enough to  my soul, upon terms of praise or shame, and fear of stripes, to speak  the words of Juno, as she raged and mourned that she could not            \"This Trojan prince from Latinum turn.\"    Which words I had heard that Juno never uttered; but we were forced to  go astray in the footsteps of these poetic fictions, and to say in prose  much what he expressed in verse. And his speaking was most applauded, in  whom the passions of rage and grief were most preeminent, and clothed  in the most fitting language, maintaining the dignity of the character.  What is it to me, O my true life, my God, that my declamation was  applauded above so many of my own age and class? is not all this smoke  and wind? and was there nothing else whereon to exercise my wit and  tongue? Thy praises, Lord, Thy praises might have stayed the yet tender  shoot of my heart by the prop of Thy Scriptures; so had it not trailed  away amid these empty trifles, a defiled prey for the fowls of the air.  For in more ways than one do men sacrifice to the rebellious angels.    But what marvel that I was thus carried away to vanities, and went out  from Thy presence, O my God, when men were set before me as models, who,  if in relating some action of theirs, in itself not ill, they committed  some barbarism or solecism, being censured, were abashed; but when  in rich and adorned and well-ordered discourse they related their own  disordered life, being bepraised, they gloried? These things Thou seest,  Lord, and holdest Thy peace; long-suffering, and plenteous in mercy and  truth. Wilt Thou hold Thy peace for ever? and even now Thou drawest out  of this horrible gulf the soul that seeketh Thee, that thirsteth for  Thy pleasures, whose heart saith unto Thee, I have sought Thy face; Thy  face, Lord, will I seek. For darkened affections is removal from Thee.  For it is not by our feet, or change of place, that men leave Thee, or  return unto Thee. Or did that Thy younger son look out for horses or  chariots, or ships, fly with visible wings, or journey by the motion of  his limbs, that he might in a far country waste in riotous living all  Thou gavest at his departure? a loving Father, when Thou gavest, and  more loving unto him, when he returned empty. So then in lustful, that  is, in darkened affections, is the true distance from Thy face.    Behold, O Lord God, yea, behold patiently as Thou art wont how carefully  the sons of men observe the covenanted rules of letters and syllables  received from those who spake before them, neglecting the eternal  covenant of everlasting salvation received from Thee. Insomuch, that  a teacher or learner of the hereditary laws of pronunciation will more  offend men by speaking without the aspirate, of a \"uman being,\" in  despite of the laws of grammar, than if he, a \"human being,\" hate a  \"human being\" in despite of Thine. As if any enemy could be more hurtful  than the hatred with which he is incensed against him; or could wound  more deeply him whom he persecutes, than he wounds his own soul by his  enmity. Assuredly no science of letters can be so innate as the record  of conscience, \"that he is doing to another what from another he would  be loth to suffer.\" How deep are Thy ways, O God, Thou only great,  that sittest silent on high and by an unwearied law dispensing penal  blindness to lawless desires. In quest of the fame of eloquence, a man  standing before a human judge, surrounded by a human throng, declaiming  against his enemy with fiercest hatred, will take heed most watchfully,  lest, by an error of the tongue, he murder the word \"human being\"; but  takes no heed, lest, through the fury of his spirit, he murder the real  human being.    This was the world at whose gate unhappy I lay in my boyhood; this  the stage where I had feared more to commit a barbarism, than having  committed one, to envy those who had not. These things I speak and  confess to Thee, my God; for which I had praise from them, whom I then  thought it all virtue to please. For I saw not the abyss of vileness,  wherein I was cast away from Thine eyes. Before them what more foul than  I was already, displeasing even such as myself? with innumerable lies  deceiving my tutor, my masters, my parents, from love of play, eagerness  to see vain shows and restlessness to imitate them! Thefts also I  committed, from my parents' cellar and table, enslaved by greediness, or  that I might have to give to boys, who sold me their play, which all  the while they liked no less than I. In this play, too, I often  sought unfair conquests, conquered myself meanwhile by vain desire of  preeminence. And what could I so ill endure, or, when I detected it,  upbraided I so fiercely, as that I was doing to others? and for which  if, detected, I was upbraided, I chose rather to quarrel than to yield.  And is this the innocence of boyhood? Not so, Lord, not so; I cry Thy  mercy, my God. For these very sins, as riper years succeed, these very  sins are transferred from tutors and masters, from nuts and balls and  sparrows, to magistrates and kings, to gold and manors and slaves, just  as severer punishments displace the cane. It was the low stature then of  childhood which Thou our King didst commend as an emblem of lowliness,  when Thou saidst, Of such is the kingdom of heaven.    Yet, Lord, to Thee, the Creator and Governor of the universe, most  excellent and most good, thanks were due to Thee our God, even hadst  Thou destined for me boyhood only. For even then I was, I lived, and  felt; and had an implanted providence over my well-being--a trace of  that mysterious Unity whence I was derived; I guarded by the inward  sense the entireness of my senses, and in these minute pursuits, and in  my thoughts on things minute, I learnt to delight in truth, I hated to  be deceived, had a vigorous memory, was gifted with speech, was  soothed by friendship, avoided pain, baseness, ignorance. In so small a  creature, what was not wonderful, not admirable? But all are gifts of  my God: it was not I who gave them me; and good these are, and these  together are myself. Good, then, is He that made me, and He is my good;  and before Him will I exult for every good which of a boy I had. For it  was my sin, that not in Him, but in His creatures-myself and others--I  sought for pleasures, sublimities, truths, and so fell headlong into  sorrows, confusions, errors. Thanks be to Thee, my joy and my glory  and my confidence, my God, thanks be to Thee for Thy gifts; but do Thou  preserve them to me. For so wilt Thou preserve me, and those things  shall be enlarged and perfected which Thou hast given me, and I myself  shall be with Thee, since even to be Thou hast given me.          BOOK II      I will now call to mind my past foulness, and the carnal corruptions of  my soul; not because I love them, but that I may love Thee, O my God.  For love of Thy love I do it; reviewing my most wicked ways in the very  bitterness of my remembrance, that Thou mayest grow sweet unto me (Thou  sweetness never failing, Thou blissful and assured sweetness); and  gathering me again out of that my dissipation, wherein I was torn  piecemeal, while turned from Thee, the One Good, I lost myself among a  multiplicity of things. For I even burnt in my youth heretofore, to be  satiated in things below; and I dared to grow wild again, with these  various and shadowy loves: my beauty consumed away, and I stank in Thine  eyes; pleasing myself, and desirous to please in the eyes of men.    And what was it that I delighted in, but to love, and be loved? but  I kept not the measure of love, of mind to mind, friendship's bright  boundary: but out of the muddy concupiscence of the flesh, and the  bubblings of youth, mists fumed up which beclouded and overcast my  heart, that I could not discern the clear brightness of love from the  fog of lustfulness. Both did confusedly boil in me, and hurried my  unstayed youth over the precipice of unholy desires, and sunk me in a  gulf of flagitiousnesses. Thy wrath had gathered over me, and I knew it  not. I was grown deaf by the clanking of the chain of my mortality, the  punishment of the pride of my soul, and I strayed further from"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32962"],[0,"A Handbook of Laboratory Glass-Blowing (#4)"],[1,"with a deposit  of soot, as explained on page 16. The flat ends shown in _a_, Fig. 8,  are made by squeezing the soft glass rod between two pieces of carbon,  and should be re-heated to dull redness after shaping. Fig. 8 also shows  various forms of stirrer.    In order to carry out stirring operations in the presence of a gas or  mixture of gases other than air, some form of gland or seal may be  necessary where the stirrer passes through the bearing in which it runs.  A flask to which is fitted a stirrer and gas seal is shown in section by  _b_, Fig. 8. The liquid used in this seal may be mercury, petroleum, or  any other that the experimental conditions indicate.    [Illustration: Fig. 8]    If the bearing for a stirrer is made of glass tube, it is desirable to  lubricate rather freely; otherwise heat will be produced by the  friction of the stirrer and the tube will probably crack. Such  lubrication may be supplied by turning out the top of the bearing tube  and filling the turned-out portion with petroleum jelly mixed with a  small quantity of finely ground or, better, colloidal graphite, and the  bearing should also be lubricated with the same composition. Care  should be taken not to employ so soft a lubricant or so large an excess  as to cause it to run down the stirrer into the liquid which is being  stirred.    _Leading a Crack._--It sometimes happens that a large bulb or specially  thin-walled tube has to be divided. In such a case it is scarcely  practicable to use the method recommended for small tubes on page 12,  but it is quite easy to lead a crack in any desired direction. A  convenient starting point is a file cut; this is touched with hot glass  until a crack is initiated. A small flame or a bead of hot glass is now  used to heat the article at a point about a quarter of an inch from the  end of the crack and in whatever direction it has to be led. The crack  will now extend towards the source of heat, which should be moved  farther away as the crack advances. In this manner a crack may be caused  to take any desired path and can be led round a large bulb.    _Cutting Glass with the Diamond._--Slips of window-glass can be used in  place of glass rod for some purposes, and as cutting them involves the  use of the glaziers' diamond or a wheel-cutter, they may well be  mentioned under this heading.    In cutting a sheet of glass with the diamond, one needs a flat surface  on which to rest the glass, and a rule against which to guide the  diamond. The diamond should be held in an almost vertical position, and  drawn over the surface of the glass with slight pressure. While this is  being done the angle of the diamond should be changed by bringing the  top of the handle forward until the sound changes from one of scratching  to a clear singing note. When this happens the diamond is cutting. A few  trials will teach the student the correct angle for the diamond with  which he works, and the glass, if properly cut, will break easily. If  the cut fails it is better to turn the glass over and make a  corresponding cut on the other side rather than make any attempt to  improve the original cut. The diamond is seldom used for cutting small  glass tubes.    The use of the wheel-cutter calls for no special mention as it will cut  at any angle, although the pressure required is somewhat greater than  that needed by most diamonds.

The two principal methods of making such seals will be considered  first and their special application afterwards.    _An Air Trap on a Barometer Tube._--This involves the use of the first  method, and is perhaps the simplest example that can be given. Fig. 9,  _a_, _a1_ and _a2_, show the stages by which this form of internal seal  is made. For the first trials, it is well to work with fairly  thick-walled tubing, which should be cut into two pieces, each being  about eight inches long.    [Illustration: Fig. 9]    First seal the end of one tube as described on page 13, heat the sealed  end and expand to a thick walled bulb. Fuse the end of the other tube,  attach a piece of glass rod to serve as a handle, and draw out; cut off  the drawn-out portion: leaving an end like _a_.    Now heat a small spot at the end of the bulb, blow, burst out, and  remove the thin fragments of glass. Heat a zone on the other tube at the  point where the drawn-out portion commences and expand as shown by _a1_.    The next stage is to join the tubes. Heat the ragged edges of the  burst-out portion until they are thoroughly rounded. At the same time  heat the drawn-out tube to just below softening point. Then, while the  rounded edges of the burst-out portion are still soft, insert the other  tube; rotate the join in the blowpipe flame until it is quite soft, and  expand by blowing. If necessary, re-heat and expand again. The finished  seal, which should be slightly annealed by smoking in a sooty flame, is  shown by _a2_.    _A Spray Arrester._--This is made by the second method, in which the  piece of tube which projects inside the bulb is fused in position first  and the outer tube is then joined on. The various stages of making are  illustrated by _b_, _b1_ and _b2_, Fig. 9.    A bulb is blown between two tubes by the method given on page 22, the  larger tube is then cut off and the small piece of tube introduced into  the bulb after having been shaped as shown in by _b_, Fig. 9. The  opening in the bulb is sealed as shown by _b1_. The sealed part is now  heated and the bulb inclined downwards until the inner tube comes in  contact with the seal and is fused in position. This operation requires  some practice in order to prevent the inner tube either falling through  the soft glass or becoming unsymmetrical. The end of the bulb, where the  inner tube comes in contact with it, is now perforated by heating and  blowing, thus giving the form shown by _b2_, and the outer tube is  joined on. The finished spray arrester is shown by _b3_. Practice alone  will give the power to produce a symmetrical and stable piece of work.    _Two Forms of Filter Pump._--That illustrated by _d_, Fig. 9, is made by  the method explained under \"An Air Trap on a Barometer Tube.\" That  illustrated by _c_ is made by the method explained under \"A Spray  Arrester.\" No new manipulation is involved, and the construction should  be clear from a study of the drawings.    _Multiple and Branched Internal Seals._--A fuller consideration of these  will be found on page 39, but one general principle may well be borne in  mind; that, as far as is possible, a tube having both ends fastened  inside another tube or bulb should be curved or have a spiral or bulb at  some point in its length, otherwise any expansion or contraction will  put great strain on the joints.    _Sprays._--A spray which is easy to make, easy to adjust, and easy to  clean after use is shown by _e_, Fig. 9. The opening on the top of the  bulb is made by melting on a bead of glass, expanding, bursting, and  fusing the ragged edges. The two branches which form the spray producing  junction are made by the method used for an exhaustion branch and  described on page 18.    A spray which can be introduced through the neck of a bottle is shown by  _h_, Fig. 9. The various stages in making this are illustrated by _f_,  and _g_. If the inner tube is made by drawing out from a larger piece of  glass so that two supporting pieces are left on each side of the place  where it is intended to make the final bend, that bend can be made in a  flat-flame gas burner without causing the inner tube to come in contact  with the walls of the outer tube. Care must be taken when joining on the  side piece that the inner tube is not heated enough to fuse it. The  small hole in the side of the outer tube is produced by heating and  bursting.    _A Liebig's Condenser._--This consists of a straight glass tube passing  through an outer cooling jacket. In practice it is better to make the  jacket as a separate piece, and to effect a water-tight junction by  means of two short rubber tubes. It may, however, be made with two  internal seals of the class described under \"A Spray Arrester.\" There is  much less risk of these seals cracking if the inner tube is made in the  form of a spiral or has a number of bulbs blown on it in order to give a  certain amount of elasticity.    _A Double-Surface Condenser._--Fig. 10 shows a condenser of this nature  which is supplied by Messrs. Baird and Tatlock. It may be built up in  stages as shown by _a_, _b_, and _c_, but the work involved requires  considerable skill, and the majority of laboratory workers will find it  cheaper to buy than to make.    [Illustration: Fig. 10]    _A Spherical Condenser._--Such a condenser as that shown by _f_, Fig 10,  involves a method which may find application in a number of cases. The  outer bulb is blown from a thick piece of tubing which has been inserted  in a smaller piece (see _d_, Fig. 6); then the inner bulb by similar  method. It is now necessary to introduce the smaller bulb into the  larger, and for this purpose the larger bulb must be cut into halves. A  small but deep cut is made with the file or glass-blowers' knife in the  middle of the larger bulb, and at right angles to the axis of the tube  on which it is blown. A minute bead of intensely heated glass is now  brought in contact with the cut in"]]]
