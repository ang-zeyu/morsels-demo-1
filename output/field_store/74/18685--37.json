[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37512"],[0,"A Revision of Snakes of the Genus Conophis (Family Colubridae, from Middle (#4)"],[1,"are absent on all specimens having no dorsal stripes and  on some specimens having dorsal stripes. Except for the dark lateral  spots (when present) the ventrals are immaculate white. Usually the  dorsal ground-color is pale tan, especially on the striped forms. The  ground-color is usually palest on the lower dorsal scale rows and  darkest dorsally.    Three populations are separable as subspecies; one has no stripes on  the body and occurs in the Yucatan Peninsula. The other two have  stripes on the dorsum and vary clinally in coloration from the north  (Veracruz, Mexico) to south (Costa Rica) (Fig. 2). Reasons for  separating these widespread, variable snakes into two subspecies are  that they are discontinuous in distribution (the population in  Veracruz is disjunct from the one that extends from Guatemala to Costa  Rica), and that these populations have distinctly different color  patterns.

There are also three  paratypes; one a topotype (USNM 79964), one from \"Nicaragua\" (USNM  25237), and one from Esparta, Costa Rica (USNM 37758).    _Diagnosis._--Lateral dark stripe anteriorly passing through eye and  posteriorly involving 3rd and 4th scale-rows; 1st scale-row darkly  pigmented; no paravertebral dark stripe, although vertebral row  sometimes darkly pigmented; six to thirteen stripes at mid-body; eight  supralabials immaculate or having dark ventral margins.    _Variation._--Thirty-six specimens have 159 to 178 (167.2 +- 4.56)  ventrals. Thirty of these snakes having complete tails have 60 to 80  (70.5 +- 5.36) subcaudals; the number of ventrals plus subcaudals  varies from 224 to 247 (237.6). In 36 specimens the reduction from 19  to 17 dorsal scales takes place between ventrals 91 and 111 (102.1 +-  4.59). Sexual dimorphism is evident in the number of subcaudals; 16  females have 60 to 72 (67.1), and 14 males have 67 to 80 (74.5)  subcaudals. The largest specimen (ERA-WTN BH-300) is a female from  Augustine, British Honduras, having a body length of 732 mm., a tail  length of 183 mm. and a total length of 915 mm. A juvenile (MCZ 49794)  from Tegucigalpa, Honduras, has a body length of 162 mm., a tail  length of 51 mm. and a total length of 213 mm.    The greatest variation is in coloration. The ground-color is pale  brown or white with dark stripes of black or deep brown present  dorsally and laterally. Some specimens from Costa Rica have as many as  13 dark stripes at mid-body (fig. 1, C). In these snakes the first  row of dorsal scales bears a series of large, slightly elongated, dark  spots; on the 2nd row a narrow dark brown stripe on the middle of the  scales; on the 3rd a black stripe on the dorsal one-third to one-half  of the scales; on the 4th and the 7th rows black stripes on the medial  half of the scales of each row; on the 8th and 10th (vertebral) rows  dark brown stripes on the medial third of the scales of each row. A  specimen from Guatemala (UMMZ 107339) shows the greatest reduction of  stripes and dark pigmentation (fig. 1, A); it has only eight stripes  at mid-body: on the first row of dorsal scales a discontinuous stripe  is formed by a series of dashes; the 3rd row bears a series of small  black spots near the base and tip of each scale; the 4th and 7th rows  bear continuous black stripes on the medial third to fourth of the  scales of each row; the 8th row has extremely small dark spots near  the tips of some scales.    The primary stripes, characteristic of the species _lineatus_, are  those on the 1st, 4th and 7th rows of dorsal scales; these are the  most prominent stripes. In some specimens these primary stripes begin  as spots or dashes on the nape and become continuous stripes  posteriorly; in others they are continuous for the length of the body.  The stripe on the 1st row is most variable; usually it consists of  only a discontinuous series of dashes for most of its length. The  secondary stripes are those on the 3rd and 8th rows; of these, only  the one on the 3rd scale-row is present on the nape. The stripe on the  3rd row in combination with the dark stripe on the 4th row is the  posterior continuation of the dark stripe that on the head passes  through the eye; this stripe is characteristic of _C. lineatus dunni_.  Both secondary stripes usually begin anteriorly as a series of spots  or dashes and become continuous stripes posteriorly; occasionally near  the base of the tail they fuse with the primary stripes on the 4th and  7th rows. In some specimens in Costa Rica indistinct stripes are  present on the 10th (posteriorly the 9th) rows, and in some specimens  in Honduras, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica similar indistinct stripes are  present on the 2nd row.    Usually there are more or less conspicuous dark spots laterally on the  ventrals, but in some specimens there are no spots. Except for the  dark lateral spots (when present) the ventrals are immaculate white.  The dorsal ground-color is a pale brown or brownish white in preserved  specimens on the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th rows of scales where dark  stripes or spots are not present. The ground-color of the dorsum  between the 5th rows on each side is a somewhat darker shade of pale  to medium brown.    Never is more than the lower one-third of each of the supralabials  brown. In many specimens little or no brown is present on the lower  margins of these scales. Some of the specimens having brown on the  supralabials also have dusky markings of tan or gray on the chin and  infralabials. Specimens from the northern part of the range  (Guatemala) less frequently have dark chins and supralabials than do  specimens from the southern part of the range (Costa Rica). There is,  nevertheless, at any one locality considerable variation in the amount  of dark pigmentation present on the chin and supralabials, thereby  indicating that the slight geographic trend in this character is not  significant.    Probably the most common pattern of dorsal coloration consists of  eight or ten dark stripes (fig. 1, B). In snakes having this pattern  the stripes on the 1st, 3rd, 4th and 7th rows are always present and  prominent, although those on the 1st and 3rd rows sometimes are  present as discontinuous rows of dashes. The ground-color from the  venter to the 7th row is usually pale brown, and that dorsally between  the 7th rows on each side is usually a darker, medium brown. A series  of spots or dashes or a continuous stripe is sometimes present on the  8th row of scales.    Snakes having a larger number of dark stripes and more dark  pigmentation occur in the southern part of the range. There seems to  be a cline from paler snakes having fewer stripes in the north to  darker snakes in the south.       [Illustration: FIG. 3. Patterns of dorsal coloration at        mid-body of juveniles of two sympatric species of _Conophis_.        A. _C. lineatus dunni_ (MCZ 49794) from Tegucigalpa, Honduras.        B. _C. pulcher_ (MCZ 49791) from Tegucigalpa, Honduras.        Approximately x 1.]    In juveniles, there are six or eight black stripes boldly contrasting  with a white or pale tan ground-color (fig. 3, A). The first pair of  stripes is on the 1st scale-row; the second pair, on the 3rd and 4th  scale-rows; the third pair, on the 7th row; the fourth pair (when  present), on the 8th row. Ontogenetic change in coloration consists of  the splitting of the second pair of dark stripes in the juvenile.  Additional stripes may form later on the 2nd and/or 10th rows of  dorsal scales."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37530"],[0,"The Story of an Ostrich: An Allegory and Humorous Satire in Rhyme. (#4)"],[1,"will be made only so far as the  religious idea proclaimed in Judea shall be allowed to influence the  pride and passions of men.      _XIII._    The waiting knight, emblem of the new manhood just entering upon its  estate of resolution and responsibility, is the type of a generation now  setting forth in quest of high and honorable adventure. Satan is at his  back, thrusting forward a bag of gold and counselling the pursuit of  wealth; \"Put money in thy purse!\" saith the devil; \"all else counts but  little,--put money in thy purse!\" At his left hand stands the priest in  his splendid robes of office, proffering the symbol of suffering and  self-renunciation. The knight sees the frozen church with ascetic and  veiled superstition as its hand-maidens; the star of Bethlehem still  shines out of the dark upon a mighty hand reaching out of the clouds to  shake to its foundations the edifice of Christ, emblazoned with the  letter and the creed, but supported by the pomp and pride of a purely  material world. \"The zeal of his house hath eaten him up,\" and in the  majestic temple sits the money changer, absorbed in his trade and his  material enterprises. Before him kneels the imploring angel of Freedom,  raising the flag of the great republic, with all its portents and  promises, symbolically arrayed in its stripes and stars. Uncle Sam is  but a puzzled and quizzical spectator of future events.      _XIV._    The battle between the head and the feet results, at last, in the fall  of Satan, that is, Self, under the God-principle of self-renunciation,  working in all human creeds and canticles, foreshadowing the unity of  the race in the power of the religious idea that has, at last, become  dominant in the head. The cross, no longer an emblem of suffering but of  power, unites with the crown in a final union of church and state. Here  behold the wedded bliss of the long divorced pair, presaging a new and  glorified race of man. Then, indeed, the baptismal story of man's hoary  and ancient glory in Eden shall usher in that gracious day, when the  lamb and the lion shall gambol together, and there shall be in all the  earth neither murder, nor theft, nor plunder, nor war.      [Illustration]        Thereafter, the ostrich, with feet and head sore,      Resolved he would not peck his feet any more;      He's learned by experience, virtue superior      Lies, often, concealed under coarsest exterior;      That modest and unostentatious assumption,      Betimes, will outweigh overweening presumption;      That the feet of an ostrich, no less than his head,--      Though that be, perchance, more or less better bred      And adapted by nature to study astronomy,--      Are important two members of ostrich economy,      With which no wise bird, be his head ere so comely,      Should quarrel, because they are dirty and homely.        Having reached this conclusion, our ostrich became      A modified ostrich in all but the name;      From old misconceptions of merest mendacity,      He grew to be kindly and lost his loquacity,      More humble in spirit, imbued with true charity,--      Which, under the sun, is the thing of most rarity.    [Illustration]        Lest any imagine this measure devoid      Of meaning they'd quicker detect unalloyed,      It is meet to observe that 'twas writ with design,      Well knowing wise men its intent will divine.        By the ostrich is meant mankind, great and small,      Weak and strong, rich and poor, thin and fat, short and tall,      Let loose for awhile, in earth's paddock confined,      An attempt of the gods to rear more of their kind;      I infer the experiment still is in doubt,      For very few gods have, as yet, been hatched out.        But some men, there are, with great purposes fraught,      Who have pushed back afar the world's frontier of thought;      And others, whose deeds, speaking louder than words,      Show how much of God human nature affords,      Foretelling of Heaven,--e'en giving a glimpse      Of seraphim, cherubim, angels and nymphs,--      Till the heart of humanity, lifted up, sings      In tune with the Infinite nature of things.        The End.        Transcriber's note:    \"wifh ail its portents and promises\" has been corrected to \"with all its portents and    promises\"."]]]
