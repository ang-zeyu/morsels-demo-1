I fully believe that good  information will, by satisfying this curiosity, free the mind to a great  extent from sexual thoughts. It is from such very thoughts that boys are  led to play with their sexual organs in secret, and to handle them so as  to excite pleasurable sensations; erections of the penis are thus  produced and finally, by this continual excitation with the hand, the  height of sexual orgasm is reached, ejaculation of semen occurs and  _self-pollution_ is the consequence. This act is called \"masturbation\"  and becomes a _secret vice of the worst kind_!    Very frequently and to an alarming extent \"masturbation\" is taught by  older boys, and by young men even, in nearly all our colleges, boarding,  public and private schools, and by companions under the paternal roof.  This act is repeated time after time until the degrading and destructive  (morally and physically so) habit is confirmed. As a result, the boy  grows thin, pale, morose and passionate; then weak, indolent and  indifferent; his digestion becomes impaired, his sleep short, disturbed  and broken; he sometimes becomes epileptic or falls into a state of  marasmus; in any case he is in great danger of being totally ruined  forever.    There is a great difference in boys regarding the formation of these  habits. While some may almost insensibly glide into them, others,  intuitively as it were, turn away from all such temptations and banish  all thoughts of a sexual nature from their minds at once. This is right.  So long as a boy's mind refuses to harbor such baleful approaches, so  long he is safe; but the moment he heeds them and allows them to enter  his mind, that moment he is in danger and will most likely fall into bad  habits. He must strenuously resist all such thoughts and going to his  father or mother tell them about his trials and temptations and strive  to forget them until success crowns his efforts. By persistent efforts,  by repeated prayers to the Lord for help, by reading his Bible and good,  pure stories, by running into the open air and indulging in some useful  occupation or joyous, healthful play, he will eventually conquer them  and thus rise to the dignity of a true man. Sometimes, too, it may be  necessary to consult the physician for help. In addition to the  instinctive shrinking which every right minded person generally feels  from putting ideas of impurity into a child's innocent mind, a parent's  pride leads him to hope that _his_ boy would not indulge in any such  mean and disgusting practices. But, bearing in mind the advice of  Herbert Spencer--\"that the aim of discipline should be to produce a  _self-governing_ being,\" the best advice a parent or guardian can, and  ought, to give, is: do not harbor bad thoughts or feelings about  anything; at once turn them away and think of something else, of  something good, true and pure. Indulge in no hatred or revengeful  feelings towards others; plot no evil things; always be true to your  word, faithful to your duties and charitable to all. Treat everybody  kindly and politely. And further, a child should be _taught_ what  \"chastity\" really is, instead of leaving him to find it out as best he  may.    It should be clearly explained to him that true chastity requires the  shunning of all indecency and foul language; that he should refrain from  touching his secret parts except when the necessities of nature require  it; that all sexual emotions should be subjugated. When he grows older  every boy should be taught that chastity means continence; and it should  be firmly impressed upon his mind that all lascivious actions are a  drain upon his whole system and weaken the powers which the Lord has  given him to be employed _only_ in the married state. These are  characteristics of a true man and will help him very much to keep out of  sexual difficulties which, as we shall see further on, are among the  greatest curses of life.    The use of tobacco, wine, coffee or tea by children is well known to be  highly injurious. Never allow a child to use either of these--not even  in small quantities. A too common practice in many families is to allow  a little wine at dinner \"to assist digestion!\" Others allow coffee or  tea, \"because my child is so fond of it.\" \"The after-effects of all  these is to disturb the heart, to cause nervousness and irritability,  and _to weaken the sexual organs in a marked degree_. Tobacco  particularly has this last effect in old and young, besides producing  convulsions, a dulled intellect, etc.\"[D]      [D] Lallemand and Wilson.    Remember where the brain is and the purposes for which it has been  given! Here reside the knowledge and the power to govern all below it.  No matter what the stomach craves or how strongly the appetite begs for  this or that; no matter how much one may be tempted to steal, to lie or  to swear; no matter how much the sexual organs may lead one to think  about or handle them--here is the great and good brain, the home of the  will-power, which says: \"Touch not, taste not, handle not.\" So long as  these commands are listened to and obeyed, one is safe. The desire need  not and should not control the act--but the rational faculty can and  will control, when early taught to do so. The more one is led by this  rational faculty the easier it becomes to follow it, and _vice versa_.    What has been said above regarding the danger of little boys falling  into bad habits applies with equal force to little girls. Do not forget  this. They too may have sexual thoughts, feelings and curiosity, and  care must be taken to keep their minds pure and bodies healthy. They are  also liable to disorders that require prompt and careful attention, such  as inflammations, excoriations, itchings and swellings of the genital  organs with discharges from these parts resembling leucorrhoea. All such  conditions lead them to more or less rub and scratch these parts--which  should never be touched--for relief. Pleasurable sensations are  experienced and then comes masturbation--_a sin chargeable to the  parent_ for not having given the matter proper medical attention.  \"Repeated washings\" will no more cure these cases in little girls than,  as shown above, will they cure in little boys. All these are but the  outcropping of some constitutional affection and should be treated  accordingly. No applications or medicated washings of any kind should be  allowed. Such external treatment only palliates the suffering for a  little while without removing the disordered vital force that gave  origin to its appearance. This is simply repressed and may react upon  the child and appear in another form tenfold worse than the first. The  passing of urine or fecal matter may (in either sex) cause irritation  and excoriation; this is another sign that all is not right in the vital  forces and should be mentioned to the physician as a sure index that  medical treatment, but not topical applications, is absolutely  necessary. All abnormal appearances, actions and discomforts of the  child, whether mental or physical, should be submitted to an experienced  and judicious physician. A healthy child should be happy and comfortable  in all respects.    A very successful plan for keeping children from vice or vicious habits  is to see that their time is fully occupied with amusements and duties  which interest them. They need a great deal of harmlessly conducted  amusement and--do _not_ strive to \"keep them quiet.\" Allow little boys  and girls to play together, under proper surveillance, and let them be  boisterous if they will; let them romp and run, climb fences, trundle  hoops, jump rope, go to dancing school, participate in military drills,  go coasting and skating, take swimming lessons, etc.    No judicious parents will allow a son or daughter to be alone much; to  seek to be alone is always a bad sign and should be carefully guarded  against without its being known that such precaution is observed.  Furnish them liberally with instructive and innocent story books and let  them read aloud to you or to each other. Take them to walk or ride when  you go, and strive to make companions of them as much as possible,  making whatever sacrifices are necessary to attain this end. Above all,  _encourage their making confidants of you_. Let them feel that they can  come and talk freely on any subject, no matter what its nature may be.  Do this, and you have thrown around them a bulwark of defence that will  withstand the repeated attacks of hosts of evil spirits. When night  comes and they go to bed, let them learn to go to sleep at once; no play  then--they may be read to sleep, but no romping or playing. No strange  children should be allowed to sleep with yours; make them occupy  separate rooms or at least separate beds; be sure that the sleeping  places of your children are sacred to them alone. Nor is it advisable  for children to sleep with a grown person of either sex and particularly  not with servants--all for obvious reasons.    The observance of all these precautions against influences that might  excite sexual disturbance is most sacred in its character and most  needful even in a religious point of view; for there should be  _chastity_ above all things.          CHAPTER IV.    ADOLESCENCE OF THE MALE.      Adolescence of the male embraces the period of life from the age of  fourteen or sixteen years to the age of twenty-five.    At about the age of fourteen years \"the period of youth is distinguished  by that advance in the evolution of the generative apparatus in both  sexes, and by that acquirement of its power of functional activity,  which constitutes the state of _Puberty_.\" At this age the following  great changes "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31686"],[0,"Collector's Item (#4)"],[1,"it. Rivulets of thick, muddy liquid welled out of the  ground and drabbled their feet. The women turned pale. Algol gave a  faint cry and hid under Mrs. Bernardi's skirts, trembling, while the  mosquito-bat tried to lift Mortland's toupee and hide in his hair. The  ship itself quivered and seemed to jump slightly in the air, then  returned to its resting place.    All was quiet again, quieter than it had been before. Mortland anxiously  gnawed his light mustache. \"Better hurry with that tea, there's a good  fellow. I'm violently allergic to loud noises.\"    \"They'll probably continue all day,\" the professor said with almost  malevolent cheerfulness, \"so you might as well get used to them.\" _Who  is he to have nerves? I am easily the most sensitive person here, but I  manage to control myself._    \"I don't know how I'm going to stand it!\" Mrs. Bernardi shrieked. \"I  just know something terrible is going to happen.\"    \"Please try to restrain yourself, Louisa,\" her husband ordered. \"After  it's over, you'll find we'll be much more comfortable and secure with  the ship resting on rock.\"    \"If you ask me, that blast made it sink a little,\" Mortland said. \"I  wonder whether--\"    He was interrupted by a thrashing in the bushes. Dfar-Lll burst forth,  shedding scales. _Do not despair, Jrann-Pttt. I am here, ready to save  you or die at your side._    The women clutched each other, Miss Anspacher praying silently and  fervently to Juno, Lakshmi, Freya, Isis and a host of other esoteric  female deities she had picked up in the course of her avocational  researches.    \"He seems to be one of Jrann-Pttt's people,\" Bernardi observed, \"so  there should be nothing to fear.\"    _Dfar-Lll, you fool!_ Jrann-Pttt ideated angrily. _Nothing's wrong.  They're just blasting out a better berth for their vessel. And now  you've spoiled my plans._    \"What did you think at that poor little creature!\" Mrs. Bernardi blazed.  \"He's crying!\" And, sure enough, amethyst tears were oozing out of the  young saurian's large, liquid eyes.    _I du-didn't mean any harm._    \"Monster!\" Mrs. Bernardi accused Jrann-Pttt. \"All men are monsters,  whether they're aliens or not.\"    \"You're so right, Louisa!\" Miss Anspacher exclaimed, regarding the  younger creature in an almost kindly manner.    _I'm sorry, r-Lll_, Jrann-Pttt apologized. _I was upset by that noise,  too. How could you possibly know what it was? Come, let me introduce you  to the creatures._    Dfar-Lll stepped forward diffidently. Jrann-Pttt put a hand on the  moss-green shoulder. \"Allow me to introduce my companion, Dfar-Lll,\" he  said aloud.    The youngster looked at him.    Mrs. Bernardi thrust out her hand. \"I'm very glad to meet you, Lil.\"    _Agitate it with one of yours. It's a courtesy. Don't let her see how  repulsive she is to you. Remember, you're just as repulsive to her._    Dfar-Lll offered a shy, seven-fingered hand. \"Pleased ... to meet  you ... ma'am,\" the young lizard squeaked.    \"Why, he's just a baby, isn't he?\" Mrs. Bernardi asked.    _I am not a baby!_ Dfar-Lll thought indignantly. _At the end of this  year, I shall celebrate my pre-maturity feast, or I would have. And  furthermore--_    There was another thunderous blast of sound. After the ground had  stopped trembling, the six found themselves ankle-deep in muddy water.  Algol, who was in considerably deeper than his ankles, mewed fretfully.  Mrs. Bernardi picked him up and comforted him.    \"Perhaps blasting wasn't such a good idea,\" the professor muttered.  \"Maybe I should tell Greenfield to call a halt and we'll take our  chances with the storm. As a matter of fa--\"    \"The ship!\" Mortland cried. \"It _is_ sinking!\"    And the big metal ball slowly but visibly was indeed subsiding into the  mud.    \"Stop it, somebody!\" Miss Anspacher snapped in her customary schoolroom  manner.    The professor was pale, but he held on to his calm. \"What can we do?  Even if we could get the captain back in time, there's no way we can  stop it. It's too heavy to pull out manually, and the engines, of  course, are inside.\"    As they watched in horror, the ship sank deeper and deeper, picking up  momentum as more of it went under. With a loud, sucking sound, it  vanished into the ooze. Muddy water gurgled over it and, where the ship  had been, there was now a small lake.    \"This could be the beginning of a legend,\" Miss Anspacher murmured. \"Or  the end.\"    There was another vibrant detonation. \"Someone ought to go tell the  captain there's no use blasting any more,\" Bernardi said wearily. \"We  have nothing to put on the rock when he smooths it off.\" He began to  laugh. \"I suppose you could call this poetic justice.\" And he went on  laughing, losing a bit of his former self-control.    _There goes Plan B_, Jrann-Pttt thought.    A star of intensely bright green lightning split the clouds and widened  to cover the visible expanse of sky. There was a planet-shaking clap of  thunder that made Greenfield's puny efforts sound like the snapping of  twigs in comparison and it began to rain hard and fast.           *       *       *       *       *    \"If only I hadn't gone and blasted that damn rock,\" the captain  grumbled, squeezing water out of his shirt-tails, \"we'd have been all  right. Probably the storm wouldn't have done a thing to the ship except  get it wet. If you can even call it a storm.\"    \"I can and I do,\" Jrann-Pttt replied, haughtily squeegeeing his wet  scales. \"All I said was that a storm might be coming up and it might be  dangerous. How was I to know it would last only half an hour?\"    \"Even the camp stools pulled through,\" Greenfield pointed out, \"and you  said shelters wouldn't stand up.\"    \"I only said they might not. Can't you understand your own language?\"    The fissure in the clouds had not quite closed yet and through it the  enormous, blazing disk of the sun glared at them, twice as large as it  appeared from Earth. It was a moot point as to whether they'd be dried  out or steamed alive first.    \"Might as well collect whatever gear we have left and get it to higher  ground,\" Miss Anspacher said efficiently. \"Two feet of water won't do  anything any good--even those camp stools.\"    \"It's my belief you wanted this to happen,\" Greenfield accused  Jrann-Pttt. \"You wanted to get rid of us.\"    \"My dear fellow,\" Jrann-Pttt replied loftily, \"the information I gave  you was, to the best of my knowledge, accurate. However, I happen to be  a professor of zoology and not a meteorologist. Apparently you people  live out in the open like primitives,\" he continued, ignoring Dfar-Lll's  admiring interjection, \"and are accustomed to the vicissitudes of  weather. I am a civilized creature; I live--\" _or used to live_--\"in an  air-conditioned, light-conditioned, weather-conditioned city. It is only  when I rough it on field trips like this to trackless parts of  the--globe that I am forced to experience weather. Even then, I have  never before been caught in a situation like this.\"    _In fact, I was never before caught or I wouldn't be in this situation  at all._    \"Oh, Jrann-Pttt,\" sighed Miss Anspacher, \"I knew you couldn't be just an  ordinary native!\"    \"How did you get into this situation then?\" Professor Bernardi asked. He  had an unfortunate talent for going directly to the point.    \"The third member of our expedition died,\" Jrann-Pttt explained. \"He was  our dirigational expert. Our guide.\"    \"How did he happen to--\"    \"Are we just going to stand here chatting,\" Miss Anspacher demanded, \"or  are we going to do something about this?\"    \"What can we do?\" Mrs. Bernardi asked weakly. \"We might just as well lie  down and--\"    \"Never say die, Louisa,\" Miss Anspacher admonished.    \"I suggest we go to my camp to see what shape it's in,\" Jrann-Pttt said,  furiously putting together Plan C. \"Some of the supplies there might  prove useful.\"    Captain Greenfield looked questioningly at Bernardi. The professor  shrugged. \"Might as well.\"    \"All right,\" the captain growled. \"Let's pick up whatever we can save.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Since there wasn't much that could be rescued, the little safari was  soon on its way. Jrann-Pttt led, carrying Algol in his arms. Behind came  Mortland, bearing a camp stool and the kettle into which he had tucked a  tin of biscuits and into which the mosquito-bat had tucked itself, its  orange eyes glaring out angrily from beneath the lid. Next came Mrs.  Bernardi with her knitting, her camp stool and her sorrow.    Dfar-Lll followed with two stools and the plastic tea set. Close behind  was Miss Anspacher, with the sugar bowl, the earthenware teapot and an  immense bound volume of the _Proceedings of the Physical Society of  Ameranglis_ for 1993. Professor Bernardi bore a briefcase full of notes  and the table. The rain had damaged the latter's mechanism, so that its  legs kept unfolding from time to time, to the great inconvenience of  Captain Greenfield, who brought up the rear with the blasting equipment.  Behind them and sometimes alongside them came something--or  someone--else.    [Illustration]    \"Surely your camp must have been closer to ours than this,\" Miss  Anspacher finally remarked after they had been slogging through mud and  water and pushing aside reluctant vegetation for over an Earth hour.    \"I am very much afraid,\" Jrann-Pttt admitted, \"that our camp has been  lost--that is to say, inundated.\"    \"What are we going to do now?\" the captain asked of the company at  large.    Professor Bernardi shrugged. \"Our only course would seem to be making  for one of the cities and throwing ourselves upon the na--Jrann-Pttt's  people's hospitality. If Professor Jrann-Pttt has even the vaguest idea  of the direction in which his home lies, we might as well head that  way.\" _I wonder whether the natives could help us raise the ship._    \"I'm sure my people will be more than happy to welcome you,\" Jrann-Pttt  said smoothly, \"and to make you"]]]
