Tarb had to  spread her wings wide to retain her balance. Her cloak flew off and an  adjoining table of diners disappeared beneath it.    [Illustration]    Stet and the headwaiter rushed to the rescue with profuse apologies,  Stet's crest undulating as if it concealed a nest of snakes. But Tarb  was too much frightened to be calmed.    \"Is this a hostile attack?\" she shrieked frantically at Stet. \"Because  the handbook never said shaking feet was an Earth custom!\"    \"No, no, she's a friend!\" Stet yelled, leaving the diners still  struggling with the cloak as he sped back to her. \"And shaking feet  isn't an Earth custom; she thinks it's a Fizbian one. You see.... Oh,  hell, never mind--I'll explain the whole thing to you later. But she's  just greeting you, trying to put you at your ease. It's Belinda Romney,  a very important Terrestrial. She owns the Solar Press--you must have  heard of it even on Fizbus--biggest news service on the planet.  Absolutely wouldn't do to offend her. Mrs. Romney, may I present Miss  Morfatch?\"    The woman beamed and continued to gush endlessly.    \"Tell her to let go my foot!\" Tarb demanded. \"It's getting so it feels  carbonated.\"    He smiled deprecatingly. \"Now, Tarb, we mustn't be rude--\"    For the first time in her life, Tarb spoke Terran to a Terrestrial. She  formed the words slowly and carefully: \"Sorry we must leave, but we have  to go to jail.\"    She looked to Stet for approval ... and didn't get it. He started to  explain something quickly to the woman. Every time she'd heard him speak  Terran, Tarb thought, he seemed to be introducing, explaining or  apologizing.    It turned out that, through some oversight, the usually thoughtful  Terran police department had neglected to inform the Fizbian consul that  one of his people had been incarcerated, for the young man had already  been tried, found guilty of assault plus contempt of court, and  sentenced to pay a large fine. However, after Stet had given his version  of the circumstances to a sympathetic judge, the sum was reduced to a  nominal one, which the _Times_ paid.    \"But I don't see why you should have paid anything at all,\" Bloxx  protested ungratefully. \"I didn't do anything wrong. You should have  made an issue of it.\"    \"According to Earth laws, you did do wrong,\" Stet said wearily, \"and  this is Earth. What's more, if we take the matter up, it will naturally  get into print. You don't want your employers to hear about it, do  you--even if you don't care about making Fizbians look ridiculous to  Terrestrials?\"    \"I suppose I wouldn't like FizbEarth to find out,\" Bloxx conceded. \"As  it is, I'll have to do some fast explaining to account for my not having  shown up for nearly a week. I'll say I caught some horrible Earth  disease--that'll scare them so much, they'll probably beg me to take  another week off. Though I do wish you fellows over at the _Times_ would  answer your mail sooner. I'm a regular subscriber, you know.\"           *       *       *       *       *    \"But the same kind of thing's going to happen over and over again, isn't  it, Stet?\" Tarb asked as a taxi took them back to the hotel in which  most of the _Times_ staff was domiciled. \"If privacy doesn't exist on  Earth, it's bound to keep occurring.\"    \"Eh?\" Stet took his attention away from her toes with some difficulty.  \"Some Earth people like privacy, too, but they have to fight for it.  Violations aren't legally punishable--that's the only difference.\"    \"Then surely the Terrestrials would understand about us, wouldn't they?\"  she asked eagerly. \"If they knew how strongly we felt about privacy,  maybe they wouldn't violate it--not as much, anyway. I'm sure they're  not vicious, just ignorant. And you can't just keep on getting Fizbians  out of jail each time they run up against the problem. It would be too  expensive, for one thing.\"    \"Don't worry,\" he said, pressing her toes. \"I'll take care of the whole  thing.\"    \"An article in the paper wouldn't really help much,\" she persisted  thoughtfully, \"and I suppose you must have run at least one already. It  would explain to the Fizbians that Terrestrials don't regard invasion of  privacy as a crime, but it wouldn't tell the Terrestrials that Fizbians  do. We'll have to think of--\"    \"You're surely not going to tell me how to run my paper on your first  day here, are you?\"    He tried to take the sting out of his words by twining his toes around  hers, but she felt guilty. She had been presumptuous. Probably there  were lots of things she couldn't understand yet--like why she shouldn't  polish her eyeballs in public. Stet had finally explained to her that,  while Terrestrial women did make up in public, they didn't scour their  irises, ever, and would be startled and horrified to see someone else  doing so.    \"But I was horrified to see them raking their feathers in public!\" Tarb  had contended.    \"Combing their hair, my dear. And why not? This is their planet.\"    That was always his answer. _I wonder_, she speculated, _whether he  would expect a Terrestrial visitor to Fizbus to fly ... because, after  all, Fizbus is our planet._ But she didn't dare broach the question.    However, if it was presumptuous of her to make helpful suggestions the  first day, it was more than presumptuous of Stet to ask her up to his  rooms to see his collection of rare early twentieth-century Terrestrial  milk bottles and other antiques. So she just told him courteously that  she was tired and wanted to go to roost. And, since the hotel had a  whole section fitted up to suit Fizbian requirements, she spent a more  comfortable night than she had expected.    She awoke the next day full of enthusiasm and ready to start in on the  great work at once. Although she might have been a little too forward  the previous night, she knew, as she took a reassuring glance in the  mirror, that Stet would forgive her.           *       *       *       *       *    In the office, she was, at first, somewhat self-conscious about Drosmig,  who hung insecurely from his perch muttering to himself, but she soon  forgot him in her preoccupation with duty. The first letter she picked  up--although again oddly unlike the ones she'd read in the paper on  Fizbus--seemed so simple that she felt she would have no difficulty in  answering it all by herself:         _Heidelberg_         _Dear Senbot Drosmig:_         _I am a professor of Fizbian History at a local university. Since       my salary is a small one, owing to the small esteem in which the       natives hold culture, I must economize wherever I can in order to       make both ends meet. Accordingly, I do my own cooking and shop at       the self-service supermarket around the corner, where I have found       that prices are lower than in the service groceries and the food no       worse._         _However, the manager and a number of the customers have objected       to my shopping with my feet. They don't so much mind my taking       packages off the shelves with them, but they have been quite       vociferous on the subject of my pinching the fruit with my toes.       Unripe fruit, however, makes me ill. What shall I do?_         _Sincerely yours,_         _Grez B'Groot_    Tarb dictated an unhesitating reply:         Dear Professor B'Groot:         Why don't you explain to the manager of the store that Fizbians       have wings and feet rather than arms and hands?         I'm sure his attitude and the attitudes of his customers will       change when they learn that your pinching the fruit with your feet       is not mere pedagogical eccentricity, but the regular practice on       our planet. Point out to him that your feet are covered and,       therefore, more sanitary than the bare hands of his other       customers.         And always put on clean socks before you go shopping.         Helpfully yours,         Senbot Drosmig    Miss Snow raised pale eyebrows.    \"Is something wrong?\" Tarb asked anxiously. \"Should I have put in that  bit about work, study, meditate? It seems inappropriate somehow.\"    \"Oh, no, not that. It's just that your letter--well, violates Mr.  Zarnon's precept that, in Rome, one must do as the Romans do.\"    \"But this isn't Rome,\" Tarb replied, bewildered. \"It's New York.\"    \"He didn't make the saying up,\" Miss Snow replied testily. \"It's a  Terrestrial proverb.\"    \"Oh,\" Tarb said.    She resented this creature's trying to tell her how to do her job. On  the other hand, Tarb was wise enough to realize that Miss Snow,  unpleasant though she might be, probably did know Stet well enough to be  able to predict his reactions.    So Tarb not only was reluctant to show Stet what she had already done,  but hesitated about answering another and even more urgent letter that  had just been brought in by special messenger. She tried to compromise  by submitting the letters to Drosmig--for, technically speaking, it was  he who was her immediate superior--but he merely groaned, \"Tell 'em all  to drop dead,\" from his perch and refused to open his eyes.    In the end, Tarb had to take the letters to Stet's office. Miss Snow  trailed along behind her, uninvited. And, since this was a place of  business, Tarb could not claim a privacy violation. Even if it weren't a  place of business, she remembered, she couldn't--not here on Earth.  Advanced spirituality, hah!    Advanced pain in the pinions!    Stet read the first letter and her answer smilingly. \"Excellent, Tarb--\"  her hearts leaped--\"for a first try, but I'd like to suggest a few  changes, if I may.\"    \"Well, of course,\" she said, pretending not to notice the smirk on Miss  Snow's face.    \"Just write this Professor B'Goot that he should do his shopping at a  grocery that offers service and practice his economies elsewhere.

You're not leaving your world. You're just  leaving Earth to go on the road. It's a longer road, but look at what's  waiting for you at the end of it.\"    \"Yes, look,\" Paul said, reality very much to the fore in his mind and  heart at that moment, \"death or vivisection.\"    \"Paul, do you believe I'd do that to you?\" There were tears in Ivo's  eyes. If he was acting, he was a great performer. _I really am one hell  of a good teacher_, Paul thought, _and with lots of raw material like  Ivo to work with, I could.... Could he really mean what he's saying_?    \"They won't harm you, Paul, because you will come to Sirius bearing a  message from me. You will tell my people that Earth has a powerful  defensive weapon and you have come to teach them its secret. And it's  true, Paul. The theater is your world's most powerful weapon, its best  defense against the universal enemy--reality.\"    \"Ivo,\" Paul said, \"you really must check that tendency toward bombast.  Especially with a purple speech like that; you've simply got to learn to  underplay. You'll watch out for that when I'm gone, won't you?\"    \"I will!\" Ivo's face lighted up. \"Oh, I will, Paul. I promise never to  chew the scenery again. I won't so much as nibble on a prop!\"           *       *       *       *       *    The next day, the two of them went up to Bear Mountain where Ivo's ship  had been cached all those months. Ivo explained to Paul how the controls  worked and showed him where the clean towels were.    Pausing in the airlock, Paul looked back toward Manhattan. \"I'd dreamed  so many years of seeing my name up in lights on Broadway,\" he murmured,  \"and now, just when I made it--\"    \"I'll keep it up there,\" Ivo vowed. \"I promise. And, meanwhile, you'll  be building a new Broadway up there in the stars!\"    \"Yes,\" Paul said dreamily, \"that is something to look forward to, isn't  it?\" Fresh, enthusiastic audiences, performers untrammeled by tradition,  a cooperative government, unlimited funds--why, there was a whole  wonderful new world opening up before him.    \"--In another ten years or so,\" Ivo was saying, \"Sirian actors will be  coming to Earth in droves, making the native performers look sick--\"    Paul smiled wisely. \"Now, Ivo, you know Equity would never stand for  _that_.\"    \"Equity won't be able to help itself. Public pressure will surge upward  in a mounting wave and--\" Ivo stopped. \"Sorry. I was ranting again,  wasn't I? It's being out in the open air that does it. I need to be  bounded by the four walls of a theater.\"    \"That's a fallacy,\" Paul began. \"On the Greek stage--\"    \"Save that for the stars, fella,\" Ivo smiled. \"You've got to leave  before it gets light.\" Then he wrung Paul's hand. \"Good-by, kid,\" he  said. \"You'll knock 'em dead on Sirius.\"    \"Good-by, Ivo.\" Paul returned the grip. Then he got inside and closed  the airlock door behind him. He did hope Ivo would correct that tendency  toward declamation; on the other hand, it was certainly better than  mumbling.    Paul put a _Sirian-in-a-jiffy_ record on the turntable, because he might  as well start learning the language right away. Of course he'd have no  one to talk to but himself for many months, but then, when all was said  and done, he was his own favorite audience. He strapped himself into the  acceleration couch and prepared for take-off.    \"Next week, _East Lynne_,\" he said to himself."]]]
