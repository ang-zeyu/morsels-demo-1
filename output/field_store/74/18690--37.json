Melas, the Austrian commander, now awoke in consternation to a sense  of his peril. Napoleon--the dreaded Napoleon--had, as by a miracle,  crossed the Alps. He had cut off all his supplies, and was shutting  the Austrians up from any possibility of retreat. Bewildered by the  magnitude of his peril, he no longer thought of forcing his march  upon Paris. The invasion of France was abandoned. His whole energies  were directed to opening for himself a passage back to Austria.  The most cruel perplexities agitated him. From the very pinnacle  of victory, he was in danger of descending to the deepest abyss of  defeat. It was also with Napoleon an hour of intense solicitude. He  had but sixty thousand men, two-thirds of whom were new soldiers,  who had never seen a shot fired in earnest, with whom he was  to arrest the march of a desperate army of one hundred and twenty  thousand veterans, abundantly provided with all the most efficient  machinery of war. There were many paths by which Melas might escape,  at leagues' distance from each other. It was necessary for Napoleon  to divide his little band that he might guard them all. He was  liable at any moment to have a division of his army attacked by  an overwhelming force, and cut to pieces before it could receive  any reinforcements. He ate not, he slept not, he rested not. Day  and night, and night and day, he was on horseback, pale, pensive,  apparently in feeble health, and interesting every beholder with  his grave and melancholy beauty. His scouts were out in every  direction. He studied all the possible movements and combinations  of his foes. Rapidly he overran Lombardy, and entered Milan in  triumph. Melas anxiously concentrated his forces, to break through  the net with which he was entangled. He did every thing in his  power to deceive Napoleon, by various feints, that the point of his  contemplated attack might not be known. Napoleon, in the following  clarion tones, appealed to the enthusiasm of his troops:    \"Soldiers! when we began our march, one department of France was  in the hands of the enemy. Consternation pervaded the south of the  Republic. You advanced. Already the French territory is delivered.  Joy and hope in our country have succeeded to consternation and  fear. The enemy, terror-struck, seeks only to regain his frontiers.  You have taken his hospitals, his magazines, his reserve parks.  The first act of the campaign is finished. Millions of men address  you in strains of praise. But shall we allow our audacious enemies  to violate with impunity the territory of the Republic? Will  you permit the army to escape which has carried terror into your  families? You will not. March, then, to meet him. Tear from his  brows the laurels he has won. Teach the world that a malediction  attends those who violate the territory of the Great People. The  result of our efforts will be unclouded glory, and a durable peace!\"    The very day Napoleon left Paris, Desaix arrived in France from  Egypt. Frank, sincere, upright, and punctiliously honorable, he was  one of the few whom Napoleon truly loved. Desaix regarded Napoleon  as infinitely his superior, and looked up to him with a species  of adoration; he loved him with a fervor of feeling which amounted  almost to a passion. Napoleon, touched, by the affection of a heart  so noble, requited it with the most confiding friendship. Desaix,  upon his arrival in Paris, found letters for him there from the  First Consul. As he read the confidential lines, he was struck with  the melancholy air with which they were pervaded. \"Alas!\" said he,  \"Napoleon has gained every thing, and yet he is unhappy. I must  hasten to meet him.\" Without delay he crossed the Alps, and arrived  at the head-quarters of Napoleon but a few days before the battle  of Marengo. They passed the whole night together, talking over the  events of Egypt and the prospects of France. Napoleon felt greatly  strengthened by the arrival of his noble friend, and immediately  assigned to him the command of a division of the army. \"Desaix,\"  said he, \"is my sheet anchor.\"    \"You have had a long interview with Desaix,\" said Bourrienne to  Napoleon the next morning. \"Yes!\" he replied; \"but I had my reasons.  As soon as I return to Paris I shall make him Minister of War. He  shall always be my lieutenant. I would make him a prince if I could.  He is of the heroic mould of antiquity!\"    Napoleon was fully aware that a decisive battle would soon take  place. Melas was rapidly, from all points, concentrating his army.  The following laconic and characteristic order was issued by the  First Consul to Lannes and Murat: \"Gather your forces at the river  Stradella. On the 8th or 9th at the latest, you will have on your  hands fifteen or eighteen thousand Austrians. Meet them, and cut  them to pieces. It will be so many enemies less upon our hands on  the day of the decisive battle we are to expect with the entire army  of Melas.\" The prediction was true. An Austrian force advanced,  eighteen thousand strong. Lannes met them upon the field of  Montebello. They were strongly posted, with batteries ranged upon  the hill sides, which swept the whole plain. It was of the utmost  moment that this body should be prevented from combining with the  other vast forces of the Austrians. Lannes had but eight thousand  men. Could he sustain the unequal conflict for a few hours, Victor,  who was some miles in the rear, could come up with a reserve  of four thousand men. The French soldiers, fully conscious of the  odds against which they were to contend, and of the carnage into  the midst of which they were plunging, with shouts of enthusiasm  rushed upon their foes. Instantaneously a storm of grape-shot from  all the batteries swept through his ranks. Said Lannes, \" I could  hear the bones crash in my division, like glass in a hail-storm  .\" For nine long hours, from eleven in the morning till eight at  night, the horrid carnage continued. Again and again the mangled,  bleeding, wasted columns were rallied to the charge. At last, when  three thousand Frenchmen were strewn dead upon the ground, the  Austrians broke and fled, leaving also three thousand mutilated  corpses and six thousand prisoners behind them. Napoleon, hastening  to the aid of his lieutenant, arrived upon the field just in time  to see the battle won. He rode up to Lannes. The intrepid soldier  stood in the midst of mounds of the dead--his sword dripping with  blood in his exhausted hand--his face blackened with powder and  smoke--and his uniform soiled and tattered by the long and terrific  strife. Napoleon silently, but proudly smiled upon the heroic  general, and forgot not his reward. From this battle Lannes received  the title of Duke of Montebello, a title by which his family is  distinguished to the present day.    This was the opening of the campaign. It inspired the French with  enthusiasm. It nerved the Austrians to despair. Melas now determined  to make a desperate effort to break through the toils. Napoleon,  with intense solicitude, was watching every movement of his foe,  knowing not upon what point the onset would fall. Before day-break  in the morning of the 14th of June, Melas, having accumulated forty  thousand men, including seven thousand cavalry and two hundred pieces  of cannon, made an impetuous assault upon the French, but twenty  thousand in number drawn up upon the plain of Marengo. Desaix,  with a reserve of six thousand men, was at such a distance, nearly  thirty miles from Marengo, that he could not possibly be recalled  before the close of the day. The danger was frightful that the  French would be entirely cut to pieces, before any succor could  arrive. But the quick ear of Desaix caught the sound of the heavy  cannonade as it came booming over the plain, like distant thunder.  He sprung from his couch and listened. The heavy and uninterrupted  roar, proclaimed a pitched battle, and he was alarmed for his  beloved chief. Immediately he roused his troops, and they started  upon the rush to succor their comrades. Napoleon dispatched courier  after courier to hurry the division along, while his troops stood  firm through terrific hours, as their ranks were plowed by the  murderous discharges of their foes. At last the destruction was too  awful for mortal men to endure. Many divisions of the army broke  and fled, crying \" All is lost--save himself who can .\" A scene of  frightful disorder ensued. The whole plain was covered with fugitive,  swept like an inundation before the multitudinous Austrians.  Napoleon still held a few squares together, who slowly and sullenly  retreated, while two hundred pieces of artillery, closely pressing  them, poured incessant death into their ranks. Every foot of ground  was left encumbered with the dead. It was now three o'clock in  the afternoon. Melas, exhausted with toil, and assured that he had  gained a complete victory, left Gen. Zach to finish the work. He  retired to his head quarters, and immediately dispatched couriers  all over Europe to announce the great victory of Marengo. Said an  Austrian veteran, who had before encountered Napoleon at Arcola  and Rivoli, \"Melas is too sanguine. Depend upon it our day's work  is not yet done. Napoleon will yet be upon us with his reserve.\"    Just then the anxious eye of the First Consulespied the solid columns  of Desaix entering the plain. Desaix, plunging his spurs into his  horse, outstripped all the rest, and galloped into the presence of  Napoleon. As he cast a glance over the wild confusion and devastation  of the field, the exclaimed hurriedly, \"I see that the battle  is lost. I suppose I can do no more for you than to secure your  retreat.\" \"By no means,\" Napoleon replied with apparently as much  composure as if he had been sitting by his own fireside, \"the battle,  I trust, is gained. Charge"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3777"],[0,"Tom Swift and His Electric Rifle; Or, Daring Adventures in Elephant Land (#4)"],[1," on, try your luck at a shot.\"    \"I'm afraid I might disturb Mr. Moker, or some of the neighbors.\"    \"No danger. I've got it adjusted right now. Come on, see if you can  shatter this steel target,\" and Tom set up a small one at the end of  the range.    Then, having properly fixed the weapon, Tom handed it to his chum,  and, taking his place in a protected part of the gallery, prepared  to watch the effect of the shot.    \"Let her go!\" cried Tom, and Ned pressed the button.    The effect was wonderful. Though there was no noise, smoke nor  flame, the steel plate seemed to crumple up, and collapse as if it  had been melted in the fire. There was a jagged hole through the  center, but some frail boards back of it were not even splintered.    \"Good shot!\" cried Tom enthusiastically. \"I had the distance gage  right that time.\"    \"You sure did,\" agreed Ned. \"The electric bullet stopped as soon as  it did its work on the plate. What's next?\"    \"I'm going to try a difficult test,\" explained Tom. \"You know I said  the gun would shoot luminous charges?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Well, I'm going to try that, now. I wish we had another image to  shoot at, but I'll take a big dry-goods box, and make believe it's  an elephant. Now, this is going to be a hard test, such as we'd meet  with, if we were hunting in Africa. I want you to help me.\"    \"What am I to do?\" asked Ned.    \"I want you to go outside,\" explained Tom, \"set up a dry-goods box  against the side of the little hill back of the shed, and not tell  me where you put it. Then I'll go out, and, by means of the luminous  charge, I'll locate the box, set the distance gage, and destroy it.\"    \"Well, you can see it anyhow, in the moonlight,\" objected Ned.    \"No, the moon is under a cloud now,\" explained Tom, looking out of a  window. \"It's quite dark, and will give me just the test I want for  my new electric rifle.\"    \"But won't it be dangerous, firing in the dark? Suppose you misjudge  the distance, and the bullet, or charge, files off and hits some  one?\"    \"It can't. I'll set the distance gage before I shoot. But if I  should happen to make a mistake the charge will go into the side of  the hill, and spend itself there. There is no danger. Go ahead, and  set up the box, and then come and tell me. Mr. Jackson will help  you.\"    Ned and the engineer left the gallery. As Tom had said, it was very  dark now, and if Tom could see in the night to hit a box some  distance away, his weapon would be all that he claimed for it.    \"This will do,\" said the engineer, as he pointed to a box, one of  several piled up outside the shed. The two could hardly see to make  their way along, carrying it to the foot of the hill, and they  stumbled several times. But at last it was in position, and then Ned  departed to call Tom, and have him try the difficult test--that of  hitting an object in the dark.          CHAPTER IV    BIG TUSKS WANTED      \"Well, are you all ready for me?\" asked the young inventor, as he  took up his curious weapon, and followed Ned out into the yard. It  was so dark that they had fairly to stumble along.    \"Yes, we're ready,\" answered Ned. \"And you'll be a good one, Tom, if  you do this stunt. Now stand here,\" he went on, as he indicated a  place as well as he could in the dark. \"The box is somewhere in that  direction,\" and he waved his hand vaguely. \"I'm not going to tell  you any more, and let's see you find it.\"    \"Oh, I will, all right--or, rather, my electric rifle will,\"  asserted Tom.    The inventor of the curious and terrible weapon took his position.  Behind him stood Ned and Mr. Jackson, and just before Tom was ready  to fire, his father came stalking through the darkness, calling to  them.    \"Are you there, Tom?\"    \"Yes Dad, is anything the matter?\"    \"No, but I thought I'd like to see what luck you have. Rad was  saying you were going to have a test in the dark.\"    \"I'm about ready for it,\" replied Tom. \"I'm going to blow up a box  that I can't see. You know how it's done, Dad, for you helped me in  perfecting the luminous charge, but it's going to be something of a  novelty to the others. Here we go, now!\"    Tom raised his rifle, and aimed it in the dark. Ned Newton,  straining his eyes to see, was sure the young inventor was pointing  the gun at least twenty feet to one side of where the box was  located, but he said nothing, for from experiences in the past, he  realized that Tom knew what he was doing.    There was a little clicking sound, as the youth moved some gear  wheel on his gun. Then there came a faint crackling noise, like some  distant wireless apparatus beginning to flash a message through  space.    Suddenly a little ball of purplish light shot through the darkness  and sped forward like some miniature meteor. It shed a curious  illuminating glow all about, and the ground, and the objects on it  were brought into relief as by a lightning flash.    An instant later the light increased in intensity, and seemed to  burst like some piece of aerial fireworks. There was a bright glare,  in which Ned and the others could see the various buildings about  the shed. They could see each other's faces, and they looked pale  and ghastly in the queer glow. They could see the box, brought into  bold relief, where Ned and the engineer had placed it.    Then, before the light had died away, they witnessed a curious  sight. The heavy wooden box seemed to dissolve, to collapse and to  crumple up like one of paper, and ere the last rays of the  illuminating bullet faded, the watchers saw the splinters of wood  fall back with a clatter in a little heap on the spot where the  dry-goods case had been.    A silence followed, and the darkness was all the blacker by contrast  with the intense light. At length Tom spoke, and he could not keep  from his voice a note of triumph.    \"Well, did I do it?\" he asked.    \"You sure did!\" exclaimed Ned heartily.    \"Fine!\" cried Mr. Swift.    \"Golly! I wouldn't gib much fo' de hide ob any burglar what comed  around heah!\" muttered Eradicate Sampson. \"Dat box am knocked clean  into nuffiness, Massa Tom.\"    \"That's what I wanted to do,\" explained the lad. \"And I guess this  will end the test for tonight.\"    \"But I don't exactly understand it,\" spoke Ned, as they all moved  toward the Swift home, Eradicate going to the stable to see how his  mule was. \"Do you have two kinds of bullets, Tom, one for night and  one for the daytime?\"    \"No,\" answered Tom, \"there is only one kind of bullet, and, as I  have said, that isn't a bullet at all. That is, you can't see it, or  handle it, but you can feel it. Strictly speaking, it is a  concentrated discharge of wireless electricity directed against a  certain object. You can't see it any more than you can see a  lightning bolt, though that is sometimes visible as a ball of fire.  My electric rifle bullets are similar to a discharge of lightning,  except that they are invisible.\"    \"But we saw the one just now,\" objected Ned.    \"No, you didn't see the bullet,\" said Tom.    \"You saw the illuminating flash which I send out just before I fire,  to reveal the object I am to hit. That is another part of my rifle  and is only used at night.\"    \"You see I shoot out a ball of electrical fire which will disclose  the target, or the enemy at whom I am firing. As soon as that is  discharged the rifle automatically gets ready to shoot the electric  charge, and I have only to press the proper button, and the  'bullet,' as I call it, follows on the heels of the ball of light.  Do you see?\"    \"Perfectly,\" exclaimed Ned with a laugh. \"What a gun that would be  for hunting, since most all wild beasts come out only at night.\"    \"That was one object in making this invention,\" said Tom. \"I only  hope I get a chance to use it now.\"    \"I thought you were going to Africa after elephants,\" spoke Mr.  Swift.    \"Well, I did think of it,\" admitted Tom, \"but I haven't made any  definite plans. But come into the house, Ned, and I'll show you more  in detail how my rifle works.\"    Thereupon the two chums spent some time going into the mysteries of  the new weapon. Mr. Swift and Mr. Jackson were also much interested,  for, though they had seen the gun previously and had helped Tom  perfect it, they had not yet tired of discussing its merits.    Ned stayed quite late that night, and promised to come over the next  day, and watch Tom do some more shooting.    \"I'll show you how to use it, too,\" promised the young inventor, and  he was as good as his word, initiating Ned into the mysteries of the  electric rifle, and showing him to store the charges of death-dealing  electricity in the queer-looking stock.    For a week after that Tom and Ned practiced with the terrible gun,  taking care not to have any more mishaps like the one that had  marked the first night. They were both good shots with ordinary  weapons and it was not long before they had equaled their record  with the new instrument.    It was one warm afternoon, when Tom was out in the meadow at one  side of his house, practicing with his rifle on some big boxes he  had set up for targets, that he saw an elderly man standing close to  the fence watching him. When Tom blew to pieces a particularly large  packing-case, standing a long distance away from it, the stranger  called to the youth.    \"I beg your pardon,\" he said, \"but is that a dynamite gun you are  using?\"    \"No, it's an electric rifle,\" was the answer.    \"Would you mind telling me something about it?\" went on the elderly  man, and as Tom's weapon was now fully protected by patents, the  young inventor cordially invited the stranger to come nearer and see  how it worked.    \"That's the greatest thing I ever saw!\" exclaimed the man  enthusiastically when Tom had blown up another box, and had told of  the illumination for night firing. \"The most wonderful weapon I ever  heard of! What a gun it would be in my business.\"    \"What is your trade?\" asked Tom curiously, for he had"]]]
