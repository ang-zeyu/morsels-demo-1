(#4)"],[1,"on a  platform, rattling a bag of balls, and whose unintermitted screeching,  singsong cries had throughout risen shrill and distinct above every  other sound. At that moment the noise and uproar were carried to the  highest The whole house seemed rising against the boy, and he,  single-handed, or rather single-tongued, was doing battle with the  whole, sending forth a clear stream of vocal power, which for a while  bore its way triumphantly through the whole troubled waters, till,  finding himself overpowered by the immense majority, with a tone that  set the whole mass in a roar, and showed his democratic principles, he  cried out, \"Vox populi est vox Dei!\" and submitted.    Along the corridor, and in the whole area of the patio, or courtyard,  were tables, and benches, and papers, and grains of corn, and ponderous  sticks, the same as in the sala, and men and women sitting as close  together. The passages were choked up, and over the heads of those  sitting at the tables, all within reach were bending their eyes  earnestly upon the mysterious papers. They were grayheads, boys and  girls, and little children; fathers and mothers; husbands and wives;  masters and servants; men high in office, muleteers, and bull-fighters;  senoras and senoritas, with jewels around their necks and roses in  their hair, and Indian women, worth only the slight covering they had  on; beauty and deformity; the best and the vilest in Merida; perhaps,  in all, two thousand persons; and this great multitude, many of whom we  had seen but a few minutes before on their knees in the church, and  among them the fair bevy of girls who had stood by us on the steps,  were now assembled in a public gambling-house! a beautiful spectacle  for a stranger the first night of his arrival in the capital!    But the devil is not so black as he is painted. I do not mean to offer  any apology for gambling, in Yucatan, as in all the rest of Mexico, the  bane and scourge of all ranks of society; but Merida is, in a small  way, a city of my love, and I would fain raise this great mass of  people from the gulf into which I have just plunged them: at least, I  would lift their heads a little above water.    The game which they were engaged in playing is called La Loteria, or  the Lottery. It is a favourite amusement throughout all the Mexican  provinces, and extends to every village in Yucatan. It is authorized by  the government, and, as was formerly the case to a pernicious extent  with the lotteries in our own country, is used as an instrument to  raise money, either for the use of the government itself, or for other  purposes which are considered deserving. The principle of the game, or  the scheme, consists of different combinations of numbers, from one to  ninety, which are written on papers, nine rows on each side, with five  figures in each row. As ninety figures admit of combinations to an  almost indefinite extent, any number of papers can be issued, each  containing a different series of combinations. These papers are stamped  by the government, and sold at a real, or twelve and a half cents each.  Every player purchases one of these papers, and fastens it to the table  before him with a wafer. A purse is then made up, each player putting  in a certain sum, which is collected by a boy in a hat. The boy with  the bag of balls then announces, or rather sings out, the amount of the  purse, and rattling his bag of balls, draws out one, and sings the  number drawn. Every player marks on his paper with a grain of corn the  number called off, and the one who is first able to mark five numbers  in a row wins the purse. This he announces by rapping on the table with  the stick, and standing up in his place. The boy sings over again the  numbers drawn, and if, on comparison, all is found right, delivers the  purse. The game is then ended, and another begins. Sometimes mistakes  occur, and it was a mistake that led to the extraordinary clamour and  confusion we had found on reaching the neighbourhood of the boy.    The amount played for will give some idea of the character of the game.  Before commencing, the boy called out that the stake should in no case  exceed two reals. This, however, was considered too high, and it was  fixed by general consent at a medio, or six and a quarter cents. The  largest amount proclaimed by the boy was twenty-seven dollars and three  reals, which, divided among four hundred and thirty-eight players, did  not make very heavy gambling. In fact, an old gentleman near whom I was  standing told me it was a small affair, and not worth learning; but he  added that there was a place in the neighbourhood where they played  monte for doubloons. The whole amount circulated during the evening  fell far short of what is often exchanged at a small party in a private  drawing-room at home, and among those who would not relish the  imputation of being accounted gamblers. In fact, it is perhaps but just  to say that this great concourse of people was not brought together by  the spirit of gambling. The people of Merida are fond of amusements,  and in the absence of theatres and other public entertainments, the  loteria is a great gathering-place, where persons of all ages and  classes go to meet acquaintances. Rich and poor, great and small, meet  under the same roof on a footing of perfect equality; good feeling is  cultivated among all without any forgetting their place. Whole families  go thither together; young people procure seats near each other, and  play at more desperate games than the loteria, where hearts, or at  least hands, are at stake, and perhaps that night some bold player, in  losing his medios, drew a richer prize than the large purse of  twenty-seven dollars and three reals. In fact, the loteria is  considered merely an accessory to the pleasures of social intercourse;  and, instead of gaming, it might be called a grand _conversacione_, but  not very select; at least such was our conclusion; and there was  something to make us rather uncharitable, for the place was hot enough  to justify an application to it of the name bestowed in common parlance  on the gambling-houses of London and Paris.    At about eleven o'clock we left. On our way down the street we passed  the open door of a house in which were tables piled with gold and  silver, and men around playing what, in the opinion of my old adviser  of the loteria, was a game worth learning. We returned to the house,  and found, what in our haste to be at the fiesta we had paid no  attention to, that Dona Micaela could give us but one room, and that a  small one, and near the door. As we expected to remain some days in  Merida, we determined the next morning to take a house and go to  housekeeping. While arranging ourselves for the night, we heard a loud,  unnatural noise at the door, and, going out, found rolling over the  pavement the Cerberus of the mansion, an old Indian miserably deformed,  with his legs drawn up, his back down, his neck and head thrust  forward, and his eyes starting from their sockets; he was entertaining  himself with an outrageous soliloquy in the Maya tongue, and at our  appearance he pitched his voice higher than before. Signs and threats  had no effect. Secure in his deformity, he seemed to feel a malicious  pleasure that he had it in his power to annoy us. We gave up, and while  he continued rolling out tremendous Maya, we fell asleep. So passed our  first night in Merida.                                        CHAPTER II.

Early the next morning the carreta arrived with our luggage, and, to  avoid the trouble of loading and unloading, we directed it to remain at  the door, and set out immediately to look for a house. We had not much  time, and, consequently, but little choice; but, with the help of Dona  Micaela, in half an hour we found one that answered our purpose. We  returned and started the carreta; an Indian followed, carrying on his  head a table, and on the top of it a washhand-basin; another with three  chairs, all Dona Micaela's, and we closed the procession.    Our house was in the street of the Flamingo. Like most of the houses in  Merida, it was built of stone, and had one story; the front was about  thirty feet and had a sala covering the whole, about twenty feet in  depth. The ceiling was perhaps eighteen feet high, and the walls had  wooden knobs for fastening hammocks. Behind the sala was a broad  corridor, opening on a courtyard, at one side of which was a  sleeping-room, and at the back of that a comeder or eating-room. The  floors were all of hard cement. The courtyard was about thirty feet  square, with high stone walls, and a well in the centre. Next, running  across the lot, was a kitchen, with a sleeping-room for servants, and  back of that another courtyard, forty feet deep, with stone walls  fifteen feet high; and in order that my inquiring fellow-citizens may  form some idea of the comparative value of real estate in Merida and  New-York, I mention that the rent was four dollars per month, which for  three persons we did not consider extravagant. We had our own  travelling beds, the table, washhand-basin, and chairs set up, and  before breakfast our house was furnished.    In the mean time the fiesta of San Cristoval was going on. Grand mass  was over, and the next ceremony in order was a _corrida de toros_ or  bull-fight, to commence at ten o'clock.    The Plaza de Toros, or, in English, the bull-ring, was in the square of  the church of San Cristoval. The enclosure or place for spectators"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3317"],[0,"Now It Can Be Told (#4)"],[1,"too much at his own jokes, and his laughter was just a tone too shrill.  An officer came into the hall, carrying two Mills bombs--new toys in  those days--and the others fell back from him, and one said:    \"For Christ's sake don't bring them here--in the middle of a  bombardment!\"    \"Where's the general?\" asked the newcomer.    \"Down in the cellar with the other brigadier. They don't ask us down to  tea, I notice.\"    Those last words caused all the officers to laugh--almost excessively.  But their laughter ended sharply, and they listened intently as there  was a heavy crash outside.    Another officer came up the steps and made a rapid entry into the hall.    \"I understand there is to be a conference of battalion commanders,\"  he said, with a queer catch in his breath. \"In view of  this--er--bombardment, I had better come in later, perhaps?\"    \"You had better wait,\" said the brigade major, rather grimly.    \"Oh, certainly.\"    A sergeant-major was pacing up and down the passage by the back door.  He was calm and stolid. I liked the look of him and found something  comforting in his presence, so that I went to have a few words with him.    \"How long is this likely to last, Sergeant-major\"    \"There's no saying, sir. They may be searching for the chateau to pass  the time, so to speak, or they may go on till they get it. I'm sorry  they caught those gunners. Nice lads, both of them.\"    He did not seem to be worrying about his own chance.    Then suddenly there was silence. The German guns had switched off. I  heard the larks singing through the open doorway, and all the little  sounds of a summer day. The group of officers in the hall started  chatting more quietly. There was no more need of finding jokes and  laughter. They had been reprieved, and could be serious.    \"We'd better get forward to Vermelles,\" said my companion.    As we walked away from the chateau, the brigade major passed us on his  horse. He leaned over his saddle toward me and said, \"Good day to you,  and I hope you'll like Vermelles.\"    The words were civil, but there was an underlying meaning in them.    \"I hope to do so, sir.\"    We walked down the long straight road toward the ruins of Vermelles with  a young soldier-guide who on the outskirts of the village remarked in a  casual way:    \"No one is allowed along this road in daylight, as a rule. It's under  hobservation of the henemy.\"    \"Then why the devil did you come this way?\" asked my companion.    \"I thought you might prefer the short cut, sir.\"    We explored the ruins of Vermelles, where many young Frenchmen had  fallen in fighting through the walls and gardens. One could see the  track of their strife, in trampled bushes and broken walls. Bits of  red rag--the red pantaloons of the first French soldiers--were still  fastened to brambles and barbed wire. Broken rifles, cartouches,  water-bottles, torn letters, twisted bayonets, and German stick-bombs  littered the ditches which had been dug as trenches across streets of  burned-out houses.          V      A young gunner officer whom we met was very civil, and stopped in front  of the chateau of Vermelles, a big red villa with the outer walls still  standing, and told us the story of its capture.    \"It was a wild scrap. I was told all about it by a French sergeant who  was in it. They were under the cover of that wall over there, about a  hundred yards away, and fixing up a charge of high explosives to knock  a breach in the wall. The chateau was a machine-gun fortress, with  the Germans on the top floor, the ground floor, and in the basement,  protected by sand-bags, through which they fired. A German officer made  a bad mistake. He opened the front door and came out with some of his  machine-gunners from the ground floor to hold a trench across the square  in front of the house. Instantly a French lieutenant called to his men.  They climbed over the wall and made a dash for the chateau, bayoneting  the Germans who tried to stop them. Then they swarmed into the  chateau--a platoon of them with the lieutenant. They were in the  drawing-room, quite an elegant place, you know, with the usual gilt  furniture and long mirrors. In one corner was a pedestal, with a statue  of Venus standing on it. Rather charming, I expect. A few Germans were  killed in the room, easily. But upstairs there was a mob who fired  down through the ceiling when they found what had happened. The French  soldiers prodded the ceiling with their bayonets, and all the plaster  broke, falling on them. A German, fat and heavy, fell half-way through  the rafters, and a bayonet was poked into him as he stuck there. The  whole ceiling gave way, and the Germans upstairs came downstairs, in a  heap. They fought like wolves--wild beasts--with fear and rage. French  and Germans clawed at one another's throats, grabbed hold of noses,  rolled over each other. The French sergeant told me he had his teeth  into a German's neck. The man was all over him, pinning his arms, trying  to choke him. It was the French lieutenant who did most damage. He fired  his last shot and smashed a German's face with his empty revolver. Then  he caught hold of the marble Venus by the legs and swung it above his  head, in the old Berserker style, and laid out Germans like ninepins...  The fellows in the basement surrendered.\"          VI      The chateau of Vermelles, where that had happened, was an empty ruin,  and there was no sign of the gilt furniture, or the long mirrors, or the  marble Venus when I looked through the charred window-frames upon piles  of bricks and timber churned up by shell-fire. The gunner officer took  us to the cemetery, to meet some friends of his who had their battery  nearby. We stumbled over broken walls and pushed through undergrowth  to get to the graveyard, where some broken crosses and wire frames  with immortelles remained as relics of that garden where the people of  Vermelles had laid their dead to rest. New dead had followed old dead.  I stumbled over something soft, like a ball of clay, and saw that it was  the head of a faceless man, in a battered kepi. From a ditch close by  came a sickly stench of half-buried flesh.    \"The whole place is a pest-house,\" said the gunner.    Another voice spoke from some hiding-place.    \"Salvo!\"    The earth shook and there was a flash of red flame, and a shock of noise  which hurt one's ear-drums.    \"That's my battery,\" said the gunner officer. \"It's the very devil when  one doesn't expect it.\"    I was introduced to the gentleman who had said \"Salvo!\" He was the  gunner-major, and a charming fellow, recently from civil life. All the  battery was made up of New Army men learning their job, and learning it  very well, I should say. There was no arrogance about them.    \"It's sporting of you to come along to a spot like this,\" said one of  them. \"I wouldn't unless I had to. Of course you'll take tea in our  mess?\"    I was glad to take tea--in a little house at the end of the ruined  high-street of Vermelles which had by some miracle escaped destruction,  though a shell had pierced through the brick wall of the parlor and had  failed to burst. It was there still, firmly wedged, like a huge nail.  The tea was good, in tin mugs. Better still was the company of the  gunner officers. They told me how often they were \"scared stiff.\" They  had been very frightened an hour before I came, when the German gunners  had ranged up and down the street, smashing up ruined houses into  greater ruin.    \"They're so methodical!\" said one of the officers.    \"Wonderful shooting!\" said another.    \"I will say they're topping gunners,\" said the major. \"But we're  learning; my men are very keen. Put in a good word for the new  artillery. It would buck them up no end.\"    We went back before sunset, down the long straight road, and past the  chateau which we had visited in the afternoon. It looked very peaceful  there among the trees.    It is curious that I remember the details of that day so vividly,  as though they happened yesterday. On hundreds of other days I had  adventures like that, which I remember more dimly.    \"That brigade major was a trifle haughty, don't you think?\" said my  companion. \"And the others didn't seem very friendly. Not like those  gunner boys.\"    \"We called at an awkward time. They were rather fussed.\"    \"One expects good manners. Especially from Regulars who pride themselves  on being different in that way from the New Army.\"    \"It's the difference between the professional and the amateur soldier.  The Regular crowd think the war belongs to them... But I liked their  pluck. They're arrogant to Death himself when he comes knocking at the  door.\"          VII      It was not long before we broke down the prejudice against us among  the fighting units. The new armies were our friends from the first, and  liked us to visit them in their trenches and their dugouts, their  camps and their billets. Every young officer was keen to show us his  particular \"peep-show\" or to tell us his latest \"stunt.\" We made many  friends among them, and it was our grief that as the war went on so many  of them disappeared from their battalions, and old faces were replaced  by new faces, and those again by others when they had become familiar.  Again and again, after battle, twenty-two officers in a battalion mess  were reduced to two or three, and the gaps were filled up from the  reserve depots. I was afraid to ask, \"Where is So-and-so?\" because I  knew that the best answer would be, \"A Blighty wound,\" and the worst was  more likely.    It was the duration of all the drama of death that seared one's soul as  an onlooker; the frightful sum of sacrifice that we were recording day  by day. There were times when it became intolerable and agonizing, and  when I at least desired peace-at-almost-any-price, peace by negotiation,  by compromise, that the river of blood might cease to flow. The men  looked so splendid as they"]]]
