To this end,      and to provide against wastefulness or foolishness on your part, or,      indeed, against any generosity, howsoever worthy, which might      impoverish you and so defeat her benevolent intentions regarding your      education, comfort, and future good, she did not place the estate      directly in your hands, leaving you to do as you might feel inclined      about it.  But, on the contrary, she entrusted the corpus of it in      the hands of men whom she believed should be resolute enough and      strong enough to carry out her intent, even against any cajolements      or pressure which might be employed to the contrary.  It being her      intention, then, that such trustees as she appointed would use for      your benefit the interest accruing annually from the capital at      command, _and that only_ (as specifically directed in the will), so      that on your arriving at full age the capital entrusted to us should      be handed over to you intact, I find a hard-and-fast duty in the      matter of adhering exactly to the directions given.  I have no doubt      that my co-trustees regard the matter in exactly the same light.      Under the circumstances, therefore, we, the trustees, have not only a      single and united duty towards you as the object of the testator's      wishes, but towards each other as regards the manner of the carrying      out of that duty.  I take it, therefore, that it would not be      consonant with the spirit of the trust or of our own ideas in      accepting it that any of us should take a course pleasant to himself      which would or might involve a stern opposition on the part of other      of the co-trustees.  We have each of us to do the unpleasant part of      this duty without fear or favour.  You understand, of course, that      the time which must elapse before you come into absolute possession      of your estate is a limited one.  As by the terms of the will we are      to hand over our trust when you have reached the age of twenty-one,      there are only seven years to expire.  But till then, though I should      gladly meet your wishes if I could, I must adhere to the duty which I      have undertaken.  At the expiration of that period you will be quite      free to divest yourself of your estate without protest or comment of      any man.        Having now expressed as clearly as I can the limitations by which I      am bound with regard to the corpus of your estate, let me say that in      any other way which is in my power or discretion I shall be most      happy to see your wishes carried out so far as rests with me.      Indeed, I shall undertake to use what influence I may possess with my      co-trustees to induce them to take a similar view of your wishes.  In      my own thinking you are quite free to use your own property in your      own way.  But as, until you shall have attained your majority, you      have only life-user in your mother's bequest, you are only at liberty      to deal with the annual increment.  On our part as trustees we have a      first charge on that increment to be used for purposes of your      maintenance, clothes, and education.  As to what may remain over each      half-year, you will be free to deal with it as you choose.  On      receiving from you a written authorization to your trustees, if you      desire the whole sum or any part of it to be paid over to Miss Janet      MacKelpie, I shall see that it is effected.  Believe me, that our      duty is to protect the corpus of the estate, and to this end we may      not act on any instruction to imperil it.  But there our warranty      stops.  We can deal during our trusteeship with the corpus only.      Further, lest there should arise any error on your part, we can deal      with any general instruction for only so long as it may remain      unrevoked.  You are, and must be, free to alter your instructions or      authorizations at any time.  Thus your latest document must be used      for our guidance.        As to the general principle involved in your wish I make no comment.      You are at liberty to deal with your own how you will.  I quite      understand that your impulse is a generous one, and I fully believe      that it is in consonance with what had always been the wishes of my      sister.  Had she been happily alive and had to give judgment of your      intent, I am convinced that she would have approved.  Therefore, my      dear nephew, should you so wish, I shall be happy for her sake as      well as your own to pay over on your account (as a confidential      matter between you and me), but from my own pocket, a sum equal to      that which you wish transferred to Miss Janet MacKelpie.  On hearing      from you I shall know how to act in the matter.  With all good      wishes,                                                             Believe me to be,                                                    Your affectionate uncle,                                                               ROGER MELTON.        TO RUPERT SENT LEGER, ESQ.    _Letter from Rupert Sent Leger to Roger Melton_,                                                               _July_ 5, 1892.        MY DEAR UNCLE,        Thank you heartily for your kind letter.  I quite understand, and now      see that I should not have asked you as a trustee, such a thing.  I      see your duty clearly, and agree with your view of it.  I enclose a      letter directed to my trustees, asking them to pay over annually till      further direction to Miss Janet MacKelpie at this address whatever      sum may remain over from the interest of my mother's bequest after      deduction of such expenses as you may deem fit for my maintenance,      clothing, and education, together with a sum of one pound sterling      per month, which was the amount my dear mother always gave me for my      personal use--\"pocket-money,\" she called it.        With regard to your most kind and generous offer to give to my dear      Aunt Janet the sum which I would have given myself, had such been in      my power, I thank you most truly and sincerely, both for my dear aunt      (to whom, of course, I shall not mention the matter unless you      specially authorize me) and myself.  But, indeed, I think it will be      better not to offer it.  Aunt Janet is very proud, and would not      accept any benefit.  With me, of course, it is different, for since I      was a wee child she has been like another mother to me, and I love      her very much.  Since my mother died--and she, of course, was      all-in-all to me--there has been no other.  And in such a love as      ours pride has no place.  Thank you again, dear uncle, and God bless      you.                                                           Your loving nephew,                                                          RUPERT SENT LEGER.        ERNEST ROGER HALBARD MELTON'S RECORD--_Continued_.      And now _re_ the remaining one of Sir Geoffrey's children, Roger.  He was  the third child and third son, the only daughter, Patience, having been  born twenty years after the last of the four sons.  Concerning Roger, I  shall put down all I have heard of him from my father and grandfather.  From my grand-aunt I heard nothing, I was a very small kid when she died;  but I remember seeing her, but only once.  A very tall, handsome woman of  a little over thirty, with very dark hair and light-coloured eyes.  I  think they were either grey or blue, but I can't remember which.  She  looked very proud and haughty, but I am bound to say that she was very  nice to me.  I remember feeling very jealous of Rupert because his mother  looked so distinguished.  Rupert was eight years older than me, and I was  afraid he would beat me if I said anything he did not like.  So I was  silent except when I forgot to be, and Rupert said very unkindly, and I  think very unfairly, that I was \"A sulky little beast.\"  I haven't forgot  that, and I don't mean to.  However, it doesn't matter much what he said  or thought.  There he is--if he is at all--where no one can find him,  with no money or nothing, for what little he had he settled when he came  of age, on the MacSkelpie.  He wanted to give it to her when his mother  died, but father, who was a trustee, refused; and Uncle Roger, as I call  him, who is another, thought the trustees had no power to allow Rupert to  throw away his matrimony, as I called it, making a joke to father when he  called it patrimony.  Old Sir Colin MacSkelpie, who is the third, said he  couldn't take any part in such a permission, as the MacSkelpie was his  niece.  He is a rude old man, that.  I remember when, not remembering his  relationship, I spoke of the MacSkelpie, he caught me a clip on the ear  that sent me across the room.  His Scotch is very broad.  I can hear him  say, \"Hae some attempt at even Soothern manners, and dinna misca' yer  betters, ye young puddock, or I'll wring yer snoot!\"  Father was, I could  see, very much offended, but he didn't say anything.  He remembered, I  think, that the General is a V.C. man, and was fond of fighting duels.  But to show that the fault was not his, _he_ wrung _my_ ear--and the same  ear too!  I suppose he thought that was justice!  But it's only right to  say that he made up for it afterwards.  When the General had gone he gave  me a five-pound note.    I don't think Uncle Roger was very pleased with the way Rupert behaved  about the legacy, for I don't think he ever saw him from that day to  this.  Perhaps, of course, it was because Rupert ran away shortly  afterwards; but I shall tell about that when I come to him.  After all,  why should my uncle bother about him?  He is not a Melton at all, and I  am to be Head of the House--of course, when the Lord thinks right to take  father to Himself!  Uncle Roger has tons of money, and he never"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31"],[0,"Plays of Sophocles: Oedipus the King; Oedipus at Colonus; Antigone (#4)"],[1," desires.    CREON  And with you twain I share the triple rule?    OEDIPUS  Yea, and it is that proves thee a false friend.    CREON  Not so, if thou wouldst reason with thyself,  As I with myself.  First, I bid thee think,  Would any mortal choose a troubled reign  Of terrors rather than secure repose,  If the same power were given him?  As for me,  I have no natural craving for the name  Of king, preferring to do kingly deeds,  And so thinks every sober-minded man.  Now all my needs are satisfied through thee,  And I have naught to fear; but were I king,  My acts would oft run counter to my will.  How could a title then have charms for me  Above the sweets of boundless influence?  I am not so infatuate as to grasp  The shadow when I hold the substance fast.  Now all men cry me Godspeed! wish me well,  And every suitor seeks to gain my ear,  If he would hope to win a grace from thee.  Why should I leave the better, choose the worse?  That were sheer madness, and I am not mad.  No such ambition ever tempted me,  Nor would I have a share in such intrigue.  And if thou doubt me, first to Delphi go,  There ascertain if my report was true  Of the god's answer; next investigate  If with the seer I plotted or conspired,  And if it prove so, sentence me to death,  Not by thy voice alone, but mine and thine.  But O condemn me not, without appeal,  On bare suspicion.  'Tis not right to adjudge  Bad men at random good, or good men bad.  I would as lief a man should cast away  The thing he counts most precious, his own life,  As spurn a true friend.  Thou wilt learn in time  The truth, for time alone reveals the just;  A villain is detected in a day.    CHORUS  To one who walketh warily his words  Commend themselves; swift counsels are not sure.    OEDIPUS  When with swift strides the stealthy plotter stalks  I must be quick too with my counterplot.  To wait his onset passively, for him  Is sure success, for me assured defeat.    CREON  What then's thy will?  To banish me the land?    OEDIPUS  I would not have thee banished, no, but dead,  That men may mark the wages envy reaps.    CREON  I see thou wilt not yield, nor credit me.    OEDIPUS  [None but a fool would credit such as thou.] [3]    CREON  Thou art not wise.    OEDIPUS                      Wise for myself at least.    CREON  Why not for me too?    OEDIPUS                      Why for such a knave?    CREON  Suppose thou lackest sense.    OEDIPUS                                Yet kings must rule.    CREON  Not if they rule ill.    OEDIPUS                           Oh my Thebans, hear him!    CREON  Thy Thebans? am not I a Theban too?    CHORUS  Cease, princes; lo there comes, and none too soon,  Jocasta from the palace.  Who so fit  As peacemaker to reconcile your feud?  [Enter JOCASTA.]    JOCASTA  Misguided princes, why have ye upraised  This wordy wrangle?  Are ye not ashamed,  While the whole land lies striken, thus to voice  Your private injuries?  Go in, my lord;  Go home, my brother, and forebear to make  A public scandal of a petty grief.    CREON  My royal sister, Oedipus, thy lord,  Hath bid me choose (O dread alternative!)  An outlaw's exile or a felon's death.    OEDIPUS  Yes, lady; I have caught him practicing  Against my royal person his vile arts.    CREON  May I ne'er speed but die accursed, if I  In any way am guilty of this charge.    JOCASTA  Believe him, I adjure thee, Oedipus,  First for his solemn oath's sake, then for mine,  And for thine elders' sake who wait on thee.    CHORUS  (Str. 1)  Hearken, King, reflect, we pray thee, but not stubborn but relent.    OEDIPUS  Say to what should I consent?    CHORUS  Respect a man whose probity and troth  Are known to all and now confirmed by oath.    OEDIPUS  Dost know what grace thou cravest?    CHORUS                                     Yea, I know.    OEDIPUS  Declare it then and make thy meaning plain.    CHORUS  Brand not a friend whom babbling tongues assail;  Let not suspicion 'gainst his oath prevail.    OEDIPUS  Bethink you that in seeking this ye seek  In very sooth my death or banishment?    CHORUS  No, by the leader of the host divine!  (Str. 2)  Witness, thou Sun, such thought was never mine,  Unblest, unfriended may I perish,  If ever I such wish did cherish!  But O my heart is desolate  Musing on our striken State,  Doubly fall'n should discord grow  Twixt you twain, to crown our woe.    OEDIPUS  Well, let him go, no matter what it cost me,  Or certain death or shameful banishment,  For your sake I relent, not his; and him,  Where'er he be, my heart shall still abhor.    CREON  Thou art as sullen in thy yielding mood  As in thine anger thou wast truculent.  Such tempers justly plague themselves the most.    OEDIPUS  Leave me in peace and get thee gone.    CREON                                     I go,  By thee misjudged, but justified by these.  [Exeunt CREON]    CHORUS  (Ant. 1)  Lady, lead indoors thy consort; wherefore longer here delay?    JOCASTA  Tell me first how rose the fray.    CHORUS  Rumors bred unjust suspicious and injustice rankles sore.    JOCASTA  Were both at fault?    CHORUS                      Both.    JOCASTA                           What was the tale?    CHORUS  Ask me no more.  The land is sore distressed;  'Twere better sleeping ills to leave at rest.    OEDIPUS  Strange counsel, friend!  I know thou mean'st me well,  And yet would'st mitigate and blunt my zeal.    CHORUS  (Ant. 2)  King, I say it once again,  Witless were I proved, insane,  If I lightly put away  Thee my country's prop and stay,  Pilot who, in danger sought,  To a quiet haven brought  Our distracted State; and now  Who can guide us right but thou?    JOCASTA  Let me too, I adjure thee, know, O king,  What cause has stirred this unrelenting wrath.    OEDIPUS  I will, for thou art more to me than these.  Lady, the cause is Creon and his plots.    JOCASTA  But what provoked the quarrel? make this clear.    OEDIPUS  He points me out as Laius' murderer.    JOCASTA  Of his own knowledge or upon report?    OEDIPUS  He is too cunning to commit himself,  And makes a mouthpiece of a knavish seer.    JOCASTA  Then thou mayest ease thy conscience on that score.  Listen and I'll convince thee that no man  Hath scot or lot in the prophetic art.  Here is the proof in brief.  An oracle  Once came to Laius (I will not say  'Twas from the Delphic god himself, but from  His ministers) declaring he was doomed  To perish by the hand of his own son,  A child that should be born to him by me.  Now Laius--so at least report affirmed--  Was murdered on a day by highwaymen,  No natives, at a spot where three roads meet.  As for the child, it was but three days old,  When Laius, its ankles pierced and pinned  Together, gave it to be cast away  By others on the trackless mountain side.  So then Apollo brought it not to pass  The child should be his father's murderer,  Or the dread terror find accomplishment,  And Laius be slain by his own son.  Such was the prophet's horoscope.  O king,  Regard it not.  Whate'er the god deems fit  To search, himself unaided will reveal.    OEDIPUS  What memories, what wild tumult of the soul  Came o'er me, lady, as I heard thee speak!    JOCASTA  What mean'st thou?  What has shocked and startled thee?    OEDIPUS  Methought I heard thee say that Laius  Was murdered at the meeting of three roads.    JOCASTA  So ran the story that is current still.    OEDIPUS  Where did this happen?  Dost thou know the place?    JOCASTA  Phocis the land is called; the spot is where  Branch roads from Delphi and from Daulis meet.    OEDIPUS  And how long is it since these things befell?    JOCASTA  'Twas but a brief while were thou wast proclaimed  Our country's ruler that the news was brought.    OEDIPUS  O Zeus, what hast thou willed to do with me!    JOCASTA  What is it, Oedipus, that moves thee so?    OEDIPUS  Ask me not yet; tell me the build and height  Of Laius?  Was he still in manhood's prime?    JOCASTA  Tall was he, and his hair was lightly strewn  With silver; and not unlike thee in form.    OEDIPUS  O woe is me!  Mehtinks unwittingly  I laid but now a dread curse on myself.    JOCASTA  What say'st thou?  When I look upon thee, my king,  I tremble.    OEDIPUS            'Tis a dread presentiment  That in the end the seer will prove not blind.  One further question to resolve my doubt.    JOCASTA  I quail; but ask, and I will answer all.    OEDIPUS  Had he but few attendants or a train  Of armed retainers with him, like a prince?    JOCASTA  They were but five in all, and one of them  A herald; Laius in a mule-car rode.    OEDIPUS  Alas! 'tis clear as noonday now.  But say,  Lady, who carried this report to Thebes?    JOCASTA  A serf, the sole survivor who returned.    OEDIPUS  Haply he is at hand or in the house?    JOCASTA  No, for as soon as he returned and found  Thee reigning in the stead of Laius slain,  He clasped my hand and supplicated me  To send him to the alps and pastures, where  He might be farthest from the sight of Thebes.  And so I sent him.  'Twas an honest slave  And well deserved some better recompense.    OEDIPUS  Fetch him at once.  I fain would see the man.    JOCASTA  He shall be brought; but wherefore summon him?    OEDIPUS  Lady, I fear my tongue has overrun  Discretion; therefore I would question him.    JOCASTA  Well, he shall come, but may not I too claim  To share the burden of thy heart, my king?    OEDIPUS  And thou shalt not be frustrate of thy wish.  Now my imaginings have gone so far.  Who has a higher claim that thou to hear  My tale of dire adventures?  Listen then.  My sire was Polybus of Corinth, and  My mother Merope, a Dorian;  And I was held the foremost citizen,  Till a strange thing befell me, strange indeed,  Yet scarce deserving all the heat it stirred.  A roisterer at some banquet, flown with wine,  Shouted \"Thou art not true son of thy sire.\"  It irked me, but I stomached for the nonce  The insult; on the morrow I sought out  My mother and my"]]]
