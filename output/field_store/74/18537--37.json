The Government boats had  left them rations. There was an air of thrift, even in their desolation,  a plank walk was laid about the door, the floor was cleanly swept, and  the twenty-five surviving hens, for an equal number were lost in the  storm, clucked and craiked comfortably about the door, and there were  two-and-a-half dozen fresh eggs to sell us at a higher rate than paid in  town. We stood, as we had done so many scores of times during the last  few weeks, and looked this pitiful scene in the face. There were  misfortune, poverty, sorrow, want, loneliness, dread of the future, but  fortitude, courage, integrity, and honest thrift.    \"Would she like to return to the childhood home in Indiana?\" we asked  the mother, for we would help them go.    \"No,\" she said tenderly. \"My husband lived and died here. He is buried  here, and I would not like to go away and leave him alone. It won't be  very long, and it is a comfort to the children to be able to visit his  grave. No, I reckon we will stay here, and out of the wreck of the old  house which sticks up out of the mud, we will put up another little  hut, higher up on the bank out of the way of the floods, and if it is  only a hut, it will be a home for us and we will get into it, and make  our crop this year.\"    There were no dry eyes, but very still hearts, while we listened to this  sorrowful but brave little speech, made with a voice full of tears.    Our thoughtful field agent, Dr. Hubbell, was the first to speak.    \"Here are six children,\" he said with an inquiring glance at me.    No response was needed. The thing was done. We told the mother the story  of \"The Little Six\" of Waterford, and asked her if that money with  enough more to make up one hundred dollars would help her to get up her  house? It was _her_ turn to be speechless. At length with a struggling,  choking voice she managed to say--\"God knows how much it would be to me.  Yes, with my good boys I can do it, and do it well.\"    We put in her hands a check for this sum, and directed from the boat  clean boxes of clothing and bedding, to help restore the household, when  the house should have been completed.    Before we left her, we asked if she would name her house when it should  be done? She thought a second, and caught the idea.    \"Yes,\" she replied quickly, with a really winsome smile on that worn and  weary face, \"yes, I shall name it 'The Little Six.'\"    We came to Pittsburg, discharged our empty boat, bade a heart-breaking  good-by to our veteran volunteers from Evansville, who had shared our  toil and pain and who would return on the boat, we taking train once  more for Washington. We had been four months on the rivers, among fogs,  rain, damp, and malaria--run all manner of risks and dangers, but had  lost no life nor property, sunk no boat, and only that I was by this  time too weak to walk without help--all were well.    Through the thoughtfulness of our new societies--St. Louis and  Chicago--we had been able to meet our share of the expenses, and to keep  good the little personal provision we started with, and were thus ready  to commence another field when it should come.    On arriving home I found that I was notified by the International  Committee of Geneva, that the Fourth International Conference would be  held in that city in September, and I was requested to inform the  United States Government, and ask it to send delegates. With the aid of  a borrowed arm, I made my way up the steps of the Department of State  (that was before the luxury of elevators) and made my errand known to  Secretary Frelinghuysen, who had heard of it and was ready with his  reply:    \"Yes, Miss Barton, we will make the needful appointment of delegates to  the International Conference, and I appoint you as our delegate.\"    \"No, Mr. Frelinghuysen,\" I said, \"I can not go. I have just returned  from field work. I am tired and ill. Furthermore, I have not had time to  make a report of our work.\"    \"There is no one else who sufficiently understands the Red Cross, and  the provisions of the treaty, that our Government can send, and we can  not afford to make a mistake in the matter of delegates to this first  conference in which our Government shall participate,\" answered the  Secretary. \"As to the report, have you not acknowledged the  contributions to all those who have sent?\"    \"Oh, yes; every dollar and every box of goods where the donor was  known,\" I replied.    \"Has any one complained?\" he asked.    \"No; not a single person so far as is known. We have had only thanks.\"    \"Then to whom would you report?\"    \"To you, Mr. Secretary, or to such person or in such manner as you shall  designate.\"    \"I don't want any report; no report is necessary,\" answered the  Secretary. \"Our Government relief-boats have reported you officially,  and all the country knows what you have done and is more than satisfied.  Regarding your illness--you have had too much fresh water, Miss Barton,  I recommend salt--and shall appoint you.\"    This was done, and the appropriation for expenses was made, and at my  request Judge Joseph Sheldon, and by invitation Mr. A. S. Solomon, our  vice-president, were also appointed to accompany me. The appropriation  sufficed for all.    The conference was held at Geneva, September 17, 1884, and thus was had  the first official representation of the United States Government at an  International Conference of the Treaty of Geneva. There have since been  five. I have attended all but one.          II    THE TEXAS FAMINE AND THE MT. VERNON CYCLONE      Before the close of the following year, 1885, came what was known as the  \"Texas Famine.\" Thousands of miles of wild land, forming the Pan Handle,  had been suddenly opened by the building of a Southern Railroad. In the  speculative anxiety of the Road to people its newly acquired territory,  unwarranted inducements of climatic advantages had been unscrupulously  held out to the poor farmers of Mississippi, Alabama, and Georgia.    Lured by the pictures presented them, some thousands of families had  been induced to leave their old, worn-out farms, and with the little  they could carry or drive, reach the new Eldorado, to find a new farm  that needed only the planting to make them rich, prosperous, and happy,  without labor. They planted. The first year brought some returns--the  second was a drought with no returns--the third the same. Hunger for  themselves and starvation for their stock stared them in the face. They  could not pick up and go back--the rivers were dry from the Rio Grande  to the Brazos--the earth was iron, and the heavens brass; cattle  wandered at will for water and feed, and their bones whitened the  plains.    These were poor little peoples. They tried to make the great State know  of their distress, but the rich railroad proprietors held the _press_,  and no one knew their condition or could get correct information. At  length a faithful clergyman came to Washington, to President Cleveland,  and the Red Cross.    We consulted with the President, who gave encouragement for us to go to  Texas and learn the facts.    In mid-winter, 1886, accompanied by Dr. Hubbell, the journey was  undertaken. We proceeded to Albany, Texas, made headquarters--traveled  over the stricken counties, found wretchedness, hunger, thirst, cold,  heart-breaking discouragement. The third year of drought was upon them,  and the good people of that great State, misled by its press, its press  in turn misled by the speculators, innocently discredited every report  of distress, and amused themselves by little sly innuendoes and witty  jokes on the \"Texas Famine.\"    The condition was pitiful. To them it was hopeless. And yet not a dollar  or a pound was needed outside of Texas. They only required to know the  truth. This then was our task. We ceased to journey over arid fields of  suffering, and turned our steps resolutely to the editorial rooms of the  Dallas and Galveston News, at Dallas. Both editors were present; both  sat half-breathless while the flood of information rolled over them in  no uncertain terms.    I shall never forget the tears in the mild blue eyes of General Belo, as  he learned what he had done, and was still doing. Twelve hours brought  another issue of the two papers. A column of editorial told the true  situation. A modest contribution of the Red Cross headed a subscription  list, General Belo following with his, and almost immediately the  legislature made an appropriation of one hundred thousand dollars for  food and supplies.    The tender-hearted and conscience-smitten people sent their donations.  Our task was done. We had seen and conquered.    In the midst of a cold rain in February we reached Washington. A concise  and full report was made to President Cleveland, saying in conclusion:  \"I thank you with all my heart, Mr. President, for the encouragement at  the commencement, and for the privilege of writing you. We have done  this little bit of work faithfully and hope it may meet your approval.\"    President Cleveland's letter of thanks still bears testimony of his care  for the people of the country, and his faith in its institutions.    Not a dollar of outside help passed through our hands, but the little  permanent provision was equal to the occasion and we had still a half  left of our three thousand dollars. That was our first acquaintance with  Texas. Galveston followed many years later with the same firm accord and  good results. The bonds of affection had grown deep and strong between  the great thousand-mile State and the little Red Cross that loved to  serve her.    In the following year, 1887, we were notified by the International  Committee of Geneva of the conference to be held at Carlsruhe, by  invitation of the Grand Duke and Grand Duchess of Baden. We were  directed to inform the Department of State of this fact. We did so, and  an"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30249"],[0,"Ways of Nature (#4)"],[1,"tail are constantly changing place.  What does it mean? Is it fear? Is it a real fit? I do not know, but  any one of our romance-naturalists could tell you at once. I can only  suggest that it may be a ruse to baffle its enemy, the black snake,  when he would attempt to crush it in his folds, or to seize its head  when he would swallow it.    I am reminded of another mystery connected with a snake, or a  snake-skin, and a bird. Why does our great crested flycatcher weave a  snake-skin into its nest, or, in lieu of that, something that suggests  a snake-skin, such as an onion-skin, or fish-scales, or a bit of oiled  paper? It is thought by some persons that it uses the snake-skin as a  kind of scarecrow, to frighten away its natural enemies. But think  what this purpose in the use of it would imply. It would imply that  the bird knew that there were among its enemies creatures that were  afraid of snakes--so afraid of them that one of their faded and  cast-off skins would keep these enemies away. How could the bird  obtain this knowledge? It is not afraid of the skin itself; why should  it infer that squirrels, for instance, are? I am convinced there is  nothing in this notion. In all the nests that have come under my  observation, the snake-skin was in faded fragments woven into the  texture of the nest, and one would not be aware of its presence unless  he pulled the nest to pieces. True, Mr. Frank Bolles reports finding a  nest of this bird with a whole snake-skin coiled around a single egg;  but it was the skin of a small garter-snake, six or seven inches long,  and could not therefore have inspired much terror in the heart of the  bird's natural enemies. Dallas Lore Sharp, author of that delightful  book, \"Wild Life Near Home,\" tells me he has seen a whole skin  dangling nearly its entire length from the hole that contained the  nest, just as he has seen strings hanging from the nest of the  kingbird. The bird was too hurried or too careless to pull in the  skin. Mr. Sharp adds that he cannot \"give the bird credit for  appreciating the attitude of the rest of the world toward snakes, and  making use of the fear.\" Moreover, a cast-off snake-skin looks very  little like a snake. It is thin, shrunken, faded, papery, and there is  no terror in it. Then, too, it is dark in the cavity of the nest,  consequently the skin could not serve as a scarecrow in any case.  Hence, whatever its purpose may be, it surely is not that. It looks  like a mere fancy or whim of the bird. There is that in its voice and  ways that suggests something a little uncanny. Its call is more like  the call of the toad than that of a bird. If the toad did not always  swallow its own cast-off skin, the bird would probably use that too.    At the best we can only guess at the motives of the birds and beasts.  As I have elsewhere said, they nearly all have reference in some way  to the self-preservation of these creatures. But how the bits of an  old snake-skin in a bird's nest can contribute specially to this end,  I cannot see.    Nature is not always consistent; she does not always choose the best  means to a given end. For instance, all the wrens except our house  wren seem to use about the best material at hand for their nests. What  can be more unsuitable, untractable, for a nest in a hole or cavity  than the twigs the house wren uses? Dry grasses or bits of soft bark  would bend and adapt themselves easily to the exigencies of the case;  but stiff, unyielding twigs! What a contrast to the suitableness of  the material the hummingbird uses--the down of some plant, which seems  to have a poetic fitness!    Yesterday in my walk I saw where a red squirrel had stripped the soft  outer bark off a group of red cedars to build its winter's nest with.  This also seemed fit,--fit that such a creature of the trees should  not go to the ground for its nest-material, and should choose  something soft and pliable. Among the birches, it probably gathers the  fine curling shreds of the birch bark.    Beside my path in the woods a downy woodpecker, late one fall, drilled  a hole in the top of a small dead black birch for his winter quarters.  My attention was first called to his doings by the white chips upon  the ground. Every day as I passed I would rap upon his tree, and if he  was in he would appear at his door and ask plainly enough what I  wanted now. One day when I rapped, something else appeared at the  door--I could not make out what. I continued my rapping, when out came  two flying-squirrels. On the tree being given a vigorous shake, it  broke off at the hole, and the squirrels went sliding down the air to  the foot of a hemlock, up which they disappeared. They had  dispossessed Downy of his house, had carried in some grass and leaves  for a nest, and were as snug as a bug in a rug. Downy drilled another  cell in a dead oak farther up the hill, and, I hope, passed the winter  there unmolested. Such incidents, comic or tragic, as they chance to  strike us, are happening all about us, if we have eyes to see them.    The next season, near sundown of a late November day, I saw Downy  trying to get possession of a hole not his own. I chanced to be  passing under a maple, when white chips upon the ground again caused  me to scrutinize the branches overhead. Just then I saw Downy come to  the tree, and, hopping around on the under side of a large dry limb,  begin to make passes at something with his beak. Presently I made out  a round hole there, with something in it returning Downy's thrusts.  The sparring continued some moments. Downy would hop away a few feet,  then return to the attack, each time to be met by the occupant of the  hole. I suspected an English sparrow had taken possession of Downy's  cell in his absence during the day, but I was wrong. Downy flew to  another branch, and I tossed up a stone against the one that contained  the hole, when, with a sharp, steely note, out came a hairy woodpecker  and alighted on a near-by branch. Downy, then, had the \"cheek\" to try  to turn his large rival out of doors--and it was Hairy's cell, too;  one could see that by the size of the entrance. Thus loosely does the  rule of _meum_ and _tuum_ obtain in the woods. There is no moral code  in nature. Might reads right. Man in communities has evolved ethical  standards of conduct, but nations, in their dealings with one another,  are still largely in a state of savage nature, and seek to establish  the right, as dogs do, by the appeal to battle.    One season a wood duck laid her eggs in a cavity in the top of a tall  yellow birch near the spring that supplies my cabin with water. A bold  climber \"shinned\" up the fifty or sixty feet of rough tree-trunk and  looked in upon the eleven eggs. They were beyond the reach of his arm,  in a well-like cavity over three feet deep. How would the mother duck  get her young up out of that well and down to the ground? We watched,  hoping to see her in the act. But we did not. She may have done it at  night or very early in the morning. All we know is that when Amasa one  morning passed that way, there sat eleven little tufts of black and  yellow down in the spring, with the mother duck near by. It was a  pretty sight. The feat of getting down from the tree-top cradle had  been safely effected, probably by the young clambering up on the  inside walls of the cavity and then tumbling out into the air and  coming down gently like huge snowflakes. They are mostly down, and why  should they not fall without any danger to life or limb? The notion  that the mother duck takes the young one by one in her beak and  carries them to the creek is doubtless erroneous. Mr. William Brewster  once saw the golden-eye, whose habits of nesting are like those of the  wood duck, get its young from the nest to the water in this manner:  The mother bird alighted in the water under the nest, looked all  around to see that the coast was clear, and then gave a peculiar call.  Instantly the young shot out of the cavity that held them, as if the  tree had taken an emetic, and came softly down to the water beside  their mother. Another observer assures me that he once found a newly  hatched duckling hung by the neck in the fork of a bush under a tree  in which a brood of Wood ducks had been hatched.    The ways of nature,--who can map them, or fathom them, or interpret  them, or do much more than read a hint correctly here and there? Of  one thing we may be pretty certain, namely, that the ways of wild  nature may be studied in our human ways, inasmuch as the latter are an  evolution from the former, till we come to the ethical code, to  altruism and self-sacrifice. Here we seem to breathe another air,  though probably this code differs no more from the animal standards of  conduct than our physical atmosphere differs from that of early  geologic time.    Our moral code must in some way have been evolved from our rude animal  instincts. It came from within; its possibilities were all in nature.  If not, where were they?    I have seen disinterested acts among the birds, or what looked like  such, as when one bird feeds the young of another species when it  hears them crying for food. But that a bird would feed a grown bird of  another species, or even of its own, to keep it from starving, I have  my doubts. I am quite positive that mice will try to pull one of their  fellows out of a trap, but what the motive is, who shall say? Would  the same mice share their last crumb with their fellow if he were  starving? That, of course, would be a much nearer approach to the  human code, and is too much to expect. Bees will clear their fellows  of honey, but whether it be to help them, or to save the honey, is a  question.    In my youth I saw a parent weasel seize one of its nearly grown young  which I had wounded and carry it across an open barway, in spite of my  efforts to hinder it. A friend of mine, who is a careful observer,  says he once wounded "]]]
