There should be a rim on top part of the pan to  prevent it working lower down than the hole in the pail. Now get a  miner's lamp, which will not cost more than from fifteen to  twenty-five cents. Coal oil can be used but lard oil is much  better, and better than either of these is alcohol. A small lamp  suitable for burning this can be purchased at a small cost.    Now you are ready to start out. Take some refuse honey and your  bottle of bait, get far out on the mountains, so there will be  little danger of drawing bees from apiaries that may be situated in  the valleys. When a suitable place is found, clear of underbrush  and no large trees to bother the bees when starting for home, set  pail down, put some of the honey in the upper part of the pail (or  pan), strike a match, touch it to the wick of the lamp. The spout  of the lamp should come within about two inches of the bottom of  the pan. The honey begins to boil immediately and sends its scent  out over the mountains. A few drops of the oil of anise and  bergamont mixed can be dropped into the pan, and a bunch of bushes  held over the fumes until it is scented. This is then laid on the  top of a bush or stump close by and sprinkled with bait. By this  time bees may be heard darting through the air or seen hunting  slowly through the bushes in search of something to eat. It is a  very good plan to blow the lamp out when the first bees are flying  around. The scent is strong all around and when the lamp is blown  out the scent soon dies out except near the bait and the bees find  the bait much sooner than if the lamp was kept burning. There may  be plenty of bees to start with from the first burning and if not,  all we have to do is to light the lamp again.    If you have your course and are about to start, it only requires a  second of time to pick up the burning apparatus and the bunch of  bushes and start on the course. But for fear you may be only a  beginner and make a mistake which might discourage you, I want to  have a little talk with you before starting from the first  location.    In reading articles relating to bee hunting, some of the writers  tell how, after loading up, the bees would circle round and round  before starting on the homeward journey. I believe I have seen a  few bees make a complete circle. I have seen hundreds of thousands  that did not. As a rule when a bee raises from the bait it will act  as though it intends to circle, but watch closely and you find  before coming around to the place of starting it will quickly turn  in the opposite direction, repeating this several times--always  widening out. It will seem to fall far back with a downward motion,  then gather up and come slowly back, often passing to the opposite  side of the bait and making a sudden motion, is lost to sight. This  fact might make you think the bee really went in this direction. I  want to stake my reputation as a bee hunter of years of experience,  that when a bee is seen to make these half circles on one side of  the bait and seem to fall off in any direction, bearing down toward  the earth, that this is the general direction in which the tree  stands, and if I can see a bee make a few of these half circles  (though it may be the first one on the bait), it settles the matter  in my mind as to the general direction of the tree. But even if our  minds are made up in regard to this line of flight, it is wise to  take more time and watch closely, for there is no good reason why  we should not get two or possibly more courses from this first  location. Then go on the strongest course until we find the tree  and then come back and start on the others.    In going on the course don't fail to look well at every tree, for  sometimes they are found in very small trees when there are lots of  large ones standing all around.    I will give my experience in finding a bee that has taught me to  look at every thing on the course, not even discarded stumps, logs  and bushes, for I have found bees in the two former and hanging on  the latter. In early November I had a strong course from bait. They  flew directly up on the side of the mountain. The course flew over  a large barren thicket and after looking at the timber on the lower  edge of the barrens, the bait was moved across the thicket. There  were a few chestnut trees standing between the upper edge and the  place I selected to bait them again. Soon they came and flew back  down. I was sure they must be in one of the trees mentioned, for  there was nothing growing in the thicket large enough for a bee to  go in. After looking at the few trees spoken of and not finding  them, I went back down to the lower edge and could see them fly  nearly half way across the thicket. I was puzzled, and proceeded to  look at the few logs that were laying down and still failed to  locate them. My next move was to hang my burning bucket on a limb  and burn. In no time there were bees by the quart on the bait,  flying in all directions. Singling out some of the steady flying  ones, they seemed to fly a short distance, and drop into the brush.  On investigating, I found them hanging on a little bush, working  away as though they had the best place in the world to store their  honey. They had evidently been there for a long time as they had  several good sized combs fastened to the bush. I knew they were  bound to perish, for cold weather was coming on, so I told a friend  where to find it, and gave it to him with the understanding that he  was to hive it, putting the combs and brood in the hive.    The above is mentioned to prove that bees are sometimes found in  places out of the ordinary, and in closing this part of my work I  want to impress you with the fact that it always pays to go slow  and look well while on the course.    * * *    NOTE--If not convenient and a vessel of the kind described (for  burning) cannot be had, any small tin pail will do without cutting  out the hole for lamp. A couple of stones laid on the ground a few  inches apart will make a place for the lamp and the bucket placed  over it on the stones, although the first mentioned will be found  more convenient.        CHAPTER VIII.    SOME FACTS ABOUT LINE OF FLIGHT.    You have all heard the term \"bee line\" used, and naturally infer  that it means a straight line. This was what I believed it to be in  my earlier days, but from numerous observations I am led to believe  that the terms \"bee line\" and \"straight line\" are in some cases  incompatible. If the line of flight is over ground unbroken by  hills and hollows, a bee will fly as straight home after loading up  as anything having wings can. But in following a course through a  wooded country, along the side of hills or mountains containing  ridges and deep hollows, the line of flight deviates far from a  straight line.    To illustrate and prove the above assertion, I will here give an  incident in connection with bee hunting that occurred not many  years ago, and which goes to prove that bees do not always fly in a  perfectly straight line. East of my home about one mile there is a  mountain extending north and south. Along the foot of this  mountain, a stream, known as Sideling Hill creek, runs the entire  length of the valley. The mountain extending up from this creek is  made up of ridges and hollows. A friend of mine, one day in July,  found bees watering along the creek and nearly east of my home. The  bees flew south with the creek along the foot of the mountain.  After trying to find them, (consuming two days' time in the  attempt), he came for me to help him out, telling me that he had  looked at every tree near the course for a distance of a mile. It  was a very finely marked Italian bee, and being anxious to find and  hive it, offered to pay me for my time whether we found the bee or  not. I asked him if he had baited them at the water. He said he had  tried but not a bee could be induced to take bait. My time being  limited just then, I told him I would get them to bait for him and  after this he certainly could find it himself. \"Oh, yes, that's all  I ask,\" he replied. Going with him, I used the method described in  an early chapter entitled \"Hunting the Bee from Water.\" In a short  space of time I had lots of them loading up and flying south along  the creek. About a half mile on the course an old clearing ran up  some distance on a ridge, and the course seemed to go about midway  through it. My instructions were to put the bait on this place, as  it was clear of all bushes that might bother him from getting a  direct course, and after giving all necessary instruction I went  home and awaited results. The next evening he told me he had gone  into the old field and, as the bees were a little slow in coming to  the bait, he built a fire and proceeded to burn and got bees in  abundance, still flying on the same course; then moving the bait  much farther on the course to another old field, found that they  continued on the same line of flight; and from this last location  followed them in sight of a house, the owner having thirty stands  of bees, thus convincing him that the bees all had come from this  apiary.    But I was convinced he had overlooked the bees started with, for  these reasons: This apiary was two miles from where the bees  watered; the same stream flowed near by the apiary--there were many  springs near and water in abundance all along the course. Then the  clearing first mentioned had lots of sumac growing in it; many bees  from the apiary were working on this and other flowers, and by  burning, these bees were enticed to the bait in such numbers that  the few that may have been on bait from the tree were not noticed  by an inexperienced hunter. After telling him of my suspicions, he  was the more anxious that I should go along with him again and see  for myself that there was no wild bee on"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34063"],[0,"Fifty Years a Hunter and Trapper (#4)"],[1,"from its usual corner in the kitchen  and hung up over the mantle piece above the big fire place and well  out of my reach. This did not stop my hunting. We had a neighbor who  had two or three guns and he would lend me one of them. I would hide  away hen eggs and take them to the grocery and trade them for powder  and shot. Of course the man who owned the gun got the game, when I  chanced to kill any, for I did not dare to carry it home. It was not  long until father found that I was borrowing Mr. Abbott's gun, and he  thought that if hunt I would, it would be better that I use our own  and then he would know when I was out with it. He took the old  flintlock to the gunsmith and had it fixed over into a cap lock, and  now I was rigged out with both gun and traps.    I will now tell you about the first bear that I killed. I was about  thirteen years old, and it was not so common a thing for one to kill  a bear in those days as it is now (1904), for strange as it may seem,  bears are far more plentiful here today than they were at that time.    Two of my brothers and three or four of the neighbors went into the  woods about twelve miles and bought fifty acres of land. There was no  one living within six or seven miles of the place. They cleared off  four or five acres and built a good log fence around it. They also  built a small barn and cabin. Each spring they would drive their  young cattle out to this place, stay a few days and plant a few  potatoes, and some corn. About once a month it was customary to go  over to this clearing and hunt up the cattle and bring them to the  clearing and salt them, then have a day or two of trout fishing,  watch licks and kill a deer or two, jerk the meat and have a general  good time.    I was allowed to go on one of these expeditions, and the first night  the men watched one or two licks and one of the men killed a deer,  but I had to stay in camp that night with a promise that I should  watch the second night.    During the first night we heard wolves howl away upon the hills. The  next morning the men talked very mysteriously about the wolves and  said that it would not be safe to watch the licks that night, that no  deer would come to the licks as long as the wolves were around. I  took it all in and said nothing, but was determined to watch a lick  that night. Finally one of the men, John Duell by name, said that I  could watch the lick that he had and he would stay in camp. The one  that I was to watch was only a short distance from the clearing. When  the sun was about one-half hour high, I took the old shot gun, this  time loaded with genuine buck shot and climbed the Indian ladder to  the scaffold which was built about twenty feet from the ground in a  hemlock tree.    I sat quiet until sundown and no deer came. I thought I would tie the  gun in the notches in the limbs, which brought the gun in proper  range to kill the deer in the lick, should it come after dark. I got  one string tied around the barrel and the limb when a slight noise to  my left caused me to look in that direction and I saw a dark object  standing in the edge of the little thicket, which I took to be a  black creature I had seen down near the clearing when I came to the  lick. My thoughts were that I would tie the breech of the gun fast to  the limb, and then I would climb down and stone the animal away, so I  went on tying the gun fast. On looking up I saw that the supposedly  black heifer had turned out to be a black bear, and that it was going  to go above the lick and not into it. My knife was out in an instant  and the next moment I had the strings that held the gun cut. I raised  it carefully to my face and about this time the bear stopped, turned  his head around and looked back in the direction he had come. This  was my chance, and I fired both barrels at his head and shoulders,  and immediately there was a snorting, snarling, rolling and tumbling  of the bear, but the maneuvers of the bear was no comparison to the  screams and shouts that came from me. I was still making more noise  than a band of Indians when Mr. Duell arrived on the scene and took  in the situation. The other men who were watching other licks thought  I had surely been attacked by the wolves by the unearthly yell I was  making and the whole party were soon on the ground. The bear was soon  dressed and the men gave me the cognomen of the \"The Great Hunter of  Kentucky\" and so ended the killing of my first bear.    I am still in hopes to take the pelts from one or two this fall and  winter and later, I will tell of some of the incidents I have seen  and experienced while trapping and hunting among them. Perhaps, how a  brother of mine got a tenderfoot to ride the carcass of a deer down a  steep and hard frozen mountain when there was about two inches of  snow on would be interesting.        CHAPTER III.    My First Real Trapping Experience.    When I was about eighteen, I received a letter from a man by the name  of Harris, who lived in Steuben County, New York, wherein he stated  that a Mr. Lathrop had suggested me as a suitable party to go with  him to the region known as Black Forest. This section extends through  four counties, the southern part of Potter and Tioga counties, and  northern part of Clinton and Lycoming counties, Pa. Every reader  knows or has heard of the Black Forest region.    This section was and is still (1910) known as a good bear country. I  thought it strange that Mr. Lathrop, a man of much note as a hunter,  would recommend me, merely a boy, to go with Mr. Harris and into a  region like the Black Forest. As Mr. Lathrop lived about four miles  from our place I lost no time in going there to learn who this Mr.  Harris was. I was informed that he was an old hunter and trapper  about eighty years old and that he wanted a partner more for a  companion than a hunter or trapper. Mr. Lathrop had met Mr. Harris  while on a fishing tour on the Sinnamahoning waters during the summer  and said that he knew nothing of Mr. Harris otherwise than what he  saw of him at this meeting and to all appearances he was a fine old  gentleman. I showed the letter to father and asked what I should do  about it and he replied that he thought I could spend my time to a  better advantage in school, but he did not say that I could not go  with Mr. Harris. I therefore wrote him that I would be ready at the  time mentioned which was the twentieth of October.    Mr. Goodsil, the gunsmith in town, had been at work for some time on  a new gun for me. Now that I was going into the woods to hunt in  earnest, I was at the gun shop nearly every day, urging Mr. Goodsil  to finish my gun which he did and in plenty of time. After I got my  gun the days seemed like weeks and the weeks like months. I was  constantly in fear that Mr. Harris would not come. But promptly at  the time set, in the evening just before sundown, a man with a one  horse wagon loaded with bear traps and other traps of smaller size  and with one of the worst old rack-of-bones of a horse that I had  ever seen, drove up to father's place, stopped and inquired if Mr.  Woodcock lived there. I immediately asked if he was Mr. Harris, as I  had already guessed who the man was. He replied that he was and said  that he took it that I was the lad who was going with him.    Mr. Harris said that \"often an old horse and a colt\" worked well  together and that we would make a good team. While we were putting  his horses away I asked him what he intended to do with the old horse  and he replied that he brought him along so that if we got stuck he  could hitch him on and help out. The other horse was a fine horse and  I was at a loss to know what Mr. Harris meant.    During the evening I thought father and Mr. Harris talked on every  other subject rather than hunting but I managed to put in a few  questions now and again as to what we were to do when we arrived at  the great Black Forest.    Mr. Harris was a tall, broad-shouldered man with a long beard nearly  as white as snow. We were up early the next morning and on our way  before daylight. Our route was over the road known as the Jersey  Shore turnpike but after the first four miles we went through an  unbroken wilderness for twenty miles, save only one house, then known  as the Edcomb Place, now called Cherry Springs. The next place, ten  miles farther on, was a group of four or five shacks called Carter  Camp, but known now as Newbergen. This was in the year 1863 and the  conditions over this road are the same today only the large timber  has been mostly cut away and there is no one living at Cherry  Springs. Five miles farther on we came to Oleana, where there was a  hotel and store, owned by Henry Anderson, a Norwegian, who came to  this country as the private secretary of Ole Bull, the great  violinist, and it was here where the much talked of Ole Bull Castle  was built.    Beg pardon, I guess I am getting off the trap line. We stopped at the  hotel for the night and the next morning purchased supplies  sufficient to last during the entire campaign, consisting of lard,  pork, flour, corn meal, tea, coffee, rice, beans, sugar and the  necessary salt, pepper, etc. I remember well when Mr. Harris ordered  fifty pounds of beans and asked me if I thought that would do? I  replied that I thought it would. In my mind I wondered what we would  do with all those beans. But now I wish to say to the man going into  camp on a long hunting and trapping campaign, don't forget the beans  as they are bread and meat.    We are now within about ten or twelve miles of where we intended to  camp, which was at the junction of the Bailey and Nebo Branches of  Young Woman's Creek. It was about the middle of the afternoon of the  second day we were out and Mr. Harris said that here would be a good  place to build the camp. We got the horses out as soon as we could  and Mr. Harris picked out a large rock; one side had a straight,  smooth"]]]
