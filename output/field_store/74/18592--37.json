A long  series of sterile weeks lay behind us, and here at last there was a  fitting object for those remarkable powers which, like all special  gifts, become irksome to their owner when they are not in use. That  razor brain blunted and rusted with inaction.    Sherlock Holmes's eyes glistened, his pale cheeks took a warmer hue, and  his whole eager face shone with an inward light when the call for  work reached him. Leaning forward in the cab, he listened intently to  MacDonald's short sketch of the problem which awaited us in Sussex. The  inspector was himself dependent, as he explained to us, upon a scribbled  account forwarded to him by the milk train in the early hours of the  morning. White Mason, the local officer, was a personal friend, and  hence MacDonald had been notified much more promptly than is usual at  Scotland Yard when provincials need their assistance. It is a very cold  scent upon which the Metropolitan expert is generally asked to run.    \"DEAR INSPECTOR MACDONALD [said the letter which he read to us]:    \"Official requisition for your services is in separate envelope. This is  for your private eye. Wire me what train in the morning you can get for  Birlstone, and I will meet it--or have it met if I am too occupied. This  case is a snorter. Don't waste a moment in getting started. If you can  bring Mr. Holmes, please do so; for he will find something after his own  heart. We would think the whole had been fixed up for theatrical  effect if there wasn't a dead man in the middle of it. My word! it IS a  snorter.\"    \"Your friend seems to be no fool,\" remarked Holmes.    \"No, sir, White Mason is a very live man, if I am any judge.\"    \"Well, have you anything more?\"    \"Only that he will give us every detail when we meet.\"    \"Then how did you get at Mr. Douglas and the fact that he had been  horribly murdered?\"    \"That was in the inclosed official report. It didn't say 'horrible':  that's not a recognized official term. It gave the name John Douglas. It  mentioned that his injuries had been in the head, from the discharge of  a shotgun. It also mentioned the hour of the alarm, which was close on  to midnight last night. It added that the case was undoubtedly one of  murder, but that no arrest had been made, and that the case was one  which presented some very perplexing and extraordinary features. That's  absolutely all we have at present, Mr. Holmes.\"    \"Then, with your permission, we will leave it at that, Mr. Mac. The  temptation to form premature theories upon insufficient data is the bane  of our profession. I can see only two things for certain at present--a  great brain in London, and a dead man in Sussex. It's the chain between  that we are going to trace.\"          Chapter 3--The Tragedy of Birlstone        Now for a moment I will ask leave to remove my own insignificant  personality and to describe events which occurred before we arrived upon  the scene by the light of knowledge which came to us afterwards. Only in  this way can I make the reader appreciate the people concerned and the  strange setting in which their fate was cast.    The village of Birlstone is a small and very ancient cluster of  half-timbered cottages on the northern border of the county of Sussex.  For centuries it had remained unchanged; but within the last few years  its picturesque appearance and situation have attracted a number of  well-to-do residents, whose villas peep out from the woods around. These  woods are locally supposed to be the extreme fringe of the great Weald  forest, which thins away until it reaches the northern chalk downs.  A number of small shops have come into being to meet the wants of the  increased population; so there seems some prospect that Birlstone may  soon grow from an ancient village into a modern town. It is the centre  for a considerable area of country, since Tunbridge Wells, the nearest  place of importance, is ten or twelve miles to the eastward, over the  borders of Kent.    About half a mile from the town, standing in an old park famous for its  huge beech trees, is the ancient Manor House of Birlstone. Part of this  venerable building dates back to the time of the first crusade, when  Hugo de Capus built a fortalice in the centre of the estate, which had  been granted to him by the Red King. This was destroyed by fire in  1543, and some of its smoke-blackened corner stones were used when, in  Jacobean times, a brick country house rose upon the ruins of the feudal  castle.    The Manor House, with its many gables and its small diamond-paned  windows, was still much as the builder had left it in the early  seventeenth century. Of the double moats which had guarded its more  warlike predecessor, the outer had been allowed to dry up, and served  the humble function of a kitchen garden. The inner one was still there,  and lay forty feet in breadth, though now only a few feet in depth,  round the whole house. A small stream fed it and continued beyond it,  so that the sheet of water, though turbid, was never ditchlike or  unhealthy. The ground floor windows were within a foot of the surface of  the water.    The only approach to the house was over a drawbridge, the chains and  windlass of which had long been rusted and broken. The latest tenants  of the Manor House had, however, with characteristic energy, set this  right, and the drawbridge was not only capable of being raised, but  actually was raised every evening and lowered every morning. By thus  renewing the custom of the old feudal days the Manor House was converted  into an island during the night--a fact which had a very direct bearing  upon the mystery which was soon to engage the attention of all England.    The house had been untenanted for some years and was threatening to  moulder into a picturesque decay when the Douglases took possession of  it. This family consisted of only two individuals--John Douglas and his  wife. Douglas was a remarkable man, both in character and in person. In  age he may have been about fifty, with a strong-jawed, rugged face, a  grizzling moustache, peculiarly keen gray eyes, and a wiry, vigorous  figure which had lost nothing of the strength and activity of youth.  He was cheery and genial to all, but somewhat offhand in his manners,  giving the impression that he had seen life in social strata on some far  lower horizon than the county society of Sussex.    Yet, though looked at with some curiosity and reserve by his more  cultivated neighbours, he soon acquired a great popularity among the  villagers, subscribing handsomely to all local objects, and attending  their smoking concerts and other functions, where, having a remarkably  rich tenor voice, he was always ready to oblige with an excellent song.  He appeared to have plenty of money, which was said to have been gained  in the California gold fields, and it was clear from his own talk and  that of his wife that he had spent a part of his life in America.    The good impression which had been produced by his generosity and by  his democratic manners was increased by a reputation gained for utter  indifference to danger. Though a wretched rider, he turned out at every  meet, and took the most amazing falls in his determination to hold  his own with the best. When the vicarage caught fire he distinguished  himself also by the fearlessness with which he reentered the building  to save property, after the local fire brigade had given it up as  impossible. Thus it came about that John Douglas of the Manor House had  within five years won himself quite a reputation in Birlstone.    His wife, too, was popular with those who had made her acquaintance;  though, after the English fashion, the callers upon a stranger who  settled in the county without introductions were few and far between.  This mattered the less to her, as she was retiring by disposition, and  very much absorbed, to all appearance, in her husband and her domestic  duties. It was known that she was an English lady who had met Mr.  Douglas in London, he being at that time a widower. She was a beautiful  woman, tall, dark, and slender, some twenty years younger than her  husband; a disparity which seemed in no wise to mar the contentment of  their family life.    It was remarked sometimes, however, by those who knew them best, that  the confidence between the two did not appear to be complete, since the  wife was either very reticent about her husband's past life, or else, as  seemed more likely, was imperfectly informed about it. It had also been  noted and commented upon by a few observant people that there were signs  sometimes of some nerve-strain upon the part of Mrs. Douglas, and that  she would display acute uneasiness if her absent husband should ever  be particularly late in his return. On a quiet countryside, where all  gossip is welcome, this weakness of the lady of the Manor House did not  pass without remark, and it bulked larger upon people's memory when the  events arose which gave it a very special significance.    There was yet another individual whose residence under that roof was, it  is true, only an intermittent one, but whose presence at the time of  the strange happenings which will now be narrated brought his name  prominently before the public. This was Cecil James Barker, of Hales  Lodge, Hampstead.    Cecil Barker's tall, loose-jointed figure was a familiar one in the main  street of Birlstone village; for he was a frequent and welcome visitor  at the Manor House. He was the more noticed as being the only friend  of the past unknown life of Mr. Douglas who was ever seen in his new  English surroundings. Barker was himself an undoubted Englishman; but by  his remarks it was clear that he had first known Douglas in America and  had there lived on intimate terms with him. He appeared to be a man of  considerable wealth, and was reputed to be a bachelor.    In age he was rather younger than Douglas--forty-five at"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3291"],[0,"John Marshall and the Constitution, a Chronicle of the Supreme Court (#4)"],[1,"rson's concern went  deeper. \"They have retired into the judiciary as a stronghold,\" he wrote  Dickinson. \"There the remains of Federalism are to be preserved and fed  from the Treasury, and from that battery all the works of Republicanism  are to be beaten down and destroyed.\" The Federal Judiciary, as a  coordinate and independent branch of the Government, was confronted with  a fight for life!       * So called because the appointment of some of them was supposed  to have taken place as late as midnight, or later, of March 3-4, 1801.  The supposition, however, was without foundation.      Meanwhile, late in November, 1800, Ellsworth had resigned, and Adams  had begun casting about for his successor. First he turned to Jay, who  declined on the ground that the Court, \"under a system so defective,\"  would never \"obtain the energy, weight, and dignity which were essential  to its affording due support to the National Government, nor acquire the  public confidence and respect which, as the last resort of the justice  of the nation, it should possess.\" Adams now bethought himself of his  Secretary of State and, without previously consulting him, on January  20, 1801, sent his name to the Senate. A week later the Senate ratified  the nomination, and on the 4th of February Marshall accepted the  appointment. The task despaired of by Jay and abandoned by Ellsworth was  at last in capable hands.        CHAPTER II. Marshall's Early Years    John Marshall was born on September 24, 1755, in Fauquier County,  Virginia. Though like Jefferson he was descended on his mother's side  from the Randolphs of Turkey Island, colonial grandees who were also  progenitors of John Randolph, Edmund Randolph, and Robert E. Lee, his  father, Thomas Marshall, was \"a planter of narrow fortune\" and modest  lineage and a pioneer. Fauquier was then on the frontier, and a few  years after John was born the family moved still farther westward to a  place called \"The Hollow,\" a small depression on the eastern slope  of the Blue Ridge. The external furnishings of the boy's life were  extremely primitive, a fact which Marshall used later to recall by  relating that his mother and sisters used thorns for buttons and that  hot mush flavored with balm leaf was regarded as a very special dish.  Neighbors of course, were few and far between, but society was not  lacking for all that. As the first of fifteen children, all of whom  reached maturity, John found ample opportunity to cultivate that  affectionate helpfulness and gayety of spirit which in after years even  enemies accounted one of his most notable traits.    Among the various influences which, during the plastic years of boyhood  and youth, went to shape the outlook of the future Chief Justice high  rank must be accorded his pioneer life. It is not merely that the spirit  of the frontier, with its independence of precedent and its audacity  of initiative, breathes through his great constitutional decisions,  but also that in being of the frontier Marshall escaped being something  else. Had he been born in lowland Virginia, he would have imbibed the  intense localism and individualism of the great plantation, and with his  turn of mind might well have filled the role of Calhoun instead of that  very different role he actually did fill. There was, indeed, one great  planter with whom young Marshall was thrown into occasional contact, and  that was his father's patron and patron saint, Washington. The appeal  made to the lad's imagination by the great Virginian, was deep and  abiding. And it goes without saying that the horizons suggested by  the fame of Fort Venango and Fort Duquesne were not those of seaboard  Virginia but of America.    Many are the great men who have owed their debt to a mother's loving  helpfulness and alert understanding. Marshall, on the other hand, was  his father's child. \"My father,\" he was wont to declare in after years,  \"was a far abler man than any of his sons. To him I owe the solid  foundations of all my success in life.\" What were these solid  foundations? One was a superb physical constitution; another was a taste  for intellectual delights; and to the upbuilding of both these in his  son, Thomas Marshall devoted himself with enthusiasm and masculine good  sense, aided on the one hand by a very select library consisting of  Shakespeare, Milton, Dryden, and Pope, and on the other by the ever  fresh invitation of the mountainside to healthgiving sports.    Pope was the lad's especial textbook, and we are told that he had  transcribed the whole of the \"Essay on Man\" by the time he was twelve  and some of the \"Moral Essays\" as well, besides having \"committed to  memory many of the most interesting passages of that distinguished  poet.\" The result is to be partially discerned many years later in  certain tricks of Marshall's style; but indeed the influence of the  great moralist must have penetrated far deeper. The \"Essay on Man\"  filled, we may surmise, much the same place in the education of the  first generation of American judges that Herbert Spencer's \"Social  Statics\" filled in that of the judges of a later day. The \"Essay on Man\"  pictures the universe as a species of constitutional monarchy governed  \"not by partial but by general laws\"; in \"man's imperial race\" this  beneficent sway expresses itself in two principles, \"self-love to urge,  and reason to restrain\"; instructed by reason, self-love lies at the  basis of all human institutions, the state, government, laws, and has  \"found the private in the public good\"; so, on the whole, justice is the  inevitable law of life. \"Whatever is, is right.\" It is interesting to  suppose that while Marshall was committing to memory the complacent  lines of the \"Essay on Man,\" his cousin Jefferson may have been deep in  the \"Essay on the Origin of Inequality.\"    At the age of fourteen Marshall was placed for a few months under the  tuition of a clergyman named Campbell, who taught him the rudiments of  Latin and introduced him to Livy, Cicero, and Horace. A little later the  great debate over American rights burst forth and became with Marshall,  as with so many promising lads of the time, the decisive factor in  determining his intellectual bent, and he now began reading Blackstone.  The great British orators, however, whose eloquence had so much to do,  for instance, with shaping Webster's genius, came too late to influence  him greatly.    The part which the War of Independence had in shaping the ideas and the  destiny of John Marshall was most important. As the news of Lexington  and Bunker Hill passed the Potomac, he was among the first to spring to  arms. His services at the siege of Norfolk, the battles of Brandywine,  Germantown, and Monmouth, and his share in the rigors of Valley Forge  and in the capture of Stony Point, made him an American before he  had ever had time to become a Virginian. As he himself wrote long  afterwards: \"I had grown up at a time when the love of the Union and  the resistance to Great Britain were the inseparable inmates of the same  bosom;... when the maxim 'United we stand, divided we fall' was the  maxim of every orthodox American. And I had imbibed these sentiments so  thoroughly that they constituted a part of my being. I carried them with  me into the army, where I found myself associated with brave men from  different States, who were risking life and everything valuable in  a common cause believed by all to be most precious, and where I was  confirmed in the habit of considering America as my country and Congress  as my government.\"    Love of country, however, was not the only quality which soldiering  developed in Marshall. The cheerfulness and courage which illuminated  his patriotism brought him popularity among men. Though but a  lieutenant, he was presently made a deputy judge advocate. In this  position he displayed notable talent in adjusting differences between  officers and men and also became acquainted with Washington's brilliant  young secretary, Alexander Hamilton.    While still in active service in 1780, Marshall attended a course of law  lectures given by George Wythe at William and Mary College. He owed this  opportunity to Jefferson, who was then Governor of the State and who had  obtained the abolition of the chair of divinity at the college and the  introduction of a course in law and another in medicine. Whether  the future Chief Justice was prepared to take full advantage of the  opportunity thus offered is, however, a question. He had just fallen  heels over head in love with Mary Ambler, whom three years later he  married, and his notebook seems to show us that his thoughts were quite  as much upon his sweetheart as upon the lecturer's wisdom.    None the less, as soon as the Courts of Virginia reopened, upon the  capitulation of Cornwallis, Marshall hung out his shingle at Richmond  and began the practice of his profession. The new capital was still  hardly more than an outpost on the frontier, and conditions of living  were rude in the extreme. \"The Capitol itself,\" we are told, \"was an  ugly structure--'a mere wooden barn'--on an unlovely site at the foot  of a hill. The private dwellings scattered about were poor, mean, little  wooden houses.\" \"Main Street was still unpaved, deep with dust when dry  and so muddy during a rainy season that wagons sank up to the axles.\" It  ended in gullies and swamps. Trade, which was still in the hands of the  British merchants, involved for the most part transactions in skins,  furs, ginseng, snakeroot, and \"dried rattlesnakes--used to make a viper  broth for consumptive patients.\" \"There was but one church building and  attendance was scanty and infrequent.\" Not so, however, of Farmicola's  tavern, whither card playing, drinking, and ribaldry drew crowds,  especially when the legislature was in session. *       * Beveridge, vol. I, pp. 171-73.      But there was one institution of which Richmond could boast,"]]]
