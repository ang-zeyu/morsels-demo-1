Motor trucks are employed for many kinds of hauling where their speed  and consequently their daily capacity is an advantage over team  hauling that is decidedly worth while. It probably could be shown  that for many kinds of hauling, teams are more economical than motor  trucks, but when promptness and speed and the consequent effect on  dependent activities are considered, the motor truck often has a  distinct advantage, and the use of the truck to replace horse drawn  vans is progressing rapidly. This is true not only in the cities, but  also in the smaller towns and in the country. Motor trucks have been  adopted in a great many communities for delivery of farm products to  market, and this use of the truck is certain to increase rapidly. But  trucks in this service will use the secondary roads as well as the  main or primary roads.    These observations emphasize the extent to which the highway policy of  the nation must be predicated on the use of the highways by motor  vehicles.          CHAPTER II    HIGHWAY ADMINISTRATION      The systems of highway administration extant in the various political  units in the United States present a patchwork of overlapping  authority and undetermined responsibility. Highway laws are being  constantly revised by state legislatures and with each revision there  is some change in administrative methods and often the changes are  revolutionary in character. In most states, the trend is away from  county and township administration and toward state administration,  with provision for considerable participation by the federal  government.    It will be pertinent to consider briefly the present functions of each  of the administrative authorities having duties in connection with  highway work in the United States, although these duties vary greatly  in the several states and change periodically with the action of  legislatures.    =Township Administration.=--Township or \"Town\" authority is a survival  of the old New England town government and the town board consists of  three or more trustees who hold office for fixed terms. The usual term  is three years, but is less in some states. The incumbent is generally  a man who has other responsibilities of a public or private nature and  who gives but little of his time to highway matters. In some states  the pay is a fixed annual salary and in others a per diem with some  limitation on the amount that may be drawn in any one year, which  limitation may be statutory or may be by common consent.    The township highway commissioners or trustees have jurisdiction over  certain of the roads in the township, usually best described as all  roads not by law placed under the jurisdiction of some other  authority. In certain instances, the township authorities have charge  of all of the roads in the township, which would mean that no \"county\"  or \"state\" roads happened to be laid out in that township. It is a  matter of general observation that the trend of legislation is toward  removing from the jurisdiction of the township officials all roads  except those upon which the traffic is principally local in character.  The actual mileage of roads in the United States that is at present  administered by township officials is large, probably constituting not  less than seventy per cent of the total mileage.    In most states the township officials are responsible for the  maintenance of the roads under their jurisdiction and also supervise  such new construction as is undertaken. This includes the construction  of culverts and bridges as a rule, but in some states the county board  of supervisors is responsible for all of the bridge and culvert work  on the township roads. In other states, the township board is  responsible only for bridges or culverts that cost less than a certain  amount specified by law (usually about $1000) and the county board  provides for the construction and upkeep of the more expensive bridges  and culverts.    Funds for the work carried out by the township road officials are  obtained by general taxation, the amount that may be levied being  limited by statute and the actual levy being any amount up to the  maximum that the township board deems necessary for its purposes. It  is the general observation that the tax levy is usually the maximum  permitted by law.    In many states, township officials are permitted to issue bonds for  road construction, almost invariably, however, with the restriction  that each issue must be approved by the voters of the township. There  is always a provision that the total amount of bonds outstanding must  not exceed the constitutional limit in force in the state. In several  states, the townships have large amounts of road bonds outstanding.    =County Administration.=--In some states the county is the smallest  administrative unit in the road system. A county board, called the  board of county supervisors or board of county commissioners  consisting of from three to fifteen members, is the administrative  authority. Its members are elected for fixed terms which vary in  length from one to five years. The county board usually has many  public responsibilities other than highway administration, and is  generally made up of men with considerably more business ability than  the average township board.    The county board has jurisdiction over all of the highways in the  county in some states, and in others it has charge of only the more  important highways. In most states, the laws set forth specifically  what highways shall be under the jurisdiction of the county  authorities.    In addition to having direct supervision of the improvement and  maintenance of the roads assigned to county administration, the county  boards in some states arrange for the construction of all culverts and  bridges on the roads that are under township supervision, or at least  the more expensive bridges and culverts on such roads. Sometimes this  is accomplished by granting county aid for township bridges, under  which system the county pays a part of the cost of the construction of  bridges on the township roads. The amount of aid varies, but is  generally about one-half of the cost, and the township and county  officials jointly assume the responsibility of arranging for the  construction by contract or otherwise.    The county board obtains funds for road work through a direct tax on  all property in the county, the maximum rate being limited by statute.  County boards are also authorized to issue bonds for road construction  under statutory restrictions and limitations similar to those  effective in the township as to total amount issued, and many  millions of dollars' worth of highway bonds have been issued by  county authorities in the United States.    =State Administration.=--In a state, the administrative authority in  highway matters is vested in a board of commissioners usually  consisting of three or more members. In a few states, the  administrative authority is delegated to a single commissioner. Where  the authority is vested in a board, that board is usually appointed by  the governor. In several states one or more members of the commission  hold that position _ex officio_; for example, in several states the  governor is by law a member of the commission, in others the secretary  of state or the dean of engineering at the State University or the  state geologist is a member of the commission. Where the  administrative authority is a single commissioner he may be elected  along with other state officers, but this is the case in only a few  states.    The authority of the state highway department varies in the several  states, but in general the departments serve in the dual capacity of  general advisers to the county and township authorities on road  matters and as the executive authority responsible for the  construction of those highways that are built entirely or in part from  state or federal funds.    State highway departments consist of the commission or commissioner,  and the technical and clerical staff required to perform the duties  imposed on the state organization. To some extent the state highway  departments are able to encourage economical and correct construction  of highways by the township and county authorities by furnishing them  standard plans and specifications and by formulating regulations to  govern the character of construction, but such efforts are likely to  be more or less ineffective unless the state authority has supervision  of the allotment of state or federal funds to the various counties and  townships. Nevertheless, most state highway departments do a great  deal of advisory work in connection with the highway construction  carried out by county and township authorities.    State highway departments are supported by funds obtained in various  ways, laws differing greatly in this respect. The necessary support is  in some states appropriated from funds obtained by general taxation,  and is in others obtained from automobile license fees. In still  others, the funds are secured by a combination of the two methods  mentioned above. In addition to these support funds, a certain part of  the money obtained as federal aid may be employed for the engineering  and inspection costs on federal aid roads. The above mentioned funds  are required to maintain the state highway department. In addition,  the departments have supervision of the expenditures of construction  funds which can be used for road construction and maintenance, and may  not be expended for salaries or other overhead expense.    In a number of states, automobile license fees are set aside for  financing road construction and maintenance, and the work paid for  from the fees is carried out under the supervision of the state  highway department.    In a number of instances, state bonds have been issued for"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29444"],[0,"The Machinery of the Universe: Mechanical Conceptions of Physical Phenomena (#4)"],[1,"the water as steam does in the air, which shows that there  are some unoccupied spaces between the molecules. If a microscope be  employed to magnify a minute drop of water it still shows the same lack  of structure as that looked at with the unaided eye. If the magnifying  power be the highest it may reveal a speck as small as the  hundred-thousandth part of an inch, yet the speck looks no different in  character. We know that water is composed of two different kinds of  atoms, hydrogen and oxygen, for they can be separated by chemical means  and kept in separate bottles, and again made to combine to form water  having all the qualities that belonged to it before it was decomposed.  If a very much higher magnifying power were available, we should  ultimately be able to see the individual water molecules, and recognize  their hydrogen and oxygen constituents by their difference in size, rate  of movements, and we might possibly separate them by mechanical methods.  What one would see would be something very different in structure from  the water as it appears to our eyes. If the ether were similarly to be  examined through higher and still higher magnifying powers, even up to  infinity, there is no reason for thinking that the last examination  would show anything different in structure or quality from that which  was examined with low power or with no microscope at all. This is all  expressed by saying that the ether is a continuous substance, without  interstices, that it fills space completely, and, unlike gases,  liquids, and solids, is incapable of absorbing or dissolving anything.      2. MATTER IS LIMITED.    There appears to be a definite amount of matter in the visible universe,  a definite number of molecules and atoms. How many molecules there are  in a cubic inch of air under ordinary pressure has been determined, and  is represented approximately by a huge number, something like a thousand  million million millions.    When the diameter of a molecule has been measured, as it has been  approximately, and found to be about one fifty-millionth of an inch,  then fifty million in a row would reach an inch, and the cube of fifty  million is 125,000,000000,000000,000000, one hundred and twenty-five  thousand million million millions. In a cubic foot there will of course  be 1728 times that number. One may if one likes find how many there may  be in the earth, and moon, sun and planets, for the dimensions of them  are all very well known. Only the multiplication table need be used, and  the sum of all these will give how many molecules there are in the solar  system. If one should feel that the number thus obtained was not very  accurate, he might reflect that if there were ten times as many it would  add but another cipher to a long line of similar ones and would not  materially modify it. The point is that there is a definite, computable  number. If one will then add to these the number of molecules in the  more distant stars and nebulae, of which there are visible about  100,000,000, making such estimate of their individual size as he thinks  prudent, the sum of all will give the number of molecules in the visible  universe. The number is not so large but it can be written down in a  minute or two. Those who have been to the pains to do the sum say it may  be represented by seven followed by ninety-one ciphers. One could easily  compute how many molecules so large a space would contain if it were  full and as closely packed as they are in a drop of water, but there  would be a finite and not an infinite number, and therefore there is a  limited number of atoms in the visible universe.      THE ETHER IS UNLIMITED.    The evidence for this comes to us from the phenomena of light.  Experimentally, ether waves of all lengths are found to have a velocity  of 186,000 miles in a second. It takes about eight minutes to reach us  from the sun, four hours from Neptune the most distant planet, and from  the nearest fixed star about three and a half years. Astronomers tell us  that some visible stars are so distant that their light requires not  less than ten thousand years and probably more to reach us, though  travelling at the enormous rate of 186,000 miles a second. This means  that the whole of space is filled with this medium. If there were any  vacant spaces, the light would fail to get through them, and stars  beyond them would become invisible. There are no such vacant spaces, for  any part of the heavens shows stars beaming continuously, and every  increase in telescopic power shows stars still further removed than any  seen before. The whole of this intervening space must therefore be  filled with the ether. Some of the waves that reach us are not more than  the hundred-thousandth of an inch long, so there can be no crack or  break or absence of ether from so small a section as the  hundred-thousandth of an inch in all this great expanse. More than this.  No one can think that the remotest visible stars are upon the boundary  of space, that if one could get to the most distant star he would have  on one side the whole of space while the opposite side would be devoid  of it. Space we know is of three dimensions, and a straight line may be  prolonged in any direction to an infinite distance, and a ray of light  may travel on for an infinite time and come to no end provided space be  filled with ether.    How long the sun and stars have been shining no one knows, but it is  highly probable that the sun has existed for not less than 1000 million  years, and has during that time been pouring its rays as radiant energy  into space. If then in half that time, or 500 millions of years, the  light had somewhere reached a boundary to the ether, it could not have  gone beyond but would have been reflected back into the ether-filled  space, and such part of the sky would be lit up by this reflected light.  There is no indication that anything like reflection comes to us from  the sky. This is equivalent to saying that the ether fills space in  every direction away from us to an unlimited distance, and so far is  itself unlimited.      3. MATTER IS HETEROGENEOUS.    The various kinds of matter we are acquainted with are commonly called  the elements. These when combined in various ways exhibit characteristic  phenomena which depend upon the kinds of matter, the structure and  motions which are involved. There are some seventy different kinds of  this elemental matter which may be identified as constituents of the  earth. Many of the same elements have been identified in the sun and  stars, such for instance as hydrogen, carbon, and iron. Such phenomena  lead us to conclude that the kinds of matter elsewhere in the universe  are identical with such as we are familiar with, and that elsewhere the  variety is as great. The qualities of the elements, within a certain  range of temperature, are permanent; they are not subject to  fluctuations, though the qualities of combinations of them may vary  indefinitely. The elements therefore may be regarded as retaining their  identity in all ordinary experience.      THE ETHER IS HOMOGENEOUS.    One part of the ether is precisely like any other part everywhere and  always, and there are no such distinctions in it as correspond with the  elemental forms of matter.      4. MATTER IS ATOMIC.    There is an ultimate particle of each one of the elements which is  practically absolute and known as an atom. The atom retains its identity  through all combinations and processes. It may be here or there, move  fast or slow, but its atomic form persists.      THE ETHER IS NON-ATOMIC.    One might infer, from what has already been said about continuity, that  the ether could not be constituted of separable particles like masses of  matter; for no matter how minute they might be, there would be  interspaces and unoccupied spaces which would present us with phenomena  which have never been seen. It is the general consensus of opinion  among those who have studied the subject that the ether is not atomic in  structure.      5. MATTER HAS DEFINITE STRUCTURE.    Every atom of every element is so like every other atom of the same  element as to exhibit the same characteristics, size, weight, chemical  activity, vibratory rate, etc., and it is thus shown conclusively that  the structural form of the elemental particles is the same for each  element, for such characteristic reactions as they exhibit could hardly  be if they were mechanically unlike.    Of what form the atoms of an element may be is not very definitely  known. The earlier philosophers assumed them to be hard round particles,  but later thinkers have concluded that atoms of such a character are  highly improbable, for they could not exhibit in this case the  properties which the elements do exhibit. They have therefore dismissed  such a conception from consideration. In place of this hypothesis has  been substituted a very different idea, namely, that an atom is a  vortex-ring[1] of ether floating in the ether, as a smoke-ring puffed  out by a locomotive in still air may float in the air and show various  phenomena.    [Footnote 1: Vortex-rings for illustration may be made by having a  wooden box about a foot on a side, with a round orifice in the middle of  one side, and the side opposite covered with stout cloth stretched tight  over a framework. A saucer containing strong ammonia water, and another  containing strong hydrochloric acid, will cause dense fumes in the box,  and a tap with the hand upon the cloth back will force out a ring from  the orifice. These may be made to follow and strike each other,  rebounding and vibrating, apparently attracting each other and being  attracted by neighbouring bodies.    By filling the mouth with smoke, and pursing the lips as if to make the  sound _o_, one may make fifteen or twenty small rings by snapping the  cheek with the finger.]    A vortex-ring produced in the air behaves in"]]]
