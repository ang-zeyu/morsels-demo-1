Whereas Printers, Booksellers, and other  Persons, have of late frequently taken  the Liberty of Printing, Reprinting,  and Publishing, or causing to be Print-  ed, Reprinted, and Published Books,  and other Writings, without the Con-  sent of the Authors or Proprietors of  such Books and Writings, to their  very great Detriment, and too often  to the Ruin of them and their Fami-  lies: For Preventing therefore such  Practices for the future, and for the  Encouragement of Learned Men to Compose and Write use-  ful Books; May it please Your Majesty, that it may be En-  acted, and be it Enacted by the Queens most Excellent Majesty,  by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and  Temporal, and Commons in this present Parliament Assembled,  and by the Authority of the same, That from and after the  Tenth Day of April, One thousand seven hundred and ten, the  Author of any Book or Books already Printed, who hath not  Transferred to any other the Copy or Copies of such Book or  Books, Share or Shares thereof, or the Bookseller or Book-  sellers, Printer or Printers, or other Person or Persons, who  hath or have Purchased or Acquired the Copy or Copies of any  Book or Books, in order to Print or Reprint the same, shall  have the sole Right and Liberty of Printing such Book and  Books for the Term of One and twenty Years, to Commence  from the said Tenth Day of April, and no longer; and that  the Author of any Book or Books already Composed and not  Printed and Published, or that shall hereafter be Composed, and  his Assignee, or Assigns, shall have the sole Liberty of Printing  and Reprinting such Book and Books for the Term of four  -teen      page 2    teen Years, to Commence from the Day of the First Publish-  ing the same, and no longer; And that if any other Bookseller,  Printer, or other Person whatsoever, from and after the Tenth  Day of April, One thousand seven hundred and ten, within the  times Granted and Limited by this Act, as aforesaid, shall Print,  Reprint, or Import, or cause to be Printed, Reprinted, or Imported  any such Book or Books, without the Consent of the Proprietor or  Proprietors thereof first had and obtained in Writing, Signed  in the Presence of Two or more Credible Witnesses; or knowing  the same to be so Printed or Reprinted, without the Consent of  the Proprietors, shall Sell, Publish, or Expose to Sale, or cause  to be Sold, Published, or Exposed to Sale, any such Book or  Books, without such Consent first had and obtained, as afore-  said, Then such Offender or Offenders shall Forfeit such Book or  Books, and all and every Sheet or Sheets, being part of such  Book or Books, to the Proprietor or Proprietors of the Copy  thereof, who shall forthwith Damask and make Waste-Paper of  them: And further, That every such Offender or Offenders, shall  Forfeit One Peny [sic] for every sheet which shall be found in his,  her, or their Custody, either Printed or Printing, Published or  Exposed to Sale, contrary to the true intent and meaning of  this Act, the one Moiety thereof to the Queens [sic] most Excellent  Majesty, Her Heirs and Successors, and the other Moiety  thereof to any Person or Persons that shall Sue for the same,  to be Recovered in any of Her Majesties [sic] Courts of Record at  Westminster, by Action of Debt, Bill, Plaint, or Information,  in which no Wager of Law, Essoign, Privilege, or Protection,  or more than one Imparlance, shall be allowed.    And whereas many Persons may through Ignorance Offend  against this Act, unless some Provision be made whereby the Pro-  perty in every such Book, as is intended by this Act to be Se-  cured to the proprietor or Proprietors thereof, may be ascertain-  ed, as likewise the Consent of such Proprietor or Proprietors for the  Printing or Reprinting of such Book or Books may from time  to time be known; Be it therefore further Enacted by the Au-  thority aforesaid, That nothing in this Act contained shall be  construed to extend to subject any Bookseller, Printer, or other  Person whatsoever, to the Forfeitures or Penalties therein men-  tioned, for or by reason of the Printing or Reprinting of any Book  or Books without such Consent, as aforesaid, unless the Title  to the Copy of such Book or Books hereafter Published shall,  before such Publication be Entred [sic], in the Register-Book of the  Company of Stationers, in such manner as hath been usual,  which Register-Book shall at all times be kept at the Hall of  the said Company, and unless such Consent of the Proprietor  or Proprietors be in like manner Entred [sic], as aforesaid, for every  of which several Entries, Six Pence shall be Paid, and no  more; which said Register-Book may, at all Seasonable [sic; should be:    Reasonable] and  Convenient times, be Resorted to, and Inspected by any Book-  seller, Printer, or other Person, for the Purposes before menti-  oned,    Page 3    oned, without any Fee or Reward; and the Clerk of the said  Company of Stationers, shall, when and as often as thereunto  required, give a Certificate under his Hand of such Entry or En-  tries, and for every such Certificate, may take a Fee not exceed-  ing Six Pence.

Do be quiet,  Bee? Sit down and read me the letter, or let me read it.\"    \"I'll read it to you,\" answered Bee, kissing the missive rapturously.  \"I'll read it in a minute. Oh, oh, oh! I'm so happy I could fly.\"    She grew quiet presently, however, and seating herself again, began to  read:           \"Cairo, Egypt,        May 16th, 19--.         \"My dear Little Daughter:--         \"When you receive this letter your father will be nearer to you       than he has been for many a day. Child, I am coming home. Yes;       after all these years I am returning to you. How long I shall       remain is problematical, as I have not yet completed my       investigation of the Lepidoptera of tropical countries.       However, that is a matter that may be left to the future.         \"Another two years would have terminated my task, but such a       longing has come to me to behold my little daughter who must       now be almost a woman that I have dropped everything, and am       coming to her as swiftly as steam can carry me.         \"No doubt you have often wondered that I should have left you,       and the subject has been too painful to me to discuss; but now,       you are old enough to understand my reasons. When your mother       died she left a void in my life that nothing but the most       engrossing occupation could make me forget. Change of scene was       an absolute necessity for me; and so, when Union University       wished to send an entomologist to study the habits of Moths and       Butterflies of other countries, I was glad indeed when it was       proposed that I should be the one to go. You were but five       years old, and needed a woman's care more than mine, so I left       you with your uncle's family. I still think it was the best       thing I could have done.         \"I thought that it would be an easy matter to stay away for       twelve, or even more years, but lately there have come to me       sweet visions of a daughter's companionship, and Nature will no       longer be denied. It is partly your letters which have wrought       this change. They have been so bright, so clever, so amusing,       that you must have a mind of unusual intelligence. I said       'partly your letters'; for the receipt of your photograph       completed what the letters had begun.         \"I can not resist the winsomeness of your picture, so I am       coming back to get acquainted with you, and perhaps we shall       discover a mutual companionship and affection.         \"Are you like your mother, I wonder, or do you take after me? I       can not tell by your picture, but I think--No; I shall not tell       you what I think until I see you.         \"So, little girl, get your aunt and uncle to go over to our       house to open it up, and to make it habitable for living. If       nothing happens I shall be with you on the evening of the       Fifteenth of June. I am writing Henry, also, by this mail.        \"Hoping to see you soon, I am      \"Your most loving father,      \"William Raymond.\"    \"He is coming,\" ended Bee with a little sob. \"My own, own father.\"    \"I am glad,\" spoke Adele, but her voice was weak as she said it. Into  her face had come a look of dismay as Bee read what her father had said  of the \"winsomeness of the picture.\" An impulse came to her to confess  to her cousin what she had done, but she was fearful of what Bee might  say. She had not thought that it would have this effect. And so she sat  quieter than her wont while Bee gave vent to her delight.    \"You don't know how I've felt at times, Adele,\" said Bee. \"I've almost  envied you your father. When Uncle Henry has kissed you, and petted and  indulged you it hasn't seemed fair that I couldn't have my father. But I  never told you before, and I didn't tell any one. I knew father wouldn't  stay away unless he thought it was right, and I see now just why he did  it. I'll tell him that I don't blame him a bit. And we'll just love each  other all the more for being apart so long.\"    And so, with tears and laughter mingling together, Bee rejoiced. A  meadow lark flew, across the road, alighted on a twig and sang to them.  An oriole peeped at them saucily from his perch on a near-by tree, then  whistled playfully, \"Sweet, do you hear? Sweet, sweet, do you hear?\" And  Bee threw back her head caught his note, and answered joyfully, \"I hear.  I hear. Sweet, sweet.\"    \"How much Uncle William thinks of you, Bee,\" observed Adele presently.  \"And he seems to be so pleased with your mind. Scientific people think  so much of intellect, don't they?\"    \"I wonder if they do?\" mused Bee. \"I don't believe that they are much  different from other people. And after all it is not my mind that is  bringing him home, but my picture. Oh, I wish that I had sent it long  ago.\"    Adele winced. \"He'll find you awfully clever, Bee.\"    \"You dear!\" exclaimed Bee leaning forward to kiss her. \"You are just as  sweet as you are pretty.\"    \"Sue Ford said the other day that I was sweet because I did not have  sense enough to be anything else,\" observed Adele.    \"The mean thing!\" cried Bee. \"Sue says lots of things, although I am  glad that she said what she did about father's not knowing me. If she  had not said that I would have thought that my picture was not good  enough to send, and father wouldn't be coming home. Still, I don't like  her saying that you have no sense.\"    \"Oh, I don't mind,\" said Adele, biting a blade of grass meditatively.  After all, it did not matter so much about the picture. When her Uncle  William came she would tell them that she did it for fun, and they would  have a good laugh. Bee wouldn't mind at all when her father was really  with her. So, quite restored to her usual complacency, she continued; \"I  know that I am not clever like you, or Sue, or some of the other girls;  and when I see how worried you get over your examinations I am glad that  I'm not. Bee, does Uncle William know that you have studied up  butterflies?\"    \"No; I was going to tell him when I answered this letter. I expect that  he will laugh at my specimens. Dear father!\"    She lingered over the word as though she liked to say it. All at once  she rose with a little cry. \"We must go home, Adele. Aunt Annie ought to  know about father at once, so that she can make the necessary  arrangements about going to Walnut Grove. To think of being in my own  home with my own father so soon!\"    \"Bee,\" said Adele slipping her arm through her cousin's as they walked  homeward, \"will you let me wear your new hat Sunday?\"    \"Yes;\" assented Bee abstractedly. She was accustomed to having Adele  wear her new things, though Adele did not wish to lend her own.    \"And your bracelet?\" went on Adele, seeing that Bee was too absorbed to  care what she promised.    \"Anything you wish, Adele,\" answered Beatrice impatiently. \"Only let's  hurry. Aunt Annie won't like it if we loiter too long after knowing  about father.\"    Adele complied willingly, and the rest of the distance was accomplished  quickly. Bee paused at the orchard gate.    \"Listen how the birds are singing,\" she cried. \"Do you suppose that they  know that father is coming?\"    \"You goosey!\" laughed her cousin. \"They were singing when we went out.\"    \"Not like this, Adele. Just listen!\"    A riot of happiness in quivering bursts of song came from the leafy  boughs of the trees. Cardinal, oriole, tawny thrush and gold-finch  seemed to vie with each other in pouring forth the sweetest melody.    \"How happy they are,\" cried Bee. \"Almost as happy as I am. And it was  just here that the butterfly lighted on my head. I'll always believe  that omen after this because I did have good news. Why, there is  auntie!\"    \"What news, children?\" called Mrs. Raymond as she came through the trees  toward them.    \"The best in the world,\" answered Beatrice waving her letter excitedly.  \"Father is coming home! He will be here by the Fifteenth of June, and we  are to go over to our house to get things ready for him. Will you go?  Will Uncle Henry be able to leave court, and come too?\"    \"William coming home?\" Mrs. Raymond stopped in her surprise. \"Is it  possible? What does he say? Let me read the letter.\"    \"Here it is,\" cried Bee handing it to her. \"He is really coming. Oh,  aren't you glad, glad?\"    \"Indeed I am. For all our sakes, but most of all for yours. I have  thought for some time that it was his duty, and I am glad that he sees  it at last.\"    \"Bee is awfully keen to leave us,\" spoke Adele reproachfully. \"You will  have to live with your father now, Bee, and you won't be with me at  all.\"    \"You won't lose me quite, Adele.\" Bee was surprised and touched by the  speech. It was not often that her cousin showed so much affection for  her as she had done that day. \"The only difference will be that we won't  be in the same house. Walnut Grove is near enough to see each other  often. Won't we have good times together? I am so happy!\"    \"Henry will be pleased too,\" smiled her aunt. \"I presume he has his  letter already. Bee, you will tire yourself if you keep capering about  so. You don't remember your father at all, do you?\"    \"Yes;\" answered Bee with passionate intentness. \"Of course, I know him  from his letters, and then I remember how he used to carry me. His eyes  are dark, but he doesn't look a bit like me. I know that he is handsome,  and distinguished, and oh, I'd know him anywhere!\"    \"Well, he is all that, but you must have heard us speak of it. You were  but five when he left, and could not possibly remember all those things.  We must go over to the Grove tomorrow, I think, to see what is to be  done. Henry can"]]]
