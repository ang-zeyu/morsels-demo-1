The more unequal a country's income  distribution, the farther its Lorenz curve from the 45 degree line and  the higher its Gini index, e.g., a Sub-Saharan country with an index of  50. If income were distributed with perfect equality, the Lorenz curve  would coincide with the 45 degree line and the index would be zero; if  income were distributed with perfect inequality, the Lorenz curve would  coincide with the horizontal axis and the right vertical axis and the  index would be 100.    Economy:  This category includes the entries dealing with the size,  development, and management of productive resources, i.e., land, labor,  and capital.    Economy - overview:  This entry briefly describes the type of economy,  including the degree of market orientation, the level of economic  development, the most important natural resources, and the unique areas  of specialization.

The following terms and abbreviations  are used throughout the entry:    Acidification - the lowering of soil and water pH due to acid  precipitation and deposition usually through precipitation; this  process disrupts ecosystem nutrient flows and may kill freshwater fish  and plants dependent on more neutral or alkaline conditions (see acid  rain).    Acid rain - characterized as containing harmful levels of sulfur  dioxide or nitrogen oxide; acid rain is damaging and potentially deadly  to the earth's fragile ecosystems; acidity is measured using the pH  scale where 7 is neutral, values greater than 7 are considered  alkaline, and values below 5.6 are considered acid precipitation; note  - a pH of 2.4 (the acidity of vinegar) has been measured in rainfall in  New England.    Aerosol - a collection of airborne particles dispersed in a gas, smoke,  or fog.    Afforestation - converting a bare or agricultural space by planting  trees and plants; reforestation involves replanting trees on areas that  have been cut or destroyed by fire.    Asbestos - a naturally occurring soft fibrous mineral commonly used in  fireproofing materials and considered to be highly carcinogenic in  particulate form.    Biodiversity - also biological diversity; the relative number of  species, diverse in form and function, at the genetic, organism,  community, and ecosystem level; loss of biodiversity reduces an  ecosystem's ability to recover from natural or man-induced disruption.    Bio-indicators - a plant or animal species whose presence, abundance,  and health reveal the general condition of its habitat.    Biomass - the total weight or volume of living matter in a given area  or volume.    Carbon cycle - the term used to describe the exchange of carbon (in  various forms, e.g., as carbon dioxide) between the atmosphere, ocean,  terrestrial biosphere, and geological deposits.    Catchments - assemblages used to capture and retain rainwater and  runoff; an important water management technique in areas with limited  freshwater resources, such as Gibraltar.    DDT (dichloro-diphenyl-trichloro-ethane) - a colorless, odorless  insecticide that has toxic effects on most animals; the use of DDT was  banned in the US in 1972.    Defoliants - chemicals which cause plants to lose their leaves  artificially; often used in agricultural practices for weed control,  and may have detrimental impacts on human and ecosystem health.    Deforestation - the destruction of vast areas of forest (e.g.,  unsustainable forestry practices, agricultural and range land clearing,  and the over exploitation of wood products for use as fuel) without  planting new growth.    Desertification - the spread of desert-like conditions in arid or semi-  arid areas, due to overgrazing, loss of agriculturally productive  soils, or climate change.    Dredging - the practice of deepening an existing waterway; also, a  technique used for collecting bottom-dwelling marine organisms (e.g.,  shellfish) or harvesting coral, often causing significant destruction  of reef and ocean-floor ecosystems.    Drift-net fishing - done with a net, miles in extent, that is generally  anchored to a boat and left to float with the tide; often results in an  over harvesting and waste of large populations of non-commercial marine  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29246"],[0,"The International Monthly, Volume 3, No. 2, May, 1851 (#4)"],[1,"satirize; he was obliged to set up sin in its high place  before he could crown it with infamy.\" The times were full of internal  as well as foreign disturbance, and Hogarth's studio was no hermitage to  exclude passing events or their promoters. He lived with the living,  moving _present_,--his engravings being his pleasures; portraits, as  they are now to many a high-hearted man of talent, his means of  subsistence; heavy weights of mortality that fetter and clog the  ascending spirit.    His controversies and encounters with the worthless Wilkes,--his defence  of his own theories,--his determined dislike to the establishment of a  Royal Academy--his various other controversies--rendered his exciting  course very different from that of the lonely artists of the present  day, who are but too fond of living in closed studios, \"pouring,\" as  Hogarth would have said,--\"pouring wine from one vessel into  another,\"--pondering over tales and poems for inspiration, and  transcribing the worn-out models of many seasons into attitudes of  bounding and varied life! Is it not wonderful, as sad, that the artist  will not feel his power, will not take his own place, assume his high  standing as of old, and demand the duty of respect from the world by the  just exercise of his glorious privilege! \"Entertainment and information  are not all the mind requires at the hand of an artist; we wish to be  elevated by contemplating what is noble,--to be warmed, by the presence  of the heroic,--and charmed and made happy by the light of purity and  loveliness. We desire to share in the lofty movements of fine minds--to  have communion with their image of what is godlike, and to take a part  in the rapture of their love, and in the ecstasies of all their musings.  This is the chief end of high poetry, of high painting, and high  sculpture; and the man misunderstands the true spirit of those arts who  seeks to deprive them of a portion of their divinity, and argues that  entertainment and information constitute their highest aim.\" We have  quoted this passage because it expresses our notions of the power of art  more happily than we are able to express it; but we must add that the  _teaching_ as well as the _poetic_ painter has much to complain of from  society; it is impossible to mingle among the \"higher classes\" without  being struck by their indifference to every phase of British  art,--except portraiture. \"Have you been to the Exhibition? Are there  many nice miniatures? are the portraits good? Lady D.'s lace is perfect;  Mrs. A.'s velvet is inimitable.\" Such observations strike the ear with  painful discord, when the mind is filled with memories of those who are  brave or independent enough to \"look forward\" with creative genius.  There are many noble exceptions among our aristocracy; but with far too  great a number art is a mere fashion.    [Illustration: HOGARTH'S HOUSE.]    As a people, neither our eyes nor our ears are yet opened to its  instructive and elevating faculty. We mistake the outlay of money for an  expenditure of sympathy.    Hogarth's portraits were almost too faithful to please his sitters: he  was too truthful to flatter, even on canvas; and the wonder is that he  achieved any popularity in this fantastic branch of his art. Allan  Cunningham has said of him, that he regarded neither the historian's  page, nor the poet's song. He was contented with the occurrences of the  passing day, with the folly or the sin of the hour; yet to the garb and  fashion of the moment, he adds story and sentiment for all time. It is  quite delicious to read the excuses Allan makes for the foibles of the  man whose virtues had touched his own generous heart; he confesses with  great _naivete_ that he looked coldly--\"too coldly, perhaps\"--on foreign  art, and perhaps too fondly on his own productions; and then adds that,  \"where vanity soonest misleads the judgment he thought wisely; he  contemplated his own works, not as things excellent in themselves, but  as the rudiments of future excellence, and looked forward with the hope  that some happier Hogarth would raise, on the foundation he had laid, a  perfect and lasting superstructure.\"    We must humbly differ from the poet in this matter; we believe, if the  characteristic cap were removed from that sturdy brow, we should find an  admirable development of the organ of self-esteem. He thought as little  of a future and \"happier Hogarth,\" as he did of the old masters. He was  Monarch of the Present--and he knew it!    The age we live in talks much about renovation, but it is not a  conservative age; on the contrary, it would pull down Temple Bar, if it  dared, to widen the passage from the Strand into Fleet Street; and it  demolishes houses, shrines of _noble memories_, with a total absence of  respect for what it ought to honor. We never hear of an old house  without a feeling that it is either going to be destroyed or modernized;  and this inevitably leads to a desire to visit it immediately. Having  determined on a drive to Chiswick to make acquaintance with the dwelling  of Hogarth, and look upon his tomb--we became restless until it was  accomplished.    We had seen, by the courtesy of Mr. Allison, the piano-forte  manufacturer in Dean Street, the residence of Sir James Thornhill, whose  daughter Hogarth married: the proprietor bestows most praiseworthy care  on the house, which was formerly one of considerable extent and  importance. Mr. Allison says there can be little doubt that the grounds  extended into Wardour Street. Once, while removing a chimney-piece in  the drawing-room, a number of cards tumbled out--slips of  playing-cards, with the names of some of the most distinguished persons  of Hogarth's time written on the backs; the residences were also given,  proving that the \"gentry\" then dwelt where now the poorer classes  congregate. But the most interesting part of the house is the staircase,  with its painted ceiling; the wall of the former is divided into three  compartments, each representing a sort of ball-room back-ground, with  groups of figures life-size, looking down from a balcony; they are well  preserved, and one of the ladies is thought to be a very faithful  portrait of Mrs. Hogarth. Hogarth must have spent some time in that  house:--but we were resolved, despite the repute of its being old and  ugly, to visit his dwelling-place at Chiswick; and though we made the  pilgrimage by a longer _route_ than was necessary, we did not regret  skirting the beautiful plantations of the Duke of Devonshire, nor  enjoying the fragrance of the green meadows, which never seem so green  to us, as in the vale of the Thames. The house is a tall, narrow,  abrupt-looking place, close to the roadside wall of its inclosed garden;  numbers of cottage dwellings for the poor have sprung up around it, but  in Hogarth's day it must have been very isolated: not leading to the  water, as we had imagined, but having a dull and prison-like aspect; if,  indeed, any place can have that aspect where trees grow, and grass is  checkered by their ever-varying shadows. The house was occupied from  1814 to 1832 by Cary, the translator of Dante; and it would be worth a  pilgrimage if considered only as the residence of this truly-excellent  and highly-gifted clergyman.    [Illustration: ROOM IN HOGARTH'S HOUSE.]    We have received from his son an interesting note relative to its  features at the period when it came into his father's possession. \"The  house,\" he says, \"stands in one corner of a high-walled garden of about  three quarters of an acre, that part of the garden which faced the house  was divided into long, narrow, formal flower-beds. Five large trees,  whose ages bespoke their acquaintance with Hogarth, showed his love of  the beautiful as well as the useful, a mulberry, walnut, apricot,  double-blossomed cherry, and a hawthorn: the last of these was a great  favorite with my father, from its beauty, and the attraction it was to  the nightingale, which never failed to visit it in the spring: the  gardeners were their mortal enemies, and alas, have at length prevailed.  A few years ago, when I went to visit the old place, only one of the  trees remained, (the mulberry seen in our sketch); in a nook at one side  of the garden was a nut-walk, with a high wall and a row of  filbert-trees that arched triumphantly over it; at one end of this walk  was a stone slab, on which Hogarth used to play at nine-pins; at the  other end were the two little tombstones to the memory of a bird and a  dog.\" The house is as you see it here, the rooms with low ceilings and  all sorts of odd shapes,--up and down, in and out,--yet withal pleasant  and comfortable, and rendered more so by the gentle courtesy of their  mistress and her kindly servant; the very dogs seemed to partake of the  human nature of their protector, and attended us wherever we went, with  more than ordinary civility. Hogarth might have been tempted to  immortalize one of them for its extreme ugliness, and the waggish spirit  with which it pulled at its companion's ears, who in vain attempted to  tug at the bits of stumps that stuck out at either side of its  tormentor's head. Mr. Fairholt was permitted to sketch the drawing room;  the open door leads to the chamber from whence, it is said, Miss  Thornhill eloped with Hogarth.    Mr. Cary, in the note to which we have already alluded, says, \"there can  hardly be a doubt that the house belonged to Sir James Thornhill, and  that Hogarth inherited it from him. Mrs. Hogarth lived there after her  husband's death, and left it by will to a lady from whose executor my  father bought it in the year 1814. The room from which Miss Thornhill is  said to have eloped is the inner room, on the first floor; this room was  used by my father as his study. Over the dining-room fireplace was a  spirited pencil sketch of five heads, and under them written 'five jolly  fellows,' by Hogarth--during an"]]]
