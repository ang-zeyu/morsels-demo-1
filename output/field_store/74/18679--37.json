The buffalo,  from constant wandering among the bush, have formed a perfect maze of  paths. These trails are wide enough under foot, but meet just over one's  shoulders, so that it is impossible to maintain an upright position. The  paths run in all directions, and therefore one cannot see far ahead.  Were it not for the fact that here and there--often 200 feet apart,  however--are small open patches, it would be almost useless to enter  such a fastness. These open places lure one on, as from their edges it  is often possible to get a good shot. Once started, we took up the path  which showed the most and freshest spoor, and, stooping low, pressed on  as swiftly and noiselessly as possible. We had not gone far before we  came upon a small opening, from the center of which rose an acacia not  more than eight inches in thickness of trunk and perhaps eighteen feet  high. It was forked at the height of a man's shoulder. I carried the  8-bore, and was glad of an opportunity to rest it in the convenient fork  before me. I had just done so, when crash! snort! bellow! came several  animals (presumably buffalo) in our direction. One gun-bearer literally  flew up the tree against which I rested my rifle; the other, regardless  of consequences, hurled his naked skin against another but smaller tree,  also thorny; both dropped their rifles. I stood sheltered behind eight  inches of acacia wood, with my rifle pointed in front of me and still  resting in the fork of the tree. The noise of the herd approached nearer  and nearer, and my nerves did not assume that steelly quality I had  imagined always resulted from a sudden danger. Fly I could not, and the  only tree climbable was already occupied; so I stood still.    Just as I looked for the appearance of the beasts in the little opening  in which I stood, the crashing noise separated in two portions--each  passing under cover on either side of the opening. I could see nothing,  but my ears were filled with the noise. The uproar ceased, and I asked  the negro in the tree what had happened. He said, when he first climbed  the tree he could see the bushes in our front move like the waves of the  sea, and then, _Ham del illah_--praise be to God--the buffalo turned on  either side and left our little opening safe. Had they not turned, but  charged straight at us, I fancy I should have had a disagreeable moment.  As it was, I began to understand why buffalo shooting in the bush has  been always considered unsafe, and began to regret that the road back to  the open plain was not a shorter one. We reached it in safety, however,  and, after a short rest, set out up wind.    I got a hartbeest and an mpallah before noon, and then, satisfied with  my day, returned to camp. By 4 P. M. my men had brought in all the meat,  and soon the little camp was filled with strips of fresh meat hanging on  ropes of twisted bark. The next day we exchanged the meat for flour,  beans, pumpkins and Indian corn. I remained in this camp three more days  and then returned to Taveta. Each one of these days I attempted to get a  shot at buffalo, but never managed it. On one occasion I caught a  glimpse of two of these animals in the open, but they were too wary to  allow me to approach them.    When I reached Taveta, I found a capital camp had been built during my  absence, and that a food supply had been laid in sufficient for several  weeks. Shortly after my arrival I was startled by the reports of many  rifles, and soon was delighted to grasp the hands of two  compatriots--Dr. Abbott and Mr. Stevens. They had just returned from a  shooting journey in Masai land, and reported game plenty and natives not  troublesome. My intention was then formed to circumnavigate Mt.  Kilimanjaro, pass over the yet untried shooting grounds and then to  return to the coast.    I left five men in camp at Taveta in charge of most of my goods, and,  taking 118 men with me, set out into Masai land. Even at this late date  (1895) the Masai are reckoned dangerous customers. Up to 1889 but five  European caravans had entered their territory, and all but the  last--that of Dr. Abbott--had reported difficulties with the natives. My  head man, a capital fellow, had had no experience with these people, and  did not look forward with pleasure to making their acquaintance; but he  received orders to prepare for a start with apparent cheerfulness. We  carried with us one ton of beans and dried bananas as food supply. This  was sufficient for a few weeks, but laid me under the necessity of doing  some successful shooting, should I carry out my plan of campaign. Just  on the borders of Masai land live the Useri people, who inhabit the  northeast slopes of Kilimanjaro. We stopped a day or two with them to  increase our food supply, and while the trading was going on I descended  to the plain in search of sport.    I left camp at dawn and it was not till noon that I saw game. Then I  discovered three rhinos; two together lying down, and one solitary,  nearly 500 yards away from the others. The two lying down were nearest  me, but were apparently unapproachable, owing to absolute lack of cover.  The little plain they had chosen for their nap was as flat as a billiard  table and quite bare of grass. The wind blew steadily from them and  whispered me to try my luck, so I crawled cautiously toward them. When I  got to within 150 yards, one of the beasts rose and sniffed anxiously  about and then lay down again. The rhinoceros is nearly blind when in  the bright sun--at night it can see like an owl. I kept on, and when  within 100 yards rose to my knees and fired one barrel of my .577. The  rhinos leapt to their feet and charged straight at me. \"Shall I load the  other barrel or trust to only one?\" This thought ran through my mind,  but the speed of the animals' approach gave me no time to reply to it.  My gun-bearer was making excellent time across the plain toward a group  of trees, so I could make no use of the 8-bore. The beasts came on side  by side, increasing their speed and snorting like steam engines as they  ran. They were disagreeably close when I fired my second barrel and rose  to my feet to bolt to one side. As I rose they swerved to the left and  passed not twenty feet from me, apparently blind to my whereabouts. I  must have hit one with my second shot, for they were too close to permit  a miss. Perhaps that shot turned them. Be that as it may, I felt that I  had had a narrow escape.    When these rhinos had quite disappeared, my faithful gun-bearer  returned, and smilingly congratulated me on what he considered my good  fortune. He then called my attention to the fact that rhinoceros number  three was still in sight, and apparently undisturbed by what had  happened to his friends. Between the beast and me, stretched an open  plain for some 350 yards, then came three or four small trees, and then  from these trees rose a semi-circular hill or rather ridge, on the crest  of which stood the rhino. I made for the trees, and, distrusting my  gun-bearer, took from him the .577 and placed it near one of them. Then,  telling him to retire to a comfortable spot, I advanced with my 8-bore  up the hill toward my game. The soil was soft as powder, so my footsteps  made no noise. Cover, with the exception of a small skeleton bush, but  fifty yards below the rhino, there was none. I reached the bush and  knelt down behind it. The rhino was standing broadside on, motionless  and apparently asleep. I rose and fired, and saw that I had aimed true,  when the animal wheeled round and round in his track. I fired again, and  he then stood still, facing me. I had one cartridge in my pocket and  slipped it in the gun. As I raised the weapon to my shoulder, down the  hill came my enemy. His pace was slow and I could see that he limped.  The impetus given him by the descent kept him going, and his speed  seemed to increase. I fired straight at him and then dropped behind the  bush. He still came on and in my direction; so I leapt to my feet, and,  losing my head, ran straight away in front of him. I should have run to  one side and then up the hill. What was my horror, when pounding away at  a good gait, not more than fifty feet in front of the snorting rhino, to  find myself hurled to the ground, having twisted my ankle. I thought all  was over, when I had the instinct to roll to one side and then scramble  to my feet. The beast passed on. When he reached the bottom of the hill  his pace slackened to a walk, and I returned to where I had left my .577  and killed him at my leisure. I found the 8-bore bullet had shattered  his off hind leg, and that my second shot had penetrated his lungs. I  had left the few men I had brought with me on a neighboring hill when I  had first caught sight of the rhinos, and now sent for them. Not liking  to waste the meat, I sent to camp for twenty porters to carry it back. I  reached camp that night at 12:30 A. M., feeling quite worn out.    After a day's rest we marched to Tok-i-Tok, the frontier of Masai land.  This place is at certain seasons of the year the pasture ground of one  of the worst bands of Masai. I found it nearly deserted. The Masai I met  said their brethren were all gone on a war raid, and that this was the  only reason why I was permitted to enter the country. I told them that I  had come for the purpose of sport, and hoped to kill much game in their  country. This, however, did not appear to interest them, as the Masai  never eat the flesh of game. Nor do they hunt any, with the exception of  buffalo, whose hide they use for shields. I told them I was their friend  and hoped for peace; but, on the other hand, was prepared for war should  they attack me.    From Tok-i-Tok we marched in a leisurely manner to a place whose name  means in English \"guinea fowl camp.\" In this case it was a misnomer, for  we were not so fortunate as to see one of these birds during our stay "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37151"],[0,"Habits, Haunts and Anecdotes of the Moose and Illustrations from Life (#4)"],[1,"know when he came up to a moose. This was  not thoroughly sportsmanlike, they knew, but they were a pair of worthy  men, past the meridian of life, and they did not stand on the ethics of the  hunt.    That night the guide returned and told them he knew where there was a yard  of moose. Next morning, in the sharp air of a snappy-cold dawn, they set  out to find the moose, and had walked but a few miles when tracks were  found in the snow. Then, with the guide leading them, stopping as he went  to avoid low branches laden with snow that hung across their way, or  bending aside some twig to avoid noise, they half walked, half crawled for  upwards of a mile.    They saw moose signs that seemed to them good. At last the guide held up a  warning hand, and proceeded more slowly than formerly.    After many cranings of his neck and changes of position, he drew aside a  branch and told his followers by signs to look in the direction he  indicated with his snow-covered mitten. They looked, but could see nothing  special at first. The guide patiently pointed out to them a clump of bushes  against which he could see the heads of two moose. The animals were lying  down, with their heads to the wind, as is always their custom. The hunters  were for firing precipitately, but their ardor, so quickly aroused, was  dampened by the guide, who motioned them to wait. There was a good wind  blowing, and it came from the moose to the men. Moreover, it made a noise  in the trees, and whispering was therefore safe among the hunters crouched  in the snow. The guide informed them that there were three moose in the  bunch. The judge and the banker could see but two, and these presented as  fair a mark as ever man found for rifle.    When the word was given the two men fired, also the guide. There was a  movement among the moose, and the hunters rushed forward to see the  execution they had wrought. It was startling. There in the snow, still  kicking and quivering, lay three large moose. To the worthy judge and  banker they looked as big as oxen. All three were in the throes of death.    [Illustration: COW AND CALF MOOSE LEAVING THE WATER. (Lobster Lake.)    Photographed from Life.]    There was great rejoicing in the depot camp that night. The two friends  thought themselves favored by the gods of the chase beyond their deserts.  The story of the great hunt was soon current in the community in which the  hunters lived. The version of it given here, with slight variations, is  that of one of the principals in the episode.    [Illustration: COW MOOSE AND CALVES SWIMMING MUD POND.    (West Branch Waters.)

CRACK SHOTS. A JACK, A       MOOSE, AN ACCIDENT. A NOBLE ANIMAL--BUT 'T WAS JUNE.       THE ABLEST ROMANCE IN MOOSE HISTORY.      Picture a hungry group at supper around the camp-fire as night shuts down,  when the noisy jest and laughter are suddenly interrupted by your guide.  Listen! There it is again from over the lake,--the fierce challenge of the  bull and the horn-like note of the cow! I'll not try to record the many  exciting incidents of those glorious morning and evening watches; how this  one saw his lordship in broad daylight swagger across the open, just out of  rifle range; how that one, in the darkness of the homeward trail, called a  jealous bull so near that he could hear him breathe ere the tell-tale human  scent turned his course; or how another stalked a cow moose by mistake, and  watched her some time, vainly hoping her lord would call; for every hunter  knows of these slips, making success more pleasant when it is yours.    I must tell you, however, of that still October morning, of the faint mist  rising from the lake, of the bright hills so fairly mirrored by the clear  waters, and of the rising sun so dazzling on the mist and the water.  Suddenly the guide and I drop the half-prepared breakfast and take to the  canoe in haste. We had heard that note of notes--the angry challenge of a  bull moose. The remembrance of that morning brings back the sound as I  heard it a few miles away over the hills. Watch how the guide is carefully  following the course of the sound. We soon reach the other side. There he  is, head on! Wait! he may give a better shot. No! he sees the canoe. Shoot  now or he will be gone! Bang! A miss, for he did not flinch! The smoke  hides him! Bang! Bang! The guide has fired, too, but the smoke hampers  both. There he goes, crashing through the thicket! Let's give him another  for luck! He certainly was hard hit, and in that event it was best to let  him go, for after a short period of time he would lie down, become stiff,  and die. We paddled back to camp, finished breakfast, and in about three  hours returned to the place from whence he had entered the woods, and there  we found him, cold in death. He was a monster! A wealth of black, glossy  hair, a splendid bell, and massive antlers, fit to adorn any mantel.    [Illustration: _Under full head of steam_        _A Summer      Episode in the      Life of a young      Bull Moose_    _Nearing terra firma_    Photographed from Life.]    Three days later another fine bull fell to my party. Just at sunset he was  called out from across a pond, and strolled with that majestic woodland  swagger through the shallow water. The first shot so confused him that he  turned and came directly towards us, but soon veered off. At a closer range  this might have been interpreted as a fierce charge of the dying bull,  though it was merely an aimless start of surprise. He fell, with the ball  behind his shoulder, and we found him quite dead. It was a fatal one,  though it failed to stop him until he had gone fifty yards.    There was one section I had not visited, and this was to the east, in the  direction of the brook which had proven too small for floating logs. So it  was that after pulling the cabin door to, I made tracks toward the stream,  which I knew must be asleep under four or five inches of ice and two feet  of snow.    [Illustration: Off for t'other side    Safe ashore    What's that?    Bound inland    Photographed from Life.]    In half an hour's time I had reached the bank and crossed over, keeping  close to it all the time. I had not gone far beyond the ravine-like  formation with the brook hugging its lowest point, when there were  unmistakable evidences of large game. Moose it was. Tracks as large as a  cow, great rents in the snow crust, through which the brown earth showed in  spots; these were some of the traces. I went back across the ravine and  proceeded up-stream, following the east bank; saw several fresh tracks, but  they were cows, and along in the afternoon, while travelling up an old  brook, I saw the imprints of a large bull, and they were big ones, together  with a cow and calf. It did not take me long to decide what to do, and as  they followed the brook I knew that they had not heard me. The wind was  favorable and they were working up into it. Finally they left the brook  and that necessitated more caution on my part. I had covered about half a  mile and I heard the cow calling. Suddenly she came into view. I worked up  to within forty yards of her in hopes to find the bull, but ran into the  calf, a two-year-old; luckily he did not see me. Things were getting  interesting, with a moose on my left and another in front of me. Working my  way cautiously along I heard the bull in the thick growth. He was so  covered that I could hardly see him. By careful inspection, one antler and  part of his shoulder showed. Raising my rifle I fired, at which he stepped  into the clearing and stood defiant. What a noble looking fellow he was,  and a monster in size as he stood there shaking his head, blood running  from his mouth and nostrils. Once again I fired. As the last one struck he  went down, the shot breaking his shoulder blade--another victim of the  30-30.    The experience of a young New Yorker will serve to exemplify both the  uncertainty of moose calling and the manner in which it is prosecuted. He  was hunting in the Bear River woods, accompanied by one of the most expert  guides of that section. Two nights of calling proved fruitless. The  sportsman frankly told his guide he had no faith in it, and that he did not  believe a moose would come to the call of a man. This considerably ruffled  the guide's conceit, and he resolved, if possible, to make a lasting  impression to the contrary on the mind of his employer. That afternoon an  ideal place for calling was chosen. The tent was pitched beside a giant  boulder, on one side of which a narrow, open bog stretched away between  wooded banks, and on the other a sort of natural park extended to the foot  of a ridge covered with hard wood. The guide exacted the promise that his  companion would not shoot until he gave the word. All arrangements being  complete, as the sun was nearing the western horizon, the guide climbed to  the top of the boulder and sounded the call.    [Illustration: BULL MOOSE IN CARIBOU LAKE.    Photographed from Life.]    Almost immediately, from the ridge, about two miles away, came the  deep-voiced answer of an old bull. A few minutes sufficed to show that he  was coming at a rapid pace. The guide continued to call at regular  intervals, and in a few minutes another answer was heard far down the bog,  though this time from a smaller moose. A few seconds later brought a reply  from a third, in another direction. The sport was getting exciting. The  guide came down from his perch on the rock and stationed his employer and  himself behind a smaller boulder, over which it was possible to look while  lying on the ground. The guide thought the young moose would not come up  for fear of the larger ones, and of course the one he wanted was the  monster that had first"]]]
