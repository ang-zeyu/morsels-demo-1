It is many years ago that, when thinking of the large number of cats  kept in London alone, I conceived the idea that it would be well to  hold \"Cat Shows,\" so that the different breeds, colours, markings, etc.,  might be more carefully attended to, and the domestic cat, sitting in  front of the fire, would then possess a beauty and an attractiveness to  its owner unobserved and unknown because uncultivated heretofore.  Prepossessed with this view of the subject, I called on my friend Mr.  Wilkinson, the then manager of the Crystal Palace. With his usual  businesslike clear-headedness, he saw it was \"a thing to be done.\" In a  few days I presented my scheme in full working order: the schedule of  prizes, the price of entry, the number of classes, and the points by  which they would be judged, the number of prizes in each class, their  amount, the different varieties of colour, form, size, and sex for which  they were to be given; I also made a drawing of the head of a cat to be  printed in black on yellow paper for a posting bill. Mr. F. Wilson, the  Company's naturalist and show manager, then took the matter in charge,  worked hard, got a goodly number of cats together, among which was my  blue tabby, \"The Old Lady,\" then about fourteen years old, yet the best  in the show of its colour and never surpassed, though lately possibly  equalled. To my watch-chain I have attached the silver bell she wore at  her _debut_.    My brother, John Jenner Weir, the Rev. J. Macdona, and myself acted as  judges, and the result was a success far beyond our most sanguine  expectations--so much so that I having made it a labour of love of the  feline race, and acting \"without fee, gratuity, or reward,\" the Crystal  Palace Company generously presented me with a large silver tankard in  token of their high approval of my exertions on behalf of \"the Company,\"  and--Cats. Now that a Cat Club is formed, shows are more numerous, and  the entries increasing, there is every reason to expect a permanent  benefit in every way to one of the most intelligent of (though often  much abused) animals.    [Illustration]          THE FIRST CAT SHOW.      On the day for judging, at Ludgate Hill I took a ticket and the train  for the Crystal Palace. Sitting alone in the comfortable cushioned  compartment of a \"first class,\" I confess I felt somewhat more than  anxious as to the issue of the experiment. Yes; what would it be like?  Would there be many cats? How many? How would the animals comport  themselves in their cages? Would they sulk or cry for liberty, refuse  all food? or settle down and take the situation quietly and resignedly,  or give way to terror? I could in no way picture to myself the scene; it  was all so new. Presently, and while I was musing on the subject, the  door was opened, and a friend got in. \"Ah!\" said he, \"how are you?\"  \"Tolerably well,\" said I; \"I am on my way to the Cat Show.\" \"What!\"  said my friend, \"that surpasses everything! A show of cats! Why, I hate  the things; I drive them off my premises when I see them. You'll have a  fine bother with them in their cages! Or are they to be tied up? Anyhow,  what a noise there will be, and how they will clutch at the bars and try  and get out, or they will strangle themselves with their chains.\" \"I am  sorry, very sorry,\" said I, \"that you do not like cats. For my part, I  think them extremely beautiful, also very graceful in all their actions,  and they are quite as domestic in their habits as the dog, if not more  so. They are very useful in catching rats and mice; they are not  deficient in sense; they will jump up at doors to push up latches with  their paws. I have known them knock at a door by the knocker when  wanting admittance. They know Sunday from the week-day, and do not go  out to wait for the meat barrow on that day; they----\" \"Stop,\" said my  friend, \"I see you do like cats, and I do not, so let the matter drop.\"  \"No,\" said I, \"not so. That is why I instituted this Cat Show; I wish  every one to see how beautiful a well-cared-for cat is, and how docile,  gentle, and--may I use the term?--cossetty. Why should not the cat that  sits purring in front of us before the fire be an object of interest,  and be selected for its colour, markings, and form? Now come with me, my  dear old friend, and see the first Cat Show.\"    Inside the Crystal Palace stood my friend and I. Instead of the noise  and struggles to escape, there lay the cats in their different pens,  reclining on crimson cushions, making no sound save now and then a  homely purring, as from time to time they lapped the nice new milk  provided for them. Yes, there they were, big cats, very big cats,  middling-sized cats, and small cats, cats of all colours and markings,  and beautiful pure white Persian cats; and as we passed down the front  of the cages I saw that my friend became interested; presently he said:  \"What a beauty this is! and here's another!\" \"And no doubt,\" said I,  \"many of the cats you have seen before would be quite as beautiful if  they were as well cared for, or at least cared for at all; generally  they are driven about and ill-fed, and often ill-used, simply for the  reason that they are cats, and for no other. Yet I feel a great pleasure  in telling you the show would have been much larger were it not for the  difficulty of inducing the owners to send their pets from home, though  you see the great care that is taken of them.\" \"Well, I had no idea  there was such a variety of form, size, and colour,\" said my friend, and  departed. A few months after, I called on him; he was at luncheon, with  two cats on a chair beside him--pets I should say, from their  appearance.    [Illustration]    This is not a solitary instance of the good of the first Cat Show in  leading up to the observation of, and kindly feeling for, the domestic  cat. Since then, throughout the length and breadth of the land there  have been Cat Shows, and much interest is taken in them by all classes  of the community, so much so that large prices have been paid for  handsome specimens. It is to be hoped that by these shows the too often  despised cat will meet with the attention and kind treatment that every  dumb animal should have and ought to receive at the hands of humanity.  Even the few instances of the shows generating a love for cats that have  come before my own notice are a sufficient pleasure to me not to regret  having thought out and planned the first Cat Show at the Crystal  Palace.    [Illustration]          HABITS.      Before attempting to describe the different varieties, I should like to  make a few remarks as to the habits and ways of \"the domestic cat.\"    When judging, I have frequently found some of the exhibits of anything  but a mild and placid disposition. Some have displayed a downright  ferocity; others, on the contrary, have been excessively gentle, and  very few but seemed to recognise their position, and submitted quietly  to their confinement. This is easily accounted for when persons are  accustomed to cats; they know what wonderful powers of observation the  cat possesses, and how quickly they recognise the \"why and the  wherefore\" of many things. Take for instance, how very _many_ cats will  open a _latched_ door by springing up and holding on with one fore-leg  while with the other they press down the latch catch, and so open the  door; and yet even more observant are they than that, as I have shown by  a case in my \"Animal Stories, Old and New,\" in which a cat opened a  door by pulling it _towards_ him, when he found _pushing_ it of no  avail. The cat is more critical in noticing than the dog. I never knew  but one dog that would open a door by moving the fastening without being  shown or taught how to do it. Cats that have done so are numberless. I  noticed one at the last Crystal Palace Show, a white cat: it looked up,  it looked down, then to the right and then a little to the left, paused,  seemed lost in thought, when, not seeing any one about, it crept up to  the door, and with its paw tried to pull back the bolt or catch. On  getting sight of me, it retired to a corner of the cage, shut its eyes,  and pretended to sleep. I stood further away, and soon saw the paw  coming through the bars again. This cat had noticed how the cage-door  was fastened, and so knew how to open it.    Many cats that are said to be spiteful are made so by ill-treatment,  for, as a rule, I have found them to be most affectionate and gentle,  and that to the last degree, attaching themselves to individuals,  although such is stated not to be the case, yet of this I am certain.  Having had several in my house at one time, I found that no two were the  \"followers\" of the same member of my family. But it may be argued, and I  think with some degree of justice, Why was this? Was it only that each  cat had a separate liking? If so, why? Why should not three or four cats  take a liking to the same individual? But they seldom or never do, and  for that matter there seems somewhat the same feeling with dogs. This  required some consideration, but that not of long duration. For I am  sorry to say I rapidly came to the conclusion that it was jealousy. Yes,  jealousy! There was no doubt of it. Zeno would be very cossetty, loving,  lovable, and gentle, but when Lulu came in and was nursed he retired to  a corner and seized the first opportunity of vanishing through the door.  As soon as Zillah jumped on my knee and put her paws about my neck, Lulu  looked at me, then at her, then at me, walked to the fire, sat down,  looked round, got up, went to the door, cried to go out, the door was  opened, and----she fled. I thought that Zillah seemed then more than  ever--happy.    Though jealousy is one of if not the ruling attributes of the cat, there  are exceptions to such a rule. Sometimes it may be that two or more will  take to the same person.

A voice from heaven was to reveal  the time, and send forth the cry--\"_Come out of her my people, that ye  be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.  For her sins have reached unto heaven, and God hath remembered her  iniquities_.\"    All the darkness of the middle ages; all the priestcraft or kingcraft  of every age, since the slaughter of the Apostles; all the  oppressions, persecutions, or abuses of power; all the extravagancies  and idleness on the one hand, and all the sufferings and miseries of  the toiling millions for want of the comforts of life, on the other;  all the ignorance, superstitions, errors, divisions and contentions  which have transpired in the name of \"_Christianity_\" down to the  present time; have been the results of the decline, and loss of the  keys and powers, of the science of Theology, or for want of attention  to them when existing on the earth.    Nor will the \"_Christian_\" world ever attain to any considerable  degree of knowledge, power, or union in religious progress, until they  discover their loss of this science, become sensible of the need of  its restoration, and humble themselves as in the dust, and welcome a  messenger who comes in the name of the Lord, with a commission from  heaven, and with keys committed by the Angels of God--a new Apostolic  commission, a restoration of the Kingdom and Church, and power and  gifts of God; a new dispensation, universally proclaimed in all the  world, with power and signs following; and the whole consummated by  the glorious restoration of Israel and Judah to their own land and  nationality, and to the true fold of God; together with the second  advent of Messiah and all his Saints with him, to overthrow \"Mystery  Babylon,\" and reign on the earth.    Such are the events, such is the remedy for the past and present  evils.          CHAPTER IV.    RISE, PROGRESS, DECLINE, AND LOSS OF THE SCIENCE OF THEOLOGY ON THE  WESTERN HEMISPHERE, AS BROUGHT TO LIGHT BY THE LATE DISCOVERY OF  ANCIENT AMERICAN RECORDS.          The spirit world is moved, the silence broken,      The ancient Seers from out the ground have spoken.      The appointed years on time's fleet wings have fled.      And voices whisper from the ancient dead.      Volumes of truth the sacred archives yield.      The past, the glorious future, stand revealed.    We are now, of necessity, carried back in our research to the cradle  of nations, the Tower of Babel, in order to trace the history of this  wonderful science, from the first emigration of a colony to the  western hemisphere, till its final decline and overthrow, for the  knowledge of which we are indebted to many ancient records, written by  the fathers, or ancient students and professors of this science, on  the western hemisphere.    Among these we will make honourable mention of the Prophets Jared,  Ether, Lehi, Nephi, Mosiah, Alma, Abinadi, Mormon, and Moroni, who  wrote and prophesied in the western hemisphere, during the several  ages intervening between the time of the dispersion at Babel, and the  fifth century of the Christian era.    By the science of Theology Jared and his brother led a colony from the  great tower to the sea coast, conversing with the Lord, and walking by  the light of His revelations on the way.    By this science they were instructed in the building of eight barges  similar to the ark of Noah.    By this science their leader saw God, face to face, and talked with  Him in plain humility, as one man talks with another, thus obtaining a  knowledge of His future coming and Kingdom, and of the great events of  all ages and generations.    By this science they were preserved on the great waters three hundred  and forty-four days, and were then landed, with their eight barges, in  the western hemisphere, together with their women, children, cattle,  and seeds of every kind.    By this science they became a great nation, peopling the entire  continent, and enjoying all the blessings of civilization and heavenly  light.    By the abuse and neglect of it they were at length exterminated, in  the days of their Prophet Ether, who lived about six hundred years  before Christ came in the flesh.    By this science the Prophets Lehi and Nephi came out with a colony  from Jerusalem, in the days of Jeremiah the Prophet, and after  wandering for eight years in the wilderness of Arabia, came to the sea  coast, built a vessel, obtained from the Lord a compass to guide them  on the way, and finally landed in safety on the coast of what is now  called Chili, in South America.    By this science they also became a great nation, enjoyed many visions,  had the ministering of angels, and of many Prophets, by which means  they knew of the coming, birth, ministry, death, resurrection, and  ascension of Jesus Christ.    By this science they also enjoyed a personal visit of the risen  Redeemer, who descended from heaven in their presence, taught them his  Gospel, chose and ordained twelve of their number as Apostles, and  prophesied many things.    By this science these twelve and others established the Gospel,  Church, and ordinances of God throughout the entire western  hemisphere.    By this science their sick were healed, demons were expelled, the lame  walked, the blind saw, the dumb spake, the deaf heard, and their dead  were raised.    By this science three of those Apostles, having a change wrought upon  them, tarried in the flesh upon the earth, ministered the Gospel and  its blessings nearly four hundred years, and then withdrew from the  people because of their iniquity, took away the keys of Apostleship  and of the Gospel, and its powers, sealed up the records, and caused  the work of healing, and of gifts and miracles, to cease from among  the people, because of iniquity, bloodshed, and persecution.    By this science they yet live in the flesh upon the earth, holding  keys of Apostleship and power upon the western hemisphere, being now  about one thousand eight hundred years old.    By this science (being held in reserve above the powers of mystery  Babylon,) they will soon go forth, prophesying, preaching the Gospel,  and doing mighty signs and wonders in the midst of all nations, in  order to complete and mature the Gentile fulness, and restore the  tribes of Israel. Nor is this all--John, the beloved disciple among  the Jews, is yet alive in the flesh, and is held in reserve, to  \"_prophesy again before many peoples, and nations, and tongues, and  kings_\" as it is written.    But to return to our history of the western hemisphere. After the  science of Theology had ceased to be cultivated and enjoyed among this  branch of Israel, terrible wars and bloodshed ensued. Governments and  civilization were broken up, cities and countries were overthrown, all  records and vestiges of truth were diligently sought and destroyed, as  far as obtained.    And, finally, the whole face of the country was soaked, as it were, in  blood, and strewed with the dead and dying.    The wild beasts of the forest and fowls of heaven devoured their  flesh, and their bones were left to moulder unburied.    In other instances bodies were heaped up, and covered with mounds of  earth.    All government became extinct, and the countries overrun by tribes and  bands of robbers at war with each other.    In this situation the records of Moroni leave them, in the fifth  century of the Christian era, and much in the same situation, with  some exceptions, the Europeans found them after the lapse of another  thousand years.    Oh! who can contemplate the disgusting deformity, the dark features,  the filthy habits, the idleness, the cruelty, the nakedness, the  poverty, the misery, the sufferings, the ignorance of the descendants  of this once favoured branch of the royal blood of Abraham and Joseph,  and not weep for very anguish, while his bosom yearns, and the  fountains--the depths of his inmost soul, are stirred and moved within  him!    Reader, _all these things have come upon them, on account of the  abuses, the consequent decline, and final loss of the keys and powers,  of the science of Theology_.    But comfort your heart, their redemption is at the door.          CHAPTER V.    KEYS OF THE MYSTERIES OF THE GODHEAD.          Eternal Father, Being without end!      Thy glorious fulness who can comprehend!      Thine own infinitude alone is fraught      With attributes to swell a human thought,      To grasp thy knowledge, or thy nature scan.      As Father of the endless race of man.    \"_This is life eternal: to know the only true and living God, and  Jesus Christ whom he hath sent_.\"    Since the decline of the science of Theology, a mystery, dark and  deep, has shrouded the human mind, in regard to the person and nature  of the Eternal Father, and of Jesus Christ, His son.    Councils of the fathers, and wise men of Christendom, have assembled  again and again, in order to solve the mystery of Godliness, and fix  some standard or creed upon which all parties might rest and be  agreed.    This, however, was not in their power. It is impossible for the world  by its wisdom to find out God. \"_Neither knoweth any man the Father  save the son, and he to whomsoever the son will reveal him_.\"    The key to the science of Theology, is the key of divine revelation.  Without this key, no man, no assemblage of men, ever did, or ever will  know the Eternal Father, or Jesus Christ.    When the key of revelation was lost to man, the knowledge of God was  lost. And as life eternal depended on the knowledge of God, of course  the key of eternal life was also lost.    Oh the mysteries, the absurdities, the contentions, the quarrels, the  bloodshed, the infidelity, the senseless and conflicting theories,  which have grown and multiplied among sectaries on this subject!    Among these theories, we will notice one, which is,"]]]
