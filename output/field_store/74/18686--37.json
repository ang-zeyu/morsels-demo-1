Now this sweet ringing of bells between hiding-place and hiding-place  is the matrimonial oratorio, the discreet summons which every Jack  issues to his Jill. The sequel to the concert may be guessed without  further enquiry; but what it would be impossible to foresee is the  strange finale of the wedding. Behold the father, in this case a real  paterfamilias, in the noblest sense of the word, coming out of his  retreat one day in an unrecognizable state. He is carrying the future,  tight-packed around his hind-legs; he is changing houses laden with a  cluster of eggs the size of peppercorns. His calves are girt, his  thighs are sheathed with the bulky burden; and it covers his back like  a beggar's wallet, completely deforming him.    Whither is he going, dragging himself along, incapable of jumping,  thanks to the weight of his load? He is going, the fond parent, where  the mother refuses to go; he is on his way to the nearest pond, whose  warm waters are indispensable to the tadpoles' hatching and existence.  When the eggs are nicely ripened around his legs under the humid  shelter of a stone, he braves the damp and the daylight, he the  passionate lover of dry land and darkness; he advances by short stages,  his lungs congested with fatigue. The pond is far away, perhaps; no  matter: the plucky pilgrim will find it.    He's there. Without delay, he dives, despite his profound antipathy to  bathing; and the cluster of eggs is instantly removed by the legs  rubbing against each other. The eggs are now in their element; and the  rest will be accomplished of itself. Having fulfilled his obligation to  go right under, the father hastens to return to his well-sheltered  home. He is scarcely out of sight before the little black tadpoles are  hatched and playing about. They were but waiting for the contact of the  water in order to burst their shells.    Among the singers in the July gloaming, one alone, were he able to vary  his notes, could vie with the Toad's harmonious bells. This is the  little Scops-owl, that comely nocturnal bird of prey, with the round  gold eyes. He sports on his forehead two small feathered horns which  have won for him in the district the name of Machoto banarudo, the  Horned Owl. His song, which is rich enough to fill by itself the still  night air, is of a nerve-shattering monotony. With imperturbable and  measured regularity, for hours on end, \"kew, kew,\" the bird spits out  its cantata to the moon.    One of them has arrived at this moment, driven from the plane-trees in  the square by the din of the rejoicings, to demand my hospitality. I  can hear him in the top of a cypress near by. From up there, dominating  the lyrical assembly, at regular intervals he cuts into the vague  orchestration of the Grasshoppers and the Toads.    His soft note is contrasted, intermittently, with a sort of Cat's mew,  coming from another spot. This is the call of the Common Owl, the  meditative bird of Minerva. After hiding all day in the seclusion of a  hollow olive-tree, he started on his wanderings when the shades of  evening began to fall. Swinging along with a sinuous flight, he came  from somewhere in the neighbourhood to the pines in my enclosure,  whence he mingles his harsh mewing, slightly softened by distance, with  the general concert.    The Green Grasshopper's clicking is too faint to be clearly perceived  amidst these clamourers; all that reaches me is the least ripple, just  noticeable when there is a moment's silence. He possesses as his  apparatus of sound only a modest drum and scraper, whereas they, more  highly privileged, have their bellows, the lungs, which send forth a  column of vibrating air. There is no comparison possible. Let us return  to the insects.    One of these, though inferior in size and no less sparingly equipped,  greatly surpasses the Grasshopper in nocturnal rhapsodies. I speak of  the pale and slender Italian Cricket (Oecanthus pellucens, Scop.), who  is so puny that you dare not take him up for fear of crushing him. He  makes music everywhere among the rosemary-bushes, while the Glow-worms  light up their blue lamps to complete the revels. The delicate  instrumentalist consists chiefly of a pair of large wings, thin and  gleaming as strips of mica. Thanks to these dry sails, he fiddles away  with an intensity capable of drowning the Toads' fugue. His performance  suggests, but with more brilliancy, more tremolo in the execution, the  song of the Common Black Cricket. Indeed the mistake would certainly be  made by any one who did not know that, by the time the very hot weather  comes, the true Cricket, the chorister of spring, has disappeared. His  pleasant violin has been succeeded by another more pleasant still and  worthy of special study. We shall return to him at an opportune moment.    These then, limiting ourselves to select specimens, are the principal  participants in this musical evening: the Scops-owl, with his  languorous solos; the Toad, that tinkler of sonatas; the Italian  Cricket, who scrapes the first string of a violin; and the Green  Grasshopper, who seems to beat a tiny steel triangle.    We are celebrating to-day, with greater uproar than conviction, the new  era, dating politically from the fall of the Bastille; they, with  glorious indifference to human things, are celebrating the festival of  the sun, singing the happiness of existence, sounding the loud hosanna  of the July heats.    What care they for man and his fickle rejoicings! For whom or for what  will our squibs be spluttering a few years hence? Far-seeing indeed  would he be who could answer the question. Fashions change and bring us  the unexpected. The time-serving rocket spreads its sheaf of sparks for  the public enemy of yesterday, who has become the idol of to-day.  Tomorrow it will go up for somebody else.    In a century or two, will any one, outside the historians, give a  thought to the taking of the Bastille? It is very doubtful. We shall  have other joys and also other cares.    Let us look a little farther ahead. A day will come, so everything  seems to tell us, when, after making progress upon progress, man will  succumb, destroyed by the excess of what he calls civilization. Too  eager to play the god, he cannot hope for the animal's placid  longevity; he will have disappeared when the little Toad is still  saying his litany, in company with the Grasshopper, the Scops-owl and  the others. They were singing on this planet before us; they will sing  after us, celebrating what can never change, the fiery glory of the  sun.    I will dwell no longer on this festival and will become once more the  naturalist, anxious to obtain information concerning the private life  of the insect. The Green Grasshopper (Locusta viridissima, Lin.) does  not appear to be common in my neighbourhood. Last year, intending to  make a study of this insect and finding my efforts to hunt it  fruitless, I was obliged to have recourse to the good offices of a  forest-ranger, who sent me a pair of couples from the Lagarde plateau,  that bleak district where the beech-tree begins its escalade of the  Ventoux.    Now and then freakish fortune takes it into her head to smile upon the  persevering. What was not to be found last year has become almost  common this summer. Without leaving my narrow enclosure, I obtain as  many Grasshoppers as I could wish. I hear them rustling at night in the  green thickets. Let us make the most of the windfall, which perhaps  will not occur again.    In the month of June my treasures are installed, in a sufficient number  of couples, under a wire cover standing on a bed of sand in an earthen  pan. It is indeed a magnificent insect, pale-green all over, with two  whitish stripes running down its sides. Its imposing size, its slim  proportions and its great gauze wings make it the most elegant of our  Locustidae. I am enraptured with my captives. What will they teach me?  We shall see. For the moment, we must feed them.    I offer the prisoners a leaf of lettuce. They bite into it, certainly,  but very sparingly and with a scornful tooth. It soon becomes plain  that I am dealing with half-hearted vegetarians. They want something  else: they are beasts of prey, apparently. But what manner of prey? A  lucky chance taught me.    At break of day I was pacing up and down outside my door, when  something fell from the nearest plane-tree with a shrill grating sound.  I ran up and saw a Grasshopper gutting the belly of a struggling  Cicada. In vain the victim buzzed and waved his limbs: the other did  not let go, dipping her head right into the entrails and rooting them  out by small mouthfuls.    I knew what I wanted to know: the attack had taken place up above,  early in the morning, while the Cicada was asleep; and the plunging of  the poor wretch, dissected alive, had made assailant and assailed fall  in a bundle to the ground. Since then I have repeatedly had occasion to  witness similar carnage.    I have even seen the Grasshopper--the height of audacity, this--dart in  pursuit of a Cicada in mad flight. Even so does the Sparrow-hawk pursue  the Swallow in the sky. But the bird of prey here is inferior to the  insect. It attacks a weaker than itself. The Grasshopper, on the other  hand, assaults a colossus, much larger than herself and stronger; and  nevertheless the result of the unequal fight is not in doubt. The  Grasshopper rarely fails with the sharp pliers of her powerful jaws to  disembowel her capture, which, being unprovided with weapons, confines  itself to crying out and kicking.    The main thing is to retain one's hold of the prize, which is not  difficult in somnolent darkness. Any Cicada encountered by the fierce  Locustid on her nocturnal rounds is bound to die a lamentable death.

Body  temperature of turtles were altered little or not at all in the few  seconds the turtles were held and no attempt was made (except for  small juveniles) to insulate them from the warmth of my hands. Data  recorded with body temperature were: air temperature (in shade,  approximately one inch from turtle); ground temperature (or water  temperature); behavior of turtle; weather conditions; nature of  vegetation or other cover; and, time of day. Unless otherwise noted,  temperatures are expressed in degrees Centigrade.    A maximum-minimum thermometer was installed near the buildings at the  Damm Farm. Notes on general weather conditions were made on each visit  to the study area. Additional climatological data were obtained from  the U. S. Weather Stations in Topeka and Lawrence, from records at the  Reservation, and from official bulletins of the U. S. Weather Bureau.    Stomachs and gonads were removed and preserved by standard techniques  soon after specimens were killed. The dates given to gonads were, in  all instances, the dates when the specimens were killed. Eggs were  prepared for incubation in the manner described by Legler (1956).  Females laying or containing eggs used in studies of incubation were  preserved for further studies and comparison with young hatched from  the eggs. Histological preparations were fixed in ten per cent  formalin or Bouin's fluid, embedded in paraffin, and stained with  hematoxalin and eosin.      Terminology    Names used for the epidermal and bony parts of the shell follow the  classification proposed by Carr (1952:35-39). The terms \"scute,\"  \"lamina,\" and \"scale\" are used here more or less interchangeably for  the epidermal parts as are the terms \"plate,\" \"bone,\" and \"element\"  for the bony parts of the shell.    The term \"form\" is used here in the same sense that Stickel (1950:358)  used it in her study of _T. carolina_--to indicate a depression or  cavity made by a turtle in vegetation or soil. Forms correspond  closely in shape and size to shape and size of the turtle. Forms of  _T. ornata_ differ from those of _T. carolina_ chiefly in being made  most often in soil, over which there is a minimum of vegetational  cover. The term \"den\" refers to natural cavities (or cavities of  unknown origin) beneath rocks, in rock fences, or in cut banks. The  term \"burrow,\" unless otherwise noted, refers to burrows made by  animals other than box turtles.          HABITAT AND LIMITING FACTORS      The known range of _T. ornata_ includes the southern half of the  Grassland Biome, part of the Desert Biome, and that part of the  Temperate Deciduous Forest Biome known as the Prairie-Forest Ecotone.  The species is found in microhabitats that differ widely in food  supply, temperature, moisture, and kind of soil. In spite of its  relatively high degree of morphological specialization, _T. ornata_ is  remarkably versatile in regard to habitat requirements.    Ornate box turtles are relatively inconspicuous in natural  surroundings and collectors seldom seek out and obtain specimens under  completely natural conditions as may be done with certain other  reptiles and amphibians by turning rocks, tearing apart logs, or  setting traps. Most series of specimens are obtained by hunting after  rains on roads or other natural breaks in vegetational cover. Detailed  information on habitat preferences is lacking.    Low temperature seems to be an important factor limiting the  distribution of _T. ornata_ in the northern part of its range. Box  turtles, like nearly all other reptiles occurring at these latitudes,  spend the winter in underground hibernacula. The depth to which the  ground freezes in the coldest part of the winter is therefore a  critical factor. The ground freezes to an average depth of 30 inches  or less over most of the range of the species; only in the extreme  northern part of the range (southern South Dakota, southeastern  Wyoming) does the ground freeze to an average depth of as much as 35  inches. Average depth of freezing is, in fact, less than 15 inches  over more than one half the range of the species. The average number  of frost-free days per year ranges from 130 to 140 days in the  northern part of the range to more than 250 days in the southwestern  part of the range.    _Terrapene ornata_ occurs from near sea level to elevations of more  than 5000 feet. Both subspecies are found at both high and low  elevations but _luteola_ is more consistently taken at high elevations  than _ornata_. The latter subspecies commonly occurs at elevations  above 4000 feet on the high plains in extreme western Kansas and  eastern Colorado; the highest elevation from which I have examined  specimens of _T. o. ornata_ is between 4600 and 4700 feet near Akron,  Washington County, Colorado. The greater part of the known range of  _T. o. luteola_ lies above 3000 feet.    Norris and Zweifel (1950:1) observed _T. o. luteola_ on the Jornada  del Muerto, an elongate plain approximately 4500 feet high, in  southeastern Socorro County, New Mexico; box turtles were abundant on  the level part of the plain and on the bordering foothills but not at  higher elevations where the substratum was rocky. The authors  otherwise noted no preference for any kind of soil. The principal  elements of the plant associations in which the turtles were found  were creosote bush, yucca, mesquite, juniper, tarbush, and grasses.  Lewis (1950:3) reported that _T. ornata luteola_ inhabited the  yucca-grassland zone in Dona Ana County, New Mexico; he stated (_op.  cit._: 10) that individuals were commonly found on roads after rains  and in cloudy weather. No specimens were taken at altitudes higher  than 4300 feet.    I have examined specimens of _luteola_ from elevations of  approximately 5500 feet in Cochise County, Arizona, and Lincoln  County, New Mexico. These localities are probably at or near the  maximum elevation at which the species occurs. The texture of the  substrate is the most important factor limiting vertical distribution.  Ornate box turtles, like nearly all other turtles, excavate nests; _T.  ornata_ is a burrower, at least for purposes of hibernation.  Populations of the species, therefore, could not survive in areas of  hard unyielding substrata. Such substrata seem to be the most  important factor limiting altitudinal distribution.    Most of the area in which _T. ornata_ occurs is semiarid or arid.  Average precipitation in the warm season (April through September)  varies from approximately 25 inches in the northeast to less than ten  inches in the southwest. In drier parts of the range, precipitation is  unevenly distributed over the warm season. Long, hot, dry periods are  unfavorable for reptilian activity. _T. ornata_, like many other  reptiles inhabiting dry regions, survives long periods without water  by seeking shelter (usually underground) and remaining quiescent.  Populations of the subspecies _luteola_ live under far more rigorous  conditions in this respect than do the more northern populations.  Specimens of _luteola_ from Arizona that were kept for several years  in the laboratory under dry conditions and fed adequately, but at  infrequent intervals, were able to remain healthy and even to grow  whereas examples of _ornata_ kept under the same conditions soon  languished and died; _luteola_ seems to be physiologically adapted for  existence under arid conditions, where normal activity is sometimes  possible for only a few weeks in the year.    The prairies of Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, and northern Texas seem to  provide the most nearly optimum habitat for the species; in these  regions box turtles are active on a large majority of the days from  April to October in years having average or better than average  precipitation and population density seems to be greater than in the  more arid parts of the range.    Activities of man have probably affected the density of populations of  the ornate box turtle in many parts of its range but appear not to  have acted as limiting factors except in certain areas along the  northern edge of the range (Blanchard, 1923:19-20, 24) where  disruption of grassland through intensive cultivation probably has  excluded the species. Unlike certain other reptiles of the Great  Plains (Fitch, 1955:64), _T. ornata_ seems not to have been  affected--either by direct decimation of populations or by disruption  of habitat--by intensive zoological collecting in restricted areas.  Environmental changes such as those resulting from overgrazing and  erosion, or from protection of the habitat from grazing could be  expected to cause long-term changes in populations of ornate box  turtles.    _Terrapene o. ornata_ is an omnivorous, opportunistic feeder,  primarily insectivorous but able to subsist on nearly any sort of  animal or vegetable food. The general food habits of _luteola_ are  poorly known but probably resemble those of _ornata_. Although kind of  food available probably does not limit the distribution of _T. ornata_  there are indications that it influences population density. In  Kansas, for example, dung insects are an important staple in the diet  and box turtles were found always to be more numerous in areas where  domestic cattle provided an abundant supply of dung than elsewhere. A  similar relationship probably existed in former times between box  turtles and native ungulates. Near extinction of buffalo in the Great  Plains possibly caused a decrease in populations of box turtles. Henry  S. Fitch told me that the number of _T. ornata_ at the Reservation  gradually declined after cattle were removed from the area in 1948.    In summary, the distribution of _T. ornata_ seems to be limited by: 1)  Presence of a substrate too hard to permit digging of nests and "]]]
