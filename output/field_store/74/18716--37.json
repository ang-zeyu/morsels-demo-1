THE BATTLE OF PICARDY    Military Review of the Greatest Battle in History From March 21 to April  17, 1918 On March 21 the Germans began the great battle which military  experts of both sides believe may decide the war. What was indicated in  broad lines was that they wished to reach the Channel by way of the  Somme and thereby isolate most of the British Army and the entire  Belgian and Portuguese Armies in the north. A corollary to such an  isolation would have been a movement south on Paris.    As to the narrower lines of the German military plan, however, they  became clear. The Germans struck from points where their railways  allowed them the greatest possible concentration of troops and at points  where the lines of the Allies, owing to the uncompleted battles of  Flanders and Cambrai and the failures at Lens, St. Quentin, and La Fere  last year, were relatively weak or could be out-manoeuvred with superior  force of men and material.    In the first phase of the battle, which carried the enemy down the Somme  and its southern tributary, the Avre, to within six miles of Amiens, and  to within forty-six miles of the Channel, they first eliminated the  Cambrai salient so as to protect their northern flank and then  concentrated their attack between St. Quentin and La Fere, near the  point where the French and the British Armies joined. The flanks of the  great salient thereby developed, however, made dangerous further  progress down the Somme. On the north it was threatened by the Arras  salient with its protecting ridge of Vimy; on the south by the watershed  of the Oise and Aisne.    Frontal attacks to eliminate the Arras salient and the, Oise-Aisne  watershed having failed, a flanking movement against the former, which  should also have strategic ramifications further north, followed as a  matter of military expediency. Thus on April 9 the second phase began.  Again they sought the line of cleavage between two armies, where  differences of language and tactics made military cohesion  difficult--between the British and the Portuguese on the Lille front. A  successful penetration of this front for a distance of ten miles would  have placed the enemy on the left-rear of Vimy Ridge in the south, and  in the north on the right-rear of Messines Ridge, which protects Ypres,  the capture of which by the British a year ago had made the subsequent  battle of Flanders and their occupation of Passchendaele in the  direction of Roulers possible.    In other words, Vimy Ridge bears the same relation to Arras that  Messines and its contiguous hills do to Ypres, but while the former  ridge also flanks the great German salient stretching down to the Oise,  the latter ridge flanks from the southeast the British salient at Ypres  developed by the battle of Flanders.    In this second phase of the great battle the German penetration, through  military design or expediency, has so far been developed in the  direction of Ypres; not in the direction of Arras.      NUMBER OF MEN ENGAGED    As to the number of men engaged on each side, experts at the front have  been wide apart. It has been understood that Great Britain has in France  3,500,000 rifles, and that of these 675,000 were on the front when the  attack began, thus (if these figures are correct) leaving an army of  reserve and manoeuvre of 2,850,000, minus 150,000 men on leave in  England. It was understood that the number of French rifles available on  the Continent is between 4,000,000 and 5,000,000, of which 1,575,000  were at the front on March 21, leaving 2,425,000 for reserve and  manoeuvre, which to the extent of 500,000 may have been available in the  present battle, with the constant deploying of the French line in the  south and the taking over of ten miles of the British line.    [Illustration]    [Illustration: MAP OF THE BATTLE OF PICARDY. THE CHAIN LINE ON THE EAST  SHOWS BATTLE FRONT MARCH 21, 1918. SHADED SPACE INDICATES GERMAN GAINS  UP TO APRIL 17. BROKEN LINE SHOWS NEW FRONT AT THAT DATE. INTERVENING  LINES INDICATE GERMAN POSITIONS MARCH 24 AND 26.]    The potential strength of the Germans in the western theatre before the  Russian revolution was estimated at 4,500,000 rifles, more than half of  which were on the front. According to Sir Aukland Geddes, the British  Minister of National Service, the secession of Russia added to the  enemy's potential strength on the western front possibly as many as  1,600,000 men, of whom 950,000 were Germans. If we add 1,000,000 to the  4,500,000 German rifles in the west we have the 5,500,000 thus produced  opposing, at least, 8,500,000 Allies, consisting of French, British,  American, Belgian, Portuguese, Russian, and Polish troops. [The British  official estimates on April 17 appear on Page 207.]    Nevertheless, in nearly all the engagements of the battle thus far, the  Allies appear to have been measurably outnumbered in a ratio varying  from three to one to five to three. Up to March 26, aside from the  French being constantly forced to augment their forces in the south,  only the British 3d, 4th, and 5th Armies had been engaged, approximately  numbering 600,000 rifles. Against these, up to the same date, the  Germans had been able to concentrate ninety-seven divisions, or  1,164,000 rifles, with special concentrations of 120,000 rifles against  Bucquoy, on April 6, and 180,000 against the French between Lassigny and  Noyon, on March 27 and April 3. On the subsequent development of the  Lille front the Germans seemed to have been able to concentrate their  forces, where they outnumber the British and Portuguese three to two.      ENORMOUS GERMAN LOSSES    It was inevitable, in the retreat forced on the British from their  static positions, that a large number of men and guns should have been  captured by the enemy--during the first rush the Germans claimed 75,000  and 600 respectively. But the German casualties, owing to their massed  formation, must, according to all accounts, be staggering, having  probably already reached the Verdun maximum of 600,000. The attrition of  their war material must also be enormous. And just as the entire armies  of the Allies outnumber the enemy eight to five, it may be estimated  that their material, actual and immediately available, is 30 per cent.  greater.    The most useful guide to the development of the plans of the enemy,  their modification, transformation, and failure, either transitory or  permanent, is physical geography. The initial impetus of the assault  carried the Germans with \"shock\" and alternating forces beyond a  hypothetical straight line of fifty miles extending from the Scarpe on  the north to the junction of the Ailette and the Oise on the south. This  was done without their moving their heavy guns, probably not even their  mid-calibre guns, from their emplacements.      FIRST DAYS' RESULTS    By March 25 they had covered an area of about 500 square miles and had  penetrated beyond Croisilles, Bapaume, Peronne, Brie, Nesle, and the  forest northeast of Noyon. In the two following days they recovered the  entire battlefield of the Somme, occupied the British railway junction  and supply depot at Albert, drove the British four miles down the Somme,  and took Roye and Noyon from the French, driving the latter across the  Oise. On the 29th the French counterattacked and recovered eight square  miles between Lassigny and Noyon, but west of this position the enemy,  on a twelve-mile front with a penetration of seven miles, enveloped  Montdidier. The next day the Germans gained some ground north of the  Scarpe before Vimy Ridge and obliterated an ally salient with its vertex  at Vrely by straightening their line between the Somme and Montdidier.    From March 29 until April 8 the enemy consolidated his positions on a  front which had been expanded from seventy-five miles, including two  large salients, to 125 miles, including innumerable small ones,  embracing a terrain of about 800 square miles west of the front as it  was on March 20.    On April 3 the enemy was strongly counterattacked by the British at  Ayette and by the French at Plemont, near Lassigny. Similar  counterattacks recovered Hebuterne for the British and Cantigny for the  French on April 5; Beaumont Hamel and a strong position west of Albert  for the British and a flanking position north of Aubvillers for the  French on April 7.    [Illustration: FLANDERS SECTOR OF THE GREAT BATTLE OF PICARDY. THE CHAIN  LINE SHOWS BATTLEFRONT, MARCH 21, 1918. SHADED SPACE INDICATES GERMAN  GAINS UP TO APRIL 17.]    Meanwhile, April 4, the Germans had occupied Hamel and two villages near  Grivesnes, driving out the French, and had made a furious assault upon  the positions of the latter between the Luce rivulet and the Avre River,  but without success.

For of course we should come back to Burgos. The  proud old city seemed to fill all the horizon of thought. How had we  lived so long without it? That the stormy afternoon was not favorable  to exploration mattered little. We peeped down from our balconies into  the ancient streets, half expecting the exiled Cid to come spurring  up, seeking the welcome which we, like all the craven folk of Burgos,  must refuse him.         \"With sixty lances in his train my Cid rode up the town,       The burghers and their dames from all the windows looking down;       And there were tears in every eye, and on each lip one word:       'A worthy vassal--would to God he served a worthy lord!'       Fain would they shelter him, but none durst yield to his desire.       Great was the fear through Burgos town of King Alphonso's ire.       Sealed with his royal seal hath come his letter to forbid       All men to offer harborage or succor to my Cid.       And he that dared to disobey, well did he know the cost--       His goods, his eyes, stood forfeited, his soul and body lost.       A hard and grievous word was that to men of Christian race;       And since they might not greet my Cid, they hid them from his           face.\"    Meanwhile the streets were a living picture-book. Muffled cavaliers,  with cloaks drawn up and hats drawn down till only the dance of  coal-black eyes, full of fire and fun, was visible between, saluted  our balcony with Carnival impertinence. Beggars of both sexes, equally  wound about with tattered shawls, reached up expectant hands as if we  were made of Spanish pennies. A funeral procession passed, with the  pale light of tapers, the chanting of priests, with purple-draped  coffin, and mourners trooping on foot--men only, for in Spain women  never accompany their dead either to church or grave. A troop of  infantry, whose dapper costume outwent itself in the last touch of  bright green gloves, dazzled by, and then came a miscellany of  maskers. It was rather a rag-tag show, take it all in all--red devils  with horns, friars extremely fat, caricatures of English tourists with  tall hats and perky blue eye-glasses, giants, dwarfs, tumblers, and  even a sorry Cid mounted on a sorrier Bavieca. But the climax of  excitement was reached when a novel bull-fight wheeled into view. It  was a stuffed calf this time, set on wheels and propelled by a merry  fellow of the tribe of Joseph, if one might judge by his multi-colored  attire. With white hood, black mask, blue domino, garnet arms, and  yellow legs, he was as cheery as a bit of rainbow out of that sombre  sky. All the people in sight hastened to flock about him, policemen  left their beats, and servant maids their doorways, an itinerant band  of gypsy girls ceased clashing their tambourines, the blind beggar  opened his eyes, and the small boys were in ecstasies. For over an  hour the populace played with that mimic bull in this one spot under  our windows, good-humored _caballeros_ lending their scarfs and cloaks  to delighted urchins, who would thrust these stimulating objects into  the calf's bland face and then run for their lives, while the motley  Mask trundled his precious image in hot pursuit behind them. We were  reminded of the scene months after by an old painting in the Escorial,  depicting an almost identical performance. Spain is not a land of  change.    But that teeth-chattering cold, \"_un frio de todos los demonios_,\"  eased our farewells to Burgos, and night found us dividing the  privileges of a second-class carriage with two black-bearded  Castilians, who slept foot to foot along the leather-cushioned seat on  the one side, while we copied their example on the other. I started  from my first doze at some hubbub of arrival to ask drowsily, \"Is this  Madrid?\" \"Be at peace, senora!\" cooed one of these sable-headed  neighbors, in that tone of humorous indulgence characteristic of the  dons when addressing women and children. \"It is twelve hours yet to  Madrid. Slumber on with tranquil heart.\" So we lay like warriors  taking our rest, with our travelling rugs, in lieu of martial cloaks,  about us, until the east began to glow with rose and fire, revealing a  bleak extent of treeless, tawny steppe.    We had only a few days to give to \"the crowned city\" then, but those  sufficed for business, for a first acquaintance with the _Puerta del  Sol_ and its radiating avenues, a first joy in the peerless _Museo del  Prado_, and a brilliant glimpse of Carnival. We found the great drive  of the _Prado_, on Ash Wednesday afternoon, reserved for carriages and  maskers. Stages were erected along one side of the way, and on the  other the park was closely set with chairs. Stages and chairs were  filled with a well-clad, joyous multitude, diverted awhile from their  pretty labors of shooting roses and showering _confetti_ by the  fascinating panorama before their eyes. The privileged landaus that  held the middle of the road were laden with the loveliest women of  Castile. Carriages, horses, and coachmen were all adorned, but these  showy equipages only served as setting to the high-bred beauty of the  occupants. The cream of Madrid society was there. The adults were  elegantly dressed, but not as masqueraders. The children in the  carriages, however, were often costumed in the picturesque habits of  the provinces--the scarlet cap and striped shawl of the Catalan  peasant, the open velvet waistcoat, puffed trousers, and blue or red  sash of the Valencian, the gayly embroidered mantle of the Andalusian  mountaineer, the cocked hat and tasselled jacket of the gypsy. Moors,  flower girls, fairies, French lords and ladies of the old regime, even  court fools with cap and bells, were brightly imaged by these little  people, to whom the maskers on foot seemed to have left the monopoly  of beauty. The figures darting among the landaus, in and out of which  they leaped with confident impudence, were almost invariably  grotesques--smirking fishwives, staring chimney-sweeps, pucker-mouthed  babies, and scarecrows of every variety. Political satires are sternly  forbidden, and among the few national burlesques, we saw nowhere any  representation of Uncle Sam. He was hardly a subject of the King of  Nonsense then.    Squeaking and gibbering, the maskers, unrebuked, took all manner of  saucy liberties. A stately old gentleman rose from his cushion in a  crested carriage to observe how gallantly a bevy of ladies were  beating off with a hail of _confetti_ and bonbons an imploring  cavalier who ran by their wheels, and when he would have resumed his  seat he found himself dandled on the knees of a grinning Chinaman.  Sometimes a swarm of maskers would beset a favorite carriage,  climbing up beside the coachman and snatching his reins, standing on  the steps and throwing kisses, lying along the back and twitting the  proudest beauty in the ear or making love to the haughtiest. This  all-licensed masker, with his monstrous disguise and affected squeal,  may be a duke or a doorkeeper. Carnival is democracy.    Meanwhile the inevitable small boy, whose Spanish variety is  exceptionally light of heart and heels, gets his own fun out of the  occasion by whisking under the ropes into this reserved avenue and  dodging hither and thither among the vehicles, to the fury of the  mounted police, whose duty it is to keep the public out. One  resplendent rider devoted his full energies for nearly an hour to the  unavailing chase of a nimble little rogue who risked ten of his nine  lives under coaches and in front of horses' hoofs, but always turned  up laughing with a finger at the nose.    Yet this jocund day did not set without its tragedy. A hot-tempered  Madrileno, abroad with his wife, resented the attentions paid her by  one of the maskers and shot him down. The mortally wounded man was  found to be a physician of high repute. This was not the only  misadventure of the afternoon, a lady losing one eye by the blow of a  flying sugar-plum.    Our next night journey was less fortunate than our first, though it  should be remembered that our discomforts were partly due to our  persistency in travelling second-class. The carriage had its full  complement of passengers, and each of our eight companions brought  with him an unlawful excess of small luggage. Valises, boxes, bundles,  sacks, cans, canes, umbrellas wedged us in on every side, while our  own accumulation of grips, shawl-straps, hold-alls, and sketching kit  denied us even the relief of indignation. We all sat bolt upright the  night through in an atmosphere that sickens memory. Not a chink of  window air would those sensitive _caballeros_ endure, while the smoke  of their ever puffing cigarettes clouded the compartment with an  uncanny haze that grew heavier hour by hour. Conversation, which  seldom flagged, became a violent chorus at those intervals when the  conductor burst in for another chapter of his serial wrangle with a  fiery gentleman who refused to pay full fare. Every don in the  carriage, even to the chubby priest nodding in the coziest corner, had  an unalterable conviction as to the rights and wrongs of that  question, and men we had supposed, from their swaying and snoring,  fast asleep, would leap to their feet when the conductor entered,  fling out their hands in vehement gestures, and dash into the midst of  the vociferous dispute. Lazy Spaniards, indeed! We began to wish that  the Peninsula would cultivate repose of manner. Our tempers were  sorely shaken, and when, in the pale chill of dawn, we arrived at  Cordova, sleepless, nauseated, and out of love with humanity, we had  every prospect of passing a wretched forenoon.    Thus it is I am inclined to believe we lay down under an orange tree  and dreamed a dream of the \"Arabian Nights.\" Or perhaps it was only  another freak of"]]]
