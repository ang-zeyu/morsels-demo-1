Kimball, an Apostle (#4)"],[1,", where the head of the family reengaged in his  occupations of farmer and blacksmith, to which he now added that of  builder. He was aided in his new venture by Judge Towsley, of Scipio,  Cayuga County, who had employed him for several months as foreman in a  blacksmith shop.    Heber thus describes the journey from Sheldon to West Bloomfield, with  incidents of their subsequent experience in that then new country:    \"My father took my mother and six children in a sleigh, with one span  of horses, a change of clothing for each of us, and some blankets to  wrap us in; when we reached St. Albans, my father bought each of his  boys a hat, which was the first hat I ever had on my head. We traveled  on Lake Champlain, on the ice, and the wind being very high, my hat  was blown off and lost.    \"We traveled on the ice up to Whitehall, a distance of one hundred and  ten miles, where, spring being open, he traded his sleigh for a wagon  and proceeded to West Bloomfield.    \"He built an academy in West Bloomfield, also two tavern stands and  several private dwellings; he made nearly all of the edge tools, such  as scythes, augers, axes, knives, etc., also plow-shares and  agricultural implements, for the country around, to a distance of  fifty or sixty miles; and sometimes he had eight forges employed at  once.    \"He continued living in West Bloomfield during the 'last war' with  England, which place was on the thoroughfare between Albany and  Buffalo, on what was called 'the public turnpike,' and on which the  soldiery passed during the war (1812-15). It was flourishing times,  there being plenty of business and money, and most men in business  became involved, so that when the war closed bankruptcy became common,  as every merchant, tavern-keeper and grog-shop had a banking  establishment, and issued 'shin-plasters' from one cent up to five  dollars.    \"My father lost the greater portion of his property, which broke him  up in that place. He then moved two and one-half miles east, half way  between East and West Bloomfield, where he bought a farm of a Mr.  Stewart, near a small lake called Stewart's Pond; on this farm there  was a little improvement. Here he established blacksmithing, built a  large tavern stand, barns and other out-houses, and once more set out  an orchard of various kinds of fruit trees.    \"This was in the year 1816, which was called the cold season; the same  year that the black spot was seen on the sun. The following year we  had little to subsist upon; for some three weeks we gathered milk  weeds, and boiled and ate them, not having salt to put on them. It was  with difficulty that bread could be procured.\"    Evidently the elder Kimball was a man of force and energy, qualities  which his son Heber inherited, and in turn transmitted to his  posterity. The Kimballs, with scarcely an exception, are, in this  respect, of just such sterling stuff as their sire and grandsire, and  invariably \"show the mettle of their pasture,\" as colonizers, wherever  their lot is cast.    The limited amount of schooling that Heber received in these days of  his childhood and early youth, extended from his fifth to his  fourteenth year, and was of the quality usually found in the primitive  village schools of the day. He was not an ardent lover of books, but  drew his lessons from life and nature in all their multiplied and  varied phases. It was \"about the time of the great eclipse in 1806\"  that he commenced going to school. The eclipse he \"remembered well,\"  as his father was about starting on a journey, but was obliged to wait  on account of the darkness.    At the age of fourteen he was put to work in his father's blacksmith  shop, and acquired a knowledge of that useful trade. When he was  nineteen, his father having met with further reverses, he was thrown  entirely upon his own resources, and now began to taste the first  bitter experience of his life.    He was a singular compound, in his nature, of courage and timidity, of  weakness and strength; uniting a penchant for mirth with a proneness  to melancholy, and blending the lion-like qualities of a leader among  men, with the bashfulness and lamb-like simplicity of a child.    He was not a coward; a braver man probably never lived than Heber C.  Kimball. His courage, however was not of that questionable kind which  \"knows no fear.\" Rather was it of that superior order, that  Christ-like bravery, which feels danger and yet dares to face it. He  had all the sensitiveness of the poet--for he was both a poet and a  prophet from his mother's womb--and inherited by birthright the power  to feel pleasure or suffer pain, in all its exquisiteness and  intensity.    Hear his own pathetic story of his early hardships:    \"At this time, I saw some days of sorrow; my heart was troubled, and I  suffered much in consequence of fear, bashfulness, and timidity. I  found myself cast abroad upon the world, without a friend to console  my grief. In these heart-aching hours I suffered much for want of food  and the comforts of life, and many times when two or three days  without food to eat, being bashful and not daring to ask for it.    \"After I had spent several weeks in the manner before stated, my  oldest brother, Charles, hearing of my condition, offered to teach me  the potter's trade. I immediately accepted the offer, and continued  with him until I was twenty-one.    \"While living with my brother, he moved into the town of Mendon,  Monroe, County, New York, six miles north of Bloomfield, towards the  city of Rochester, where he again established the potter's business.\"    Here Heber finished learning his trade and commenced working for  wages. Six months later he purchased his brother's business and set up  in the same line for himself, in which he prospered for upwards of ten  years.          CHAPTER II.    A ROMANTIC EPISODE--HEBER'S MARRIAGE WITH VILATE MURRAY--A SOLDIER AND  A FREE MASON--HIS STERN ARRAIGNMENT OF THE ANCIENT ORDER--DEATH OF  HEBER'S FATHER AND MOTHER.      Meanwhile, the sun of love dawned on his horizon. In one of his rides  he chanced to pass, one warm summer day, through the little town of  Victor, in the neighboring County of Ontario. Being thirsty, he drew  rein near a house where a gentleman was at work in the yard, whom he  asked for a drink of water. As the one addressed went to the well for  a fresh bucketful of the cooling liquid, he called to his daughter  Vilate, to fetch a glass from the house, which he filled and sent by  her to the young stranger.    Heber was deeply impressed with the beauty and refined modestly of the  young girl, whose name he understood to be \"Milaty,\" and who was the  flower and pet of her father's family. Lingering as long as propriety  would permit, or the glass of water would hold out, he murmured his  thanks and rode reluctantly away.    How suggestive this incident, of Whittier's pretty tale, \"Maud  Muller:\"        \"Thanks\" said the Judge, \"a sweeter draught      From a fairer hand was never quaffed.\"    It was not long before he again had \"business\" in Victor, and again  became thirsty (?) just opposite the house where the young lady lived.  Seeing the same gentleman in the yard whom he had accosted before, he  hailed him and asked him for a cup of water. This time the owner of  the premises offered to wait upon him in person, but Heber, with the  blunt candor for which he was noted, nearly took the old gentleman's  breath by saying, \"if you please, sir, I'd rather My-Laty would bring  it to me.\"    \"Laty,\" as she was called in the house, accordingly appeared and did  the honors as before, and returned blushing to meet the merriment and  good-natured badinage of her sister and brothers.    She, however, was quite as favorably impressed with the handsome young  stranger, as he with her. More visits followed, acquaintance ripened  into love, and on the 7th of November, 1822, they were married.    Vilate Murray--for that was her name--was the youngest child of  Roswell and Susannah Murray. She was born June 1st, 1806, in Florida,  Montgomery County, New York. At the time of her marriage she was only  in her seventeenth year.    The Murrays, like the Kimballs, were of Scotch descent, and came to  America during the Seven Years' War. As a race they were gentle,  kind-hearted, intelligent and refined. Through many of them ran a vein  of poetry. Vilate herself wrote tender and beautiful verses. She was  an ideal wife for a man like Heber C. Kimball, by whom she was ever  cherished as the treasure that she was.    Heber was now past twenty-one, and fast developing into as fine a  specimen of manhood as one might wish to behold. Tall and powerful of  frame, with piercing black eyes that seemed to read one through, and  before whose searching gaze the guilty could not choose but quail, he  moved with a stateliness and majesty all his own, as far removed from  haughtiness and vain pride, as he from the sphere of the upstart who  mistakes scorn for dignity, and an overbearing manner as an evidence  of gentle blood.    Heber C. Kimball was a humble man, and in his humility, no less than  his kingly stature, consisted his dignity, and no small share of his  greatness. It was his intelligence, earnestness, simplicity, sublime  faith and unwavering integrity to principle that made him great, not  the apparel he wore, nor the mortal clay in which his spirit was  clothed. Nevertheless, nature had given him a noble presence in the  flesh, worthy the godlike stature of his spirit.        \"A combination and a form, indeed,      Where every God did seem to set his seal      To give the world assurance of a man.\"    The son and grandson of a soldier, he had early enrolled in an  independent horse company of the New York State militia. Under Captain  Sawyer, of East Bloomfield, and his successor in command, he trained  fourteen years; one year more would have exempted him from further  military service. He remarks, with"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3534"],[0,"A Complete Account of the Settlement at Port Jackson (#4)"],[1,"out, and had  penetrated their intention from experience, suddenly fell upon them. Our  heroes were immediately routed, and separately endeavoured to effect their  escape by any means which were left. In their flight one was killed, and  seven were wounded, for the most part very severely: those who had the  good fortune to outstrip their comrades and arrive in camp, first gave the  alarm; and a detachment of marines, under an officer, was ordered to march  to their relief. The officer arrived too late to repel the Indians; but  he brought in the body of the man that was killed, and put an end to  the pursuit. The governor was justly incensed at what had happened, and  instituted the most rigorous scrutiny into the cause which had produced it.  At first the convicts were unanimous in affirming, that they were quietly  picking sweet-tea*, when they were without provocation assaulted by the  natives, with whom they had no wish to quarrel. Some of them, however,  more irresolute than the rest, at last disclosed the purpose for which the  expedition had been undertaken; and the whole were ordered to be severely  flogged: Arabanoo was present at the infliction of the punishment; and was  made to comprehend the cause and the necessity of it; but he displayed on  the occasion symptoms of disgust and terror only.    [*A vegetable creeper found growing on the rocks, which yields, on infusion  in hot water, a sweet astringent taste, whence it derives its name: to  its virtues the healthy state of the soldiery and convicts must be greatly  attributed. It was drank universally.]    On the 24th instant the 'Supply' arrived from Norfolk Island, and Lord Howe  Island, bringing from the latter place three turtles.    An awful and terrible example of justice took place towards the close of  this month, which I record with regret, but which it would be disingenuous  to suppress. Six marines, the flower of our battalion, were hanged by the  public executioner, on the sentence of a criminal court, composed entirely  of their own officers, for having at various times robbed the public stores  of flour, meat, spirits, tobacco, and many other articles.          CHAPTER IV.        Transactions of the Colony in April and May, 1789.      An extraordinary calamity was now observed among the natives. Repeated  accounts brought by our boats of finding bodies of the Indians in all the  coves and inlets of the harbour, caused the gentlemen of our hospital  to procure some of them for the purposes of examination and anatomy. On  inspection, it appeared that all the parties had died a natural death:  pustules, similar to those occasioned by the small pox, were thickly spread  on the bodies; but how a disease, to which our former observations had led  us to suppose them strangers, could at once have introduced itself, and  have spread so widely, seemed inexplicable.* Whatever might be the cause,  the existence of the malady could no longer be doubted. Intelligence  was brought that an Indian family lay sick in a neighbouring cove: the  governor, attended by Arabanoo, and a surgeon, went in a boat immediately  to the spot. Here they found an old man stretched before a few lighted  sticks, and a boy of nine or ten years old pouring water on his head, from  a shell which he held in his hand: near them lay a female child dead, and  a little farther off, its unfortunate mother: the body of the woman shewed  that famine, superadded to disease, had occasioned her death: eruptions  covered the poor boy from head to foot; and the old man was so reduced,  that he was with difficulty got into the boat. Their situation rendered  them incapable of escape, and they quietly submitted to be led away.  Arabanoo, contrary to his usual character, seemed at first unwilling to  render them any assistance; but his shyness soon wore off, and he treated  them with the kindest attention. Nor would he leave the place until he had  buried the corpse of the child: that of the woman he did not see from its  situation; and as his countrymen did not point it out, the governor ordered  that it should not be shown to him. He scooped a grave in the sand with his  hands, of no peculiarity of shape, which he lined completely with grass,  and put the body into it, covering it also with grass; and then he filled  up the hole, and raised over it a small mound with the earth which had  been removed. Here the ceremony ended, unaccompanied by any invocation to a  superior being, or any attendant circumstance whence an inference of their  religious opinions could be deduced.    [*No solution of this difficulty had been given when I left the country, in  December, 1791. I can, therefore, only propose queries for the ingenuity of  others to exercise itself upon: is it a disease indigenous to the country?  Did the French ships under Monsieur de Peyrouse introduce it? Let it be  remembered that they had now been departed more than a year; and we had  never heard of its existence on board of them. Had it travelled across the  continent from its western shore, where Dampier and other European voyagers  had formerly landed? Was it introduced by Mr. Cook? Did we give it birth  here? No person among us had been afflicted with the disorder since we had  quitted the Cape of Good Hope, seventeen months before. It is true, that  our surgeons had brought out variolous matter in bottles; but to infer  that it was produced from this cause were a supposition so wild as to be  unworthy of consideration.]      An uninhabited house, near the hospital, was allotted for their reception,  and a cradle prepared for each of them. By the encouragement of Arabanoo,  who assured them of protection, and the soothing behaviour of our medical  gentlemen, they became at once reconciled to us, and looked happy and  grateful at the change of their situation. Sickness and hunger had,  however, so much exhausted the old man, that little hope was entertained  of his recovery. As he pointed frequently to his throat, at the instance of  Arabanoo, he tried to wash it with a gargle which was given to him; but  the obstructed, tender state of the part rendered it impracticable. 'Bado,  bado' (water), was his cry: when brought to him, he drank largely at  intervals of it. He was equally importunate for fire, being seized with  shivering fits; and one was kindled. Fish were produced, to tempt him to  eat; but he turned away his head, with signs of loathing. Nanbaree (the  boy), on the contrary, no sooner saw them than he leaped from his cradle,  and eagerly seizing them, began to cook them. A warm bath being prepared,  they were immersed in it; and after being thoroughly cleansed, they had  clean shirts put on them, and were again laid in bed.    The old man lived but a few hours. He bore the pangs of dissolution with  patient composure; and though he was sensible to the last moment, expired  almost without a groan. Nanbaree appeared quite unmoved at the event;  and surveyed the corpse of his father without emotion, simply exclaiming,  'boee' (dead). This surprised us; as the tenderness and anxiety of the old  man about the boy had been very moving. Although barely able to raise his  head, while so much strength was left to him, he kept looking into his  child's cradle; he patted him gently on the bosom; and, with dying eyes,  seemed to recommend him to our humanity and protection. Nanbaree was  adopted by Mr. White, surgeon-general of the settlement, and became  henceforth one of his family.    Arabanoo had no sooner heard of the death of his countryman, than he  hastened to inter him. I was present at the ceremony, in company with the  governor, captain Ball, and two or three other persons. It differed, by  the accounts of those who were present at the funeral of the girl, in no  respect from what had passed there in the morning, except that the grave  was dug by a convict. But I was informed, that when intelligence of the  death reached Arabanoo, he expressed himself with doubt whether he should  bury, or burn the body; and seemed solicitous to ascertain which ceremony  would be most gratifying to the governor.    Indeed, Arabanoo's behaviour, during the whole of the transactions of  this day, was so strongly marked by affection to his countryman, and by  confidence in us, that the governor resolved to free him from all farther  restraint, and at once to trust to his generosity, and the impression which  our treatment of him might have made, for his future residence among us:  the fetter was accordingly taken off his leg.    In the evening, captain Ball and I crossed the harbour, and buried the  corpse of the woman before mentioned.    Distress continued to drive them in upon us. Two more natives, one of them  a young man, and the other his sister, a girl of fourteen years old,  were brought in by the governor's boat, in a most deplorable state of  wretchedness from the smallpox. The sympathy and affection of Arabanoo,  which had appeared languid in the instance of Nanbaree and his father, here  manifested themselves immediately. We conjectured that a difference of  the tribes to which they belonged might cause the preference; but nothing  afterwards happened to strengthen or confirm such a supposition. The young  man died at the end of three days: the girl recovered, and was received  as an inmate, with great kindness, in the family of Mrs Johnson,  the clergyman's wife. Her name was Booron; but from our mistake of  pronunciation she acquired that of Abaroo, by which she was generally  known, and by which she will always be called in this work. She shewed, at  the death of her brother more feeling than Nanbaree had witnessed for the  loss of his father. When she found him dying, she crept to his side, and  lay by him until forced by the cold to retire. No exclamation, or other  sign of grief, however, escaped her for what had happened.    May 1789.
