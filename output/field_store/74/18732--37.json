In hardly any case had they any settled abode or  fixed dwelling-places. The Iroquois and some Algonquins built Long  Houses of wood and made stockade forts of heavy timber. But not even  these tribes, who represented the furthest advance towards civilization  among the savages of North America, made settlements in the real sense.  They knew nothing of the use of the metals. Such poor weapons and tools  as they had were made of stone, of wood, and of bone. It is true that  ages ago prehistoric men had dug out copper from the mines that lie  beside Lake Superior, for the traces of their operations there are  still found. But the art of working metals probably progressed but a  little way and then was lost,--overwhelmed perhaps in some ancient  savage conquest. The Indians found by Cartier and Champlain knew  nothing of the melting of metals for the manufacture of tools. Nor had  they anything but the most elementary form of agriculture. They planted  corn in the openings of the forest, but they did not fell trees to make  a clearing or plough the ground. The harvest provided by nature and the  products of the chase were their sole sources of supply, and in their  search for this food so casually offered they moved to and fro in the  depths of the forest or roved endlessly upon the plains. One great  advance, and only one, they had been led to make. The waterways of  North America are nature's highway through the forest. The bark canoe  in which the Indians floated over the surface of the Canadian lakes and  rivers is a marvel of construction and wonderfully adapted to its  purpose: This was their great invention. In nearly all other respects  the Indians of Canada had not emerged even from savagery to that stage  half way to civilization which is called barbarism.    These Canadian aborigines seem to have been few in number. It is  probable that, when the continent was discovered, Canada, from the  Atlantic to the Pacific, contained about 220,000 natives--about half as  many people as are now found in Toronto. They were divided into tribes  or clans, among which we may distinguish certain family groups spread  out over great areas.    Most northerly of all was the great tribe of the Eskimos, who were  found all the way from Greenland to Northern Siberia. The name Eskimo  was not given by these people to themselves. It was used by the Abnaki  Indians in describing to the whites the dwellers of the far north, and  it means 'the people who eat raw meat.' The Eskimo called and still  call themselves the Innuit, which means 'the people.'    The exact relation of the Eskimo to the other races of the continent is  hard to define. From the fact that the race was found on both sides of  the Bering Sea, and that its members have dark hair and dark eyes, it  was often argued that they were akin to the Mongolians of China. This  theory, however, is now abandoned. The resemblance in height and colour  is only superficial, and a more careful view of the physical make-up of  the Eskimo shows him to resemble the other races of America far more  closely than he resembles those of Asia. A distinguished American  historian, John Fiske, believed that the Eskimos are the last remnants  of the ancient cave-men who in the Stone Age inhabited all the northern  parts of Europe. Fiske's theory is that at this remote period  continuous land stretched by way of Iceland and Greenland from Europe  to America, and that by this means the race of cave-men was able to  extend itself all the way from Norway and Sweden to the northern coasts  of America. In support of this view he points to the strangely  ingenious and artistic drawings of the Eskimos. These drawings are made  on ivory and bone, and are so like the ancient bone-pictures found  among the relics of the cave-men of Europe that they can scarcely be  distinguished.    The theory is only a conjecture. It is certain that at one time the  Eskimo race extended much farther south than it did when the white men  came to America; in earlier days there were Eskimos far south of Hudson  Bay, and perhaps even south of the Great Lakes.    As a result of their situation the Eskimos led a very different life  from that of the Indians to the south. They must rely on fishing and  hunting for food. In that almost treeless north they had no wood to  build boats or houses, and no vegetables or plants to supply them  either with food or with the materials of industry. But the very rigour  of their surroundings called forth in them a marvellous ingenuity. They  made boats of seal skins stretched tight over walrus bones, and clothes  of furs and of the skins and feathers of birds. They built winter  houses with great blocks of snow put together in the form of a bowl  turned upside down. They heated their houses by burning blubber or fat  in dish-like lamps chipped out of stones. They had, of course, no  written literature. They were, however, not devoid of art. They had  legends and folk-songs, handed down from generation to generation with  the utmost accuracy. In the long night of the Arctic winter they  gathered in their huts to hear strange monotonous singing by their  bards: a kind of low chanting, very strange to European ears, and  intended to imitate the sounds of nature, the murmur of running waters  and the sobbing of the sea. The Eskimos believed in spirits and  monsters whom they must appease with gifts and incantations. They  thought that after death the soul either goes below the earth to a  place always warm and comfortable, or that it is taken up into the cold  forbidding brightness of the polar sky. When the aurora borealis, or  Northern Lights, streamed across the heavens, the Eskimos thought it  the gleam of the souls of the dead visible in their new home.    Farthest east of all the British North American Indians were the  Beothuks. Their abode was chiefly Newfoundland, though they wandered  also in the neighbourhood of the Strait of Belle Isle and along the  north shore of the Gulf of St Lawrence. They were in the lowest stage  of human existence and lived entirely by hunting and fishing. Unlike  the Eskimos they had no dogs, and so stern were the conditions of their  life that they maintained with difficulty the fight against the rigour  of nature. The early explorers found them on the rocky coasts of Belle  Isle, wild and half clad. They smeared their bodies with red ochre,  bright in colour, and this earned for them the name of Red Indians.  From the first, they had no friendly relations with the Europeans who  came to their shores, but lived in a state of perpetual war with them.  The Newfoundland fishermen and settlers hunted down the Red Indians as  if they were wild beasts, and killed them at sight. Now and again, a  few members of this unhappy race were carried home to England to be  exhibited at country fairs before a crowd of grinning yokels who paid a  penny apiece to look at the 'wild men.'    Living on the mainland, next to the red men of Newfoundland lay the  great race of the Algonquins, spread over a huge tract of country, from  the Atlantic coast to the head of the Great Lakes, and even farther  west. The Algonquins were divided into a great many tribes, some of  whose names are still familiar among the Indians of to-day. The Micmacs  of Nova Scotia, the Malecite of New Brunswick, the Naskapi of Quebec,  the Chippewa of Ontario, and the Crees of the prairie, are of this  stock. It is even held that the Algonquins are to be considered typical  specimens of the American race. They were of fine stature, and in  strength and muscular development were quite on a par with the races of  the Old World. Their skin was copper-coloured, their lips and noses  were thin, and their hair in nearly all cases was straight and black.  When the Europeans first saw the Algonquins they had already made some  advance towards industrial civilization. They built huts of woven  boughs, and for defence sometimes surrounded a group of huts with a  palisade of stakes set up on end. They had no agriculture in the true  sense, but they cultivated Indian corn and pumpkins in the openings of  the forests, and also the tobacco plant, with the virtues of which they  were well acquainted. They made for themselves heavy and clumsy pottery  and utensils of wood, they wove mats out of rushes for their houses,  and they made clothes from the skin of the deer, and head-dresses from  the bright feathers of birds. Of the metals they knew, at the time of  the discovery of America, hardly anything. They made some use of  copper, which they chipped and hammered into rude tools and weapons.  But they knew nothing of melting the metals, and their arrow-heads and  spear-points were made, for the most part, not of metals, but of stone.  Like other Indians, they showed great ingenuity in fashioning bark  canoes of wonderful lightness.    We must remember, however, that with nearly all the aborigines of  America, at least north of Mexico, the attempt to utilize the materials  and forces supplied by nature had made only slight and painful  progress. We are apt to think that it was the mere laziness of the  Indians which prevented more rapid advance. It may be that we do not  realize their difficulties. When the white men first came these rude  peoples were so backward and so little trained in using their faculties  that any advance towards art and industry was inevitably slow and  difficult. This was also true, no doubt, of the peoples who, long  centuries before, had been in the same degree of development in Europe,  and had begun the intricate tasks which a growth towards civilization  involved. The historian Robertson describes in a vivid passage the  backward state of the savage tribes of America. 'The most simple  operation,' he says, 'was to them an undertaking of immense difficulty  and labour. To fell a tree with no other implements than hatchets of  stone was employment for a month. ."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4075"],[0,"The Intrusion of Jimmy (#4)"],[1," the best of a bad job. He had not disdained the  dollars that came as single spies rather than in battalions. Until  the time should arrive when he might angle for whales, he was  prepared to catch sprats.    Much may be done, even on a small scale, by perseverance. In those  early days, Mr. McEachern's observant eye had not failed to notice  certain peddlers who obstructed the traffic, divers tradesmen who  did the same by the side-walk, and of restaurant keepers not a few  with a distaste for closing at one o'clock in the morning. His  researches in this field were not unprofitable. In a reasonably  short space of time, he had put by the three thousand dollars that  were the price of his promotion to detective-sergeant. He did not  like paying three thousand dollars for promotion, but there must be  sinking of capital if an investment is to prosper. Mr. McEachern  \"came across,\" and climbed one more step up the ladder.    As detective-sergeant, he found his horizon enlarged. There was more  scope for a man of parts. Things moved more rapidly. The world  seemed full of philanthropists, anxious to \"dress his front\" and do  him other little kindnesses. Mr. McEachern was no churl. He let them  dress his front. He accepted the little kindnesses. Presently, he  found that he had fifteen thousand dollars to spare for any small  flutter that might take his fancy. Singularly enough, this was the  precise sum necessary to make him a captain.    He became a captain. And it was then that he discovered that El  Dorado was no mere poet's dream, and that Tom Tiddler's Ground,  where one might stand picking up gold and silver, was as definite a  locality as Brooklyn or the Bronx. At last, after years of patient  waiting, he stood like Moses on the mountain, looking down into the  Promised Land. He had come to where the Big Money was.    The captain was now reading the little note-book wherein he kept a  record of his investments, which were numerous and varied. That the  contents were satisfactory was obvious at a glance. The smile on his  face and the reposeful position of his jaw were proof enough of  that. There were notes relating to house-property, railroad shares,  and a dozen other profitable things. He was a rich man.    This was a fact that was entirely unsuspected by his neighbors, with  whom he maintained somewhat distant relations, accepting no  invitations and giving none. For Mr. McEachern was playing a big  game. Other eminent buccaneers in his walk of life had been content  to be rich men in a community where moderate means were the rule.  But about Mr. McEachern there was a touch of the Napoleonic. He  meant to get into society--and the society he had selected was that  of England. Other people have noted the fact--which had impressed  itself very firmly on the policeman's mind--that between England and  the United States there are three thousand miles of deep water. In  the United States, he would be a retired police-captain; in England,  an American gentleman of large and independent means with a  beautiful daughter.    That was the ruling impulse in his life--his daughter Molly. Though,  if he had been a bachelor, he certainly would not have been  satisfied to pursue a humble career aloof from graft, on the other  hand, if it had not been for Molly, he would not have felt, as he  gathered in his dishonest wealth, that he was conducting a sort of  holy war. Ever since his wife had died, in his detective-sergeant  days, leaving him with a year-old daughter, his ambitions had been  inseparably connected with Molly.    All his thoughts were on the future. This New York life was only a  preparation for the splendors to come. He spent not a dollar  unnecessarily. When Molly was home from school, they lived together  simply and quietly in the small house which Molly's taste made so  comfortable. The neighbors, knowing his profession and seeing the  modest scale on which he lived, told one another that here at any  rate was a policeman whose hands were clean of graft. They did not  know of the stream that poured week by week and year by year into  his bank, to be diverted at intervals into the most profitable  channels. Until the time should come for the great change, economy  was his motto. The expenses of his home were kept within the bounds  of his official salary. All extras went to swell his savings.    He closed his book with a contented sigh, and lighted another cigar.  Cigars were his only personal luxury. He drank nothing, ate the  simplest food, and made a suit of clothes last for quite an unusual  length of time; but no passion for economy could make him deny  himself smoke.    He sat on, thinking. It was very late, but he did not feel ready for  bed. A great moment had arrived in his affairs. For days, Wall  Street had been undergoing one of its periodical fits of jumpiness.  There had been rumors and counter-rumors, until finally from the  confusion there had soared up like a rocket the one particular stock  in which he was most largely interested. He had unloaded that  morning, and the result had left him slightly dizzy. The main point  to which his mind clung was that the time had come at last. He could  make the great change now at any moment that suited him.    He was blowing clouds of smoke and gloating over this fact when the  door opened, admitting a bull-terrier, a bull-dog, and in the wake  of the procession a girl in a kimono and red slippers.          CHAPTER IV    MOLLY      \"Why, Molly,\" said the policeman, \"what are you doing out of bed? I  thought you were asleep.\"    He placed a huge arm around her, and drew her to his lap. As she sat  there, his great bulk made her seem smaller than she really was.  With her hair down and her little red slippers dangling half a yard  from the floor, she seemed a child. McEachern, looking at her, found  it hard to realize that nineteen years had passed since the moment  when the doctor's raised eyebrows had reproved him for his  monosyllabic reception of the news that the baby was a girl.    \"Do you know what the time is?\" he said. \"Two o'clock.\"    \"Much too late for you to be sitting here smoking,\" said Molly,  severely. \"How many cigars do you smoke a day? Suppose you had  married someone who wouldn't let you smoke!\"    \"Never stop your husband smoking, my dear. That's a bit of advice  for you when you're married.\"    \"I'm never going to marry. I'm going to stop at home, and darn your  socks.\"    \"I wish you could,\" he said, drawing her closer to him. \"But one of  these days you're going to marry a prince. And now run back to bed.  It's much too late--\"    \"It's no good, father dear. I couldn't get to sleep. I've been  trying hard for hours. I've counted sheep till I nearly screamed.  It's Rastus' fault. He snores so!\"    Mr. McEachern regarded the erring bull-dog sternly.    \"Why do you have the brutes in your room?\"    \"Why, to keep the boogaboos from getting me, of course. Aren't you  afraid of the boogaboos getting you? But you're so big, you wouldn't  mind. You'd just hit them. And they're not brutes--are you,  darlings? You're angels, and you nearly burst yourselves with joy  because auntie had come back from England, didn't you? Father, did  they miss me when I was gone? Did they pine away?\"    \"They got like skeletons. We all did.\"    \"You?\"    \"I should say so.\"    \"Then, why did you send me away to England?\"    \"I wanted you to see the country. Did you like it?\"    \"I hated being away from you.\"    \"But you liked the country?\"    \"I loved it.\"    McEachern drew a breath of relief. The only possible obstacle to the  great change did not exist.    \"How would you like to go back to England, Molly?\"    \"To England! When I've just come home?\"    \"If I went, too?\"    Molly twisted around so that she could see his face better.    \"There's something the matter with you, father. You're trying to say  something, and I want to know what it is. Tell me quick, or I'll  make Rastus bite you!\"    \"It won't take long, dear. I've been lucky in some investments while  you were away, and I'm going to leave the force, and take you over  to England, and find a prince for you to marry--if you think you  would like it.\"    \"Father! It'll be perfectly splendid!\"    \"We'll start fair in England, Molly. I'll just be John McEachern,  from America, and, if anybody wants to know anything about me, I'm a  man who has made money on Wall Street--and that's no lie--and has  come over to England to spend it.\"    Molly gave his arm a squeeze. Her eyes were wet.    \"Father, dear,\" she whispered, \"I believe you've been doing it all  for me. You've been slaving away for me ever since I was born,  stinting yourself and saving money just so that I could have a good  time later on.\"    \"No, no!\"    \"It's true,\" she said. She turned on him with a tremulous laugh. \"I  don't believe you've had enough to eat for years. I believe you're  all skin and bone. Never mind. To-morrow, I'll take you out and buy  you the best dinner you've ever had, out of my own money. We'll go  to Sherry's, and you shall start at the top of the menu, and go  straight down it till you've had enough.\"    \"That will make up for everything. And, now, don't you think you  ought to be going to bed? You'll be losing all that color you got on  the ship.\"    \"Soon--not just yet. I haven't seen you for such ages!\" She pointed  at the bull-terrier. \"Look at Tommy, standing there and staring. He  can't believe I've really come back. Father, there was a man on the  Lusitania with eyes exactly like Tommy's--all brown and bright--and  he used to stand and stare just like Tommy's doing.\"    \"If I had been there,\" said her father wrathfully, \"I'd have knocked  his head off.\"    \"No, you wouldn't, because I'm sure he was really a very nice young  man. He had a chin rather like yours, father. Besides, you couldn't  have got at him to knock his head off, because he was traveling  second-class.\"    \"Second-class? Then, you "]]]
