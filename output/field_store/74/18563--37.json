[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31469"],[0,"The Shunned House (#4)"],[1,"history of the site  from its very settlement in 1636--or even before, if any Narragansett  Indian legend could be unearthed to supply the data. I found, at the  start, that the land had been part of the long strip of home lot granted  originally to John Throckmorton; one of many similar strips beginning at  the Town Street beside the river and extending up over the hill to a  line roughly corresponding with the modern Hope Street. The Throckmorton  lot had later, of course, been much subdivided; and I became very  assiduous in tracing that section through which Back or Benefit Street  was later run. It had, as rumor indeed said, been the Throckmorton  graveyard; but as I examined the records more carefully, I found that  the graves had all been transferred at an early date to the North Burial  Ground on the Pawtucket West Road.    Then suddenly I came--by a rare piece of chance, since it was not in the  main body of records and might easily have been missed--upon something  which aroused my keenest eagerness, fitting in as it did with several of  the queerest phases of the affair. It was the record of a lease, in  1697, of a small tract of ground to an Etienne Roulet and wife. At last  the French element had appeared--that, and another deeper element of  horror which the name conjured up from the darkest recesses of my weird  and heterogeneous reading--and I feverishly studied the platting of the  locality as it had been before the cutting through and partial  straightening of Back Street between 1747 and 1758. I found what I had  half expected, that where the shunned house now stood the Roulets had  laid out their graveyard behind a one-story and attic cottage, and that  no record of any transfer of graves existed. The document, indeed, ended  in much confusion; and I was forced to ransack both the Rhode Island  Historical Society and Shepley Library before I could find a local door  which the name of Etienne Roulet would unlock. In the end I did find  something; something of such vague but monstrous import that I set about  at once to examine the cellar of the shunned house itself with a new and  excited minuteness.    The Roulets, it seemed, had come in 1696 from East Greenwich, down the  west shore of Narragansett Bay. They were Huguenots from Caude, and had  encountered much opposition before the Providence selectmen allowed them  to settle in the town. Unpopularity had dogged them in East Greenwich,  whither they had come in 1686, after the revocation of the Edict of  Nantes, and rumor said that the cause of dislike extended beyond mere  racial and national prejudice, or the land disputes which involved other  French settlers with the English in rivalries which not even Governor  Andros could quell. But their ardent Protestantism--too ardent, some  whispered--and their evident distress when virtually driven from the  village down the bay, had moved the sympathy of the town fathers. Here  the strangers had been granted a haven; and the swarthy Etienne Roulet,  less apt at agriculture than at reading queer books and drawing queer  diagrams, was given a clerical post in the warehouse at Pardon  Tillinghast's wharf, far south in Town Street. There had, however, been  a riot of some sort later on--perhaps forty years later, after old  Roulet's death--and no one seemed to hear of the family after that.    For a century and more, it appeared, the Roulets had been well  remembered and frequently discussed as vivid incidents in the quiet  life of a New England seaport. Etienne's son Paul, a surly fellow whose  erratic conduct had probably provoked the riot which wiped out the  family, was particularly a source of speculation; and though Providence  never shared the witchcraft panics of her Puritan neighbors, it was  freely intimated by old wives that his prayers were neither uttered at  the proper time nor directed toward the proper object. All this had  undoubtedly formed the basis of the legend known by old Maria Robbins.  What relation it had to the French ravings of Rhoby Harris and other  inhabitants of the shunned house, imagination or future discovery alone  could determine. I wondered how many of those who had known the legends  realized that additional link with the terrible which my wider reading  had given me; that ominous item in the annals of morbid horror which  tells of the creature _Jacques Roulet, of Caude_, who in 1598 was  condemned to death as a demoniac but afterward saved from the stake by  the Paris parliament and shut in a madhouse. He had been found covered  with blood and shreds of flesh in a wood, shortly after the killing and  rending of a boy by a pair of wolves. One wolf was seen to lope away  unhurt. Surely a pretty hearthside tale, with a queer significance as to  name and place; but I decided that the Providence gossips could not have  generally known of it. Had they known, the coincidence of names would  have brought some drastic and frightened action--indeed, might not its  limited whispering have precipitated the final riot which erased the  Roulets from the town?           *       *       *       *       *    I now visited the accursed place with increased frequency; studying the  unwholesome vegetation of the garden, examining all the walls of the  building, and poring over every inch of the earthen cellar floor.  Finally, with Carrington Harris's permission, I fitted a key to the  disused door opening from the cellar directly upon Benefit Street,  preferring to have a more immediate access to the outside world than the  dark stairs, ground-floor hall, and front door could give. There, where  morbidity lurked most thickly, I searched and poked during long  afternoons when the sunlight filtered in through the cobwebbed  above-ground windows, and a sense of security glowed from the unlocked  door which placed me only a few feet from the placid sidewalk outside.  Nothing new rewarded my efforts--only the same depressing mustiness and  faint suggestions of noxious odors and nitrous outlines on the  floor--and I fancy that many pedestrians must have watched me curiously  through the broken panes.    At length, upon a suggestion of my uncle's, I decided to try the spot  nocturnally; and one stormy midnight ran the beams of an electric torch  over the moldy floor with its uncanny shapes and distorted,  half-phosphorescent fungi. The place had dispirited me curiously that  evening, and I was almost prepared when I saw--or thought I saw--amidst  the whitish deposits a particularly sharp definition of the \"huddled  form\" I had suspected from boyhood. Its clearness was astonishing and  unprecedented--and as I watched I seemed to see again the thin,  yellowish, shimmering exhalation which had startled me on that rainy  afternoon so many years before.    Above the anthropomorphic patch of mold by the fireplace it rose; a  subtle, sickish, almost luminous vapor which as it hung trembling in the  dampness seemed to develop vague and shocking suggestions of form,  gradually trailing off into nebulous decay and passing up into the  blackness of the great chimney with a fetor in its wake. It was truly  horrible, and the more so to me because of what I knew of the spot.  Refusing to flee, I watched it fade--and as I watched I felt that it was  in turn watching me greedily with eyes more imaginable than visible.  When I told my uncle about it he was greatly aroused; and after a tense  hour of reflection, arrived at a definite and drastic decision. Weighing  in his mind the importance of the matter, and the significance of our  relation to it, he insisted that we both test--and if possible  destroy--the horror of the house by a joint night or nights of  aggressive vigil in that musty and fungus-cursed cellar.      4    On Wednesday, June 25, 1919, after a proper notification of Carrington  Harris which did not include surmises as to what we expected to find, my  uncle and I conveyed to the shunned house two camp chairs and a folding  camp cot, together with some scientific mechanism of greater weight and  intricacy. These we placed in the cellar during the day, screening the  windows with paper and planning to return in the evening for our first  vigil. We had locked the door from the cellar to the ground floor; and  having a key to the outside cellar door, were prepared to leave our  expensive and delicate apparatus--which we had obtained secretly and at  great cost--as many days as our vigils might be protracted. It was our  design to sit up together till very late, and then watch singly till  dawn in two-hour stretches, myself first and then my companion; the  inactive member resting on the cot.    The natural leadership with which my uncle procured the instruments from  the laboratories of Brown University and the Cranston Street Armory, and  instinctively assumed direction of our venture, was a marvelous  commentary on the potential vitality and resilience of a man of  eighty-one. Elihu Whipple had lived according to the hygienic laws he  had preached as a physician, and but for what happened later would be  here in full vigor today. Only two persons suspected what did  happen--Carrington Harris and myself. I had to tell Harris because he  owned the house and deserved to know what had gone out of it. Then too,  we had spoken to him in advance of our quest; and I felt after my  uncle's going that he would understand and assist me in some vitally  necessary public explanations. He turned very pale, but agreed to help  me, and decided that it would now be safe to rent the house.    To declare that we were not nervous on that rainy night of watching  would be an exaggeration both gross and ridiculous. We were not, as I  have said, in any sense childishly superstitious, but scientific study  and reflection had taught us that the known universe of three dimensions  embraces the merest fraction of the whole cosmos of substance and  energy.

It was under this wide repeal of felonies that chapter VIII of  33 Henry VIII was finally annulled. Whether the question of witchcraft  came up for special consideration or not, we are not informed. We do  know that the Bishops of London, Durham, Ely, Hereford, and Chichester,  took exception to some amendments that were inserted in the act of  repeal,[18] and it is not impossible that they were opposed to repealing  the act against witchcraft. Certainly there is no reason to suppose that  the church was resisting the encroachment of the state in the subject.    As a matter of fact it is probable that, in the general question of  repeal of felonies, the question of witchcraft received scant  attention. There is indeed an interesting story that seems to point in  that direction and that deserves repeating also as an illustration of  the protector's attitude towards the question. Edward Underhill gives  the narrative in his autobiography: \"When we hade dyned, the maior sentt  to [two] off his offycers with me to seke Alene; whome we mett withalle  in Poles, and toke hym with us unto his chamber, wheare we founde  fygures sett to calke the nativetie off the kynge, and a jugementt  gevyne off his deathe, wheroff this folyshe wreche thoughte hymselfe so  sure thatt he and his conselars the papistes bruted it all over. The  kynge laye att Hamtone courte the same tyme, and me lord protector at  the Syone; unto whome I caryed this Alen, with his bokes off  conejuracyons, cearkles, and many thynges beloungynge to thatt dyvlyshe  art, wiche he affyrmed before me lorde was a lawfulle cyens [science],  for the statute agaynst souche was repealed. 'Thow folyshe knave! (sayde  me lorde) yff thou and all thatt be off thy cyens telle me what I shalle  do to-morow, I wylle geve the alle thatt I have'; commaundynge me to  cary hym unto the Tower.\" Alen was examined about his science and it was  discovered that he was \"a very unlearned asse, and a sorcerer, for the  wiche he was worthye hangynge, sayde Mr. Recorde.\" He was however kept  in the Tower \"about the space off a yere, and then by frendshipe  delyvered. So scapithe alwayes the weked.\"[19]    But the wicked were not long to escape. The beginning of Elizabeth's  reign saw a serious and successful effort to put on the statute-book  definite and severe penalties for conjuration, sorcery, witchcraft, and  related crimes. The question was taken up in the very first year of the  new reign and a bill was draughted.[20] It was not, however, until 1563  that the statute was finally passed. It was then enacted that those who  \"shall use, practise, or exercise any Witchecrafte, Enchantment, Charme  or Sorcerie, whereby any person shall happen to bee killed or destroyed,  ... their Concellors and Aidours, ... shall suffer paynes of Deathe as a  Felon or Felons.\" It was further declared that those by whose practices  any person was wasted, consumed, or lamed, should suffer for the first  offence one year's imprisonment and should be put in the pillory four  times. For the second offence death was the penalty. It was further  provided that those who by witchcraft presumed to discover treasure or  to find stolen property or to \"provoke any person to unlawfull love\"  should suffer a year's imprisonment and four appearances in the pillory.    With this law the history of the prosecution of witchcraft in England as  a secular crime may well begin. The question naturally arises, What was  the occasion of this law? How did it happen that just at this particular  time so drastic a measure was passed and put into operation? Fortunately  part of the evidence exists upon which to frame an answer. The English  churchmen who had been driven out of England during the Marian  persecution had many of them sojourned in Zurich and Geneva, where the  extirpation of witches was in full progress, and had talked over the  matter with eminent Continental theologians. With the accession of  Elizabeth these men returned to England in force and became prominent in  church and state, many of them receiving bishoprics. It is not possible  to show that they all were influential in putting through the statute of  the fifth year of Elizabeth. It is clear that one of them spoke out  plainly on the subject. It can hardly be doubted that he represented the  opinions of many other ecclesiastics who had come under the same  influences during their exile.[21] John Jewel was an Anglican of  Calvinistic sympathies who on his return to England at Elizabeth's  accession had been appointed Bishop of Salisbury. Within a short time he  came to occupy a prominent position in the court. He preached before the  Queen and accompanied her on a visit to Oxford. It was in the course of  one of his first sermons--somewhere between November of 1559 and March  of 1560[22]--that he laid before her his convictions on witchcraft. It  is, he tells her, \"the horrible using of your poor subjects,\" that  forces him to speak. \"This kind of people (I mean witches and sorcerers)  within these few last years are marvellously increased within this your  grace's realm. These eyes have seen most evident and manifest marks of  their wickedness. Your grace's subjects pine away even unto death, their  colour fadeth, their flesh rotteth, their speech is benumbed, their  senses are bereft. Wherefore, your poor subjects' most humble petition  unto your highness is, that the laws touching such malefactors may be  put in due execution.\"    The church historian, Strype, conjectures that this sermon was the cause  of the law passed in the fifth year of Elizabeth's reign, by which  witchcraft was again made a felony, as it had been in the reign of Henry  VIII.[23] Whatever weight we may attach to Strype's suggestion, we have  every right to believe that Jewel introduced foreign opinion on  witchcraft. Very probably there were many returned exiles as well as  others who brought back word of the crusade on the Continent; but  Jewel's words put the matter formally before the queen and her  government.[24]    We can trace the effect of the ecclesiastic's appeal still further. The  impression produced by it was responsible probably not only for the  passage of the law but also for the issue of commissions to the justices  of the peace to apprehend all the witches they were able to find in  their jurisdictions.[25]    It can hardly be doubted that the impression produced by the bishop's  sermon serves in part to explain the beginning of the state's attack  upon witches. Yet one naturally inquires after some other factor in the  problem. Is it not likely that there were in England itself certain  peculiar conditions, certain special circumstances, that served to  forward the attack? To answer that query, we must recall the situation  in England when Elizabeth took the throne. Elizabeth was a Protestant,  and her accession meant the relinquishment of the Catholic hold upon  England. But it was not long before the claims of Mary, Queen of Scots,  began to give the English ministers bad dreams. Catholic and Spanish  plots against the life of Elizabeth kept the government detectives on  the lookout. Perhaps because it was deemed the hardest to circumvent,  the use of conjuration against the life of the queen was most feared.  It was a method too that appealed to conspirators, who never questioned  its efficacy, and who anticipated little risk of discovery.    To understand why the English government should have been so alarmed at  the efforts of the conjurers, we shall have to go back to the  half-century that preceded the reign of the great queen and review  briefly the rise of those curious traders in mystery. The earlier half  of the fifteenth century, when the witch fires were already lighted in  South Germany, saw the coming of conjurers in England. Their numbers  soon evidenced a growing interest in the supernatural upon the part of  the English and foreshadowed the growing faith in witchcraft. From the  scattered local records the facts have been pieced together to show that  here and there professors of magic powers were beginning to get a  hearing. As they first appear upon the scene, the conjurers may be  grouped in two classes, the position seekers and the treasure seekers.  To the first belong those who used incantations and charms to win the  favor of the powerful, and so to gain advancement for themselves or for  their clients.[26] It was a time when there was every encouragement to  try these means. Men like Wolsey and Thomas Cromwell had risen from  humble rank to the highest places in the state. Their careers seemed  inexplicable, if not uncanny. It was easy to believe that unfair and  unlawful practices had been used. What had been done before could be  done again. So the dealers in magic may have reasoned. At all events,  whatever their mental operations, they experimented with charms which  were to gain the favor of the great, and some of their operations came  to the ears of the court.    The treasure seekers[27] were more numerous. Every now and then in the  course of English history treasures have been unearthed, many of them  buried in Roman times. Stories of lucky finds had"]]]
