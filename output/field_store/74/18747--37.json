It could be easily seen, however, that if the queen  devoted most attention to Ximena, the father of the latter was not  obtaining similar favour from the king, notwithstanding the apparent  kindness with which he had been received only a very short time before.  Affection which does not proceed from the heart cannot long sustain its  fictitious semblance, and, in a moment of forgetfulness, the mask which  conceals it falls off, and the cold visage of indifference appears. Such  was the case with regard to Don Gome, and, on the other hand, the  sincere and wise monarch was openly showing the real affection which he  felt for De Vivar.    \"Gentlemen,\" said the king, addressing the cavaliers who surrounded him,  \"as a brother I have lamented the death of Don Garcia, but as a king,  obliged to sacrifice the warmest affections of my heart to the good of  the kingdom, which God has entrusted to me to rule over and govern, I  must rejoice at the victory obtained by the Castilian and Leonese arms  at Atapuerca. In celebrating that glorious triumph I have given proofs  of my munificence to the commoners, my vassals. It would not be well  that the cavaliers who assist at my Court should be debarred from  participating in my favours, according to their merits. You, noble and  loyal Peranzures, I appoint major-domo of my Alcazar; as you have served  my State so well, with your sword in battle and with your wisdom at the  Court and in the councils, I know you will also faithfully serve my  household. To you, honoured Arias Gonzalo, I entrust my treasures,  feeling sure that they will increase under your supervision. To you,  noble and prudent Diego Lainez, I confide the care and education of my  sons, as I feel sure that, having instructed your own son so well, you  will act similarly with regard to mine. You well know how I love the  princes; placing them in your charge is the greatest proof of friendship  and confidence that a king can give to a subject, and I now tell you  that if I could give you a greater proof I would heartily do so. You,  the most faultless cavalier and the most honoured and prudent of the  grandees of Castile, will cultivate the talents of my sons, so that the  crowns which one day shall encircle their brows may sit well on them.  God gave me three kingdoms, and I shall leave one to each of them. You,  brave Count de Gormaz, shall be, from to-day, the General of the Leonese  and Castilian troops, in the place of Diego Lainez and Peranzures, whose  arms have been weakened by age and by the constant wielding of the sword  and lance. You have given me proofs of your courage, fighting against  the Moorish power, and I doubt not but that you, and the cavaliers who  surround you, will serve me well, some by their valour in battle, and  others by their loyalty and wisdom.\"    Peranzures, Arias Gonzalo, and Diego Lainez bent their knees and kissed  the hand of the king, in order to thank him for the great favours which  he had conferred on them, as was their duty as good and grateful  subjects; De Gormaz, however, when his turn came, gave loose reins to  the anger which had been accumulating in his heart whilst the other  cavaliers were being thus addressed, especially De Vivar, who appeared  to him to have been unjustly favoured by the king, whose coldness  towards himself he attributed to the evil counsels of the honoured old  man, who indeed was far from deserving such a suspicion.    \"Sire,\" he said to the king, directing his glances from time to time  towards Diego Lainez, \"the Count de Gormaz would be a fawning courtier,  and not an honourable cavalier, if he were to thank the king for favours  which he does not receive. If flatterers alone please you, do not hope  to find one in me.\"    Another monarch, less prudent than Don Fernando, would have punished the  audacity and ingratitude of Don Gome, and would have put a bridle on the  tongue which had so rashly spoken; Don Fernando, however, restrained his  vexation, and allowed De Gormaz to express his resentment, even though  it were unjust, and even though he did it in terms unfitting a subject  in the presence of his king.    \"You entrust, sire,\" continued Don Gome, \"the education of your sons to  a feeble old man, as if they should be reared up to be monks, or as if  you should desire them to be as effeminate as women; and, to favour a  debilitated flatterer, you forget, sire, my services and the valour with  which I have always served you! If you desire that the princes should be  good cavaliers, skilful in breaking a lance in a joust, and daring and  prudent in attacking a squadron of Moors, to whom should you confide  their training? Is it to an old man, whose hand can scarce hold the  staff which supports him, or to me, who have valour in my heart and  strength in my arm to brandish a sword, not only against the infidel,  but against all who dare to doubt the truth of what I say? If there is  any such, I stand prepared to meet him!\"    Speaking thus, Don Gome advanced insultingly towards Diego Lainez,  provoking him by his look as well as by his words.    The old man looked towards the king and curbed his righteous  indignation, which, if it had not been restrained by the presence of his  sovereign, would have burst forth in rage; if not indeed with the aid of  the sword, which his aged hands could not wield, yet with the voice  which could be still energetic and terrible in defence of an honour  which nobody but the Count de Gormaz had ever dared to cast a slur on;  he then said--    \"Sire, pardon me if in defending my outraged honour I pass beyond the  limits of the moderation which I should adhere to in the presence of my  lord and king.\" And he continued, fixing his gaze on De Gormaz: \"Don  Gome, you are unjust in the highest degree if you think that I am a  flatterer and calumniator. Diego Lainez is grateful for the favours  which he receives from his king, but he never tries to win them, much  less by means of flattery and calumny. If the reasons which you have  brought forward, in order to prove that the king should have entrusted  to you, instead of to me, the education of the princes, have convinced  him, to whom I owe this mark of confidence, I shall renounce in your  favour so great an honour, although I consider it the most signal one  which has been conferred on me during my long life, consecrated almost  entirely to the service of my country. However, I do not think that  those reasons weigh much with the king. That weakness which you see in  my hand, those grey hairs which you see on my head, and those scars on  my face, only prove that I have lived longer than you, and that I have  not spent my life entirely in the saloons of the Court. If I can no  longer break a lance at a tournament, or enter into close quarters with  a hostile army, I can teach how to do both one and the other; you, who  learned those things from me, should be able to certify to that, and  respect me, if no longer as an old man, at least as your instructor.\"    The king recognised the unreasonableness of the count and the prudence  and moderation of De Vivar; he did not wish, however, to decide publicly  in favour of the one or of the other, for he knew the evils which a  complete rupture between those two noble families would cause to the  State, as both of them were powerful on account of their wealth and the  number of their partisans; therefore, to make the Count de Gormaz an  enemy was a thing which even a monarch might shrink from. Thus it was  that he thought it best to use his influence with a view to reconciling  both opponents, and thus continue in friendly relations with them.    \"Leave aside,\" he therefore said to them, \"those sad contentions, and  think only of renewing the friendship which, in times not far remote,  united you, and of serving your country and the religion of your  forefathers, now continually menaced by the Moors, for by no other means  can good Christian cavaliers give proof of their loyalty. Both of you  are strong pillars, to support our faith and my throne, and it would  never enter my mind to favour one of you to the prejudice of the other;  indeed, in order to recompense your merits I have desired that each of  you should fill the position which circumstances necessitate. When De  Vivar was robust and strong enough to wield a lance, he commanded the  Christian armies, and now that he can only serve me by his wisdom and  experience I confide to him a task for which those very qualities are  most necessary. You, Don Gome, are the most capable of commanding my  troops, and therefore I make you their leader. Some future day you will  be old, as Lainez now is, and then the king will utilise your wisdom and  loyalty in his household. Knowing that you are valiant and take pleasure  in the chances of war, I believed that it would not be pleasing to you  if I appointed you to a position in my Alcazar which only old men, as  Arias, Peranzures, and Lainez are, can properly fill; or, if not they,  only those cavaliers who, on account of a peaceful nature, are ill  suited for battlefields. Lainez, stretch forth your hand to Don Gome and  he will willingly clasp it.\"    The old man then held out his feeble hand, as if to seek that of the  count, desirous of pleasing the king, and of sacrificing his just  resentment for the sake of a reconciliation which might prevent many  evils to the State, and which might restore tranquillity to his  household. Perhaps, at that moment, he was also thinking of Rodrigo,  whose happiness depended on the renewal of friendly relations with De  Gormaz. Judge, however, of his surprise and indignation when he saw the  count draw his hand away, and heard him say in accents full of disdain--    \"The hand of the Count of Gormaz never has clasped and never shall clasp  that of a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/42"],[0,"The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (#4)"],[1," before his mind's eye, as clear as a  transparency, the strange clauses of the will.    24)                              DR. JEKYLL WAS QUITE AT EASE    A FORTNIGHT later, by excellent good fortune, the doctor gave one  of his pleasant dinners to some five or six old cronies, all  intelligent, reputable men and all judges of good wine; and Mr.  Utterson so contrived that he remained behind after the others had  departed. This was no new arrangement, but a thing that had  befallen many scores of times. Where Utterson was liked, he was  liked well. Hosts loved to detain the dry lawyer, when the  light-hearted and the loose-tongued had already their foot on the  threshold; they liked to sit a while in his unobtrusive company,  practising for solitude, sobering their minds in the man's rich  silence after the expense and strain of gaiety. To this rule, Dr.  Jekyll was no exception; and as he now sat on the opposite side of  the fire--a large, well-made, smooth-faced man of fifty, with  something of a slyish cast perhaps, but every mark of capacity and  kindness--you could see by his looks that he cherished for Mr.  Utterson a sincere and warm affection.    25)      \"I have been wanting to speak to you, Jekyll,\" began the latter.  \"You know that will of yours?\"    A close observer might have gathered that the topic was  distasteful; but the doctor carried it off gaily. \"My poor  Utterson,\" said he, \"you are unfortunate in such a client. I never  saw a man so distressed as you were by my will; unless it were that  hide-bound pedant, Lanyon, at what he called my scientific heresies.  Oh, I know he's a good fellow--you needn't frown--an excellent  fellow, and I always mean to see more of him; but a hide-bound  pedant for all that; an ignorant, blatant pedant. I was never more  disappointed in any man than Lanyon.\"    \"You know I never approved of it,\" pursued Utterson, ruthlessly  disregarding the fresh topic.    \"My will? Yes, certainly, I know that,\" said the doctor, a trifle  sharply. \"You have told me so.\"    \"Well, I tell you so again,\" continued the lawyer. \"I have been  learning something of young Hyde.\"    The large handsome face of Dr. Jekyll grew pale to the very lips,  and there came a blackness about his eyes. \"I do not care to hear  more,\" said he. \"This is a matter I thought we had agreed to drop.\"    \"What I heard was abominable,\" said Utterson.    \"It can make no change. You do not under-    26)    stand my position,\" returned the doctor, with a certain incoherency  of manner. \"I am painfully situated, Utterson; my position is a very  strange--a very strange one. It is one of those affairs that  cannot be mended by talking.\"    \"Jekyll,\" said Utterson, \"you know me: I am a man to be trusted.  Make a clean breast of this in confidence; and I make no doubt I  can get you out of it.\"    \"My good Utterson,\" said the doctor, \"this is very good of you,  this is downright good of you, and I cannot find words to thank you  in. I believe you fully; I would trust you before any man alive, ay,  before myself, if I could make the choice; but indeed it isn't what  you fancy; it is not so bad as that; and just to put your good heart  at rest, I will tell you one thing: the moment I choose, I can be  rid of Mr. Hyde. I give you my hand upon that; and I thank you again  and again; and I will just add one little word, Utterson, that I'm  sure you'll take in good part: this is a private matter, and I beg  of you to let it sleep.\"      Utterson reflected a little, looking in the fire.    \"I have no doubt you are perfectly right,\" he said at last, getting  to his feet.    \"Well, but since we have touched upon this business, and for the  last time I hope,\" continued the doctor, \"there is one point I  should like you to understand. I have really a very great interest  in poor Hyde. I know you have seen    27)    him; he told me so; and I fear he was rude. But, I do sincerely  take a great, a very great interest in that young man; and if I am  taken away, Utterson, I wish you to promise me that you will bear  with him and get his rights for him. I think you would, if you knew  all; and it would be a weight off my mind if you would promise.\"    \"I can't pretend that I shall ever like him,\" said the lawyer.    \"I don't ask that,\" pleaded Jekyll, laying his hand upon the  other's arm; \"I only ask for justice; I only ask you to help him  for my sake, when I am no longer here.\"    Utterson heaved an irrepressible sigh. \"Well,\" said he, \"I  promise.\"    28)                              THE CAREW MURDER CASE    NEARLY a year later, in the month of October, 18---, London was  startled by a crime of singular ferocity and rendered all the more  notable by the high position of the victim. The details were few and  startling. A maid servant living alone in a house not far from the  river, had gone up-stairs to bed about eleven. Although a fog rolled  over the city in the small hours, the early part of the night was  cloudless, and the lane, which the maid's window overlooked, was  brilliantly lit by the full moon. It seems she was romantically  given, for she sat down upon her box, which stood immediately under  the window, and fell into a dream of musing. Never (she used to say,  with streaming tears, when she narrated that experience), never had  she felt more at peace with all men or thought more kindly of the  world. And as she so sat she became aware of an aged and beautiful  gentleman with white hair, drawing near along the lane; and  advancing to meet him, another and very small gentleman, to whom at  first she    29)    paid less attention. When they had come within speech (which was  just under the maid's eyes) the older man bowed and accosted the  other with a very pretty manner of politeness. It did not seem as  if the subject of his address were of great importance; indeed,  from his pointing, it sometimes appeared as if he were only  inquiring his way; but the moon shone on his face as he spoke, and  the girl was pleased to watch it, it seemed to breathe such an  innocent and old-world kindness of disposition, yet with something  high too, as of a well-founded self-content. Presently her eye  wandered to the other, and she was surprised to recognise in him a  certain Mr. Hyde, who had once visited her master and for whom she  had conceived a dislike. He had in his hand a heavy cane, with which  he was trifling; but he answered never a word, and seemed to listen  with an ill-contained impatience. And then all of a sudden he broke  out in a great flame of anger, stamping with his foot, brandishing  the cane, and carrying on (as the maid described it) like a madman.  The old gentleman took a step back, with the air of one very much  surprised and a trifle hurt; and at that Mr. Hyde broke out of all  bounds and clubbed him to the earth. And next moment, with ape-like  fury, he was trampling his victim under foot and hailing down a  storm of blows, under which the bones were audibly shattered and the  body jumped upon the roadway. At the horror of these sights and  sounds, the maid fainted.    30)    It was two o'clock when she came to herself and called for the  police. The murderer was gone long ago; but there lay his victim in  the middle of the lane, incredibly mangled. The stick with which the  deed had been done, although it was of some rare and very tough and  heavy wood, had broken in the middle under the stress of this  insensate cruelty; and one splintered half had rolled in the  neighbouring gutter--the other, without doubt, had been carried  away by the murderer. A purse and a gold watch were found upon the  victim: but no cards or papers, except a sealed and stamped  envelope, which he had been probably carrying to the post, and which  bore the name and address of Mr. Utterson.    This was brought to the lawyer the next morning, before he was out  of bed; and he had no sooner seen it, and been told the  circumstances, than he shot out a solemn lip. \"I shall say nothing  till I have seen the body,\" said he; \"this may be very serious. Have  the kindness to wait while I dress.\" And with the same grave  countenance he hurried through his breakfast and drove to the police  station, whither the body had been carried. As soon as he came into  the cell, he nodded.    \"Yes,\" said he, \"I recognise him. I am sorry to say that this is  Sir Danvers Carew.\"    \"Good God, sir,\" exclaimed the officer, \"is it possible?\" And the  next moment his eye    31)    lighted up with professional ambition. \"This will make a deal of  noise,\" he said. \"And perhaps you can help us to the man.\" And he  briefly narrated what the maid had seen, and showed the broken  stick.    Mr. Utterson had already quailed at the name of Hyde; but when the  stick was laid before him, he could doubt no longer; broken and  battered as it was, he recognised it for one that he had himself  presented many years before to Henry Jekyll.    \"Is this Mr. Hyde a person of small stature?\" he inquired.    \"Particularly small and particularly wicked-looking, is what the  maid calls him,\" said the officer.    Mr. Utterson reflected; and then, raising his head, \"If you will  come with me in my cab,\" he said, \"I think I can take you to his  house.\"    It was by this time about nine in the morning, and the first fog of  the season. A great chocolate-coloured pall lowered over heaven, but  the wind was continually charging and routing these embattled  vapours; so that as the cab crawled from street to street, Mr.  Utterson beheld a marvellous number of degrees and hues of twilight;  for here it would be dark like the back-end of evening; and there  would be a glow of a rich, lurid brown, like the light of some  strange conflagration; and here, for a moment, the fog would be  quite broken up, and a haggard shaft    32)    of daylight would glance in between the swirling wreaths.
