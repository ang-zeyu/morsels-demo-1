Use any good insect powder or any poultry lice killer. Clean out the  hutches or pens and disinfect with any good disinfectant. They are not  often bothered if kept in good condition.      Wounds.    Males sometimes hurt each other in fights. Cleanse the wound with warm  water, remove the hair around it with sharp scissors and apply any good  healing salve.      Running at the Eyes.    This is often caused by a cold. Wash the eyes in a solution of boric  acid that you can get any druggist to put up for you.      Paralysis.    Cavies sometimes have dragging of the hind limbs. Some say alfalfa will  cause it, but it is usually from some disorder of the kidneys. Give  about 25 drops of sweet spirits of nitre three times a day and rub the  limbs with a good liniment. Feed carefully for several days and they  will often get over it.      General Instructions.    It is much easier to keep Cavies well than to cure a sick one,  therefore, try and prevent trouble. Sick ones should be separated from  the others and placed in comfortable quarters. Feed only choice food.  Keep their quarters clean, sweet and well ventilated. Give them all air  and sun you can and all the room for exercise you can. Feed no mouldy,  wet or half cured hay or grass. Do feed grass that is wet with dew or  rain. Just give your Cavies half a chance and you will find that disease  will bother your Caviary but little.          CHAPTER X    PROFITS IN CAVY RAISING.      This industry in America is in its infancy. There are in several  sections of the country large Cavy farms but they raise nothing like  enough to supply the demand. Either as a side line with only a dozen or  two females or whether raised as a business, Guinea Pigs offer a safe,  sure and pleasant method of making money.    There is no danger that the business will be overdone as the demand is  growing much more rapidly than the supply and as the supply increases  more will be used. The hospitals in most cases use them in preference to  any other animal for experimental purposes but at this time they cannot  get them in sufficient quantities. There is and always will be a great  demand for them as pets. When the people get educated to the food value,  this end of the industry will come in for its share. The present high  cost of meat and the decreasing supply of cattle indicate that in a few  years the people of this country will have to make other preparations  for their fresh meat and the Cavy offers the solution to the meat  problem. All of these facts make it plain that there is no danger of  there getting to be too many Cavies.      Inexpensive to Keep.    The profits in raising Guinea Pigs are large. The price for them on the  open market runs all the way from 50c to several dollars each. The cost  of raising them to the age when they are to be sold differs, of course  with conditions and circumstances. The man on the farm or in the small  town who has access to plenty of food for them without paying for it of  course, can raise them cheaper than the man in the city. Even in the  city, however, very little has to be bought and that only in the winter  time as in the summer lawn clippings and vegetables from the table will  feed them and all that will have to be bought is some grain or hay. By  saving and curing the lawn clippings there will be no need of buying  hay. They are far more profitable than poultry as they not only cost  less to feed and keep but are not subject to the diseases that make  poultry raising so unprofitable. They occupy smaller space and are not  dirty, noisy or objectionable in any way. Many large Poultry Farms have  been turned into Caviaries as their owners have seen that it is easier  to make money with Guinea Pigs than with chickens.      Easy to Raise.    Anyone with ordinary intelligence should be able to raise Guinea Pigs  successfully. Women do especially well with them as they require less  attention and work than chickens. Boys and girls find the raising of  them not only a pleasure but profitable and it is a splendid occupation  for them as it requires no hard or laborious work. Youngsters from 10 to  17 or 18 years old need a responsibility of some kind and the experience  gained in the raising and selling of Guinea Pigs will be very valuable  to them in addition to the money they will make. Parents will do well to  give their children a chance to raise them. To start with Guinea Pigs  does not require a large outlay of capital. By starting with just a few  and by keeping the young females it does not take long to build up a  herd of breeders that are valuable. As each female produces about 15  young a year and as these young are worth from 50c to several dollars  each, you can readily see there is a big opportunity for profit.      Big Profits.    Suppose you begin with six females. In one year they should produce  about 90 young and the young females of the first one or two litters  should be producing before the end of the year. Therefore, it is pretty  safe to assume that from the six females and their litters you should  get every year about 120 pigs. If sold at a price of 50c each these six  females would be producing about $60 a year. These figures will show you  what 100 females should do.      Starting.    Almost anyone can start raising Guinea Pigs without having to make any  very special preparations or a large investment. In any new business it  is always best to start in a small way. From a dozen to 25 females will  give you an opportunity to learn their habits and you can increase your  quarters as your herd increases. It would not be advisable for anyone to  start with 100 or more right at once unless he has especially good place  for them and a plentiful supply of food. However, by beginning in a  small way no risk is taken and you can learn the business as you go  along, and you can get extra stock as you make preparation for it.      Selection of Stock.    You cannot be too careful in the selection of your stock. Get good  healthy animals to start with as on them depends your success. Scrub  Guinea Pigs will pay no better than scrub poultry or cattle. Those found  in pet stores are frequently unfitted for breeding purposes as they may  have been experimented on or the descendants of such animals. Hospitals  are very careful of whom they buy and must be assured of the purity of  the stock. Therefore, you cannot be too careful in the selection of  your original stock. Just as no one would start a live stock farm with  the cheapest animals that can be bought, so no one should start a Cavy  farm with the cheapest Cavies that can be bought. There are many  reliable dealers in the country who have good stock for sale. Buy of a  well known breeder or dealer and you will have no trouble. Young  breeders are to be preferred as they have a longer life before them and  are more valuable.    From our own experience with Guinea Pigs we would advise anyone who is  interested in this work to take up the raising of them. Whether you have  only a few for making a little money on the side or a large number as a  real business you will find them very profitable. Certainly a great deal  of pleasure can be gotten out of it and there is a wide sale for all you  raise. If you will follow the instructions laid down in this little book  we do not believe you will have any trouble making a success of the  work.

I sent you olive-wood from Venice to  Augsburg, where I let it stay, a full ten hundred weight.  But it says it won't wait, hence the stink.    My picture [the self-portrait Dürer painted?], you must  know, says it would give a ducat for you to see it. It is  well painted and finely coloured. I have got much praise but  little profit by it. I could have easily earned 200 ducats  in the time, and I have had to decline big commissions in  order to come home.    I have shut up all the painters, who used to say that I was  good at engraving, but that in painting I didn't know how to  handle my colours. Now they all say they never saw better  colouring.    My French mantle greets you, and so does my Italian coat. It  seems to me that you smell of gallantry. I can scent it from  here; and they say here, that when you go courting, you  pretend to be no more than 25 years old.  Oh, yes!  Multiply  that and I`ll believe it. My friend, there `s a devil of a  lot of Italians here who are just like you. I don't know how  it is!    The Doge and the Patriarch have seen my picture.  Herewith  let me commend myself as your servant. I really must sleep,  for it's striking seven at night, and I have already written  to the Prior of the Augustines, to my father-in-law, to  Mistress Dietrich, and to my wife, and they are all sheets  cram full. So I have had to hurry over this. Read according  to the sense. You would do it better if you were writing to  princes. Many good nights to you, and days too. Given at  Venice on Our Lady's Day in September.    You needn't lend my wife and mother anything.  They have got  money enough.    --Albert Dürer        23 Sept. 1506    Your letter telling me of the overflowing praise that you  received from princes and nobles gave me great allegrezza.  [Editor's note: Allegrezza means \"joy;\" in Venetian in  original].  You must have changed completely to have become  so gentle; I must do likewise when I meet you again. Know  also that my picture is finished, likewise another quadro,  [Editor's note: quadro is Venetian for \"painting\"] the like  of which I never made before. And as you are so pleased with  yourself, let me tell you now that there is no better  Madonna picture in all the land, for all the painters praise  it as the nobles do you. They say that they have never seen  a nobler, more charming painting.    The oil for which you wrote I am sending by Kannengiesser.  And burnt glass that I sent you by Farber--tell me if it  reached you safely. As for the carpets, I have not bought  any yet, for I cannot find any square ones. They are all  narrow and long. If you would like any of these, I will  willingly buy them; let me know about it.    Know also that in four weeks at the latest I shall be  finished here, for I have to paint first some portraits that  I have promised, and in order that I may get home soon, I  have refused, since my picture was finished, orders for more  than 2,000 ducats; all my neighbours know of this.    Now let me commend myself to you. I had much more to write,  but the messenger is ready to start: besides, I hope, if God  will, to be with you again soon and to learn new wisdom from  you. Bernhard Holzbeck told me great things of you, but I  believe that he did so because you have become his brother-  in-law. But nothing makes me more angry than to hear anyone  say that you are handsome, for then I should have to be  ugly; that would make me mad.    The other day I found a gray hair on my head, which was  produced by sheer misery and annoyance. I think I am fated  to have evil days. My French mantle and the doublet and the  brown coat send you a hearty greeting. But I should like to  see what your drinking club can do that you hold yourself so  high.    Given the year 1506 on Wednesday after St. Matthew's      --Albrecht Dürer        About the 13th October, 1506    Once I know that you are aware of my devotion to your  service, there is no need to write about it; but so much the  more necessary is it for me to tell you of the great delight  it gives me to hear of the high honour and fame that you  have attained to by your manly wisdom and learned skill.  This is the more to be wondered at, for seldom or never can  the like be found in a young body; but it comes to you by  the special grace of God, as it does to me. How pleased we  both feel when we think well of ourselves, I with my  picture, and you con vostra [with your] learning! When  anyone praises us we hold up our head and believe him, yet  perhaps he is only some false flatterer who is making fun of  us, so don't credit anyone who praises you, for you have no  notion how unmannerly you are.    I can readily portray you to myself standing before the  Margrave and making pretty speeches.  You carry on just as  though you were making love to the Rosentaler girl, cringing  so.    It did not escape me, when you wrote the last letter, you  were full of amorous thoughts. You ought to be ashamed of  yourself, for making yourself out so good looking when you  are so old. Your flirting is like a big shaggy dog playing  with a little kitten. If you were only as nice and sleek as  I am, I might understand it; but when I get to be a  burgomaster I will shame you with the Luginsland [Editor's  note: this was a Nuremberg prison], as you do the pious  Zamener and me. I will have you shut up there for once with  the Rechenmeister, Rosentaler, Gartner, Schlitz, and Por  girls, and many others whom for shortness I will not name.  They must deal with you.  They ask after me more than after  you, however, for you yourself write that both girls and  ladies ask after me--that is a sign of my virtue! But if God  brings me home again safely, I do not know how I shall get  along with you with your great wisdom: but I `m glad on  account of your virtue and good nature; and your dogs will  be the better for it, for you will not beat them lame any  more. But if you are so highly respected at home, you will  not dare to be seen speaking with a poor painter in the  streets, it would be a great disgrace, con poltrone di  pintore.    Oh, dear Herr Pirkheimer, this very minute, while I was  writing to you in good humour, the fire alarm sounded and  six houses over by Peter Pender's are burned, and woolen  cloth of mine, for which I paid only yesterday 8 ducats, is  burned; so I too am in trouble. There are often fire alarms  here.    As for your plea that I should come home quickly, I will  come just as soon as I can; but I must first gain money for  my expenses. I have paid out about 100 ducats for colours  and other things, and I have ordered two carpets which I  shall pay for tomorrow; but I could not get them cheaply. I  will pack them up with my linen.    As for your previous comment that I should come home soon or  else you would give my wife a \"washing,\" you are not  permitted to do so, since you would ride her to death.    Know, too, that I decided to learn dancing and went twice to  the school, for which I had to pay the master a ducat. No  one could get me to go there again. To learn dancing, I  should have had to pay away all that I have earned, and at  the end I should have known nothing about it.    As for the glass, the messenger Farber will bring it to you.  I cannot find out anywhere that they are printing any new  Greek books. I will pack up a ream of your paper for you. I  thought Keppler had more like it; but I have not been able  to get the feathers you wanted, and so I bought white ones  instead. If I find the green ones, I will buy some and bring  them with me.    Stephen Paumgartner has written to me to buy him fifty  Carnelian beads for a rosary. I have ordered them, but they  are dear. I could not get any larger ones, and shall send  them to him by the next messenger.    As to your question as to when I shall come home, I tell  you, so that my lords may make their arrangements, that I  shall have finished here in ten days. After that I should  like to travel to Bologna to learn the secrets of the art of  perspective, which a man there is willing to teach me. I  should stay there about eight or ten days and then come back  to Venice; after that I should come with the next messenger.    How I shall freeze after this sun! Here I am a gentleman, at  home a parasite. Let me know how old Dame Kormer behaves as  a bride, and that you will not grudge her to me. There are  many things about which I should like to write to you, but I  shall soon be with you.    Given at Venice about the 14th day after Michaelmas, 1506.    --Albrecht Dürer    P.S. When will you let me know whether any of your children  have died?  You also wrote me once that Joseph Rummel had  married ----z's daughter, and forgot to mention whose. How  should I know what you mean? If I only had my cloth back! I  am afraid my mantle has been burned too. That would drive me  crazy. I seem doomed to bad luck; not more than three weeks  ago a man ran away who owed me 8 ducats.    PART II: DIARY OF A JOURNEY THE NETHERLANDS (July, 1520-  July, 1521)      Anno 1520    On Thursday after St. Kilian's Day, I, Albrecht Dürer, at my  own charges and costs, took myself and my wife from  Nuremberg away to the Netherlands, and the same day, after  we had passed through Eriangen, we put up for the night at  Baiersdorff, and spent there 3 crowns, less 6 pfennigs. From  thence on the next day, Friday, we came to Forchheim, and  there paid for the conveying thence on the journey to  Bamberg 22 pf., and presented to the Bishop a painted Virgin  and a \"Life of the Virgin,\" an \"Apocalypse,\" and a florin's  worth of engravings. He invited me to be his guest, gave me  a toll-pass and three letters of introduction, and settled  my bill at the inn, where I had spent about a florin. I paid  6 florins in gold to the boatmen who took me from Bamberg to  Frankfurt.  Master Lucas Benedict and Hans the painter sent  me a"]]]
