Poisons may be effectively used in barns, stables,  sheds, cribs, and other outbuildings.    =Caution.=--In the United States there are few laws which prohibit the  laying of poisons on lands owned or controlled by the poisoner. Hence it  is all the more necessary to exercise extreme caution to prevent  accidents. In several States notice of intention to lay poison must be  given to persons living in the neighborhood. Poison for rats should  never be placed in open or unsheltered places. This applies particularly  to strychnin or arsenic on meat. _Packages containing poisons should  always bear a warning label and should not be kept where children might  reach them._    Among the principal poisons that have been recommended for killing rats  and mice are barium carbonate, strychnin, arsenic, phosphorus, and  squills.    =Barium carbonate.=--One of the cheapest and most effective poisons for  rats and mice is barium carbonate. This mineral has the advantage of  being without taste or smell. It has a corrosive action on the mucous  lining of the stomach and is dangerous to larger animals if taken in  sufficient quantity. In the small doses fed to rats and mice it would be  harmless to domestic animals. Its action upon rats is slow, and if exit  is possible the animals usually leave the premises in search of water.  For this reason the poison may frequently, though not always, be used in  houses without disagreeable consequences.    Barium carbonate may be fed in the form of dough composed of four parts  of meal or flour and one part of the mineral. A more convenient bait is  ordinary oatmeal with about one-eighth of its bulk of the mineral, mixed  with water into a stiff dough. A third plan is to spread the barium  carbonate upon fish, toasted bread (moistened), or ordinary bread and  butter. The prepared bait should be placed in rat runs, about a  teaspoonful at a place. If a single application of the poison fails to  kill or drive away all rats from the premises, it should be repeated  with a change of bait.    =Strychnin.=--Strychnin is too rapid in action to make its use for rats  desirable in houses, but elsewhere it may be employed effectively.  Strychnia sulphate is the best form to use. The dry crystals may be  inserted in small pieces of raw meat, Vienna sausage, or toasted cheese,  and these placed in rat runs or burrows; or oatmeal may be moistened  with a strychnin sirup and small quantities laid in the same way.    Strychnin sirup is prepared as follows: Dissolve a half ounce of  strychnia sulphate in a pint of boiling water; add a pint of thick sugar  sirup and stir thoroughly. A smaller quantity may be prepared with a  proportional quantity of water and sirup. In preparing the bait it is  necessary to moisten all the oatmeal with the sirup. Wheat and corn are  excellent alternative baits. The grain should be soaked overnight in the  strychnin sirup.    =Arsenic.=--Arsenic is probably the most popular of the rat poisons,  owing to its cheapness, yet our experiments prove that, measured by the  results obtained, arsenic is dearer than strychnin. Besides, arsenic is  extremely variable in its effect upon rats, and if the animals survive a  first dose it is very difficult to induce them to take another.    Powdered white arsenic (arsenious acid) may be fed to rats in almost any  of the baits mentioned under barium carbonate and strychnin. It has been  used successfully when rubbed into fresh fish or spread on buttered  toast. Another method is to mix twelve parts by weight of corn meal and  one part of arsenic with whites of eggs into a stiff dough.    An old formula for poisoning rats and mice with arsenic is the  following, adapted from an English source:    Take a pound of oatmeal, a pound of coarse brown sugar, and a spoonful  of arsenic. Mix well together and put the composition into an earthen  jar. Put a tablespoonful at a place in runs frequented by rats.    =Phosphorus.=--For poisoning rats and mice, phosphorus is used almost as  commonly as arsenic, and undoubtedly it is effective when given in an  attractive bait. The phosphorus paste of the drug stores is usually  dissolved yellow phosphorus, mixed with glucose or other substances. The  proportion of phosphorus varies from one-fourth of 1 per cent to 4 per  cent. The first amount is too small to be always effective and the last  is dangerously inflammable. When homemade preparations of phosphorus are  used there is much danger of burning the person or of setting fire to  crops or buildings. In the Western States many fires have resulted from  putting out homemade phosphorus poisons for ground squirrels, and entire  fields of ripe grain have been destroyed in this way. Even with  commercial pastes the action of sun and rain changes the phosphorus and  leaches out the glucose until a highly inflammable residue is left.    It is often claimed that phosphorus eaten by rats or mice dries up or  mummifies the body so that no odor results. The statement has no  foundation in fact. No known poison will prevent decomposition of the  body of an animal that died from its effects. Equally misleading is the  statement that rats poisoned with phosphorus do not die on the premises.  Owing to its slower operation, no doubt a larger portion escape into the  open before dying than when strychnin is used.    The Biological Survey does not recommend the use of phosphorus as a  poison for rodents.    =Squills.=--The squill, or sea leek,[6] is a favorite rat poison in many  parts of Europe and is well worthy of trial in America. It is rapid and  very deadly in its action, and rats seem to eat it readily. The poison  is used in several ways. Two ounces of dry squills, powdered, may be  thoroughly mixed with eight ounces of toasted cheese or of butter and  meal and put out in runs of rats or mice. Another formula recommends two  parts of squills to three parts of finely chopped bacon, mixed with meal  enough to make it cohere. This is baked in small cakes.    =Poison in poultry houses.=--For poisoning rats in buildings and yards  occupied by poultry the following method is recommended: Two wooden  boxes should be used, one considerably larger than the other and each  having one or more holes in the sides large enough to admit rats. The  poisoned bait should be placed on the bottom and near the middle of the  smaller box, and the larger box should then be inverted over it. Rats  thus have free access to the bait, but fowls are excluded.      DOMESTIC ANIMALS.    Among domestic animals employed to kill rats are the dog, the cat, and  the ferret.    =Dogs.=--The value of dogs as ratters can not be appreciated by persons  who have had no experience with a trained animal. The ordinary cur and  the larger breeds of dogs seldom develop the necessary qualities for  ratters. Small Irish, Scotch, and fox terriers, when properly trained,  are superior to other breeds and under favorable circumstances may be  relied upon to keep the farm premises reasonably free from rats.    =Cats.=--However valuable cats may be as mousers, few learn to catch  rats. The ordinary house cat is too well fed and consequently too lazy  to undertake the capture of an animal as formidable as the brown rat.  Birds and mice are much more to its liking. Cats that are fearless of  rats, however, and have learned to hunt and destroy them are often very  useful about stables and warehouses. They should be lightly fed, chiefly  on milk. A little sulphur in the milk at intervals is a corrective  against the bad effects of a constant rat or mouse diet. Cats often die  from eating these rodents.    =Ferrets.=--Tame ferrets, like weasels, are inveterate foes of rats, and  can follow the rodents into their retreats. Under favorable  circumstances they are useful aids to the rat catcher, but their value  is greatly overestimated. For effective work they require experienced  handling and the additional services of a dog or two. Dogs and ferrets  must be thoroughly accustomed to each other, and the former must be  quiet and steady instead of noisy and excitable. The ferret is used only  to bolt the rats, which are killed by the dogs. If unmuzzled ferrets are  sent into rat retreats, they are apt to make a kill and then lie up  after sucking the blood of their victim. Sometimes they remain for hours  in the burrows or escape by other exits and are lost. There is danger  that these lost ferrets may adapt themselves to wild conditions and  become a pest by preying upon poultry and birds.      FUMIGATION.    Rats may be destroyed in their burrows in the fields and along river  banks, levees, and dikes by carbon bisulphid.[7] A wad of cotton or  other absorbent material is saturated with the liquid and then pushed  into the burrow, the opening being packed with earth to prevent the  escape of the gas. All animals in the burrow are asphyxiated. Fumigation  in buildings is not so satisfactory, because it is difficult to confine  the gases. Moreover, when effective, the odor from the dead rats is  highly objectionable in occupied buildings.    Chlorin, carbon monoxid, sulphur dioxid, and hydrocyanic acid are the  gases most used for destroying rats and mice in sheds, warehouses, and  stores. Each is effective if the gas can be confined and made to reach  the retreats of the animals. Owing to the great danger from fire  incident to burning charcoal or sulphur in open pans, a special furnace  provided with means for forcing the gas into the compartments of vessels  or buildings is generally employed.    Hydrocyanic-acid gas is effective in destroying all animal life in  buildings. It has been successfully used to free elevators and  warehouses of rats, mice, and insects. However, it is so dangerous to  human life that the novice should not attempt fumigation with it, except  under careful"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35545"],[0,"Sanders of the River (#4)"],[1," I must not fight, and, behold, I have destroyed  my uncle, who was a dog, and I have driven the chief of the Akasava into  the forest. But Sandi told me also that I must do what was just, and  that I have done according to my lights, for I have destroyed a man who  put my people to shame. Now, it seems to me that there is only one thing  to do, and that is to go to Sandi, telling the truth and asking him to  judge.\"    \"Lord king,\" said the oldest of his councillors, \"what if Sandi puts you  to the chain-gang?\"    \"That is with to-morrow,\" quoth the king, and gave orders for  preparations to be made for departure.    Half-way to headquarters the two met; King Peter going down and Sanders  coming up. And here befell the great incident.    No word was spoken of Peter's fault before sunset; but when blue smoke  arose from the fires of Houssa and warrior, and the little camp in the  forest clearing was all a-chatter, Sanders took the king's arm and led  him along the forest path.    Peter told his tale and Sanders listened.    \"And what of the chief of the Akasava?\" he asked.    \"Master,\" said the king, \"he fled to the forest cursing me, and with him  went many bad men.\"    Sanders nodded again gravely.    They talked of many things till the sun threw long shadows, and then  they turned to retrace their footsteps. They were within half a mile of  the camp and the faint noise of men laughing, and the faint scent of  fires burning came to them, when the chief of the Akasava stepped out  from behind a tree and stood directly in their path. With him were some  eight fighting men fully armed.    \"Lord king,\" said the chief of the Akasava, \"I have been waiting for  you.\"    The king made neither movement nor reply, but Sanders reached for his  revolver.    His hand closed on the butt, when something struck him and he went down  like a log.    \"Now we will kill the king of the Isisi, and the white man also.\" The  voice was the chief's, but Sanders was not taking any particular  interest in the conversation, because there was a hive of wild bees  buzzing in his head, and a maze of pain; he felt sick.    \"If you kill me it is little matter,\" said the king's voice, \"because  there are many men who can take my place; but if you slay Sandi, you  slay the father of the people, and none can replace him.\"    \"He whipped you, little king,\" said the chief of the Akasava mockingly.    \"I would throw him into the river,\" said a strange voice after a long  interval; \"thus shall no trace be found of him, and no man will lay his  death to our door.\"    \"What of the king?\" said another. Then came a crackling of twigs and the  voices of men.    \"They are searching,\" whispered a voice. \"King, if you speak I will kill  you now.\"    \"Kill!\" said the young king's even voice, and shouted, \"Oh, M'sabo!  Beteli! Sandi is here!\"    That was all Sandi heard.           *     *     *     *     *    Two days later he sat up in bed and demanded information. There was a  young doctor with him when he woke, who had providentially arrived from  headquarters.    \"The king?\" he hesitated. \"Well, they finished the king, but he saved  your life. I suppose you know that?\"    Sanders said \"Yes\" without emotion.    \"A plucky little beggar,\" suggested the doctor.    \"Very,\" said Sanders. Then: \"Did they catch the chief of the Akasava?\"    \"Yes; he was so keen on finishing you that he delayed his bolting. The  king threw himself on you and covered your body.\"    \"That will do.\"    Sanders' voice was harsh and his manner brusque at the best of times,  but now his rudeness was brutal.    \"Just go out of the hut, doctor--I want to sleep.\"    He heard the doctor move, heard the rattle of the \"chick\" at the hut  door, then he turned his face to the wall and wept.            CHAPTER II.      KEEPERS OF THE STONE.      There is a people who live at Ochori in the big African forest on the  Ikeli River, who are called in the native tongue \"The Keepers of the  Stone.\"    There is a legend that years and years ago, _cala-cala_, there was a  strange, flat stone, \"inscribed with the marks of the devils\" (so the  grave native story-teller puts it), which was greatly worshipped and  prized, partly for its magic powers, and partly because of the two  ghosts who guarded it.    It was a fetish of peculiar value to the mild people who lived in the  big forest, but the Akasava, who are neither mild nor reverential, and  being, moreover, in need of gods, swooped down upon the Ochori one red  morning and came away with this wonderful stone and other movables.  Presumably, the \"ghosts of brass\" went also. It was a great business,  securing the stone, for it was set in a grey slab in the solid rock, and  many spear-heads were broken before it could be wrenched from its place.  But in the end it was taken away, and for several years it was the boast  of the Akasava that they derived much benefit from this sacred  possession. Then of a sudden the stone disappeared, and with it all the  good fortune of its owners. For the vanishing of the stone coincided  with the arrival of British rule, and it was a bad thing for the  Akasava.    There came in these far-off days ('95?) a ridiculous person in white  with an escort of six soldiers. He brought a message of peace and good  fellowship, and talked of a new king and a new law. The Akasava listened  in dazed wonderment, but when they recovered they cut off his head, also  the heads of the escort. It seemed to be the only thing to do under the  circumstances.    Then one morning the Akasava people woke to find the city full of  strange white folk, who had come swiftly up the river in steamboats.  There were too many to quarrel with, so the people sat quiet, a little  frightened and very curious, whilst two black soldiers strapped the  hands and feet of the Akasava chief prior to hanging him by the neck  till he was dead.    Nor did the bad luck of the people end here; there came a lean year,  when the manioc[1] root was bad and full of death-water, when goats  died, and crops were spoilt by an unexpected hurricane. There was always  a remedy at hand for a setback of this kind. If you have not the thing  you require, go and take it. So, following precedents innumerable, the  Akasava visited the Ochori, taking away much grain, and leaving behind  dead men and men who prayed for death. In the course of time the white  men came with their steamboats, their little brass guns, and the  identical block and tackle, which they fastened to the identical tree  and utilised in the inevitable manner.    \"It appears,\" said the new chief--who was afterwards hanged for the  killing of the king of the Isisi--\"that the white man's law is made to  allow weak men to triumph at the expense of the strong. This seems  foolish, but it will be well to humour them.\"    His first act was to cut down the hanging-tree--it was too conspicuous  and too significant. Then he set himself to discover the cause of all  the trouble which had come upon the Akasava. The cause required little  appreciation. The great stone had been stolen, as he well knew, and the  remedy resolved itself into a question of discovering the thief. The  wretched Ochori were suspect.    \"If we go to them,\" said the chief of the Akasava thoughtfully, \"killing  them very little, but rather burning them, so that they told where this  godstone was hidden, perhaps the Great Ones would forgive us.\"    \"In my young days,\" said an aged councillor, \"when evil men would not  tell where stolen things were buried, we put hot embers in their hands  and bound them tightly.\"    \"That is a good way,\" approved another old man, wagging his head  applaudingly; \"also to tie men in the path of the soldier-ants has been  known to make them talkative.\"    \"Yet we may not go up against the Ochori for many reasons,\" said the  chief; \"the principal of which is that if the stone be with them we  shall not overcome them owing to the two ghosts--though I do not  remember that the ghosts were very potent in the days when the stone was  with us,\" he added, not without hope.    The little raid which followed and the search for the stone are told  briefly in official records. The search was fruitless, and the Akasava  folk must needs content themselves with such picking as came to hand.    Of how Mr. Niceman, the deputy commissioner, and then Sanders himself,  came up, I have already told. That was long ago, as the natives say,  _cala-cala_, and many things happened subsequently that put from the  minds of the people all thought of the stone.    In course of time the chief of the Akasava died the death for various  misdoings, and peace came to the land that fringes Togo.           *     *     *     *     *    Sanders has been surprised twice in his life. Once was at Ikeli, which  in the native tongue means \"little river.\" It is not a little river at  all, but, on the contrary, a broad, strong, sullen stream that swirls  and eddies and foams as it swings the corner of its tortuous course  seaward. Sanders sat on a deck-chair placed under the awning of his tiny  steamer, and watched the river go rushing past. He was a contented man,  for the land was quiet and the crops were good. Nor was there any crime.    There was sleeping sickness at Bofabi, and beri-beri at Akasava, and in  the Isisi country somebody had discovered a new god, and, by all  accounts that came down river, they worshipped him night and day.    He was not bothering about new gods, because gods of any kind were a  beneficent asset. Milini, the new king of the Isisi, had sent him word:    \"Master,\" said his mouthpiece, the messenger, \"this new god lives in a  box which is borne upon the shoulders of priests. It is so long and so  wide, and there are four sockets in which the poles fit, and the god  inside is a very strong one, and full of pride.\"    \"Ko, ko!\" said Sanders, with polite interest, \"tell the lord king, your  master, that so long as this god obeys the law, he "]]]
