We had already instructed the girl in her  duties: we would move slowly, and she should guide us, by pointing  either to the right or the left.           *       *       *       *       *    I will confess I gave a last long, lingering look at the shore before  the hatch of the conning tower was clamped down. I was not exactly  afraid, but I wondered if I would ever step foot on solid land again.    Standing in the conning tower beside Mercer, I watched the sea rise at  an angle to meet us, and I dodged instinctively as the first green  wave pelted against the thick porthole through which I was looking. An  instant later the water closed over the top of the conning tower, and  at a gentle angle we nosed towards the bottom of the sea.    An account of the trip itself, perhaps, does not belong in this  record. It was not a pleasant adventure in itself, for the _Santa  Maria_, like every undersea craft, I suppose, was close, smelly, and  cramped. We proceeded very slowly, for only by so doing could our  guide keep her bearings, and how she found the way was a mystery to  all of us. We could see but very little, despite the clearness of the  water.    It was by no means a sight-seeing trip. For various reasons, Mercer  had cut our crew to the minimum. We had two navigating officers,  experienced submarine men both, and five sailors, also experienced in  undersea work. With such a short crew, Mercer and I were both kept  busy.           *       *       *       *       *    Bonnett, the captain, was a tall, dark chap, stooped from years in the  low, cramped quarters of submarines. Duke, our second-officer, was a  youngster hardly out of his 'teens, and as clever as they come. And  although both of them, and the crew as well, must have been agog with  questions, neither by word nor look did they express their feelings.  Mercer had paid for obedience without curiosity, and he got it.    We spent the first night on the bottom, for the simple reason that had  we come to the surface, we might have come down into territory  unfamiliar to our guide. As soon as the first faint light began to  filter down, however, we proceeded, and Mercer and I crowded together  into the conning tower.    \"We're close,\" said Mercer. \"See how excited they are, all three of  them.\"    The three strange creatures were holding onto the chains and staring  over the bulging side of the ship. Every few seconds the girl turned  and looked back at us, smiling, her eyes shining with excitement.  Suddenly she pointed straight down, and held out her arm in  unmistakable gesture. We were to stop.           *       *       *       *       *    Mercer conveyed the order instantly to Bonnett at the controls, and  all three of our guides dived gracefully off the ship and disappeared  into the depths below.    \"Let her settle to the bottom, Bonnett,\" ordered Mercer. \"Slowly ...  slowly....\"    Bonnett handled the ship neatly, keeping her nicely trimmed. We came  to rest on the bottom in four or five seconds, and as Mercer and I  stared out eagerly through the round glass ports of the conning  tower, we could see, very dimly, a cluster of dark, rounded  projections cropping out from the bed of the ocean. We were only a few  yards from the edge of the girl's village.    The scene was exactly as we had pictured it, save that it was not  nearly as clear and well lighted. I realized that our eyes were not  accustomed to the gloom, as were those of the girl and her people, but  I could distinguish the vague outlines of the houses, and the slowly  swaying shapes of monstrous growths.    \"Well, Taylor,\" said Mercer, his voice shaking with excitement, \"here  we are! And here\"--peering out through the glass-covered port  again--\"are her people!\"           *       *       *       *       *    The whole village was swarming around us. White bodies hovered around  us as moths around a light. Faces pressed against the ports and stared  in at us with great, amazed eyes.    Then, suddenly the crowd of curious creatures parted, and the girl  came darting up with the five ancients she had showed us before. They  were evidently the council responsible for the government of the  village, or something of the sort, for the other villagers bowed their  heads respectfully as they passed.    The girl came close to the port through which I was looking, and  gestured earnestly. Her face was tense and anxious, and from time to  time she glanced over her shoulder, as though she feared the coming of  an enemy.    \"Our time's short, I take it, if we are to be of service,\" said  Mercer. \"Come on, Taylor; into the diving suits!\"    I signaled the girl that we understood, and would hurry. Then I  followed Mercer into our tiny stateroom.    \"Remember what I've told you,\" he said, as we slipped into the heavy  woolen undergarments we were to wear inside the suits. \"You understand  how to handle your air, I believe, and you'll have no difficulty  getting around in the suit if you'll just remember to go slowly. Your  job is to get the whole village to get away when the enemy is sighted.  Get them to come this way from the village, towards the ship,  understand. The current comes from this direction; the way the  vegetation bends shows that. And keep the girl's people away until I  signal you to let them return. And remember to take your electric  lantern. Don't burn it more than is necessary; the batteries are not  large and the bulb draws a lot of current. Ready?\"           *       *       *       *       *    I was, but I was shaking a little as the men helped me into the mighty  armor that was to keep the pressure of several atmospheres from  crushing my body. The helmet was the last piece to be donned; when it  was screwed in place I stood there like a mummy, almost completely  rigid.    Quickly we were put into the air lock, together with a large iron box  containing a number of things Mercer needed. Darkness and water rushed  in on us. The water closed over my head. I became aware of the soft,  continuous popping sounds of the air-bubbles escaping from the relief  valve of the head-piece.    For a moment I was dizzy and more than a little nauseated. I could  feel the cold sweat pricking my forehead. Then there was a sudden glow  of light from before me, and I started walking towards it. I found I  could walk now; not easily, but, after I caught the trick of it,  without much difficulty. I could move my arms, too, and the  interlocking hooks that served me for fingers. When my real fingers  closed upon a little cross-bar at the end of the armored arms, and  pulled the bars towards me, the steel claws outside came together,  like a thumb and two fingers.           *       *       *       *       *    In a moment we stood upon the bottom of the ocean. I turned my head  inside the helmet, and there, beside me, was the sleek, smooth side  of the _Santa Maria_. On my other side was Mercer, a huge, dim figure  in his diving armor. He made an awkward gesture towards his head, and  I suddenly remembered something.    Before me, where I could operate it with a thrusting movement of my  chin, was a toggle switch. I snapped it over, and heard Mercer's  voice: \"--n't forget everything I tell him.\"    \"I know it,\" I said mentally to him. \"I was rather rattled. O.K. now,  however. Anything I can do?\"    \"Yes. Help me with this box, and then get the girl to put on the  antenna you'll find there. Don't forget the knife and the light.\"    \"Right!\" I bent over the box with him, and we both came near falling.  We opened the lid, however, and I hooked the knife and the light into  their proper places outside my armor. Then, with the antenna for the  girl, so that we could establish connections with her, and through  her, with the villagers, I moved off.    This antenna was entirely different from the one used in previous  experiments. The four cross-members that clasped the head were finer,  and at their junction was a flat black circular box, from which rose a  black rod some six inches in height, and topped by a black sphere half  the size of my fist.           *       *       *       *       *    These perfected thought-telegraphs (I shall continue to use my own  designation for them, as clearer and more understandable than  Mercer's) did not need connecting wires; they conveyed their impulses  by Hertzian waves to a master receiver on the _Santa Maria_, which  amplified them and re-broadcast them so that each of us could both  send and receive at any time.    As I turned, I found the girl beside me, waiting anxiously. Behind her  were the five ancients. I slipped the antenna over her head, and  instantly she began telling me that danger was imminent.    To facilitate matters, I shall describe her messages as though she  spoke; indeed, her pictures were as clear, almost, as speech in my  native tongue. And at times she did use certain sound-words; it was in  this way that I learned, by inference, that her name was _Imee_, that  her people were called _Teemorn_ (this may have been the name of the  community, or perhaps it was interchangeable--I am not sure) and that  the shark-faced people were the _Rorn_.    \"The Rorn come!\" she said quickly. \"Two days past, the three came  again, and our old men refused to give up the slaves. Today they will  return, these Rorn, and my people, the Teemorn will all be made dead!\"           *       *       *       *       *    Then I told her what Mercer had said: that she and every one of her  people must flee swiftly and hide, beyond the boat, a distance beyond  the village. Mercer and I would wait here, and when the Rorn came, it  was they who would be made dead, as we had promised. Although how, I  admitted to myself, being careful to hide the thought that she might  not sense it, I didn't know. We had been too busy since the girl's  arrival to go into details.    She turned and spoke quickly to the old men. They looked at me  doubtfully,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29816"],[0,"The Industries of Animals (#4)"],[1," perhaps on account of the nature of the venom, which is  not identical in all species. The tortured creature may regain life at  the end of some hours. Thus the _Cerceris_ is obliged to destroy the  upper part of the neck by repeated malaxation of that part for several  minutes at a time. The effect of this second act, by injuring the  cerebroid ganglia, is to render impossible the return of action;  moreover, it permits the aggressor to satisfy personal gluttony, and  to feed on the liquids of the organism of the vanquished, which is  easy, because the dorsal blood-vessel passes at this level. It can  thus satisfy a personal need while thinking of the future of the race.        [9] J. H. Fabre, _Souvenirs entomologiques_, pp. 225 _et seq._       [10] \"Etude sur l'Instinct du _Cerceris ornata_,\" _Archives          de Zoologie experimentale_, ii. Serie, t. 5, 1887.    It has been said in this connection that in such cases the sure  instinct with which these species were originally endowed has been  distorted, but that is to admit some degree of variation; the  hypothesis of degeneration is as gratuitous as the other, and if we go  so far as to risk a hypothesis, it would be better to use it to  explain facts and not to entangle them.    _Plan of study of the various industries._--The different industries  carried on by animals may be divided into a certain number of groups.  In the case of each of these categories I propose to arrange the facts  in such a way as to bring forward first those animals which, having no  special organs, are obliged to exercise the greatest ingenuity, and  then to indicate the facts which show how variations have arisen which  enable other species to accomplish these acts with marvellous ease.    We will first examine the simplest industries: hunting and fishing,  those industries of which the object is the immediate search for prey;  and to these may be added those which are related to them as re-action  is to action--that is to say, the industries of which the effect is to  provide for the immediate safety of the individual.    Then in an exposition parallel to the march of progress followed by  human civilisations, we shall study among animals the art of  collecting provisions, of domesticating and exploiting flocks, of  reducing their fellows to slavery.    Finally, we shall investigate the series of modifications which the  dwelling undergoes, and we shall see how certain species, after having  constructed admirably-arranged houses, know how to make them healthy,  and how to defend them against attacks from without.

It is easy to understand that the herbivora need little  ingenuity in seeking nourishment; they are so superior to their prey  that they can obtain it and feed on it by the sole fact of an  organisation adapted to its assimilation. They are, it is true, at the  mercy of circumstances over which they have no control, and which lead  to famine. The carnivora also may have to suffer from the absence of  prey, but even in the most favourable seasons, and in the regions  where the animals on which they live abound, it is necessary to them  to develop a special activity to obtain possession of beings who are  suspicious, prompt in flight, and as fleet as themselves. Thus it is  among these that we expect to find the art of hunting most cultivated;  especially if we put aside the more grossly carnivorous of them, whose  whole organisation is adapted for rapid and effective results.    _Different methods of hunting._--Like Man, some animals hunt in ambush  or by coursing; others know how to overturn the desired victim by  throwing some object at it. These profit by all the exterior  circumstances which are capable of frightening the game, of stunning  it, and of rendering capture easy. But it is by studying each separate  feature that we shall best be able to observe the close way in which  these industries are related to our own. It is impossible to bring  forward all the facts relating to the search for prey among animals;  we can only take a few as signposts which mark the road.    _Hunting in ambush._--The most rudimentary method of hunting in ambush  is simply to take advantage of some favourable external circumstance  to obtain concealment, and then to await the approach of the prey.  Some animals place themselves behind a tuft of grass, others thrust  themselves into a thicket, or hang on to the branch of a tree in order  to fall suddenly on the victim who innocently approaches the  perfidious ambush. The Crocodile, as described by Sir Samuel Baker,  conceals himself by his skill in plunging noiselessly. On the bank a  group of birds have alighted. They search the mud for insects or  worms, or simply to approach the stream to drink or bathe. In spite of  his great size and robust appetite the Crocodile does not disdain this  slight dish; but the least noise, the least wrinkle on the surface of  the water would cause the future repast to vanish. The reptile  plunges, the birds continue without suspicion to come and go. Suddenly  there emerges before them the huge open jaw armed with formidable  teeth. In the moment of stupor and immobility which this unforeseen  apparition produces a few imprudent birds have disappeared within the  reptile's mouth, while the others fly away. In the same sly and brutal  manner he snaps up dogs, horses, oxen, and even men who come to the  river to drink.    One of the most dangerous ambushes which can be met on the road by  animals who resort to a spring is that prepared by the Python. This  gigantic snake hangs by his tail to the branch of a tree and lets  himself droop down like a long creeper. The victim who comes within  his reach is seized, enrolled, pounded in the knots which the snake  forms around him. It is not necessary to multiply examples of this  simple and widespread method of hunting.    Not content with utilising the natural arrangements they meet with,  there are animals which construct genuine ambushes, acting thus like  Man, who builds in the middle or on the edge of ponds, cabins in which  to await wild ducks, or who digs in the path of a lion a hole covered  with trunks of trees, at the bottom of which he may kill the beast  without danger. Certain insects practise this method of hunting. The  Fox, for instance, so skilful a hunter in many respects, constructs an  ambush when hunting hares.[11]       [11] C. St. John, _Wild Sports, etc._, chap. xx.    The larva of the Tiger Beetle (_Cicindela campestris_) constructs a  hole about the size of a feather quill, disposed vertically, and of a  depth, enormous for its size, of forty centimetres. It maintains  itself in this tube by arching its supple body along the walls at a  height sufficient for the top of its head to be level with the surface  of the soil, and to close the opening of the hole. (Fig. 1.) A little  insect--an ant, a young beetle, or something similar--passes. As soon  as it begins to walk on the head of the larva, the latter letting go  its hold of the wall allows itself to fall to the bottom of the trap,  dragging its victim with it. In this narrow prison it is easily able  to obtain the mastery over its prey, and to suck out the liquid  parts.[12]       [12] Lamarck, _Histoire des Animaux sans Vertebres_, 2e          edition, 1835, p. 676.    [Illustration: FIG. 1.]    The _Staphilinus Caesareus_ acts with still greater shrewdness; not  only is his pit more perfect, but he takes care to remove all traces  of preceding repasts which might render the place obviously one of  carnage. He chooses a stone, beneath which he hollows a  cylindro-conical hole with extremely smooth walls. This hole is not to  serve as a trap, that is to say that the proprietor has no intention  of causing any pedestrian to roll to the bottom. It is simply a place  of concealment in which he awaits the propitious moment. No creature  is more patient than this insect, and no delay discourages him. As  soon as some small animal approaches his hiding-place he throws  himself on it impetuously, kills it, and devours it. Near his ditch he  has hollowed a second of a much coarser character, the walls of which  have not been smoothed with the same care. One here sees elytra and  claws piled up; they are the hard and horny parts which he has not  been able to eat. The heap in this ditch is not then an alimentary  store. It is the _oubliette_ in which the _Staphilinus_ buries the  remains of his victims. If he allowed them to accumulate around his  hole all pedestrians would come to fear this spot and to avoid it. It  would be like the dwelling of a Polypus, which is marked by the  numerous carapaces of crabs and shells which strew the neighbourhood.    The ambuscade of the Ant-lion is classic; it does not differ greatly  from the others. He excavates a conical pitfall, in which he conceals  himself, and seizes the unfortunate ants and other insects whom  ill-chance causes to roll into it.[13]       [13] See _e.g._ Tennent, _Ceylon_, vol. i. p. 252.
