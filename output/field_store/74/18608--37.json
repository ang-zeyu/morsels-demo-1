Late in the afternoon several dozen did likewise close to the same  place. At this period I did not get farther upstream to note how many  might be passing there. On June 14, while the river ice was breaking up  but while the bay ice was holding firm, two bucks moved about on the  latter, just off the river's mouth. They appeared to be seeking a safe  crossing. The smaller of the two almost invariably preceded, just as if  it were aware that it would be less likely to break through than its  companion. For the most part they walked rather sedately, but now and  then took up a very leisurely trot. On the following day a dozen crossed  Windy Bay at about the same place. These were the last ones seen on the  ice in June. Though the ice remained on the bay for some days longer, it  had evidently become unsafe.    Thereafter the Caribou obviously preferred the short passage of Windy  River (no more than 50 or 60 yards wide in places) to a swim of half a  mile or so across Windy Bay. So they appeared in considerable numbers on  the south bank of the river, reconnoitering for a suitable place to  cross. Many were deterred by movements or sounds in our camp on the  north bank, including the yelping invariably set up by the tethered  Husky dogs whenever they would catch sight of Caribou; the latter would  then be likely either to retreat behind the ridges or to pass upstream  along the south bank. Along the half-mile extent of this bank visible  from our camp, I noted the following making the passage of the river by  swimming: June 18, a band of half a dozen; June 20, a band of three  landing practically in our dooryard and about 14 crossing at the mouth;  June 21, six crossing at the mouth; June 24, about 10 (mostly big bucks)  landing just above the camp. On the morning of July 1 a buck swam across  the bay just off the river's mouth, and a little later a band of about  11--the last seen on the spring migration--were trotting upstream along  the south bank.    Various groups observed during June, principally on the south side of  the bay and the river, furnished memorable spectacles. Besides resorting  to open areas on the frozen lakes and rivers for their resting periods,  the Caribou will also select some commanding hilltop for the same  purpose. On June 3 a band of 75 appeared in midday on the summit of a  rocky hill (\"Caribou Knoll,\" map 1) rising to a height of some 150 feet  on the far side of Windy River. While some kept on feeding, many of them  lay down on snowbanks, apparently preferring these to the plentiful  patches of bare ground, and doubtless passing the time by chewing their  cuds. The velvet of the bucks' new antlers was plainly visible through  field-glasses. In the variety of their attitudes on this rocky height  the animals were disposed perhaps more like alpine Chamois than like the  generally conceived masses of Caribou on the low Barrens. What a subject  for a Millais!    It appears likely that the higher elevations may serve for the nocturnal  rest as well as for a noonday siesta. During the evening of June 1, for  instance, some 75 Caribou in a loose aggregation were feeding over the  summit of Josie's Hill, beyond the junction of Windy and South bays. On  June 20 I was enjoying a wonderfully clear and golden light that was  cast on the imposing mass of this hill as the sun was setting at my back  about 9 o'clock. The glory of that scene was enhanced by picking out  with the naked eye, at a distance of a couple of miles, two separate  bands of 12 to 15 Caribou making their way upward toward the broad,  plateaulike summit. Meanwhile a lone Caribou was outlined against the  sky on one of the rocky ridges to the south. Might not these various  movements have indicated a common urge to spend the semi-darkness of the  Arctic summer night on some high, open area where a good lookout for  Wolves could be kept?    About 2 p.m. on June 15, a herd, perhaps half a hundred strong, appeared  on a ridge directly across the river from camp. The animals made a  lovely spectacle as they stood for a time, despite certain human  movements in camp. Then they moved off upstream. A couple of hours later  about 15 Caribou were feeding quietly on the south bank. On the  following morning a band of 20 were doing likewise in nearly the same  place. Among them were a patriarchal buck (apparently the leader),  several other bucks, various does (one with hard horns), and a large  proportion of yearlings. The bucks in general were lighter in  color--more buffy; the does and yearlings, a sort of smoke gray. They  seemed to be feeding to some extent on the patches of crowberry and  dwarf birch. Presently they trotted off upstream, almost but not quite  in single file, for a couple marched out of line with the others.    On June 17 a band of about 20 appeared at a distance of 125 yards on the  brow of a low hill near Stump Lake. Nearly all were big bucks, with  velvety antlers up to about 20 inches in length. Perhaps three in the  band were hornless--if not does, then young bucks that had very recently  shed their antlers. Two of the bigger bucks were in the lead. At first  the band came toward me, then went off at a tangent at a good pace,  splashed across a little stream in a spirited action, and disappeared  over the next ridge.    Out of several bands appearing on June 20 on the opposite side of the  river, one of about 14 individuals came down the slope near the mouth,  took to the water at once, and made for the north shore. A strong buck  landed first, and farthest upstream; others did nearly as well, but some  of the smaller animals were swept by the strong current down into the  bay and probably landed beyond the point. On reaching the shore, and  even some minutes afterward, several of the Caribou could be seen  shaking the water from their fur in doglike fashion.    On the morning of June 21 a dozen came to the ridge across the river,  briefly inspected the camp, and retreated. In a short time they  returned, four antlered bucks in the lead, and some hornless individuals  in the rear (almost in a separate band). Three of the bucks stood side  by side, looking long and earnestly at the camp, while the others  grazed. Finally dissatisfied with the prospect, they made off upstream.    A little before 7 p.m. on the same day six Caribou appeared on the same  ridge. For once the dogs were inattentive and silent. After promenading  back and forth along the brow, the Caribou disappeared on the far side  of the ridge; but in a few moments they were in the water at the river's  mouth, in very close formation, three of them swimming abreast. There  were three good bucks and three smaller, hornless animals. After they  got ashore at the opposite point, there was wagging of tails and shaking  of ears, heads, and bodies, while the water flew off in a spray. Then  they leisurely proceeded along the shore and around the point.    About 7 p.m. on June 24 some 10 Caribou (mostly big bucks) swam the  river and landed immediately above our camp. The last two, I noted, were  heading almost upstream in the current that was running 6-8 miles per  hour. They swam high, with the whole line of the back 2 or 3 inches out  of the water and with the antlers tilted back to keep the snout above  the surface. On landing, the animals hastened to the top of the Camp  Ridge and ran off along it, while the chained and frustrated dogs  expressed their feelings in the usual manner.    As I was retiring to my tent on the Camp Ridge in the twilight about  11:30 p.m. on June 29, I noticed a Caribou in the opposite edge of the  river, about 125 yards away. For the most part it stood in about a foot  of water and kept watching upstream. After some minutes I moved closer,  right along the skyline; I waved a white pillow at it and shouted  several times, but still it would not leave. Eventually it did move a  few feet back from the water's edge and there appeared to browse on some  dwarf birches.    The next day, watching from Pile o' Rocks northwest of camp, I noticed  three Caribou passing on a northeasterly course. They walked for the  most part, but now and again trotted. They were two well-antlered bucks  and a smaller individual with shorter horns. One of the former paused to  graze in a green-sprouting sedge bog. It was perhaps such fresh summer  vegetation that had helped to produce fat an inch thick on the haunches  of an animal secured about this date.    The area near the western border of Keewatin, lying at some distance  south of Dubawnt Lake and west of the upper Kazan River, does not appear  to attract large numbers of Caribou. Just once, in May, Charles Schweder  has found them crossing a lake which he considered Dubawnt, but may have  been Kamiluk. In his trapping excursions in that area he has found  trails and other signs all along the way, indicating that the animals at  least pass through on their migrations.      _Summer interlude_    After July 1 no more Caribou were seen about the Windy River for five  weeks. From information supplied by Charles Schweder, it appears that  virtually all of the animals desert the southern portion of the Barren  Grounds at this season. Before dropping their fawns, the does pass on  for an undetermined distance to the northward of that portion of the  upper Kazan River lying immediately below Ennadai Lake. The rear guard  of the northward migration seems to be composed mainly of bucks and a  few barren does.    A general veil of mystery seems so far to have enshrouded most of the  natal places (except the islands along the Arctic mainland coast) and  the first few weeks in the life of the Caribou fawns.      _Fall migration in the Nueltin Lake region_    In former times the southward migration reached the Nueltin Lake region  in July (_cf._ Downes, 1943: 203-237), sometimes"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33748"],[0,"The Kitchen Encyclopedia (#4)"],[1,"temperatures. A vacuum is an excellent non-conductor of  heat and is employed in the Thermos bottles advertised for use on  automobile trips, but a vacuum is expensive and difficult to obtain,  which accounts for the high price of Thermos bottles. The effort has  been to find some insulating agent within the means of the average  housewife. This has now been done in the metal-lined cookers.    The explanation of the cooking principle is equally simple. Ordinarily  we heat food to a certain temperature, say, the boiling point, and then  we leave it over the fire for some time, not to get hotter, that would  be impossible, but to keep it at the same degree of heat, and to do this  we must, on account of radiation into the surrounding atmosphere, keep  on supplying heat. In the fireless cooker the heat once generated is  conserved, and there is no need to add thereto.    Herein lies the economy in fuel. You have only to burn gas long enough  to bring the food to the boiling point, and the fireless cooker does the  rest. You can put dinner on to cook, and go to work, to the theatre, to  visit a friend, or read, or sew, without giving your meal any further  attention till time to serve it. This sounds like a fairy tale, but it  is absolutely true.    By the fireless cooker you save nine-tenths of the fuel, and ninety-nine  hundredths of your temper, your time, and your labor. You do not become  perspiring and cross in a hot kitchen. You do not have scorched pots and  kettles to scrape and scour and wash.    Another point in favor of fireless cooking is that it is attended by  absolutely no odors. Such vegetables as onions and cabbage can be cooked  without any one's suspecting they are in the house.    The economy in using the fireless cooker is not confined solely to a  saving in gas and labor. There is also an actual and great economy in  food, for there is almost no waste in this method of cooking. Take for  example a 5-pound piece of beef from the round. Put this in the kettle  of the fireless cooker with a pint of water for each pound of meat.  Heat it on the gas range slowly, taking about twenty minutes to bring it  to the boiling point. Then, according to directions, place it in the  fireless cooker and finish the cooking. When it is done and tender, it  will be found that there is only a minute loss in weight; to be exact, 2  ounces for 5 pounds. You bought 5 pounds of meat and have to serve on  your table 4 pounds and 14 ounces. You could not make any such showing  if you had cooked the meat on a gas or coal range.    Four pounds and 14 ounces, however, is not all that you have to serve.  You originally added to your meat 5 pints of water. A little of this  evaporated or cooked away in the twenty minutes primary cooking on the  stove. All the rest is retained, for there is absolutely no evaporation  in a fireless cooker. This water has added to it the nutritive value and  flavor acquired from the meat. So besides your 4 pounds and 14 ounces of  meat you have over 4 pints of rich soup stock which has cost you  absolutely nothing, as it is a by-product of the system of fireless  cooking.    \"But,\" objects some one, \"the meat cooked in such wise will have lost  all its juice and flavor.\" On the contrary, there is a distinct gain in  the matter of flavor in fireless cookery. We absolutely know this to be  so, for we have had various cuts of meat, especially the cheaper cuts,  cooked in a fireless cooker and the dishes so prepared have been  submitted to competent judges; the opinion was unanimous that there was  a real difference between the flavor of meats so cooked and that of  corresponding cuts cooked after the usual methods, and that the delicacy  and richness of flavor lay with those meats cooked by the fireless  method.    When one understands the principles of cookery this richness of flavor  of meats cooked by the fireless method is not surprising. Every one  knows the proverbial deliciousness of French cookery. The special  peculiarity of the French cuisine is the long, slow simmering of meats  in closely covered earthen pots called casseroles. The principle is  essentially that of the fireless cooker, but the casserole not being  insulated, the French cook is obliged to keep on supplying a sufficient  degree of heat to keep the casserole warm and its contents simmering.    Examples of fireless cooking with which many persons are familiar by  experience or hearsay are the foods cooked in primitive ways, whose  deliciousness is generally ascribed to the \"hunger sauce\" that  accompanies outdoor cookery. Among such examples are the burying of the  saucepan in a hole in the ground, the cooking of food by dropping heated  stones into the mixture, and the clambake known among the Narragansett  Indians. In all these cases we have the principle of the fireless  cooker--_i. e._, closely-covered food slowly cooked at low temperature.  Indeed, one fireless cooker is constructed directly on the principle  employed in the New England clambake, and every one knows the  deliciousness of food so cooked has become proverbial.    By the fireless cooker the cheaper cuts of meat can be cooked so that  they are delicious, appetizing, tender. There is here a distinct saving  in money, for by the employment of the fireless method of cooking, the  cheaper cuts of meat can be made to serve all the purposes of the  higher-priced pieces. Further, if the meats are stewed, boiled, or  steamed, you also acquire at no cost whatever as many pints of delicious  soup stock, less one, as you have pounds of meat.    Let us now recapitulate the advantages of fireless cooking:--      A Fireless Cooker Saves Money    1. Because by its use cheaper meats can be made to answer as well as  higher-priced cuts.    2. Because out of a given quantity of raw material you get, after the  cooking is done, more actual food than by any other method.      A Fireless Cooker Saves Fuel    You have only to burn your gas twenty minutes for a 5-pound piece of  meat for fireless cooking, whereas by the usual method you would burn  the gas two to four hours, according to the way you desired the meat  cooked.      A Fireless Cooker Saves Time    Because you have only to watch the meat until it boils. By the usual  method you must attend to it all the hours it is on cooking.      A Fireless Cooker Saves Irritation and Worry    For by this method of cooking the housewife knows that the food cannot  burn or overcook.      A Fireless Cooker Adds to the Intellectual Expansion and the Pleasures  of the Family    Because it gives the mother time from her kitchen to oversee the  development of her children, and to share with them and their father  their pleasures and interests.      To the Wage-earning Woman    the fireless cooker is a positive godsend. She can put food into the  cooker before going to work, and return to find her meal all ready.      If the Housewife Lives in the City    and has to serve dinner at night all the preliminary cooking can be done  at noon, and the meal placed in the fireless cooker till evening.      To the Bachelor Girl    who lives by means of a kitchenette, and must do her cooking in what is  at once parlor, bedroom and kitchen, what a blessing is the absence of  heat and odors that the fireless cooker assures.      In Conclusion    we quote from a bulletin published by the University of Illinois, in  which a study is made of the methods of roasting and cooking meats. The  authors found that there was no advantage in cooking meat in a very hot  oven (385 degrees Fahrenheit), but rather a difficulty to keep it from  burning; that in an oven which was about 350 degrees Fahrenheit the meat  cooked better; and that in an Aladdin oven, which kept the meat at 212  degrees Fahrenheit, it cooked best of all--that is, it was of more  uniform character all through, more juicy and more highly flavored.  These findings point to an advantage in fireless cooking, and Miss  Mitchell asserts that practical experience bears it out. With regard to  meats cooked in water in the cooker, Miss Mitchell asserts that  experience has shown that they become well done and are more tender than  when boiled, showing that the temperatures necessary to reach that  degree of cooking are obtained even in the center of a large piece of  meat, without toughening or hardening the outside of the meat, as is  done when more intense heat is applied.          Recipes      The following recipes are for the cheaper cuts of meat exclusively, and  employ one or another of the preceding methods. Note that in all the  recipes the two general rules for tender and juicy meat are observed.  The outside of the meat is first quickly seared over to prevent the  escape of the juices, and after the first five minutes the heat is  reduced so as not to harden the albumen. Boiled or fricasseed meats  should cook slowly. If meat is boiled at a gallop the connective tissue  is destroyed, the meat falls from the bones in strings, and is hard and  leathery.    For stews, meat en casserole, or in any fashion where water is used in  the cooking, select the round (5), either upper or under. For boiling,  the clod (9) or the round (5) or the extreme lower piece of (3). For  rolled steak, mock fillet, steak a la Flamande, or beefsteak pie, the  flank steak (7) is best. For cheap stews use (10). For beef a la mode,  in a large family use a thick slice of the round (5), for a small family  the clod (9). For soup, use the shin or leg. For beef tea, mince meat,  and beef loaf, the neck is best. The chuck (1) is used only for roasting  or baking, and is good value only for a large family. (2) and (3) are  the standing ribs and carve to the best advantage. The aitch or pin bone  (in 3) is a desirable roast for a large family. (3) is the loin, the  choicest part of the animal. From it come the fillet or tenderloin, the  sirloin, and the porterhouse steaks. (4) is the rump, from which come  good steaks"]]]
