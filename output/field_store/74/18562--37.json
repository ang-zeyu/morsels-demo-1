It was the union of those who  were at that time members of distinct and separate political  communities into one political family, whose power, for certain  specified purposes, was to extend over the whole territory of the  United States. And it gave to each citizen rights and privileges  outside of his State which he did not before possess, and placed him  in every other State upon a perfect equality with its own citizens as  to rights of person and rights of property; it made him a citizen of  the United States.    It becomes necessary, therefore, to determine who were citizens of the  several States when the Constitution was adopted. And in order to do  this, we must recur to the Governments and institutions of the  thirteen colonies, when they separated from Great Britain and formed  new sovereignties, and took their places in the family of independent  nations. We must inquire who, at that time, were recognised as the  people or citizens of a State, whose rights and liberties had been  outraged by the English Government; and who declared their  independence, and assumed the powers of Government to defend their  rights by force of arms.    In the opinion of the court, the legislation and histories of the  times, and the language used in the Declaration of Independence, show,  that neither the class of persons who had been imported as slaves, nor  their descendants, whether they had become free or not, were then  acknowledged as a part of the people, nor intended to be included in  the general words used in that memorable instrument.    It is difficult at this day to realize the state of public opinion in  relation to that unfortunate race, which prevailed in the civilized  and enlightened portions of the world at the time of the Declaration  of Independence, and when the Constitution of the United States was  framed and adopted. But the public history of every European nation  displays it in a manner too plain to be mistaken.    They had for more than a century before been regarded as beings of an  inferior order, and altogether unfit to associate with the white race,  either in social or political relations; and so far inferior, that  they had no rights which the white man was bound to respect; and that  the negro might justly and lawfully be reduced to slavery for his  benefit. He was bought and sold, and treated as an ordinary article of  merchandise and traffic, whenever a profit could be made by it. This  opinion was at that time fixed and universal in the civilized portion  of the white race. It was regarded as an axiom in morals as well as in  politics, which no one thought of disputing, or supposed to be open to  dispute; and men in every grade and position in society daily and  habitually acted upon it in their private pursuits, as well as in  matters of public concern, without doubting for a moment the  correctness of this opinion.    And in no nation was this opinion more firmly fixed or more uniformly  acted upon than by the English Government and English people. They not  only seized them on the coast of Africa, and sold them or held them in  slavery for their own use; but they took them as ordinary articles of  merchandise to every country where they could make a profit on them,  and were far more extensively engaged in this commerce than any other  nation in the world.    The opinion thus entertained and acted upon in England was naturally  impressed upon the colonies they founded on this side of the Atlantic.  And, accordingly, a negro of the African race was regarded by them as  an article of property, and held, and bought and sold as such, in  every one of the thirteen colonies which united in the Declaration of  Independence, and afterwards formed the Constitution of the United  States. The slaves were more or less numerous in the different  colonies, as slave labor was found more or less profitable. But no one  seems to have doubted the correctness of the prevailing opinion of the  time.    The legislation of the different colonies furnishes positive and  indisputable proof of this fact.    It would be tedious, in this opinion, to enumerate the various laws  they passed upon this subject. It will be sufficient, as a sample of  the legislation which then generally prevailed throughout the British  colonies, to give the laws of two of them; one being still a large  slaveholding State, and the other the first State in which slavery  ceased to exist.    The province of Maryland, in 1717, (ch. 13, s. 5,) passed a law  declaring \"that if any free negro or mulatto intermarry with any white  woman, or if any white man shall intermarry with any negro or mulatto  woman, such negro or mulatto shall become a slave during life,  excepting mulattoes born of white women, who, for such intermarriage,  shall only become servants for seven years, to be disposed of as the  justices of the county court, where such marriage so happens, shall  think fit; to be applied by them towards the support of a public  school within the said county. And any white man or white woman who  shall intermarry as aforesaid, with any negro or mulatto, such white  man or white woman shall become servants during the term of seven  years, and shall be disposed of by the justices as aforesaid, and be  applied to the uses aforesaid.\"    The other colonial law to which we refer was passed by Massachusetts  in 1705, (chap. 6.) It is entitled \"An act for the better preventing  of a spurious and mixed issue,\" &c.; and it provides, that \"if any  negro or mulatto shall presume to smite or strike any person of the  English or other Christian nation, such negro or mulatto shall be  severely whipped, at the discretion of the justices before whom the  offender shall be convicted.\"    And \"that none of her Majesty's English or Scottish subjects, nor of  any other Christian nation, within this province, shall contract  matrimony with any negro or mulatto; nor shall any person, duly  authorized to solemnize marriage, presume to join any such in  marriage, on pain of forfeiting the sum of fifty pounds; one moiety  thereof to her Majesty, for and towards the support of the Government  within this province, and the other moiety to him or them that shall  inform and sue for the same, in any of her Majesty's courts of record  within the province, by bill, plaint, or information.\"    We give both of these laws in the words used by the respective  legislative bodies, because the language in which they are framed, as  well as the provisions contained in them, show, too plainly to be  misunderstood, the degraded condition of this unhappy race. They were  still in force when the Revolution began, and are a faithful index to  the state of feeling towards the class of persons of whom they speak,  and of the position they occupied throughout the thirteen colonies, in  the eyes and thoughts of the men who framed the Declaration of  Independence and established the State Constitutions and Governments.  They show that a perpetual and impassable barrier was intended to be  erected between the white race and the one which they had reduced to  slavery, and governed as subjects with absolute and despotic power,  and which they then looked upon as so far below them in the scale of  created beings, that intermarriages between white persons and negroes  or mulattoes were regarded as unnatural and immoral, and punished as  crimes, not only in the parties, but in the person who joined them in  marriage. And no distinction in this respect was made between the free  negro or mulatto and the slave, but this stigma, of the deepest  degradation, was fixed upon the whole race.    We refer to these historical facts for the purpose of showing the  fixed opinions concerning that race, upon which the statesmen of that  day spoke and acted. It is necessary to do this, in order to determine  whether the general terms used in the Constitution of the United  States, as to the rights of man and the rights of the people, was  intended to include them, or to give to them or their posterity the  benefit of any of its provisions.    The language of the Declaration of Independence is equally conclusive:    It begins by declaring that, \"when in the course of human events it  becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which  have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of  the earth the separate and equal station to which the laws of nature  and nature's God entitle them, a decent respect for the opinions of  mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them  to the separation.\"    It then proceeds to say: \"We hold these truths to be self-evident:  that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator  with certain unalienable rights; that among them is life, liberty, and  the pursuit of happiness; that to secure these rights, Governments are  instituted, deriving their just powers from the consent of the  governed.\"    The general words above quoted would seem to embrace the whole human  family, and if they were used in a similar instrument at this day  would be so understood. But it is too clear for dispute, that the  enslaved African race were not intended to be included, and formed no  part of the people who framed and adopted this declaration; for if the  language, as understood in that day, would embrace them, the conduct  of the distinguished men who framed the Declaration of Independence  would have been utterly and flagrantly inconsistent with the  principles they asserted; and instead of the sympathy of mankind, to  which they so confidently appealed, they would have deserved and  received universal rebuke and reprobation.    Yet the men who framed this declaration were great men--high in  literary acquirements--high in their"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31427"],[0,"Miscellaneous Writings, 1883-1896 (#4)"],[1," at this period mutely works  in the interest of both good and evil in a manner least  understood; hence the need of watching, and the danger  of yielding to temptation from causes that at former [20]  periods in human history were not existent. The action  and effects of this so-called human mind in its silent argu-  ments, are yet to be uncovered and summarily dealt with  by divine justice.    In Christian Science, the law of Love rejoices the heart; [25]  and Love is Life and Truth. Whatever manifests aught  else in its effects upon mankind, demonstrably is not Love.  We should measure our love for God by our love for man;  and our sense of Science will be measured by our obedience  to God,--fulfilling the law of Love, doing good to all; [30]  imparting, so far as we reflect them, Truth, Life, and Love  to all within the radius of our atmosphere of thought.    [Page 13.]    The only justice of which I feel at present capable, [1]  is mercy and charity toward every one,--just so far as  one and all permit me to exercise these sentiments toward  them,--taking special care to mind my own business.    The falsehood, ingratitude, misjudgment, and sharp [5]  return of evil for good--yea, the real wrongs (if wrong  can be real) which I have long endured at the hands of  others--have most happily wrought out for me the law  of loving mine enemies. This law I now urge upon the  solemn consideration of all Christian Scientists. Jesus [10]  said, \"If ye love them which love you, what thank have  ye? for sinners also love those that love them.\"          Christian Theism.      Scholastic theology elaborates the proposition that  evil is a factor of good, and that to believe in the reality [15]  of evil is essential to a rounded sense of the existence of  good.    This frail hypothesis is founded upon the basis of mate-  rial and mortal evidence--only upon what the shifting  mortal senses confirm and frail human reason accepts. [20]  The Science of Soul reverses this proposition, overturns  the testimony of the five erring senses, and reveals in  clearer divinity the existence of good only; that is, of  God and His idea.    This postulate of divine Science only needs to be con- [25]  ceded, to afford opportunity for proof of its correctness  and the clearer discernment of good.    Seek the Anglo-Saxon term for God, and you will  find it to be good; then define good as God, and you  will find that good is omnipotence, has all power; it fills [30]    [Page 14.]    all space, being omnipresent; hence, there is neither place [1]  nor power left for evil. Divest your thought, then, of  the mortal and material view which contradicts the ever-  presence and all-power of good; take in only the immor-  tal facts which include these, and where will you see or [5]  feel evil, or find its existence necessary either to the origin  or ultimate of good?    It is urged that, from his original state of perfec-  tion, man has fallen into the imperfection that requires  evil through which to develop good. Were we to [10]  admit this vague proposition, the Science of man could  never be learned; for in order to learn Science, we  begin with the correct statement, with harmony and  its Principle; and if man has lost his Principle and  its harmony, from evidences before him he is inca- [15]  pable of knowing the facts of existence and its con-  comitants: therefore to him evil is as real and eternal  as good, God! This awful deception is evil's umpire  and empire, that good, God, understood, forcibly  destroys. [20]    What appears to mortals from their standpoint to be  the necessity for evil, is proven by the law of opposites  to be without necessity. Good is the primitive Princi-  ple of man; and evil, good's opposite, has no Principle,  and is not, and cannot be, the derivative of good. [25]  Thus evil is neither a primitive nor a derivative, but  is suppositional; in other words, a lie that is incapable  of proof--therefore, wholly problematical.    The Science of Truth annihilates error, deprives evil  of all power, and thereby destroys all error, sin, sickness, [30]  disease, and death. But the sinner is not sheltered from  suffering from sin: he makes a great reality of evil, iden-    [Page 15.]    tifies himself with it, fancies he finds pleasure in it, and [1]  will reap what he sows; hence the sinner must endure  the effects of his delusion until he awakes from it.          The New Birth.      St. Paul speaks of the new birth as \"waiting for the [5]  adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body.\" The  great Nazarene Prophet said, \"Blessed are the pure in  heart: for they shall see God.\" Nothing aside from the  spiritualization--yea, the highest Christianization--of  thought and desire, can give the true perception of God [10]  and divine Science, that results in health, happiness, and  holiness.    The new birth is not the work of a moment. It begins  with moments, and goes on with years; moments of sur-  render to God, of childlike trust and joyful adoption [15]  of good; moments of self-abnegation, self-consecration,  heaven-born hope, and spiritual love.    Time may commence, but it cannot complete, the  new birth: eternity does this; for progress is the law  of infinity. Only through the sore travail of mortal mind [20]  shall soul as sense be satisfied, and man awake in His  likeness. What a faith-lighted thought is this! that  mortals can lay off the \"old man,\" until man is found  to be the image of the infinite good that we name God,  and the fulness of the stature of man in Christ appears. [25]    In mortal and material man, goodness seems in em-  bryo. By suffering for sin, and the gradual fading out  of the mortal and material sense of man, thought is de-  veloped into an infant Christianity; and, feeding at first  on the milk of the Word, it drinks in the sweet revealings [30]    [Page 16.]    of a new and more spiritual Life and Love. These nourish [1]  the hungry hope, satisfy more the cravings for immor-  tality, and so comfort, cheer, and bless one, that he saith:  In mine infancy, this is enough of heaven to come down  to earth. [5]    But, as one grows into the manhood or womanhood  of Christianity, one finds so much lacking, and so very  much requisite to become wholly Christlike, that one  saith: The Principle of Christianity is infinite: it is  indeed God; and this infinite Principle hath infinite [10]  claims on man, and these claims are divine, not human;  and man's ability to meet them is from God; for, being  His likeness and image, man must reflect the full  dominion of Spirit--even its supremacy over sin, sick-  ness, and death. [15]    Here, then, is the awakening from the dream of life  in matter, to the great fact that _God is the only Life_;  that, therefore, we must entertain a higher sense of both  God and man. We must learn that God is infinitely  more than a person, or finite form, can contain; that [20]  God is a divine _Whole_, and _All_, an all-pervading in-  telligence and Love, a divine, infinite Principle; and  that Christianity is a divine Science. This newly  awakened consciousness is wholly spiritual; it emanates  from Soul instead of body, and is the new birth begun [25]  in Christian Science.    Now, dear reader, pause for a moment with me, earn-  estly to contemplate this new-born spiritual altitude; for  this statement demands demonstration.    Here you stand face to face with the laws of infinite [30]  Spirit, and behold for the first time the irresistible con-  flict between the flesh and Spirit. You stand before the    [Page 17.]    awful detonations of Sinai. You hear and record the [1]  thunderings of the spiritual law of Life, as opposed to  the material law of death; the spiritual law of Love, as  opposed to the material sense of love; the law of om-  nipotent harmony and good, as opposed to any supposi- [5]  titious law of sin, sickness, or death. And, before the  flames have died away on this mount of revelation, like  the patriarch of old, you take off your shoes--lay aside  your material appendages, human opinions and doc-  trines, give up your more material religion with its rites [10]  and ceremonies, put off your _materia medica_ and hygiene  as worse than useless--to sit at the feet of Jesus. Then,  you meekly bow before the Christ, the spiritual idea  that our great Master gave of the power of God to heal  and to save. Then it is that you behold for the first [15]  time the divine Principle that redeems man from under  the curse of materialism,--sin, disease, and death.  This spiritual birth opens to the enraptured understand-  ing a much higher and holier conception of the supremacy  of Spirit, and of man as His likeness, whereby man reflects [20]  the divine power to heal the sick.    A material or human birth is the appearing of a mor-  tal, not the immortal man. This birth is more or less  prolonged and painful, according to the timely or un-  timely circumstances, the normal or abnormal material [25]  conditions attending it.    With the spiritual birth, man's primitive, sinless,  spiritual existence dawns on human thought,--through  the travail of mortal mind, hope deferred, the perishing  pleasure and accumulating pains of sense,--by which [30]  one loses himself as matter, and gains a truer sense of  Spirit and spiritual man.    [Page 18.]    The purification or baptismals that come from Spirit, [1]  develop, step by step, the original likeness of perfect man,  and efface the mark of the beast. \"Whom the Lord  loveth He chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom  He receiveth;\" therefore rejoice in tribulation, and wel- [5]  come these spiritual signs of the new birth under the law  and gospel of Christ, Truth.    The prominent laws which forward birth in the divine  order of Science, are these: \"Thou shalt have no other  gods before me;\" \"Love thy neighbor as thyself,\" [10]  These commands of infinite wisdom, translated into  the new tongue, their spiritual"]]]
