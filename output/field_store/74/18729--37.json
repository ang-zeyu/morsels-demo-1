[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4011"],[0,"Epicoene; Or, The Silent Woman (#4)"],[1,"  a demand for three issues in one year.  But this was not due  entirely to the merits of the play.  In its earliest version a  passage which an irritable courtier conceived to be derogatory to  his nation, the Scots, sent both Chapman and Jonson to jail; but  the matter was soon patched up, for by this time Jonson had  influence at court.    With the accession of King James, Jonson began his long and  successful career as a writer of masques.  He wrote more masques  than all his competitors together, and they are of an extraordinary  variety and poetic excellence.  Jonson did not invent the masque;  for such premeditated devices to set and frame, so to speak, a  court ball had been known and practised in varying degrees of  elaboration long before his time.  But Jonson gave dramatic value  to the masque, especially in his invention of the antimasque, a  comedy or farcical element of relief, entrusted to professional  players or dancers.  He enhanced, as well, the beauty and dignity  of those portions of the masque in which noble lords and ladies  took their parts to create, by their gorgeous costumes and artistic  grouping and evolutions, a sumptuous show.  On the mechanical and  scenic side Jonson had an inventive and ingenious partner in Inigo  Jones, the royal architect, who more than any one man raised the  standard of stage representation in the England of his day.  Jonson  continued active in the service of the court in the writing of  masques and other entertainments far into the reign of King  Charles; but, towards the end, a quarrel with Jones embittered his  life, and the two testy old men appear to have become not only a  constant irritation to each other, but intolerable bores at court.  In \"Hymenaei,\" \"The Masque of Queens,\" \"Love Freed from Ignorance,\"  \"Lovers made Men,\" \"Pleasure Reconciled to Virtue,\" and many more  will be found Jonson's aptitude, his taste, his poetry and  inventiveness in these by-forms of the drama; while in \"The Masque  of Christmas,\" and \"The Gipsies Metamorphosed\" especially, is  discoverable that power of broad comedy which, at court as well as  in the city, was not the least element of Jonson's contemporary  popularity.    But Jonson had by no means given up the popular stage when he  turned to the amusement of King James.  In 1605 \"Volpone\" was  produced, \"The Silent Woman\" in 1609, \"The Alchemist\" in the  following year.  These comedies, with \"Bartholomew Fair,\" 1614,  represent Jonson at his height, and for constructive cleverness,  character successfully conceived in the manner of caricature, wit  and brilliancy of dialogue, they stand alone in English drama.  \"Volpone, or the Fox,\" is, in a sense, a transition play from the  dramatic satires of the war of the theatres to the purer comedy  represented in the plays named above.  Its subject is a struggle of  wit applied to chicanery; for among its dramatis personae, from  the villainous Fox himself, his rascally servant Mosca, Voltore  (the vulture), Corbaccio and Corvino (the big and the little  raven), to Sir Politic Would-be and the rest, there is scarcely a  virtuous character in the play.  Question has been raised as to  whether a story so forbidding can be considered a comedy, for,  although the plot ends in the discomfiture and imprisonment of the  most vicious, it involves no mortal catastrophe.  But Jonson was on  sound historical ground, for \"Volpone\" is conceived far more  logically on the lines of the ancients' theory of comedy than was  ever the romantic drama of Shakespeare, however repulsive we may  find a philosophy of life that facilely divides the world into the  rogues and their dupes, and, identifying brains with roguery and  innocence with folly, admires the former while inconsistently  punishing them.    \"The Silent Woman\" is a gigantic farce of the most ingenious  construction.  The whole comedy hinges on a huge joke, played by a  heartless nephew on his misanthropic uncle, who is induced to take  to himself a wife, young, fair, and warranted silent, but who, in  the end, turns out neither silent nor a woman at all.  In \"The  Alchemist,\" again, we have the utmost cleverness in construction,  the whole fabric building climax on climax, witty, ingenious, and  so plausibly presented that we forget its departures from the  possibilities of life.  In \"The Alchemist\" Jonson represented, none  the less to the life, certain sharpers of the metropolis, revelling  in their shrewdness and rascality and in the variety of the  stupidity and wickedness of their victims.  We may object to the  fact that the only person in the play possessed of a scruple of  honesty is discomfited, and that the greatest scoundrel of all is  approved in the end and rewarded.  The comedy is so admirably  written and contrived, the personages stand out with such lifelike  distinctness in their several kinds, and the whole is animated with  such verve and resourcefulness that \"The Alchemist\" is a new marvel  every time it is read.  Lastly of this group comes the tremendous  comedy, \"Bartholomew Fair,\" less clear cut, less definite, and less  structurally worthy of praise than its three predecessors, but full  of the keenest and cleverest of satire and inventive to a degree  beyond any English comedy save some other of Jonson's own.  It is  in \"Bartholomew Fair\" that we are presented to the immortal  caricature of the Puritan, Zeal-in-the-Land Busy, and the  Littlewits that group about him, and it is in this extraordinary  comedy that the humour of Jonson, always open to this danger,  loosens into the Rabelaisian mode that so delighted King James in  \"The Gipsies Metamorphosed.\"  Another comedy of less merit is \"The  Devil is an Ass,\" acted in 1616.  It was the failure of this play  that caused Jonson to give over writing for the public stage for a  period of nearly ten years.    \"Volpone\" was laid as to scene in Venice.  Whether because of the  success of \"Eastward Hoe\" or for other reasons, the other three  comedies declare in the words of the prologue to \"The Alchemist\":    \"Our scene is London, 'cause we would make known  No country's mirth is better than our own.\"    Indeed Jonson went further when he came to revise his plays for  collected publication in his folio of 1616, he transferred the  scene of \"Every Man in His Humour\" from Florence to London also,  converting Signior Lorenzo di Pazzi to Old Kno'well, Prospero to  Master Welborn, and Hesperida to Dame Kitely \"dwelling i' the Old  Jewry.\"    In his comedies of London life, despite his trend towards  caricature, Jonson has shown himself a genuine realist, drawing  from the life about him with an experience and insight rare in any  generation.  A happy comparison has been suggested between Ben  Jonson and Charles Dickens.  Both were men of the people, lowly  born and hardly bred.  Each knew the London of his time as few men  knew it; and each represented it intimately and in elaborate  detail.  Both men were at heart moralists, seeking the truth by the  exaggerated methods of humour and caricature; perverse, even  wrong-headed at times, but possessed of a true pathos and largeness  of heart, and when all has been said -- though the Elizabethan ran  to satire, the Victorian to sentimentality -- leaving the world  better for the art that they practised in it.    In 1616, the year of the death of Shakespeare, Jonson collected his  plays, his poetry, and his masques for publication in a collective  edition.  This was an unusual thing at the time and had been  attempted by no dramatist before Jonson.  This volume published, in  a carefully revised text, all the plays thus far mentioned,  excepting \"The Case is Altered,\" which Jonson did not acknowledge,  \"Bartholomew Fair,\" and \"The Devil is an Ass,\" which was written  too late.  It included likewise a book of some hundred and thirty  odd \"Epigrams,\" in which form of brief and pungent writing Jonson  was an acknowledged master; \"The Forest,\" a smaller collection of  lyric and occasional verse and some ten \"Masques\" and  \"Entertainments.\"  In this same year Jonson was made poet laureate  with a pension of one hundred marks a year.  This, with his fees  and returns from several noblemen, and the small earnings of his  plays must have formed the bulk of his income.  The poet appears to  have done certain literary hack-work for others, as, for example,  parts of the Punic Wars contributed to Raleigh's \"History of the  World.\"  We know from a story, little to the credit of either, that  Jonson accompanied Raleigh's son abroad in the capacity of a tutor.  In 1618 Jonson was granted the reversion of the office of Master of  the Revels, a post for which he was peculiarly fitted; but he did  not live to enjoy its perquisites.  Jonson was honoured with  degrees by both universities, though when and under what  circumstances is not known.  It has been said that he narrowly  escaped the honour of knighthood, which the satirists of the day  averred King James was wont to lavish with an indiscriminate hand.  Worse men were made knights in his day than worthy Ben Jonson.    From 1616 to the close of the reign of King James, Jonson produced  nothing for the stage.  But he \"prosecuted\" what he calls \"his  wonted studies\" with such assiduity that he became in reality, as  by report, one of the most learned men of his time.  Jonson's  theory of authorship involved a wide acquaintance with books and  \"an ability,\" as he put it, \"to convert the substance or riches of  another poet to his own use.\"  Accordingly Jonson read not only the  Greek and Latin classics down to the lesser writers, but he  acquainted himself especially with the Latin writings of his  learned contemporaries, their prose as well as their poetry, their  antiquities and curious lore as well as their more solid learning.  Though a poor man, Jonson was an indefatigable collector of books.  He told Drummond that \"the Earl of Pembroke sent him 20 pounds every  first day of the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4028"],[0,"The Autobiography of Benvenuto Cellini (#4)"],[1," the music too.    Note 1. Baccio Bandinello, the sculptor, and a great rival of Cellinis,  as will appear in the ensuing pages, was born in 1487, and received the  honour of knighthood from Clement VII and Charles V. Posterity has  confirmed Cellinis opinion of Bandinello as an artist; for his works  are coarse, pretentious, and incapable of giving pleasure to any person  of refined intelligence.    VIII    AT that time I had a brother, younger by two years, a youth of extreme  boldness and fierce temper. He afterwards became one of the great  soldiers in the school of that marvellous general Giovannino de Medici,  father of Duke Cosimo. [1] The boy was about fourteen, and I two years  older. One Sunday evening, just before nightfall, he happened to find  himself between the gate San Gallo and the Porta a Pinti; in this  quarter he came to duel with a young fellow of twenty or thereabouts.  They both had swords; and my brother dealt so valiantly that, after  having badly wounded him, he was upon the point of following up his  advantage. There was a great crowd of people present, among whom were  many of the adversarys kinsfolk. Seeing that the thing was going ill  for their own man, they put hand to their slings, a stone from one of  which hit my poor brother in the head. He fell to the ground at once in  a dead faint. It so chanced that I had been upon the spot alone, and  without arms; and I had done my best to get my brother out of the fray  by calling to him: Make off; you have done enough. Meanwhile, as luck  would have it, he fell, as I have said, half dead to earth. I ran up at  once, seized his sword, and stood in front of him, bearing the brunt of  several rapiers and a shower of stones. I never left his side until some  brave soldiers came from the gate San Gallo and rescued me from the  raging crowd; they marvelled much, the while, to find such valour in so  young a boy.    Then I carried my brother home for dead, and it was only with great  difficulty that he came to himself again. When he was cured, the Eight,  who had already condemned out adversaries and banished them for a term  of years, sent us also into exile for six months at a distance of ten  miles from Florence. [2] I said to my brother: Come along with me; and  so we took leave of our poor father; and instead of giving us money, for  he had none, he bestowed on us his blessing. I went to Siena, wishing to  look up a certain worthy man called Maestro Francesco Castoro. On  another occasion, when I had run away from my father, I went to this  good man, and stayed some time with him, working at the goldsmiths  trade until my father sent for me back. Francesco, when I reached him,  recognised me at once, and gave me work to do While thus occupied, he  placed a house at my disposal for the whole time of my sojourn in Siena.  Into this I moved, together with my brother, and applied myself to  labour for the space of several months. My brother had acquired the  rudiments of Latin, but was still so young that he could not yet relish  the taste of virtuous employment, but passed his time in dissipation,    Note 1. Cellini refers to the famous Giovanni delle Bande Nere, who was  killed in an engagement in Lombardy in November 1526, by the Imperialist  troops marching to the sack of Rome. His son Cosimo, after the murder of  Duke Alessandro, established the second Medicean dynasty in Florence.    Note 2. The Eight, or Gli Otto, were a magistracy in Florence with  cognizance of matters affecting the internal peace of the city.    IX    THE CARDINAL DE MEDICI, who afterwards became Pope Clement VII., had us  recalled to Florence at the entreaty of my father. [1] A certain pupil  of my fathers, moved by his own bad nature, suggested to the Cardinal  that he ought to send me to Bologna, in order to learn to play well from  a great master there. The name of this master was Antonio, and he was in  truth a worthy man in the musicians art. The Cardinal said to my father  that, if he sent me there he would give me letters of recommendation and  support. My father, dying with joy at such an opportunity, sent me off;  and I being eager to see the world, went with good grace.    When I reached Bologna, I put myself under a certain Maestro Ercole del  Piffero, and began to earn something by my trade. In the meantime I used  to go every day to take my music lesson, and in a few weeks made  considerable progress in that accursed art. However I made still greater  in my trade of goldsmith; for the Cardinal having given me no  assistance, I went to live with a Bolognese illuminator who was called  Scipione Cavalletti (his house was in the street of our Lady del  Baraccan); and while there I devoted myself to drawing and working for  one Graziadio, a Jew, with whom I earned considerably.    At the end of six months I returned to Florence, where that fellow  Pierino, who had been my fathers pupil, was greatly mortified by my  return. To please my father, I went to his house and played the cornet  and the flute with one of his brothers, who was named Girolamo, several  years younger than the said Piero, a very worthy young man, and quite  the contrary of his brother. On one of those days my father came to  Pieros house to hear us play, and in ecstasy at my performance  exclaimed: I shall yet make you a marvellous musician against the will  of all or any one who may desire to prevent me. To this Piero answered,  and spoke the truth: Your Benvenuto will get much more honour and  profit if he devotes himself to the goldsmiths trade than to this  piping. These words made my father angry, seeing that I too had the  same opinion as Piero, that he flew into a rage and cried out at him:  Well did I know that it was you, you who put obstacles in the way of my  cherished wish; you are the man who had me ousted from my place at the  palace, paying me back with that black ingratitude which is the usual  recompense of great benefits. I got you promoted, and you have got me  cashiered; I taught you to play with all the little art you have, and  you are preventing my son from obeying me; but bear in mind these words  of prophecy: not years or months, I say, but only a few weeks will pass  before this dirty ingratitude of yours shall plunge you into ruin. To  these words answered Pierino and said: Maestro Giovanni, the majority  of men, when they grow old, go mad at the same time; and this has  happened to you. I am not astonished at it, because most liberally have  you squandered all your property, without reflecting that your children  had need of it. I mind to do just the opposite, and to leave my children  so much that they shall be able to succour yours. To this my father  answered: No bad tree ever bore good fruit; quite the contrary; and I  tell you further that you are bad, and that your children will be mad  and paupers, and will cringe for alms to my virtuous and wealthy sons.  Thereupon we left the house, muttering words of anger on both sides. I  had taken my fathers part; and when we stepped into the street  together, I told him I was quite ready to take vengeance for the insults  heaped on him by that scoundrel, provided he permit me to give myself up  to the art of design. He answered: My dear son, I too in my time was a  good draughtsman; but for recreation, after such stupendous labours, and  for the love of me who am your father, who begat you and brought you up  and implanted so many honourable talents in you, for the sake of  recreation, I say, will not you promise sometimes to take in hand your  flute and that seductive cornet, and to play upon them to your hearts  content, inviting the delight of music? I promised I would do so, and  very willingly for his loves sake. Then my good father said that such  excellent parts as I possessed would be the greatest vengeance I could  take for the insults of his enemies.    Not a whole month had been completed after this scene before the man  Pierino happened to be building a vault in a house of his, which he had  in the Via dello Studio; and being one day in a ground-floor room above  the vault which he was making, together with much company around him, he  fell to talking about his old master, my father. While repeating the  words which he had said to him concerning his ruin, no sooner had they  escaped his lips than the floor where he was standing (either because  the vault had been badly built, or rather through the sheer mightiness  of God, who does not always pay on Saturday) suddenly gave way. Some of  the stones and bricks of the vault, which fell with him, broke both his  legs. The friends who were with him, remaining on the border of the  broken vault took no harm, but were astounded and full of wonder,  especially because of the prophecy which he had just contemptuously  repeated to them. When my father heard of this, he took his sword, and  went to see the man. There, in the presence of his father, who was  called Niccolaio da Volterra, a trumpeter of the Signory, he said, O  Piero, my dear pupil, I am sorely grieved at your mischance; but if you  remember it was only a short time ago that I warned you of it; and as  much as I then said will come to happen between your children and mine.  Shortly afterwards, the ungrateful Piero died of that illness. He left a  wife of bad character and one son, who after the lapse of some years  came to me to beg for alms in Rome. I gave him something, as well  because it is my nature to be charitable, as also because I recalled  with tears the happy state which Pierino held when my father spake those  words of prophecy, namely, that Pierinos children should live to crave  succour from his own virtuous sons. Of this perhaps enough is now said;  but let none ever laugh at the prognostications of any worthy man whom  he has wrongfully insulted; because it is not he who speaks, nay, but  the very voice of God through him.
