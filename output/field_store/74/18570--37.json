They were the less disturbed because they lived under  a special <I>regime.</I>  Being neither French nor Christian, they  were therefore not citizens; they formed a state within the  state, or rather a colony within the state, and, being neither  nobles nor serfs, they did not have to render military service.  They administered their internal affairs, and in general were not  amenable to civil or ecclesiastical legislation.  For the  solution of their legal difficulties they applied to the  rabbinical tribunals.  In all other respects they were dependent  upon the lord of the lands upon which they established  themselves, provided they were not under the <I>tutelle et  mainbournie</I> of the king.  In either case they had to pay taxes  and constitute themselves a constantly flowing source of revenues  for their protectors.    The Jews lived on a basis of good understanding with their  neighbors, and came into frequent intercourse with them.  Even  the clergy maintained relations with Jewish scholars.  It was the  incessant efforts of the higher ecclesiastics and of the papacy  that little by little created animosity against the Jews, which  at the epoch of Rashi was still not very apparent.  The  collections of canonical law by force of tradition renewed the  humiliating measures prescribed by the last Roman emperors.    The Jews throughout France spoke French; and they either had  French names or gave their Hebrew names a French form.  In the  rabbinical writings cities are designated by their real names, or  by Hebrew names more or less ingeniously adapted from the Latin  or Romance.  With the secularization of their names, the Jews  adopted, at least partially, the customs and, naturally, also the  superstitions of their countrymen.  The valuable researches of  Gudemann and Israel Levi show how much the folklore of the two  races have in common.  Moreover, when two peoples come in contact,  no matter how great the differences distinguishing them, they are  bound to exert mutual influence upon each other.  No impervious  partitions exist in sociology.    It would thus be an anachronism to represent the Jews of the  eleventh century as pale and shabby, ever bearing the look of  hunted animals, shamefaced, depressed by clerical hate, royal  greed, and the brutality of the masses.  In the Jewries of France  at this time there was nothing sad or sombre, [somber sic] no  strait-laced orthodoxy, no jargon, no disgraceful costume, none  of that gloomy isolation betokening distrust, scorn, and hate.    The practical activity of the Jews, their business interests, and  their consequent wealth did not stifle intellectual ideals.  On  the contrary, thanks to the security assured them, they could  devote themselves to study.  Their rich literature proves they  could occupy themselves at the same time with mental and material  pursuits.  \"For a people to produce scholars, it is necessary  that it be composed of something other than hard-hearted usurers  and sordid business men.  The literary output is a thorough test  of social conditions.\"[5]  Moreover, the intellectual status of a  people always bears relation to its material and economic  condition, and so, where the Jews enjoyed most liberty and  happiness, their literature has been richest and most brilliant.    From an intellectual point of view the Jews resembled the people  among whom they lived.  Like them, they were pious, even extremely  devout; and they counted few unbelievers among their number.  Sometimes it happened that a religious person failed to obey  precepts, but no one contested the foundations of belief.  In the  matter of religion, it is true, outward observance was guarded  above everything else.  The Jews, settled as they were on foreign  soil, came to attach themselves to ceremonials as the surest  guarantees of their faith.  Naturally superstitions prevailed at  an epoch marked by a total lack of scientific spirit.  People  believed in the existence of men without shadows, in evil demons,  and so on.  The Jews, however, were less inclined to such  conceptions than the Christians, who in every district had places  of pilgrimage at which they adored spurious bones and relics.    It would be altogether unjust not to recognize the ethical  results of the constant practice of the law, which circumscribed  the entire life of the Jew.  Talmudic legislation must not be  regarded, as it sometimes is, as an oppressive yoke, an  insufferable fetter.  Its exactions do not make it tyrannical,  because it is loyally and freely accepted, accepted even with  pleasure.  The whole life of the Jew is taken into consideration  beforehand, its boundaries are marked, its actions controlled.  But this submission entails no self-denial; it is voluntary and  the reason is provided with sufficient motives.  Indeed, it is  remarkable what freedom and breadth thought was able to maintain  in the very bosom of orthodoxy.       \"The observance of the Law and, consequently, the study of     the Law formed the basis of this religion.  With the fall of     the Temple the one place disappeared in which the Divine     cult could legitimately be performed; as a result the Jews     turned for the expression of their religious sentiment with     all the more ardor toward the Law, now become the real     sanctuary of Judaism torn from its native soil, the     safeguard of the wandering race, the one heritage of a     glorious and precious past.  The recitation and study of the     Law took the place of religious ceremonies-hence the name     \"school\" (<I>Schul</I>) for houses of worship in France and     in Germany.  The endeavor was made to give the Law definite     form, to develop it, not only in its provisions remaining     in practical use, such as the civil and penal code,     regulations in regard to the festivals, and private     observances, but also in its provisions relating to the     Temple cult which had historical interest only.  This     occupation, pursued with warmth and depth of feeling for a     number of centuries, appealed at once to the intellect and     the heart.  It may be said that the entire Jewish race     shared in the work, the scholar being removed from the     general mass only in degree, not in kind.\"[6]    The high level of general instruction among the Jews was all the  more remarkable since only a small number of literary works were  known.  Though copies were made of those which enjoyed the  greatest reputation, the number of manuscripts was limited.  Nevertheless, soon after their appearance, important productions  in one country came into the hands of scholars of other  countries.  Just as Christendom by force of its spiritual bond  formed a single realm, so two strong chains bound together Jews  of widely separated regions: these were their religion and their  language.  Communication was difficult, roads were few in number  and dangerous; yet, countervailing distance and danger was  devotion to religion and to learning.    But religion and learning were one and the same thing.  As was the  case in Christianity, and for the same reasons, religion filled  the whole of life and engrossed all branches of knowledge.  There  was no such thing as secular science; religion placed its stamp  on everything, and turned the currents of thought into its own  channels.  One must not hope therefore to find, among the Jews of  Northern France, those literary species which blossomed and  flourished in Spain; philosophy did not exist among them, and  poetry was confined to a few dry liturgic poems.  Their  intellectual activity was concentrated in the study of the Bible  and the Talmud; but in this domain they acquired all the greater  depth and penetration.  Less varied as were the objects of their  pursuits, they excelled in what they undertook, and inferior  though they were in the fields of philosophy and poetry, they  were superior in Biblical exegesis, and still more so, possibly,  in Talmudic jurisprudence.                                   II    The history of the beginnings of rabbinical learning in France is  wrapped in obscurity.  Tradition has it that Charlemagne caused  the scholar Kalonymos to come from Lucca to Mayence.  With his  sons he is said to have opened a school there, which became the  centre [center sic] of Talmudic studies in Lorraine.  Legends,  however slight their semblance to truth, are never purely  fictitious in character; they contain an element of truth, or, at  least, symbolize the truth; and this tradition, which cannot be  accepted in the shape in which it has been handed down, seeing  that Kalonymos lived in the tenth century, is nevertheless a  fairly exact representation of the continuity of the intellectual  movement.  If the fact is not established that Charlemagne  accomplished for the Jews what he did for the Christians, that  is, revived their schools and promoted their prosperity, it seems  more certain that rabbinical learning penetrated into the  northwest of Europe through the intermediation of Italy, which  bridged the gap between the Orient and the Rhine lands.    As is well known, Christian Italy during the early middle ages,  despite the successive invasions of the barbarians, remained the  centre [center sic] of civilization and the store-house of  Occidental learning.  It is in Italy, without doubt, that the  Romanesque style of architecture had its origin, and in Italy  that the study of the Roman law was vigorously resumed.  It is to  Italy also that Charlemagne turned when he sought for scholars to  place at the head of his schools.  Moreover, it was on Italian  soil, in the fifteenth century, that the magnificent blossom  meriting its name, the Renaissance, was destined to open and  unfold its literary and artistic beauties.    Italy owes its glorious part in the world's history "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31664"],[0,"Once a Greech (#4)"],[1," got, Iversen couldn't help feeling guilty as he ate steak while the  other officers consumed fish, vegetables and eggs in an aura of  unbearable virtue.    \"But if the soul transmigrates and not the body,\" he argued, \"what harm  is there in consuming the vacated receptacle?\"    \"For all you know,\" the first officer said, averting his eyes from  Iversen's plate with a little--wholly gratuitous, to the captain's  mind--shudder, \"that cow might have housed the psyche of your  grandmother.\"    \"Well, then, by indirectly participating in that animal's slaughter, I  have released my grandmother from her physical bondage to advance to the  next plane. That is, if she was a good cow.\"    \"You just don't understand,\" Harkaway said. \"Not that you could be  expected to.\"    \"He's a clod,\" the radio operator agreed. \"Forgive me, sir,\" he  apologized as Iversen turned to glare incredulously at him, \"but,  according to _mpoola_, candor is a Step Upward.\"    \"Onward and Upward,\" Harkaway commented, and Iversen was almost sure  that, had he not been there, the men would have bowed their heads in  contemplation, if not actual prayer.           *       *       *       *       *    As time went on, the greech thrived and grew remarkably stout on the  Earth viands, which it consumed in almost improbable quantities. Then,  one day, it disappeared and its happy squeal was heard no longer.    There was much mourning aboard the _Herringbone_--for, with its lovable  personality and innocently engaging ways, the little fellow had won its  way into the hearts of all the spacemen--until the first officer  discovered a substantial pink cocoon resting on the ship's control board  and rushed to the intercom to spread the glad tidings. That was a breach  of regulations, of course, but Iversen knew when not to crowd his  fragile authority.    \"I should have known there was some material basis for the spiritual  doctrine of _mpoola_,\" Harkaway declared with tears in his eyes as he  regarded the dormant form of his little pet. \"Was it not the  transformation of the caterpillar into the butterfly that first showed  us on Earth how the soul might emerge winged and beautiful from its vile  house of clay? Gentlemen,\" he said, in a voice choked with emotion, \"our  little greech is about to become a zkoort. Praised be the Impersonal  Being who has allowed such a miracle to take place before our very eyes.  _J'goona lo mpoona_.\"    \"Amen,\" said the first officer reverently.    All those in the control room bowed their heads except Iversen. And even  he didn't quite have the nerve to tell them that the cocoon was pushing  the _Herringbone_ two points off course.           *       *       *       *       *    \"Take that thing away before I lose my temper and clobber it,\" Iversen  said impatiently as the zkoort dived low to buzz him, then whizzed just  out of its reach on its huge, brilliant wings, giggling raucously.    [Illustration]    \"He was just having his bit of fun,\" the first officer said with  reproach. \"Have you no tolerance, Captain, no appreciation of the joys  of golden youth?\"    \"A spaceship is no place for a butterfly,\" Iversen said, \"especially a  four-foot butterfly.\"    \"How can you say that?\" Harkaway retorted. \"The _Herringbone_ is the  only spaceship that ever had one, to my knowledge. And I think I can  safely say our lives are all a bit brighter and better and _m'poo'p_  for having a zkoort among us. Thanks be to the Divine Nonentity for--\"    \"Poor little butterfly,\" Dr. Smullyan declared sonorously, \"living out  his brief life span so far from the fresh air, the sunshine, the pretty  flowers--\"    \"Oh, I don't know that it's as bad as all that,\" the first officer said.  \"He hangs around hydroponics a lot and he gets a daily ration of  vitamins.\" Then he paled. \"But that's right--a butterfly does live only  a day, doesn't it?\"    \"It's different with a zkoort,\" Harkaway maintained stoutly, though he  also, Iversen noted, lost his ruddy color. \"After all, he isn't really a  butterfly, merely an analogous life-form.\"    \"My, my! In four weeks, you've mastered their entomology as well as  their theology and language,\" Iversen jeered. \"Is there no end to your  accomplishments, Lieutenant?\"    Harkaway's color came back twofold. \"He's already been around half a  _thubb_,\" he pointed out. \"Over two weeks.\"    \"Well, the thing _is_ bigger than a Terrestrial butterfly,\" Iversen  conceded, \"so you have to make some allowances for size. On the other  hand--\"    Laughing madly, the zkoort swooped down on him. Iversen beat it away  with a snarl.    \"Playful little fellow, isn't he?\" the first officer said, with  thoroughly annoying fondness.    \"He likes you, Skipper,\" Harkaway explained. \"_Urg'h n gurg'h_--or, to  give it the crude Terran equivalent, living is loving. He can tell that  beneath that grizzled and seemingly harsh exterior of yours, Captain--\"    But, with a scream of rage, Iversen had locked himself into his cabin.  Outside, he could hear the zkoort beating its wings against the door and  wailing disappointedly.           *       *       *       *       *    Some days later, a pair of rapidly dulling wings were found on the floor  of the hydroponics chamber. But of the zkoort's little body, there was  no sign. An air of gloom and despondency hung over the _Herringbone_ and  even Iversen felt a pang, though he would never admit it without  brainwashing.    During the next week, the men, seeking to forget their loss, plunged  themselves into _mpoola_ with real fanaticism. Harkaway took to wearing  some sort of ecclesiastical robes which he whipped up out of the  recreation room curtains. Iversen had neither the heart nor the courage  to stop him, though this, too, was against regulations. Everyone except  Iversen gave up eating fish and eggs in addition to meat.    Then, suddenly, one day a roly-poly blue animal appeared at the officers  mess, claiming everyone as an old friend with loud squeals of joy. This  time, Iversen was the only one who was glad to see him--really glad.    \"Aren't you happy to see your little friend again, Harkaway?\" he asked,  scratching the delighted animal between the ears.    \"Why, sure,\" Harkaway said, putting his fork down and leaving his  vegetable _macedoine_ virtually untasted. \"Sure. I'm very happy--\" his  voice broke--\"very happy.\"    \"Of course, it does kind of knock your theory of the transmigration of  souls into a cocked hat,\" the captain grinned. \"Because, in order for  the soul to transmigrate, the previous body's got to be dead, and I'm  afraid our little pal here was alive all the time.\"    \"Looks it, doesn't it?\" muttered Harkaway.    \"I rather think,\" Iversen went on, tickling the creature under the chin  until it squealed happily, \"that you didn't _quite_ get the nuances of  the language, did you, Harkaway? Because I gather now that the whole  difficulty was a semantic one. The Flimbotzik were explaining the  zoology of the native life-forms to you and you misunderstood it as  their theology.\"    \"Looks it, doesn't it?\" Harkaway repeated glumly. \"It certainly looks  it.\"    \"Cheer up,\" Iversen said, reaching over to slap the young man on the  back--a bit to his own amazement. \"No real harm done. What if the  Flimbotzik are less primitive than you fancied? It makes our discovery  the more worthwhile, doesn't it?\"    At this point, the radio operator almost sobbingly asked to be excused  from the table. Following his departure, there was a long silence. It  was hard, Iversen realized in a burst of uncharacteristic tolerance, to  have one's belief, even so newly born a credo, annihilated with such  suddenness.    \"After all, you did run across the Flimbotzik first,\" he told Harkaway  as he spread gooseberry jam on a hard roll for the ravenous ex-zkoort  (now a chu-wugg, he had been told). \"That's the main thing, and a  life-form that passes through two such striking metamorphoses is not  unfraught with interest. You shall receive full credit, my boy, and your  little mistake doesn't mean a thing except--\"    \"Doom,\" said Dr. Smullyan, sopping up the last of his gravy with a piece  of bread. \"Doom, doom, doom.\" He stuffed the bread into his mouth.    \"Look, Smullyan,\" Iversen told him jovially, \"you better watch out. If  you keep talking that way, next voyage out we'll sign on a parrot  instead of a medical officer. Cheaper and just as efficient.\"    Only the chu-wugg joined in his laughter.    \"Ever since I can remember,\" the first officer said, looking gloomily at  the doctor, \"he's never been wrong. Maybe _he_ has powers beyond our  comprehension. Perhaps we sought at the end of the Galaxy what was in  our own back yard all the time.\"    \"Who was seeking what?\" Iversen asked as all the officers looked at  Smullyan with respectful awe. \"I demand an answer!\"    But the only one who spoke was the doctor. \"Only Man is vile,\" he said,  as if to himself, and fell asleep with his head on the table.    \"Make a cult out of Smullyan,\" Iversen warned the others, \"and I'll  scuttle the ship!\"    Later on, the first officer got the captain alone. \"Look here, sir,\" he  began tensely, \"have you read Harkaway's book about _mpoola_?\"    \"I read part of the first chapter,\" Iversen told him, \"and that was  enough. Maybe to Harkaway it's eschatology, but to me it's just plain  scatology!\"    \"But--\"    \"Why in Zubeneschamali,\" Iversen said patiently, \"should I waste my time  reading a book devoted to a theory which has already been proved  erroneous? Answer me that!\"    \"I think you should have a look at the whole thing,\" the first officer  persisted.    \"Baham!\" Iversen replied, but amiably enough, for he was in rare good  humor these days. And he needed good humor to tolerate the way his  officers and men were behaving. All right, they had made idiots of  themselves; that was understandable, expected, familiar. But it wasn't  the chu-wugg's fault. Iversen had never seen such a bunch of soreheads."]]]
