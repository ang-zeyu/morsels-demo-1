The bull-fighters talked to him as to a father.  He spoke as a familiar to all of them, and no more was needed than to  get a telegram from a distant part of the Peninsula, for the good doctor  to take the train on the instant to go to treat the horn-wound received  by one of his _boys_ with no other hope of recompense than whatever they  might freely wish to give him.    On seeing Gallardo after a long absence he embraced him, pressing his  flabby abdomen against the other's body which seemed made of bronze.  Bravo! He thought the _espada_ looking better than ever.    \"And how is the Republic getting on, doctor? When is it going to  happen?\" asked Gallardo with an Andalusian drawl. \"Nacional says it's  going to come off soon; that it will be here one of these days.\"    \"And what does that matter to thee, rogue? Let poor Nacional alone. The  best thing for him to do is to stick in his _banderillas_ better. As for  thee, the only thing that should interest thee is to keep on killing  bulls, like the very God himself. A fine afternoon this is going to be.  They tell me that the bulls--\"    But here the young man who had seen the sorting of the animals and  wished to talk about it, interrupted the doctor to tell of a dark bull  that had caught his eye, and from which he expected the greatest  prowess. The two men, who had remained silent after bowing to one  another, were face to face, and Gallardo thought an introduction  necessary. But what was the name of that friend whom he addressed as  _thou_? He scratched his head, knitting his eyebrows with an effort at  recollection, but his indecision was short.    \"Listen! What is thy name? Pardon, thou seest--with meeting so many  people--\"    The young man concealed beneath a smile of approbation his  disenchantment at seeing himself forgotten by the master, and gave his  name. Gallardo on hearing it felt the past come back suddenly to his  memory, and made reparation for his forgetfulness by adding after the  name, \"wealthy miner from Bilbao.\" Then he presented the \"famous Doctor  Ruiz\" and both men, as if they had known one another all their lives,  united by the enthusiasm of a common devotion, began to gossip about the  bulls of the afternoon.    \"Sit down.\" Gallardo motioned to a sofa at the end of the room. \"You'll  not be in the way there. Talk and don't notice me. I am going to dress.  I think that, as we're all men--\"    And he took off his clothes, remaining in his under-garments.    Seated on a chair in the centre of the archway that divided the little  reception room from the sleeping alcove, he gave himself up to the  hands of Garabato, who had opened a bag of Russia-leather and was taking  out of it an almost feminine _necessaire_ for the swordsman's toilet.    In spite of the fact that the latter was carefully shaved he lathered  his face again and passed the razor over his cheeks with the skill of  one daily accustomed to the task. After washing himself Gallardo  returned to his seat. The servant deluged his hair with brilliantine and  other perfumes, combing it in curls over his forehead and temples; then  he undertook the arrangement of the professional emblem, the sacred  _coleta_.    With a certain respect he combed the long lock that crowned the occiput  of the _maestro_, braided it and, postponing the completion of the  operation, fixed it on the top of his head with two hairpins, leaving  its final arrangement until later. Now he must occupy himself with the  feet, and he stripped the athlete of his socks, leaving him dressed only  in an undershirt and drawers of silk mesh.    Gallardo's strong muscles were outlined beneath this clothing in  vigorous protuberances. A hollow in one thigh showed a deep scar where  the flesh had disappeared on account of a horn-stab. Signs of old wounds  were marked by white spots on the brown skin of his arms. His breast,  dark and free from hair, was crossed by two irregular purplish lines,  with a round depression, as if it had served as a mould for a coin. But  his gladiatorial person exhaled an odor of clean brave flesh, mingled  with strong but effeminate perfumes.    Garabato, with an armful of cotton and white bandages, knelt at the  swordsman's feet.    \"Like the ancient gladiators,\" said Dr. Ruiz, interrupting his  conversation with the man from Bilbao; \"thou hast become a Roman, Juan.\"    \"Age, doctor,\" answered Gallardo with a certain melancholy. \"We all have  to grow old. When I used to fight bulls and hunger too, I didn't need  this--and I had feet of iron in doing the cape-work.\"    Garabato introduced little tufts of cotton between his master's toes;  then he covered the soles and upper part with a layer of this soft  material and, putting on the bandages, began to bind them in tight  spirals, as the ancient mummies are enwrapped. To fasten this  arrangement he took the threaded needles he wore on one sleeve and  carefully sewed the ends of the bandages.    Gallardo stamped on the floor with his compressed feet, which seemed  firmer inside their soft swathing. Thus encased they felt strong and  agile. The servant then drew on long stockings which reached half way up  his leg; they were thick and flexible like leggings--the only defence of  the legs under the silk of the fighting dress.    \"Be careful about wrinkles. Look out, Garabato, I don't like to wear  pockets!\"    And he stood up to look at himself in the two panels of the mirror,  stooping to pass his hands over his legs and smooth out the wrinkles.  Over the white stockings Garabato drew on others of rose-colored silk.  Then Gallardo thrust his feet into his low shoes, choosing them from  among several pairs that Garabato had put on a trunk, all with white  soles and perfectly new.    Now the real task of dressing began. The servant handed him his fighting  trousers held by the legs,--tobacco-colored silk with heavy embroideries  of gold on their seams. Gallardo put them on and the thick cords with  gold tassels that closed the knees, congesting the leg with artificial  fulness, hung to his feet.    Gallardo told his servant to tighten them as much as he could, at the  same time swelling up the muscles of his legs. This operation was one of  the most important. A bull-fighter must wear the _machos_ well  tightened. And Garabato, with deft speed, converted the dangling cords  into little bows.    The master put on the fine batiste shirt which the servant offered him,  with gatherings on the bosom, soft and transparent as a feminine  garment. Garabato after buttoning it tied the knot of the long cravat  that fell in a red line, dividing the bosom until it was lost in the  waistband of the trousers.    The most complicated part of the dressing still remained, the _faja_, a  band of silk nearly five yards long, that seemed to fill the whole  apartment, Garabato managing it with the skill of long practice.    The swordsman walked to the other extreme of the room where his friends  were and put one of the ends around his waist.    \"Come, be very careful!\" he said to his servant. \"Make the most of thy  little skill.\"    Slowly turning on his heels he drew near his servant who held one end of  the belt, thus winding it around his body in regular curves, giving  greater elegance to his waist. Garabato, with rapid movements of his  hands, changed the folds of the band of silk. With some turns the belt  rolled double, with others wide open, and it all adjusted itself to the  bull-fighter's form, smooth as if it were a single piece, without  wrinkles or puffs. Gallardo, scrupulous and fastidious in the  arrangement of his person, stopped his progress in the course of the  rotatory journey to go back two or three times and improve upon the  work.    \"It isn't good,\" he said with ill-humor. \"Damn it all! Be careful  Garabato.\"    After many halts Gallardo reached the end with the entire piece of silk  wound around his waist. The skilful servant had sewed and put pins and  safety pins all over his master's body, converting his clothes into one  single piece. To get out of them the bull-fighter would have to resort  to scissors and to others' hands. He could not divest himself of a  single garment until his return to the hotel, unless the bull should  accomplish it for him in the open plaza and they should finish  undressing him in the hospital.    Gallardo seated himself again and Garabato went about the business of  arranging the queue, taking out the hairpins and adding the _mona_, the  black rosette with streamers which recalled the ancient head-dress of  early bull-fighting times.    The master, as if he wished to put off the moment of final encasement in  the costume, stretched himself, asked Garabato for the cigar that he had  left on the little night-table, and demanded the time, thinking that all  the clocks were fast.    \"It's early yet. The boys haven't come. I don't like to go to the plaza  early. It makes a fellow tired to be there waiting!\"    A servant of the hotel announced that the carriage with the _cuadrilla_  had arrived.    It was time to go. There was no excuse for delaying the moment of  setting forth. He put over his belt the gold-embroidered vest and  outside of this the jacket, a shining garment with enormous embossments,  heavy as armor and resplendent with light as a glowing coal. The silk,  color of tobacco, was only visible on the under side of the arms and in  two triangles on the back. Almost the entire garment disappeared under  the heavy layer of trimmings and gold-embroidered designs forming  flowers with colored stones in their corollas. The shoulder pieces were  heavy masses of gold embroidery from which fell a fringe of the same  metal. The garment was edged with a close fringe that moved at every  step."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33830"],[0,"Fur Farming (#4)"],[1,"north of the Ohio River but offers a  market. St. Louis, Louisville and other southern cities being near the  coon and opossum producing sections does not offer so good a market.  Muskrat are now served as \"marsh rabbit\" in Baltimore and other cities.  The trapper realizing from 5 to 10 cents each.    With the exception of muskrat, fur bearing animals breed only once a  year, unless the first litter are killed or die, when another is  sometimes born and it might be said, such is frequently the case. The  number that the various animals produce at a litter is given in the  chapter dealing with that animal.    It is not all that are successful bee raisers who have gone into that  business, yet how few failures are there among men who began in a small  way, learning more of the business and gradually increasing the number  of hives in their apiary.    One thing is important and that is, get the animals accustomed to their  keeper as soon as possible. The old will be wild for some time but the  young soon become tame. Skunk and coon are easily tamed and even beaver,  otter and mink have become so tame when secured young, that children  have safely handled them.    A man who has been in the \"fur farming\" industry for years, in response  to the inquiry, \"Will the business pay,\" says: \"Yes, it will pay the  right man big dividends on the capital invested.\" The right man is one  who has \"natural aptitude\" for this sort of work, and who is \"cut out\"  for \"fur farming.\" If he has an \"inkling\" for this sort of work, he will  study the nature and requirements of the animals and attend carefully to  their every want.    Fur farming as an industry is only in its infancy, in fact, not begun.  The future looks bright to those who engage in the business in a  business way. To those who expect to make a fortune at the business in a  year or two, we predict failure, but to all who are willing to go at the  industry, building a substantial enclosure, paying the same careful  attention to the feed and care of their fur animals, that they would to  other \"stock,\" to get best results, far more than ordinary profits  should result.          CHAPTER III.    ENCLOSURES.      This is indeed, one of the important things in connection with  \"fur-farming.\" Some of the first experimenters in raising skunk and  other fur animals, dug a trench from 2 to 3 feet deep, putting in rocks  or boards edgewise to keep them from digging out, on top of which they  constructed an upright fence of boards from 4 to 7 feet. On top of this  fence was fastened a wide board to keep the animals from climbing out.    The enclosure should be an acre in extent and 2 to 5 would be better.  The \"ranch\" should be located where the water will drain off quickly, so  that the dens will be dry, making a good place to burrow. The ground  should not be level, or at any rate, should have good drainage. Skunk  and perhaps other animals are liable to disease, if kept in damp and  crowded quarters, such as sore throat or similar diseases, which may  cause death.    [Illustration: Corner of enclosure, showing sheet tin at top and stones  at bottom.]    Galvanized wire, No. 14 or 16, with about one-inch mesh, seems to be the  proper material for fencing. Posts should be of locust, cedar, or some  other long lasting wood. They should be fully 10 feet long and put in  the ground 3 feet or more, depending upon how firm the earth is; they  should be set about 8 feet or not more than ten apart, as your fence  should be about 7 feet above ground. A trench two feet deep is dug, into  which your wire is put. From this it will be seen that you need woven  wire 9 feet high to make your fence 7 feet above ground, as two feet are  under.    After your wire is in place, fill up the trench with dirt, or if there  are flat stones, it would be well to place a layer about a foot wide,  extending inward from the fence or bottom of wire. Should any of the  animals dig downward from the bottom of the wire, striking the stone  they would become discouraged and give up, as the stone would cause them  to dig in the wrong direction to escape. On top of the wire fence, a  sheet of tin roofing about 18 inches wide, should extend around the  enclosure, on the inside, to keep the animals from climbing out, for  skunk as well as coon can easily climb out of your enclosure.    Instead of placing the tin around the top some turn the fence in as  shown in the illustration. If this is done to make the fence 7 feet  high, a 10-1/2 foot meshed wire is required as two feet are under ground  and at least 18 inches should be used for turning in--2 feet would be  best.    [Illustration: Showing Fence with Wire Turned in at Top.]    The \"turning in\" method has some advantages over the tin; one being that  dogs cannot get in so easily, and another is that the fence will stand  up better; the wide strip of tin or sheet-iron catching wind or snow  which helps to sag the wire or cause the fence to lean. The tin or  sheet-iron, however, seems to be the best in preventing any animal's  escape.    The enclosure can be enlarged at any time, but do not make the mistake  of beginning with too small an enclosure, as some have. Also have your  fence about 7 feet high to keep dogs out, as well as to keep the  fur-bearers in. Just how much the enclosure will cost depends upon  several things: The cost of 9 foot, 1 inch mesh No. 16 galvanized wire  is about $1.50 per rod. This price, of course, will vary some, depending  upon where you are located. In some of the smaller cities you perhaps  cannot get the kind you want and will be compelled to send to some of  the larger cities or catalogue houses. Perhaps you can not get wider  than 5 feet. If such is the case buy in two widths--5 feet and 4 feet.  This will give you the desired height.    Posts as already mentioned should be of locust or some other long  lasting wood, as cedar, and should be thoroughly seasoned before putting  in the ground. The posts should be fully 6 inches in diameter. If from  larger locust and split, so much the better, as the older the tree the  longer it will last. The cutting and setting of the posts, putting up of  the fence, can be done by the \"fur-farmer\" in those sections where  locust and cedar grow, so that all the cash outlay necessary in building  the enclosure, will be for galvanized wire, some staples and sheet tin  for the top. Instead of placing the tin around the top, it may be  fastened on the inside of the wire (as shown), about four feet from the  ground.    The corner posts should be two or three times larger than the others;  they should be set more firmly in the ground, five feet being about  right. This will necessitate these posts being two feet longer than the  rest. They should be firmly braced in both ways.    [Illustration: Fence with Sheet Tin Four Feet from Ground.]    The cost of fencing an acre, varies, of course. An acre contains 160  square rods or about 12-1/2 rods each side--equal to 50 rods of fence.  If the wire costs $1.50 a rod, and posts 40 cents each, the cost of  material required to enclose an acre will be $95.00. We are figuring on  two posts to the rod. Add to this staples, gates, etc., and the cost  will perhaps be about $100.00. Of course a much cheaper wire could be  used, poorer posts, etc., so that the cost would be greatly reduced--but  it generally pays to do a thing well.    To enclose a certain amount of ground with the smallest number of rods  of fencing possible, the plat or ground to be enclosed should be in a  square. The additional cost to enclose an acre, say 20 rods long by 8  wide, would be material for 6 additional rods. To fully illustrate, an  acre fenced in a square would be 12-1/2 rods on each side, or 50 rods;  if 20 rods long, the two sides would be 40 rods, and the ends 8 each or  16 rods, making a total of 56 rods.    While the cost of enclosing an oblong piece of ground would be a few  dollars more than if square, this should not stand in the way if the  oblong piece of ground would make a better home for your fur-bearing  animals.    The persons who expect to make \"fur-farming\" a business, can begin in a  small way and same need not interfere with other work to a great extent.  Year after year, as they learn more of the business, they can enlarge,  etc. Trappers, hunters and others who from experience know much of the  animals, will no doubt be the most successful from the start. One party  writes to know if skunk, fox, opossum and mink can be successfully  raised in the same enclosure. If he means allowed to run together, they  can not. If he means the same outside enclosure, with separate  apartments for the various animals, there is no reason why such a place  should not be successful as there will be advantages in such a plan.    First, an enclosure of four acres can be built much cheaper than four  separate enclosures of one acre each. To enclose four one-acre  enclosures would require 200 rods of fencing--50 rods for each. The four  acres in one enclosure would be only about half or 100 rods. A square 25  rods on each side would be almost 4 acres. Should the fur-farmer wish to  subdivide this into four tracts, a fence thru the middle each way would  take 25 rods additional or 50 rods for both ways. This fencing need not  be so high or so secure as the outside one. Should animals manage to get  into another part of the four-acre enclosure, they would still not be at  liberty, altho they might kill or injure some of the other species  before being discovered by the owner.    If possible have a small stream of running water in the enclosure.    [Illustration: Plan for Combined Enclosures.]    Without labor the cost of material will vary from $2.00 to $3.00 per  rod. The greatest variation in expense will be for posts. Those living  where posts can be had, having considerable the advantage.
