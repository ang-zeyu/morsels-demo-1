Knave, with an  instinctive throwback to his wolf forebears of five hundred years  earlier, dived for Lad's forelegs with the hope of breaking one of  them between his foaming jaws.    He missed the hold by a fraction of an inch. The skin alone was  torn. And down over the little white forepaw--one of the forepaws that  Lad was wont to lick for an hour a day to keep them snowy--ran a  trickle of blood.    That miss was a costly error for Knave. For Lad's teeth sought and  found his left shoulder, and sank deep therein. Knave twisted and  wheeled with lightning speed and with all his strength. Yet had not  his gold-hued ruff choked Lad and pressed stranglingly against his  nostrils, all the heavier dog's struggles would not have set him free.    As it was, Lad, gasping for breath enough to fill his lungs, relaxed  his grip ever so slightly. And in that fraction of a second Knave tore  free, leaving a mouthful of hair and skin in his enemy's jaws.    In the same wrench that liberated him--and as the relieved tension  sent Lad stumbling forward--Knave instinctively saw his chance and  took it. Again heredity came to his aid, for he tried a manoeuver  known only to wolves and to collies. Flashing above his stumbling  foe's head, Knave seized Lad from behind, just below the base of the  skull. And holding him thus helpless, he proceeded to grit and grind  his tight-clenched teeth in the slow, relentless motion that must soon  or late eat down to and sever the spinal cord.    Lad, even as he thrashed frantically about, felt there was no  escape. He was well-nigh as powerless against a strong opponent in  this position as is a puppy that is held up by the scruff of the neck.    Without a sound, but still struggling as best he might, he awaited his  fate. No longer was he growling or snarling.    His patient, bloodshot eyes sought wistfully for Lady. And they did  not find her.    For even as they sought her, a novel element entered into the  battle. Lady, hitherto awaiting with true feminine meekness the  outcome of the scrimmage, saw her old flame's terrible plight, under  the grinding jaws. And, proving herself false to all canons of  ancestry--moved by some impulse she did not try to resist--she jumped  forward. Forgetting the pain in her swollen foot, she nipped Knave  sharply in the hind leg. Then, as if abashed by her unfeminine  behavior, she drew back, in shame.    But the work was done.    Through the red war lust Knave dimly realized that he was attacked  from behind--perhaps that his new opponent stood an excellent chance  of gaining upon him such a death-hold as he himself now held.    He loosed his grip and whizzed about, frothing and snapping, to face  the danger. Before Knave had half completed his lightning whirl, Lad  had him by the side of the throat.    It was no death-grip, this. Yet it was not only acutely painful, but  it held its victim quite as powerless as he had just now held  Lad. Bearing down with all his weight and setting his white little  front teeth and his yellowing tusks firmly in their hold, Lad  gradually shoved Knave's head sideways to the ground and held it  there.    The result on Knave's activities was much the same as is obtained by  sitting on the head of a kicking horse that has fallen. Unable to  wrench loose, helpless to counter, in keen agony from the pinching of  the tender throat-skin beneath the masses of ruff, Knave lost his  nerve. And he forthwith justified those yellowish streaks in his  mouth-roof whereof the baggage-man had spoken.    He made the air vibrate with his abject howls of pain and fear. He was  caught. He could not get away. Lad was hurting him horribly. Wherefore  he ki-yi-ed as might any gutter cur whose tail is stepped upon.    Presently, beyond the fight haze, Lad saw a shadow in front of him--a  shadow that resolved itself in the settling dust, as the Master. And  Lad came to himself.    He loosed his hold on Knave's throat, and stood up, groggily. Knave,  still yelping, tucked his tail between his legs and fled for his  life--out of The Place, out of your story.    Slowly, stumblingly, but without a waver of hesitation, Lad went up to  the Master. He was gasping for breath, and he was weak from fearful  exertion and from loss of blood. Up to the Master he went--straight up  to him.    And not until he was a scant two yards away did he see that the Master  held something in his hand--that abominable, mischief-making eagle's  head, which he had just picked up! Probably the dog-whip was in the  other hand. It did not matter much. Lad was ready for this final  degradation. He would not try to dodge it, he the double breaker of  laws.    Then--the Master was kneeling beside him. The kind hand was caressing  the dog's dizzy head, the dear voice--a queer break in it--was saying  remorsefully:    \"Oh Lad! Laddie! I'm so sorry. So sorry! You're--you're more of a man  than I am, old friend. I'll make it up to you, somehow!\"    And now besides the loved hand, there was another touch, even more  precious--a warmly caressing little pink tongue that licked his  bleeding foreleg.    Lady--timidly, adoringly--was trying to stanch her hero's wounds.    \"Lady, I apologize to you too,\" went on the foolish Master. \"I'm  sorry, girl.\"    Lady was too busy soothing the hurts of her newly discovered mate to  understand. But Lad understood. Lad always understood.          CHAPTER II    \"QUIET\"      To Lad the real world was bounded by The Place. Outside, there were a  certain number of miles of land and there were an uncertain number of  people. But the miles were uninspiring, except for a cross-country  tramp with the Master. And the people were foolish and strange folk  who either stared at him--which always annoyed Lad--or else tried to  pat him; which he hated. But The Place was--The Place.    Always, he had lived on The Place. He felt he owned it. It was  assuredly his to enjoy, to guard, to patrol from high road to lake. It  was his world.    The denizens of every world must have at least one deity to worship.  Lad had one: the Master. Indeed, he had two: the Master and the  Mistress. And because the dog was strong of soul and chivalric,  withal, and because the Mistress was altogether lovable, Lad placed  her altar even above the Master's. Which was wholly as it should have  been.    There were other people at The Place--people to whom a dog must be  courteous, as becomes a thoroughbred, and whose caresses he must  accept. Very often, there were guests, too. And from puppyhood, Lad  had been taught the sacredness of the Guest Law. Civilly, he would  endure the pettings of these visiting outlanders. Gravely, he would  shake hands with them, on request. He would even permit them to paw  him or haul him about, if they were of the obnoxious, dog-mauling  breed. But the moment politeness would permit, he always withdrew,  very quietly, from their reach and, if possible, from their sight as  well.    Of all the dogs on The Place, big Lad alone had free run of the house,  by day and by night.    He slept in a \"cave\" under the piano. He even had access to the sacred  dining-room, at mealtimes--where always he lay to the left of the  Master's chair.    With the Master, he would willingly unbend for a romp at any or all  times. At the Mistress' behest he would play with all the silly  abandon of a puppy; rolling on the ground at her feet, making as  though to seize and crush one of her little shoes in his mighty jaws;  wriggling and waving his legs in air when she buried her hand in the  masses of his chest-ruff; and otherwise comporting himself with  complete loss of dignity.    But to all except these two, he was calmly unapproachable. From his  earliest days he had never forgotten he was an aristocrat among  inferiors. And, calmly aloof, he moved among his subjects.    Then, all at once, into the sweet routine of the House of Peace, came  Horror.    It began on a blustery, sour October day. The Mistress had crossed the  lake to the village, in her canoe, with Lad curled up in a furry heap  in the prow. On the return trip, about fifty yards from shore, the  canoe struck sharply and obliquely against a half-submerged log that a  Fall freshet had swept down from the river above the lake. At the  same moment a flaw of wind caught the canoe's quarter. And, after the  manner of such eccentric craft, the canvas shell proceeded to turn  turtle.    Into the ice-chill waters splashed its two occupants. Lad bobbed to  the top, and glanced around at the Mistress to learn if this were a  new practical joke. But, instantly, he saw it was no joke at all, so  far as she was concerned.    Swathed and cramped by the folds of her heavy outing skirt, the  Mistress was making no progress shoreward. And the dog flung himself  through the water toward her with a rush that left his shoulders and  half his back above the surface. In a second he had reached her and  had caught her sweater-shoulder in his teeth.    She had the presence of mind to lie out straight, as though she were  floating, and to fill her lungs with a swift intake of breath. The  dog's burden was thus made infinitely lighter than if she had  struggled or had lain in a posture less easy for towing. Yet he made  scant headway, until she wound one hand in his mane, and, still lying  motionless and stiff, bade him loose his hold on her shoulder.    In this way, by sustained effort that wrenched every giant muscle in  the collie's body, they came at last to land.    Vastly rejoiced was Lad, and inordinately proud of himself. And  the plaudits of the Master and the Mistress were music to him.  Indefinably, he understood he had done a very wonderful thing and  that everybody on The Place was talking about him, and that all were  trying to pet him at once.    This promiscuous handling he began to find unwelcome. And he retired  at last to his \"cave\" under the piano to escape from it.

Much wheat was exported last year, and there is a brisk  demand for river lands on leases of sixty years for the cultivation of  cotton, cereals, sugar-cane, and date palms.    Persian soldiers all have their donkeys, and at Ahwaz a brisk and  amusing competition is going on between the soldiers of a fine  regiment stationed there and the Arabs for the transport of goods past  the rapids, and for the conveyance of tramway and building materials.  This competition is enabling goods to pass the rapids cheaply and  expeditiously.    One interesting feature connected with these works is the rapidly  increased well-being of the Arabs. In less than a year labour at 1  _kran_ (8d.) a day has put quite a number of them in possession of a  pair of donkeys and a plough, and seed-corn wherewith to cultivate  Government lands on their own account, besides leaving a small balance  in hand on which to live without having to borrow on the coming crop  at frightfully usurious rates.    Until now the sheikhs have been able to command labour for little more  than the poorest food; and now many of the very poor who depended on  them have started as small farmers, and things are rapidly changing.    The careful observer, from whose report on Persia to the Foreign  Office, No. 207, I have transferred the foregoing facts, wrote in  January 1891: \"It was a sight to see the whole Arab population on the  river banks hard at work taking advantage of the copious rain which  had just fallen; every available animal fit for draught was yoked to  the plough--horses, mules, bullocks, and donkeys, and even mares, with  their foals following them up the furrows.\"    This, which is practically a Persian opening of the trade of the  Karun, is not what was expected, however much it was to be desired.  After a journey of nine months through Persia, I am strongly of  opinion that if the Empire is to have a solid and permanent  resurrection, it must be through the enterprise of Persians, aided it  may be by foreign skill and capital, though the less of the latter  that is employed the more hopefully I should regard the Persian  future. The _Nasiri_ Company and the Messrs. Lynch may possibly unite,  and the New Road Company may join with them in making a regular  transport service by river and road to Tihran, by which England may  pour her manufactured goods even into Northern Persia, as this route  would compete successfully both with the Baghdad and Trebizond routes.    Already, owing to the improved circumstances of the people, the import  of English and Indian cotton goods and of sugar has increased; the  latter, which is French, from its low price, only 21/2d. a pound in the  Gulf, pushing its way as far north as Sultanabad. Unfortunately the  shadow of Russia hangs over the future of Persia.]    At present two English and four Turkish boats run on the Tigris. They  are necessarily of light draught, as the river is shallow at certain  seasons and is full of shifting sand-banks. The _Mejidieh_ is a  comfortable boat, with a superabundance of excellent food. Her saloon,  state-rooms, and engines are on the main deck, which is open fore and  aft, and has above it a fine hurricane deck, on the fore part of which  the deck passengers, a motley crowd, encamp. She is fully loaded with  British goods.    The first object of passing interest was Kornah, reputed among the  Arabs to be the site of the Garden of Eden, a tongue of land at the  junction of the Tigris and Euphrates. The \"Garden of Eden\" contains a  village, and bright fires burned in front of the mat-and-mud houses.  Women in red and white, and turbaned men in brown, flitted across the  firelight; there was a mass of vegetation, chiefly palms with a number  of native vessels moored to their stems, and a leaning minaret. A  frosty moonlight glorified the broad, turbid waters, Kornah and the  Euphrates were left in shadow, and we turned up the glittering  waterway of the Tigris. The night was too keenly frosty for any dreams  of Paradise, even in this classic Chaldaea, and under a sky blazing  down to the level horizon with the countless stars which were not to  outnumber the children of \"Faithful Abraham.\"    Four hours after leaving Kornah we passed the reputed tomb of Ezra the  prophet. At a distance and in the moonlight it looked handsome. There  is a buttressed river wall, and above it some long flat-roofed  buildings, the centre one surmounted by a tiled dome. The Tigris is so  fierce and rapid, and swallows its alluvial banks so greedily, that it  is probable that some of the buildings described by the Hebrew  traveller Benjamin of Tudela as existing in the twelfth century were  long since carried away. The tomb is held in great veneration not only  by Jews and Moslems but also by Oriental Christians. It is a great  place of Jewish pilgrimage, and is so venerated by the Arabs that it  needs no guard.[4]    Hadji brought my breakfast, or as he called it, \"the grub,\" the next  morning, and I contemplated the Son of Abraham with some astonishment.  He had discarded his turban and _abba_, and looked a regular  uncivilised desert Ishmaelite, with knives and rosaries in his belt,  and his head muffled in a _kiffiyeh_, a yellow silk shawl striped with  red, with one point and tassels half a yard long hanging down his  back, and fastened round his head by three coils of camel's-hair rope.  A loose coat with a gay girdle, \"breeks\" of some kind, loose boots  turned up at the toes and reaching to the knees, and a striped  under-garment showing here and there, completed his costume.    The view from the hurricane deck, though there are no striking  varieties, is too novel to be monotonous. The level plains of Chaldaea,  only a few feet higher than the Tigris, stretch away to the distant  horizon, unbroken until to-day, when low hills, white with the first  snows of winter, are softly painted on a pure blue sky, very far away.  The plains are buff and brown, with an occasional splash, near  villages as buff and brown as the soil out of which they rise, of the  dark-green of date gardens, or the vivid green of winter wheat. With  the exception of these gardens, which are rarely seen, the vast  expanse is unbroken by a tree. A few miserable shrubs there are, the  _mimosa agrestis_ or St. John's bread, and a scrubby tamarisk, while  liquorice, wormwood, capers, and some alkaline plants which camels  love, are recognisable even in their withered condition.    There are a few villages of low mud hovels enclosed by square mud  walls, and hamlets of mat huts, the mats being made of woven sedges  and flags, strengthened by palm fronds, but oftener by the tall, tough  stems of growing reeds bent into arches, and woven together by the  long leaves of aquatic plants, chiefly rushes. The hovels, so  ingeniously constructed, are shared indiscriminately by the Arabs and  their animals, and crowds of women and children emerged from them as  we passed. Each village has its arrangement for raising water from the  river.    Boats under sail, usually a fleet at a time, hurry downstream, owing  more to the strong current than to the breeze, or are hauled up  laboriously against both by their Arab crews.    The more distant plain is sparsely sprinkled with clusters of brown  tents, long and low, and is dotted over with flocks of large brown  sheep, shepherded by Arabs in _kiffiyehs_, each shepherd armed with a  long gun slung over his shoulder. Herds of cattle and strings of  camels move slowly over the brown plain, and companies of men on  horseback, with long guns and lances, gallop up to the river bank,  throw their fiery horses on their haunches, and after a moment of  gratified curiosity wheel round and gallop back to the desert from  which they came. Occasionally a stretch of arable land is being  ploughed up by small buffaloes with most primitive ploughs, but the  plains are pastoral chiefly, tents and flocks are their chief  features--features which have changed little since the great Sheikh  Abraham, whose descendants now people them, left his \"kindred\" in the  not distant Ur of the Chaldees, and started on the long march to  Canaan.    Reedy marshes, alive with water-fowl, arable lands, bare buff plains,  brown tents, brown flocks, mat huts, mud and brick villages, groups of  women and children, flights of armed horsemen, alternate rapidly,--the  unchanging features are the posts and wires of the telegraph.    The Tigris in parts is wonderfully tortuous, and at one great bend,  \"The Devil's Elbow,\" a man on foot can walk the distance in less than  an hour which takes the steamer four hours to accomplish. The current  is very strong, and the slow progress is rendered slower at this  season of low water by the frequent occurrence of sand-banks, of which  one is usually made aware by a jolt, a grinding sound, a cessation of  motion, some turns astern, and then full speed ahead, which often  overcomes the obstacle. Some hours' delay and the floats of one  paddle-wheel injured were the most serious disasters brought about;  and in spite of the shallows at this season, the Tigris is a noble  river, and the voyage is truly fascinating. Not that there are many  remarkable objects, but the desert atmosphere and the desert freedom  are in themselves delightful, the dust and _debris_ are the dust and  _debris_ of mighty empires, and there are countless associations with  the earliest past of which we have any records.    Aimarah, a rising Turkish town of about 7000 people, built at a point  where the river turns at a sharp angle to the left, is interesting as  showing what commerce can create even here, in less than twenty years.  A caravan route into Persia was opened and Aimarah does a somewhat  busy trade. Flat-faced brick buildings, with projecting lattice  windows, run a good way along the left bank of the river, which is so  steep and irregular that the crowd which thronged it when the"]]]
