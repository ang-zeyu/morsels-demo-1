Some maintain the dignity of the  Court by fining and committing for contempt. Occasionally this may be  necessary, but it has been found that delicate ridicule is often more  effective. An attorney, pleading his cause before Lord Ellenborough,  became exasperated because the untenable points he continually raised  were invariably overruled, and exclaimed, \"My lord, my lord, although  your lordship is so great a man now, I remember the time when I could  have got your opinion for five shillings.\" With an amused smile his  lordship quietly observed, \"Sir, I say it was not worth the money.\"    The same judge used to be greatly annoyed during the season of colds  with the noise of coughing in Court. On one occasion, when disturbances  of this kind recurred with more than usual frequency, he was seen  fidgeting about in his seat, and availing himself of a slight  cessation observed in his usual emphatic manner: \"Some slight  interruption one _might_ tolerate, but there seems to be an _industry_  of coughing.\"    As an illustration of figurative oratory a good story is told of a  barrister pleading before Lord Ellenborough: \"My lord, I appear before  you in the character of an advocate for the City of London; my lord, the  City of London herself appears before you as a suppliant for justice. My  lord, it is written in the book of nature.\"--\"What book?\" said Lord  Ellenborough. \"The book of nature.\"--\"Name the page,\" said his lordship,  holding his pen uplifted, as if to note the page down.    Moore relates the story of a noble lord in the course of one of his  speeches saying, \"I ask myself so and so,\" and repeating the words \"I  ask myself.\" \"Yes,\" quietly remarked Lord Ellenborough, \"and a d--d  foolish answer you'll get.\"           *       *       *       *       *    The comparison of a father and son who have both ascended the Bench has  afforded a good story of a famous Scottish advocate which is told later,  and the following is an equally cutting retort from the Bench to any  assumed superiority through such a connection. A son of Lord Chief  Justice Willes (who rose to the rank of a Puisne Judge) was checked one  day for wandering from the subject. \"I wish that you would remember,\"  he exclaimed, \"that I am the son of a Chief Justice.\" To which Justice  Gould replied with great simplicity, \"Oh, we remember your father, but  he was a sensible man.\"           *       *       *       *       *    When hanging was the sentence, on conviction, for crimes--in these days  termed offences--which are now punished by imprisonment, some judges  from meting out the sentence of death almost indiscriminately came to be  known as \"hanging judges.\" Justice Page was one of them. When he was  decrepit he perpetrated a joke against himself. Coming out of the Court  one day and shuffling along the street a friend stopped him to inquire  after his health. \"My dear sir,\" the judge replied, \"you see I keep just  hanging on--hanging on.\"    A Chief Justice of the \"hanging\" period, whose integrity was not above  suspicion, was sitting in Court one day at his ease and lolling on his  elbow, when a convict from the dock hurled a stone at him which  fortunately passed over his head. \"You see,\" said the learned man as he  smilingly received the congratulations of those present--\"you see now,  if I had been an _upright judge_ I had been slain.\"           *       *       *       *       *    [Illustration: LLOYD KENYON, BARON KENYON, LORD CHIEF JUSTICE.]    Some of the stories respecting Lord Kenyon's historical allusions and  quotations are surely greatly exaggerated, or are pure inventions. In  addressing a jury in a blasphemy case, he is reported to have said that  the Emperor Julian \"was so celebrated for the practice of every  Christian virtue that he was called 'Julian the Apostle'\"; and to have  concluded an elaborate address in dismissing a grand jury with the  following valediction: \"Having thus discharged your consciences,  gentlemen, you may return to your homes in peace, with the delightful  consciousness of having performed your duties well, and may lay your  heads on your pillows, saying to yourselves 'Aut Caesar, aut nullus.'\"  And this was his remark on detecting the trick of an attorney to delay a  trial: \"This is the last hair in the tail of procrastination, and it  must be plucked out.\"    Among other failings attributed to this Lord Chief Justice was the  extreme penuriousness he practised in his domestic arrangements and his  dress. His shoes were patched to such an extent that little of their  original material could be seen, and once when trying a case he was  sitting on the bench in a way to expose them to all in Court. It was an  action for breach of contract to deliver shoes soundly made, and to  clinch a witness for the pursuer he suddenly asked, \"Were the shoes  anything like these?\" pointing to his own. \"No, my lord,\" replied the  witness, \"they were a good deal better and more genteeler.\"    As an example of his (Lord Kenyon's) style of addressing a condemned  prisoner we have the following. A butler had been charged and convicted  of stealing his master's wine.    \"Prisoner at the bar, you stand convicted on the most conclusive  evidence of a crime of inexpressible atrocity--a crime that defiles the  sacred springs of domestic confidence, and is calculated to strike alarm  into the breast of every Englishman who invests largely in the choicer  vintages of Southern Europe. Like the serpent of old, you have stung the  hand of your protector. Fortunate in having a generous employer, you  might without discovery have continued to supply your wretched wife and  children with the comforts of sufficient prosperity, and even with some  of the luxuries of affluence; but, dead to every claim of natural  affection, and blind to your own real interest, you burst through all  the restraints of religion and morality, and have for many years been  _feathering_ your nest with your master's _bottles_.\"    Lord Kenyon was warmly attached to George III, who had a high opinion of  him; but like many of his lordship's contemporaries, his Majesty  strongly deprecated the frequent outbursts of temper on the part of his  Chief Justice. \"At a levee, soon after an extraordinary explosion of  ill-humour in the Court of King's Bench, his Majesty said to him: 'My  Lord Chief Justice, I hear that you have lost your temper, and from my  great regard for you, I am very glad to hear it, for I hope you will  find a better one.'\"           *       *       *       *       *    Of Lord Chief Justice Tenterden, Lord Campbell asserts that he once, and  only once, uttered a pun. A learned gentleman, who had lectured on the  law and was too much addicted to oratory came to argue a special  demurrer before him. \"My client's opponent,\" said the figurative  advocate, \"worked like a mole under ground, _clam et secrete_.\" His  figures only elicited a grunt from the Chief Justice. \"It is asserted in  Aristotle's _Rhetoric_--.\"--\"I don't want to hear what is asserted in  Aristotle's _Rhetoric_,\" interposed Lord Tenterden. The advocate shifted  his ground and took up, as he thought, a safe position. \"It is laid down  in the _Pandects_ of Justinian--.\" \"Where are you got now?\" \"It is a  principle of the civil law--.\" \"Oh sir,\" exclaimed the judge, with a  tone and voice which abundantly justified his assertion, \"we have  nothing to do with the _civil_ law in this Court.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Judges sometimes stray into humour without intending it. At an election  petition trial one allegation was, that a number of rosettes, or \"marks  of distinction,\" had been kept in a table drawer in the central  committee-room. To meet this charge it was thought desirable to call  witnesses to swear that the only table in the room consisted of planks  laid on trestles. \"So that the table had no proper legs,\" said counsel  cheerfully. \"Never mind whether it had proper legs,\" said one of the  learned judges. \"The more important question is: Had it drawers?\"    And in _The Story of Crime_ the author recalls an instance of a judge  unconsciously furnishing material for laughter in Court. \"At the  beginning of the session at the Old Baily a good deal of work is got  through by the judge who takes the small cases, and it may be this fact  that accounted for the confusion of thought which he describes. One of  the prisoners was charged with stealing a camera, and after all the  evidence had been taken his lordship proceeded to sum up to the jury. He  began by correctly describing the stolen article as a camera, but had  not gone very far before the camera had become a concertina, and by the  time he had finished the concertina had become an accordion. And he  never once saw his mistake. The usher noticed it at the first trip, and  kept repeating in a kind of hoarse stage-whisper, 'Camera! Camera!' but  his voice did not reach the Bench, and so the complicated article  remained on record.\"    Mr. Andrews in his book, _The Lawyer in History, Literature, and  Humour_, relates that a leader of the Bar on rising to address the  drowsy jury after a ponderous oration by Sir Samuel Prime, said:  \"Gentlemen, after the long speech of the learned serjeant--\" \"Sir, I  beg your pardon,\" interrupted Mr. Justice Nares, \"you might say--you  might say--after the long soliloquy, for my brother Prime has been  talking an hour to himself.\"           *       *       *       *       *    [Illustration: THOMAS ERSKINE, BARON ERSKINE, LORD CHANCELLOR.]    Thomas, Lord Erskine was the youngest of three brothers, who were all  distinguished men. The eldest was the well-known Earl of Buchan, one of  the founders of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, whose "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3003"],[0,"Wild Flowers (#4)"],[1,"erseverance. It is said some relics of  gold and fine stones, somewhat resembling an insect in shape, had  been found in the tomb of Clovis's father, and on the supposition  that these had been bees, Napoleon appropriated them for the  imperial badge. Henceforth \"Napoleonic bees\" appeared on his  coronation robe and wherever a heraldic emblem could be employed.    But even in the meadows of France Napoleon need not have looked  far from the fleurs-de-lis growing there to find bees. Indeed,  this gorgeous flower is thought by scientists to be all that it  is for the bees' benefit, which, of course, is its own also.  Abundant moisture, from which to manufacture nectar - a prime  necessity with most irises - certainly is for our blue flag. The  large showy blossom cannot but attract the passing bee, whose  favorite color (according to Sir John Lubbock) it waves. The bee  alights on the convenient, spreading platform, and, guided by the  dark veining and golden lines leading to the nectar, sips the  delectable fluid shortly to be changed to honey. Now, as he  raises his head and withdraws it from the nectary, he must rub it  against the pollen-laden anther above, and some of the pollen  necessarily falls on the visitor. As the sticky side of the plate  (stigma), just under the petal-like division of the style, faces  away from the anther, which is below it in any case, the flower  is marvelously guarded against fertilization from its own pollen.  The bee, flying off to another iris, must first brush past the  projecting lip of the over-arching style, and leave on the  stigmatic outer surface of the plate some of the pollen brought  from the first flower, before reaching the nectary. Thus  cross-fertilization is effected; and Darwin has shown how  necessary this is to insure the most vigorous and beautiful  offspring. Without this wonderful adaptation of the flower to the  requirements of its insect friends, and of the insect to the  needs of the flower, both must perish; the former from hunger,  the latter because unable to perpetuate its race. And yet man has  greedily appropriated all the beauties of the floral kingdom as  designed for his sole delight    The name iris, meaning a deified rainbow, which was given this  group of plants by the ancients, shows a fine appreciation of  their superb coloring, their ethereal texture, and the evanescent  beauty of the blossom.    In spite of the name given to another species, the SOUTHERN BLUE  FLAG (I. hexagona) is really the larger one; its leaves, which  are bright green, and never hoary, often equaling the stem in its  height of from two to three feet. The handsome solitary flower,  similar to that of the larger blue flag, nevertheless has its  broad outer divisions fully an inch larger, and is seated in the  axils at the top of the circular stem. The oblong, cylindric,  six-angled capsule also contains two rows of seeds in each  cavity. From South Carolina and Florida to Kentucky, Missouri,  and Texas one finds this iris blooming in the swamps during April  and May.    The SLENDER BLUE FLAG (I. prismatica; I. Virginica of Gray),  found growing from New Brunswick to North Carolina, but mainly  near the coast, and often in the same oozy ground with the larger  blue flag, may be known by its grass-like leaves, two or three of  which usually branch out from the slender flexuous stem; by its  solitary or two blue flowers, variegated with white and veined  with yellow, that rear themselves on slender foot-stems; and by  the sharply three-angled, narrow, oblong capsule, in which but  one row of seeds is borne in each cavity. This is the most  graceful member of a rather stiffly stately family.      POINTED BLUE-EYED GRASS; EYE-BRIGHT; BLUE STAR    (Sisyrinchium angustifolium)  Iris family    Flowers - From blue to purple, with a yellow center; a Western  variety, white; usually several buds at the end of stem, between  2 erect unequal bracts; about 1/2 in. across; perianth of 6  spreading divisions, each pointed with a bristle from a notch;  stamens 3, the filaments united to above the middle; pistil 1,  its tip 3-cleft. Stem: 3 to 14 in. tall, pale hoary green, flat,  rigid, 2-edged. Leaves: Grass-like, pale, rigid, mostly from  base. Fruit: 3-celled capsule, nearly globose.  Preferred Habitat - Moist fields and meadows.  Flowering Season - May-August.  Distribution - Newfoundland to British Columbia, from eastern  slope of Rocky Mountains to Atlantic, south to Virginia and  Kansas.    Only for a day, and that must be a bright one, will this \"little  sister of the stately blue flag\" open its eyes, to close them in  indignation on being picked; nor will any coaxing but the  sunshine's induce it to open them again in water, immediately  after. The dainty flower, growing in dense tufts, makes up in  numbers what it lacks in size and lasting power, flecking our  meadows with purplish ultramarine blue in a sunny June morning.  Later in the day, apparently there are no blossoms there, for all  are tightly closed, never to bloom again. New buds will unfold to  tinge the field on the morrow.    Usually three buds nod from between a pair of bracts, the lower  one of which may be twice the length of the upper one but only  one flower opens at a time. Slight variations in this plant have  been considered sufficient to differentiate several species  formerly included by Gray and other American botanists under the  name of S. Bermudiana.      LARGE or EARLY, PURPLE-FRINGED ORCHIS    (Habenaria grandiflora; H. fimbriata of Gray)  Orchid family    Flowers - Pink-purple and pale lilac, sometimes nearly white;  fragrant, alternate, clustered in thick, dense spikes from 3 to  15 in. long. Upper sepal and toothed petals erect; the lip of  deepest shade, 1/2 in. long, fan-shaped, 3-parted, fringed half  its length, and prolonged at base into slender, long spur; stamen  united with style into short column; 2 anther sacs slightly  divergent, the hollow between them glutinous, stigmatic. Stem. 1  to 5 ft. high, angled, twisted. Leaves: Oval, large, sheathing  the stem below; smaller, lance-shaped ones higher up; bracts  above. Root: Thick, fibrous.  Preferred Habitat - Rich, moist meadows, muddy places, woods.  Flowering Season - June-August.  Distribution - New Brunswick to Ontario; southward to North  Carolina, westward to Michigan.    Because of the singular and exquisitely unerring adaptations of  orchids as a family to their insect visitors, no group of plants  has greater interest for the botanist since Darwin interpreted  their marvelous mechanism, and Gray, his instant disciple,  revealed the hidden purposes of our native American species, no  less wonderfully constructed than the most costly exotic in a  millionaire's hothouse.    A glance at the spur of this orchid, one of the handsomest and  most striking of its clan, and the heavy perfume of the flower,  would seem to indicate that only a moth with a long proboscis  could reach the nectar secreted at the base of the thread-like  passage. Butterflies, attracted by the conspicuous color,  sometimes hover about the showy spikes of bloom, but it is  probable that, to secure a sip, all but possibly the very largest  of them must go to the smaller purple-fringed orchis, whose  shorter spur holds out a certain prospect of reward; for, in  these two cases, as in so many others, the flower's welcome for  an insect is in exact proportion to the length of its visitor's  tongue. Doubtless it is one of the smaller sphinx moths, such as  we see at dusk working about the evening primrose and other  flowers deep of chalice, and heavily perfumed to guide visitors  to their feast, that is the great purple-fringed orchid's  benefactor, since the length of its tongue is perfectly adapted  to its needs. Attracted by the showy, broad lower petal, his  wings ever in rapid motion, the moth proceeds to unroll his  proboscis and drain the cup, that is frequently an inch and a  half deep. Thrusting in his head, either one or both of his  large, projecting eyes are pressed against the sticky  button-shaped disks to which the pollen masses are attached by a  stalk, and as he raises his head to depart, feeling that he is  caught, he gives a little jerk that detaches them, and away he  flies with these still fastened to his eyes.    Even while he is flying to another flower, that is to say, in  half a minute, the stalks of the pollen masses bend downward from  the perpendicular and slightly toward the center, or just far  enough to require the moth, in thrusting his proboscis into the  nectary, to strike the glutinous, sticky stigma. Now, withdrawing  his head, either or both of the golden clubs he brought in with  him will be left on the precise spot where they will fertilize  the flower. Sometimes, but rarely, we catch a butterfly or moth  from the smaller or larger purple orchids with a pollen mass  attached to his tongue, instead of to his eyes; this is when he  does not make his entrance from the exact center - as in these  flowers he is not obliged to do - and in order to reach the  nectary his tongue necessarily brushes against one of the sticky  anther sacs. The performance may be successfully imitated by  thrusting some blunt point about the size of a moth's head, a  dull pencil or a knitting-needle, into the flower as an insect  would enter. Withdraw the pencil, and one or both of the pollen  masses will be found sticking to it, and already automatically  changing their attitude. In the case of the large, round-leaved  orchis, whose greenish-white flowers are fertilized in a similar  manner by the sphinx moth, the anther sacs converge, like little  horns; and their change of attitude while they are being carried  to fertilize another flower is quite as exquisitely exact.    Usually in wetter ground than we find its more beautiful big  sister growing in, most frequently in swamps and bogs, the  SMALLER PURPLE-FRINGED ORCHIS (H. psycodes) lifts its"]]]
