[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/382"],[0,"Edinburgh: Picturesque Notes (#4)"],[1,"the stream goes by, east and west, and leaves the  Parliament Close to Charles the Second and the birds.  Once in a while, a  patient crowd may be seen loitering there all day, some eating fruit,  some reading a newspaper; and to judge by their quiet demeanour, you  would think they were waiting for a distribution of soup-tickets.  The  fact is far otherwise; within in the Justiciary Court a man is upon trial  for his life, and these are some of the curious for whom the gallery was  found too narrow.  Towards afternoon, if the prisoner is unpopular, there  will be a round of hisses when he is brought forth.  Once in a while,  too, an advocate in wig and gown, hand upon mouth, full of pregnant nods,  sweeps to and fro in the arcade listening to an agent; and at certain  regular hours a whole tide of lawyers hurries across the space.    The Parliament Close has been the scene of marking incidents in Scottish  history.  Thus, when the Bishops were ejected from the Convention in  1688, 'all fourteen of them gathered together with pale faces and stood  in a cloud in the Parliament Close:' poor episcopal personages who were  done with fair weather for life!  Some of the west-country Societarians  standing by, who would have 'rejoiced more than in great sums' to be at  their hanging, hustled them so rudely that they knocked their heads  together.  It was not magnanimous behaviour to dethroned enemies; but  one, at least, of the Societarians had groaned in the _boots_, and they  had all seen their dear friends upon the scaffold.  Again, at the 'woeful  Union,' it was here that people crowded to escort their favourite from  the last of Scottish parliaments: people flushed with nationality, as  Boswell would have said, ready for riotous acts, and fresh from throwing  stones at the author of 'Robinson Crusoe' as he looked out of window.                 [Picture: John Knox's House in the High Street]    One of the pious in the seventeenth century, going to pass his _trials_  (examinations as we now say) for the Scottish Bar, beheld the Parliament  Close open and had a vision of the mouth of Hell.  This, and small  wonder, was the means of his conversion.  Nor was the vision unsuitable  to the locality; for after an hospital, what uglier piece is there in  civilisation than a court of law?  Hither come envy, malice, and all  uncharitableness to wrestle it out in public tourney; crimes, broken  fortunes, severed households, the knave and his victim, gravitate to this  low building with the arcade.  To how many has not St. Giles's bell told  the first hour after ruin?  I think I see them pause to count the  strokes, and wander on again into the moving High Street, stunned and  sick at heart.    A pair of swing doors gives admittance to a hall with a carved roof, hung  with legal portraits, adorned with legal statuary, lighted by windows of  painted glass, and warmed by three vast fires.  This is the _Salle des  pas perdus_ of the Scottish Bar.  Here, by a ferocious custom, idle  youths must promenade from ten till two.  From end to end, singly or in  pairs or trios, the gowns and wigs go back and forward.  Through a hum of  talk and footfalls, the piping tones of a Macer announce a fresh cause  and call upon the names of those concerned.  Intelligent men have been  walking here daily for ten or twenty years without a rag of business or a  shilling of reward.  In process of time, they may perhaps be made the  Sheriff-Substitute and Fountain of Justice at Lerwick or Tobermory.  There is nothing required, you would say, but a little patience and a  taste for exercise and bad air.  To breathe dust and bombazine, to feed  the mind on cackling gossip, to hear three parts of a case and drink a  glass of sherry, to long with indescribable longings for the hour when a  man may slip out of his travesty and devote himself to golf for the rest  of the afternoon, and to do this day by day and year after year, may seem  so small a thing to the inexperienced!  But those who have made the  experiment are of a different way of thinking, and count it the most  arduous form of idleness.    More swing doors open into pigeon-holes where judges of the First Appeal  sit singly, and halls of audience where the supreme Lords sit by three or  four.  Here, you may see Scott's place within the bar, where he wrote  many a page of Waverley novels to the drone of judicial proceeding.  You  will hear a good deal of shrewdness, and, as their Lordships do not  altogether disdain pleasantry, a fair proportion of dry fun.  The  broadest of broad Scotch is now banished from the bench; but the courts  still retain a certain national flavour.  We have a solemn enjoyable way  of lingering on a case.  We treat law as a fine art, and relish and  digest a good distinction.  There is no hurry: point after point must be  rightly examined and reduced to principle; judge after judge must utter  forth his _obiter dicta_ to delighted brethren.    Besides the courts, there are installed under the same roof no less than  three libraries: two of no mean order; confused and semi-subterranean,  full of stairs and galleries; where you may see the most studious-looking  wigs fishing out novels by lanthorn light, in the very place where the  old Privy Council tortured Covenanters.  As the Parliament House is built  upon a slope, although it presents only one story to the north, it  measures half-a-dozen at least upon the south; and range after range of  vaults extend below the libraries.  Few places are more characteristic of  this hilly capital.  You descend one stone stair after another, and  wander, by the flicker of a match, in a labyrinth of stone cellars.  Now,  you pass below the Outer Hall and hear overhead, brisk but ghostly, the  interminable pattering of legal feet.  Now, you come upon a strong door  with a wicket: on the other side are the cells of the police office and  the trap-stair that gives admittance to the dock in the Justiciary Court.  Many a foot that has gone up there lightly enough, has been dead-heavy in  the descent.  Many a man's life has been argued away from him during long  hours in the court above.  But just now that tragic stage is empty and  silent like a church on a week-day, with the bench all sheeted up and  nothing moving but the sunbeams on the wall.  A little farther and you  strike upon a room, not empty like the rest, but crowded with  _productions_ from bygone criminal cases: a grim lumber: lethal weapons,  poisoned organs in a jar, a door with a shot-hole through the panel,  behind which a man fell dead.  I cannot fancy why they should preserve  them unless it were against the Judgment Day.  At length, as you continue  to descend, you see a peep of yellow gaslight and hear a jostling,  whispering noise ahead; next moment you turn a corner, and there, in a  whitewashed passage, is a machinery belt industriously turning on its  wheels.  You would think the engine had grown there of its own accord,  like a cellar fungus, and would soon spin itself out and fill the vaults  from end to end with its mysterious labours.  In truth, it is only some  gear of the steam ventilator; and you will find the engineers at hand,  and may step out of their door into the sunlight.  For all this while,  you have not been descending towards the earth's centre, but only to the  bottom of the hill and the foundations of the Parliament House; low down,  to be sure, but still under the open heaven and in a field of grass.  The  daylight shines garishly on the back windows of the Irish quarter; on  broken shutters, wry gables, old palsied houses on the brink of ruin, a  crumbling human pig-sty fit for human pigs.  There are few signs of life,  besides a scanty washing or a face at a window: the dwellers are abroad,  but they will return at night and stagger to their pallets.          CHAPTER IV. LEGENDS.      The character of a place is often most perfectly expressed in its  associations.  An event strikes root and grows into a legend, when it has  happened amongst congenial surroundings.  Ugly actions, above all in ugly  places, have the true romantic quality, and become an undying property of  their scene.  To a man like Scott, the different appearances of nature  seemed each to contain its own legend ready made, which it was his to  call forth: in such or such a place, only such or such events ought with  propriety to happen; and in this spirit he made the _Lady of the Lake_  for Ben Venue, the _Heart of Midlothian_ for Edinburgh, and the _Pirate_,  so indifferently written but so romantically conceived, for the desolate  islands and roaring tideways of the North.  The common run of mankind  have, from generation to generation, an instinct almost as delicate as  that of Scott; but where he created new things, they only forget what is  unsuitable among the old; and by survival of the fittest, a body of  tradition becomes a work of art.  So, in the low dens and high-flying  garrets of Edinburgh, people may go back upon dark passages in the town's  adventures, and chill their marrow with winter's tales about the fire:  tales that are singularly apposite and characteristic, not only of the  old life, but of the very constitution of built nature in that part, and  singularly well qualified to add horror to horror, when the wind pipes  around the tall _lands_, and hoots adown arched passages, and the  far-spread wilderness of city lamps keeps quavering and flaring in the  gusts.    [Picture: The Canongate] Here, it is the tale of Begbie the bank-porter,  stricken to the heart at a blow and left in his blood within a step or  two of the crowded High Street.  There, people hush their voices over  Burke and Hare; over drugs and violated graves, and the resurrection-men  smothering their victims with their knees.  Here, again, the fame of  Deacon Brodie is kept piously fresh.  A great man in his day was the  Deacon; well seen in good society, crafty with his hands as "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38207"],[0,"On the Origin and Metamorphoses of Insects (#4)"],[1," much resembles a caterpillar, both in form and habits. To  this group belongs the nigger, or black caterpillar of the turnip, which  is often in sufficient numbers to do much mischief. Some species make  galls, but the greater number of galls are formed by insects of another  family, the Cynipidae.    [Illustration: PLATE I.[7]--MATURE INSECTS.    Fig. 1, Cricket; 2, Earwig; 3, _Aphis_; 4, _Scolytus_; 5, Anthrax;  6, _Balaninus_; 7, _Cynips_; 8, Ant; 9, Wasp.]    [Illustration: PLATE II.--LARVAE OF THE INSECTS REPRESENTED ON PLATE I.    Fig. 1, Larva of Cricket; 2, Larva of Aphis; 3, Larva of Earwig; 4,  Larva of _Scolytus_ (Beetle); 5, Larva of _Anthrax_ (Fly); 6, Larva of  _Balaninus_ (Nut Weevil); 7, Larva of _Cynips_; 8, Larva of Ant;  9, Larva of Wasp.]    In the Cynipidae (Plate I., Fig. 7) the female is provided with an organ  corresponding to the saw of the sawfly, but resembling a needle. With  this she stings or punctures the surface of leaves, buds, stalks, or  even roots of various plants. In the wound thus produced she lays one or  more eggs. The effects of this proceeding, and particularly of the  irritating fluid which she injects into the wound, is to produce a  tumour or gall, within which the egg hatches, and on which the larva, a  thick fleshy grub (Plate II., Fig. 7), feeds. In some species each gall  contains a single larva; in others, several live together.    The oak supports several kinds of gallflies: one produces the well-known  oak-apple, one a small swelling on the leaf resembling a currant,  another a gall somewhat like an acorn, another attacks the root; the  species making the bullet-like galls, which are now so common, has only  existed for a few years in this country; the beautiful little spangles  so common in autumn on the under side of oak leaves are the work of  another species, the _Cynus longipennis_. One curious point about this  group is, that in some of the commonest species the females alone are  known, no one yet having ever succeeded in finding a male.    Another great family of the Hymenoptera is that of the ichneumons; the  females lay their eggs either in or on other insects, within the bodies  of which the larvae live. These larvae are thick, fleshy, legless grubs,  and feed on the fatty tissues of their hosts, but do not attack the  vital organs. When full-grown, the grubs eat their way through the skin  of the insect, and turn into chrysalides. Almost every kind of insect  is subject to the attacks of these little creatures, which are no doubt  useful in preventing the too great multiplication of insects, and  especially of caterpillars. Some species are so minute that they  actually lay their eggs within those of other insects (Figs. 15, 16).  These parasites assume very curious forms in their larval state.    But of all the Hymenoptera, the group containing the ant, the bee, and  the wasp is the most interesting. This is especially the case with the  social species, though the solitary ones also are extremely remarkable.  The solitary bee or wasp, for instance, forms a cell generally in the  ground, places in it a sufficient amount of food, lays an egg, and  closes the cell. In the case of bees, the food consists of honey; in  that of wasps, the larva requires animal food, and the mother therefore  places a certain number of insects in the cell, each species having its  own special prey, some selecting small caterpillars, some beetles, some  spiders. _Cerceris bupresticida_, as its name denotes, attacks beetles  belonging to the genus _Buprestis_. Now if the Cerceris were to kill the  beetle before placing it in the cell, it would decay, and the young  larva, when hatched, would find only a mass of corruption. On the other  hand, if the beetle were buried uninjured, in its struggles to escape it  would be almost certain to destroy the egg. The wasp has, however, the  instinct of stinging its prey in the centre of the nervous system, thus  depriving it of motion, and let us hope of suffering, but not of life;  consequently, when the young larva leaves the egg, it finds ready a  sufficient store of wholesome food.    Other wasps are social, and, like the bees and ants, dwell together in  communities. They live for one season, dying in autumn, except some of  the females, which hibernate, awake in the spring, and form new  colonies. These, however, do not, under ordinary circumstances, live  through a second winter. One specimen which I kept tame through last  spring and summer, lived until the end of February, but then died. The  larvae of wasps (Plate II., Fig. 9) are fat, fleshy, legless grubs. When  full-grown they spin for themselves a silken covering, within which they  turn into chrysalides. The oval bodies which are so numerous in ants'  nests, and which are generally called ants' eggs, are really not eggs  but cocoons. Ants are very fond of the honey-dew which is formed by the  Aphides, and have been seen to tap the Aphides with their antennae, as if  to induce them to emit some of the sweet secretion. There is a species  of _Aphis_ which lives on the roots of grass, and some ants collect these  into their nests, keeping them, in fact, just as we do cows. Moreover  they collect the eggs in the autumn and tend them through the winter  (when they are of no use) with the same care as their own, so as to have  a supply of young Aphides in the spring. This is one of the most  remarkable facts I know in the whole history of animal life. One species  of red ant does no work for itself, but makes slaves of a black kind,  which then do everything for their masters. The slave makers will not  even put food into their own mouths, but would starve in the midst of  plenty, if they had not a slave to feed them. I found, however, that I  could keep them in life and health for months if I gave them a slave for  an hour or two in a week to clean and feed them.    Ants also keep a variety of beetles and other insects in their nests.  That they have some reason for this seems clear, because they readily  attack any unwelcome intruder; but what that reason is, we do not yet  know. If these insects are to be regarded as the domestic animals of the  ants, then we must admit that the ants possess more domestic animals  than we do.    Some indeed of these beetles produce a secretion which is licked by the  ants like the honey-dew; there are others, however, which have not yet  been shown to be of any use to the ants, and yet are rarely, if ever,  found, excepting in ants' nests.    M. Lespes, who regards these insects as true domestic animals, has  recorded[8] some interesting observations on the relations between one  of them (_Claviger Duvalii_) and the ants (_Lasius niger_) with which it  lives. This species of _Claviger_ is never met with except in ants'  nests, though on the other hand there are many communities of _Lasius_  which possess none of these beetles; and M. Lespes found that when he  placed _Clavigers_ in a nest of ants which had none of their own, the  beetles were immediately killed and eaten, the ants themselves being on  the other hand kindly received by other communities of the same species.  He concludes from these observations that some communities of ants are  more advanced in civilization than others; the suggestion is no doubt  ingenious, and the fact curiously resembles the experience of navigators  who have endeavoured to introduce domestic animals among barbarous  tribes; but M. Lespes has not yet, so far as I am aware, published the  details of his observations, without which it is impossible to form a  decided opinion. I have sometimes wondered whether the ants have any  feeling of reverence for these beetles; but the whole subject is as yet  very obscure, and would well repay careful study.    [Illustration: PLATE III.--MATURE INSECTS.

The larva (Pl. IV., Fig. 8) is  minute, six-legged, and very active; it passes through its  transformations within the body of the bee or wasp. The male and female  are very dissimilar. The males are minute, very active, short-lived, and  excitable, with one pair of large membranous wings. The females (Pl.  III., Fig. 8), on the contrary, are almost motionless, and shaped very  much like a bottle; they never quit the body of the bee, but only thrust  out the top of the bottle between the abdominal rings of the bee.    In the order Coleoptera, the larvae differ very much in form. The  majority are elongated, active, hexapod, and more or less depressed; but  those of the Weevils (Pl. II., Fig. 6), of _Scolytus_ (Pl. II., Fig. 4),  &c., which are vegetable feeders, and live surrounded by their  food,--as, for instance, in grain, nuts, &c.,--are apod, white, fleshy  grubs, not unlike those of bees and ants. The larvae of the Longicorns,  which live inside trees, are long, soft, and fleshy, with six short  legs. The Geodephaga, corresponding with the Linnaean genera _Cicindela_  and _Carabus_, have six-legged, slender, carnivorous larvae; those of  _Cicindela_, which waylay their prey, being less active than the hunting  larvae of the Carabidae. The Hydradephaga, or water-beetles (Dyticidae and  Gyrinidae), have long and narrow larvae (Pl. IV., Fig. 6), with strong  sickle-shaped jaws, short antennae, four palpi, and six small eyes on  each side of the head;"]]]
