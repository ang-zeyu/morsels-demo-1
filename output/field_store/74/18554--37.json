They were the sweetest of kittens, and  we trained them to fetch and carry pieces of paper thrown at a distance  just as a dog would do. We got so far as to throw the paper ball on the  top of wardrobes, or to hide it behind boxes or in tall vases, and they  would retrieve it very prettily with their paws. On attaining years of  discretion, they forsook these frivolous sports and resumed the dreamy,  philosophical calm which is the real characteristic of cats.    All negroes are alike to people who land in a slave-owning country in  America, and it is impossible for them to tell one from another. So, to  those who do not care for them, three black cats are three black cats  and nothing more. But an observing eye makes no such mistake. The  physiognomies of animals are as different as those of men, and I could  always tell to which particular cat belonged the black face, as black as  Harlequin's mask, and lighted by emerald disks with golden gleams.    Enjolras, who was by far the handsomest of the three, was marked by his  big lion-like head and well whiskered cheeks, by his muscular shoulders,  his long back, and his splendid tail, fluffy as a feather duster. There  was something theatrical and grandiloquent about him, and he seemed to  pose like an actor who attracts admiration. His motions were slow,  undulating, and full of majesty; he seemed to be always stepping on a  table covered with china ornaments and Venetian glass, so circumspectly  did he select the place where he put down his foot. He was not much of a  Stoic, and exhibited a liking for food which his namesake would have had  reason to blame. No doubt Enjolras, the pure and sober youth, would have  said to him, as the angel did to Swedenborg, \"You eat too much.\" We  rather encouraged this amusing voracity, analogous to that of monkeys,  and Enjolras grew to a size and weight very uncommon among domestic  cats. Then I bethought myself of having him shaved in the style of  poodles, in order to bring out completely his leonine appearance. He  retained his mane and a long tuft of hair at the end of the tail, and I  would not swear that his thighs were not adorned with mutton-chop  whiskers like those Munito used to wear. Thus trimmed, he resembled, I  must confess, a Japanese monster much more than a lion of the Atlas  Mountains or the Cape. Never was a more extravagant fancy carried out on  the body of a living animal; his closely clipped coat allowed the skin  to show through, and its bluish tones, most curious to note, contrasted  strangely with his black mane.    Gavroche was a cat with a sharp, satirical look, as if he intended to  recall his namesake in the novel. Smaller than Enjolras, he was endowed  with abrupt and comical agility, and in the stead of the puns and slang  of the Paris street-Arab, he indulged in the funniest capers, leaps, and  attitudes. I am bound to add that, yielding to his street instincts,  Gavroche was in the habit of seizing every opportunity of leaving the  drawing-room and going off to join, in the court, and even in the public  streets, numbers of wandering cats, \"of unknown blood and lineage low,\"  with whom he took part in performances of doubtful taste, completely  forgetful of his dignified rank as a Havana cat, the son of the  illustrious Don Pierrot of Navarre, a grandee of Spain of the first  class, and of the Marchioness Seraphita, noted for her haughty and  aristocratic manners.    Sometimes he would bring in to his meals, in order to treat them,  consumptive friends of his, so starved that every rib in their body  showed, having nothing but skin and bones, whom he had picked up in the  course of his excursions and wanderings, for he was a kind-hearted  fellow. The poor devils, their ears laid back, their tails between their  legs, their glance restless, dreading to be driven from their free meal  by a housemaid armed with a broom, swallowed the pieces two, three, and  four at a time, and like the famous dog, _Siete Aguas_ (Seven Waters),  of Spanish posadas, would lick the platter as clean as if it had been  washed and scoured by a Dutch housekeeper who had served as model to  Mieris or Gerard Dow. Whenever I saw Gavroche's companions, I  remembered the lettering under one of Gavarni's drawings: \"A nice lot,  the friends you are capable of proceeding with!\" But after all it was  merely a proof of Gavroche's kindness of heart, for he was quite able to  polish off the plateful himself.    The cat who bore the name of the interesting Eponine was more lissome  and slender in shape than her brothers. Her mien was quite peculiar to  herself, owing to her somewhat long face, her eyes slanting slightly in  the Chinese fashion, and of a green like that of the eyes of Pallas  Athene, on whom Homer invariably bestows the title of ~glaukopis~, her  velvety black nose, of as fine a grain as a Perigord truffle, and her  incessantly moving whiskers. Her coat, of a superb black, was always in  motion and shimmered with infinite changes. There never was a more  sensitive, nervous, and electric animal. If she were stroked two or  three times, in the dark, blue sparks came crackling from her fur. She  attached herself to me in particular, just as in the novel Eponine  becomes attached to Marius. As I was less taken up with Cosette than  that handsome youth, I accepted the love of my affectionate and devoted  cat, who is still the assiduous companion of my labours and the delight  of my hermitage on the confines of the suburbs. She trots up when she  hears the bell ring, welcomes my visitors, leads them into the  drawing-room, shows them to a seat, talks to them--yes, I mean it, talks  to them--with croonings and cooings and whimpers quite unlike the  language cats make use of among themselves, and which simulate the  articulate speech of man. You ask me what it is she says? She says, in  the plainest possible fashion: \"Do not be impatient; look at the  pictures or chat with me, if you enjoy that. My master will be down in a  minute.\" And when I come in she discreetly retires to an arm-chair or on  top of the piano, and listens to the conversation without breaking in  upon it, like a well-bred animal that is used to society.    Sweet Eponine has given us so many proofs of intelligence, kindly  disposition, and sociability that she has been promoted, by common  consent, to the dignity of a _person_, for it is plain that a higher  order of reason than instinct guides her actions. This dignity entails  the right of eating at table like a person, and not from a saucer in a  corner, like an animal. So Eponine's chair is placed beside mine at  lunch and dinner, and on account of her size she is allowed to rest her  fore paws upon the edge of the table. She has her own place set, without  fork or spoon, but with her glass. She eats of every course that is  brought on, from the soup to the dessert, always waiting for her turn to  be served and behaving with a discretion and decency that it is to be  wished were more frequently met with in children. She turns up at the  first sound of the bell, and when we enter the dining-room we are sure  to find her already in her place, standing on her chair, her paws on the  edge of the table, and holding up her little head to be kissed, like a  well-bred young lady who is polite and affectionate towards her parents  and her elders.    The sun has its spots, the diamond its flaws, and perfection itself its  little weak points. Eponine, it must be owned, has an overmastering  fondness for fish, a taste she shares in common with all her race. The  Latin proverb, _Catus amat pisces, sed non vult tingere plantas_, to the  contrary notwithstanding, she is always ready to pop her paw into the  water to fish out a blay, a small carp, or a trout. Fish makes her  well-nigh delirious, and like children eagerly looking for the dessert,  she is apt to object to the soup, when the preliminary investigations  she has carried on in the kitchen have enabled her to ascertain that the  fish has duly come in and that there is no reason why Vatel should run  himself through with his sword. In such cases we do not help her to  fish, and I remark to her, in a cold tone, \"A lady who has no appetite  for soup cannot have any appetite for fish,\" and the dish is  remorselessly sent past her. Then seeing that it is no joking matter,  dainty Eponine bolts her soup in hot haste, licks up the very last drop  of the bouillon, puts away the minutest crumb of bread or Italian paste,  and turns round to me with the proud look of one conscious of being  without fear or reproach and of having fulfilled her duty. Her share of  the fish is handed to her, and she despatches it with every mark of  extreme satisfaction. Then, having tasted a little of every dish, she  winds up her meal by drinking one-third of a glassful of water.    If we happen to have guests at dinner, Eponine does not need to have  seen them enter to be aware that there is to be company. She simply  looks at her place, and if she sees a knife, fork, and spoon laid there,  she makes off at once and perches on the piano stool, her usual place of  refuge in such cases. Those who deny reasoning powers to animals may  explain this fact, so simple apparently, yet so suggestive, as best they  may. That judicious and observant cat of mine deduces from the presence  by her plate of utensils which man alone understands how to use that she  must give up her position for that day to a guest, and she forthwith  does so. Never once has she made a mistake. Only, when she is well  acquainted with the particular guest, she will climb upon his knee and  seek, by her graceful ways and her caresses, to induce him to bestow  some tit-bit upon her.    But enough of this; I must not weary my readers, and stories of cats are  less attractive than stories about dogs. Yet I deem that I ought to tell  of the deaths of Enjolras and Gavroche. In the Latin Rudiments there is  a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30775"],[0,"Elements of Chemistry, (#4)"],[1,"of termination uniformly applied to the same  state of the different salts.    In short, we have advanced so far, that from the name alone may be  instantly found what the combustible substance is which enters into any  combination; whether that combustible substance be combined with the  acidifying principle, and in what proportion; what is the state of the  acid; with what basis it is united; whether the saturation be exact, or  whether the acid or the basis be in excess.    It may be easily supposed that it was not possible to attain all these  different objects without departing, in some instances, from established  custom, and adopting terms which at first sight will appear uncouth and  barbarous. But we considered that the ear is soon habituated to new  words, especially when they are connected with a general and rational  system. The names, besides, which were formerly employed, such as  _powder of algaroth_, _salt of alembroth_, _pompholix_, _phagadenic  water_, _turbith mineral_, _colcathar_, and many others, were neither  less barbarous nor less uncommon. It required a great deal of practice,  and no small degree of memory, to recollect the substances to which they  were applied, much more to recollect the genus of combination to which  they belonged. The names of _oil of tartar per deliquium_, _oil of  vitriol_, _butter of arsenic and of antimony_, _flowers of zinc_, &c.  were still more improper, because they suggested false ideas: For, in  the whole mineral kingdom, and particularly in the metallic class, there  exists no such thing as butters, oils, or flowers; and, in short, the  substances to which they give these fallacious names, are nothing less  than rank poisons.    When we published our essay on the nomenclature of chemistry, we were  reproached for having changed the language which was spoken by our  masters, which they distinguished by their authority, and handed down to  us. But those who reproach us on this account, have forgotten that it  was Bergman and Macquer themselves who urged us to make this  reformation. In a letter which the learned Professor of Upsal, M.  Bergman, wrote, a short time before he died, to M. de Morveau, he bids  him _spare no improper names; those who are learned, will always be  learned, and those who are ignorant will thus learn sooner_.    There is an objection to the work which I am going to present to the  public, which is perhaps better founded, that I have given no account of  the opinion of those who have gone before me; that I have stated only my  own opinion, without examining that of others. By this I have been  prevented from doing that justice to my associates, and more especially  to foreign chemists, which I wished to render them. But I beseech the  reader to consider, that, if I had filled an elementary work with a  multitude of quotations; if I had allowed myself to enter into long  dissertations on the history of the science, and the works of those who  have studied it, I must have lost sight of the true object I had in  view, and produced a work, the reading of which must have been extremely  tiresome to beginners. It is not to the history of the science, or of  the human mind, that we are to attend in an elementary treatise: Our  only aim ought to be ease and perspicuity, and with the utmost care to  keep every thing out of view which might draw aside the attention of the  student; it is a road which we should be continually rendering more  smooth, and from which we should endeavour to remove every obstacle  which can occasion delay. The sciences, from their own nature, present a  sufficient number of difficulties, though we add not those which are  foreign to them. But, besides this, chemists will easily perceive, that,  in the first part of my work, I make very little use of any experiments  but those which were made by myself: If at any time I have adopted,  without acknowledgment, the experiments or the opinions of M.  Berthollet, M. Fourcroy, M. de la Place, M. Monge, or, in general, of  any of those whose principles are the same with my own, it is owing to  this circumstance, that frequent intercourse, and the habit of  communicating our ideas, our observations, and our way of thinking to  each other, has established between us a sort of community of opinions,  in which it is often difficult for every one to know his own.    The remarks I have made on the order which I thought myself obliged to  follow in the arrangement of proofs and ideas, are to be applied only to  the first part of this work. It is the only one which contains the  general sum of the doctrine I have adopted, and to which I wished to  give a form completely elementary.    The second part is composed chiefly of tables of the nomenclature of the  neutral salts. To these I have only added general explanations, the  object of which was to point out the most simple processes for obtaining  the different kinds of known acids. This part contains nothing which I  can call my own, and presents only a very short abridgment of the  results of these processes, extracted from the works of different  authors.    In the third part, I have given a description, in detail, of all the  operations connected with modern chemistry. I have long thought that a  work of this kind was much wanted, and I am convinced it will not be  without use. The method of performing experiments, and particularly  those of modern chemistry, is not so generally known as it ought to be;  and had I, in the different memoirs which I have presented to the  Academy, been more particular in the detail of the manipulations of my  experiments, it is probable I should have made myself better understood,  and the science might have made a more rapid progress. The order of the  different matters contained in this third part appeared to me to be  almost arbitrary; and the only one I have observed was to class  together, in each of the chapters of which it is composed, those  operations which are most connected with one another. I need hardly  mention that this part could not be borrowed from any other work, and  that, in the principal articles it contains, I could not derive  assistance from any thing but the experiments which I have made myself.    I shall conclude this preface by transcribing, literally, some  observations of the Abbe de Condillac, which I think describe, with a  good deal of truth, the state of chemistry at a period not far distant  from our own. These observations were made on a different subject; but  they will not, on this account, have less force, if the application of  them be thought just.    'Instead of applying observation to the things we wished to know, we  have chosen rather to imagine them. Advancing from one ill founded  supposition to another, we have at last bewildered ourselves amidst a  multitude of errors. These errors becoming prejudices, are, of course,  adopted as principles, and we thus bewilder ourselves more and more. The  method, too, by which we conduct our reasonings is as absurd; we abuse  words which we do not understand, and call this the art of reasoning.  When matters have been brought this length, when errors have been thus  accumulated, there is but one remedy by which order can be restored to  the faculty of thinking; this is, to forget all that we have learned, to  trace back our ideas to their source, to follow the train in which they  rise, and, as my Lord Bacon says, to frame the human understanding anew.    'This remedy becomes the more difficult in proportion as we think  ourselves more learned. Might it not be thought that works which  treated of the sciences with the utmost perspicuity, with great  precision and order, must be understood by every body? The fact is,  those who have never studied any thing will understand them better than  those who have studied a great deal, and especially than those who have  written a great deal.'    At the end of the fifth chapter, the Abbe de Condillac adds: 'But, after  all, the sciences have made progress, because philosophers have applied  themselves with more attention to observe, and have communicated to  their language that precision and accuracy which they have employed in  their observations: In correcting their language they reason better.'
