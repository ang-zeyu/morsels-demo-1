The  whole earth lay hushed in profound peace. All lands lay freely open to  the message of mercy and love which He came to announce. Nor was the  social and moral condition of the world at large, at the birth of  Christ, less fitting for His advent than the political. The prize of  universal power struggled for through sixty years of plots and  desolating civil wars, had been won at last by Augustus. Sulla and  Marius, Pompey and Caesar, had led their legions against each other,  alike in Italy and the provinces, and had drenched the earth with  blood. Augustus himself had reached the throne only after thirteen  years of war, which involved regions wide apart. The world was  exhausted by the prolonged agony of such a strife; it sighed for  repose.\" (Cunningham Geikie, \"The Life and Works of Christ,\" New York,  1894; vol. 1, p. 25.)    \"The Roman empire, at the birth of Christ, was less agitated by wars  and turmoils than it had been for many years before. For though I  cannot assent to the opinion of those who, following the account of  Orosius, maintain that the temple of Janus was then shut, and that  wars and discords absolutely ceased throughout the world, yet it is  certain that the period in which our Savior descended upon earth may  be justly styled the 'pacific age,' if we compare it with the  preceding times. And indeed the tranquillity that then reigned was  necessary to enable the ministers of Christ to execute with success  their sublime commission to the human race.\" (Mosheim, \"Ecclesiastical  History,\" Cent. I, Part I; ch. 1:4).    2. _Paganism at the Beginning of the Christian Era_. \"Every nation  then had its respective gods, over which presided one more excellent  than the rest; yet in such a manner that this supreme deity was  himself controlled by the rigid empire of the fates, or what the  philosophers called 'external necessity.' The gods of the east were  different from those of the Gauls, the Germans, and the other northern  nations. The Grecian divinities differed widely from those of the  Egyptians, who deified plants, animals, and a great variety of the  productions both of nature and art. Each people also had their own  particular manner of worshipping and appeasing their respective  deities, entirely different from the sacred rites of other countries.  * * * One thing, indeed, which at first sight appears very remarkable,  is, that this variety of religions and of gods neither produced wars  nor dissensions among the different nations, the Egyptians excepted.  Nor is it perhaps necessary to except even them, since their wars  undertaken for their gods cannot be looked upon with propriety as  wholly of a religious nature. Each nation suffered its neighbors to  follow their own method of worship, to adore their own gods, to enjoy  their own rites and ceremonies, and discovered no sort of displeasure  at their diversity of sentiments in religious matters. There is,  however, little wonderful in this spirit of mutual toleration, when we  consider that they all looked upon the world as one great empire,  divided into various provinces, over every one of which a certain  order of divinities presided; and that therefore none could behold  with contempt the gods of other nations, or force strangers to pay  homage to theirs. The Romans exercised this toleration, in the amplest  manner. For, though they would not allow any changes to be made in the  religions that were publicly professed in the empire, nor any new form  of worship to be openly introduced, yet they granted to their citizens  a full liberty of observing in private the sacred rites of other  nations, and of honoring foreign deities (whose worship contained  nothing inconsistent with the interests and laws of the republic) with  feasts, temples, consecrated groves and such like testimonies of  homage and respect.\" (Mosheim, \"Eccl. Hist.,\" Cent. I, Part I; ch.  1:7-8.)    3. _Rapid Growth of the Church_. Eusebius, who wrote in the early part  of the fourth century, speaking of the first decade after the Savior's  ascension, says:    \"Thus, then, under a celestial influence, and co-operation, the  doctrine of the Savior, like the rays of the sun, quickly irradiated  the whole world. Presently, in accordance with divine prophecy, the  sound of His inspired evangelists and apostles had gone throughout all  the earth, and their words to the ends of the world. Throughout every  city and village, like a replenished barn floor, churches were rapidly  abounding and filled with members from every people. Those who, in  consequence of the delusions that had descended to them from their  ancestors, had been fettered by the ancient disease of idolatrous  superstition, were now liberated by the power of Christ, through the  teachings and miracles of His messengers.\" (Eusebius, \"Ecclesiastical  History,\" Book I, ch. 3.)    4. _Divine Instrumentality in the Apostolic Ministry_. \"When we  consider the rapid progress of Christianity among the Gentile nations,  and the poor and feeble instruments by which this great and amazing  event was immediately effected, we naturally have recourse to an  omnipotent and invisible hand, as its true and proper cause. For,  unless we suppose here a divine interposition, how was it possible  that men, destitute of all human aid, without credit or riches,  learning, or eloquence, could, in so short a time, persuade a  considerable part of mankind to abandon the religion of their  ancestors? How was it possible, that an handful of apostles, who, as  fishermen and publicans, must have been contemned by their own nation,  and as Jews must have been odious to all others, could engage the  learned and mighty, as well as the simple and those of low degree, to  forsake their favorite prejudices, and to embrace a new religion which  was an enemy to their corrupt passions? And, indeed, there were  undoubted marks of a celestial power perpetually attending their  ministry. Their very language, an incredible energy, an amazing power  of sending light into the understanding and conviction into the  heart.\" (Mosheim, \"Ecclesiastical History,\" Cent. I, Part 1, ch. 4:8.)    5. _Nephites and Lamanites_. The progenitors of the Nephite nation  \"were led from Jerusalem 600 B. C., by Lehi, a Jewish prophet of the  tribe of Manasseh. His immediate family, at the time of their  departure from Jerusalem, comprised his wife Sariah, and their sons  Laman, Lemuel, Sam, and Nephi; at a later stage of the history,  daughters are mentioned, but whether any of these were born before the  family exodus we are not told. Beside his own family, the colony of  Lehi included Zoram and Ishmael, the latter an Israelite of the tribe  of Ephraim. Ishmael, with his family, joined Lehi in the wilderness;  and his descendants were numbered with the nation of whom we are  speaking. The company journeyed somewhat east of south, keeping near  the borders of the Red Sea; then changing their course to the  eastward, crossed the peninsula of Arabia; and there, on the shores of  the Arabian Sea, built and provisioned a vessel in which they  committed themselves to Divine care upon the waters. Their voyage  carried them eastward across the Indian Ocean, then over the south  Pacific Ocean to the western coast of South America, whereon they  landed (590 B. C.) * * * The people established themselves on what to  them was the land of promise; many children were born, and in the  course of a few generations a numerous posterity held possession of  the land. After the death of Lehi, a division occurred, some of the  people accepting as their leader Nephi, who had been duly appointed to  the prophetic office; while the rest proclaimed Laman, the eldest of  Lehi's sons, as their chief. Henceforth the divided people were known  as Nephites and Lamanites respectively. At times they observed toward  each other fairly friendly relations; but generally they were opposed,  the Lamanites manifesting implacable hatred and hostility toward their  Nephite kindred. The Nephites advanced in the arts of civilization,  built large cities, and established prosperous commonwealths; yet they  often fell into transgression; and the Lord chastened them by making  their foes victorious. They spread northward, occupying the northern  part of South America; then, crossing the Isthmus, they extended their  domain over the southern, central, and eastern portions of what is now  the United States of America. The Lamanites, while increasing in  numbers, fell under the curse of darkness; they became dark in skin  and benighted in spirit, forgot the God of their fathers, lived a wild  nomadic life, and degenerated into the fallen state in which the  American Indians,--their lineal descendants,--were found by those who  re-discovered the western continent in later times.\" (The Author,  \"Articles of Faith,\" Lect. 14:7, 8.)          CHAPTER II.    **The Apostasy Predicted**.      1. In proceeding with our present inquiry we accept as demonstrated  facts the establishment of the Church of Christ under the Savior's  personal administration and the rapid growth of the Church in the  early period of the apostolic ministry.    2. A question of the utmost importance is: Has the Church of Christ,  thus authoritatively established, maintained an organized existence  upon the earth from the apostolic age to the present? Other questions  are suggested by the first. If the Church has continued as an earthly  organization, where lies the proof or evidence of legitimate  succession in priestly authority, and which among the multitude of  contending sects or churches of the present day is the actual  possessor of the holy priesthood originally committed to the Church by  the Christ, its founder?    3. Again, have the spiritual gifts and graces by "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35534"],[0,"How to be Happy Though Married: Being a Handbook to Marriage (#4)"],[1,"thoughts do end  with themselves, and account future times impertinences. Nay, there are  some other that account wife and children but as bills of charges. Nay  more, there are some foolish, rich, covetous men that take a pride in  having no children because they may be thought so much the richer. For  perhaps they have heard some talk: 'Such an one is a great rich man;'  and another except to it: 'Yea, but he hath a great charge of children,'  as if it were an abatement to his riches. But the most ordinary cause  of a single life is liberty, especially in certain self-pleasing and  humorous minds, which are so sensible of every restraint, as they will  go near to think their girdles and garters to be bonds and shackles.  Unmarried men are best friends, best masters, best servants, but not  always best subjects, for they are light to run away, and almost all  fugitives are of that condition. A single life doth well with church  men, for charity will hardly water the ground where it must first fill a  pool.\"    After all, these enumerations of the comparative advantages of marriage  and celibacy are of little use, for a single glance of a pair of bright  eyes will cause antimatrimonial arguments to go down like ninepins. The  greatest misogamists have been most severely wounded when least  expecting it by the darts of Cupid. Such a mishap, according to the  anatomist of melancholy already quoted, had \"Stratocles the physician,  that blear-eyed old man. He was a severe woman's-hater all his life, a  bitter persecutor of the whole sex; he foreswore them all still, and  mocked them wheresoever he came in such vile terms, that if thou hadst  heard him thou wouldst have loathed thine own mother and sisters for his  word's sake. Yet this old doting fool was taken at last with that  celestial and divine look of Myrilla, the daughter of Anticles the  gardener, that smirking wench, that he shaved off his bushy beard,  painted his face, curled his hair, wore a laurel crown to cover his bald  pate, and for her love besides was ready to run mad.\"    If it be true that \"nothing is certain but death and taxes,\" we must not  seek for mathematical demonstration that the road we propose to travel  on is the right one when we come to crossroads in life. A certain amount  of probability ought to make us take either one or the other, for not to  resolve is to resolve. In reference to such questions as marriage  _versus_ celibacy, the choice of a wife, the choice of a profession, and  many others, there must be a certain venture of faith, and in this  unintelligible world there is a rashness which is not always folly.    There are, of course, many persons who, if they married, would be guilty  of great imprudence, not to say of downright crime. When, however, two  _lovers_--we emphasise the word--have sufficient means, are of a  suitable age, and are conscious of no moral, intellectual, or physical  impediment, let them marry. It is the advice of some very wise men.  Benjamin Franklin wrote to a young friend upon his marriage: \"I am glad  you are married, and congratulate you most cordially upon it. You are  now in the way of becoming a useful citizen, and you have escaped the  unnatural state of celibacy for life--the fate of many here who never  intended it, but who, having too long postponed the change of their  condition, find at length that it is too late to think of it, and so  live all their lives in a situation that greatly lessens a man's value.  An old volume of a set of books bears not the value of its proportion to  the set. What think you of the odd half of a pair of scissors? It can't  well cut anything--it may possibly serve to scrape a trencher!\"    Dr. Johnson says: \"Marriage is the best state for man in general; and  every man is a worse man in proportion as he is unfit for the married  state.\" Of marriage Luther observed: \"The utmost blessing that God can  confer on a man is the possession of a good and pious wife, with whom he  may live in peace and tranquillity, to whom he may confide his whole  possessions, even his life and welfare.\" And again he said: \"To rise  betimes and to marry young are what no man ever repents of doing.\"  Shakespeare would not \"admit impediments to the marriage of true minds.\"    The cares and troubles of married life are many, but are those of single  life few? The bachelor has no one on whom in all cases he can rely. As a  rule his expenses are as great as those of a married man, his life less  useful, and certainly it is less cheerful. \"What a life to lead!\"  exclaims Cobbett. \"No one to talk to without going from home, or without  getting some one to come to you; no friend to sit and talk to, pleasant  evenings to pass! Nobody to share with you your sorrows or your  pleasures; no soul having a common interest with you; all around you  taking care of themselves and no care of you! Then as to gratifications,  from which you will hardly abstain altogether--are they generally of  little expense? and are they attended with no trouble, no vexation, no  disappointment, no _jealousy_ even? and are they never followed by shame  and remorse? To me no being in this world appears so wretched as an _old  bachelor_. Those circumstances, those changes in his person and in his  mind, which in the husband increase rather than diminish the attentions  to him, produce all the want of feeling attendant on disgust; and he  beholds in the conduct of the mercenary crowd that surround him little  besides an eager desire to profit from that event the approach of which  nature makes a subject of sorrow with him.\"    And yet it would be very wrong to hasten young men in this matter, for  however miserable an old bachelor may be, he is far more happy than  either a bad husband or the husband of a bad wife. What is one man's  meat may be another man's poison. To some persons we might say, \"If you  marry you do well, but if you marry not you do better.\" In the case of  others marriage may have decidedly the advantage. Like most other things  marriage is good or bad according to the use or abuse we make of it. The  applause that is usually given to persons on entering the matrimonial  stage is, to say the least, premature. Let us wait to see how they will  play their parts.    And here we must protest against the foolish and cowardly ridicule that  is sometimes bestowed upon elderly men and women who, using the liberty  of a free country, have abstained from marrying. Certainly some of them  could give reasons for spending their lives outside the temple of Hymen  that are far more honourable than the motives which induced their  foolish detractors to rush in. Some have never found their other selves,  or circumstances prevented the junction of these selves. And which is  more honourable--a life of loneliness or a loveless marriage? There are  others who have laid down their hopes of wedded bliss for the sake of  accomplishing some good work, or for the sake of a father, mother,  sister, or brother. In such cases celibacy is an honourable and may be a  praiseworthy state.    To make \"old maid\" a term of reproach has mischievous results, and  causes many an ill-assorted marriage. Girls have been hurried into  marriage by the dread of being so stigmatized who have repented the step  to their dying day. The sacredness of marriage and the serious  responsibilities it brings are either ignored altogether or but lightly  considered when marriage is represented as the only profession for  women. There is no truth in Brigham Young's doctrine that only a woman  _sealed_ to a man in marriage can possibly be saved.    Let mothers teach their daughters that although a well-assorted marriage  based upon mutual love and esteem may be the happiest calling for a  woman, yet that marriage brings its peculiar trials as well as special  joys, and that it is quite possible for a woman to be both useful and  happy, although youth be fled, and the crowning joys of life--wife and  motherhood--have passed her by or been voluntarily surrendered.    But this fact that celibacy has many consolations need not prevent the  conclusion that as a rule married life is to be preferred.    \"Jeanie,\" said an old Cameronian to his daughter, who was asking his  permission to marry--\"Jeanie, it's a very solemn thing to get married.\"    \"I ken that, father,\" said the sensible lassie, \"but it's a great deal  solemner to be single.\"    Marriages are made in heaven: matrimony in itself is good, but there are  fools who turn every blessing into a curse, like the man who said, \"This  is a good rope, I'll hang myself with it.\"          CHAPTER III.    MARRIAGE-MADE MEN.      \"A wife's a man's best peace, who, till he marries,    Wants making up....    She is the good man's paradise, and the bad's    First step to heaven.\"--_Shirley._      \"Th' ever womanly    Draweth us onward!\"--_Goethe._                          \"This is well,    To have a dame indoors, that trims us up,    And keeps us tight.\"--_Tennyson._      If there be any _man_--women are seldom anti-matrimonial bigots--who  seriously doubts that the _pros_ in favour of marriage more than  counterbalance the _cons_, we commend to his consideration a few  historical instances in which men have been made men in the highest  sense of the word by marriage.    We do not endorse the exaggerated statement of Richter that \"no man can  live piously or die righteously without a wife,\" but we think that the  chances of his doing so are considerably lessened. It is not good for a  man to live alone with his evil thoughts. The checks and active duties  of marriage are the best antidote, not only to an impure life, but to  the dreaming and droning of a useless and purposeless one.    Certainly there are some men and women who without wives or husbands are  marriage-made in the sense of having their love and powers drawn out by  interesting work. They are married to some art or utility, or instead of"]]]
