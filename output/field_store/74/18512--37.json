Instead of building a brand-new nest, on a hitherto unoccupied boulder,  the Mason-bee of the Walls is always glad to make use of the old nests  which have lasted through the year without suffering any damage worth  mentioning. The mortar dome has remained very much what it was at the  beginning, thanks to the solidity of the masonry, only it is perforated  with a number of round holes, corresponding with the chambers, the cells  inhabited by past generations of larvae. Dwellings such as these, which  need only a little repair to put them in good condition, save a great  deal of time and trouble; and the Mason-bees look out for them and do  not decide to build new nests except when the old ones are wanting.    From one and the same dome there issue several inhabitants, brothers and  sisters, ruddy males and black females, all the offspring of the same  Bee. The males lead a careless existence, know nothing of work and  do not return to the clay houses except for a brief moment to woo the  ladies; nor do they reck of the deserted cabin. What they want is the  nectar in the flower-cups, not mortar to mix between their mandibles.  There remain the young mothers, who alone are charged with the future  of the family. To which of them will the inheritance of the old nest  revert? As sisters, they have equal rights to it: so our code would  decide, since the day when it shook itself free of the old savage  right of primogeniture. But the Mason-bees have not yet got beyond the  primitive basis of property, the right of the first occupant.    When, therefore, the laying-time is at hand, the Bee takes possession of  the first vacant nest that suits her and settles there; and woe to any  sister or neighbour who shall henceforth dare to contest her ownership.  Hot pursuits and fierce blows will soon put the newcomer to flight. Of  the various cells that yawn like so many wells around the dome, only one  is needed at the moment; but the Bee rightly calculates that the others  will be useful presently for the other eggs; and she watches them all  with jealous vigilance to drive away possible visitors. Indeed I do not  remember ever seeing two Masons working on the same pebble.    The task is now very simple. The Bee examines the old cell to see what  parts require repairing. She tears off the strips of cocoon hanging from  the walls, removes the fragments of clay that fell from the ceiling when  pierced by the last inhabitant to make her exit, gives a coat of mortar  to the dilapidated parts, mends the opening a little; and that is all.  Next come the storing, the laying of the eggs and the closing of the  chamber. When all the cells, one after the other, are thus furnished,  the outer cover, the mortar dome, receives a few repairs if it needs  them; and the thing is done.    The Sicilian Mason-bee prefers company to a solitary life and  establishes herself in her hundreds, very often in many thousands, under  the tiles of a shed or the edge of a roof. These do not constitute a  true society, with common interests to which all attend, but a mere  gathering, where each works for herself and is not concerned with the  rest, in short, a throng of workers recalling the swarm of a hive only  by their numbers and their eagerness. The mortar employed is the same as  that of the Mason-bee of the Walls, equally unyielding and waterproof,  but thinner and without pebbles. The old nests are used first. Every  free chamber is repaired, stocked and sealed up. But the old cells are  far from sufficient for the population, which increases rapidly from  year to year. Then, on the surface of the nest, whose chambers are  hidden under the old general mortar covering, new cells are built,  as the needs of the laying-time call for them. They are placed  horizontally, or nearly so, side by side, with no attempt at orderly  arrangement. Each architect has plenty of elbow-room and builds as and  where she pleases, on the one condition that she does not hamper her  neighbours' work; otherwise she can look out for rough handling from the  parties interested. The cells, therefore, accumulate at random in  this workyard where there is no organization. Their shape is that of a  thimble divided down the middle; and their walls are completed either by  the adjoining cells or by the surface of the old nest. Outside, they are  rough and display successive layers of knotted cords corresponding with  the different courses of mortar. Inside, the walls are flat without  being smooth; later on, the grub's cocoon will make up for any lack of  polish.    Each cell, as built, is stocked and walled up immediately, as we have  seen with the Mason-bee of the Walls. This work goes on throughout the  best part of May. All the eggs are laid at last; and then the Bees,  without drawing distinctions between what does and what does not belong  to them, set to work in common on a general protection for the colony.  This is a thick coat of mortar, which fills up the gaps and covers all  the cells. In the end, the common nest presents the appearance of a wide  expanse of dry mud, with very irregular protuberances, thicker in the  middle, the original nucleus of the establishment, thinner at the edges,  where as yet there are only newly built cells, and varying greatly in  dimensions according to the number of workers and therefore to the age  of the nest first founded. Some of these nests are hardly larger than  one's hand, while others occupy the greater part of the projecting edge  of a roof and are measured by square yards.    When working alone, which is not unusual, on the shutter of a disused  window, on a stone, or on a twig in some hedge, the Sicilian Chalicodoma  behaves in just the same way. For instance, should she settle on a twig,  the Bee begins by solidly cementing the base of her cell to the slight  foundation. Next, the building rises, taking the form of a little  upright turret. This first cell, when victualled and sealed, is followed  by another, having as its support, in addition to the twig, the cells  already built. From six to ten chambers are thus grouped side by side.  Lastly, one coat of mortar covers everything, including the twig itself,  which provides a firm mainstay for the whole.        CHAPTER 2. EXPERIMENTS.    As the nests of the Mason-bee of the Walls are erected on small-sized  pebbles, which can be easily carried wherever you like and moved about  from one place to another, without disturbing either the work of  the builder or the repose of the occupants of the cells, they lend  themselves readily to practical experiment, the only method that can  throw a little light on the nature of instinct. To study the insect's  mental faculties to any purpose, it is not enough for the observer to be  able to profit by some happy combination of circumstances: he must know  how to produce other combinations, vary them as much as possible and  test them by substitution and interchange. Lastly, to provide science  with a solid basis of facts, he must experiment. In this way, the  evidence of formal records will one day dispel the fantastic legends  with which our books are crowded: the Sacred Beetle (A Dung-beetle who  rolls the manure of cattle into balls for his own consumption and that  of his young. Cf. \"Insect Life\", by J.H. Fabre, translated by the author  of \"Mademoiselle Mori\": chapters 1 and 2; and \"The Life and Love of the  Insect\", by J. Henri Fabre, translated by Alexander Teixeira de Mattos:  chapters 1 to 4.--Translator's Note.) calling on his comrades to lend a  helping hand in dragging his pellet out of a rut; the Sphex (A species  of Hunting Wasp. Cf. \"Insect Life\": chapters 6 to 12.--Translator's  Note.) cutting up her Fly so as to be able to carry him despite  the obstacle of the wind; and all the other fallacies which are the  stock-in-trade of those who wish to see in the animal world what is not  really there. In this way, again, materials will be prepared which  will one day be worked up by the hand of a master and consign hasty and  unfounded theories to oblivion.    Reaumur, as a rule, confines himself to stating facts as he sees them  in the normal course of events and does not try to probe deeper into the  insect's ingenuity by means of artificially produced conditions. In his  time, everything had yet to be done; and the harvest was so great that  the illustrious harvester went straight to what was most urgent, the  gathering of the crop, and left his successors to examine the grain and  the ear in detail. Nevertheless, in connection with the Chalicodoma of  the Walls, he mentions an experiment made by his friend, Duhamel. (Henri  Louis Duhamel du Monceau (1700-1781), a distinguished writer on botany  and agriculture.--Translator's Note.) He tells us how a Mason-bee's nest  was enclosed in a glass funnel, the mouth of which was covered merely  with a bit of gauze. From it there issued three males, who, after  vanquishing mortar as hard as stone, either never thought of piercing  the flimsy gauze or else deemed the work beyond their strength. The  three Bees died under the funnel. Reaumur adds that insects generally  know only how to do what they have to do in the ordinary course of  nature.    The experiment does not satisfy me, for two reasons: first, to ask  workers equipped with tools for cutting clay as hard as granite to cut  a piece of gauze does not strike me as a happy inspiration; you  cannot expect a navvy's pick-axe to do the same work as a dressmaker's  scissors. Secondly, the transparent glass prison seems to me ill-chosen.  As soon as the insect has made a passage through the thickness of its  earthen dome, it finds itself in broad daylight; and to it daylight  means the final deliverance, means liberty. It strikes against an  invisible obstacle, the glass; and to it glass is nothing at all and yet  an obstruction. On the far side, it sees free space, bathed in sunshine.

Yea, and that upon the eve of battle and the  dawn of thy departure to the stricken field!\"    \"O Wood-Sun,\" he said \"thou art the treasure of life that I found when I  was young, and the love of life that I hold, now that my beard is  grizzling.  Since when did I fear thee, Wood-Sun?  Did I fear thee when  first I saw thee, and we stood amidst the hazelled field, we twain living  amongst the slain?  But my sword was red with the blood of the foe, and  my raiment with mine own blood; and I was a-weary with the day's work,  and sick with many strokes, and methought I was fainting into death.  And  there thou wert before me, full of life and ruddy and smiling both lips  and eyes; thy raiment clean and clear, thine hands stained with blood:  then didst thou take me by my bloody and weary hand, and didst kiss my  lips grown ashen pale, and thou saidst 'Come with me.'  And I strove to  go, and might not; so many and sore were my hurts.  Then amidst my  sickness and my weariness was I merry; for I said to myself, This is the  death of the warrior, and it is exceeding sweet.  What meaneth it?  Folk  said of me; he is over young to meet the foeman; yet am I not over young  to die?\"    Therewith he laughed out amid the wild-wood, and his speech became song,  and he said:       \"We wrought in the ring of the hazels, and the wine of war we drank:     From the tide when the sun stood highest to the hour wherein she sank:     And three kings came against me, the mightiest of the Huns,     The evil-eyed in battle, the swift-foot wily ones;     And they gnashed their teeth against me, and they gnawed on the shield-     rims there,     On that afternoon of summer, in the high-tide of the year.     Keen-eyed I gazed about me, and I saw the clouds draw up     Till the heavens were dark as the hollow of a wine-stained iron cup,     And the wild-deer lay unfeeding on the grass of the forest glades,     And all earth was scared with the thunder above our clashing blades.       \"Then sank a King before me, and on fell the other twain,     And I tossed up the reddened sword-blade in the gathered rush of the     rain     And the blood and the water blended, and fragrant grew the earth.       \"There long I turned and twisted within the battle-girth     Before those bears of onset: while out from the grey world streamed     The broad red lash of the lightening and in our byrnies gleamed.     And long I leapt and laboured in that garland of the fight     'Mid the blue blades and the lightening; but ere the sky grew light     The second of the Hun-kings on the rain-drenched daisies lay;     And we twain with the battle blinded a little while made stay,     And leaning on our sword-hilts each on the other gazed.       \"Then the rain grew less, and one corner of the veil of clouds was     raised,     And as from the broidered covering gleams out the shoulder white     Of the bed-mate of the warrior when on his wedding night     He layeth his hand to the linen; so, down there in the west     Gleamed out the naked heaven: but the wrath rose up in my breast,     And the sword in my hand rose with it, and I leaped and hewed at the     Hun;     And from him too flared the war-flame, and the blades danced bright in     the sun     Come back to the earth for a little before the ending of day.       \"There then with all that was in him did the Hun play out the play,     Till he fell, and left me tottering, and I turned my feet to wend     To the place of the mound of the mighty, the gate of the way without     end.     And there thou wert.  How was it, thou Chooser of the Slain,     Did I die in thine arms, and thereafter did thy mouth-kiss wake me     again?\"    Ere the last sound of his voice was done she turned and kissed him; and  then she said; \"Never hadst thou a fear and thine heart is full of  hardihood.\"    Then he said:       \"'Tis the hardy heart, beloved, that keepeth me alive,     As the king-leek in the garden by the rain and the sun doth thrive,     So I thrive by the praise of the people; it is blent with my drink and     my meat;     As I slumber in the night-tide it laps me soft and sweet;     And through the chamber window when I waken in the morn     With the wind of the sun's arising from the meadow is it borne     And biddeth me remember that yet I live on earth:     Then I rise and my might is with me, and fills my heart with mirth,     As I think of the praise of the people; and all this joy I win     By the deeds that my heart commandeth and the hope that lieth     therein.\"    \"Yea,\" she said, \"but day runneth ever on the heels of day, and there are  many and many days; and betwixt them do they carry eld.\"    \"Yet art thou no older than in days bygone,\" said he.  \"Is it so, O  Daughter of the Gods, that thou wert never born, but wert from before the  framing of the mountains, from the beginning of all things?\"    But she said:       \"Nay, nay; I began, I was born; although it may be indeed     That not on the hills of the earth I sprang from the godhead's seed.     And e'en as my birth and my waxing shall be my waning and end.     But thou on many an errand, to many a field dost wend     Where the bow at adventure bended, or the fleeing dastard's spear     Oft lulleth the mirth of the mighty.  Now me thou dost not fear,     Yet fear with me, beloved, for the mighty Maid I fear;     And Doom is her name, and full often she maketh me afraid     And even now meseemeth on my life her hand is laid.\"    But he laughed and said:       \"In what land is she abiding?  Is she near or far away?     Will she draw up close beside me in the press of the battle play?     And if then I may not smite her 'midst the warriors of the field     With the pale blade of my fathers, will she bide the shove of my     shield?\"    But sadly she sang in answer:       \"In many a stead Doom dwelleth, nor sleepeth day nor night:     The rim of the bowl she kisseth, and beareth the chambering light     When the kings of men wend happy to the bride-bed from the board.     It is little to say that she wendeth the edge of the grinded sword,     When about the house half builded she hangeth many a day;     The ship from the strand she shoveth, and on his wonted way     By the mountain-hunter fareth where his foot ne'er failed before:     She is where the high bank crumbles at last on the river's shore:     The mower's scythe she whetteth; and lulleth the shepherd to sleep     Where the deadly ling-worm wakeneth in the desert of the sheep.     Now we that come of the God-kin of her redes for ourselves we wot,     But her will with the lives of men-folk and their ending know we not.     So therefore I bid thee not fear for thyself of Doom and her deed,     But for me: and I bid thee hearken to the helping of my need.     Or else--Art thou happy in life, or lusteth thou to die     In the flower of thy days, when thy glory and thy longing bloom on     high?\"    But Thiodolf answered her:       \"I have deemed, and long have I deemed that this is my second life,     That my first one waned with my wounding when thou cam'st to the ring     of strife.     For when in thine arms I wakened on the hazelled field of yore,     Meseemed I had newly arisen to a world I knew no more,     So much had all things brightened on that dewy dawn of day.     It was dark dull death that I looked for when my thought had died     away.     It was lovely life that I woke to; and from that day henceforth     My joy of the life of man-folk was manifolded of worth.     Far fairer the fields of the morning than I had known them erst,     And the acres where I wended, and the corn with its half-slaked     thirst;     And the noble Roof of the Wolfings, and the hawks that sat thereon;     And the bodies of my kindred whose deliverance I had won;     And the glimmering of the Hall-Sun in the dusky house of old;     And my name in the mouth of the maidens, and the praises of the bold,     As I sat in my battle-raiment, and the ruddy spear well steeled     Leaned 'gainst my side war-battered, and the wounds thine hand had     healed.     Yea, from that morn thenceforward has my life been good indeed,     The gain of to-day was goodly, and good to-morrow's need,     And good the whirl of the battle, and the broil I wielded there,     Till I fashioned the ordered onset, and the unhoped victory fair.     And good were the days thereafter of utter deedless rest     And the prattle of thy daughter, and her hands on my unmailed breast.     Ah good is the life thou hast given, the life that mine hands have     won.     And where shall be the ending till the world is all undone?     Here sit we twain together, and both we in Godhead clad,     We twain of the Wolfing kindred, and each of the other glad.\"    But she answered, and her face grew darker withal:       \"O mighty man and joyous, art thou of the Wolfing kin?     'Twas no evil deed when we mingled, nor lieth doom therein.     Thou lovely man, thou black-haired, thou shalt die and have done no     ill.     Fame-crowned are the deeds of thy doing, and the mouths of men they     fill.     Thou betterer of the Godfolk, enduring is thy fame:     Yet as a painted image of a dream is thy dreaded name.     Of an alien folk thou comest, that we twain might be one indeed.     Thou shalt die one day.  So hearken, to help me at my need.\"    His face grew troubled and he said: \"What is this word that I am no chief  of the Wolfings?\"    \"Nay,\" she said, \"but better than they.  Look thou on the face of our  daughter the Hall-Sun, thy daughter and mine: favoureth she at all of  me?\"    He laughed: \"Yea, whereas she is fair, but not otherwise.  This is a hard  saying, that I dwell among an alien kindred, and it wotteth not thereof.  "]]]
