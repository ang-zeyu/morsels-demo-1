Most trappers object to having the scent of skunks on their clothing  and for this reason I give the following methods for killing the  captured animals, so that they will not throw their scent. If the  trap is staked, or fastened to a clog, cut a club about four or five  feet long, and approach the animal very slowly, using care not to  make any quick movements. If the skunk raises its tail, as though it  intended to throw its scent, stop, and stand perfectly still until it  drops its tail again, when you can go nearer. In this way if you are  careful, you can easily get within striking distance, when you should  deliver a good smashing blow across the back. If the back is broken,  the muscles which operate the scent glands will be paralyzed, and  there will be absolutely no danger of getting a charge of perfumery.    Some trappers fasten their traps to the end of a ten or twelve foot  pole, and by approaching carefully, can pick up the pole, when by  going slowly, the skunk may be led to the nearest water where it may  be drowned. Lead the skunk into shallow water, gradually working it  into deeper, holding its head under until nearly drowned, then let it  have a little air,--just a breath, and push it under again, keeping  it there until its struggles cease. If the animal is caught by a  front foot, it may be carried to the water, as a skunk can seldom  throw its scent if lifted off the ground, and not allowed to touch  anything with the hind feet or tail.    Another method is to cut the animal's throat with a small, very  sharp, pointed knife blade, attached to the end of a ten foot jointed  pole. Approach the animal carefully and place the point of the knife  against the side of the animal's neck, just over the jugular vein.  Push steadily against the knife; as soon as the blood flows freely,  move away and allow the animal to die.    Perhaps the quickest method is to shoot the skunk in the center of  the back, with a 22 caliber rifle or pistol. This breaks the back  killing the animal almost instantly, and there will be no scent  whatever.    If the trap is fastened to a balance pole you can kill the animal by  a blow across the back. Never shoot them in the head, or stride the  head with a club, as they are certain to throw their scent if killed  in this way.    If the fur of the skunk has become scented, I use the following  method for removing the scent: Build a fire and throw an armful of  evergreen boughs on it so as to make a dense smoke. Hold the scented  animal in the smoke for about five minutes, using care to keep it  away from the fire or the heat will curl the hair. After the skunk is  skinned hang the skin in an airy place for a few days, when there  will be practically no smell left.    Before skinning or handling the skunk, rub your hands with some kind  of grease. After the animal is skinned, wash your hands well, using  soap and hot water; there will be no scent remaining on the hands.  Benzine or gasoline will also remove the scent from the hands or  clothing. Cider vinegar is also said to be good. If the clothing is  buried over night in damp ground, the scent will usually draw out.    The track of the skunk is peculiar and is not likely to be mistaken  for that of some other animal. Although a member of the weasel  family, it does not travel by a series of jumps as does the weasel,  mink, marten, etc., but maintains a steady walk, and the foot-prints  will be an even distance apart and spread considerably so as to make  a wide trail. The length of step is about five inches and the  footprints will measure from one to one and a half inches in length,  according to the size of the animal.      [Illustration: The Mink.]        CHAPTER III.    THE MINK.    The mink is a small carnivorous animal, belonging to the weasel  family. It is found throughout the United States and the greater part  of Canada and Alaska. A distinct species is also found in Europe and  Asia. In North America there appears to be several varieties, varying  considerably in size and color. A large, light-colored variety is  found in the country drained by the Mississippi River and its  branches, and also in the prairie country of Canada. This variety  sometimes reaches the weight of four pounds, or even more, and the  skin, when properly stretched, will sometimes measure thirty-six or  thirty-eight inches from tip to tip. A smaller and darker variety is  found in the Eastern States and the Eastern parts of Canada and Lake  Superior regions, and a still smaller and very dark colored mink is  found in Northern Maine and parts of New Brunswick. A small, light  colored variety is found on the Pacific coast.    The mink has a long, slender body, a small head, and rather short  legs. The tail is usually about eight inches long and is quite bushy.  The fur is thick, fine and glossy, and the color varies from a very  light brown to very dark. The usual color is dark brown, the fur on  the tail being darker than that on the body.    The mating season commences about the last week in February and ends  about the middle of March. The young are born in April, there being  from four to six in a litter.    The mink is not an amphibious animal, but it is found only along the  streams and watercourses, from which it obtains a large part of its  food. It is a great rambler, traveling long distances along the  streams and lakes, and always following the same route. When on these  trips it explores the drifts and log-jams, holes in the bank, hollow  logs, etc., which habit is taken advantage of by the trapper.    The fur of the mink is at its best during the months of November,  December and January, in the north; while in the extreme south, they  are only number one, during December and January. In February, the  fur commences to fade, and they are not worth so much. The dark  colored skins command the best prices.    The food of the mink consists of fish, frogs, birds, squirrels, mice,  rabbits, muskrats, etc., all of which are good for bait. They are  also very fond of poultry.    The traps most used for mink are the Nos. 1 and 1 1/2. The webbed jaw  and the double jaw traps are especially desirable for mink, as when  caught in these traps, they cannot escape by gnawing off the foot.    There are probably more methods used in trapping the mink than in  trapping any other animal. In localities where they take bait well,  the usual plan is to set the trap in the entrance to a natural or  artificial enclosure, on the bank of the stream, placing a bait on  the inside of the enclosure. The trap should be nested down, and  covered with some light material in keeping with the surroundings.  The trap may be fastened to a light clog or a balance pole, or if  very close to the water, to a sliding pole. The bait should be  strictly fresh. Some good scent may be used if desired. Hollow logs  and holes in drifts and under stumps make good places for sets. Some  trappers do not set in an enclosure, but hang the bait about eighteen  inches above the trap. I do not, however, consider this a  satisfactory method. When an artificial enclosure is used, it should  be roofed over with bark, or evergreen boughs to protect that trap  from the snow.    For fall trapping, many prefer to set traps in the water. The  following method is one of the best for a water set: find a steep  bank where the water is shallow, and runs smoothly and rapidly, make  a hole in the bank, on a level with the water, making the hole about  ten inches deep and about four inches in diameter. Put a piece of  fresh bait back in the hole, fastening with a small stick, and set  the trap in the water at the mouth of the hole. Stake the trap the  full length of the chain into the water and cover with mud or  water-soaked leaves.    Along the streams where little sand-bars lead out into the water  select a place on one of these bars, where the water is only an inch  or two in depth, set the trap under the water, close to the edge of  the stream. Fix a small fish on the point of the stick, out in the  stream a foot from the trap, pushing the stick down until the bait  rests partly under water. Stake the trap so that the catch will  drown. This is a very successful set and requires but little time and  trouble to make.    In some localities the mink do not take bait well, in which case,  blind sets--traps without bait must be depended upon. In the fall  while the water is still open, find a high bank where the water leads  off fairly deep, leaving only a very narrow strip of shallow water,  at the foot of the bank. Set the trap in the edge of the water and  stake full length of the chain into the stream. Place a couple of  water-soaked leaves on the trap, and drop a few pinches of mud on  them to hold them in place. The steep bank on one side and the deep  water on the other, will guide the mink into the trap. If, however,  the shallow water extends out some distance from the bank, take a  chunk of water-soaked wood, and stand it in the water, just beyond  the trap, leaving the top rest against the bank. This will leave only  a narrow passage over the trap, and you may be pretty sure of  catching your mink. A similar set should be made on the opposite side  of the stream, if conditions are favorable. This is a very good  method for use in the south.    After streams are frozen, a different plan must be adopted. In such  cases if you can find a jam or drift extending across the stream,  find an opening, leading through this drift, close to the bank, and  set the trap in this opening, covering with fine, drift dirt. In case  you cannot find a suitable passage, make one and stop up all other  holes. A little scent of the right kind may be used here to good  advantage.      [Illustration: Mink Set Under Log.

Coming toward her were some young men riding on their  ponies. She stood up and held her hands so that they could see her. They  wondered who she was, and when they were close by gazed at her closely.    \"A year ago we lost a young woman; if you are she, where have you been,\"  they asked.    \"I have been in the wolves' village. Do not harm them,\" she answered.    \"We will ride back and tell the people,\" they said. \"Tomorrow again at  noon, we shall meet you.\"    The young woman went back to the wolf village, and the next day went  again to a neighboring knoll, though to a different one. Soon she  saw the camp coming in a long line over the prairie. First were the  warriors, then the women and tents.    The young woman's father and mother were overjoyed to see her. But when  they came near her the young woman fainted, for she could not now bear  the smell of human kind. When she came to herself she said:    \"You must go on a buffalo hunt, my father and all the hunters. Tomorrow  you must come again, bringing with you the tongues and choice pieces of  the kill.\"    This he promised to do; and all the men of the camp mounted their ponies  and they had a great hunt. The next day they returned with their ponies  laden with the buffalo meat. The young woman bade them pile the meat in  a great heap between two hills which she pointed out to them. There was  so much meat that the tops of the two hills were bridged level between  by the meat pile. In the center of the pile the young woman planted a  pole with a red flag. She then began to howl like a wolf, loudly.    In a moment the earth seemed covered with wolves. They fell greedily on  the meat pile and in a short time had eaten the last scrap.    The young woman then joined her own people.    Her husband wanted her to come and live with him again. For a long time  she refused. However, at last they became reconciled.              THE RACCOON AND THE CRAWFISH    Sharp and cunning is the raccoon, say the Indians, by whom he is named  Spotted Face.    A crawfish one evening wandered along a river bank, looking for  something dead to feast upon. A raccoon was also out looking for  something to eat. He spied the crawfish and formed a plan to catch him.    He lay down on the bank and feigned to be dead. By and by the crawfish  came near by. \"Ho,\" he thought, \"here is a feast indeed; but is he  really dead. I will go near and pinch him with my claws and find out.\"    So he went near and pinched the raccoon on the nose and then on his soft  paws. The raccoon never moved. The crawfish then pinched him on the ribs  and tickled him so that the raccoon could hardly keep from laughing. The  crawfish at last left him. \"The raccoon is surely dead,\" he thought.  And he hurried back to the crawfish village and reported his find to the  chief.    All the villagers were called to go down to the feast. The chief bade  the warriors and young men to paint their faces and dress in their  gayest for a dance.    So they marched in a long line--first the warriors, with their weapons  in hand, then the women with their babies and children--to the place  where the raccoon lay. They formed a great circle about him and danced,  singing:    \"We shall have a great feast    \"On the spotted-faced beast, with soft smooth paws:    \"He is dead!    \"He is dead!    \"We shall dance!    \"We shall have a good time!    \"We shall feast on his flesh.\"    But as they danced, the raccoon suddenly sprang to his feet.    \"Who is that you say you are going to eat? He has a spotted face, has  he? He has soft, smooth paws, has he? I'll break your ugly backs. I'll  break your rough bones. I'll crunch your ugly, rough paws.\" And he  rushed among the crawfish, killing them by scores. The crawfish warriors  fought bravely and the women ran screaming, all to no purpose. They did  not feast on the raccoon; the raccoon feasted _on them!_              LEGEND OF STANDING ROCK    A Dakota had married an Arikara woman, and by her had one child. By and  by he took another wife. The first wife was jealous and pouted. When  time came for the village to break camp she refused to move from her  place on the tent floor. The tent was taken down but she sat on the  ground with her babe on her back The rest of the camp with her husband  went on.    At noon her husband halted the line. \"Go back to your sister-in-law,\"  he said to his two brothers. \"Tell her to come on and we will await you  here. But hasten, for I fear she may grow desperate and kill herself.\"    The two rode off and arrived at their former camping place in the  evening. The woman still sat on the ground. The elder spoke:    \"Sister-in-law, get up. We have come for you. The camp awaits you.\"    She did not answer, and he put out his hand and touched her head. She  had turned to stone!    The two brothers lashed their ponies and came back to camp. They told  their story, but were not believed. \"The woman has killed herself and my  brothers will not tell me,\" said the husband. However, the whole village  broke camp and came back to the place where they had left the woman.  Sure enough, she sat there still, a block of stone.    The Indians were greatly excited. They chose out a handsome pony, made  a new travois and placed the stone in the carrying net. Pony and travois  were both beautifully painted and decorated with streamers and colors.  The stone was thought _\"wakan\"_ (holy), and was given a place of honor  in the center of the camp. Whenever the camp moved the stone and travois  were taken along. Thus the stone woman was carried for years, and  finally brought to Standing Rock Agency, and now rests upon a brick  pedestal in front of the Agency office. From this stone Standing Rock  Agency derives its name.              STORY OF THE PEACE PIPE    Two young men were out strolling one night talking of love affairs. They  passed around a hill and came to a little ravine or coulee. Suddenly  they saw coming up from the ravine a beautiful woman. She was painted  and her dress was of the very finest material.    \"What a beautiful girl!\" said one of the young men. \"Already I love her.  I will steal her and make her my wife.\"    \"No,\" said the other. \"Don't harm her. She may be holy.\"    The young woman approached and held out a pipe which she first offered  to the sky, then to the earth and then advanced, holding it out in her  extended hands.    \"I know what you young men have been saying; one of you is good; the  other is wicked,\" she said.    She laid down the pipe on the ground and at once became a buffalo cow.  The cow pawed the ground, stuck her tail straight out behind her and  then lifted the pipe from the ground again in her hoofs; immediately she  became a young woman again.    \"I am come to give you this gift,\" she said. \"It is the peace pipe.  Hereafter all treaties and ceremonies shall be performed after smoking  it. It shall bring peaceful thoughts into your minds. You shall offer it  to the Great Mystery and to mother earth.\"    The two young men ran to the village and told what they had seen and  heard. All the village came out where the young woman was.    She repeated to them what she had already told the young men and added:    \"When you set free the ghost (the spirit of deceased persons) you must  have a white buffalo cow skin.\"    She gave the pipe to the medicine men of the village, turned again to a  buffalo cow and fled away to the land of buffaloes.              A BASHFUL COURTSHIP    A young man lived with his grandmother. He was a good hunter and wished  to marry. He knew a girl who was a good moccasin maker, but she belonged  to a great family. He wondered how he could win her.    One day she passed the tent on her way to get water at the river. His  grandmother was at work in the tepee with a pair of old worn-out sloppy  moccasins. The young man sprang to his feet. \"Quick, grandmother--let me  have those old sloppy moccasins you have on your feet!\" he cried.    \"My old moccasins, what do you want of them?\" cried the astonished  woman.    \"Never mind! Quick! I can't stop to talk,\" answered the grandson as he  caught up the old moccasins the old lady had doffed, and put them on. He  threw a robe over his shoulders, slipped through the door, and hastened  to the watering place. The girl had just arrived with her bucket.    \"Let me fill your bucket for you,\" said the young man.    \"Oh, no, I can do it.\"    \"Oh, let me, I can go in the mud. You surely don't want to soil your  moccasins,\" and taking the bucket he slipped in the mud, taking care  to push his sloppy old moccasins out so the girl could see them. She  giggled outright.    \"My, what old moccasins you have,\" she cried.    \"Yes, I have nobody to make me a new pair,\" he answered.    \"Why don't you get your grandmother to make you a new pair?\"    \"She's old and blind and can't make them any longer. That's why I want  you,\" he answered.    \"Oh, you're fooling me. You aren't speaking the truth.\"    \"Yes, I am. If you don't believe--come with me _now!_\"    The girl looked down; so did the youth. At last he said softly:    \"Well, which is it? Shall I take up your bucket, or will you go with  me?\"    And she answered, still more softly: \"I guess I'll go with you!\"    The girl's aunt came down to the river, wondering what kept her niece so  long. In the mud she found two pairs of moccasin tracks close together;  at the edge of the water stood an empty keg.              THE SIMPLETON'S WISDOM    There was a man and his wife who had one daughter. Mother and daughter  were deeply attached to one another, and when the latter died the mother  was disconsolate. She cut off her hair, cut gashes in her cheeks and sat  before the corpse with her robe drawn over her head, mourning for her  dead. Nor would she let them touch the body to take it to a burying  scaffold. She had a knife in her hand, and"]]]
