Green mass.    Having now given the principal reactions for the most important metals,  we will proceed to the examination of the alkali metals, the alkaline  earths, and some of the acid elements.      THE ALKALI METALS    17. ~Ammonium, NH_{4}.~--This hypothetical compound is commonly classed  among the alkali metals from its close resemblance to the members of  this group.    To detect the presence of this hypothetical metal, mix the assay with  about four parts of Na_{2}CO_{3}, place in an ignition tube, and apply  heat. The odor of the evolved gas will be recognized, and if a piece of  red litmus paper be moistened and held at the mouth of the tube, it will  be turned blue by the escaping ammonia gas.    We are not authorized to infer the pre-existence of ammonium, however,  from the appearance of this reaction, for the presence of nitrogenous  organic matter in the substance, which would be decomposed by this  treatment, would give rise to such a reaction.      18. ~Potassium.~--Potassium is recognized by the color which its salts  impart to the Bunsen flame. If a portion of a salt of potassium be held  on a platinum wire in the flame, it imparts a blue-violet tint which  rapidly disappears.      19. ~Sodium.~--Like potassium, this alkali metal is detected by the color  which its salts give to the flame.    If a sodium salt be held on the platinum wire in the flame, it imparts  an intense yellow color.    The extreme delicacy of this reaction has been mentioned elsewhere. The  value of this test is really lessened by its great delicacy, for it is  possible to detect minute quantities of sodium in almost all substances,  although it may not be in chemical combination. As an example, draw the  platinum wire between the fingers, and then place in flame, and note  presence of sodium.      20. ~Lithium, Li_{2}O.~--In the Bunsen flame on the platinum wire it  imparts a carmine-red tinge.    Hydrochloric acid on the sample augments the coloration.      THE ALKALINE EARTHS    21. ~Barium, BaO.~--In the Bunsen flame on the platinum wire it imparts an  apple-green coloration. This reaction is intensified by moistening the  sample with hydrochloric acid.      22. ~Calcium, CaO.~--In the Bunsen flame on the platinum wire it imparts  an orange-red color, which appears gray when seen through blue glass.    Hydrochloric acid on the sample makes the color more intense.      23. ~Strontium, SrO.~--In the Bunsen flame on the platinum wire it imparts  an intensely red color, which is increased by converting the substance  into the chloride.      THE ACID ELEMENTS    24. ~Borates.~--If the substance be finely powdered, moistened with  glycerine, and then placed on a platinum wire in the Bunsen flame, it  imparts a brilliant green color.    If turmeric paper be dipped into a solution of a borate, and then be  dried at 100 deg. C., it is turned to a peculiar red color. These two  reactions are extremely delicate.      25. ~Bromides.~--Bromides treated with microcosmic salt and oxide of  copper on platinum wire impart to the flame a greenish-blue color, the  edges being decidedly green.      26. ~Chlorides.~--Chlorides are treated in the same way as bromides. The  color imparted to the flame is azure-blue.    To discriminate between bromides and chlorides more clearly, the  substance is mixed with anhydrous potassium bisulphate and fused in an  ignition tube.    Bromine and sulphur dioxide are evolved (if the substance be a bromide),  the tube being filled with a yellow gas possessing the characteristic  odor of bromine.      27. ~Fluorides.~--A small portion of the substance in a finely powdered  condition is placed in one of the ignition tubes, a strip of moist  Brazil-wood paper is introduced into the open end, and heat is applied.  Hydrofluoric acid is evolved, and the red color of the paper is changed  into a straw-yellow.    Mica, containing only 0.75% of fluorine, shows the reaction clearly.      28. ~Iodides.~--Iodides are treated, as the bromides and chlorides, in a  bead of microcosmic salt with oxide of copper. The flame is colored  green.    Fused with potassium bisulphate in an ignition tube the violet vapors of  iodine are evolved, and thus iodides may be distinguished from chlorides  and bromides.      29. ~Nitrates.~--If a nitrate be heated upon charcoal before the Bp.,  violent deflagration occurs. If the substance containing the nitric  acid be mixed with a _very small_ quantity of finely powdered potassium  cyanide, the deflagration is accompanied with ignition and detonation.    If the substance be mixed in a dry condition with dry potassium  bisulphate, and is then heated in an ignition tube, red-brown nitrous  fumes are evolved. This reaction takes place if there is but a small  quantity of nitrate present.      30. ~Phosphates.~--Phosphates impart to the flame a bluish green color.  The color is made more intense by moistening the substance with  sulphuric acid, and then taking the paste so formed on the platinum wire  and placing it in the Bunsen flame.      31. ~Silicates.~--Silicates, when treated with microcosmic salt on a  platinum wire, suffer decomposition; the bases unite with the  phosphoric acid to form a transparent glass in which the silica may be  seen floating as a cloudy mass.    The bead must only be examined for silica while hot, since on cooling it  becomes opaque.      32. ~Sulphides.~--Many sulphides, when heated in an ignition tube,  volatilize and give a sublimate of sulphur in combination with the  metallic portion of the substance.    A very delicate test for sulphur in whatever combination it may be found  in a substance, and which may be performed with great ease, is to mix  the finely powdered assay with four parts, Na_{2}CO_{3}, and fuse in an  ignition tube. When thoroughly fused the tube is broken, and the fused  mass is placed on a bright silver coin, and a drop of water is added.  If the substance contains sulphur, a black spot will be observed on the  coin where the fused mass was placed.    Before going on to the next chapter, the student should assure himself  of his familiarity with the reactions just given, and he should practise  with various substances, the nature of which is unknown to him.          CHAPTER IV    BEHAVIOR OF SOME OF THE PRINCIPAL ORES BEFORE THE BLOWPIPE      For the sake of practice, and as a fitting introduction to  \"Determinative Mineralogy,\" this chapter is appended. It is not intended  to give a detailed account of the minerals, but rather to set before the  student the most marked characters, such as hardness, specific gravity,  color, lustre, etc.    To determine the hardness of a mineral, we try to scratch it with the  minerals forming an arbitrary \"scale of hardness,\" proceeding  successively from the softest to the hardest. When we say that a certain  mineral has hardness = 4, we mean that the mineral is scratched by 4 on  the scale, and that 4 on the scale is scratched by the mineral. The  scale of hardness chiefly in use is the Mohs-Breithaupt scale, which is  as follows:--        1. Talc, common laminated light green variety.        2. Gypsum, crystallized.        3. Calcareous spar, transparent variety.        4. Fluor spar, crystalline.        5. Apatite, transparent.        6. Orthoclase, white cleavable variety.        7. Quartz, transparent.        8. Topaz, transparent.        9. Sapphire, cleavable variety.        10. Diamond.    It seldom happens in determining the hardness of a mineral that its  hardness exactly conforms to that of some one member of the scale. In  such cases we generally estimate the hardness. For example, suppose a  mineral was harder than 4, but softer than 5, and that it was nearer 5  than 4, then we would call its hardness 4-3/4.    In order to preserve the scale some operators use a three-cornered file,  first cutting the mineral and then the scale until a number is found,  which is abraded to about the same depth as the mineral under  examination.    Since a set of minerals forming a scale of hardness is not always at  hand, the following scale given by Chapman is appended:--         1. Yields easily to the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32982"],[0,"Student's Hand-book of Mushrooms of America, Edible and Poisonous (#4)"],[1,"atellae_, purple, sometimes brownish      purple, dark purple, or dark brown; _Coprinarii_, black or nearly      so.    These shades are somewhat different from the colors of the mushrooms'  gills, so that, when it is of importance to determine exactly the color  of the spore in the identification of a species, we may without recourse  to the microscope cut off the stem of an adult plant on a level with the  gills and place the under surface of the cap upon a leaf of white paper  if a dark-spored species, and upon a sheet of black paper if the spores  are light. At the expiration of a few hours we will find, on lifting the  cap, a bed of the shed spores which will represent their exact shade.  These may be removed to a glass slide and their size and form determined  by means of the microscope.    In the present work Dr. M. C. Cooke's grouping of the spore series is  adopted.          ETYMOLOGY OF THE WORD \"MUSHROOM.\"      Various opinions have been offered as to the derivation of the word  \"mushroom.\" According to Hay, it probably had its origin in a  combination of the two Welsh words _maes_, a field, and _rhum_, a knob,  which by gradual corruption have become _mushroom_. Some writers on the  other hand regard it as a corruption of _mousseron_, a name specifically  applied by the French to those mushrooms which are found growing in  mossy places. But it seems to be of older usage than such a derivation  would imply, and therefore the first explanation seems the more likely  to be correct.    In England the term \"mushroom\" has been most commonly applied to the  \"meadow mushroom,\" that being the one best known; but English-speaking  mycologists now apply it generically very much as the French do the term  \"champignon,\" while the name \"champignon\" is restricted in England to  the Marasmius oreades, or \"Fairy Ring\" mushroom.    Berkeley says the French word \"champignon\" was originally scarcely of  wider signification than our word \"mushroom,\" though now classical in  the sense of fleshy fungi generally. The German word _Pilz_ (a  corruption of Boletus) is used to denote the softer kinds by some German  authors. Constant and Dufour, in their recently published Atlas des  Champignons, include types of a great variety of mushrooms.    Hay contends that the pernicious nick-name \"toad-stool\" has not the  derivation supposed, but that the first part of the word is the Saxon or  old English \"tod,\" meaning a bunch, cluster, or bush, the form of many  terrestrial fungi suggesting it. The second syllable, \"stool,\" is easily  supplied. \"The erroneous idea of connecting toads with these plants,\"  says Hay, \"seems to be due to Spenser, or to some poet, possibly, before  his time.\" Spenser speaks of the loathed paddocks, \"paddock\" then being  the name given in England to the frog, afterwards corrupted to \"paddic,\"  and once received, readily converted by the Scotch into \"puddick-stool.\"  It would seem, therefore, from the foregoing, that the term \"toad-stool\"  can have no proper relation to mushrooms, whether edible or poisonous.    The three mushrooms illustrated and described in this pamphlet, Plates  I, II, and III, are of the order Agaricini or gilled mushrooms. They are  well-defined types and of wide geographical distribution.          FOOD VALUE OF MUSHROOMS.      Rollrausch and Siegel, who claim to have made exhaustive investigations  into the food values of mushrooms, state that \"many species deserve to  be placed beside meat as sources of nitrogenous nutriment,\" and their  analysis, if correct, fully bears out the statement. They find in 100  parts of dried _Morchella esculenta_ 35.18 per cent. of protein; in  _Helvella esculenta_, 26.31 per cent. of protein, from 46 to 49 per  cent. of potassium salts and phosphoric acid, 2.3 per cent. of fatty  matter, and a considerable quantity of sugar. The _Boletus edulis_ they  represent as containing in 100 parts of the dried substance 22.82 per  cent. of protein. The nitrogenous values of different foods as compared  with the mushroom are stated as follows: \"Protein substances calculated  for 100 parts of bread, 8.03; of oatmeal, 9.74; of barley bread, 6.39;  of leguminous fruits, 27.05; of potatoes, 4.85; of mushrooms, 33.0.\"    According to Schlossberger and Depping, in 100 grams of dried mushrooms  they found the following proportions of nitrogenous substances:            -----------------------+--------            Varieties.           | Grains.                                 |          Chanterelles           |  3.22          Certain Russulas       |  4.25          Lactarius deliciosus   |  4.68          Boletus edulis         |  4.25          Meadow mushroom        |  7.26          -----------------------+--------    But all chemists are not agreed as to these proportions. For instance,  Lefort has found 3.51 grains of nitrogenous matter in the cap of  _Agaricus campestris_, 2.1 grains in the gills and only 0.34 of a grain  in the stem. Payen has found 4.68 grains in _Agaricus campestris_, 4.4  grains in the common Morel (_Morchella esculenta_), 9.96 grains in the  white truffle, and 8.76 grains in the black.    A much larger proportion of the various kinds of mushrooms are edible  than is generally supposed, but a prejudice has grown up concerning them  in this country which it will take some time to eradicate.  Notwithstanding the occurrence of occasional fatal accidents through the  inadvertent eating of poisonous species, fungi are largely consumed both  by savage and civilized man in all parts of the world, and while they  contribute so considerable a portion of the food product of the world we  may be sure their value will not be permanently overlooked in the United  States, especially when we consider our large accessions of population  from countries in which the mushroom is a familiar and much prized  edible. In Italy the value of the mushroom as an article of diet has  long been understood and appreciated. Pliny, Galen, and Dioscorides  mention various esculent species, notably varieties of the truffle, the  boletus and the puff-ball, and Vittadini writes enthusiastically of the  gastronomic qualities of a large number of species. Of late years large  quantities have been sold in the Italian markets. Quantities of  mushrooms are also consumed in Germany, Hungary, Russia, France, and  Austria.    Darwin speaks of Terra del Fuego as the only country where cryptogamic  plants form a staple article of food. A bright-yellow fungus allied to  _Bulgarin_ forms, with shellfish, the staple food of the Fuegians. In  England the common meadow mushroom _Agaricus campestris_ is quite well  known and used to a considerable extent among the people, but there is  not that general knowledge of and use of other species which obtains in  Continental Europe.    In the English-speaking countries much has been done by the Rev. M. J.  Berkeley, Dr. M. C. Cooke, Worthington G. Smith, Rev. John Stevenson,  Prof. Hay, Prof. Chas. H. Peck, Prof. W. J. Farlow, and others,  including the various mushroom clubs, to disseminate a more general  knowledge on this subject.    Late investigations show that nearly all the species common to the  countries of Continental Europe, and of Great Britain, are found in  different localities in the United States, and a number of species have  been found which have not been described in European works.    The geographical distribution of many species of the mushroom family is  very wide. We have had specimens of the _Morel_, for instance, sent to  us from California and Washington, on the Pacific coast, and as far  north as Maine, on the Atlantic, as well as from the southern and the  midwestern States, and the same is true of other species. The season of  their appearance varies somewhat according to the latitude and altitude  of place of growth. Mushrooms are rarely seen after the first heavy  frosts, although an exception is noted in this latitude in the species  Hypholoma sublatertium, which has been found growing under the snow, at  the roots of trees in sheltered woods. Frozen mushrooms of this and  closely allied species have revived when thawed, and proved quite  palatable when cooked.    At the present time only two species, Agaricus campester and Agaricus  arvensis, are cultivated in America. Some attempts have been made by an  amateur mushroom club in Ohio to cultivate the Morel, but the results  have not, so far, been reported. In the meantime, however, it is well to  utilize the wild mushrooms as fast as the collector can satisfactorily  identify them. The woods of all moist regions of this country abound  with edible varieties. Prof. Curtis, of North Carolina, gives a list of  over one hundred edible species found in that State alone, and nearly  all of these occur in our Northern States as well. It is not contended  that this list includes all the species which may be eaten, nor have all  of these equal value from a gastronomic point of view. Some are insipid  as to flavor, and others are too tough or too slimy to please the  popular taste.          CAUTIONARY SUGGESTIONS.      Before collecting for the table mushrooms found growing in the woods or  fields, it would be well for inexperienced persons to consult carefully  some work on the subject in which the characteristics of edible and  poisonous varieties are described and illustrated.    Considering that an opinion seems to prevail that the discoloration of  the silver spoon or small white onions when brought into contact with  mushrooms during the culinary process is an infallible test of the  poisonous species, I quote from a French author on mushrooms the  following in relation to this supposed test:        * * * We may not dispute the fact that a silver spoon or article of      brass, or onions, may not become discolored on contact with the      poisonous principle, but this discoloration is not reliable as a      test for deciding the good or bad quality of mushrooms.
