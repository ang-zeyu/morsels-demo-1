Nevertheless, while the men-at-arms who guarded the caravan were  staying us with pike and cross-bow from behind a tree which they had  felled in front of a high bridge the others had driven the pack-horses  off, so that by the time we had forced the bridge they were a league  or more away. We pushed after them as hard as we were able, but when we  came up with them we found that they had been joined by Baron Frederick  of Trutz-Drachen, to whom for three years and more the burghers of  Gruenstadt have been paying a tribute for his protection against others.  Then again they made a stand, and this time the Baron Frederick himself  was with them. But though the dogs fought well, we were forcing them  back, and might have got the better of them, had not my horse stumbled  upon a sloping stone, and so fell and rolled over upon me. While I lay  there with my horse upon me, Baron Frederick ran me down with his lance,  and gave me that foul wound that came so near to slaying me--and did  slay my dear wife. Nevertheless, my men were able to bring me out from  that press and away, and we had bitten the Trutz-Drachen dogs so deep  that they were too sore to follow us, and so let us go our way in peace.  But when those fools of mine brought me to my castle they bore me lying  upon a litter to my wife's chamber. There she beheld me, and, thinking  me dead, swooned a death-swoon, so that she only lived long enough to  bless her new-born babe and name it Otto, for you, her father's brother.  But, by heavens! I will have revenge, root and branch, upon that vile  tribe, the Roderburgs of Trutz-Drachen. Their great-grandsire built that  castle in scorn of Baron Casper in the old days; their grandsire slew my  father's grandsire; Baron Nicholas slew two of our kindred; and now this  Baron Frederick gives me that foul wound and kills my dear wife through  my body.\" Here the Baron stopped short; then of a sudden, shaking his  fist above his head, he cried out in his hoarse voice: \"I swear by all  the saints in heaven, either the red cock shall crow over the roof of  Trutz-Drachen or else it shall crow over my house! The black dog shall  sit on Baron Frederick's shoulders or else he shall sit on mine!\" Again  he stopped, and fixing his blazing eyes upon the old man, \"Hearest thou  that, priest?\" said he, and broke into a great boisterous laugh.    Abbot Otto sighed heavily, but he tried no further to persuade the other  into different thoughts.    \"Thou art wounded,\" said he, at last, in a gentle voice; \"at least stay  here with us until thou art healed.\"    \"Nay,\" said the Baron, roughly, \"I will tarry no longer than to hear  thee promise to care for my child.\"    \"I promise,\" said the Abbot; \"but lay aside thy armor, and rest.\"    \"Nay,\" said the Baron, \"I go back again to-day.\"    At this the Abbot cried out in amazement: \"Sure thou, wounded man, would  not take that long journey without a due stay for resting! Think! Night  will be upon thee before thou canst reach home again, and the forests  are beset with wolves.\"    The Baron laughed. \"Those are not the wolves I fear,\" said he. \"Urge me  no further, I must return to-night; yet if thou hast a mind to do me a  kindness thou canst give me some food to eat and a flask of your golden  Michaelsburg; beyond these, I ask no further favor of any man, be he  priest or layman.\"    \"What comfort I can give thee thou shalt have,\" said the Abbot, in his  patient voice, and so left the room to give the needful orders, bearing  the babe with him.          V. How Otto Dwelt at St. Michaelsburg.    So the poor, little, motherless waif lived among the old monks at the  White Cross on the hill, thriving and growing apace until he had reached  eleven or twelve years of age; a slender, fair-haired little fellow,  with a strange, quiet serious manner.    \"Poor little child!\" Old Brother Benedict would sometimes say to the  others, \"poor little child! The troubles in which he was born must have  broken his wits like a glass cup. What think ye he said to me to-day?  'Dear Brother Benedict,' said he, 'dost thou shave the hair off of the  top of thy head so that the dear God may see thy thoughts the better?'  Think of that now!\" and the good old man shook with silent laughter.    When such talk came to the good Father Abbot's ears, he smiled quietly  to himself. \"It may be,\" said he, \"that the wisdom of little children  flies higher than our heavy wits can follow.\"    At least Otto was not slow with his studies, and Brother Emmanuel,  who taught him his lessons, said more than once that, if his wits were  cracked in other ways, they were sound enough in Latin.    Otto, in a quaint, simple way which belonged to him, was gentle  and obedient to all. But there was one among the Brethren of St.  Michaelsburg whom he loved far above all the rest--Brother John, a poor  half-witted fellow, of some twenty-five or thirty years of age. When  a very little child, he had fallen from his nurse's arms and hurt his  head, and as he grew up into boyhood, and showed that his wits had been  addled by his fall, his family knew not what else to do with him, and  so sent him off to the Monastery of St. Michaelsburg, where he lived  his simple, witless life upon a sort of sufferance, as though he were a  tame, harmless animal.    While Otto was still a little baby, he had been given into Brother  John's care. Thereafter, and until Otto had grown old enough to care for  himself, poor Brother John never left his little charge, night or day.  Oftentimes the good Father Abbot, coming into the garden, where he loved  to walk alone in his meditations, would find the poor, simple Brother  sitting under the shade of the pear-tree, close to the bee-hives,  rocking the little baby in his arms, singing strange, crazy songs to  it, and gazing far away into the blue, empty sky with his curious, pale  eyes.    Although, as Otto grew up into boyhood, his lessons and his tasks  separated him from Brother John, the bond between them seemed to grow  stronger rather than weaker. During the hours that Otto had for his own  they were scarcely ever apart. Down in the vineyard, where the monks  were gathering the grapes for the vintage, in the garden, or in the  fields, the two were always seen together, either wandering hand in  hand, or seated in some shady nook or corner.    But most of all they loved to lie up in the airy wooden belfry; the  great gaping bell hanging darkly above them, the mouldering cross-beams  glimmering far up under the dim shadows of the roof, where dwelt a great  brown owl that, unfrightened at their familiar presence, stared down at  them with his round, solemn eyes. Below them stretched the white walls  of the garden, beyond them the vineyard, and beyond that again the far  shining river, that seemed to Otto's mind to lead into wonder-land.  There the two would lie upon the belfry floor by the hour, talking  together of the strangest things.    \"I saw the dear Angel Gabriel again yester morn,\" said Brother John.    \"So!\" says Otto, seriously; \"and where was that?\"    \"It was out in the garden, in the old apple-tree,\" said Brother John. \"I  was walking there, and my wits were running around in the grass like a  mouse. What heard I but a wonderful sound of singing, and it was like  the hum of a great bee, only sweeter than honey. So I looked up into the  tree, and there I saw two sparks. I thought at first that they were  two stars that had fallen out of heaven; but what think you they were,  little child?\"    \"I do not know,\" said Otto, breathlessly.    \"They were angel's eyes,\" said Brother John; and he smiled in the  strangest way, as he gazed up into the blue sky. \"So I looked at the two  sparks and felt happy, as one does in spring time when the cold weather  is gone, and the warm sun shines, and the cuckoo sings again. Then,  by-and-by, I saw the face to which the eyes belonged. First, it shone  white and thin like the moon in the daylight; but it grew brighter and  brighter, until it hurt one's eyes to look at it, as though it had been  the blessed sun itself. Angel Gabriel's hand was as white as silver, and  in it he held a green bough with blossoms, like those that grow on the  thorn bush. As for his robe, it was all of one piece, and finer than the  Father Abbot's linen, and shone beside like the sunlight on pure snow.  So I knew from all these things that it was the blessed Angel Gabriel.\"    \"What do they say about this tree, Brother John?\" said he to me.    \"They say it is dying, my Lord Angel,\" said I, \"and that the gardener  will bring a sharp axe and cut it down.\"    \"'And what dost thou say about it, Brother John?' said he.\"    \"'I also say yes, and that it is dying,' said I.\"    \"At that he smiled until his face shone so bright that I had to shut my  eyes.\"    \"'Now I begin to believe, Brother John, that thou art as foolish as men  say,' said he. 'Look, till I show thee.' And thereat I opened mine eyes  again.\"    \"Then Angel Gabriel touched the dead branches with the flowery twig that  he held in his hand, and there was the dead wood all covered with green  leaves, and fair blossoms and beautiful apples as yellow as gold. Each  smelling more sweetly than a garden of flowers, and better to the taste  than white bread and honey.    \"'They are souls of the apples,' said the good Angel,' and they can  never wither and die.'    \"'Then I'll tell the gardener that he shall not cut the tree down,' said  I.\"    \"'No, no,' said the dear Gabriel, 'that will never do, for if the tree  is not cut down here on the earth, it can never be planted in paradise.'\"    Here Brother John stopped short in his story, and began singing one of  his crazy songs, as he gazed with his pale eyes far away into nothing at  all.    \"But tell me, Brother John,\" said little Otto, in a hushed voice, \"what  else did the good Angel say to thee?\"    Brother John stopped short in his song and began looking from right to  left,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28659"],[0,"The Acts of Uniformity: Their Scope and Effect (#4)"],[1,"I have  referred, purporting to give an account of what was  done in 1559, explains that parliamentary action is  limited to enforcing the use of the Book by penalties.  Further authority than this, he says emphatically, is  not in the Parliament. Writing early in the seventeenth  century he sets out exactly the procedure  followed in 1662. He describes, in fact, the policy of  Uniformity, which was, therefore, not peculiar to the  last occasion. [40]    I shall describe it negatively. The Parliament  was not legislating for the regulation of divine worship.  In 1662, as we have seen, both Houses, while stiffly  maintaining their right to interfere, expressly declined  that task, and declared it the proper work of Convocation.  This was not from want of interest. The  Commons were eager to have some further rules for  \"reverend gestures.\" But these things were to be  regulated rather by canon than by statute. The Convocation  was not even asked to prepare something for  submission to Parliament; \"some canon or rule,\"  enacted by Convocation with royal assent, would be  the sufficient and proper authority. [41] There could be  no clearer proof, that, according to the mind of Parliament,  Convocation has full powers, and is the proper  authority, for dealing with such matters.    But even if this be so, it is urged, on the other  hand, that what is contained in the Prayer-book is  actually prescribed and stands by authority of Parliament.  The Book annexed is treated as a schedule  of the Act of Uniformity. It is, says Dr. Stephens,      part of the statute law of the land; and all the legal    and equitable principles of construction which apply    to statutes in general, equally apply to the Book of    Common Prayer. [42]    This opinion, supported as it is by a general  consent of high authorities, I venture to contest.  What is meant by the Book being \"annexed\" to  the statute? Physically, it was attached by strings  to the parchment on which the Act was engrossed.  Was it legally a part of the statute? Was it a  schedule? The procedure in Parliament, I submit,  makes against this opinion. Can the schedule of a  Bill in Parliament be amended otherwise than by the  vote of the two Houses? But when a mistake was  found in the Book annexed, it was corrected, as we  have seen, not by the clerk under authority of Parliament,  but by three bishops under authority of Convocation.  Could any part of a Bill in Parliament  have been so amended? The matter was trivial;  there was the less reason for abnormal measures;  and Parliament has always been jealous about small  matters of procedure, and never more so than at that  period. I submit that the Book annexed cannot be  regarded as an integral part of the statute.    But if the Prayer-book is thus external to the  statutes which require its use, can its meaning be  affected by any of the provisions of those statutes?  If the wisdom of Parliament had enacted on some  occasion that Aldrich's Logic and the Elements of  Euclid should be read in the Universities, would it  follow that the rules of the syllogism and the axioms  of geometry are to be interpreted by \"the principles  of construction which apply to statutes\"? Or since  geography is by statutory authority taught in our  elementary schools, are we to infer that the world  revolves on its axis subject to the British Constitution?    The Prayer-book is a liturgical document, and surely  it should be interpreted by the principles which apply  not to statutes, but to liturgies in general.    If the Acts of Uniformity are not laws for regulating  divine worship, what are they? I should call  them, briefly, laws of persecution. They were intended  to enforce on all men by criminal process the  observance of the Church's forms. That is persecution,  I suppose, if anything can be so called. I shall  not indulge in any moral reflexions on persecution.  They may be taken for granted. I shall only note  the dry fact that within thirty years of the last enactment  the whole purpose of the statutes was destroyed  by the Act of Toleration. A good part of them has  been formally repealed, as may be seen by a glance  at their text as printed in the Revised Statutes.  What remains? A singular ruin. The effect of the  law has been turned upside down. It was intended  only to restrain dissenters; dissenters are now the  only people to whom it does not apply. It was intended  only to prevent unauthorized variations from  the Prayer-book; it is effective now to prevent  authorized variations alone. The one effect of the  Acts of Uniformity at the present time is to render  it practically impossible for the authorities of the  Church to make the smallest amendment of the text  of the Book of Common Prayer. In doing this they  would run counter to the law which orders the use  of this Book and none other. Unauthorized variations,  on the other hand, are unchecked by the Acts  of Uniformity. So far as they are restrained at all,  they are restrained by the general disciplinary powers  of the Church. Theoretically those who indulge in  them are liable to the statutory penalties imposed by  the Act of Elizabeth. Practically these cannot be  enforced; their savagery makes it impossible. They  stand as they were enacted in 1549, and again ten  years later; they are now intolerable. I am told that  no attempt has been made to enforce them since the  year 1796, nor is there any chance of their being  revived. The Acts of Uniformity, so far as they  relate to the Prayer-book, have therefore no present  effect but to hinder the activity of the Church. They  began with fierce persecution on behalf of the Church.  They end by being merely a nuisance.        APPENDIX      State Papers, Domestic, Elizabeth, Vol. VII., No. 46.

[Endorsed] Bishops.    ******    Another copy follows, No. 47, written with modernised  spelling. It is endorsed as follows:    (1) _Bishops_.    (2) _Power of the Convocn in framing the Book of Common  Prayer &c. and of the Act of Parlt Sr. Th. Wilson's hand_.    The second endorsement of No. 47 (wrongly given in the  Calendar as \"Progress of the Convocation, etc.\") is in the  handwriting of Sir Joseph Williamson, Keeper of the State  Paper Office, and from 1674 to 1679 Secretary of State. Sir  Thomas Wilson was a confidential servant of Robert, Earl of  Salisbury, who often employed him in matters of secret  police. He was made Keeper of the S.P. Office in 1605 and  died in 1629. A comparison with his letters and notes  preserved in the Record Office shows that the copy in his  handwriting is the earlier one, No. 46. It is written, however,  more formally and with more archaic spelling than his  original papers. It would therefore seem to be a copy of an  older original. I venture to suggest that it may have been  written for Salisbury's use in 1604, when revision of the  Prayer-book was being discussed. There is nothing to show  the provenance of the original, but the errors in point of fact  make against an early date. Cheney is said to have been  a bishop in the time of Edward VI.; he was in fact raised  to the episcopate in the year 1562. Oglethorpe is said, like  Kitchen, to have retained his bishopric under Elizabeth. He  was in fact deposed on June 21, 1559, and died in the following  December. The statement that the Prayer-book was  submitted to the Convocation, \"consisting of the said  Bishops,\" is all but demonstrably false.

As the bishops were required  \"to cause these books to be delivered to every parson, vicar, and curate,\"  within their several dioceses, the more scrupulous among these might  fairly argue that they accepted the order on the authority of the diocesan.  But it may be doubted whether such a refinement occurred to many at  that time.    [4] Overall, _Accounts of the Churchwardens_, etc., p. 67.    [5] _Ibid_., p. 68.
