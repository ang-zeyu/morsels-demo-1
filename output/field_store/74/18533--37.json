While the ports of the  North were bustling with foreign trade, grass grew on the  cobble-stoned streets along the waterfronts of Charleston and  Savannah. Slow starvation aided the constant pounding of the  Northern armies in reducing the South to subjection.    Had the Confederacy possessed but a few submarines of modern type  this situation could not have persisted. Then, as to-day, neutral  nations were eager to trade with both belligerents. There were then  more neutrals whose interests would have compelled the observance of  the laws of blockade, which in the present war are flagrantly  violated by all belligerents with impunity. A submarine raid which  would have sunk or driven away the blockading fleet at the entrance  to a single harbour would have resulted in opening that harbour to  the unrestricted uses of neutral ships until the blockade could be  re-established and formal notice given to all powers--a formality  which in those days, prior to the existence of cables, would have  entailed weeks, perhaps months, of delay.    How serious such an interruption to the blockade was then considered  was shown by the trepidation of the Union naval authorities over the  first victories of the _Merrimac_ prior to the providential arrival  of the _Monitor_ in Hampton Roads. It was then thought that the  Confederate ram would go straight to Wilmington, Charleston, and  Savannah, destroy or drive away the blockaders, and open the  Confederacy to the trade of the world.    Even then men dreamed of submarines, as indeed they have since the  days of the American Revolution. Of the slow development of that  engine of war to its present effectiveness we shall speak more fully  in later chapters. Enough now to say that had the Confederacy  possessed boats of the U-53 type the story of our Civil War might  have had a different ending. The device which the Allies have  adopted to-day of blockading a port or ports by posting their ships  several hundred miles away would have found no toleration among  neutrals none too friendly to the United States, and vastly stronger  in proportion to the power of this nation than all the neutrals  to-day are to the strength of the Allies.    [Illustration: _Victory in the Clouds._    _Painting by John E. Whiting._]    From the beginning of the Great War in Europe the fleets of the  Teutonic alliance were locked up in port by the superior floating  forces of the Entente. Such sporadic dashes into the arena of  conflict as the one made by the German High Fleet, bringing on the  Battle of Jutland, had but little bearing on the progress of the  war. But the steady, persistent malignant activity of the German  submarines had everything to do with it. They mitigated the  rigidity of the British blockade by keeping the blockaders far from  the ports they sought to seal. They preyed on the British fleets by  sinking dreadnoughts, battleships, and cruisers in nearly all of the  belligerent seas. If the British navy justified its costly power by  keeping the German fleet practically imprisoned in its fortified  harbours, the German submarines no less won credit and glory by  keeping even that overwhelming naval force restricted in its  movements, ever on guard, ever in a certain sense on the defensive.  And meanwhile these underwater craft so preyed upon British  foodships that in the days of the greatest submarine activity  England was reduced to husbanding her stores of food with almost as  great thrift and by precisely the same methods as did Germany  suffering from the British blockade.    Aircraft and submarines! Twin terrors of the world's greatest war!  The development, though by no means the final development, of dreams  that men of many nations have dreamed throughout the centuries! They  are two of the outstanding features of the war; two of its legacies  to mankind. How much the legacy may be worth in peaceful times is  yet to be determined. The airplane and the dirigible at any rate  seem already to promise useful service to peaceful man. Already the  flier is almost as common a spectacle in certain sections of our  country as the automobile was fifteen years ago. The submarine, for  economic reasons, promises less for the future in the way of  peaceful service, notwithstanding the exploits of the _Deutschland_  in the ocean-carrying trade. But perhaps it too will find its place  in industry when awakened man shall be willing to spend as much  treasure, as much genius, as much intelligent effort, and as much  heroic self-sacrifice in organizing for the social good as in the  last four years he has expended in its destruction.          CHAPTER II    THE EARLIEST FLYING MEN      The conquest of the air has been the dream of mankind for uncounted  centuries. As far back as we have historic records we find stories  of the attempts of men to fly. The earliest Greek mythology is full  of aeronautical legends, and the disaster which befell Icarus and  his wings of wax when exposed to the glare of the midsummer sun in  Greece, is part of the schoolboy's task in Ovid. We find like  traditions in the legendary lore of the Peruvians, the East Indians,  the Babylonians, even the savage races of darkest Africa. In the  Hebrew scriptures the chief badge of sanctity conferred on God's  angels was wings, and the ability to fly. If we come down to the  mythology of more recent times we find our pious ancestors in New  England thoroughly convinced that the witches they flogged and  hanged were perfectly able to navigate the air on a broomstick--thus  antedating the Wrights' experiments with heavier-than-air machines  by more than 250 years.    It is an interesting fact, stimulating to philosophical reflection,  that in the last decade more has been done toward the conquest of  the air, than in the twenty centuries preceding it, though during  all that period men had been dreaming, planning, and experimenting  upon contrivances for flight. Moreover when success came--or such  measure of success as has been won--it came by the application of an  entirely novel principle hardly dreamed of before the nineteenth  century.    Some of the earlier efforts to master gravity and navigate the air  are worthy of brief mention if only to show how persistent were the  efforts from the earliest historic ages to accomplish this end.  Passing over the legends of the time of mythology we find that  many-sided genius, Leonardo da Vinci, early in the sixteenth  century, not content with being a painter, architect, sculptor,  engineer and designer of forts, offering drawings and specifications  of wings which, fitted to men, he thought would enable them to fly.  The sketches are still preserved in a museum at Paris. He modelled  his wings on those of a bat and worked them with ropes passing over  pulleys, the aviator lying prone, face downward, and kicking with  both arms and legs with the vigour of a frog. There is, unhappily,  no record that the proposition ever advanced beyond the literary  stage--certainly none that Da Vinci himself thus risked his life.  History records no one who kicked his way aloft with the Da Vinci  device. But the manuscript which the projector left shows that he  recognized the modern aviator's maxim, \"There's safety in altitude.\"  He says, in somewhat confused diction:         The bird should with the aid of the wind raise itself to a great       height, and this will be its safety; because although the       revolutions mentioned may happen there is time for it to recover       its equilibrium, provided its various parts are capable of strong       resistance so that they may safely withstand the fury and impetus       of the descent.    [Illustration: _The Fall of the Boche._    _From the painting by Lieutenant Farre._    Photo by Peter A. Juley.]    The fallacy that a man could, by the rapid flapping of wings of any  sort, overcome the force of gravity persisted up to a very recent  day, despite the complete mathematical demonstration by von  Helmholtz in 1878 that man could not possibly by his own muscular  exertions raise his own weight into the air and keep it suspended.  Time after time the \"flapping wings\" were resorted to by ambitious  aviators with results akin to those attained by Darius Green. One of  the earliest was a French locksmith named Besnier, who had four  collapsible planes on two rods balanced across his shoulders. These  he vigorously moved up and down with his hands and feet, the planes  opening like covers of a book as they came down, and closing as they  came up. Besnier made no attempt to raise himself from the ground,  but believed that once launched in the air from an elevation he  could maintain himself, and glide gradually to earth at a  considerable distance. It is said that he and one or two of his  students did in a way accomplish this. Others, however,  experimenting with the same method came to sorry disaster. Among  these was an Italian friar whom King James IV. of Scotland had made  Prior of Tongland. Equipped with a pair of large feather wings  operated on the Besnier principle, he launched himself from the  battlements of Stirling Castle in the presence of King James and  his court. But gravity was too much for his apparatus, and turning  over and over in mid-air he finally landed ingloriously on a manure  heap--at that period of nascent culture a very common feature of the  pleasure grounds of a palace. He had a soul above his fate however,  for he ascribed his fall not to vulgar mechanical causes, but wholly  to the fact that he had overlooked the proper dignity of flight by  pluming his wings with the feathers of common barn-yard fowl instead  of with plumes plucked from the wings of eagles!    In sharp competition with the aspiring souls who sought to fly with  wings--the forerunners of the airplane devotees of to-day--were  those who tried to find some direct lifting device for a car which  should contain the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3005"],[0,"Tom Swift and His Airship (#4)"],[1,"by Mr. Swift, and with Garret Jackson, the engineer, to  lend a hand whenever needed, the aeronaut and the owner of the speedy  Arrow made considerable progress on their airship.    \"What is your father so busy over?\" asked Mr. Sharp one day, when the  new aluminum gas holder was about completed.    \"I don't know,\" answered Tom, with a somewhat puzzled air. \"He doesn't  seem to want to talk about it, even to me. He says it will  revolutionize travel along a certain line, but whether he is working on  an airship that will rival ours, or a new automobile, I can't make out.  He'll tell us in good time. But when do you think we will finish  the--well, I don't know what to call it--I mean our aeroplane?\"    \"Oh, in about a month now. That's so, though, we haven't a name for it.  But we'll christen it after it's completed. Now if you'll tighten up  some of those bolts I'll get the gas generating apparatus in readiness  for another test.\"    A short description of the new airship may not be out of place now. It  was built after plans Mr. Sharp had shown to Tom and his father soon  after the thrilling rescue of the aeronaut from the blazing balloon  over Lake Carlopa. The general idea of the airship was that of the  familiar aeroplane, but in addition to the sustaining surfaces of the  planes, there was an aluminum, cigar-shaped tank, holding a new and  very powerful gas, which would serve to keep the ship afloat even when  not in motion.    Two sets of planes, one above the other, were used, bringing the  airship into the biplane class. There were also two large propellers,  one in front and the other at the rear. These were carefully made, of  different layers of wood \"built up\" as they are called, to make them  stronger. They were eight feet in diameter, and driven by a  twenty-cylinder, air-cooled, motor, whirled around at the rate of  fifteen hundred revolutions a minute. When operated at full speed the  airship was capable of making eighty miles an hour, against a moderate  wind.    But if the use of the peculiarly-shaped planes and the gas container,  with the secret but powerful vapor in it were something new in airship  construction, so was the car in which the operator and travelers were  to live during a voyage. It was a complete living room, with the engine  and other apparatus, including that for generating the gas, in a  separate compartment, and the whole was the combined work of Tom and  Mr. Sharp. There were accommodations for five persons, with sleeping  berths, a small galley or kitchen, where food could be prepared, and  several easy chairs where the travelers could rest in comfort while  skimming along high in the air, as fast as the fastest railroad train.    There was room enough to carry stores for a voyage of a week or more,  and enough gas could be manufactured aboard the ship, in addition to  that taken in the aluminum case before starting, to sustain the ship  for two weeks. The engine, steering apparatus, and the gas machine were  within easy reach and control of the pilot, who was to be stationed in  a small room in the \"bow\" of the ship. An electric stove served to warm  the interior of the car, and also provided means for cooking the food.    The airship could be launched either by starting it along the ground,  on rubber-tired wheels, as is done in the case of the ordinary  aeroplane, or it could be lifted by the gas, just as is done with a  balloon. In short there were many novel features about the ship.    The gas test, which took place a few days later, showed that the young  inventor and Mr. Sharp had made no mistake this time. No explosion  followed, the needle valve controlling the powerful vapor perfectly.    \"Well,\" remarked Mr. Sharp, one afternoon, \"I think we shall put the  ship together next week, Tom, and have a trial flight. We shall need a  few more aluminum bolts, though, and if you don't mind you might jump  on your motor-cycle and run to Mansburg for them. Merton's machine shop  ought to have some.\"    Mansburg was the nearest large city to Shopton, and Merton was a  machinist who frequently did work for Mr. Swift.    \"All right,\" agreed Tom. \"I'll start now. How many will you need?\"    \"Oh, a couple of dozen.\"    Tom started off, wheeling his cycle from the shed where it was kept.  As he passed the building where the big frame of the airship, with the  planes and aluminum bag had been assembled, he looked in.    \"We'll soon be flying through the clouds on your back,\" he remarked,  speaking to the apparatus as if it could understand. \"I guess we'll  smash some records, too, if that engine works as well when it's  installed as it does now.\"    Tom had purchased the bolts, and was on his way back with them, when,  as he passed through one of the outlying streets of Mansburg, something  went wrong with his motor-cycle. He got off to adjust it, finding that  it was only a trifling matter, which he soon put right, when he was  aware of a man standing, observing him. Without looking up at the man's  face, the young inventor was unpleasantly aware of a sharp scrutiny. He  could hardly explain it, but it seemed as if the man had evil  intentions toward him, and it was not altogether unexpected on Tom's  part, when, looking up, he saw staring at him, Anson Morse, the leader  of the gang of men who had caused such trouble for him.    \"Oh, it's you; is it?\" asked Morse, an ugly scowl on his face. \"I  thought I recognized you.\" He moved nearer to Tom, who straightened up,  and stood leaning on his wheel.    \"Yes; it's me,\" admitted the lad.    \"I've been looking for you,\" went on Morse. \"I'm not done with you yet,  nor your father, either.\"    \"Aren't you?\" asked Tom, trying to speak coolly, though his heart was  beating rather faster than usual. Morse had spoken in a threatening  manner, and, as the youth looked up and down the street he saw that it  was deserted; nor were there any houses near.    \"No, I'm not,\" snapped the man. \"You got me and my friends in a lot of  trouble, and--\"    \"You didn't get half what you deserved!\" burst out Tom, indignant at  the thought of what he and his father had suffered at the hands of the  gang. \"You ought to be in jail now, instead of out; and if I could see  a policeman, I'd have you arrested for threatening me! That's against  the law!\"    \"Huh! I s'pose you think you know lots about the law,\" sneered Morse.  \"Well, I tell you one thing, if you make any further trouble for me,  I'll--\"    \"I'll make all the trouble I can!\" cried Tom, and he boldly faced the  angry man. \"I'm not afraid of you!\"    \"You'd better be!\" and Morse spoke in a vindictive manner. \"We'll get  even with you yet, Tom Swift. In fact I've a good notion now to give  you a good thrashing for what you've done.\"    Before Tom was aware of the man's intention, Morse had stepped quickly  into the street, where the lad stood beside his wheel, and grasped him  by the shoulder. He gave Tom a vicious shake.    \"Take your hand off me!\" cried Tom, who was hampered by having to hold  up his heavy machine.    \"I will when I've given you what I owe you!\" retorted the scoundrel.  \"I'm going to have satisfaction now if I never--\"    At that instant there came from down the street the sound of a rattling  and bumping. Tom looked up quickly, and saw approaching a rattletrap of  a wagon, drawn by a big, loose-jointed mule, the large ears of which  were flapping to and fro. The animal was advancing rapidly, in response  to blows and words from the colored driver, and, before the uplifted  fist of Morse could fall on Tom's head, the outfit was opposite them.    \"Hold on dar, mistah! Hold on!\" cried the colored man in the wagon.  \"What are yo' doin' to mah friend, Mistah Swift?\"    \"None of your business!\" snapped Morse. \"You drive on and let me manage  this affair if you don't want trouble! Who are you anyhow?\"    \"Why doan't yo' know me?\" asked the colored man, at whom Tom looked  gratefully. \"I's Eradicate Sampson, an' dish yeah am mah mule,  Boomerang. Whoa, Boomerang! I reckon yo' an' I better take a hand in  dish yeah argument.\"    \"Not unless you want trouble!\" cried Morse.    \"I doan't mind trouble, not in de leastest,\" answered Eradicate  cheerfully. \"Me an' Boomerang has had lots of trouble. We's used to it.  No, Mistah Man, you'd better let go ob mah friend, Mistah Swift, if yo'  doan't want trouble yo' ownse'f.\"    \"Drive on, and mind your business!\" cried Morse, now unreasoningly  angry. \"This is my affair,\" and he gave Tom a shake.    Our hero was not going to submit tamely, however. He had one hand free,  and raised to strike Morse, but the latter, letting go his hold on the  lad's shoulder, grasped with that hand, the fist which the young  inventor had raised. Then, with his other hand, the scoundrel was about  to hit Tom.    \"Break away four him, Mistah Swift!\" directed the colored man. \"Yo' can  fight him, den!\"    \"I guess he'll have his own troubles doing that,\" sneered Morse.    \"Not ef I help him,\" answered Eradicate promptly, as he climbed back  off the seat, into the body of his ramshackle vehicle.    \"Don't you interfere with me!\" stormed the man.    An instant later Tom broke away from his tormentor, and laid his  motor-cycle on the ground, in order to have both hands free for the  attack he felt would follow.    \"Ha! You think you're going to escape, do you?\" cried Morse, as he  started toward Tom, his eyes blazing. \"I'll show you who you're dealing  with!\"    \"Yes, an' I reckon I'll show yo' suffin yo' ain't lookin' fer!\"  suddenly cried Eradicate.    With a quick motion he picked up a pail of white-wash from his wagon,  and, with sure aim, emptied the contents of the bucket over Morse, who  was rushing at Tom. The white fluid spread over the man from head to  foot, enveloping him as in a white shroud, and his advance was  instantly checked.    \"Dar! I reckon dat's de quickest white-washin' job I done in some  time!\" chuckled Eradicate, as he grasped his long "]]]
