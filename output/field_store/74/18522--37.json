'Tis queer, though: I'm in the river instead of on the  road to the farm.\" This, for Lutra, was perhaps the only noteworthy  episode of her early life.    The otter-cub was about nine months old when spring came to the valley.  The water-weed grew in long filaments from the gravelly shallows. The  angler, who had ceased to frequent the riverside at the approach of  winter, returned to the pool, but only by day, and then Lutra dozed in  her retreat. In the pines on the margin of the river the blue ringdoves  were busy constructing the rude makeshift that was to serve the purpose  of a nest. Instead of seeking how to construct a perfect dwelling place,  these slipshod builders spent most of their hours in courtship.  Sometimes, owing to the carelessness of the lackadaisical doves, a dry  stick released by bill or claw would fall pattering among the branches,  and drop, with a plash, into the river, where it would be borne by the  current past the otter's lair. From every bush and brake along the  sparkling stream the carols of joyous birds floated on the morning  mists. The first green leaves of the bean peeped in the gardens; the  first broods of the year's ducklings launched forth, like heartstrong  adventurers, into the shallows by the cottage walls. In the sunny glades  the big, fleshy buds of the chestnut and the light-green, tapering  sprouts of the sycamore expanded under the influence of increasing  warmth. Finches and sparrows, on the lookout for flies, hovered above  the ankle-deep drifts of leaf-mould in the lane below the trees, or  crossed and re-crossed between the budding boughs. Only a few of these  many signs were observed by Lutra, it is true, for she spent the day in  hiding. But at dusk she heard the bleating of the lambs, and the musical  note of a bell that had been slung round the neck of the patriarch of  the flock in order to deter foxes from meddling with the new-born  weaklings then under the big ram's care. She was made aware of the  presence of spring by the \"scent in the shadow and sound in the light.\"  The hatching of countless flies in the leaf-mould was not watched by the  birds only: Lutra also knew that the swarms had arrived; and spring was  welcome if only for this.    For months she had fed on lean and tasteless trout exhausted by  spawning. Now, instead of lying under stones or haunting the deep basin  of the pool, the trout rose to the surface and wandered abroad into the  shallows. There the languid fish became fit for food again, and more  capable of eluding the occasional long, stern chases of the otter. But  Lutra was never disconcerted by the fact that the fish were strong and  active; as with all carnivorous creatures, her sporting instincts were  so highly developed that she revelled in overcoming difficulties,  especially because she felt her own strength growing from day to day.  During winter the trout had fed on worms and \"sundries.\" Now, their best  and heartiest meals were of flies. Daily, at noon, swarms of ephemerals  played over the water, and the trout rose from the river-bed to feed. At  first they \"sported\" ravenously, rising quick and sure to any insect  their marvellous vision might discern. Afterwards they fed daintily,  disabling and drowning with a flip of the tail many an insect that  fluttered at the surface, and choosing from their various victims some  unusually tasty morsel, such as a female \"February red\" about to lay her  eggs. At this time, also, the plump, cream-coloured larvae of the  stone-fly in the shallows were growing within their well cemented  caddis-cases and preparing for maturity. So the trout fattened on  caddis-grubs and flies, and the otter-cub, in corresponding measure,  became sleek, well-grown, and spirited.    In the winter Lutra had imperceptibly acquired the habit of swimming and  diving across-stream, just as an old fox, when hunting in the woods,  quarters his ground systematically across-wind, and so detects the  slightest scent that may be wafted on the breeze. Nature had been  specially kind to her; she was fashioned perfectly, and in the river  reigned supreme. Her body was long, supple, and tapering; her brown fur  was close and short, so that the water never penetrated to her skin and  her movements were not retarded as they would have been had she  possessed the loose, draggling coat of an otter-hound. She seemed to  glide with extraordinary facility even against a rapid current. Her skin  was so tough that on one occasion when, by accident, she was carried  down a raging rapid and thrown against a jagged rock, a slight bruise  was the only result. Her legs were short and powerful, her toes webbed,  and her tail served the purpose of a rudder. Nostrils, eyes, and  ears--all were small and water-tight, and set so high on the skull that,  when she rose to breathe, little more than a speck could be seen on the  surface, unless she felt it safe to raise her head and body further for  the sake of ease in plunging deep.    When Lutra was nine months old she caught her first salmon; and, though  the fish was only a small \"kelt,\" returning, weak from spawning, to the  sea, the capture was a fair test of the cub's prowess and daring. It  happened thus. She was walking up the river-bed one boisterous night,  when she saw a dark form hovering close to the surface in the middle of  a deep pool. Her eyes, peculiarly fitted for watching objects  immediately above, quickly detected the almost motionless fish. The  eyes of the salmon were also formed for looking upwards, and so Lutra  remained unnoticed by her prey. She stole around the hovering fish, that  the bubbles caused by her breathing might make no noticeable disturbance  as they rose to the surface, and then, having judged to a nicety the  strength of the stream, paddled with almost imperceptible motion towards  the salmon. Before the fish had time to flee it was caught in Lutra's  vice-like jaws and borne, struggling desperately and threshing the water  into foam, to the bank. There the otter-cub killed her victim by  severing the vertebrae immediately behind its gills.    Otters well nigh invariably destroy large-sized fish by attacking them  in this particular part. And, according to a similar method, stoats and  polecats, whenever possible, seize their victims near the base of the  brain. In yet another way Lutra proved her relationship to the weasel  tribe: just as our miniature land-otters eat only small portions of the  rabbits they kill, so the cub was content with a juicy morsel behind the  salmon's head--a morsel known among sportsmen as \"the otter's bite.\"    Soon after the cub had killed her first salmon she separated from her  parents and brothers, travelled far down-river, and wandered alone. In  the human character, development becomes especially marked directly  independence of action is assumed; henceforward parental guidance counts  for comparatively little. And so it was with Lutra.          II.    THE POOL BENEATH THE FARMSTEAD.      Last year, in autumn mornings, when the big round clouds sailing swiftly  overhead reminded me of springtide days and joyous skylarks in the  heavens, but when all parent birds were silent, knowing how dark winter  soon would chill the world, a thrush, that not long since had been a  fledgling in his nest amid a shrubbery of box, came to the fruit-tree  near my window, and, in such low tones that only I could hear them,  warbled that all in earth and sky was beautiful.    To Lutra, lonely like the thrush, and, like the thrush, not yet aware of  pain and hunger, the world seemed bright and filled with happiness. At  first, like a young fox that, till he learns the fear of dogs and men,  steals chickens from a coop near which an old, experienced fox would  never venture, she was, perhaps, a little too indifferent to danger. In  her perfect health and irresponsible freedom, she paid but slight  attention to the alarm signals of other creatures of the night.    Up-river, at a bend below a hillside farmstead some distance from our  village, is a broad, deep salmon-pool, fringed with alders and willows.  Right across the upper end of this pool stretches a broken ledge of  rock, over which, in flood, the waters boom and crash into a seething  basin whence thin lines of vapour--blue and grey when the day is dull,  or gleaming with the colours of the rainbow when the sun, unclouded,  shines aslant the fall--ceaselessly arise, and quiver on the waves of  air that catch their movement from the restless swirls beneath. But in  dry summer weather the ledge is covered with green, slippery weed, the  curving fall is smooth as glass, and the rapid loses half its flood-time  strength.    This pool, though containing some of the finest salmon \"hovers\" in the  river, is nowadays but seldom fished. Since the old generation of  village fishermen has passed away it seems to have gradually lost its  popularity. The right bank of the river above and below the pool is for  miles so thickly wooded that anglers prefer to pass up-country before  unpacking their rods. From the left bank it is useless for any angler  who has not made a study of the pool to attempt to reach the \"hovers.\"  Under far more favourable conditions than these, the throw necessary to  place a fly on even the nearest of the \"hovers\" would be almost the  longest that could with accuracy be made. But the angler is baffled at  the outset by the presence of a steep slope behind him.    I well remember two instances when I was tricked by the self-conceit  which led me to suppose that my skill in casting was of no mean order.  Once, while the river was bank-high after flood, I happened to be  throwing an unusually long line, with careless ease, over the lower end  of a pool, where, before, I had never seen a fish. I was, no doubt,  thinking of something quite unconnected with fishing, otherwise I should  not have wandered thus far"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29362"],[0,"The Goat-gland Transplantation (#4)"],[1,"s, the  operation is as simple as in the case of the man. The speculum discloses  the condition of the vagina, and the insertion of the new ovary is into  the mucous membrane of the vagina, leaving the goat-ovary about four  inches distant from the woman's. The only incision made is a small one,  about one inch long, painless under local anesthetic, the purpose of the  incision being to get a blood supply for the goat-ovary. Sometimes one  ovary is implanted, sometimes two; invariably the new ovary is trimmed  to a reduction in size. Invariably it is implanted within twenty minutes  of its removal from the nanny-goat. Unfortunately for the goat, the  removal of her ovaries usually costs her her life. She mopes for a few  days, refuses to eat, and dies. She is always given a general  anesthetic, and the removal is painless at least, if fatal. Pursuing the  conclusions drawn from his long experience, Dr. Brinkley has found that  women derive more instant benefit from the glands than men with respect  to their awakened enthusiasm, improved appearance, and recovery of the  feeling of poise and well-being. Very noticeable is the change of figure  which follows the implanting of the new ovaries in the case of a fat  woman. The change is equally marked in the case of a fat man. A man of  abnormal weight, 250 lbs., lost fifty pounds in two weeks following the  operation, during which time he remained at the hospital, feeling well  and strong, but shrinking in girth amazingly. When he left the hospital  his clothes hung about him in bags and folds. The fat woman's spirits  seem to rise as her weight decreases, and she feels as if she had indeed  regained the buoyancy of her youth.    Dr. Brinkley by no means asserts that the woman whose ovaries have been  removed by surgical operation will grow two new ovaries after the  transplantation has been made, but he cites the case of a woman whose  ovaries had been removed by surgical operation some years previous, the  uterus remaining intact, in whom he implanted two goat-ovaries, and  whose periods shortly afterwards returned on a four-day basis, with  twenty-eight-day interval. He does not say that the goat-ovaries  transplanted into the woman have grown new ovaries, but there remains  the phenomenon of the renewed menstruation, and this is very difficult  to account for. In barren women, from twenty-eight to thirty-five years  of age, in whom he has found not a diseased, but an atrophied, condition  of the ovaries, the transplantation has invariably been attended with  success to the removal of the barrenness, the new glands evidently  bringing about the development of ova. Nor does Dr. Brinkley say that in  the case of a man who has had both glands removed by surgical operation,  the transplantation will produce new glands for the man, and yet he has  had two successes to offset several failures in this very result,  without any clue to why the success followed in the one case and not in  the other. The work is yet in its infancy stage, and Dr. Brinkley is the  first to admit that there is far more about it to be known than he has  yet succeeded in knowing. He is averse to experimenting upon women  patients at this stage of his knowledge, and has many times refused to  transplant the glands for women who have requested him to perform the  operation for them. One such case was at the hospital during the  writer's visit there in April. She was a paralysis case, quite fat,  unable to walk except by putting forward one foot at a time, supported  by the arm of someone on each side of her. She was driven to the  hospital in an automobile, accompanied by her husband and daughter, from  the farm--two hundred miles away! Dr. Brinkley strongly urged her not to  have the gland operation performed at all, but she insisted upon giving  it a trial. It is too soon yet to speak of results in this case, but in  Dr. Brinkley's view it is asking too much of the glands to expect them  to produce favorable results in a case of this severity. Yet, at this  time, there was in the hospital a young woman suffering from Dementia  Praecox, whose mother had been watching over her for twelve years, and  on whom the affliction of her daughter had so weighed that she told the  writer she wished God would take one or the other of them, because it  was more than she could bear. This young woman had been confined in the  State Hospital for the Insane, and had been treated by specialists for  many years, without any benefit at all. There was some homicidal mania,  much depression, and attempts at suicide. She could not be left alone in  her room for a moment. But the day after the transplantation of the  glands this young woman embraced her mother, and talked so rationally to  her that she called in Dr. Brinkley, and with tears repeated what her  daughter had just said. Dr. Brinkley advised her that the results were  altogether too sudden to build upon. \"There will certainly be ups and  downs yet,\" he said. \"You must expect good days and bad days, when you  will doubt if your daughter is any better. But, to make a normal  recovery, she +ought+ to show an alternation of good and bad days, with  the good days gradually drawing ahead and becoming more frequent and  more marked. I look for her to recover entirely in a year's time, but  she will always retain her sensitiveness and a certain amount of  hysteria, so that things that would not bother you or me will hurt her  grievously. You must be prepared to expect this to happen. But I see no  reason at all why she should not in the near future become a happy wife  and mother.\" The blessings of this good mother were a reward in  themselves, and were so received by the doctor and his wife. When such  results as this are obtained it becomes very difficult to draw a line  and say, \"The goat-glands will do no good here.\" Physicians of the best  standing had said to this poor mother before she took her daughter to  Kansas, \"So you're determined to try the goat-glands? You are wasting  your time and money. Brinkley is nothing but a fake. If there were any  help for your daughter we could cure her. We can do nothing. There is no  help for her!\" This was repeated to the writer by the mother, and he  vouches for its truth. Is it not evident that a better understanding of  the goat-gland operation is highly desirable among physicians and  surgeons today?    Quite a frequent style of inquiry from women to the doctor runs like  this: \"I am in good health, and in every way normal; age 35. I want to  remain as I am, and grow no older in appearance than I am today. Do you  think that the goat-gland operation would keep me from getting any  older?\" To this kind of inquiry Dr. Brinkley makes a stereotyped reply,  something as follows: \"If you are today in good health I should not  advise the goat-gland operation, but would advise it in your case as  soon as you have passed the change of life, in ten or fifteen years from  now.\" To the writer he said, \"I cannot conscientiously advise this woman  to submit to this operation, because I don't know that the glands would  advantage her in any way. They might, or they might not. I don't know.  It is therefore experimental work, and I cannot take her money for an  experiment. I must have something definite in the way of experience to  go upon. There must be some evident condition of ill-health to be set  right. But, on the other hand, though I will not advise these people to  take the gland operation, there may be something in her idea that the  glands will arrest age and hold it back. I have never been in a position  where I could afford to experiment on young and healthy human beings,  and this point can only be settled by such experiment upon healthy and  young human beings. I should say at a guess that the operation would do  her no good, but you understand that this is a guess only. I do not know  anything about it. All such things as this we shall learn by degrees by  further experiment. At present I am kept busy attending to cases of real  sickness, or defined conditions of arrest of function, where I have  experience to guide me in saying that the gland-operation will be of  benefit, but, if I could afford to perform a few of these experimental  operations for nothing, at no cost to the patient, I should be glad of  the chance. There is so much yet to be learned in this work.\"          CHAPTER IV    DR. BRINKLEY'S OWN STORY      The +New York American+, issue of March 14, 1920, carried the following  articles:      +GOAT GLANDS SUCCESSFUL+      +Head of Hospital Tells of the Curing of Sterility    by the New Discovery and of Control of Sex    Through Simple Operation--Disease    and Insanity Also Banished.+      +By Dr. W. H. Ballou+    Dr. J. R. Brinkley, head of the Brinkley-Jones Hospital and Training  School for Nurses at Milford, Kansas, has now furnished to the  scientific world what are termed \"ample proof cases\" that by  implantation of the fresh interstitial glands of the goat sterile people  may bear children of either sex desired. Already the town is filling up  with childless people waiting to be operated upon. Incidentally, cases  of insanity are cured within thirty-six hours after a simple operation.  Other diseases also disappear. Milford is a small town 150 miles west of  Kansas City. Here Dr. Brinkley has performed more than 100 major  operations, and more than 300 minor operations, each one a success;  cured more than 1,000 cases of Influenza, without losing a case; and  cured one \"hopeless\" case of sleeping-sickness.    The practice of Dr. Brinkley accords with the investigations of glands  by Professor Arthur Keith, president of the Anthropological Section of  the British Association for the Advancement of Science. Professor Keith  states: \"The interstitial gland has as much to do with the growth, in  certain particulars, as the pituitary gland has in general bodily  growth. All of the changes we see in"]]]
