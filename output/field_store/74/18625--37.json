In this  way, it may happen that, when the width of the tube permits, an Osmia in  a back row will nevertheless be one of the first to emerge.    In the bramble-stem, which is of exactly the same diameter as  the cocoon, this escape by the side of the column appears hardly  practicable, except to a few males; and even these have to find a wall  which has so much pith that by removing it they can effect a passage.  Let us then imagine a tube so narrow as to prevent any exit save in the  natural sequence of the cells. What will happen? A very simple thing.  The newly-hatched Osmia, after perforating his partition, finds himself  faced with an unbroken cocoon that obstructs the road. He makes a few  attempts upon the sides and, realizing his impotence, retires into his  cell, where he waits for days and days, until his neighbour bursts her  cocoon in her turn. His patience is inexhaustible. However, it is not  put to an over long test, for within a week, more or less, the whole  string of females is hatched.    When two neighbouring Osmiae are released at the same time, mutual  visits are paid through the aperture between the two rooms: the one  above goes down to the floor below; the one below goes up to the floor  above; sometimes both of them are in the same cell together. Might not  this intercourse tend to cheer them and encourage them to patience?  Meanwhile, slowly, doors are opening here and there through the  separating walls; the road is cleared by sections; and a moment arrives  when the leader of the file walks out. The others follow, if ready; but  there are always laggards who keep the rear-ranks waiting until they are  gone.    To sum up, first, the hatching of the larvae takes place without any  order; secondly, the exodus proceeds regularly from summit to base, but  only in consequence of the insect's inability to move forward so long  as the upper cells are not vacated. We have here not an exceptional  evolution, in the inverse ratio to age, but the simple impossibility of  emerging otherwise. Should a chance occur of going out before its turn,  the insect does not fail to seize it, as we can see by the lateral  movements which send the impatient ones a few ranks ahead and even  release the more favoured altogether. The only remarkable thing that  I perceive is the scrupulous respect shown to the as yet unopened  neighbouring cocoon. However eager to come out, the Osmia is most  careful not to touch it with his mandibles: it is taboo. He will  demolish the partition, he will gnaw the side-wall fiercely, even though  there be nothing left but wood, he will reduce everything around him to  dust; but touch a cocoon that obstructs his way? Never! He will not make  himself an outlet by breaking up his sisters' cradles.    It may happen that the Osmia's patience is in vain and that the  barricade that blocks the way never disappears at all. Sometimes, the  egg in a cell does not mature; and the unconsumed provisions dry up and  become a compact, sticky, mildewed plug, through which the occupants  of the floors below could never clear themselves a passage. Sometimes,  again, a grub dies in its cocoon; and the cradle of the deceased, now  turned into a coffin, forms an everlasting obstacle. How shall the  insect cope with such grave circumstances?    Among the many bramble-stumps which I have collected, some few have  presented a remarkable peculiarity. In addition to the orifice at the  top, they had at the side one and sometimes two round apertures that  looked as though they had been punched out with an instrument. On  opening these stalks, which were old, deserted nests, I discovered the  cause of these very exceptional windows. Above each of them was a cell  full of mouldy honey. The egg had perished and the provisions remained  untouched: hence the impossibility of getting out by the ordinary road.  Walled in by the unsurmountable obstacle, the Osmia on the floor below  had contrived an outlet through the side of the shaft; and those in the  lower storeys had benefited by this ingenious innovation. The usual  door being inaccessible, a side-window had been opened by means of the  insect's jaws. The cocoons, torn, but still in position in the lower  rooms, left no doubt as to this eccentric mode of exit. The same fact,  moreover, was repeated, in several bramble-stumps, in the case of Osmia  tridentata; it was likewise repeated in the case of Anthidium scapulare.  The observation was worth confirming by experiment.    I select a bramble-stem with the thinnest rind possible, so as to  facilitate the Osmiae's work. I split it in half, thus obtaining a  smooth-sided trough which will enable me to judge better of future  exits. The cocoons are next laid out in one of the troughs. I separate  them with disks of sorghum, covering both surfaces of the disk with a  generous layer of sealing-wax, a material which the Osmia's mandibles  are not able to attack. The two troughs are then placed together and  fastened. A little putty does away with the joint and prevents the  least ray of light from penetrating. Lastly, the apparatus is hung up  perpendicularly, with the cocoons' heads up. We have now only to wait.  None of the Osmiae can get out in the usual manner, because each of them  is confined between two partitions coated with sealing-wax. There is but  one resource left to them if they would emerge into the light of day,  that is, for each of them to open a side-window, provided always that  they possess the instinct and the power to do so.    In July, the result is as follows: of twenty Osmiae thus immured, six  succeed in boring a round hole through the wall and making their way  out; the others perish in their cells, without managing to release  themselves. But, when I open the cylinder, when I separate the two  wooden troughs, I realize that all have attempted to escape through the  side, for the wall of each cell bears traces of gnawing concentrated  upon one spot. All, therefore, have acted in the same way as their more  fortunate sisters; they did not succeed, because their strength failed  them. Lastly, in my glass tubes, part-lined with a thick piece of  packing-paper, I often see attempts at making a window in the side of  the cell: the paper is pierced right through with a round hole.    This then is yet another result which I am glad to record in the history  of the bramble-dwellers. When the Osmia, the Anthidium and probably  others are unable to emerge through the customary outlet, they take  an heroic decision and perforate the side of the shaft. It is the last  resource, resolved upon after other methods have been tried in vain. The  brave, the strong succeed; the weak perish in the attempt.    Supposing that all the Osmiae possessed the necessary strength of jaw as  well as the instinct for this sideward boring, it is clear that egress  from each cell through a special window would be much more advantageous  than egress through the common door. The Bee could attend to his release  as soon as he was hatched, instead of postponing it until after the  emancipation of those who come before him; he would thus escape long  waits, which too often prove fatal. In point of fact, it is no uncommon  thing to find bramble-stalks in which several Osmiae have died in their  cells, because the upper storeys were not vacated in time. Yes, there  would be a precious advantage in that lateral opening, which would not  leave each occupant at the mercy of his environment: many die that would  not die. All the Osmiae, when compelled by circumstances, resort to this  supreme method; all have the instinct for lateral boring; but very few  are able to carry the work through. Only the favourites of fate succeed,  those more generously endowed with strength and perseverance.    If the famous law of natural selection, which is said to govern and  transform the world, had any sure foundation; if really the fittest  removed the less fit from the scene; if the future were to the  strongest, to the most industrious, surely the race of Osmiae, which  has been perforating bramble-stumps for ages, should by this time have  allowed its weaker members, who go on obstinately using the common  outlet, to die out and should have replaced them, down to the very last  one, by the stalwart drillers of side-openings. There is an opportunity  here for immense progress; the insect is on the verge of it and is  unable to cross the narrow intervening line. Selection has had ample  time to make its choice; and yet, though there be a few successes, the  failures exceed them in very large measure. The race of the strong has  not abolished the race of the weak: it remains inferior in numbers,  as doubtless it has been since all time. The law of natural selection  impresses me with the vastness of its scope; but, whenever I try to  apply it to actual facts, it leaves me whirling in space, with nothing  to help me to interpret realities. It is magnificent in theory, but it  is a mere gas-bubble in the face of existing conditions. It is majestic,  but sterile. Then where is the answer to the riddle of the world? Who  knows? Who will ever know?    Let us waste no more time in this darkness, which idle theorizing will  not dispel; let us return to facts, humble facts, the only ground that  does not give way under our feet. The Osmia respects her neighbour's  cocoon; and her scruples are so great that, after vainly trying to slip  between that cocoon and the wall, or else to open a lateral outlet, she  lets herself die in her cell rather than effect an egress by forcing  her way through the occupied cells. When the cocoon that blocks the way  contains a dead instead of a live grub, will the result be the same?    In my glass tubes, I let Osmia-cocoons containing a live grub alternate  with"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34211"],[0,"A Treatise on Physiology and Hygiene (#4)"],[1,"s.              16    3.

THE MUSCLES.    _The Muscles--Flexion and Extension--The Tendons--Contraction--Physical  Strength--Necessity for Exercise--Its Effects--Forms of  Exercise--Walking--Riding--Gymnastics--Open-air  Exercise--Sleep--Recreation._    [Sidenote: 1. What are the muscles? Their number? The design of most of  them? Of a few?]    1. THE MUSCLES.-- The great mass of the body external to the skeleton, is  composed of the flesh, or _Muscles_, which largely determines its outline  and weight. The muscles are the organs of motion. Their number is about  four hundred, and to each of them is assigned a separate and distinct  office. They have all been studied, one by one, and a name given to each,  by the anatomist. Each is attached to bones which it is designed to move. A  few are circular in form, and enclose cavities, the size of which they  diminish by contraction.    [Illustration: FIG. 8.--MUSCULAR TISSUE.    _a_, _b_, Striped muscular fibres: _c_, The same more highly magnified.]    [Sidenote: 2. The structure of flesh? Its color, etc.? The composition of  the fibres? How marked?]    2. If we examine a piece of flesh, we observe that it is soft, and of a  deep red color. Its structure appears to be composed of layers and bundles  of small fibres. Let us further examine these fibres under the microscope.  We now discover that they are, in turn, made up of still finer fibres, of  _fibrillae_: these are seen in Fig. 8. The fibres are beautifully {26}  marked by parallel wavy lines, about ten thousand to an inch, which give  the fibre its name of the _striped_ muscular fibre. All of the voluntary  muscles present this appearance.    [Sidenote: 3. Arrangement of the muscles? Their action? Flexion and  extension? Action of the muscles when we stand erect?]    3. FLEXION AND EXTENSION.--The muscles are, for the most part, so arranged  in pairs, or corresponding sets, that when motion is produced in one  direction by one set, there is, opposite to it, another muscle, or group of  muscles, which brings the limb back to its place. When they act  alternately, a to-and-fro movement results. When a joint is bent, the  motion is called _flexion_; and when it is made straight again, it is  called _extension_. When both sets act equally, and at the same moment, no  motion is produced, but the body or limb is maintained in a fixed position:  this occurs when we stand erect. The muscles which produce extension are  more powerful than those opposite to them.    [Illustration: FIG. 9.--A, Biceps muscle of the arm: B, C, Its tendons.]    [Sidenote: 4. Kinds of muscles? The voluntary? Involuntary? The heart? Give  the example. The hand? Arm?]    4. The muscles are also distinguished, on the other hand, as the voluntary  and involuntary muscles, according as they are, or are not, under the  control of the will. The heart is an example of the involuntary variety. We  cannot change its action in the least by an effort of the will. When we  sleep, and the will ceases to act, the heart continues to beat without  cessation. The voluntary muscles, on the other hand, are such as are used  only when we wish or _will_ to use them--as the muscles of the hand or arm  (Fig. 9).    {27}    [Sidenote: 5. What are the tendons or sinews? Their strength? Color?  Location? Tendon of Achilles? The fable? Muscles of the leg?]    5. THE TENDONS.--Tendons, or sinews, are the extremities of muscles, and  are compactly fastened upon bone. They are very strong, and of a silvery  whiteness. They may be felt just beneath the skin, in certain parts of the  body, when the muscles are being used, as at the bend of the elbow or knee.  The largest tendon of the body is that which is inserted into the heel,  called the tendon of Achilles, after the hero of the Grecian poet, the  fable relating that it was at this point that he received his death-wound,  no other part of his body being vulnerable. The muscles which extend into  the leg unite to form a single and very powerful tendon, and enclose a  small bone called the knee-pan, which, acting like a pulley, greatly  increases their power, and at the same time protects the front of the  knee-joint (Fig. 10).    [Illustration: FIG. 10.--VIEW OF KNEE-JOINT. A, Thigh bone: B, Knee-pan: C,  D, Leg bones.]    [Sidenote: 6. Contraction of the muscles? Bending of the arm or finger?  Other agencies? Automatic movements? In cold-blooded animals?]    6. MUSCULAR CONTRACTION.--The muscles, when acted upon by the appropriate  stimulus, contract, or so change {28} their shape, that their extremities  are brought nearer together. The bending of the arm, or of a finger, is  effected in this manner, by the will; but the will is not the only means of  producing this effect. Electricity, a sharp blow over a muscle, and other  stimuli, also cause it. Contraction does not always cease with life. In  man, after death from cholera, automatic movements of hands and feet have  been observed, lasting not less than an hour. In certain cold-blooded  animals, as the turtle, contraction has been known to take place for  several days after the head has been cut off.    [Sidenote: 7. Contractility? Give the illustration. What was supposed? What  is the case?]    7. The property which, in muscle, enables these movements to take place is  called _contractility_. If we grasp a muscle while in exercise (for  example, the large muscle in the front of the arm), we notice the alternate  swelling and decrease of the muscle, as we move the forearm to and fro. It  was at one time supposed that the muscle actually increased in volume  during contraction. This, however, is not the case; for the muscle, while  gaining in thickness, loses in length in the same proportion; and thus, the  volume remains the same in action and at rest.    [Sidenote: 8. What further in relation to contraction? Weariness of a  muscle? Beating of the heart? Standing and walking?]    8. Contraction is not the permanent, or normal, state of a muscle. It  cannot long remain contracted, but after a shorter or longer time, it  wearies and is obliged to relax. After a short rest, it can then again  contract. It is for this reason that the heart can beat all through life,  night and day, by having, as we shall hereafter see, a brief interval of  rest between successive pulsations. For the same reason, it is more  fatiguing to stand for any great length of time in one position, than to be  walking the same period.    [Sidenote: 9. Muscular power of animals? How tested? Man's power? Horse's?  The comparison?]    9. RELATIVE STRENGTH OF ANIMALS.--The amount of muscular power which  different animals can exert, has {29} been tested by experiment. By  determining the number of pounds which an animal can drag upon a level  surface, and afterward comparing that with its own weight, we can judge of  its muscular force. It is found that man is able to drag a little less than  his own weight. A draught-horse can exert a force equal to about two-thirds  of his weight. The horse, therefore, though vastly heavier than man, is  relatively not so powerful.    [Sidenote: 10. Power of insects? Beetles? Give the conclusion.]    10. Insects are remarkable for their power of carrying objects larger and  heavier than themselves. Many of them can drag ten, and even twenty times  their weight. Some of the beetles have been known to move bodies more than  forty times their own weight. So far, therefore, from it being a fact that  animals have strength in proportion to their weight and bulk, the reverse  of that statement seems to be the law.    [Sidenote: 11. Difference in strength of individuals? How caused?]    11. PHYSICAL STRENGTH.--The difference in strength, as seen in different  individuals, is not due to any original difference in their muscles. Nature  gives essentially the same kind and amount of muscles to each person, and  the power of one, or the weakness of another, arises, in great part, from  the manner in which these organs are used or disused.    [Sidenote: 12. Complaint in relation to degeneracy? How true? How  determined by armor? The fair supposition?]    12. Many authors complain of the physical degeneracy of men at the present  day, as compared with past generations. There is room for doubt as to the  correctness of this statement. Certain experiments have recently been made  with the metallic armor worn seven hundred years ago, by which it is found  that any man, of ordinary height and muscular development, can carry the  armor and wield the weapons of an age supposed to be greatly our superior  in strength.
