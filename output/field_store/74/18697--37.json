It is one of the most striking  pieces in the book.      THE MOUNDS OF AMERICA.          Come to the mounds of death with me. They stretch      From deep to deep, sad, venerable, vast,      Graves of gone empires--gone without a sighn,      Like clouds from heaven. They stretch'd from deep to deep      Before the Roman smote his mailed hand      On the gold portals of the dreaming East;      Before the Pleiad, in white trance of song,      Beyond her choir of stars went wandering.        The great old Trees, rank'd on these hills of death,      Have melancholy hymns about all this;      And when the moon walks her inheritance      With slow, imperial pace, the Trees look up      And chant in solemn cadence. Come and hear.        \"Oh patient Moon! go not behind a cloud,      But listen to our words. We, too, are old,      Though not so old as thou. The ancient towns,      The cities throned far apart like queens,      The shadowy domes, the realms majestical,      Slept in thy younger beams. In every leaf      We hold their dust, a king in every trunk.      We, too, are very old: the wind that wails      In our broad branches, from swart Ethiop come      But now, wail'd in our branches long ago,      Then come from darken'd Calvary. The Hills      Lean'd ghastly at the tale that wan Wind told;      The Streams crept shuddering through the tremulous dark;      The Torrent of the North, from morn till eve,      On his steep ledge hung pausing; and o'er all      Such silence fell, we heard the conscious Rills      Drip slowly in the caves of central Earth.      So were the continents by His crowned grief      Together bound, before that Genoese      Flamed on the dim Atlantic: so have we,      Whose aspect faced the scene, unchallenged right      Of language unto all, while memory holds.        \"O patient Moon! go not behind a cloud,      But hear our words. We know that thou didst see      The whole that we could utter--thou that wert      A worship unto realms beyond the flood--      But we are very lonesome on these mounds,      And speech doth make the burden of sad thought      Endurable; while these, the people new,      That take our land, may haply learn from us      What wonder went before them; for no word      E'er came from thee, so beautiful, so lone.      Throned in thy still domain, superbly calm      And silent as a god.                            Here empires rose and died;      Their very dust, beyond the Atlantic borne      In the pale navies of the charter'd wind,      Stains the white Alp. Here the proud city ranged      Spire after spire, like star ranged after star      Along the dim empyrean, till the air      Went mad with splendor, and the dwellers cried,      \"Our walls have married Time!\"--Gone are the marts,      The insolent citadels, the fearful gates,      The pictured domes that curved like starry skies;      Gone are their very names! The royal Ghost      Cannot discern the old imperial haunts,      But goes about perplexed like a mist      Between a ruin and the awful stars.      Nations are laid beneath our feet. The bard      Who stood in Song's prevailing light, as stands      The apocalyptic angel in the sun,      And rained melodious fire on all the realms;      The prophet pale, who shuddered in his gloom,      As the white cataract shudders in its mist;      The hero shattering an old kingdom down      With one clear trumpet's will: the Boy, the Sage,      Subject and Lord, the Beautiful, the Wise--      Gone, gone to nothingness.                                    The years glide on,      The pitiless years! and all alike shall fail,      State after State rear'd by the solemn sea,      Or where the Hudson goes unchallenged past      The ancient warder of the Palisades,      Or where, rejoicing o'er the enormous cloud,      Beam the blue Alleghanies--all shall fail:      The Ages chant their dirges on the peaks;      The palls are ready in the peopled vales;      And nations fill one common sepulchre.      Nor goes the Earth on her dark way alone.      Each star in yonder vault doth hold the dead      In its funereal deeps: Arcturus broods      Over vast sepulchres that had grown old      Before the earth was made: the universe      Itself is but one mighty cemetery      Rolling around its central, solemn sun.        \"O patient Moon! go not behind a cloud,      But listen to our words. We, too, must die--      And thou!--the vassal stars shall fail to hear      Thy queenly voice over the azure fields      Calling at sunset. They shall fade. The Earth      Shall look and miss their sweet, familiar eyes,      And, crouching, die beneath the feet of GOD.      Then come the glories, then the nobler times,      For which the Orbs travail'd in sorrow; then      The mystery shall be clear, the burden gone;      And surely men shall know why nations came      Transfigured for the pangs; why not a spot      Of this wide world but hath a tale of wo;      Why all this glorious universe is Death's.        \"Go, Moon! and tell the stars, and tell the suns,      Impatient of the wo, the strength of him      Who doth consent to death; and tell the climes      That meet thy mournful eyes, one after one,      Through all the lapses of the lonesome night,      The pathos of repose, the might of Death!\"        The voice is hush'd; the great old wood is still:      The Moon, like one in meditation, walks      Behind a cloud. We, too, have them for thought,      While, as a sun, GOD takes the West of Time      And smites the pyramid of Eternity.      The shadow lengthens over many worlds      Doom'd to the dark mausoleum and mound.    We do not remember any poem on Mahomet finer than the following:      EL AMIN.        Who is this that comes from Hara? not in kingly pomp and pride,      But a great, free son of Nature, lion-souled and eagle-eyed!        Who is this before whose presence idols tumble to the sod?      While he cries out--\"Allah Akbar! and there is no god but God!\"      Wandering in the solemn desert, he has wondered like a child      Not as yet too proud to wonder, at the sun, and star, and wild.        \"Oh, thou moon! who made thy brightness? Stars! who hung you there on high?      Answer! so my soul may worship: I must worship or die!\"        Then there fell the brooding silence that precedes the thunder's roll;      And the old Arabian Whirlwind called another Arab soul.        Who is this that comes from Hara? not in kingly pomp and pride,      But a great, free son of Nature, lion-souled and eagle-eyed!        He has stood and seen Mount Hara to the Awful Presence nod;      He has heard from cloud and lightning--\"Know there is no god but God!\"        Call ye this man an imposter? He was called \"The Faithful,\" when,      A boy, he wandered o'er the deserts, by the wild-eyed Arab men.        He was always called \"The Faithful.\" Truth he knew was Allah's breath;      But the Lie went darkly gnashing through the corridors of Death.        \"He was fierce!\" Yes! fierce at falsehood--fierce at hideous bits of wood,      That the Koreish taught the people made the sun and solitude.        But his heart was also gentle, and Affection's graceful palm,      Waving in his tropic spirit, to the weary brought a balm.        \"Precepts?\" \"Have on each compassion:\" \"Lead the stranger to your door:\"      \"In your dealings keep up justice:\" \"Give a tenth unto the poor.\"        \"Yet ambitious!\" Yes! ambitious--while he heard the calm and sweet      Aiden-voices sing--to trample troubled Hell beneath his feet.        \"Islam?\" Yes! \"Submit to Heaven!\" \"Prophet?\" To the East thou art!      What are prophets but the trumpets blown by God to stir the heart?        And the great heart of the desert stirred unto that solemn strain,      Rolling from the trump at Hara over Error's troubled main.        And a hundred dusky millions honor still El Amin's rod--      Daily chanting--\"Allah Akbar! know there is no god but God!\"        Call him then no more \"Impostor.\" Mecca is the Choral Gate      Where, till Zion's noon shall take them, nations in her morning wait.    Mr. Wallace has published a few songs. They have not the stately movement  of his other pieces, and the one which follows needs the application of the  file; but it is, like the others, very spirited:      AVELINE.        ----The sunny eyes of the maiden fair      Give answer better than voice or pen      That as he loves he is loved again.--C. C. LEEDS.        Love me dearly, love me dearly with your heart and with your eyes;      Whisper all your sweet emotions, as they gushing, blushing rise;      Throw your soft white arms about me;      Say you cannot live without me:      Say, you are my Aveline; say, that you are only mine,      That you cannot live without me, young and rosy Aveline!        Love me dearly, dearly, dearly: speak you love-words silver-clearly,      So I may not doubt thus early of your fondness, of your truth.      Press, oh! press your throbbing bosom closely, warmly to my own:      Fix your kindled eyes on mine--say you live for me alone,      While I fix my eyes on thine,      Lovely, trusting, artless, plighted; plighted, rosy Aveline!        Love me dearly; love me dearly: radiant dawn upon my gloom:      Ravish me with Beauty's bloom:--      Tell me \"Life has yet a glory: 'tis not all an idle story!\"      As a gladdened vale in noonlight; as a weary lake in moonlight,      Let me in thy love recline:      Show me life has yet a splendor in my tender Aveline.        Love me dearly, dearly, dearly with your heart and with your eyes:      Whisper all your sweet emotions as they gushing, blushing rise.      Throw your soft white arms around me; say you _lived not_ till you found me--      Say it, say it, Aveline! whisper you are only mine;      That you cannot live without me, as you throw your arms about me,      That you _cannot_ live"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37937"],[0,"A Wanderer in Paris (#4)"],[1,"steamers and no storied quais. The Seine has all the advantage when we  come to the consideration of what can be done with a river's banks in  a great city. For the Seine has a mile of old book and curiosity  stalls, whereas the Thames has nothing.    And yet the coping of the Thames embankment is as suitable for such a  purpose as that of the Seine, and as many Londoners are fond of books.  How is it? Why should all the bookstalls and curiosity stalls of  London be in Whitechapel and Farringdon Street and the Cattle Market?  That is a mystery which I have never solved and never shall. Why are  the West Central and the West districts wholly debarred--save in  Charing Cross Road, and that I believe is suspect--from loitering at  such alluring street banquets? It is beyond understanding.    The history of the stall-holders of the quais has been told very  engagingly by M. Octave Uzanne, whom one might describe as the Austin  Dobson and the Augustine Birrell of France, in his work _Bouquinistes  et Bouquineurs_. They established themselves first on the Pont Neuf,  but in 1650 were evicted. (The Paris bridges, I might say here, become  at the present time the resort of every kind of pedlar directly  anything occurs to suspend their traffic.)    The parapets of the quais then took the place of those of the bridge,  and there the booksellers' cases have been ever since. But no longer  are they the gay resort that once they were. It was considered, says  M. Uzanne, writing of the eighteenth century, \"quite the correct thing  for the promenaders to gossip round the bookstalls and discuss the wit  and fashionable writings of the day. At all hours of the day these  quarters were much frequented, above all by literary men, lawyers  clerks and foreigners. One historical fact, not generally known,  merits our attention, for it shows that not only the libraries and the  stall-keepers assisted in drawing men of letters to the vicinity of  the Hotel Mazarin, but there also existed a 'rendez-vous' for the sale  of English and French journals. It was, in fact, at the corner of the  Rue Dauphine and the Quai Conti that the first establishment known as  the Cafe Anglais was started. One read in big letters on the  signboard: Cafe Anglais--Becket, proprietaire. This was the meeting  place of the greater part of English writers visiting Paris who  wished to become acquainted with the literary men of the period, the  encyclopaedists and poets of the Court of Louis XV. This Cafe offered  to its habitues the best-known English papers of the day, the  _Westminster Gazette_, the _London Evening Post_, the _Daily  Advertiser_, and the various pamphlets published on the other side of  the Channel....    \"You must know that the Quai Conti up to the year 1769 was only a  narrow passage leading down to a place for watering horses. Between  the Pont Neuf and the building known as the Chateau-Gaillard at the  opening of the Rue Guenegaud, were several small shops, and a small  fair continually going on.    \"This Chateau-Gaillard, which was a dependency of the old Porte de  Nesle, had been granted by Francis I. to Benvenuto Cellini. The famous  Florentine goldsmith received visits from the Sovereign protector of  arts and here executed the work he had been ordered to do, under his  Majesty's very eyes....    \"One calls to mind that Sterne, in his delightful _Sentimental  Journey_, was set down in 1767 at the Hotel de Modene, in the Rue  Jacob, opposite the Rue des Deux-Anges, and one has not forgotten his  love for the quais and the adventure which befell him while chatting  to a bookseller on the Quai Conti, of whom he wished to buy a copy of  Shakespeare so that he might read once more Polonius' advice to his  son before starting on his travels.    \"Diderot, in his _Salon_ of 1761, relates his flirtation with the  pretty girl who served in one of these shops and afterwards became  the wife of Menze. 'She called herself Miss Babuti and kept a small  book shop on the Quai des Augustins, spruce and upright, white as a  lily and red as a rose. I would enter her shop, in my own brisk way:  \"Mademoiselle, the 'Contes de la Fontaine' ... a 'Petronius' if you  please.\"--\"Here you are, Sir. Do you want any other books?\"--\"Forgive  me, yes\"--\"What is it?\"--\"La 'Religieuse en Chemise.'\"--\"For shame,  Sir! Do you read such trash?\"--\"Trash, is it, Mademoiselle? I did not  know....\"'\"      [Illustration: THE NATIVITY      LUINI      (_Louvre_)]    M. Uzanne's pages are filled with such charming gossip and with  character-sketches of the most famous booksellers and book-hunters.  One pretty trait that would have pleased Mary Lamb (and perhaps did,  in 1822, when her brother took her to the \"Boro' side of the Seine\")  is mentioned by M. Uzanne: \"The stall-keeper on the quais always has  an indulgent eye for the errand boy or the little bonne [slavey] who  stops in front of his stall and consults gratis 'La Clef des Songes'  or 'Le Secretaire des Dames'. Who would not commend him for this kind  toleration? In fact it is very rare to find the bookseller in such  cases not shutting his eyes--metaphorically--and refraining from  walking up to the reader, for fear of frightening her away. And then  the young girl moves off with a light step, repeating to herself the  style of letter or the explanation of a dream, rich in hope and  illusions for the rest of the day.\"    But the best description of the book-hunter of the quais is that  given to Dumas by Charles Nodier. \"This animal,\" he said, \"has two  legs and is featherless, wanders usually up and down the quais and the  boulevards, stopping at all the old bookstalls, turning over every  book on them; he is habitually clad in a coat that is too long for him  and trousers that are too short; he always wears on his feet shoes  that are down at the heel, a dirty hat on his head, and, under his  coat and over his trousers, a waistcoat fastened together with string.  One of the signs by which he can be recognised is that he never washes  his hands.\"    Henri IV.'s statue faces the Place Dauphine and the west facade of the  Palais de Justice. At No. 28 in the Place Dauphine Madame Roland was  born, little thinking she was destined one day to be imprisoned in the  neighbouring Conciergerie, which, to those who can face the  difficulties of obtaining a ticket of admission, is one of the most  interesting of the Island's many interesting buildings. But the  process is not easy, and there is only one day in the week on which  the prison is shown.    The tickets are issued at the Prefecture of Police--the Scotland Yard  of Paris--which is the large building opposite Sainte Chapelle. One  may either write or call. I advise writing; for calling is not as  simple as it sounds: simplicity and sightseeing in Paris being indeed  not on the best terms. It was not until I had asked five several  officials that I found even the right door of the vast structure, and  then having passed a room full of agents (or policemen) smoking and  jesting, and having climbed to a third storey, I was in danger of  losing for ever the privilege of seeing what I had fixed my mind upon,  wholly because, although I knew the name and street of my hotel, I did  not know its number. Who ever dreamed that hotels have numbers? Has  the Savoy a number in the Strand? Is the Ritz numbered in Piccadilly?  Not that I was living in any such splendour, but still, on the face of  it, a hotel has a name because it has no number. \"C'est egal,\" the  gentleman said at last, after a pantomime of impossibility and  reproach, and I took my ticket, bowed to the ground, replaced my hat  and was free to visit the Conciergerie on the morrow. Such are the  amenities of the tourist's life.    Let me here say that the agents of Paris are by far its politest  citizens, and in appearance the healthiest. I have never met an  uncivil agent, and I once met one who refused a tip after he had been  of considerable service to me. Never did I attempt to tip another.  They have their defects, no doubt: they have not the authority that we  give our police: their management of traffic is pathetically  incompetent; but they are street gentlemen and the foreigner has no  better friend.    The Conciergerie is the building on the Quai de l'Horloge with the  circular towers beneath extinguishers--an impressive sight from the  bridges and the other bank of the river. Most of its cells are now  used as rooms for soldiers (Andre Chenier's dungeon is one of their  kitchens); but a few rooms of the deepest historical interest have  been left as they were. These are displayed by a listless guide who  rises to animation only when the time comes to receive his benefice  and offer for sale a history of his preserves.    One sees first the vaulted Salle Saint Louis, called the Salle des Pas  Perdus because it was through it that the victims of the Revolution  walked on their way to the Cour de Mai and execution. The terribly  significant name has since passed to the great lobby of the Palais de  Justice immediately above it, where it has less appropriateness. It is  of course the cell of Marie Antoinette that is the most poignant spot  in this grievous place. When the Queen was here the present room was  only about half its size, having a partition across it, behind which  two soldiers were continually on guard, day and night. The Queen was  kept here, suffering every kind of indignity and petty tyranny, from  early September, 1793, until October 16th. Her chair, in which she sat  most of the time, faced the window of the courtyard.    A few acts of kindness reached her in spite of the vigilance of the  authorities; but very few. I quote the account of two from the  official guide, a poor thing, which I was weak enough to buy: \"The  Queen had no complaint to make against the concierges Richard nor  their successors the Baults. It is told that one day Richard asked a  fruitseller in the"]]]
