[Illustration: SCENE AT A GREEK INN.]    As all cooking and eating had stopped at the sound of the morning cannon,  we found great difficulty in gathering together even a cold breakfast of  _ekmek_, _yaourt_, and raisins. Ekmek is a cooked bran-flour paste, which  has the thinness, consistency, and almost the taste of blotting-paper.  This is the Turkish peasant's staff of life. He carries it with him  everywhere; so did we. As it was made in huge circular sheets, we would  often punch a hole in the middle, and slip it up over our arms. This we  found the handiest and most serviceable mode of transportation, being  handy to eat without removing our hands from the handle-bars, and also  answering the purpose of sails in case of a favoring wind. Yaourt, another  almost universal food, is milk curdled with rennet. This, as well as all  foods that are not liquid, they scoop up with a roll of ekmek, a part of  the scoop being taken with every mouthful. Raisins here, as well as in  many other parts of the country, are very cheap. We paid two piasters  (about nine cents) for an _oche_ (two and a half pounds), but we soon made  the discovery that a Turkish oche contained a great many \"stones\"--which of  course was purely accidental. Eggs, also, we found exceedingly cheap. On  one occasion, twenty-five were set before us, in response to our call for  eggs to the value of one piaster--four and a half cents. In Asiatic Turkey  we had some extraordinary dishes served to us, including daintily prepared  leeches. But the worst mixture, perhaps, was the \"Bairam soup,\" which  contains over a dozen ingredients, including peas, prunes, walnuts,  cherries, dates, white and black beans, apricots, cracked wheat, raisins,  etc.--all mixed in cold water. Bairam is the period of feasting after the  Ramadan fast.      [Illustration: EATING KAISERICHEN (EKMEK) OR BREAD.]    On preparing to leave Kirshehr after our frugal breakfast we found that  Turkish curiosity had extended even to the contents of our baggage, which  fitted in the frames of the machines. There was nothing missing, however:  and we did not lose so much as a button during our sojourn among them.  Thieving is not one of their faults, but they take much latitude in  helping themselves. Many a time an inn-keeper would \"help us out\" by  disposing of one third of a chicken that we had paid him a high price to  prepare.    When we were ready to start the chief of police cleared a riding space  through the streets, which for an hour had been filled with people. As we  passed among them they shouted \"Oorooglar olsun\" (\"May good fortune attend  you\"). \"Inshallah\" (\"If it please God\"), we replied, and waved our helmets  in acknowledgment.      [Illustration: GRINDING WHEAT.]      [Illustration: A TURKISH (HAMAAL) OR CARRIER.]    At the village of Topakle, on the following night, our reception was not  so innocent and good-natured. It was already dusk when we reached the  outskirts of the village, where we were at once spied by a young man who  was driving in the lowing herd. The alarm was given, and the people  swarmed like so many rats from a corn-bin. We could see from their costume  and features that they were not pure-blooded Turks. We asked if we could  get food and lodging, to which they replied, \"Evet, evet\" (\"Yes, yes\"),  but when we asked them where, they simply pointed ahead, and shouted,  \"Bin, bin!\" We did not \"bin\" this time, because it was too dark, and the  streets were bad. We walked, or rather were pushed along by the impatient  rabble, and almost deafened by their shouts of \"Bin, bin!\" At the end of  the village we repeated our question of where. Again they pointed ahead,  and shouted, \"Bin!\" Finally an old man led us to what seemed to be a  private residence, where we had to drag our bicycles up a dark narrow  stairway to the second story. The crowd soon filled the room to  suffocation, and were not disposed to heed our request to be left alone.  One stalwart youth showed such a spirit of opposition that we were obliged  to eject him upon a crowded stairway, causing the mob to go down like a  row of tenpins. Then the owner of the house came in, and in an agitated  manner declared he could not allow us to remain in his house overnight.  Our reappearance caused a jeering shout to go up from the crowd; but no  violence was attempted beyond the catching hold of the rear wheel when our  backs were turned, and the throwing of clods of earth. They followed us,  _en masse_, to the edge of the village, and there stopped short, to watch  us till we disappeared in the darkness. The nights at this high altitude  were chilly. We had no blankets, and not enough clothing to warrant a camp  among the rocks. There was not a twig on the whole plateau with which to  build a fire. We were alone, however, and that was rest in itself. After  walking an hour, perhaps, we saw a light gleaming from a group of mudhuts  a short distance off the road. From the numerous flocks around it, we took  it to be a shepherds' village. Everything was quiet except the restless  sheep, whose silky fleece glistened in the light of the rising moon.  Supper was not yet over, for we caught a whiff of its savory odor. Leaving  our wheels outside, we entered the first door we came to, and, following  along a narrow passageway, emerged into a room where four rather  rough-looking shepherds were ladling the soup from a huge bowl in their  midst. Before they were aware of our presence, we uttered the usual  salutation \"Sabala khayr olsun.\" This startled some little boys who were  playing in the corner, who yelled, and ran into the haremluek, or women's  apartment. This brought to the door the female occupants, who also uttered  a shriek, and sunk back as if in a swoon. It was evident that the visits  of giaours to this place had been few and far between. The shepherds  returned our salutation with some hesitation, while their ladles dropped  into the soup, and their gaze became fixed on our huge helmets, our  dogskin top-coats, and abbreviated nether garments. The women by this time  had sufficiently recovered from their nervous shock to give scope to their  usual curiosity through the cracks in the partition. Confidence now being  inspired by our own composure, we were invited to sit down and participate  in the evening meal. Although it was only a gruel of sour milk and rice,  we managed to make a meal off it. Meantime the wheels had been discovered  by some passing neighbor. The news was spread throughout the village, and  soon an excited throng came in with our bicycles borne upon the shoulders  of two powerful Turks. Again we were besieged with entreaties to ride,  and, hoping that this would gain for us a comfortable night's rest, we  yielded, and, amid peals of laughter from a crowd of Turkish peasants,  gave an exhibition in the moonlight. Our only reward, when we returned to  our quarters, was two greasy pillows and a filthy carpet for a coverlet.  But the much needed rest we did not secure, for the suspicions aroused by  the first glance at our bed-cover proved to be well grounded.      [Illustration: TURKISH WOMEN GOING TO PRAYERS IN KAISARIEH.]    About noon on April 20, our road turned abruptly into the broad caravan  trail that runs between Smyrna and Kaisarieh, about ten miles west of the  latter city. A long caravan of camels was moving majestically up the road,  headed by a little donkey, which the _devedejee_ (camel-driver) was riding  with his feet dangling almost to the ground. That proverbially stubborn  creature moved not a muscle until we came alongside, when all at once he  gave one of his characteristic side lurches, and precipitated the rider to  the ground. The first camel, with a protesting grunt, began to sidle off,  and the broadside movement continued down the line till the whole caravan  stood at an angle of about forty-five degrees to the road. The camel of  Asia Minor does not share that antipathy for the equine species which is  so general among their Asiatic cousins; but steel horses were more than  even they could endure.      [Illustration: THE \"FLIRTING TOWER\" IN SIVAS.]    A sudden turn in the road now brought us in sight of old Arjish Dagh,  which towers 13,000 feet above the city of Kaisarieh, and whose head and  shoulders were covered with snow. Native tradition tells us that against  this lofty summit the ark of Noah struck in the rising flood; and for this  reason Noah cursed it, and prayed that it might ever be covered with snow.  It was in connection with this very mountain that we first conceived the  idea of making the ascent of Ararat. Here and there, on some of the most  prominent peaks, we could distinguish little mounds of earth, the ruined  watch-towers of the prehistoric Hittites.      [Illustration: HOUSE OF THE AMERICAN CONSUL IN SIVAS.]    Kaisarieh (ancient Caesarea) is filled with the ruins and the monuments of  the fourteenth-century Seljuks. Arrowheads and other relics are every day  unearthed there, to serve as toys for the street urchins. Since the  development of steam-communication around the coast, it is no longer the  caravan center that it used to be; but even now its _charshi_, or inclosed  bazaars, are among the finest in Turkey, being far superior in appearance  to those of Constantinople. These _charshi_ are nothing more than narrow  streets, inclosed by brick arches, and lined on either side with booths.  It was through one of these that our only route to the khan lay--and yet we  felt that in such contracted quarters, and in such an excited mob as had  gathered around us, disaster was sure to follow. Our only salvation was to  keep ahead of the jam, and get through as soon as possible. We started on  the spurt; and the race began. The unsuspecting merchants and their  customers were suddenly distracted from their"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31162"],[0,"The International Monthly, Volume 5, No. 3, March, 1852 (#4)"],[1,"rinters, first       editions of Shakspeare, early pageants, and the rarest dramatic       and other popular literature of the Elizabethan era, may be       found in this well-ordered room--not to speak of its great       treasure, the _Liber Veritalus_ of Claude.    [Illustration: QUEEN MARY'S BOWER.]         \"The statue gallery, a noble room erected by the present Duke,       contains a judiciously-selected series of sculptures. The gem       of the collection is the famous seated statue of Madame       Bonaparte, mother of Napoleon, by Canova. The same style       characterizes that of Pauline Borghese, by Campbell. Other       works of Canova are here--his statue of Hebe, and Endymion       sleeping; a bust of Petrarch's Laura, and the famous Lions,       copied by Benaglia from the colossal originals on the monument       of Clement XIV., at Rome. Thorwaldsen is abundantly represented       by his Night and Morning, and his bas-reliefs of Priam       Petitioning for the Body of Hector, and Briseis, taken from       Achilles by the Heralds. Schadow's Filatrice, or Spinning Girl,       and his classic bas-reliefs are worthy of all admiration. The       English school of sculpture appears to advantage in Gibson's       fine group, Mars and Cupid, and his bas-relief of Hero and       Leander--Chantry's busts of George IV. and       Canning--Westmacott's Cymbal Plaery--Wyatt's Musidora, and many       others.         \"Our visit to the mansion may conclude with a brief notice of       one of its most interesting relics. Queen Mary's Bower is a sad       memorial of the unhappy Queen's fourteen years' imprisonment       here. It has been quaintly described as 'an island plat, on the       top of a square tower, built in a large pool.' It is reached by       a bridge, and in this lonely island-garden did Mary pass many       days of a captivity, rendered doubly painful by the jealous       bickerings of the Countess of Shrewsbury, who openly complained       to Elizabeth of the Queen's intimacy with her husband; an       unfounded aspersion, which Mary's urgent solicitations to       Elizabeth obliged the Countess to retract, but which led to       Mary's removal from the Earl's custody to that of Sir Amias       Pawlet.    [Illustration: THE HUNTING TOWER.]         \"To the Hunting-Tower on the hill above the house, the ascent       is by a road winding gracefully among venerable trees, planted       'when Elizabeth was Queen,' and occasionally passing beside a       fall of water, which dashes among rocks from the moors above.       The tower stands on the edge of the steep and thickly-wooded       hill; it is built on a platform of stone, reached by a few       steps; it is one of the relics of old Chatsworth, and is a       characteristic and curious feature of the scene. Such towers       were frequently placed near lordly residences in the olden       time, for the purpose 'of giving the ladies of those days an       opportunity of enjoying the sport of hunting,' which, from the       heights above, they saw in the vales beneath. The view from the       tower is one of the finest in England. The house and grounds       below, embosomed in foliage, peep through the umbrage far       beneath your feet; the rapid Derwent courses along through the       level valley. The wood opposite crowns the rising ground, above       Edensor--the picturesque and beautiful village within whose       humble church many members of the noble family are buried. The       village itself may be considered as a model of taste; it       resembles a group of Italian and Gothic villas, the utmost       variety and the most picturesque styles of architecture being       adopted for their construction, while the little flower-gardens       before them are as carefully tended as those at Chatsworth       itself. Upon the hills above are traces of Roman encampments,       and from the summit you look down upon the beautiful village       of Bakewell, and far-famed Haddon Hall--the antique residence       of the dukes of Rutland, an unspoiled relic of the sixteenth       century. Looking toward the north, the eye traverses the       fertile and beautiful valley of the Derwent, with the quiet       little villages of Pilsley, Hassop, and Baslow, consisting of       groups of cottages and quiet homesteads, speaking of pastoral       life in its most favorable aspect. The eye, following the       direction of the stream, is carried over the village of Calver,       beyond which the rocks of Stony Middleton converge and shut in       the prospect, with their gates of stone; amid distant trees,       the village of Eyam, celebrated for its mournful story of the       plague, and the heroism of its pastor, is embosomed. The ridge       of rock stretches around the plain to the right, and upon the       moors are traces of the early Britons in circles of stones and       tumuli, with various other singular and deeply-interesting       relics of 'the far off past.' Turning to the south, the       prospect is bounded by the hills of Matlock; the villages of       Darley-le-Dale, and Rowsley, reposing in mid-distance; the       entire prospect comprising a series of picturesque mountains,       fertile plains, wood, water, and rock, which cannot be       surpassed in the world for variety and beauty. The noble domain       in the foreground forming the grand centre of the whole:        \"'This palace, with wild prospects girded round,      Where the scorn'd Peak rivals proud Italy.'         \"It was evening when we ascended this charming hill, and stood       beneath the shadow of its famous Hunting Tower. The sun had       just set, leaving a landscape of immense extent sleeping       beneath rose-colored clouds; the air was balmy and fragrant       with the peculiar odor of the pine-trees which topped the       summit of the promontory on which we stood. We were told of       Taddington Hill--of Beeley Edge--of Brampton Moor--of Robin       Hood's bar--of Froggat Edge--until our eyes ached from the       desire to distinguish the one from the other. There was Tor       this, and Dale that, and such a hall and such a hamlet; but the       stillness by which we were surrounded had become so delicious       that we longed to enjoy it in solitude.    [Illustration: THE BRIDGE ACROSS THE DERWENT.]         \"What pen can tell of the beams of light that played on the       highlands, when, after the fading of that gorgeous sunset, the       valley became steeped in a soft blue-gray color, so tender, and       clear and pure, that it conveyed the idea of 'atmosphere' to       perfection. Then, as the shadows, the soothing shadows of       evening, increased around us, the woods seemed to melt into the       mountains; the rivers veiled their course by their misty       incense to the heavens--wreath after wreath of vapor creeping       upwards; and as the distances faded into indistinctness, the       bold headlands seemed to grow and prop the clouds; the heavens       let down the pall of mystery and darkness with a tender, not       terrific, power; earth and sky blended together, softly and       gently; the coolness of the air refreshed us, and yet the       stillness on that high point was so intense as to become almost       painful. As we looked into the valley, lights sprung up in       cottage dwellings; and then, softly on a wandering breeze, came       at intervals the tolling of a deep bell from the venerable       church at Edensor, a token that some one had been summoned to       another home--perhaps in one of those pale stars that at first       singly, but then in troops, were beaming on us from the pale       blue sky.         \"While slowly descending from our eyrie, amid the varied       shadows of a most lustrous moonlight, our eyes fell upon the       distant wood which surrounded Haddon Hall; its massive walls,       its mouldering tapestries, its stately terrace, its quaint       rooms and closets, its protected though decayed records of the       olden time, its minstrel gallery--were again present to our       minds; and it was a natural and most pleasing contrast--that of       the deserted and half-ruined house, with the mansion happily       inhabited, filled with so many art-treasures, and presided       over by one of the best gentlemen a monarch ever ennobled and a       people ever loved.\"    [Illustration: THE MOORISH SUMMER HOUSE.]    FOOTNOTES:    [1] A quaint whim of the olden time is constructed near one of the  walks; it is the model of a willow-tree in copper, which has all the  appearance of a living one, situated on a raised mound of earth. From  each branch, however, water suddenly bursts, and also small jets from  the grassy borders around. It was considered a good jest some years ago  to delude novices to examine this tree, and wet them thoroughly by  suddenly turning on the water above and around them. This tree was  originally made by a London plumber in 1693; but it has been recently  repaired by a plumber in the neighborhood of Chesterfield, under the  direction of Sir Joseph Paxton.          MEN AND WOMEN OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY.      We have _Louis Quinze_ chairs in our parlors, Louis Quinze carving and  gilding about our mirrors, our ladies (in a double sense, of grace and  utility), sweep past us in the streets or rustle in the ball-room in  Louis Quinze brocades, with the boddice, if not the train, of pattern  identical with that of Madame de Pompadour, as depicted in the excellent  portrait before us in Mr. Redfield's elegant volumes, and we are, if  scandal does not lie more than usual, making very practical acquaintance  with Louis Quinze morals. It may be as well, therefore, to become more  familiar with a period we find it so convenient to imitate. The great  events of French history since 1789, their rapid sequence and ever  varying character, have thrown into the shade the previous annals of the "]]]
