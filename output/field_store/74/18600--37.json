Spenser described the office of the Graces thus:--      \"These three on men all gracious gifts bestow    Which deck the body or adorn the mind,    To make them lovely or well-favored show;    As comely carriage, entertainment kind,    Sweet semblance, friendly offices that bind,    And all the compliments of courtesy;    They teach us how to each degree and kind    We should ourselves demean, to low, to high.    To friends, to foes; which skill men call Civility.\"    The Fates were also three   Clotho, Lachesis, and Atropos.  Their  office was to spin the thread of human destiny, and they were  armed with shears, with which they cut it off when they pleased.  They were the daughters of Themis (Law), who sits by Jove on his  throne to give him counsel.    The Erinnyes, or Furies, were three goddesses who punished crimes  by their secret stings.  The heads of the Furies were wreathed  with serpents, and their whole appearance was terrific and  appalling.  Their names were Alecto, Tisiphone, and Megaera.  They were also called Eumenides.    Nemesis was also an avenging goddess.  She represents the  righteous anger of the gods, particularly towards the proud and  insolent.    Pan [the name Pan means everything, and he is sometimes spoken of  as the god of all nature] was the god of flocks and shepherds.  His favorite residence, as the Greeks describe him, was in  Arcadia.    The Satyrs were deities of the woods and fields.  They were  conceived to be covered with bristly hair, their heads decorated  with short, sprouting horns, and their feet like goats' feet.    Momus was the god of laughter, and Plutus the god of wealth.    ROMAN DIVINITIES    The preceding are Grecian divinities, though received also by the  Romans.  Those which follow are peculiar to Roman mythology.    Saturn was an ancient Italian deity.  The Roman poets tried to  identify him with the Grecian god Kronos, and fabled that after  his dethronement by Jupiter, he fled to Italy, where he reigned  during what was called the Golden Age.  In memory of his  beneficent dominion, the feast of Saturnalia was held every year  in the winter season.  Then all public business was suspended,  declarations of war and criminal executions were postponed,  friends made presents to one another, and the slaves were  indulged with great liberties.  A feast was given them at which  they sat at table, while their masters served them, to show the  natural equality of men, and that all things belonged equally to  all, in the reign of Saturn.    Faunus [there was also a goddess called Fauna, or Bona Dea], the  grandson of Saturn, was worshipped as the god of fields and  shepherds, and also as a prophetic god.  His name in the plural,  Fauns, expressed a class of gamesome deities, like the Satyrs of  the Greeks.    Quirinus was a war god, said to be no other than Romulus the  founder of Rome, exalted after his death to a place among the  gods.    Bellona, a war goddess.    Terminus, the god of landmarks.  His statue was a rude stone or  post, set in the ground to mark the boundaries of fields.    Pales, the goddess presiding over cattle and pastures.    Pomona presided over fruit trees.    Flora, the goddess of flowers.    Lucina, the goddess of childbirth.    Vesta (the Hestia of the Greeks) was a deity presiding over the  public and private hearth.  A sacred fire, tended by six virgin  priestesses called Vestals, flamed in her temple.  As the safety  of the city was held to be connected with its conservation, the  neglect of the virgins, if they let it go out, was severely  punished, and the fire was rekindled from the rays of the sun.    Liber is another Latin name of Bacchus; and Mulciber of Vulcan.    Janus was the porter of heaven.  He opens the year, the first  month being named after him.  He is the guardian deity of gates,  on which account he is commonly represented with two heads,  because every door looks two ways.  His temples at Rome were  numerous.  In war time the gates of the principal one were always  open.  In peace they were closed; but they were shut only once  between the reign of Numa and that of Augustus.    The Penates were the gods who were supposed to attend to the  welfare and prosperity of the family.  Their name is derived from  Penus, the pantry, which was sacred to them.  Every master of a  family was the priest to the Penates of his own house.    The Lares, or Lars, were also household gods, but differed from  the Penates in being regarded as the deified spirits of mortals.  The family Lars were held to be the souls of the ancestors, who  watched over and protected their descendants.  The words Lemur  and Larva more nearly correspond to our word Ghost.    The Romans believed that every man had his Genius, and every  woman her Juno; that is, a spirit who had given them being, and  was regarded as a protector through life.  On birthdays men made  offerings to their Genius, women to their Juno.    Macaulay thus alludes to some of the Roman gods:--      \"Pomona loves the orchard,    And Liber loves the vine,    And Pales loves the straw-built shed    Warm with the breath of kine;    And Venus loves the whisper    Of plighted youth and maid    In April's ivory moonlight,    Beneath the Chestnut shade.\"    \"Prophecy of Capys.\"    N.B.  It is to be observed that in proper names the final e and  es are to be sounded.  Thus Cybele and Penates are words of three  syllables.  But Proserpine and Thebes have been so long used as  English words, that they may be regarded as exceptions, to be  pronounced as if English.  Hecate is sometimes pronounced by the  poets as a dissylable.  In the Index at the close of the volume,  we shall mark the accented syllable, in all words which appear to  require it.        CHAPTER II    Prometheus and Pandora    The Roman poet Ovid gives us a connected narrative of creation.  Before the earth and sea and the all-covering heaven, one aspect,  which we call Chaos, covered all the face of Nature,-- a rough  heap of inert weight and discordant beginnings of things clashing  together.  As yet no sun gave light to the world, nor did the  moon renew her slender horn month by month,-- neither did the  earth hang in the surrounding air, poised by its own weight,--  nor did the sea stretch its long arms around the earth.  Wherever  there was earth, there was also sea and air.  So the earth was  not solid nor was the water fluid, neither was the air  transparent.    God and Nature at last interposed and put an end to this discord,  separating earth from sea, and heaven from both.  The fiery part,  being the lightest, sprang up, and formed the skies; the air was  next in weight and place.  The earth, being heavier, sank below,  and the water took the lowest place and buoyed up the earth.    Here some god, no man knows who, arranged and divided the land.  He placed the rivers and bays, raised mountains and dug out  valleys and distributed woods, fountains, fertile fields and  stony plains.  Now that the air was clear the stars shone out,  the fishes swam the sea and birds flew in the air, while the  four-footed beasts roamed around the earth.  But a nobler animal  was needed, and man was made in the image of the gods with an  upright stature [The two Greek words for man have the root an,  \"up], so that while all other animals turn their faces downward  and look to the earth, he raises his face to heaven and gazes on  the stars [Every reader will be interested in comparing this  narrative with that in the beginning of Genesis.  It seems clear  that so many Jews were in Rome in Ovid's days, many of whom were  people of consideration among those with whom he lived, that he  may have heard the account in the Hebrew Scriptures translated.  Compare JUDAISM by Prof. Frederic Huidekoper.]    To Prometheus the Titan and to his brother Epimetheus was  committed the task of making man and all other animals, and of  endowing them with all needful faculties.  This Epimetheus did,  and his brother overlooked the work.  Epimetheus then gave to the  different animals their several gifts of courage, strength,  swiftness and sagacity.  He gave wings to one, claws to another,  a shelly covering to the third.  Man, superior to all other  animals, came last.  But for man Epimetheus had nothing,-- he had  bestowed all his gifts elsewhere.  He came to his brother for  help, and Prometheus, with the aid of Minerva, went up to heaven,  lighted his torch at the chariot of the sun, and brought down  fire to man.  With this, man was more than equal to all other  animals.  Fire enabled him to make weapons to subdue wild beasts,  tools with which to till the earth.  With fire he warmed his  dwelling and bid defiance to the cold.    Woman was not yet made.  The story is, that Jupiter made her, and  sent her to Prometheus and his brother, to punish them for their  presumption in stealing fire from heaven; and man, for accepting  the gift.  The first woman was named Pandora.  She was made in  heaven, every god contributing something to perfect her.  Venus  gave her beauty, Mercury persuasion, Apollo music.  Thus  equipped, she was conveyed to earth, and presented to Epimetheus,  who gladly accepted her, though cautioned by his brother to  beware of Jupiter and his gifts.  Epimetheus had in his house a  jar, in which were kept certain noxious articles, for which, in  fitting man for his new abode, he had had no occasion.  Pandora  was seized with an eager curiosity to know what this jar  contained; and one day she slipped off the cover and looked in.  Forthwith there escaped a multitude of plagues for hapless man,--  such as gout, rheumatism, and colic for his body, and envy,  spite, and revenge for his mind,-- and scattered themselves far  and wide.  Pandora hastened to replace the lid; but, alas! The  whole contents of the jar had escaped, one thing"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33287"],[0,"Hints on the Use and Handling of Firearms Generally, and the Revolver in (#4)"],[1," at anybody; even  if unloaded, such a practice is foolish and unpardonable. No soldier  except in action would ever think of doing so, and no gentleman could.    The thoughtless practice of relinquishing one's weapon into the hands of  a friend, or, even worse, a stranger, is against all military rules, and  in any case is strongly to be condemned, and no excuse will palliate  such an offence; not even the assurance that the piece is unloaded. A  brother-comrade in the same regiment is, perhaps, the only exception;  but even this is objectionable, except in extreme cases. As a rule, a  soldier should never _relinquish_ his piece, even to a General or a  Field Officer.    Firearms generally, and particularly revolvers, when loaded or unloaded,  should never be laid upon a table so that the muzzle can accidentally  cover any one. If they must be relinquished by the owner they should be  placed in a corner of the room farthest from the door, leaning against  the wall, muzzle down, so that they cannot fall. If loaded they may,  when practicable, be laid upon a side-table, muzzle towards the wall.  Guns or rifles should be stood muzzle up in their place in the rack, or,  if there is no rack, then in a corner of the room farthest from the  door, to prevent surprise. No weapon of any kind should be carried or  put down, or left at full-cock, and no loaded weapon should be left  unprotected. They should, if loaded, be in the charge of some  trustworthy and responsible person; but in the time of war no man would  be so foolish as to relinquish his piece, either by night or by day.    To sportsmen and others, with the great facilities for loading and  unloading afforded by the breech-loading system, there can be no excuse  for leaving a weapon charged when it can so easily be rendered harmless.    There are many theories as to the proper way to present a pistol or  revolver.    Every man has some idea upon the subject, and perhaps it would be well  to leave every one to his own devices; but at the same time a suggestion  here, as we are upon the subject, may not be out of place.    The French carry the weapon muzzle up, the lock of the piece in line  with the ear. Upon taking aim, the muzzle is gradually depressed till  the object it is desired to hit is covered. This is no doubt a very good  way; but when firing at any distance beyond a point-blank range it  necessitates, firstly, the depression of the muzzle to cover the object,  and secondly, the necessary elevation must be taken so that the ball may  be carried the required distance, and so _hit_ the object.    This position of holding the weapon when at practice commends itself on  the ground of safety.    The preferable way, perhaps, is the old duelling style; that is, to hold  the weapon muzzle down at the full extent of the right arm, standing  sideways or three-quarters left, showing as small a front as possible,  the eye to be fixed steadily upon the bull's eye or centre of the target  or object, then gradually raising the arm to the required elevation.  Should the distance be beyond the point-blank range, after covering the  bull's eye continue to elevate till the required elevation is reached:  by then steadily and firmly increasing the pressure of the second finger  on the trigger the desired result will be obtained. Suddenly drawing or  jerking the trigger should be avoided.    By the latter means the object is covered at the same time as the foot  of the target is covered, so that in the event of the trigger being  drawn before the bull's eye is reached the target will be hit, and  assuming the target to be a man he would be disabled and the object  gained. Another important reason for advocating the use of the second  finger in drawing the trigger is the fact that the weight of the  military revolver (2 lbs. 8 oz.), together with the power required to  draw the trigger (5 lbs. pull), by the long tension of the muscles of  the arm, in aiming, causes a vibration, so that the farther the bullet  has to travel the farther it is thrown off the centre of the objective.  The first finger, therefore, placed along the barrel or side of the  pistol, acting as a lever, tends to reduce almost to a minimum the  spasmodic muscular vibration; again, in drawing the trigger with the  forefinger the hardness of the pull tends to depress the muzzle, while  with using the second finger as before described this depression is  almost impossible.    In rifle-shooting, as also in that of the pistol and revolver, the  ordinary method should be reversed; that is, instead of commencing at  100 yards from the target, the practice should commence at the longest  range, and the target should be gradually approached as if it were an  actual enemy.    In revolver practice I would recommend all who desire to become  thoroughly efficient to commence at say 100 yards from the target, and  to gradually reduce the range to not less than 20 yards. This would  accustom the practitioner to get a thorough knowledge of the  capabilities of the weapon, and to learn the required amount of  elevation necessary. It must be remembered that the Military Regulation  Revolver will kill at 300 yards.    I have myself shot with a 320-bore revolver, eight grains of powder,  bullet eighty grains, at a regulation target at 200 yards, and have made  very fair practice: in fact, the long range is far preferable for  practice, as being not only beneficial, but a more exciting pastime than  the ordinary range.    To those who do not possess a regulation iron target, I would recommend  one similar to that which I have sometimes used. (_Vide_ diagram.) This  target is made of a simple framework of wood, covered with canvas and  layers of paper pasted thereon. It has the double advantage of having  the Martini-Smith target in the centre, and the remaining portion,  having the exact size of a man traced thereon, has one other advantage  in at once showing the result of the practice. This target can be used  over and over again, as, after use, the perforations can be pasted over  with small pieces of paper, and when well riddled, it can be re-covered;  and the thicker it becomes the better.    No one should attempt to fire ball-cartridge anywhere but at a proper  range. Firing in small back-gardens, against brick or stone walls and  trunks of trees, should never be allowed. Bullets will rebound or go off  at a tangent, and do serious mischief.    When a bullet once leaves the muzzle of a rifle, pistol, or revolver, by  the evolution of gunpowder-gas, there is no dependence upon it as to  where it may stop, or what damage it may do, and bullets upon hitting  hard ground will ricochet; therefore, to those who wish to enjoy  security at practice, I would advise the selection of ground free from  habitation, or where no people are at work--some secluded spot where  there is ample range, and, if possible, a natural hill or mound to  receive the bullets.    The military revolver will kill at 300 yards, the Snider artillery  carbine at 1800 yards, and the Martini-Henry rifle at 3000 yards.[B] Too  much dependence upon the use of the slide of the back-sight for  elevation in rifle practice should be deprecated for more than one  reason: _e.g._, assuming that a man has been firing at 300 yards with  his back-sight adjusted to that range, and he is suddenly ordered to  advance at the double; if, at the spur of the moment, he neglects to  reduce his sight, the result will follow that every shot will go over  the enemy. It is simply idle to suppose for one moment that in the heat  of action a soldier could afford to fritter away valuable time, or even  be allowed to do so, in adjusting back-sights. He would, if he were  properly instructed, when within 300 yards place his back-sight level,  and rely upon his own skill in judging what elevation he should use.    It is better to fire low than high. A low shot will usually ricochet,  particularly upon striking hard ground, greensward, or a wet clay soil,  and, consequently, will do damage. Very nearly two thirds of the bullets  in action are lost by going over the heads of the enemy.    In the instruction of men in the use of the rifle valuable time is  wasted, and too much importance is attached to useless detail. Let a man  be placed before the ordinary regimental target, at an unknown distance,  with the figure of a man traced thereon, assuming the target to be an  enemy similarly armed with himself; let him understand that he must take  his chance of hitting his man or being hit himself; and let him fire at  this target with the back-sight level, judging his own distance and the  necessary elevation required: this calculation (not a very difficult  one, after a little practice) could easily be come to while in the act  of loading. The result of the first shot would determine the required  elevation, and by taking pains, bull's eyes and centres would soon be  obtained.    It is submitted that this mode of procedure would create an interest in  the practice of the soldier, tending to cause a healthy reaction; men  would take more pains, and try to beat their comrades, as there would be  a greater stimulus to do so than by the present system. Men, as it is,  go to their practice without the slightest interest therein, and get rid  of the ammunition as soon as possible, in order to get off duty. The  real reason why we have such excellent shots in the Volunteers is  accounted for by the fact that they not only take an interest in the  work, but take pains in everything they do, the result being success.    Much significance is attached to the bull's-eye mania. It should be  borne in mind that a man is a large object at which to aim; that so long  as he can be crippled there is no necessity to kill. To disable a man so  that he can do no more mischief is sufficient.    Any man can make a scale of elevation in his own mind, and, with  practice, fire at any range without putting up "]]]
