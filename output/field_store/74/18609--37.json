The following  explanation is cited from the U.S. patent:    Figure 1 [shown here] is a vertical section of the furnace, and Fig. 2  is a diagram to illustrate the means for regulating the electro-motive  force or quantity of current across the furnace.    F is the furnace containing the charge to be treated. It has an  inlet-hopper at _a_, with slides AA, by which the charge can be admitted  without opening communication between the interior of the furnace and  the outer air.    B is a screw conveyer by which the charge is pushed forward into the  furnace.    _c'c'_ are the electrodes, consisting of blocks or cylinders or the like  of carbon fixed in metal socket-pieces _c c_, to which the  electric-circuit wires _d_ from the dynamo D are affixed. The current,  as aforesaid, may be either continuous or alternating. _c^{2}c^{2}_ are  rods of metal or carbon, which are used to establish the electric  circuit through the furnace, the said rods being inserted into holes in  conductors _c^{3}_ (in contact with the socket-pieces _c_) and in the  furnace, as shown.    _g_ is the outlet for the gas or vapor, _h_ the slag-tap hole, and _x_  the opening for manipulating the charge, the said openings being closed  by clay or otherwise when the furnace is at work.    I use coke or other form of carbon in the charge between the electrodes  _c'_, the said coke being in contact with the said electrodes, so that  complete incandescence is insured.    A means for varying the electro-motive force or quantity of current  across the furnace with the varying resistance of the charge is  illustrated by the diagram, Fig. 2. _c' c^{2}_ indicate the electrodes  in the furnace, as in Fig. 1, and D is the dynamo and T its terminals. E  represents the exciting-circuit. R R are resistances, and R S is the  resistance-switch, which is operated to put in more or less resistance  at R as the resistance of the charge in the furnace lessens or  increases. This switch may be automatically operated, and a suitable  arrangement for the purpose is a current-regulator such as is described  in the specification of English Letters Patent No. 14,504, of September  14, 1889, granted to William Henry Douglas and Thomas Hugh Parker.]    [Illustration:      T.

The frame which holds the matches so that one end protrudes at the  bottom, is lowered over a pan containing molten sulfur. The  sulfur-covered matches are then dropped into a phosphorous paste. See  figure 12. (From FIGUIER, _Merveilles de l'industrie_, volume 3, 1874,  page 575.)]          Phosphatides and Phosphagens      The important phosphorus compounds in organisms are much more complex  than the simple salts, to which Nietzsche attributed such influence on  man's character. Long before he wrote, it was known that phosphoric acid  combines not only with inorganic bases to form salts, but with alcohols  to form esters. In the middle of the 19th century, Theophile Juste  Pelouze (1807-1867) extended this knowledge to an ester of glycerol.  This proved to be significant in several respects. Glycerol had been  shown by Michel Chevreul (1786-1889) as the substance in fats that is  released in the process of soap boiling, when the fatty acids are  converted into their salts. That it has the nature of an alcohol had  been demonstrated by Marcellin Berthelot. Instead of one \"alcoholic\"  hydroxyl group, OH, like ethanol (the alcohol of fermentation), or two  hydroxyl groups (like ethylene glycol), glycerol contains three such  groups. It was the only \"natural\" alcohol known at that time. That this  alcohol would combine with phosphoric acid could be predicted, but that  the ester, as obtained by Pelouze, still contained free acidic functions  and formed a water-soluble barium salt was a new experience.    [Illustration: Figure 12.--PAN FOR DIPPING MATCHSTICKS into phosphorus  paste, about 1870. The letters on the picture are: A, matches; B, water  bath; C, frame; D, plate; E, phosphorus paste; F, oven. The phosphorus  paste of Boettger, 1842, contained 10 phosphorus, 25 antimony sulfide,  12.5 manganese dioxide, 15 gelatin. According to Figuier (page 579), R.  Wagner substituted lead dioxide for the manganese dioxide.

["]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33767"],[0,"Campward Ho! A Manual for Girl Scout Camps (#4)"],[1,"and practicable for your camp  depends more or less upon the number of people to be accommodated, the  length of the camp season, and the camp site. For short time camps, for  small groups, or for older people, or when building is impossible, tents  only can be used. In such cases there would be need of a tent for a mess  and assembly room, a tent for the kitchen, a small waterproof tent in  which to store provisions, a small tent for covering a latrine and tents  for sleeping quarters.    The main tent for a mess hall and assembly room combined, should be  large, placed with some regard for a view of the surrounding country,  sun, air and general camp scheme. (p. 25.) It should be furnished with  tables, benches, and so forth, all of which can be moved out of the way  when the room is to be used for recreational purposes. The kitchen  should not be too far away, but back of the main tent and should be so  placed that all of the air possible may blow through it. There should be  a long cook table with a shelf over it, if possible, hung from the ridge  pole, or supported with uprights fastened to the table. Also a table  which can be used for dish washing. It would be well to have in  addition to the kitchen stove which is in this tent, cooking fire places  outside of the tent which could be used in pleasant weather. One of the  most practical of these is built of stone, with a back wall and two  sides, with two rods, the ends resting on the side walls and near enough  together to hold the average size pots and kettles. If stones are not  available two large logs can be placed V shape not quite meeting at the  narrow end, 1-1/2 feet apart at the other end, and the fire built in  between. Cross bars of iron or a grating can be put over the fire to  hold the pots and kettles. While it is convenient and practical to use  out of door fire places for cooking when the group is very small it is  most difficult to do so when the group is large. The work can be done,  however, with greater ease by the use of the iron bars already spoken  of.    [Illustration: BUSINESS END OF THE CAMP HALL]    The storage tent can have portable shelves and a low platform on which  to place barrels, boxes, and so forth. This tent should be pitched under  a large tree where it will be in the shade all of the time. A good store  closet can be made by digging into the side of a hill, boarding the  inside or facing it with stone and putting in shelves, and having a very  thick, well fitted door.    A more simple storage room, but not advisable except for a small camp,  is to dig a hole in the ground, line it with stone, place boards over  the top, leave a small opening for a lid or a hinged trap door and cover  the boards with earth, leaving the door free. If ice is available a  piece put into a pail can be set in this compartment.    In all of these out of door store places great care must be taken that  no animals, insects or flies get at the provisions. Covered tins, or  dishes and bags can be used for safety. When the camp is to be opened  only for a short period it is quite possible to put provisions into  pails tightly covered and set in running water in the shade.      Type of Tents    Whenever tents are to be used in a camp, they should be purchased with  care and pitched properly. There are on the market several different  types of tents: the army wall tent (p. 10.) which should always be  pitched with a fly and be opened at both ends, the conical and the  pyramidal tents. The two latter are not recommended for general use.  They are erected with one center pole, which is always in the way, and  have to be pegged to the ground, thus making guy ropes a nuisance rather  than a convenience. These tents are, however, picturesque in effect. (p.  12.)    When ordering tents always stipulate the size and the weight and width  of the material to be used. Army duck, 10 oz. double fill for the tent  and 8 oz. double fill for the fly, width 29 inches, will give the best  satisfaction.    [Illustration: The Wash House for Personal and Laundry use. Faucets hang  from above. Inclined trough between two shelves, the whole, zinc  covered, runs length of house. Two soapstone tubs for extra hard  scrubbing at right. Special compartment at left for officers.]    The size of the tents for sleeping will depend somewhat on the character  of the site. Where the ground is very sloping, trees close, space  limited, small tents will have to be used; either 7 x 9 or 9 x 9's.  These tents which will accommodate two people, should always be used to  house counsellors, but are not recommended for children as a general  thing. The larger tents, 14 x 14 or 14 x 16 will accommodate eight cots  and give ample space for personal equipment.    For short trips there are small lightweight, waterproof tents which can  be rolled so that they take up very little space in transportation. They  are pitched over ground cloths, with one pointed rod and metal spikes  for pegging the tent to the ground. These tents hold two people. (pp.  78, 80, 82.)      The Tent Floor and Support    Tents should always be pitched over wooden floors which are raised well  from the ground. (p. 16.) They should be built with square corners and  braced on the under side. The dimensions of each floor should be the  same as the length and width of the tent to be pitched over it. They  should only be put into place after considering the direction of the  sun, the prevailing winds, their relation to each other and the general  camp plan.    Large floors should be raised several inches from the ground and  supported with posts or flat stones at each corner, at the center of  each side and at intervals under the center of the floor to keep them  from sagging. When putting up a wall tent instead of using pegs, build a  frame work running parallel to the sides of the tent to which the guy  ropes can be fastened. (p. 18) This frame is made by driving into the  ground opposite the two sides of the tent floor, and 3 feet from it,  three posts, each 3 or 4 inches in diameter, and long enough to extend  when set, above the tent floor a distance equal to the height of the  tent wall, plus five inches. One post should be placed opposite the  center of each side, the others on a line with it and opposite the  corners of the floor. Nail securely to the outside of the posts and two  or three inches from the tops a strip which will extend beyond the end  posts 6 or 8 inches. Unless the ground is rocky the posts need not be  braced. If care is taken to measure and place the posts correctly the  frame will be evenly made and look trim. Small tree trunks can be used  for posts and strips, where wood is plentiful; otherwise 2 x 4's can be  used.    Where tent floors are found to be prohibitive, tents must be pitched  over dry, well drained ground. In addition a ground cloth should be  used and a ditch dug on either side of the tent to carry off rain water.    [Illustration: Camp for a single Scout Troop. Three tents and simple  accessories enough for week-end trip.]    Tents without floors are of course used when hiking or camping for a  short time only, or in exceptional climates. (p. 20.) Specific  directions for pitching tents are given in a later section.    A small group of girls wishing to build their own camp could make two or  three lean-tos, using trees five or six inches in diameter, saplings,  boughs and vines, the latter for binding the thatch roof to the beams.  The lean-tos should be faced so the sun will shine into them some part  of the day, turned away from the prevailing winds and each one should  have in front of it a fireplace to be used for cooking as well as for  keeping the lean-to dry and warm. (pp. 105, 110, 112.)    A group of girls could also build a slab house with a good floor, a  wooden roof covered with tar paper, windows, door and even build a  fireplace, the completed building giving them permanent camp quarters.  (pp. 96, 118, 122.)    LOG HOUSES    Whenever possible it is most desirable to erect for the main camp  building a house, rustic in design if built in the woods, (p. 23.) which  includes a large room for mess hall and recreational purposes, kitchen,  store closet, ice room. (Cut A.) The types and floor plans of such  houses vary greatly, but certain things are essential in all. They  should afford protection in bad weather, some warmth in cold weather,  ample space for serving mess, room for entertainments, meetings and so  forth; a conveniently arranged kitchen, and proper facilities for the  care of food. Some of these houses are built with the main room simply  roofed over and railed in. As delightful as these open mess halls are in  pleasant weather, they are not altogether practicable in all climates,  and under all weather conditions.    Some protection is gained by enclosing the room to a height of 3-1/2 or  4 feet and having the eaves overhang for 3 feet, or by having canvas  curtains which can be raised or lowered in bad weather. If the room is  enclosed entirely it should have many large windows, and wide outside  doors.    The main feature in the room should be the fireplace. (p. 27.)
