When the  hour arrived for the triumph which he had prepared, he was not even  admitted into the Cabinet, virtually presided over by his graceless  pupil, and who, in the profuse suggestions of his teeming converse,  had found the principles and the information which were among the chief  claims to public confidence of Mr Fox.    Hard necessity made Mr Burke submit to the yoke, but the humiliation  could never be forgotten. Nemesis favours genius: the inevitable hour  at length arrived. A voice like the Apocalypse sounded over England and  even echoed in all the courts of Europe. Burke poured forth the vials  of his hoarded vengeance into the agitated heart of Christendom; he  stimulated the panic of a world by the wild pictures of his inspired  imagination; he dashed to the ground the rival who had robbed him of  his hard-earned greatness; rended in twain the proud oligarchy that  had dared to use and to insult him; and followed with servility by  the haughtiest and the most timid of its members, amid the frantic  exultation of his country, he placed his heel upon the neck of the  ancient serpent.    Among the whig followers of Mr Burke in this memorable defection, among  the Devonshires and the Portlands, the Spencers and the Fitzwilliams,  was the Earl of Marney, whom the whigs would not make a duke.    What was his chance of success from Mr Pitt?    If the history of England be ever written by one who has the knowledge  and the courage, and both qualities are equally requisite for the  undertaking, the world would be more astonished than when reading the  Roman annals by Niebuhr. Generally speaking, all the great events have  been distorted, most of the important causes concealed, some of  the principal characters never appear, and all who figure are so  misunderstood and misrepresented, that the result is a complete  mystification, and the perusal of the narrative about as profitable to  an Englishman as reading the Republic of Plato or the Utopia of More,  the pages of Gaudentio di Lucca or the adventures of Peter Wilkins.    The influence of races in our early ages, of the church in our middle,  and of parties in our modern history, are three great moving and  modifying powers, that must be pursued and analyzed with an untiring,  profound, and unimpassioned spirit, before a guiding ray can be secured.  A remarkable feature of our written history is the absence in its pages  of some of the most influential personages. Not one man in a thousand  for instance has ever heard of Major Wildman: yet he was the soul of  English politics in the most eventful period of this kingdom, and one  most interesting to this age, from 1640 to 1688; and seemed more than  once to hold the balance which was to decide the permanent form of  our government. But he was the leader of an unsuccessful party. Even,  comparatively speaking, in our own times, the same mysterious oblivion  is sometimes encouraged to creep over personages of great social  distinction as well as political importance.    The name of the second Pitt remains, fresh after forty years of great  events, a parliamentary beacon. He was the Chatterton of politics; the  \"marvellous boy.\" Some have a vague impression that he was mysteriously  moulded by his great father: that he inherited the genius, the  eloquence, the state craft of Chatham. His genius was of a different  bent, his eloquence of a different class, his state craft of a different  school. To understand Mr Pitt, one must understand one of the suppressed  characters of English history, and that is Lord Shelburne.    When the fine genius of the injured Bolingbroke, the only peer of his  century who was educated, and proscribed by the oligarchy because they  were afraid of his eloquence, \"the glory of his order and the shame,\"  shut out from Parliament, found vent in those writings which recalled  to the English people the inherent blessings of their old free monarchy,  and painted in immortal hues his picture of a patriot king, the spirit  that he raised at length touched the heart of Carteret, born a whig, yet  sceptical of the advantages of that patrician constitution which made  the Duke of Newcastle, the most incompetent of men, but the chosen leader  of the Venetian party, virtually sovereign of England. Lord Carteret had  many brilliant qualities: he was undaunted, enterprising, eloquent; had  considerable knowledge of continental politics, was a great linguist,  a master of public law; and though he failed in his premature effort to  terminate the dogeship of George the Second, he succeeded in maintaining  a considerable though secondary position in public life. The young  Shelburne married his daughter. Of him it is singular we know less than  of his father-in-law, yet from the scattered traits some idea may be  formed of the ablest and most accomplished minister of the eighteenth  century. Lord Shelburne, influenced probably by the example and the  traditionary precepts of his eminent father-in-law, appears early to  have held himself aloof from the patrician connection, and entered  public life as the follower of Bute in the first great effort of George  the Third to rescue the sovereignty from what Lord Chatham called \"the  Great Revolution families.\" He became in time a member of Lord Chatham's  last administration: one of the strangest and most unsuccessful efforts  to aid the grandson of George the Second in his struggle for political  emancipation. Lord Shelburne adopted from the first the Bolingbroke  system: a real royalty, in lieu of the chief magistracy; a permanent  alliance with France, instead of the whig scheme of viewing in that  power the natural enemy of England: and, above all, a plan of  commercial freedom, the germ of which may be found in the long-maligned  negotiations of Utrecht, but which in the instance of Lord Shelburne  were soon in time matured by all the economical science of Europe,  in which he was a proficient. Lord Shelburne seems to have been of  a reserved and somewhat astute disposition: deep and adroit, he was  however brave and firm. His knowledge was extensive and even profound.  He was a great linguist; he pursued both literary and scientific  investigations; his house was frequented by men of letters, especially  those distinguished by their political abilities or economical  attainments. He maintained the most extensive private correspondence of  any public man of his time. The earliest and most authentic information  reached him from all courts and quarters of Europe: and it was a common  phrase, that the minister of the day sent to him often for the important  information which the cabinet could not itself command. Lord Shelburne  was the first great minister who comprehended the rising importance  of the middle class; and foresaw in its future power a bulwark for the  throne against \"the Great Revolution families.\" Of his qualities  in council we have no record; there is reason to believe that his  administrative ability was conspicuous: his speeches prove that, if not  supreme, he was eminent, in the art of parliamentary disputation, while  they show on all the questions discussed a richness and variety of  information with which the speeches of no statesman of that age except  Mr Burke can compare.    Such was the man selected by George the Third as his champion against  the Venetian party after the termination of the American war. The  prosecution of that war they had violently opposed, though it had  originated in their own policy. First minister in the House of Lords,  Shelburne entrusted the lead in the House of Commons to his Chancellor  of the Exchequer, the youthful Pitt. The administration was brief, but  it was not inglorious. It obtained peace, and for the first time since  the Revolution introduced into modern debate the legitimate principles  on which commerce should be conducted. It fell before the famous  Coalition with which \"the Great Revolution families\" commenced their  fiercest and their last contention for the patrician government of royal  England.    In the heat of that great strife, the king in the second hazardous  exercise of his prerogative entrusted the perilous command to Pitt.  Why Lord Shelburne on that occasion was set aside, will perhaps always  remain a mysterious passage of our political history, nor have we space  on the present occasion to attempt to penetrate its motives. Perhaps  the monarch, with a sense of the rising sympathies of his people, was  prescient of the magic power of youth in touching the heart of a nation.  Yet it would not be an unprofitable speculation if for a moment we  paused to consider what might have been the consequences to our country  if Mr Pitt had been content for a season again to lead the Commons under  Lord Shelburne, and have secured for England the unrivalled knowledge  and dexterity of that statesman in the conduct of our affairs during the  confounding fortunes of the French revolution. Lord Shelburne was the  only English minister competent to the task; he was the only public man  who had the previous knowledge requisite to form accurate conclusions  on such a conjuncture: his remaining speeches on the subject attest the  amplitude of his knowledge and the accuracy of his views: and in the  rout of Jena, or the agony of Austerlitz, one cannot refrain from  picturing the shade of Shelburne haunting the cabinet of Pitt, as the  ghost of Canning is said occasionally to linger about the speaker's  chair, and smile sarcastically on the conscientious mediocrities who  pilfered his hard-earned honours.    But during the happier years of Mr Pitt, the influence of the mind of  Shelburne may be traced throughout his policy. It was Lansdowne House  that made Pitt acquainted with Dr Price, a dissenting minister, whom  Lord Shelburne when at the head of affairs courageously offered"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3761"],[0,"This Country of Ours (#4)"],[1,"Columbus himself all but wrecked  his chances.  He had dreamed so long about this splendid adventure,  he was so filled with belief in its grandeur, that he demanded  conditions such as would hardly have been granted to the greatest  prince in the land.    Columbus demanded that he should be made admiral and viceroy of all  the lands he might discover, and that after his death this honour  should descend to his son and to his son's son for ever and ever.  He also demanded a tenth part of all the pearls, precious stones,  gold, silver and spices, or whatever else he might gain by trade  or barter.    At these demands the grandees of Spain stood aghast.  What! This  shabby dreamer, this penniless beggar aspired to honour and dignities  fit for a prince! It was absurd, and not to be thought of.  If this  beggarly sailor would have Spain assist him he must needs be more  humble in suit.    But not one jot would Columbus abate of his demands.  So the Council  broke up, and Columbus, with anger and disappointment in his heart,  mounted his mule and turned his face towards the Court of France.  All the seven long years during which he had waited, and hoped,  and prayed, in Spain had been wasted.  Now he would go to the King  of France, and make his last appeal there.    But Columbus had left friends behind him, friends who had begun  to picture to themselves almost as vividly as he the splendours of  the conquest he was to make.  Now these friends sought out the Queen.  In glowing words they painted to her the glory and the honour which  would come to Spain if Columbus succeeded.  And if he failed, why,  what were a few thousand crowns, they asked.  And as the Queen  listened her heart beat fast; the magnificence of the enterprise  took hold upon her, and she resolved that, come what might, Columbus  should go forth on his adventure.    Ferdinand, however, still looked coldly on.  The war against the  Moors had been long and bitter, his treasury was empty.  Whence, he  asked himself, was money forthcoming for this mad scheme? Isabella,  however, had done with prudence and caution. \"If there is not money  enough in Aragon,\" she cried, \"I will undertake this adventure for  my own kingdom of Castile, and if need be I will pawn my jewels to  do it.\"    While these things were happening Columbus, sick at heart, was  slowly plodding on the road to France.  But he only went a little  way on his long journey.  For just as he was entering a narrow pass  not far from Granada, where the mountains towered above him, he  heard the thud of horses' hoofs.    It was a lonely and silent spot among the hills, where robbers  lurked, and where many a man had been slain for the money and jewels  he carried.  Columbus, however, had nothing to dread: he carried  with him neither gold nor jewels.  He went forth from Spain a beggar,  even as he had come.  But if fear he had any, it was soon turned to  incredulous joy.  For when the horsemen came up they told Columbus  that his friends had won the day for him, and that he must return.    At first Columbus hesitated.  He found it hard to believe that truly  at last he had his heart's desire.  When, however, the messenger  told him that the Queen herself bade him return, he hesitated no  longer.  Joyfully turning his mule he hastened back to Granada.    At last Columbus had won his heart's desire, and he had only to gather  ships and men and set forth westward.  But now a new difficulty  arose.  For it was out upon the terrible Sea of Darkness that Columbus  wished to sail, and men feared to face its terrors.    Week after week went past and not a ship or a man could Columbus  get.  He persuaded and implored in vain: no man was brave enough to  follow him to the unknown horrors of the Sea of Darkness.  Therefore  as entreaty and persuasion proved of no avail, Columbus sought help  from the King, who gave him power to force men to go with him.    Even then all sorts of difficulties were thrown in the way.  Columbus, however, overcame them all, and at length his three ships  were ready.  But it had taken many months.  It was February when he  turned back so gladly to Granada; it was the third of August before  everything was in order.    Before dawn upon the day he sailed Columbus entered the church, in  the little sea-faring town of Palos where his ships lay at anchor.  There he humbly confessed his sins, received the Sacrament, and  committed himself to God's all-powerful guidance.  The crew, wild,  rough fellows, many of them, followed his example.  Then Columbus  stepped on board his ship, the Santa Maria, and turned his face  westward.    He was filled with exaltation.  But all Palos was filled with gloom,  and upon the shore a great crowd gathered to bid a last farewell  to these daring adventurers.  And as the ships spread their sails  and sped forth in the morning light the people wept and lamented  sorely, for they never thought again to see their loved ones, who  were about to adventure forth upon the terrible Sea of Darkness.    __________            Chapter 3 - How Columbus Fared Forth Upon The Sea of Darkness and  Came to Pleasant Lands Beyond          At first the voyage upon which Columbus and his daring companions  now set forth lay through seas already known; but soon the last  land-mark was left behind, and the three little vessels, smaller  than river craft of today, were alone upon the trackless waste of  waters.  And when the men saw the last trace of land vanish their  hearts sank, and they shed bitter tears, weeping for home and the  loved ones they thought never more to see.    On and on they sailed, and as day after day no land appeared the  men grew restless.  Seeing them thus restless, and lest they should  be utterly terrified at being so far from home upon this seemingly  endless waste of waters, Columbus determined to keep them from  knowing how far they had really gone.  So he kept two reckonings.  One, in which the real length of the ships' daily journey was given  he kept to himself: the other, in which the journey was given as  much shorter, he showed to the sailors.    A month went past, six weeks went past, and still there was no  trace of land.  Then at length came signs.  Snow birds which never  ventured far to sea flew round the ships.  Now the waves bore to  them a rudely carved stick, now the ships ploughed a way through  masses of floating weeds.  All these signs were at first greeted  with joy and hope, and the sailors took heart.  But as still the  days went past and no land appeared, they lost heart again.    The fields of weeds which they had at first greeted with joy now  became an added terror.  Would they not be caught in this tangle  of weeds, they asked, and never more win a way out of it? To their  fearful and superstitious minds the very breeze which had borne  them softly onward became a menace.  For if the wind always blew  steadily from the east how was it possible ever to return to Spain? So  Columbus was almost glad when a contrary wind blew.  For it proved  to his trembling sailors that one at least of their fears was  groundless.  But it made little difference.  The men were now utterly  given over to gloomy terrors.    Fear robbed them of all ambition.  Ferdinand and Isabella had  promised a large sum of money to the man who should first discover  land.  But none cared now to win it.  All they desired was to turn  home once more.    Fear made them mutinous also.  So they whispered together and planned  in secret to rid themselves of Columbus.  It would be easy, they  thought, to throw him overboard some dark night, and then give out  that he had fallen into the sea by accident.  No one would know.  No  one in Spain would care, for Columbus was after all but a foreigner  and an upstart.  The great ocean would keep the secret.  They would  be free to turn homeward.    Columbus saw their dark looks, heard the murmurs of the crews, and  did his best to hearten them again.  He spoke to them cheerfully,  persuading and encouraging, \"laughing at them, while in his heart  he wept.\"    Still the men went sullenly about their work.  But at length one  morning a sudden cry from the Pinta shook them from out their sullen  thoughts.    It was the captain of the Pinta who shouted. \"Land, land, my lord!\"  he cried. \"I claim the reward.\"    And when Columbus heard that shout his heart was filled with joy  and thankfulness, and baring his head he sank upon his knees, giving  praise to God.  The crew followed his example.  Then, their hearts  suddenly light and joyous, they swarmed up the masts and into the  rigging to feast their eyes upon the goodly sight.    All day they sailed onward toward the promised land.  The sun sank  and still all night the ships sped on their joyous way.  But when  morning dawned the land seemed no nearer than before.  Hope died  away again, and sorrowfully as the day went on the woeful truth  that the fancied land had been but a bank of clouds was forced upon  Columbus.    Again for days the ships sailed on, and as still no land appeared  the men again began to murmur.  Then one day when Columbus walked  on deck he was met, not merely with sullen looks, but with angry  words.  The men clamoured to return.  And if the Admiral refused,  why, so much the worse for him.  They would endure no longer.    Bravely the Admiral faced the mutineers.  He talked to them cheerfully.  He reminded them of what honour and gain would be theirs when they  returned home having found the new way to India, of what wealth  they might win by trading.  Then he ended sternly:    \"Complain how you may,\" he said, \"I have to go to the Indies, and  I will go on till I find them, so help me God.\"    For the time being the Admiral's stern, brave words cowed  the mutineers.  But not for much longer, Columbus knew right well,  would they obey him if land did not soon appear.  And in his heart  he prayed God that it might not be long delayed.    The"]]]
