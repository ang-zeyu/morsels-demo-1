Comparison.--No significant differences noted among the species  studied.      _+Musculus extensor digitorum longus+_ (Figs. 3, 5, 8).--Slender and  pinnate, this muscle lies along the anteromedial surface of the tibia.  The origin is fleshy from most of the region between the cnemial  crests and from a line along the anterior surface of the proximal  fourth of the tibia. Approximately two-thirds of the distance down the  crus the muscle gives rise to the tendon of insertion which passes  through the fibrous loop near the distal end of the tibia in company  with the _m. tibialis anticus_. The tendon then passes along beneath  the supratendinal bridge at the distal end of the tibia, traverses the  anterior intercondylar fossa, and passes beneath a bony bridge on the  anteromedial surface of the proximal end of the tarsometatarsus. The  tendon continues along the anterior surface of the tarsometatarsus to  a point immediately above the bases of the toes and there gives rise  to three branches, one to the anterior surface of each foretoe. The  insertions of each branch are on the anterior surfaces of the  phalanges as shown in Fig. 8.    Action.--Extends foretoes.    Comparison.--This muscle is weakly developed in _Leucosticte_ and  _Calvarius_; the belly is slender and extends only half way down the  crus before giving rise to the tendon of insertion. The functional  significance of this variation is difficult to understand. The  convergence in muscle pattern shown by these two genera, however, is  in all probability the result of similarities in behavior patterns.  These birds perch less frequently than do the other birds studied.  Thus, the toes are neither flexed nor extended as often; the smaller  size of the _m. extensor digitorum longus_ may have resulted in part  from this lessened activity. Except for the variations just noted,  there are no significant differences among the species studied; even  the rather complex patterns of insertion are identical.      _+Musculus peroneus longus+_ (Fig. 1).--Relatively thin and straplike,  this muscle lies on the anterolateral surface of the crus and is  intimately attached to the underlying muscles. The part of the origin  from the proximal edges of the inner and outer cnemial crests is  semitendinous but the part of the origin from the lateral edge of the  shaft of the fibula is tendinous. Approximately two-thirds the  distance down the crus the muscle gives rise to the tendon of  insertion. Immediately above the external condyle of the tibiotarsus  this tendon divides. The posterior branch inserts on the proximal end  of the lateral edge of the tibial cartilage. The anterior branch  passes over the lateral surface of the external condyle to the  posterior surface of the tarsometatarsus and there unites with the  tendon of the _m. flexor perforatus digiti III_.    Action.--Extends tarsometatarsus and flexes third digit.    Comparison.--No significant differences noted among the species  studied.      _+Musculus peroneus brevis+_ (Figs. 2, 3).--Lying along the  anterolateral surface of the tibia, this slender, pinnate muscle  arises from a fleshy origin along this surface and along the anterior  surface of the fibula from a point immediately proximal to the  insertion of the _m. biceps femoris_ to a point approximately  two-thirds of the way down the crus. Near the distal end of the tibia  the muscle gives rise to the tendon of insertion that passes through a  groove on the anterolateral edge of the tibia just above the external  condyle. Here the tendon is held in place by a broad fibrous loop and  passes under the anterior branch of the tendon of insertion of the _m.  peroneus longus_ and inserts on a prominence on the lateral edge of  the proximal end of the tarsometatarsus.    Action.--Extends tarsometatarsus and may abduct it slightly.    Comparison.--No significant differences noted among the species  studied.      _+Musculus gastrocnemius+_ (Figs. 1, 4).--The largest muscle of the  pelvic appendage, it covers superficially all of the posterior  surface, most of the medial surface, and half of the lateral surface  of the crus. The muscle originates by three distinct heads.    The _pars externa_ covers the posterolateral surface of the crus, is  intermediate in size between the other two heads, and arises by a  short, strong tendon from a small bony protuberance on the  posterolateral side of the distal end of the femur immediately  proximal to the fibular condyle. The tendon is intimately connected  with the distal arm of the loop for the _m. biceps femoris_.    The _pars media_ is the smallest of the three heads and lies on the  medial surface of the crus. The head of the _pars media_ is separated  from the _pars interna_ by the tendon of insertion of the _m.  semimembranosus_ and originates by a short, strong tendon from the  posteromedial surface of the proximal end of the internal condyle of  the femur. The proximal portion of the _pars media_ has tendinous  connections with the tendon of the _m. semitendinosus_ and with the  _pars posticus_ of the _m. adductor longus et brevis_.    The _pars interna_ is the largest of the three heads and covers most  of the medial surface of the crus. This head in its proximal portion  is distinctly divided into anterior and posterior parts, the former  overlapping the latter medially. The origin of the posterior part is  fleshy from the anterior half of the tibial head. Some of the fibers  of the anterior part arise directly from the inner cnemial crest while  its remaining fibers arise from the patellar tendon (Fig. 1) and form  a band that extends around the anterior surface of the knee, covering  the insertion of the _m. sartorius_.    Approximately half way down the crus, the three heads give rise to the  tendon of insertion, the _tendo achillis_, which passes over and is  tightly bound to the posterior surface of the tibial cartilage. The  insertion is tendinous on the posterior surface of the hypotarsus and  along the posterolateral ridge of the tarsometatarsus. This tendon  seems to be continuous with a fascia which forms a sheath around the  posterior surface of the tarsometatarsus holding the other tendons of  this region firmly in the posterior sulcus.    Action.--Extends tarsometatarsus.    Comparison.--Study of the _pars externa_ and _pars media_ reveals no  significant differences among the species dissected. The _pars  interna_, however, is subject to some variation which is described  below.           _Pars interna_ bipartite      _Vireo_              _Chlorura_    _Seiurus_            _Pipilo_    _Icterus_            _Calamospiza_    _Molothrus_          _Chondestes_    _Piranga_            _Junco_    _Richmondena_        _Spizella_    _Guiraca_            _Zonotrichia_    _Passerina_          _Passerella_    _Spiza_              _Calcarius_    The two parts of the _m. gastrocnemius_ are most distinct in _Vireo_.  _Icterus_, _Molothrus_, _Richmondena_, _Guiraca_, and _Passerina_ lack  the fibrous band that passes around the front of the knee. In _Spiza_  this band of fibers is smaller than in the other species.         _Pars interna_ undivided      _Passer_            _Pinicola_    _Estrilda_          _Leucosticte_    _Poephila_          _Spinus_    _Hesperiphona_      _Loxia_    _Carpodacus_    In _Leucosticte_, although the _pars interna_ is undivided, there is a  band of fibers which extends around the front of the knee (see  discussion, p. 183).      _+Musculus plantaris+_ (Fig. 5).--Small and slender, this muscle lies  on the posteromedial surface of the crus, beneath the _pars interna_  of the _m. gastrocnemius_ and originates by fleshy fibers from the  posteromedial surface of the proximal end of the tibia immediately  distal to the internal articular surface. The belly extends  approximately one-sixth of the way down the crus and gives rise to a  long, slender tendon that inserts on the proximomedial edge of the  tibial cartilage.    Action.--Extends tarsometatarsus.    Comparison.--No significant differences noted among the species  studied.      _+Musculus flexor perforatus digiti II+_ (Figs. 3, 9).--This is a  slender muscle which lies on the lateral side of the crus beneath the  _pars externa_ of the _m. gastrocnemius_ and is intimately connected  anteromedially with the _m. flexor digitorum longus_ and  posteromedially with the _m. flexor hallucis longus_. The origin is by  a strong tendon from the lateral surface of the external condyle of  the femur at the point of origin of the _m. flexor perforans et  perforatus digiti II_. This tendon serves also as the origin of the  anterior head of the _m. flexor hallucis longus_. The tendon connects  also by a broad tendinous band with the distal arm of the loop for the  _m. biceps femoris_ and by a similar band with the lateral edge of the  fibula immediately distal to the head. The tendon of insertion passes  distally, perforates the tibial cartilage near its lateral edge,  traverses the middle medial canal of the hypotarsus (Fig. 6), and  passes distally to the foot. At the distal end of the tarsometatarsus  the tendon is held against the medial surface of the first metatarsal  by a straplike sheath. The tendon then passes over a sesamoid bone  between the first metatarsal and the base of the second digit and is  bound to this bone by a sheath. The tendon inserts mainly along the  posteromedial edge of the proximal end of the first phalanx of the  second digit, although the termination is sheathlike and covers the  entire posterior surface of this phalanx. This sheathlike termination  is perforated by the tendons of the _m. flexor perforans et perforatus  digiti II_ and the branch of the _m. flexor digitorum longus_ that  inserts on the second digit.    Action.--Flexes second digit.    Comparison.--In _Vireo_ this muscle is larger and more deeply situated  than it is in the other species examined and has no connection with  the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33915"],[0,"Mammals taken Along the Alaska Highway (#4)"],[1,"er, 2150 ft., 2 mi.

Alcorn, like Rand (1945:43), found the mouse in almost every habitat  along the Alaska Highway. On the east side of the Minaker River, one  mile west of Trutch, Alcorn took 26 _Peromyscus_ and four _Microtus_  in 70 museum special traps baited with chewed rolled oats, set in a  grassy area where there were birches and clumps of willows.  _Peromyscus_ was usually abundant in old construction camps along the  highway; on July 27 in 50 traps set under abandoned buildings at  Summit Pass, Alcorn took 21 _Peromyscus_. Apparently, as Swarth  (1936:402) notes, the white-footed mouse makes itself at home in such  buildings, and local populations probably increase as a result of the  artificial environment that provides favorable conditions for  existence.

N Fort St. John, 3.    _Remarks._--Wood rats were obtained at only two locations, Alcorn's  field notes indicating that the animals were rare and spotty in  distribution. Rand (1944:44) comments that the rats were \"scarce north  of the Lower Liard Crossing.\"    At both localities where specimens were taken, Alcorn noted first  their characteristic droppings. At Summit Pass, droppings were found  in a rock slide at the upper limit of timber line; one rat was taken.  At the trapping station five miles west and three miles north of Fort  St. John, droppings were found in and under an old abandoned building;  four young (two prepared) and one adult were obtained.

Five  specimens were obtained in a grassy area 30 feet wide by 60 feet long  which was approximately 50 feet from McIntyre Creek in the Yukon  Territory. In 22 mouse traps set the first night in this locality,  three _Synaptomys_, six _Microtus_ and one _Sorex_ were taken. One  additional _Synaptomys_ was taken on each of the following two nights  in the same area. At Deadman Lake, Alaska, one _Synaptomys_ was taken  in heavy sedge bordering a small pond.

One specimen from this locality is slightly darker than  the others.    Red-backed mice were numerous in most localities where Alcorn trapped.  A number of specimens were taken adjacent to and within abandoned road  camps, where second growth vegetation was rank. As in the case of _C.  gapperi_, he found _C. rutilus_ in varied habitats.

The mouse is evidently rare or irregular in  its distribution since Alcorn did considerable trapping in the area  from which only one was taken.      Microtus pennsylvanicus    Pennsylvania Meadow Mouse    The Pennsylvania meadow mouse is an abundant mammal along the Alaska  Highway. Alcorn obtained specimens at most of his trapping stations,  frequently in company with _Microtus oeconomus_ at the more northern  localities. A preferred habitat was grassy areas and willow clumps  along streams or at the edges of lakes. The best catches were made  along well-used runways, especially where there were piles of cut  grass. These runways were used also by _Clethrionomys_ and other small  animals. Specimens of _M. pennsylvanicus_ were frequently taken in  the daytime; one was taken on June 29 as it was swimming at the edge  of a small lake"]]]
