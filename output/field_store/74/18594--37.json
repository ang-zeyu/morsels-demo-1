So  you chuck them in, and are no more bothered by them until the  psychological moment.    [Illustration: The author doing a little washing on his own account]    On a walking trip, however, the affair is different. You can take canned  goods, if you want to. But their transportation would require another  Indian; another Indian means more grub and more equipment; and so at the  last you find yourself at the head of an unwieldy caravan. You find it  much pleasanter to cut the canned goods, and to strike out with a single  companion.    [Sidenote: Common Sense Should Rule]    After all, it is an affair of common sense; but even common sense when  confronted by a new problem, needs a certain directing. The province of  these articles is to offer that direction; I do not claim that my way is  the only way, nor am I rash enough to claim it is the best way. But it  is my way, and if any one will follow it, he will be as comfortable and  as well suited as I am, which is at least better than going it  blind.    FOOTNOTE:    [1] The Forest.          CHAPTER III    PERSONAL EQUIPMENT      IN discussion of the details of equipment, I shall first of all take up  in turn each and every item you could possibly need, whether you intend  to travel by horse, by canoe, or on your own two feet. Of course you  will not carry all of these things on any one trip. What is permissible  for horse traveling would be absurd for a walking trip; and some  things--such as a waterproof duffle bag--which you would need on a foot  tramp, would be useless where you have kyacks and a tarpaulin to protect  your belongings. Therefore I shall first enumerate all articles of all  three classes of equipment; and then in a final summary segregate them  into their proper categories.    [Sidenote: Concerning Hats]    [Sidenote: Stetson Hat the Best]    Long experience by men practically concerned seems to prove that a  rather heavy felt hat is the best for all around use. Even in hot sun  it seems to be the most satisfactory, as, with proper ventilation, it  turns the sun's rays better even than light straw. Witness the Arizona  cowboy on his desert ranges. You will want a good hat, the best in  material that money can buy. A cheap article sags in the brim, tears in  the crown, and wets through like blotting paper the first time it rains.  I have found the Stetson, of the five to seven dollar grade, the most  satisfactory. If it is intended for woods travel where you are likely to  encounter much brush, get it of medium brim. In those circumstances I  find it handy to buy a size smaller than usual, and then to rip out the  sweat band. The friction of the felt directly against the forehead and  the hair will hold it on in spite of pretty sharp tugs by thorns and  wind. In the mountains or on the plains, you can indulge in a wider and  stiffer brim. Two buckskin thongs sewn on either side and to tie under  the \"back hair\" will hold it on, even against a head wind. A test will  show you how this can be. A leather band and buckle--or miniature cinch  and latigos--gives added security. I generally cut ample holes for  ventilation. In case of too many mosquitoes I stuff my handkerchief in  the crown.    [Sidenote: Kerchiefs]    About your neck you will want to wear a silk kerchief. This is to keep  out dust, and to prevent your neck from becoming reddened and chapped.  It, too, should be of the best quality. The poorer grades go to pieces  soon, and their colors are not fast. Get it big enough. At night you  will make a cap of it to sleep in; and if ever you happen to be caught  without extra clothes where it is very cold, you will find that the  kerchief tied around your middle, and next the skin, will help  surprisingly.    [Sidenote: Coats]    A coat is useless absolutely. A sweater is better as far as warmth goes;  a waistcoat beats it for pockets. You will not wear it during the day;  it wads up too much to be of much use at night. Even your trousers  rolled up make a better temporary pillow. Leave it home; and you will  neither regret it nor miss it.    [Sidenote: Sweaters]    For warmth, as I have said, you will have your sweater. In this case,  too, I would impress the desirability of purchasing the best you can  buy. And let it be a heavy one, of gray or a neutral brown.    [Sidenote: Buckskin Shirts]    But to my mind the best extra garment is a good ample buckskin shirt. It  is less bulky than the sweater, of less weight, and much warmer,  especially in a wind, while for getting through brush noiselessly it  cannot be improved upon. I do not know where you can buy one; but in any  case get it ample in length and breadth, and without the fringe. The  latter used to possess some significance beside ornamentation, for in  case of need the wilderness hunter could cut from it thongs and strings  as he needed them. Nowadays a man in a fringed buckskin shirt is  generally a fake built to deceive tourists. On the other hand a plain  woodsmanlike garment, worn loose and belted at the waist, looks always  at once comfortable and appropriate. Be sure that the skins of which it  is made are smoke tanned. The smoke tanned article will dry soft, while  the ordinary skin is hardening to almost the consistency of rawhide.  Good buckskins are difficult to get hold of--and it will take five to  make you a good shirt--but for this use they last practically forever.    [Sidenote: Overshirts]    Of course such a garment is distinctly an extra or outside garment. You  would find it too warm for ordinary wear. The outer shirt of your daily  habit is best made of rather a light weight of gray flannel. Most new  campers indulge in a very thick navy blue shirt, mainly, I believe,  because it contrasts picturesquely with a bandana around the neck. Such  a shirt almost always crocks, is sure to fade, shows dirt, and is  altogether too hot. A lighter weight furnishes all the protection you  need to your underclothes and turns sun quite as well. Gray is a neutral  color, and seems less often than any other to shame you to the wash  soap. A great many wear an ordinary cotton work shirt, relying for  warmth on the underclothes. There is no great objection to this, except  that flannel is better should you get rained on.    [Sidenote: Underclothes]    The true point of comfort is, however, your underwear. It should be of  wool. I know that a great deal has been printed against it, and a great  many hygienic principles are invoked to prove that linen, cotton, or  silk are better. But experience with all of them merely leads back to  the starting point. If one were certain never to sweat freely, and never  to get wet, the theories might hold. But once let linen or cotton or  silk undergarments get thoroughly moistened, the first chilly little  wind is your undoing. You will shiver and shake before the hottest fire,  and nothing short of a complete change and a rub-down will do you any  good.    Now, of course in the wilderness you expect to undergo extremes of  temperature, and occasionally to pass unprotected through a rainstorm or  a stream. Then you will discover that wool dries quickly; that even  when damp it soon warms comfortably to the body. I have waded all day in  early spring freshet water with no positive discomfort except for the  cold ring around my legs which marked the surface of the water.    [Sidenote: Wear Woolen Underclothes Always]    And if you are wise, you will wear full long-sleeved woolen undershirts  even on a summer trip. If it is a real trip, you are going to sweat  anyway, no matter how you strip down to the work. And sooner or later  the sun will dip behind a cloud or a hill; or a cool breezelet will  wander to you resting on the slope; or the inevitable chill of evening  will come out from the thickets to greet you--and you will be very glad  of your woolen underwear.    A great many people go to the opposite extreme. They seem to think that  because they are to live in the open air, they will probably freeze. As  a consequence of this delusion, they purchase underclothes an inch  thick. This is foolishness, not only because such a weight is  unnecessary and unhealthful, but also--even if it were merely a  question of warmth--because one suit of thick garments is not nearly so  warm as two suits of thin. Whenever the weather turns very cold on you,  just put on the extra undershirt over the one you are wearing, and you  will be surprised to discover how much warmth two gauze tissues--with  the minute air space between them--can give. Therefore, though you must  not fail to get full length woolen underclothes, you need not buy them  of great weight. The thinnest Jaeger is about right.    [Sidenote: The Laundry Problem]    Two undershirts and three pairs of drawers are all you ever will need on  the most elaborate trip. You perhaps cannot believe that until you have  gotten away from the idea that laundry must be done all at once. In the  woods it is much handier to do it a little at a time. Soap your  outershirt at night; rinse it in the morning; dry it on top of your pack  during the first two hours. In the meantime wear your sweater; or, if it  is warm enough, appear in your undershirt. When you change your  underclothes--which should be one garment at a time--do the same thing.  Thus always you will be possessed of a clean outfit without the  necessity of carrying a lot of extras.    [Sidenote: Trousers]    The matter of trousers is an important one; for unless you are possessed  of abundant means of transportation, those you have on will be all you  will take. I used to include an extra pair, but got over it. Even when  trout fishing I found that by the time I had finished standing around  the fire cooking, or yarning, I might have to change the underdrawers,  but the trousers themselves had dried"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32958"],[0,"Edge Hill: The Battle and Battlefield; With Notes on Banbury & Thereabout (#4)"],[1,"be done but  to pursue those that fled, and could not be contained by their commanders,  but with spurs and loose reins followed the chase which the left wing had  led them. Thus while victory was unquestionable, the King was left in  danger from the reserve of the Parliament, which, pretending to be  friends, broke in upon the foot, and did great execution.\" Certainly in  charge and counter charge at this stage of the attack, the  Parliamentarians show to no advantage, and the dispersal of the dragoons,  musketeers, and part of Fielding's horse, seems to have taken place, but  the subsequent successful charge of Balfour's and Stapleton's brigades  makes it clear that _they_ were not involved in any disaster.    On the right wing, soon after the time of Wilmot's charge near the Sun  Rising, Rupert's troops moved down the foot of the hill in the direction  of the Kineton road and towards Ramsay's horse, which advanced to meet  them. The Parliamentary general had lined the hedgerows on his flank with  musketeers, and had placed ranks of musketeers between his horse. But as  the cavaliers[3] swept down the slope a defect was visible in the  Parliamentarian ranks, and Sir Faithful Fortescue's Irish troop threw off  their orange scarves and deserted bodily, not quite soon enough, it seems,  to save themselves, for a score or so of saddles were emptied in the  onrush of Rupert's cavaliers. The roundhead ranks were disordered, for  the troops had fired their long pieces wildly, and scarcely waiting the  meeting, they fled, leaving the musketeers to be cut up. The troops of  cavaliers swept through them scattering and destroying all in their way;  then deflecting a little to the left they pressed back the mass of  fugitives upon the foot regiments of Essex, Mandeville and Chomley which  in turn were overthrown, and the artillery captured. Even Wharton's  regiment and Fairfax's reserve were hurled back. Ramsay, the cavalry  general, was carried for two miles in the melee, and with some of his  troopers found a way through the hostile lines to Banbury.[a] Rupert  continued in unsparing pursuit even into the streets of Kineton and as far  as Chadshunt. Thus was the left wing of Lord Essex's army dispersed,  though to reform for a later phase of the fight. After so much success the  baggage proved to be too attractive to the victors, and had the time  wasted in plundering been spent in an attack upon the rear of the  Parliamentarian army, then the reign of Charles Stuart might have had a  less tragic ending. But with all this, it must be borne in mind that the  incident of the rolling up of a wing was repeated in other battles of the  war which were more disastrous to the King's cause. Sir James Ramsay at a  Court Martial at St. Albans[Vn] in November of the same year made a  vindication of his conduct.    An amusing letter from Captain Kightley tells of this phase of the fight.  He admits that in part his own regiment ran away, and it seems to be  probable that Captain John Fiennes was in no better way, though in the  subsequent rally and attack upon Prince Rupert both did very good service.    The right wing of the Puritan forces had in the meantime become  aggressive. It was the beginning of the great turning movement which was  repeated in each of the great battles of the war by the Parliamentarians,  in fact, so evident at Naseby and Marston Moor, as to compel belief in  studied uniformity of plan. The abandonment or weakening of one wing, then  the use of all the weight of the other wing with the foot as a centre  pivot, to out-flank, attack, and crush in succession the opposing wing and  centre of the Royalist army. Balfore, Meldrum, and Stapleton's brigades  charged Wilmot's cavalry with such vigour that these were thrust back upon  the three regiments of pikemen, under Lord Carnarvon, and chased up the  hill side. Cannon balls and other remains of the fight found on the hill  slopes at Lower Westcote near the Sun Rising are evidence of this attack.  The infantry under Roberts and Constable having moved forward to aid in  the attack upon Carnarvon, now wheeled upon the King's centre, which soon  became the focus of a fierce and bloody fight, for the elated Roundhead  horse, after crushing in the Royalist left wing, hurled themselves also  upon the flanks of the nearest troops of the King's centre, and the  blue-coated Broughton horsemen had a busy time of it amongst the royalist  gunners as they rode through the battery. Earl Lindsay's Lincolnshire  regiment, which he had led pike in hand, received the brunt of the attack;  it was overpowered, and the unfortunate general left for dead with a  musket ball in his thigh. The Red Regiment moved up in support, only in  turn to be cut up and almost annihilated, and Lord Willoughby was made  prisoner also in the attempt to rescue his father the Earl. Then followed  a brilliant personal fight for the royal standard, but the Puritan  horseman Copley cut down Sir Edmund Verney, knight marshal of the King's  horse, and standard bearer, and secured the prize. The success of this  attack was largely brought about by the ruse alluded to, where,  \"pretending to be friends,\" they broke in upon the King's regiments. If  it is true that they got so near as to shake hands, the business must have  been very simple. Verney had presentiment of his death, and the severed  hand clasping the standard shaft is said to be yet sadly searched for by  the ghost of Claydon House.[Vr] On the finger of the hand was a ring, a  king's gift. Nugent says about the standard's recapture: \"The Royal  standard was taken by Mr. Young, one of Sir William Constable's ensigns,  and delivered by Lord Essex to his own Secretary, Chambers, who rode by  his side. Elated by the prize, the Secretary rode about, more proudly than  wisely, waving it round his head. Whereupon in the confusion, one of the  King's officers, Captain Smith, of the Lord John Stewart's troop, seeing  the standard captured, threw round him the orange scarf of a fallen  Parliamentarian, and riding in among the lines of his enemies, told the  Secretary that 'it were a shame that so honourable a trophy of war should  be borne by a penman.' To which suggestions the credulous guardian of this  honourable trophy consenting, surrendered it to the disguised cavalier,  who galloped back with it amain, and before evening received knighthood[4]  under its shadow.\"    Brooke's, Hollis', and Ballard's infantry, moved across part of the ground  abandoned by Ramsay's horse to attack the right flank of the King's  centre, an attack which soon becomes as disastrous to the Royalists as  that on the other flank where Lindsay has fallen. In fact, the regiments  of foot from the Parliamentary rear with Constable's infantry and  Stapleton's horse, made a combined assault upon the King's centre, which  they commenced breaking up. In vain were the royalist reserves hurried  forward. The Blue Regiment was cut off by Sir Arthur Haselrigge. Stapleton  made a dash, and the King, who had been watching the fickle fortunes of  his soldiers from a mound (now the King's Clump) near Radway, narrowly  escaped being made a prisoner. The timely interference of a body of  royalist horse--an interference not of sufficient weight to _stop_ the  tide of the Puritan attack, but only to stay it for a few moments--enabled  the King to gain the shelter of the hill, whither also the fragments of  some of his regiments are compelled to follow.      [Illustration: II    BATTLE OF EDGE HILL.    Advance of Hampden_Retreat of Rupert & King]      Meanwhile Rupert had been lost to sight in Kineton streets. When he  learned that the fortunes of the day were, in other parts of the field, in  full flow against his cause, he and his cavaliers re-formed for the  retreat. The place is still known as Prince Rupert's Headland. There was,  however, another factor to be taken into consideration. Some of Hampden's  green-coated soldiers, stimulated no doubt by the sounds of the fight, had  in the meantime come up from Stratford-on-Avon, and were prepared to  dispute Rupert's return. They also succeeded in re-forming many of the  fugitives, in which duty Captains Cromwell,[5] Nathaniel Fiennes and  Kightley, took part.[q] The guns and infantry opened fire upon the  retreating cavaliers, who had a hard fight to regain the hill butt, for  Stapleton's horse, after fighting along the whole of the Royalist line,  chased them home. Nevertheless, two of the royal regiments refused to be  beaten; falling back upon their guns, they made a stand, probably along  the line from Radway to Bullet Hill, and there, reinforced by Rupert's  returning troops, they held their ground, repulsing the Parliamentarian  attacks, and so says Fiennes,[PB] \"horse and foot stood together against  horse and foot until night, when the Royalists retired up hill.\" It is  probably from this stage of the fight that Bullet Hill got its name. The  braided lovelock of many a cavalier who rode so exultingly down the hill  in the afternoon sunlight had a stain of a far deeper colour 'ere sunset,  and with the phase of the fight following the straggling return of  Rupert's Horse, the events of the day seem to have ended. The King would  have tried a final charge with some unbroken regiments to test once more  the fortunes of the day, but was with difficulty persuaded from so  perilous an enterprise.    Each side claims that only the night prevented a completely victorious  issue for its cause, but when we consider that the right wing and centre  of the King's army were disorganised, and in part driven up the hill, and  that the Parliamentarians were in possession of the battle ground, the  Royalists retaining possession only of the low ground from Radway to  Bullet Hill, it seems that the advantage rested on the Puritan side.  One[a] remained master of the field of battle, the other kept the London  road.    Amongst the several estimates of "]]]
