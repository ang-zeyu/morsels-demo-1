The distance of the Sun has been determined by several different methods  the principles of which do not concern us here, but they agree in giving  the mean distance of the Sun as a little less than 93,000,000 miles; that  is to say, it would require 11,720 worlds as large as our own to be put  side by side in order to bridge the chasm between the two. Or a traveller  going round the Earth at its equator would have to repeat the journey 3730  times before he had traversed a space equal to the Sun's distance.    But knowing the Sun's distance, we are able to deduce its actual diameter,  its superficial extent, and its volume, for its apparent diameter can  readily be measured. Its actual diameter then comes out as 866,400 miles,  or 109.4 times that of the Earth. Its surface exceeds that of the Earth  11,970 times; its volume, 1,310,000 times.    But the weight of the Sun is known as well as its size; this follows as a  consequence of gravitation. For the planets move in orbits under the  influence of the Sun's attraction; the dimensions of their orbits are  known, and the times taken in describing them; the amount of the  attractive force therefore is also known, that is to say, the mass of the  Sun. This is 332,000 times the mass of the Earth; and as the latter has  been determined as equal to about      6,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 tons    that of the Sun would be equal to      2,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 tons.    It will be seen that the proportion of the volume of the Sun to that of  the Earth is greater than the proportion of its mass to the Earth's  mass--almost exactly four times greater; so that the mean density of the  Sun can be only one-fourth that of the Earth. Yet, if we calculate the  force of gravity at the surfaces of both Sun and Earth, we find that the  Sun has a great preponderance. Its mass is 332,000 times that of the  Earth, but to compare it with the attraction of the Earth's surface we  must divide by (109.4){2}, since the distance of the Sun's centre from its  surface is 109.4 times as great as the corresponding distance in the case  of the Earth, and the force of gravity diminishes as the square of the  increased distance. This gives the force of gravity at the solar surface  as 27.65 times its power at the surface of the Earth, so that a body  weighing one ton here would weigh 27 tons 13 cwt. if it were taken to the  Sun.[8]    This relation is one of great importance when we realize that the pressure  of the Earth's atmosphere is 14.7 lb. on the square inch at the sea  level; that is to say, if we could take a column of air one square inch in  section, extending from the surface of the Earth upwards to the very limit  of the atmosphere, we should find that it would have this weight. If we  construct a water barometer, the column of water required to balance the  atmosphere must be 34 feet high, while the height of the column of mercury  in a mercurial barometer is 30 inches high, for the weight of 30 cubic  inches of mercury or of 408 cubic inches of water (34 x 12 = 408) is 14.7  lb.    If, now, we ascend a mountain, carrying a mercurial barometer with us we  should find that it would fall about one inch for the first 900 feet of  our ascent; that is to say, we should have left one-thirtieth of the  atmosphere below us by ascending 900 feet. As we went up higher we should  find that we should have to climb more than 900 feet further in order that  the barometer might fall another inch; and each successive inch, as we  went upward, would mean a longer climb. At the height of 2760 feet the  barometer would have fallen three inches; we should have passed through  one-tenth of the atmosphere. At the height of 5800 feet, we should have  passed through one-fifth of the atmosphere, the barometer would have  dropped six inches; and so on, until at about three and a third miles  above sea level the barometer would read fifteen inches, showing that we  had passed through half the atmosphere. Mont Blanc is not quite three  miles high, so that in Europe we cannot climb to the height where half the  atmosphere is left below us, and there is no terrestrial mountain anywhere  which would enable us to double the climb; that is to say, to ascend six  and two-third miles. Could we do so, however, we should find that the  barometer had fallen to seven and a half inches; that the second ascent of  three and a third miles had brought us through half the remaining  atmosphere, so that only one-fourth still remained above us. In the  celebrated balloon ascent made by Mr. Coxwell and Mr. Glaisher on  September 5, 1861, an even greater height was attained, and it was  estimated that the barometer fell at its lowest reading to seven inches,  which would correspond to a height of 39,000 feet.    But on the Sun, where the force of gravity is 27.65 times as great as at  the surface of the Earth, it would, if all the other conditions were  similar, only be necessary to ascend one furlong, instead of three and a  third miles, in order to reach the level of half the surface pressure, and  an ascent of two furlongs would bring us to the level of quarter pressure,  and so on. If then the solar atmosphere extends inwards, below the  apparent surface, it should approximately double in density with each  furlong of descent. These considerations, if taken alone, would point to a  mean density of the Sun not as we know it to be, less than that of the  Earth, but immeasurably greater; but the discordance is sufficiently  explained when we come to another class of facts.    These relate to the temperature of the Sun, and to the enormous amount of  light and heat which it radiates forth continually. This entirely  transcends our power to understand or appreciate. Nevertheless, the  astonishing figures which the best authorities give us may, by their  vastness, convey some rough general impression that may be of service.  Thus Prof. C. A. Young puts the total quantity of sunlight as equivalent  to      1,575,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 standard candles.    The intensity of sunlight at each point of the Sun's surface is variously  expressed as      190,000 times that of a standard candle,    5300 times that of the metal in a Bessemer converter,    146 times that of a calcium light,    or, 3.4 times that of an electric arc.    The same authority estimates at 30 _calories_ the value of the _Solar  Constant_; that is to say, the heat which, if our atmosphere were removed,  would be received from the Sun in a minute of time upon a square metre of  the Earth's surface that had the Sun in its zenith, would be sufficient to  raise the temperature of a kilogram of water 30 degrees Centigrade. This  would involve that the heat radiation from each square metre of the Sun's  surface would equal 1,340,000 calories; or sufficient to melt through in  each minute of time a shell of ice surrounding the Sun to the thickness of  58.2 feet. Prof. Abbot's most recent determination of the solar constant  diminishes these estimates by one third; but he still gives the probable  temperature of the solar surface as not far short of 7000 degrees  Centigrade, or about 12,000 degrees Fahrenheit.    The Sun, then, presents us with temperatures and pressures which entirely  surpass our experience on the Earth. The temperatures, on the one hand,  are sufficient to convert into a permanent gas every substance with which  we are acquainted; the pressures, on the other hand, apart from the high  temperatures, would probably solidify every element, and the Sun, as a  whole, would present itself to us as a comparatively small solid globe,  with a density like that of platinum. With both factors in operation, we  have the result already given: a huge globe, more than one hundred times  the diameter of the Earth, yet only one-fourth its density, and gaseous  probably throughout the whole of its enormous bulk.    What effect have these two factors, so stupendous in scale, upon its  visible surface? What is the appearance of the Sun?    It appears to be a large glowing disc, sensibly circular in outline, with  its edge fairly well-defined both as seen in the telescope and as  registered on photographs. In the spectroscope, or when in an eclipse of  the Sun the Moon covers the whole disc, a narrow serrated ring is seen  surrounding the rim, like a velvet pile of a bright rose colour. This  crimson rim, the sierra or _chromosphere_ as it is usually called, is  always to be found edging the entire Sun, and therefore must carpet the  surface everywhere. But under ordinary conditions, we do not see the  chromosphere itself, but look down through it on the _photosphere_, or  general radiating surface. This, to the eye, certainly looks like a  definite shell, but some theorists have been so impressed with the  difficulty of conceiving that a gaseous body like the Sun could, under the  conditions of such stupendous temperatures as there exist, have any  defined limit at all, that they deny that what we see on the Sun is a real  boundary, and argue that it only appears so to us through the effects of  the anomalous refraction or dispersion of light. Such theories introduce  difficulties greater and more numerous than those that they clear away,  and they are not generally accepted by practical observers of the Sun.  They seem incompatible with the apparent structure of the photosphere,  which is everywhere made up of a complicated mottling: minute grains  somewhat resembling those of rice in shape, of intense brightness, and  irregularly scattered. This mottling is sometimes coarsely, sometimes  finely textured; in some regions it is sharp and well defined, in others  misty or blurred, and in both cases they are often arranged in large  elaborate patterns, the figures of the pattern sometimes extending for a  hundred thousand miles or more in any direction.

Since the destruction of  Algiers, by Lord Exmouth, and still later since the abolition of that  piratical kingdom by the French, such charitable bequests, having  become useless for their original purpose, have in some instances been  devoted to the promotion of education by a decree of Chancery. This is  the case with a large sum, usually known as 'Betton's gift,' in the  trusteeship of the Ironmongers' Company.    On his return to his native land the prospects of Cervantes were not  very flattering. He was now thirty-four years of age, and had spent  the best portion of his life without making any approach towards  eminence or even towards acquiring the means of subsistence; his  adventures, enterprises, and sufferings had, indeed, furnished him  with a stock from which in after years his powerful mind drew largely  in his writings; but since he did not at first devote himself to  literary pursuits, at least not to those of an author, they could not  afford him much consolation; and as to a military career, his wound  and long captivity seemed to exclude him from all hope in that  quarter. His family was poor, their scanty means having suffered from  the sum raised for his ransom; and his connexions and friends were  powerless to procure him any appointment at the court. He went to live  at Madrid, where his mother and sister then resided, and there once  more betook himself to the pursuit of his younger days. He shut  himself up, and eagerly employed his time in reading every kind of  books; Latin, Spanish, and Italian authors--all served to contribute  to his various erudition.    Three whole years were thus spent; till at length he turned his  reading to some account, by publishing, in 1584, a pastoral novel  entitled _Galataea_. Some authors, amongst whom is Pellicer, are  inclined to think that dramatic composition was the first in which he  appeared before the public; but such an opinion has, by competent  judges, been now abandoned. Galataea, which is interspersed with songs  and verses, is a work of considerable merit, quite sufficient, indeed,  though of course inferior to Don Quixote, to have gained for its  author a high standing amongst Spanish writers; though in it we  discern nothing of that peculiar style which has made Cervantes one of  the most remarkable writers that ever lived,--that insight into human  character, and that vein of humour with which he exposes and satirises  its failings. It being so full of short metrical effusions would  almost incline us to believe that it was written for the purpose of  embodying the varied contents of a sort of poetical commonplace-book;  some of which had, perhaps, been written when he was a youth under the  tuition of his learned preceptor Juan Lopez de Hoyos; others may have  been the pencillings of the weary hours of his long captivity in  Africa. As a specimen of his power in the Spanish language it is quite  worthy of him who in after years immortalised that tongue by the  romance of Don Quixote. It had been better for Cervantes had he gone  on in this sort of fictitious composition, instead of betaking himself  to the drama, in which he had very formidable rivals, and for which,  as was afterwards proved, his talents were less adapted.    On the 12th of December in the same year that his Galataea was  published, Cervantes married, at Esquivias, a young lady who was of  one of the first families of that place, and whose charms had  furnished the chief subject of his amatory poems; she was named Donna  Catalina de Salazar y Palacios y Vozmediano. Her fortune was but  small, and only served to keep Cervantes for some few months in  idleness; when his difficulties began to harass him again, and found  him as a married man less able to meet them. He then betook himself to  the drama, at which he laboured for several years, though with very  indifferent success. He wrote, in all, it is said thirty comedies; but  of these only eight remain, judging from the merits of which, we do  not seem to have sustained any great loss in the others not having  reached us.    It may appear strange at first that one who possessed such a wonderful  power of description and delineation of character as did Cervantes,  should not have been more successful in dramatic writing; but,  whatever may be the cause, certain it is that his case does not stand  alone. Men who have manifested the very highest abilities as  romance-writers, have, if not entirely failed, at least not been  remarkably successful, as composers of the drama; and of our own time,  who so great a delineator of character, or so happy in his incidents,  or so stirring in his plots, as the immortal Author of Waverley? Yet  the few specimens of dramatic composition which he has left us, only  serve to shew that, when _Waverley_, _Guy Mannering_, _Ivanhoe_, and  the rest of his romances are the delight of succeeding generations,  _Halidon Hill_ and the _House of Aspen_ will, with the _Numancia  Vengada_ of the author of Don Quixote, be buried in comparative  oblivion.    In 1588 Cervantes left Madrid, and settled at Seville, where, as he  himself tells us, \"he found something better to do than writing  comedies.\" This \"something better\" was probably an appointment in some  mercantile business; for we know that one of the principal branches of  his family were very opulent merchants at Seville at that time, and  through them he might obtain some means of subsistence less precarious  than that which depended upon selling his comedies for a few \"reals.\"  Besides, two of the Cervantes-Saavedra of Seville were themselves  amateur poets, and likely therefore to regard the more favourably  their poor relation, Miguel of Alcala de Henares, to whom they would  gladly intrust the management of some part of their mercantile  affairs. The change, however, of life did not prevent Cervantes from  still cultivating his old passion for literature; and we accordingly  find his name as one of the prize-bearers for a series of poems which  the Dominicans of Saragoza, in 1595, proposed to be written in praise  of St. Hyacinthus; one of the prizes was adjudged to \"Miguel Cervantes  Saavedra of Seville.\"    In 1596 we find two short poetical pieces of Cervantes written upon  the occasion of the gentlemen of Seville having taken arms, and  prepared to deliver themselves and the city of Cadiz from the power of  the English, who, under the famous Earl of Essex, had made a descent  upon the Spanish coast, and destroyed the shipping intended for a  second armada for the invasion of England. In 1598 Philip II. died;  and Cervantes wrote a sonnet, which he then considered the best of his  literary productions, upon a majestic tomb, of enormous height, to  celebrate the funeral of that monarch. On the day that Philip was  buried, a serious quarrel happened between the civil and  ecclesiastical authorities of Seville; and Cervantes was mixed up in  it, and was in some trouble for having dared to manifest his  disapprobation by hissing at some part of their proceedings, but we  are not told what.    In 1599 Cervantes went to Toledo, which is remarkable as being the  place where he pretended to discover the original manuscript of Don  Quixote, by the Arabian Cid Hamet Benengeli. It was about this time,  too, that he resided in La Mancha, where he projected and executed  part, at least, of his immortal romance of Don Quixote, and where he  also laid the scene of that \"ingenious gentleman's\" adventures. It  seems likely that, whatever may have been Cervantes' employment at  Seville, it involved frequent travelling; and this may account for the  very accurate knowledge which he displays of the different districts  which he describes in his tale; for it is certain that the earlier  part of his life could have afforded him no means of acquiring such  information. Some have thought also that he was occasionally employed  on government business, and that it was whilst on some commission of  this sort that he was ill-treated by the people of La Mancha, and  thrown into prison by them at Argasamilla. Whatever may have been the  cause of his imprisonment, he himself tells us in the prologue to Don  Quixote, that the first part of that work was composed in a jail.    But for fifteen years of Cervantes' life, from 1588 to 1603, we know  but very little of his pursuits; the notices we have of him during  that time are very few and unsatisfactory; and this is the more to be  regretted because it certainly was then that his great work was  conceived, and in part executed. Soon after the accession of Philip  the Third, he removed from Seville to Valladolid, probably for the  sake of being near the court of that monarch, who, though remarkable  for his indolence, yet professed himself the patron of letters. It was  whilst living here that the first part of Don Quixote was published,  but not at Valladolid; it appeared at Madrid, either at the end of  1604, or, at the latest, in 1605.    The records of the magistracy of Valladolid afford us some curious  particulars of our author's mode of life about the time of the  publication of Don Quixote. He was brought before the court of  justice, on suspicion of having been concerned in a nightly brawl and  murder, though he really had no share in it. A Spanish gentleman,  named Don Gaspar Garibay, was stabbed about midnight near the house of  Cervantes. When the alarm was raised, he was amongst the first to run  out and proffer every assistance in his power to the wounded man. The  neighbourhood was not very respectable, and this gave rise to our  author's subsequent trouble in the matter; for it was suspected that  the ladies of his household were, from the place where they lived,  persons of bad reputation, and that he himself had, in some shameful  affray, dealt the murderous blow with his own hand. He and all his  family were, in consequence, directly arrested, and only got at  liberty"]]]
