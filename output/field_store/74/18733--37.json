But this was not due  entirely to the merits of the play.  In its earliest version a  passage which an irritable courtier conceived to be derogatory to  his nation, the Scots, sent both Chapman and Jonson to jail; but  the matter was soon patched up, for by this time Jonson had  influence at court.    With the accession of King James, Jonson began his long and  successful career as a writer of masques.  He wrote more masques  than all his competitors together, and they are of an extraordinary  variety and poetic excellence.  Jonson did not invent the masque;  for such premeditated devices to set and frame, so to speak, a  court ball had been known and practised in varying degrees of  elaboration long before his time.  But Jonson gave dramatic value  to the masque, especially in his invention of the antimasque, a  comedy or farcical element of relief, entrusted to professional  players or dancers.  He enhanced, as well, the beauty and dignity  of those portions of the masque in which noble lords and ladies  took their parts to create, by their gorgeous costumes and artistic  grouping and evolutions, a sumptuous show.  On the mechanical and  scenic side Jonson had an inventive and ingenious partner in Inigo  Jones, the royal architect, who more than any one man raised the  standard of stage representation in the England of his day.  Jonson  continued active in the service of the court in the writing of  masques and other entertainments far into the reign of King  Charles; but, towards the end, a quarrel with Jones embittered his  life, and the two testy old men appear to have become not only a  constant irritation to each other, but intolerable bores at court.  In \"Hymenaei,\" \"The Masque of Queens,\" \"Love Freed from Ignorance,\"  \"Lovers made Men,\" \"Pleasure Reconciled to Virtue,\" and many more  will be found Jonson's aptitude, his taste, his poetry and  inventiveness in these by-forms of the drama; while in \"The Masque  of Christmas,\" and \"The Gipsies Metamorphosed\" especially, is  discoverable that power of broad comedy which, at court as well as  in the city, was not the least element of Jonson's contemporary  popularity.    But Jonson had by no means given up the popular stage when he  turned to the amusement of King James.  In 1605 \"Volpone\" was  produced, \"The Silent Woman\" in 1609, \"The Alchemist\" in the  following year.  These comedies, with \"Bartholomew Fair,\" 1614,  represent Jonson at his height, and for constructive cleverness,  character successfully conceived in the manner of caricature, wit  and brilliancy of dialogue, they stand alone in English drama.  \"Volpone, or the Fox,\" is, in a sense, a transition play from the  dramatic satires of the war of the theatres to the purer comedy  represented in the plays named above.  Its subject is a struggle of  wit applied to chicanery; for among its dramatis personae, from  the villainous Fox himself, his rascally servant Mosca, Voltore  (the vulture), Corbaccio and Corvino (the big and the little  raven), to Sir Politic Would-be and the rest, there is scarcely a  virtuous character in the play.  Question has been raised as to  whether a story so forbidding can be considered a comedy, for,  although the plot ends in the discomfiture and imprisonment of the  most vicious, it involves no mortal catastrophe.  But Jonson was on  sound historical ground, for \"Volpone\" is conceived far more  logically on the lines of the ancients' theory of comedy than was  ever the romantic drama of Shakespeare, however repulsive we may  find a philosophy of life that facilely divides the world into the  rogues and their dupes, and, identifying brains with roguery and  innocence with folly, admires the former while inconsistently  punishing them.    \"The Silent Woman\" is a gigantic farce of the most ingenious  construction.  The whole comedy hinges on a huge joke, played by a  heartless nephew on his misanthropic uncle, who is induced to take  to himself a wife, young, fair, and warranted silent, but who, in  the end, turns out neither silent nor a woman at all.  In \"The  Alchemist,\" again, we have the utmost cleverness in construction,  the whole fabric building climax on climax, witty, ingenious, and  so plausibly presented that we forget its departures from the  possibilities of life.  In \"The Alchemist\" Jonson represented, none  the less to the life, certain sharpers of the metropolis, revelling  in their shrewdness and rascality and in the variety of the  stupidity and wickedness of their victims.  We may object to the  fact that the only person in the play possessed of a scruple of  honesty is discomfited, and that the greatest scoundrel of all is  approved in the end and rewarded.  The comedy is so admirably  written and contrived, the personages stand out with such lifelike  distinctness in their several kinds, and the whole is animated with  such verve and resourcefulness that \"The Alchemist\" is a new marvel  every time it is read.  Lastly of this group comes the tremendous  comedy, \"Bartholomew Fair,\" less clear cut, less definite, and less  structurally worthy of praise than its three predecessors, but full  of the keenest and cleverest of satire and inventive to a degree  beyond any English comedy save some other of Jonson's own.  It is  in \"Bartholomew Fair\" that we are presented to the immortal  caricature of the Puritan, Zeal-in-the-Land Busy, and the  Littlewits that group about him, and it is in this extraordinary  comedy that the humour of Jonson, always open to this danger,  loosens into the Rabelaisian mode that so delighted King James in  \"The Gipsies Metamorphosed.\"  Another comedy of less merit is \"The  Devil is an Ass,\" acted in 1616.  It was the failure of this play  that caused Jonson to give over writing for the public stage for a  period of nearly ten years.    \"Volpone\" was laid as to scene in Venice.  Whether because of the  success of \"Eastward Hoe\" or for other reasons, the other three  comedies declare in the words of the prologue to \"The Alchemist\":         \"Our scene is London, 'cause we would make known       No country's mirth is better than our own.\"    Indeed Jonson went further when he came to revise his plays for  collected publication in his folio of 1616, he transferred the  scene of \"Every Man in His Humour\" from Florence to London also,  converting Signior Lorenzo di Pazzi to Old Kno'well, Prospero to  Master Welborn, and Hesperida to Dame Kitely \"dwelling i' the Old  Jewry.\"    In his comedies of London life, despite his trend towards  caricature, Jonson has shown himself a genuine realist, drawing  from the life about him with an experience and insight rare in any  generation.  A happy comparison has been suggested between Ben  Jonson and Charles Dickens.  Both were men of the people, lowly  born and hardly bred.  Each knew the London of his time as few men  knew it; and each represented it intimately and in elaborate  detail.  Both men were at heart moralists, seeking the truth by the  exaggerated methods of humour and caricature; perverse, even  wrong-headed at times, but possessed of a true pathos and largeness  of heart, and when all has been said--though the Elizabethan ran  to satire, the Victorian to sentimentality--leaving the world  better for the art that they practised in it.    In 1616, the year of the death of Shakespeare, Jonson collected his  plays, his poetry, and his masques for publication in a collective  edition.  This was an unusual thing at the time and had been  attempted by no dramatist before Jonson.  This volume published, in  a carefully revised text, all the plays thus far mentioned,  excepting \"The Case is Altered,\" which Jonson did not acknowledge,  \"Bartholomew Fair,\" and \"The Devil is an Ass,\" which was written  too late.  It included likewise a book of some hundred and thirty  odd \"Epigrams,\" in which form of brief and pungent writing Jonson  was an acknowledged master; \"The Forest,\" a smaller collection  of lyric and occasional verse and some ten \"Masques\" and  \"Entertainments.\"  In this same year Jonson was made poet laureate  with a pension of one hundred marks a year.  This, with his fees  and returns from several noblemen, and the small earnings of his  plays must have formed the bulk of his income.  The poet appears to  have done certain literary hack-work for others, as, for example,  parts of the Punic Wars contributed to Raleigh's \"History of the  World.\"  We know from a story, little to the credit of either, that  Jonson accompanied Raleigh's son abroad in the capacity of a tutor.  In 1618 Jonson was granted the reversion of the office of Master of  the Revels, a post for which he was peculiarly fitted; but he did  not live to enjoy its perquisites.  Jonson was honoured with  degrees by both universities, though when and under what  circumstances is not known.  It has been said that he narrowly  escaped the honour of knighthood, which the satirists of the day  averred King James was wont to lavish with an indiscriminate hand.  Worse men were made knights in his day than worthy Ben Jonson.    From 1616 to the close of the reign of King James, Jonson produced  nothing for the stage.  But he \"prosecuted\" what he calls \"his  wonted studies\" with such assiduity that he became in reality, as  by report, one of the most learned men of his time.  Jonson's  theory of authorship involved a wide acquaintance with books and  \"an ability,\" as he put it, \"to convert the substance or riches of  another poet to his own use.\"  Accordingly Jonson read not only the  Greek and Latin classics down to the lesser writers, but he  acquainted himself especially with the Latin writings of his  learned contemporaries, their prose as well as their poetry, their  antiquities and curious lore as well as their more solid learning.  Though a poor man, Jonson was an indefatigable collector of books.  He told Drummond that \"the Earl of Pembroke sent him 20 pounds every  first day of the new year "]]]
