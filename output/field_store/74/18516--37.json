Here, the first roaming and excitement  abated, they began to unlade the ships, and to build the fort and also  booths for their present sleeping. A church, too, they must have at  once, and forthwith made it with a stretched sail for roof and a board  between two trees whereon to rest Bible and Book of Prayer. Here, for  the first time in all this wilderness, rang English axe in American  forest, here was English law and an English town, here sounded English  speech. Here was placed the germ of that physical, mental, and,  spiritual power which is called the United States of America.        CHAPTER III. JAMESTOWN    In historians' accounts of the first months at Jamestown, too much,  perhaps, has been made of faction and quarrel. All this was there. Men  set down in a wilderness, amid Virginian heat, men, mostly young, of the  active rather than the reflective type, men uncompanioned by women and  children, men beset with dangers and sufferings that were soon to tag  heavily their courage and patience--such men naturally quarreled and  made up, quarreled again and again made up, darkly suspected each the  other, as they darkly suspected the forest and the Indian; then, need of  friendship dominating, embraced each the other, felt the fascination  of the forest, and trusted the Indian. However much they suspected  rebellion, treacheries, and desertions, they practiced fidelities,  though to varying degrees, and there was in each man's breast more or  less of courage and good intent. They were prone to call one another  villain, but actual villainy--save as jealousy, suspicion, and hatred  are villainy--seems rarely to have been present. Even one who was judged  a villain and shot for his villainy seems hardly to have deserved such  fate. Jamestown peninsula turned out to be feverous; fantastic  hopes were matched by strange fears; there were homesickness,  incompatibilities, unfamiliar food and water and air, class differences  in small space, some petty tyrannies, and very certain dangers. The  worst summer heat was not yet, and the fort was building. Trees must be  felled, cabins raised, a field cleared for planting, fishing and hunting  carried on. And some lading, some first fruits, must go back in the  ships. No gold or rubies being as yet found, they would send instead  cedar and sassafras--hard work enough, there at Jamestown, in the  Virginian low-country, with May warm as northern midsummer, and all the  air charged with vapor from the heated river, with exhalations from the  rank forest, from the many marshes.    \"The first night of our landing, about midnight,\" says George Percy in  his \"Discourse\", \"there came some Savages sayling close to our quarter;  presently there was an alarm given; upon that the savages ran away....  Not long after there came two Savages that seemed to be Commanders,  bravely dressed, with Crownes of coloured haire upon their heads, which  came as Messengers from the Werowance of Paspihe, telling us that their  Werowance was comming and would be merry with us with a fat Deere. The  eighteenth day the Werowance of Paspihe came himselfe to our quarter,  with one hundred Savages armed which guarded him in very warlike manner  with Bowes and Arrowes.\" Some misunderstanding arose. \"The Werowance,  [seeing] us take to our armes, went suddenly away with all his company  in great anger.\" The nineteenth day Percy with several others going into  the woods back of the peninsula met with a narrow path traced through  the forest. Pursuing it, they came to an Indian village. \"We Stayed  there a while and had of them strawberries and other thinges.... One  of the Savages brought us on the way to the Woodside where there was a  Garden of Tobacco and other fruits and herbes; he gathered Tobacco and  distributed to every one of us, so wee departed.\"    It is evident that neither race yet knew if it was to be war or peace.  What the white man thought and came to think of the red man has been set  down often enough; there is scantier testimony as to what was the red  man's opinion of the white man. Here imagination must be called upon.    Newport's instructions from the London Council included exploration  before he should leave the colonists and bring the three ships back to  England. Now, with the pinnace and a score of men, among whom was John  Smith, he went sixty miles up the river to where the flow is broken by  a world of boulders and islets, to the hills crowned today by Richmond,  capital of Virginia. The first adventurers called these rapid and  whirling waters the Falls of the Farre West. To their notion they must  lie at least half-way across the breadth of America. Misled by Indian  stories, they believed and wrote that five or six days' march from the  Falls of the Farre West, even through the thick forest, would bring them  to the South Sea. The Falls of the Farre West, where at Richmond the  James goes with a roaring sound around tree-crowned islet--it is strange  to think that they once marked our frontier! How that frontier has been  pushed westward is a romance indeed. And still, today, it is but a five  or six days' journey to that South Sea sought by those early Virginians.  The only condition for us is that we shall board a train. Tomorrow, with  the airship, the South Sea may come nearer yet!    The Indians of this part of the earth were of the great Algonquin  family, and the tribes with which the colonists had now to do  were drawn, probably by a polity based on blood ties, into a loose  confederation within the larger mass. Newport was \"told that the name of  the river was Powhatan, the name of the chief Powhatan, and the name of  the people Powhatans.\" But it seemed that the chief Powhatan was not at  this village but at another and a larger place named Werowocomoco, on  a second great river in the back country to the north and east of  Jamestown. Newport and his men were \"well entreated\" by the Indians.  \"But yet,\" says Percy, \"the Savages murmured at our planting in the  Countrie.\"    The party did not tarry up the river. Back came their boat through the  bright weather, between the verdurous banks, all green and flower-tinted  save where might be seen the brown of Indian clearings with bark-covered  huts and thin, up-curling blue smoke. Before them once more rose  Jamestown, palisaded now, and riding before it the three ships. And  here there barked an English dog, and here were Englishmen to welcome  Englishmen. Both parties had news to tell, but the town had most. On the  26th of May, Indians had made an attack four hundred of them with the  Werowance of Paspihe. One Englishman had been killed, a number wounded.  Four of the Council had each man his wound.    Newport must now lift anchor and sail away to England. He left at  Jamestown a fort \"having three Bulwarkes at every corner like a halfe  Moone, and foure or five pieces of Artillerie mounted in them,\" a street  or two of reed-thatched cabins, a church to match, a storehouse, a  market-place and drill ground, and about all a stout palisade with a  gate upon the river side. He left corn sown and springing high, and some  food in the storehouse. And he left a hundred Englishmen who had now  tasted of the country fare and might reasonably fear no worse chance  than had yet befallen. Newport promised to return in twenty weeks with  full supplies.    John Smith says that his enemies, chief amongst whom was Wingfield,  would have sent him with Newport to England, there to stand trial for  attempted mutiny, whereupon he demanded a trial in Virginia, and got it  and was fully cleared. He now takes his place in the Council, beforetime  denied him. He has good words only for Robert Hunt, the chaplain, who,  he says, went from one to the other with the best of counsel. Were they  not all here in the wilderness together, with the savages hovering about  them like the Philistines about the Jews of old? How should the English  live, unless among themselves they lived in amity? So for the moment  factions were reconciled, and all went to church to partake of the Holy  Communion.    Newport sailed, having in the holds of his ships sassafras and valuable  woods but no gold to meet the London Council's hopes, nor any certain  news of the South Sea. In due time he reached England, and in due time  he turned and came again to Virginia. But long was the sailing to and  fro between the daughter country and the mother country and the lading  and unlading at either shore. It was seven months before Newport came  again.    While he sails, and while England-in-America watches for him longingly,  look for a moment at the attitude of Spain, falling old in the  procession of world-powers, but yet with grip and cunning left. Spain  misliked that English New World venture. She wished to keep these seas  for her own; only, with waning energies, she could not always enforce  what she conceived to be her right. By now there was seen to be much  clay indeed in the image. Philip the Second was dead; and Philip the  Third, an indolent king, lived in the Escurial.    Pedro de Zuniga is the Spanish Ambassador to the English Court. He has  orders from Philip to keep him informed, and this he does, and from time  to time suggests remedies. He writes of Newport and the First Supply.  \"Sire.... Captain Newport makes haste to return with some people--and  there have combined merchants and other persons who desire to establish  themselves there; because it appears to them the most suitable place  that they have discovered for privateering and making attacks upon  the merchant fleets of Your Majesty. Your Majesty will command to see  whether they will be allowed to remain there.... They are in a great  state of excitement about that place, and very much afraid lest Your  Majesty should drive them out of it.... And there are so many... who  speak already of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2900"],[0,"The Age of Invention: A Chronicle of Mechanical Conquest (#4)"],[1,"so, with vision undimmed, America's most famous citizen lived  on until near the end of the first year of George Washington's  administration. On April 17, 1790, his unconquerable spirit took its  flight.      In that year, 1790, was taken the First Census of the United States.  The new nation had a population of about four million people. It then  included practically the present territory east of the Mississippi,  except the Floridas, which belonged to Spain. But only a small part  of this territory was occupied. Much of New York and Pennsylvania was  savage wilderness. Only the seacoast of Maine was inhabited, and the  eighty-two thousand inhabitants of Georgia hugged the Savannah River.  Hardy pioneers had climbed the Alleghanies into Kentucky and Tennessee,  but the Northwest Territory--comprising Ohio, Michigan, Indiana,  Illinois, and Wisconsin--was not enumerated at all, so scanty were its  people, perhaps not more than four thousand.    Though the First Census did not classify the population by occupation it  is certain that nine-tenths of the breadwinners worked more or less upon  the soil. The remaining tenth were engaged in trade, transportation,  manufacturing, fishing and included also the professional men, doctors,  lawyers, clergymen, teachers, and the like. In other words, nine out of  ten of the population were engaged primarily in the production of food,  an occupation which today engages less than three out of ten. This  comparison, however, requires some qualification. The farmer and the  farmer's wife and children performed many tasks which are now done in  factories. The successful farmer on the frontier had to be a jack of  many trades. Often he tanned leather and made shoes for his family and  harness for his horses. He was carpenter, blacksmith, cobbler, and often  boat-builder and fisherman as well. His wife made soap and candles, spun  yarn and dyed it, wove cloth and made the clothes the family wore, to  mention only a few of the tasks of the women of the eighteenth century.    The organization of industry, however, was beginning. Here and there  were small paper mills, glass factories-though many houses in the back  country were without glass windows--potteries, and iron foundries and  forges. Capitalists, in some places, had brought together a few  handloom weavers to make cloth for sale, and the famous shoemakers of  Massachusetts commonly worked in groups.    The mineral resources of the United States were practically unknown. The  country seems to have produced iron enough for its simple needs, some  coal, copper, lead, gold, silver, and sulphur. But we may say that  mining was hardly practiced at all.    The fisheries and the shipyards were great sources of wealth, especially  for New England. The cod fishers numbered several hundred vessels and  the whalers about forty. Thousands of citizens living along the seashore  and the rivers fished more or less to add to the local food supply. The  deep-sea fishermen exported a part of their catch, dried and salted.  Yankee vessels sailed to all ports of the world and carried the greater  part of the foreign commerce of the United States. Flour, tobacco, rice,  wheat, corn, dried fish, potash, indigo, and staves were the principal  exports. Great Britain was the best customer, with the French West  Indies next, and then the British West Indies. The principal imports  came from the same countries. Imports and exports practically balanced  each other, at about twenty million dollars annually, or about five  dollars a head. The great merchants owned ships and many of them, such  as John Hancock of Boston, and Stephen Girard of Philadelphia, had grown  very rich.    Inland transportation depended on horses and oxen or boats. There were  few good roads, sometimes none at all save bridle paths and trails.  The settlers along the river valleys used boats almost entirely.  Stage-coaches made the journey from New York to Boston in four days in  summer and in six in winter. Two days were required to go between New  York and Philadelphia. Forty to fifty miles a day was the speed of the  best coaches, provided always that they did not tumble into the ditch.  In many parts of the country one must needs travel on horseback or on  foot.    Even the wealthiest Americans of those days had few or none of the  articles which we regard today as necessities of life. The houses were  provided with open--which, however cheerful, did not keep them warm--or  else with Franklin's stoves. To strike a fire one must have the flint  and tinderbox, for matches were unknown until about 1830. Candles made  the darkness visible. There was neither plumbing nor running water. Food  was cooked in the ashes or over an open fire.    The farmer's tools were no less crude than his wife's. His plough had  been little improved since the days of Rameses. He sowed his wheat  by hand, cut it with a sickle, flailed it out upon the floor, and  laboriously winnowed away the chaff.      In that same year, 1790, came a great boon and encouragement to  inventors, the first Federal Patent Act, passed by Congress on the 10th  of April. Every State had its own separate patent laws or regulations,  as an inheritance from colonial days, but the Fathers of the  Constitution had wisely provided that this function of government should  be exercised by the nation.* The Patent Act, however, was for a  time unpopular, and some States granted monopolies, particularly of  transportation, until they were forbidden to do so by judicial decision.         * The Constitution (Article 1, Section 8, Clause 8) empowers       Congress: \"To promote the Progress of Science and useful       Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors       the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and       Discoveries.\"    The first Patent Act provided that an examining board, consisting of the  Secretary of State, the Secretary of War, and the Attorney-General, or  any two of them, might grant a patent for fourteen years, if they  deemed the invention useful and important. The patent itself was to be  engrossed and signed by the President, the Secretary of State, and  the Attorney-General. And the cost was to be three dollars and seventy  cents, plus the cost of copying the specifications at ten cents a sheet.    The first inventor to avail himself of the advantages of the new Patent  Act was Samuel Hopkins of Vermont, who received a patent on the 31st of  July for an improved method of \"Making Pot and Pearl Ashes.\" The world  knows nothing of this Samuel Hopkins, but the potash industry, which was  evidently on his mind, was quite important in his day. Potash, that is,  crude potassium carbonate, useful in making soap and in the manufacture  of glass, was made by leaching wood ashes and boiling down the lye. To  produce a ton of potash, the trees on an acre of ground would be cut  down and burned, the ashes leached, and the lye evaporated in great iron  kettles. A ton of potash was worth about twenty-five dollars. Nothing  could show more plainly the relative value of money and human labor in  those early times.    Two more patents were issued during the year 1790. The second went to  Joseph S. Sampson of Boston for a method of making candles, and the  third to Oliver Evans, of whom we shall learn more presently, for an  improvement in manufacturing flour and meal. The fourth patent was  granted in 1791 to Francis Baily of Philadelphia for making punches  for types. Next Aaron Putnam of Medford, Massachusetts, thought that  he could improve methods of distilling, and John Stone of Concord,  Massachusetts, offered a new method of driving piles for bridges. And  a versatile inventor, Samuel Mulliken of Philadelphia, received four  patents in one day for threshing grain, cutting and polishing marble,  raising a nap on cloth, and breaking hemp.    Then came improvements in making nails, in making bedsteads, in the  manufacture of boats, and for propelling boats by cattle. On August 26,  1791, James Rumsey, John Stevens, and John Fitch (all three will appear  again in this narrative) took out patents on means of propelling boats.  On the same day Nathan Read received one on a process for distilling  alcohol.    More than fifty patents were granted under the Patent Act of 1790, and  mechanical devices were coming in so thick and fast that the department  heads apparently found it inconvenient to hear applications. So the  Act of 1790 was repealed. The second Patent Act (1793) provided that a  patent should be granted as a matter of routine to any one who swore to  the originality of his device and paid the sum of thirty dollars as a  fee. No one except a citizen, however, could receive a patent. This act,  with some amendments, remained in force until 1836, when the present  Patent Office was organized with a rigorous and intricate system for  examination of all claims in order to prevent interference. Protection  of the property rights of inventors has been from the beginning of the  nation a definite American policy, and to this policy may be ascribed  innumerable inventions which have contributed to the greatness of  American industry and multiplied the world's comforts and conveniences.    Under the second Patent Act came the most important invention yet  offered, an invention which was to affect generations then unborn. This  was a machine for cleaning cotton and it was offered by a young Yankee  schoolmaster, temporarily sojourning in the South.        CHAPTER II. ELI WHITNEY AND THE COTTON GIN    The cotton industry is one of the most ancient. One or more of the many  species of the cotton plant is indigenous to four continents, Asia,  Africa, and the Americas, and the manufacture of the fiber into yarn  and cloth seems to have developed independently in each of them. We find  mention of cotton in India fifteen hundred years before Christ. The East  Indians, with only the crudest machinery,"]]]
