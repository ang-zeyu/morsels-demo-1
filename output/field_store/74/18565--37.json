Salt, pepper, Tobasco, horseradish and Tomato catsup.    PROCESS: If possible, have the little Blue Points. Open, loosen, and  leave them on the lower shell. Fill soup plates with shaved ice and  arrange shell on ice having the small end of shells point toward center  of the plate. Wash lemons, cut in quarters, remove seeds and serve  one-quarter in center of each plate. Garnish with sprays of parsley  arranged between the shells. Pass remaining ingredients on a small  silver tray, or a cocktail dressing may be made and served in a small  glass dish and passed to each guest.      CONSOMME DUCHESS    Consomme served with a meringue, prepared as follows: Beat the whites of  eggs very stiff and drop by heaping tablespoonsful into milk heated to  the scalding point in a shallow vessel (a dripping pan is the best),  using care that milk does not scorch. Turn each spoonful, allowing it to  cook, until it sets. Place one of these individual meringues on the top  of each service of consomme, and sprinkle with finely chopped parsley.  Serve with Imperial Sticks.      IMPERIAL STICKS    Cut stale bread in one-third inch slices, remove the crusts. Spread  thinly with butter. Cut slices in one-third inch strips, put on a tin  sheet and bake until a delicate brown in a hot oven. Pile \"log cabin\"  fashion on a plate covered with a doily, or serve two sticks on plate by  the side of cup in which soup is served.      CRAB MEAT IN TIMBALE CASES              8 Timbale cases.            2 cups crab meat.            3 tablespoons butter.            3 tablespoons flour.            Yolks 2 eggs.            1 tablespoon onion finely chopped.            Salt, pepper, paprika.            Few grains each cayenne, mustard and nutmeg.            2 cups hot thin cream.    PROCESS: Melt butter in a sauce pan, add onion and cook five minutes  without browning, stirring constantly. Add flour and stir until well  blended. Add hot cream gradually, continue stirring, add seasoning to  taste. Remove from range and add egg yolks slightly beaten. Reheat crab  meat in sauce (over hot water). Serve in Swedish Timbales.      SWEDISH TIMBALES              1 cup flour.            1/2 teaspoon salt.            1 teaspoon sugar.            1 egg.            2/3 cup milk.            1 tablespoon olive oil.    PROCESS: Mix and sift flour, salt and sugar, add milk slowly, stirring  constantly, add well beaten egg and olive oil. Mixture should be very  smooth, strain and let stand over night. Heat a timbale iron in hot  Cottolene, drain and dip iron into batter, (having batter in a small  pitcher), place in hot Cottolene and fry until crisp and delicately  browned. Remove from iron and invert on brown paper. These dainty cases  are for all kinds of creamed mixtures. They are used instead of patty  shells or croustades.      ROAST GOOSE    PREPARING THE GOOSE FOR THE OVEN    Singe, and remove all pin feathers. Before drawing the bird give it a  thorough scrubbing with a brush, in a warm Fairy soap solution. This is  very necessary for it cleans off all dirt that becomes mixed with the  oily secretions, and opens and cleanses the pores that the oil may be  more readily extracted. Draw and remove everything that can be taken  out, then rinse thoroughly and wipe inside and out, with a clean crash  towel; sprinkle the inside lightly with salt, pepper, and powdered sage.  (The latter may be omitted.)    Stuff with the following mixture and truss as turkey.      POTATO AND NUT STUFFING    (FOR ROAST GOOSE OR DUCK)              4 cups hot mashed potatoes.            2-1/2 tablespoons finely chopped onion or chives.            1 cup English Walnut meats chopped moderately.            1/2 teaspoon paprika.            1-1/4 teaspoon salt.            1/2 cup cream.            2 tablespoons butter.            Yolks of 2 eggs.            1 teaspoon sweet herbs if the flavor is desired.    PROCESS: Mix the ingredients in the order given and fill the body of the  goose.      ROASTING THE BIRD    After trussing, place the goose on a rack in a dripping pan, sprinkle  with salt, cover the breast with thin slices of fat salt pork, and place  in the oven. Cook three-quarters of an hour, basting often with the fat  in the pan. Then remove pan from oven and drain off all the fat. Remove  the slices of pork and sprinkle again with salt and dredge with flour  and return to oven. When the flour is delicately browned, add one cup of  boiling water and baste often; add more water when necessary. Sprinkle  lightly with salt and again dredge with flour. Cook until tender, from  one and one-half to three hours, according to the age of the bird. If  you have a very young goose it is infinitely better to steam or braise  it until tender, then dredge it with salt and flour and brown it richly  in the oven. Serve on a bed of cress, garnish with Baked Snow or  Jonathan apples.      CHANTILLY APPLE SAUCE (WITH HORSERADISH)    Pare, core and cut in quarters, five medium-sized Greenings. Cook with  very little water; when quite dry, rub through a fine puree strainer. To  the pulp add one-half cup granulated sugar, five tablespoons grated  horseradish, then fold in an equal quantity of whipped cream. Serve at  once with roast goose, ducks or goslings.      ONIONS AU GRATIN    Cook one quart of uniform-sized, silver-skinned onions in boiling salted  water. When quite tender, drain and turn into a baking dish; cover with  Cream Sauce (see Page 151), sprinkle the top with fine buttered cracker  crumbs and finish cooking. Brown crumbs delicately.      ENDIVE, CELERY AND GREEN PEPPER SALAD    Select crisp, well-bleached heads of endive, separate the leaves,  keeping the green leaves separate from the bleached; wash and dry.  Dispose the leaves on individual plates of ample size. Arrange the green  leaves first, then the bleached leaves until a nest has been formed;  fill the centers with the hearts of celery cut in one-half inch pieces.  Cut a slice from the stem end of crisp red and green peppers, remove the  seeds and veins and cut in the thinnest shreds possible, using the  shears. Strew these shreds over each portion and, just before serving,  marinate each with French Dressing.      VANILLA ICE CREAM              3/4 cup sugar.            1/3 cup water.            1 quart cream.            1-1/2 tablespoons vanilla.    PROCESS: Make a syrup by boiling sugar and water three minutes. Cool  slightly and add to cream, add vanilla and freeze in the usual way. Pack  in a brick-shape mold. Bury in salt and ice, let stand several hours.  Remove from mold to serving platter and pour around each portion Hot  Chocolate Sauce.      HOT CHOCOLATE SAUCE    Melt two squares chocolate in a sauce-pan, add one cup sugar, one  tablespoon butter and two-thirds cup boiling water. Simmer fifteen  minutes. Cool slightly and add three-fourths teaspoon vanilla.      COCOANUT CUBES    Use recipe for Bride's Cake (see recipe on Page 175). Bake in a sheet.  When cool cut in two-inch cubes and cover each cube with Boiled  Frosting; sprinkle thickly with fresh grated cocoanut.      CHOCOLATE NUT CAKE              1/3 cup Cottolene.            2 cups sugar.            4 eggs.            1 cup milk.            2-1/3 cups flour.            4 teaspoons baking powder.            1/4 teaspoon salt.            2 squares chocolate melted.            3/4 cup English walnut meats broken in pieces.            1/2 teaspoon vanilla.    PROCESS: Cream Cottolene, add gradually one cup sugar, stirring  constantly. Beat egg yolks thick and light, add gradually remaining cup  of sugar; combine mixtures. Add melted chocolate. Mix and sift flour,  baking powder and salt; add to first mixture alternately with milk. Add  nut meats and vanilla, then cut and fold in the whites of eggs beaten  stiff. Turn into a well-greased tube pan and bake forty-five minutes in  a moderate oven. Cool and spread with boiled frosting.

EGG BALLS              1 hard cooked egg.            1/8 teaspoon salt.            Few grains pepper.            Few drops onion juice.            1 teaspoon thick cream.            1/4 teaspoon finely chopped parsley.    PROCESS: Mash yolk, rub through a sieve, add finely chopped white,  seasonings, parsley and cream. Moisten with some of the yolk of a raw  egg until of the consistency to handle. Shape with the hands in tiny  balls and poach two minutes in boiling water or a little consomme.  Remove with skimmer. Serve at once.      BREADED SEA BASS    Remove the skin from a sea bass, bone and cut fillets in pieces for  serving. Rub over with the cut side of a lemon, sprinkle with salt,  pepper, dredge with flour.

Not to agree to an unsettling and impossible trade, but to judge  their real purposes. I did not count on their evading the meeting.\"    He sighed. \"I suppose it isn't our fault. You are right in one thing, at  any rate. The world has been at peace too long. We are losing a healthy  sense of suspicion.\"    The Astronomer's mild voice rose to an unusual pitch and he said, \"I  _will_ speak. I tell you that there is no reason to suppose they can  possibly be hostile. They are small, yes, but that is only important  because it is a reflection of the fact that their native worlds are  small. Our world has what is for them a normal gravity, but because of  our much higher gravitational potential, our atmosphere is too dense to  support them comfortably over sustained periods. For a similar reason  the use of the world as a base for interstellar travel, except for trade  in certain items, is uneconomical. And there are important differences  in chemistry of life due to the basic differences in soils. They  couldn't eat our food or we theirs.\"    \"Surely all this can be overcome. They can bring their own food, build  domed stations of lowered air pressure, devise specially designed  ships.\"    \"They can. And how glibly you can describe feats that are easy to a race  in its youth. It is simply that they don't have to do any of that. There  are millions of worlds suitable for them in the Galaxy. They don't need  this one which isn't.\"    \"How do you know? All this is their information again.\"    \"This I was able to check independently. I am an astronomer, after all.\"    \"That is true. Let me hear what you have to say then, while we walk.\"    \"Then, sir, consider that for a long time our astronomers have believed  that two general classes of planetary bodies existed. First, the planets  which formed at distances far enough from their stellar nucleus to  become cool enough to capture hydrogen. These would be large planets  rich in hydrogen, ammonia and methane. We have examples of these in the  giant outer planets. The second class would include those planets formed  so near the stellar center that the high temperature would make it  impossible to capture much hydrogen. These would be smaller planets,  comparatively poorer in hydrogen and richer in oxygen. We know that type  very well since we live on one. Ours is the only solar system we know in  detail, however, and it has been reasonable for us to assume that these  were the _only_ two planetary classes.\"    \"I take it then that there is another.\"    \"Yes. There is a super-dense class, still smaller, poorer in hydrogen,  than the inner planets of the solar system. The ratio of occurrence of  hydrogen-ammonia planets and these super-dense water-oxygen worlds of  theirs over the entire Galaxy--and remember that they have actually  conducted a survey of significant sample volumes of the Galaxy which we,  without interstellar travel, cannot do--is about 3 to 1. This leaves  them seven million super-dense worlds for exploration and colonization.\"    The Industrialist looked at the blue sky and the green-covered trees  among which they were making their way. He said, \"And worlds like ours?\"    The Astronomer said, softly, \"Ours is the first solar system they have  found which contains them. Apparently the development of our solar  system was unique and did not follow the ordinary rules.\"    The Industrialist considered that. \"What it amounts to is that these  creatures from space are asteroid-dwellers.\"    \"No, no. The asteroids are something else again. They occur, I was told,  in one out of eight stellar systems, but they're completely different  from what we've been discussing.\"    \"And how does your being an astronomer change the fact that you are  still only quoting their unsupported statements?\"    \"But they did not restrict themselves to bald items of information. They  presented me with a theory of stellar evolution which I had to accept  and which is more nearly valid than anything our own astronomy has ever  been able to devise, if we except possible lost theories dating from  Beforethewars. Mind you, their theory had a rigidly mathematical  development and it predicted just such a Galaxy as they describe. So you  see, they have all the worlds they wish. They are not land-hungry.  Certainly not for our land.\"    \"Reason would say so, if what you say is true. But creatures may be  intelligent and not reasonable. Our forefathers were presumably  intelligent, yet they were certainly not reasonable. Was it reasonable  to destroy almost all their tremendous civilization in atomic warfare  over causes our historians can no longer accurately determine?\" The  Industrialist brooded over it. \"From the dropping of the first atom bomb  over those islands--I forget the ancient name--there was only one end in  sight, and in plain sight. Yet events were allowed to proceed to that  end.\"    He looked up, said briskly, \"Well, where are we? I wonder if we are not  on a fool's errand after all.\"    But the Astronomer was a little in advance and his voice came thickly.  \"No fool's errand, sir. Look there.\"      VI    Red and Slim had trailed their elders with the experience of youth,  aided by the absorption and anxiety of their fathers. Their view of the  final object of the search was somewhat obscured by the underbrush  behind which they remained.    Red said, \"Holy Smokes. Look at that. It's all shiny silver or  something.\"    But it was Slim who was really excited. He caught at the other. \"I know  what this is. It's a space-ship. That must be why my father came here.  He's one of the biggest astronomers in the world and your father would  have to call him if a space-ship landed on his estate.\"    \"What are you talking about? Dad didn't even know that thing was there.  He only came here because I told him I heard the thunder from here.  Besides, there isn't any such thing as a space-ship.\"    \"Sure, there is. Look at it. See those round things. They are ports. And  you can see the rocket tubes.\"    \"How do you know so much?\"    Slim was flushed. He said, \"I read about them. My father has books about  them. Old books. From Beforethewars.\"    \"Huh. Now I know you're making it up. Books from Beforethewars!\"    \"My father _has_ to have them. He teaches at the University. It's his  job.\"    His voice had risen and Red had to pull at him. \"You want them to hear  us?\" he whispered indignantly.    \"Well, it is, too, a space-ship.\"    \"Look here, Slim, you mean that's a ship from another world.\"    \"It's _got_ to be. Look at my father going round and round it. He  wouldn't be so interested if it was anything else.\"    \"Other worlds! Where are there other worlds?\"    \"Everywhere. How about the planets? They're worlds just like ours, some  of them. And other stars probably have planets. There's probably  zillions of planets.\"    Red felt outweighed and outnumbered. He muttered, \"You're crazy!\"    \"All right, then. I'll show you.\"    \"Hey! Where are you going?\"    \"Down there. I'm going to ask my father. I suppose you'll believe it if  _he_ tells you. I suppose you'll believe a Professor of Astronomy knows  what--\"    He had scrambled upright.    Red said, \"Hey. You don't want them to see us. We're not supposed to be  here. Do you want them to start asking questions and find out about our  animals?\"    \"I don't care. You said I was crazy.\"    \"Snitcher! You promised you wouldn't tell.\"    \"I'm _not_ going to tell. But if they find out themselves, it's your  fault, for starting an argument and saying I was crazy.\"    \"I take it back, then,\" grumbled Red.    \"Well, all right. You better.\"    In a way, Slim was disappointed. He wanted to see the space-ship at  closer quarters. Still, he could not break his vow of secrecy even in  spirit without at least the excuse of personal insult.    Red said, \"It's awfully small for a space-ship.\"    \"Sure, because it's probably a scout-ship.\"    \"I'll bet Dad couldn't even get into the old thing.\"    So much Slim realized to be true. It was a weak point in his argument  and he made no answer. His interest was absorbed by the adults.    Red rose to his feet; an elaborate attitude of boredom all about him.  \"Well, I guess we better be going. There's business to do and I can't  spend all day here looking at some old space-ship or whatever it is.  We've got to take care of the animals if we're going to be circus-folks.  That's the first rule with circus-folks. They've got to take care of the  animals. And,\" he finished virtuously, \"that's what I aim to do,  anyway.\"    Slim said, \"What for, Red? They've got plenty of meat. Let's watch.\"    \"There's no fun in watching. Besides Dad and your father are going away  and I guess it's about lunch time.\"    Red became argumentative. \"Look, Slim, we can't start acting suspicious  or they're going to start investigating. Holy Smokes, don't you ever  read any detective stories? When you're trying to work a big deal  without being caught, it's practically the main thing to keep on acting  just like always. Then they don't suspect anything. That's the first  law--\"    \"Oh, all right.\"    Slim rose resentfully. At the moment, the circus appeared to him a  rather tawdry and shoddy substitute for the glories of astronomy, and he  wondered how he had come to fall in with Red's silly scheme.    Down the slope they went, Slim, as usual, in the rear.      VII    The Industrialist said, \"It's the workmanship that gets me. I never saw  such construction.\"    \"What good is it now?\" said the Astronomer, bitterly. \"There's nothing  left. There'll be no second landing. This ship detected life on our  planet through accident. Other exploring parties would come no closer  than necessary to establish the fact that there were no super-dense  worlds existing in our solar system.\"    \"Well, there's no quarreling with a crash landing.\"    \"The ship hardly seems damaged. If only some had survived, the ship  might have been"]]]
