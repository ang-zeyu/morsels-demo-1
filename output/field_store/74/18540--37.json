Afterwards the following  lotion may be applied to the wounds several times a day: Permanganate of  potassium, half a dram; distilled water, 1 pint. As snake bites are usually  attended with considerable depression, which may terminate in stupor, it is  advisable to give a stimulant. One ounce of aromatic spirits of ammonia  mixed with a pint of water should be given, and the dose should be repeated  in half an hour if the animal is sinking into a stupefied and unconscious  condition. The repetition of the dose must depend on the symptoms which the  animal shows. It must be borne in mind that the object of treatment is to  ward off the stupor, which is one of the results of snake bite. The  swelling from an insect bite should be bathed with ammonia water as soon as  noticed and then treated with frequent applications of hot water.      SALIVATION.    Salivation is a symptom of some general or local disorder. It may be a  symptom of a general disease, such as rabies or foot-and-mouth disease, or  it may be a purely local trouble, as when copious secretion of the salivary  glands is produced by the eating of irritating plants, such as wild  mustard. When saliva is observed to dribble from the mouth, that part  should be carefully examined by introducing into the mouth an instrument  like a balling iron, or, if one is not at hand, by grasping the tongue and  partially withdrawing it from the mouth, and by placing a block of wood  between the back teeth, while all parts of the mouth are exposed to a good  light, so that the presence of any foreign substance may be detected. The  cause is sometimes found to be a short piece of wood becoming fixed on the  palate, its two ends resting on the upper molar teeth of each side; or it  may be a needle, thorn, or splinter of wood embedded in the tongue.  Sometimes a sharp piece of tin or other metal may become partially embedded  in the inner surface of the cheek. Hay occasionally possesses some quality,  usually dependent upon its having heated in the mow or having become moldy,  which produces salivation. Second-crop clover and some irritant weeds in  the pasture or forage may cause salivation. Cattle rubbed with mercurial  ointment may swallow enough mercury in licking themselves to bring about  the same result. (See \"Mercury poisoning,\" p. 57.) Such cases, of course,  arise from the constitutional action of mercury, and, on account of the  common habit which the animals have of licking themselves, indicate the  danger of using such preparation externally. Mercury is also readily  absorbed through the skin, and as cattle are very susceptible to its action  it is thus easy for them to be poisoned by it even without licking it from  the surface. Cases of mercurial poisoning sometimes follow disinfection of  cattle stables with the usual 1 to 1,000 solution of mercuric chlorid.    _Treatment._--If salivation depends on the irritation and inflammation set  up by the ingestion of acrid plants, or forage possessing some peculiar  stimulating property, the feed must be changed, and a lotion composed of an  ounce of powdered alum dissolved in a quart of water may be syringed into  the mouth twice a day, using half a pint of the solution each time. If,  however, the salivation is due to the presence of a thorn, splinter of  wood, or any other foreign substance embedded in the cheek or tongue, the  offending object should be removed and the mouth washed occasionally with a  weak solution (2 per cent) of carbolic acid and tepid water. When  salivation is produced by mercurial poisoning or by foot-and-mouth disease,  the treatment appropriate to those general conditions of the system, as  well as the local treatment should be applied. (For information about  foot-and-mouth disease see p. 383.)      IRREGULARITIES OF THE TEETH.    Irregularities of the teeth may be occasioned by the unequal wearing of  some of the teeth or by some of the incisors being broken, which may happen  when cattle are pastured on sandy or gravelly soil. The molar teeth may  also show irregular wear from similar causes, or from a disease or  malformation of the jaw. Their edges may become sharp, or it may happen  that a molar tooth has been accidentally fractured. It may also occur that  a supernumerary tooth has developed in an unusual position, and that it  interferes with the natural and regular mastication of the feed.    _Treatment._--The mouth may be examined by grasping the animal's tongue  with one hand and partially withdrawing it from the mouth, so as to expose  the incisor and molar teeth to inspection. When it is desired, however, to  examine the molar teeth with the fingers, so as to obtain a better idea of  their condition, an instrument like the balling iron which is used for the  horse should be introduced into the mouth, so as to separate the jaws and  keep them apart while the examination is being made. Any sharp edges of the  molars must be removed by the tooth rasp, such as is used for horses. Any  supernumerary tooth which interferes with mastication or any tooth which is  fractured or loose should be extracted. In performing such operations it is  desirable to throw, or cast, the animal, and to have its head held  securely, so as to enable the operator to do what is necessary without  difficulty.      CARIES OR DECAY OF THE TEETH.    The presence of caries may be suspected if the mouth exhales a bad odor and  if the animal during mastication occasionally stops as if it were in pain.  The existence of caries in a molar tooth may be ascertained by examining  the mouth in the manner already described. If one of the molars is found to  be carious, it should be extracted. When the crown of the tooth has been  destroyed and only the stump or root is left, extraction is impracticable.  In case the animal has special value the root stumps may be removed by a  veterinarian by the operation of trephining; otherwise, it is best to sell  the animal to the butcher.      ACTINOMYCOSIS OF THE JAWBONES (BIG JAW OR LUMPY JAW).    [See Actinomycosis, p. 440.]      INFLAMMATION OF MUCOUS MEMBRANE OF MOUTH (STOMATITIS).    The membrane of the mouth may become inflamed by eating some irritating  substance or plant, or little vesicles may form in the mouths of calves  when they are affected with indigestion, constituting what is termed  aphtha.    _Symptoms._--The saliva dribbles from the mouth, and when the mouth is  examined the surface of the tongue and other parts appear red and inflamed.  When young animals are affected with the form of disease termed aphtha,  small red elevations are observed on the tongue and other parts of the  mouth, having little white points on their centers, which consist of the  epithelium of the mucous membrane raised into vesicles. These white patches  are succeeded by ulcerated surfaces, which are caused by the shedding of  the white patches of epithelium.    _Treatment._--When there is merely a reddened and inflamed condition of the  mucous membrane of the mouth, it will suffice to syringe it out several  times a day with 4 ounces of the following solution: Alum, 1 ounce; water,  2 pints. When the edges of the tongue and other parts of the mouth are  studded with ulcers, they should be painted over once a day with the  following solution until the affected surface is healed: Permanganate of  potassium, 20 grains; water, 1 ounce. When indigestion is associated with  an ulcerated condition of the mouth, separate treatment is required.      ULCERATIVE STOMATITIS (OR ULCERS IN THE MOUTHS OF YOUNG CALVES).

[See Actinomycosis, p. 440.]      DISEASES OF THE PHARYNX AND GULLET.      PHARYNGITIS (SORE THROAT).    Pharyngitis is an inflammation of the mucous membrane lining the pharynx.  It is frequently associated with inflammatory diseases of the respiratory  tract, such as laryngitis and bronchitis or pleurisy.    _Symptoms._--The muzzle is dry and the saliva dribbles from the corners of  the mouth; the animal swallows with difficulty or not at all, and holds its  neck in a stiff, straight position, moving it as little as possible. The  eyelids are half closed, the white of the eye is bloodshot, and the animal  occasionally grinds its teeth. After masticating the feed the animal drops  it out of its mouth as if to avoid the pain of swallowing, and also evinces  pain when pressure is applied externally on the pharynx and tries to  prevent the pressure from being applied.    _Causes._--Pharyngitis may be produced by a sudden cooling of the surface  of the body, as when cattle are exposed to a cold wind or a cold rain; or  by swallowing irritant substances.    _Treatment._--The throat should be syringed three times a day with an ounce  of the following solution: Nitrate of silver, 1-1/2 drams; distilled water,  1 pint. Bland and soothing drinks, such as linseed tea or oatmeal and water  should occasionally be offered. Diet should consist of soft food, such as  bran mashes with a little linseed meal mixed in them. Dry hay and fodder  should not be given. Fresh, green grass or sound ensilage may be fed in  small quantities. The upper part of the throat and the space between the  jaws should be well rubbed once a day with the following liniment: Liquor  ammonia fortior, 4 ounces; oil of turpentine, 4 ounces; olive oil, 4  ounces; mix. When evidence of blistering appears the application of the  liniment should be stopped and the skin anointed with vaseline. Under the  treatment described above the inflammation of the throat will gradually  subside and the animal will be able to swallow as usual in five or six  days. We need hardly say that during its treatment the sick animal should  be kept in a comfortable stable.      PAROTITIS.

They had; as well, to rely upon the  outside world for a great part of their manufactured goods, especially  for those of the higher grade. In other words, from the economic point  of view, the United States remained in the former colonial stage of  industrial dependence, which was aggravated rather than alleviated by  the separation from Great Britain. During the colonial period, Americans  had carried on a large amount of this external trade by means of their  own vessels. The British Navigation Acts required the transportation  of goods in British vessels, manned by crews of British sailors, and  specified certain commodities which could be shipped to Great Britain  only. They also required that much of the European trade should pass by  way of England. But colonial vessels and colonial sailors came under  the designation of \"British,\" and no small part of the prosperity of  New England, and of the middle colonies as well, had been due to the  carrying trade. It would seem therefore as if a primary need of the  American people immediately after the Revolution was to get access to  their old markets and to carry the goods as much as possible in their  own vessels.    In some directions they were successful. One of the products in greatest  demand was fish. The fishing industry had been almost annihilated by the  war, but with the establishment of peace the New England fisheries began  to recover. They were in competition with the fishermen of France and  England who were aided by large bounties, yet the superior geographical  advantages which the American fishermen possessed enabled them to  maintain and expand their business, and the rehabilitation of the  fishing fleet was an important feature of their programme. In other  directions they were not so successful. The British still believed in  their colonial system and applied its principles without regard to the  interests of the United States. Such American products as they wanted  they allowed to be carried to British markets, but in British vessels.  Certain commodities, the production of which they wished to encourage  within their own dominions, they added to the prohibited list. Americans  cried out indignantly that this was an attempt on the part of the  British to punish their former colonies for their temerity in revolting.  The British Government may well have derived some satisfaction from the  fact that certain restrictions bore heavily upon New England, as John  Adams complained; but it would seem to be much nearer the truth to  say that in a truly characteristic way the British were phlegmatically  attending to their own interests and calmly ignoring the United States,  and that there was little malice in their policy.    European nations had regarded American trade as a profitable field  of enterprise and as probably responsible for much of Great Britain's  prosperity. It was therefore a relatively easy matter for the United  States to enter into commercial treaties with foreign countries. These  treaties, however, were not fruitful of any great result; for, \"with  unimportant exceptions, they left still in force the high import duties  and prohibitions that marked the European tariffs of the time, as well  as many features of the old colonial system. They were designed to  legalize commerce rather than to encourage it.\"* Still, for a year or  more after the war the demand for American products was great enough  to satisfy almost everybody. But in 1784 France and Spain closed their  colonial ports and thus excluded the shipping of the United States. This  proved to be so disastrous for their colonies that the French Government  soon was forced to relax its restrictions. The British also made some  concessions, and where their orders were not modified they were evaded.  And so, in the course of a few years, the West India trade recovered.           * Clive Day, \"Encyclopedia of American Government,\" Vol. I,       p. 340.      More astonishing to the men of that time than it is to us was the fact  that American foreign trade fell under British commercial control again.  Whether it was that British merchants were accustomed to American ways  of doing things and knew American business conditions; whether other  countries found the commerce not as profitable as they had expected, as  certainly was the case with France; whether \"American merchants and  sea captains found themselves under disadvantages due to the absence  of treaty protection which they had enjoyed as English subjects\";* or  whether it was the necessity of trading on British capital--whatever the  cause may have been--within a comparatively few years a large part  of American trade was in British hands as it had been before the  Revolution. American trade with Europe was carried on through English  merchants very much as the Navigation Acts had prescribed.           * C. R. Fish, \"American Diplomacy,\" pp. 56-57.      From the very first settlement of the American continent the colonists  had exhibited one of the earliest and most lasting characteristics  of the American people adaptability. The Americans now proceeded to  manifest that trait anew, not only by adjusting themselves to renewed  commercial dependence upon Great Britain, but by seeking new avenues of  trade. A striking illustration of this is to be found in the development  of trade with the Far East. Captain Cook's voyage around the world  (1768-1771), an account of which was first published in London in 1773,  attracted a great deal of attention in America; an edition of the New  Voyage was issued in New York in 1774. No sooner was the Revolution over  than there began that romantic trade with China and the northwest coast  of America, which made the fortunes of some families of Salem and Boston  and Philadelphia. This commerce added to the prosperity of the country,  but above all it stimulated the imagination of Americans. In the same  way another outlet was found in trade with Russia by way of the Baltic.    The foreign trade of the United States after the Revolution thus passed  through certain well-marked phases. First there was a short period of  prosperity, owing to an unusual demand for American products; this  was followed by a longer period of depression; and then came a gradual  recovery through acceptance of the new conditions and adjustment to  them.    A similar cycle may be traced in the domestic or internal trade. In  early days intercolonial commerce had been carried on mostly by water,  and when war interfered commerce almost ceased for want of roads. The  loss of ocean highways, however, stimulated road building and led to  what might be regarded as the first \"good-roads movement\" of the new  nation, except that to our eyes it would be a misuse of the word to call  any of those roads good. But anything which would improve the means of  transportation took on a patriotic tinge, and the building of roads and  the cutting of canals were agitated until turnpike and canal companies  became a favorite form of investment; and in a few years the interstate  land trade had grown to considerable importance. But in the meantime,  water transportation was the main reliance, and with the end of the war  the coastwise trade had been promptly resumed. For a time it prospered;  but the States, affected by the general economic conditions and by  jealousy, tried to interfere with and divert the trade of others to  their own advantage. This was done by imposing fees and charges and  duties, not merely upon goods and vessels from abroad but upon those of  their fellow States. James Madison described the situation in the words  so often quoted: \"Some of the States,... having no convenient ports  for foreign commerce, were subject to be taxed by their neighbors, thro  whose ports, their commerce was carryed on. New Jersey, placed between  Phila. & N. York, was likened to a Cask tapped at both ends: and N.  Carolina between Virga. & S. Carolina to a patient bleeding at both  Arms.\"*           * \"Records of the Federal Convention,\" vol. III, p. 542.      The business depression which very naturally followed the short revival  of trade was so serious in its financial consequences that it has even  been referred to as the \"Panic of 1785.\" The United States afforded  a good market for imported articles in 1788 and 1784, all the better  because of the supply of gold and silver which had been sent into the  country by England and France to maintain their armies and fleets and  which had remained in the United States. But this influx of imported  goods was one of the chief factors in causing the depression of 1785, as  it brought ruin to many of those domestic industries which had sprung  up in the days of nonintercourse or which had been stimulated by the  artificial protection of the war.    To make matters worse, the currency was in a confused condition. \"In  1784 the entire coin of the land, except coppers, was the product of  foreign mints. English guineas, crowns, shillings and pence were still  paid over the counters of shops and taverns, and with them were mingled  many French and Spanish and some German coins.... The value of the gold  pieces expressed in dollars was pretty much the same the country over.  But the dollar and the silver pieces regarded as fractions of a dollar  had no less than five different values.\"* The importation of foreign  goods was fast draining the hard money out of the country. In an effort  to relieve the situation but with the result of making it much worse,  several of the States began to issue paper money; and this was in  addition to the enormous quantities of paper which had been printed  during the Revolution and which was now worth but a small fraction of  its face value.           * McMaster, \"History of the People of the United States\",       vol. I, pp. 190-191.      The expanding currency and consequent depreciation in the value of money  had immediately resulted in"]]]
