This tissue also  forms _ten'dons_, (white cords,) by which the muscles are attached  to the bones.    _Observation._ In the disease called rheumatism, the fibrous tissue is  the part principally affected; hence the joints, where this tissue is  most abundant, suffer most from this affection.      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    34. Describe the dermoid tissue. What is said of the sympathy between  the functions of the skin and mucous membrane? Give another instance  of the sympathy between these membranes. 35. Of what does the fibrous  tissue consist? How do these appear in some situations? How in others?  What tissue is generally affected in rheumatism?      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    36. The ADIPOSE TISSUE is so arranged as to form distinct bags, or  cells. These contain a substance called _fat_. This tissue is  principally found beneath the skin, abdominal muscles, and around the  heart and kidneys; while none is found in the brain, eye, ear, nose,  and several other organs.    _Observation._ In those individuals who are corpulent, there is in  many instances, a great deposit of this substance. This tissue  accumulates more readily than others when a person becomes gross, and  is earliest removed when the system emaciates, in acute or chronic  diseases. Some of the masses become, in some instances, enlarged.  These enlargements are called _adipose_, or _fatty tumors_.    [Illustration: Fig. 4. 1, A portion of the adipose tissue. 2, 2, 2,  Minute bags containing fat. 3, A cluster of these bags, separated and  suspended.]    37. The CARTILAGINOUS TISSUE is firm, smooth, and highly elastic.  Except bone, it is the hardest part of the animal frame. It tips the  ends of the bones that concur in forming a joint. Its use is to  facilitate the motion of the joints by its smooth surface, while its  elastic character diminishes the shock that would otherwise be  experienced if this tissue were inelastic.      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    36. Describe the adipose tissue. Where does this tissue principally  exist? Give observation in regard to the adipose tissue. 37. Describe  the cartilaginous tissue. What is its use?      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    38 The OSSEOUS TISSUE, in composition and arrangement of matter,  varies at different periods of life, and in different bones. In some  instances, the bony matter is disposed in plates, while in other  instances, the arrangement is cylindrical. Sometimes, the bony matter  is dense and compact; again, it is spongy, or porous. In the centre of  the long bones, a space is left which is filled with a fatty  substance, called _mar'row_.    _Observation._ Various opinions exist among physiologists in regard to  the use of marrow. Some suppose it serves as a reservoir of  nourishment, while others, that it keeps the bones from becoming dry  and brittle. The latter opinion, however, has been called in question,  as the bones of the aged man contain more marrow than those of the  child, and they are likewise more brittle.    [Illustration: Fig. 5. A section of the femur, (thigh-bone.) 1, 1, The  extremities, showing a thin plate of compact texture, which covers small  cells, that diminish in size, but increase in number, as they approach  the articulation. 2, 2, The walls of the shaft, which are very firm and  solid. 3, The cavity that contains the marrow.]    39. The MUSCULAR TISSUE is composed of many fibres, that unite to form  fasciculi, each of which is enclosed in a delicate layer of cellular  tissue. Bundles of these fasciculi constitute a muscle.    _Observation._ A piece of boiled beef will clearly illustrate the  arrangement of muscular fibre.      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    38. What is said of the osseous tissue? How is the bony matter  arranged in different parts of the animal frame? What is said of the  use of marrow? 39. Of what is the muscular tissue composed? How may  the arrangement of muscular fibre be illustrated?      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    40. The MUCOUS TISSUE differs from the serous by its lining all  the cavities which communicate with the air. The nostrils, the  mouth, and the stomach afford examples. The external surface of this  membrane, or that which is exposed to the air, is soft, and bears some  resemblance to the downy rind of a peach. It is covered by a viscid  fluid called _mu'cus_. This is secreted by small _gland-cells_,  called _ep-i-the'li-a_, or secretory cells of the mucous membrane.  The use of this membrane and its secreted mucus is to protect the  inner surface of the cavities which it lines.    _Observation._ A remarkable sympathy exists between the remote parts  of the mucous membrane. Thus the condition of the stomach may be  ascertained by an examination of the tongue.    41. The NERVOUS TISSUE consists of soft, pulpy matter, enclosed in  a sheath, called _neu-ri-lem'a_. This tissue consists of two  substances. The one, of a pulpy character and gray color, is called  _cin-e-ri'tious_, (ash-colored.) The other, of a fibrous character and  white, is named _med'ul-la-ry_, (marrow-like.) In every part of the  nervous system both substances are united, with the exception of the  nervous fibres and filaments, which are solely composed of the  medullary matter enclosed in a delicate sheath.      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    40. How does the mucous differ from the serous tissue? What is the  appearance of the external surface of this membrane? Where is the  mucus secreted? What is the use of this membrane? 41. Of what does the  nervous tissue consist? Describe the two substances that enter into  the composition of the nervous tissue.      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=          CHAPTER III    CHEMISTRY OF THE HUMAN BODY.      42. An ULTIMATE ELEMENT is the simplest form of matter with which we  are acquainted; as gold, iron, &c.    43. These elements are divided into _metallic_ and _non-metallic_  substances. The metallic substances are _Po-tas'si-um_, _So'di-um_,  _Cal'ci-um_, _Mag-ne'si-um_, _A-lu'min-um_, _I'ron_, _Man'ga-nese_, and  _Cop'per_. The non-metallic substances are _Ox'y-gen_, _Hy'dro-gen_,  _Car'bon_, _Ni'tro-gen_, _Si-li'-ci-um_, _Phos'phor-us_, _Sul'phur_,  _Chlo'rine_, and a few others.    44. POTASH (potassium united with oxygen) is found in the blood, bile,  perspiration, milk, &c.    45. SODA (sodium combined with oxygen) exists in the muscles, and in  the same fluids in which potash is found.    46. LIME (calcium combined with oxygen) forms the principal ingredient  of the bones. The lime in them is combined with phosphoric and  carbonic acid.    47. MAGNESIA (magnesium combined with oxygen) exists in the bones,  brain, and in some of the animal fluids; as milk.    48. SILEX (silicium combined with oxygen) is contained in the hair and  in some of the secretions.    49. IRON forms the coloring principle of the red globules of the  blood, and is found in every part of the system.    _Observation._ As metallic or mineral substances enter into the  ultimate elements of the body, the assertion that all minerals are  poisonous, however small the quantity, is untrue.      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    42. What is an ultimate element? Give examples. 43. How are they  divided? Name the metallic substances. Name the non-metallic  substances. 44. What is said of potash? 45. Of soda? 46. Of lime? 47.  Of magnesia? 48. Of silex? 49. What forms the coloring principle of  the blood? What is said of mineral substances?      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    50. OXYGEN is contained in all the fluids and solids of the body. It  is almost entirely derived from the inspired air and water. It is  expelled in the form of carbonic acid and water from the lungs and  skin. It is likewise removed in the other secretions.    51. HYDROGEN is found in all the fluids and in all the solids of  the body. It is derived from the food, as well as from water and  other drinks. It exists in the greatest abundance in the impure,  dark-colored blood of the system. It is removed by the agency of the  kidneys, skin, lungs, and other excretory organs.    52. CARBON is an element in the oil, fat, albumen, fibrin, gelatin,  bile, and mucus. This element likewise exists in the impure blood in  the form of carbonic acid gas. Carbon is obtained from the food, and  discharged from the system by the secretions and respiration.    53. NITROGEN is contained in most animal matter, but is most abundant  in fibrin. It is not contained in fat and a few other substances.    _Observation._ The peculiar smell of animal matter when burning is  owing to nitrogen. This element combined with hydrogen forms  _am-mo'ni-a_, (hartshorn,) when animal matter is in a state of  putrefaction.    54. PHOSPHORUS is contained in many parts of the system, but more  particularly in the bones. It is generally found in combination with  oxygen, forming _phosphoric acid_. The phosphoric acid is usually  combined with alkaline bases; as lime in the bones, forming phosphate  of lime.    55. SULPHUR exists in the bones, muscles, hair, and nails. It is  expelled from the system by the skin and intestines.    56. CHLORINE is found in the blood, gastric juice, milk, perspiration,  and saliva.      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    50. What is said of oxygen? 51. Of hydrogen? 52. What is said of  carbon? 53. Of nitrogen? How is ammonia formed? 54. What is said of  phosphorus? 55. What is said of sulphur? 56. Of chlorine?      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    57. PROXIMATE ELEMENTS are forms of matter that exist in organized  bodies in abundance, and are composed chiefly of oxygen, hydrogen,  carbon, and nitrogen, arranged in different proportions. They exist  already formed, and may be separated in many instances, by heat or  mechanical means. The most important compounds are _Al-bu'men_,  _Fi'brin_, _Gel'a-tin_, _Mu'cus_, _Fat_, _Ca'se-ine_, _Chon'drine_,  _Lac'tic acid_, and _Os'ma-zome_.    58. ALBUMEN is found in the body, both in a fluid and solid form. It  is an element of the skin, glands,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3055"],[0,"The Wood Beyond the World (#4)"],[1,"this lonely land.  Sooth to say, to me  they are not masterful or rough-handed; but glad am I that they have been  here but of late, and are not like to come again this while; for terrible  they are of aspect, and whereas ye be aliens, belike they would not hold  their hands from off you; and moreover ye have weapons and other matters  which they would covet sorely.\"    Quoth the master: \"Since thou dealest with these wild men, will ye not  deal with us in chaffer?  For whereas we are come from long travel, we  hanker after fresh victual, and here aboard are many things which were  for thine avail.\"    Said the old man: \"All that I have is yours, so that ye do but leave me  enough till my next ingathering: of wine and cyder, such as it is, I have  plenty for your service; ye may drink it till it is all gone, if ye will:  a little corn and meal I have, but not much; yet are ye welcome thereto,  since the standing corn in my garth is done blossoming, and I have other  meat.  Cheeses have I and dried fish; take what ye will thereof.  But as  to my neat and sheep, if ye have sore need of any, and will have them, I  may not say you nay: but I pray you if ye may do without them, not to  take my milch-beasts or their engenderers; for, as ye have heard me say,  the Bear-folk have been here but of late, and they have had of me all I  might spare: but now let me tell you, if ye long after flesh-meat, that  there is venison of hart and hind, yea, and of buck and doe, to be had on  this plain, and about the little woods at the feet of the rock-wall  yonder: neither are they exceeding wild; for since I may not take them, I  scare them not, and no other man do they see to hurt them; for the Bear-  folk come straight to my house, and fare straight home thence.  But I  will lead you the nighest way to where the venison is easiest to be  gotten.  As to the wares in your ship, if ye will give me aught I will  take it with a good will; and chiefly if ye have a fair knife or two and  a roll of linen cloth, that were a good refreshment to me.  But in any  case what I have to give is free to you and welcome.\"    The shipmaster laughed: \"Friend,\" said he, \"we can thee mickle thanks for  all that thou biddest us.  And wot well that we be no lifters or  sea-thieves to take thy livelihood from thee.  So to-morrow, if thou  wilt, we will go with thee and upraise the hunt, and meanwhile we will  come aland, and walk on the green grass, and water our ship with thy good  fresh water.\"    So the old carle went back to his house to make them ready what cheer he  might, and the shipmen, who were twenty and one, all told, what with the  mariners and Arnold and Walter's servants, went ashore, all but two who  watched the ship and abode their turn.  They went well-weaponed, for both  the master and Walter deemed wariness wisdom, lest all might not be so  good as it seemed.  They took of their sail-cloths ashore and tilted them  in on the meadow betwixt the house and the ship, and the carle brought  them what he had for their avail, of fresh fruits, and cheeses, and milk,  and wine, and cyder, and honey, and there they feasted nowise ill, and  were right fain.          CHAPTER VI: THE OLD MAN TELLS WALTER OF HIMSELF.  WALTER SEES A SHARD IN  THE CLIFF-WALL      But when they had done their meat and drink the master and the shipmen  went about the watering of the ship, and the others strayed off along the  meadow, so that presently Walter was left alone with the carle, and fell  to speech with him and said: \"Father, meseemeth thou shouldest have some  strange tale to tell, and as yet we have asked thee of nought save meat  for our bellies: now if I ask thee concerning thy life, and how thou  camest hither, and abided here, wilt thou tell me aught?\"    The old man smiled on him and said: \"Son, my tale were long to tell; and  mayhappen concerning much thereof my memory should fail me; and withal  there is grief therein, which I were loth to awaken: nevertheless if thou  ask, I will answer as I may, and in any case will tell thee nought save  the truth.\"    Said Walter: \"Well then, hast thou been long here?\"    \"Yea,\" said the carle, \"since I was a young man, and a stalwarth knight.\"    Said Walter: \"This house, didst thou build it, and raise these garths,  and plant orchard and vineyard, and gather together the neat and the  sheep, or did some other do all this for thee?\"    Said the carle: \"I did none of all this; there was one here before me,  and I entered into his inheritance, as though this were a lordly manor,  with a fair castle thereon, and all well stocked and plenished.\"    Said Walter: \"Didst thou find thy foregoer alive here?\"    \"Yea,\" said the elder, \"yet he lived but for a little while after I came  to him.\"    He was silent a while, and then he said: \"I slew him: even so would he  have it, though I bade him a better lot.\"    Said Walter: \"Didst thou come hither of thine own will?\"    \"Mayhappen,\" said the carle; \"who knoweth?  Now have I no will to do  either this or that.  It is wont that maketh me do, or refrain.\"    Said Walter: \"Tell me this; why didst thou slay the man? did he any  scathe to thee?\"    Said the elder: \"When I slew him, I deemed that he was doing me all  scathe: but now I know that it was not so.  Thus it was: I would needs go  where he had been before, and he stood in the path against me; and I  overthrew him, and went on the way I would.\"    \"What came thereof?\" said Walter.    \"Evil came of it,\" said the carle.    Then was Walter silent a while, and the old man spake nothing; but there  came a smile in his face that was both sly and somewhat sad.  Walter  looked on him and said: \"Was it from hence that thou wouldst go that  road?\"    \"Yea,\" said the carle.    Said Walter: \"And now wilt thou tell me what that road was; whither it  went and whereto it led, that thou must needs wend it, though thy first  stride were over a dead man?\"    \"I will not tell thee,\" said the carle.    Then they held their peace, both of them, and thereafter got on to other  talk of no import.    So wore the day till night came; and they slept safely, and on the morrow  after they had broken their fast, the more part of them set off with the  carle to the hunting, and they went, all of them, a three hours' faring  towards the foot of the cliffs, which was all grown over with coppice,  hazel and thorn, with here and there a big oak or ash-tree; there it was,  said the old man, where the venison was most and best.    Of their hunting need nought be said, saving that when the carle had put  them on the track of the deer and shown them what to do, he came back  again with Walter, who had no great lust for the hunting, and sorely  longed to have some more talk with the said carle.  He for his part  seemed nought loth thereto, and so led Walter to a mound or hillock  amidst the clear of the plain, whence all was to be seen save where the  wood covered it; but just before where they now lay down there was no  wood, save low bushes, betwixt them and the rock-wall; and Walter noted  that whereas otherwhere, save in one place whereto their eyes were  turned, the cliffs seemed wellnigh or quite sheer, or indeed in some  places beetling over, in that said place they fell away from each other  on either side; and before this sinking was a slope or scree, that went  gently up toward the sinking of the wall.  Walter looked long and  earnestly at this place, and spake nought, till the carle said: \"What!  thou hast found something before thee to look on.  What is it then?\"    Quoth Walter: \"Some would say that where yonder slopes run together up  towards that sinking in the cliff-wall there will be a pass into the  country beyond.\"    The carle smiled and said: \"Yea, son; nor, so saying, would they err; for  that is the pass into the Bear-country, whereby those huge men come down  to chaffer with me.\"    \"Yea,\" said Walter; and therewith he turned him a little, and scanned the  rock-wall, and saw how a few miles from that pass it turned somewhat  sharply toward the sea, narrowing the plain much there, till it made a  bight, the face whereof looked wellnigh north, instead of west, as did  the more part of the wall.  And in the midst of that northern-looking  bight was a dark place which seemed to Walter like a downright shard in  the cliff.  For the face of the wall was of a bleak grey, and it was but  little furrowed.    So then Walter spake: \"Lo, old friend, there yonder is again a place that  meseemeth is a pass; whereunto doth that one lead?\"  And he pointed to  it: but the old man did not follow the pointing of his finger, but,  looking down on the ground, answered confusedly, and said:    \"Maybe: I wot not.  I deem that it also leadeth into the Bear-country by  a roundabout road.  It leadeth into the far land.\"    Walter answered nought: for a strange thought had come uppermost in his  mind, that the carle knew far more than he would say of that pass, and  that he himself might be led thereby to find the wondrous three.  He  caught his breath hardly, and his heart knocked against his ribs; but he  refrained from speaking for a long while; but at last he spake in a sharp  hard voice, which he scarce knew for his own: \"Father, tell me, I adjure  thee by God and All-hallows, was it through yonder shard that the road  lay, when thou must needs make thy first stride over a dead man?\"    The old man spake not a while, then he raised his head, and looked Walter  full in the eyes, and said in a steady voice: \"NO, IT WAS NOT.\"  Thereafter they sat looking at each other a while; but at last Walter  turned his eyes away, but knew not what they beheld nor where he was, but  he was as one in a swoon.  For he knew full well that the carle had lied  to him, and that he might as well have said aye as no, and told him, that  it verily was by that same shard that he had stridden over a dead man.  Nevertheless he made as little semblance thereof as he might, and"]]]
