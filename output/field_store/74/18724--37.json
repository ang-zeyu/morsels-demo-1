Representatives of the tropical genera _Micronycteris_,       _Sturnira_, _Artibeus_, _Enchistenes_, _Desmodus_,       _Diphylla_, and _Molossus_ have their northern       distributional limits in this Province. The non-flying       mammals characteristic of the Province in Tamaulipas are:       _Philander opossum pallidus_; _Marmosa mexicana_; _Ateles       geoffroyi velerosus_; _Geomys tropicalis_; _Oryzomys       melanotis rostratus_; _O. alfaroi huastecae_; _O. fulvescens       engracie_ (endemic to this Province in Tamaulipas); _O. f.       fulvescens_; _Reithrodontomys mexicanus_; _Peromyscus       orchraventer_ (endemic); _Neotoma micropus angustapalata_;       _Eira barbara senex_; _Felis wiedii oaxacensis_; and _Mazama       americana temama_.          BARRIERS AND ROUTES OF MOVEMENT      The distributional patterns and affinities of the mammalian fauna of  Tamaulipas suggest possible routes of migration and barriers that  limited or controlled movements of the mammals.    Mammals may have reached Tamaulipas by way of a Northern route, a  Trans-plateau route, a Montane route, or a Tropical route (Fig 3).    The Northern route permitted species of mammals from the temperate  region to the north to enter the Tamaulipan Biotic Province from or via  Texas. Several came from the Great Plains, and a few came from the  eastern part of the United States. Also, a few mammals that may have  originated in the Tamaulipan Province moved northwards. Some of these,  according to Dice (1937:267) were _Liomys irroratus texensis_,  _Peromyscus leucopus texensis_, and _Lepus californicus merriami_.  Other mammals thought to have moved north by this route are _Didelphis  marsupialis_, _Dasypus novemcinctus_, _Oryzomys palustris_, _Nasua  narica_, and _Tayassu tajacu_. Some mammals that passed through  Tamaulipas into Texas have extended their geographic ranges far north  of Texas.    Mammals that came _via_ the Trans-plateau route (name proposed by  Baker, 1956:146) came no farther into Tamaulipas than the Chihuahuan  Biotic Province. They encountered the barrier formed by the Sierra  Madre Oriental. These mammals were listed in the account of the  Chihuahuan Biotic Province.    The route that Baker (1956:146) termed the \"Southern Route\" I here term  the Montane route because I think it was used for movement southward as  well as northward.    [Illustration: FIG. 3. Routes of movement: 1 Northern; 2 Trans-Plateau;  3 Montane; 4 Tropical.]    The Montane route was used by mammals of boreal affinities (_Microtus_  and _Neotoma_), that moved into Tamaulipas from the north; also in this  category are bats of the family Vespertilionidae. For movement from  south to north, the route was used by several species native to Mexico,  for example, _Cratogeomys castanops_. The seaward slope of the montane  area has enabled some tropical mammals to move farther north than they  have done at higher and lower elevations. _Philander opossum_ seems to  be an example.    The fourth route, the Tropical one, was used by mammals of tropical  origin. Most moved into Tamaulipas only as far as the Veracruzian  Biotic Province. The principal mammals that have used this route are  the bats and marsupials, but _Sylvilagus brasiliensis_, _Ateles  geoffroyi_, _Heterogeomys hispidus_, _Eira barbara_, and _Mazama  americana_ also can be included here. Some tropical mammals, as was  pointed out previously, not only reached Tamaulipas but have moved  through the state and far northward.    The major barriers to dispersal of mammals in Tamaulipas are three (see  Fig. 2). Two of them, the Rio Grande Barrier and the Sierra Madre  Barrier, are physiographical, but the Tropical Barrier is maintained by  a combination of environmental factors. The three barriers separate the  four Biotic Provinces in Tamaulipas. The Sierra Madre Oriental, which  forms the Potosian Biotic Province, lies between the Tamaulipan and  Chihuahuan provinces. The Tropical barrier separates the Tamaulipan and  Veracruzian biotic provinces.    The Rio Grande, as was pointed out by R. H. Baker (1956:146), has low  banks, is relatively shallow, and does not form an effective barrier  for most mammals. For only two species, insofar as I know, has the Rio  Grande constituted a barrier. _Cratogeomys castanops_ has not entered  southeastern Texas from Mexico, and _Spermophilus spilosoma_ has not  entered Mexico from southeastern Texas except on the coastal barrier  beach. Alvarez (1962:124) postulated that the beach was the route by  which _S. spilosoma_ arrived at La Pesca where the barrier beach meets  the mainland.    The Sierra Madre Barrier is a good filter for some small mammals,  especially for those that occur on the Mexican Plateau and those of  tropical origin. The mammals that occur on each side of the Sierra are  listed in accounts of the Chihuahuan (west side), Veracruzian and  Tamaulipan (east side) biotic provinces.    The Tropical Barrier is formed mainly by a climatic complex (probably a  change in temperature and rainfall) in the coastal region at or about  the latitude of Soto la Marina, where no geographic barrier is found.  In the western and central part of the Tropical Barrier, the climatic  factor is supported by a geographic factor. The Sierra Madre Oriental  is in the west and the Sierra de Tamaulipas is in the center. The  several mammals that are affected by this barrier are listed in the  accounts of the Veracruzian and Tamaulipan biotic provinces.    A peculiar pattern of distribution is that presented by _Scalopus  inflatus_ and _Geomys tropicalis_. Both are the only known species of  their genera in northeastern Mexico. Each is isolated from other  species of its genus. The nearest known record of _Scalopus_ is 45  miles northward and the nearest record of _Geomys_ is approximately 165  miles northward. A possible explanation for the distribution of these  two kinds is that each was widely distributed in one of the glacial  periods and when the glacier receded to the north these animals  remained in Tamaulipas, where they evolved and formed distinct species.  The two species, _G. tropicalis_ and _S. inflatus_, are fossorial and  for this reason probably were able to resist inhospitable climates  better than non-burrowing species.          HISTORY OF MAMMALOGY      In Tamaulipas the first exploration directed in substantial measure  toward finding out about the mammalian fauna, at least as far as I  know, was made by Dr. L. Berlandier, who traveled mainly in the  northern half of the state. His collections provided specimens of  several previously unknown mammals, which were described by Baird  (1858). The original manuscript of Berlandier never has been published.  About 1880 Dr. E. Palmer collected mammals in the southern part of  Tamaulipas, in the area around Tampico. The results of his exploration  were reported by J. A. Allen (1881). E. W. Nelson and E. A. Goldman  twice collected in Tamaulipas (Goldman, 1951). In 1898 they visited and  collected mammals in the southern part of the state, around Tampico,  Altamira, Victoria, Forlon, and Miquihuana. In 1901-1902 they visited  the area between Nuevo Laredo and Bagdad, then went south to Soto la  Marina and Victoria. From their collections several species and  subspecies have been described. Between 1910 and the early 1920's  little was done in the way of scientific exploration because of the  Mexican Revolution.    From 1930 on, several expeditions yielded new information about the  native mammals. In that year L. B. Kellum visited the Sierra San  Carlos. The results were reported by Dice (1937). Another important  collection from Tamaulipas was made by Marian Martin in the area of  Gomez Farias. Mammals collected by her were reported by Goodwin (1954).  Hooper (1953) also reported specimens from Gomez Farias but included in  his report records of mammals collected in other areas as well. In 1950  E. R. Hall and C. von Wedel made a trip to the barrier beach in the  northeastern part of the state and collected several kinds of mammals  among which three were described as new by Hall (1951).    The report here presented is based upon specimens in the Museum of  Natural History of The University of Kansas that were collected mainly  by the persons named beyond. Gerd H. Heinrich and his wife Hilda  collected in 1952 and 1953 in the areas around Miquihuana, Ciudad  Victoria, Soto la Marina, Sierra de Tamaulipas, and Altamira. W. J.  Schaldach collected in 1949 and 1950 in the Sierra Madre Oriental south  of Ciudad Victoria; he returned to Tamaulipas in 1954 in company with  V. Grissino and worked in the Sierra Madre Oriental south and north of  Ciudad Victoria. In 1961 P. L. Clifton and J. H. Bodley collected in  the northwestern part of the state and in the western part, around  Tula, Nicolas, and Tajada. Some students and staff members of the  Museum have occasionally collected in Tamaulipas.    As a result of all the mentioned expeditions and others, 32 species and  subspecies have been described with type localities in Tamaulipas.

The dam of a  small pond on the Reservation and low ground near the water were used by  _Microtus_ at all times. In the summer of 1949 no voles were taken  anywhere on the Reservation but their runways were more abundant around  the pond than in the other places examined. Of all the areas studied in  the summer of 1949, only the pond area had been protected from grazing  in previous years. _Polygonum coccineum_ was the most prominent plant in  the pond edge association. A few voles were trapped in large openings in  the woods, where a prairie vegetation remained and where voles seemingly  lived in nearly isolated groups.    Voles were rarely taken in grazed or mown grassland or in fields of  alfalfa, stubble or row crops. The critical factor in these cases seemed  to be the absence of debris or other ground cover under which runways  and nests could be concealed satisfactorily. Woods, rocky outcroppings  and bare ground were not used regularly by voles. Fitch (1953, _in  litt._) has taken several _Microtus_ in reptile traps set along a rocky  ledge in woods but most of these voles were subadult males and seemed to  be transients. Fields in the early stages of succession also failed to  support a population of voles. Such areas on the Reservation were  characterized by giant ragweed, horse weed, thistles and other coarse  weeds. Basal cover was low and debris scanty. Not until an understory of  grasses was established did a population of voles appear on such areas.  The coarse weeds seemed to provide neither food nor cover adequate for  the needs of the voles.    An analysis of trapping success at each station in House Field further  clarified habitat preferences. The tendency of voles to avoid woody  vegetation was again demonstrated. Not only was the population  concentrated on that part of the study plot farthest from the forest  edge but, as a general rule, voles tended to avoid single trees or  clumps of shrubby plants wherever these occurred on the area. As an  example, trap number 18 never caught more than one per cent of the  monthly catch and in many trapping periods caught nothing. This trap was  under a wild plum tree. Adjacent traps often were entered; the general  area was the most heavily populated part of the study plot. Only under  the plum tree was there a relatively unused portion.    Traps number 29 and 30, in the shade of a large honey locust tree, also  caught but few voles. Trap number 30 was only six feet from the base of  the tree and caught but one vole throughout the study period. These two  traps caught more _Peromyscus leucopus_ than any other pair, however,  and both of them also caught pine voles (_M. pinetorum_). The area  shaded by this tree permitted an extension of parts of the forest edge  fauna into the grassland.    In spite of the marked general tendency to avoid woody plants, some  voles made their runways around the roots of blackberry bushes, sumac  and wild plum trees. Some nests were found under larger roots, as if  placed there for protection. More vegetation was found under the woody  plants which the voles chose to use for shelter than under those which  they avoided. It seemed probable that the actual condition avoided by  voles was the bareness of the ground (a result of the shade cast by the  woody plants) rather than the woody plants themselves.    Running diagonally across the eastern half of the trapping plot in House  Field there was a terracelike ridge of soil. On each side of this ridge  there was a slight depression. Observations of the study plot in the  growing season showed this strip to produce the most luxuriant  vegetation of any part of the plot. Clip-quadrat studies confirmed this  observation and showed the bluegrass understory to be especially heavy.  This strip included the areas trapped by traps numbered 4, 5, 17, 18,  22, 23 and 37. With the exception of trap number 18, discussed above,  these traps consistently made more captures than traps set in other  parts of the plot. In winter, these traps also caught more harvest mice  (_Reithrodontomys megalotis_) than any other comparable group of traps.    Although the amount of growing tissue of plants probably is at least as  important to voles as the total amount of vegetation, some correlation  seemed to exist between the density of grassy vegetation and the density  of populations of voles. A mixed stand of grasses, with an obvious weedy  component, can support a larger population of voles than can either a  nearly pure stand of grass or the typical early seral stages dominated  by weeds. Probably the more or less continual supply of young plants  provided preferred food easily available to voles. A more homogeneous  vegetation would tend to pass through the young and tender stage as a  unit, thus causing a feast to be followed by a relative famine.          POPULATION STRUCTURE      During the period of study the percentage of males in most of my samples  was less than 50 per cent (Fig. 2). Only once, in June, 1952, did the  mean percentage of males in samples from three areas (House Field,  Quarry Field, Fitch traps) exceed that level and then it was only 50.1  per cent. On several occasions, however, the percentage of males in a  sample from a single area was slightly above 50 per cent. The highest  percentage of males recorded was 56.69 per cent, in a sample taken from  the Quarry Field population in June, 1952. In the samples taken in  April, 1952, the mean percentage of males was 39.67 per cent, the lowest  mean recorded. The low point for one sample was 28.02 per cent in  August, 1952, from Quarry Field. The mean percentage of males in all  samples taken was 45.02 +- 2.72 per cent. Percentages observed would  occur in random samples taken from a population with 50 per cent males  less than one per cent of the time. Exactly 50 per cent of the young in  the 65 litters examined were classified as males but the sample was  small and the sexing of newborn individuals was difficult.    [Illustration: FIG. 2. Graphs of population structure showing the  monthly changes in the mean percentages of juveniles, subadults, adults  and males in samples from the three study areas.]    The extent to which sex ratios in samples were affected by trapping  procedure was not determined. A possibility considered was that the  greater wandering tendency of males (Blair, 1940:154; Hamilton,  1937c:261; Townsend, 1935:98) impaired the formation of trap habits  (Chitty and Kempson, 1949:536) on their part and thus unbalanced the sex  ratios of the samples. If this were the explanation, the apparent sex  ratio on larger areas would more nearly approximate the true ratio, and  the frequency of capture of females would exceed that of males. The  evidence is somewhat equivocal. In the populations described here the  mean number of captures per individual per month was 2.31 for females,  which was significantly greater (at the one per cent level) than the  2.20 captures per individual per month which was the mean number for  males. This difference supports the idea that differences in habits  between the sexes result in distorted sex ratios in samples obtained by  live-trapping. Mean percentages of males did not, however, differ  significantly between the House Field-Quarry Field samples and the  samples from the Fitch trapping area, nearly five times as large.    Three age classes, juvenal, subadult and adult, were separated on the  basis of condition of pelage. The percentage of adults in populations  varied seasonally (Fig. 2). January, February and March were the months  when the adult fraction of the population was highest and October and  November were low points, with May and June showing percentages almost  as low. The only marked variation in this seasonal pattern occurred in  July and August, 1952, when the percentage of adults rose sharply. This  was due to a depression in the reproductive rate during the dry summer  of 1952, which is discussed later in this report. Juveniles made up only  a small fraction of the population from December through March and a  relatively large fraction in the October-November and May-June periods  (Fig. 2). Again, July and August of 1952 were exceptions to the pattern  as the percentages of juveniles in these months fell to midwinter  levels. As expected, the curve of the percentages of subadults in the  population followed that of the juveniles and preceded that of the  adults. The mean percentages for the thirty month period for which data  were available were: adults, 77.72 +- 4.48 per cent; subadults, 14.06 +-  3.14 per cent; and juveniles, 8.22 +- 2.62 per cent. Seasonal and yearly  changes in the population structure occurred, with notable variation in  the ratio of breeding females to the entire population, as discussed in  this report under the heading of reproduction.    Since some of the juveniles did not move enough to be readily trapped,  the real percentage of juveniles in the population was probably far  greater than that shown by trapping data. I tried, therefore, to  estimate the number of juveniles on the study plot each month by  multiplying the number of lactating females by the mean litter size. As  expected, the results were consistently higher than the estimate based  on trapping data. The discrepancy was largest in April, May, June and  October. During the winter there was no important difference between the  two estimates. Even when the discrepancy was greatest, the estimated  weight of the juveniles missed by trapping was not large enough to  modify the picture of habitat utilization in any important way. I chose,  therefore, to count only those juveniles actually trapped. Although  probably consistently too low, such a figure seemed more reliable than  an estimate made on any other basis.
