All of the higher butterflies go into the chrysalis state  without making a silken cocoon, while most of the higher moths make  such a cocoon. The bodies of the butterflies are usually slender,  while those of the larger moths are stout. The antennae of the  butterflies are generally slender and commonly enlarged at the tip  into a miniature club. The antennae of the larger moths are commonly  feathery or are long and slender, tapering gradually toward the tip.       [Illustration: Butterfly wing scales, magnified.       (From Holland)]    The characteristic features that distinguish a moth from a butterfly  are well illustrated in the plate opposite page 49, which shows one of  the largest and most beautiful moths in the world. It is the Cynthia  moth. As may be seen, the newly emerged moth is resting upon the  silken cocoon in which it spent its period as a pupa or chrysalis.  This cocoon was attached by the caterpillar to the twig from which it  hangs at the time it spun the cocoon. The feathered antennae, the  hairy legs, the thick thorax, and large abdomen--all show very clearly  in this side view of the moth. As will be seen, the wings are large  and very suggestive of those of a butterfly and have the  characteristic eye-spots toward the tip and the crescent marks in the  middle, which are so often found on the wings of the larger moths.    Some of these large moths on cloudy days occasionally fly during  daylight and, by the uninitiated, they are often mistaken for large  butterflies. One who will notice their structure, however, will  readily see the characteristic features of the moth.    In the caterpillar stage, there are no hard and fast differences  between the larvae of butterflies and those of the higher moths. In  each case, the insect consists of a worm-like body, having a small  head provided with biting jaws and simple eyes or ocelli. Back of the  head are the three rings of the thorax, each of which bears a pair of  jointed legs. Back of these three rings there are a considerable  number of other body rings making up the abdomen, on the middle of  which there are commonly four or five pairs of fleshy prolegs, not  jointed but furnished at the tip with fine claws. At the hind end of  the body there is another pair of prolegs similar in structure.          THE SCENTS OF BUTTERFLIES      Many students of American butterflies have occasionally mentioned the  fact that certain species seem to give off a distinct scent which has  frequently been spoken of as a pleasing fragrance, suggesting  sandalwood or some other aromatic odor. The general subject as  exemplified by butterflies of other lands has been studied for many  years by Fritz Mueller; and certain English entomologists have paid  considerable attention to it. A translation of the Mueller publications  and an excellent summary of our present knowledge of the subject is  published in Dr. Longstaff's book on butterfly hunting.    The odors given off by butterflies are divided into two principal  kinds, namely: first, those which are repulsive to the senses of man,  and evidently for the purpose of protecting the butterflies from birds  and other vertebrate enemies--these are found in both sexes; second,  those which are evidently for the purpose of sexual attraction and  confined to the male butterflies--these scents are usually attractive  to the senses of man.       [Illustration: Androconia from wings of male butterflies]    The aromatic scents of the second group are generally produced by  means of certain scales or hairs of many curious forms, which are  scattered over the surface of the wings or are placed within certain  special pockets, generally near the borders of the wings. These scales  or hairs are called androconia. Some of them much magnified are  represented in the picture above.    Our knowledge of the scents given off by American butterflies is very  fragmentary, and it is highly desirable that many more observations  should be made upon the subject. If collectors generally would make  careful notes, both in the field and upon the freshly killed  butterflies at home, we ought soon to be able greatly to extend our  knowledge. By holding the butterfly with a pair of forceps, one can  often determine whether the fragrance is emitted. It is often helpful  also to brush the hairs or tufts where the androconia are attached,  using a small, dry camel's hair brush for the purpose.          BUTTERFLY MIGRATIONS      Migration seems to be a general instinct in the animal world,  developed when a species becomes enormously abundant. At such times  this instinct apparently overcomes all others and the creatures move  on regardless of obstacles and conditions that may mean certain death  to the vast majority. Such migrations among mammals have often been  recorded, one of the most notable examples being that of the little  lemmings which migrate at periodical intervals in a way which has  often been described. Among the insects such migrations have been  frequently noticed, and the phenomenon has apparently been observed  oftener among the butterflies than in any other group. Entomological  literature during the last hundred years contains a great many records  of enormous flights of butterflies over long distances, extending even  from Africa into Europe or from one part of America to another far  remote. As such migration is likely to happen whenever a species  becomes extremely abundant it probably is Nature's way of providing  for an extended food supply for the succeeding generations. That it  results in the death of the great majority of the migrants is  doubtless true, but it must lead to vast experiments in extending the  geographic area inhabited by these species. Numerous examples of such  migrating swarms will be found in the pages of this little book. (_See  plates, pages 17,48-49, 160._)       [Illustration: _Photographed from life by A. H. Verrill_                                                         _See page 12_         SWALLOWTAIL BUTTERFLY JUST OUT OF ITS CHRYSALIS.

There  is, however, a regularly recurring annual migration on the part of  some butterflies which is also a phenomenon of extraordinary interest.  The most notable example is that of the Monarch which apparently  follows the birds southward every autumn and comes northward again in  spring. There is much evidence to indicate that in some slight degree  other butterflies have a similar habit, although the present  observations are inadequate to determine to what extent this habit has  become fixed in most of these species.          HIBERNATION OR WINTER LETHARGY      The ways in which butterflies spend the winter are always of peculiar  interest to the naturalist. Here are creatures with four distinct  stages of existence, each of which has the possibility of carrying the  species through the season of cold. It is necessary to learn for each  insect which stage has been chosen for the purpose, and if possible to  find the reasons for the choice.    As a rule the related members of a group are likely to hibernate in a  similar stage. Thus most of the Swallowtails pass the winter as  chrysalids while practically all the Angle-wings pass the winter as  adults. This rule, however, has many exceptions, for one will often  find closely related species which differ in the stage of hibernation.    As one would expect, the conditions of hibernation vary greatly with  the latitude. In the severe climate of the far north the conditions  are likely to be more uniform than in the South where the milder  climate permits greater variation to the insect. In some cases where a  butterfly hibernates in only one stage in Canada it may pass the  winter in two or more stages in Alabama or Florida.    In many other orders of insects the egg is a favorite stage for  hibernation. Even in the closely related moths it is often chosen by  many species, but comparatively few butterflies pass the winter in the  egg stage. The little Bronze Copper may serve as one example of this  limited group.    The conditions as to hibernation by the larvae of butterflies are very  different from those of the egg. It has been estimated that probably  half of all our species pass the winter in some stage of caterpillar  growth. This varies all the way from the newly hatched caterpillar  which hibernates without tasting food to the fully grown caterpillar  which hibernates full fed and changes to a chrysalis in spring without  eating anything at that time. A large proportion, however, feed both  in fall and spring, going through the winter when approximately half  grown.    The Graylings and the Fritillaries are typical examples of butterflies  which hibernate as newly hatched larvae. The eggs are laid in autumn  upon or near the food plants and the caterpillars gnaw their way out  of the shells and seek seclusion at once, finding such shelter as they  may in the materials on the soil surface. In spring they begin to feed  as soon as the weather permits and complete their growth from then  on.    The half-grown caterpillars may hibernate either as free creatures  under boards, stones, or in the turfy grass, or they may be protected  by special shelters which they have provided for themselves in their  earlier life. In the case of the latter each may have a shelter of its  own or there may be a common shelter for a colony of caterpillars.  Among the examples of those hibernating in miscellaneous situations  without special protection the caterpillars of the Tawny Emperor, the  Gray Emperor, the Pearl Crescent, and some of the Graylings are  examples.

SO2 is  called sulphur dioxide, to distinguish it from SO3, sulphur  trioxide. Name these: CO2, SiO2, MnO2. The prefixes are: mono or  proto, one; di or bi, two; tri or ter, three; tetra, four; pente,  five; hex, six; etc. Diarsenic pentoxide is written, As2O5.  Symbolize these: carbon protoxide, diphosphorus pentoxide,  diphosphorus trioxide, iron disulphide, iron protosulphide. Often  only the prefix of the last name is used.    16. An Oxide is a Compound of Oxygen and Some Other Element, as  HgO. What is a chloride? Define sulphide, phosphide, arsenide,  carbide, bromide, iodide, fluoride.    In Experiment 6, where S and Fe united, the symbol of the product  was FeS. Name it. How many parts by weight of each element? What  is its molecular weight? To produce FeS a chemical union took  place between each atom of the Fe and of the S. We may express  this reaction, i.e. chemical action, by an equation:--                             Iron + Sulphur = Iron Sulphide  Or, using symbols    Fe  +    S  =      FeS  Using atomic weights,      56      32    =      88.      These equations are explained by saying that 56 parts by weight  of iron unite chemically with 32 parts by weight of sulphur to  produce 88 parts by weight of iron sulphide. This, then,  indicates the proportion of each element which combines, and  which should be taken for the experiment. If 56 g. of Fe be used,  32 g. of S should be taken. If we use more than 56 parts of Fe  with 32 of S, will it all combine? If more than 32 of S with 56  of Fe? There is found to be a definite quantity of each element  in every chemical compound. Symbols would have no meaning if this  were not so.    Write and explain the equation for the experiment with copper and  sulphur, using names, symbols, and weights, as above.    CHAPTER V.    MANIPULATION.    17. To Break Glass Tubing.    Experiment 8.--Lay the tubing on a flat surface, and draw a sharp  three-cornered file two or three times at right angles across it  where it is to be broken, till a scratch is made. Take the tube  in the hands, having the two thumbs nearly opposite the scratch,  and the fingers on the other side. Press outward quickly with the  thumbs, and at the same time pull the hands strongly apart, and  the tubing should break squarely at the scratch.    To break large tubing, or cut off bottles, lamp chimneys, etc.,  first make a scratch as before; then heat the handle of a file,  or a blunt iron--in a blast-lamp flame by preference--till it is  red-hot, and at once press it against the scratch till the glass  begins to crack. The fracture can be led in any direction by  keeping the iron just in front of it. Re-heat the iron as often  as necessary.    18. To Make Ignition-Tubes.    Experiment 9.--Hold the glass tubing between the thumb and  forefinger of each hand, resting it against the second finger.  Heat it in the upper flame, slowly at first, then strongly, but  heat only a very small portion in length, and keep it in constant  rotation with the right hand. Hold it steadily, and avoid  twisting it as the glass softens. The yielding is detected by the  yellow flame above the glass and by an uneven pressure on the  hands. Pull it a little as it yields, then heat a part just at  one side of the most softened portion. Rotate constantly without  twisting, and soon it can be separated into two closed tubes. No  thread should be attached; but if there be one, it can be broken  off and the end welded. The bottom can be made more symmetrical  by heating it red-hot, then blowing, gradually, into the open  end, this being inserted in the mouth. The parts should be  annealed by holding above the flame for a short time, to cool  slowly.    For hard glass--Bohemian--or large tubes, the blast-lamp or  blowpipe is needed. In the blast-lamp air is forced out with  illuminating gas. This gives a high degree of heat. Bulbs can be  made in the same way as ignition-tubes, and thistle-tubes are  made by blowing out the end of a heated bulb, and rounding it  with charcoal.    19. To Bend Glass Tubing.    Experiment 10.--Hold the tube in the upper flame. Rotate it so as  to heat all parts equally, and let the flame spread over 3 or 4  cm. in length. When the glass begins to yield, without removing  from the flame slowly bend it as desired. Avoid twisting, and be  sure to have all parts in the same plane; also avoid bending too  quickly, if you would have a well-rounded joint. Anneal each bend  as made. Heated glass of any kind should never be brought in  contact with a cool body. For making O, H, etc., a glass tube --  delivery-tube--50 cm. long should have three bends, as in Figure  6. The pupil should first experiment with short pieces of glass,  10 or 15 cm. long. An ordinary gas flame is the best for bending  glass.    20. To Cut Glass.    Experiment 11.--Lay the glass plate on a flat surface, and draw a  steel glass-cutter--revolving wheel--over it, holding this  against a ruler for a guide, and pressing down hard enough to  scratch the glass. Then break it by holding between the thumb and  fingers, having the thumbs on the side opposite to the scratch,  and pressing them outward while bending the ends of the glass  inward. The break will follow the scratch.    Holes can be bored through glass and bottles with a broken end of  a round file kept wet with a solution of camphor in oil of  turpentine.    21. To Perforate Corks.    Experiment 12.--First make a small hole in the cork with the  pointed handle of a round--rat-tail--file. Have the hole  perpendicular to the surface of the cork. This can be done by  holding the cork in the left hand and pressing against the larger  surface, or upper part, of the cork, with the file in the right  hand. Only a mere opening is made in this way, which must be  enlarged by the other end of the file. A second or third file of  larger size may be employed, according to the size of the hole to  be made, which must be a little smaller than the tube it is to  receive, and perfectly round.    CHAPTER VI.    OXYGEN.    22. To Obtain Oxygen.    Experiment 13.--Take 5 g. of crystals of potassium chlorate  (KClO3) and, without pulverizing, mix with the same weight of  pure powdered manganese dioxide (MnO2). Put the mixture into a  t.t., and insert a d.t.--delivery-tube--having the cork fit  tightly. Hang it on a r.s.--ring-stand,-- as in Figure 7, having  the other end of the d.t.    (Fig 7.)    under the shelf, in a pneumatic trough, filled with water just  above the shelf. Fill three or more receivers--wide-mouthed  bottles--with water, cover the mouth of each with a glass plate,  invert it with its mouth under water, and put it on the shelf of  the trough, removing the plate. No air should be in the bottles.  Have the end of the d.t. so that the gas will rise through the  orifice. Hold a lighted lamp in the hand, and bring the flame  against the mixture in the t.t. Keep    the lamp slightly in motion, with the hand, so as not"]]]
