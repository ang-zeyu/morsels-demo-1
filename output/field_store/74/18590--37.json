'It is now twelve years, St. Aubert,' said M. Quesnel, 'since I  purchased your family estate.'--'Somewhere thereabout,' replied St.  Aubert, suppressing a sigh. 'It is near five years since I have been  there,' resumed Quesnel; 'for Paris and its neighbourhood is the only  place in the world to live in, and I am so immersed in politics, and  have so many affairs of moment on my hands, that I find it difficult  to steal away even for a month or two.' St. Aubert remaining silent, M.  Quesnel proceeded: 'I have sometimes wondered how you, who have lived  in the capital, and have been accustomed to company, can exist  elsewhere;--especially in so remote a country as this, where you can  neither hear nor see any thing, and can in short be scarcely conscious  of life.'    'I live for my family and myself,' said St. Aubert; 'I am now contented  to know only happiness;--formerly I knew life.'    'I mean to expend thirty or forty thousand livres on improvements,' said  M. Quesnel, without seeming to notice the words of St. Aubert; 'for I  design, next summer, to bring here my friends, the Duke de Durefort and  the Marquis Ramont, to pass a month or two with me.' To St. Aubert's  enquiry, as to these intended improvements, he replied, that he should  take down the whole east wing of the chateau, and raise upon the site  a set of stables. 'Then I shall build,' said he, 'a SALLE A MANGER, a  SALON, a SALLE AU COMMUNE, and a number of rooms for servants; for at  present there is not accommodation for a third part of my own people.'    'It accommodated our father's household,' said St. Aubert, grieved that  the old mansion was to be thus improved, 'and that was not a small one.'    'Our notions are somewhat enlarged since those days,' said M.  Quesnel;--'what was then thought a decent style of living would not now  be endured.' Even the calm St. Aubert blushed at these words, but  his anger soon yielded to contempt. 'The ground about the chateau is  encumbered with trees; I mean to cut some of them down.'    'Cut down the trees too!' said St. Aubert.    'Certainly. Why should I not? they interrupt my prospects. There is a  chesnut which spreads its branches before the whole south side of the  chateau, and which is so ancient that they tell me the hollow of its  trunk will hold a dozen men. Your enthusiasm will scarcely contend that  there can be either use, or beauty, in such a sapless old tree as this.'    'Good God!' exclaimed St. Aubert, 'you surely will not destroy that  noble chesnut, which has flourished for centuries, the glory of the  estate! It was in its maturity when the present mansion was built. How  often, in my youth, have I climbed among its broad branches, and sat  embowered amidst a world of leaves, while the heavy shower has pattered  above, and not a rain drop reached me! How often I have sat with a book  in my hand, sometimes reading, and sometimes looking out between the  branches upon the wide landscape, and the setting sun, till twilight  came, and brought the birds home to their little nests among the leaves!  How often--but pardon me,' added St. Aubert, recollecting that he was  speaking to a man who could neither comprehend, nor allow his feelings,  'I am talking of times and feelings as old-fashioned as the taste that  would spare that venerable tree.'    'It will certainly come down,' said M. Quesnel; 'I believe I shall plant  some Lombardy poplars among the clumps of chesnut, that I shall leave  of the avenue; Madame Quesnel is partial to the poplar, and tells me how  much it adorns a villa of her uncle, not far from Venice.'    'On the banks of the Brenta, indeed,' continued St. Aubert, 'where its  spiry form is intermingled with the pine, and the cypress, and where  it plays over light and elegant porticos and colonnades, it,  unquestionably, adorns the scene; but among the giants of the forest,  and near a heavy gothic mansion--'    'Well, my good sir,' said M. Quesnel, 'I will not dispute with you. You  must return to Paris before our ideas can at all agree. But A-PROPOS of  Venice, I have some thoughts of going thither, next summer; events may  call me to take possession of that same villa, too, which they tell me  is the most charming that can be imagined. In that case I shall leave  the improvements I mention to another year, and I may, perhaps, be  tempted to stay some time in Italy.'    Emily was somewhat surprised to hear him talk of being tempted to remain  abroad, after he had mentioned his presence to be so necessary at Paris,  that it was with difficulty he could steal away for a month or two; but  St. Aubert understood the self-importance of the man too well to wonder  at this trait; and the possibility, that these projected improvements  might be deferred, gave him a hope, that they might never take place.    Before they separated for the night, M. Quesnel desired to speak with  St. Aubert alone, and they retired to another room, where they remained  a considerable time. The subject of this conversation was not known;  but, whatever it might be, St. Aubert, when he returned to the  supper-room, seemed much disturbed, and a shade of sorrow sometimes fell  upon his features that alarmed Madame St. Aubert. When they were alone  she was tempted to enquire the occasion of it, but the delicacy of mind,  which had ever appeared in his conduct, restrained her: she considered  that, if St. Aubert wished her to be acquainted with the subject of his  concern, he would not wait on her enquiries.    On the following day, before M. Quesnel departed, he had a second  conference with St. Aubert.    The guests, after dining at the chateau, set out in the cool of the day  for Epourville, whither they gave him and Madame St. Aubert a pressing  invitation, prompted rather by the vanity of displaying their splendour,  than by a wish to make their friends happy.    Emily returned, with delight, to the liberty which their presence had  restrained, to her books, her walks, and the rational conversation of  M. and Madame St. Aubert, who seemed to rejoice, no less, that they were  delivered from the shackles, which arrogance and frivolity had imposed.    Madame St. Aubert excused herself from sharing their usual evening walk,  complaining that she was not quite well, and St. Aubert and Emily went  out together.    They chose a walk towards the mountains, intending to visit some old  pensioners of St. Aubert, which, from his very moderate income, he  contrived to support, though it is probable M. Quesnel, with his very  large one, could not have afforded this.    After distributing to his pensioners their weekly stipends, listening  patiently to the complaints of some, redressing the grievances of  others, and softening the discontents of all, by the look of sympathy,  and the smile of benevolence, St. Aubert returned home through the  woods,         where   At fall of eve the fairy-people throng,   In various games and revelry to pass   The summer night, as village stories tell.*       *Thomson      'The evening gloom of woods was always delightful to me,' said St.  Aubert, whose mind now experienced the sweet calm, which results from  the consciousness of having done a beneficent action, and which disposes  it to receive pleasure from every surrounding object. 'I remember that  in my youth this gloom used to call forth to my fancy a thousand fairy  visions, and romantic images; and, I own, I am not yet wholly insensible  of that high enthusiasm, which wakes the poet's dream: I can linger,  with solemn steps, under the deep shades, send forward a transforming  eye into the distant obscurity, and listen with thrilling delight to the  mystic murmuring of the woods.'    'O my dear father,' said Emily, while a sudden tear started to her eye,  'how exactly you describe what I have felt so often, and which I thought  nobody had ever felt but myself! But hark! here comes the sweeping sound  over the wood-tops;--now it dies away;--how solemn the stillness that  succeeds! Now the breeze swells again. It is like the voice of some  supernatural being--the voice of the spirit of the woods, that watches  over them by night. Ah! what light is yonder? But it is gone. And now it  gleams again, near the root of that large chestnut: look, sir!'    'Are you such an admirer of nature,' said St. Aubert, 'and so little  acquainted with her appearances as not to know that for the glow-worm?  But come,' added he gaily, 'step a little further, and we shall see  fairies, perhaps; they are often companions. The glow-worm lends his  light, and they in return charm him with music, and the dance. Do you  see nothing tripping yonder?'    Emily laughed. 'Well, my dear sir,' said she, 'since you allow of this  alliance, I may venture to own I have anticipated you; and almost dare  venture to repeat some verses I made one evening in these very woods.'    'Nay,' replied St. Aubert, 'dismiss the ALMOST, and venture quite; let  us hear what vagaries fancy has been playing in your mind. If she has  given you one of her spells, you need not envy those of the fairies.'    'If it is strong enough to enchant your judgment, sir,' said Emily,  'while I disclose her images, I need NOT envy them. The lines go in a  sort of tripping measure, which I thought might suit the subject well  enough, but I fear they are too irregular.'      THE GLOW-WORM     How pleasant is the green-wood's deep-matted shade    On a mid-summer's eve, when the fresh rain is o'er;   When the yellow beams slope, and sparkle thro' the glade,    And swiftly in the thin air the light swallows soar!     But sweeter, sweeter still, when the sun sinks to rest,    And "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32706"],[0,"Triplanetary (#4)"],[1,"time-space surveys; that they and subsequent Elders  were able to maintain the status quo; and that the Eddorian way of  thought is essentially mechanistic, rather than philosophic, in nature.  There is still a possibility that the enemy may be able to deduce us by  processes of logic alone. This thought is particularly disturbing to me  at the present time because a rigid statistical analysis of the  occurrences upon those four planets shows that they cannot possibly  have been due to chance. With such an analysis as a starting point, a  mind of even moderate ability could visualize us practically in toto. I  assume, however, that this possibility has been taken into  consideration, and suggest that the membership be informed.\"    \"The point is well taken. The possibility exists. While the probability  is very great that such an analysis will not be made until after we have  declared ourselves, it is not a certainty. Immediately upon deducing our  existence, however, the Eddorians would begin to build against us, upon  the four planets and elsewhere. Since there is only one effective  counter-structure possible, and since we Elders have long been alert to  detect the first indications of that particular activity, we know that  the situation remains unchanged. If it changes, we will call at once  another full meeting of minds. Are there any other matters of moment...?  If not, this conference will dissolve.\"      3. ATLANTIS    Ariponides, recently elected Faros of Atlantis for his third five-year  term, stood at a window of his office atop the towering Farostery. His  hands were clasped loosely behind his back. He did not really see the  tremendous expanse of quiet ocean, nor the bustling harbor, nor the  metropolis spread out so magnificently and so busily beneath him. He  stood there, motionless, until a subtle vibration warned him that  visitors were approaching his door.    \"Come in, gentlemen.... Please be seated.\" He sat down at one end of a  table molded of transparent plastic. \"Psychologist Talmonides, Statesman  Cleto, Minister Philamon, Minister Marxes and Officer Artomenes, I have  asked you to come here personally because I have every reason to believe  that the shielding of this room is proof against eavesdroppers; a thing  which can no longer be said of our supposedly private television  channels. We must discuss, and if possible come to some decision  concerning, the state in which our nation now finds itself.    \"Each of us knows within himself exactly what he is. Of our own powers,  we cannot surely know each others' inward selves. The tools and  techniques of psychology, however, are potent and exact; and Talmonides,  after exhaustive and rigorous examination of each one of us, has  certified that no taint of disloyalty exists among us.\"    \"Which certification is not worth a damn,\" the burly Officer declared.  \"What assurance do we have that Talmonides himself is not one of the  ringleaders? Mind you, I have no reason to believe that he is not  completely loyal. In fact, since he has been one of my best friends for  over twenty years, I believe implicitly that he is. Nevertheless the  plain fact is, Ariponides, that all the precautions you have taken, and  any you can take, are and will be useless insofar as definite knowledge  is concerned. The real truth is and will remain unknown.\"    \"You are right,\" the Psychologist conceded. \"And, such being the case,  perhaps I should withdraw from the meeting.\"    \"That wouldn't help, either.\" Artomenes shook his head. \"Any competent  plotter would be prepared for this, as for any other contingency. One of  us others would be the real operator.\"    \"And the fact that our Officer is the one who is splitting hairs so  finely could be taken to indicate which one of us the real operator  could be,\" Marxes pointed out, cuttingly.    \"Gentlemen! Gentlemen!\" Ariponides protested. \"While absolute certainty  is of course impossible to any finite mind, you all know how Talmonides  was tested; you know that in his case there is no reasonable doubt. Such  chance as exists, however, must be taken, for if we do not trust each  other fully in this undertaking, failure is inevitable. With this word  of warning I will get on with my report.    \"This worldwide frenzy of unrest followed closely upon the controlled  liberation of atomic energy and may be--probably is--traceable to it. It  is in no part due to imperialistic aims or acts on the part of Atlantis.  This fact cannot be stressed too strongly. We never have been and are  not now interested in Empire. It is true that the other nations began as  Atlantean colonies, but no attempt was ever made to hold any one of them  in colonial status against the wish of its electorate. All nations were  and are sister states. We gain or lose together. Atlantis, the parent,  was and is a clearing-house, a co-ordinator of effort, but has never  claimed or sought authority to rule; all decisions being based upon free  debate and free and secret ballot.    \"But now! Parties and factions everywhere, even in old Atlantis. Every  nation is torn by internal dissensions and strife. Nor is this all.  Uighar as a nation is insensately jealous of the Islands of the South,  who in turn are jealous of Maya. Maya of Bantu, Bantu of Ekopt, Ekopt of  Norheim, and Norheim of Uighar. A vicious circle, worsened by other  jealousies and hatreds intercrossing everywhere. Each fears that some  other is about to try to seize control of the entire world; and there  seems to be spreading rapidly the utterly baseless belief that Atlantis  itself is about to reduce all other nations of Earth to vassalage.    \"This is a bald statement of the present condition of the world as I see  it. Since I can see no other course possible within the constituted  framework of our democratic government, I recommend that we continue our  present activities, such as the international treaties and agreements  upon which we are now at work, intensifying our effort wherever  possible. We will now hear from Statesman Cleto.\"    \"You have outlined the situation clearly enough, Faros. My thought,  however, is that the principal cause of the trouble is the coming into  being of this multiplicity of political parties, particularly those  composed principally of crackpots and extremists. The connection with  atomic energy is clear: since the atomic bomb gives a small group of  people the power to destroy the world, they reason that it thereby  confers upon them the authority to dictate to the world. My  recommendation is merely a special case of yours; that every effort be  made to influence the electorates of Norheim and of Uighar into  supporting an effective international control of atomic energy.\"    \"You have your data tabulated in symbolics?\" asked Talmonides, from his  seat at the keyboard of a calculating machine.    \"Yes. Here they are.\"    \"Thanks.\"    \"Minister Philamon,\" the Faros announced.    \"As I see it--as any intelligent man should be able to see it--the  principal contribution of atomic energy to this worldwide chaos was the  complete demoralization of labor,\" the gray-haired Minister of Trade  stated, flatly. \"Output per man-hour should have gone up at least twenty  percent, in which case prices would automatically have come down.  Instead, short-sighted guilds imposed drastic curbs on production, and  now seem to be surprised that as production falls and hourly wages rise,  prices also rise and real income drops. Only one course is possible,  gentlemen; labor _must_ be made to listen to reason. This  feather-bedding, this protected loafing, this....\"    \"I protest!\" Marxes, Minister of Work, leaped to his feet. \"The blame  lies squarely with the capitalists. Their greed, their rapacity, their  exploitation of....\"    \"One moment, please!\" Ariponides rapped the table sharply. \"It is highly  significant of the deplorable condition of the times that two Ministers  of State should speak as you two have just spoken. I take it that  neither of you has anything new to contribute to this symposium?\"    Both claimed the floor, but both were refused it by vote.    \"Hand your tabulated data to Talmonides,\" the Faros directed. \"Officer  Artomenes?\"    \"You, our Faros, have more than intimated that our defense program, for  which I am primarily responsible, has been largely to blame for what has  happened,\" the grizzled warrior began. \"In part, perhaps it was--one  must be blind indeed not to see the connection, and biased indeed not to  admit it. But what should I have done, knowing that there is no  practical defense against the atomic bomb? Every nation has them, and is  manufacturing more and more. Every nation is infested with the agents of  every other. Should I have tried to keep Atlantis toothless in a world  bristling with fangs? And could I--or anyone else--have succeeded in  doing so?\"    \"Probably not. No criticism was intended; we must deal with the  situation as it actually exists. Your recommendations, please?\"    \"I have thought this thing over day and night, and can see no solution  which can be made acceptable to our--or to any real--democracy.  Nevertheless, I have one recommendation to make. We all know that  Norheim and Uighar are the sore spots--particularly Norheim. We have  more bombs as of now than both of them together. We know that Uighar's  super-sonic jobs are ready. We don't know exactly what Norheim has,  since they cut my Intelligence line a while back, but I'm sending over  another operative--my best man, too--tonight. If he finds out that we  have enough advantage in speed, and I'm pretty sure that we have, I say  hit both Norheim and Uighar right then, while we can, before they hit  us. And hit them hard--pulverize them. Then set up a world government  strong enough to knock out any nation--including Atlantis--that will not  cooperate with it. This course of action is flagrantly against all  international law and all the principles "]]]
