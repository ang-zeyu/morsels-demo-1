He took from the pocket of his blazer a letter which had arrived some  days before from an artist friend of his who was on a sketching tour  in Devonshire and Somerset. There was a penciled memorandum on the  envelope in his own handwriting:    _Mem._ Might work K. L.'s story about M. and the W--s's into comic  yarn for one of the weeklies.    He gazed at this for a while, with a last hope that in it might be  contained the germ of something which would enable him to turn out a  morning's work; but having completely forgotten who K. L. was, and  especially what was his (or her) story about M., whoever he (or she)  might be, he abandoned this hope and turned to the letter in the  envelope.    The earlier portions of the letter dealt tantalizingly with the  scenery. \"Bits,\" come upon by accident at the end of disused lanes and  transferred with speed to canvas, were described concisely but with  sufficient breadth to make Garnet long to see them for himself. There  were brief _resumes_ of dialogues between Lickford (the writer) and  weird rustics. The whole letter breathed of the country and the open  air. The atmosphere of Garnet's sitting room seemed to him to become  stuffier with every sentence he read.    The postscript interested him.    \"... By the way, at Yeovil I came across an old friend of yours.  Stanley Featherstonhaugh Ukridge, of all people. As large as  life--quite six foot two, and tremendously filled out. I thought he  was abroad. The last I heard of him was that he had started for Buenos  Ayres in a cattle-ship. It seems he has been in England sometime. I  met him in the refreshment room at Yeovil station. I was waiting for a  down train; he had changed on his way to town. As I opened the door I  heard a huge voice in a more or less violent altercation, and there  was S. F. U., in a villainous old suit of gray flannels (I'll swear it  was the same one that he had on last time I saw him), and a  mackintosh, though it was a blazing hot day. His pince-nez were tacked  onto his ears with wire as usual. He greeted me with effusive shouts,  and drew me aside. Then after a few commonplaces of greeting, he  fumbled in his pockets, looked pained and surprised.    \"'Look here, Licky,' he said. 'You know I never borrow. It's against  my principles. But I _must_ have a shilling, or I'm a ruined man. I  seem to have had my pocket picked by some scoundrelly blackguard. Can  you, my dear fellow, oblige me with a shilling until next Tuesday  afternoon at three-thirty? I never borrow, so I'll tell you what I'll  do. I'll let you have this (producing a beastly little three-penny-bit  with a hole in it) until I can pay you back. This is of more value to  me than I can well express, Licky, my boy. A very, very dear friend  gave it to me when we parted, years ago. It's a wrench to part with  it. But grim necessity ... I can hardly do it.... Still, no, no, ...  you must take it, you must take it. Licky, old man, shake hands!  Shake hands, my boy!'    \"He then asked after you, and said you were the noblest man--except  me--on earth. I gave him your address, not being able to get out of  it, but if I were you I should fly while there is yet time.\"    \"That,\" said Jerry Garnet, \"is the soundest bit of advice I've heard.  I will.\"    \"Mrs. Medley,\" he said, when that lady made her appearance.    \"Sir?\"    \"I'm going away for a few weeks. You can let the rooms if you like.  I'll drop you a line when I think of coming back.\"    \"Yes, sir. And your letters. Where shall I send them, sir?\"    \"Till further notice,\" said Jerry Garnet, pulling out a giant  portmanteau from a corner of the room and flinging it open, \"care of  the Dalai Lama, No. 3 Younghusband Terrace, Tibet.\"    \"Yes, sir,\" said Mrs. Medley placidly.    \"I'll write you my address to-night. I don't know where I'm going yet.  Is that an A. B. C. over there? Good. Give my love to that bright  young spirit on the top floor, and tell him that I hope my not being  here to listen won't interfere in any way with his morning popular  concerts.\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"And, Mrs. Medley, if a man named ----\"    Mrs. Medley had drifted silently away. During his last speech a  thunderous knocking had begun on the front door.    Jerry Garnet stood and listened, transfixed. Something seemed to tell  him who was at the business end of that knocker.    He heard Mrs. Medley's footsteps pass along the hall and pause at the  door. Then there was the click of the latch. Then a volume of sound  rushed up to him where he stood over his empty portmanteau.    \"Is Mr. Garnet in?\"    Mrs. Medley's reply was inaudible, but apparently in the affirmative.    \"Where is he?\" boomed the voice. \"Show me the old horse. First floor.  Thank you. Where is the man of wrath?\"    There followed a crashing on the stairs such as even the young  gentleman of the top floor had been unable to produce in his nocturnal  rovings. The house shook.    And with the tramping came the thunderous voice, as the visitor once  more gave tongue.    \"Garnet! GARNET!! GARNET!!!\"          UKRIDGE'S SCHEME    II      Mr. Stanley Featherstonhaugh Ukridge dashed into the room, uttering a  roar of welcome as he caught sight of Garnet, still standing petrified  athwart his portmanteau.    \"My dear old man,\" he shouted, springing at him and seizing his hand  in a clutch that effectually woke Garnet from his stupor. \"How _are_  you, old chap? This is good. By Jove, this is good! This is fine,  what?\"    He dashed back to the door and looked out.    \"Come on, Millie,\" he shouted.    Garnet was wondering who in the name of fortune Millie could possibly  be, when there appeared on the further side of Mr. Ukridge the figure  of a young woman. She paused in the doorway, and smiled pleasantly.    \"Garnet, old horse,\" said Ukridge with some pride, \"let me introduce  you to my wife. Millie, this is old Garnet. You've heard me talk about  him.\"    \"Oh, yes,\" said Mrs. Ukridge.    Garnet bowed awkwardly. The idea of Ukridge married was something too  overpowering to be assimilated on the instant. If ever there was a man  designed by nature to be a bachelor, Stanley Ukridge was that man.  Garnet could feel that he himself was not looking his best. He knew in  a vague, impersonal way that his eyebrows were still somewhere in the  middle of his forehead, whither they had sprung in the first moment of  surprise, and that his jaw, which had dropped, had not yet resumed  its normal posture. Before committing himself to speech he made a  determined effort to revise his facial expression.    \"Buck up, old horse,\" said Ukridge. He had a painful habit of  addressing all and sundry by that title. In his school-master days he  had made use of it while interviewing the parents of new pupils, and  the latter had gone away, as a rule, with a feeling that this must be  either the easy manner of genius or spirits, and hoping for the best.  Later, he had used it to perfect strangers in the streets. On one  occasion he had been heard to address a bishop by that title.    \"Surprised to find me married, what? Garny, old boy\"--sinking his  voice to what was intended to be a whisper--\"take my tip. You go and  do the same. You feel another man. Give up this bachelor business.  It's a mug's game. Go and get married, my boy, go and get married. By  gad, I've forgotten to pay the cabby. Half a moment.\"    He was out of the door and on his way downstairs before the echoes of  his last remark had ceased to shake the window of the sitting room.  Garnet was left to entertain Mrs. Ukridge.    So far her share in the conversation had been small. Nobody talked  very much when Ukridge was on the scene. She sat on the edge of  Garnet's big basket chair, looking very small and quiet. She smiled  pleasantly, as she had done during the whole of the preceding  dialogue. It was apparently her chief form of expression.    Jerry Garnet felt very friendly toward her. He could not help pitying  her. Ukridge, he thought, was a very good person to know casually, but  a little of him, as his former headmaster had once said in a moody,  reflective voice, went a very long way. To be bound to him for life  was not the ideal state for a girl. If he had been a girl, he felt,  he would as soon have married a volcano.    \"And she's so young,\" he thought, as he looked across at the basket  chair. \"Quite a kid.\"    \"You and Stanley have known each other a long time, haven't you?\" said  the object of his pity, breaking the silence.    \"Yes. Oh, yes,\" said Garnet. \"Several years. We were masters at the  same school together.\"    Mrs. Ukridge leaned forward with round, shining eyes.    \"Isn't he a _wonderful_ man, Mr. Garnet!\" she said ecstatically.    Not yet, to judge from her expression and the tone of her voice, had  she had experience of the disadvantages attached to the position of  Mrs. Stanley Ukridge.    Garnet could agree with her there.    \"Yes, he is certainly wonderful,\" he said.    \"I believe he could do anything.\"    \"Yes,\" said Garnet. He believed that Ukridge was at least capable of  anything.    \"He has done so many things. Have you ever kept fowls?\" she broke off  with apparent irrelevance.    \"No,\" said Garnet. \"You see, I spend so much of my time in town. I  should find it difficult.\"    Mrs. Ukridge looked disappointed.    \"I was hoping you might have had some experience. Stanley, of course,  can turn his hand to anything, but I think experience is such a good  thing, don't you?\"    \"It is,\" said Garnet, mystified. \"But--\"    \"I have bought a shilling book called 'Fowls and All About Them,' but  it is very hard to understand. You see, we--but here is Stanley. He  will explain it all.\"    \"Well, Garnet, old horse,\" said Ukridge, reentering the room after  another energetic passage of the stairs, \"settle down and let's talk  business.

The posts were gray where they  were not moss-covered.    \"In one of these gray-green posts was a hole where a pair of  woodpeckers had once built their nest.    \"'This is the very place for us!' cried Mrs. Chickadee.  'It could not  be better though we hollowed it out for ourselves.'\"    \"Could you?\" asked Phyllis, looking at the bird's little short black  bill.    \"If need be, we could, indeed,\" replied the chickadee.  \"But we would  far rather find a knot-hole, or a squirrel's or woodpecker's deserted  nest.    \"When we had decided on the spot,\" the bird went on, \"we at once began  lining the nest.  We carried fine grasses and soft feathers.  We found  mosses and rabbits' fur to make it soft.    \"Those were indeed happy days for us.  They were also exciting days.  We were very careful to let no one know what we were about.    \"Once, as I flew home with a bit of moss, I saw a boy lying on the  grass not far from our fence-post.  It would never do to let him know  our secret.  Boys are not to be trusted.    \"I perched upon the fence and pretended that I had never a thought of  nest building.    \"In a moment Mrs. Chickadee came flying home with a soft, downy  feather.  When I called out warningly she at once flew to me.    \"Then the boy called softly to his little sister.    \"'Come quick,' he said, 'if you want to watch these birds build their  nest.'    \"A little dark-eyed girl crept up beside the boy.  We scarcely knew  what to do.  Soon a bright idea occurred to me.  I began to sing my  very best.  I also performed my most wonderful tricks.  I whirled round  and round.  I darted between the rails.  I spun about.    \"The children became so interested in my performance that they forgot  to watch Mrs. Chickadee.  When they were not looking her way, she flew  to the nest and arranged the feather.    \"When she returned she took my place on the fence.  Now my wife and I  look very much alike, and though she cannot perform quite as nimbly as  I, the children did not know when we changed places.    \"While the children watched her I flew to the nest with my bit of moss.    \"'What a pity!' said the little girl, as we flew away laughing to  ourselves.  'They stopped to play and they lost the bits of moss and  feathers with which they meant to make their nest!'    \"'Chick-a-dee!  Chick-a-dee!  Chick-a-dee!' called back my wife  happily.\"    All this time Phyllis's eyes were growing rounder and bigger.    \"Why,\" said she, \"I never knew there was but one bird performing on the  fence.  I thought the other flew away!\"    \"That was because Mrs. Chickadee and I look so much alike,\" replied Mr.  Chickadee.    \"But we did find your nest a few days later,\" said Phyllis.  \"In it  were six small white eggs covered with tiny red specks.  We went to  look at the nest every day until the eggs hatched.  Then we went  several times a day until the baby birds learned to fly and left the  nest empty.    \"But you did not disturb us,\" said the chickadee, \"though we were  dreadfully frightened at first.\"    At that moment a great soft snowball went plump! against Phyllis's red  cap.    \"Jack!\" she cried, scrambling off the fence and running after the boy  with the scratch on his nose.  \"Jack, take me for a ride on your sled!\"    Then she looked back.  The chickadee now sat in the tree-top.    \"Tell Mrs. Chickadee,\" called Phyllis, \"that I shall spread some more  crumbs and seeds on the white table-cloth this afternoon.  We'll hang  another bone in the cedar-tree, too!\"    \"Chick-a-dee-dee-dee!\" cried the little bird in a flutter of delight.          TWENTY LITTLE CHICKADEES      Twenty little chickadees,      Sitting in a row;    Twenty pairs of naked feet      Buried in the snow.    I should think you'd fly away      Where the weather's warm,    Then you wouldn't have to be      Out there in the storm.      Sorry little chickadees,      Don't you know the way?    Can't you find the road to go      Where 'tis always May?    Robins all have found it out,      Wrens and bluebirds too,    Don't you wish you'd thought to ask      Ere away they flew?          THE SNOWBIRD'S SONG[1]      The ground was all covered with snow, one day,    And two little sisters were busy at play--    A snowbird was sitting close by on a tree,    And merrily singing his chick-a-de-dee!      He had not been singing that tune very long,    When Emily heard him, so loud was his song.    \"Oh, sister, look out of the window!\" said she,    \"Here's a dear little bird, singing chick-a-de-dee!      \"Poor fellow! he walks in the snow and the sleet    And has neither stockings nor shoes on his feet,    I wonder what makes him so full of his glee,    And why he keeps singing, his chick-a-de-dee.      \"If I were a barefooted snowbird, I know,    I would not stay out in the cold and the snow.    I pity him so!  Oh, how cold he must be,    And yet he keeps singing his chick-a-de-dee.      \"Oh, mother, do get him some stockings and shoes,    And a nice little frock, and a hat, let him choose.    I wish he'd come into the parlour, and see    How warm we would make him, poor chick-a-de-dee!\"      The bird had flown down for some sweet crumbs of bread,    And heard every word little Emily said.    \"How funny I'd look in that costume!\" thought he,    And he laughed, as he warbled his chick-a-de-dee.      \"I am grateful,\" said he, \"for the wish you express,    But I have no occasion for such a fine dress.    I'd rather remain with my little limbs free,    Than to hobble about singing chick-a-de-dee.      \"There is One, my dear child, though I cannot tell who,    Has clothed me already, and warm enough, too.    Good morning!  Oh, who are so happy as we?\"    And away he flew, singing his chick-a-de-dee.        [1] From \"The Second Reader--of the Rational Method In Reading.\"          HOW THE BIRDS GOT THEIR FEATHERS    (IROQUOIS MYTH)    That evening, as the family sat beside the hearth, Phyllis thought of  the brave little chickadees out in the fir-trees.    \"I wonder if they are really warm enough,\" she said.  \"Do feathers make  a warm dress, mother?  Why do birds have feathers instead of fur?\"    \"I have heard the story that the Indians tell of how the birds got  their feathers,\" said mother.  \"Bring your chairs closer and I will  tell the story to you.\"    So the children drew their chairs up into the firelight, and listened  to this little Indian story:    \"Once some little Indian children,\" began the mother, \"gathered about  the fire inside their deerskin wigwam and begged their mother for a  story.    \"Each little Indian was wrapped in a bright coloured blanket.  Each  little Indian wore long turkey buzzard feathers in his hair.    \"The Indian mother looked at her baby braves proudly.  She thought of  the time when each of the children was a tiny papoose and swung in a  deerskin cradle like a bird in its nest.    \"'There was a time,' said the Indian squaw, 'when the birds had no  feathers.    \"'Being naked, they remained hidden among the leaves.  Being ashamed  they were silent, and no bird-note sweetened the stillness of the  forest.    \"'At last with faint chirpings the mother birds prayed the Great Spirit  for blankets in which to wrap their little ones.    \"'Then the Great Spirit, seeing their sorry plight, sent a messenger to  the birds, who told them that even now coverings were ready for every  bird.    \"'The messenger said that hereafter each family of birds should dress  in uniform, so that the forest people, seeing a bird, might know at  once, by its dress, to what bird family it belonged.    \"'But alas! the messenger also said that the uniforms were a great way  off.  He himself could not bring them to the forest.  The birds must  choose one who was strong of wing and able to endure great hardships,  to go back with him and bring the uniforms home.    \"'The poor featherless birds looked about for one who was brave and  fearless and untiring.  A council was held to induce some bird to go on  this long journey.    \"'But one and all pleaded some excuse.  Some must remain to care for  the babes still in the nest.  Some were too old to undertake the  journey.  Some were too young to find the way.    \"'Some had been ill and were still too weak to travel.  Indeed, the  birds seemed to be in as sad a plight as before.    \"'At last there stepped forth a bird, who, truth to tell, was not a  general favourite among his fellows.  His name was turkey buzzard.    \"'The bird agreed to undertake the long journey and bring back the  feathery uniforms, if he could choose the most beautiful coat of  feathers for himself and his family for ever.    \"'To this the other birds consented, and the featherless turkey buzzard  flew away.    \"'It was indeed a long and a dangerous journey.  Sometimes the poor  bird nearly dropped from weariness and hunger.  Sometimes, so hungry  was he, that he was forced to make a meal off from some dead animal  which lay in the way.  Indeed so often did he do this that in time he  came to like this food.    \"'It came to pass, after many days, that the turkey buzzard, being  directed by the Great Spirit, found the feathery uniforms.    \"'He at once began to look them over.  He intended to choose the most  beautiful coat of feathers for himself and his family.    \"'Soon he found a suit of most gorgeous colours.  He tried it on, and  looked at his own reflection in the water.  The dress was very  beautiful.  Well pleased with himself and his dress the turkey buzzard  gathered up the remaining uniforms and started for home.    \"'But alas! the new dress, although so beautiful, did not fit  comfortably.  The poor bird found that he could not fly well in his new  dress.  He tried another and still another bright coloured dress, but  in none of them was he comfortable.    \"'At length, quite discouraged, he slipped into a quiet, dark uniform.  Although this suit was the least "]]]
