[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20203"],[0,"Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin (#2)"],[1," the versatility  of his genius and achievements, the greatest of our self-made men. The  simple yet graphic story in the _Autobiography_ of his steady rise  from humble boyhood in a tallow-chandler shop, by industry, economy,  and perseverance in self-improvement, to eminence, is the most  remarkable of all the remarkable histories of our self-made men. It is  in itself a wonderful illustration of the results possible to be  attained in a land of unequaled opportunity by following Franklin's  maxims.    Franklin's fame, however, was not confined to his own country.  Although he lived in a century notable for the rapid evolution of  scientific and political thought and activity, yet no less a keen  judge and critic than Lord Jeffrey, the famous editor of the  _Edinburgh Review_, a century ago said that \"in one point of view  the name of Franklin must be considered as standing higher than any of  the others which illustrated the eighteenth century. Distinguished as  a statesman, he was equally great as a philosopher, thus uniting in  himself a rare degree of excellence in both these pursuits, to excel  in either of which is deemed the highest praise.\"    Franklin has indeed been aptly called \"many-sided.\" He was eminent in  science and public service, in diplomacy and in literature. He was the  Edison of his day, turning his scientific discoveries to the benefit  of his fellow-men. He perceived the identity of lightning and  electricity and set up the lightning rod. He invented the Franklin  stove, still widely used, and refused to patent it. He possessed a  masterly shrewdness in business and practical affairs. Carlyle called  him the father of all the Yankees. He founded a fire company, assisted  in founding a hospital, and improved the cleaning and lighting of  streets. He developed journalism, established the American  Philosophical Society, the public library in Philadelphia, and the  University of Pennsylvania. He organized a postal system for the  colonies, which was the basis of the present United States Post  Office. Bancroft, the eminent historian, called him \"the greatest  diplomatist of his century.\" He perfected the Albany Plan of Union for  the colonies. He is the only statesman who signed the Declaration of  Independence, the Treaty of Alliance with France, the Treaty of Peace  with England, and the Constitution. As a writer, he has produced, in  his _Autobiography_ and in _Poor Richard's Almanac_, two works that  are not surpassed by similar writing. He received honorary degrees  from Harvard and Yale, from Oxford and St. Andrews, and was made a  fellow of the Royal Society, which awarded him the Copley gold medal  for improving natural knowledge. He was one of the eight foreign  associates of the French Academy of Science.    The careful study of the _Autobiography_ is also valuable because of  the style in which it is written. If Robert Louis Stevenson is right  in believing that his remarkable style was acquired by imitation then  the youth who would gain the power to express his ideas clearly,  forcibly, and interestingly cannot do better than to study Franklin's  method. Franklin's fame in the scientific world was due almost as much  to his modest, simple, and sincere manner of presenting his  discoveries and to the precision and clearness of the style in which  he described his experiments, as to the results he was able to  announce. Sir Humphry Davy, the celebrated English chemist, himself an  excellent literary critic as well as a great scientist, said: \"A  singular felicity guided all Franklin's researches, and by very small  means he established very grand truths. The style and manner of his  publication on electricity are almost as worthy of admiration as the  doctrine it contains.\"    Franklin's place in literature is hard to determine because he was not  primarily a literary man. His aim in his writings as in his life work  was to be helpful to his fellow-men. For him writing was never an end  in itself, but always a means to an end. Yet his success as a  scientist, a statesman, and a diplomat, as well as socially, was in no  little part due to his ability as a writer. \"His letters charmed all,  and made his correspondence eagerly sought. His political arguments  were the joy of his party and the dread of his opponents. His  scientific discoveries were explained in language at once so simple  and so clear that plow-boy and exquisite could follow his thought or  his experiment to its conclusion.\"[1]        [1] _The Many-Sided Franklin._ Paul L. Ford.    As far as American literature is concerned, Franklin has no  contemporaries. Before the _Autobiography_ only one literary work of  importance had been produced in this country--Cotton Mather's  _Magnalia_, a church history of New England in a ponderous, stiff  style. Franklin was the first American author to gain a wide and  permanent reputation in Europe. The _Autobiography_, _Poor Richard_,  _Father Abraham's Speech_ or _The Way to Wealth_, as well as some of  the _Bagatelles_, are as widely known abroad as any American writings.  Franklin must also be classed as the first American humorist.    English literature of the eighteenth century was characterized by the  development of prose. Periodical literature reached its perfection  early in the century in _The Tatler_ and _The Spectator_ of Addison  and Steele. Pamphleteers flourished throughout the period. The  homelier prose of Bunyan and Defoe gradually gave place to the more  elegant and artificial language of Samuel Johnson, who set the  standard for prose writing from 1745 onward. This century saw the  beginnings of the modern novel, in Fielding's _Tom Jones_,  Richardson's _Clarissa Harlowe_, Sterne's _Tristram Shandy_, and  Goldsmith's _Vicar of Wakefield_. Gibbon wrote _The Decline and Fall  of the Roman Empire_, Hume his _History of England_, and Adam Smith  the _Wealth of Nations_.    In the simplicity and vigor of his style Franklin more nearly  resembles the earlier group of writers. In his first essays he was not  an inferior imitator of Addison. In his numerous parables, moral  allegories, and apologues he showed Bunyan's influence. But Franklin  was essentially a journalist. In his swift, terse style, he is most  like Defoe, who was the first great English journalist and master of  the newspaper narrative. The style of both writers is marked by  homely, vigorous expression, satire, burlesque, repartee. Here the  comparison must end. Defoe and his contemporaries were authors. Their  vocation was writing and their success rests on the imaginative or  creative power they displayed. To authorship Franklin laid no claim.  He wrote no work of the imagination. He developed only incidentally a  style in many respects as remarkable as that of his English  contemporaries. He wrote the best autobiography in existence, one of  the most widely known collections of maxims, and an unsurpassed series  of political and social satires, because he was a man of unusual scope  of power and usefulness, who knew how to tell his fellow-men the  secrets of that power and that usefulness.      The Story of the Autobiography    The account of how Franklin's _Autobiography_ came to be written and  of the adventures of the original manuscript forms in itself an  interesting story. The _Autobiography_ is Franklin's longest work,  and yet it is only a fragment. The first part, written as a letter to  his son, William Franklin, was not intended for publication; and the  composition is more informal and the narrative more personal than in  the second part, from 1730 on, which was written with a view to  publication. The entire manuscript shows little evidence of revision.  In fact, the expression is so homely and natural that his grandson,  William Temple Franklin, in editing the work changed some of the  phrases because he thought them inelegant and vulgar.    Franklin began the story of his life while on a visit to his friend,  Bishop Shipley, at Twyford, in Hampshire, southern England, in 1771.  He took the manuscript, completed to 1731, with him when he returned  to Philadelphia in 1775. It was left there with his other papers when  he went to France in the following year, and disappeared during the  confusion incident to the Revolution. Twenty-three pages of closely  written manuscript fell into the hands of Abel James, an old friend,  who sent a copy to Franklin at Passy, near Paris, urging him to  complete the story. Franklin took up the work at Passy in 1784 and  carried the narrative forward a few months. He changed the plan to  meet his new purpose of writing to benefit the young reader. His work  was soon interrupted and was not resumed until 1788, when he was at  home in Philadelphia. He was now old, infirm, and suffering, and was  still engaged in public service. Under these discouraging conditions  the work progressed slowly. It finally stopped when the narrative  reached the year 1757. Copies of the manuscript were sent to friends  of Franklin in England and France, among others to Monsieur Le  Veillard at Paris.    The first edition of the _Autobiography_ was published in French at  Paris in 1791. It was clumsily and carelessly translated, and was  imperfect and unfinished. Where the translator got the manuscript is  not known. Le Veillard disclaimed any knowledge of the publication.  From this faulty French edition many others were printed, some in  Germany, two in England, and another in France, so great was the  demand for the work.    In the meantime the original manuscript of the _Autobiography_ had  started on a varied and adventurous career. It was left by Franklin  with his other works to his grandson, William Temple Franklin, whom  Franklin designated as his literary executor. When Temple Franklin  came to publish his grandfather's works in 1817, he sent the original  manuscript of the _Autobiography_ to the daughter of Le Veillard in  exchange for her father's copy,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20220"],[0,"The Mind and Its Education (#2)"],[1,"in mental economy: Practical nature of  imagination--Imagination in the interpretation of history, literature,  and art--Imagination and science--Everyday uses of imagination--The  building of ideals and plans--Imagination and conduct--Imagination and  thinking. 2.

It is easy to  understand how we may investigate the great world of material things  about us; for we can see it, touch it, weigh it, or measure it. But how  are we to discover the nature of the mind, or come to know the processes  by which consciousness works? For mind is intangible; we cannot see it,  feel it, taste it, or handle it. Mind belongs not to the realm of matter  which is known to the senses, but to the realm of _spirit_, which the  senses can never grasp. And yet the mind can be known and studied as  truly and as scientifically as can the world of matter. Let us first of  all see how this can be done.      1. HOW MIND IS TO BE KNOWN    THE PERSONAL CHARACTER OF CONSCIOUSNESS.--Mind can be observed and  known. But each one can know directly only his own mind, and not  another's. You and I may look into each other's face and there guess the  meaning that lies back of the smile or frown or flash of the eye, and  so read something of the mind's activity. But neither directly meets the  other's mind. I may learn to recognize your features, know your voice,  respond to the clasp of your hand; but the mind, the consciousness,  which does your thinking and feels your joys and sorrows, I can never  know completely. Indeed I can never know your mind at all except through  your bodily acts and expressions. Nor is there any way in which you can  reveal your mind, your spiritual self, to me except through these means.    It follows therefore that only _you_ can ever know _you_"]]]
