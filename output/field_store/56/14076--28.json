Here by the camp-fire's flicker,      Deep in my blanket curled,     I long for the peace of the pine-gloom,      When the scroll of the Lord is unfurled,     And the wind and the wave are silent,      And world is singing to world.          The Law of the Yukon           This is the law of the Yukon, and ever she makes it plain:     \"Send not your foolish and feeble; send me your strong and your sane --     Strong for the red rage of battle; sane for I harry them sore;     Send me men girt for the combat, men who are grit to the core;     Swift as the panther in triumph, fierce as the bear in defeat,     Sired of a bulldog parent, steeled in the furnace heat.     Send me the best of your breeding, lend me your chosen ones;     Them will I take to my bosom, them will I call my sons;     Them will I gild with my treasure, them will I glut with my meat;     But the others -- the misfits, the failures -- I trample under my feet.     Dissolute, damned and despairful, crippled and palsied and slain,     Ye would send me the spawn of your gutters -- Go! take back your spawn again.       \"Wild and wide are my borders, stern as death is my sway;     From my ruthless throne I have ruled alone for a million years and a day;     Hugging my mighty treasure, waiting for man to come,     Till he swept like a turbid torrent, and after him swept -- the scum.     The pallid pimp of the dead-line, the enervate of the pen,     One by one I weeded them out, for all that I sought was -- Men.     One by one I dismayed them, frighting them sore with my glooms;     One by one I betrayed them unto my manifold dooms.     Drowned them like rats in my rivers, starved them like curs on my plains,     Rotted the flesh that was left them, poisoned the blood in their veins;     Burst with my winter upon them, searing forever their sight,     Lashed them with fungus-white faces, whimpering wild in the night;       \"Staggering blind through the storm-whirl, stumbling mad through the snow,     Frozen stiff in the ice-pack, brittle and bent like a bow;     Featureless, formless, forsaken, scented by wolves in their flight,     Left for the wind to make music through ribs that are glittering white;     Gnawing the black crust of failure, searching the pit of despair,     Crooking the toe in the trigger, trying to patter a prayer;     Going outside with an escort, raving with lips all afoam,     Writing a cheque for a million, driveling feebly of home;     Lost like a louse in the burning... or else in the tented town     Seeking a drunkard's solace, sinking and sinking down;     Steeped in the slime at the bottom, dead to a decent world,     Lost 'mid the human flotsam, far on the frontier hurled;     In the camp at the bend of the river, with its dozen saloons aglare,     Its gambling dens ariot, its gramophones all ablare;     Crimped with the crimes of a city, sin-ridden and bridled with lies,     In the hush of my mountained vastness, in the flush of my midnight skies.     Plague-spots, yet tools of my purpose, so natheless I suffer them thrive,     Crushing my Weak in their clutches, that only my Strong may survive.       \"But the others, the men of my mettle, the men who would 'stablish my fame     Unto its ultimate issue, winning me honor, not shame;     Searching my uttermost valleys, fighting each step as they go,     Shooting the wrath of my rapids, scaling my ramparts of snow;     Ripping the guts of my mountains, looting the beds of my creeks,     Them will I take to my bosom, and speak as a mother speaks.     I am the land that listens, I am the land that broods;     Steeped in eternal beauty, crystalline waters and woods.     Long have I waited lonely, shunned as a thing accurst,     Monstrous, moody, pathetic, the last of the lands and the first;     Visioning camp-fires at twilight, sad with a longing forlorn,     Feeling my womb o'er-pregnant with the seed of cities unborn.     Wild and wide are my borders, stern as death is my sway,     And I wait for the men who will win me -- and I will not be won in a day;     And I will not be won by weaklings, subtle, suave and mild,     But by men with the hearts of vikings, and the simple faith of a child;     Desperate, strong and resistless, unthrottled by fear or defeat,     Them will I gild with my treasure, them will I glut with my meat.       \"Lofty I stand from each sister land, patient and wearily wise,     With the weight of a world of sadness in my quiet, passionless eyes;     Dreaming alone of a people, dreaming alone of a day,     When men shall not rape my riches, and curse me and go away;     Making a bawd of my bounty, fouling the hand that gave --     Till I rise in my wrath and I sweep on their path       and I stamp them into a grave.     Dreaming of men who will bless me, of women esteeming me good,     Of children born in my borders of radiant motherhood,     Of cities leaping to stature, of fame like a flag unfurled,     As I pour the tide of my riches in the eager lap of the world.\"       This is the Law of the Yukon, that only the Strong shall thrive;     That surely the Weak shall perish, and only the Fit survive.     Dissolute, damned and despairful, crippled and palsied and slain,     This is the Will of the Yukon, -- Lo, how she makes it plain!          The Parson's Son                _This is the song of the parson's son, as he squats in his shack alone,          On the wild, weird nights, when the Northern Lights            shoot up from the frozen zone,          And it's sixty below, and couched in the snow the hungry huskies moan:_       \"I'm one of the Arctic brotherhood, I'm an old-time pioneer.     I came with the first -- O God! how I've cursed       this Yukon -- but still I'm here.     I've sweated athirst in its summer heat, I've frozen and starved in its cold;     I've followed my dreams by its thousand streams,       I've toiled and moiled for its gold.       \"Look at my eyes -- been snow-blind twice; look where my foot's half gone;     And that gruesome scar on my left cheek,       where the frost-fiend bit to the bone.     Each one a brand of this devil's land,       where I've played and I've lost the game,     A broken wreck with a craze for `hooch', and never a cent to my name.       \"This mining is only a gamble; the worst is as good as the best;     I was in with the bunch and I might have come out right on top with the rest;     With Cormack, Ladue and Macdonald -- O God! but it's hell to think     Of the thousands and thousands I've squandered on cards and women and drink.       \"In the early days we were just a few, and we hunted and fished around,     Nor dreamt by our lonely camp-fires of the wealth that lay under the ground.     We traded in skins and whiskey, and I've often slept under the shade     Of that lone birch tree on Bonanza, where the first big find was made.       \"We were just like a great big family, and every man had his squaw,     And we lived such a wild, free, fearless life beyond the pale of the law;     Till sudden there came a whisper, and it maddened us every man,     And I got in on Bonanza before the big rush began.       \"Oh, those Dawson days, and the sin and the blaze,       and the town all open wide!     (If God made me in His likeness, sure He let the devil inside.)     But we all were mad, both the good and the bad, and as for the women, well --     No spot on the map in so short a space has hustled more souls to hell.       \"Money was just like dirt there, easy to get and to spend.     I was all caked in on a dance-hall jade, but she shook me in the end.     It put me queer, and for near a year I never drew sober breath,     Till I found myself in the bughouse ward with a claim staked out on death.       \"Twenty years in the Yukon, struggling along its creeks;     Roaming its giant valleys, scaling its god-like peaks;     Bathed in its fiery sunsets, fighting its fiendish cold --     Twenty years in the Yukon... twenty years -- and I'm old.       \"Old and weak, but no matter, there's `hooch' in the bottle still.     I'll hitch up the dogs to-morrow, and mush down the trail to Bill.     It's so long dark, and I'm lonesome -- I'll just lay down on the bed;     To-morrow I'll go... to-morrow... I guess I'll play on the red.       \"... Come, Kit, your pony is saddled.       I'm waiting, dear, in the court...    ...

And hide     them in your outfit.  If you meet anyone when your coming down into     the Tonto, listen more than you talk.  And last, son, dont let     anything keep you in Oregon.  Reckon you have a sweetheart, and     if so fetch her along.  With love from your dad,       GASTON ISBEL.      Jean pondered over this letter.  Judged by memory of his father, who  had always been self-sufficient, it had been a surprise and somewhat of  a shock.  Weeks of travel and reflection had not helped him to grasp  the meaning between the lines.    \"Yes, dad's growin' old,\" mused Jean, feeling a warmth and a sadness  stir in him.  \"He must be 'way over sixty.  But he never looked old....  So he's rich now an' losin' stock, an' goin' to be sheeped off his  range.  Dad could stand a lot of rustlin', but not much from sheepmen.\"    The softness that stirred in Jean merged into a cold, thoughtful  earnestness which had followed every perusal of his father's letter. A  dark, full current seemed flowing in his veins, and at times he felt it  swell and heat.  It troubled him, making him conscious of a deeper,  stronger self, opposed to his careless, free, and dreamy nature.  No  ties had bound him in Oregon, except love for the great, still forests  and the thundering rivers; and this love came from his softer side.  It  had cost him a wrench to leave.  And all the way by ship down the coast  to San Diego and across the Sierra Madres by stage, and so on to this  last overland travel by horseback, he had felt a retreating of the self  that was tranquil and happy and a dominating of this unknown somber  self, with its menacing possibilities.  Yet despite a nameless regret  and a loyalty to Oregon, when he lay in his blankets he had to confess  a keen interest in his adventurous future, a keen enjoyment of this  stark, wild Arizona.  It appeared to be a different sky stretching in  dark, star-spangled dome over him--closer, vaster, bluer.  The strong  fragrance of sage and cedar floated over him with the camp-fire smoke,  and all seemed drowsily to subdue his thoughts.    At dawn he rolled out of his blankets and, pulling on his boots, began  the day with a zest for the work that must bring closer his calling  future.  White, crackling frost and cold, nipping air were the same  keen spurs to action that he had known in the uplands of Oregon, yet  they were not wholly the same.  He sensed an exhilaration similar to  the effect of a strong, sweet wine.  His horse and mule had fared well  during the night, having been much refreshed by the grass and water of  the little canyon.  Jean mounted and rode into the cedars with gladness  that at last he had put the endless leagues of barren land behind him.    The trail he followed appeared to be seldom traveled.  It led,  according to the meager information obtainable at the last settlement,  directly to what was called the Rim, and from there Grass Valley could  be seen down in the Basin.  The ascent of the ground was so gradual  that only in long, open stretches could it be seen.  But the nature of  the vegetation showed Jean how he was climbing.  Scant, low, scraggy  cedars gave place to more numerous, darker, greener, bushier ones, and  these to high, full-foliaged, green-berried trees.  Sage and grass in  the open flats grew more luxuriously.  Then came the pinyons, and  presently among them the checker-barked junipers.  Jean hailed the  first pine tree with a hearty slap on the brown, rugged bark.  It was a  small dwarf pine struggling to live.  The next one was larger, and  after that came several, and beyond them pines stood up everywhere  above the lower trees.  Odor of pine needles mingled with the other dry  smells that made the wind pleasant to Jean.  In an hour from the first  line of pines he had ridden beyond the cedars and pinyons into a slowly  thickening and deepening forest.  Underbrush appeared scarce except in  ravines, and the ground in open patches held a bleached grass. Jean's  eye roved for sight of squirrels, birds, deer, or any moving creature.  It appeared to be a dry, uninhabited forest.  About midday Jean halted  at a pond of surface water, evidently melted snow, and gave his animals  a drink.  He saw a few old deer tracks in the mud and several huge bird  tracks new to him which he concluded must have been made by wild  turkeys.    The trail divided at this pond.  Jean had no idea which branch he ought  to take.  \"Reckon it doesn't matter,\" he muttered, as he was about to  remount.  His horse was standing with ears up, looking back along the  trail.  Then Jean heard a clip-clop of trotting hoofs, and presently  espied a horseman.    Jean made a pretense of tightening his saddle girths while he peered  over his horse at the approaching rider.  All men in this country were  going to be of exceeding interest to Jean Isbel.  This man at a  distance rode and looked like all the Arizonians Jean had seen, he had  a superb seat in the saddle, and he was long and lean.  He wore a huge  black sombrero and a soiled red scarf.  His vest was open and he was  without a coat.    The rider came trotting up and halted several paces from Jean    \"Hullo, stranger!\" he said, gruffly.    \"Howdy yourself!\" replied Jean.  He felt an instinctive importance in  the meeting with the man.  Never had sharper eyes flashed over Jean and  his outfit.  He had a dust-colored, sun-burned face, long, lean, and  hard, a huge sandy mustache that hid his mouth, and eyes of piercing  light intensity.  Not very much hard Western experience had passed by  this man, yet he was not old, measured by years. When he dismounted  Jean saw he was tall, even for an Arizonian.    \"Seen your tracks back a ways,\" he said, as he slipped the bit to let  his horse drink.  \"Where bound?\"    \"Reckon I'm lost, all right,\" replied Jean.  \"New country for me.\"    \"Shore.  I seen thet from your tracks an' your last camp.  Wal, where  was you headin' for before you got lost?\"    The query was deliberately cool, with a dry, crisp ring.  Jean felt the  lack of friendliness or kindliness in it.    \"Grass Valley.  My name's Isbel,\" he replied, shortly.    The rider attended to his drinking horse and presently rebridled him;  then with long swing of leg he appeared to step into the saddle.    \"Shore I knowed you was Jean Isbel,\" he said.  \"Everybody in the Tonto  has heerd old Gass Isbel sent fer his boy.\"    \"Well then, why did you ask?\" inquired Jean, bluntly.    \"Reckon I wanted to see what you'd say.\"    \"So?  All right.  But I'm not carin' very much for what YOU say.\"    Their glances locked steadily then and each measured the other by the  intangible conflict of spirit.    \"Shore thet's natural,\" replied the rider.  His speech was slow, and  the motions of his long, brown hands, as he took a cigarette from his  vest, kept time with his words.  \"But seein' you're one of the Isbels,  I'll hev my say whether you want it or not.  My name's Colter an' I'm  one of the sheepmen Gass Isbel's riled with.\"    \"Colter.  Glad to meet you,\" replied Jean.  \"An' I reckon who riled my  father is goin' to rile me.\"    \"Shore.  If thet wasn't so you'd not be an Isbel,\" returned Colter,  with a grim little laugh.  \"It's easy to see you ain't run into any  Tonto Basin fellers yet.  Wal, I'm goin' to tell you thet your old man  gabbed like a woman down at Greaves's store.  Bragged aboot you an' how  you could fight an' how you could shoot an' how you could track a hoss  or a man!  Bragged how you'd chase every sheep herder back up on the  Rim.... I'm tellin' you because we want you to git our stand right.  We're goin' to run sheep down in Grass Valley.\"    \"Ahuh!  Well, who's we?\" queried Jean, curtly.    \"What-at? ... We--I mean the sheepmen rangin' this Rim from Black Butte  to the Apache country.\"    \"Colter, I'm a stranger in Arizona,\" said Jean, slowly.  \"I know little  about ranchers or sheepmen.  It's true my father sent for me.  It's  true, I dare say, that he bragged, for he was given to bluster an'  blow. An' he's old now.  I can't help it if he bragged about me.  But  if he has, an' if he's justified in his stand against you sheepmen, I'm  goin' to do my best to live up to his brag.\"    \"I get your hunch.  Shore we understand each other, an' thet's a  powerful help.  You take my hunch to your old man,\" replied Colter, as  he turned his horse away toward the left.  \"Thet trail leadin' south is  yours.  When you come to the Rim you'll see a bare spot down in the  Basin.  Thet 'll be Grass Valley.\"    He rode away out of sight into the woods.  Jean leaned against his  horse and pondered.  It seemed difficult to be just to this Colter, not  because of his claims, but because of a subtle hostility that emanated  from him.  Colter had the hard face, the masked intent, the turn of  speech that Jean had come to associate with dishonest men. Even if Jean  had not been prejudiced, if he had known nothing of his father's  trouble with these sheepmen, and if Colter had met him only to exchange  glances and greetings, still Jean would never have had a favorable  impression.  Colter grated upon him, roused an antagonism seldom felt.    \"Heigho!\" sighed the young man, \"Good-by to huntin' an' fishing'! Dad's  given me a man's job.\"    With that he mounted his horse and started the pack mule into the  right-hand trail.  Walking and trotting, he traveled all afternoon,  toward sunset getting into heavy forest of pine.  More than one snow  bank showed white through the green, sheltered on the north slopes of  shady ravines.  And it was upon entering this zone of richer, deeper  forestland that Jean sloughed off his gloomy forebodings.  These  stately pines were not the giant firs of Oregon, but any lover of the  woods could be happy under them.  Higher still he climbed until the  forest spread before and around him like a level park, with thicketed  ravines here and there"]]]
