More puzzled  than ever I retraced my steps to Kensington. I had not been in my study  five minutes when the maid entered to say that a person desired to  see me. To my astonishment it was none other than my strange old  book-collector, his sharp, wizened face peering out from a frame of  white hair, and his precious volumes, a dozen of them at least, wedged  under his right arm.    \"You're surprised to see me, sir,\" said he, in a strange, croaking  voice.    I acknowledged that I was.    \"Well, I've a conscience, sir, and when I chanced to see you go into  this house, as I came hobbling after you, I thought to myself, I'll just  step in and see that kind gentleman, and tell him that if I was a bit  gruff in my manner there was not any harm meant, and that I am much  obliged to him for picking up my books.\"    \"You make too much of a trifle,\" said I. \"May I ask how you knew who I  was?\"    \"Well, sir, if it isn't too great a liberty, I am a neighbour of yours,  for you'll find my little bookshop at the corner of Church Street,  and very happy to see you, I am sure. Maybe you collect yourself, sir;  here's 'British Birds,' and 'Catullus,' and 'The Holy War'--a bargain  every one of them. With five volumes you could just fill that gap on  that second shelf. It looks untidy, does it not, sir?\"    I moved my head to look at the cabinet behind me. When I turned again  Sherlock Holmes was standing smiling at me across my study table. I rose  to my feet, stared at him for some seconds in utter amazement, and then  it appears that I must have fainted for the first and the last time  in my life. Certainly a grey mist swirled before my eyes, and when it  cleared I found my collar-ends undone and the tingling after-taste of  brandy upon my lips. Holmes was bending over my chair, his flask in his  hand.    \"My dear Watson,\" said the well-remembered voice, \"I owe you a thousand  apologies. I had no idea that you would be so affected.\"    I gripped him by the arm.    \"Holmes!\" I cried. \"Is it really you? Can it indeed be that you are  alive? Is it possible that you succeeded in climbing out of that awful  abyss?\"    \"Wait a moment,\" said he. \"Are you sure that you are really fit to  discuss things? I have given you a serious shock by my unnecessarily  dramatic reappearance.\"    \"I am all right, but indeed, Holmes, I can hardly believe my eyes. Good  heavens, to think that you--you of all men--should be standing in my  study!\" Again I gripped him by the sleeve and felt the thin, sinewy arm  beneath it. \"Well, you're not a spirit, anyhow,\" said I. \"My dear chap,  I am overjoyed to see you. Sit down and tell me how you came alive out  of that dreadful chasm.\"    He sat opposite to me and lit a cigarette in his old nonchalant manner.  He was dressed in the seedy frock-coat of the book merchant, but the  rest of that individual lay in a pile of white hair and old books upon  the table. Holmes looked even thinner and keener than of old, but there  was a dead-white tinge in his aquiline face which told me that his life  recently had not been a healthy one.    \"I am glad to stretch myself, Watson,\" said he. \"It is no joke when a  tall man has to take a foot off his stature for several hours on end.  Now, my dear fellow, in the matter of these explanations we have, if  I may ask for your co-operation, a hard and dangerous night's work in  front of us. Perhaps it would be better if I gave you an account of the  whole situation when that work is finished.\"    \"I am full of curiosity. I should much prefer to hear now.\"    \"You'll come with me to-night?\"    \"When you like and where you like.\"    \"This is indeed like the old days. We shall have time for a mouthful of  dinner before we need go. Well, then, about that chasm. I had no serious  difficulty in getting out of it, for the very simple reason that I never  was in it.\"    \"You never were in it?\"    \"No, Watson, I never was in it. My note to you was absolutely genuine.  I had little doubt that I had come to the end of my career when I  perceived the somewhat sinister figure of the late Professor Moriarty  standing upon the narrow pathway which led to safety. I read an  inexorable purpose in his grey eyes. I exchanged some remarks with him,  therefore, and obtained his courteous permission to write the short note  which you afterwards received. I left it with my cigarette-box and my  stick and I walked along the pathway, Moriarty still at my heels. When  I reached the end I stood at bay. He drew no weapon, but he rushed at me  and threw his long arms around me. He knew that his own game was up, and  was only anxious to revenge himself upon me. We tottered together upon  the brink of the fall. I have some knowledge, however, of baritsu, or  the Japanese system of wrestling, which has more than once been very  useful to me. I slipped through his grip, and he with a horrible scream  kicked madly for a few seconds and clawed the air with both his hands.  But for all his efforts he could not get his balance, and over he went.  With my face over the brink I saw him fall for a long way. Then he  struck a rock, bounded off, and splashed into the water.\"    I listened with amazement to this explanation, which Holmes delivered  between the puffs of his cigarette.    \"But the tracks!\" I cried. \"I saw with my own eyes that two went down  the path and none returned.\"    \"It came about in this way. The instant that the Professor had  disappeared it struck me what a really extraordinarily lucky chance Fate  had placed in my way. I knew that Moriarty was not the only man who  had sworn my death. There were at least three others whose desire for  vengeance upon me would only be increased by the death of their leader.  They were all most dangerous men. One or other would certainly get me.  On the other hand, if all the world was convinced that I was dead they  would take liberties, these men, they would lay themselves open, and  sooner or later I could destroy them. Then it would be time for me to  announce that I was still in the land of the living. So rapidly does  the brain act that I believe I had thought this all out before Professor  Moriarty had reached the bottom of the Reichenbach Fall.    \"I stood up and examined the rocky wall behind me. In your picturesque  account of the matter, which I read with great interest some months  later, you assert that the wall was sheer. This was not literally  true. A few small footholds presented themselves, and there was some  indication of a ledge. The cliff is so high that to climb it all was  an obvious impossibility, and it was equally impossible to make my way  along the wet path without leaving some tracks. I might, it is true,  have reversed my boots, as I have done on similar occasions, but the  sight of three sets of tracks in one direction would certainly have  suggested a deception. On the whole, then, it was best that I should  risk the climb. It was not a pleasant business, Watson. The fall roared  beneath me. I am not a fanciful person, but I give you my word that  I seemed to hear Moriarty's voice screaming at me out of the abyss. A  mistake would have been fatal. More than once, as tufts of grass came  out in my hand or my foot slipped in the wet notches of the rock, I  thought that I was gone. But I struggled upwards, and at last I reached  a ledge several feet deep and covered with soft green moss, where I  could lie unseen in the most perfect comfort. There I was stretched when  you, my dear Watson, and all your following were investigating in the  most sympathetic and inefficient manner the circumstances of my death.    \"At last, when you had all formed your inevitable and totally erroneous  conclusions, you departed for the hotel and I was left alone. I had  imagined that I had reached the end of my adventures, but a very  unexpected occurrence showed me that there were surprises still in store  for me. A huge rock, falling from above, boomed past me, struck the  path, and bounded over into the chasm. For an instant I thought that  it was an accident; but a moment later, looking up, I saw a man's head  against the darkening sky, and another stone struck the very ledge upon  which I was stretched, within a foot of my head. Of course, the meaning  of this was obvious. Moriarty had not been alone. A confederate--and  even that one glance had told me how dangerous a man that confederate  was--had kept guard while the Professor had attacked me. From a  distance, unseen by me, he had been a witness of his friend's death and  of my escape. He had waited, and then, making his way round to the  top of the cliff, he had endeavoured to succeed where his comrade had  failed.    \"I did not take long to think about it, Watson. Again I saw that grim  face look over the cliff, and I knew that it was the precursor of  another stone. I scrambled down on to the path. I don't think I could  have done it in cold blood. It was a hundred times more difficult than  getting up. But I had no time to think of the danger, for another stone  sang past me as I hung by my hands from the edge of the ledge. Halfway  down I slipped, but by the blessing of God I landed, torn and bleeding,  upon the path. I took to my heels, did ten miles over the mountains  in the darkness, and a week later I found myself in Florence with the  certainty that no one in the world knew what had become of me.    \"I had only one confidant--my brother Mycroft. I owe you many apologies,  my dear Watson, but it was all-important that it should be thought I  was dead, and it is quite certain that you would not have written so  convincing an account of my unhappy end had you not yourself thought  that it was true. Several times during the last three years I have taken  up my pen to write to you, but"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22101"],[0,"Wood Folk at School (#2)"],[1,"the little things after they had looked at him just once  like that.    When I rose at last, after petting them to my heart's content, they  staggered up to their feet and came out of their house. Their mother had  told them to stay; but here was another big, kind animal, evidently,  whom they might safely trust. \"Take the gifts the gods provide thee\" was  the thought in their little heads; and the salty taste in their tongues'  ends, when they licked my hand, was the nicest thing they had ever  known. As I turned away they ran after me, with a plaintive little cry  to bring me back. When I stopped they came close, nestling against me,  one on either side, and lifted their heads to be petted and rubbed  again.    Standing so, all eagerness and wonder, they were a perfect study in  first impressions of the world. Their ears had already caught the deer  trick of twitching nervously and making trumpets at every sound. A leaf  rustled, a twig broke, the brook's song swelled as a floating stick  jammed in the current, and instantly the fawns were all alert. Eyes,  ears, noses questioned the phenomenon. Then they would raise their eyes  slowly to mine. \"This is a wonderful world. This big wood is full of  music. We know so little; please tell us all about it,\"--that is what  the beautiful eyes were saying as they lifted up to mine, full of  innocence and delight at the joy of living. Then the hands that rested  fondly, one on either soft neck, moved down from their ears with a  caressing sweep and brought up under their moist muzzles. Instantly the  wood and its music vanished; the questions ran away out of their eyes.  Their eager tongues were out, and all the unknown sounds were forgotten  in the new sensation of lapping a man's palm, which had a wonderful  taste hidden somewhere under its friendly roughnesses. They were still  licking my hands, nestling close against me, when a twig snapped faintly  far behind us.    Now, twig snapping is the great index to all that passes in the  wilderness. Curiously enough, no two animals can break even a twig under  their feet and give the same warning. The _crack_ under a bear's foot,  except when he is stalking his game, is heavy and heedless. The hoof of  a moose crushes a twig, and chokes the sound of it before it can tell  its message fairly. When a twig speaks under a deer in his passage  through the woods, the sound is sharp, dainty, alert. It suggests the  _plop_ of a raindrop into the lake. And the sound behind us now could  not be mistaken. The mother of my little innocents was coming.    I hated to frighten her, and through her to destroy their new  confidence; so I hurried back to the den, the little ones running close  by my side. Ere I was halfway, a twig snapped sharply again; there was a  swift rustle in the underbrush, and a doe sprang out with a low bleat as  she saw the home log.    At sight of me she stopped short, trembling violently, her ears pointing  forward like two accusing fingers, an awful fear in her soft eyes as she  saw her little ones with her archenemy between them, his hands resting  on their innocent necks. Her body swayed away, every muscle tense for  the jump; but her feet seemed rooted to the spot. Slowly she swayed back  to her balance, her eyes holding mine; then away again as the danger  scent poured into her nose. But still the feet stayed. She could not  move; could not believe. Then, as I waited quietly and tried to make my  eyes say all sorts of friendly things, the harsh, throaty _K-a-a-a-h!  k-a-a-a-h!_ the danger cry of the deer, burst like a trumpet blast  through the woods, and she leaped back to cover.    At the sound the little ones jumped as if stung, and plunged into the  brush in the opposite direction. But the strange place frightened them;  the hoarse cry that went crashing through the startled woods filled them  with nameless dread. In a moment they were back again, nestling close  against me, growing quiet as the hands stroked their sides without  tremor or hurry.    Around us, out of sight, ran the fear-haunted mother, calling, calling;  now showing her head, with the terror deep in her eyes; now dashing  away, with her white flag up, to show her little ones the way they must  take. But the fawns gave no heed after the first alarm. They felt the  change; their ears were twitching nervously, and their eyes, which had  not yet grown quick enough to measure distances and find their mother in  her hiding, were full of strange terror as they questioned mine. Still,  under the alarm, they felt the kindness which the poor mother,  dog-driven and waylaid by guns, had never known. Therefore they stayed,  with a deep wisdom beyond all her cunning, where they knew they were  safe.    I led them slowly back to their hiding place, gave them a last lick at  my hands, and pushed them gently under the hemlock curtain. When they  tried to come out I pushed them back again. \"Stay there, and mind your  mother; stay there, and follow your mother,\" I kept whispering. And to  this day I have a half belief that they understood, not the word but  the feeling behind it; for they grew quiet after a time and looked out  with wide-open, wondering eyes. Then I dodged out of sight, jumped the  fallen log to throw them off the scent should they come out, crossed the  brook, and glided out of sight into the underbrush. Once safely out of  hearing I headed straight for the open, a few yards away, where the  blasted stems of the burned hillside showed faintly through the green of  the big woods, and climbed, and looked, and changed my position, till at  last I could see the fallen tree under whose roots my little innocents  were hiding.    The hoarse danger cry had ceased; the woods were all still again. A  movement in the underbrush, and I saw the doe glide out beyond the brook  and stand looking, listening. She bleated softly; the hemlock curtain  was thrust aside, and the little ones came out. At sight of them she  leaped forward, a great gladness showing eloquently in every line of her  graceful body, rushed up to them, dropped her head and ran her keen nose  over them, ears to tail and down their sides and back again, to be sure  that they were her own little ones and were not harmed. All the while  the fawns nestled close to her, as they had done a moment before to me,  and lifted their heads to touch her sides with their noses, and ask in  their own dumb way what it was all about, and why she had run away.    [Illustration: \"THE WHITE FLAG SHOWING LIKE A BEACON LIGHT AS SHE JUMPED  AWAY\"]    Then, as the smell of the man came to her from the tainted underbrush,  the absolute necessity of teaching them their neglected second lesson  before another danger should find them swept over her in a flood. She  sprang aside with a great bound, and the hoarse _K-a-a-a-h! k-a-a-a-h!_  crashed through the woods again. Her tail was straight up, the white  flag showing like a beacon light as she jumped away. Behind her the  fawns stood startled a moment, trembling with a new wonder. Then their  flags went up too, and they wabbled away on slender legs through the  tangles and over the rough places of the wood, bravely following their  leader. And I, watching from my hiding, with a vague regret that they  could never again be mine, not even for a moment, saw only the crinkling  lines of underbrush and here and there the flash of a little white flag.  So they went up the hill and out of sight.    First, lie still; and second, follow the white flag. When I saw them  again it needed no danger cry of the mother to remind them of these two  things that every fawn must know who would live to grow up in the big  woods.    [Illustration]          A Cry in the Night    [Illustration]      This is the rest of the story, just as I saw it, of the little fawns  that I found under the mossy log by the brook. There were two of them,  you remember; and though they looked alike at first glance, I soon found  out that there is just as much difference in fawns as there is in folks.  Eyes, faces, dispositions, characters,--in all things they were as  unlike as the virgins of the parable. One of them was wise, and the  other was very foolish. The one was a follower, a learner; he never  forgot his second lesson, to follow the white flag. The other followed  from the first only his own willful head and feet, and discovered too  late that obedience is life. Until the bear found him, I have no doubt  he was thinking, in his own dumb, foolish way, that obedience is only  for the weak and ignorant, and that government is only an unfair  advantage which all the wilderness mothers take to keep little wild  things from doing as they please.    The wise old mother took them both away when she knew I had found them,  and hid them in a deeper solitude of the big woods, nearer the lake,  where she could the sooner reach them from her feeding grounds. For days  after the wonderful discovery I used to go in the early morning or the  late afternoon, while mother deer are away feeding along the  watercourses, and search the dingle from one end to the other, hoping to  find the little ones again and win their confidence. But they were not  there; and I took to watching instead a family of mink that lived in a  den under a root, and a big owl that always slept in the same hemlock.  Then, one day when a flock of partridges led me out of the wild berry  bushes into a cool green island of the burned lands, I ran plump upon  the deer and her fawns lying all together under a fallen treetop, dozing  away the heat of the day.    They did not see me, but were only scared into action as a branch, upon  which I stood looking for my partridges, gave way beneath my feet and  let me down with a great crash under the fallen tree. There, looking  out, I could see them perfectly, while Kookooskoos himself could hardly  have seen me. At the first crack they all jumped like Jack-in-a-box  when you touch his"]]]
