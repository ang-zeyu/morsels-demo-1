Howes  Royal College of Science,  South Kensington;  November 30, 1892.        -Preface_    No method of studying-- more especially when the objects of study  are tangible things-- can rival that prosecuted under the direction and  in the constant presence of a teacher who has also a living and vivid  knowledge of the matter which he handles with the student. In the  ideal world there is a plentiful supply of such teachers, and easy  access to their teaching, but in this real world only a favoured few  enjoy these advantages. Through causes that cannot be discussed  here, a vast number of solitary workers are scattered through the  country, to whom sustained help in this form is impossible, or  possible only in days stolen from a needed vacation; and to such  students especially does this book appeal, as well as to those more  fortunate learners who are within reach of orderly instruction, but  anxious to save their teachers' patience and their own time by some  preliminary work.    One of the most manifest disadvantages of book-work, under the  conditions of the solitary worker, is the rigidity of its expressions; if  the exact meaning is doubtful, he can not ask a question. This has  been kept in view throughout; the writer has, above all, sought to be  explicit-- has, saving over-sights, used no uncommon or technical  term without a definition or a clear indication of its meaning.    In this study of Biology, the perception and memory of form is a very  important factor indeed. Every student should draw sketches of his  dissections, and accustom himself to copying book diagrams, in  order to train his eye to perception of details he might otherwise  disregard. The drawing required is within the reach of all; but for  those who are very inexperienced, tracing figures is a useful  preliminary exercise.    By the time the student has read the \"Circulation of the Rabbit\"  (Sections 34 to 49), he will be ready to begin dissection. It is  possible to hunt to death even such a sound educational maxim as  the \"thing before the name,\" and we are persuaded, by a  considerable experience, that dissection before some such  preparatory reading is altogether a mistake. At the end of the book  is a syllabus (with suggestions) for practical work, originally drawn  up by the writer for his own private use with the evening classes of  the University Tutorial College-- classes of students working mainly  in their spare time for the London examination, and at an enormous  disadvantage, as regards the number of hours available, in  comparison with the leisurely students of a University laboratory.  This syllabus may, perhaps by itself, serve a useful purpose in some  cases, but in this essential part of the study the presence of some  experienced overlooker to advise, warn, and correct, is at first almost  indispensable.    A few words may, perhaps be said with respect to the design of this  volume. It is manifestly modelled upon the syllabus of the  Intermediate Examination in Science of London University. That  syllabus, as at present constituted, appears to me to afford  considerable scope for fairly efficient biological study. The four types  dealt with in this book are extremely convenient for developing the  methods of comparative anatomy and morphological embryology.  Without any extensive reference to related organisms, these four  forms, and especially the three vertebrata, may be made to explain  and illustrate one another in a way that cannot fail to be educational  in the truest sense. After dealing with the rabbit, therefore, as an  organic mechanism, our sections upon the frog and dog-fish, and  upon development, are simply statements of differences, and a  commentary, as it were, upon the anatomy of the mammalian type.  In the concluding chapter, a few suggestions of the most elementary  ideas of it is hoped to make this first part of our biological course  complete in itself, and of some real and permanent value to the  student. And the writer is convinced that not only is a constant  insistence upon resemblances and differences, and their import,  intellectually the most valuable, but also the most interesting, and  therefore the easiest, way of studying animal anatomy. That chaotic  and breathless cramming of terms misunderstood, tabulated  statements, formulated \"tips,\" and lists of names, in which so many  students, in spite of advice, waste their youth is, I sincerely hope, as  impossible with this book as it is useless for the purposes of a  London candidate. On the other hand, our chief endeavour has been  to render the matter of the book clear, connected, progressive, and  easily assimilable. In the second part Plants, Unicellular Organisms,  and Invertebrata will be dealt with, in a wider and less detailed view  of the entire biological province.       {Lines from First Edition only.}     -In this volume, we study four organisms, and chiefly in their     relation to each other; in the next, we shall study a number of     organisms largely in relation to their environment. In this part     our key note is the evidence of inheritance; in our second part     it will be of adaptation to circumstances.-    This book will speedily, under the scrutiny of the critical reader,  reveal abundant weakness. For these the author claims the full  credit. For whatever merit it may posses, he must however,  acknowledge his profound indebtedness to his former teacher,  Professor Howes. Not only has the writer enjoyed in the past the  privilege of Professor Howes' instruction and example, but he has,  during the preparation of this work, received the readiest help,  advise, and encouragement from him-- assistance as generous as it  was unmerited, and as unaffected as it was valuable.       {Lines from Second Edition only.}     [The publication of a second and revised edition of this Part affords     the author an opportunity of expressing his sense of the general     kindliness of his reviewers, and the help they have him in improving     this maiden effort. To no one is there vouchsafed such a facility in     the discovery of errors in a book as to its author, so soon as it has     passed beyond his power of correction. Hence the general tone of     encouragement (and in some cases the decided approval) of the     members of this termination to a period of considerable remorse and     apprehension.]    I have been able through their counsel, and the experience I have had  while using this book in teaching, to correct several printer's errors  and to alter various ambiguous or misleading expressions, as well as  to bring the book up to date again in one or two particulars.    My thanks are particularly due to my friend Miss Robbins, who has  very kindly redrawn the occasionally rather blottesque figures of the  first edition. Not only have these plates gained immensely in grace  and accuracy, but the lettering is now distinct-- an improvement that  any student who has had to hunt my reference letters in the first  edition will at once appreciate.    H. G. Wells  November, 1892. {First Edition.}  December, 1893. {Second Edition.}        -The Rabbit._    1. _External Form and General Considerations._    Section 1. It is unnecessary to enter upon a description of the  appearance of this familiar type, but it is not perhaps superfluous, as  we proceed to consider its anatomy, to call attention to one or two  points in its external, or externally apparent structure. Most of our  readers know that it belongs to that one of two primary animal  divisions which is called the vertebrata, and that the distinctive  feature which place it in this division is the possession of a spinal  column or backbone, really a series of small ring-like bones, the  vertebrae (Figure 1 v.b.) strung together, as it were, on the main  nerve axis, the spinal cord (Figure 1 s.c.). This spinal column can be  felt along the neck and back to the tail. This tail is small, tilted up,  and conspicuously white beneath, and it serves as a \"recognition  mark\" to guide the young when, during feeding, an alarm is given  and a bolt is made for the burrows. In those more primitive (older and  simpler-fashioned) vertebrata, the fishes, the tail is much large and  far more important, as compared with the rest of the body, than it is  in most of the air-inhabiting vertebrates. In the former it is invariably a  great muscular mass to propel the body forward; in the latter it may  disappear, as in the frog, be simply a feather-bearing stump, as in  the pigeon, a fly flicker, as in the cow or horse, a fur cape in squirrel,  or be otherwise reduced and modified to meet special requirements.      Section 2. At the fore end, or as English zoologists prefer to say,  anterior end, of the vertebral column of the rabbit, is of course the  skull, containing the anterior portion of the nerve axis, the brain  (Figure 1 br.). Between the head and what is called \"the body,\" in  the more restricted sense of the word, is the neck. The neck gives  freedom of movement to the head, enables the animal to look this  way and that, to turn its ears about to determine the direction of a  sound, and to perform endless motions in connexion with biting and  so forth easily. We may note that in types which swim through the  water, the neck dose not appear-- in the fish and frog, for instance--  and the head simply widens out as one passes back to the body.  The high resistance offered by water necessitates this tendency to a  cigar or ship outline, just as it has determined the cigar shape of the  ordinary fish torpedo.      Section 3. In the body of the rabbit, as examined from the outside,  we can make out by feeling two distinct regions, just as we might in  the body of a man; anteriorily a bony cage, having the ribs at the  sides, a rod-like bone in the front, the sternum (Figure 1 -st.-, [stm.]),  and the backbone behind,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21783"],[0,"A Manual of Pronunciation (#2)"],[1,"          like ng  +n+, nasal tone (as in French) of the preceding vowel, as in encore  ([:a]+n+´k[+o]r´)  ' (for voice glide), as in often ([)o]f´'n)          EXPLANATIONS      The authorities quoted and the abbreviations representing them are as  follows:    _Wb._ Webster's International Dictionary, 1890, with Supplement.  _Wr._ Worcester, 1859, with Supplement, 1882.  _St._ The Standard Dictionary.  _C._  The Century Dictionary.  _M._  The New English Dictionary, by Murray, now in preparation.
