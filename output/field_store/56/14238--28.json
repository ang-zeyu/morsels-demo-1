[Illustration: MAP OF THE BOER REPUBLICS.]    [Illustration: GENERAL MAP OF BRITISH SOUTH AFRICA]                        SOUTH AFRICA AND THE TRANSVAAL WAR          INTRODUCTION      The Transvaal War--like a gigantic picture--cannot be considered at  close quarters. To fully appreciate the situation, and all that it  embraces, the critic must stand at a suitable distance. He must gaze  not merely with the eye of to-day, or even of the whole nineteenth  century, but with his mind educated to the strange conditions of  earlier civilisation. For in these conditions will be found the root  of the widespread mischief--the answer to many a riddle which  superficial observers have been unable to comprehend. The racial  hatred between Boer and Briton is not a thing of new growth; it has  expanded with the expansion of the Boer settlers themselves. In  fact, on the Boer side, it is the only thing independent of British  enterprise which has grown and expanded since the Dutch first set  foot in the Cape. This took place in 1652. Then, Jan Van Riebeck, of  the Dutch East India Company, first established an European  settlement, and a few years later the burghers began life as  cattle-breeders, agriculturists, and itinerant traders. These  original Cape Colonists were descendants of Dutchmen of the lower  classes, men of peasant stamp, who were joined in 1689 by a  contingent of Huguenot refugees. The Boers, or peasants, of that day  were men of fine type, a blend between the gipsy and the evangelist.  They were nomadic in their taste, lawless, and impatient of  restrictions, bigoted though devout, and inspired in all and through  all by an unconquerable love of independence. With manners they had  nothing to do, with progress still less. Isolation from the  civilised world, and contact with Bushmen, Hottentots, and Kaffirs,  kept them from advancing with the times. Their slaves outnumbered  themselves, and their treatment of these makes anything but  enlivening reading. From all accounts the Boer went about with the  Bible in one hand and the _sjambok_ in the other, instructing  himself assiduously with the Word, while asserting himself liberally  with the deed. Yet he was a first-rate sporting man, a shrewd  trafficker, and at times an energetic tiller of the soil. The early  settlements were Rondebosch, Stellenbosch, and Drakenstein, in the  valley of the Berg River. Here the Dutch community laboured, and  smoked, and married, multiplying itself with amazing rapidity, and  expanding well beyond the original limits.    Dutch domination at the Cape lasted for 143 years after the landing  of Van Riebeck, but gradually internal dissensions among the  settlers resulted in absolute revolt. Meanwhile the Dutch in Europe  had lost their political prestige, and the country was overrun by a  Prussian army commissioned to support the House of Orange. In 1793,  in a war against allied England and Holland, France gained the day,  and a Republic was set up under French protection, thereby rendering  Holland and her colonies of necessity antagonistic to Great Britain.  After this the fortunes of the Cape were fluctuating. In 1795  Admiral Elphinstone and General Craig brought about the surrender of  the colony to Great Britain. Later on it was returned to the  Batavian Republic at the Peace of Amiens, only to be afterwards  recaptured by Sir David Baird in 1806. Finally, in 1814, our claim  to the Cape and other Dutch colonies was recognised on payment of  the sum of L6,000,000 sterling.    Now for the first time began the real emigration of the British.  They settled at Bathurst, near Algoa Bay, but though their numbers  gradually swelled, they never equalled the number of the inhabitants  of Dutch origin.    At this time South Africa was an ideal place for the pioneer. The  scenery was magnificent. There were mountain gorges or kloofs,  roaring cataracts, vast plains, and verdant tracts of succulent  grasses. There was big game enough to delight the heart of a race of  Nimrods. Lions, elephants, hippopotami, rhinoceroses, antelopes, and  birds of all kinds, offered horns, hides, tusks, and feathers to the  adventurous sportsman. All these things the nomadic Boer had  hitherto freely enjoyed, plying now his rifle, now his plough, and  taking little thought for the morrow or for the moving world outside  the narrow circle of his family experiences. With the appearance of  British paramountcy at the Cape came a hint of law and order, of  progress and its accompaniment--taxation. The bare whisper of  discipline of any kind was sufficient to send the truculent Boer  trekking away to the far freedom of the veldt. Quantities of them  took to their lumbering tented waggons, drawn by long teams of oxen,  and put a safe distance between themselves and the new-comers. All  they wanted was a free home, conducted in their own gipsy  fashion--the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23731"],[0,"A Martian Odyssey (#2)"],[1," \"He was being eaten! And squealing, of course, as any one would.\"    \"Eaten! By what?\"    \"I found out later. All I could see then was a bunch of black ropy arms  tangled around what looked like, as Putz described it to you, an  ostrich. I wasn't going to interfere, naturally; if both creatures were  dangerous, I'd have one less to worry about.    \"But the bird-like thing was putting up a good battle, dealing vicious  blows with an eighteen-inch beak, between screeches. And besides, I  caught a glimpse or two of what was on the end of those arms!\" Jarvis  shuddered. \"But the clincher was when I noticed a little black bag or  case hung about the neck of the bird-thing! It was intelligent! That or  tame, I assumed. Anyway, it clinched my decision. I pulled out my  automatic and fired into what I could see of its antagonist.    \"There was a flurry of tentacles and a spurt of black corruption, and  then the thing, with a disgusting sucking noise, pulled itself and its  arms into a hole in the ground. The other let out a series of clacks,  staggered around on legs about as thick as golf sticks, and turned  suddenly to face me. I held my weapon ready, and the two of us stared at  each other.    \"The Martian wasn't a bird, really. It wasn't even bird-like, except  just at first glance. It had a beak all right, and a few feathery  appendages, but the beak wasn't really a beak. It was somewhat flexible;  I could see the tip bend slowly from side to side; it was almost like a  cross between a beak and a trunk. It had four-toed feet, and four  fingered things--hands, you'd have to call them, and a little roundish  body, and a long neck ending in a tiny head--and that beak. It stood an  inch or so taller than I, and--well, Putz saw it!\"    The engineer nodded. \"_Ja!_ I saw!\"    Jarvis continued. \"So--we stared at each other. Finally the creature  went into a series of clackings and twitterings and held out its hands  toward me, empty. I took that as a gesture of friendship.\"    \"Perhaps,\" suggested Harrison, \"it looked at that nose of yours and  thought you were its brother!\"    \"Huh! You can be funny without talking! Anyway, I put up my gun and said  'Aw, don't mention it,' or something of the sort, and the thing came  over and we were pals.    \"By that time, the sun was pretty low and I knew that I'd better build a  fire or get into my thermo-skin. I decided on the fire. I picked a spot  at the base of the Thyle cliff, where the rock could reflect a little  heat on my back. I started breaking off chunks of this desiccated  Martian vegetation, and my companion caught the idea and brought in an  armful. I reached for a match, but the Martian fished into his pouch and  brought out something that looked like a glowing coal; one touch of it,  and the fire was blazing--and you all know what a job we have starting a  fire in this atmosphere!    \"And that bag of his!\" continued the narrator. \"That was a manufactured  article, my friends; press an end and she popped open--press the middle  and she sealed so perfectly you couldn't see the line. Better than  zippers.    \"Well, we stared at the fire a while and I decided to attempt some sort  of communication with the Martian. I pointed at myself and said 'Dick';  he caught the drift immediately, stretched a bony claw at me and  repeated 'Tick.' Then I pointed at him, and he gave that whistle I  called Tweel; I can't imitate his accent. Things were going smoothly; to  emphasize the names, I repeated 'Dick,' and then, pointing at him,  'Tweel.'    \"There we stuck! He gave some clacks that sounded negative, and said  something like 'P-p-p-proot.' And that was just the beginning; I was  always 'Tick,' but as for him--part of the time he was 'Tweel,' and part  of the time he was 'P-p-p-proot,' and part of the time he was sixteen  other noises!    \"We just couldn't connect. I tried 'rock,' and I tried 'star,' and  'tree,' and 'fire,' and Lord knows what else, and try as I would, I  couldn't get a single word! Nothing was the same for two successive  minutes, and if that's a language, I'm an alchemist! Finally I gave it  up and called him Tweel, and that seemed to do.    \"But Tweel hung on to some of my words. He remembered a couple of them,  which I suppose is a great achievement if you're used to a language you  have to make up as you go along. But I couldn't get the hang of his  talk; either I missed some subtle point or we just didn't _think_  alike--and I rather believe the latter view.    \"I've other reasons for believing that. After a while I gave up the  language business, and tried mathematics. I scratched two plus two  equals four on the ground, and demonstrated it with pebbles. Again Tweel  caught the idea, and informed me that three plus three equals six. Once  more we seemed to be getting somewhere.    \"So, knowing that Tweel had at least a grammar school education, I drew  a circle for the sun, pointing first at it, and then at the last glow of  the sun. Then I sketched in Mercury, and Venus, and Mother Earth, and  Mars, and finally, pointing to Mars, I swept my hand around in a sort of  inclusive gesture to indicate that Mars was our current environment. I  was working up to putting over the idea that my home was on the earth.    \"Tweel understood my diagram all right. He poked his beak at it, and  with a great deal of trilling and clucking, he added Deimos and Phobos  to Mars, and then sketched in the earth's moon!    \"Do you see what that proves? It proves that Tweel's race uses  telescopes--that they're civilized!\"    \"Does not!\" snapped Harrison. \"The moon is visible from here as a fifth  magnitude star. They could see its revolution with the naked eye.\"    \"The moon, yes!\" said Jarvis. \"You've missed my point. Mercury isn't  visible! And Tweel knew of Mercury because he placed the Moon at the  _third_ planet, not the second. If he didn't know Mercury, he'd put the  earth second, and Mars third, instead of fourth! See?\"    \"Humph!\" said Harrison.    \"Anyway,\" proceeded Jarvis, \"I went on with my lesson. Things were going  smoothly, and it looked as if I could put the idea over. I pointed at  the earth on my diagram, and then at myself, and then, to clinch it, I  pointed to myself and then to the earth itself shining bright green  almost at the zenith.    \"Tweel set up such an excited clacking that I was certain he understood.  He jumped up and down, and suddenly he pointed at himself and then at  the sky, and then at himself and at the sky again. He pointed at his  middle and then at Arcturus, at his head and then at Spica, at his feet  and then at half a dozen stars, while I just gaped at him. Then, all of  a sudden, he gave a tremendous leap. Man, what a hop! He shot straight  up into the starlight, seventy-five feet if an inch! I saw him  silhouetted against the sky, saw him turn and come down at me head  first, and land smack on his beak like a javelin! There he stuck square  in the center of my sun-circle in the sand--a bull's eye!\"    \"Nuts!\" observed the captain. \"Plain nuts!\"    \"That's what I thought, too! I just stared at him open-mouthed while he  pulled his head out of the sand and stood up. Then I figured he'd missed  my point, and I went through the whole blamed rigamarole again, and it  ended the same way, with Tweel on his nose in the middle of my picture!\"    \"Maybe it's a religious rite,\" suggested Harrison.    \"Maybe,\" said Jarvis dubiously. \"Well, there we were. We could exchange  ideas up to a certain point, and then--blooey! Something in us was  different, unrelated; I don't doubt that Tweel thought me just as screwy  as I thought him. Our minds simply looked at the world from different  viewpoints, and perhaps his viewpoint is as true as ours. But--we  couldn't get together, that's all. Yet, in spite of all difficulties, I  _liked_ Tweel, and I have a queer certainty that he liked me.\"    \"Nuts!\" repeated the captain. \"Just daffy!\"    \"Yeah? Wait and see. A couple of times I've thought that perhaps we--\"  He paused, and then resumed his narrative. \"Anyway, I finally gave it  up, and got into my thermo-skin to sleep. The fire hadn't kept me any  too warm, but that damned sleeping bag did. Got stuffy five minutes  after I closed myself in. I opened it a little and bingo! Some  eighty-below-zero air hit my nose, and that's when I got this pleasant  little frostbite to add to the bump I acquired during the crash of my  rocket.    \"I don't know what Tweel made of my sleeping. He sat around, but when I  woke up, he was gone. I'd just crawled out of my bag, though, when I  heard some twittering, and there he came, sailing down from that  three-story Thyle cliff to alight on his beak beside me. I pointed to  myself and toward the north, and he pointed at himself and toward the  south, but when I loaded up and started away, he came along.    \"Man, how he traveled! A hundred and fifty feet at a jump, sailing  through the air stretched out like a spear, and landing on his beak. He  seemed surprised at my plodding, but after a few moments he fell in  beside me, only every few minutes he'd go into one of his leaps, and  stick his nose into the sand a block ahead of me. Then he'd come  shooting back at me; it made me nervous at first to see that beak of his  coming at me like a spear, but he always ended in the sand at my side.    \"So the two of us plugged along across the Mare Chronium. Same sort of  place as this--same crazy plants and same little green biopods growing  in the sand, or crawling out of your way. We talked--not that we  understood each other, you know, but just for company. I sang songs, and  I suspect Tweel did too; at least, some of his trillings and twitterings  had a subtle sort of rhythm.    \"Then, for variety, Tweel would display his smattering of English words.  He'd point to an outcropping and say 'rock,' and point to a pebble and  say it again; or he'd touch my arm and say 'Tick,' and then repeat it.  He seemed terrifically amused"]]]
