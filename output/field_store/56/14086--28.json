Shann cowered back, striving to make his huddled body as small as  possible. One of the Throg flyers appeared silently out of the misty  amber of the morning sky, hovering over the silent camp. The aliens were  coming in to inspect the site of their victory. And the safest place for  any Terran now was as far from the vicinity of those silent domes as he  could get. Shann's slight body was an asset as he wedged through the  narrow mouth of a cleft and so back into the cliff wall. The climb  before him he knew in part, for this was the path the wolverines had  followed on their two other escapes. A few moments of tricky scrambling  and he was out in a cuplike depression choked with brush covered with  the purplish foliage of Warlock. On the other side of that was a small  cut to a sloping hillside, giving on another valley, not as wide as that  in which the camp stood, but one well provided with cover in the way of  trees and high-growing bushes.    A light wind pushed among the trees, and twice Shann heard the harsh,  rasping call of a clak-clak--one of the bat-like leather-winged flyers  that laired in pits along the cliff walls. That present snap of two-tone  complaint suggested that the land was empty of strangers. For the  clak-claks vociferously and loudly resented encroachment on their chosen  hunting territory.    Shann hesitated. He was driven by the urge to put as much distance  between him and the landing Throg ship as he could. But to arouse the  attention of inquisitive clak-claks was asking for trouble. Perhaps it  would be best to keep on along the top of the cliff, rather than risk a  descent to take cover in the valley the flyers patrolled.    A patch of dust, sheltered by a tooth-shaped projection of rock, gave  the Terran his first proof that Taggi and his mate had preceded him, for  printed firmly there was the familiar paw mark of a wolverine. Shann  began to hope that both animals had taken to cover in the wilderness  ahead.    He licked dry lips. Having left secretly without any emergency pack, he  had no canteen, and now Shann inventoried his scant possessions--a field  kit, heavy-duty clothing, a short hooded jacket with attached mittens,  the breast marked with the Survey insignia. His belt supported a  sheathed stunner and bush knife, and seam pockets held three credit  tokens, a twist of wire intended to reinforce the latch of the wolverine  cage, a packet of bravo tablets, two identity and work cards, and a  length of cord. No rations--save the bravos--no extra charge for his  stunner. But he did have, weighing down a loop on the jacket, a small  atomic torch.    The path he followed ended abruptly in a cliff drop, and Shann made a  face at the odor rising from below, even though that scent meant he  could climb down to the valley floor here without fearing any clak-clak  attention. Chemical fumes from a mineral spring funneled against the  wall, warding off any nesting in this section.    Shann drew up the hood of his jacket and snapped the transparent face  mask into place. He must get away--then find food, water, a hiding  place. That will to live which had made Shann Lantee fight innumerable  battles in the past was in command, bracing him with a stubborn  determination.    The fumes swirled up in a smoke haze about his waist, but he strode on,  heading for the open valley and cleaner air. That sickly lavender  vegetation bordering the spring deepened in color to the normal  purple-green, and then he was in a grove of trees, their branches  pointed skyward at sharp angles to the rust-red trunks.    A small skitterer burst from moss-spotted ground covering, giving an  alarmed squeak, skimming out of sight as suddenly as it had appeared.  Shann squeezed between two trees and then paused. The trunk of the  larger was deeply scored with scratches dripping viscid gobs of sap, a  sap which was a bright froth of scarlet. Taggi had left his mark here,  and not too long ago.    The soft carpet of moss showed no paw marks, but he thought he knew the  goal of the animals--a lake down-valley. Shann was beginning to plan  now. The Throgs had not blasted the Terran camp out of existence; they  had only made sure of the death of its occupiers. Which meant they must  have some use for the installations. For the general loot of a Survey  field camp would be relatively worthless to those who picked over the  treasure of entire cities elsewhere. Why? What did the Throgs want? And  would the alien invaders continue to occupy the domes for long?    Shann did not realize what had happened to him since that shock of  ruthless attack. From early childhood, when he had been thrown on his  own to scratch a living--a borderline existence of a living--on the  Dumps of Tyr, he had had to use his wits to keep life in a scrawny and  undersized body. However, since he had been eating regularly from Survey  rations, he was not quite so scrawny any more.    His formal education was close to zero, his informal and off-center  schooling vast. And that particular toughening process which had been  working on him for years now aided in his speedy adaption to a new set  of facts, formidable ones. He was alone on a strange and perhaps hostile  world. Water, food, safe shelter, those were important now. And once  again, away from the ordered round of the camp where he had been ruled  by the desires and requirements of others, he was thinking, planning in  freedom. Later (his hand went to the butt of his stunner) perhaps later  he might just find a way of extracting an accounting from the  beetle-faces, too.    For the present, he would have to keep away from the Throgs, which meant  well away from the camp. A fleck of green showed through the amethyst  foliage before him--the lake! Shann wriggled through a last bush barrier  and stood to look out over that surface. A sleek brown head bobbed up.  Shann put fingers to his mouth and whistled. The head turned, black  button eyes regarded him, short legs began to churn water. To his  gratification the swimmer was obeying his summons.    Taggi came ashore, pausing on the fine gray sand of the verge to shake  himself vigorously. Then the wolverine came upslope at a clumsy gallop  to Shann. With an unknown feeling swelling inside him, the Terran went  down on both knees, burying both hands in the coarse brown fur, warming  to the uproarious welcome Taggi gave him.    \"Togi?\" Shann asked as if the other could answer. He gazed back to the  lake, but Taggi's mate was nowhere in sight.    The blunt head under his hand swung around, black button nose pointed  north. Shann had never been sure just how intelligent, as mankind  measured intelligence, the wolverines were. He had come to suspect that  Fadakar and the other experts had underrated them and that both beasts  understood more than they were given credit for. Now he followed an  experiment of his own, one he had had a chance to try only a few times  before and never at length. Pressing his palm flat on Taggi's head,  Shann thought of Throgs and of their attack, trying to arouse in the  animal a corresponding reaction to his own horror and anger.    And Taggi responded. A mutter became a growl, teeth gleamed--those cruel  teeth of a carnivore to whom they were weapons of aggression. Danger ...  Shann thought \"danger.\" Then he raised his hand, and the wolverine  shuffled off, heading north. The man followed.    They discovered Togi busy in a small cove where a jagged tangle of drift  made a mat dating from the last high-water period. She was finishing a  hearty breakfast, the remains of a water rat being buried thriftily  against future need after the instincts of her kind. When she was done  she came to Shann, inquiry plain to read in her eyes.    There was water here, and good hunting. But the site was too close to  the Throgs. Let one of their exploring flyers sight them, and the little  group was finished. Better cover, that's what the three fugitives must  have. Shann scowled, not at Togi, but at the landscape. He was tired and  hungry, but he must keep on going.    A stream fed into the cove from the west, a guide of sorts. With very  little knowledge of the countryside, Shann was inclined to follow that.    Overhead the sun made its usual golden haze of the sky. A flight of  vivid green streaks marked a flock of lake ducks coming for a morning  feeding. Lake duck was good eating, but Shann had no time to hunt one  now. Togi started down the bank of the stream, Taggi behind her. Either  they had caught his choice subtly through some undefined mental contact,  or they had already picked that road on their own.    Shann's attention was caught by a piece of the drift. He twisted the  length free and had his first weapon of his own manufacture, a club.  Using it to hold back a low sweeping branch, he followed the wolverines.    Within the half hour he had breakfast, too. A pair of limp skitterers,  their long hind feet lashed together with a thong of grass, hung from  his belt. They were not particularly good eating, but they were meat and  acceptable.    The three, man and wolverines, made their way up the stream to the  valley wall and through a feeder ravine into the larger space beyond.  There, where the stream was born at the foot of a falls, they made their  first camp. Judging that the morning haze would veil any smoke, Shann  built a pocket-size fire. He seared rather than roasted the skitterers  after he had made an awkward and messy business of skinning them, and  tore the meat from the delicate bones in greedy mouthfuls. The  wolverines lay side by side on the gravel, now and again raising a head  alertly to test the scent on the air, or gaze into the distance.    Taggi made a warning sound deep in the throat. Shann tossed handfuls of  sand over the dying fire."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20796"],[0,"The Colors of Space (#2)"],[1,"to his companion, in their own language,  \"Always, I regret these episodes. I have no malice against humans. I  suppose even this Vegan that we are seeking has young, and a mate, who  will regret his loss.\"    \"Then he should not have pried into Lhari matters,\" said the younger  Lhari fiercely. \"If they'd killed him right away--\"    The soaring staircase swooped up to the top level; the two Lhari stepped  off and mingled swiftly with the crowd, being lost to sight. Bart  whistled in dismay as he got off and turned toward the information desk.  A Vegan! Some poor guy from his own planet was in trouble with the  Lhari. He felt a cold, crawling chill down his insides. The Lhari had  spoken regretfully, but the way they'd speak of a fly they couldn't  manage to swat fast enough. Sooner or later you had to get down to it,  they just weren't human!    Here on Earth, nothing much could happen, of course. They wouldn't let  the Lhari hurt anyone--then Bart remembered his course in Universal Law.  The Lhari spaceport in every system, by treaty, was Lhari territory.  Once you walked beneath the lightning-flash sign, the authority of the  planet ceased to function; you might as well be on that unbelievably  remote world in another galaxy that was the Lhari home planet--that  world no human had ever seen. On a Lhari spaceport, or on a Lhari ship,  you were under the jurisdiction of Lhari law.    Tommy stepped off a moving stair and joined him. \"The ship's on time--it  reported past Luna City a few minutes ago. I'm thirsty--how about a  drink?\"    There was a refreshment stand on this level; they debated briefly  between orange juice and a drink with a Lhari name that meant simply  _cold sweet_, and finally decided to try it. The name proved  descriptive; it was very cold, very sweet and indescribably delicious.    \"Does this come from the Lhari world, I wonder?\"    \"I imagine it's synthetic,\" Bart said.    \"I suppose it won't _hurt_ us?\"    Bart laughed. \"They wouldn't serve it to us if it would. No, men and  Lhari are alike in a lot of ways. They breathe the same air. Eat about  the same food.\" Their bodies were adjusted to about the same gravity.  They had the same body chemistry--in fact, you couldn't tell Lhari blood  from human, even under a microscope. And in the terrible Orion Spaceport  wreck sixty years ago, doctors had found that blood plasma from humans  could be used for wounded Lhari, and vice versa, though it wasn't safe  to transfuse whole blood. But then, even among humans there were five  blood types.    And yet, for all their likeness, they were _different_.    Bart sipped the cold Lhari drink, seeing himself in the mirror behind  the refreshment stand; a tall teen-ager, looking older than his  seventeen years. He was lithe and well muscled from five years of sports  and acrobatics at the Space Academy, he had curling red hair and gray  eyes, and he was almost as tall as a Lhari.    _Will Dad know me? I was just a little kid when he left me here, and now  I'm grown-up._    Tommy grinned at him in the mirror. \"What are you going to do, now we've  finished our so-called education?\"    \"What do you think? Go back to Vega with Dad, by Lhari ship, and help  him run Vega Interplanet. Why else would I bother with all that  astrogation and math?\"    \"You're the lucky one, with your father owning a dozen ships! He must be  almost as rich as the Lhari.\"    Bart shook his head. \"It's not that easy. Space travel inside a system  these days is small stuff; all the real travel and shipping goes to the  Lhari ships.\"    It was a sore point with everyone. Thousands of years ago, men had  spread out from Earth--first to the planets, then to the nearer stars,  crawling in ships that could travel no faster than the speed of light.  They had even believed that was an absolute limit--that nothing in the  universe could exceed the speed of light. It took years to go from Earth  to the nearest star.    But they'd done it. From the nearer stars, they had sent out colonizing  ships all through the galaxy. Some vanished and were never heard from  again, but some made it, and in a few centuries man had spread all over  hundreds of star-systems.    And then man met the people of the Lhari.    It was a big universe, with measureless millions of stars, and plenty of  room for more than two intelligent civilizations. It wasn't surprising  that the Lhari, who had only been traveling space for a couple of  thousand years themselves, had never come across humans before. But they  had been delighted to meet another intelligent race--and it was  extremely profitable.    Because men were still held, mostly, to the planets of their own  star-systems. Ships traveling between the stars by light-drive were rare  and ruinously expensive. But the Lhari had the warp-drive, and almost  overnight the whole picture changed. By warp-drive, hundreds of times  faster than light at peak, the years-long trip between Vega and Earth,  for instance, was reduced to about three months, at a price anyone could  pay. Mankind could trade and travel all over their galaxy, but they did  it on Lhari ships. The Lhari had an absolute, unbreakable monopoly on  star travel.    \"That's what hurts,\" Tommy said. \"It wouldn't do us any good to have the  star-drive. Humans can't stand faster-than-light travel, except in  cold-sleep.\"    Bart nodded. The Lhari ships traveled at normal speeds, like the regular  planetary ships, inside each star-system. Then, at the borders of the  vast gulf of emptiness between stars, they went into warp-drive; but  first, every human on board was given the cold-sleep treatment that  placed them in suspended animation, allowing their bodies to endure the  warp-drive.    He finished his drink. The increasing bustle in the crowds below them  told him that time must be getting short. A tall, impressive-looking  Lhari strode through the crowd, followed at a respectful distance by two  Mentorians, tall, redheaded humans wearing metallic cloaks like those of  the Lhari. Tommy nudged Bart, his face bitter.    \"Look at those lousy Mentorians! How can they do it? Fawning upon the  Lhari that way, yet they're as human as we are! _Slaves_ of the Lhari!\"    Bart felt the involuntary surge of anger, instantly controlled. \"It's  not that way at all. My mother was a Mentorian, remember. She made five  cruises on a Lhari ship before she married my father.\"    Tommy sighed. \"I guess I'm just jealous--to think the Mentorians can  sign on the Lhari ship as crew, while you and I will never pilot a ship  between the stars. What did she do?\"    \"She was a mathematician. Before the Lhari met up with men, they used a  system of mathematics as clumsy as the old Roman numerals. You have to  admire them, when you realize that they learned stellar navigation with  their old system, though most ships use human math now. And of course,  you know their eyes aren't like ours. Among other things, they're  color-blind. They see everything in shades of black or white or gray.    \"So they found out that humans aboard their ships were useful. You  remember how humans, in the early days in space, used certain birds, who  were more sensitive to impure air than they were. When the birds keeled  over, they could tell it was time for humans to start looking over the  air systems! The Lhari use Mentorians to identify colors for them. And,  since Mentor was the first planet of humans that the Lhari had contact  with, they've always been closer to them.\"    Tommy looked after the two Mentorians enviously. \"The fact is, I'd ship  out with the Lhari myself if I could. Wouldn't you?\"    Bart's mouth twisted in a wry smile. \"No,\" he said. \"I could--I'm half  Mentorian, I can even speak Lhari.\"    \"Why don't you? I would.\"    \"Oh, no, you wouldn't,\" Bart said softly. \"Not even very many Mentorians  will. You see, the Lhari don't trust humans too much. In the early days,  men were always planting spies on Lhari ships, to try and steal the  secret of warp-drive. They never managed it, but nowadays the Lhari give  all the Mentorians what amounts to a brainwashing--deep hypnosis, before  and after every voyage, so that they can neither look for anything that  might threaten the Lhari monopoly of space, nor reveal it--even under a  truth drug--if they find it out.    \"You have to be pretty fanatical about space travel to go through that.  Oh, my mother could tell us a lot of things about her cruises with the  Lhari. The Lhari can't tell a diamond from a ruby, except by  spectrographic analysis, for instance. And she--\"    A high gong note sounded somewhere, touching off an explosion of warning  bells and buzzers all over the enormous building. Bart looked up.    \"The ship must be coming in to land.\"    \"I'd better check into the passenger side,\" Tommy said. He stuck out his  hand. \"Well, Bart, I guess this is where we say good-bye.\"    They shook hands, their eyes meeting for a moment in honest grief. In  some indefinable way, this parting marked the end of their boyhood.    \"Good luck, Tom. I'm going to miss you.\"    They wrung each other's hands again, hard. Then Tommy picked up his  luggage and started down a sloping ramp toward an enclosure marked TO  PASSENGER ENTRANCE.    Warning bells rang again. The glare intensified until the glow in the  sky was unendurable, but Bart looked anyhow, making out the strange  shape of the Lhari ship from the stars.    It was huge and strange, glowing with colors Bart had never seen before.  It settled down slowly, softly: enormous, silent, vibrating, glowing;  then swiftly faded to white-hot, gleaming blue, dulling down through the  visible spectrum to red. At last it was just gleaming glassy Lhari-metal  color again. High up in the ship's side a yawning gap slid open,  extruding stairsteps, and men and Lhari began to descend.    Bart ran down a ramp and surged out on the field with the crowd. His  eyes, alert for his father's tall figure, noted with"]]]
