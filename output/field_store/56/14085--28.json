From it a  footpath leads through green, well-wooded stretches to the foot of the  heights which look down imposingly upon the valley. Where the footpath  begins to go steeply and abruptly up the Alps, the heath, with its  short grass and pungent herbage, at once sends out its soft perfume to  meet the wayfarer.    One bright sunny morning in June, a tall, vigorous maiden of the  mountain region climbed up the narrow path, leading a little girl by  the hand. The youngster's cheeks were in such a glow that it showed  even through her sun-browned skin. Small wonder though! for in spite  of the heat, the little one, who was scarcely five years old, was  bundled up as if she had to brave a bitter frost. Her shape was  difficult to distinguish, for she wore two dresses, if not three, and  around her shoulders a large red cotton shawl. With her feet encased  in heavy hob-nailed boots, this hot and shapeless little person toiled  up the mountain.    The pair had been climbing for about an hour when they reached a  hamlet half-way up the great mountain named the Alm. This hamlet was  called \"Im Doerfli\" or \"The Little Village.\" It was the elder girl's  home town, and therefore she was greeted from nearly every house;  people called to her from windows and doors, and very often from the  road. But, answering questions and calls as she went by, the girl did  not loiter on her way and only stood still when she reached the end of  the hamlet. There a few cottages lay scattered about, from the  furthest of which a voice called out to her through an open door:  \"Deta, please wait one moment! I am coming with you, if you are going  further up.\"    When the girl stood still to wait, the child instantly let go her hand  and promptly sat down on the ground.    \"Are you tired, Heidi?\" Deta asked the child.    \"No, but hot,\" she replied.    \"We shall be up in an hour, if you take big steps and climb with all  your little might!\" Thus the elder girl tried to encourage her small  companion.    A stout, pleasant-looking woman stepped out of the house and joined  the two. The child had risen and wandered behind the old  acquaintances, who immediately started gossiping about their friends  in the neighborhood and the people of the hamlet generally.    \"Where are you taking the child, Deta?\" asked the newcomer. \"Is she  the child your sister left?\"    \"Yes,\" Deta assured her; \"I am taking her up to the Alm-Uncle and  there I want her to remain.\"    \"You can't really mean to take her there Deta. You must have lost your  senses, to go to him. I am sure the old man will show you the door and  won't even listen to what you say.\"    \"Why not? As he's her grandfather, it is high time he should do  something for the child. I have taken care of her until this summer  and now a good place has been offered to me. The child shall not  hinder me from accepting it, I tell you that!\"    \"It would not be so hard, if he were like other mortals. But you know  him yourself. How could he _look_ after a child, especially such a  little one? She'll never get along with him, I am sure of that!--But  tell me of your prospects.\"    \"I am going to a splendid house in Frankfurt. Last summer some people  went off to the baths and I took care of their rooms. As they got to  like me, they wanted to take me along, but I could not leave. They  have come back now and have persuaded me to go with them.\"    \"I am glad I am not the child!\" exclaimed Barbara with a shudder.  \"Nobody knows anything about the old man's life up there. He doesn't  speak to a living soul, and from one year's end to the other he keeps  away from church. People get out of his way when he appears once in a  twelve-month down here among us. We all fear him and he is really just  like a heathen or an old Indian, with those thick grey eyebrows and  that huge uncanny beard. When he wanders along the road with his  twisted stick we are all afraid to meet him alone.\"    \"That is not my fault,\" said Deta stubbornly. \"He won't do her any  harm; and if he should, he is responsible, not I.\"    \"I wish I knew what weighs on the old man's conscience. Why are his  eyes so fierce and why does he live up there all alone? Nobody ever  sees him and we hear many strange things about him. Didn't your sister  tell you anything, Deta?\"    \"Of course she did, but I shall hold my tongue. He would make me pay  for it if I didn't.\"    Barbara had long been anxious to know something about the old uncle  and why he lived apart from everybody. Nobody had a good word for him,  and when people talked about him, they did not speak openly but as if  they were afraid. She could not even explain to herself why he was  called the Alm-Uncle. He could not possibly be the uncle of all the  people in the village, but since everybody spoke of him so, she did  the same. Barbara, who had only lived in the village since her  marriage, was glad to get some information from her friend. Deta had  been bred there, but since her mother's death had gone away to earn  her livelihood.    She confidentially seized Deta's arm and said: \"I wish you would tell  me the truth about him, Deta; you know it all--people only gossip.  Tell me, what has happened to the old man to turn everybody against  him so? Did he always hate his fellow-creatures?\"    \"I cannot tell you whether he always did, and that for a very good  reason. He being sixty years old, and I only twenty-six, you can't  expect me to give you an account of his early youth. But if you'll  promise to keep it to yourself and not set all the people in Praetiggan  talking, I can tell you a good deal. My mother and he both came from  Domleschg.\"    \"How can you talk like that, Deta?\" replied Barbara in an offended  tone. \"People do not gossip much in Praetiggan, and I always can keep  things to myself, if I have to. You won't repent of having told me, I  assure you!\"    \"All right, but keep your word!\" said Deta warningly. Then she looked  around to see that the child was not so close to them as to overhear  what might be said; but the little girl was nowhere to be seen. While  the two young women had talked at such a rate, they had not noticed  her absence; quite a while must have elapsed since the little girl had  given up following her companions. Deta, standing still, looked about  her everywhere, but no one was on the path, which--except for a few  curves--was visible as far down as the village.    \"There she is! Can't you see her there?\" exclaimed Barbara, pointing  to a spot a good distance from the path. \"She is climbing up with the  goatherd Peter and his goats. I wonder why he is so late to-day. I  must say, it suits us well enough; he can look after the child while  you tell me everything without being interrupted.\"    \"It will be very easy for Peter to watch her,\" remarked Deta; \"she is  bright for her five years and keeps her eyes wide open. I have often  noticed that and I am glad for her, for it will be useful with the  uncle. He has nothing left in the whole wide world, but his cottage  and two goats!\"    \"Did he once have more?\" asked Barbara.    \"I should say so. He was heir to a large farm in Domleschg. But  setting up to play the fine gentleman, he soon lost everything with  drink and play. His parents died with grief and he himself  disappeared from these parts. After many years he came back with a  half-grown boy, his son, Tobias, that was his name, became a carpenter  and turned out to be a quiet, steady fellow. Many strange rumors went  round about the uncle and I think that was why he left Domleschg for  Doerfli. We acknowledged relationship, my mother's grandmother being a  cousin of his. We called him uncle, and because we are related on my  father's side to nearly all the people in the hamlet they too all  called him uncle. He was named 'Alm-Uncle' when he moved up to the  Alm.\"    \"But what happened to Tobias?\" asked Barbara eagerly.    \"Just wait. How can I tell you everything at once?\" exclaimed Deta.  \"Tobias was an apprentice in Mels, and when he was made master, he  came home to the village and married my sister Adelheid. They always  had been fond of each other and they lived very happily as man and  wife. But their joy was short. Two years afterwards, when Tobias was  helping to build a house, a beam fell on him and killed him. Adelheid  was thrown into a violent fever with grief and fright, and never  recovered from it. She had never been strong and had often suffered  from queer spells, when we did not know whether she was awake or  asleep. Only a few weeks after Tobias's death they buried poor  Adelheid.    \"People said that heaven had punished the uncle for his misdeeds.  After the death of his son he never spoke to a living soul. Suddenly  he moved up to the Alp, to live there at enmity with God and man.    \"My mother and I took Adelheid's little year-old baby, Heidi, to live  with us. When I went to Ragatz I took her with me; but in the spring  the family whose work I had done last year came from Frankfurt and  resolved to take me to their town-house. I am very glad to get such a  good position.\"    \"And now you want to hand over the child to this terrible old man. I  really wonder how you can do it, Deta!\" said Barbara with reproach in  her voice.    \"It seems to me I have really done enough for the child. I do not know  where else to take her, as she is too young to come with me to  Frankfurt. By the way, Barbara, where are you going? We are half-way  up the Alm already.\"    Deta shook hands with her companion and stood still while Barbara  approached the tiny, dark-brown mountain hut, which lay in a hollow a  few steps away"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20785"],[0,"Slave Narratives: A Folk History of Slavery in the United States from Interviews (#2)"],[1,"stayed on, and he marked off land for them  to farm and made arrangements with them to let them use their cabins,  and let them have mules and tools. They paid him out of their shares,  and some of them finally bought the mules and some of the land. But  about half went on off and tried to do better somewheres else.    I didn't stay with him because I was jest a boy and he didn't need me  at the house anyway.    Late in the War my Pappy belonged to a man named Sander or Zander.  Might been Alexander, but the negroes called him Mr. Sander. When  pappy got free he come and asked me to go with him, and I went along  and lived with him. He had a share-cropper deal with Mr. Sander and I  helped him work his patch. That place was just a little east of Houma,  a few miles.    When my Pappy was born his parents belonged to a Mr. Adams, so he took  Adams for his last name, and I did too, because I was his son. I don't  know where Mr. Adams lived, but I don't think my Pappy was born in  Louisiana. Alabama, maybe. I think his parents come off the boat,  because he was very black--even blacker than I am.    I lived there with my Pappy until I was about eighteen and then I  married and moved around all over Louisiana from time to time. My wife  give me twelve boys and five girls, but all my children are dead now  but five. My wife died in 1920 and I come up here to Tulsa to live.  One of my daughters takes care and looks out for me now.    I seen the old Sack P. Gee place about twenty years ago, and it was  all cut up in little places and all run down. Never would have known  it was one time a big plantation ten miles long.    I seen places going to rack and ruin all around--all the places I  lived at in Louisiana--but I'm glad I wasn't there to see Master  Sack's place go down. He was a good man and done right by all his  negroes.    Yes, Lord, my old feets have been in mighty nigh every parish in  Louisiana, and I seen some mighty pretty places, but I'll never forget  how that old Gee plantation looked when I was a boy.          Oklahoma Writers' Project  Ex-Slaves    ALICE ALEXANDER  Age 88 yrs.  Oklahoma City, Okla.      I was 88 years old the 15th of March. I was born in 1849, at Jackson  Parish, Louisiana. My mother's name was Mary Marlow, and father's  Henry Marlow.    I can't remember very much 'bout slavery 'cause I was awful small, but  I can remember that my mother's master, Colonel Threff died, and my  mother, her husband, and us three chillun was handed down to Colonel  Threff's poor kin folks. Colonel Threff owned about two or three  hundred head of niggers, and all of 'em was tributed to his poor kin.  Ooh wee! he sho' had jest a lot of them too! Master Joe Threff, one of  his poor kin, took my mother, her husband, and three of us chillun  from Louisiana to the Mississippi Line.    Down there we lived in a one-room log hut, and slept on homemade rail  bed steads with cotton, and sometimes straw, mostly straw summers and  cotton winners. I worked round the house and looked after de smaller  chillun--I mean my mother's chillun. Mostly we ate yeller meal corn  bread and sorghum malasses. I ate possums when we could get 'em, but  jest couldn't stand rabbit meat. Didn't know there was any Christmas  or holidays in dem days.    I can't 'membuh nothing 'bout no churches in slavery. I was a sinner  and loved to dance. I remembuh I was on the floor one night dancing  and I had four daughters on the floor with me and my son was playing  de music--that got me! I jest stopped and said I wouldn't cut another  step and I haven't. I'm a member of the Baptist Church and been for 25  or 30 years. I jined 'cause I wanted to be good 'cause I was an awful  sinner.    We had a overseer back on Colonel Threff's plantation and my mother  said he was the meanest man on earth. He'd jest go out in de fields  and beat dem niggers, and my mother told me one day he come out in de  field beating her sister and she jumped on him and nearly beat him  half to death and old Master come up jest in time to see it all and  fired dat overseer. Said he didn't want no man working fer him dat a  woman could whip.    After de war set us free my pappy moved us away and I stayed round  down there till I got to be a grown woman and married. You know I had  a pretty fine wedding 'cause my pappy had worked hard and commenced to  be prosperous. He had cattle, hogs, chickens and all those things like  that.    A college of dem niggers got together and packed up to leave  Louisiana. Me and my husband went with them. We had covered wagons,  and let me tell you I walked nearly all the way from Louisiana to  Oklahoma. We left in March but didn't git here till May. We came in  search of education. I got a pretty fair education down there but  didn't take care of it. We come to Oklahoma looking for de same thing  then that darkies go North looking fer now. But we got dissapointed.  What little I learned I quit taking care of it and seeing after it and  lost it all.    I love to fish. I've worked hard in my days. Washed and ironed for 30  years, and paid for dis home that way. Yes sir, dis is my home. My  mother died right here in dis house. She was 111 yeahs old. She is  been dead 'bout 20 yeahs.    I have three daughters here married, Sussie Pruitt, Bertie Shannon,  and Irene Freeman. Irene lost her husband, and he's dead now.          Oklahoma Writers' Project  Ex-Slaves    10-19-1938  1,428 words    PHOEBE BANKS  Age 78  Muskogee, Oklahoma.      In 1860, there was a little Creek Indian town of Sodom on the north  bank of the Arkansas River, in a section the Indians called Chocka  Bottoms, where Mose Perryman had a big farm or ranch for a long time  before the Civil War. That same year, on October 17, I was born on the  Perryman place, which was northwest of where I live now in Muskogee;  only in them days Fort Gibson and Okmulgee was the biggest towns  around and Muskogee hadn't shaped up yet.    My mother belonged to Mose Perryman when I was born; he was one of the  best known Creeks in the whole nation, and one of his younger  brothers, Legus Perryman, was made the big chief of the Creeks (1887)  a long time after the slaves was freed. Mother's name was Eldee; my  father's name was William McIntosh, because he belonged to a Creek  Indian family by that name. Everybody say the McIntoshes was leaders  in the Creek doings away back there in Alabama long before they come  out here.    With me, there was twelve children in our family; Daniel, Stroy,  Scott, Segal, Neil, Joe, Phillip, Mollie, Harriett, Sally and Queenie.    The Perryman slave cabins was all alike--just two-room log cabins,  with a fireplace where mother do the cooking for us children at night  after she get through working in the Master's house.    Mother was the house girl--cooking, waiting on the table, cleaning the  house, spinning the yarn, knitting some of the winter clothes, taking  care of the mistress girl, washing the clothes--yes, she was always  busy and worked mighty hard all the time, while them Indians wouldn't  hardly do nothing for themselves.    On the McIntosh plantation, my daddy said there was a big number of  slaves and lots of slave children. The slave men work in the fields,  chopping cotton, raising corn, cutting rails for the fences, building  log cabins and fireplaces. One time when father was cutting down a  tree it fell on him and after that he was only strong enough to rub  down the horses and do light work around the yard. He got to be a good  horse trainer and long time after slavery he helped to train horses  for the Free Fairs around the country, and I suppose the first money  he ever earned was made that way.    Lots of the slave owners didn't want their slaves to learn reading and  writing, but the Perrymans didn't care; they even helped the younger  slaves with that stuff. Mother said her master didn't care much what  the slaves do; he was so lazy he didn't care for nothing.    They tell me about the war times, and that's all I remember of it.  Before the War is over some of the Perryman slaves and some from the  McIntosh place fix up to run away from their masters.    My father and my uncle, Jacob Perryman, was some of the fixers. Some  of the Creek Indians had already lost a few slaves who slip off to the  North, and they take what was left down into Texas so's they couldn't  get away. Some of the other Creeks was friendly to the North and was  fixing to get away up there; that's the ones my daddy and uncle was  fixing to join, for they was afraid their masters would take up and  move to Texas before they could get away.    They call the old Creek, who was leaving for the North, \"Old Gouge\"  (Opoethleyohola). All our family join up with him, and there was lots  of Creek Indians and slaves in the outfit when they made a break for  the North. The runaways was riding ponies stolen from their masters.    When they get into the hilly country farther north in the country that  belong to the Cherokee Indians, they make camp on a big creek and  there the Rebel Indian soldiers catch up, but they was fought back.    Then long before morning lighten the sky, the men hurry and sling the  camp kettles across the pack horses, tie the littlest children to the  horses backs and get on the move farther into the mountains. They kept  moving fast as they could, but the wagons made it mighty slow in the  brush and the lowland swamps, so just about the time they ready to  ford another creek the Indian soldiers catch up and the fighting begin  all over again.    The Creek Indians and the slaves with them try to fight off them  soldiers like they did before, but they get scattered around and  separated so's they lose the battle. Lost their horses and wagons, and  the soldiers killed lots of the Creeks and Negroes, and some of the  slaves was captured and took back to their masters.    Dead all over the hills when we get away; some of the Negroes shot and  wounded so bad the"]]]
