I was looking over some rubbish, and I found it--over back. It's a field  glass.\"    \"What you got a field glass out in the dark for?\" Abel demanded.    \"I used to fool with it some when I was a little shaver,\" Ebenezer said.  He put the glass in Abel's hand. \"On the sky,\" he added.    Abel lifted the glass and turned it on the heavens. There, above the  little side lawn, the firmament had unclothed itself of branches and lay  in a glorious nakedness to three horizons.    \"Thunder,\" Abel said, \"look at 'em look.\"    Sweeping the field with the lens, Abel spoke meanwhile.    \"Seems as if I'd kind of miss all the fuss in the store around  Christmas,\" he said,--\"the extra rush and the trimming up and all.\"    \"Abel'll miss lavishin' his store with cut paper, I guess,\" said Simeon;  \"he dotes on tassels.\"    \"Last year,\" Abel went on, not lowering the glass, \"I had a little kid  come in the store Christmas Eve, that I'd never see before. He ask' me  if he could get warm--and he set down on the edge of a chair by the  stove, and he took in everything in the place. I ask' him his name, and  he just smiled. I ask' him if he was glad it was Christmas, and he says,  Was I. I was goin' to give him some cough drops, but when I come back  from waiting on somebody he was gone. I never could find out who he was,  nor see anybody that saw him. I thought mebbe this Christmas he'd come  back. Lord, don't it look like a pasture of buttercups up there? Here,  Simeon.\"    Simeon, talking, took the glass and lifted it to the stars.    \"Cut paper doin's is all very well,\" he said, \"but the worst nightmare  of the year to the stores is Christmas. I always think it's come to be  'Peace on earth, good will to men and extravagance of women.' Quite a  nice little till of gold pieces up there in the sky, ain't there? I'd  kind o' like to stake a claim out up there--eh? Lay it out along about  around that bright one down there--by Josh,\" he broke off, \"look at that  bright one.\"    Simeon kept looking through the glass, and he leaned a little forward to  try to see the better.    \"What is it?\" he repeated, \"what's that one? It's the biggest star I  ever see--\"    The other two looked where he was looking, low in the east. But they saw  nothing save boughs indeterminately moving and a spatter of sparkling  points not more bright than those of the upper field.    \"You look,\" Simeon bade the vague presence that was his host; but  through the glass, Ebenezer still saw nothing that challenged his sight.    \"I don't know the name of a star in the sky, except the dipper,\" he  grumbled, \"but I don't see anything out of the ordinary, anyhow.\"    \"It is,\" Simeon protested; \"I tell you, it's the biggest star I ever  saw. It's blue and purple and green and yellow--\"    Abel had the glass now, and he had looked hardly sooner than he had  recognized.    \"Sure,\" he said, \"I've got it. It _is_ blue and purple and green and  yellow, and it's as big as most stars put together. It twinkles--yes,  sir, and it swings....\" he broke off, laughing at the mystification of  the others, and laughed so that he could not go on.    \"Is it a comet, do you s'pose?\" said Simeon.    \"No,\" said Abel, \"no. It's come to stay. It's our individual private  star. It's the arc light in front of the Town Hall you two are looking  at.\"    They moved to where Abel stood, and from there, up the rise of ground to  the east, they could see Simeon's star, shining softly and throwing  long rays, it seemed, almost to where they stood: the lamp that marked  the heart of the village.    \"Shucks,\" said Simeon.    \"Sold,\" said Ebenezer.    \"Why, I don't know,\" said Abel, \"I kind of like to see it through the  glass. It looks like it was a bigger light than we give it credit for.\"    \"It's a big enough light,\" said Ebenezer, testily. It was his own plant  at the factory that made possible the town's three arc lights, and these  had been continued by him at the factory's closing.    \"No use making fun of your friends' eyesight because you're all of  twenty minutes younger than them,\" Simeon grumbled. \"Come on, Abel. It  must be gettin' round the clock.\"    Abel lingered.    \"A man owns the hull thing with a glass o' this stamp,\" he said. \"How  much does one like that cost?\" he inquired.    \"I'll sell you this one--\" began Ebenezer; \"wait a week or two and I may  sell you this one,\" he said. \"I ain't really looked through it myself  yet.\"    Not much after this, the two went away and left Ebenezer in the dark  yard.    He stood in the middle of his little grass plot and looked through his  glass again. That night there was, so to say, nothing remote about the  sky, save its distance. It had none of the reticence of clouds. It made  you think of a bed of golden bells, each invisible stalk trying on its  own account to help forward some Spring. As he had said, he did not know  one star from another, nor a planet for a planet with a name. It had  been years since he had seen the heavens so near. He moved about,  looking, and passed the wall of leafless lilacs and mulberries. Stars  hung in his boughs like fruit for the plucking. They patterned patches  of sky. He looked away and back, and it was as if the stars repeated  themselves, like the chorus of everything.    \"You beggars,\" Ebenezer said, \"awful dressed up, ain't you? It must be  for something up there--it ain't for anything down here, let me tell  you.\"    He went up to his dark back door. From without there he could hear Kate  Kerr, his general servant, who had sufficient personality to compel the  term \"housekeeper,\" setting sponge for bread, with a slapping, hollow  sound and a force that implied a frown for every down stroke of the iron  spoon. He knew how she would turn toward the door as he entered, with  her way of arching eyebrows, in the manner of one about to recite the  symptoms of a change for the worse--or at best to say \"about the same\"  to everything in the universe. And when Kate Kerr spoke, she always  whispered on the faintest provocation.    A sudden distaste for the entire inside of his house seized Ebenezer. He  turned and wandered back down the little dark yard, looking up at the  high field of the stars, with only his dim eyes.    \"There must be quite a little to know about them,\" he thought, \"if  anybody was enough interested.\"    Then he remembered Simeon and Abel, and laughed again in his way.    \"I done the town a good turn for once, didn't I?\" he thought; \"I've  fixed folks so's they can't spend their money fool!\"    Two steps from Ebenezer's front gate, Simeon and Abel overtook a woman.  She had a long shawl over her head, and she was humming some faint air  of her own making.    \"Coming to the meeting, Mary?\" Simeon asked as they passed her.    \"No,\" said Mary Chavah, \"I started for it. But it's such a nice night  I'm going to walk around.\"    \"Things are going to go your way to that meeting, I guess,\" said Simeon;  \"ain't you always found fault with Christmas?\"    \"They's a lot o' nonsense about it,\" Mary assented; \"I don't ever bother  myself much with it. Why?\"    \"I donno but we'll all come round to your way of thinking to-night,\"  said Simeon.    \"For just this year!\" Abel Ames called back, as they went on.    \"You can't do much else, I guess,\" said Mary. \"Everybody dips Christmas  up out of their pocketbooks, and if there ain't nothing there, they  can't dip.\"    The men laughed with her, and went on down the long street toward the  town. Mary followed slowly, under the yellowing elms that made great  golden shades for the dim post lamps. And high at the far end of the  street down which they went, hung the blue arc light before the Town  Hall, center to the constellation of the home lights and the shop lights  and the street lights, all near neighbours to the stream and sweep of  the stars hanging a little higher and shining as by one sun.          III      It was interesting to see how they took the proposal to drop that  Christmas from the calendar there in Old Trail Town. It was so eminently  a sensible thing to do, and they all knew it. Oh, every way they looked  at it, it was sensible, and they admitted it. Yet, besides Mary Chavah  and Ebenezer Rule, probably the only person in the town whose  satisfaction in the project could be counted on to be unfeigned was  little Tab Winslow. For Tab, as all the town knew, had a turkey brought  up by his own hand to be the Winslows' Christmas dinner, but such had  become Tab's intimacy with and fondness for the turkey that he was  prepared to forego his Christmas if only that dinner were foregone,  too.    \"Theophilus Thistledown is such a human turkey,\" Tab had been heard  explaining patiently; \"he knows me--and he knows his name. He don't  _expect_ us to eat him ... why, you _can't_ eat anything that knows its  name.\"    But every one else was just merely sensible. And they had been  discussing Christmas in this sensible strain at the town meeting that  night, before Simeon and Abel broached their plan for standardizing  their sensible leanings.    Somebody had said that Jenny Wing, and Bruce Rule, who was Ebenezer's  nephew, were expected home for Christmas, and had added that it \"didn't  look as if there would be much of any Christmas down to the station to  meet them.\" On which Mis' Mortimer Bates had spoken out, philosophical  to the point of brutality. Mis' Bates was little and brown and quick,  and her clothes seemed always to curtain her off, so that her figure  was no part of her presence.    \"I ain't going to do a thing for Christmas this year,\" she declared, as  nearly everybody in the village had intermittently declared, \"not a  living, breathing thing. I can't, and folks might just as well know it,  flat foot. What's the use of buying tinsel and flim-flam when"]]]
