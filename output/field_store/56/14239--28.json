WHIGS AND DEMOCRATS TILL THE DOMINANCE OF THE SLAVERY CONTROVERSY.    1814-1840    CHAPTER I.    THE WHIG PARTY AND ITS MISSION    [1820]    The term \"whig\" is of Scotch origin. During the bloody conflict of the  Covenanters with Charles II. nearly all the country people of Scotland  sided against the king. As these peasants drove into Edinburgh to  market, they were observed to make great use of the word \"whiggam\" in  talking to their horses. Abbreviated to \"whig,\" it speedily became, and  has in England and Scotland ever since remained, a name for the  opponents of royal power. It was so employed in America in our  Revolutionary days. Sinking out of hearing after Independence, it  reappeared for fresh use when schism came in the overgrown Democratic  Party.    The republican predominance after 1800, so complete, bidding so fair to  be permanent, drew all the more fickle Federalists speedily to that  side. Since it was evident that the new party was quite as national in  spirit as the ruling element of the old, the Adams Federalists, those  most patriotic, least swayed in their politics by commercial motives,  including Marshall, the War Federalists, and the recruits enlisted at  the South during Adams's administration, also went over, in sympathy if  not in name, to Republicanism. The fortunate issue of the war silenced  every carper, and the ten years following have been well named the \"era  of good feeling.\"    But though for long very harmonious, yet, so soon as Federalists began  swelling their ranks, the Republicans ceased to be a strictly  homogeneous party. Incipient schism appeared by 1812, at once announced  and widened by the creation of the protective system and the new United  States Bank in 1816, and the attempted launching of an internal  improvements regime in 1821, all three the plain marks of federalist  survival, however men might shun that name. Republicans like Clay,  Calhoun in his early years, and Quincy Adams, while somewhat more  obsequious to the people, as to political theory differed from old  Federalists in little but name. The same is true of Clinton, candidate  against Madison for the Presidency in 1812, and of many who supported  him.    [1825]    But to drive home fatally the wedge between \"democratic\" and \"national\"  Republicans, required Jackson's quarrel with Adams and Clay in 1825,  when, the election being thrown into the House, although Jackson had  ninety-nine electoral votes to Adams's eighty-four, Crawford's  forty-one, and Clay's thirty-seven, Clay's supporters, by a \"corrupt  bargain,\" as Old Hickory alleged, voted for Adams and made him  President. Hickory's idea--an untenable one--was that the House was  bound to elect according to the tenor of the popular and the electoral  vote. After all this, however, so potent the charm of the old party, the  avowal of a purpose to build up a new one did not work well, Clay  polling in 1832 hardly half the electoral vote of Adams in 1828. This  democratic gain was partly owing, it is true, to Jackson's popularity,  to the belief that he had been wronged in 1825, and to the widening of  the franchise which had long been going on in the nation. Calhoun's  election as Vice-President in 1828, by a large majority, shows that  party crystallization was then far from complete. From about 1834, the  new political body thus gradually evolved was regularly called the  Whigs, though the name had been heard ever since 1825.    [1830-1833]    The doctrines characteristic of Whiggism were chiefly five:    I. Broad Construction of the Constitution.    This has been sufficiently explained in the chapter on Federalism and  Anti-Federalism, and need not be dwelt upon. The whig attitude upon it  appears in all that follows.    II. The Bank.    The First United States Bank had perished by the expiration of its  charter in 1811. It had been very useful, indeed almost indispensable,  in managing the national finances, and its decease, with the consequent  financial disorder, was a most terrible drawback in the war. Recharter  was, however, by a very small majority, refused. The evils flowing from  this perverse step manifesting themselves day by day, a new Bank of the  United States, modelled closely after the first, was chartered on "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23755"],[0,"Birds of the Indian Hills (#2)"],[1," plains of India. Between the summit and the  plains, a distance of 60 to 70 miles, there are higher, middle, and  lower ranges, so cut up by deep and winding valleys and river-courses,  that no labyrinth could be found more confusing or difficult to  unravel. There is nowhere any tableland, as at the Cape or in Colorado,  with horizontal strata of rock cut down by water into valleys or  canyons. The strata seem, on the contrary, to have been shoved up  and crumpled in all directions by some powerful shrinkage of the  earth's crust, due perhaps to cooling; and the result is such a jumble  of contorted rock masses, that it looks as if some great castle had  been blown up by dynamite and its walls hurled in all directions.  The great central masses, however, consist generally of crystalline  granite, gneiss, and quartz rock, protruding from the bowels of the  earth and shoving up the stratified envelope of rocks nearly 6 miles  above sea-level.... The higher you get up ... the rougher and more  difficult becomes the climbing; the valleys are deeper and more cut  into ravines, the rocks more fantastically and rudely torn asunder,  and the very vitals of the earth exposed; while the heights above  tower to the skies. The torrents rushing from under the glaciers which  flow from the snow-clad summits roar and foam, eating their way ever  into the misty gorges.\"    Those who have not visited the Himalayas may perhaps best obtain an  idea of the nature of the country from a brief description of that  traversed by a path leading from the plain to the snowy range. Let  us take the path from Kathgodam, the terminus of the Rohilkhand and  Kumaun railway, to the Pindari glacier.    For the first two miles the journey is along the cart-road to Naini  Tal, on the right bank of the Gola river.    At Ranibagh the pilgrim to the Pindari glacier leaves the cart-road  and follows a bridle-path which, having crossed the Gola by a  suspension bridge, mounts the steep hill on the left bank. Skirting  this hill on its upward course, the road reaches the far side, which  slopes down to the Barakheri stream. A fairly steep ascent of 5 miles  through well-wooded country brings the traveller to Bhim Tal, a lake  4500 feet above the level of the sea. This lake, of which the area  is about 150 acres, is one of the largest of a series of lakes formed  by the flow of mountain streams into cup-like valleys. The path skirts  the lake and then ascends the Gagar range, which attains a height  of over 7000 feet. From the pass over this range a very fine view  is obtainable. To the north the snowy range stretches, and between  it and the pass lie 60 miles of mountain and valley. To the south  are to be seen Bhim Tal, Sat Tal, and other lakes, nestling in the  outer ranges, and, beyond the hills, the vast expanse of the plains.    The Gagar range is well wooded. The majority of the trees are  rhododendrons: these, when they put forth their blossoms in spring,  display a mass of crimson colouring. From the Gagar pass the road  descends for some 3 miles through forest to the valley of the Ramganga.  For about a mile the path follows the left bank of this small stream;  it then crosses it by a suspension bridge, and forthwith begins to  mount gradually the bare rocky Pathargarhi mountain. On the mountain  side, a few hundred feet above the Ramganga, is a village of three  score double-storeyed houses. These are very picturesque. Their  white walls are set off by dark brown woodwork. But alas they are  as whited sepulchres. It is only from a distance that they are  picturesque. They are typical abodes of the hill folk.    From the Pathargarhi pass the path makes a steep descent down a  well-wooded mountain-side to the Deodar stream. After crossing this  by a stone bridge, the path continues its switch-back course upwards  on a wooded hillside to the Laldana Binaik pass, whence it descends  gradually for 6 miles, through first rhododendron then pine forest  to the Sual river. This river is crossed by a suspension bridge. From  the Sual the path makes an ascent of 3 miles on a rocky hillside to  Almora, which is 36 miles from Kathgodam.    Almora used to be a Gurkha stronghold, and is now a charming little  hill station situated some 5300 feet above the sea-level.    The town and the civil and military station are built on a  saddle-backed ridge which is about 2 miles in length.    The Almora hill was almost completely denuded of trees by the Gurkhas,  but the ridge has since become well wooded. Deodar, pine, _tun_,  horse-chestnut, and alder trees are plentiful, and throughout the  cantonment grows a spiraea hedge.    The avifauna of Almora is very interesting, consisting as it does  of a strange mixture of hills and plains birds. Among the latter the  most prominent are the grey-necked crow, the koel, the myna, the  king-crow and the magpie-robin. In the spring paradise flycatchers  are very abundant.    From Almora the road to the snowy range runs over an almost treeless  rocky mountain called Kalimat, which rises to a height of 6500 feet.  From Kalimat the road descends to Takula--16 miles from Almora. Then  there is a further descent of 11 miles to Bageswar--a small town  situated on the Sarju river. The inhabitants of Bageswar lead a sleepy  existence for 360 days in the year, awakening for a short time in  January, when a big fair is held, to which flock men of Dhanpur,  Thibetans, Bhotias, Nepalese, Garwalis, and Kumaunis. These bring  wool, borax, and skins, which they exchange for the produce of the  plains.    From Bageswar the Pindari road is almost level for 22 miles, and runs  alongside the Sarju. At first the valley is wide and well cultivated.  Here and there are studded villages, of which the houses are roofed  with thatching composed of pine needles.    At a place about 16 miles above Bageswar the valley of the Sarju  suddenly contracts into a gorge with precipitous cliffs.    The scenery here is superb. The path passes through a shady glade  in the midst of which rushes the roaring, foaming river. The trunks  and larger branches of the trees are covered with ferns and hanging  moss. The landscape might well be the original for a phase of a  transformation scene at a pantomime. In the midst of this glade the  stream is crossed by a wooden bridge.    At a spot 2 miles above this the path, leaving the Sarju, takes a  sharp turn to the left, and begins a steep ascent of 5 miles up the  Dhakuri mountain. The base of this hill is well wooded. Higher up  the trees are less numerous. On the ridge the rhododendron and oak  forest alternates with large patches of grassland, on which wild  raspberries and brightly-coloured alpine flowers grow.    From the summit of the Dhakuri mountain a magnificent panorama  delights the eye. To the north is a deep valley, above which the  snow-clad mountains rise almost precipitously. Towering above the  observer are the peaks of the highest mountains in British territory.  The peaks and 14,000 feet of the slopes are covered with snow. Below  the snow is a series of glaciers: these are succeeded by rocks, grass,  and stunted vegetation until the tree-line is reached.    To the south lies the world displayed. Near at hand are 50 miles of  rugged mountainous country, and beyond the apparently limitless  plains. On a clear day it is said to be possible to distinguish the  minarets of Delhi, 300 miles away. In the early morning, when the  clouds still hover in the valleys, one seems to gaze upon a white  billowy sea studded with rocky islets.    From the Dhakuri pass the path descends about 2000 feet, and then  follows the valley of the Pindari river. The scenery here is  magnificent. Unlike that of the Sarju, this valley is narrow. It is  not much cultivated; amaranthus is almost the only crop grown. The  villages are few and the huts which constitute them are rudely  constructed. The cliffs are very high, and rise almost  perpendicularly, like giant walls, so that the numerous feeders of  the river take the form of cascades, in many of which the water falls  without interruption for a distance of over 1000 feet.    The Kuphini river joins the Pindar 8 miles from its source. Beyond  the junction the path to the glacier crosses to the left bank of the  Pindar, and then the ascent becomes steep. During the ascent the  character of the flora changes. Trees become fewer and flowers more  numerous; yellow colt's-foot, dandelions, gentians, Michaelmas  daisies, columbines, centaurias, anemones, and edelweiss grow in  profusion. Choughs, monal pheasants, and snow-pigeons are the  characteristic birds of this region.    Thus the birds of the Himalayas inhabit a country in every respect  unlike the plains of India. They dwell in a different environment,  are subjected to a different climate, and feed upon different food.  It is therefore not surprising that the two avifaunas should exhibit  great divergence. Nevertheless few people who have not actually been  in both localities are able to realise the startlingly abrupt  transformation of the bird-fauna seen by one who passes from the  plains to the hills.    The 5-mile journey from Rajpur to Mussoorie transports the traveller  from one bird-realm to another.    The caw of the house-crow is replaced by the deeper note of the corby.  Instead of the crescendo shriek of the koel, the pleasing double note  of the European cuckoo meets the ear. For the eternal _coo-coo-coo-coo_  of the little brown dove, the melodious _kokla-kokla_ of the hill  green-pigeon is substituted. The harsh cries of the rose-ringed  paroquets give place to the softer call of the slaty-headed species.  The monotonous _tonk-tonk-tonk_ of the coppersmith and the  _kutur-kutur-kutur_ of the green barbet are no more heard; in their  stead the curious calls of the great Himalayan barbet resound among  the hills. The dissonant voices of the seven sisters no longer issue  from the thicket; their place is"]]]
