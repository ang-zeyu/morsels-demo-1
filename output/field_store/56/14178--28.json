It was  demolished in 1694 by Governor Frontenac, who rebuilt it on the  original foundations, and it was this castle which, in a remodelled and  enlarged form, under the English regime, lasted until 1834.      {xiv}    PORTRAIT OF JACQUES CARTIER  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   31      _From B.

Then it must have happened while I was asleep,\" he said,  thoughtfully.    \"How is Uncle Henry?\" she enquired, after a pause during which the horse  continued to trot with long, regular strides.    \"He's pretty well. He and Uncle Hugson have been having a fine visit.\"    \"Is Mr. Hugson your uncle?\" she asked.    \"Yes. Uncle Bill Hugson married your Uncle Henry's wife's sister; so we  must be second cousins,\" said the boy, in an amused tone. \"I work for  Uncle Bill on his ranch, and he pays me six dollars a month and my  board.\"    \"Isn't that a great deal?\" she asked, doubtfully.    \"Why, it's a great deal for Uncle Hugson, but not for me. I'm a splendid  worker. I work as well as I sleep,\" he added, with a laugh.    \"What is your name?\" asked Dorothy, thinking she liked the boy's manner  and the cheery tone of his voice.    \"Not a very pretty one,\" he answered, as if a little ashamed. \"My whole  name is Zebediah; but folks just call me 'Zeb.' You've been to  Australia, haven't you?\"    \"Yes; with Uncle Henry,\" she answered. \"We got to San Francisco a week  ago, and Uncle Henry went right on to Hugson's Ranch for a visit while I  stayed a few days in the city with some friends we had met.\"    \"How long will you be with us?\" he asked.    \"Only a day. Tomorrow Uncle Henry and I must start back for Kansas.  We've been away for a long time, you know, and so we're anxious to get  home again.\"    The boy flicked the big, boney horse with his whip and looked  thoughtful. Then he started to say something to his little companion,  but before he could speak the buggy began to sway dangerously from side  to side and the earth seemed to rise up before them. Next minute there  was a roar and a sharp crash, and at her side Dorothy saw the ground  open in a wide crack and then come together again.    \"Goodness!\" she cried, grasping the iron rail of the seat. \"What was  that?\"    \"That was an awful big quake,\" replied Zeb, with a white face. \"It  almost got us that time, Dorothy.\"    The horse had stopped short, and stood firm as a rock. Zeb shook the  reins and urged him to go, but Jim was stubborn. Then the boy cracked  his whip and touched the animal's flanks with it, and after a low moan  of protest Jim stepped slowly along the road.    Neither the boy nor the girl spoke again for some minutes. There was a  breath of danger in the very air, and every few moments the earth would  shake violently. Jim's ears were standing erect upon his head and every  muscle of his big body was tense as he trotted toward home. He was not  going very fast, but on his flanks specks of foam began to appear and at  times he would tremble like a leaf.    The sky had grown darker again and the wind made queer sobbing sounds as  it swept over the valley.    Suddenly there was a rending, tearing sound, and the earth split into  another great crack just beneath the spot where the horse was standing.  With a wild neigh of terror the animal fell bodily into the pit, drawing  the buggy and its occupants after him.    Dorothy grabbed fast hold of the buggy top and the boy did the same. The  sudden rush into space confused them so that they could not think.    Blackness engulfed them on every side, and in breathless silence they  waited for the fall to end and crush them against jagged rocks or for  the earth to close in on them again and bury them forever in its  dreadful depths.    The horrible sensation of falling, the darkness and the terrifying  noises, proved more than Dorothy could endure and for a few moments the  little girl lost consciousness. Zeb, being a boy, did not faint, but he  was badly frightened, and clung to the buggy seat with a tight grip,  expecting every moment would be his last.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]          CHAPTER 2.    THE GLASS CITY      When Dorothy recovered her senses they were still falling, but not so  fast. The top of the buggy caught the air like a parachute or an  umbrella filled with wind, and held them back so that they floated  downward with a gentle motion that was not so very disagreeable to bear.  The worst thing was their terror of reaching the bottom of this great  crack in the earth, and the natural fear that sudden death was about to  overtake them at any moment. Crash after crash echoed far above their  heads, as the earth came together where it had split, and stones and  chunks of clay rattled around them on every side. These they could not  see, but they could feel them pelting the buggy top, and Jim screamed  almost like a human being when a stone overtook him and struck his  boney body. They did not really hurt the poor horse, because everything  was falling together; only the stones and rubbish fell faster than the  horse and buggy, which were held back by the pressure of the air, so  that the terrified animal was actually more frightened than he was  injured.    How long this state of things continued Dorothy could not even guess,  she was so greatly bewildered. But bye and bye, as she stared ahead into  the black chasm with a beating heart, she began to dimly see the form of  the horse Jim--his head up in the air, his ears erect and his long legs  sprawling in every direction as he tumbled through space. Also, turning  her head, she found that she could see the boy beside her, who had until  now remained as still and silent as she herself.    Dorothy sighed and commenced to breathe easier. She began to realize  that death was not in store for her, after all, but that she had merely  started upon another adventure, which promised to be just as queer and  unusual as were those she had before encountered.    With this thought in mind the girl took heart and leaned her head over  the side of the buggy to see where the strange light was coming from.  Far below her she found six great glowing balls suspended in the air.  The central and largest one was white, and reminded her of the sun.  Around it were arranged, like the five points of a star, the other five  brilliant balls; one being rose colored, one violet, one yellow, one  blue and one orange. This splendid group of colored suns sent rays  darting in every direction, and as the horse and buggy--with Dorothy and  Zeb--sank steadily downward and came nearer to the lights, the rays  began to take on all the delicate tintings of a rainbow, growing more  and more distinct every moment until all the space was brilliantly  illuminated.    Dorothy was too dazed to say much, but she watched one of Jim's big ears  turn to violet and the other to rose, and wondered that his tail should  be yellow and his body striped with blue and orange like the stripes of  a zebra. Then she looked at Zeb, whose face was blue and whose hair was  pink, and gave a little laugh that sounded a bit nervous.    \"Isn't it funny?\" she said.    The boy was startled and his eyes were big. Dorothy had a green streak  through the center of her face where the blue and yellow lights came  together, and her appearance seemed to add to his fright.    \"I--I don't s-s-see any-thing funny--'bout it!\" he stammered.    [Illustration: HORSE, BUGGY AND ALL FELL SLOWLY.]    Just then the buggy tipped slowly over upon its side, the body of the  horse tipping also. But they continued to fall, all together, and the  boy and girl had no difficulty in remaining upon the seat, just as they  were before. Then they turned bottom side up, and continued to roll  slowly over until they were right side up again. During this time Jim  struggled frantically, all his legs kicking the air; but on finding  himself in his former position the horse said, in a relieved tone of  voice:    \"Well, that's better!\"    Dorothy and Zeb looked at one another in wonder.    \"Can your horse talk?\" she asked.    \"Never knew him to, before,\" replied the boy.    \"Those were the first words I ever said,\" called out the horse, who had  overheard them, \"and I can't explain why I happened to speak then. This  is a nice scrape you've got me into, isn't it?\"    \"As for that, we are in the same scrape ourselves,\" answered Dorothy,  cheerfully. \"But never mind; something will happen pretty soon.\"    \"Of course,\" growled the horse; \"and then we shall be sorry it  happened.\"    Zeb gave a shiver. All this was so terrible and unreal that he could not  understand it at all, and so had good reason to be afraid.    Swiftly they drew near to the flaming colored suns, and passed close  beside them. The light was then so bright that it dazzled their eyes,  and they covered their faces with their hands to escape being blinded.  There was no heat in the colored suns, however, and after they had  passed below them the top of the buggy shut out many of the piercing  rays so that the boy and girl could open their eyes again.    \"We've got to come to the bottom some time,\" remarked Zeb, with a deep  sigh. \"We can't keep falling forever, you know.\"    \"Of course not,\" said Dorothy. \"We are somewhere in the middle of the  earth, and the chances are we'll reach the other side of it before long.  But it's a big hollow, isn't it?\"    \"Awful big!\" answered the boy.    \"We're coming to something now,\" announced the horse.    At this they both put their heads over the side of the buggy and looked  down. Yes; there was land below them; and not so very far away, either.  But they were floating very, very slowly--so slowly that it could no  longer be called a fall--and the children had ample time to take heart  and look about them.    They saw a landscape with mountains and plains, lakes and rivers, very  like those upon the earth's surface; but all the scene was splendidly  colored by the variegated lights"]]]
