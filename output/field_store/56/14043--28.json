Edwin married Ethelburga, a daughter of  Ethelbert, king of Kent, who had been converted to Christianity by the  preaching of S. Augustine. He himself received baptism at the hands of  Paulinus (625-633), the great Roman missionary, who was sent north with  the Princess Ethelburga. Paulinus fixed his headquarters at York, where  he built his church, the forerunner of the present cathedral. This  attempt of the Romans to christianise Northumbria was, however, of short  duration. Cadwalla and Penda rose against them, and Edwin fell in battle  at Hatfield Moor in Yorkshire. Paulinus, despairing of the cause,  returned to Kent with the queen-widow Ethelburga and her children; and  under Cadwalla and Penda, the kingdom soon relapsed into Paganism.    We must now direct our attention to a small, barren island on the west  coast of Scotland, Iona. Here came a voluntary exile (A.D. 563),  Columba, a monk, said to have been a descendant of the Irish kings. Here  he lived and founded a great missionary monastery, which afterwards  became the centre of Christian influence in Scotland and the north of  England. He and his followers were active workers; they wrote Gospels  and devotional books, preached, and built churches of wood. Columba died  (A.D. 597), but his work was continued.    In 634, Oswald, a son of Ethelfrith, became king of Northumbria. In his  youth he, with his brothers, had been obliged to flee to Scotland,  where, during his exile, Oswald was converted to Christianity by the  teachers of Iona. On his return he defeated and killed Cadwalla at  Hevenfeld, or Heavenfield, near Hexham, in 634, and became the means of  finally introducing Christianity into his kingdom. Soon after he became  king, Oswald sent to Iona for help, and in reply came a monk, who, for  some reason, said by old writers to be his harshness, failed in his  mission. He was replaced by another monk named Aidan (635-651), who was  eminently successful. Beda speaks of him as \"a man of great piety and  zeal, combined with tender charity and gentleness.\" Aidan became  intimately associated with King Oswald, the two working together, and he  chose for his headquarters the small sandy island of Lindisfarne, off  the Northumbrian coast, which we now know as \"Holy Island.\"    Lindisfarne thus resembled Iona, and it is probable that the similarity  of position and surroundings influenced Aidan in his choice. However  that may be, Aidan there founded his monastery and directed the work of  his monks.    Passing over a short period, we find at Lindisfarne a monk who is so  intimately connected with this cathedral that he demands special  attention--the great S. Cuthbert, sixth bishop of Lindisfarne, and the  patron saint of Durham. Little is known of his birth and parentage. Some  writers give him a Scotch origin, others Irish,[1] and others again say  he was born of humble parents on the banks of the Tweed. The latter is  most probable. Certain it is that at an early age he was left an orphan,  and was employed as an under-shepherd near to Melrose. From his earliest  youth he was thoughtful and pious, and watched and imitated in his mode  of life the monks of Melrose. There are numerous legends and stories of  S. Cuthbert's youth. He is said to have wrought many miracles, even to  the extent of stilling a tempest. One of these may be told here on  account of the share it played in his choice of monastic life:--On a  certain night in A.D. 651, while tending his sheep, his companions being  asleep, Cuthbert saw in the heavens a brilliant shaft of light, and  angels descending. These very shortly re-ascended, bearing among them \"a  spirit of surpassing brightness.\" In the morning it was found that the  good S. Aidan was dead. The vision had a marked and lasting effect on  Cuthbert, and eventually resulted in his entering the monastery at  Melrose. For ten years Cuthbert led a holy and studious life at Melrose,  under Prior Boisil, when he was chosen among others to proceed to the  newly-founded monastery at Ripon. His sojourn there was, however, short,  as owing to doctrinal differences concerning the celebration of Easter,  he and the other Scottish monks returned to Melrose. Some four years  later, on the death of Boisil, Cuthbert was elected his successor, as  prior of Melrose. In A.D. 664, we find him holding the same office at  Lindisfarne, where he remained for twelve years. He then retired from  his position, in order to attain a higher degree of Christian perfection  by living a solitary life, first on a small island near Lindisfarne, and  afterwards on the island of Farne, near Bamburgh. There are many stories  told of his great piety at this time, so that even the wild sea-birds  are said to have obeyed him.       [1] Sanderson, in his edition of \"Rites of Durham,\" 1767, says:         \"He is said to be descended from the Blood Royal of the Kings         of Ireland, being son of one Muriardach and Sabina his wife,         a King's daughter. He was educated in the Abbey of Mailrose.\"    In the year A.D. 685 Cuthbert was, though against his own wishes,  consecrated Bishop of Lindisfarne. His great activity and usefulness in  this office was soon cut short, for in less than two years, on the 20th  of March A.D. 687, he died. Obediently to his own request, his body was  wrapped in a linen cloth, which had been given him by the Abbess Yerca;  and, placed in a stone coffin, the gift of the Abbot Cudda, was interred  in the church at Lindisfarne. He was not to rest, however. In A.D. 698  the monks disinterred his remains in order to place them in a  specially-prepared wooden coffin. It is said they found the saint's body  perfectly incorrupt. To quote the quaint Hegge:        But whiles they opened his coffin, they start at a wonder, they      look't for bones and found flesh, they expected a skeleton, and saw      an entire bodie, with joynts flexible, his flesh so succulent, that      there only wanted heate to make his bodie live without a soul, and      his face so dissembling death, that elsewhere it is true that sleep      is the image of death, but here death was the image of sleep. Nay,      his very funerall weeds were so fresh, as if putrefaction had not      dared to take him by the coat.[2]      [2] \"County of Durham,\" by J.K. Boyle, F.S.A.    Whatever may be the truth of this, his body was placed in a wooden  coffin, portions of which are still preserved in the chapter library at  Durham.    Over a century and a half after these events the coast of Northumbria  was disturbed and troubled by the piratical invasions of the Danes. The  number and violence of these incursions so increased that the whole  country lay practically at their mercy. Becoming alarmed for their own  safety and that of their holy relics, the monks of Lindisfarne fled,  taking with them the body of their saint, and all their sacred vessels  and books. This occurred in A.D. 875.    Here commenced that long wandering which eventually ended in the  founding of the Cathedral Church of Durham, where the bones of S.  Cuthbert found their final resting-place.    Bishop Eardulph and his monks, with their sacred charge, travelled for  seven years, over a great portion of the north of England and part of  the south of Scotland. Many churches dedicated to S. Cuthbert in the  north are thought to mark their resting-places. From a list of these  given by Prior Wessington the probable route of the wanderers can be  approximately, made out as follows:--First to Elsdon and down the Rede  to Haydon Bridge. Up the South Tyne to Beltinghame, and then following  the route of the Roman Wall to Bewcastle. Turning south to Salkeld, and  thence by Eden Hall and Plumbland into Lancashire, towards the river  Derwent. Here they came to a determination to cross to Ireland, and took  ship from the mouth of the Derwent. Very soon a violent storm arose, the  vessel became unmanageable and was nearly filled with water, which,  according to Symeon, immediately turned into blood. A return was  inevitable. It was during this attempt that the famous copy of the  Gospels, known as the Durham Book, was washed overboard into the sea.  This book is, perhaps, the most beautiful example of Anglo-Saxon writing  and illumination extant, and is surpassed only by the celebrated Irish  MS., the Book of Kells. It was shortly afterwards found on the coast in  a comparatively uninjured condition; and is now preserved in the British  Museum. The wandering monks next turned northwards as far as Witherne,  on the Galloway coast, and then returned to England, through  Westmoreland and across Stainmoor into Teesdale, staying for a time at  a village, which no doubt owes it present name Cotherstone to this  circumstance. Leaving here and crossing the hills, through Marske,  Forcett and Barton, they arrived at the abbey of Craike, near  Easingwold, where they were kindly treated by the abbot, and remained  about four months. On resuming their journey the monks removed the body  of S. Cuthbert to Cuncachester, or, as we now know it, Chester-le-Street,  a former Roman camp. Here the fraternity remained for a hundred and  thirteen years; and here was the seat of the Bishopric of Bernicia until  A.D. 995. Many are the legends clustering round these journeyings. How,  when leaving Lindisfarne, the sea opened a passage for them, and how in  more than one difficulty the dead saint himself gave them assistance.  Notably, on one occasion when the bearers were worn out and weary he  appeared and showed them where they would find a horse and car in which  to carry their burden. This horse and car were afterwards used on their  journeys.    In the year 995, again for safety, they removed once more under Bishop  Aldhun, first for a short time to Ripon, and then finally to Durham. It  is of this last journey the following story is told:--        \"Coming with him\" (_v._ Sanderson), \"on"]]]
