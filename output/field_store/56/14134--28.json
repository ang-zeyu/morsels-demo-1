The use of ammonia as an alkali for soap-making purposes has often been  attempted, but owing to the ease with which the resultant soap is  decomposed, it can scarcely be looked upon as a product of much  commercial value.    H. Jackson has, however, recently patented (Eng. Pat. 6,712, 1906) the  use of ammonium oleate for laundry work. This detergent is prepared in  the wash-tub at the time of use, and it is claimed that goods are  cleansed by merely immersing them in this solution for a short time and  rinsing in fresh water.    Neither of the definitions given above includes the sodium and potassium  salts of rosin, commonly called rosin soap, for the acid constituents of  rosin have been shown to be aromatic, but in view of the analogous  properties of these resinates to true soap, they are generally regarded  as legitimate constituents of soap, having been used in Great Britain  since 1827, and receiving legislative sanction in Holland in 1875.    Other definitions of soap have been given, based not upon its  composition, but upon its properties, among which may be mentioned that  of Kingzett, who says that \"Soap, considered commercially, is a body  which on treatment with water liberates alkali,\" and that of Nuttall,  who defines soap as \"an alkaline or unctuous substance used in washing  and cleansing\".    _Properties of Soap._--Both soda and potash soaps are readily soluble in  either alcohol or hot water. In cold water they dissolve more slowly,  and owing to slight decomposition, due to hydrolysis (_vide infra_), the  solution becomes distinctly turbid. Sodium oleate is peculiar in not  undergoing hydrolysis except in very dilute solution and at a low  temperature. On cooling a hot soap solution, a jelly of more or less  firm consistence results, a property possessed by colloidal bodies, such  as starch and gelatine, in contradistinction to substances which under  the same conditions deposit crystals, due to diminished solubility of  the salt at a lower temperature.    Krafft (_Journ. Soc. Chem. Ind._, 1896, 206, 601; 1899, 691; and 1902,  1301) and his collaborators, Wiglow, Strutz and Funcke, have  investigated this property of soap solutions very fully, the researches  extending over several years. In the light of their more recent work,  the molecules, or definite aggregates of molecules, of solutions which  become gelatinous on cooling move much more slowly than the molecules in  the formation of a crystal, but there is a definite structure, although  arranged differently to that of a crystal. In the case of soda soaps the  colloidal character increases with the molecular weight of the fatty  acids.    Soda soaps are insoluble in concentrated caustic lyes, and, for the most  part, in strong solutions of sodium chloride, hence the addition of  caustic soda or brine to a solution of soda soap causes the soap to  separate out and rise to the surface. Addition of brine to a solution of  potash soap, on the other hand, merely results in double decomposition,  soda soap and potassium chloride being formed, thus:--        C_{17}H_{35}COOK + NaCl   =  C_{17}H_{35}COONa + KCl        potassium       sodium       sodium          potassium        stearate       chloride     stearate         chloride    The solubility of the different soaps in salt solution varies very  considerably. Whilst sodium stearate is insoluble in a 5 per cent.  solution of sodium chloride, sodium laurate requires a 17 per cent.  solution to precipitate it, and sodium caproate is not thrown out of  solution even by a saturated solution.    _Hydrolysis of Soap_.--The term \"hydrolysis\" is applied to any  resolution of a body into its constituents where the decomposition is  brought about by the action of water, hence when soap is treated with  _cold_ water, it is said to undergo hydrolysis, the reaction taking  place being represented in its simplest form by the equation:--        2NaC_{18}H_{35}O_{2} + H_{2}O  =  NaOH +   HNa(C_{18}H_{35}O_{2})_{2}      sodium                  water    caustic      acid sodium      stearate                         soda         stearate    The actual reaction which occurs has been the subject of investigation  by many chemists, and very diverse conclusions have been arrived at.  Chevreul, the pioneer in the modern chemistry of oils and fats, found  that a small amount of alkali was liberated, as appears in the above  equation, together with the formation of an acid salt, a very minute  quantity of free fatty acid remaining in solution. Rotondi (_Journ. Soc.  Chem. Ind._, 1885, 601), on the other hand, considered that a neutral  soap, on being dissolved in water, was resolved into a basic and an acid  salt, the former readily soluble in both hot and cold water, the latter  insoluble in cold water, and only slightly soluble in hot water. He  appears, however, to have been misled by the fact that sodium oleate is  readily soluble in cold water, and his views have been shown to be  incorrect by Krafft and Stern (_Ber. d. Chem. Ges._, 1894, 1747 and  1755), who from experiments with pure sodium palmitate and stearate  entirely confirm the conclusions arrived at by Chevreul.    The extent of dissociation occurring when a soap is dissolved in water  depends upon the nature of the fatty acids from which the soap is made,  and also on the concentration of the solution. The sodium salts of  cocoa-nut fatty acids (capric, caproic and caprylic acids) are by far  the most easily hydrolysed, those of oleic acid and the fatty acids from  cotton-seed oil being dissociated more readily than those of stearic  acid and tallow fatty acids. The decomposition increases with the amount  of water employed.    The hydrolytic action of water on soap is affected very considerably by  the presence of certain substances dissolved in the water, particularly  salts of calcium and magnesium. Caustic soda exerts a marked retarding  effect on the hydrolysis, as do also ethyl and amyl alcohols and  glycerol.    _Detergent Action of Soap._--The property possessed by soap of removing  dirt is one which it is difficult to satisfactorily explain. Many  theories, more or less complicated, have been suggested, but even now  the question cannot be regarded as solved.    The explanation commonly accepted is that the alkali liberated by  hydrolysis attacks any greasy matter on the surface to be cleansed, and,  as the fat is dissolved, the particles of dirt are loosened and easily  washed off. Berzelius held this view, and considered that the value of a  soap depended upon the ease with which it yielded free alkali on  solution in water.    This theory is considered by Hillyer (_Journ. Amer. Chem. Soc._, 1903,  524), however, to be quite illogical, for, as he points out, the  liberated alkali would be far more likely to recombine with the acid or  acid salt from which it has been separated, than to saponify a neutral  glyceride, while, further, unsaponifiable greasy matter is removed by  soap as easily as saponifiable fat, and there can be no question of any  chemical action of the free alkali in its case. Yet another argument  against the theory is that hydrolysis is greater in cold and dilute  solutions, whereas hot concentrated soap solutions are generally  regarded as having the best detergent action.    Rotondi (_Journ. Soc. Chem. Ind._, 1885, 601) was of the opinion that  the basic soap, which he believed to be formed by hydrolysis, was alone  responsible for the detergent action of soap, this basic soap dissolving  fatty matter by saponification, but, as already pointed out, his theory  of the formation of a basic soap is now known to be incorrect, and his  conclusions are therefore invalid.    Several explanations have been suggested, based on the purely physical  properties of soap solutions. Most of these are probably, at any rate in  part, correct, and there can be little doubt that the ultimate solution  of the problem lies in this direction, and that the detergent action of  soap will be found to depend on many of these properties, together with  other factors not yet known.    Jevons in 1878 in some researches on the \"Brownian movement\" or  \"pedesis\" of small particles, a movement of the particles which is  observed to take place when clay, iron oxide, or other finely divided  insoluble matter is suspended in water, found that the pedetic action  was considerably increased by soap and sodium silicate, and suggested  that to this action of soap might be attributed much of its cleansing  power.    Alder Wright considered that the alkali liberated by hydrolysis in some  way promoted contact of the water with the substance to be cleansed, and  Knapp regarded the property of soap solutions themselves to facilitate  contact of the water with the dirt, as one of the chief causes of the  efficacy of soap as a detergent.    Another way in which it has been suggested that soap acts as a cleanser  is that the soap itself or the alkali set free by hydrolysis serves as a  lubricant, making the dirt less adherent, and thus promoting its  removal.    The most likely theory yet advanced is that based on the emulsifying  power of soap solutions. The fact that these will readily form emulsions  with oils has long been known, and the detergent action of soap has  frequently been attributed to it, the explanation given being that the  alkali set free by the water emulsifies the fatty matter always adhering  to dirt, and carries it away in suspension with the other impurities.  Experiments by Hillyer (_loc. cit._) show, however, that while N/10  solution of alkali will readily emulsify a cotton-seed oil containing  free acidity, no emulsion is produced with an oil from which all the  acidity has been removed, or with kerosene, whereas a N/10 solution of  sodium"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21728"],[0,"The Dog Crusoe and his Master (#2)"],[1," social enjoyment as he; none laughed so  heartily, or expressed such glee in his mischief-loving eye; yet for  days together he went off alone into the forest, and wandered where his  fancy led him, as grave and silent as an Indian warrior.    After all, there was nothing mysterious in this.  The boy followed  implicitly the dictates of nature within him.  He was amiable,  straightforward, sanguine, and intensely _earnest_.  When he laughed he  let it out, as sailors have it, \"with a will.\"  When there was good  cause to be grave, no power on earth could make him smile.  We have  called him boy, but in truth he was about that uncertain period of life  when a youth is said to be neither a man nor a boy.  His face was  good-looking (_every_ earnest, candid face is) and masculine; his hair  was reddish-brown, and his eye bright blue.  He was costumed in the  deerskin cap, leggings, moccasins, and leathern shirt common to the  western hunter.    \"You seem tickled wi' the Injuns, Dick Varley,\" said a man who at that  moment issued from the block-house.    \"That's just what I am, Joe Blunt,\" replied the youth, turning with a  broad grin to his companion.    \"Have a care, lad; do not laugh at 'em too much.  They soon take  offence; an' them Red-skins never forgive.\"    \"But I'm only laughing at the baby,\" returned the youth, pointing to the  child, which, with a mixture of boldness and timidity, was playing with  a pup, wrinkling up its fat visage into a smile when its playmate rushed  away in sport, and opening wide its jet-black eyes in grave anxiety as  the pup returned at full gallop.    \"It 'ud make an owl laugh,\" continued young Varley, \"to see such a queer  pictur' o' itself.\"    He paused suddenly, and a dark frown covered his face as he saw the  Indian woman stoop quickly down, catch the pup by its hind-leg with one  hand, seize a heavy piece of wood with the other, and strike it several  violent blows on the throat.  Without taking the trouble to kill the  poor animal outright, the savage then held its still writhing body over  the fire in order to singe off the hair before putting it into the pot  to be cooked.    The cruel act drew young Varley's attention more closely to the pup, and  it flashed across his mind that this could be no other than young  Crusoe, which neither he nor his companion had before seen, although  they had often heard others speak of and describe it.    Had the little creature been one of the unfortunate Indian curs, the two  hunters would probably have turned from the sickening sight with  disgust, feeling that, however much they might dislike such cruelty, it  would be of no use attempting to interfere with Indian usages.  But the  instant the idea that it was Crusoe occurred to Varley he uttered a yell  of anger, and sprang towards the woman with a bound that caused the  three Indians to leap to their feet and grasp their tomahawks.    Blunt did not move from the gate, but threw forward his rifle with a  careless motion, but an expressive glance, that caused the Indians to  resume their seats and pipes with an emphatic \"Wah!\" of disgust at  having been startled out of their propriety by a trifle, while Dick  Varley snatched poor Crusoe from his dangerous and painful position,  scowled angrily in the woman's face, and, turning on his heel, walked up  to the house, holding the pup tenderly in his arms.    Joe Blunt gazed after his friend with a grave, solemn expression of  countenance till he disappeared; then he looked at the ground and shook  his head.    Joe was one of the regular out-and-out backwoods hunters, both in  appearance and in fact--broad, tall, massive, lion-like,--gifted with  the hunting, stalking, running, and trail--following powers of the  savage, and with a superabundance of the shooting and fighting powers,  the daring and dash of the Anglo-Saxon.  He was grave, too seldom  smiled, and rarely laughed.  His expression almost at all times was a  compound of seriousness and good-humour.  With the rifle he was a good,  steady shot; but by no means a \"crack\" one.  _His_ ball never failed to  _hit_, but it often failed to kill.    After meditating a few seconds, Joe Blunt again shook his head, and  muttered to himself; \"The boy's bold enough, but he's too reckless for a  hunter.  There was no need for that yell, now--none at all.\"    Having uttered this sagacious remark, he threw his rifle into the hollow  of his left arm, turned round, and strode off with a long, slow step  towards his own cottage.    Blunt was an American by birth, but of Irish extraction, and to an  attentive ear there was a faint echo of the _brogue_ in his tone, which  seemed to have been handed down to him as a threadbare and almost  worn-out heirloom.    Poor Crusoe was singed almost naked.  His wretched tail seemed little  better than a piece of wire filed off to a point, and he vented his  misery in piteous squeaks as the sympathetic Varley confided him  tenderly to the care of his mother.  How Fan managed to cure him no one  can tell, but cure him she did, for, in the course of a few weeks,  Crusoe was as well, and sleek, and fat as ever.        CHAPTER TWO.    A SHOOTING MATCH AND ITS CONSEQUENCES--NEW FRIENDS INTRODUCED TO THE  READER--CRUSOE AND HIS MOTHER CHANGE MASTERS.    Shortly after the incident narrated in the last chapter, the squatters  of the Mustang Valley lost their leader.  Major Hope suddenly announced  his intention of quitting the settlement, and returning to the civilised  world.  Private matters, he said, required his presence there--matters  which he did not choose to speak of but which would prevent his  returning again to reside among them.  Go he must, and, being a man of  determination, go he did; but before going he distributed all his goods  and chattels among the settlers.  He even gave away his rifle, and Fan,  and Crusoe.  These last, however, he resolved should go together; and as  they were well worth having, he announced that he would give them to the  best shot in the valley.  He stipulated that the winner should escort  him to the nearest settlement eastward, after which he might return with  the rifle on his shoulder.    Accordingly, a long level piece of ground on the river's bank, with a  perpendicular cliff at the end of it, was selected as the shooting  ground, and, on the appointed day, at the appointed hour, the  competitors began to assemble.    \"Well, lad, first as usual,\" exclaimed Joe Blunt, as he reached the  ground and found Dick Varley there before him.    \"I've bin here more than an hour lookin' for a new kind o' flower that  Jack Morgan told me he'd seen.  And I've found it too.  Look here; did  you ever see one like it before?\"    Blunt leaned his rifle against a tree, and carefully examined the  flower.    \"Why, yes, I've seed a-many o' them up about the Rocky Mountains, but  never one here-away.  It seems to have gone lost itself.  The last I  seed, if I remimber rightly, wos near the head-waters o' the Yellowstone  River, it wos--jest where I shot a grizzly bar.\"    \"Was that the bar that gave you the wipe on the cheek?\" asked Varley,  forgetting the flower in his interest about the bear.    \"It was.  I put six balls in that bar's carcase, and stuck my knife into  its heart ten times afore it gave out; an' it nearly ripped the shirt  off my back afore I was done with it.\"    \"I would give my rifle to get a chance at a grizzly!\" exclaimed Varley,  with a sudden burst of enthusiasm.    \"Whoever got it wouldn't have much to brag of,\" remarked a burly young  backwoodsman, as he joined them.    His remark was true, for poor Dick's weapon was but a sorry affair.  It  missed fire, and it hung fire, and even when it did fire it remained a  matter of doubt in its owner's mind whether the slight deviations from  the direct line made by his bullets were the result of _his_ or _its_  bad shooting.    Further comment upon it was checked by the arrival of a dozen or more  hunters on the scene of action.  They were a sturdy set of bronzed,  bold, fearless men, and one felt, on looking at them, that they would  prove more than a match for several hundreds of Indians in open fight.  A few minutes after, the major himself came on the ground with the prize  rifle on his shoulder, and Fan and Crusoe at his heels--the latter  tumbling, scrambling, and yelping after its mother, fat and clumsy, and  happy as possible, having evidently quite forgotten that it had been  nearly roasted alive only a few weeks before.    Immediately all eyes were on the rifle, and its merits were discussed  with animation.    And well did it deserve discussion, for such a piece had never before  been seen on the western frontier.  It was shorter in the barrel and  larger in the bore than the weapons chiefly in vogue at that time, and,  besides being of beautiful workmanship, was silver-mounted.  But the  grand peculiarity about it, and that which afterwards rendered it the  mystery of mysteries to the savages, was, that it had two sets of  locks--one percussion, the other flint--so that, when caps failed, by  taking off the one set of locks and affixing the others, it was  converted into a flint-rifle.  The major, however, took care never to  run short of caps, so that the flint locks were merely held as a reserve  in case of need.    \"Now, lads,\" cried Major Hope, stepping up to the point whence they were  to shoot, \"remember the terms.  He who first drives the nail obtains the  rifle, Fan, and her pup, and accompanies me to the nearest settlements.  Each man shoots with his own gun, and draws lots for the chance.\"    \"Agreed,\" cried the men.    \"Well, then, wipe your guns and draw lots.  Henri will fix the nail.  Here it is.\"    The individual who stepped, or rather plunged forward to receive the  nail was a rare and remarkable specimen of mankind.  Like his comrades,  he was half a farmer and half a hunter.  Like them, too, he was clad in  deerskin, and was tall and strong-"]]]
