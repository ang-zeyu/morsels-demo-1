Teach the words of the rhyme to the class, keeping in mind the  rhythm.    2. If in presenting the action, the movement is based upon certain words  as cues, present by imitation the activity as applied to the words,  _i.e._, Little Jack Horner; Little Miss Muffet, etc.    3. If the movement is based on a time element (rhythm), present the  activity content, line by line, _i.e._, Yankee Doodle; Pat-a-cake, etc.    4. Be sure the rhyme and activity has been thoroughly mastered before  adding the song element.    5. If a dancing movement is involved, present same to the class as a  unit before combining with other movements, _i.e._, Fly Away Jack and  Jill; Diddle, Diddle, Dumpling, etc.    _The author wishes to express thanks to Miss Louise Westwood, Director  of Music of the Newark Public Schools, for the following suggestions as  to the teaching of the song element:_    _1. Pitch-pipes:_    No song under any condition should be sung without the pitch of the  first word being given; using the pitch-pipe to get the key in which the  song is written.    _2. Range of Songs:_    All songs should be sung not lower than the first line E or higher than  the fifth line F of the staff. If songs are scored in another range,  transpose the song by changing the pitch of the _first_ word.    _3. Quality of Tone:_    All singing should be in a soft, light, head tone. Half-tone quality.      _No loud singing should be allowed at any time._      PROCEDURE IN TEACHING      1. Teach the rhyme.    2. Combine rhyme with the gymnastic activity.    3. Teach the song.    4. Combine No. 1, No. 2 and No. 3.      COMMANDS USED TO PRESENT THE GYMNASTIC ACTIVITY AND SONG      1. Determine key in which the song is written and find starting note.    2. Teacher sounds keynote of first syllable or word.        Command:-- Pitch-- Sing!    _Examples:_    (_a_) Yankee Doodle. The first syllable of the word, \"Yankee,\" which is  \"Yank,\" is sung to establish the pitch.    (_b_) Oh, where, oh where has my little dog gone? The first word, \"Oh,\"  is sung to establish the pitch.    3. In order to insure united action, the following command is used:        Ready-- Begin!          RHYTHMIC STEPS    _1. The Point Step, Forward:_    Point foot forward with outside edge of toes touching the floor; the  heel is raised and turned inward toward the other foot. (No weight  transference, the weight being on the stationary foot.)    _2. Closing Step, Sideward:_    Step sideward, right, maintaining the weight equally to both feet (1).  Close left foot to right (2).    NOTE.-- Counterlike for movement in the forward and backward direction.    _3. Chasse or Gliding Step, Sideward:_    Raise heels and slide sideward, right, immediately closing left to  right. A light, quick movement requiring only one count for completion.    _4. Step Throw or Step Hop Swing, Sideward:_    Step sideward, right (1). Hop on right, and swing left leg diagonally  forward across (2). (Knee slightly flexed with ankle extended.)    _5. Schottische Step, Sideward:_    Step sideward, right (1). Cross step left to rear of right (2). Step  sideward, right (3). Hop on right, swinging left leg diagonally forward  across (4). (Knee slightly flexed with ankle extended.)    _6. Two Step or Change Step, Forward:_    Step forward, right (1). Close left instep to right heel (and) Step  forward, right (2).    _7. The Step Dip, Sideward:_    Step sideward, right, with transference of body weight to the right foot  (1). Place left toe behind right heel (heel raised) with the knee turned  sideward (and) Bend and stretch right knee slightly with trunk bending  sideward, left (2).    Hand clapping occurs on counts _one_ and _two_.    _8. Encircle to left with partner kneeling._ (_Partners._)    _Stationary pupil._-- Pupil extends leg backward, lowering knee to  floor. The trunk is erect; left hand on hip with the right arm stretched  upward, supporting encircling partner's left hand.    _Dancing pupil._-- The encircling pupil grasps with the left hand the  kneeling partner's right hand and performs the dance movement in given  direction.

Lo! God hath ope'd the glist'ring gates of heaven,    And thence are streaming beams of glorious light:  All earth is bath'd in the effulgence giv'n    To dissipate the darkness of the night.  The eastern shepherds, 'biding in the fields,    O'erlook the flocks till now their constant care,  And light divine to mortal sense reveals    A seraph bright descending in the air.    Hark! strains seraphic fall upon the ear,    From shining ones around th' eternal gates:  Glad that man's load of guilt may disappear,    Infinite strength on finite weakness waits.    Why are the trembling shepherds sore afraid?    Why shrink they at the grand, the heavenly sight?  \"Fear not\" (the angel says), nor be dismay'd,    And o'er them sheds a ray of God-sent light.  O matchless mercy! All-embracing love!    The angel speaks and, gladly, men record:--  \"I bring you joyful tidings from above:    This day is born a Saviour, Christ the Lord!\"    Hark! \"Peace on earth, and God's good-will to men!\"    The angels sing, and heaven resounds with praise--  That fallen man may live with God again,    Through Christ, who deigns the sons of men to raise.    W. F. D          _CHAPTER I._    THE ORIGIN AND ASSOCIATIONS OF CHRISTMAS.      THE FIRST CHRISTMAS: THE ADVENT OF CHRIST.      Behold, a virgin shall conceive,    And bear a Son,    And shall call His name Immanuel.      (_Isaiah_ vii. 14.)      [Illustration]    Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When His mother Mary  had been betrothed to Joseph, before they came together she was found  with child of the Holy Ghost. And Joseph her husband, being a  righteous man, and not willing to make her a public example, was  minded to put her away privily. But when he thought on these things,  behold, an angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream, saying,  Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife:  for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost. And she shall  bring forth a Son; and thou shalt call His name Jesus; for it is He  that shall save His people from their sins. Now all this is come to  pass, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through  the prophet, saying,      Behold, the virgin shall be with child and shall bring forth a Son,    And they shall call His name Immanuel;    which is, being interpreted, God with us. And Joseph arose from his  sleep, and did as the angel of the Lord commanded him, and took unto  him his wife; and knew her not till she had brought forth a Son; and  he called His name Jesus.    (_Matthew_ i. 18-25.)    [Illustration: \"There went out a decree from Caesar Augustus that all the  world should be taxed. And Joseph went to be taxed with Mary his  espoused wife, being great with child.\" (_Luke_ ii. 1-5.)]    And there were shepherds in the same country abiding in the field,  and keeping watch by night over their flock. And an angel of the Lord  stood by them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them: and  they were sore afraid. And the angel said unto them, Be not afraid;  for behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be to  all the people: for there is born to you this day in the city of David  a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord. And this is the sign unto you; Ye  shall find a babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, and lying in a manger.  And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host  praising God, and saying,      Glory to God in the highest,    And on earth peace among men in whom He is well pleased.    And it came to pass, when the angels went away from them into heaven,  the shepherds said one to another, Let us now go even unto Bethlehem,  and see this thing that is come to pass, which the Lord hath made  known unto us. And they came with haste, and found both Mary and  Joseph, and the Babe lying in the manger. And when they saw it, they  made known concerning"]]]
