He pays his rent to the tick; he is practically a teetotaller; he is  tirelessly kind with the younger children, and can keep them amused  for a day on end; and, last and most urgent of all, he has made himself  equally popular with the eldest daughter, who is ready to go to church  with him tomorrow.\"    A man warmly concerned with any large theories has always a relish  for applying them to any triviality. The great specialist having  condescended to the priest's simplicity, condescended expansively. He  settled himself with comfort in his arm-chair and began to talk in the  tone of a somewhat absent-minded lecturer:    \"Even in a minute instance, it is best to look first to the main  tendencies of Nature. A particular flower may not be dead in early  winter, but the flowers are dying; a particular pebble may never be  wetted with the tide, but the tide is coming in. To the scientific eye  all human history is a series of collective movements, destructions or  migrations, like the massacre of flies in winter or the return of birds  in spring. Now the root fact in all history is Race. Race produces  religion; Race produces legal and ethical wars. There is no stronger  case than that of the wild, unworldly and perishing stock which we  commonly call the Celts, of whom your friends the MacNabs are specimens.  Small, swarthy, and of this dreamy and drifting blood, they accept  easily the superstitious explanation of any incidents, just as they  still accept (you will excuse me for saying) that superstitious  explanation of all incidents which you and your Church represent. It is  not remarkable that such people, with the sea moaning behind them  and the Church (excuse me again) droning in front of them, should put  fantastic features into what are probably plain events. You, with your  small parochial responsibilities, see only this particular Mrs MacNab,  terrified with this particular tale of two voices and a tall man out of  the sea. But the man with the scientific imagination sees, as it  were, the whole clans of MacNab scattered over the whole world, in its  ultimate average as uniform as a tribe of birds. He sees thousands  of Mrs MacNabs, in thousands of houses, dropping their little drop of  morbidity in the tea-cups of their friends; he sees--\"    Before the scientist could conclude his sentence, another and more  impatient summons sounded from without; someone with swishing skirts was  marshalled hurriedly down the corridor, and the door opened on a young  girl, decently dressed but disordered and red-hot with haste. She had  sea-blown blonde hair, and would have been entirely beautiful if her  cheek-bones had not been, in the Scotch manner, a little high in relief  as well as in colour. Her apology was almost as abrupt as a command.    \"I'm sorry to interrupt you, sir,\" she said, \"but I had to follow Father  Brown at once; it's nothing less than life or death.\"    Father Brown began to get to his feet in some disorder. \"Why, what has  happened, Maggie?\" he said.    \"James has been murdered, for all I can make out,\" answered the girl,  still breathing hard from her rush. \"That man Glass has been with him  again; I heard them talking through the door quite plain. Two separate  voices: for James speaks low, with a burr, and the other voice was high  and quavery.\"    \"That man Glass?\" repeated the priest in some perplexity.    \"I know his name is Glass,\" answered the girl, in great impatience.  \"I heard it through the door. They were quarrelling--about money, I  think--for I heard James say again and again, 'That's right, Mr Glass,'  or 'No, Mr Glass,' and then, 'Two or three, Mr Glass.' But we're talking  too much; you must come at once, and there may be time yet.\"    \"But time for what?\" asked Dr Hood, who had been studying the young  lady with marked interest. \"What is there about Mr Glass and his money  troubles that should impel such urgency?\"    \"I tried to break down the door and couldn't,\" answered the girl  shortly, \"Then I ran to the back-yard, and managed to climb on to the  window-sill that looks into the room. It was all dim, and seemed to be  empty, but I swear I saw James lying huddled up in a corner, as if he  were drugged or strangled.\"    \"This is very serious,\" said Father Brown, gathering his errant hat and  umbrella and standing up; \"in point of fact I was just putting your case  before this gentleman, and his view--\"    \"Has been largely altered,\" said the scientist gravely. \"I do not think  this young lady is so Celtic as I had supposed. As I have nothing else  to do, I will put on my hat and stroll down town with you.\"    In a few minutes all three were approaching the dreary tail of the  MacNabs' street: the girl with the stern and breathless stride of the  mountaineer, the criminologist with a lounging grace (which was  not without a certain leopard-like swiftness), and the priest at an  energetic trot entirely devoid of distinction. The aspect of this edge  of the town was not entirely without justification for the doctor's  hints about desolate moods and environments. The scattered houses stood  farther and farther apart in a broken string along the seashore; the  afternoon was closing with a premature and partly lurid twilight; the  sea was of an inky purple and murmuring ominously. In the scrappy  back garden of the MacNabs which ran down towards the sand, two black,  barren-looking trees stood up like demon hands held up in astonishment,  and as Mrs MacNab ran down the street to meet them with lean hands  similarly spread, and her fierce face in shadow, she was a little like a  demon herself. The doctor and the priest made scant reply to her shrill  reiterations of her daughter's story, with more disturbing details  of her own, to the divided vows of vengeance against Mr Glass for  murdering, and against Mr Todhunter for being murdered, or against  the latter for having dared to want to marry her daughter, and for not  having lived to do it. They passed through the narrow passage in the  front of the house until they came to the lodger's door at the back,  and there Dr Hood, with the trick of an old detective, put his shoulder  sharply to the panel and burst in the door.    It opened on a scene of silent catastrophe. No one seeing it, even for a  flash, could doubt that the room had been the theatre of some thrilling  collision between two, or perhaps more, persons. Playing-cards lay  littered across the table or fluttered about the floor as if a game had  been interrupted. Two wine glasses stood ready for wine on a side-table,  but a third lay smashed in a star of crystal upon the carpet. A few feet  from it lay what looked like a long knife or short sword, straight, but  with an ornamental and pictured handle, its dull blade just caught a  grey glint from the dreary window behind, which showed the black trees  against the leaden level of the sea. Towards the opposite corner of  the room was rolled a gentleman's silk top hat, as if it had just been  knocked off his head; so much so, indeed, that one almost looked to see  it still rolling. And in the corner behind it, thrown like a sack of  potatoes, but corded like a railway trunk, lay Mr James Todhunter,  with a scarf across his mouth, and six or seven ropes knotted round his  elbows and ankles. His brown eyes were alive and shifted alertly.    Dr Orion Hood paused for one instant on the doormat and drank in the  whole scene of voiceless violence. Then he stepped swiftly across the  carpet, picked up the tall silk hat, and gravely put it upon the head  of the yet pinioned Todhunter. It was so much too large for him that it  almost slipped down on to his shoulders.    \"Mr Glass's hat,\" said the doctor, returning with it and peering into  the inside with a pocket lens. \"How to explain the absence of Mr Glass  and the presence of Mr Glass's hat? For Mr Glass is not a careless man  with his clothes. That hat is of a stylish shape and systematically  brushed and burnished, though not very new. An old dandy, I should  think.\"    \"But, good heavens!\" called out Miss MacNab, \"aren't you going to untie  the man first?\"    \"I say 'old' with intention, though not with certainty\" continued the  expositor; \"my reason for it might seem a little far-fetched. The hair  of human beings falls out in very varying degrees, but almost always  falls out slightly, and with the lens I should see the tiny hairs in a  hat recently worn. It has none, which leads me to guess that Mr Glass is  bald. Now when this is taken with the high-pitched and querulous  voice which Miss MacNab described so vividly (patience, my dear lady,  patience), when we take the hairless head together with the tone common  in senile anger, I should think we may deduce some advance in years.  Nevertheless, he was probably vigorous, and he was almost certainly  tall. I might rely in some degree on the story of his previous  appearance at the window, as a tall man in a silk hat, but I think I  have more exact indication. This wineglass has been smashed all over  the place, but one of its splinters lies on the high bracket beside the  mantelpiece. No such fragment could have fallen there if the vessel  had been smashed in the hand of a comparatively short man like Mr  Todhunter.\"    \"By the way,\" said Father Brown, \"might it not be as well to untie Mr  Todhunter?\"    \"Our lesson from the drinking-vessels does not end here,\" proceeded the  specialist. \"I may say at once that it is possible that the man Glass  was bald or nervous through dissipation rather than age. Mr Todhunter,  as has been remarked, is a quiet thrifty gentleman, essentially an  abstainer. These cards and wine-cups are no part of his normal habit;  they have been produced for a particular companion. But, as it  happens, we may go farther. Mr Todhunter may or may not possess this  wine-service, but there is"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22305"],[0,"The Naval History of the United States.
