The Pelasgians disappeared before them, or  were incorporated with them, and their dialect became the language of  Greece.  The Hellenes considered themselves the descendants of one  common ancestor, Hellen, the son of Deucalion and Pyrrha.  To Hellen  were ascribed three sons, Dorus, Xuthus, and AEolus.  Of these Dorus  and AEolus gave their names to the DORIANS and AEOLIANS; and Xuthus;  through his two sons Ion and Achaeus, became the forefather of the  IONIANS and ACHAEANS.  Thus the Greeks accounted for the origin of the  four great divisions of their race.  The descent of the Hellenes from a  common ancestor, Hellen, was a fundamental article in the popular  faith.  It was a general practice in antiquity to invent fictitious  persons for the purpose of explaining names of which the origin was  buried in obscurity.  It was in this way that Hellen and his sons came  into being; but though they never had any real existence, the tales  about them may be regarded as the traditional history of the races to  whom they gave their names.    The civilization of the Greeks and the development of their language  bear all the marks of home growth, and probably were little affected by  foreign influence.  The traditions, however, of the Greeks would point  to a contrary conclusion.  It was a general belief among them that the  Pelasgians were reclaimed from barbarism by Oriental strangers, who  settled in the country and introduced among the rude inhabitants the  first elements of civilization.  Attica is said to have been indebted  for the arts of civilized life to Cecrops, a native of Sais in Egypt.  To him is ascribed the foundation of the city of Athens, the  institution of marriage, and the introduction of religious rites and  ceremonies.  Argos, in like manner, is said to have been founded by the  Egyptian Danaus, who fled to Greece with his fifty daughters, to escape  from the persecution of their suitors, the fifty sons of his brother  AEgyptus.  The Egyptian stranger was elected king by the natives, and  from him the tribe of the Danai derived their name, which Homer  frequently uses as a general appellation for the Greeks.  Another  colony was the one led from Asia by Pelops, from whom the southern  peninsula of Greece derived its name of Peloponnesus.  Pelops is  represented as a Phrygian, and the son of the wealthy king Tantalus.  He became king of Mycenae, and the founder of a powerful dynasty, one  of the most renowned in the Heroic age of Greece.  From him was  descended Agamemnon, who led the Grecian host against Troy.    The tale of the Phoenician colony, conducted by Cadmus, and which  founded Thebes in Boeotia, rests upon a different basis.  Whether there  was such a person as the Phoenician Cadmus, and whether he built the  town called Cadmea, which afterwards became the citadel of Thebes, as  the ancient legends relate, cannot be determined; but it is certain  that the Greeks were indebted to the Phoenicians for the art of  writing; for both the names and the forms of the letters in the Greek  alphabet are evidently derived from the Phoenician.  With this  exception the Oriental strangers left no permanent traces of their  settlements in Greece; and the population of the country continued to  be essentially Grecian, uncontaminated by any foreign elements.    The age of the heroes, from the first appearance of the Hellenes in  Thessaly to the return of the Greeks from Troy, was supposed to be a  period of about two hundred years.  These heroes were believed to be a  noble race of beings, possessing a superhuman though not a divine  nature, and superior to ordinary men in strength of body and greatness  of soul.    Among the heroes three stand conspicuously forth:  Hercules, the  national hero of Greece; Theseus, the hero of Attica; and Minos, king  of Crete, the principal founder of Grecian law and civilization.    Hercules was the son of Zeus (Jupiter) and Alcmena; but the jealous  anger of Hera (Juno) raised up against him an opponent and a master in  the person of Eurystheus at whose bidding the greatest of all heroes  was to achieve those wonderful labours which filled the whole world  with his fame.  In these are realized, on a magnificent scale, the two  great objects of ancient heroism, the destruction of physical and moral  evil, and the acquisition of wealth and power.  Such, for instance, are  the labours in which he destroys the terrible Nemean lion and Lernean  hydra, carries off the girdle of Ares from Hippolyte, queen of the  Amazons, and seizes the golden apples of the Hesperides, guarded by a  hundred-headed dragon.    Theseus was a son of AEgeus, king of Athens, and of AEthra, daughter of  Pittheus, king of Troezen.  Among his many memorable achievements the  most famous was his deliverance of Athens from the frightful tribute  imposed upon it by Minos for the murder of his son.  This consisted of  seven youths and seven maidens whom the Athenians were compelled to  send every nine years to Crete, there to be devoured by the Minotaur, a  monster with a human body and a bull's head, which Minos kept concealed  in an inextricable labyrinth.  The third ship was already on the point  of sailing with its cargo of innocent victims, when Theseus offered to  go with them, hoping to put an end for ever to the horrible tribute.  Ariadne, the daughter of Minos, became enamoured of the hero, and  having supplied him with a clue to trace the windings of the labyrinth,  Theseus succeeded in killing the monster, and in tracking his way out  of the mazy lair.  Theseus, on his return, became king of Attica, and  proceeded to lay the foundations of the future greatness of the  country.  He united into one political body the twelve independent  states into which Cecrops had divided Attica, and made Athens the  capital of the new kingdom.  He then divided the citizens into three  classes, namely, EUPATRIDAE, or nobles; GEOMORI, or husbandmen; and  DEMIURGI, or artisans.    Minos, king of Crete, whose history is connected with that of Theseus,  appears, like him, the representative of an historical and civil state  of life.  Minos is said to have received the laws of Crete immediately  from Zeus; and traditions uniformly present him as king of the sea.  Possessing a numerous fleet, he reduced the surrounding islands,  especially the Cyclades, under his dominion, and cleared the sea of  pirates.    The voyage of the Argonauts and the Trojan war were the most memorable  enterprises undertaken by collective bodies of heroes.    The Argonauts derived their name from the Argo, a ship built For the  adventurers by Jason, under the superintendence of Athena (Minerva).  They embarked in the harbour of Iolcus in Thessaly for the purpose of  obtaining the golden fleece which was preserved in AEa in Colchis, on  the eastern shores of the Black Sea, under the guardianship of a  sleepless dragon.  The most renowned heroes of the age took part in the  expedition.  Among them were Hercules and Theseus, as well as the  principal leaders in the Trojan war; but Jason is the central figure  and the real hero of the enterprise.  Upon arriving at AEa, after many  adventures, king AEtes promised to deliver to Jason the golden fleece,  provided he yoked two fire-breathing oxen with brazen feet, and  performed other wonderful deeds.  Here, also, as in the legend of  Theseus, love played a prominent part.  Medea, the daughter of AEtes,  who was skilled in magic and supernatural arts, furnished Jason with  the means of accomplishing the labours imposed upon him; and as her  father still delayed to surrender the fleece, she cast the dragon  asleep during the night, seized the fleece, and sailed away in the Argo  with her beloved Jason.    The Trojan war was the greatest of all the heroic achievements. It  formed the subject of innumerable epic poems, and has been immortalised  by the genius of Homer.  Paris, son of Priam, king of Troy, abused the  hospitality of Menelaus, king of Sparta, by carrying off his wife  Helen, the most beautiful woman of the age. All the Grecian princes  looked upon the outrage as one committed against themselves.  Responding to the call of Menelaus, they assembled in arms, elected his  brother Agamemnon, king of Mycenae, leader of the expedition, and  sailed across the AEgean in nearly 1200 ships to recover the faithless  fair one.  Several of the confederate heroes excelled Agamemnon in  fame.  Among them Achilles, chief of the Thessalian Myrmidons, stood  pre-eminent in strength, beauty, and valour; whilst Ulysses, king of  Ithaca; surpassed all the rest in the mental qualities of counsel and  eloquence.  Among the Trojans, Hector, one of the sons of Priam, was  most distinguished for heroic qualities and formed a striking contrast  to his handsome but effeminate brother Paris.  Next to Hector in valour  stood AEneas, son of Anchises and Aphrodite (Venus).  Even the gods  took part in the contest, encouraging their favourite heroes, and  sometimes fighting by their side or in their stead.    It was not till the tenth year of the war that Troy yielded to the  inevitable decree of fate; and it is this year which forms the subject  of the Iliad.  Achilles, offended by Agamemnon, abstains from the war;  and in his absence the Greeks are no match for Hector.  The Trojans  drive them back into their camp, and are already setting fire to their  ships, when Achilles gives his armour to his friend Patroclus, and  allows him to charge at the head of the Myrmidons.  Patroclus repulses  the Trojans from the ships, but the god Apollo is against him, and he  falls under the spear of Hector.  Desire to avenge the death of his  friend proves more powerful in the breast of Achilles than anger  against Agamemnon.  He appears again in the field in new and gorgeous"]]]
