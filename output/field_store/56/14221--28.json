There are about four times as many different kinds of insects  as all other kinds of animals combined. Insects vary greatly in size.  Some are as large as small birds, while others are so small that a  thousand placed in one pile would not equal the size of a pea.    Insects are commonly spoken of as \"bugs.\" This term, however, is  properly used only when referring to the one order of insects which  includes the sap and blood-sucking insects such as the chinch bug,  bed-bug, squash bug, and the like. Then too, there are many so-called  \"bugs\" which are not insects at all. Spiders, thousand-legs, crawfishes  and even earth-worms are often spoken of as bugs.      _What They Are_    [Illustration: Side view of grasshopper with wings and legs partly  removed. Note the division of the body into head, thorax, composed of  prothorax, mesothorax and metathorax, and abdomen consisting of  ring-like segments.]    Insects are variously formed, but as a rule the mature ones have three  and only three pairs of legs, one pair of feelers, one pair of large  eyes, and one or two pairs of wings. The body is divided into a head,  thorax and abdomen. The head bears the eyes, feelers and mouth, the  thorax bears the legs and wings, and the abdomen is made up of a number  of segments. The presence of wings at once decides whether or not it is  an insect, for, aside from bats and birds, insects alone have true  wings. These are the distinguishing characters of the full grown insect,  but, like birds, they hatch from eggs and while young do not always look  like their parents. When young they may take on various shapes as  caterpillars, borers, maggots, grubs, hoppers, and the like. Young  insects are often difficult to distinguish from true worms, centipedes,  snails, and such forms, but after one has collected and reared some of  the young and watched them pass through the different stages and emerge  with wings they are much more easily recognized.      _Their Principal Characteristics_    [Illustration: Face of grasshopper enlarged showing parts; ant.,  antenna; eye, compound eye; oc., ocellus or simple eye; cl., clypeus;  lbr., labrum or upper lip; mx. p., maxillary palpus; lb. p., labial  palpus; lab., labium or lower lip.]    Young insects as a rule are soft like caterpillars and maggots, while  the old ones usually have a hard body wall, similar to the beetles and  wasps. The wings are usually thin and transparent though in some cases  they are leathery or hard as in case of beetles or covered with scales  as in the butterflies. The three pairs of legs are jointed and used for  running, climbing, jumping, swimming, digging or grasping. The feelers  or antennae are usually threadlike, clubbed, or resemble a feather and  extend forward or sidewise from the head. The large eyes are compound,  being made up of many great small units which, when magnified, resemble  honey-comb. In some cases two or three small bead-like eyes may be  present besides the two large eyes. The mouth parts of insects may be  formed for chewing, as in the grasshopper, or for sucking up liquids, as  in the mosquito. The mouth of an insect is built on an entirely  different plan from our own. Chewing insects have an upper and lower lip  and between these there are two pairs of grinding jaws. These jaws are  hinged at the side of the face and when chewing they come together from  either side so as to meet in the middle of the mouth. They therefore  work sidewise rather than up and down. The mouth parts of the sucking  insects are drawn out to form a sucking tube or proboscis as in case of  the butterfly or mosquito.    [Illustration: Mouth parts of grasshopper shown in relative position;  lbr., labrum; md., mandibles; hyp., hypopharynx; max., maxillae; lab.,  labium.]    [Illustration: Leg of grasshopper showing segmentation. The basal  segment c, is the coxa, the next t, the trochanter, the large segment f,  the femur, the long slender one ti, the tibia, and the three jointed  tarsus ta, with claws at the tip.]    The internal organs of insects are similar to those of other animals.  The digestive tube consists of oesophagus, gizzard, or stomach, and  intestines. The nervous system is well developed as shown by the extreme  sensitiveness of insects to touch. The brain is comparatively small  except in the bees and ants. The circulatory system consists simply of a  long tube heart, the blood vessels being absent. In this way the  internal organs of the insect are simply bathed in the blood. The  system of respiration is most complicated. The air is taken in through  pores usually along the side of the body and is then carried through  fine tracheal tubes to all parts of the body. You cannot drown an insect  by putting its head under water, since it does not breathe through its  mouth. The muscular system is similar to that of other animals which  have the skeleton on the outside.    [Illustration: The internal organs of the honey bee. Note the strong  wing muscles in the thorax. The tube-like heart begins in the head and  extends back through the thorax and follows the curve of the abdomen.  Below the heart is the digestive tube consisting of the slender  oesophagus which extends back to the expanded honey stomach, in which  the bee carries the nectar it collects from flowers, then the curled  true stomach, the small intestine and expanded large intestine. Below  this is the nervous system consisting of the brain and a chain of  connected enlargements or ganglia extending back into the abdomen in the  lower part of the body. The respiratory system in part appears just  above the honey stomach, and the black circular or oval spots are cross  sections of connecting air tubes, which run all through the body. Also  note the sting with the poison gland and sack which are pulled out with  the sting; also the sucking tube for getting honey from flowers, and the  structures on the legs for gathering and carrying pollen; the pollen  basket is on the back side of the hind leg.]      _Their Methods of Developing_    In most cases the parent insect deposits small eggs which hatch later  into the young insects. In some cases, as with the blow-flies, the  maggot may hatch from the egg while yet in the parent's body, when the  active larva is born alive. Whether the egg hatches before or after it  is deposited, the young insect continues to develop in one of three  ways. It may resemble the parent and simply grow as does a kitten, or it  may look somewhat like its parent though smaller and without wings, as  the young grasshopper, or it may bear no resemblance whatever to the  parent, as the caterpillar which feeds and grows and finally spins a  cocoon in which it passes to the resting chrysalis stage and later  emerges with wings. The development of insects is therefore extremely  complicated.    [Illustration: The chinch bug showing development with incomplete  metamorphosis; a, egg; b, first nymph; c, second nymph; d, third nymph;  e, fourth nymph; f, adult winged bug; g, chinch bugs extracting sap from  corn plant. To control this pest burn over all winter harboring places  and use chemical or dust barriers following wheat harvest.]      _The Principal Orders_    In order to study a group of animals which includes so many thousand  different kinds it is necessary to divide them into a number of sharply  defined divisions or orders. All animal life is naturally grouped into  such divisions and subdivisions. Among the insects we at once detect  seven large, sharply defined divisions or orders, and ten or more  smaller ones. Of these we have first, the two-winged true flies; second,  the four-winged butterflies and moths; third, the hard-backed beetles;  fourth, the stinging four-winged wasps and bees; fifth, the variously  formed sucking insects or true bugs, as chinch bugs and bed-bugs; sixth,  the rapid-flying four-winged snake doctors or dragon-flies and, seventh,  the hopping forms, the grasshoppers. Besides these we have the various  smaller orders of water-loving insects, fleas, etc. The seven groups  mentioned above include the majority of our common forms and in the  studies to follow we will include only representatives from these  orders.    [Illustration: The Hessian fly showing development with complete  metamorphosis; a, egg; b, larva or maggot; c, flax-seed stage; d, pupa;  e, adult winged fly; f, wheat stubble with flax-seed stages near base  taken after harvest. To control this pest, plow under stubble after  harvest; keep down all volunteer wheat and sow wheat after fly-free date  in the fall.]      _Their Habits_    The habits of insects are as varied as their forms and adaptations. Some  live in the water all their life, others spend a part of their life  under water, others live the care-free life of the open air, others  enjoy feeding upon and living in the foulest of filth, others associate  themselves with certain definite crops or animals thereby doing untold  injury, while others produce food and other materials which are to be  used by man for his comfort. Every imaginable nook and crook, from the  depths of lakes to the tops of mountains, from the warm, sunny south to  the cold frigid north, from the foul damp swamps to the heart of our  desert lands, offers a home for some small insect.    The most striking habits and developments among insects is found in the  more highly advanced families of bees and ants where definite insect  societies are formed, resembling in many respects human societies and  human activities. Among these villages are established, homes built,  battles fought, slaves made, herds kept by shepherds, and even fields  cultivated. In these groups we have the nearest approach to human  intelligence.      _Their Role in Agriculture_    Some insects may be very destructive to crops, others are beneficial,  while the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2344"],[0,"The Adventure of the Cardboard Box (#2)"],[1,"when I have changed my dressing-gown and  filled my cigar-case.\"    A shower of rain fell while we were in the train, and the heat was far  less oppressive in Croydon than in town.  Holmes had sent on a wire, so  that Lestrade, as wiry, as dapper, and as ferret-like as ever, was  waiting for us at the station.  A walk of five minutes took us to Cross  Street, where Miss Cushing resided.    It was a very long street of two-story brick houses, neat and prim,  with whitened stone steps and little groups of aproned women gossiping  at the doors.  Halfway down, Lestrade stopped and tapped at a door,  which was opened by a small servant girl.  Miss Cushing was sitting in  the front room, into which we were ushered.  She was a placid-faced  woman, with large, gentle eyes, and grizzled hair curving down over her  temples on each side.  A worked antimacassar lay upon her lap and a  basket of coloured silks stood upon a stool beside her.    \"They are in the outhouse, those dreadful things,\" said she as Lestrade  entered.  \"I wish that you would take them away altogether.\"    \"So I shall, Miss Cushing.  I only kept them here until my friend, Mr.  Holmes, should have seen them in your presence.\"    \"Why in my presence, sir?\"    \"In case he wished to ask any questions.\"    \"What is the use of asking me questions when I tell you I know nothing  whatever about it?\"    \"Quite so, madam,\" said Holmes in his soothing way.  \"I have no doubt  that you have been annoyed more than enough already over this business.\"    \"Indeed I have, sir. I am a quiet woman and live a retired life. It is  something new for me to see my name in the papers and to find the  police in my house.  I won't have those things in here, Mr. Lestrade.  If you wish to see them you must go to the outhouse.\"    It was a small shed in the narrow garden which ran behind the house.  Lestrade went in and brought out a yellow cardboard box, with a piece  of brown paper and some string.  There was a bench at the end of the  path, and we all sat down while Homes examined one by one, the articles  which Lestrade had handed to him.    \"The string is exceedingly interesting,\" he remarked, holding it up to  the light and sniffing at it.  \"What do you make of this string,  Lestrade?\"    \"It has been tarred.\"    \"Precisely.  It is a piece of tarred twine.  You have also, no doubt,  remarked that Miss Cushing has cut the cord with a scissors, as can be  seen by the double fray on each side.  This is of importance.\"    \"I cannot see the importance,\" said Lestrade.    \"The importance lies in the fact that the knot is left intact, and that  this knot is of a peculiar character.\"    \"It is very neatly tied.  I had already made a note of that effect,\"  said Lestrade complacently.    \"So much for the string, then,\" said Holmes, smiling, \"now for the box  wrapper. Brown paper, with a distinct smell of coffee. What, did you  not observe it?  I think there can be no doubt of it.  Address printed  in rather straggling characters:  'Miss S. Cushing, Cross Street,  Croydon.'  Done with a broad-pointed pen, probably a J, and with very  inferior ink.  The word 'Croydon' has been originally spelled with an  'i', which has been changed to 'y'.  The parcel was directed, then, by  a man--the printing is distinctly masculine--of limited education and  unacquainted with the town of Croydon.  So far, so good!  The box is a  yellow, half-pound honeydew box, with nothing distinctive save two  thumb marks at the left bottom corner.  It is filled with rough salt of  the quality used for preserving hides and other of the coarser  commercial purposes.  And embedded in it are these very singular  enclosures.\"    He took out the two ears as he spoke, and laying a board across his  knee he examined them minutely, while Lestrade and I, bending forward  on each side of him, glanced alternately at these dreadful relics and  at the thoughtful, eager face of our companion.  Finally he returned  them to the box once more and sat for a while in deep meditation.    \"You have observed, of course,\" said he at last, \"that the ears are not  a pair.\"    \"Yes, I have noticed that.  But if this were the practical joke of some  students from the dissecting-rooms, it would be as easy for them to  send two odd ears as a pair.\"    \"Precisely.  But this is not a practical joke.\"    \"You are sure of it?\"    \"The presumption is strongly against it.  Bodies in the  dissecting-rooms are injected with preservative fluid.  These ears bear  no signs of this.  They are fresh, too.  They have been cut off with a  blunt instrument, which would hardly happen if a student had done it.  Again, carbolic or rectified spirits would be the preservatives which  would suggest themselves to the medical mind, certainly not rough salt.  I repeat that there is no practical joke here, but that we are  investigating a serious crime.\"    A vague thrill ran through me as I listened to my companion's words and  saw the stern gravity which had hardened his features. This brutal  preliminary seemed to shadow forth some strange and inexplicable horror  in the background. Lestrade, however, shook his head like a man who is  only half convinced.    \"There are objections to the joke theory, no doubt,\" said he, \"but  there are much stronger reasons against the other.  We know that this  woman has led a most quiet and respectable life at Penge and here for  the last twenty years.  She has hardly been away from her home for a  day during that time.  Why on earth, then, should any criminal send her  the proofs of his guilt, especially as, unless she is a most consummate  actress, she understands quite as little of the matter as we do?\"    \"That is the problem which we have to solve,\" Holmes answered, \"and for  my part I shall set about it by presuming that my reasoning is correct,  and that a double murder has been committed.  One of these ears is a  woman's, small, finely formed, and pierced for an earring.  The other  is a man's, sun-burned, discoloured, and also pierced for an earring.  These two people are presumably dead, or we should have heard their  story before now.  To-day is Friday.  The packet was posted on Thursday  morning.  The tragedy, then, occurred on Wednesday or Tuesday, or  earlier.  If the two people were murdered, who but their murderer would  have sent this sign of his work to Miss Cushing?  We may take it that  the sender of the packet is the man whom we want. But he must have some  strong reason for sending Miss Cushing this packet.  What reason then?  It must have been to tell her that the deed was done! or to pain her,  perhaps.  But in that case she knows who it is.  Does she know?  I  doubt it.  If she knew, why should she call the police in?  She might  have buried the ears, and no one would have been the wiser. That is  what she would have done if she had wished to shield the criminal.  But  if she does not wish to shield him she would give his name.  There is a  tangle here which needs straightening out.\"  He had been talking in a  high, quick voice, staring blankly up over the garden fence, but now he  sprang briskly to his feet and walked towards the house.    \"I have a few questions to ask Miss Cushing,\" said he.    \"In that case I may leave you here,\" said Lestrade, \"for I have another  small business on hand.  I think that I have nothing further to learn  from Miss Cushing.  You will find me at the police-station.\"    \"We shall look in on our way to the train,\" answered Holmes.  A moment  later he and I were back in the front room, where the impassive lady  was still quietly working away at her antimacassar.  She put it down on  her lap as we entered and looked at us with her frank, searching blue  eyes.    \"I am convinced, sir,\" she said, \"that this matter is a mistake, and  that the parcel was never meant for me at all.  I have said this  several times to the gentlemen from Scotland Yard, but he simply laughs  at me.  I have not an enemy in the world, as far as I know, so why  should anyone play me such a trick?\"    \"I am coming to be of the same opinion, Miss Cushing,\" said Holmes,  taking a seat beside her.  \"I think that it is more than probable--\" He  paused, and I was surprised, on glancing round to see that he was  staring with singular intentness at the lady's profile.  Surprise and  satisfaction were both for an instant to be read upon his eager face,  though when she glanced round to find out the cause of his silence he  had become as demure as ever.  I stared hard myself at her flat,  grizzled hair, her trim cap, her little gilt earrings, her placid  features; but I could see nothing which could account for my  companion's evident excitement.    \"There were one or two questions--\"    \"Oh, I am weary of questions!\" cried Miss Cushing impatiently.    \"You have two sisters, I believe.\"    \"How could you know that?\"    \"I observed the very instant that I entered the room that you have a  portrait group of three ladies upon the mantelpiece, one of whom is  undoubtedly yourself, while the others are so exceedingly like you that  there could be no doubt of the relationship.\"    \"Yes, you are quite right.  Those are my sisters, Sarah and Mary.\"    \"And here at my elbow is another portrait, taken at Liverpool, of your  younger sister, in the company of a man who appears to be a steward by  his uniform.  I observe that she was unmarried at the time.\"    \"You are very quick at observing.\"    \"That is my trade.\"    \"Well, you are quite right.  But she was married to Mr. Browner a few  days afterwards.  He was on the South American line when that was  taken, but he was so fond of her that he couldn't abide to leave her  for so long, and he got into the Liverpool and London boats.\"    \"Ah, the Conqueror, perhaps?\"    \"No, the May Day, when last I heard.  Jim came down here to see me  once.  That was before he broke the pledge; but afterwards he would  always take drink when he was ashore, and a little drink would send him "]]]
