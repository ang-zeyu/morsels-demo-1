To attempt, however, to trace the  story of the city as well as that of the cathedral would be to  recapitulate the most important facts of the history of England during  those centuries when Winchester was its capital town. Its civic  importance, indeed, was not dependent upon the cathedral alone, for  before the introduction of Christianity into the island Winchester was  undoubtedly the principal place in the south of England. The Roman  occupation, though it seems a mere incident in its record, lasted over  three centuries, about as long as from the reign of Henry VIII. to that  of Queen Victoria. Richard Warner (1795) sums up the various names of  Winchester when he speaks of \"the metropolis of the British Belgae,  called by Ptolemy and Antoninus Venta Belgarum; by the Welch or modern  Britons, Caer Gwent; and by the old Saxons, Wintancester; by the Latin  writers, Wintonia\" (\"Collections for the History of Hampshire\").    Even, therefore, when we read the account of the legendary king of the  Britons, Lucius, founding a great church at Winchester in A.D. 164, we  do not touch the source of its fame, nor have we discovered the record  of the first building devoted to religious worship on the site of the  present cathedral. How far certain references to early pagan temples may  be trusted does not here concern us; but at Christchurch Priory, some  thirty-five miles to the south-west in the same diocese, bones \"supposed  to be those of sacrificial birds\" have been exhumed on the site of its  church. There was, however, a relapse into paganism after the first  dedication of the Christian building, so that there can be no certainty  about the date of such discoveries.    On the authority of Vigilantius' \"_De Basilica Petri_\" (_i.e._ at Wynton  or Winchester), quoted by Rudborne in \"_Anglia Sacra_,\" John of Exeter,  and other writers, we have it that a great church was rebuilt from its  foundations at Caergwent by Lucius after his conversion in A.D. 164; and  that he erected also smaller buildings with an oratory, refectory, and  dormitory for the temporary abode of the monks until the monastery  itself should be completed. Quotations from another lost author,  Moracius, provide us with the dimensions of this edifice, the length  being variously given as 209 and 200 _passus_, the breadth as 80 and  130, while the tower was 92 _passus_ in height. This church, it was  said, was dedicated to S. Saviour in November 169, and endowed with  property formerly held by the pagan priests. \"The site of the monastery  to the east of the church was 100 _passus_ in length toward the old  temple of Concord and 40 in breadth to the new temple of Apollo. The  north position was 160 in length and 98 in breadth. To the west of the  church it was 90 in length and 100 in breadth, to the south 405 in  length and 580 in breadth.\" Willis, from whom the above dimensions are  quoted, does not attempt to reconcile the figures except in so far as he  suggests _pedes_ for _passus_, substituting one foot for five. During  the persecution of the Christians by Diocletian in A.D. 266 the  buildings were destroyed; and the new church, dedicated to \"S.  Amphibalus,\" who was said to be one of the martyrs in that persecution,  was not so large as its predecessor. In writers of the period we find  occasional references to the \"Vetus Coenobium\" or old monastery at  Winchester. The new building was not destined to remain long undisturbed  in the service for which it was intended, for when Cerdic, King of the  West Saxons, was crowned at Winchester and the pagans once more gained  the ascendancy, the monks were slaughtered and the church, devoted to  other rites, remained a temple of \"Dagon\" from 516 to 635. In the latter  year S. Birinus, in pursuance of his mission from Honorius to \"scatter  the seeds of the holy faith in those farthest inland territories of the  English which no teacher had yet visited,\" converted King Cynegils to  Christianity. This king intended to erect a great new church, and, with  that end in view, destroyed the desecrated building and granted the law  for seven miles round to the monks whom he destined to take possession  of the new building. He died, however, within six years of his  conversion, and was buried before the altar of the partly-erected  church. His son Cenwalh therefore completed the building, which S.  Birinus dedicated to Christ in honour of the Holy and Indivisible  Trinity. Birinus was followed by Aegelberht, afterwards Bishop of Paris,  who resigned in 662; Wina, who died as Bishop of London, ejected in 666;  and Eleutherius, who died in 676.    So far the see was not at Winchester, but was temporarily placed at  Dorchester in Oxfordshire. Under Hedda, the fourth successor of S.  Birinus, the seat was at last moved to Winchester, in accordance with  the intention of the royal founder, and at the same time the body of the  saint, which had hitherto rested at Dorchester, was removed to the  cathedral city. King Cenwalh himself also on his death was buried in the  building which he had completed.    Practically nothing is known of the actual Saxon building, and the very  legends are scanty. We learn that the city was ravaged by the Danes two  years after the death of S. Swithun, but the cathedral itself appears  fortunately to have escaped damage.    The bishopric of Athelwold, commencing with his consecration by Dunstan  on November 29, A.D. 963, has more importance in the history of the  cathedral than that of his immediate predecessors. He was chosen by King  Edgar to undertake the work of a new monastery in which the king took  such pleasure that he is said to have measured the foundations himself.  This work carried out at Winchester by Athelwold is described at great  length in a Latin poem by Wolstan. No doubt the florid eulogy of the  poem is open to grave suspicion where it concerns the details of the  building, but, even when we make full allowance for poetic exaggeration,  the church appears certainly to have been a large and important one. The  poem in its first form is reproduced in Mabillon's version of Wolstan's  \"Life of S. Athelwold,\" but in its entirety it consists of an epistle of  over 300 lines to Bishop Elphege Athelwold's successor. Some passages  deserve quotation. \"He built,\" says Wolstan, \"all these dwelling places  with strong walls. He covered them with roofs and clothed them with  beauty. He repaired the courts of the old temple with lofty walls and  new roofs and strengthened it at the north and south sides with solid  aisles and various arches. He added also many chapels, with sacred  altars which distract attention from the threshold of the church, so  that the stranger walking in the courts is at a loss where to turn,  seeing on all sides doors open to him, without a certain path. He stands  with wondering eyes until some experienced guide conducts him to the  portals of the farthest vestibule. Here marvelling he crosses himself  and knows not how to quit, so dazzling is the construction and so  brilliant the variety of the fabric that sustains this ancient church,  which that devout father himself strengthened, roofed, endowed, and  dedicated.\" Later Wolstan speaks of Athelwold's addition of \"secret  crypts,\" of \"such organs that the like were never seen,\" of a sparkling  tower reflecting from heaven the sun's first rays, \"with at its top a  rod with golden balls and a mighty golden cock which as it turns boldly  sets its face to every wind that blows.\" More might be quoted, but it is  sufficient here to refer those interested in the matter either to the  chronicle itself or to Willis in the \"Proceedings of the Architectural  Institute\" for 1845. Though Wolstan thus describes Athelwold's  undertaking at great length, it does not appear that the bishop actually  did more than commence the restoration of the original buildings, for  his successor is exhorted in the letter to carry out Athelwold's design.  The chronicler Rudborne makes mention only of the dedication of a  minster in honour of the Apostles Peter and Paul, in the presence of  King Aethelred, Archbishop Dunstan and eight other bishops, on October  20, 980 A.D. John of Exeter ascribes to Athelwold the entire rebuilding  of the cathedral, but the Winchester annalist does not mention  Athelwold's great works.    From Athelwold's death to the succession of Walkelin the history of the  cathedral is little more than a record of its bishops; but with Walkelin  we reach a very important epoch in its existence. In 1079, the  Winchester Annals relate, this bishop began to rebuild the cathedral  from its very foundations, as was commonly done by the Norman  ecclesiastics of the time. According to this account, it was in 1086  that the king granted Walkelin, for the completion of his new building,  as much wood from the forest of Hempage (three miles distant from the  city on the Alresford road) as he could cut in four days and nights.  Walkelin collected all the men he could, and within the given time  removed the whole forest. The king, passing its site, cried: \"Am I  bewitched? or have I taken leave of my senses?\" But the bishop, when he  heard of his anger, pleaded to be allowed to resign the see if he might  but keep the chaplaincy and the king's favour. At this William relented,  saying: \"I was as much too liberal in my grant as you were too greedy in  availing yourself of it\" (Willis). In 1093 the new church was formally  consecrated, and on April 8, \"in the presence of almost all the bishops  and abbots of England, the monks came with the highest exultation and  glory from the old minster to the new one: on the Feast of S. Swithun  they went in procession from the new minster to the old one and brought  thence S. Swithun's shrine and placed it with honour in the new  buildings; and on the following day Bishop Walkelin's men first began to  pull down"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20348"],[0,"The Moving Picture Girls in War Plays (#2)"],[1,"every day.\"    \"What's that? An account of what? Have the papers been missing  anything?\" asked a deep, vibrating voice, and an elderly man came into  the girls' room and regarded them smilingly.    \"Oh, hello, Daddy!\" cried Alice, blowing him a kiss. \"I'm almost ready.\"    \"Hum, yes! You look it!\" and he laughed.    \"It's this, Daddy,\" went on Ruth, holding out the paper. \"We were going  to wrap Alice's muddy shoes in this sheet, when we happened to notice an  account of the mysterious disappearance of a Mildred Passamore, of San  Francisco, for whom ten thousand dollars reward is offered. There has  been nothing in the New York papers about it.\"    Mr. DeVere, an old-time actor, and now employed, with his daughters, by  a large motion picture concern, reached forth his hand for the paper.  He gave one look at the article, and then his eyes went up to the  date-line. He laughed.    \"No wonder there hasn't been anything in the New York papers of to-day  about this case,\" he said. \"This paper is four years old! But I remember  the Passamore case very well. It created quite a sensation at the time.\"    \"Poor girl! Was she ever found?\" asked Ruth.    \"Why, yes; I believe she was,\" said Mr. DeVere, in rather dreamy tones.  He was looking over other articles in the paper.    \"Who got the reward?\" asked Alice.    \"Eh? What's that?\" Her father seemed to come back from a mental journey  to the past.    \"I say, who got the reward?\"    \"What reward?\"    \"Why, Daddy! The one offered for the finding of Miss Passamore. The girl  we just told you about--in the paper--ten thousand dollars. Don't you  remember?\"    \"Oh, yes. I was thinking of something else I just read here. Oh, the  reward! Well, I suppose the police got it. I don't remember, to tell you  the truth. I know that her disappearance at the time created quite a  sensation.\"    \"And are you sure she was found?\"    \"Oh, yes, quite sure. Look here!\" and with a smile on his face he  leaned forward, one rather fat finger pointing to the article he had  just been reading. \"I was wondering how you girls got hold of this old  back-number paper, but I see it's one of several I saved because they  had printed notices of my acting. This is a very good and fair criticism  of my work when I was appearing in Shakespearian drama--a very fair  notice, ahem!\" and Mr. DeVere leaned back in his chair, a gratified  smile on his face.    \"A fair notice! I should say it was!\" laughed Alice. \"It does nothing  but praise you, and says the others offered you miserable support.\"    \"Well, it was fair to _me_,\" said Mr. DeVere. \"Yes, I remember that tour  very well. We were in California at the time of this Miss Passamore's  disappearance. Helen Gordon was my leading lady then. Ah, yes, that was  four years ago.\"    \"No wonder there wasn't anything in to-day's New York papers,\" said  Alice. \"Well, let me wrap up my shoes, and I'll try to have this packing  done in time to get out to Oak Farm.\"    \"Yes, I just stopped in to see how you were coming on,\" put in her  father. \"Mr. Pertell wants to get started, and it won't do to disappoint  him. There are to be several thousand men and horses in the production,  and the bill for extras will be heavy.\"    \"I'll hustle along, Daddy!\" cried Alice. \"Do you want that paper?\"    \"No, you may take it. I'll just tear out this page with the theatrical  notice of myself.\"    He handed the remainder of the paper to his daughter, who, with the help  of her sister, wrapped up the muddy shoes.    Then the girls proceeded with the putting in of other articles and  garments that would be needed during their stay at Oak Farm.    \"I wonder----\" began Alice, when there came a knock on their door, and a  voice demanded:    \"I say, girls!--are you there?\"    \"Yes, Russ. Come on in!\" answered Alice.    \"Oh, and with the room looking the way it is!\" remonstrated Ruth.    \"Can't be helped. Russ knows what packing is,\" Alice declared, as a  tall, good-looking young man entered.    \"Come on!\" he cried. \"No time to lose.\"    \"What's the matter? Is the place on fire?\" asked Ruth.    \"No. But there's got to be a retake in that last scene of 'Only a  Flivver,' and Mr. Pertell sent me to get you. It won't take long, but  they're in a hurry for it. Come on! Paul is waiting outside in the  machine and I've got the camera. Hustle!\"          CHAPTER II    OFF FOR OAK FARM      \"What's that, Russ? A retake?\" asked Alice.    \"Yes, of that auto scene in the park.\"    \"Is that the one I'm in?\" Ruth inquired.    \"Yes. You're both in it, and so is Paul. It's the scene where Mr. Bunn  is struck by the auto mud-guard--not hurt, you know, and you, Ruth, jump  out to give first aid.\"    \"What's the matter with the scene?\" asked Alice. \"I certainly struck him  all right with the mud-guard.\"    \"Yes, that part was all right,\" Russ admitted. Alice had been running  the automobile in the scene.    \"And didn't I do my first aid business well?\" Ruth demanded.    \"Yes,\" Russ acknowledged. \"Your part came out perfect. But just at the  critical moment--you know, where Mr. Bunn was supposed to think he was  dying and wanted to right the wrong he had done in cutting his daughter  off in his will with only a dollar--some boys got in the way of the  camera. They were outsiders, butting in, the way they always do when we  film stuff in the park. It wouldn't have been so bad, only one of the  youngsters began to pull off some funny stuff right in range of Mr.  Bunn's agonized face. I didn't see him at the time, or I'd have stopped  the running of the film. It was only when we got it in the projection  room that we discovered it.    \"So Mr. Pertell ordered a retake of that one scene, and it's got to be  done in a hurry. It won't take long. Mr. Bunn will meet us in the park.  Be sure and wear the same things you had on that day. It won't do to  have you get out of the auto in one dress, Ruth, and, a second later,  kneel down beside Mr. Bunn in a gown entirely different.\"    \"All right, Russ, I'll be careful.\"    \"Oh, dear! But my packing!\" sighed Alice. \"I'll never get it done, and  we must start for Oak Farm----\"    \"Mr. Pertell will have to make allowances,\" said Russ, quickly. \"Come  on--move the boat! You won't be needed in the real war scenes for a  couple of days, anyhow, though I suppose there'll be rehearsals. But it  can't be helped. This retake is holding up the whole film, and it's to  be released next week.\"    Delaying only long enough to put on the proper dresses and to tell their  father where they were going, Ruth and Alice DeVere were soon on their  way to Central Park, where the scene was to be filmed, or photographed  over again--a \"retake,\" as it is called, the bane alike of camera men  and directors.    And while the girls--the moving picture girls--are on their way to do  over a bit of work, I shall take the opportunity of telling my new  readers something about Ruth and Alice DeVere.    I have called them just what they are: \"The Moving Picture Girls,\" and  that is the title of the first volume of this series, which depicts them  and their adventures.    Their mother had died some years previously, leaving them to the care of  their father, Hosmer DeVere, at one time a talented actor in the  legitimate drama. But a throat affection forced him to give up his  acting and, at the opening scene in the first volume, we find him and  his daughters in rather straitened circumstances, living in a  second-rate apartment house in New York.    Across the hall dwelt Russ Dalwood, with his mother. Russ was a \"camera  man.\" That is, he took moving pictures in the big studios and out of  doors for the Comet Film Company, of which Mr. Frank Pertell was manager  and director.    It was Russ who suggested to Mr. DeVere a way out of his troubles. He  could not act in the \"legitimate,\" as his voice was gone; but no voice  is needed to appear on the films for the movies, since a mere motion of  the lips suffices, when any speaking is to be done. The \"silent drama\"  has been the salvation of many an actor who, if he had to declaim his  lines, would be a failure.    At first Mr. DeVere would not hear of acting before the camera, but he  soon came to know that greater actors than he had fallen in line with  the work, especially since the pay was so large, and finally he  consented. An account of his success and of the entrance of his  daughters into the field is given in the initial book.    Ruth, the elder girl, was, like her father, of a romantic turn. Also she  was rather tall and willowy, as Mr. DeVere had been before he had taken  on flesh with the passing of the years; and she was cast for parts that  suited her type. She was deliberate in her actions, and in \"registry.\"    Alice, like her late mother, was warm-hearted and impulsive, plump,  vivacious and full of fun. Both girls were excellent movie actresses. In  the company they had joined was Mr. Wellington Bunn, an old actor, who  hoped, some day, to appear in Hamlet--Hamlet in the legitimate.    Paul Ardite, who played light parts, had become very fond of Alice.  Russ Dalwood had a liking for Ruth, and the four had many pleasant hours  in each other's company.    Pearl Pennington was the leading lady at times, and was rather disposed  to domineer over our girls, as was her chum, Laura Dixon. Mrs. Maguire  was the \"mother\" of the film company. She portrayed old lady parts, and  her two grandchildren, Tommie and Nellie, the orphans, were cast for  characters suitable to them.    Carl Switzer, a German-American, did comedy parts and was a good fellow,  though occasionally he would unconsciously say some very funny things.  His opposite in character was Pepper Sneed, the grouch of the company.  But Pepper could do valuable work, especially as a villain, and so he  was kept on. As for Pop Snooks, the company could not have got along  without him. It was Pop, the property man of the company, who made many  of the devices used when the company"]]]
