And when the mountain top gleamed like a golden spear, they fixed their  eyes on the line between the shadow and the sunshine.    \"Now,\" said Connla, \"the time has come.\"    \"Oh, look! look!\" said Nora, and as she spoke, just above the line of  shadow a door opened out, and through its portals came a little piper  dressed in green and gold. He stepped down, followed by another and  another, until they were nine in all, and then the door slung back  again. Down through the heather marched the pipers in single file, and  all the time they played a music so sweet that the birds, who had gone  to sleep in their nests, came out upon the branches to listen to them,  and then they crossed the meadow, and they went on and on until they  disappeared in the leafy woods.    While they were passing the children were spellbound, and couldn't  speak, but when the music had died away in the woods, they said:    \"The thrush is right, that is the sweetest music that was ever heard  in all the world.\"    And when the children went to bed that night the fairy music came to  them in their dreams. But when the morning broke, and they looked out  upon their mountain and could see no trace of the door above the  heather, they asked each other whether they had really seen the little  pipers, or only dreamt of them.    That day they went out into the woods, and they sat beside a stream that  pattered along beneath the trees, and through the leaves tossing in the  breeze the sun flashed down upon the streamlet, and shadow and sunshine  danced upon it. As the children watched the water sparkling where the  sunlight fell, Nora said:    \"Oh, Connla, did you ever see anything so bright and clear and glancing  as that?\"    \"No,\" said Connla, \"I never did.\"    \"That's because you never saw the crystal hall of the fairy of the  mountains,\" said a voice above the heads of the children.    And when they looked up, who should they see perched on a branch but the  thrush.    \"And where is the crystal hall of the fairy?\" said Connla.    \"Oh, it is where it always was, and where it always will be,\" said the  thrush. \"And you can see it if you like.\"    \"We would like to see it,\" said the children.    \"Well, then,\" said the thrush, \"if you would, all you have to do is to  follow the nine little pipers when they come down through the heather,  and cross the meadow to-morrow evening.\"    And the thrush having said this, flew away.    Connla and Nora went home, and that night they fell asleep talking of  the thrush and the fairy and the crystal hall.    All the next day they counted the minutes, until they saw the shadows  thronging from the glen and scaling the mountain side. And, at last,  they saw the door springing open, and the nine little pipers marching  down.    They waited until the pipers had crossed the meadow and were about to  enter the wood. And then they followed them, the pipers marching on  before them and playing all the time. It was not long until they had  passed through the wood, and then, what should the children see rising  up before them but another mountain, smaller than their own, but, like  their own, clad more than half way up with purple heather, and whose  top was bare and sharp-pointed, and gleaming like a golden spear.    Up through the heather climbed the pipers, up through the heather the  children clambered after them, and the moment the pipers passed the  heather a door opened and they marched in, the children following, and  the door closed behind them.    Connla and Nora were so dazzled by the light that hit their eyes, when  they had crossed the threshold, that they had to shade them with their  hands; but, after a moment or two, they became able to bear the  splendor, and when they looked around they saw that they were in a noble  hall, whose crystal roof was supported by two rows of crystal pillars  rising from a crystal floor; and the walls were of crystal, and along  the walls were crystal couches, with coverings and cushions of sapphire  silk with silver tassels.    Over the crystal floor the little pipers marched; over the crystal floor  the children followed, and when a door at the end of the hall was opened  to let the pipers pass, a crowd of colors came rushing in, and floor,  and ceiling, and stately pillars, and glancing couches, and shining  walls, were stained with a thousand dazzling hues.    Out through the door the pipers marched; out through the door the  children followed, and when they crossed the threshold they were  treading on clouds of amber, of purple, and of gold.    \"Oh, Connla,\" said Nora, \"we have walked into the sunset!\"    And around and about them everywhere were soft, fleecy clouds, and over  their heads was the glowing sky, and the stars were shining through it,  as a lady's eyes shine through a veil of gossamer. And the sky and stars  seemed so near that Connla thought he could almost touch them with his  hand.    When they had gone some distance, the pipers disappeared, and when  Connla and Nora came up to the spot where they had seen the last of  them, they found themselves at the head of a ladder, all the steps of  which were formed of purple and amber clouds that descended to what  appeared to be a vast and shining plain, streaked with purple and gold.  In the spaces between the streaks of gold and purple they saw soft,  milk-white stars. And the children thought that the great plain, so far  below them, also belonged to cloudland.    They could not see the little pipers, but up the steps was borne by  the cool, sweet air the fairy music; and lured on by it step by step  they traveled down the fleecy stairway. When they were little more  than halfway down there came mingled with the music a sound almost  as sweet--the sound of waters toying in the still air with pebbles  on a shelving beach, and with the sound came the odorous brine of the  ocean. And then the children knew that what they thought was a plain in  the realms of cloudland was the sleeping sea unstirred by wind or tide,  dreaming of the purple clouds and stars of the sunset sky above it.    When Connla and Nora reached the strand they saw the nine little pipers  marching out towards the sea, and they wondered where they were going  to. And they could hardly believe their eyes when they saw them stepping  out upon the level ocean as if they were walking upon the land; and away  the nine little pipers marched, treading the golden line cast upon the  waters by the setting sun. And as the music became fainter and fainter  as the pipers passed into the glowing distance, the children began to  wonder what was to become of themselves. Just at that very moment they  saw coming towards them from the sinking sun a little white horse, with  flowing mane and tail and golden hoofs. On the horse's back was a little  man dressed in shining green silk. When the horse galloped on to the  strand the little man doffed his hat, and said to the children:    \"Would you like to follow the nine little pipers?\" The children said,  \"yes.\"    \"Well, then,\" said the little man, \"come up here behind me; you, Nora,  first, and Connla after.\"    Connla helped up Nora, and then climbed on to the little steed himself;  and as soon as they were properly seated the little man said \"swish,\"  and away went the steed, galloping over the sea without wetting hair or  hoof. But fast as he galloped the nine little pipers were always ahead  of him, although they seemed to be going only at a walking pace. When  at last he came up rather close to the hindmost of them the nine little  pipers disappeared, but the children heard the music playing beneath  the waters. The white steed pulled up suddenly, and wouldn't move a  step further.    \"Now,\" said the little man to the children, \"clasp me tight, Nora, and  do you, Connla, cling on to Nora, and both of you shut your eyes.\"    The children did as they were bidden, and the little man cried:    \"Swish! swash!\"    And the steed went down and down until at last his feet struck the  bottom.    \"Now open your eyes,\" said the little man.    And when the children did so they saw beneath the horse's feet a golden  strand, and above their heads the sea like a transparent cloud between  them and the sky. And once more they heard the fairy music, and marching  on the strand before them were the nine little pipers.    \"You must get off now,\" said the little man, \"I can go no farther  with you.\"    The children scrambled down, and the little man cried \"swish,\" and  himself and the steed shot up through the sea, and they saw him no more.  Then they set out after the nine little pipers, and it wasn't long until  they saw rising up from the golden strand and pushing their heads up  into the sea above, a mass of dark gray rocks. And as they were gazing  at them they saw the rocks opening, and the nine little pipers  disappearing through them.    The children hurried on, and when they came up close to the rocks they  saw sitting on a flat and polished stone a mermaid combing her golden  hair, and singing a strange sweet song that brought the tears to their  eyes, and by the mermaid's side was a little sleek brown otter.    When the mermaid saw them she flung her golden tresses back over her  snow-white shoulders, and she beckoned the children to her. Her large  eyes were full of sadness; but there was a look so tender upon her face  that the children moved towards her without any fear.    \"Come to me, little one,\" she said to Nora, \"come and kiss me,\" and in a  second her arms were around the child. The mermaid kissed her again and  again; as the tears rushed to her eyes, she said:    \"Oh, Nora, mavourneen, your breath is as sweet as the wild rose that  blooms in the green fields of Erin, and happy are you, my children, who  have come so lately from the pleasant land. Oh, Connla! Connla!

THE REVENGE OF THE MOORS.      For more than three centuries the trading nations of Europe were  suffered to pursue their commerce or forced to abandon their gains at  the bidding of pirates. From the days when Barbarossa defied the whole  strength of the Emperor Charles V., to the early part of the present  century, when prizes were taken by Algerine rovers under the guns, so  to say, of all the fleets of Europe, the Corsairs were masters of the  narrow seas, and dictated their own terms to all comers. Nothing but  the creation of the large standing navies of the present age crippled  them; nothing less than the conquest of their too convenient coasts  could have thoroughly suppressed them. During those three centuries  they levied blackmail upon all who had any trading interest in the  Mediterranean. The Venetians, Genoese, Pisans in older days; the  English, French, Dutch, Danish, Swedish, and American Governments in  modern times, purchased security by the payment of a regular tribute,  or by the periodical presentation of costly gifts. The penalty of  resistance was too well known to need exemplification; thousands of  Christian slaves in the bagnios at Algiers bore witness to the  consequences of an independent policy. So long as the nations of  Europe continued to quarrel among themselves, instead of presenting a  united line of battle to the enemy, such humiliations had to be  endured; so long as a Corsair raid upon Spain suited the policy of  France; so long as the Dutch, in their jealousy of other states, could  declare that Algiers was necessary to them; there was no chance of the  plague subsiding; and it was not till the close of the great  Napoleonic wars that the Powers agreed, at the Congress of  Aix-la-Chapelle in 1818, to act together, and do away with the scourge  of Christendom. And even then little was accomplished till France  combined territorial aggrandizement with the _role_ of a civilizing  influence.    [Illustration: GALLEON OF THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY.
