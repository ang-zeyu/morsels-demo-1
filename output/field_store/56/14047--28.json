enumerated above, the  supernaturalists are agreed and are making their last stand.    The secularists, the opinion of the theists to the contrary, are also  agreed. It matters not what a man calls his mental process; be he  infidel, sceptic, rationalist, agnostic, or atheist; he is firm in the  conviction that religions of all varieties are rapidly sinking into the  limbo of all other ancient superstitions. To him it is but a matter of  time for the inevitable crumbling and disappearance of these  superstitions, and the time involved is directly proportional to the  ease and rapidity with which scientific knowledge is disseminated to men  who have the mental capacity to understand the value of this knowledge  and its utter destruction of all forms of supernaturalism. When man  becomes fully cognizant of the fact that all the knowledge acquired by  the human race has been the result of human inquiry, the result of  reasoning processes, and the exercise of mind alone, then secularism  will have overcome the long night of supernaturalism. And it is this  mental attitude of secularism that proceeds with an ever accelerated  rapidity to overcome the problems that confront humanity by substituting  human inquiry for divine revelation. Thus this attitude of man to  proceed through life dependent only on his own resources will expand and  strengthen his mentality by doing away with the inferiority complex of  the God-idea. This vision of man, the master of his own destinies, the  searcher for truth and the shaper of a better life for the only  existence that he knows anything about, this reliance of _man upon man_,  and without the supposed interference of any god, constitutes atheism in  its broadest and true sense.    Science and reason, the constituents of secularism, are the mortal  enemies of supernaturalism. Secularism, however, is at a disadvantage at  this stage of our mental development, since it is approached only by the  calm light of the intellect. And intellect can but make an appeal to  reason. If the seeds of these appeals fall on the fertile minds of  mentally advanced humanity, they will flourish; if they fall on the  barren ground of creed-bound minds, they take no root. Recognition of  facts and honest deductions are not natural to the human mind. As far as  religious matters are concerned, the vast majority of men have not  reached a mental maturity; they are still in the infantile state where  they have not as yet learned that the sequences of events are not to be  interrupted by their desires. The easier path lies in the giving way to  the unstable emotions. The primitive instincts are for emotion and for  loose imaginings, and these are the provinces of supernaturalism.    Supernaturalism arouses the stupid interests and the brutish passions,  and from these are born the bitter fruits of ignorance and hatred. The  secularist is one in whom the intellect is passionate, and the passions  cold. The supernaturalist on the other hand reverses the order, and in  him the passions are active and the intellect inert. In each man there  dwells a tyrant who creates for him a deity materialized out of these  factors of ignorance and fear. It is science and reason which must  destroy for him this monstrous apparition. But, as yet, there is no  indication that our mental development in relation to social progress  has made the great strides that our purely material progress has made.  The twentieth century man utilizes and enjoys the material benefits of  his century, but his mental progress lies bound and drugged by the  viewpoints of 2000 years ago.    Sir Leslie Stephen has declared, \"How much intellect and zeal runs to  waste in the spasmodic efforts of good men to cling to the last fragment  of decaying systems, to galvanize dead formulae into some dim semblance  of life! Society will not improve as it might when those who should be  leaders of progress are staggering backward and forward with their eyes  passionately reverted to the past. Nay, we shall never be duly sensitive  to the miseries and cruelties which make the world a place of torture  for so many, so long as men are encouraged in the name of religion to  look for a remedy, not in fighting against surrounding evils, but in  cultivating aimless contemplations of an imaginary ideal. Much of our  popular religion seems to be expressly directed to deaden our sympathies  with our fellow men by encouraging an indolent optimism; our thoughts of  the other world are used in many forms as an opiate to drug our minds  with indifference to the evils of this; and the last word of half of our  preachers is, 'dream rather than work.'\"    There is always a great deal of discrepancy between that which is best  for the gods and that which is best for the individual and for society  in general. One cannot serve man perfectly and the traditional gods as  well. It is, therefore, the contention of freethinkers that if man had  given to the service of man all that he had given to the gods in the  past, our present stage of civilization would be much in advance of  where it is today.    If there is anything in the discussion to follow that may seem  irreverent to the reader, the author wishes to call attention that he  has but presented well substantiated facts. It is not only his opinion  that he is voicing, but it is the facts as he has found them recorded in  the researches of numerous sincere men. Finally, it is the conviction of  all freethinkers that, as Professor James H. Leuba has stated, \"It is,  furthermore, essential to intellectual and moral advances that the  beliefs that come into existence should have free play. Antagonistic  beliefs must have the chance of proving their worth in open contest. It  is this way scientific theories are tested, and in this way also,  religious and ethical conceptions should be tried. But a fair struggle  cannot take place when people are dissuaded from seeking knowledge, or  when knowledge is hidden.\"    The cultivation of the intellect is a duty that is imposed on all men.  Even those who still cling to the dying beliefs must admit the force of  what Winwood Reade said, \"To cultivate the intellect is therefore a  religious duty; and when this truth is fairly recognized by men, the  religion which teaches that the intellect should be distrusted and that  it should be subservient to faith, will inevitably fall.\"    When the principles of freethought shall have dispelled the intellectual  cloud of the God-idea and the vanishing dream of a heaven which has too  long drawn men's eyes away from this earth, then, and then only, will  these words of Cicero have widespread meaning:    \"Men were born for the sake of men, that each should assist the  others.\"          THE NECESSITY OF ATHEISM          CHAPTER I    THE EVOLUTION OF RELIGIOUS BELIEFS        _To early man, the gods were real in the same sense that the      mountains, forests, or waterfalls which were thought to be their      homes were real. For a long time the spirits that lived in drugs or      wines and made them potent were believed to be of the same order of      fact as the potency itself. But the human creature is curious and      curiosity is bold. Hence, the discovery that a reported god may be a      myth._        MAX CARL OTTO.      The geologists estimate that the age of the earth is somewhere between  80 and 800 millions of years; that the Neanderthal race existed for more  than 200,000 years; that between 40,000 and 25,000 years ago, as the  Fourth Glacial Period softened towards more temperate conditions, a  different human type came upon the scene and exterminated Homo  Neanderthalensis. These first \"true men\" descended from some more  ape-like progenitors and are classed by ethnologists with the same  species as ourselves, and with all human races subsequent to them under  one common, specific term, Homo Sapiens.    The age of cultivation began with the neolithic phase of human affairs  about 10,000 or 12,000 years ago; about 6000 or 7000 years ago men began  to gather into the first towns and to develop something more than the  loose-knit tribes which had hitherto been their highest political  organization. Altogether, there must have elapsed about 500,000 years  from the earliest ape-like human stage of life on this planet to the  present time.    It necessarily follows that the age of our present civilization is by no  means that which the Bible stipulates, but is merely an atom in the vast  space-time of this earth. The reason for this disparity is that with the  development of the mind of man throughout the ages there was conceived  also his self-made religious systems, based on a subjective  interpretation of the universe, and not on an objective one, devoid of  emotional bias.    \"Primitive man did not understand the natural cause of shadows, echoes,  the birth and death of vegetable and animal organisms. Of this ignorance  religion was born, and theology was evolved as its art of expression.\"  (_Draper._)    Our story takes us back some twelve thousand years to neolithic man.  Squatting in his rude hovel or gloomy cave, he listens to the sounds of  a storm without. The howling of the wind, the flashes of lightning, and  crashing of thunder give rise to that elemental emotion--fear. Fear was  always with him, as he thought of the huge stones that fell and crushed  him, and the beasts which were so eager to devour him. All things about  him seemed to conspire for his death: the wind, lightning, thunder, rain  and storm, as well as the beasts and falling trees; for in his mind he  did not differentiate animate from inanimate objects. Slowly, through  his groping mind there evolved the thought, due to past experience, that  he could not contend with these things by physical force, but must  subdue them with magic; his magic consisted of the beating of crude  drum-like instruments, dances, and the mumbling of words.
