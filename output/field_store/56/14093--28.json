She conceived him  as rich, but as fearfully extravagant--saw him all in a glow of high  fashion, of good looks, of expensive habits, of charming ways with  women. He had for his own town residence a big house filled with the  spoils of travel and the trophies of the chase; but it was to his  country home, an old family place in Essex, that he wished her  immediately to proceed.    He had been left, by the death of their parents in India, guardian to  a small nephew and a small niece, children of a younger, a military  brother, whom he had lost two years before. These children were, by the  strangest of chances for a man in his position--a lone man without the  right sort of experience or a grain of patience--very heavily on his  hands. It had all been a great worry and, on his own part doubtless, a  series of blunders, but he immensely pitied the poor chicks and had done  all he could; had in particular sent them down to his other house, the  proper place for them being of course the country, and kept them there,  from the first, with the best people he could find to look after them,  parting even with his own servants to wait on them and going down  himself, whenever he might, to see how they were doing. The awkward  thing was that they had practically no other relations and that his  own affairs took up all his time. He had put them in possession of Bly,  which was healthy and secure, and had placed at the head of their little  establishment--but below stairs only--an excellent woman, Mrs. Grose,  whom he was sure his visitor would like and who had formerly been maid  to his mother. She was now housekeeper and was also acting for the time  as superintendent to the little girl, of whom, without children of her  own, she was, by good luck, extremely fond. There were plenty of people  to help, but of course the young lady who should go down as governess  would be in supreme authority. She would also have, in holidays, to look  after the small boy, who had been for a term at school--young as he was  to be sent, but what else could be done?--and who, as the holidays were  about to begin, would be back from one day to the other. There had  been for the two children at first a young lady whom they had had the  misfortune to lose. She had done for them quite beautifully--she was a  most respectable person--till her death, the great awkwardness of which  had, precisely, left no alternative but the school for little Miles.  Mrs. Grose, since then, in the way of manners and things, had done as  she could for Flora; and there were, further, a cook, a housemaid, a  dairywoman, an old pony, an old groom, and an old gardener, all likewise  thoroughly respectable.    So far had Douglas presented his picture when someone put a question.  \"And what did the former governess die of?--of so much respectability?\"    Our friend's answer was prompt. \"That will come out. I don't  anticipate.\"    \"Excuse me--I thought that was just what you ARE doing.\"    \"In her successor's place,\" I suggested, \"I should have wished to learn  if the office brought with it--\"    \"Necessary danger to life?\" Douglas completed my thought. \"She did wish  to learn, and she did learn. You shall hear tomorrow what she learned.  Meanwhile, of course, the prospect struck her as slightly grim. She was  young, untried, nervous: it was a vision of serious duties and little  company, of really great loneliness. She hesitated--took a couple of  days to consult and consider. But the salary offered much exceeded  her modest measure, and on a second interview she faced the music, she  engaged.\" And Douglas, with this, made a pause that, for the benefit of  the company, moved me to throw in--    \"The moral of which was of course the seduction exercised by the  splendid young man. She succumbed to it.\"    He got up and, as he had done the night before, went to the fire, gave  a stir to a log with his foot, then stood a moment with his back to us.  \"She saw him only twice.\"    \"Yes, but that's just the beauty of her passion.\"    A little to my surprise, on this, Douglas turned round to me. \"It WAS  the beauty of it. There were others,\" he went on, \"who hadn't succumbed.  He told her frankly all his difficulty--that for several applicants the  conditions had been prohibitive. They were, somehow, simply afraid. It  sounded dull--it sounded strange; and all the more so because of his  main condition.\"    \"Which was--?\"    \"That she should never trouble him--but never, never: neither appeal  nor complain nor write about anything; only meet all questions herself,  receive all moneys from his solicitor, take the whole thing over and let  him alone. She promised to do this, and she mentioned to me that when,  for a moment, disburdened, delighted, he held her hand, thanking her for  the sacrifice, she already felt rewarded.\"    \"But was that all her reward?\" one of the ladies asked.    \"She never saw him again.\"    \"Oh!\" said the lady; which, as our friend immediately left us again, was  the only other word of importance contributed to the subject till, the  next night, by the corner of the hearth, in the best chair, he opened  the faded red cover of a thin old-fashioned gilt-edged album. The whole  thing took indeed more nights than one, but on the first occasion the  same lady put another question. \"What is your title?\"    \"I haven't one.\"    \"Oh, _I_ have!\" I said. But Douglas, without heeding me, had begun to  read with a fine clearness that was like a rendering to the ear of the  beauty of his author's hand.          I      I remember the whole beginning as a succession of flights and drops, a  little seesaw of the right throbs and the wrong. After rising, in town,  to meet his appeal, I had at all events a couple of very bad days--found  myself doubtful again, felt indeed sure I had made a mistake. In this  state of mind I spent the long hours of bumping, swinging coach that  carried me to the stopping place at which I was to be met by a vehicle  from the house. This convenience, I was told, had been ordered, and  I found, toward the close of the June afternoon, a commodious fly in  waiting for me. Driving at that hour, on a lovely day, through a country  to which the summer sweetness seemed to offer me a friendly welcome, my  fortitude mounted afresh and, as we turned into the avenue, encountered  a reprieve that was probably but a proof of the point to which it had  sunk. I suppose I had expected, or had dreaded, something so melancholy  that what greeted me was a good surprise. I remember as a most pleasant  impression the broad, clear front, its open windows and fresh curtains  and the pair of maids looking out; I remember the lawn and the bright  flowers and the crunch of my wheels on the gravel and the clustered  treetops over which the rooks circled and cawed in the golden sky. The  scene had a greatness that made it a different affair from my own scant  home, and there immediately appeared at the door, with a little girl in  her hand, a civil person who dropped me as decent a curtsy as if I had  been the mistress or a distinguished visitor. I had received in Harley  Street a narrower notion of the place, and that, as I recalled it, made  me think the proprietor still more of a gentleman, suggested that what I  was to enjoy might be something beyond his promise.    I had no drop again till the next day, for I was carried triumphantly  through the following hours by my introduction to the younger of my  pupils. The little girl who accompanied Mrs. Grose appeared to me on the  spot a creature so charming as to make it a great fortune to have to  do with her. She was the most beautiful child I had ever seen, and I  afterward wondered that my employer had not told me more of her. I slept  little that night--I was too much excited; and this astonished me, too,  I recollect, remained with me, adding to my sense of the liberality with  which I was treated. The large, impressive room, one of the best in  the house, the great state bed, as I almost felt it, the full, figured  draperies, the long glasses in which, for the first time, I could see  myself from head to foot, all struck me--like the extraordinary charm of  my small charge--as so many things thrown in. It was thrown in as  well, from the first moment, that I should get on with Mrs. Grose in  a relation over which, on my way, in the coach, I fear I had rather  brooded. The only thing indeed that in this early outlook might have  made me shrink again was the clear circumstance of her being so glad  to see me. I perceived within half an hour that she was so glad--stout,  simple, plain, clean, wholesome woman--as to be positively on her guard  against showing it too much. I wondered even then a little why she  should wish not to show it, and that, with reflection, with suspicion,  might of course have made me uneasy.    But it was a comfort that there could be no uneasiness in a connection  with anything so beatific as the radiant image of my little girl, the  vision of whose angelic beauty had probably more than anything else to  do with the restlessness that, before morning, made me several times  rise and wander about my room to take in the whole picture and prospect;  to watch, from my open window, the faint summer dawn, to look at such  portions of the rest of the house as I could catch, and to listen,  while, in the fading dusk, the first birds began to twitter, for the  possible recurrence of a sound or two, less natural and not without,  but within, that I had fancied I heard. There had been a moment when I  believed I recognized, faint and far, the cry of a child; there had been  another when I found myself just consciously starting as at the passage,  before my door, of a light footstep. But these fancies were not marked  enough not to be thrown off, and it is only in the light, or the gloom,  I should rather say, of other and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20906"],[0,"The Journal of Negro History, Volume 3, 1918 (#2)"],[1,"has seemed to me an  unpardonable sin. But I console myself with the thought that I acted  according to my best light, though the light that was in me was  darkness.\"[3]    Henson finally arrived with these slaves at the farm of his master's  brother, five miles south of the Ohio and fifteen miles above the  Yellow Banks, on the Big Blackfords' Creek in Davies County, Kentucky,  April, 1825. Here the situation as to food, shelter and general  comforts was a little better than in Maryland. He served on this  plantation as superintendent and having here among more liberal white  people the opportunity for religious instruction, he developed into a  successful preacher, recognized by the Conference of the Methodist  Episcopal Church.    There he remained waiting for his master three years. Unable to  persuade his wife to move to Kentucky, however, his master decided to  abandon the idea and sent an agent to bring upon those slaves another  heartrending scene of the auction block, though Henson himself was  exempted. Henson saw with deepest grief the agony which he recollected  in his own mother and which he now unfortunately said in the persons  with whom he had long been associated. He could not, therefore,  refrain from experiencing the bitterest feeling of hatred of the  system and its promoters. He furthermore lamented as never before his  agency in bringing the poor creatures hither, if such had to be the  end of the expedition. Freedom then became the all-absorbing purpose  that filled his soul. He said that he stood ready to pray, toil,  dissemble, plot like a fox and fight like a tiger.    A new light dawned upon the dark pathway of Josiah Henson, however, in  1828. A Methodist preacher, an anti-slavery white man, talked with  Henson one day confidentially about securing freedom. He thereupon  suggested to Henson to obtain his employer's consent to visit his old  master in Maryland that he might connect with friends in Ohio along  the way and obtain the sum necessary to purchase himself. His employer  readily consented and with the required pass and a letter of  recommendation from his Methodist friend to a preacher in Cincinnati,  Henson obtained contributions to the amount of one hundred and sixty  dollars on arriving in that city, where he preached to several  congregations. He then proceeded to Chillicothe where the annual  Methodist Conference was in session, his kind friend accompanying him.  With the aid of the influence and exertions of his coworker Henson was  again successful. He then purchased a suit of comfortable clothes and  an excellent horse, with which he traveled leisurely from town to  town, preaching and soliciting as he went. He succeeded so well that  when he arrived at his old home in Maryland, he was much better  equipped than his master. This striking difference and the delay of  Henson along the way from September to Christmas caused his master to  be somewhat angry. Moreover, as his master had lost most of his slaves  and other property in Maryland, he was anxious to have Henson as a  faithful worker to retrieve his losses; but this changed man would  hardly subserve such a purpose.    The conditions which he observed around him were so much worse than  what he had for some time been accustomed to and so changed was the  environment because of the departure or death of friends and relatives  during his absence that Henson resolved to become free. He then  consulted the brother of his master's wife, then a business man in  Washington, whom he had often befriended years before and who was  angry with Henson's master because the latter had defrauded him out of  certain property. This friend, therefore, gladly took up with Henson's  master the question of giving the slave an opportunity to purchase  himself. He carefully explained to the master that Henson had some  money and could purchase himself and that if, in consideration of the  valuable services he had rendered, the master refused to do so, Henson  would become free by escaping to Canada. The master agreed then to  give him his manumission papers for four hundred and fifty dollars, of  which three hundred and fifty dollars was to be in cash and the  remainder in Henson's note. Henson's money and horse enabled him to  pay the cash at once. But his master was to work a trick on him. He  did not receive his manumission papers until March 3, 1827, and when  Henson started for Kentucky his master induced him to let him send his  manumission papers to his brother in Kentucky where Henson was  returning, telling him that some ruffian might take the document from  him on the way. In returning to Kentucky Henson was arrested several  times as a fugitive, but upon always insisting on being carried before  a magistrate he was released. He had no trouble after reaching  Wheeling, from which he proceeded on a boat to Davies County,  Kentucky.    Arriving at the Kentucky home, he was informed that the master had  misrepresented the facts as to his purchase. He had written his  brother that Henson had agreed to pay one thousand dollars for  himself, the balance-of the six hundred and fifty dollars to be paid  in Kentucky. As the only evidence he had, had been sent to his  master's brother, it was impossible for him to make a case against him  in court. Things went on in uncertainty for about a year. Then came a  complaint from his master in Maryland, saying that he wanted money and  expressing the hope that Henson would soon pay the next installment.    Soon thereafter Henson received orders to go with Amos Riley carrying  a cargo to New Orleans. This suggestion was enough. He contrived to  have his manumission papers sewed up in his clothing prior to his  departure on the flat boat for New Orleans. He knew what awaited him  and his mind rapidly developed into a sort of smoldering volcano of  pent-up feeling which at one time all but impelled him to murder his  white betrayers. Blinded by passion and stung by madness, Henson  resolved to kill his four companions, to take what money they had,  then to scuttle the craft and escape to the North. One dark night  within a few days' sail of New Orleans it seemed that the opportune  hour had come. Henson was alone on the deck and Riley and the hands  were asleep. He crept down noiselessly, secured an ax, entered the  cabin, and looking by aid of the dim light, his eye fell first on  Riley. Henson felt the blade of the ax and raised it to strike the  first blow when suddenly the thought came to him, \"What! Commit  murder, and you a Christian?\" His religious feeling and belief in the  wonderful providence of God prevented him.    Riley talked later of getting him a good master and the like but did  not disguise the effort to sell him. Fortunately, however, Amos Riley  was suddenly taken sick and becoming more dependent on Henson then,  than Henson had been on him, he immediately ordered Henson to sell the  flat boat and find passage for him home in a sick cabin at once.  Henson did this and succeeded by careful nursing to get Amos back to  his home in Kentucky alive. Although he confessed that, if he had sold  Henson, he would have died, the family showed only a realization of an  increased value in Henson rather than an appreciation of his valuable  services. He, therefore, decided to escape to Canada.    His wife, fearing the dangers, would not at first agree to go, but  upon being told that he would take all of the children but the  youngest, she finally agreed to set out with him. Knowing of the  hardships that they must have to experience, Henson practised  beforehand the carrying of the children on his back. They crossed the  river into Indiana and proceeded toward Cincinnati, finding it  difficult to purchase food in that State, so intensely did the people  hate the Negro there. After two weeks of hardship, exhausted they  reached Cincinnati. There they were refreshed and carried 30 miles on  the way in a wagon. They directed themselves then toward the Scioto,  where they were told they would strike the military road of General  Hull, opened when he was operating against Detroit.    They set out, not knowing that the way lay through a wilderness of  howling wolves and, not taking sufficient food, they did not pass  homes from which they could purchase supplies on the way. They did not  go far before his wife fainted, but she was soon resuscitated.  Finally, they saw in the distance persons whose presence seemed to be  the dark foreboding of disaster, but the fugitives pressed on. They  proved to be Indians, who, when they saw the blacks, ran away yelping.  This excited the fugitives, as they thought the Indians were yelling  to secure the cooperation of a larger number to massacre them. Farther  on they saw other Indians standing behind trees hiding. After passing  through such trials as these for some time they came to an Indian  village, the dwellers of which, after some fear and hesitation,  welcomed them, supplied their wants and gave them a comfortable wigwam  for the night. They were then informed that they were about  twenty-five miles from the lakes. After experiencing some difficulty  in fording a dangerous stream and spending another night in the woods  they saw the houses on the outskirts; of Sandusky.    Using good judgment, however, Henson did not go into the village at  once. When about a mile from the lake, He hid his family in the woods  and then proceeded to approach the town. Soon he observed on the left  side of the town a house from which a number of men were taking  something to a vessel. Approaching them immediately he was asked  whether or not he desired to work. He promptly replied in the  affirmative and it was not long before he was assisting them in  loading corn. He soon contrived to get in line next to the only Negro  there engaged and communicated to him his plans.[4]    He told the captain, who called Henson aside and agreed to assist him  in getting"]]]
