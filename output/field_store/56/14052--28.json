He had never been to school before, and it did  not occur to him that he was doing any harm by his frankness--least of  all, to himself! The eyes of his friends and enemies alike glared  reproachfully at him, but he did not notice them. It was Jack Brady who  broke in.    \"We threw the basket at them first, sir, and it did hit them!\"    \"Well, never do it again, Brady. Look what a mess it's made on the  floor! And you others, you have been in the school longer; you ought to  have known better than to throw it back. You might have broken  something.\"    That was all. But the bitterness between the two camps was not lessened  by the incident, and Frere was liked none the better for it.    However, now work began again, and ill-feeling was shelved perforce for  the time. The sarcastic Green, for instance, found himself required to  read the part of \"Nerissa\" to Mason's \"Portia\"; and Hughes was set to  sketch Africa on the board in company with Vickers. The boys did not  know that Mr. West had given a hint to the masters to mix the new and  old element well together.    That opening day was a weary one to the nine town boys, and all but Jack  Brady, the \"weekly\", scampered off with boisterous delight when school  was dismissed at four o'clock.    The two chums, Ethelbert Hughes and Lewis Simmons, had been quickly  dubbed \"Ethel\" and \"Lucy\", and they did not at once appreciate their new  names. But Jack Brady, when he found himself hailed indiscriminately as  \"Apple\" and \"Grinner\", answered and laughed without a trace of  resentment. Perhaps that was why neither title stuck to him, while  Hughes and Simmons became Ethel and Lucy to everyone, and even at last  to each other.    Jack was standing at the window, watching his friends disappear in the  direction of the town, and whistling softly to keep up his spirits, when  Hallett approached him.    \"Hullo, Red-cheeks, they say you're not a day-boy. I think myself that  going home once a week is a mistake; however, of course that's a matter  of opinion. But why on earth do you stick by those wretched eight whom  West has let in to spoil the school?\"    \"Fellow-feeling!\" Jack's smile atoned for the shortness of his reply.    \"Nonsense! I can't for the life of me see why you should connect  yourself with that lot at all. We've no quarrel with you.\"    \"Nor with the others, for the matter of that,\" returned Jack, looking  straight into Hallett's face.    Hallett moved away with a short grunt, for want of an answer. Then,  remembering one, he turned back.    \"What about young Frere? What did you think of that?\"    \"I'd have stopped him if I could. But he didn't mean any harm. To a  home-boy it sometimes comes natural to blurt out all you know when  you're asked a question.\"    Hallett shrugged his shoulders.    \"You'll make a first-rate pleader one day, Brady. If ever I want  defending, I'll engage you.\"    \"Thanks!\" said Jack. \"You're very kind.\"          CHAPTER II    TOPPIN'S DIVE      If Mr. Anderson, the junior English master, had not happened to meet  some friends as he was on his way to the swimming-bath with the boys,  this chapter would not have been written. But they were old friends, and  very unexpected, who were only visiting Elmridge for an hour or two. So  he acted as I suppose nine out of ten young men would have acted in the  same circumstances.    \"Look here, boys,\" he said, running after the nearest group. \"Can I  trust you to go on quietly to the baths by yourselves? I shall follow  you very shortly. You can all have your dip, and dress, and by that time  I shall be with you. You won't get into mischief, and play pranks, will  you? Promise!\"    The four boys he addressed promised readily.    \"Right! Green, you're one of the seniors; I put you in charge. See that  all goes on just as if I were there. No one stay in the water more than  twelve minutes.\"    \"Very well, sir!\"    And Mr. Anderson departed with light heart and clear conscience.    It was only a couple of days since the term began, and the very  chilling reception accorded to the day-scholars had made friendly  advances between the two factions next to impossible. A distant  toleration was just now the recognized attitude.    But there were two people who were \"not playing the game\". One was Jack  Brady, who persisted in walking first with one party and then the other,  and refused point-blank to be distant towards anyone. The other was the  youngest scholar of Brincliffe, one Hugill Trevelyan, commonly known as  \"Toppin\". He was only seven, and did not understand the meaning of a  civil war. Toppin had been sent to school with his elder brother Escombe  because his parents were abroad.    The March Hare (Massimiliano Graglia, to give him once for all his right  name), who was two years Toppin's senior, and therefore better able to  quarrel to order without knowing the reason why, had a great affection  for him, and, when possible, would take charge of him. Toppin being a  very independent young man, however, this was not often possible. More  frequently he would patronize the March Hare, and explain to him English  words or ways that were puzzling.    It chanced that this afternoon three day-boys, Bacon, Armitage, and  Simmons, were in advance of the rest of the school, who were sauntering  behind in clusters of threes and fours. Hughes was not with Simmons,  being forbidden by his doctor to indulge in swimming at present. Bacon  looked back just as Mr. Anderson was turning in the opposite direction  with his friends.    \"Hullo, what sport!\" he exclaimed. \"Andy's given us the slip!\"    \"Be joyful! Let's race for the best boxes!\" said Armitage. \"We shall be  in the water long before the other slow-coaches have reached the baths.  One, two, three--off!\"    Now Toppin was one of the group behind, and being naturally fleet of  foot, a race was a thing he could not resist. So he took to his heels  and pursued them.    Jack Brady and the March Hare were walking with Toppin, and if it had  been practicable, the Hare would have accompanied him in the race, but  if there was one thing of which the March Hare was incapable, it was  running. Jack, who had found this out, checked him from making the  attempt.    \"Let Toppin go, Harey, and you stay with me,\" he said. There was a look  of satisfaction on his face. It was fine to see even the smallest  boarder chevying three day-boys!    Toppin ran his fastest, and panted into the baths only a yard behind  Simmons.    \"Why, if here isn't the kid! What the dickens has brought you after us,  young un?\"    \"I saw you--racing,\" panted Toppin, \"and I wanted to see--if I  couldn't--catch you. And I did!\"    His thick red hair was tumbled by the wind, and the odd little tuft  which had won him his nickname stuck up very prominently. The small pink  face was aglow with triumph, as he stood gasping for breath, and looking  up at the three older boys, his hands planted in his pockets and his  feet apart.    \"You're a boarder,\" said Armitage, with a touch of contempt.    \"I should think I am! Rather!\" was Toppin's proud reply.    \"Well, you'd better trot back to your friends, and bathe with them.  We're not going to wait for anyone.\"    \"Nor aren't I,\" said Toppin carelessly.    \"Come on!\" shouted Simmons from a box. \"Don't waste time!\"    Preparation for a bath is not a long process with a boy. Garments were  dragged off and tossed about, and in a minute they were ready, and  dancing round the edge of the clear green water.    Avoiding the steps as a matter of course, Toppin was swinging his arms  preparatory to jumping into the shallow end, when, seeing Simmons  skipping along the plank that led to the diving-board, in the part where  the water was marked \"5 ft.\", he paused to watch. Simmons raised his  hands above his head, curved his body, and dived.    \"Oo!\" cried Toppin admiringly.    Presently a head appeared, rolling round and blowing. Simmons was  swimming towards Toppin. Bacon was now preparing to take a header.    \"I say, Lucy, you're not a tall chap. No more aren't I. Why can't I swim  and dive?\"    \"It isn't size that's needed, it's talent,\" observed Simmons, treading  water, as he winked at the little fellow.    \"Rot!\" said Toppin decidedly. There was a loud splash. Bacon had  vanished.    \"Up he comes again!\" cried Toppin, clapping his hands in an ecstasy.  \"Oh, I'm going to dive to-day. You can see how easy it is. Let me have a  shot before the others come, case I fail.\"    \"Better wait a year or two, Top,\" said Simmons, deliberately turning a  somersault.    \"I'm bovvered if I do!\" cried Toppin, scampering round to the  diving-board. He was in a state of great excitement. \"I'm going to dive,  and turn head over heels, and stamp in the water, just like you.\"    \"Oh, let the nipper see what he can do!\" said Armitage, laughing. He was  standing on the diving-board. \"There's nothing like beginning early. Can  you swim, kiddie?\"    \"Not--not far,\" said Toppin cautiously. \"I can swim with my arms all  right, only I sometimes put one foot on the ground.\"    \"If you don't swim, you'll sink, you know,\" explained Armitage. \"This is  deep water.\"    \"Not so very; only five feet,\" rejoined Toppin. \"I'm not funky. Of  course I know _how_ to swim. I've watched frogs awfully closely.\"    \"Well, then, up with your hands--same as you saw the other two.\"    Toppin lifted them high, the tips of his fingers met in the approved  style, and he took a long breath. Then, gradually, his hands fell back  to his sides, and the breath ended in a sigh. Armitage pushed the child  impatiently aside.    \"Get away, you silly little coward! I'm not going to waste my time  standing over you. Go back to the shallow end, and dance at the ropes.  We'll come over and duck you.\"    Toppin was quivering, but his face flushed crimson, and, thrusting  himself forward once more, he laid a hand pleadingly on Armitage's  wrist. At the same moment a clatter on the stone stairs"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20366"],[0,"Wonderwings and other Fairy Stories (#2)"],[1,"moments, as she gazed, these faded away, and in their places  came a picture of a mine, with blackened toilers filling tracks with  coal. That, too, faded, and a golden cornfield showed upon the polished  glass; under the hot summer sun the busy reapers moved, wiping the sweat  from their brows when they stopped a moment to rest. A third picture was  of weavers making cloth. A cottage home came next, and a lordly mansion  of the rich, and a homeless child seeking shelter under a city bridge.  So scene followed scene, beautiful, or sad, or sordid, sometimes wild  and violent, and sometimes gay and peaceful, showing in the main a  people happy and content.    \"What is it?\" asked the amazed Queen-mother at last. \"How come these  pictures here?\"    \"They are the life of my state reflected on this magic mirror for my  help,\" replied the Queen. \"Long ago, when the first queen came to rule  the new kingdom of Westroyal, the fairies brought this mirror and set it  in the wall as here you see it. Faithfully ever since it has reflected  the daily happenings through-out the land, the people's toil and  pleasures, their dangers and their comforts and rewards. So each queen  has known her country. Your son, looking in his mirror, sees but  himself; I see the sufferings of my people and know what things they  need, and so plainly are these pictures set before me that I cannot rest  till I have used my power to give relief.\"    \"Oh!\" cried the Queen-mother, \"now I see why you are loved. How can I  get such a mirror for my son?\"    \"That I know not,\" replied the Queen.    Then the Queen-mother returned sad at heart to the kingdom of her son,  pondering on what she had seen.    Once again she walked in her garden alone. \"How shall I get such a  mirror?\" she wondered. \"What should I do?\"    As once before, a voice replied \"I know! I know!\"    The Queen-mother looked over the garden wall. Hobbling along the road  was the old woman who had bade her go to Westroyal. \"You who helped me  before, help me again!\" cried the Queen-mother. \"I have obeyed you. How  now shall I get a magic mirror for my son?\"    The old woman looked up at her. \"Go to the Deeps,\" she said, and she  hobbled off.    Now this was a dreadful command to the Queen-mother, for the Deeps was a  horrible black pool in the roughest and most dangerous part of the  country. It was said to be formed of the country's tears and to be also  bottomless, and to be haunted by beings of strange shape. There were  stories of their mysterious power and evil ways. Yet go she must, if  going meant the gaining of a magic mirror for her son. And she must go  alone, for only so could any seeker find the pathway to the pool, so it  was said.    \"I will go at once, before my courage fails,\" she said, and she left her  sheltered garden and set off across the land.    She had many weary miles to travel, past villages and towns and fields,  and she was footsore and faint when at last she reached the winding  track that led between the darkening hills. Yet on she went, following  the murmur of a tiny stream that dropped through thick-set bushes into a  shadowed valley. On she went still, and now the darkness came, and she  had lost her way. She stumbled over fallen logs, pushed with bleeding  hands and torn clothes through bramble wildernesses, and found at last  her way again to the narrow track beside the little stream that murmured  in the dark.    On she went, and down. The stream suddenly widened into a round  blackness open to the sky, but walled in by jagged rocks. It was the  pool. Utterly spent through weariness and fear, she sank down among the  rocks to rest, and waited there for what might come to her.    Strange rustlings sounded round the rocks, strange forms loomed close  beside her, strange voices asked her: \"What are you? Why come you to our  haunts?\" Though her heart was sick with dread she answered boldly in a  firm clear voice. \"Give me a magic mirror for my son, that he may learn  to rule.\"    There was a flash, and the pool and all the rocks were lit by a light  brighter and softer than that of moon or stars. All round her stood the  beings who had loomed so strangely in the darkness. They were fairies,  exquisite in shape and fineness, robed in flowing gossamer of many  colours. They smiled at her, and touched her with their gentle hands,  and immediately she was well. \"Your love has brought you nobly through  much fear and hurt,\" they said. \"You shall have your due reward. Look  into the Deeps.\"    [Illustration: She rose into the air a shining queen of fairies, holding  in her hands a tiny gleaming mirror.]    One took her hand and led her to the edge, and the Queen-mother,  fearless and smiling now, looked down into the fathomless water of the  pool. As she gazed, ripples came upon its surface. They broke away into  shining cascades of diamonds and pearls, and between them appeared the  face and shoulders of the old woman of the road. \"I have your magic  mirror,\" she cried. \"It is formed of the lowest teardrops of the Deeps.\"    She sprang out and trod the water to the shore, and as she went her rags  fell from her and she rose into the air a shining queen of fairies, more  beautiful than any other there, holding in her hand a tiny gleaming  mirror. \"Come,\" she said, \"let us set it in its place.\"    She touched the Queen-mother's hand, and in a flash they were all at the  palace, within the young king's sleeping chamber of turquoise and gold.  There as he lay asleep the fairies set the mirror in its place with  magic words, and as it touched the wall it lengthened out and widened  till it stood as large as that of the young queen across the border  line. Over the polished glass began to float the pictures of the  country's life. \"How can I show my gratitude?\" the Queen-mother asked;  but the fairies were gone.    Next morning when the little king awoke he ran to see the fine new  mirror in his room. He gazed and gazed upon the strange entrancing  pictures that came on it, and every day he spent long hours at the  mirror. And as he learned to recognise the hardships and the sufferings  of his people his heart grew hot to give relief, and he was no more  haughty, but used his power to ease their woes. So in Eastroyal as in  Westroyal there was content, and the people loved their king and praised  him through all his days until the end. And all the kings who followed  after him ruled wisely and were loved.    [Illustration]    [Illustration: \"Look closely at my flowers,\" she said, \"and tell me  which you think most beautiful.\"]          Fairy Tenderheart.      Little Fairy Tenderheart was weeping. She sat on a ledge that overlooked  the world, and her tears fell fast. In twos and threes her sisters flew  from Fairyland to put their arms about her, but none could comfort her.  \"Come, dance and sing with us and forget your grief,\" they said. She  shook her head. \"The terrible fighting!\" she said. \"See where far below  men rage, killing each other. Rivers run red with blood, and the sorrow  of weeping women rises through the air to where I sit. How can I dance  and sing?\"    \"It is the world at war,\" said an older fairy sadly. \"I too have wept in  earlier days when men have fought. But our tears are wasted, little  sister. Come away.\"    Fairy Tenderheart looked eagerly at her. \"You who have watched the world  so many years,\" she said, \"tell me why such dreadful deeds are done down  there.\"    The older fairy bent her eyes on the blackened plains of earth. \"I  cannot tell you that,\" she slowly said. \"We watch and pity, but we  cannot know what works in the hearts of men that they should gather in  their millions to destroy their brothers and themselves. No other  creature turns on its own kind and kills so terribly as man.\"    [Illustration: In twos and threes her sisters flew from Fairyland to put  their arms about her, but none could comfort her.]    \"What can we do? It must be stopped. What can we do?\"    \"We can do nothing, little sister. See where the women of the world  stretch out their hands, imploring men to live in peace. They beg the  lives of fathers, husbands, sons; they point to ruined homes and  desolated lands. 'War wrecks our lives!' they cry. Yet even for those  they love men will not give up battle. What, then, can fairies do? Tears  are useless. Come away.\"    \"I must stay here. I must think of something I can do,\" said Fairy  Tenderheart; and she would not go.    Her tears had stopped. She searched with anxious eyes across the world  to find some means of helping men to better things, but no way could she  find. And still the fighters shot and stabbed, and the dying and the  dead lay piled upon the fields.    Another fairy flew to her. \"Come away, little sister!\" she said. \"I  cannot bear to see you sorrowing. Come, or you will forget the merry  ways of Fairyland and grow like the Oldest Fairy of All, who spends her  life brooding over this dreary earth.\"    Fairy Tenderheart sprang up. \"Where is she? Tell me where to find her.  Why did I not know of her before? I will go to her that we may be  companions in our sorrow. Perhaps together we may find a way to help.\"    \"Ah, do not go. Listen! She is so old that she has watched the world  since the beginning of wars, yet, as you see, she has found no way of  stopping them. How then can you?\"    \"I must go.\"    \"She left our joyful Fairyland for a Magic Garden, and whoever enters  that Garden can never come back to us. There she dwells for ever alone,  at work or in thought, or preparing for her mysterious journeys to the  earth. Do not go, or you too will be cut off from our life of dance and  song, never to return.\"    \"I will go. Tell me the way.\"    The fairy flew off. \"I will not tell you,\" she said. \"You shall not go.\"    \"I will go,\" said Fairy Tenderheart again. With steadfast steps she  searched through Fairyland until she found a narrow track that led  between the winding mountains and far "]]]
