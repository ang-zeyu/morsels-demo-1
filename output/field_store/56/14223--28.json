Mycroft Holmes struggled out  of his overcoat and subsided into an armchair.    \"A most annoying business, Sherlock,\" said he.  \"I extremely dislike  altering my habits, but the powers that be would take no denial.  In  the present state of Siam it is most awkward that I should be away from  the office.  But it is a real crisis.  I have never seen the Prime  Minister so upset.  As to the Admiralty--it is buzzing like an  overturned bee-hive.  Have you read up the case?\"    \"We have just done so.  What were the technical papers?\"    \"Ah, there's the point!  Fortunately, it has not come out.  The press  would be furious if it did.  The papers which this wretched youth had  in his pocket were the plans of the Bruce-Partington submarine.\"    Mycroft Holmes spoke with a solemnity which showed his sense of the  importance of the subject.  His brother and I sat expectant.    \"Surely you have heard of it?  I thought everyone had heard of it.\"    \"Only as a name.\"    \"Its importance can hardly be exaggerated.  It has been the most  jealously guarded of all government secrets.  You may take it from me  that naval warfare becomes impossible within the radius of a  Bruce-Partington's operation.  Two years ago a very large sum was  smuggled through the Estimates and was expended in acquiring a monopoly  of the invention.  Every effort has been made to keep the secret.  The  plans, which are exceedingly intricate, comprising some thirty separate  patents, each essential to the working of the whole, are kept in an  elaborate safe in a confidential office adjoining the arsenal, with  burglar-proof doors and windows.  Under no conceivable circumstances  were the plans to be taken from the office.  If the chief constructor  of the Navy desired to consult them, even he was forced to go to the  Woolwich office for the purpose.  And yet here we find them in the  pocket of a dead junior clerk in the heart of London.  From an official  point of view it's simply awful.\"    \"But you have recovered them?\"    \"No, Sherlock, no!  That's the pinch.  We have not.  Ten papers were  taken from Woolwich.  There were seven in the pocket of Cadogan West.  The three most essential are gone--stolen, vanished.  You must drop  everything, Sherlock.  Never mind your usual petty puzzles of the  police-court.  It's a vital international problem that you have to  solve.  Why did Cadogan West take the papers, where are the missing  ones, how did he die, how came his body where it was found, how can the  evil be set right?  Find an answer to all these questions, and you will  have done good service for your country.\"    \"Why do you not solve it yourself, Mycroft?  You can see as far as I.\"    \"Possibly, Sherlock.  But it is a question of getting details. Give me  your details, and from an armchair I will return you an excellent  expert opinion.  But to run here and run there, to cross-question  railway guards, and lie on my face with a lens to my eye--it is not my  metier.  No, you are the one man who can clear the matter up.  If you  have a fancy to see your name in the next honours list--\"    My friend smiled and shook his head.    \"I play the game for the game's own sake,\" said he.  \"But the problem  certainly presents some points of interest, and I shall be very pleased  to look into it.  Some more facts, please.\"    \"I have jotted down the more essential ones upon this sheet of paper,  together with a few addresses which you will find of service.  The  actual official guardian of the papers is the famous government expert,  Sir James Walter, whose decorations and sub-titles fill two lines of a  book of reference.  He has grown gray in the service, is a gentleman, a  favoured guest in the most exalted houses, and, above all, a man whose  patriotism is beyond suspicion.  He is one of two who have a key of the  safe.  I may add that the papers were undoubtedly in the office during  working hours on Monday, and that Sir James left for London about three  o'clock taking his key with him.  He was at the house of Admiral  Sinclair at Barclay Square during the whole of the evening when this  incident occurred.\"    \"Has the fact been verified?\"    \"Yes; his brother, Colonel Valentine Walter, has testified to his  departure from Woolwich, and Admiral Sinclair to his arrival in London;  so Sir James is no longer a direct factor in the problem.\"    \"Who was the other man with a key?\"    \"The senior clerk and draughtsman, Mr. Sidney Johnson.  He is a man of  forty, married, with five children.  He is a silent, morose man, but he  has, on the whole, an excellent record in the public service.  He is  unpopular with his colleagues, but a hard worker.  According to his own  account, corroborated only by the word of his wife, he was at home the  whole of Monday evening after office hours, and his key has never left  the watch-chain upon which it hangs.\"    \"Tell us about Cadogan West.\"    \"He has been ten years in the service and has done good work.  He has  the reputation of being hot-headed and imperious, but a straight,  honest man.  We have nothing against him.  He was next Sidney Johnson  in the office.  His duties brought him into daily, personal contact  with the plans.  No one else had the handling of them.\"    \"Who locked up the plans that night?\"    \"Mr. Sidney Johnson, the senior clerk.\"    \"Well, it is surely perfectly clear who took them away.  They are  actually found upon the person of this junior clerk, Cadogan West.  That seems final, does it not?\"    \"It does, Sherlock, and yet it leaves so much unexplained.  In the  first place, why did he take them?\"    \"I presume they were of value?\"    \"He could have got several thousands for them very easily.\"    \"Can you suggest any possible motive for taking the papers to London  except to sell them?\"    \"No, I cannot.\"    \"Then we must take that as our working hypothesis.  Young West took the  papers.  Now this could only be done by having a false key--\"    \"Several false keys.  He had to open the building and the room.\"    \"He had, then, several false keys.  He took the papers to London to  sell the secret, intending, no doubt, to have the plans themselves back  in the safe next morning before they were missed. While in London on  this treasonable mission he met his end.\"    \"How?\"    \"We will suppose that he was travelling back to Woolwich when he was  killed and thrown out of the compartment.\"    \"Aldgate, where the body was found, is considerably past the station  London Bridge, which would be his route to Woolwich.\"    \"Many circumstances could be imagined under which he would pass London  Bridge.  There was someone in the carriage, for example, with whom he  was having an absorbing interview.  This interview led to a violent  scene in which he lost his life.  Possibly he tried to leave the  carriage, fell out on the line, and so met his end.  The other closed  the door.  There was a thick fog, and nothing could be seen.\"    \"No better explanation can be given with our present knowledge; and yet  consider, Sherlock, how much you leave untouched.  We will suppose, for  argument's sake, that young Cadogan West HAD determined to convey these  papers to London.  He would naturally have made an appointment with the  foreign agent and kept his evening clear.  Instead of that he took two  tickets for the theatre, escorted his fiancee halfway there, and then  suddenly disappeared.\"    \"A blind,\" said Lestrade, who had sat listening with some impatience to  the conversation.    \"A very singular one.  That is objection No. 1.  Objection No. 2: We  will suppose that he reaches London and sees the foreign agent.  He  must bring back the papers before morning or the loss will be  discovered.  He took away ten.  Only seven were in his pocket.  What  had become of the other three?  He certainly would not leave them of  his own free will.  Then, again, where is the price of his treason?  Once would have expected to find a large sum of money in his pocket.\"    \"It seems to me perfectly clear,\" said Lestrade.  \"I have no doubt at  all as to what occurred.  He took the papers to sell them.  He saw the  agent. They could not agree as to price.  He started home again, but  the agent went with him.  In the train the agent murdered him, took the  more essential papers, and threw his body from the carriage.  That  would account for everything, would it not?\"    \"Why had he no ticket?\"    \"The ticket would have shown which station was nearest the agent's  house.  Therefore he took it from the murdered man's pocket.\"    \"Good, Lestrade, very good,\" said Holmes.  \"Your theory holds together.  But if this is true, then the case is at an end.  On the one hand, the  traitor is dead.  On the other, the plans of the Bruce-Partington  submarine are presumably already on the Continent.  What is there for  us to do?\"    \"To act, Sherlock--to act!\" cried Mycroft, springing to his feet. \"All  my instincts are against this explanation.  Use your powers! Go to the  scene of the crime!  See the people concerned!  Leave no stone  unturned!  In all your career you have never had so great a chance of  serving your country.\"    \"Well, well!\" said Holmes, shrugging his shoulders.  \"Come, Watson!  And you, Lestrade, could you favour us with your company for an hour or  two?  We will begin our investigation by a visit to Aldgate Station.  Good-bye, Mycroft.  I shall let you have a report before evening, but I  warn you in advance that you have little to expect.\"    An hour later Holmes, Lestrade and I stood upon the Underground  railroad at the point where it emerges from the tunnel immediately  before Aldgate Station.  A courteous red-faced old gentleman  represented the railway company.    \"This is where the young man's body lay,\" said he, indicating a spot  about three feet from the metals.  \"It could not have fallen from  above, for these, as you see, are all blank walls. Therefore, it could  only have come from "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23462"],[0,"More Russian Picture Tales (#2)"],[1,"free will?\"    Then he went on further, just as hungry as ever, and after a bit he saw  a horse walking in a meadow nibbling the grass.    [Illustration]    So he went up to him and said: \"Mr. Horse, Mr. Horse, I'm going to eat  you!\" But the horse answered: \"Who are you, I should like to know, that  you mean to eat me?\" \"I'm a wolf!\" \"You think again,\" answered the  horse, \"You're only a dog!\" \"No, I'm not a dog,\" said he, \"I'm a wolf.\"  \"Oh, if you are sure you're a wolf, it's all right. Only I'm not very  fat yet, so you'd better begin on my tail, and meanwhile I'll be  munching some more grass and get a little fuller.\"    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    So the wolf went up to him from behind, and was just going to get to  work on his tail, when the horse let out at him as hard as he could! And  the wolf rolled over, while the horse ran off.    And there sat the wolf, and he thought: \"Well, wasn't I a fool! wasn't I  a noodle! Who ever heard of anyone starting to eat a horse by the tail?\"    [Illustration]    And so he wandered on further, when after a bit he saw a pig coming  towards him, so when he got to him he said: \"Mr. Pig, Mr. Pig, I'm going  to eat you!\" But the pig answered: \"Who are you, I should like to know,  that you mean to eat me?\" \"I'm a wolf.\" \"You're a queer sort of wolf,\"  answered the pig, \"you're only a dog!\" \"No, I'm not a dog,\" said he,  \"I'm a wolf!\" \"Oh, that's all right then,\" answered the pig, \"you just  sit down on my back. I'll give you a ride, and then you can eat me.\"    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    So the wolf sat down on the pig's back, when lo and behold! the pig  carried him straight into the village.    [Illustration]    And all the dogs ran out, made a dash for the wolf, and began to tease  him. And they teased him so much, it was all he could do to tear  himself away and run off back into the forest.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    [Illustration: Guess how old I am!]          THE PEASANT AND THE BEAR.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]      Once upon a time a certain peasant lost his wife, then he lost his other  relations, and then he was left alone with no one to help him in his  home or his fields. So he went to Bruin and said: \"Look here, Bruin,  let's keep house and plant our garden and sow our corn together.\" And  Bruin asked: \"But how shall we divide it afterwards?\" \"How shall we  divide it?\" said the peasant, \"Well, you take all the tops and let me  have all the roots.\" \"All right,\" answered Bruin. So they sowed some  turnips, and they grew beautifully. And Bruin worked hard, and gathered  in all the turnips, and then they began to divide them. And the peasant  said: \"The tops are yours, aren't they, Bruin?\" \"Yes,\" he answered. So  the peasant cut off all the turnip tops and gave them to Bruin, and  then sat down to count the roots. And Bruin saw that the peasant had  done him down.    [Illustration]    And he got huffy, lay down in his den, and started sucking his paws.    [Illustration]    The next spring the peasant again came to see him, and said: \"Look here,  Bruin, let's work together again, shall we?\" And Bruin answered:  \"Right-ho! only this time mind! you can have the tops, but I'm going to  have the roots!\" \"Very well,\" said the peasant. And they sowed some  wheat, and when the ears grew up and ripened, you never saw such a  sight. Then they began to divide it, and the peasant took all the tops  with the grain, and gave Bruin the straw and the roots. So he didn't get  anything that time either.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    And Bruin said to the peasant: \"Well, good-bye! I'm not going to work  with you any more, you're too crafty!\" And with that he went off into  the forest.    [Illustration]          THE DOG AND THE COCK    [Illustration]      One summer a certain peasant's crops failed him, and so he had no food  to give to his animals, which were a cock and a dog. And the dog said to  the cock: \"Well, brother Peeter, I think we should get more to eat if  we went and lived in the forest than here at our master's, don't you?\"  \"That's a fact,\" answered the cock, \"let's be off, there's no help for  it.\"    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    So they said good-bye to their master and mistress and went off to see  what they could find. And they went on and on, and couldn't find a nice  place to stop. Then it began to grow dark, and the cock said: \"Let's  spend the night on a tree. I'll fly up on to a branch, and you take  shelter in the hollow. We'll get through the night somehow.\"    [Illustration]    So the cock made his way on to a branch, tucked in his toes, and went to  sleep, while the dog made himself a bed in the hollow of the tree. And  they slept soundly the whole night through, and towards morning, when it  began to get light, the cock woke up and, as was his custom, crew as  loud as he could: \"Cock-a-doodle-doo! cock-a-doodle-do! all wake up! all  get up! the sun will soon be rising, and the day will soon begin!\"    [Illustration]    And he crew so loud, that a fox in a hole near by was up in an instant  thinking: \"What a funny thing for a cock to be crowing in the forest! I  expect he's lost his way and can't get out again!\"    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    And he began to look for the cock, and after a bit he saw him sitting  upon the branch of the tree. \"Oho!\" thought the fox, \"he'd make a fine  meal! How can I get him to come down from there?\"    [Illustration]    So he went up to the tree and said to the cock: \"What a splendid cock  you are! I've never seen such a fine one all my days! What lovely  feathers, just as if they were covered with gold! And your tail! nobody  could describe it in words or on paper, it's so beautiful! And what a  sweet voice you've got! I could listen to it all day and all night. Do  fly down a little closer and let's get to know each other a little  better. That reminds me, I've got a christening on at my place to-day,  and I shall have plenty of food and drink to offer such a welcome guest.  Let's go along to my home.\"    [Illustration]    \"Right you are,\" answered the cock, \"I'll certainly come, only you must  ask my companion too. We always go about together.\" \"And where is your  companion?\" asked the fox. \"Down below in the tree hollow,\" answered  the cock. And the fox poked his head into the hole, thinking there was  another cock there, when the dog popped his head out and caught Mr. Fox  by the nose!    [Illustration]          KING FROST.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]      Once upon a time there lived an old man and his wife. She had one  daughter of her own, and he had one of _his_ own. And the old woman took  a dislike to her step-daughter. Whatever her own daughter did, she  praised her for everything and stroked her head, but whatever her  step-daughter did, she grumbled at her and scolded her for everything;  it was simply dreadful. And the old woman began to want to drive her  step-daughter off the face of the earth, and she said to her husband:  \"Take her away into the dark forest, and let the frost freeze her to  death.\" So there was nothing for the old man to do but harness his horse  to the sledge, put his daughter in it, and drive her off into the  forest. And he brought her right into the middle of the forest, set her  down on the snow, and drove off home.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    And there the little girl sat in the forest all alone, shivering with  the cold. When lo and behold! there was old King Frost coming towards  her, and he said: \"Hullo, little girl, are you warm?\" And she answered:  \"Yes, King Frost.\" Then he blew a cold breath on to her and again asked:  \"Are you warm, little girl?\" And she answered: \"Yes, King Frost!\" Then  he began to make it still colder; he made the branches crack, and  covered them with hoar-frost, and let loose such cold, that you could  hear the air creaking.    [Illustration]    Then he asked her again: \"Well, little girl, are you warm now?\" And she  answered: \"Yes, King Frost!\" And when he saw that she was a good girl,  he felt sorry for her. So he put on her a fur coat, with trimmings of  beaver, and made her warm, and said to her: \"You're a good girl, and so  I'll stop. Here's a little present for you from King Frost.\"    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    And he brought her a trunk full of all sorts of things, silver and gold,  and bright-coloured stones.    [Illustration]    Meanwhile her step-mother was saying to the old man at home: \"I expect  your daughter's frozen by now. Go into the forest and bring her back.\"  So he harnessed his horse to the sledge, and set out to fetch his  daughter.    [Illustration]    Then his wife began to watch at the window, and at last she saw her  husband driving towards home, and she said to herself: \"That's all  right, there come the old man's daughter's bones back in the sledge.\"    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    But the doggie outside said: \"Bow, wow, bow-wow-wow! The old man's  bringing his daughter home. She's blooming like the poppy-bloom, and  she's got a fine present, and a new coat with a beaver collar!\" And lo  and behold! it was true; the old man drove up with his daughter alive  and well, in her fine clothes and with her presents. \"Well,\" thought her  step-mother, \"if King Frost has given all those things to the old man's  daughter, he'll give my pretty girl ever so much more.\" And she said to  her husband: \"Take my daughter to the same place as quick as you can,  and let King Frost give her a share too!\"    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    So the old man took her daughter, left her in the forest, and then drove  off home. And there the girl sat, with her teeth chattering with the  cold, when lo and behold! there was King Frost coming along, and he  said: \"Hullo, little girl, are you warm?\" And she answered: \"What's that  got to do with you? Go away to where you came from!\" And King Frost grew  angry and blew a cold breath"]]]
