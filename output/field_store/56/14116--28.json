But I haven't done with you yet;\" and as  they passed out through the door into the great playground he drew  himself up, giving his head a jerk, and then moistening his hands in a  very objectionable way, he gave them a rub together, doubled his fists,  and threw himself into a fighting attitude, jerking his head to and fro  in the most approved manner; and, bringing forth a roar of delight from  the little crowd around him, as quick as lightning he delivered two  sharp blows right and left to a couple of unoffending schoolfellows,  picking out, though, two who were not likely to retaliate.    \"That'll be it, boys, the pair together--one down and t'other come on.  Both together if they like.  They want putting in their places.  I mean  to strike against it.\"    \"Hit hard then, Sleggy,\" cried one of his parasites.    \"I will,\" was the reply.  \"There you have it;\" and to the last speaker's  disgust he received a sharp blow in the chest which sent him staggering  back.  \"Now, don't you call me Sleggy again, young man.  Next time it  will be one in the mouth.--Yes, boys,\" he continued, drawing himself up,  \"I do mean to hit hard, and let the Principal and the masters see that  we are not going to have favouritism here.  Indian prince, indeed!  Yah!  who's he?  Why, I could sell him for a ten-pun note, stock and lock and  bag and baggage, to Madame Tussaud's.  That's about all he's fit for.  Dressed up to imitate an English gentleman!  Look at him!  His clothes  don't fit, even if they are made by a proper tailor.\"    \"It's he who doesn't fit his clothes,\" cried one of the circle.    \"Well done, Burney!\" cried Slegge approvingly.  \"That's it.  Look at his  hands and feet.  Bah!  I haven't patience with it.  The Doctor ought to  be ashamed of himself, taking a nigger like that!  Why didn't he come  dressed like a native, instead of disguised as an English lad?  And he's  no more like it than chalk's like cheese.  Yes, I say the Doctor ought  to be ashamed of himself, bringing a fellow like that into an  establishment for the sons of gentlemen; and I'll tell him so before I  have done.\"    \"Do,\" said the lad nearest to him; \"only do it when we are all there.  I  should like to hear you give the Doctor a bit of your mind.\"    Slegge turned round upon him sharply.  \"Do you mean that,\" he said, \"or  is it chaff?\"    \"Mean it?  Of course!\" cried the boy hastily.    \"Lucky for you, then,\" continued Slegge.  \"I suppose you haven't  forgotten me giving you porridge before breakfast this time last year?\"    \"Here, what a chap you are!  I didn't mean any harm.  But I say, Slegge,  old chap, you did scare them off.  I wish the Principal wouldn't have  any more new boys.  I say, though, you don't mean to get the wickets  pitched this morning, do you?\"    \"Of course I do,\" cried Slegge.  \"Do you want to go idling and staring  over the wall and look at the show?\"    \"Well, I--I--\"    \"There, that will do,\" cried Slegge.  \"I know.  Just as if there weren't  monkeys enough in the collection without you!\"    At this would-be witticism on the part of the tyrant of the school there  was a fresh roar of laughter, which made the unfortunate against whom it  was directed writhe with annoyance, and hurry off to conciliate his  schoolfellow by getting the wickets pitched.        CHAPTER TWO.    DECLARATION OF WAR.    Meanwhile the two lads, who had retired from the field, strolled off  together across the playground down to the pleasant lawn-like level  which the Doctor, an old lover of the Surrey game, took a pride in  having well kept for the benefit of his pupils, giving them a fair  amount of privilege for this way of keeping themselves in health.  But  to quote his words in one of his social lectures, he said:    \"You boys think me a dreadful old tyrant for keeping you slaving away at  your classics and mathematics, because you recollect the work that you  are often so unwilling to do, while the hours I give you for play quite  slip your minds.  Now, this is my invariable rule, that you shall do  everything well: work hard when it's work, and play hard when it's  play.\"    The two lads, Glyn Severn and his companion of many years, Aziz Singh, a  dark English boy in appearance and speech, but maharajah in his own  right over a powerful principality in Southern India, strolled right  away over the grass to the extreme end of the Doctor's extensive  grounds, chatting together as boys will talk about the incidents of the  morning.    \"Oh,\" cried the Indian lad angrily, \"I wish you hadn't stopped me.  I  was just ready.\"    \"Why, what did you want to do, Singhy?\" cried the other.    \"Fight,\" said the boy, with his eyes flashing and his dark brows drawn  down close together.    \"Oh, you shouldn't fight directly after breakfast,\" said Glyn Severn,  laughing good-humouredly.    \"Why not?\" cried the other fiercely.  \"I felt just then as if I could  kill him.\"    \"Then I am glad I lugged you away.\"    \"But you shouldn't,\" cried the young Indian.  \"You nearly made me hit  you.\"    \"You had better not,\" said Glyn, laughing merrily.    \"Yes, of course; I know, and I don't want to.\"    \"That's right; and you mustn't kill people in England because you fall  out with them.\"    \"No, of course not; I know that too.  But I don't like that boy.  He  keeps on saying nasty things to us, and--and--what do you call it?  I  know--bullies you, and says insulting things to me.  How dare he call me  a nigger and say my father was a mahout?\"    \"The insulting brute!\" said Glyn.    \"Why should he do it?\" cried Singh.    \"Oh, it's plain enough.  It's because he is big and strong, and he wants  to pick a quarrel with us.\"    \"But what for?\" cried Singh.  \"We never did him any harm.\"    \"Love of conquest, I suppose, so as to make us humble ourselves to him  same as the other fellows do.  He wants to be cock of the school.\"    \"Oh--oh!\" cried Singh.  \"It does make me feel so hot.  What did he say  to me: was I going to ride on the elephant?--Yes.  Well, suppose I was.  It wouldn't be the first time.\"    \"Not by hundreds,\" cried Glyn.  \"I say, used it not to be grand?  Don't  you wish we were going over the plains to-day on the back of old  Sultan?\"    He pronounced it Sool-tann.    \"Ah, yes!\" cried Singh, with his eyes flashing now.  \"I do, I do!  instead of being shut up in this old school to be bullied by a boy like  that.  I should like to knock his head off.\"    \"No, you wouldn't.  There, don't think anything more about it.  He isn't  worth your notice.\"    \"No, I suppose not,\" said the Indian boy;--\"but what makes me so angry  is that he despises me, and has treated me ever since we came here as if  I were his inferior.  It is not the first time he has called me a  nigger.--There, I won't think anything more about it.  Tell me, what's  this grand procession to-day?  Is it to be like a durbar at home, when  all the rajahs and nawabs come together with their elephants and  trains?\"    \"Oh, no, no, no!\" cried Glyn, laughing.  \"Nothing of the kind.\"    \"Then, why are they making all this fuss?  It said on the bills we saw  yesterday in the town, `Ramball's Wild-Beast Show.  Grand Procession.'\"    \"I don't know much about it,\" said Glyn; \"only here in England in  country places they make a great fuss over things like this.  I asked  Wrench yesterday, and he said that this was a menagerie belonging to a  man who lives near and keeps his wild-beasts at a big farm-like place  just outside the town.\"    \"But why a procession?\" said Singh impatiently.    \"Oh, he takes them all round the country, going from town to town, and  they are away for months, and now they are coming back.\"    \"Menagerie! beast show!\" said Singh thoughtfully.  \"They are all tame,  of course?\"    \"Yes, of course,\" said Glyn.  \"It said lions and tigers and elephants  and camels, and a lot more things on the bills.  I should like to see  them.\"    \"You English are a wonderful people.  My father used to have tigers--  three of them--a tiger, a tigress, and a nearly full-grown cub.  But  they were so fierce he got tired of keeping them, and when the tigress  killed one of the keepers, you remember, he asked your father about it,  and they settled that it would be best to kill them.\"    \"Of course, I remember,\" said Glyn; \"and they had a tiger-hunt, and let  one out at a time, and had beaters to drive them out of the nullahs, and  shot all three.\"    \"Yes,\" said Singh thoughtfully; \"and my father wouldn't let me go with  him on his elephant, because he said it wouldn't be safe.  Then these  will all be tame tigers and lions?  Well, I shall like to see them all  the same, because it will make me feel like being at home once more.  I  say, when is your father coming down again?\"    \"Don't know,\" said Glyn quietly.  \"I did ask in my last weekly letter.\"    \"Ah!\" said the Indian boy with a sigh, \"I wish I were you.\"    \"Well, let's change,\" said Glyn laughing.  \"You envy me!  Why, I ought  to envy you.\"    \"Why?\" said Singh, staring.    \"Why, because you are a maharajah, a prince; and when you grow old  enough you are going back to Dour to rule over your subjects and be one  of the biggest pots in Southern India.\"    \"Well, what of that?\" said Singh quietly.  \"What good will that do me?  But of course the Colonel will come too.\"    \"Ah, that remains to be seen,\" said Glyn.  \"That'll be years to come,  and who knows what will happen before then?\"    \"I don't care what happens,\" cried Singh hotly.  \"He's coming back to  India when I go.  Why, he told me himself that my father made him my  guardian, and that he promised to look after me as long as he lived.  He  said he promised to be a father to me.  It was that day when I got into  a passion about something, and made him so cross.  But I was very sorry  afterwards,\" said the boy quietly, \"he's such a good old fellow, and  made me like him as much as I did my own father.\"    \"Well,\" said Glyn merrily, \"you have "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21316"],[0,"The Adventures of Don Lavington: Nolens Volens (#2)"],[1,", and hoes the 'bacco in the plantations.  I'm sorry  for you.\"    Lindon Lavington thrust his little account book in his breast, and  walked hurriedly in the direction taken by the man Jem, entering  directly after a low warehouse door, where rows of sugar-hogsheads lay,  and there was a murmur and buzz made by the attracted flies.    Mike Bannock stood with his hands clasping the handle of the crane winch  against which he leaned without moving, but his eyes were hard at work.    He followed Don with them till he had disappeared through the low dark  doorway, then glanced at the closed gate leading into the busy street,  and then at the open office door, a few yards away.    All was still, save the buzzing of the flies about the casks on that hot  midsummer's day, and without the trace of a limp, the man stepped  rapidly into the office, but only to dart back again in alarm, for, all  at once, there was a loud rattling noise of straps, chains, and heavy  harness.    There was no cause for alarm.  It was only the fat, sleepy horse in the  trolly shafts, who, at the same time that he gave his nosebag a toss,  shook himself violently to get rid of the flies which preferred his  juices to the sugar oozing from many a hogshead's seams.    Mike darted into the office again; the flies buzzed; the horse munched  oats; the faint sound of Don's voice in converse with Jem Wimble could  he heard; then there was a faint click as if a desk had been shut down  softly, and Mike stepped out again, gave a hasty glance round, and the  next moment was standing dreamily with his eyes half-closed, grasping  the handle of the crane winch as Don returned, closely followed by Jem  Wimble.    \"Now, Mas' Don, I'll just mark another,\" said Jem, \"and we'll have him  out.\"    He took a lump of chalk from a ledge close by, and ascended a step  ladder to a door about six feet above the spot where Mike stood, and Don  stood with his book under his arm, his brow rugged, and a thoughtful  look in his eyes.    Just then the small door in the yard gate was opened, and a  sturdy-looking grey-haired man in snuff-coloured coat and cocked hat,  drab breeches and gaiters, entered unseen by the pair, who had their  backs to him.    \"I 'member, Mas' Don, when I were out in the _Mary Anne_ five year ago.  We'd got to Pannymah, when the skipper stood with his glass to his eye,  looking at a strange kind o' hobjick ashore, and he says to me, `Mike,  my lad--'\"    \"You idle scoundrel!  How many more times am I to tell you that I will  not have my time wasted over those lying stories of yours?  Lindon, am I  ever to be able to trust you when business takes me away?\"    The words came in short sharp tones, and the speaker's dark eyes seemed  to flash.  The effect was marvellous.    Mike began to turn the handle at a rapid rate, winding up the rope till  the pair of hooks used for grasping the great hogsheads rattled with  their chains against the pulley wheels of the crane, and a shout came  from the warehouse,--    \"Whatcher doing of?  Hold hard!\"    \"Stop, sir!\" cried the stern-looking man to Mike, just as Jem appeared  at the upper doorway and looked down.    \"Oh!\" he ejaculated.  \"Didn't know as you was there, sir.\"    \"It is disgraceful, Lindon.  The moment my back is turned you leave your  desk to come and waste the men's time.  I am ashamed of you.\"    Lindon's forehead grew more wrinkled as Josiah Christmas, merchant of  Bristol city, and his maternal uncle, walked into the office, whither  the lad followed slowly, looking stubborn and ill-used, for Mike  Bannock's poison was at work, and in his youthful ignorance and folly,  he felt too angry to attempt a frank explanation.    In fact, just then one idea pervaded his mind--two ideas--that his uncle  was a tyrant, and that he ought to strike against his tyranny and be  free.        CHAPTER TWO.    BLIND AS BATS.    That same evening Don Lavington did not walk home with his uncle, but  hung back to see Jem Wimble lock-up, and then sauntered slowly with him  toward the little low house by the entrance gates, where the yard-man,  as he was called, lived in charge.    Jem had been in the West India merchant's service from a boy, and no one  was more surprised than he when on the death of old Topley, Josiah  Christmas said to him one morning,--    \"Wimble, you had better take poor old Topley's place.\"    \"And--and take charge of the yard, sir?\"    \"Yes.  I can trust you, can't I?\"    \"Oh, yes, sir; but--\"    \"Ah!  Yes.  You have no wife to put in the cottage.\"    Jem began to look foolish, and examine the lining of his hat.    \"Well, sir, if it comes to that,\" he faltered; and there was a weak  comical aspect in his countenance which made Don burst out laughing.    \"I know, uncle,\" he cried, \"he has got a sweetheart.\"    \"Well, Master Don,\" said the young man, colouring up; \"and nothing to be  ashamed on neither.\"    \"Certainly not,\" said the merchant quietly.  \"You had better get  married, Wimble, and you can have the cottage.  I will buy and lend you  old Topley's furniture.\"    Wimble begged pardon afterwards, for on hearing all this astounding  news, he rushed out of the office, pulled off his leather apron, put on  his coat as he ran, and disappeared for an hour, at the end of which  time he returned, went mysteriously up to Don and whispered,--    \"It's all right, sir; she says she will.\"    The result was that Jem Wimble looked twice as important, and cocked his  cocked hat on one side, for he had ten shillings a week more, and the  furnished cottage, kept the keys, kept the men's time, and married a  wife who bore a most extraordinary likeness to a pretty little bantam  hen.    This was three months before the scene just described, but though Jem  spoke in authoritative tones to the men, it was with bated breath to his  little wife, who was standing in the doorway looking as fierce as a  kitten, when Jem walked up in company with his young master.    \"Which I will not find fault before Master Lindon, Jem,\" she said; \"but  you know I do like you to be home punctual to tea.\"    \"Yes, my dear, of course, of course,\" said Jem, apologetically.  \"Not  much past time, and had to shut up first.\"    \"That's what you always say when you're late.  You don't know, Master  Don, what a life he leads me.\"    \"'Tain't true, Master Don,\" cried Jem.  \"She's always a-wherritting me.\"    \"Now I appeal to Master Don: was it me, sir, as was late?  There's the  tea ready, and the bread and butter cut, and the watercresses turning  limp, and the flies getting at the s'rimps.  It arn't your fault, sir, I  know, and I'm not grumbling, but there never was such a place as this  for flies.\"    \"It's the sugar, Sally,\" said Don, who had sauntered aimlessly in with  Jem, and as he stared round the neat little kitchen with the pleasant  meal all ready, he felt as if he should like to stay to tea instead of  going home.    \"Yes, it's the sugar, sir, I know; and you'd think it would sweeten some  people's temper, but it don't.\"    \"Which if it's me you mean, and you're thinking of this morning--\"    \"Which I am, Jem, and you ought to be ashamed.  You grumbled over your  breakfast, and you reg'larly worried your dinner, and all on account of  a button.\"    \"Well, then, you should sew one on.  When a man's married he does expect  to find buttons on his clean shirts.\"    \"Yes, and badly enough you want 'em, making 'em that sticky as you do.\"    \"I can't help that; it's only sugar.\"    \"Only sugar indeed!  And if it was my last words I'd say it--there _was_  a button on the neck.\"    \"Well, I know that,\" cried Jem; \"and what's the good of a button being  on, if it comes off directly you touch it?  Is it any good, Mas' Don?\"    \"Oh, don't ask me,\" cried the lad, half-amused, half annoyed, and  wishing they'd ask him to tea.    \"He dragged it off, Master Don.\"    \"I didn't.\"    \"You did, Jem, and you know you did, just to aggravate me.\"    \"Wasn't half sewn on.\"    \"It was.  I can't sew your buttons on with copper wire.\"    \"You two are just like a girl and boy,\" cried Don.  \"Here you have  everything comfortable about you, and a good place, and you're always  quarrelling.\"    \"Well, it's his fault, sir.\"    \"No, sir, it's her'n.\"    \"It's both your faults, and you ought to be ashamed of yourselves.\"    \"I'm not,\" said Sally; \"and I wish I'd never seen him.\"    \"And I'm sure I wish the same,\" said Jem despondently.  \"I never see  such a temper.\"    \"There, Master Don,\" cried the droll-looking little Dutch doll of a  woman.  \"That's how he is always going on.\"    \"There, Jem, now you've made your poor little wife cry.  You are the  most discontented fellow I ever saw.\"    \"Come, I like that, Master Don; you've a deal to brag about, you have.  Why, you're all at sixes and sevens at home.\"    This was such a home thrust that Don turned angrily and walked out of  the place.    \"There!\" cried Sally.  \"I always knew how it would be.  Master Don was  the best friend we had, and now you've offended him, and driven him  away.\"    \"Shouldn't ha' said nasty things then,\" grumbled Jem, sitting down and  attacking his tea.    \"Now he'll go straight to his uncle and tell him what a man you are.\"    \"Let him,\" said Jem, with his mouth full of bread and butter.    \"And of course you'll lose your place, and we shall be turned out into  the street to starve.\"    \"Will you be quiet, Sally?  How's a man to eat his tea with you going on  like that?\"    \"Turned out into the world without a chance of getting another place.  Oh!  It's too bad.  Why did I ever marry such a man as you?\"    \"'Cause you were glad of the chance,\" grumbled Jem, raising his hand to  pour out some tea, but it was pushed aside indignantly, and the little  woman busily, but with a great show of indignation, filled and sweetened  her husband's cup, which she dabbed down before him, talking all the  while, and finishing with,--    \"You ought to be ashamed of yourself, Jem.\"    \"I am,\""]]]
