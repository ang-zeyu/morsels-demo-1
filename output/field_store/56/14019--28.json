[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19780"],[0,"Report of the National Library Service for the Year Ended 31 March 1958 (#2)"],[1,"to establish a  National Library\" and to consider various other associated matters. The  decision to appoint such a Committee was reaffirmed in February 1958,  the Committee was named shortly afterwards and has since met on several  occasions. Independently of any solution of the accommodation problems  of the Service which such a move might bring, the proposal merits the  most careful consideration.    _Book Stock_--During the year, 19,283 fiction and 35,573 non-fiction  were added to stock, a total of 54,856. Of these, 10,442 separate titles  of non-fiction and 205 fiction titles were added to the headquarters  collection, which now contains approximately 135,000 titles together  with 11,000 volumes of periodicals; 15,305 volumes were  withdrawn--12,134 fiction and 3,171 non-fiction--making the net  additions 39,551. The total of headquarters and Country Library Service  stock now amounts to 652,308, comprising 176,600 fiction and 475,708  non-fiction. As at 31 March 1958 the stock of the School Library Service  was 1,091,189 the grand total of stock in the Service as a whole being  1,743,497.    _Request Service_--All libraries and groups receiving library service  from the Country Library Service and all Government Departments may ask  for special short-term loans of books of an informational type from the  headquarters stock of this Service and, in addition, the headquarters  stock is used extensively to satisfy inter-library loan requests. (See  also the report of the Librarian, National Library Centre.)                       BOOKS REQUESTED AND SUPPLIED                                        Year Ended 31 March     Increase                                           1957      1958       Per Cent    To Country Library Service libraries    55,782    61,870        10.9  To Government Department libraries       6,423     6,998         8.9  To interloan libraries                   8,051     8,801         9.3         Total issues                       70,256    77,669        10.6    During the year, 26,047 requests (an increase of 9.2 per cent) were  referred to Wellington. Of the total issues, 4,975 were books belonging  to other libraries throughout New Zealand, whose willing cooperation is  gratefully acknowledged.    _Expenditure_--Expenditure under Subdivision XII, vote \"Education\", for  the year was L264,956. This figure includes L94,544 for the purchase of  books, of which L45,357 was for books and periodicals on behalf of  Government Departments. The expenditure on behalf of Departments  represents 12,146 books and standing orders for approximately 11,000  serial publications.    Expenditure under Subdivision III for the purchase of books by the  School Library Service was L50,580.    G. T. ALLEY, Director.          SECTION I--COUNTRY LIBRARY SERVICE      On 31 March 1958, 989 towns and small centres were receiving regular  loans of books, an increase of 32 centres over the previous year. In  addition, 54 Ministry of Works, State Hydro-electric, and New Zealand  Forest Service camps and stations were given library service. Books are  also on loan to six places in the Chatham Islands, and to Niue,  Rarotonga, and Pitcairn Island. Free loans of books on a population  basis are given to mental hospitals and prisons situated both in country  and urban districts.    Books, periodicals, and information are available to country people in  the following ways:    (a) Free loans of books on a population basis to libraries controlled by      the local authorities, which in turn agree to make their libraries      free and to maintain reasonable standards of library service.    (b) Loans of books to independent subscription public libraries at a      small annual charge per fifty books loaned.    (c) Loans of books through hamper collections to isolated groups of      readers at a small annual charge.    (d) Free loans of books to lighthouse keepers and similar very remote      readers.    (e) Free loans of books on a population basis to Ministry of Works,      State Hydro-electric, and New Zealand Forest Service camps.    All libraries served under (a) and (b) and the majority under (c)  receive regular visits from one of the especially equipped book vans of  this Service; at least three visits being paid to each library during a  normal year. In addition, all persons, by whichever of the above means  they receive library service, may obtain loans of requested books by  post.      FREE PUBLIC LIBRARIES: \"A\" SERVICE    On 31 March 1958 there were participating in the service 107 libraries  controlled by the following local authorities:    Administrative counties           5  Borough councils                 94  Independent town districts        6  Dependent town districts          2    In addition, the following counties contribute to the funds of a public  library supplying a free service to county residents:    County              Public Library  -----------         --------------  Eltham              Eltham  Patea               Waverley  Wairoa              Wairoa  Golden Bay          Takaka  Lake                Queenstown    These libraries served an estimated local population of 437,000, with a  considerable number in surrounding areas. Besides the many requested  books and periodicals 91,954 books are on regular loan to them.    By arrangement with the Waitemata, Patangata, Egmont, and Rangitikei  County Councils the public libraries at Titirangi, Otane, Opunake, and  Bulls respectively receive a free service.    Library buildings continue to improve. During the year new libraries  were opened in Geraldine, Greymouth, New Lynn, and Morrinsville, and new  buildings are planned in several other centres. This Service continues  to assist in making available material on good overseas practice and New  Zealand achievement. Assistance is also given in the design of the  interiors of libraries and in specifications for equipment.    The best results are achieved when a local authority and the librarian  prepare a written building programme, specifying the functions of the  library, the various areas to be provided, the relationship between  each, the number of books, readers, and librarians to be accommodated,  and the equipment to be housed for efficient service. Such a document  gives a clear directive to the architect, but at the same time allows  him complete freedom of expression in designing the building.    The shortage of trained librarians continues. Three students from the  1957 Library School professional course accepted positions in public  libraries serving centres of under 20,000 population, but they were all  replacements for qualified librarians who had taken library work in  other fields, so there was no net gain. There was at least one public  library in a small town unable to fill its vacancy for a qualified  librarian.    The short course for librarians from smaller centres, held at the  Library School from 12 to 30 August 1957, was of great value to the  participating librarians. The demand for training is very great and,  with such eagerness to learn, the training given is immediately  effective.    Cooperation between libraries participating in the Country Library  Service has been developing slowly. A little more interest has been  shown in the cooperative book-buying scheme fostered by this Service.  There are now 22 libraries taking part. Libraries working together in  this way for the first time this year are Blenheim, Cambridge, Kaikoura,  Morrinsville, Picton, Putaruru, and Te Kuiti.    Assistance in staffing was given to the public libraries at Morrinsville  and Picton for reorganisation and extension of local services. Field  librarians continue to advise and assist on their regular visits.    A collection of 300 books was lent to the New Zealand IGY party at Scott  Base, Ross Dependency, as had been done in the case of the New Zealand  Antarctic Expedition a year earlier.    During the year ministerial approval was given for provision of a  full-time librarian and complete service to be granted to the library at  the new Benmore camp, subject to the Ministry of Works providing a  satisfactory building.    _Book Van_--During the year one of three book vans operating in the  South Island was replaced. Using experience gained in recent  replacements in the North Island the new van is constructed of aluminium  alloy on a four-ton, long-wheel-base chassis. Particular care was taken  in providing good sealing against dust and water, adequate natural  lighting, and the best possible insulation.    Excellent insulation is achieved by a thick layer of expanded  polystyrene on all sides, roof, and floor. Very efficient lighting  without excessive heat problems has been provided by the installation of  two large roof lights of double glazed, toughened, anti-sun polished  plate, the upper light being held an inch above the roof line with a  free flow of air between the panes. This form of construction has  contributed to the good handling qualities of the van. Approximately  2,000 books are carried.    _Minimum Standards for Public Libraries Participating in the Country  Library Service_--Overseas, most national and State organisations  consider it their responsibility to publish statements of standard  library practice, and codes for its evaluation. The most important  statement is _Public Library Service: A Guide to Evaluation, with  Minimum Standards_, which was approved by the Council of the American  Library Association and published by the Association in Chicago in 1956.    In 1952 the New Zealand Library Association Standards Research Committee  prepared its \"Basic Standards for New Zealand Libraries, 1952\", which  was published in _New Zealand Libraries 15_:121-131; 145-150, Jl-Ag, S  '52. This was based on the survey attempted by the visiting American  librarian, Miss Miriam Tompkins, in 1950, but was not a formal  pronouncement of the Association.    For the Country Library"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1980"],[0,"Stories (#2)"],[1,"far off the thing was, and  how accurately it was pointed. If it were any distance, I'd cut sights  on your cross-stick; then a string tied to the end of it, and held in  a plumb-line forward, would lend you pretty near what you wanted. But  surely, Tom, you don't intend to localise the ghost in that way?\"    \"You'll see to-night, old friend--you'll see to-night. I'll carry this  to the Sasassa Valley. You get the loan of Madison's crowbar, and come  with me; but mind you tell no man where you are going, or what you want  it for.\"    All day Tom was walking up and down the room, or working hard at the  apparatus. His eyes were glistening, his cheeks hectic, and he had all  the symptoms of high fever. \"Heaven grant that Dick's diagnosis be not  correct!\" I thought, as I returned with the crowbar; and yet, as evening  drew near, I found myself imperceptibly sharing the excitement.    About six o'clock Tom sprang to his feet and seized his sticks. \"I can  stand it no longer, Jack,\" he cried; \"up with your crowbar, and hey for  Sasassa Valley! To-night's work, my lad, will either make us or mar us!  Take your six-shooter, in case we meet the Kaffirs. I daren't take mine,  Jack,\" he continued, putting his hands upon my shoulders--\"I daren't  take mine; for if my ill luck sticks to me to-night, I don't know what I  might not do with it.\"    Well, having filled our pockets with provisions, we set out, and, as we  took our wearisome way toward the Sasassa Valley, I frequently attempted  to elicit from my companion some clue as to his intentions. But his only  answer was: \"Let us hurry on, Jack. Who knows how many have heard of  Wharton's adventure by this time! Let us hurry on, or we may not be  first in the field!\"    Well, sir, we struggled on through the hills for a matter of ten miles;  till at last, after descending a crag, we saw opening out in front of  us a ravine so sombre and dark that it might have been the gate of  Hades itself; cliffs many hundred feet shut in on every side the gloomy  boulder-studded passage which led through the haunted defile into  Kaffirland. The moon, rising above the crags, threw into strong relief  the rough, irregular pinnacles of rock by which they were topped, while  all below was dark as Erebus.    \"The Sasassa Valley?\" said I.    \"Yes,\" said Tom.    I looked at him. He was calm now; the flush and feverishness had passed  away; his actions were deliberate and slow. Yet there was a certain  rigidity in his face and glitter in his eye which showed that a crisis  had come.    We entered the pass, stumbling along amid the great boulders. Suddenly I  heard a short, quick exclamation from Tom. \"That's the crag!\" he cried,  pointing to a great mass looming before us in the darkness. \"Now, Jack,  for any favour use your eyes! We're about a hundred yards from that  cliff, I take it; so you move slowly toward one side and I'll do the  same toward the other. When you see anything, stop and call out. Don't  take more than twelve inches in a step, and keep your eye fixed on the  cliff about eight feet from the ground. Are you ready?\"    \"Yes.\" I was even more excited than Tom by this time. What his intention  or object was I could not conjecture, beyond that he wanted to examine  by daylight the part of the cliff from which the light came. Yet the  influence of the romantic situation and my companion's suppressed  excitement was so great that I could feel the blood coursing through my  veins and count the pulses throbbing at my temples.    \"Start!\" cried Tom; and we moved off, he to the right, I to the left,  each with our eyes fixed intently on the base of the crag. I had moved  perhaps twenty feet, when in a moment it burst upon me. Through the  growing darkness there shone a small, ruddy, glowing point, the light  from which waned and increased, flickered and oscillated, each change  producing a more weird effect than the last. The old Kaffir superstition  came into my mind, and I felt a cold shudder pass over me. In my  excitement I stepped a pace backward, when instantly the light went out,  leaving utter darkness in its place; but when I advanced again, there  was the ruddy glare glowing from the base of the cliff. \"Tom, Tom!\" I  cried.    \"Ay, ay!\" I heard him exclaim, as he hurried over toward me.    \"There it is--there, up against the cliff!\"    Tom was at my elbow. \"I see nothing,\" said he.    \"Why, there, there, man, in front of you!\" I stepped to the right as I  spoke, when the light instantly vanished from my eyes.    But from Tom's ejaculations of delight it was clear that from my former  position it was visible to him also. \"Jack,\" he cried, as he turned and  wrung my hand--\"Jack, you and I can never complain of our luck again.  Now heap up a few stones where we are standing. That's right. Now we  must fix my sign-post firmly in at the top. There! It would take a  strong wind to blow that down; and we only need it to hold out till  morning. O Jack, my boy, to think that only yesterday we were talking of  becoming clerks, and you saying that no man knew what was awaiting him,  too! By Jove, Jack, it would make a good story!\"    By this time we had firmly fixed the perpendicular stick in between the  two large stones; and Tom bent down and peered along the horizontal one.  For fully a quarter of an hour he was alternately raising and depressing  it, until at last, with a sigh of satisfaction, he fixed the prop into  the angle, and stood up. \"Look along, Jack,\" he said. \"You have as  straight an eye to take a sight as any man I know of.\"    I looked along. There beyond the farther sight was the ruddy,  scintillating speck, apparently at the end of the stick itself, so  accurately had it been adjusted.    \"And now, my boy,\" said Tom, \"let's have some supper and a sleep.  There's nothing more to be done to-night; but we'll need all our wits  and strength to-morrow. Get some sticks and kindle a fire here, and then  we'll be able to keep an eye on our signal-post, and see that nothing  happens to it during the night.\"    Well, sir, we kindled a fire, and had supper with the Sasassa demon's  eye rolling and glowing in front of us the whole night through. Not  always in the same place, though; for after supper, when I glanced along  the sights to have another look at it, it was nowhere to be seen. The  information did not, however, seem to disturb Tom in any way. He merely  remarked, \"It's the moon, not the thing, that has shifted;\" and coiling  himself up, went to sleep.    By early dawn we were both up, and gazing along our pointer at the  cliff; but we could make out nothing save the one dead, monotonous,  slaty surface, rougher perhaps at the part we were examining than  elsewhere, but otherwise presenting nothing remarkable.    \"Now for your idea, Jack!\" said Tom Donahue, unwinding a long thin cord  from round his waist. \"You fasten it, and guide me while I take the  other end.\" So saying, he walked off to the base of the cliff, holding  one end of the cord, while I drew the other taut, and wound it round the  middle of the horizontal stick, passing it through the sight at the end.  By this means I could direct Tom to the right or left, until we had our  string stretching from the point of attachment, through the sight, and  on to the rock, which it struck about eight feet from the ground. Tom  drew a chalk circle of about three feet diameter round the spot, and  then called to me to come and join him. \"We've managed this business  together, Jack,\" he said, \"and we'll find what we are to find,  together.\" The circle he had drawn embraced a part of the rock smoother  than the rest, save that about the centre there were a few rough  protuberances or knobs. One of these Tom pointed to with a cry of  delight. It was a roughish, brownish mass about the size of a man's  closed fist, and looking like a bit of dirty glass let into the wall of  the cliff. \"That's it!\" he cried--\"that's it!\"    \"That's what?\"    \"Why, man, _a diamond_, and such a one as there isn't a monarch in  Europe but would envy Tom Donahue the possession of. Up with your  crowbar, and we'll soon exorcise the demon of Sasassa Valley!\"    I was so astounded that for a moment I stood speechless with surprise,  gazing at the treasure which had so unexpectedly fallen into our hands.    \"Here, hand me the crowbar,\" said Tom. \"Now, by using this little round  knob which projects from the cliff here as a fulcrum, we may be able to  lever it off. Yes; there it goes. I never thought it could have come so  easily. Now, Jack, the sooner we get back to our hut and then down to  Cape Town, the better.\"    We wrapped up our treasure, and made our way across the hills toward  home. On the way, Tom told me how, while a law student in the Middle  Temple, he had come upon a dusty pamphlet in the library, by one Jans  van Hounym, which told of an experience very similar to ours, which  had befallen that worthy Dutchman in the latter part of the seventeenth  century, and which resulted in the discovery of a luminous diamond. This  tale it was which had come into Tom's head as he listened to honest Dick  Wharton's ghost-story, while the means which he had adopted to verify  his supposition sprang from his own fertile Irish brain.    \"We'll take it down to Cape Town,\" continued Tom, \"and if we can't  dispose of it with advantage there, it will be worth our while to ship  for London with it. Let us go along to Madison's first, though; he knows  something of these things, and can perhaps give us some idea of what we  may consider a fair price for our treasure.\"    We turned off from the track accordingly, before reaching our hut, and  kept along the narrow path leading to Madison's farm. He was at lunch  when we entered; and in a minute we were seated at each side of him,  enjoying South African hospitality.    \"Well,\" he said, after the servants were gone, \"what's in the wind now?  I see you have something to say to me. What is it?\"   "]]]
