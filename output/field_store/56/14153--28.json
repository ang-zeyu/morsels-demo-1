The  wife, of course, earnestly and constantly desired to rejoin her husband.  The father and sister declined to facilitate her doing so by paying the  expense of her return journey, concluding that if her husband was unable  to meet that outlay, he was not in a position to maintain her beside  himself.    After some six or eight years of mutual longing for each other's  society, separated by the distance of London from Aberdeen, William  Burton succeeded in exchanging his position in the Fencibles for a  lieutenancy in a line regiment under orders for India. There also he  went unaccompanied by his wife. After brief service in India he had to  return home in ill health. Then at last the husband and wife were  reunited; first to live together for a time in Aberdeen--afterwards to  go with their two sons to Jersey.    The eldest son, William, ten years older than John, afterwards went into  the Indian army, and died in India, leaving a son and daughter.    John Hill Burton's earliest recollections dated from his stay with his  parents in garrison in Jersey. This must have been about the year 1811  or 1812, when he was therefore two or three years old. He used to say he  remembered the relieving of guard in Jersey; that he had an infantine  recollection of a military guard-room by night; and remembered a \"Lady  Fanny,\" the wife, as he believed, of the colonel of the regiment, who  showed some slight kindness towards him and other garrison children.    The greatest adventure of Dr Burton's unadventurous life occurred when  he was returning with his parents from Jersey, in a troop-ship. The  vessel was chased by a French privateer, and for some time the little  family had reason to fear becoming inmates of a French prison. It was  this incident which Dr Burton used in his later life to say entitled him  to assert that he had been in the Peninsular War. The homeward journey  from Jersey was to Aberdeen, which it is believed Lieutenant Burton and  his family never left again till his death. His failing health obliged  him to retire from active service on the half-pay of a lieutenant. His  wife, from some writings to be hereafter mentioned, seems also to have  enjoyed an allowance of L40 per annum from her father.    Besides William and John Hill, there were born in Aberdeen to William  Burton and Eliza Paton three sons--two of whom died early, one of them  being accidentally drowned in the Don at Grandholm--and one daughter.  The surviving brother of Dr Burton is a retired medical officer of the  East India Company. The sister, Mary, remains unmarried.    The little household established in Aberdeen about the year 1812 knew  the woes of failing health and narrow means, part of the latter doled  out to them by an unwilling hand. Lieutenant Burton's health continued  to decline till his death, about the year 1819. His son John was then  ten years old, and had begun his school education.    His recollections of schools and schoolmasters were vivid and  picturesque. The one schoolmaster--almost the only teacher--to whom he  acknowledged any obligation, was James Melvin. To him, he was wont to  say, he owed his good Scotch knowledge of Latin; and he delighted even  till the end of his life in dwelling on Dr Melvin's methods of teaching,  and on the fine spirit of generous emulation and eagerness for knowledge  which inspired his pupils.    Both before and after the time of his studies under Dr Melvin he had  experience of schoolmasters of a different type. The tales of flogging  under these pedagogues were so absolutely sickening, that Dr Burton's  family used to beg him to stop his narrations to spare their feelings.  He had beheld, though he had never undergone, the old-fashioned process  of flogging by _heezing up_ the culprit on the back of the  school-porter, so as to bring his bare back close to the master's lash.  The trembling victim, anticipating such punishment, used to be sent to  summon the porter. He frequently returned with a half-sobbing message,  \"Please, sir, _he says_ he's not in.\" The fiction did not lead to  escape. Cromar was the name of the chief executioner in these scenes.  Detested by his pupils, he was a victim to every sort of petty  persecution from them, so that cruelty acted and reacted between him and  them. On one memorable occasion he flogged John Burton with such  violence as to cause to himself an internal rupture.    The offence which led to this unmeasured punishment was \"looking  impudent!\"--and the look of supposed impudence was produced by a  temporarily swollen lip; but the swollen lip was the effect of a single  combat with a schoolfellow; and fighting was so rife, and so severely  repressed, that it appeared less dangerous to meet the consequences of  the supposed impertinent face than those of the battle. The unfortunate  pupil of course continued to grimace, and the wretched schoolmaster to  flog, till the pupil streamed with blood, and the master sat down from  sheer exhaustion and an injury from which he never recovered.    Before John Hill Burton had completed his course at the grammar school  he gained a bursary by competition, and began his studies at Marischal  College. The open competition for bursaries at Aberdeen was a subject  on which he delighted to talk, often with tears of enthusiasm in his  eyes. The entire impartiality, the complete openness of these  competitions to the whole world, the spectacle of high learning freely  offered to whoever could by merit earn it, seemed to Dr Burton, to his  life's end, as fine a subject of contemplation as any the world could  offer. During his last illness, a friend, who knew his strong interest  in his Alma Mater, presented him with Mr M'Lean's 'Life at a Northern  University.' He read it with the utmost delight, often reading passages  aloud with great emotion, on account of the vivid picture they presented  of the scenes of his youth. It was a rough hard life that of an Aberdeen  College student fifty or sixty years ago.    Mr M'Lean says of his fellow-students: \"As the most of them came from  the country--generally from the Highlands and Western Islands of  Scotland--they brought with them all their native roughness and  coarseness of manners. The great majority of those who had spent their  lives in town frequented the neighbouring university,[1] where the  entrance and other examinations were not nearly so severe. In general,  the great bulk of the students were far behind in good manners, and that  polish which a large town always gives. Their secluded habits when at  college, and their intercourse only with their own number, prevented any  improvement in this matter. On the whole, their conduct in the class,  and their behaviour towards some of the professors, were anything but  gentlemanly.\"[2]    [Footnote 1: Marischal College. Mr M'Lean's descriptions refer to  King's; but the two colleges, close together, must have been pretty  similar in their manners and customs even before they were, as they now  are, formally united.]    [Footnote 2: Life in a Northern University. By Neil M'Lean, author of  'Memoirs of Marshal Keith,' 'Romance of the Seal and Whale Fishing,'  &c., &c. Glasgow; John S. Marr & Sons: London; Simpkin, Marshall, & Co.  1874.]    Another quotation from Mr M'Lean may be allowed, as embodying the  descriptions often given by Dr Burton of the motley crew of competitors  for the scholarships and bursaries dispensed by the university: \"Gazing  round the room, I noted that my competitors consisted of raw-boned  red-haired Highlandmen, fresh from their native hills, with all their  rusticity about them. All the northern counties had sent their quota to  swell the number, and even the Orkney and Shetland Islands were  represented. Many rosy-faced young fellows were also to be seen, who had  left their country occupations for a little, and who, if  unsuccessful\"--_i.e._, in gaining a bursary--\"would return to them, and  work in their leisure hours at their favourite classics until another  competition came round. Here and there were to be seen a few rather  better dressed than the rest; whilst amongst the crowd the eye rested on  many a studious, thin, cadaverous, hard-worked face, which made you look  again, and feel in your heart that there sat a bursar. A more motley  crowd, as respects age, dress, and features, could scarcely be found  anywhere; and yet over all there was an intellectual, manly look, a look  of innocence and unacquaintance with the low ways of the world.\"[3]    [Footnote 3: Life in a Northern University.]    Among this motley crowd John Hill Burton was no model student. He took  his full share of the rough sport so well described in the 'Northern  University'--wrenched off door-knockers and house-bells, transplanted  sign-boards, &c. He was but a schoolboy in years when he left school for  college, and his mother was frequently obliged to provide him with a  private tutor, not so much to assist him in his studies as to keep him  from idleness during his hours at home. Home was, during these years,  for a time sad, and was always quiet. During his father's lifetime it  was diversified by frequent changes of abode within a very narrow  circuit.    The writer has seen some half-dozen small houses, in a rather unlovely  suburb of Aberdeen, all within sight of each other, which had  successively been inhabited by Lieutenant Burton and his family; the  poor invalid craving for the real change which might have benefited his  health, and seeking relief, instead, in constant change of house. Mrs  Burton was entitled to an abode at Grandholm as well as her sisters, and  the little family went there occasionally, at least after Lieutenant  Burton's death. The place, which is a rather interesting one, filled a  considerable space in the affections of the children. Its inmates did  not.

THE TRANSFORMATION OF ROME FROM A PAGAN INTO A CHRISTIAN CITY.[1]         The early adoption of Christianity not confined to the poorer       classes.--Instances of Roman nobles who were Christians.--The       family of the Acilii Glabriones.--Manius Acilius the consul.--Put       to death because of his religion.--Description of his tomb,       recently discovered.--Other Christian patricians.--How was it       possible for men in public office to serve both Christ and       Caesar?--The usual liberality of the emperors towards the new       religion.--Nevertheless an open profession of faith hazardous and       frequently avoided.--Marriages between Christians and       pagans.--Apostasy resulting from these.--Curious discovery       illustrating the attitude of Seneca's family towards       Christianity.--Christians in the army.--The gradual nature of the       transformation of Rome.--The significance of the inscription on       the Arch of Constantine.--The readiness of the early Church to       adopt pagan customs and even myths.--The curious mixture of pagan       and Christian conceptions which grew out of this.--Churches       became repositories for classical works of art, for which new       interpretations were invented.--The desire of the early       Christians to make their churches as beautiful as possible.--The       substitution of Christian shrines for the old pagan altars at       street corners.--Examples of both.--The bathing accommodations of       the pagan temples adopted by the Church.--Also the custom of       providing public standards of weights and measures.--These set up       in the basilicas.--How their significance became perverted in the       Dark Ages.--The adoption of funerary banquets and their       degeneration.--The public store-houses of the emperors and those       of the popes.--Pagan rose-festivals and their conversion into a       Christian institution.      It has been contended, and many still believe, that in ancient Rome  the doctrines of Christ found no proselytes, except among the lower  and poorer classes of citizens. That is certainly a noble picture  which represents the new faith as searching among the haunts of  poverty and slavery, seeking to inspire faith, hope, and charity in  their occupants; to transform them from things into human beings; to  make them believe in the happiness of a future life; to alleviate  their present sufferings; to redeem their children from shame and  servitude; to proclaim them equal to their masters. But the gospel  found its way also to the mansions of the masters, nay, even to the  palace of the Caesars. The discoveries lately made on this subject are  startling, and constitute a new chapter in the history of imperial  Rome. We have been used to consider early Christian history and  primitive Christian art as matters of secondary importance, and hardly  worthy the attention of the classical student. Thus, none of the four  or five hundred volumes on the topography of ancient Rome speaks of  the basilicas raised by Constantine; of the church of S. Maria  Antiqua, built side by side with the Temple of Vesta, the two worships  dwelling together as it were, for nearly a century; of the Christian  burial-grounds; of the imperial mausoleum near S. Peter's; of the  porticoes, several miles in length, which led from the centre of the  city to the churches of S. Peter, S. Paul, and S. Lorenzo; of the  palace of the Caesars transformed into the residence of the Popes. Why  should these constructions of monumental and historical character be  expelled from the list of classical buildings? and why should we  overlook the fact that many great names in the annals of the empire  are those of members of the Church, especially when the knowledge of  their conversion enables us to explain events that had been, up to the  latest discoveries, shrouded in mystery?    It is a remarkable fact that the record of some of these events should  be found, not in church annals, calendars, or itineraries, but in  passages in the writings of pagan annalists and historians. Thus, in  ecclesiastical documents no mention is made of the conversion of the  two Domitillae, or Flavius Clemens, or Petronilla, all of whom were  relatives of the Flavian emperors; and of the Acilii Glabriones, the  noblest among the noble, as Herodianus calls them (2, 3). Their  fortunes and death are described only by the Roman historians and  biographers of the time of Domitian. It seems that when the official  _feriale_, or calendar, was resumed, after the end of the  persecutions, preference was given to names of those confessors and  martyrs whose deeds were still fresh in the memory of the living, and  of necessity little attention was paid to those of the first and  second centuries, whose acts either had not been written down, or had  been lost during the persecutions.    As the crypt of the Acilii Glabriones on the Via Salaria has become  one of the chief places of attraction, since its re-discovery in 1888,  I cannot begin this volume under better auspices than by giving an  account of this important event.[2]    In exploring that portion of the Catacombs of Priscilla which lies  under the Monte delle Gioie, near the entrance from the Via Salaria,  de Rossi observed that the labyrinth of the galleries converged  towards an original crypt, shaped like a Greek [Greek: G] (Gamma), and  decorated with frescoes. The desire of finding the name and the  history of the first occupants of this noble tomb, whose memory seems  to have been so dear to the faithful, led the explorers to carefully  sift the earth which filled the place; and their pains were rewarded  by the discovery of a fragment of a marble coffin, inscribed with the  letters: ACILIO GLABRIONI FILIO.    [Illustration: Tablet of Acilius Glabrio.]    Did this fragment really belong to the [Greek: G] crypt, or had it  been thrown there by mere chance? And in case of its belonging to the  crypt, was it an isolated record, or did it belong to a group of  graves of the"]]]
