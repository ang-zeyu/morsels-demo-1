The quartermaster, not without pardonable pride, took me over the stores  in which the men's kits are prepared. There were hundreds of racks  containing bundles so cunningly rolled that you could see at a glance  what was in each. And beside each bundle was a valise already packed  with everything that a campaigner could need; indeed, when I read the  printed list showing what was in each my heart warmed with the same joy  that I felt when I first read _Robinson Crusoe_. Government, who is  rigorous and unyielding as a disciplinarian to her soldiers, is a mother  to them in her provision for their wants. Each bag contained a knife,  fork, spoon, tin canteen, shaving brush, soap, razor, boot brushes,  clothes brush, hair brush, pipeclay, button polisher, cleaning paste,  and a dozen other things just as interesting and as useful. Out of  curiosity I opened a housewife, and my heart was touched with the almost  feminine consideration that it indicated; for there, cunningly folded  up, were skeins of wool and cotton in many different shades, as well as  half a dozen sizes of needles. Surely the War Office is human, and not  the strange machine that some of us esteem it, for how else could it  provide that Tommy shall not have to darn his socks with scarlet, nor  his tunic with grey, nor his trousers with white wool? As the men came  into the stores each one received his share of these excellent things,  and the quartermaster's sergeants displayed quite a genius in estimating  and fitting the various proportions of the men. And the men's eyes  brightened at the sight of the glorious new red cloth; I believe that,  although they wore it for a few days only, it did much to reconcile  them with the inconvenience and hardship that some of them endured in  rejoining. Khaki uniforms were served out later.    All round the barrack square the men stood in groups as I have  described, and in one corner were clusters of men arrayed in their new  garments. One could read pretty easily in their faces the story of the  last few days. One saw several men who had evidently risen in the world  since they had left the army. They had an air of sleekness and delicacy  that made them seem out of place. Others had evidently been going down  in the social scale, and wore their new clothes like fine feathers. Some  were evidently glad at the prospect of action and excitement, and fell  back into the regimental routine as a man sits down in a comfortable  chair. To others, not a few, all this hustle was an act in a domestic  tragedy. Sometimes it was a comedy, as in the case of one man who had  built up a \"nice little butchering business,\" snatching his profits from  the niggard hand of competition; and now he must go forth to kill men,  leaving his rival master in the field of domestic butchery. But the  comedies were few, or else I did not come across them, for it was the  serious side of this business that impressed me the most. Men caught  away from new-found family joys, not for personal advancement or glory,  but to take their places as units in the huge war-machine that is fed  with human bodies. It is so easy to speak and think of \"losses\" when we  count them by the hundred; it is so hard and bitter to think of one  death and all that it means when one stands and speaks to a soldier. I  found one man standing apart by himself--a young man, with a good,  clean, hardy face--and there were tears in his eyes. As I was passing he  asked me what time it was, and in a few minutes he told me his story. He  had been married two years; he had one little child; he had left his  wife dying of pneumonia. That was all; but I think one can hardly  realise how much it meant. I should like some civilians who do their  soldiering in an armchair, and who really seem to like a war for the  spice with which it flavours their newspaper, to have seen that man and  heard his short tale of misery.[1] He is, of course, one of the few on  whom an admirable system inflicts a fearful wound; but he is an example  (if one were needed) of the matchless discipline that can teach a man  to obey without question or complaint a command that has two edges for  death. I am glad to say that I met no other man in half so dreadful a  plight as his, but there were dozens of men to whom the order came as an  ending of happiness, and of course one knew, although the thought was  not dwelt upon, that many of the little homes of which these men had  been the centre and support would have that support no more. Yet of one  thing I am very sure. Not one of the men to whom I spoke but was willing  and anxious to serve his country; not one but looked proud to be wearing  the old uniform again. The sadness and trouble was all in the  retrospect, not in the outlook. Tommy Atkins, with his great, simple,  conspicuous vices and his obscure, surprising, and enduring virtues was  unconsciously putting into practice the precept of a certain Old  Buccaneer: _No regrets; they unman the heart we want for to-morrow._    [Footnote 1: This man's wife died a week after he had sailed.]          II    HOW THE ARMY LEFT ENGLAND      The few days that elapsed between rejoining and embarkation were spent  by the Reservist at the depot barracks of his regiment, where he  received his kit and underwent the small amount of drill necessary to  remove the rust of civilian life. After that, the sound of reveille in  the depth of a winter night; the sudden awakening; the hasty breakfast,  eaten like a Passover feast; the long and noisy railway journey; the  faint, salt smell of the sea, and the first sight of it through the  rainy dawn. In the early days of the war I was present at many  embarkations at Liverpool and Southampton, and they left an impression  on my mind which will not easily be effaced. For, even to an onlooker,  the embarkation of troops, with its sights and sounds of tragedy, is an  affair that burns itself into the memory; one is dazzled and confounded  by the number and variety of the small dramas that are enacted before  one's eyes; and the whole is framed in a setting of military system and  circumstance that lends dignity, if that were needed, to the humble  tragedies of the moment.    Only a few of the thousands who came to watch the departure of the  _Canada_ from Liverpool one December morning were allowed inside the  dock shed; nearly all of those within the gate were sweethearts and  wives and children of soldiers who had contrived to procure passes for  them. Even in the shed the scene was one of extraordinary confusion. At  intervals of about half an hour detachments were marched in and formed  up at one end of the shed, where they left their bundles and heavy kit,  and whence they were marched in single file up the gangway of the ship.  With the exception of the Manchesters, all the troops were in khaki, and  were easily distinguishable from the dark-coloured mass of civilians.  Thus there was always a yellow pool of colour in the midst of the black  mass, and all the morning a thin yellow line flowed from the pool to the  ship's gangway. As often as one looked, during the whole morning, there  was a line of men in the act of ascending the gangway. One felt as  though one had fallen asleep for a moment and dreamed, and waked again  to find the same men in the same position, so little did the appearance  of things change. It was really a picture that one looked at, for the  colours and bold outlines remained constant; the eye at times grew used  to the minute movement, and refused to notice that the picture was  preserved only because the same things were being done over and over  again by hundreds of different people. The same greetings as friends  recognised the newly-arrived man, the same hurried words, the same  faltering voices, the same desperate embraces, the same endless tramp  from the formed ranks to the ship, the same tears. The absorption of so  many acute personal emotions into one revolving routine was the most  amazing part of it; the stream of discipline and system ran swift and  deep here, drawing into its flood even the most sacred and intimate of  human experiences, and turning into a pattern the parting of husband  from wife and father from child. When at length one became used to the  picture one began to notice the elements of its composition, and only in  watching them could one gain relief from the overburdening sense of  personality submerged in a system. The little dramas were very strange  and very affecting. I can only give a few examples out of dozens that I  watched.    As the troops came in at the door, marching four deep, the crowd formed  on each side, and those who had friends in the detachment tried to get a  prominent place in the front rank of the crowd, where they could attract  the attention of the soldiers as they passed. The men were not hurried,  and they were marching at ease, so there was generally time for a few  words and a kiss or a hand-clasp before they were moved on. One wife,  who was little more than a girl, had taken a good place on the edge of  the crowd when her husband's detachment began to file in. I heard her  telling a friend that she had not said good-bye to \"her lad,\" as she  wanted to see the last of him; it had been arranged that she was to be  near when he passed so that he could give her a parting kiss. Oh, how  anxiously she scanned the faces of the men as they swung into sight,  throwing all her soul into her eyes!    Presently, \"There he is!\" she cried; \"here, Jim, I'm here!\"    The young man's fine honest face had a look no less intent than hers,  but it was turned away from her; he was searching as eagerly as she, but  on the wrong side of the lane of people; and by one of those impish  tricks that Fate plays upon us in acute moments, he never saw her,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2388"],[0,"The Song Celestial; Or, Bhagavad-Gîtâ (from the Mahâbhârata) (#2)"],[1,"whose sake life was fair, and pleasure pleased,    And power grew precious:-grandsires, sires, and sons,    Brothers, and fathers-in-law, and sons-in-law,    Elders and friends! Shall I deal death on these    Even though they seek to slay us? Not one blow,    O Madhusudan! will I strike to gain      The rule of all Three Worlds; then, how much less    To seize an earthly kingdom! Killing these    Must breed but anguish, Krishna! If they be    Guilty, we shall grow guilty by their deaths;    Their sins will light on us, if we shall slay    Those sons of Dhritirashtra, and our kin;    What peace could come of that, O Madhava?    For if indeed, blinded by lust and wrath,    These cannot see, or will not see, the sin    Of kingly lines o'erthrown and kinsmen slain,    How should not we, who see, shun such a crime--    We who perceive the guilt and feel the shame--    O thou Delight of Men, Janardana?    By overthrow of houses perisheth    Their sweet continuous household piety,    And-rites neglected, piety extinct--    Enters impiety upon that home;    Its women grow unwomaned, whence there spring    Mad passions, and the mingling-up of castes,    Sending a Hell-ward road that family,    And whoso wrought its doom by wicked wrath.    Nay, and the souls of honoured ancestors    Fall from their place of peace, being bereft    Of funeral-cakes and the wan death-water.[FN#1]    So teach our holy hymns. Thus, if we slay    Kinsfolk and friends for love of earthly power,    Ahovat! what an evil fault it were!    Better I deem it, if my kinsmen strike,    To face them weaponless, and bare my breast    To shaft and spear, than answer blow with blow.      So speaking, in the face of those two hosts,    Arjuna sank upon his chariot-seat,    And let fall bow and arrows, sick at heart.      HERE ENDETH CHAPTER I. OF THE BHAGAVAD-GITA,    Entitled \"Arjun-Vishad,\"    Or \"The Book of the Distress of Arjuna.\"            CHAPTER II        Sanjaya.    Him, filled with such compassion and such grief,    With eyes tear-dimmed, despondent, in stern words    The Driver, Madhusudan, thus addressed:      Krishna.    How hath this weakness taken thee? Whence springs    The inglorious trouble, shameful to the brave,    Barring the path of virtue? Nay, Arjun!    Forbid thyself to feebleness! it mars    Thy warrior-name! cast off the coward-fit!    Wake! Be thyself! Arise, Scourge of thy Foes!      Arjuna.    How can I, in the battle, shoot with shafts    On Bhishma, or on Drona-O thou Chief!--    Both worshipful, both honourable men?      Better to live on beggar's bread      With those we love alive,    Than taste their blood in rich feasts spread,      And guiltily survive!    Ah! were it worse-who knows?--to be      Victor or vanquished here,    When those confront us angrily      Whose death leaves living drear?    In pity lost, by doubtings tossed,      My thoughts-distracted-turn    To Thee, the Guide I reverence most,      That I may counsel learn:    I know not what would heal the grief      Burned into soul and sense,    If I were earth's unchallenged chief--      A god--and these gone thence!      Sanjaya.    So spake Arjuna to the Lord of  Hearts,    And sighing,\"I will not fight!\" held silence then.    To whom, with tender smile, (O Bharata! )    While the Prince wept despairing 'twixt those hosts,    Krishna made answer in divinest verse:      Krishna.    Thou grievest where no grief should be! thou speak'st    Words lacking wisdom! for the wise in heart    Mourn not for those that live, nor those that die.    Nor I, nor thou, nor any one of these,    Ever was not, nor ever will not be,    For ever and for ever afterwards.    All, that doth live, lives always! To man's frame    As there come infancy and youth and age,    So come there raisings-up and layings-down    Of other and of other life-abodes,    Which the wise know, and fear not. This that irks--    Thy sense-life, thrilling to the elements--    Bringing thee heat and cold, sorrows and joys,    'Tis brief and mutable! Bear with it, Prince!    As the wise bear. The soul which is not moved,    The soul that with a strong and constant calm    Takes sorrow and takes joy indifferently,    Lives in the life undying! That which is    Can never cease to be; that which is not    Will not exist. To see this truth of both    Is theirs who part essence from accident,    Substance from shadow. Indestructible,    Learn thou! the Life is, spreading life through all;    It cannot anywhere, by any means,    Be anywise diminished, stayed, or changed.    But for these fleeting frames which it informs    With spirit deathless, endless, infinite,    They perish. Let them perish, Prince! and fight!    He who shall say, \"Lo! I have slain a man!\"    He who shall think, \"Lo! I am slain!\" those both    Know naught! Life cannot slay. Life is not slain!    Never the spirit was born; the spirit shall cease to be never;    Never was time it was not; End and Beginning are dreams!    Birthless and deathless and changeless remaineth the spirit for ever;    Death hath not touched it at all, dead though the house of it seems!      Who knoweth it exhaustless, self-sustained,    Immortal, indestructible,--shall such    Say, \"I have killed a man, or caused to kill?\"      Nay, but as when one layeth      His worn-out robes away,    And taking new ones, sayeth,      \"These will I wear to-day!\"    So putteth by the spirit      Lightly its garb of flesh,    And passeth to inherit      A residence afresh.      I say to thee weapons reach not the Life;    Flame burns it not, waters cannot o'erwhelm,    Nor dry winds wither it. Impenetrable,    Unentered, unassailed, unharmed, untouched,    Immortal, all-arriving, stable, sure,    Invisible, ineffable, by word    And thought uncompassed, ever all itself,    Thus is the Soul declared! How wilt thou, then,--    Knowing it so,--grieve when thou shouldst not grieve?    How, if thou hearest that the man new-dead    Is, like the man new-born, still living man--    One same, existent Spirit--wilt thou weep?    The end of birth is death; the end of death    Is birth: this is ordained! and mournest thou,    Chief of the stalwart arm! for what befalls    Which could not otherwise befall? The birth    Of living things comes unperceived; the death    Comes unperceived; between them, beings perceive:    What is there sorrowful herein, dear Prince?      Wonderful, wistful, to contemplate!      Difficult, doubtful, to speak upon!    Strange and great for tongue to relate,      Mystical hearing for every one!    Nor wotteth man this, what a marvel it is,      When seeing, and saying, and hearing are done!      This Life within all living things, my Prince!    Hides beyond harm; scorn thou to suffer, then,    For that which cannot suffer. Do thy part!    Be mindful of thy name, and tremble not!    Nought better can betide a martial soul    Than lawful war; happy the warrior    To whom comes joy of battle--comes, as now,    Glorious and fair, unsought; opening for him    A gateway unto Heav'n. But, if thou shunn'st    This honourable field--a Kshattriya--    If, knowing thy duty and thy task, thou bidd'st    Duty and task go by--that shall be sin!    And those to come shall speak thee infamy    From age to age; but infamy is worse    For men of noble blood to bear than death!    The chiefs upon their battle-chariots    Will deem 'twas fear that drove thee from the fray.    Of those who held thee mighty-souled the scorn    Thou must abide, while all thine enemies    Will scatter bitter speech of thee, to mock    The valour which thou hadst; what fate could fall    More grievously than this? Either--being killed--    Thou wilt win Swarga's safety, or--alive    And victor--thou wilt reign an earthly king.    Therefore, arise, thou Son of Kunti! brace    Thine arm for conflict, nerve thy heart to meet--    As things alike to thee--pleasure or pain,    Profit or ruin, victory or defeat:    So minded, gird thee to the fight, for so    Thou shalt not sin!      Thus far I speak to thee    As from the \"Sankhya\"--unspiritually--    Hear now the deeper teaching of the Yog,    Which holding, understanding, thou shalt burst    Thy Karmabandh, the bondage of wrought deeds.    Here shall no end be hindered, no hope marred,    No loss be feared: faith--yea, a little faith--    Shall save thee from the anguish of thy dread.    Here, Glory of the Kurus! shines one rule--    One steadfast rule--while shifting souls have laws    Many and hard. Specious, but wrongful deem    The speech of those ill-taught ones who extol    The letter of their Vedas, saying, \"This    Is all we have, or need;\" being weak at heart    With wants, seekers of Heaven: which comes--they say--    As \"fruit of good deeds done;\" promising men    Much profit in new births for works of faith;    In various rites abounding; following whereon    Large merit shall accrue towards wealth and power;    Albeit, who wealth and power do most desire    Least fixity of soul have such, least hold    On heavenly meditation. Much these teach,    From Veds, concerning the \"three qualities;\"    But thou, be free of the \"three qualities,\"    Free of the \"pairs of opposites,\"[FN#2] and free    From that sad righteousness which calculates;    Self-ruled, Arjuna! simple, satisfied![FN#3]    Look! like as when a tank pours water forth    To suit all needs, so do these Brahmans draw    Text for all wants from tank of Holy Writ.    But thou, want not! ask not! Find full reward    Of doing right in right! Let right deeds be    Thy motive, not the fruit which comes from them.    And live in action! Labour! Make thine acts    Thy piety, casting all self aside,    Contemning gain and merit; equable    In good or evil: equability    Is Yog, is piety!      Yet, the right act    Is less, far less, than the right-thinking mind.    Seek refuge in thy soul; have there thy heaven!    Scorn them that follow virtue for her gifts!    The mind of pure devotion--ev"]]]
