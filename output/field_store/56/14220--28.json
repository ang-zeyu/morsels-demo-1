I thought nothing  of it at the time.  Near the end of dinner a note was handed in by the  servant.  I noticed that after my host had read it he seemed even more  distrait and strange than before.  He gave up all pretence at  conversation and sat, smoking endless cigarettes, lost in his own  thoughts, but he made no remark as to the contents.  About eleven I was  glad to go to bed.  Some time later Garcia looked in at my door--the  room was dark at the time--and asked me if I had rung.  I said that I  had not.  He apologized for having disturbed me so late, saying that it  was nearly one o'clock.  I dropped off after this and slept soundly all  night.    \"And now I come to the amazing part of my tale.  When I woke it was  broad daylight.  I glanced at my watch, and the time was nearly nine.  I had particularly asked to be called at eight, so I was very much  astonished at this forgetfulness.  I sprang up and rang for the  servant.  There was no response.  I rang again and again, with the same  result.  Then I came to the conclusion that the bell was out of order.  I huddled on my clothes and hurried downstairs in an exceedingly bad  temper to order some hot water.  You can imagine my surprise when I  found that there was no one there.  I shouted in the hall.  There was  no answer.  Then I ran from room to room. All were deserted.  My host  had shown me which was his bedroom the night before, so I knocked at  the door. No reply.  I turned the handle and walked in.  The room was  empty, and the bed had never been slept in.  He had gone with the rest.  The foreign host, the foreign footman, the foreign cook, all had  vanished in the night!  That was the end of my visit to Wisteria Lodge.\"    Sherlock Holmes was rubbing his hands and chuckling as he added this  bizarre incident to his collection of strange episodes.    \"Your experience is, so far as I know, perfectly unique,\" said he.  \"May I ask, sir, what you did then?\"    \"I was furious.  My first idea was that I had been the victim of some  absurd practical joke.  I packed my things, banged the hall door behind  me, and set off for Esher, with my bag in my hand. I called at Allan  Brothers', the chief land agents in the village, and found that it was  from this firm that the villa had been rented.  It struck me that the  whole proceeding could hardly be for the purpose of making a fool of  me, and that the main object must be to get out of the rent.  It is  late in March, so quarter-day is at hand.  But this theory would not  work.  The agent was obliged to me for my warning, but told me that the  rent had been paid in advance.  Then I made my way to town and called  at the Spanish embassy.  The man was unknown there.  After this I went  to see Melville, at whose house I had first met Garcia, but I found  that he really knew rather less about him than I did. Finally when I  got your reply to my wire I came out to you, since I gather that you  are a person who gives advice in difficult cases.  But now, Mr.  Inspector, I understand, from what you said when you entered the room,  that you can carry the story on, and that some tragedy had occurred. I  can assure you that every word I have said is the truth, and that,  outside of what I have told you, I know absolutely nothing about the  fate of this man.  My only desire is to help the law in every possible  way.\"    \"I am sure of it, Mr. Scott Eccles--I am sure of it,\" said Inspector  Gregson in a very amiable tone.  \"I am bound to say that everything  which you have said agrees very closely with the facts as they have  come to our notice.  For example, there was that note which arrived  during dinner.  Did you chance to observe what became of it?\"    \"Yes, I did.  Garcia rolled it up and threw it into the fire.\"    \"What do you say to that, Mr. Baynes?\"    The country detective was a stout, puffy, red man, whose face was only  redeemed from grossness by two extraordinarily bright eyes, almost  hidden behind the heavy creases of cheek and brow.  With a slow smile  he drew a folded and discoloured scrap of paper from his pocket.    \"It was a dog-grate, Mr. Holmes, and he overpitched it.  I picked this  out unburned from the back of it.\"    Holmes smiled his appreciation.    \"You must have examined the house very carefully to find a single  pellet of paper.\"    \"I did, Mr. Holmes.  It's my way.  Shall I read it, Mr. Gregson?\"    The Londoner nodded.    \"The note is written upon ordinary cream-laid paper without watermark.  It is a quarter-sheet.  The paper is cut off in two snips with a  short-bladed scissors.  It has been folded over three times and sealed  with purple wax, put on hurriedly and pressed down with some flat oval  object.  It is addressed to Mr. Garcia, Wisteria Lodge. It says:    \"Our own colours, green and white.  Green open, white shut.  Main  stair, first corridor, seventh right, green baize.  Godspeed.  D.    \"It is a woman's writing, done with a sharp-pointed pen, but the  address is either done with another pen or by someone else.  It is  thicker and bolder, as you see.\"    \"A very remarkable note,\" said Holmes, glancing it over.  \"I must  compliment you, Mr. Baynes, upon your attention to detail in your  examination of it.  A few trifling points might perhaps be added. The  oval seal is undoubtedly a plain sleeve-link--what else is of such a  shape?  The scissors were bent nail scissors.  Short as the two snips  are, you can distinctly see the same slight curve in each.\"    The country detective chuckled.    \"I thought I had squeezed all the juice out of it, but I see there was  a little over,\" he said.  \"I'm bound to say that I make nothing of the  note except that there was something on hand, and that a woman, as  usual was at the bottom of it.\"    Mr. Scott Eccles had fidgeted in his seat during this conversation.    \"I am glad you found the note, since it corroborates my story,\" said  he.  \"But I beg to point out that I have not yet heard what has  happened to Mr. Garcia, nor what has become of his household.\"    \"As to Garcia,\" said Gregson, \"that is easily answered.  He was found  dead this morning upon Oxshott Common, nearly a mile from his home.  His head had been smashed to pulp by heavy blows of a sandbag or some  such instrument, which had crushed rather than wounded.  It is a lonely  corner, and there is no house within a quarter of a mile of the spot.  He had apparently been struck down first from behind, but his assailant  had gone on beating him long after he was dead.  It was a most furious  assault.  There are no footsteps nor any clue to the criminals.\"    \"Robbed?\"    \"No, there was no attempt at robbery.\"    \"This is very painful--very painful and terrible,\" said Mr. Scott  Eccles in a querulous voice, \"but it is really uncommonly hard on me.  I had nothing to do with my host going off upon a nocturnal excursion  and meeting so sad an end.  How do I come to be mixed up with the case?\"    \"Very simply, sir,\" Inspector Baynes answered.  \"The only document  found in the pocket of the deceased was a letter from you saying that  you would be with him on the night of his death. It was the envelope of  this letter which gave us the dead man's name and address.  It was  after nine this morning when we reached his house and found neither you  nor anyone else inside it.  I wired to Mr. Gregson to run you down in  London while I examined Wisteria Lodge.  Then I came into town, joined  Mr. Gregson, and here we are.\"    \"I think now,\" said Gregson, rising, \"we had best put this matter into  an official shape.  You will come round with us to the station, Mr.  Scott Eccles, and let us have your statement in writing.\"    \"Certainly, I will come at once.  But I retain your services, Mr.  Holmes.  I desire you to spare no expense and no pains to get at the  truth.\"    My friend turned to the country inspector.    \"I suppose that you have no objection to my collaborating with you, Mr.  Baynes?\"    \"Highly honoured, sir, I am sure.\"    \"You appear to have been very prompt and businesslike in all that you  have done.  Was there any clue, may I ask, as to the exact hour that  the man met his death?\"    \"He had been there since one o'clock.  There was rain about that time,  and his death had certainly been before the rain.\"    \"But that is perfectly impossible, Mr. Baynes,\" cried our client. \"His  voice is unmistakable.  I could swear to it that it was he who  addressed me in my bedroom at that very hour.\"    \"Remarkable, but by no means impossible,\" said Holmes, smiling.    \"You have a clue?\" asked Gregson.    \"On the face of it the case is not a very complex one, though it  certainly presents some novel and interesting features.  A further  knowledge of facts is necessary before I would venture to give a final  and definite opinion.  By the way, Mr. Baynes, did you find anything  remarkable besides this note in your examination of the house?\"    The detective looked at my friend in a singular way.    \"There were,\" said he, \"one or two _very_ remarkable things. Perhaps  when I have finished at the police-station you would care to come out  and give me your opinion of them.\"    \"I am entirely at your service,\" said Sherlock Holmes, ringing the  bell.  \"You will show these gentlemen out, Mrs. Hudson, and kindly send  the boy with this telegram.  He is to pay a five-shilling reply.\"    We sat for some time in silence after our visitors had left. Holmes  smoked hard, with his browns drawn down over his keen eyes, and his  head thrust forward in the eager way characteristic of the man.    \"Well, Watson,\" he asked, turning suddenly upon me, \"what do you make  of it?\"    \"I can make nothing of this mystification of Scott Eccles.\"    \"But the crime?\"    \"Well, taken with the disappearance of the man's companions, I should  say that they were in some"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23433"],[0,"The Kitten's Garden of Verses (#2)"],[1,"of walk,      His tail is difficult to wag          And that's what makes him walk zigzag.        He is the Kitten of a Dog,          From morn till night he's all agog--      Forever seeking something new          That's good but isn't meant to chew.        He romps about the Tulip bed,          And chews the Flowers white and red,      And when the Gardener comes to see          He's sure to blame mamma or me.        One game that cannot ever fail          To please him is to chase his tail--      (To catch one's tail, 'twixt me and you,          Is not an easy thing to do.)        If he has not a pretty face          The Puppy's heart is in its place.      I'm sorry he must grow into          A Horrid, Noisy Dog, aren't you?          [Illustration]          [Illustration]    The Moon          The Moon is like a big round cheese          That shines above the garden trees,      And like a cheese grows less each night,          As though some one had had a bite.        The Mouse delights to nibble cheese,          The Dog bites anything he sees--      But how could they bite off the Moon          Unless they went in a balloon?        And Human People, when they eat          They think it rude to bite their meat,      They use a Knife or Fork or Spoon;          Who is it then that bites the moon?          [Illustration]    The Golden Cat          Great is the Golden Cat who treads           The Blue Roof Garden o'er our heads,      The never tired smiling One           That Human People call the Sun.        He stretches forth his paw at dawn           And though the blinds are closely drawn      His claws peep through like Rays of Light,           To catch the fluttering Bird of Night.        He smiles into the Hayloft dim           And the brown Hay smiles back at him,      And when he strokes the Earth's green fur           He makes the Fields and Meadows purr.        His face is one big Golden smile,           It measures round, at least a mile--      How dull our World would be, and flat,           Without the Golden Pussy Cat.          [Illustration]    An Inquiry          A Birdie cocked his little head,          Winked his eye at me and said,      \"Say, are you a Pussy Willer,          Or just a Kitty-Catty pillar?\"          [Illustration]    A Kitten's Fancy          The Kitten mews outside the Door,           The Cat-bird in the Tree,      The Sea-mew mews upon the Shore,           The Catfish in the Sea.        The Emu with his feathers queer           Is mewing in the Zoo.      Why is it that I never hear           A Pussy-willow mew?          [Illustration]    In Darkest Africa          At evening when the lamp is lit,          The tired Human People sit      And doze, or turn with solemn looks          The speckled pages of their books.        Then I, the Dangerous Kitten, prowl          And in the Shadows softly growl,      And roam about the farthest floor          Where Kitten never trod before.        And, crouching in the jungle damp,          I watch the Human Hunter's camp,      Ready to spring with fearful roar          As soon as I shall hear them snore.        And then with stealthy tread I crawl           Into the dark and trackless hall,      Where 'neath the Hat-tree's shadows deep           Umbrellas fold their wings and sleep.        A cuckoo calls--and to their dens           The People climb like frightened hens,      And I'm alone--and no one cares           In Darkest Africa--down stairs.          [Illustration]          [Illustration]    The Dog          The Dog is black or white or brown          And sometimes spotted like a clown.      He loves to make a foolish noise          And Human Company enjoys.        The Human People pat his head          And teach him to pretend he's dead,      And beg, and fetch and carry too;          Things that no well-bred Cat will do.        At Human jokes, however stale,          He jumps about and wags his tail,      And Human People clap their hands          And think he really understands.        They say \"Good Dog\" to him. To us          They say \"Poor Puss,\" and make no fuss.      Why Dogs are \"good\" and Cats are \"poor\"          I fail to understand, I'm sure.        To Someone very Good and Just,          Who has proved worthy of her trust,      A Cat will _sometimes_ condescend--          The Dog is Everybody's friend.

First it goes this way, then it goes that,          Just like a bird on the wing.      And all of a tremble I crouch on the mat          Like a Lion, preparing to spring.        And now with a terrible deafening mew,          Like a Tiger I leap on my prey,      And just when I think I have torn it in two          It is up in the air and away."]]]
