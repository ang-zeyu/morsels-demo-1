Also this  appeal finds ready echo in Germany, and the Imperial Government is  quite willing to permit its statements and decisions in the present  case to be governed by the principles of humanity just as it has done  always.    The Imperial Government welcomed with gratitude when the American  Government, in the note of May 15, itself recalled that Germany had  always permitted itself to be governed by the principles of progress  and humanity in dealing with the law of maritime war.    Since the time when Frederick the Great negotiated with John Adams,  Benjamin Franklin, and Thomas Jefferson the Treaty of Friendship and  Commerce of September 9, 1785, between Prussia and the Republic of the  West, German and American statesmen have, in fact, always stood  together in the struggle for the freedom of the seas and for the  protection of peaceable trade.    In the international proceedings which since have been conducted for  the regulation of the laws of maritime war, Germany and America have  jointly advocated progressive principles, especially the abolishment  of the right of capture at sea and the protection of the interests of  neutrals.    Even at the beginning of the present war the German Government  immediately declared its willingness, in response to proposals of the  American Government, to ratify the Declaration of London and thereby  subject itself in the use of its naval forces to all the restrictions  provided therein in favor of neutrals.    Germany likewise has been always tenacious of the principle that war  should be conducted against the armed and organized forces of an enemy  country, but that the enemy civilian population must be spared as far  as possible from the measures of war. The Imperial Government  cherishes the definite hope that some way will be found when peace is  concluded, or perhaps earlier, to regulate the law of maritime war in  a manner guaranteeing the freedom of the seas, and will welcome it  with gratitude and satisfaction if it can work hand in hand with the  American Government on that occasion.    If in the present war the principles which should be the ideal of the  future have been traversed more and more, the longer its duration, the  German Government has no guilt therein. It is known to the American  Government how Germany's adversaries, by completely paralyzing  peaceful traffic between Germany and neutral countries, have aimed  from the very beginning and with increasing lack of consideration at  the destruction not so much of the armed forces as the life of the  German nation, repudiating in doing so all the rules of international  law and disregarding all rights of neutrals.    On November 3, 1914, England declared the North Sea a war area, and by  planting poorly anchored mines and by the stoppage and capture of  vessels, made passage extremely dangerous and difficult for neutral  shipping, thereby actually blockading neutral coasts and ports  contrary to all international law. Long before the beginning of  submarine war England practically completely intercepted legitimate  neutral navigation to Germany also. Thus Germany was driven to a  submarine war on trade.    On November 14, 1914, the English Premier declared in the House of  Commons that it was one of England's principal tasks to prevent food  for the German population from reaching Germany via neutral ports.  Since March 1 England has been taking from neutral ships without  further formality all merchandise proceeding to Germany, as well as  all merchandise coming from Germany, even when neutral property. Just  as it was also with the Boers, the German people is now to be given  the choice of perishing from starvation with its women and children or  of relinquishing its independence.    While our enemies thus loudly and openly proclaimed war without mercy  until our utter destruction, we were conducting a war in self-defense  for our national existence and for the sake of peace of an assured  permanency. We have been obliged to adopt a submarine warfare to meet  the declared intentions of our enemies and the method of warfare  adopted by them in contravention of international law.    With all its efforts in principle to protect neutral life and property  from damage as much as possible, the German Government recognized  unreservedly in its memorandum of February 4 that the interests of  neutrals might suffer from the submarine warfare. However, the  American Government will also understand and appreciate that in the  fight for existence, which has been forced upon Germany by its  adversaries and announced by them, it is the sacred duty of the  Imperial Government to do all within its power to protect and save the  lives of German subjects. If the Imperial Government were derelict in  these, its duties, it would be guilty before God and history of the  violation of those principles of highest humanity which are the  foundation of every national existence.    The case of the Lusitania shows with horrible clearness to what  jeopardizing of human lives the manner of conducting war employed by  our adversaries leads. In the most direct contradiction of  international law all distinctions between merchantmen and war vessels  have been obliterated by the order to British merchantmen to arm  themselves and to ram submarines, and the promise of rewards therefor,  and neutrals who use merchantmen as travelers thereby have been  exposed in an increasing degree to all the dangers of war.    If the commander of the German submarine which destroyed the Lusitania  had caused the crew and passengers to take to the boats before firing  a torpedo this would have meant the sure destruction of his own  vessel. After the experiences in sinking much smaller and less  seaworthy vessels it was to be expected that a mighty ship like the  Lusitania would remain above water long enough, even after the  torpedoing, to permit passengers to enter the ship's boats.  Circumstances of a very peculiar kind, especially the presence on  board of large quantities of highly explosive materials, defeated this  expectation.    In addition it may be pointed out that if the Lusitania had been  spared, thousands of cases of munitions would have been sent to  Germany's enemies and thereby thousands of German mothers and children  robbed of breadwinners.    In the spirit of friendship wherewith the German nation has been  imbued toward the Union (United States) and its inhabitants since the  earliest days of its existence, the Imperial Government will always be  ready to do all it can during the present war also to prevent the  jeopardizing of lives of American citizens.    The Imperial Government, therefore, repeats the assurances that  American ships will not be hindered in the prosecution of legitimate  shipping and the lives of American citizens in neutral vessels shall  not be placed in jeopardy.    In order to exclude any unforeseen dangers to American passenger  steamers, made possible in view of the conduct of maritime war by  Germany's adversaries, German submarines will be instructed to permit  the free and safe passage of such passenger steamers when made  recognizable by special markings and notified a reasonable time in  advance. The Imperial Government, however, confidently hopes that the  American Government will assume to guarantee that these vessels have  no contraband on board, details of arrangements for the unhampered  passage of these vessels to be agreed upon by the naval authorities of  both sides.    In order to furnish adequate facilities for travel across the  Atlantic for American citizens, the German Government submits for  consideration a proposal to increase the number of available steamers  by installing in passenger service a reasonable number of neutral  steamers under the American flag, the exact number to be agreed upon  under the same condition as the above-mentioned American steamers.    The Imperial Government believes it can assume that in this manner  adequate facilities for travel across the Atlantic Ocean can be  afforded American citizens. There would, therefore, appear to be no  compelling necessity for American citizens to travel to Europe in time  of war on ships carrying an enemy flag. In particular the Imperial  Government is unable to admit that American citizens can protect an  enemy ship through the mere fact of their presence on board.    Germany merely followed England's example when she declared part of  the high seas an area of war. Consequently, accidents suffered by  neutrals on enemy ships in this area of war cannot well be judged  differently from accidents to which neutrals are at all times exposed  at the seat of war on land, when they betake themselves into dangerous  localities in spite of previous warnings. If, however, it should not  be possible for the American Government to acquire an adequate number  of neutral passenger steamers, the Imperial Government is prepared to  interpose no objections to the placing under the American flag by the  American Government of four enemy passenger steamers for passenger  traffic between North America and England. Assurances of \"free and  safe\" passage for American passenger steamers would then extend to  apply under the identical pro-conditions to these formerly hostile  passenger steamers.    The President of the United States has declared his readiness, in a  way deserving of thanks, to communicate and suggest proposals to the  Government of Great Britain with particular reference to the  alteration of maritime war. The Imperial Government will always be  glad to make use of the good offices of the President, and hopes that  his efforts in the present case as well as in the direction of the  lofty ideal of the freedom of the seas, will lead to an understanding.

Undoubtedly the Antarctic continent was once joined to South America,  Australia and Africa. During the last Antarctic expeditions it has been  shown that the same geological formation exists in South America as in  the Antarctic plateau. On perusing this book, the reader will be struck  by the wonderful resemblance between the Indians of South America, the  Malay races of Asia, and the tribes of Polynesia. I maintain that they  not only resemble each other, but are actually the same people in  different stages of development, and naturally influenced to a certain  extent by climatic and other local conditions. Those people did not come  there, as has been supposed, by marching up the entire Asiatic coast,  crossing over the Behring Straits and then down the American coast, nor  by means of any other migration. No, indeed; it is not they who have  moved, but it is the country under them which has shifted and separated  them, leaving members of the same race thousands of miles apart.    I was able to notice among the Indians of Central Brazil many words of  Malay origin, others closely resembling words of languages current among  tribes of the Philippine Islands. The anthropometric measurements which I  took of South American Indians corresponded almost exactly with those of  natives of the Sulu Archipelago and the island of Mindanao.    I hope some day to use the wealth of material I have collected among  innumerable tribes on the Asiatic coast, on the islands of the Pacific  Ocean, in South America and in Africa, in making a comparative study of  those peoples. It should prove interesting enough. I have no space here  to go deeply into the subject, as this is merely a book descriptive of  South America. I may add that the most ardent supporter of the above  theory is the celebrated explorer and scientist, Colonel Marchand, of  Fashoda fame--a man who has studied and understands the mysteries of this  world better than any man living.    My sincere thanks are due to the following gentlemen for much politeness  shown me in connection with the expedition: To Mr. Gustave Babin, the  famous writer of Paris; to Mr. Manoel Bomfin (ex-deputy of Brazil), to  Senador Alcindo Guanabara, for the keen interest taken in the expedition  and for proposing to Congress after my return that a grant of L4,000  should be given to me as a reward for the work done. I herewith also  express my gratitude to the Brazilian Government for paying me that sum,  which came in usefully to defray part of the expenses of the expedition.  To H.E. Dr. Pedro de Toledo, Minister of Agriculture, for the intelligent  desire shown to help as much as he could in the venture, and for kindly  giving me the free use of all the telegraphs in Brazil, including the  Amazon Cable, and other important privileges; to Dr. Jose Carlos  Rodriguez for hospitality and much valuable advice; to Dr. Paolo de  Frontin, Conseilheiro Antonio Prado, Dr. Jose Pereira Reboncas and Mr.  Mockill and their respective Companies for the many privileges granted me  upon the various railways of which they were the Presidents; to Colonel  R. E. Brazil and Commandante Macedo for their kind hospitality to me  while navigating the lower Tapajoz river; to Dr. A. B. Leguia, President  of the Peruvian Republic; to the British Ministers at Petropolis, Lima,  La Paz, and Buenos Ayres, and the British Consuls of Rio de Janeiro,  Para, Manaos, Iquitos, Antofogasta, Valparaiso; finally to the British  and American Residents at all those places for much exquisite hospitality  offered me.    Special thanks are due to Mr. Regis de Oliveira, ex-Brazilian Minister in  London, for valuable credentials given me before my departure which paved  the way to the hearty reception I received everywhere in Brazil.
