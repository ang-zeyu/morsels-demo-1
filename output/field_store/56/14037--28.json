Although her hair was the most obviously striking feature of her  appearance, her mouth was really the most individual thing about  her. It was a mouth that suggested adventurous possibilities. In  repose, it had a look of having just finished saying something  humorous, a kind of demure appreciation of itself. When it  smiled, a row of white teeth flashed out: or, if the lips did not  part, a dimple appeared on the right cheek, giving the whole face  an air of mischievous geniality. It was an enterprising,  swashbuckling sort of mouth, the mouth of one who would lead  forlorn hopes with a jest or plot whimsically lawless  conspiracies against convention. In its corners and in the firm  line of the chin beneath it there lurked, too, more than a hint  of imperiousness. A physiognomist would have gathered, correctly,  that Ann Chester liked having her own way and was accustomed to  get it.    \"Hello, uncle Peter,\" she said. \"What's the trouble?\"    \"Am I interrupting you, Ann?\"    \"Not a bit. I'm only copying out a story for aunt Nesta. I  promised her I would. Would you like to hear some of it?\"    Mr. Pett said he would not.    \"You're missing a good thing,\" said Ann, turning the pages. \"I'm  all worked up over it. It's called 'At Dead of Night,' and it's  full of crime and everything. You would never think aunt Nesta  had such a feverish imagination. There are detectives and  kidnappers in it and all sorts of luxuries. I suppose it's the  effect of reading it, but you look to me as if you were trailing  something. You've got a sort of purposeful air.\"    Mr. Pett's amiable face writhed into what was intended to be a  bitter smile.    \"I'm only trailing a quiet place to read in. I never saw such a  place as this house. It looks big enough outside for a regiment.  Yet, when you're inside, there's a poet or something in every  room.\"    \"What about the library? Isn't that sacred to you?\"    \"The boy Ogden's there.\"    \"What a shame!\"    \"Wallowing in my best chair,\" said Mr. Pett morosely. \"Smoking  cigarettes.\"    \"Smoking? I thought he had promised aunt Nesta he wouldn't smoke.\"    \"Well, he said he wasn't, of course, but I know he had been. I  don't know what to do with that boy. It's no good my talking to  him. He--he patronises me!\" concluded Mr. Pett indignantly.  \"Sits there on his shoulder blades with his feet on the table  and talks to me with his mouth full of candy as if I were his  grandson.\"    \"Little brute.\"    Ann was sorry for Mr. Pett. For many years now, ever since the  death of her mother, they had been inseparable. Her father, who  was a traveller, explorer, big-game hunter, and general sojourner  in the lonelier and wilder spots of the world and paid only  infrequent visits to New York, had left her almost entirely in  Mr. Pett's care, and all her pleasantest memories were associated  with him. Mr. Chester's was in many ways an admirable character,  but not a domestic one; and his relations with his daughter were  confined for the most part to letters and presents. In the past  few years she had come almost to regard Mr. Pett in the light of  a father. Hers was a nature swiftly responsive to kindness; and  because Mr. Pett besides being kind was also pathetic she pitied  as well as loved him. There was a lingering boyishness in the  financier, the boyishness of the boy who muddles along in an  unsympathetic world and can never do anything right: and this  quality called aloud to the youth in her. She was at the valiant  age when we burn to right wrongs and succour the oppressed, and  wild rebel schemes for the reformation of her small world came  readily to her. From the first she had been a smouldering  spectator of the trials of her uncle's married life, and if Mr.  Pett had ever asked her advice and bound himself to act on it he  would have solved his domestic troubles in explosive fashion. For  Ann in her moments of maiden meditation had frequently devised  schemes to that end which would have made his grey hair stand  erect with horror.    \"I've seen a good many boys,\" she said, \"but Ogden is in a class  by himself. He ought to be sent to a strict boarding-school, of  course.\"    \"He ought to be sent to Sing-Sing,\" amended Mr. Pett.    \"Why don't you send him to school?\"    \"Your aunt wouldn't hear of it. She's afraid of his being  kidnapped. It happened last time he went to school. You can't  blame her for wanting to keep her eye on him after that.\"    Ann ran her fingers meditatively over the keys.    \"I've sometimes thought . . .\"    \"Yes?\"    \"Oh, nothing. I must get on with this thing for aunt Nesta.\"    Mr. Pett placed the bulk of the Sunday paper on the floor beside  him, and began to run an appreciative eye over the comic  supplement. That lingering boyishness in him which endeared him  to Ann always led him to open his Sabbath reading in this  fashion. Grey-headed though he was, he still retained both in art  and in real life a taste for the slapstick. No one had ever known  the pure pleasure it had given him when Raymond Green, his wife's  novelist protege, had tripped over a loose stair-rod one morning  and fallen an entire flight.    From some point farther down the corridor came a muffled  thudding. Ann stopped her work to listen.    \"There's Jerry Mitchell punching the bag.\"    \"Eh?\" said Mr. Pett.    \"I only said I could hear Jerry Mitchell in the gymnasium.\"    \"Yes, he's there.\"    Ann looked out of the window thoughtfully for a moment. Then she  swung round in her swivel-chair.    \"Uncle Peter.\"    Mr. Pett emerged slowly from the comic supplement.    \"Eh?\"    \"Did Jerry Mitchell ever tell you about that friend of his who  keeps a dogs' hospital down on Long Island somewhere? I forget  his name. Smithers or Smethurst or something. People--old ladies,  you know, and people--bring him their dogs to be cured when they  get sick. He has an infallible remedy, Jerry tells me. He makes a  lot of money at it.\"    \"Money?\" Pett, the student, became Pett, the financier, at the  magic word. \"There might be something in that if one got behind  it. Dogs are fashionable. There would be a market for a really  good medicine.\"    \"I'm afraid you couldn't put Mr. Smethurst's remedy on the  market. It only works when the dog has been overeating himself  and not taking any exercise.\"    \"Well, that's all these fancy dogs ever have the matter with  them. It looks to me as if I might do business with this man.  I'll get his address from Mitchell.\"    \"It's no use thinking of it, uncle Peter. You couldn't do  business with him--in that way. All Mr. Smethurst does when any  one brings him a fat, unhealthy dog is to feed it next to  nothing--just the simplest kind of food, you know--and make it  run about a lot. And in about a week the dog's as well and happy  and nice as he can possibly be.\"    \"Oh,\" said Mr. Pett, disappointed.    Ann touched the keys of her machine softly.    \"Why I mentioned Mr. Smethurst,\" she said, \"it was because we had  been talking of Ogden. Don't you think his treatment would be  just what Ogden needs?\"    Mr. Pett's eyes gleamed.    \"It's a shame he can't have a week or two of it!\"    Ann played a little tune with her finger-tips on the desk.    \"It would do him good, wouldn't it?\"    Silence fell upon the room, broken only by the tapping of the  typewriter. Mr. Pett, having finished the comic supplement,  turned to the sporting section, for he was a baseball fan of no  lukewarm order. The claims of business did not permit him to see  as many games as he could wish, but he followed the national  pastime closely on the printed page and had an admiration for the  Napoleonic gifts of Mr. McGraw which would have gratified that  gentleman had he known of it.    \"Uncle Peter,\" said Ann, turning round again.    \"Eh?\"    \"It's funny you should have been talking about Ogden getting  kidnapped. This story of aunt Nesta's is all about an  angel-child--I suppose it's meant to be Ogden--being stolen and  hidden and all that. It's odd that she should write stories like  this. You wouldn't expect it of her.\"    \"Your aunt,\" said Mr. Pett, \"lets her mind run on that sort of  thing a good deal. She tells me there was a time, not so long  ago, when half the kidnappers in America were after him. She sent  him to school in England--or, rather, her husband did. They were  separated then--and, as far as I can follow the story, they all  took the next boat and besieged the place.\"    \"It's a pity somebody doesn't smuggle him away now and keep him  till he's a better boy.\"    \"Ah!\" said Mr. Pett wistfully.    Ann looked at him fixedly, but his eyes were once more on his  paper. She gave a little sigh, and turned to her work again.    \"It's quite demoralising, typing aunt Nesta's stories,\" she said.  \"They put ideas into one's head.\"    Mr. Pett said nothing. He was reading an article of medical  interest in the magazine section, for he was a man who ploughed  steadily through his Sunday paper, omitting nothing. The  typewriter began tapping again.    \"Great Godfrey!\"    Ann swung round, and gazed at her uncle in concern. He was  staring blankly at the paper.    \"What's the matter?\"    The page on which Mr. Pett's attention was concentrated was  decorated with a fanciful picture in bold lines of a young man in  evening dress pursuing a young woman similarly clad along what  appeared to be a restaurant supper-table. An enjoyable time was  apparently being had by both. Across the page this legend ran:                PICCADILLY JIM ONCE MORE                The Recent Adventures of Young Mr. Crocker                of New York and London    It was not upon the title, however, nor upon the illustration  that Mr. Pett's fascinated eye rested. What he was looking at was  a small reproduction of a photograph which had been inserted in  the body of the article.

Inhale short breaths through the nose. This, of course, is only an  exercise for breath development.    Now begin to inhale from the bottom of the lungs first.    Exhale slowly and feel as if you were pushing the air against your  chest. If you can get this sensation later when singing it will help you  very greatly to get control of the breath and to avoid sending too much  breath through the vocal chords.    The breath must be sent out in an even, steady flow.    You will notice when you begin to sing, if you watch yourself very  carefully, that, first, you will try to inhale too much air; secondly,  you will either force it all out at once, making a breathy note, or in  trying to control the flow of air by the diaphragm you will suddenly  cease to send it forth at all and will be making the sound by pressure  from the throat.    There must never be any pressure from the throat. The sound must be made  from the continued flow of air.    You must learn to control this flow of air, so that no muscular action  of the throat can shut it off.    Open the throat wide and start your note by the pressure breath. The  physical sensation should be first an effort on the part of the  diaphragm to press the air up against the chest box, then the sensation  of a perfectly open throat, and, lastly, the sensation that the air is  passing freely into the cavities of the head.    The quantity of sound is controlled by the breath.    In diminishing the tone the opening of the throat remains the same.  Only the quantity of breath given forth is diminished. That is done by  the diaphragm muscles.    \"Filare la voce,\" to spin the voice from a tiny little thread into a  breadth of sound and then diminish again, is one of the most beautiful  effects in singing.    It is accomplished by the control of the breath, and its perfect  accomplishment means the complete mastery of the greatest difficulty in  learning to sing.    I think one of the best exercises for learning to control the voice by  first getting control of the breath is to stand erect in a  well-ventilated room or out of doors and slowly snuff in air through the  nostrils, inhaling in little puffs, as if you were smelling something.    Take just a little bit of air at a time and feel as if you were filling  the very bottom of your lungs and also the back of your lungs.    When you have the sensation of being full up to the neck retain the air  for a few seconds and then very slowly send it out in little puffs  again.    This is a splendid exercise, but I want to warn you not to practice any  breathing exercise to such an extent that you make your heart beat fast  or feel like strangling.    Overexercising the lungs is as bad as not exercising them enough and  the results are often harmful.    Like everything else in singing, you want to learn this gradually. Never  neglect it, because it is the very foundation of your art. But don't try  to develop a diaphragm expansion of five inches in two weeks.    Indeed, it is not the expansion that you are working for.    I have noticed this one peculiarity about young singers--if they have an  enormous development of the diaphragm they think they should be able to  sing, no matter what happens. A girl came to see me once whose figure  was really entirely out of proportion, the lower part of the lungs  having been pressed out quite beyond even artistic lines.    \"You see, madam,\" she exclaimed, \"I have studied breathing. Why, I have  such a strong diaphragm I can move the piano with it!\" And she did go  right up to my piano and, pushing on this strong diaphragm of hers,  moved the piano a fraction of an inch from its place.    I was quite aghast. I had never met such an athletic singer. When I  asked her to let me hear her voice, however, a tiny stream of contralto  sound issued from those powerful lungs.    She had developed her breathing capacity, but when she sang she held  her breath back.    I have noticed that a great many people do this, and it is one of the  things that must be overcome in the very beginning of the study of  singing.    Certain young singers take in an enormous breath, stiffening every  muscle in order to hold the air, thus depriving their muscles of all  elasticity.    They will then shut off the throat and let only the smallest fraction of  air escape, just enough to make a sound. Too much inbreathing and too  violent an effort at inhaling will not help the singer at all.    People have said that they cannot see when I breathe. Well, they  certainly cannot say that I am ever short of breath even if I do try to  breathe invisibly. When I breathe I scarcely draw my diaphragm in at  all, but I feel the air fill my lungs and I feel my upper ribs expand.    In singing I always feel as if I were forcing my breath against my  chest, and, just as in the exercises according to Delsarte you will find  the chest leads in all physical movements, so in singing you should feel  this firm support of the chest of the highest as well as the lowest  notes.    I have seen pupils, trying to master the art of breathing, holding  themselves as rigidly as drum majors.    Now this rigidity of the spinal column will in no way help you in the  emission of tone, nor will it increase the breath control. In fact, I  don't think it would even help you to stand up straight, although it  would certainly give one a stiff appearance and one far removed from  grace.    A singer should stand freely and easily and should feel as if the chest  were leading, but should not feel constrained or stiff in any part of  the ribs or lungs.    From the minute the singer starts to emit a tone the supply of breath  must be emitted steadily from the chamber of air in the lungs. It must  never be held back once.    The immediate pressure of the air should be felt more against the chest.  I know of a great many singers who, when they come to very difficult  passages, put their hands on their chests, focusing their attention on  this one part of the mechanism of singing.    The audience, of course, thinks the prima donna's hand is raised to her  heart, when, as a matter of fact, the prima donna, with a difficult bit  of singing before her, is thinking of her technique and the foundation  of that technique--breath control.    This feeling of singing against the chest with the weight of air  pressing up against it is known as \"breath support,\" and in Italian we  have even a better word, \"apoggio,\" which is breath prop. The diaphragm  in English may be called the bellows of the lungs, but the apoggio is  the deep breath regulated by the diaphragm.    The attack of the sound must come from the apoggio, or breath prop. In  attacking the very highest notes it is essential, and no singer can  really get the high notes or vocal flexibility or strength of tone  without the attack coming from this seat of respiration.    In practicing the trill or staccato tones the pressure of the breath  must be felt even before the sound is heard. The beautiful, clear,  bell-like tones that die away into a soft piano are tones struck on the  apoggio and controlled by the steady soft pressure of the breath emitted  through a perfectly open throat, over a low tongue and resounding in the  cavities of the mouth or head.    Never for a moment sing without this apoggio, this breath prop. Its  development and its constant use mean the restoration of sick or  fatigued voices and the prolonging of all one's vocal powers into what  is wrongly called old age.          The Mastery of the Tongue      The tongue is a veritable stumbling block in the path of the singer. The  tongue is an enormous muscle compared with the other parts of the throat  and mouth, and its roots particularly can by a slight movement block the  passage of the throat pressing against the larynx. This accounts for  much of the pinched singing we hear.    When the tongue forms a mountain in the back part of the mouth the  singer produces what you call in English slang \"a hot potato tone\"--that  is to say, a tone that sounds as if it were having much difficulty to  get through the mouth. In very fact, it is having this difficulty, for  it has to pass over the back of the tongue.    The would-be singer has to learn to control the tongue muscles and,  above all things, to learn to relax the tongue and to govern it at will,  so that it never stiffens and forms that hard lump which can be plainly  felt immediately beneath the chin under the jaw.    It requires a great deal of practice to gain control of the tongue, and  there are many different exercises which purport to be beneficial in  gaining complete mastery over it. One, for instance, is to throw the  tongue out as far forward as possible without stiffening it and then  draw it back slowly. This can be done in front of a mirror by trying to  throw the tongue not only from the tip, but from the root, keeping the  sides of the tongue broad. Another way is to catch hold of the two sides  of the tongue with the fingers and pull it out gently.    For my part, I scarcely approve of these mechanical ways of gaining  control of the tongue except in cases where the singer is phlegmatic of  temperament and cannot be made to feel the various sensations of stiff  tongue or tongue drawn far back in other ways. Ordinarily I think they  make the singer conscious, nervous and more likely to stiffen the tongue  in a wild desire to relax it and keep it flat.    These exercises, however, combined with exercises in diction, help to  make the tongue elastic, and the more elastic and quick this muscle  becomes the clearer will be the singer's diction and the more flexible  will be her voice.    The correct position of the tongue is raised from the back, "]]]
