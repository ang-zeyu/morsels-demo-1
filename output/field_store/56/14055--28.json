PISANI.    (Translation.)    Excellency,                       _Pera, August_ 24, 1843.    In conformity with your orders I saw the Grand Vizier and  communicated to him, word for word, the message contained in your  confidential instruction of yesterday respecting the young Armenian  who has just been executed. His Highness made answer to the  following effect:--    \"As regards myself personally, I have a horror of even putting a  fowl to death. Executions, so frequent under the old system, are now  of rare occurrence. But in the late instance, as I have already said  to you, and again repeat, positively neither the Ministers nor the  Sultan could have saved the life of the Armenian. The laws of the  Koran compel no man to become a Mussulman, but they are inexorable  both as respects a Mussulman who embraces another religion, and as  respects a person not a Mussulman, who, after having of his own  accord publicly embraced Islamism, is convicted of having renounced  that faith. No consideration can produce a commutation of the  capital punishment to which the law condemns him without mercy. The  only mode of escaping death is for the accused to declare that he  has again become a Mussulman. It was only with a view to saving the  life of the individual in question, that we--contrary to the letter  of the law, which requires that the sentence in cases of this  nature, should be executed as soon as pronounced--allowed him some  days respite to think over the matter carefully, with the assurance  that having once made the declaration required by law, he would be  set at liberty and would be able to leave Constantinople; but  inasmuch as he resisted all the attempts which were made to induce  him to have recourse to the only means of escaping death, it finally  became necessary to obey the law, otherwise the Ulemas would have  risen against us. The execution, according to the terms of the law,  was necessarily public.\"    Seeing that the Grand Vizier had said nothing with reference to your  Excellency's observations as to what would occur if a foreigner, an  Englishman for instance, were to be placed in similar circumstances,  I begged His Highness to consider, and to direct the consideration  of the Ottoman Ministry to the nature of the position in which the  Porte would place itself as regards the British Government, were it  to have recourse to violence. The Grand Vizier then said, \"I really  do not know what would become necessary in such a case if a  foreigner were concerned; I am ignorant as to what is said in the  law as regards a Frank who should be compromised by the  circumstances which caused the Armenian, who was a Rayah, to be  condemned to death.\"    The Grand Vizier concluded by saying, \"Present my compliments to the  Ambassador, and tell him that I appreciate his humane and  well-intentioned sentiments, but that what has occurred was a  misfortune for which there was no remedy whatever.\"    I have, &c.

Guizot informed me this morning that he had received a  communication from M. de Bourqueney, relative to a most  unjustifiable act of the Turkish Government, in having, under  circumstances of great cruelty, put to death an Armenian Turk who  had embraced Christianity, and had refused to renounce that religion  and resume the Ottoman faith.    M. Bourqueney having asked for instructions for his guidance in this  matter, the Minister for Foreign Affairs sent him a protest which he  is to present to the Ottoman Government on the behalf of the  Government of France.    M. Guizot observed, that as the Great Powers of Europe were using  their best endeavours to induce the Sultan's Christian subjects to  live peaceably under the Ottoman rule, they could not allow of such  arbitrary acts of cruelty as that which had been perpetrated, and  which was sufficient to rouse the whole of the Christian population  against the Government. He understood, he said, that Sir Stratford  Canning had asked for instructions from your Lordship in this  matter, and that he trusted that they would be in a similar tenor to  those he was about to send to M. de Bourqueney.

Le Soussigné, Envoyé Extraordinaire et Ministre Plénipotentiaire de  Sa Majesté le Roi de Prusse, a l'honneur de transmettre à son  Excellence le Comte de Aberdeen, Principal Secrétaire d'Etat de Sa  Majesté Britannique pour les Affaires Etrangères, copie d'une  dépêche qu'il vient de recevoir, avec l'ordre d'en donner  connaissance à sa Seigneurie.    En s'acquittant de cette commission, il profite, &c.    (Signé) BUNSEN.    _Londres, le_ 28 _Septembre_, 1843.    (Translation.)    The Undersigned, Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary  from His Majesty the King of Prussia, has the honour to transmit to  his Excellency the Earl of Aberdeen, Her Britannic Majesty's  Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, a copy of a  despatch which he has just received, with instructions to  communicate it to his Lordship.    In executing this instruction, he avails himself, &c.    (Signed) BUNSEN.    _London, September_ 28, 1843.    Inclosure 1 in No. 3.    _Baron Bülow to Chevalier Bunsen_.    Monsieur,                         _Berlin, ce_ 21 _Septembre_, 1843.    Vos rapports au Roi jusqu'au No. 91 du 15 du courant nous sont  parvenus et ont été placés sous les yeux de Sa Majesté.    Vous êtes sans doute déjà instruit, par la voie des journaux, des  détails de l'exécution de l'Arménien Serkiz Papazoghlou, mis à mort  dernièrement à Constantinople pour avoir renié la foi de Mahomet  qu'il avait embrassée quelque temps avant. A la vérité, la lettre du  Coran inflige la peine de mort à tous ceux qui abandonnent le  Mahométisme, mais longtemps déjà l'usage avait adouci la rigueur  d'une loi si peu en harmonie avec les préceptes de la civilisation,  et depuis nombre d'années aucune exécution de ce genre n'avait eu  lieu. Celle du malheureux Serkiz doit par conséquent être considérée  comme un triste retour aux barbaries du fanatisme Musulman. Elle le  doit d'autant plus que, d'un côté, l'énergique intercession de Sir  Stratford Canning en faveur de la victime est restée infructueuse;  et que, de l'autre, les autorités Turques, en conduisant Serkiz,  quoique Arménien, en costume Franc et la casquette sur la tête au  supplice, semblent avoir voulu donner à ce sanglant spectacle le  caractère d'un défi public porté par l'ancienne cruauté Mahométane à  l'influence des moeurs Européennes et de la civilisation Chrétienne.    Partant de ce point de vue et regardant la catastrophe qui vient  d'avoir lieu comme un symptôme de plus d'une tendance rétrograde et  pour ainsi dire anti-Européenne dont, dans son propre intérêt, il  importe de détourner le Gouvernement Ottoman, les Répresentans des  Cinq Grandes Puissances à Constantinople ont cru qu'un avertissement  unanime, à la fois bienveillant et sérieux, que ces Puissances  feraient parvenir à cet effet à la Sublime Porte, produirait sur  elle une impression salutaire. Ils ont, en conséquence, et sur  l'invitation spéciale de Sir Stratford Canning, sollicité de leurs  Cours respectives les instructions nécessaires pour se porter à la  démarche en question, et M. l'Ambassadeur d'Angleterre voulait en  outre proposer à Lord Aberdeen de s'employer dans le même sens  auprès des Cabinets de Berlin, de Vienne, de Paris, et de St.  Pétersbourg.    Je n'ai pas encore reçu de communication à ce sujet de la part de  Monsieur le Principal Secrétaire d'Etat, mais je me suis empressé de  répondre par la dépêche dont je joins ici une copie, à celle que  l'Envoyé du Roi à Constantinople a adressé à Sa Majesté sur cette  affaire.    Veuillez, Monsieur, en donner connaissance, ainsi que de la présente  dépêche, à Lord Aberdeen, et exprimer de ma part à sa Seigneurie  l'espoir d'être allé de cette manière au devant des ouvertures  qu'elle serait peut-être dans le cas de me faire faire [sic] sur la  démarche proposée par les cinq Représentans à Constantinople, mais  mise, de préférence, sur le tapis par M. l'Ambassadeur d'Angleterre.    Recevez, &c.,    (Signé) BULOW.    (Translation.)    Sir,                              _Berlin, September_ 21, 1843.    Your reports to the King, to No. 91 of the 15th instant, have been  received and laid before His Majesty.    You are doubtless already acquainted, by means of the newspapers,  with the details of the execution of the Armenian, Serkiz  Papazoghlou, lately put to death at Constantinople for having  renounced the Mahomedan faith, which he had embraced some time  before. In truth, the letter of the Koran inflicts the punishment of  death upon all those who abandon Mahomedanism, but for some time"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2040"],[0,"Confessions of an English Opium-Eater (#2)"],[1,"in that character       Humani nihil a se alienum putat.    For amongst the conditions which he deems indispensable to the sustaining  of any claim to the title of philosopher is not merely the possession of  a superb intellect in its _analytic_ functions (in which part of the  pretensions, however, England can for some generations show but few  claimants; at least, he is not aware of any known candidate for this  honour who can be styled emphatically _a subtle thinker_, with the  exception of _Samuel Taylor Coleridge_, and in a narrower department of  thought with the recent illustrious exception {2} of _David Ricardo_) but  also on such a constitution of the _moral_ faculties as shall give him an  inner eye and power of intuition for the vision and the mysteries of our  human nature: _that_ constitution of faculties, in short, which (amongst  all the generations of men that from the beginning of time have deployed  into life, as it were, upon this planet) our English poets have possessed  in the highest degree, and Scottish professors {3} in the lowest.    I have often been asked how I first came to be a regular opium-eater, and  have suffered, very unjustly, in the opinion of my acquaintance from  being reputed to have brought upon myself all the sufferings which I  shall have to record, by a long course of indulgence in this practice  purely for the sake of creating an artificial state of pleasurable  excitement.  This, however, is a misrepresentation of my case.  True it  is that for nearly ten years I did occasionally take opium for the sake  of the exquisite pleasure it gave me; but so long as I took it with this  view I was effectually protected from all material bad consequences by  the necessity of interposing long intervals between the several acts of  indulgence, in order to renew the pleasurable sensations.  It was not for  the purpose of creating pleasure, but of mitigating pain in the severest  degree, that I first began to use opium as an article of daily diet.  In  the twenty-eighth year of my age a most painful affection of the stomach,  which I had first experienced about ten years before, attacked me in  great strength.  This affection had originally been caused by extremities  of hunger, suffered in my boyish days.  During the season of hope and  redundant happiness which succeeded (that is, from eighteen to twenty-  four) it had slumbered; for the three following years it had revived at  intervals; and now, under unfavourable circumstances, from depression of  spirits, it attacked me with a violence that yielded to no remedies but  opium.  As the youthful sufferings which first produced this derangement  of the stomach were interesting in themselves, and in the circumstances  that attended them, I shall here briefly retrace them.    My father died when I was about seven years old, and left me to the care  of four guardians.  I was sent to various schools, great and small; and  was very early distinguished for my classical attainments, especially for  my knowledge of Greek.  At thirteen I wrote Greek with ease; and at  fifteen my command of that language was so great that I not only composed  Greek verses in lyric metres, but could converse in Greek fluently and  without embarrassment--an accomplishment which I have not since met with  in any scholar of my times, and which in my case was owing to the  practice of daily reading off the newspapers into the best Greek I could  furnish _extempore_; for the necessity of ransacking my memory and  invention for all sorts and combinations of periphrastic expressions as  equivalents for modern ideas, images, relations of things, &c., gave me a  compass of diction which would never have been called out by a dull  translation of moral essays, &c.  \"That boy,\" said one of my masters,  pointing the attention of a stranger to me, \"that boy could harangue an  Athenian mob better than you and I could address an English one.\"  He who  honoured me with this eulogy was a scholar, \"and a ripe and a good one,\"  and of all my tutors was the only one whom I loved or reverenced.  Unfortunately for me (and, as I afterwards learned, to this worthy man's  great indignation), I was transferred to the care, first of a blockhead,  who was in a perpetual panic lest I should expose his ignorance; and  finally to that of a respectable scholar at the head of a great school on  an ancient foundation.  This man had been appointed to his situation by  --- College, Oxford, and was a sound, well-built scholar, but (like most  men whom I have known from that college) coarse, clumsy, and inelegant.  A  miserable contrast he presented, in my eyes, to the Etonian brilliancy of  my favourite master; and beside, he could not disguise from my hourly  notice the poverty and meagreness of his understanding.  It is a bad  thing for a boy to be and to know himself far beyond his tutors, whether  in knowledge or in power of mind.  This was the case, so far as regarded  knowledge at least, not with myself only, for the two boys, who jointly  with myself composed the first form, were better Grecians than the head-  master, though not more elegant scholars, nor at all more accustomed to  sacrifice to the Graces.  When I first entered I remember that we read  Sophocles; and it was a constant matter of triumph to us, the learned  triumvirate of the first form, to see our \"Archididascalus\" (as he loved  to be called) conning our lessons before we went up, and laying a regular  train, with lexicon and grammar, for blowing up and blasting (as it were)  any difficulties he found in the choruses; whilst _we_ never condescended  to open our books until the moment of going up, and were generally  employed in writing epigrams upon his wig or some such important matter.  My two class-fellows were poor, and dependent for their future prospects  at the university on the recommendation of the head-master; but I, who  had a small patrimonial property, the income of which was sufficient to  support me at college, wished to be sent thither immediately.  I made  earnest representations on the subject to my guardians, but all to no  purpose.  One, who was more reasonable and had more knowledge of the  world than the rest, lived at a distance; two of the other three resigned  all their authority into the hands of the fourth; and this fourth, with  whom I had to negotiate, was a worthy man in his way, but haughty,  obstinate, and intolerant of all opposition to his will.  After a certain  number of letters and personal interviews, I found that I had nothing to  hope for, not even a compromise of the matter, from my guardian.  Unconditional submission was what he demanded, and I prepared myself,  therefore, for other measures.  Summer was now coming on with hasty  steps, and my seventeenth birthday was fast approaching, after which day  I had sworn within myself that I would no longer be numbered amongst  schoolboys.  Money being what I chiefly wanted, I wrote to a woman of  high rank, who, though young herself, had known me from a child, and had  latterly treated me with great distinction, requesting that she would  \"lend\" me five guineas.  For upwards of a week no answer came, and I was  beginning to despond, when at length a servant put into my hands a double  letter with a coronet on the seal.  The letter was kind and obliging.  The  fair writer was on the sea-coast, and in that way the delay had arisen;  she enclosed double of what I had asked, and good-naturedly hinted that  if I should _never_ repay her, it would not absolutely ruin her.  Now,  then, I was prepared for my scheme.  Ten guineas, added to about two  which I had remaining from my pocket-money, seemed to me sufficient for  an indefinite length of time; and at that happy age, if no _definite_  boundary can be assigned to one's power, the spirit of hope and pleasure  makes it virtually infinite.    It is a just remark of Dr. Johnson's (and, what cannot often be said of  his remarks, it is a very feeling one), that we never do anything  consciously for the last time (of things, that is, which we have long  been in the habit of doing) without sadness of heart.  This truth I felt  deeply when I came to leave ---, a place which I did not love, and where  I had not been happy.  On the evening before I left --- for ever, I  grieved when the ancient and lofty schoolroom resounded with the evening  service, performed for the last time in my hearing; and at night, when  the muster-roll of names was called over, and mine (as usual) was called  first, I stepped forward, and passing the head-master, who was standing  by, I bowed to him, and looked earnestly in his face, thinking to myself,  \"He is old and infirm, and in this world I shall not see him again.\"  I  was right; I never _did_ see him again, nor ever shall.  He looked at me  complacently, smiled good-naturedly, returned my salutation (or rather my  valediction), and we parted (though he knew it not) for ever.  I could  not reverence him intellectually, but he had been uniformly kind to me,  and had allowed me many indulgences; and I grieved at the thought of the  mortification I should inflict upon him.    The morning came which was to launch me into the world, and from which my  whole succeeding life has in many important points taken its colouring.  I  lodged in the head-master's house, and had been allowed from my first  entrance the indulgence of a private room, which I used both as a  sleeping-room and as a study.  At half after three I rose, and gazed with  deep emotion at the ancient towers of ---, \"drest in earliest light,\" and  beginning to crimson with the radiant lustre of a cloudless July morning.  I was firm and immovable in my purpose; but yet agitated by anticipation  of uncertain danger and troubles; and if I could have foreseen the  hurricane and perfect hail-storm of affliction which soon fell upon me,  well might I have been agitated.  To this agitation the deep peace of the "]]]
