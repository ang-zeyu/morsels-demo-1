This may be partly  accounted for by the fact that he would never be likely to hear the  sailor sing them ashore, and partly because of the Rabelaisian  character of the words to which they were sung aboard ship. We had  very prim notions of propriety in those days, and were apt to overlook  the beauty of the melodies, and to speak of shanties in bulk as 'low  vulgar songs.' Be that as it may, it was not until the late  eighties--when the shanty was beginning to die out with the sailing  ship--that any attempt was made to form a collection.      ORIGIN OF THE WORD    Here let me enter my protest against the literary preciosity which  derives the word from (_un_) _chante_ and spells it 'chanty'--in other  words, against the gratuitous assumption that unlettered British  sailors derived one of the commonest words in their vocabulary from a  foreign source. The result of this 'literary' spelling is that  ninety-nine landsmen out of every hundred, instead of pronouncing the  word 'shanty,' rhyming with 'scanty' (_as every sailor did_),  pronounce it 'tchahnty,' rhyming with 'auntie,' thereby courting the  amusement or contempt of every seaman. The vogue of '_ch_anty' was  apparently created by the late W.E. Henley, a fine poet, a great man  of letters, a profound admirer of shanty tunes, but entirely  unacquainted with nautical affairs. Kipling and other landsmen have  given additional currency to the spelling. The 'literary' sailors,  Clark Russell and Frank Bullen, have also spelt it '_ch_anty,' but  their reason is obvious. The modest seaman always bowed before the  landsman's presumed superiority in 'book-larnin'.' What more natural  than that Russell and Bullen, obsessed by so ancient a tradition,  should accept uncritically the landsman's spelling. But educated  sailors devoid of 'literary' pretensions have always written the word  as it was pronounced. To my mind the strongest argument against the  literary landsman's derivation of the word is that the British sailor  cultivated the supremest contempt for everything French, and would be  the last person to label such a definitely British practice as  shanty-singing with a French title. If there had been such a thing in  French ships as a labour-song bearing such a far-fetched title as  (_un_) _chante_, there might have been a remote possibility of the  British sailor adopting the French term in a spirit of sport or  derision, but there is no evidence that any such practice, or any such  term, achieved any vogue in French ships. As a matter of fact, the  Oxford Dictionary (which prints it '_sh_anty') states that the word  never found its way into print until 1869.    The truth is that, however plausible the French derivation theory may  sound, it is after all pure speculation--and a landsman's speculation  at that--unsupported by a shred of concrete evidence.    If I wished to advance another theory more plausible still, and  equally unconvincing, I might urge that the word was derived from the  negro hut-removals already mentioned. Here, at least, we have a very  ancient custom, which would be familiar to British seamen visiting  West Indian seaports. The object moved was a _shanty_; the music  accompanying the operation was called, by the negroes, a _shanty_  tune; its musical form (solo and chorus) was identical with the sailor  _shanty_; the pulls on the rope followed the same method which  obtained at sea; the soloist was called a _shanty_man; like the  shantyman at sea he did no work, but merely extemporized verses to  which the workers at the ropes supplied the chorus; and finally, the  negroes still pronounce the word itself exactly as the seaman did.    I am quite aware of the flaws in the above argument, but at least it  shows a manual labour act performed both afloat and ashore under  precisely similar conditions as to (_a_) its nature, (_b_) its musical  setting; called by the same name, _with the same pronunciation_ in  each case; and lastly, connected, in one case, with an actual hut or  _shanty_. Against this concrete argument we have a landsman's abstract  speculation, which (_a_) begs the whole question, and (_b_) which was  never heard of until a few years before the disappearance of the  sailing ship. I do not assert that the negroid derivation is  conclusive, but that from (_un_) _chante_ will not bear serious  inspection.      BIBLIOGRAPHY    The material under this head is very scanty. Nothing of any  consequence was written before the eighties, when W.L. Alden, in  _Harper's Magazine_, and James Runciman, in the _St. James's Gazette_  and other papers, wrote articles on the subject with musical  quotations. Since then several collections have appeared:         1887. _Sailors' Songs or Chanties_, the words by Frederick       J. Davis, R.N.R., the music composed and arranged upon       traditional sailor airs by Ferris Tozer, Mus. D. Oxon.         1888. _The Music of the Waters_, by Laura Alexandrine Smith.         1910 and 1912. _Sea Songs, Ships, and Shanties_, by Capt.       W.B. Whall.         1912. _Songs of Sea Labour_, by Frank T. Bullen and W.F.       Arnold.         1914. _English Folk Chanteys_ with Pianoforte Accompaniment,       collected by Cecil J. Sharp.    Of all these collections Capt. Whall's is the only one which a sailor  could accept as authoritative. Capt. Whall unfortunately only gives  the twenty-eight shanties which he himself learnt at sea. But to any  one who has heard them sung aboard the old sailing ships, his versions  ring true, and have a bite and a snap that is lacking in those  published by mere collectors.    Davis and Tozer's book has had a great vogue, as it was for many years  the only one on the market. But the statement that the music is  'composed and arranged on traditional sailor airs' rules it out of  court in the eyes of seamen, since (_a_) a sailor song is not a  shanty, and (_b_) to 'compose and arrange on traditional airs' is to  destroy the traditional form.    Miss Smith's book is a thick volume into which was tumbled  indiscriminately and uncritically a collection of all sorts of tunes  from all sorts of countries which had any connection with seas, lakes,  rivers, or their geographical equivalents. Scientific folk-song  collecting was not understood in those days, and consequently all was  fish that came to the authoress's net. Sailor shanties and landsmen's  nautical effusions were jumbled together higgledy-piggledy, along with  'Full Fathom Five' and the 'Eton Boating Song.' But this lack of  discrimination, pardonable in those days, was not so serious as the  inability to write the tunes down correctly. So long as they were  copied from other song-books they were not so bad, but when it came to  taking them down from the seamen's singing the results were  deplorable. Had the authoress been able to give us correct versions of  the shanties her collection would have been a valuable one. The book  contains altogether about thirty-two shanties collected from sailors  in the Tyne seaports. Since both Miss Smith and myself hail from  Newcastle, her 'hunting ground' for shanties was also mine, and I am  consequently in a position to assess the importance or unimportance of  her work. I may, therefore, say that although hardly a single shanty  is noted down correctly, I can see clearly--having myself noted the  same tunes in the same district--what she intended to convey, and  furthermore can vouch for the accuracy of some of the words which were  common to north country sailors, and which have not appeared in other  collections.    If I have been obliged to criticize Miss Smith's book it is not  because I wish to disparage a well-intentioned effort, but because I  constantly hear _The Music of the Waters_ quoted as an authoritative  work on sailor shanties; and since the shanties in it were all  collected in the district where I spent boyhood and youth, I am  familiar with all of them, and can state definitely that they are in  no sense authoritative. I should like, however, to pay my tribute of  respect to Miss Smith's industry, and to her enterprise in calling  attention to tunes that then seemed in a fair way to disappear.    Bullen and Arnold's book ought to have been a valuable contribution to  shanty literature, as Bullen certainly knew his shanties, and used to  sing them capitally. Unfortunately his musical collaborator does not  appear to have been gifted with the faculty of taking down authentic  versions from his singing. He seems to have had difficulty in  differentiating between long measured notes and unmeasured pauses;  between the respective meanings of three-four and six-eight time;  between modal and modern tunes; and between the cases where irregular  barring was or was not required. Apart from the amateur nature of the  harmonies, the book exhibits such strange unacquaintance with the  rudiments of musical notation as the following (p. 25):    [Music illustration]    A few other collections deserve mention:         1912. _The Esperance Morris Book_, Part II (Curwen Edition       8571), contains five shanties collected and arranged by       Clive Carey.         1914. _Shanties and Forebitters_, collected and       accompaniments written by Mrs. Clifford Beckett (Curwen       Edition 6293).         _Journal of the Folk-Song Society_, Nos. 12, 18, and 20,       contain articles on shanties, with musical examples       (melodies only), which, from the academic point of view, are       not without interest.         1920. _The Motherland Song Book_ (Vols. III and IV, edited       by R. Vaughan Williams) contains seven shanties. It is       worthy of note that Dr. Vaughan Williams, Mr. Clive Carey,       and Mrs. Clifford Beckett all spell the word 'shanty' as       sailors pronounced it.         1920. _Sailor Shanties arranged for Solo and Chorus of Men's       Voices_ by the present editor; two selections (Curwen       Edition 50571 and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20777"],[0,"R. Caldecott's First Collection of Pictures and Songs (#2)"],[1,"       And made him faster run.        Away went Gilpin, and away          Went postboy at his heels,      The postboy's horse right glad to miss          The lumbering of the wheels.            [Illustration]        Six gentlemen upon the road,          Thus seeing Gilpin fly,      With postboy scampering in the rear,          They raised the hue and cry.        \"Stop thief! stop thief! a highwayman!\"          Not one of them was mute;      And all and each that passed that way          Did join in the pursuit.            [Illustration: To London. To Ware.]        And now the turnpike-gates again          Flew open in short space;      The toll-man thinking, as before,          That Gilpin rode a race.            [Illustration]        And so he did, and won it too,          For he got first to town;      Nor stopped till where he had got up,          He did again get down.        Now let us sing, Long live the King,          And Gilpin, long live he;      And when he next doth ride abroad,          May I be there to see.

[Illustration]            [Illustration]        A kind and gentle heart he had,        To comfort friends and foes;      The naked every day he clad,            [Illustration]          When he put on            [Illustration]                         his clothes.            [Illustration]            [Illustration]        And in that town a dog was found:        As many dogs there be--            [Illustration]        Both mongrel, puppy, whelp,                                  and hound,            [Illustration]          And curs of low degree.            [Illustration]        This dog and man at first were friends;            [Illustration]          But, when a pique began,      The dog, to gain some private ends,            [Illustration]          Went mad, and bit the man.            [Illustration]            [Illustration]        Around from all            [Illustration]                        the neighbouring streets            [Illustration]          The wondering neighbours ran;            [Illustration]            [Illustration]        And swore the dog had lost his wits,            [Illustration: Blind]          To bite so good a man.            [Illustration]        The wound it seem'd both sore and sad        To every christian eye;            [Illustration]            [Illustration]        And while they swore the dog was mad,            [Illustration]          They swore the man would die.        But soon a wonder came to light,        That show'd the rogues they lied--            [Illustration]        The man recover'd of the bite,            [Illustration]          The dog it was that died.

A gentleman of good account        In Norfolke dwelt of late,      Who did in honour far surmount        Most men of his estate.        Sore sicke he was, and like to dye,        No helpe his life could save;      His wife by him as sicke did lye,        And both possest one grave.            [Illustration]        No love between these two was lost,        Each was to other kinde;      In love they liv'd, in love they dyed,        And left two babes behinde:        The one a fine and pretty boy,        Not passing three yeares olde;      The other a girl more young than he        And fram'd in beautye's molde.        The father left his little son,        As plainlye doth appeare,      When he to perfect age should come        Three hundred poundes a yeare.        And to his little daughter Jane        Five hundred poundes in gold,      To be paid downe on marriage-day,        Which might not be controll'd:            [Illustration]        But if the children chanced to dye,        Ere they to age should come,      Their uncle should possesse their wealth;        For so the wille did run.            [Illustration: NOW, BROTHER, said the dying man,           LOOK TO MY CHILDREN DEARE]        \"Now, brother,\" said the dying man,        \"Look to my children deare;      Be good unto my boy and girl,        No friendes else have they here:        \"To God and you I do commend        My children deare this daye;      But little while be sure we have        Within this world to staye.        \"You must be father and mother both,        And uncle all in one;      God knowes what will become of them,        When I am dead and gone.\"            [Illustration]        With that bespake their mother deare:        \"O brother kinde,\" quoth shee,      \"You are the man must bring our babes        To wealth or miserie:            [Illustration]            [Illustration]        \"And if you keep them carefully,        Then God will you reward;      But if you otherwise should deal,        God will your deedes regard.\"            [Illustration: WITH LIPPES AS COLD AS ANY STONE,           THEY KIST THE CHILDREN SMALL]        With lippes as cold as any stone,        They kist the children small:      \"God bless you both, my children deare;\"        With that the teares did fall.
