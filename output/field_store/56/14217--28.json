For you there will be another, some day.  But I talk too much. Here is your letter.\"    I went where I would be undisturbed, to the reading room of the library  on the same street as my flat. To the musty, oblong, dimly lit room  whose threshold sunshine and fresh air dared not cross. Without the  saving warmth of sunlight or the fresh, clean relief of sweet-smelling  air, I read. Read, inhaling the pungent, sour smell of the Scotch I had  consumed during the long, sleepless night. Read, and then doubted that I  had read at all--but the blue ink on the white paper forced me to  acknowledge its actuality. It had been written by Hunter, in a neat,  scholar's script.    _Dear Morris_: (It began)    _Why should I not have wanted Maria? You did; others doubtless did. Why  then should she not be mine? There are many things worse than being  married to me; she might have married a man who beat her!_    _With her I have known the two happiest days of my life. I want no more  than that. I have no right to ask for more. Have we, any of us, a right  to endless bliss on this earth? Hardly._    _You thought of her welfare above all; for that I owe you some  explanation. You must be patient, you must believe, and in the end, you  must do as I ask._ You must.    _You wanted to know about me--of my life before Maria. Before Maria? It  seems strange to think about it. There is no life without Maria. Still,  there was a time when for me she didn't exist. I have been constantly  going forward to the day when I would meet her, yet there was a time  when I didn't know where I would find her, or even what her name would  be!_    _It was chance that brought us together. For me, good chance; for you,  possibly ill chance; for Maria? Only she can say. Some three years ago I  was studying in England under a Rhodes Scholarship. The future held  great things for me. I was a Yank like yourself, and damn proud of it.  Life in England seemed strange and slow and sometimes utterly dismal  under Austerity. Then, little by little I slipped into their slower  ways, growing to love the people for their spunk, and finally coming to  feel I was one of them, so to speak._    _I have said everything slowed down: I was wrong. Studying intensified  for me. The folklore of the British Isles intrigued me. I delved into  the Black Welsh tales, the mischievous fancies of the Irish, the English  legends of the prowling werewolf. For me it was a relief from political  science, which suddenly palled and which smacked of treason in the light  of current events. My extracurricular research consumed the better part  of my evenings. My books were and always have been a part of me, and as  was to be expected, I overdid it. I studied too hard with too little  let-up. Sometimes it seemed to me there was more truth to what I read  than myth. It became somewhat of an obsession. Suddenly, one night,  everything blacked out._    _I came to in a sanatorium. I didn't know how I got there, and when they  explained it to me, I laughed. I thought they were joking. When I tried  to get up, to walk, I collapsed. Then I knew how bad it had been. I  knew, too, I would have to go slowly._    _It was there I met Eve. She was beautiful. Not like Maria, who is like  a fragile, fair, spun-sugar angel. Eve was more earthy, with skin like  ivory, creamy and rich and pale. Her blue-black hair she wore long and  gathered in the back. She looked about twenty-five, but a streak of pure  white ran back from each of her temples. She was the most striking woman  I have ever met. I had never known anyone like her, nor have I since I  saw her last._    _You know how it is: the air of mystery about a woman makes a man like a  kid again. She reminded me of a sleek, black cat, with her large, hazel  eyes. I bumped into her one day on the verandah, and spent every day  with her after that._    _The doctors wanted me to take exercise--short walks and the like, and  Eve went with me, struggling to keep up with me. The slightest effort  tired her. She suffered from a rather nasty case of anemia. She seldom  smiled; the effort was probably too much for her. I saw her really smile  only once._    _We had been on one of our short hikes in the woods close by the  grounds. She stumbled over a twig or a branch, I'm not sure which.  Suddenly she was in my arms. Have you ever held a cloud in your arms,  Morris? So light she was, although she was almost as tall as I. Warm and  pulsating. Her eyes held mine; it was almost uncanny. I have never been  affected like that by a woman. Then I was kissing her; then a sharp  sting, and I winced. There was the warm, salt taste of blood on my lips.  I never knew how it happened. But she was smiling, her full mouth parted  in the strangest smile I have ever seen. And those small white teeth  gleamed; and in her eyes, which were all black pupils now, with the iris  quite hidden, was desire--or something beyond desire. I couldn't define  it then; now, I think I can. Her small, pink tongue darted over her  lips, tasting, seeming to savor._    _I was frightened, for some indefinable reason. I wanted to get away  from her, from the woods, from myself. I grasped her arm roughly and we  started back for the grounds. We never mentioned the episode again, but  we neither of us ever forgot. She intrigued me now, more than ever. The  doctors were able to satisfy my curiosity somewhat. They told me she had  been a patient for some four years. Some days she was better, some days  worse. She needed rest--much rest. Most days she slept past noon with  their approval. Some days there was a faint flush beneath that ivory  skin; other days it was pale and cool._    _Just when we became lovers, I scarcely remember. Things were happening  so fast I could barely keep pace with them. There was a magnetism about  Eve which compelled. I couldn't have resisted if I'd wanted to--and I  didn't._    _I began to have long periods of lassitude, times when I would black out  and remember nothing afterwards. And the dreams began. I would dream I  was stroking a large, velvety-black cat, a cat with shining yellow eyes  that looked at me as if they knew my every thought. I would stroke it  continuously and it would nip me playfully. Then, one night the dream  intensified: I was playing with the creature, caressing it gently, when  of a sudden its lips drew back in a snarl, and without warning it sprang  at my throat and buried its fangs deep! I thought I could feel life  being drawn from me; I screamed._    _The doctors told me afterwards that I was semi-conscious for days; that  I had to be restrained._    _When I was well again, Eve came to see me. She was gentle--soothing.  She held me close to her and oh! it was good to be alive and to belong  to someone._    _I remember to this day what she wore. Black velvet lounging slacks, a  low-necked amber satin blouse, caught at the \"V\" by a curiously wrought  antique silver pin. It was round, about four inches in diameter. In its  center was the carved figure of a serpent coiled to strike. Its eyes  were deep amber topazes and its darting tongue was raised and set with a  blood-red ruby._    _\"What an unusual pin, Eve,\" I said \"I've never seen it before, have  I?\"_    _\"No,\" she replied. \"It belongs to the deep, dark, seldom discussed  skeleton in the Orcaczy closet, Tod. You see, my great-great grandmother  was quite a wicked lady, to hear tell. Went in for Witches' masses and  the like. They say she poisoned her husband, a rather elderly and very  childish man, for her lover, whom she subsequently married. Together  they did away with relatives who stood in the way of their accumulating  more money. This pin was the instrument of death.\"_    _Her slim fingers pressed the ruby tongue and the pin opened, revealing  a space large enough to secrete powder._    _\"It's like those employed by the infamous Borgias, as you can see,\" she  continued, shrugging. \"Perhaps it was fate then, that her devoted new  husband tired of her once her fortune was assured him, took a young  mistress for himself, and disposed of the unfortunate wife, using her  own pin to perpetrate her murder. She was excommunicated by her church,  too, which must have made it most unpleasant for her, poor old dear.\"  The slim shoulders straightened. \"But let's not discuss such unpleasant  things, my dear. The important thing now is for you to get well quickly.  I've missed you terribly, you know.\"_    _It was then I asked her to marry me. I knew I didn't really love her,  but there seemed nothing to prevent our marriage. And she had gotten  under my skin. It was as elemental as that. She said she thought we  should wait until I fully recovered._    _\"Don't say any more, darling,\" she said. \"Rest your poor, sore  throat.\"_    _She bent over me solicitously and I reached up to stroke that smooth  black hair. It had a familiar feel to it that I couldn't quite place. Of  course I had stroked it hundreds of times before, but it wasn't that.  Then she looked straight at me, those large, glowing hazel eyes boring  into mine, and I knew. Knew and disbelieved at the same time. I froze  where I lay, paralyzed by my fear; unable to make a sound._    _\"So you know,\" she whispered. \"It is well. I have marked you for my own  these many months. Now that you know, you will not fight. You know what  I am, or at least you can guess. This pin you admired so--it was mine  three hundred years ago and it will always be mine!\"_    _Her lips were on mine. She had never kissed me like this. It was like  the touch of hot ice, freezing, then searing. Unendurable. I lay inert;  I couldn't have moved if I wanted to. I could scarcely breathe. Then I  felt the blood within me pounding, pulsing, beginning to answer in spite  of myself. I tasted once more the warm, salty fluid on my lips.
