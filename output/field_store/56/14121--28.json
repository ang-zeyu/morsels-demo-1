So looked the Pharaohs and the later Ptolemies; so  looked Mizraim, father of the Egyptian race. He wore the kamis,  a white cotton shirt tight-sleeved, open in front, extending to  the ankles and embroidered down the collar and breast, over which  was thrown a brown woollen cloak, now, as in all probability  it was then, called the aba, an outer garment with long skirt  and short sleeves, lined inside with stuff of mixed cotton and  silk, edged all round with a margin of clouded yellow. His feet  were protected by sandals, attached by thongs of soft leather.  A sash held the kamis to his waist. What was very noticeable,  considering he was alone, and that the desert was the haunt of  leopards and lions, and men quite as wild, he carried no arms,  not even the crooked stick used for guiding camels; wherefore we  may at least infer his errand peaceful, and that he was either  uncommonly bold or under extraordinary protection.    The traveller's limbs were numb, for the ride had been long and  wearisome; so he rubbed his hands and stamped his feet, and walked  round the faithful servant, whose lustrous eyes were closing in calm  content with the cud he had already found. Often, while making the  circuit, he paused, and, shading his eyes with his hands, examined the  desert to the extremest verge of vision; and always, when the survey  was ended, his face clouded with disappointment, slight, but enough  to advise a shrewd spectator that he was there expecting company,  if not by appointment; at the same time, the spectator would have  been conscious of a sharpening of the curiosity to learn what the  business could be that required transaction in a place so far from  civilized abode.    However disappointed, there could be little doubt of the stranger's  confidence in the coming of the expected company. In token thereof,  he went first to the litter, and, from the cot or box opposite  the one he had occupied in coming, produced a sponge and a  small gurglet of water, with which he washed the eyes, face,  and nostrils of the camel; that done, from the same depository he  drew a circular cloth, red-and white-striped, a bundle of rods,  and a stout cane. The latter, after some manipulation, proved to  be a cunning device of lesser joints, one within another, which,  when united together, formed a centre pole higher than his head.  When the pole was planted, and the rods set around it, he spread  the cloth over them, and was literally at home--a home much smaller  than the habitations of emir and sheik, yet their counterpart in  all other respects. From the litter again he brought a carpet or  square rug, and covered the floor of the tent on the side from  the sun. That done, he went out, and once more, and with greater  care and more eager eyes, swept the encircling country. Except a  distant jackal, galloping across the plain, and an eagle flying  towards the Gulf of Akaba, the waste below, like the blue above  it, was lifeless.    He turned to the camel, saying low, and in a tongue strange to the  desert, \"We are far from home, O racer with the swiftest winds--we are  far from home, but God is with us. Let us be patient.\"    Then he took some beans from a pocket in the saddle, and put them  in a bag made to hang below the animal's nose; and when he saw the  relish with which the good servant took to the food, he turned and  again scanned the world of sand, dim with the glow of the vertical  sun.    \"They will come,\" he said, calmly. \"He that led me is leading them.  I will make ready.\"    From the pouches which lined the interior of the cot, and from a  willow basket which was part of its furniture, he brought forth  materials for a meal: platters close-woven of the fibres of  palms; wine in small gurglets of skin; mutton dried and smoked;  stoneless shami, or Syrian pomegranates; dates of El Shelebi,  wondrous rich and grown in the nakhil, or palm orchards, of Central  Arabia; cheese, like David's \"slices of milk;\" and leavened bread  from the city bakery--all which he carried and set upon the carpet  under the tent. As the final preparation, about the provisions he  laid three pieces of silk cloth, used among refined people of the  East to cover the knees of guests while at table--a circumstance  significant of the number of persons who were to partake of his  entertainment--the number he was awaiting.    All was now ready. He stepped out: lo! in the east a dark speck  on the face of the desert. He stood as if rooted to the ground;  his eyes dilated; his flesh crept chilly, as if touched by  something supernatural. The speck grew; became large as a hand;  at length assumed defined proportions. A little later, full into  view swung a duplication of his own dromedary, tall and white,  and bearing a houdah, the travelling litter of Hindostan. Then the  Egyptian crossed his hands upon his breast, and looked to heaven.    \"God only is great!\" he exclaimed, his eyes full of tears, his soul  in awe.    The stranger drew nigh--at last stopped. Then he, too, seemed just  waking. He beheld the kneeling camel, the tent, and the man standing  prayerfully at the door. He crossed his hands, bent his head, and  prayed silently; after which, in a little while, he stepped from  his camel's neck to the sand, and advanced towards the Egyptian,  as did the Egyptian towards him. A moment they looked at each other;  then they embraced--that is, each threw his right arm over the  other's shoulder, and the left round the side, placing his chin  first upon the left, then upon the right breast.    \"Peace be with thee, O servant of the true God!\" the stranger said.    \"And to thee, O brother of the true faith!--to thee peace and  welcome,\" the Egyptian replied, with fervor.    The new-comer was tall and gaunt, with lean face, sunken eyes,  white hair and beard, and a complexion between the hue of cinnamon  and bronze. He, too, was unarmed. His costume was Hindostani;  over the skull-cap a shawl was wound in great folds, forming a  turban; his body garments were in the style of the Egyptian's,  except that the aba was shorter, exposing wide flowing breeches  gathered at the ankles. In place of sandals, his feet were clad  in half-slippers of red leather, pointed at the toes. Save the  slippers, the costume from head to foot was of white linen. The air  of the man was high, stately, severe. Visvamitra, the greatest of  the ascetic heroes of the Iliad of the East, had in him a perfect  representative. He might have been called a Life drenched with the  wisdom of Brahma--Devotion Incarnate. Only in his eyes was there  proof of humanity; when he lifted his face from the Egyptian's  breast, they were glistening with tears.    \"God only is great!\" he exclaimed, when the embrace was finished.    \"And blessed are they that serve him!\" the Egyptian answered,  wondering at the paraphrase of his own exclamation. \"But let us  wait,\" he added, \"let us wait; for see, the other comes yonder!\"    They looked to the north, where, already plain to view, a third  camel, of the whiteness of the others, came careening like a ship.  They waited, standing together--waited until the new-comer arrived,  dismounted, and advanced towards them.    \"Peace to you, O my brother!\" he said, while embracing the Hindoo.    And the Hindoo answered, \"God's will be done!\"    The last comer was all unlike his friends: his frame was slighter;  his complexion white; a mass of waving light hair was a perfect  crown for his small but beautiful head; the warmth of his dark-blue  eyes certified a delicate mind, and a cordial, brave nature. He was  bareheaded and unarmed. Under the folds of the Tyrian blanket which  he wore with unconscious grace appeared a tunic, short-sleeved and  low-necked, gathered to the waist by a band, and reaching nearly to  the knee; leaving the neck, arms, and legs bare. Sandals guarded  his feet. Fifty years, probably more, had spent themselves upon  him, with no other effect, apparently, than to tinge his demeanor  with gravity and temper his words with forethought. The physical  organization and the brightness of soul were untouched. No need to  tell the student from what kindred he was sprung; if he came not  himself from the groves of Athene', his ancestry did.    When his arms fell from the Egyptian, the latter said, with a  tremulous voice, \"The Spirit brought me first; wherefore I know  myself chosen to be the servant of my brethren. The tent is set,  and the bread is ready for the breaking. Let me perform my office.\"    Taking each by the hand, he led them within, and removed their  sandals and washed their feet, and he poured water upon their  hands, and dried them with napkins.    Then, when he had laved his own hands, he said, \"Let us take care  of ourselves, brethren, as our service requires, and eat, that we  may be strong for what remains of the day's duty. While we eat,  we will each learn who the others are, and whence they come,  and how they are called.\"    He took them to the repast, and seated them so that they faced  each other. Simultaneously their heads bent forward, their hands  crossed upon their breasts, and, speaking together, they said  aloud this simple grace:    \"Father of all--God!--what we have here is of thee; take our thanks  and bless us, that we may continue to do thy will.\"    With the last word they raised their eyes, and looked at each other  in wonder. Each had spoken in a language never before heard by the  others; yet each understood perfectly what was said. Their souls  thrilled with divine emotion; for by the miracle they recognized  the Divine Presence.          CHAPTER III      To speak in the style of the period, the meeting just described took  place in the year of Rome 747.

For two days and nights this express car was dragged along at the tail  of shrieking locomotives; and for two days and nights Buck neither ate  nor drank. In his anger he had met the first advances of the express  messengers with growls, and they had retaliated by teasing him. When he  flung himself against the bars, quivering and frothing, they laughed  at him and taunted him. They growled and barked like detestable dogs,  mewed, and flapped their arms and crowed. It was all very silly, he  knew; but therefore the more outrage to his dignity, and his anger waxed  and waxed. He did not mind the hunger so much, but the lack of water  caused him severe suffering and fanned his wrath to fever-pitch. For  that matter, high-strung and finely sensitive, the ill treatment had  flung him into a fever, which was fed by the inflammation of his parched  and swollen throat and tongue.    He was glad for one thing: the rope was off his neck. That had given  them an unfair advantage; but now that it was off, he would show them.  They would never get another rope around his neck. Upon that he was  resolved. For two days and nights he neither ate nor drank, and during  those two days and nights of torment, he accumulated a fund of wrath  that boded ill for whoever first fell foul of him. His eyes turned  blood-shot, and he was metamorphosed into a raging fiend. So changed was  he that the Judge himself would not have recognized him; and the express  messengers breathed with relief when they bundled him off the train at  Seattle.    Four men gingerly carried the crate from the wagon into a small,  high-walled back yard. A stout man, with a red sweater that sagged  generously at the neck, came out and signed the book for the driver.  That was the man, Buck divined, the next tormentor, and he hurled  himself savagely against the bars. The man smiled grimly, and brought a  hatchet and a club.    \"You ain't going to take him out now?\" the driver asked.    \"Sure,\" the man replied, driving the hatchet into the crate for a pry.    There was an instantaneous scattering of the four men who had carried  it in, and from safe perches on top the wall they prepared to watch the  performance.    Buck rushed at the splintering wood, sinking his teeth into it, surging  and wrestling with it. Wherever the hatchet fell on the outside, he was  there on the inside, snarling and growling, as furiously anxious to get  out as the man in the red sweater was calmly intent on getting him out.    \"Now, you red-eyed devil,\" he said, when he had made an opening  sufficient for the passage of Buck's body. At the same time he dropped  the hatchet and shifted the club to his right hand.    And Buck was truly a red-eyed devil, as he drew himself together for the  spring, hair bristling, mouth foaming, a mad glitter in his blood-shot  eyes. Straight at the man he launched his one hundred and forty pounds  of fury, surcharged with the pent passion of two days and nights. In  mid air, just as his jaws were about to close on the man, he received  a shock that checked his body and brought his teeth together with an  agonizing clip. He whirled over, fetching the ground on his back and  side. He had never been struck by a club in his life, and did not  understand. With a snarl that was part bark and more scream he was again  on his feet and launched into the air. And again the shock came and he  was brought crushingly to the ground. This time he was aware that it was  the club, but his madness knew no caution. A dozen times he charged, and  as often the club broke the charge and smashed him down.    After a particularly fierce blow, he crawled to his feet, too dazed to  rush. He staggered limply about, the blood flowing from nose and mouth  and ears, his beautiful coat sprayed and flecked with bloody slaver.  Then the man advanced and deliberately dealt him a frightful blow on  the nose. All the pain he had endured was as nothing compared with the  exquisite agony of this. With a roar that was almost lionlike in its  ferocity, he again hurled himself at the man. But the man, shifting the  club from right to left, coolly caught him by the under jaw, at the same  time wrenching downward and backward. Buck described a complete circle  in the air, and half of another, then crashed to the ground on his head  and chest.    For the last time he rushed. The man struck the shrewd blow he had  purposely withheld for so long, and Buck crumpled up and went down,  knocked utterly senseless.    \"He's no slouch at dog-breakin', that's wot I say,\" one of the men on  the wall cried enthusiastically.    \"Druther break cayuses any day, and twice on Sundays,\" was the reply of  the driver, as he climbed on the wagon and started the horses.    Buck's senses came back to him, but not his strength. He lay where he  had fallen, and from there he watched the man in the red sweater.    \"'Answers to the name of Buck,'\" the man soliloquized, quoting from the  saloon-keeper's letter which had announced the consignment of the crate  and contents. \"Well, Buck, my boy,\" he went on in a genial voice, \"we've  had our little ruction, and the best thing we can do is to let it go at  that. You've learned your place, and I know mine. Be a good dog and all  'll go well and the goose hang high. Be a bad dog, and I'll whale the  stuffin' outa you. Understand?\"    As he spoke he fearlessly patted the head he had so mercilessly pounded,  and though Buck's hair involuntarily bristled at touch of the hand,  he endured it without protest. When the man brought him water he drank  eagerly, and later bolted a generous meal of raw meat, chunk by chunk,  from the man's hand.    He was beaten (he knew that); but he was not broken. He saw, once for  all, that he stood no chance against a man with a club. He had learned  the lesson, and in all his after life he never forgot it. That club was  a revelation. It was his introduction to the reign of primitive law,  and he met the introduction halfway. The facts of life took on a fiercer  aspect; and while he faced that aspect uncowed, he faced it with all the  latent cunning of his nature aroused. As the days went by, other dogs  came, in crates and at the ends of ropes, some docilely, and some raging  and roaring as he had come; and, one and all, he watched them pass  under the dominion of the man in the red sweater. Again and again, as he  looked at each brutal performance, the lesson was driven home to Buck:  a man with a club was a lawgiver, a master to be obeyed, though not  necessarily conciliated. Of this last Buck was never guilty, though he  did see beaten dogs that fawned upon the man, and wagged their tails,  and licked his hand. Also he saw one dog, that would neither conciliate  nor obey, finally killed in the struggle for mastery.    Now and again men came, strangers, who talked excitedly, wheedlingly,  and in all kinds of fashions to the man in the red sweater. And at such  times that money passed between them the strangers took one or more of  the dogs away with them. Buck wondered where they went, for they never  came back; but the fear of the future was strong upon him, and he was  glad each time when he was not selected.    Yet his time came, in the end, in the form of a little weazened man who  spat broken English and many strange and uncouth exclamations which Buck  could not understand.    \"Sacredam!\" he cried, when his eyes lit upon Buck. \"Dat one dam bully  dog! Eh? How moch?\"    \"Three hundred, and a present at that,\" was the prompt reply of the man  in the red sweater. \"And seem' it's government money, you ain't got no  kick coming, eh, Perrault?\"    Perrault grinned. Considering that the price of dogs had been boomed  skyward by the unwonted demand, it was not an unfair sum for so fine  an animal. The Canadian Government would be no loser, nor would its  despatches travel the slower. Perrault knew dogs, and when he looked at  Buck he knew that he was one in a thousand--\"One in ten t'ousand,\" he  commented mentally.    Buck saw money pass between them, and was not surprised when Curly, a  good-natured Newfoundland, and he were led away by the little weazened  man. That was the last he saw of the man in the red sweater, and as  Curly and he looked at receding Seattle from the deck of the Narwhal, it  was the last he saw of the warm Southland. Curly and he were taken below  by Perrault and turned over to a black-faced giant called Francois.  Perrault was a French-Canadian, and swarthy; but Francois was a  French-Canadian half-breed, and twice as swarthy. They were a new kind  of men to Buck (of which he was destined to see many more), and while  he developed no affection for them, he none the less grew honestly to  respect them. He speedily learned that Perrault and Francois were fair  men, calm and impartial in administering justice, and too wise in the  way of dogs to be fooled by dogs.    In the 'tween-decks of the Narwhal, Buck and Curly joined two other  dogs. One of them was a big, snow-white fellow from Spitzbergen who had  been brought away by a whaling captain, and who had later accompanied  a Geological Survey into the Barrens. He was friendly, in a treacherous  sort of way, smiling into one's face the while he meditated some  underhand trick, as, for instance, when he stole from Buck's food at the  first meal. As Buck sprang to punish him, the lash of Francois's whip  sang through the air, reaching the culprit first; and nothing remained  to Buck but to recover the bone. That was fair of Francois, he decided,  and the half-breed began his rise in Buck's estimation.    The other dog made no advances, nor received any; also, he did not  attempt to steal from the newcomers. He was a gloomy, morose fellow, and  he showed Curly plainly that all he desired was to "]]]
