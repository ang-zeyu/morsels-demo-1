She knew he was in debt,  but had no idea how extensively he was involved. A creditor had seen  her the day after the funeral and had made some uncouth reference to the  convenience of a death which had automatically cancelled George Beale's  obligations. It needed only that to spur the girl to an action which was  as foolish as it was generous. She had written to all the people to whom  her father owed money and had assumed full responsibility for debts  amounting to hundreds of pounds.    It was the Celt in her that drove her to shoulder the burden which she  was ill-equipped to carry, but she had never regretted her impetuous  act.    There were a few creditors who, realising what had happened, did not  bother her, and there were others....    She earned a fairly good salary on the staff of the _Daily Megaphone_,  which made a feature of fashion, but she would have had to have been the  recipient of a cabinet minister's emoluments to have met the demands  which flowed in upon her a month after she had accepted her father's  obligations.    \"Are you going out to-night, miss?\" asked the woman.    Lydia roused herself from her unpleasant thoughts.    \"Yes. I'm making some drawings of the dresses in Curfew's new play. I'll  be home somewhere around twelve.\"    Mrs. Morgan was half-way across the room when she turned back.    \"One of these days you'll get out of all your troubles, miss, you see if  you don't! I'll bet you'll marry a rich young gentleman.\"    Lydia, sitting on the edge of the table, laughed.    \"You'd lose your money, Mrs. Morgan,\" she said, \"rich young gentlemen  only marry poor working girls in the kind of stories I illustrate. If I  marry it will probably be a very poor young gentleman who will become an  incurable invalid and want nursing. And I shall hate him so much that I  can't be happy with him, and pity him so much that I can't run away from  him.\"    Mrs. Morgan sniffed her disagreement.    \"There are things that happen----\" she began.    \"Not to me--not miracles, anyway,\" said Lydia, still smiling, \"and I  don't know that I want to get married. I've got to pay all these bills  first, and by the time they are settled I'll be a grey-haired old lady  in a mob cap.\"    Lydia had finished her tea and was standing somewhat scantily attired in  the middle of her bedroom, preparing for her theatre engagement, when  Mrs. Morgan returned.    \"I forgot to tell you, miss,\" she said, \"there was a gentleman and a  lady called.\"    \"A gentleman and a lady? Who were they?\"    \"I don't know, Miss Beale. I was lying down at the time, and the girl  answered the door. I gave her strict orders to say that you were out.\"    \"Did they leave any name?\"    \"No, miss. They just asked if Miss Beale lived here, and could they see  her.\"    \"H'm!\" said Lydia with a frown. \"I wonder what we owe them!\"    She dismissed the matter from her mind, and thought no more of it until  she stopped on her way to the theatre to learn from the office by  telephone the number of drawings required.    The chief sub-editor answered her.    \"And, by the way,\" he added, \"there was an inquiry for you at the office  to-day--I found a note of it on my desk when I came in to-night. Some  old friends of yours who want to see you. Brand told them you were going  to do a show at the Erving Theatre to-night, so you'll probably see  them.\"    \"Who are they?\" she asked, puzzled.    She had few friends, old or new.    \"I haven't the foggiest idea,\" was the reply.    At the theatre she saw nobody she knew, though she looked round  interestedly, nor was she approached in any of the _entr'actes_.    In the row ahead of her, and a little to her right, were two people who  regarded her curiously as she entered. The man was about fifty, very  dark and bald--the skin of his head was almost copper-coloured, though  he was obviously a European, for the eyes which beamed benevolently upon  her through powerful spectacles were blue, but so light a blue that by  contrast with the mahogany skin of his clean-shaven face, they seemed  almost white.    The girl who sat with him was fair, and to Lydia's artistic eye,  singularly lovely. Her hair was a mop of fine gold. The colour was  natural, Lydia was too sophisticated to make any mistake about that. Her  features were regular and flawless. The young artist thought she had  never seen so perfect a \"cupid\" mouth in her life. There was something  so freshly, fragrantly innocent about the girl that Lydia's heart went  out to her, and she could hardly keep her eyes on the stage. The unknown  seemed to take almost as much interest in her, for twice Lydia surprised  her backward scrutiny. She found herself wondering who she was. The girl  was beautifully dressed, and about her neck was a platinum chain that  must have hung to her waist--a chain which was broken every few inches  by a big emerald.    It required something of an effort of concentration to bring her mind  back to the stage and her work. With a book on her knee she sketched  the somewhat bizarre costumes which had aroused a mild public interest  in the play, and for the moment forgot her entrancing companion.    She came through the vestibule at the end of the performance, and drew  her worn cloak more closely about her slender shoulders, for the night  was raw, and a sou'westerly wind blew the big wet snowflakes under the  protecting glass awning into the lobby itself. The favoured playgoers  minced daintily through the slush to their waiting cars, then taxis came  into the procession of waiting vehicles, there was a banging of cab  doors, a babble of orders to the scurrying attendants, until something  like order was evolved from the chaos.    \"Cab, miss?\"    Lydia shook her head. An omnibus would take her to Fleet Street, but two  had passed, packed with passengers, and she was beginning to despair,  when a particularly handsome taxi pulled up at the kerb.    The driver leant over the shining apron which partially protected him  from the weather, and shouted:    \"Is Miss Beale there?\"    The girl started in surprise, taking a step toward the cab.    \"I am Miss Beale,\" she said.    \"Your editor has sent me for you,\" said the man briskly.    The editor of the _Megaphone_ had been guilty of many eccentric acts. He  had expressed views on her drawing which she shivered to recall. He had  aroused her in the middle of the night to sketch dresses at a fancy  dress ball, but never before had he done anything so human as to send a  taxi for her. Nevertheless, she would not look at the gift cab too  closely, and she stepped into the warm interior.    The windows were veiled with the snow and the sleet which had been  falling all the time she had been in the theatre. She saw blurred lights  flash past, and realised that the taxi was going at a good pace. She  rubbed the windows and tried to look out after a while. Then she  endeavoured to lower one, but without success. Suddenly she jumped up  and tapped furiously at the window to attract the driver's attention.  There was no mistaking the fact that they were crossing a bridge and it  was not necessary to cross a bridge to reach Fleet Street.    If the driver heard he took no notice. The speed of the car increased.  She tapped at the window again furiously. She was not afraid, but she  was angry. Presently fear came. It was when she tried to open the door,  and found that it was fastened from the outside, that she struck a  match to discover that the windows had been screwed tight--the edge of  the hole where the screw had gone in was rawly new, and the screw's head  was bright and shining.    She had no umbrella--she never carried one to the theatre--and nothing  more substantial in the shape of a weapon than a fountain pen. She could  smash the windows with her foot. She sat back in the seat, and  discovered that it was not so easy an operation as she had thought. She  hesitated even to make the attempt; and then the panic sense left her,  and she was her own calm self again. She was not being abducted. These  things did not happen in the twentieth century, except in sensational  books. She frowned. She had said almost the same thing to somebody that  day--to Mrs. Morgan, who had hinted at a romantic marriage. Of course,  nothing was wrong. The driver had called her by name. Probably the  editor wanted to see her at his home, he lived somewhere in South  London, she remembered. That would explain everything. And yet her  instinct told her that something unusual was happening, that some  unpleasant experience was imminent.    She tried to put the thought out of her mind, but it was too vivid, too  insistent.    Again she tried the door, and then, conscious of a faint reflected glow  on the cloth-lined roof of the cab, she looked backward through the  peep-hole. She saw two great motor-car lamps within a few yards of the  cab. A car was following, she glimpsed the outline of it as they ran  past a street standard.    They were in one of the roads of the outer suburbs. Looking through the  window over the driver's shoulder she saw trees on one side of the road,  and a long grey fence. It was while she was so looking that the car  behind shot suddenly past and ahead, and she saw its tail lights moving  away with a pang of hopelessness. Then, before she realised what had  happened, the big car ahead slowed and swung sideways, blocking the  road, and the cab came to a jerky stop that flung her against the  window. She saw two figures in the dim light of the taxi's head lamps,  heard somebody speak, and the door was jerked open.    \"Will you step out, Miss Beale,\" said a pleasant voice, and though her  legs seemed queerly weak, she obliged. The second man was standing by  the side of the driver. He wore a long raincoat, the collar of which was  turned up to the tip of his nose.    \"You may go back to your friends and tell them "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21531"],[0,"Woodwork Joints: How They Are Set Out, How Made and Where Used. (#2)"],[1," timber can be obtained it will  stand practically straight as the tendency to shrink is in thickness  only. The grain of quartered timber is shown in Fig. 12.    [Illustration: Fig. 10.--Showing Heart side of Timber one way.]    [Illustration: Fig. 11.--Heart side of Timber shown alternated.]    [Illustration: Fig. 12.--Grain of Quartered Timber.]    [Illustration: Fig. 13.--Boards showing uniformity of Grain.]    Judgment should also be exercised to avoid jointing in which one piece of  timber is wild and large in the grain, and the adjoining piece of a  mild-grained nature. Jointed boards should always be glued up with the  grain running in the same direction if possible; this we show at Fig. 13,  and nothing looks worse than a dressing chest end or similar piece of  work in which the grain runs haphazard. When jointing thin timber (say,  1/4-in., 3/8-in., 1/2-in. and 5/8-in. boards) the best method is to use a  shooting board (Fig. 26). It must be noted, however, that a shooting  board and plane practically never give a true right angle, owing to wear  and the grinding of the blade. Therefore, the boards _should not_ all be  laid with the \"face mark\" on the shooting board whilst the edges are  shot, because any inequality would be multiplied by the number of pieces  jointed. A better method is to alternate the boards, face side up, then  face side down, whilst shooting the edges; this will prevent convexity or  concavity on the face of the jointed board, because any slight error in  the angle is neutralised (see Fig. 8).    APPLICATIONS OF THE JOINT.--The following show various applications of  the butt or glued joint:--    [Illustration: Fig. 14.--Carcase Wing-pieces Glued on.]    Fig. 7A shows a mahogany or other hardwood slip glued on the edge of a  cheaper wood, such as pine or whitewood, as is the case on bookcase  shelves when only the front edge is seen and polished.    Fig. 7B shows a moulding glued on a shelf, both mould and shelf in this  instance being of polished hardwood. A shelf of this type might be used  in a recess, the object of the overhanging moulding being to hide a small  3/8-in. iron rod which would carry the curtain rings and heading of the  curtain which covers the recess. The shelf would be fixed about 3 ft. 9  ins. to 4 ft. 3 ins. from the floor.    Fig. 14 shows the wing pieces glued on the top bearer of carcase work.  The application of this bearer in its position will be shown in the  chapter on Dovetailing.    Fig. 15 shows a butt joint planed at an angle of 45 degrees (commonly  called a mitre), used for box feet, etc.    Fig. 16 shows jointing up of an ogee-shaped panel. The dotted lines  indicate the thickness of the timber previous to its being worked up to  the finished shape. Bow-fronted and semicircular panels are jointed in a  similar manner.    [Illustration: Fig. 15.--Butting Mitred Angle Joint.]    [Illustration: Fig. 16.--Jointing Ogee-shaped Panel.]    Fig. 17 shows timber jointed at right angles to the upright piece, and at  an angle of 30 degrees.    Fig. 18 indicates quarter-circle jointing, as used in round-cornered  chests of drawers, wardrobes, cupboards, etc.    Fig. 19 is similar to Fig. 18, but with hollow (or concave) corners.    [Illustration: Fig. 17.--Jointed Timber at 30 deg. and 90 deg. angles.]    [Illustration: Fig. 18 (above).--Convex Corner.]    [Illustration: Fig. 19 (below).--Concave Corner.]    [Illustration: Fig. 20.--Jointing a shaped Spandrel.]    [Illustration: Fig. 21.--Building up Case of Piano Front.]    [Illustration: Fig. 22.--Use of the Try-square for Testing Edge.]    [Illustration: Fig. 23.--Example of Circular Laminated work.]    [Illustration: Fig. 24.--Glueing Ploughslips to Drawer.]    [Illustration: Fig. 25.--Method of holding Glued Joints with Iron Dogs.]    [Illustration: Fig. 26.--Method of using Shooting Board.]    Fig. 20 gives us the jointing up of a shaped spandrel to the required  width. In a case of this description suitably grained and coloured wood  should be selected, otherwise the bad match will at once draw attention  to the joint.    Fig. 21 shows the application of butt or glued jointing to the building  up of the core of a piano fall previous to shaping up and veneering.    Fig. 23.--Laminated work--the building up of circular rims for cabinet  and joinery work. Plan and elevation show rim pattern of a pulley as used  in the pattern-making trade.    [Illustration: Fig. 27.--Cramping Glued Joints: Handscrews and Batten  shown at left; temporary Batten at right to keep the wood flat.]    Fig. 24.--The glueing of a ploughslip to a drawer side is seen here, the  ploughslip being used to carry the drawer bottom.    Fig. 26 shows the method of jointing with shooting board and trying  plane; the right hand operates the plane whilst the left hand holds the  wood firm upon the shooting board.    Owing to the importation of narrow and faulty timber the necessity of  jointing is greater to-day than ever it was, wide timber of course  meaning higher cost for raw material.    The method of using iron dogs is illustrated in Fig. 25, and it will be  observed that owing to the wedge-like formation of each fang (see  enlarged sketch) the dog exerts the necessary pressure to close the  joint. At the centre of this illustration is suggested the home-made  hardwood blocks, baseboard and wedges referred to on page 4.    Fig. 27 shows how the iron sash cramps are used to apply pressure to the  joint. As this method is in some cases apt to bend and distort thin  boards it is wise practice to fix (as a temporary measure) a stout piece  of straight wood on to the board to be joined by using two handscrews as  shown at the left hand of the illustration. At the right hand of the  sketch a wooden cramping arrangement of the box type is given, and by  wedging up the boards are closed together. It is obvious that if this  type of box cramp be used it will prevent the boards buckling and the  handscrew method at the left may be dispensed with.          THE HALVED JOINT      The halved joint is frequently known as half-lapping, and sometimes as  checking and half-checking. In the majority of cases it is made by  halving the two pieces, _i.e._, by cutting half the depth of the wood  away. There are, however, exceptions to this rule, as in the case of  \"three-piece halving\" (or, as it is sometimes called, \"third lapping\")  and in the halving of timber with rebated or moulded edges. Halving is  one of the simplest methods of connecting two pieces of timber,  especially where it is desired to make frames and bracket supports for  either inside or outside use.    [Illustration: Fig. 28.--Frame, with various halved joints. These joints,  numbered 1, 2, 3, etc., are shown in detail in Figs. 29 to 38.]    Fig. 28 shows the elevation of an imaginary frame which is indicated as  made up of a number of halving joints; it shows also the application of  the various joints to this class of work. Each joint used in the  construction of this frame may be dealt with separately. The numbers  marked on Fig. 28 refer to the individual joints, shown separately in  Figs. 29 to 38.    [Illustration: Fig. 29.--Halved Corner Joint.]    [Illustration: Fig. 30.--Halved T Joint.]    Fig. 29 shows the \"Halved Joint\" at the corner of the frame where the two  pieces form a right angle (see Fig. 28, 1). Each piece is halved and  shouldered at opposite sides, thus forming a perfect fit one with the  other and giving a strong joint with a minimum amount of labour. For  inside work the joint would be glued and screwed together, the screw  heads being countersunk so as not to come in contact with the cutting  iron of the plane when levelling off the work. For outside work, in  exposed positions where the work will have to withstand the weather, the  alternative method of smearing the joint with paint or with a mixture of  varnish and white lead would be advisable, the joint being nailed or  screwed. Fig. 29 shows the two pieces separated.    Fig. 30 shows a similar joint to the above, but in this case the top rail  runs through and it is generally spoken of as a \"Halved T Joint\" (Fig.  28, 2). It may be used in nearly all cases where a top or bottom rail  runs through an upright. The method of securing the joint is as before.  Fig. 30 shows a sketch of the joint separated.    [Illustration: Fig. 31.--Oblique Halving with Shoulder.]    [Illustration: Fig. 32.--Oblique Halving.]    At Fig. 31 is shown an \"Oblique Halving Joint,\" where the oblique piece,  or strut, does not run through (Fig. 28, 3). This type of joint is used  for strengthening framings and shelf brackets; an example of the latter  is shown at Fig. 48. A strut or rail of this type prevents movement or  distortion to a frame diagonally (generally spoken of in the trade as  \"racking\"). Fig. 31 shows the joint apart.    Fig. 32 is an example of Oblique Halving with the upper piece running  through (Fig. 28, 4). This joint is used in similar positions to Fig.  31, and has in some cases the disadvantage of showing end grain at the  top of the frame. The sketch shows the two pieces separated.    Fig. 33 is \"Dovetail Halving,\" the dovetail running through the top piece  (Fig. 28, 5). This is a strong joint, used where outside strain is likely  to occur in the top piece, the dovetail preventing the rail from being  drawn away from the shoulder. The two pieces are shown separate.    [Illustration: Fig. 33.--Dovetail Halving.]    [Illustration: Fig. 34.--Mitre Halving.]    At Fig. 34 is seen \"Mitred Halving,\" a somewhat weak joint, but necessary  in mirror frames, etc., where good appearance is required on the face  side (Fig. 28, 6). Its use is obvious if the face of the frame be moulded  with beads or other sections which require to intersect one with the  other. This also applies if the frame be moulded on its face edges.    Fig. 35 is a halved joint with one side of the piece dovetailed (Fig. 28,  8). This joint is "]]]
