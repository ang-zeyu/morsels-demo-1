The _Historia Animalium_ contains a description of the  form and structure of man and of as many animals as Aristotle was  acquainted with--and he was acquainted with an astonishingly large  number. The later _De Partibus Animalium_ is a treatise on the causes  of the form and structure of animals. Owing to the importance which  Aristotle ascribed to the final cause this work became really a  treatise on the functions of the parts, a discussion of the problems  of the relation of form to function, and the adaptedness of structure.    Aristotle was quite well aware that each of the big groups of animals  was built upon one plan of structure, which showed endless variations  \"in excess and defect\" in the different members of the group. But he  did not realise that this fact of community of plan constituted a  problem in itself. His interest was turned towards the functional side  of living things, form was for him a secondary result of function.    Yet he was not unaware of facts of form for which he could not quite  find a place in his theory of organic form, facts of form which were  not, at first sight at least, facts of function. Thus he was aware of  certain facts of \"correlation,\" which could not be explained off-hand  as due to correlation of the functions of the parts. He knew, for  instance, that all animals without front teeth in the upper jaw have  cotyledons, while most that have front teeth on both jaws and no horns  have no cotyledons (_De Gen._, ii. 7).    Speaking generally, however, we find in Aristotle no purely  morphological concepts. What then does morphology owe to Aristotle? It  owes to him, _first_, a great mass of facts about the structure of  animals; _second_, the first scientific classification of animals;[6]  _third_, a clear enunciation of the fact of community of plan within  each of the big groups; _fourth_, an attempt to explain certain  instances of the correlation of parts; _fifth_, a pregnant distinction  between homogeneous and heterogeneous parts; _sixth_, a generalisation  on the succession of forms in development; and _seventh_, the first  enunciation of the idea of the _Echelle des etres_.    (1) What surprises the modern reader of the _Historia Animalium_  perhaps more than anything else is the extent and variety of  Aristotle's knowledge of animals. He describes more than 500 kinds.[7]  Not only does he know the ordinary beasts, birds, and fishes with  which everyone is acquainted, but he knows a great deal about  cuttlefish, snails and oysters, about crabs, crawfish (_Palinurus_),  lobsters, shrimps, and hermit crabs, about sea-urchins and starfish,  sea-anemones and sponges, about ascidians (which seem to have puzzled  him not a little!). He has noticed even fish-lice and intestinal  worms, both flat and round. Of the smaller land animals, he knows a  great many insects and their larvae. The extent of his anatomical  knowledge is equally surprising, and much of it is clearly the result  of personal observation. No one can read his account of the internal  anatomy of the chameleon (_Hist. Anim._, ii.), or his description of  the structure of cuttlefish (_Hist. Anim._, iv), or that touch in the  description of the hermit crab (_Hist. Anim._, iv.)--\" Two large eyes  ... not ... turned on one side like those of crabs, but straight  forward\"--without being convinced that Aristotle is speaking of what  he has seen. Naturally he could not make much of the anatomy of small  insects and snails, and, to tell the truth, he does not seem to have  cared greatly about the minutiae of structure. He was too much of a  Greek and an aristocrat to care about laborious detail.    Not only did he lay a foundation for comparative anatomy, but he made  a real start with comparative embryology. Medical men before him had  known many facts about human development; Aristotle seems to have been  the first to study in any detail the development of the chick. He  describes this as it appears to the naked eye, the position of the  embryo on the yolk, the palpitating spot at the third day, the  formation of the body and of the large sightless eyes, the veins on  the yolk, the embryonic membranes, of which he distinguished two.    (2) Aristotle had various systems of classifying animals. They could  be classified, he thought, according to their structure, their manner  of reproduction, their manner of life, their mode of locomotion, their  food, and so on. Thus you might, in addition to structural  classifications, divide animals into gregarious, solitary and social,  or land animals into troglodytes, surface-dwellers, and burrowers  (_Hist. Anim._, i.).    He knew that dichotomous classifications were of little use for  animals (_De Partibus_, i. 3) and he explicitly and in so many words  accepted the principle of all \"natural\" classification, that  affinities must be judged by comparing not one but the sum total of  characters. As everyone knows, he was the first to distinguish the big  groups of animals, many of which were already distinguished roughly by  the common usages of speech. Among his Sanguinea he did little more  than define with greater exactitude the limits of the groups  established by the popular classification. Among the \"exsanguineous\"  animals, however, corresponding to our Invertebrates, he established a  much more definite classification than the popular, which is apt to  call them indiscriminately \"shellfish,\" \"insects,\" or \"creeping  things.\" He went beyond the superficialities of popular  classification, too, in clearly separating Cetacea from fishes. He had  some notion of species and genera in our sense. He distinguished many  species of cuttlefish--_Octopus (Polypus)_ of which there were many  kinds, _Eledone (Moschites)_ which he knew to have only one row of  suckers while _Octopus_ has two, _Argonauta, Nautilus, Sepia_, and  apparently _Loligo media_ (= his Teuthis) and _L. vulgaris_(or  _forbesii_) which seems to be his Teuthos. He had a grasp of the  principles which should be followed in judging of the natural  affinities of species. For example, he knew that the cuckoo resembles  a hawk. \"But,\" he says, \"the hawk has crooked talons, which the cuckoo  has not, nor does it resemble the hawk in the form of its head, but in  these respects is more like the pigeon than the hawk, which it  resembles in nothing but its colour; the markings, however, upon the  hawk are like lines, while the cuckoo is spotted\" (_Hist. Anim._,  Cresswell's trans., p. 147, London, 1862).    The groups he distinguished were--man, viviparous quadrupeds,  oviparous quadrupeds, birds, fishes, Cetacea, Cephalopoda,  Malacostraca (= higher Crustacea), Insecta (= annulose animals),  Testacea (= molluscs, echinoderms, ascidians). A class of Acalephae,  including sea-anemones and sponges, was grouped with the Testacea. The  first five groups were classed together as sanguineous, the others as  exsanguineous, from the presence or absence of red blood.    Besides these classes \"there are,\" he says, \"many other creatures in  the sea which it is not possible to arrange in any class from their  scarcity\" (Creswell, _loc. cit._, p. 90).    (3) Aristotle's greatest service to morphology is his clear  recognition of the unity of plan holding throughout each of the great  groups.    He recognises this most clearly in the case of man and the viviparous  quadrupeds, with whose structure he was best acquainted. In the  _Historia Animalium_ he takes man as a standard, and describes his  external and internal parts in detail, then considers viviparous  quadrupeds and compares them with man. \"Whatever parts a man has  before, a quadruped has beneath; those that are behind in man form the  quadruped's back\" (Cresswell, _loc. cit._, p. 26). Apes, monkeys, and  Cynocephali combine the characteristics of man and quadrupeds. He  notices that all viviparous quadrupeds have hair. Oviparous quadrupeds  resemble the viviparous, but they lack some organs, such as ears with  an external pinna, mammae, hair. Oviparous bipeds, or birds, also \"have  many parts like the animals described above.\" He does not, however,  seem to realise that a bird's wings are the equivalent of a mammal's  arms or fore-legs. Fishes are much more divergent; they possess no  neck, nor limbs, nor testicles (meaning a solid ovoid body such as the  testis in mammals), nor mammae. Instead of hair they have scales.    Speaking generally, the Sanguinea differ from man and from one another  in their parts, which may be present or absent, or exhibit differences  in \"excess and defect,\" or in form. Unity of plan extends to all the  principal systems of organs. \"All sanguineous animals have either a  bony or a spinous column. The remainder of the bones exist in some  animals; but not in others, for if they have the limbs they have the  bones belonging to them\" (Cresswell, _loc. cit._, p. 60). \"Viviparous  animals with blood and feet do not differ much in their bones, but  rather by analogy, in hardness, softness, and size\" (Cresswell, _loc.  cit._, p. 59). The venous system, too, is built upon the same general  plan throughout the Sanguinea. \"In all sanguineous animals, the nature  and origin of the principal veins are the same, but the multitude of  smaller veins is not alike in all, for neither are the parts of the  same nature, nor do all possess the same parts\" (Cresswell, _loc.  cit._, p. 56). It will be noticed in the first and last of these three  quotations that Aristotle recognises the fact of correlation between  systems of organs,--between limbs and bones, and between blood-vessels  and the parts to which they go.    Sanguineous animals all possess certain organs--heart, liver, spleen,  kidneys, and so on. Other organs occur in most of the classes--the  oesophagus and the lungs. \"The position which these parts occupy is  the same in all animals [sc. Sanguinea]\" (Cresswell, _loc. cit._, p.  39).

[Illustration]    But the good Fairy protected them, and after floating at sea for seven  days they were picked up by a Corsair. He was so struck by their beauty  that he altered his course, and took them home to his wife, who had no  children. She was transported with joy when he placed them in her hands.  They admired together the wonderful stars, the chains of gold that could  not be taken off their necks, and their long ringlets. Much greater was  the woman's astonishment when she combed them, for at every instant  there rolled out of their hair pearls, rubies, diamonds, and emeralds.  She told her husband of it, who was not less surprised than herself.    \"I am very tired,\" said he, \"of a Corsair's life, and if the locks of  those little children continue to supply us with such treasures, I will  give up roaming the seas.\" The Corsair's wife, whose name was Corsine,  was enchanted at this, and loved the four infants so much the more for  it. She named the Princess, Belle-Etoile, her eldest brother,  Petit-Soleil, the second, Heureux, and the son of Brunette, Cheri.    As they grew older, the Corsair applied himself seriously to their  education, as he felt convinced there was some great mystery attached  to their birth.    The Corsair and his wife had never told the story of the four children,  who passed for their own. They were exceedingly united, but Prince Cheri  entertained for Princess Belle-Etoile a greater affection than the other  two. The moment she expressed a wish for anything, he would attempt even  impossibilities to gratify her.    One day Belle-Etoile overheard the Corsair and his wife talking. \"When I  fell in with them,\" said the Corsair, \"I saw nothing that could give me  any idea of their birth.\" \"I suspect,\" said Corsine, \"that Cheri is not  their brother, he has neither star nor neck-chain.\" Belle-Etoile  immediately ran and told this to the three Princes, who resolved to  speak to the Corsair and his wife, and ask them to let them set out to  discover the secret of their birth. After some remonstrance they gained  their consent. A beautiful vessel was prepared, and the young Princess  and the three Princes set out. They determined to sail to the very spot  where the Corsair had found them, and made preparations for a grand  sacrifice to the fairies, for their protection and guidance. They were  about to immolate a turtle-dove, but the Princess saved its life, and  let it fly. At this moment a syren issued from the water, and said,  \"Cease your anxiety, let your vessel go where it will; land where it  stops.\" The vessel now sailed more quickly. Suddenly they came in sight  of a city so beautiful that they were anxious their vessel should enter  the port. Their wishes were accomplished; they landed, and the shore in  a moment was crowded with people, who had observed the magnificence of  their ship. They ran and told the King the news, and as the grand  terrace of the Palace looked out upon the sea-shore, he speedily  repaired thither. The Princes, hearing the people say, \"There is the  King,\" looked up, and made a profound obeisance. He looked earnestly at  them, and was as much charmed by the Princess's beauty, as by the  handsome mien of the young Princes. He ordered his equerry to offer them  his protection, and everything that they might require.    [Illustration]    The King was so interested about these four children, that he went into  the chamber of the Queen, his mother, to tell her of the wonderful stars  which shone upon their foreheads, and everything that he admired in  them. She was thunderstruck at it, and was terribly afraid that Feintise  had betrayed her, and sent her secretary to enquire about them. What he  told her of their ages confirmed her suspicions. She sent for Feintise,  and threatened to kill her. Feintise, half dead with terror, confessed  all; but promised, if she spared her, that she would still find means to  do away with them. The Queen was appeased; and, indeed, old Feintise did  all she could for her own sake. Taking a guitar, she went and sat down  opposite the Princess's window, and sang a song which Belle-Etoile  thought so pretty that she invited her into her chamber. \"My fair  child,\" said Feintise, \"Heaven has made you very lovely, but you yet  want one thing--the dancing-water. If I had possessed it, you would not  have seen a white hair upon my head, nor a wrinkle on my face. Alas! I  knew this secret too late; my charms had already faded.\" \"But where  shall I find this dancing-water?\" asked Belle-Etoile. \"It is in the  luminous forest,\" said Feintise. \"You have three brothers; does not any  one of them love you sufficiently to go and fetch some?\" \"My brothers  all love me,\" said the Princess, \"but there is one of them who would not  refuse me anything.\" The perfidious old woman retired, delighted at  having been so successful. The Princes, returning from the chase, found  Belle-Etoile engrossed by the advice of Feintise. Her anxiety about it  was so apparent, that Cheri, who thought of nothing but pleasing her,  soon found out the cause of it, and, in spite of her entreaties, he  mounted his white horse, and set out in search of the dancing-water.  When supper-time arrived, and the Princess did not see her brother  Cheri, she could neither eat nor drink; and desired he might be sought  for everywhere, and sent messengers to find him and bring him back.    [Illustration]    The wicked Feintise was very anxious to know the result of her advice;  and when she heard that Cheri had already set out, she was delighted,  and reported to the Queen-Mother all that had passed. \"I admit, Madam,\"  said she, \"that I can no longer doubt that they are the same four  children: but one of the Princes is already gone to seek the  dancing-water, and will no doubt perish in the attempt, and I  shall find similar means to do away with all of them.\"    The plan she had adopted with regard to Prince Cheri was one of the most  certain, for the dancing-water was not easily to be obtained; it was so  notorious from the misfortunes which occurred to all who sought it, that  every one knew the road to it. He was eight days without taking any  repose but in the woods. At the end of this period he began to suffer  very much from the heat; but it was not the heat of the sun, and he did  not know the cause of it, until from the top of a mountain he perceived  the luminous forest; all the trees were burning without being consumed,  and casting out flames to such a distance that the country around was a  dry desert.    At this terrible scene he descended, and more than once gave himself up  for lost. As he approached this great fire he was ready to die with  thirst; and perceiving a spring falling into a marble basin, he alighted  from his horse, approached it, and stooped to take up some water in the  little golden vase which he had brought with him, when he saw a  turtle-dove drowning in the fountain. Cheri took pity on it, and saved  it. \"My Lord Cheri,\" she said, \"I am not ungrateful; I can guide you to  the dancing-water, which, without me, you could never obtain, as it  rises in the middle of the forest, and can only be reached by going  underground.\" The Dove then flew away, and summoned a number of foxes,  badgers, moles, snails, ants, and all sorts of creatures that burrow in  the earth. Cheri got off his horse at the entrance of the subterranean  passage they made for him, and groped his way after the kind Dove, which  safely conducted him to the fountain. The Prince filled his golden vase;  and returned the same way he came.    He found Belle-Etoile sorrowfully seated under some trees, but when she  saw him she was so pleased that she scarcely knew how to welcome him.    Old Feintise learned from her spies that Cheri had returned, and that  the Princess, having washed her face with the dancing-water, had become  more lovely than ever. Finding this, she lost no time in artfully making  the Princess sigh for the wonderful singing-apple. Prince Cheri again  found her unhappy, and again found out the cause, and once more set out  on his white horse, leaving a letter for Belle-Etoile.    [Illustration]    In the meanwhile, the King did not forget the lovely children, and  reproached them for never going to the Palace. They excused themselves  by saying that their brother's absence prevented them.    Prince Cheri at break of day perceived a handsome young man, from whom  he learned where the singing-apple was to be found: but after travelling  some time without seeing any sign of it, he saw a poor turtle-dove fall  at his feet almost dead. He took pity on it, and restored it, when it  said, \"Good-day, handsome Cheri, you are destined to save my life, and I  to do you signal service. You are come to seek for the singing-apple: it  is guarded by a terrible dragon.\" The Dove then led him to a place where  he found a suit of armour, all of glass: and by her advice he put it on,  and boldly went to meet the dragon. The two-headed monster came bounding  along, fire issuing from his throat; but when he saw his alarming figure  multiplied in the Prince's mirrors he was frightened in his turn. He  stopped, and looking fiercely at the Prince, apparently laden with  dragons, he took flight and threw himself into a deep chasm. The Prince  then found the tree, which was surrounded with human bones, and breaking  off an apple, prepared to return to the Princess. She had never slept  during his absence, and ran to meet him eagerly.    When the wicked Feintise heard the sweet singing of the apple, her grief  was excessive, for instead of doing harm to these lovely children, she  only did them good by her perfidious counsels. She"]]]
