He has just been cunning enough to know what graft is  and where it is, but he has no vision. You know this is a great  throbbing world that speaks out in all directions. Look at Rockefeller.  Every move he makes hastens the coming of his doom. Every time the  capitalist class tries to hinder the cause of Socialism they hurt  themselves. Every time they strangle a Socialist newspaper they add a  thousand voices to those which are aiding Socialism. The Socialist has a  great idea. An expanding philosophy. It is spreading over the face of  the earth. It is as useless to resist it as it is to resist the rising  sun. Can you see it? If you cannot you are lacking in vision, in  understanding. What a privilege it is to serve it. I have regretted a  thousand times I can do so little for the movement that has done so much  for me. The little that I am, the little that I am hoping to be, is due  wholly to the Socialist movement. It gave me my ideas and my ideals, and  I would not exchange one of them for all the Rockefeller blood-stained  dollars. It taught me how to serve; a lesson to me of priceless value.  It taught the ecstasy of the handclasp of the comrade. It made it  possible for me to get in touch with you, to multiply myself over and  over again; to open the avenue, to spread out the glorious vistas; to  know that I am kin with all that throbs; with all who become class  conscious. Every man who toils, everyone of them, is my comrade. To  serve them is the highest duty of my life. And in the service I can feel  myself expanding. I rise to the stature of a man. Yes, my heart is  attuned to yours. All of our hearts are melted into one great heart  which throbs to the response of the people.    \"Here I hear your heart beats responsive to the Bolsheviki of Russia.  (Applause) Yes, those heroic men and women, those unconquerable  comrades, who have by their sacrifice added fresh lustre to the  international movement. Those Russian comrades who have made greater  sacrifices, who have suffered more, who have shed more heroic blood than  any like number of men and women anywhere else on earth. They have led  the first real convention of any democracy that ever drew breath. The  first act of that memorable revolution was to proclaim a state of peace  with an appeal not to the kings, not to the rulers, but an appeal to the  people of all nations. They are the very breath of democracy; the  quintessence of freedom. They made their appeal to the people of all  nations, the Allies as well as the Central Powers, to send  representatives to lay down terms of a peace that should be lasting.  Here was a fine opportunity to strike a blow to make democracy safe to  the world. Was there any response to that noble appeal? And here let me  say that appeal will be written in letters of gold in the history of the  world. While it has been charged that the leaders made a traitorous  peace with Germany, let us consider this proposition briefly. At the  time of the revolution, Russia had lost 4,000,000 of her soldiers. She  was absolutely bankrupt. Her soldiers were without arms. This was what  was bequeathed to the revolution by the Czar. For this condition, Leon  Trotsky was not responsible nor was the Bolshevik movement, but the Czar  was.    \"When Leon Trotsky came into power, he found the secret treaties made  between the French government and the British government and the Italian  government which was to divide the territory of the Central Powers if  the Allies were victorious, and these secret treaties have not been  repudiated up to this time. Very little has been said about them in the  American newspapers. This shows that the purpose of the Allies is  exactly the purpose of the Central Powers.    \"Wars have been waged for conquests, for plunder, and since the feudal  ages, the feudal lords along the Rhine made war upon each other. They  wanted to enlarge their domains, to increase their power and their  wealth and so they declared war upon each other. But they did not go to  war any more than the Wall Street Junkers go to war. Their predecessors  declared the wars, but their miserable serfs fought the wars. The serfs  believed that it was their patriotic duty to fall upon one another, to  wage war upon one another. And that is war in a nut shell. The master  class has always brought a war, and the subject class has fought the  battle. The master class has had all to gain and nothing to lose, and  the subject class has had all to lose and nothing to gain. They have  always taught you that it is your patriotic duty to go to war and  slaughter yourselves at their command. You have never had a voice in the  war. The working class who made the sacrifices, who shed the blood, have  never yet had a voice in declaring war. The ruling class has always made  the war and made the peace.         \"Yours not to question why,        Yours but to do and die.    \"Another bit of history I want to review is that of Rose Pastor Stokes,  another inspiring comrade. She had her millions of dollars. Her devotion  to the cause is without all consideration of a financial or economic  view. She went out to render service to the cause and they sent her to  the penitentiary for ten years. What has she said? Nothing more than I  have said here this afternoon. I want to say that if Rose Pastor Stokes  is guilty, so am I. If she should be sent to the penitentiary for ten  years, so ought I. What did she say? She said that a government could  not serve both the profiteers and the employees of the profiteers.  Roosevelt has said a thousand times more in his paper, the _Kansas City  Star_. He would do everything possible to discredit Wilson's  administration in order to give his party credit. The Republican and  Democratic parties are all patriots this fall and they are going to  combine to prevent the election of any disloyal Socialists. Do you know  of any difference between them? One is in, the other is out. That is all  the difference.    \"Rose Pastor Stokes never said a word she did not have a right to utter,  but her message opened the eyes of the people. That must be suppressed.  That voice must be silenced. Her trial in a capitalist court was very  farcical. What chance had she in a corporation court with a put-up jury  and a corporation tool on the bench?    \"Every Socialist on the face of the earth is animated by the same  principles. Everywhere they have the same noble idea, everywhere they  are calling one another 'comrade,' the noblest word that springs from  the heart and soul of unity. The word 'comrade' is getting us into  closer touch all along the battle line. They are waging the war of the  working class against the ruling class of the world. They conquer  difficulties; they grow stronger through them all.    \"The heart of the international Socialist never beats a retreat. They  are pressing forward here, there, everywhere, in all the zones that  girdle this globe. These workers, these class-conscious workers, these  children of honest toil are wiping out the boundary lines everywhere.  They are proclaiming the glad tidings of the coming emancipation.  Everywhere they are having their hearts attuned to the sacred cause;  everywhere they are moving toward democracy, moving toward the sunrise,  their faces aglow with the light of coming day. These are the men who  must guide us in the greatest crisis the world has ever known. They are  making history. They are bound upon the emancipation of the human race.    \"Few men have the courage to say a decent word in favor of the I. W. W.  I have. (Here several in the crowd yelled, 'So have I.')    \"After long investigation by five men who are not Socialists: John  Graham Brooks, Harvard University; Mr. Bruere, Government investigator  (other names not noted), a pamphlet has been issued called 'The Truth  About the I.

The press and the pulpit have in every age and every  nation been on the side of the exploiting class and the ruling class.  That's why the I. W. W. is infamous.    \"The I. W. W. in its career has never committed as much violence against  the ruling class as the ruling class has committed against the people.  The trial at Chicago is now on and they have not proven violence in a  single solitary case, and yet, one hundred and twelve have been on trial  for months and months without a shade of evidence.

That orthodox Jews at that period may have  found, in consequence of this monotheistic tendency, converts, is not  by any means improbable--indeed, the names met with during the later  period imply that converts to Judaism were made.                       The picture presented by the study.    Thus we see, from the various inscriptions, both Babylonian and  Assyrian--the former of an extremely early period--the growth and  development, with at least one branching off, of one of the most  important religious systems of the ancient world. It is not so  important for modern religion as the development of the beliefs of the  Hebrews, but as the creed of the people from which the Hebrew nation  sprang, and from which, therefore, it had its beginnings, both  corporeal and spiritual, it is such as no student of modern religious  systems can afford to neglect. Its legends, and therefore its  teachings, as will be seen in these pages, ultimately permeated the  Semitic West, and may in some cases even had penetrated Europe, not  only through heathen Greece, but also through the early Christians,  who, being so many centuries nearer the time of the  Assyro-Babylonians, and also nearer the territory which they anciently  occupied, than we are, were far better acquainted than the people of  the present day with the legends and ideas which they possessed.                                      CHAPTER II                THE RELIGION OF THE BABYLONIANS AND ASSYRIANS                      The Sumero-Akkadians and the Semites.    For the history of the development of the religion of the Babylonians  and Assyrians much naturally depends upon the composition of the  population of early Babylonia. There is hardly any doubt that the  Sumero-Akkadians were non-Semites of a fairly pure race, but the  country of their origin is still unknown, though a certain  relationship with the Mongolian and Turkish nationalities, probably  reaching back many centuries--perhaps thousands of years--before the  earliest accepted date, may be regarded as equally likely. Equally  uncertain is the date of the entry of the Semites, whose language  ultimately displaced the non-Semitic Sumero-Akkadian idioms, and  whose kings finally ruled over the land. During the third millennium  before Christ Semites, bearing Semitic names, and called Amorites,  appear, and probably formed the last considerable stratum of tribes of  that race which entered the land. The name Martu, the Sumero-Akkadian  equivalent of Amurru, \"Amorite\", is of frequent occurrence also before  this period. The eastern Mediterranean coast district, including  Palestine and the neighbouring tracts, was known by the Babylonians  and Assyrians as the land of the Amorites, a term which stood for the  West in general even when these regions no longer bore that name. The  Babylonians maintained their claim to sovereignty over that part as  long as they possessed the power to do so, and naturally exercised  considerable influence there. The existence in Palestine, Syria, and  the neighbouring states, of creeds containing the names of many  Babylonian divinities is therefore not to be wondered at, and the  presence of West Semitic divinities in the religion of the Babylonians  need not cause us any surprise.                     The Babylonian script and its evidence.    In consequence of the determinative prefix for a god or a goddess  being, in the oldest form, a picture of an eight-rayed star, it has  been assumed that Assyro-Babylonian mythology is, either wholly or  partly, astral in origin. This, however, is by no means certain, the  character for \"star\" in the inscriptions being a combination of three  such pictures, and not a single sign. The probability therefore is,  that the use of the single star to indicate the name of a divinity  arises merely from the fact that the character in question stands for  /ana/, \"heaven.\" Deities were evidently thus distinguished by the  Babylonians because they regarded them as inhabitants of the realms  above--indeed, the heavens being the place where the stars are seen, a  picture of a star was the only way of indicating heavenly things. That  the gods of the Babylonians were in many cases identified with the  stars and planets is certain, but these identifications seem to have  taken place at a comparatively late date. An exception has naturally  to be made in the case of the sun and moon, but the god Merodach, if  he be, as seems certain, a deified Babylonian king, must have been  identified with the stars which bear his name after his worshippers  began to pay him divine honours as the supreme deity, and naturally  what is true for him may also be so for the other gods whom they  worshipped. The identification of some of the deities with stars or  planets is, moreover, impossible, and if Ea, the god of the deep, and  Anu, the god of the heavens, have their representatives among the  heavenly bodies, this is probably the result of later development.[1]    [1] If there be any historical foundation for the statement that      Merodach arranged the sun, the moon, the planets, and the stars,      assigning to them their proper places and duties--a tradition      which would make him the founder of the science of astronomy      during his life upon earth--this, too, would tend to the      probability that the origin of the gods of the Babylonians was not      astral, as has been suggested, but that their identification with      the heavenly bodies was introduced during the period of his reign.               Ancestor and hero-worship. The deification of kings.    Though there is no proof that ancestor-worship in general prevailed at  any time in Babylonia, it would seem that the worship of heroes and  prominent men was common, at least in early times. The tenth chapter  of Genesis tells us of the story of Nimrod, who cannot be any other  than the Merodach of the Assyro-Babylonian inscriptions; and other  examples, occurring in semi-mythological times, are /En-we-dur-an-ki/,  the Greek Edoreschos, and /Gilgames/, the Greek Gilgamos, though  Aelian's story of the latter does not fit in with the account as given  by the inscriptions. In later times, the divine prefix is found before  the names of many a Babylonian ruler--Sargon of Agade,[1] Dungi of Ur  (about 2500 B.C.), Rim-Sin or Eri-Aku (Arioch of Ellasar, about 2100  B.C.), and others. It was doubtless a kind of flattery to deify and  pay these rulers divine honours during their lifetime, and on account  of this, it is very probable that their godhood was utterly forgotten,  in the case of those who were strictly historical, after their death.  The deification of the kings of Babylonia and Assyria is probably due  to the fact, that they were regarded as the representatives of God  upon earth, and being his chief priests as well as his offspring (the  personal names show that it was a common thing to regard children as  the gifts of the gods whom their father worshipped), the divine  fatherhood thus attributed to them naturally could, in the case of  those of royal rank, give them a real claim to divine birth and  honours. An exception is the deification of the Babylonian Noah,  Ut-napistim, who, as the legend of the Flood relates, was raised and  made one of the gods by Aa or Ea, for his faithfulness after the great  catastrophe, when he and his wife were translated to the \"remote place  at the mouth of the rivers.\" The hero Gilgames, on the other hand, was  half divine by birth, though it is not exactly known through whom his  divinity came.    [1] According to Nabonidus's date 3800 B.C., though many      Assyriologists regard this as being a millennium too early.                  The earliest form of the Babylonian religion.    The state of development to which the religious system of the  Babylonians had attained at the earliest period to which the  inscriptions refer naturally precludes the possibility of a  trustworthy history of its origin and early growth. There is no doubt,  however, that it may be regarded as having reached the stage at which  we find it in consequence of there being a number of states in ancient  Babylonia (which was at that time like the Heptarchy in England) each  possessing its own divinity--who, in its district, was regarded as  supreme--with a number of lesser gods forming his court. It was the  adding together of all these small pantheons which ultimately made  that of Babylonia as a whole so exceedingly extensive. Thus the chief  divinity of Babylon, as has already been stated, as Merodach; at  Sippar and Larsa the sun-god Samas was worshipped; at Ur the moon-god  Sin or Nannar; at Erech and Der the god of the heavens, Anu; at Muru,  Ennigi, and Kakru, the god of the atmosphere, Hadad or Rimmon; at  Eridu, the god of the deep, Aa or Ea; at Niffur[1] the god Bel; at  Cuthah the god of war, Nergal; at Dailem the god Uras; at Kis the god  of battle, Zagaga; Lugal-Amarda, the king of Marad, as the city so  called; at Opis Zakar, one of the gods of dreams; at Agade, Nineveh,  and Arbela, Istar, goddess of love and of war; Nina at the city Nina  in Babylonia, etc. When the chief deities were masculine, they were  naturally all identified with each other, just as the Greeks called  the Babylonian Merodach by the name of Zeus; and as Zer-panitum, the  consort of Merodach, was identified with Juno, so the consorts, divine  attendants, and children of each chief divinity, as far as they  possessed them, could also be regarded as the same, though possibly  distinct in their different attributes.
