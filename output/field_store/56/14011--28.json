[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19713"],[0,"The Laughing Prince: Jugoslav Folk and Fairy Tales (#2)"],[1,"a  great Tsar who had an only daughter. In disappointment that he had no  son, the Tsar was having his daughter brought up as though she were a  boy. He sent all over the world for tutors and teachers and had the poor  girl taught statecraft and law and philosophy and all the other things  that the heir to the throne ought to know.    The Princess because she was an obedient girl and because she loved her  father tried to spend all her time in study. But the dry old scholars  whom the Tsar employed as teachers were not amusing companions for a  young girl and the first lady-in-waiting who was in constant attendance  was scarcely any better for she, too, was old and thin and very prim.    If the poor little Princess between her geography lesson and her  arithmetic lesson would peep for a moment into a mirror, the first  lady-in-waiting would tap her arm reprovingly and say:    \"My dear, vanity is not becoming in a princess!\"    One day the little Princess lost her temper and answered sharply:    \"But I'm a girl even if I am a princess and I love to look in mirrors  and I love to make myself pretty and I'd love to go to a ball every  night of my life and dance with handsome young men!\"    \"You talk like the daughter of a farmer!\" the first lady-in-waiting  said.    Then the Princess, because she lost her temper still further, said  something she should not have said.    \"I wish I were the daughter of a farmer!\" she declared. \"Then I could  wear pretty ribbons and go dancing and the boys would come courting me!  As it is I have to spend all my time with funny old men and silly old  women!\"    Now even if her tutors and teachers were funny looking old men, even if  the first lady-in-waiting was a silly old woman, the Princess should not  have said so. It hurt the feelings of the first lady-in-waiting and made  her angry and she ran off to the Tsar at once and complained most  bitterly.    \"Is this my reward after all my years of loving service to your  daughter?\" she asked. \"It is true that I've grown old and thin looking  after her manners and now she calls me a silly old woman! And all the  learned wise men and scholars that you have gathered from the far  corners of the earth--she points her finger at them and calls them funny  old men!\"    The fact is they were funny looking, most of them, but yet the first  lady-in-waiting was right: the Princess should not have said so.    \"And think of her ingratitude to yourself, O Tsar!\" the first  lady-in-waiting continued. \"You plan to make her the heir to your throne  and yet she says she wishes she were a farmer's daughter so that she  could deck herself out in ribbons and have the boys come courting her! A  nice thing for a princess to say!\"    The Tsar when he heard this fell into an awful rage. (The truth is  whatever temper the Princess had she inherited direct from her father.)    \"Wow! Wow!\" he roared, just that way. \"Send the Princess to me at once.  I'll soon have her singing another tune!\"    So the first lady-in-waiting sent the Princess to her father and as soon  as he saw her he began roaring again and saying:    \"Wow! Wow! What do you mean--funny old men and silly old women?\"    Now whenever the Tsar began roaring and saying, \"Wow! Wow!\" the Princess  always stiffened, and instead of being the sweet and obedient daughter  she usually was she became obstinate. Her pretty eyes would flash and  her soft pretty face would harden and people would whisper: \"Mercy on  us, how much she looks like her father!\"    \"That's just what I mean!\" the Princess said. \"They're a lot of funny  old men and silly old women and I'm tired of them! I want to be amused!  I want to laugh!\"    \"Wow! Wow! Wow!\" roared the Tsar. \"A fine princess you are! Go straight  back to the schoolroom and behave yourself!\"    So the little Princess marched out of the throne room holding her head  very high and looking so much like the Tsar that the first  lady-in-waiting was positively frightened.    The Princess went back to the schoolroom but she did not behave herself.  She was really very naughty. When the poor man who knew more than  anybody in the world about the influence of the stars upon the destinies  of nations came to give her a lesson, she threw his book out the window.  When the superannuated old general who was teaching her military  manoeuvers offered her a diagram on which the enemy was represented by  a series of black dots and our soldiers by a series of red dots, she  took the paper and tore it in two. And worst of all when the old scholar  who was teaching her Turkish--for a princess must be able to speak all  languages--dropped his horn spectacles on the floor, she deliberately  stepped on them and broke them.    When the Tsar heard all these things he just _wow-wowed_ something  terrible.    \"Lock that young woman in her chamber!\" he ordered. \"Feed her on bread  and water until she's ready to apologize!\"    But the Princess, far from being frightened by this treatment, calmly  announced:    \"I won't eat even your old bread and water until you send me some one  who will make me laugh!\"    Now this frightened the Tsar because he knew how obstinate the Princess  could be on occasions. (He ought to know, too, for the Princess had that  streak of obstinacy direct from himself.)    \"This will never do!\" he said.    He hurried to the Princess's chamber. He found her in bed with her  pretty hair spread out on the pillow like a golden fan.    \"My dear,\" the Tsar said, \"I was joking. You don't have to eat only  bread and water. You may have anything you want.\"    \"Thank you,\" the Princess said, \"but I'll never eat another bite of  anything until you send me some one who will make me laugh. I'm tired of  living in this gloomy old castle with a lot of old men and old women who  do nothing but instruct me and with a father who always loses his  temper and says, 'Wow! Wow!'\"    \"But it's a beautiful castle!\" the poor Tsar said. \"And I'm sure we're  all doing our very best to educate you!\"    \"But I want to be amused as well as educated!\" the little Princess said.  And then, because she felt she was going to cry, she turned her face to  the wall and wouldn't say another word.    What was the Tsar to do? He called together his councilors and asked  them how was the Princess to be made to laugh. The councilors were wise  about state matters but not one of them could suggest a means of amusing  the Princess. The Master of Ceremonies did indeed begin to say something  about a nice young man but instantly the Tsar roared out such a  wrathful, \"Wow! Wow!\" that the Master of Ceremonies coughed and  pretended he hadn't spoken.    Then the Tsar called together the scholars and the teachers and the  first lady-in-waiting. He glared at them savagely and roared:    \"Wow! Wow! A nice lot you are! I put you in charge of my daughter and  not one of you has sense enough to know that the poor child needs a  little amusement! I have a good mind to have you all thrown into the  dungeon!\"    \"But, Your Majesty,\" quavered one poor old scholar, \"I was not employed  as a buffoon but as a teacher of astrology!\"    \"And I,\" another said, \"as a teacher of languages!\"    \"And I as a teacher of philosophy!\"    \"Silence!\" roared the Tsar. \"Between you all you have about killed my  poor child! Now I ask you: With all your learning doesn't one of you  know how to make a young girl laugh?\"    Apparently not one of them did, for no one answered.    \"Not even you?\" the Tsar said, looking at the first lady-in-waiting.    \"When you called me to Court,\" the first lady-in-waiting answered,  drawing herself up in a most refined manner, \"you said you wished me to  teach your daughter etiquette. As you said nothing about amusement,  quite naturally I confined myself to the subject of behavior. If I do  say it myself, no one has ever been more devoted to duty than I. I am  constantly saying to her: 'That isn't the way a princess should act!' In  fact for years there has hardly been a moment in the day when I haven't  corrected her for something!\"    \"Poor child!\" groaned the Tsar. \"No wonder she wants a change! Oh, what  fools you all are in spite of your learning! Don't you know that a young  girl is a young girl even if she is a Princess!\"    Well, the scholars weren't any more help to the Tsar than the  councilors, and finally in desperation he sent heralds through the land  to announce that to any one who could make the Princess laugh he would  give three bags of gold.    Three bags of gold don't grow on the bushes every day and instantly all  the youths and men and old men who had stories that their sweethearts  and their wives and their daughters laughed at hurried to the castle.    One by one they were admitted to the Princess's chamber. They entered  hopefully but when they saw the Tsar sitting at one side of the door  muttering, \"Wow! Wow!\" in his beard, and the old first lady-in-waiting  at the other side of the door watching them scornfully, and the Princess  herself in bed with her lovely hair spread out like a golden fan on the  pillow, they forgot their funny stories and hemmed and hawed and  stammered and had finally, one after another, to be turned out in  disgrace.    One day went by and two and three and still the Princess refused to eat.  In despair the Tsar sent out his heralds again. This time he said that  to any one who would make the Princess laugh he would give the  Princess's hand in marriage and make him joint heir to the kingdom.    \"I had expected to wed her to the son of some great Tsar,\" he sighed,  \"but I'd rather marry her to a farmer than see her die of starvation!\"    The heralds rode far and wide until every one, even the people on the  most distant farms, had heard of the Tsar's offer.    \"I won't try again,\" said Mihailo, the oldest son of the farmer I've  already told you about. \"When I went there the day before yesterday I  began telling her a funny story out of my Latin book but"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19714"],[0,"With Frederick the Great: A Story of the Seven Years' War (#2)"],[1,"abroad that news of us must often come home.  However, from time to time I will write to you. Do not expect to  hear too often, for I spend far more time in the saddle than at my  table, and my fingers are more accustomed to grasp a sword than a  pen. However, be sure that wherever I may be, I shall be glad to  see your son, and to do my best for him.    \"See that he is not brought up at your apron string, but is well  trained in all exercises; for we Scots have gained a great name for  strength and muscle, and I would not that one of my kin should fall  short of the mark.\"    Maggie Drummond had been much pleased with her kinsman's letter.  There were few Scotchmen who stood higher in the regard of their  countrymen, and the two Keiths had also a European reputation. Her  husband, and many other fiery spirits, had expressed surprise and  even indignation that the brothers, who had taken so prominent a  part in the first rising, should not have hastened to join Prince  Charlie; but the more thoughtful men felt it was a bad omen that  they did not do so. It was certainly not from any want of  adventurous spirit, or of courage, for wherever adventures were to  be obtained, wherever blows were most plentiful, James Keith and  his brother were certain to be in the midst of them.    But Maggie Drummond knew the reason for their holding aloof; for  she had, shortly before the coming over of Prince Charlie, received  a short note from the field marshal:    \"They say that Prince Charles Edward is meditating a mad scheme of  crossing to Scotland, and raising his standard there. If so, do  what you can to prevent your husband from joining him. We made but  a poor hand of it, last time; and the chances of success are vastly  smaller now. Then it was but a comparatively short time since the  Stuarts had lost the throne of England, and there were great  numbers who wished them back. Now the Hanoverian is very much more  firmly seated on the throne. The present man has a considerable  army, and the troops have had experience of war on the Continent,  and have shown themselves rare soldiers. Were not my brother Lord  Marischal of Scotland, and my name somewhat widely known, I should  not hang back from the adventure, however desperate; but our  example might lead many who might otherwise stand aloof to take up  arms, which would bring, I think, sure destruction upon them.  Therefore we shall restrain our own inclinations, and shall watch  what I feel sure will be a terrible tragedy, from a distance;  striking perhaps somewhat heavier blows than usual upon the heads  of Turks, Moors, Frenchmen, and others, to make up for our not  being able to use our swords where our inclinations would lead us.    \"The King of France will assuredly give no efficient aid to the  Stuarts. He has all along used them as puppets, by whose means he  can, when he chooses, annoy or coerce England. But I have no belief  that he will render any useful aid, either now or hereafter.    \"Use then, cousin, all your influence to keep Drummond at home.  Knowing him as I do, I have no great hope that it will avail; for I  know that he is Jacobite to the backbone, and that, if the Prince  lands, he will be one of the first to join him.\"    Maggie had not carried out Keith's injunction. She had indeed told  her husband, when she received the letter, that Keith believed the  enterprise to be so hopeless a one that he should not join in it.  But she was as ardent in the cause of the Stuarts as was her  husband, and said no single word to deter him when, an hour after  he heard the news of the prince's landing, he mounted and rode off  to meet him, and to assure him that he would bring every man of his  following to the spot where his adherents were to assemble. From  time to time his widow had continued to write to Keith; though,  owing to his being continually engaged on campaigns against the  Turks and Tartars, he received but two or three of her letters, so  long as he remained in the service of Russia. When, however, he  displeased the Empress Elizabeth, and at once left the service and  entered that of Prussia, her letters again reached him.    The connection between France and Scotland had always been close,  and French was a language familiar to most of the upper class; and  since the civil troubles began, such numbers of Scottish gentlemen  were forced either to shelter in France, or to take service in the  French or other foreign armies, that a knowledge of the language  became almost a matter of necessity. In one of his short letters  Keith had told her that, of all things, it was necessary that the  lad should speak French with perfect fluency, and master as much  German as possible. And it was to these points that his education  had been almost entirely directed.    As to French there was no difficulty and, when she recovered a  portion of the estate, Maggie Drummond was lucky in hearing of a  Hanoverian trooper who, having been wounded and left behind in  Glasgow, his term of service having expired, had on his recovery  married the daughter of the woman who had nursed him. He was  earning a somewhat precarious living by giving lessons in the use  of the rapier, and in teaching German; and gladly accepted the  offer to move out to Kilgowrie, where he was established in a  cottage close to the house, where his wife aided in the housework.  He became a companion of Fergus in his walks and rambles and, being  an honest and pleasant fellow, the lad took to him; and after a few  months their conversation, at first somewhat disjointed, became  easy and animated. He learned, too, much from him as to the use of  his sword. The Scotch clansmen used their claymores chiefly for  striking; but under Rudolph's tuition the lad came to be as apt  with the point as he had before been with the edge, and fully  recognized the great advantages of the former. By the time he  reached the age of sixteen, his skill with the weapon was fully  recognized by the young clansmen who, on occasions of festive  gatherings, sometimes came up to try their skill with the young  laird.    From Rudolph, too, he came to know a great deal of the affairs of  Europe, as to which he had hitherto been profoundly ignorant. He  learned how, by the capture of the province of Silesia from the  Empress of Austria, the King of Prussia had, from a minor  principality, raised his country to a considerable power, and was  regarded with hostility and jealousy by all his neighbours.    \"But it is only a small territory now, Rudolph,\" Fergus said.    \"'Tis small, Master Fergus, but the position is a very strong one.  Silesia cannot well be invaded, save by an army forcing its way  through very formidable defiles; while on the other hand, the  Prussian forces can suddenly pour out into Saxony or Hanover.  Prussia has perhaps the best-drilled army in Europe, and though its  numbers are small in proportion to those which Austria can put in  the field, they are a compact force; while the Austrian army is  made up of many peoples, and could not be gathered with the speed  with which Frederick could place his force in the field.    \"The king, too, is himself, above all things, a soldier. He has  good generals, and his troops are devoted to him, though the  discipline is terribly strict. It is a pity that he and the King of  England are not good friends. They are natural allies, both  countries being Protestant; and to say the truth, we in Hanover  should be well pleased to see them make common cause together, and  should feel much more comfortable with Prussia as our friend than  as a possible enemy.    \"However, 'tis not likely that, at present, Prussia will turn her  hand against us. I hear, by letters from home, that it is said that  the Empress of Russia, as well as the Empress of Austria, both hate  Frederick; the latter because he has stolen Silesia from her; the  former because he has openly said things about her such as a woman  never forgives. Saxony and Poland are jealous of him, and France  none too well disposed. So at present the King of Prussia is like  to leave his neighbours alone; for he may need to draw his sword,  at any time, in self defence.\"    It was but a few days after this that Maggie Drummond received this  short letter from her cousin, Marshal James Keith:    \"My dear Cousin,    \"By your letter, received a few days since, I learned that Fergus  is now nearly sixteen years old; and is, you say, as well grown and  strong as many lads two or three years older. Therefore it is as  well that you should send him off to me, at once. There are signs  in the air that we shall shortly have stirring times, and the  sooner he is here the better. I would send money for his outfit;  but as your letter tells me that you have, by your economies, saved  a sum ample for this purpose, I abstain from doing so. Let him come  straight to Berlin, and inquire for me at the palace. I have a  suite of apartments there; and he could not have a better time for  entering upon military service; nor a better master than the king,  who loves his Scotchmen, and under whom he is like to find  opportunity to distinguish himself.\"    A week later, Fergus started. It needed an heroic effort, on the  part of his mother, to let him go from her; but she had, all along,  recognized that it was for the best that he should leave her. That  he should grow up as a petty laird, where his ancestors had been  the owners of wide estates, and were powerful chiefs with a large  following of clansmen and retainers, was not to be thought of.  Scotland offered few openings, especially to those belonging to  Jacobite families; and it was therefore deemed the natural course,  for a young man of spirit, to seek his fortune abroad and, from the  days of the Union, there was scarcely a foreign army that did not  contain a considerable contingent of Scottish soldiers and  officers. They formed nearly a third of the army of Gustavus"]]]
