Some years the loss is heavier, sometimes lighter, but  in round numbers this is our annual loss in the great war.  That it  would be far greater if we had no lifeboats and no life-saving rockets  it will be our duty by-and-by to show.    The black spots on the Wreck Chart to which we have referred show at a  single glance that the distribution of wrecks is very unequal--naturally  so.  Near the great seaports we find them thickly strewn; at other  places, where vessels pass in great numbers on their way to these ports,  the spots are also very numerous, while on unfrequented parts they are  found only here and there in little groups of two, three, or four.  Away  on the nor'-west shores of Scotland, for instance, where the seal and  the sea-mew have the ocean and rugged cliffs pretty much to themselves,  the plague-spots are few and far between; but on the east coast we find  a fair sprinkling of them, especially in the mouths of the Forth and  Tay, whither a goodly portion of the world's shipping crowds, and to  which the hardy Norseman now sends many a load of timber--both log and  batten--instead of coming, as he did of old, to batten on the land.  It  is much the same with Ireland, its more important seaports being on the  east.    But there is a great and sudden increase of the spots when we come to  England.  They commence at the border, on the west, where vessels from  and to the busy Clyde enter or quit the Irish Sea.  Darkening the  fringes of the land on both sides, and clustering round the Isle of Man,  they multiply until the ports have no room to hold them, and, as at  Liverpool, they are crowded out into the sea.  From the deadly shores of  Anglesea, where the Royal Charter went down in the great and memorable  storm of November, 1859, the signs of wreck and disaster thicken as we  go south until we reach the Bristol Channel, which appears to be choked  with them, and the dangerous cliffs of Cornwall, which receive the  ill-fated vessels of the fleets that are perpetually leaving or entering  the two great channels.  But it is on the east coast of England that the  greatest damage is done.  From Berwick to the Thames the black spots  cluster like bees.  On the coasts of Norfolk and Suffolk, off Great  Yarmouth, where lie the dangerous Haisborough Sands, the spots are no  longer in scattered groups, but range themselves in dense battalions;  and further south, off the coast of Kent, round which the world's  commerce flows unceasingly into the giant metropolis, where the famous  Goodwin Sands play their deadly part in the great war, the dismal spots  are seen to cluster densely, like gnats in a summer sky.    Now, just where the black spots are thickest on this wreck chart,  lifeboats and rocket apparatus have been stationed in greatest numbers.  As in ordinary warfare, so in battles with the sea, our \"Storm Warriors\"  [See an admirable book, with this title, written by the Reverend John  Gilmore, of Ramsgate.  (Macmillan and Company)] are thrown forward in  force where the enemy's assaults are most frequent and dangerous.  Hence  we find the eastern shores of England crowded at every point with  life-saving apparatus, while most of the other dangerous parts of the  coast are pretty well guarded.    Where and how do our coast heroes fight?  I answer--sometimes on the  cliffs, sometimes on the sands, sometimes on the sea, and sometimes even  on the pierheads.  Their operations are varied by circumstances.  Let us  draw nearer and look at them while in action, and observe how the enemy  assails them.  I shall confine myself at present to a skirmish.    When the storm-fiend is abroad; when dark clouds lower; when blinding  rain or sleet drives before the angry gale, and muttering thunder comes  rolling over the sea, men with hard hands and weather-beaten faces, clad  in oilskin coats and sou'-westers, saunter down to our quays and  headlands all round the kingdom.  These are the lifeboat crews and  rocket brigades.  They are on the lookout.  The enemy is moving, and the  sentinels are being posted for the night--or rather, they are posting  themselves, for nearly all the fighting men in this war are volunteers!    They require no drilling to prepare them for the field; no bugle or drum  to sound the charge.  Their drum is the rattling thunder; their trumpet  the roaring storm.  They began to train for this warfare when they were  not so tall as their fathers' boots, and there are no awkward squads  among them now.  Their organisation is rough-and-ready, like themselves,  and simple too.  The heavens call them to action; the coxswain grasps  the helm, the oars are manned, the word is given, and the rest is  straightforward fighting--over everything, through everything, in the  teeth of everything, until the victory is gained, and rescued men,  women, and children are landed in safety on the shore.    Of course they do not always succeed, but they seldom or never fail to  do the very uttermost that it is in the power of strong and daring men  to accomplish.  Frequently they can tell of defeat and victory on the  same battlefield.    So it was on one fearful winter night at the mouth of the Tyne in the  year 1867.  The gale that night was furious.  It suddenly chopped round  to the South South East, and, as if the change had recruited its  energies, it blew a perfect hurricane between midnight and two in the  morning, accompanied by blinding showers of sleet and hail, which seemed  to cut like a knife.  The sea was rising mountains high.    About midnight, when the storm was gathering force and the sentinels  were scarcely able to keep a lookout, a preventive officer saw a vessel  driving ashore to the south of the South Pier.  Instantly he burnt a  blue light, at which signal three guns were fired from the Spanish  Battery to call out the Life Brigade.  The men were on the alert.  About  twenty members of the brigade assembled almost immediately on the pier,  where they found that the preventive officer and pier-policeman had  already got out the life-saving apparatus; but the gale was so fierce  that they had been forced to crawl on their hands and knees to do so.  A  few minutes more and the number of brigade men increased to between  fifty and sixty.  Soon they saw, through the hurtling storm, that  several vessels were driving on shore.  Before long, four ships, with  their sails blown to ribbons, were grinding themselves to powder, and  crashing against each other and the pier-sides in a most fearful manner.  They were the Mary Mac, the Cora, and the Maghee, belonging to  Whitstable, and the Lucern of Blyth.    Several lifeboats were stationed at that point.  They were all launched,  manned, and promptly pulled into the Narrows, but the force of the  hurricane and seas were such that they could not make headway against  them.  The powers of man are limited.  When there is a will there is not  always a way!  For two hours did these brave men strain at the tough  oars in vain; then they unwillingly put about and returned, utterly  exhausted, leaving it to the men with the life-lines on shore to do the  fighting.  Thus, frequently, when one arm of the service is prevented  from acting; the other arm comes into play.    The work of the men engaged on the pier was perilous and difficult, for  the lines had to be fired against a head wind.  The piers were covered  with ice, and the gale was so strong that the men could hardly stand,  while the crews of the wrecks were so benumbed that they could make  little effort to help themselves.    The men of the Mary Mac, however, made a vigorous effort to get their  longboat out.  A boy jumped in to steady it.  Before the men could  follow, the boat was stove in, the rope that held it broke, and it drove  away with the poor lad in it.  He was quickly washed out, but held on to  the gunwale until it drifted into broken water, when he was swallowed by  the raging sea and the boat was dashed to pieces.    Meanwhile the crew of the Cora managed to swing themselves ashore, their  vessel being close to the pier.  The crew of the Lucern, acting on the  advice of the brigade men, succeeded in scrambling on board the Cora and  were hauled ashore on the life-lines.  They had not been ten minutes out  of their vessel when she turned over with her decks towards the terrible  sea, which literally tore her asunder, and pitched her up, stem on end,  as if she had been a toy.  The crew of the Maghee were in like manner  hauled on to the pier, with the exception of one lad from Canterbury.  It was the poor boy's first voyage.  Little did he think probably, while  dreaming of the adventures of a sailor's career, what a terrible fate  awaited him.  He was apparently paralysed with fear, and could not  spring after his comrades to the pier, but took to the rigging.  He had  scarcely done so when the vessel heeled over, and he was swung two or  three times backwards and forwards with the motion of the masts.    It is impossible to imagine the feelings of the brave men on the pier,  who would so gladly have risked their lives to save him--he was so near,  and yet so hopelessly beyond the reach of human aid!    In a very brief space of time the waves did their work--ship and boy  were swallowed up together.    While these events were enacting on the pier the Mary Mac had drifted  over the sand about half a mile from where she had struck.  One of her  crew threw a leadline towards a seaman on the shore.  The hero plunged  into the surf and caught it.  The rest of the work was easy.  By means  of the line the men of the Life Brigade sent off their hawser, and  breeches-buoy or cradle (which apparatus I shall hereafter explain), and  drew the crew in safety to the land.    That same morning a Whitby brig struck on the sands.  The lifeboat  Pomfret, belonging to the Royal National Lifeboat Institution, put out  and rescued her crew.  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21721"],[0,"The Coral Island (#2)"],[1,"America, the  weather became very cold and stormy, and the sailors began to tell  stories about the furious gales and the dangers of that terrible cape.    \"Cape Horn,\" said one, \"is the most horrible headland I ever doubled.  I've sailed round it twice already, and both times the ship was a'most  blow'd out o' the water.\"    \"I've been round it once,\" said another; \"an' that time the sails were  split, and the ropes frozen in the blocks so that they wouldn't work,  and we wos all but lost.\"    \"An' I've been round it five times,\" cried a third; \"an' every time wos  wuss than another, the gales wos so tree-mendous!\"    \"And I've been round it, no times at all,\" cried Peterkin with an  impudent wink in his eye, \"an' that time I wos blow'd inside out!\"    Nevertheless we passed the dreaded cape without much rough weather, and  in the course of a few weeks afterwards were sailing gently, before a  warm tropical breeze, over the Pacific Ocean.  Thus we proceeded on our  voyage--sometimes bounding merrily before a fair breeze; at other times  floating calmly on the glassy wave and fishing for the curious  inhabitants of the deep, all of which, although the sailors thought  little of them, were strange, and interesting, and very wonderful to me.    At last we came among the Coral Islands of the Pacific; and I shall  never forget the delight with which I gazed--when we chanced to pass  one--at the pure white, dazzling shores, and the verdant palm-trees,  which looked bright and beautiful in the sunshine.  And often did we  three long to be landed on one, imagining that we should certainly find  perfect happiness there!  Our wish was granted sooner than we expected.    One night, soon after we entered the tropics, an awful storm burst upon  our ship.  The first squall of wind carried away two of our masts, and  left only the foremast standing.  Even this, however, was more than  enough, for we did not dare to hoist a rag of sail on it.  For five days  the tempest raged in all its fury.  Everything was swept off the decks,  except one small boat.  The steersman was lashed to the wheel lest he  should be washed away, and we all gave ourselves up for lost.  The  captain said that he had no idea where we were, as we had been blown far  out of our course; and we feared much that we might get among the  dangerous coral reefs which are so numerous in the Pacific.  At daybreak  on the sixth morning of the gale we saw land ahead; it was an island  encircled by a reef of coral, on which the waves broke in fury.  There  was calm water within this reef, but we could see only one narrow  opening into it.  For this opening we steered; but ere we reached it a  tremendous wave broke on our stern, tore the rudder completely off, and  left us at the mercy of the winds and waves.    \"It's all over with us now, lads!\" said the captain to the men.  \"Get  the boat ready to launch; we shall be on the rocks in less than  half-an-hour.\"    The men obeyed in gloomy silence, for they felt that there was little  hope of so small a boat living in such a sea.    \"Come, boys,\" said Jack Martin, in a grave tone, to me and Peterkin, as  we stood on the quarter-deck awaiting our fate--\"come, boys; we three  shall stick together.  You see it is impossible that the little boat can  reach the shore, crowded with men.  It will be sure to upset, so I mean  rather to trust myself to a large oar.  I see through the telescope that  the ship will strike at the tail of the reef, where the waves break into  the quiet water inside; so if we manage to cling to the oar till it is  driven over the breakers, we may perhaps gain the shore.  What say you?  Will you join me?\"    We gladly agreed to follow Jack, for he inspired us with confidence--  although I could perceive, by the sad tone of his voice, that he had  little hope; and indeed, when I looked at the white waves that lashed  the reef and boiled against the rocks as if in fury, I felt that there  was but a step between us and death.  My heart sank within me; but at  that moment my thoughts turned to my beloved mother, and I remembered  those words, which were among the last that she said to me: \"Ralph, my  dearest child, always remember, in the hour of danger, to look to your  Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.  He alone is both able and willing to  save your body and your soul.\"  So I felt much comforted when I thought  thereon.    The ship was now very near the rocks.  The men were ready with the boat,  and the captain beside them giving orders, when a tremendous wave came  towards us.  We three ran towards the bow to lay hold of our oar, and  had barely reached it when the wave fell on the deck with a crash like  thunder.  At the same moment the ship struck; the foremast broke off  close to the deck and went over the side, carrying the boat and men  along with it.  Our oar got entangled with the wreck, and Jack seized an  axe to cut it free; but owing to the motion of the ship, he missed the  cordage and struck the axe deep into the oar.  Another wave, however,  washed it clear of the wreck.  We all seized hold of it, and the next  instant we were struggling in the wild sea.  The last thing I saw was  the boat whirling in the surf, and all the sailors tossed into the  foaming waves.  Then I became insensible.    On recovering from my swoon I found myself lying on a bank of soft  grass, under shelter of an overhanging rock, with Peterkin on his knees  by my side, tenderly bathing my temples with water, and endeavouring to  stop the blood that flowed from a wound in my forehead.        CHAPTER THREE.    THE CORAL ISLAND--OUR FIRST COGITATIONS AFTER LANDING AND THE RESULT OF  THEM--WE CONCLUDE THAT THE ISLAND IS UNINHABITED.    There is a strange and peculiar sensation experienced in recovering from  a state of insensibility which is almost indescribable: a sort of  dreamy, confused consciousness; a half-waking, half-sleeping condition,  accompanied with a feeling of weariness, which, however, is by no means  disagreeable.  As I slowly recovered, and heard the voice of Peterkin  inquiring whether I felt better, I thought that I must have overslept  myself, and should be sent to the masthead for being lazy; but before I  could leap up in haste, the thought seemed to vanish suddenly away, and  I fancied that I must have been ill.  Then a balmy breeze fanned my  cheek; and I thought of home, and the garden at the back of my father's  cottage with its luxuriant flowers, and the sweet-scented honeysuckle  that my dear mother trained so carefully upon the trellised porch.  But  the roaring of the surf put these delightful thoughts to flight, and I  was back again at sea, watching the dolphins and the flying-fish, and  reefing topsails off the wild and stormy Cape Horn.  Gradually the roar  of the surf became louder and more distinct.  I thought of being wrecked  far, far away from my native land, and slowly opened my eyes to meet  those of my companion Jack, who, with a look of intense anxiety, was  gazing into my face.    \"Speak to us, my dear Ralph!\" whispered Jack tenderly.  \"Are you better  now?\"    I smiled and looked up, saying, \"Better!  Why, what do you mean, Jack?  I'm quite well.\"    \"Then what are you shamming for, and frightening us in this way?\" said  Peterkin, smiling through his tears; for the poor boy had been really  under the impression that I was dying.    I now raised myself on my elbow, and putting my hand to my forehead,  found that it had been cut pretty severely, and that I had lost a good  deal of blood.    \"Come, come, Ralph,\" said Jack, pressing me gently backward, \"lie down,  my boy; you're not right yet.  Wet your lips with this water; it's cool  and clear as crystal.  I got it from a spring close at hand.  There,  now, don't say a word--hold your tongue,\" he said, seeing me about to  speak.  \"I'll tell you all about it, but you must not utter a syllable  till you have rested well.\"    \"Oh, don't stop him from speaking, Jack!\" said Peterkin, who, now that  his fears for my safety were removed, busied himself in erecting a  shelter of broken branches in order to protect me from the wind--which,  however, was almost unnecessary, for the rock beside which I had been  laid completely broke the force of the gale.  \"Let him speak, Jack; it's  a comfort to hear that he's alive after lying there stiff and white and  sulky for a whole hour, just like an Egyptian mummy.--Never saw such a  fellow as you are, Ralph--always up to mischief.  You've almost knocked  out all my teeth and more than half-choked me, and now you go shamming  dead!  It's very wicked of you, indeed it is.\"    While Peterkin ran on in this style my faculties became quite clear  again, and I began to understand my position.  \"What do you mean by  saying I half-choked you, Peterkin?\" said I.    \"What do I mean?  Is English not your mother-tongue? or do you want me  to repeat it in French by way of making it clearer?  Don't you  remember?\"    \"I remember nothing,\" said I, interrupting him, \"after we were thrown  into the sea.\"    \"Hush, Peterkin!\" said Jack; \"you're exciting Ralph with your  nonsense.--I'll explain it to you.  You recollect that, after the ship  struck, we three sprang over the bow into the sea?  Well, I noticed that  the oar struck your head and gave you that cut on the brow which nearly  stunned you, so that you grasped Peterkin round the neck without knowing  apparently what you were about.  In doing so, you pushed the telescope--  which you clung to as if it had been your life--against Peterkin's  mouth--\"    \"Pushed it against his mouth!\" interrupted Peterkin; \"say crammed it  down his throat!  Why, there's a distinct mark of the brass rim on the  back of my gullet at this moment!\"    \"Well, well, be that as it may,\" continued Jack, \"you clung to him,  Ralph, till I feared you really would choke him.  But I saw that he had  a good hold of the oar; so I exerted myself to the utmost to push you  towards the"]]]
