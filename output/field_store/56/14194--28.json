It would  be too risky for them.\"    As Tom swung along at a rapid pace he heard, behind him, the puffing of  an automobile, with the muffler cut out.  He turned and cast a hasty  glance behind.    \"I hope that ain't Andy Foger or any of his cronies,\" he said to  himself.  \"He might try to run me down just for spite.  He generally  rushes along with the muffler open so as to attract attention and make  folks think he has a racing car.\"    It was not Andy, however, as Tom saw a little later, as a man passed  him in a big touring car.  Andy Foger, as my readers will recollect,  was a red-haired, squinty-eyed lad with plenty of money and not much  else.  He and his cronies, including Sam Snedecker, nearly ran Tom down  one day, when the latter was on his bicycle, as told in the first  volume of this series.  Andy had been off on a tour with his chums  during the time when Tom was having such strenuous adventures and had  recently returned.    \"If I can only get that boat,\" mused Tom as he swung back into the  middle of the road after the auto had passed him, \"I certainly will  have lots of fun.  I'll make a week's tour of Lake Carlopa and take dad  and Ned Newton with me.\" Ned was Tom's most particular chum, but as  young Newton was employed in the Shopton bank, the lad did not have  much time for pleasure.  Lake Carlopa was a large body of water, and it  would take a moderately powered boat several days to make a complete  circuit of the shore, so cut up into bays and inlets was it.    In about an hour Tom was at Lanton, and as he neared the home of Mr.  Hastings, which was on the shore of the lake, he saw quite a throng  going down toward the boathouse.    \"There'll be some lively bidding,\" thought Tom as he got off his  machine and pushed it ahead of him through the drive and down toward  the river.  \"I hope they don't go above two hundred dollars, though.\"    \"Get out the way there!\" called a sudden voice, and looking back, Tom  saw that an automobile had crept up silently behind him.  In it were  Andy Foger and Sam Snedecker.  \"Why don't you get out the way?\"  petulantly demanded the red-haired lad.    \"Because I don't choose to,\" replied Tom calmly, knowing that Andy  would never dare to speed up his machine on the slope leading down to  the lake.    \"Go ahead, bump him!\" the young inventor heard Sam whisper.    \"You'd better try it, if you want to get the best trouncing you ever  had!\" cried Tom hotly.    \"Hu! I s'pose you think you're going to bid on the boat?\" sneered Andy.    \"Is there any law against it?\" asked Tom.    \"Hu! Well, you'll not get it.  I'm going to take that boat,\" retorted  the squint-eyed bully.  \"Dad gave me the money to get it.\"    \"All right,\" answered Tom non-committally.  \"Go ahead.  It's a free  country.\"    He stood his motor-cycle up against a tree and went toward a group of  persons who were surrounding the auctioneer.  The time had arrived to  start the sale.  As Tom edged in closer he brushed against a man who  looked at him sharply.  The lad was just wondering if he had ever seen  the individual before, as there seemed to be something strangely  familiar about him, when the man turned quickly away, as if afraid of  being recognized.    \"That's odd,\" thought Tom, but he had no further time for speculation,  as the auctioneer was mounting on a soapbox and had begun to address  the gathering.          CHAPTER II    SOME LIVELY BIDDING      \"Attention, people!\" cried the auctioneer.  \"Give me your attention for  a few minutes, and we will proceed with the business in hand.  As you  all know, I am about to dispose of a fine motor-boat, the property of  Mr. Bently Hastings.  The reason for disposing of it at auction is  known to most of you, but for the benefit of those who do not, I will  briefly state them.  The boat was stolen by a gang of thieves and  recovered recently through the efforts of a young man, Thomas Swift,  son of Barton Swift, our fellow-townsman, of Shopton.\" At that moment  the auctioneer, Jacob Wood, caught sight of Tom in the press, and,  looking directly at the lad, continued:    \"I understand that young Mr. Swift is here to-day, and I hope he  intends to bid on this boat.  If he does, the bidding will be lively,  for Tom Swift is a lively young man.  I wish I could say that some of  the men who stole the boat were here to-day.\"    The auctioneer paused and there were some murmurs from those in the  throng as to why such a wish should be uttered.  Tom felt some one  moving near him, and, looking around, he saw the same man with whom he  had come in contact before.  The person seemed desirous of getting out  on the edge of the crowd, and Tom felt a return of his vague  suspicions.  He looked closely at the fellow, but could trace no  resemblance to any of the men who had so daringly stolen his father's  model.    \"The reason I wish they were here to-day,\" went on Mr. Wood, \"is that  the men did some slight damage to the boat, and if they were here  to-day we would make them pay for it.  However, the damage is slight  and can easily be repaired.  I mention that, as Mr. Hastings desired me  to.  Now we will proceed with the bidding, and I will say that an  opportunity will first be given all to examine the boat.  Perhaps Tom  Swift will give us his opinion on the state it is in as we know he is  well qualified to talk about machinery.\"    All eyes were turned on Tom, for many knew him.    \"Humph! I guess I know as much about boats and motors as he does,\"  sneered Andy Foger.  \"He isn't the only one in this crowd! Why didn't  the auctioneer ask me?\"    \"Keep quiet,\" begged Sam Snedecker.  \"People are laughing at you, Andy.\"    \"I don't care if they are,\" muttered the sandy haired youth.  \"Tom  Swift needn't think he's everything.\"    \"If you will come down to the dock,\" went on the auctioneer, \"you can  all see the boat, and I would be glad to have young Mr. Swift give us  the benefit of his advice.\"    The throng trooped down to the lake, and, blushing somewhat, Tom told  what was the matter with the motor and how it could be fixed.  It was  noticed that there was less enthusiasm over the matter than there had  been, for certainly the engine, rusty and out of order as it was, did  not present an attractive sight.  Tom noted that the man, who had acted  so strangely, did not come down to the dock.    \"Guess he can't be much interested in the motor,\" decided Tom.    \"Now then, if it's all the same to you folks, I'll proceed with the  auction here,\" went on Mr. Wood.  \"You can all see the boat from here.  It is, as you see, a regular family launch and will carry twelve  persons comfortably.  With a canopy fitted to it a person could cruise  all about the lake and stay out over night, for you could sleep on the  seat cushions.  It is twenty-one feet in length and has a  five-and-a-half-foot beam, the design being what is known as a  compromise stern.  The motor is a double-cylinder two-cycle one, of ten  horsepower.  It has a float-feed carburetor, mechanical oiler, and the  ignition system is the jump-spark--the best for this style of motor.  The boat will make ten miles an hour, with twelve in, and, of course,  more than that with a lighter load.  A good deal will depend on the way  the motor is managed.    \"Now, as you know, Mr. Hastings wishes to dispose of the boat partly  because he does not wish to repair it and partly because he has a newer  and larger one.  The craft, which is named CARLOPA by the way, cost  originally nine hundred dollars.  It could not be purchased new to-day,  in many places, for a thousand.  Now what am I offered in its present  condition? Will any one make an offer?  Will you give me five hundred  dollars?\"    The auctioneer paused and looked critically at the throng.  Several  persons smiled.  Tom looked worried.  He had no idea that the price  would start so high.    \"Well, perhaps that is a bit stiff,\" went on Mr. Wood.  \"Shall we say  four hundred dollars? Come now, I'm sure it's worth four hundred.  Who'll start it at four hundred?\"    No one would, and the auctioneer descended to three hundred, then to  two and finally, as if impatient, he called out:    \"Well, will any one start at fifty dollars?\"    Instantly there were several cries of \"I will!\"    \"I thought you would,\" went on the auctioneer.  \"Now we will get down  to work.  I'm offered fifty dollars for this twenty-one foot, ten  horsepower family launch.  Will any one make it sixty?\"    \"Sixty!\" called out Andy Foger in a shrill voice.  Several turned to  look at him.    \"I didn't know he was going to bid,\" thought Tom.  \"He may go above me.  He's got plenty of money, and, while I have too, I'm not going to pay  too much for a damaged boat.\"    \"Sixty I'm bid, sixty--sixty!\" cried Mr. Wood in a sing-song tone,  \"who'll make it seventy?\"    \"Sixty-five!\" spoke a quiet voice at Tom's elbow, and he turned to see  the mysterious man who had joined the crowd at the edge of the lake.    \"Sixty-five from the gentleman in the white straw hat!\" called Mr. Wood  with a smile at his wit, for there were many men wearing white straw  hats, the day being a warm one in June.    \"Here, who's bidding above me?\" exclaimed Andy, as if it was against  the law.    \"I guess you'll find a number going ahead of you, my young friend,\"  remarked the auctioneer.  \"Will you have the goodness not to interrupt  me, except when you want to bid?\"    \"Well, I offered sixty,\" said the squint-eyed bully, while his crony,  Sam Snedecker, was vainly, pulling at his sleeve.    \"I know you did, and this gentleman went above you.  If you want to bid  more you can do so.  I'm offered sixty-five, sixty-five I'm offered for  this boat.
