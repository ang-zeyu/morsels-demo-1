To  enter the mill, to stand quietly and look about, was the best kind of  entertainment, for she was fascinated by the whir of the looms, by the  nimble fingers of the weavers, and by the general air of efficiency.  Admiringly she watched Sally Ann Hyatt, the tall capable weaver from  Vermont. When the yarn on the beam was tangled or there was something  wrong with the machinery, Elijah, the overseer, always called out to  Sally Ann, \"I'll tend your loom, if you'll look after this.\" Sally Ann  never failed to locate the trouble or to untangle the yarn. Yet she  was never made overseer, and this continued to puzzle Susan.[1]    The manufacture of cotton was a new industry, developing with great  promise in the United States, when Susan B. Anthony was born on  February 15, 1820, in the wide valley at the foot of Mt. Greylock,  near Adams, Massachusetts. Enterprising young men like her father,  Daniel Anthony, saw a potential cotton mill by the side of every  rushing brook, and young women, eager to earn the first money they  could call their own, were leaving the farms, for a few months at  least, to work in the mills. Cotton cloth was the new sensation and  the demand for it was steadily growing. Brides were proud to display a  few cotton sheets instead of commonplace homespun linen.    When Susan was two years old, her father built a cotton factory of  twenty-six looms beside the brook which ran through Grandfather Read's  meadow, hauling the cotton forty miles by wagon from Troy, New York.  The millworkers, most of them young girls from Vermont, boarded, as  was the custom, in the home of the millowner; Susan's mother, Lucy  Read Anthony, although she had three small daughters to care for,  Guelma, Susan, and Hannah, boarded eleven of the millworkers with  only the help of a thirteen-year-old girl who worked for her after  school hours. Lucy Anthony cooked their meals on the hearth of the big  kitchen fireplace, and in the large brick oven beside it baked crisp  brown loaves of bread. In addition, washing, ironing, mending, and  spinning filled her days. But she was capable and strong and was doing  only what all women in this new country were expected to do. She  taught her young daughters to help her, and Susan, even before she was  six, was very useful; by the time she was ten she could cook a good  meal and pack a dinner pail.    [Illustration: Daniel Anthony, father of Susan B. Anthony]           *       *       *       *       *    Hard work and skill were respected as Susan grew up in the rapidly  expanding young republic which less than fifty years before had been  founded and fought for. Settlers, steadily pushing westward, had built  new states out of the wilderness, adding ten to the original thirteen.  Everywhere the leaven of democracy was working and men were putting  into practice many of the principles so boldly stated in the  Declaration of Independence, claiming for themselves equal rights and  opportunities. The new states entered the Union with none of the  traditional property and religious limitations on the franchise, but  with manhood suffrage and all voters eligible for office. The older  states soon fell into line, Massachusetts in 1820 removing property  qualifications for voters. Before long, throughout the United States,  all free white men were enfranchised, leaving only women, Negroes, and  Indians without the full rights of citizenship.    [Illustration: Lucy Read Anthony, mother of Susan B. Anthony]    Although women freeholders had voted in some of the colonies and in  New Jersey as late as 1807,[2] just as in England in the fifteenth  franchise had gradually found its way into the statutes, and women's  rights as citizens were ignored, in spite of the contribution they had  made to the defense and development of the new nation. However,  European travelers, among them De Tocqueville, recognized that the  survival of the New World experiment in government and the prosperity  and strength of the people were due in large measure to the  superiority of American women. A few women had urged their claims:  Abigail Adams asked her husband, a member of the Continental Congress,  \"to remember the ladies\" in the \"new code of laws\"; and Hannah Lee  Corbin of Virginia pleaded with her brother, Richard Henry Lee, to  make good the principle of \"no taxation without representation\" by  enfranchising widows with property.[3]    Yet the legal bondage of women continued to be overlooked. It seemed a  less obvious threat to free institutions and democratic government  than the Negro in slavery. In fact, Negro slavery presented a problem  which demanded attention again and again, flaring up alarmingly in  1820, the year Susan B. Anthony was born, when Missouri was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20461"],[0,"German Culture Past and Present (#2)"],[1,"class from the princes of the empire down to the  meanest knight. In the same year the Imperial Chamber (_Reichskammer_)  was established, and in 1501 the Imperial Aulic Council. Maximilian  also organized a standing army of mercenary troops, called  _Landesknechte_. Shortly afterwards Germany was divided into Imperial  districts called circles (_Kreise_), ultimately ten in number, all of  which were under an imperial government (_Reichsregiment_), which had  at its disposal a military force for the punishment of disturbers of  the peace. But the public opinion of the age, conjoined with the  particular circumstances, political and economic, of Central Europe,  robbed the enactment in a great measure of its immediate effect.  Highway plundering and even private war were still going on, to a  considerable extent, far into the sixteenth century. Charles V pursued  the same line of policy as his predecessor; but it was not until after  the suppression of the lower nobility in 1523, and finally of the  peasants in 1526, that any material change took place; and then the  centralization, such as it was, was in favour of the princes, rather  than of the Imperial power, which, after Charles V's time, grew weaker  and weaker. The speciality about the history of Germany is, that it  has not known till our own day centralization on a national or racial  scale like England or France.    At the opening of the sixteenth century public opinion not merely  sanctioned open plunder by the wearer of spurs and by the possessor of  a stronghold, but regarded it as his special prerogative, the exercise  of which was honourable rather than disgraceful. The cities certainly  resented their burghers being waylaid and robbed, and hanged the  knights wherever they could; and something like a perpetual feud  always existed between the wealthier cities and the knights who  infested the trade routes leading to and from them. Still, these  belligerent relations were taken as a matter of course; and no  disgrace, in the modern sense, attached to the occupation of highway  robbery.    In consequence of the impoverishment of the knights at this period,  owing to causes with which we shall deal later, the trade or  profession had recently received an accession of vigour, and at the  same time was carried on more brutally and mercilessly than ever  before. We will give some instances of the sort of occurrence which  was by no means unusual. In the immediate neighbourhood of Nuernberg,  which was _bien entendu_ one of the chief seats of the Imperial power,  a robber-knight leader, named Hans Thomas von Absberg, was a standing  menace. It was the custom of this ruffian, who had a large following,  to plunder even the poorest who came from the city, and, not content  with this, to mutilate his victims. In June 1522 he fell upon a  wretched craftsman, and with his own sword hacked off the poor  fellow's right hand, notwithstanding that the man begged him upon his  knees to take the left, and not destroy his means of earning his  livelihood. The following August he, with his band, attacked a  Nuernberg tanner, whose hand was similarly treated, one of his  associates remarking that he was glad to set to work again, as it was  \"a long time since they had done any business in hands.\" On the same  occasion a cutler was dealt with after a similar fashion. The hands in  these cases were collected and sent to the Buergermeister of Nuernberg,  with some such phrase as that the sender (Hans Thomas) would treat all  so who came from the city.    The princes themselves, when it suited their purpose, did not hesitate  to offer an asylum to these knightly robbers. With Absberg were  associated Georg von Giech and Hans Georg von Aufsess. Among other  notable robber-knights of the time may be mentioned the Lord of  Brandenstein and the Lord of Rosenberg. As illustrating the strictly  professional character of the pursuit, and the brutally callous nature  of the society practising it, we may narrate that Margaretha von  Brandenstein was accustomed, it is recorded, to give the advice to the  choice guests round her board that when a merchant failed to keep his  promise to them, they should never hesitate to cut off _both_ his  hands. Even Franz von Sickingen, known sometimes as the \"last flower  of German chivalry,\" boasted of having among the intimate associates  of his enterprise for the rehabilitation of the knighthood many  gentlemen who had been accustomed to \"let their horses on the high  road bite off the purses of wayfarers.\" So strong was the public  opinion of the noble class as to the inviolability of the privilege of  highway plunder that a monk, preaching one day in a cathedral and  happening to attack it as unjustifiable, narrowly escaped death at the  hands of some knights present amongst his congregation, who asserted  that he had insulted the prerogatives of their order. Whenever this  form of knight-errantry was criticized, there were never wanting  scholarly pens to defend it as a legitimate means of aristocratic  livelihood; since a knight must live in suitable style, and this was  often his only resource for obtaining the means thereto.    The free cities, which were subject only to Imperial jurisdiction,  were practically independent republics. Their organization was a  microcosm of that of the entire empire. At the apex of the municipal  society was the Buergermeister and the so-called \"Honorability\"  (_Ehrbarkeit_), which consisted of the patrician clans or _gentes_ (in  most cases), those families which were supposed to be descended from  the original chartered freemen of the town, the old Mark-brethren.  They comprised generally the richest families, and had monopolized the  entire government of the city, together with the right to administer  its various sources of income and to consume its revenue at their  pleasure. By the time, however, of which we are writing, the  trade-guilds had also attained to a separate power of their own, and  were in some cases ousting the burgher-aristocracy, though they were  very generally susceptible of being manipulated by the members of the  patrician class, who, as a rule, could alone sit in the Council  (_Rath_). The latter body stood, in fact, as regards the town, much in  the relation of the feudal lord to his manor. Strong in their wealth  and in their aristocratic privileges, the patricians lorded it alike  over the townspeople and over the neighbouring peasantry, who were  subject to the municipality. They forestalled and regrated with  impunity. They assumed the chief rights in the municipal lands, in  many cases imposed duties at their own caprice, and turned guild  privileges and rights of citizenship into a source of profit for  themselves. Their bailiffs in the country districts forming part of  their territory were often more voracious in their treatment of the  peasants than even the nobles themselves. The accounts of income and  expenditure were kept in the loosest manner, and embezzlement clumsily  concealed was the rule rather than the exception.    The opposition of the non-privileged citizens, usually led by the  wealthier guildsmen not belonging to the aristocratic class, operated  through the guilds and through the open assembly of the citizens. It  had already frequently succeeded in establishing a representation of  the general body of the guildsmen in a so-called Great Council  (_Grosser Rath_), and in addition, as already said, in ousting the  \"honorables\" from some of the public functions. Altogether the  patrician party, though still powerful enough, was at the opening of  the sixteenth century already on the decline, the wealthy and  unprivileged opposition beginning in its turn to constitute itself  into a quasi-aristocratic body as against the mass of the poorer  citizens and those outside the pale of municipal rights. The latter  class was now becoming an important and turbulent factor in the life  of the larger cities. The craft-guilds, consisting of the body of  non-patrician citizens, were naturally in general dominated by their  most wealthy section.    We may here observe that the development of the mediaeval township from  its earliest beginnings up to the period of its decay in the sixteenth  century was almost uniformly as follows:[1] At first the township, or  rather what later became the township, was represented entirely by  the circle of _gentes_ or group-families originally settled within the  mark or district on which the town subsequently stood. These  constituted the original aristocracy from which the tradition of the  _Ehrbarkeit_ dated. In those towns founded by the Romans, such as  Trier, Aachen, and others, the case was of course a little different.  There the origin of the _Ehrbarkeit_ may possibly be sought for in the  leading families of the Roman provincials who were in occupation of  the town at the coming of the barbarians in the fifth century. Round  the original nucleus there gradually accreted from the earliest period  of the Middle Ages the freed men of the surrounding districts,  fugitive serfs, and others who sought that protection and means of  livelihood in a community under the immediate domination of a powerful  lord, which they could not otherwise obtain when their native  village-community had perchance been raided by some marauding noble  and his retainers. Circumstances, amongst others the fact that the  community to which they attached themselves had already adopted  commerce and thus become a guild of merchants, led to the  differentiation of industrial functions amongst the new-comers, and  thus to the establishment of craft-guilds.    Another origin of the townsfolk, which must not be overlooked, is to  be found in the attendants on the palace-fortress of some great  overlord. In the early Middle Ages all such magnates kept up an  extensive establishment, the greater ecclesiastical lords no less than  the secular often having"]]]
