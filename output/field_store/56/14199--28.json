All the \"unities\" have been  consistently outraged by a deliberate use of the English and metric  systems side by side.  So long as all the materials for mechanical  processes have to be purchased to specifications in inches and feet,  it is impossible to use the centimetre consistently without  introducing inconvenience.  However, everybody ought to, and probably  does, use either system with equal facility.    No attempt has been made at showing how work can be done without  tools.  Though, no doubt, a great deal can be done with inferior  appliances where great economy of money and none of time is an object,  the writer has long felt very strongly that English physical  laboratory practice has gone too far in the direction of starving the  workshop, and he does not wish, even indirectly, 'to give any  countenance to such a mistaken policy.  Physical research is too  difficult in itself, and students' time is too valuable, for it to be  remunerative to work with insufficient appliances.    In conclusion, the writer would ask his readers to regard the book to  some extent as tentative, and as a means to the procuring and  organising of information bearing upon laboratory arts.  Any  information which can be given will be always thankfully received, and  the author hereby requests any reader who may happen to learn  something of value from the book to communicate any special  information he may possess, so that it may be of use to others should  another edition ever be called for.    CHAPTER I    HINTS ON THE MANIPULATION OF GLASS AND ON GLASS-BLOWING FOR LABORATORY  PURPOSES    Sec. 1.  THE art of glass-blowing has the conspicuous advantage, from the  point of view of literary presentation, of being to a great extent  incommunicable.  As in the case of other delightful arts--such as  those treated of in the Badminton Library, for instance--the most  that can be done by writing is to indicate suitable methods and to  point out precautions which experience has shown to be necessary, and  which are not always obvious when the art is first approached.  It is  not the object of this work to deal with the art of glass-blowing or  any other art after the manner befitting a complete treatise, in which  every form of practice is rightly included.  On the contrary, it is my  wish to avoid the presentation of alternative methods.    I consider that the presentation of alternative methods would, for my  present purpose, be a positive disadvantage, for it would swell this  book to an outrageous size;  and to beginners--I speak from  experience--too lavish a treatment acts rather by way of obscuring  the points to be aimed at than as a means of enlightenment.  The  student often does not know which particular bit of advice to follow,  and obtains the erroneous idea that great art has to be brought to  bear to enable him to accomplish what is, after all, most likely a  perfectly simple and straightforward operation.    This being understood, it might perhaps be expected that I should  describe nothing but the very best methods for obtaining any proposed  result.  Such, of course, has been my aim, but it is not likely that I  have succeeded in every case, or even in the majority of cases, for I  have confined myself to giving such directions as I know from my own  personal experience will, if properly carried out, lead to the result  claimed.  In the few cases in which I have to refer to methods of  which I have no personal experience, I have endeavoured to give  references (usually taking the form of an acknowledgment), so that an  idea of their value may be formed.  All methods not particularised may  be assumed by the reader to have come within my personal experience.    Sec. 2.  Returning to glass-blowing, we may note that two forms of  glass-blowing are known in the arts, \"Pot\" blowing and  \"Table\"  blowing.  In the former case large quantities of fluid \"metal\"  (technical term for melted glass) are assumed to be available, and as  this is seldom the case in the laboratory, and as I have not yet felt  the want of such a supply, I shall deal only with \"table\"  blowing.  Fortunately there is a convenient book on this subject, by Dr.  Shenstone (Rivingtons), so that what I have to say will be as brief as  possible, consistent with sufficiency for everyday work.  As a matter  of fact there is not very much to say, for if ever there was an art in  which manual dexterity is of the first and last importance, that art  is glass-working.    I do not think that a man can become an accomplished glass-blower from  book instructions merely--at all events, not without much unnecessary  labour,--but he can learn to do a number of simple things which will  make an enormous difference to him both as regards the progress of his  work and the state of his pocket.    Sec. 3.  The first thing is to select the glass.  In general, it will  suffice to purchase tubes and rods;  in the case where large pieces  (such as the bulbs of Geissler pumps) have to be specially prepared by  pot-blowing, the student will have to observe precautions to be  mentioned later on.  There are three kinds of glass most generally  employed in laboratories.    Sec. 4.  Soft Soda Glass, obtained for the most part from factories in  Thuringia, and generally used in assembling chemical apparatus.--This  glass is cheap, and easily obtainable from any large firm of apparatus  dealers or chemists.  It should on no account be purchased from small  druggists, for the following reasons:-    (a) It is usually absurdly dear when obtained in this way.    (b) It is generally made up of selections of different age and  different composition, and pieces of different composition, even if  the difference is slight, will not fuse together and remain together  unless joined in a special manner.    (c) It is generally old, and this kind of glass often devitrifies with  age, and is then useless for blowpipe work, though it may be bent  sufficiently for assembling chemical apparatus.  Devitrified glass  looks frosty, or, in the earlier stages, appears to be covered by  cobwebs, and is easily picked out and rejected.    Sec. 5.  It might be imagined that the devitrification would disappear  when the glass is heated to the fusing point; and so it does to a  great extent, but for many operations one only requires to soften the  glass, and the devitrification often persists up to this temperature.  My experience is that denitrified glass is also more likely to crack  in the flame than good new glass, though the difference in this  respect is not very strongly marked with narrow tubes.    Sec. 6.  Flint Glass.    Magnificent flint glass is made both in England and France.  The  English experimenter will probably prefer to use English glass, and,  if he is wise, will buy a good deal at a time, since it does not  appear to devitrify with age, and uniformity is thereby more likely to  be secured.  I have obtained uniformly good results with glass made by  Messrs.  Powell of Whitefriars, but I daresay equally good glass may  be obtained elsewhere.    For general purposes flint glass is vastly superior to the soft soda  mentioned above.  In the first place, it is very much stronger, and  also less liable to crack when heated--not alone when it is new, but  also, and especially, after it has been partly worked.  Apparatus made  of flint glass is less liable to crack and break at places of unequal  thickness than if made of soda glass.  This is not of much importance  where small pieces of apparatus only are concerned, because these can  generally be fairly annealed; and if the work is well done, the  thickness will not be uneven.  It is a different matter where large  pieces of apparatus, such as connections to Geissler pumps, are  concerned, for the glass has often to be worked partly in situ, and  can only be imperfectly annealed.    Joints made between specimens of different composition are much more  likely to stand than when fashioned in soda glass.  Indeed, if it is  necessary to join two bits of soda glass of different kinds, it is  better to separate them by a short length of flint glass;  they are  more likely to remain joined to it than to each other.  A particular  variety of flint glass, known as white enamel, is particularly  suitable for this purpose, and, indeed, may be used practically as a  cement.    Sec. 7, It is, however, when the necessity of altering or repairing  apparatus complicated by joints arises that the advantage of flint  glass is most apparent.  A crack anywhere near to a side, or inserted  joint, can scarcely ever be repaired in the case of soda glass  apparatus, even when the glass is quite thin and the dimensions small.    It should also be mentioned that flint glass has a much more brilliant  appearance than soda glass.  Of course, there is a considerable  difference between different kinds of flint glass as to the melting  point, and this may account for the divergency of the statements  usually met with as to its fusibility compared with that of soda  glass.  The kind of flint glass made by Messrs.  Powell becomes  distinctly soft soon after it is hot enough to be appreciably luminous  in a darkened room, and at a white heat is very fluid.  This fluidity,  though of advantage to the practised worker, is likely to give a  beginner some trouble.    Sec. 8.  As against the advantages enumerated, there are some drawbacks.  The one which will first strike the student is the tendency of the  glass to become reduced in the flame of the blow-pipe.  This can be  got over by proper adjustment of the flame, as will be explained later  on.  A more serious drawback in exact work is the following.

Some things I have inserted  of _Carving and Sewing_ that I might demonstrate the whole Art. In  the contrivance of these my labours, I have so managed them for the  general good, that those whose Purses cannot reach to the cost of  rich Dishes, I have descended to their meaner Expences, that they  may give, though upon a sudden Treatment, to their Kindred, Friends,  Allies and Acquaintance, a handsome and relishing entertainment in  all seasons of the year, though at some distance from Towns or  Villages. Nor have my serious considerations been wanting amongst  direction for Diet how to order what belongs to the sick, as well as  to those that are in health; and withal my care hath been such, that  in this Book as in a Closet, is contained all such Secrets as relate  to _Preserving_, _Conserving_, _Candying_, _Distilling_, and such  rare varieties as they are most concern'd in the _best husbandring  and huswifering_ of them. Nor is there any Book except that of the  _Queens Closet_, which was so _enricht with Receipts_ presented to  her _Majesty_, as yet that I ever saw in any _Language_, that ever  contained so many _profitable Experiences, as in this Volume_: in  all which the _Reader_ shall find most of the _Compositions_, and  mixtures easie to be prepared, most pleasing to the Palate, and not  too chargeable to the Purse; since you are at liberty to employ as  much or as little therein as you please.    In this Edition I have enlarged the whole Work; and there is added  two hundred several Figures of all sorts of Pies, Tarts, Custards,  Cheesecakes, &c. more than was in the former: You will find them in  Tables directed to the _Folio_ they have relation to; there being  such variety of Forms, the Artists may use which of them they  please.    It is impossible for any _Author_ to please all People, no more than  the best Cook can fancy their Palats whose Mouths are always out of  taste. As for those who make it their business to hide their Candle  under a Bushel, to do only good to themselves, and not to others,  such as will curse me for revealing the Secrets of this Art, I value  the discharge of my own Conscience, in doing Good, above all their  malice; protesting to the whole world, that I have not _concealed  any material Secret_ of above my _fifty and five years Experience_;  my Father _being a Cook_ under whom in my Child-hood I was bred up  in this Art.    To conclude, the diligent Peruser of this _Volume_ gains that in a  small time (as to the _Theory_) which an _Apprenticeship_ with some  _Masters_ could never have taught them. I have no more to do, but to  desire of God a blessing upon these my Endeavours; and remain.      _Yours in the most ingenious      ways of Friendship_,        ROBERT MAY.      Sholeby in Leicestershire,      _Sept. 30. 1664_.            _A short Narrative of some Passages of the Authors Life._      For the better knowledge of the worth of this Book, though it be not  usual, the _Author_ being living, it will not be amiss to acquaint  the _Reader_ with a breif account of some passages of his Life, as  also the eminent Persons (renowned for their House-keeping) whom he  hath served through the whole series of his Life; for as the growth  of Children argue the strength of the Parents, so doth the judgment  and abilities of the Artist conduce to the making and goodness of  the Work: now that such great knowledge in this commendable Art was  not gained but by long experience, practise, and converse with the  most able men in their times, the _Reader_ in this breif Narrative  may be informed by what steps and degrees he ascended to the same.    He was born in the year of our Lord 1588. His Father being one of  the ablest _Cooks_ in his time, and his first Tutor in the knowledge  and practice of Cookery; under whom having attained to some  perfection in this Art, the old Lady _Dormer_ sent him over into  _France_, where he continued five years, being in the Family of a  noble Peer, and first President of _Paris_; where he gained not only  the _French_ Tongue but also bettered his Knowledge in his  _Cookery_, and returning again into _England_, was bound an  Apprentice in _London_ to Mr. _Arthur Hollinsworth_ in _Newgate  Market_, one of the ablest Work-men in _London_, Cook to the  _Grocers Hall and Star Chamber_. His Apprentiship being out, the  Lady _Dormer_ sent for him to be her Cook under Father (who then  served that Honourable Lady) where were four Cooks more, such Noble  Houses were then kept, the glory of that, and the shame of this  present Age; then were those Golden Days wherein were practised the  _Triumphs and Trophies of Cookery_; then was Hospitality esteemed,  Neighbourhood preserved, the Poor cherished, and God honoured; then  was Religion less talkt on, and more practised; then was Atheism &  Schism less in fashion: then did men strive to be good, rather then  to seem so. Here he continued till the Lady _Dormer_ died, and then  went again to _London_, and served the Lord _Castlehaven_, after  that the Lord _Lumley_, that great lover and knower of Art, who  wanted no knowledge in the discerning this mystery; next the Lord  _Montague_ in _Sussex_; and at the beginning of these wars, the  Countess of _Kent_, then Mr. _Nevel_ of _Crissen Temple_ in _Essex_,  whose Ancestors the _Smiths_ (of whom he is descended) were the  greatest maintainers of Hospitality in all those parts; nor doth the  present M. _Nevel_ degenerate from their laudable examples. Divers  other Persons of like esteem and quality hath he served; as the Lord  _Rivers_, Mr. _John Ashburnam_ of the Bed-Chambers, Dr. _Steed_ in  _Kent_, Sir _Thomas Stiles_ of _Drury Lane_ in _London_, Sir  _Marmaduke Constable_ in _York-shire_, Sir _Charles Lucas_; and  lastly the Right Honourable the Lady _Englefield_, where he now  liveth.    Thus have I given you a breif account of his Life, I shall next tell  you in what high esteem this noble Art was with the Ancient Romans:  _Plutarch_ reports, that _Lucullus_ his ordinary diet was fine  dainty dishes, with works of pastry, banketting dishes, and fruit  curiously wrought and prepared; that, his Table might be furnished  with choice of varieties, (as the noble Lord _Lumley_ did) that he  kept and nourished all manner of Fowl all the year long. To this  purpose he telleth us a story how _Pompey_ being sick, the  Physitians willed him to eat a Thrush, and it being said there was  none to be had; because it was then Summer; it was answered they  might have them at _Lucullus_'s house who kept both Thrushes and all  manner of Fowl, all the year long. This _Lucullus_ was for his  Hospitality so esteemed in _Rome_, that there was no talk, but of  his Noble House-keeping. The said _Plutarch_ reports how _Cicero_  and _Pompey_ inviting themselves to sup with him, they would not let  him speak with his men to provide any thing more then ordinary; but  he telling them he would sup in _Apollo_, (a Chamber so named, and  every Chamber proportioned their expences) he by this wile beguil'd  them, and a supper was made ready estimated at fifty thousand pence,  every _Roman_ penny being seven pence half penny _English_ money;  a vast sum for that Age, before the _Indies_ had overflowed  _Europe_. But I have too far digressed from the Author of whom I  might speak much more as in relation to his Person and abilities,  but who will cry out the Sun shines? this already said is enough to  satisfie any but the malicious, who are the greatest enemies to all  honest endeavours. _Homer_ had his _Zoilus_, and _Virgil_ his  _Bavius_; the best Wits have had their detractors, and the greatest  Artists have been maligned; the best on't is, such Works as these  outlive their _Authors_ with an honurable respect of Posterity,  whilst envious Criticks never survive their own happiness, their  Lives going out like the snuff of a Candle.      _W.
