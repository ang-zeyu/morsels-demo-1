The place was packed as  full of smells as a bale is of cotton. The oilskins had a peculiarly  thick flavour of their own which made a sort of background to the  smells of fried fish, burnt grease, paint, pepper, and stale tobacco;  but these, again, were all hooped together by one encircling smell of  ship and salt water. Harvey saw with disgust that there were no sheets  on his bed-place. He was lying on a piece of dingy ticking full of  lumps and nubbles. Then, too, the boat's motion was not that of a  steamer. She was neither sliding nor rolling, but rather wriggling  herself about in a silly, aimless way, like a colt at the end of a  halter. Water-noises ran by close to his ear, and beams creaked and  whined about him. All these things made him grunt despairingly and  think of his mother.    \"Feelin' better?\" said the boy, with a grin. \"Hev some coffee?\" He  brought a tin cup full, and sweetened it with molasses.    \"Is n't there milk?\" said Harvey, looking round the dark double tier of  bunks as if he expected to find a cow there.    \"Well, no,\" said the boy. \"Ner there ain't likely to be till 'baout  mid-September. 'Tain't bad coffee. I made it.\"    Harvey drank in silence, and the boy handed him a plate full of pieces  of crisp fried pork, which he ate ravenously.    \"I've dried your clothes. Guess they've shrunk some,\" said the boy.  \"They ain't our style much--none of 'em. Twist round an' see ef you're  hurt any.\"    Harvey stretched himself in every direction, but could not report any  injuries.    \"That's good,\" the boy said heartily. \"Fix yerself an' go on deck. Dad  wants to see you. I'm his son,--Dan, they call me,--an' I'm cook's  helper an' everything else aboard that's too dirty for the men. There  ain't no boy here 'cep' me sence Otto went overboard--an' he was only a  Dutchy, an' twenty year old at that. How'd you come to fall off in a  dead flat ca'am?\"    \"'Twasn't a calm,\" said Harvey, sulkily. \"It was a gale, and I was  seasick. Guess I must have rolled over the rail.\"    \"There was a little common swell yes'day an' last night,\" said the boy.  \"But ef thet's your notion of a gale----\" He whistled. \"You'll know  more 'fore you're through. Hurry! Dad's waitin'.\"    Like many other unfortunate young people, Harvey had never in all his  life received a direct order--never, at least, without long, and  sometimes tearful, explanations of the advantages of obedience and the  reasons for the request. Mrs. Cheyne lived in fear of breaking his  spirit, which, perhaps, was the reason that she herself walked on the  edge of nervous prostration. He could not see why he should be expected  to hurry for any man's pleasure, and said so. \"Your dad can come down  here if he's so anxious to talk to me. I want him to take me to New  York right away. It'll pay him.\"    Dan opened his eyes, as the size and beauty of this joke dawned on him.  \"Say, dad!\" he shouted up the fo'c'sle hatch, \"he says you kin slip  down an' see him ef you're anxious that way. 'Hear, dad?\"    The answer came back in the deepest voice Harvey had ever heard from a  human chest: \"Quit foolin', Dan, and send him to me.\"    Dan sniggered, and threw Harvey his warped bicycle shoes. There was  something in the tones on the deck that made the boy dissemble his  extreme rage and console himself with the thought of gradually  unfolding the tale of his own and his father's wealth on the voyage  home. This rescue would certainly make him a hero among his friends for  life. He hoisted himself on deck up a perpendicular ladder, and  stumbled aft, over a score of obstructions, to where a small,  thick-set, clean-shaven man with grey eyebrows sat on a step that led  up to the quarter-deck. The swell had passed in the night, leaving a  long, oily sea, dotted round the horizon with the sails of a dozen  fishing-boats. Between them lay little black specks, showing where the  dories were out fishing. The schooner, with a triangular riding-sail on  the mainmast, played easily at anchor, and except for the man by the  cabin-roof--\"house\" they call it--she was deserted.    \"Mornin'--good afternoon, I should say. You've nigh slep' the clock  around, young feller,\" was the greeting.    \"Mornin',\" said Harvey. He did not like being called \"young feller\";  and, as one rescued from drowning, expected sympathy. His mother  suffered agonies whenever he got his feet wet; but this mariner did not  seem excited.    \"Naow let's hear all abaout it. It's quite providential, first an'  last, fer all concerned. What might be your name? Where from (we  mistrust it's Noo York), an' where baound (we mistrust it's Europe)?\"    Harvey gave his name, the name of the steamer, and a short history of  the accident, winding up with a demand to be taken back immediately to  New York, where his father would pay anything any one chose to name.    \"H'm,\" said the shaven man, quite unmoved by the end of Harvey's  speech. \"I can't say we think special of any man, or boy even, that  falls overboard from that kind o' packet in a flat ca'am. Least of all  when his excuse is thet he's seasick.\"    \"Excuse!\" cried Harvey. \"D'you suppose I'd fall overboard into your  dirty little boat for fun?\"    \"Not knowin' what your notions o' fun may be, I can't rightly say,  young feller. But if I was you, I wouldn't call the boat which, under  Providence, was the means o' savin' ye, names. In the first place, it's  blame irreligious. In the second, it's annoyin' to my feelin's--an' I'm  Disko Troop o' the \"We're Here\" o' Gloucester, which you don't seem  rightly to know.\"    \"I don't know and I don't care,\" said Harvey. \"I'm grateful enough for  being saved and all that, of course; but I want you to understand that  the sooner you take me back to New York the better it'll pay you.\"    \"Meanin'--haow?\" Troop raised one shaggy eyebrow over a suspiciously  mild blue eye.    \"Dollars and cents,\" said Harvey, delighted to think that he was making  an impression. \"Cold dollars and cents.\" He thrust a hand into a  pocket, and threw out his stomach a little, which was his way of being  grand. \"You've done the best day's work you ever did in your life when  you pulled me in. I'm all the son Harvey Cheyne has.\"    \"He's bin favoured,\" said Disko, drily.    \"And if you don't know who Harvey Cheyne is, you don't know  much--that's all. Now turn her around and let's hurry.\"    Harvey had a notion that the greater part of America was filled with  people discussing and envying his father's dollars.    \"Mebbe I do, an' mebbe I don't. Take a reef in your stummick, young  feller. It's full o' my vittles.\"    Harvey heard a chuckle from Dan, who was pretending to be busy by the  stump-foremast, and the blood rushed to his face. \"We'll pay for that  too,\" he said. \"When do you suppose we shall get to New York?\"    \"I don't use Noo York any. Ner Boston. We may see Eastern Point about  September; an' your pa--I'm real sorry I hain't heerd tell of him--may  give me ten dollars efter all your talk. Then o' course he mayn't.\"    \"Ten dollars! Why, see here, I--\" Harvey dived into his pocket for the  wad of bills. All he brought up was a soggy packet of cigarettes.    \"Not lawful currency, an' bad for the lungs. Heave 'em overboard, young  feller, and try ag'in.\"    \"It's been stolen!\" cried Harvey, hotly.    \"You'll hev to wait till you see your pa to reward me, then?\"    \"A hundred and thirty-four dollars--all stolen,\" said Harvey, hunting  wildly through his pockets. \"Give them back.\"    A curious change flitted across old Troop's hard face. \"What might you  have been doin' at your time o' life with one hundred an' thirty-four  dollars, young feller?\"    \"It was part of my pocket-money--for a month.\" This Harvey thought  would be a knockdown blow, and it was--indirectly.    Oh! One hundred and thirty-four dollars is only part of his  pocket-money--for one month only! You don't remember hittin' anything  when you fell over, do you? Crack ag'in' a stanchion, le's say. Old man  Hasken o' the \"East Wind\"--Troop seemed to be talking to himself--\"he  tripped on a hatch an' butted the mainmast with his head--hardish.  'Baout three weeks afterwards, old man Hasken he would hev it that the  \"East Wind\" was a commerce-destroyin' man-o'-war, an' so he declared  war on Sable Island because it was Bridish, an' the shoals run aout too  far. They sewed him up in a bed-bag, his head an' feet appearin', fer  the rest o' the trip, an' now he's to home in Essex playin' with little  rag dolls.\"    Harvey choked with rage, but Troop went on consolingly: \"We're sorry  fer you. We're very sorry fer you--an' so young. We won't say no more  abaout the money, I guess.\"    \"'Course you won't. You stole it.\"    \"Suit yourself. We stole it ef it's any comfort to you. Naow, abaout  goin' back. Allowin' we could do it, which we can't, you ain't in no  fit state to go back to your home, an' we've jest come on to the Banks,  workin' fer our bread. We don't see the ha'af of a hundred dollars a  month, let alone pocket-money; an' with good luck we'll be ashore again  somewheres abaout the first weeks o' September.\"    \"But--but it's May now, and I can't stay here doin' nothing just  because you want to fish. I can't, I tell you!\"    \"Right an' jest; jest an' right. No one asks you to do nothin'. There's  a heap as you can do, for Otto he went overboard on Le Have. I mistrust  he lost his grip in a gale we f'und there. Anyways, he never come back  to deny it. You've turned up, plain, plumb providential for all  concerned. I mistrust, though, there's ruther few things you kin do.  Ain't thet so?\"    \"I can make it lively for you and your crowd when we get ashore,\" said  Harvey, with a vicious nod, murmuring vague threats about \"piracy,\" at  which Troop almost--not quite--smiled.    \"Excep' talk. I'd forgot that. You ain't"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22257"],[0,"Bulgaria (#2)"],[1," for I went to Bulgaria with the prejudice against  the Bulgarians that I have indicated. And--to make this explanation  complete--I may add that I came back from the Balkans not a  pro-Bulgarian in the sense that I was anti-Greek or anti-Servian or  even anti-Turk; but with a feeling of general liking for all the  peasant peoples whom a cruel fate has cast into the Balkans to fight  out there national and racial issues, some of which are older than the  Christian era.    Yes, even the Turk, the much-maligned Turk, proved to have decent  possibilities if given a decent chance. Certainly he is no longer  the Terrible Turk of tradition. Most of the Turks I encountered in  Bulgaria were prisoners of war, evidently rather pleased to be in the  hands of the Bulgarians who fed them decently, a task which their own  commissariat had failed in: or were contented followers of menial  occupations in Bulgarian towns. I can recall Turkish boot-blacks and  Turkish porters, but no Turks who looked like warriors, and if they  are cut-throats by choice (I do not believe they are) they are very  mild-mannered cut-throats indeed.    Coming back from the lines of Chatalja towards the end of 1912, I had,  for one stage of five days, between Kirk Kilisse and Mustapha Pasha, a  Turkish driver. He had been a Bulgarian subject (I gathered) before the  war, and with his cart and two horses had been impressed into the  transport service. At first with some aid from an interpreter,  afterwards mostly by signs and broken fragments of language, I got to be  able to converse with this Turk. (In the Balkans the various shreds of  races have quaint crazy-quilt patchworks of conversational language.  Somehow or other even a British citizen with more than the usual  stupidity of our race as to foreign languages can make himself  understood in the Balkan Peninsula, which is so polyglottic that its  inhabitants understand signs very well.) My Turk friend, from the very  first, filled my heart with sympathy because of his love for his horses.  Since he had come under the war-rule of the Bulgarians, he complained to  me, he had not been allowed to feed his horses properly. They were  fading away. He wept over them. Actual tears irrigated the furrows of  his weather-beaten and unwashed cheeks.    As a matter of fact the horses were in very good condition indeed,  considering all the circumstances; as good, certainly, as any horses I  had seen since I left Buda-Pesth. But my heart warmed to this Turcoman  and his love for his horses. I had been seeking in vain up to this point  for the appearance of the Terrible Turk of tradition; the Turk, with his  well-beloved Arabian steed, his quite-secondary-in-consideration  Circassian harem; the fierce, unconquerable, disdainful, cruel Turk,  manly in his vices as well as in his virtues. My Turk had at least one  recognisable characteristic in his love for his horses. As he sorrowed  over them I comforted him with a flagon--it was of brandy and water: and  the Prophet, when he forbade wine, was ignorant of brandy, so Islam  these days has its alcoholic consolation--and I stayed him with  cigarettes. He had not had a smoke for a month and, put in possession of  tobacco, he plunged into a mood of rapt exultation, rolling cigarette  after cigarette, chuckling softly as he inhaled the smoke, turning  towards me now and again with a gesture of thanks and of respect. I had  taken over the reins and the little horses were doing very well.    [Illustration: A CONTENTED TURK]    That day, though we had started late, the horses carried us thirty-five  miles, and I camped at the site of a burned-out village. The Turk  made no objection to this. Previously coming over the same route with an  ox-cart, my Macedonian driver had objected to camping except in occupied  villages where there were garrisons. He feared Bashi-Bazouks (the  Turkish irregular bands which occasionally showed themselves in the rear  of the Bulgarian army) and wolves. Probably, too, he feared ghosts, or  was uneasy and lonely when out of range of the village smells. Now I  preferred a burned village site, because the only clean villages were  the burned ones; and for the reason of water it was necessary to camp at  some village or village site. Mr. Turk went up hugely in my estimation  when I found that he had no objections to the site of a burned village  as a camping-place.    But the first night in camp shattered all my illusions. The Turk  unharnessed and lit the camp fire. I cooked my supper and gave him a  share. Then he squatted by the fire and resumed smoking. The horses over  which he had shed tears waited. After the Turk's third cigarette I  suggested that the horses should be watered and fed. The village well  was about 300 yards away, and the Turk evidently did not like the idea  of moving from the fire. He did not move, but argued in Turkish of which  I understood nothing. Finally I elicited the fact that the horses were  too tired to drink and too tired to eat the barley I had brought for  them. As a remedy for tiredness they were to be left without water and  food all night.    As plainly as was possible I insisted to the Turk that the horses must  be watered at once, and afterwards given a good ration of barley. I  dragged him from the fire to the horses and made my meaning clear  enough. The Turk was stubborn. Clearly either I was to water the horses  myself or they were to be left without water, and my old traditions of  horse-mastery would not allow me to have them fed without being watered.  So this was the extent of the Turk's devotion to his horses!    It was necessary to be firm, and I took up the cart whip to the Turk and  convinced him almost at once that the horses were not \"too tired\" to  drink.    Mr. Turk did not resent the blows in the least. He refrained from  cutting my throat as I slept that evening. Afterwards a mere wave of the  hand towards the whip made him move with alacrity. At the end of the  journey, when I gave him a good \"tip,\" he knelt down gallantly in the  mud of Mustapha Pasha and kissed my hand and carried it to his forehead.    So faded away my last hope of meeting the Terrible Turk of tradition in  the Balkans. Perhaps he exists still in Asia Minor. As I saw the Turk in  Bulgaria and in European Turkey, he was a dull monogamic person with no  fiery pride, no picturesque devilry, but a great passion for  sweetmeats--not merely his own \"Turkish Delight,\" but all kinds of  lollipops: his shops were full of Scotch and English confectionery.    But the Bulgarian, not the Turk, is our theme. This introduction,  however, will make it plain that, as the result of a direct knowledge of  the Balkans, during some months in which I had the opportunity of  sharing in Bulgarian peasant life, I came to the admiration I have now  for the Bulgarian people in spite of a preliminary prejudice. And this  conversion of view was not the result of becoming involved in some  passionate political attitude regarding Balkan affairs. I am not now  prepared to take up the view of the fanatic Bulgar-worshippers who must  not only exalt the Bulgarian nation as a modern Chosen People, but must  represent Servian, Greek, and Turk as malignant and devilish in order to  throw up in the highest light their ideas of Bulgarian saintliness.    The Balkans are apt to have strange effects on the traveller. Perhaps it  is the blood-mist that hangs always over the Balkan plains and glens  which gets into the head and intoxicates one: perhaps it is the call to  the wild in us from the primitive human nature of the Balkan peoples.  Whatever the reason, it is a common thing for the unemotional English  traveller to go to the Balkans as a tourist and return as a passionate  enthusiast for some Balkan Peninsula nationality. He becomes, perhaps, a  pro-Turk, and thereafter will argue with fierceness that the Turk is the  only man who leads an idyllic life in Europe to-day, and that the way  to human regeneration is through a conversion to Turkishness. He fills  his house with Turkish visitors and writes letters to the papers  pointing out the savagery we show in the \"Turk's Head\" competition for  our cavalry-men at military tournaments. Or he may become a pro-Bulgar  with a taste for the company of highly flavoured Macedonian  revolutionary priests and a grisly habit of turning the conversation to  the subject of outrage and massacre. To become a pro-Servian is not a  common fashion, but pro-Albanians and pro-Montenegrins and  Philhellenists are common enough.    The word \"crank,\" if it can be read in a kindly sense and stripped of  malice, covers all these folk. Exactly why the Balkans have such an  effect in making \"cranks\" I have already confessed an inability to  explain. The fact must stand as one of those things which we must  believe--if we read Parliamentary debates and newspaper  correspondence--but cannot comprehend.    But any \"crank\" view I disavow. Whether from a natural lack of a  generous sense of partisanship, or a journalistic training (which crabs  emotionalism: that acute observer of men, the late \"General\" Booth, said  once of his Salvation Army work, \"You can never 'save' a journalist\"), I  came back from the Balkans without a desire to join a society to exalt  any one of the little nationalities struggling for national expression  in its rowdy life. But I did get to a strong admiration of the Bulgarian  people as soldiers, farmers, road-makers, and as friends. The evidence  on which that admiration is based will be stated in these pages, and it  is my hope that it will do a little to set the Bulgarian--who is  sometimes much overpraised and often much over-abused--in a right light  before my readers.    But before dealing with the Bulgarian of to-day we must look into his  antecedents.
