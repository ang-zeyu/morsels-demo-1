Go, call up the men and clear for action.\"    The breeze had indeed been freshening while he spoke, and now came down  in a series of squalls that caused the piratical-looking craft to lie  over as if she were about to capsize.  The vessel which they were  pursuing also bent over to the breeze and crowded all sail; for well did  Francisco, its owner and padrone, know, from past experience, that  Algerine corsairs were fast sailers, and that his only hope lay in  showing them his heels!  He had often given them the slip before--why  should he not again?    While thus doing his best to escape, however, the bluff merchant did not  neglect to make preparations for defence.    \"Clear away the big gun,\" he said to Mariano, who acted as his first  officer, Lucien being the scrivano or supercargo of the vessel; \"'tis a  good piece, and has turned the flight of many a pirate with its first  bark.\"    The latter part of this remark was addressed to Bacri, who stood,  leaning over the taffrail, looking anxiously at the vessel in chase.    \"If it be Sidi Hassan,\" muttered the Jew half aloud, \"there is little  chance--\"    \"What say you?\" demanded Francisco.    \"I say that if it be the vessel of a man whom I happen to know, you will  have to trust to your sails for deliverance--fighting will be of no  avail.\"    Francisco looked at the Jew with some surprise, not unmingled with  contempt.    \"A warlike spirit, it seems, does not always consort with a powerful  frame,\" he said; \"but how come you to have scraped acquaintance with  these pirates, whose existence is a blight upon the commerce of the  Mediterranean, and a disgrace to our age?\"    \"None should know better than thyself that a trader, like any other  traveller, becomes acquainted with strange bedfellows,\" replied Bacri,  with a quiet smile.  \"As to a warlike spirit, of what use would it be in  a despised Israelite to display such?\"    \"There is truth in that,\" returned the padrone in a more respectful  tone; \"nevertheless, if fighting becomes needful, I trust that one  furnished with such thews and sinews will not fail to lend effective  aid.\"    \"That he will not, I dare say; and here is a cutlass for him, wherewith  to carve a name and fame,\" said Mariano, coming aft at the moment and  presenting the weapon to Bacri, who took it with a half-humorous smile,  and laid it on the seat beside him.    \"Hast got the big gun ready, boy?\" demanded Francisco.    \"Ay--loaded her almost to the muzzle.  I ordered her to be  double-shotted, and that big black rascal Manqua slily crammed in a  handful of nails without leave.  I only hope she won't burst.\"    \"Burst!\" exclaimed the padrone, with a laugh; \"if you were to load her  even beyond the muzzle she wouldn't burst.  I remember once loading her  with a full dose of canister, and clapped two round shot on the top of  that, after which the same negro you have mentioned, (for he has a  tendency in that way), shoved in a handspike without orders, and let the  whole concern fly at a pirate boat, which it blew clean out of the  water: she well-nigh burst the drums of our ears on that occasion, but  showed no sign whatever of bursting herself.\"    \"Nevertheless,\" said Bacri earnestly, \"I advise you to trust entirely to  your sails.\"    \"We haven't another stitch of canvas to set,\" said Francisco in reply;  \"and if we had, the old schooner couldn't stand it, for, as you may see,  the strain is already as much as she can bear.\"    This was indeed the case, for the vessel was by that time flying before  a stiff breeze, with all the sail set that she could carry, while the  water dashed in clouds from her bows, and rushed over her lee bulwarks.    But the sailing powers of the pirate-vessel were superior to those of  the trading schooner.  In a short time she was close alongside, and  fired a shot across her bows to cause her to heave-to.  This, however,  the determined skipper resolved not to do.  In reply he sent on board  the pirates the varied contents of the big gun, which cut the halyards  of their smaller sail, and brought it down on the deck.  This result was  celebrated by a hearty cheer from the schooner's crew.  The pirates, in  return, discharged a broadside which cut away the foremast of the  schooner, thus rendering escape impossible.    \"Now, men,\" cried Francisco, when the disaster occurred, \"you must this  day make your choice--victory or slavery--for there is no mercy in the  breasts of these scoundrels.\"    He waited for no reply, but at once sprang to the big gun, which had  been re-loaded with a charge so miscellaneous that the sable Manqua  grinned with satisfaction as he endeavoured to ram it home.    Meanwhile Mariano and Lucien placed the men, who were armed to the  teeth, at the gangways, and along the weather-side of the schooner, to  be in readiness to repel the foe when they should attempt to board.    There was no hesitation on the part of the pirates, although they saw  plainly the vigorous preparations which were being made to receive them.  Bearing down on the crippled vessel at full speed, in spite of the  bellowing discharge from the great gun, and a well-delivered volley of  small shot, which stretched many of them on the deck, they ran straight  against her, threw grappling-irons into the rigging, and sprang on board  with a fierce yell.    The melee that followed was sharp, but very short and decisive.  The  Sicilian crew fought with the courage of desperate men, but were almost  instantly overpowered by numbers.  Mariano had singled out the pirate  captain as his own special foe.  In making towards the spot where he  expected that he would board, he observed the tall Jew standing by the  wheel with his arms crossed on his breast, and regarding the attack with  apparent indifference.    \"What!\" cried Mariano, anger mingling with his surprise, \"do you stand  idle at such a moment?\"    \"You will miss your chance,\" returned Bacri, giving a glance and a nod  towards the side of the vessel where the pirate captain stood ready to  spring.    Almost at the instant that the brief hint was given, Mariano had sprung  to the bulwarks, and parried the thrust of a boarding-spike, which act  unfortunately disconcerted his aim in discharging his pistol.  Next  moment he had seized the pirate by the throat, and fell with him to the  deck, where a fierce struggle ensued.    We have said that the Sicilian youth was powerfully made, but the pirate  captain was more than a match for him in size, if not in courage;  nevertheless, the superior activity of Mariano, coupled with the fact  that he chanced to fall uppermost, gave him an advantage which would in  a few moments have cost the pirate his life, had not a blow from behind  rendered his youthful adversary insensible.    Rising hastily and regaining the yataghan which had fallen from his  grasp in the struggle, the pirate captain was about to rush again into  the fight, but, perceiving that although one or two of the schooner's  crew still showed resistance, his men were almost everywhere in  possession of the deck, he desisted, and turned with a look of surprise  to the man who had freed him from his antagonist.    \"_You_ here, Bacri!\" he said.  \"Truly my fate is a hard one when it  condemns me to be rescued by a dog of a Jew.\"    \"It might have been harder, Sidi Hassan, if it had condemned you to be  slain by the hand of a Christian,\" replied the Jew, with an air of  humility that scarcely harmonised with his towering height and his  breadth of shoulder.    Hassan uttered a short laugh, and was about to reply when a shout from  his men caused him to run to the forward part of the vessel, where  Francisco, Lucien, and the warlike negro already referred to were still  fighting desperately, surrounded by pirates, many of whom were badly  wounded.  It was well for the three heroes that their foes had  discharged all their pistols at the first rush.  Some of them, now  rendered furious by the unexpectedly successful opposition made by the  dauntless three, as well as by the smarting of their wounds, were  hastily re-loading their weapons, when their captain came forward.  It  was obvious that mercy or forbearance had been driven from their  breasts, and that a few seconds more would put a bloody end to the  unequal contest.    \"Spare them, Sidi Hassan,\" said the Jew in a deeply earnest tone.    \"Why should I spare them?\" returned the captain quietly; \"they deserve  to die, and such men would prove to be but troublesome slaves.\"    The Jew bent towards Hassan's ear and whispered.    \"Ha! sayest thou so?\" exclaimed the pirate, with a piercing glance at  his companion.  \"May I trust thee, Jew?\"    \"You may trust me,\" replied the Jew, apparently quite unmoved by the  insolent tones of the other.    \"Stand back, men!\" cried Hassan, springing between the combatants;  \"death by sword or pistol is too good for these Christian dogs; we shall  reserve them for something better.\"  Then, turning to Francisco, \"Lay  down your arms.\"    \"We will lay down our arms,\" answered the bluff merchant, who was not at  all sorry to obtain this brief period of breathing-time, \"when we have  laid you and a few more of your ruffians on the deck.\"    Hassan turned to his men and gave them an order in the Turkish language.    Several of them hurried aft, and immediately returned, dragging along  with them poor Mariano, who was just recovering from the blow given to  him by Bacri.  On seeing the plight of his father and brother he made a  desperate effort to free himself, but quickly found that he was as  helpless as a child in the grasp of the three powerful men who held him.    Hassan drew a pistol and put its muzzle to the youth's temple, then,  turning to Francisco, said:--    \"Lay down your arms, else I scatter his brains on the deck.  Take your  choice, but see that you be quick about it.\"    There was that in the pirate captain's tone and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21699"],[0,"The Rover of the Andes: A Tale of Adventure on South America (#2)"],[1,"home, then, cannot be far distant?\" remarked the Peruvian, with a  peculiar look that might have attracted the attention of the younger man  if his gaze had not at the moment been directed to the Indian girl, who,  during the foregoing conversation, had remained motionless on her mule  with her eyes looking pensively at the ground, like a beautiful statue  in bronze.    \"My home is close at hand,\" said the Englishman, when the question had  been repeated; \"unless memory plays me false, two more turns in the road  will reveal it.\"    The earnest look of the Peruvian deepened as he asked if the Estate of  Passamanka was his home.    \"Yes, you know it, then?\" exclaimed the youth eagerly; \"and perhaps you  knew my father too?\"    \"Yes, indeed; there are few people within a hundred miles of the place  who did not know the famous sugar-mill and its hospitable owner, Senhor  Armstrong.  But excuse me,\" added the Peruvian, with some hesitation,  \"you are aware, I suppose, that your father is dead?\"    \"Ay, well do I know that,\" returned the other in a deeper tone.  \"It is  to take my father's place at the mills that I have been hastily summoned  from England.  Alas!  I know nothing of the work, and it will be sorely  against the grain to attempt the carrying on of the old business in the  desolate old home.\"    \"Of course you also know,\" continued the Peruvian, \"that the country is  disturbed just now--that the old smouldering enmity between Chili and  Peru has broken forth again in open war.\"    \"I could not have passed through the low country without finding that  out.  Indeed,\" said the youth, glancing at his belt with a  half-apologetic smile, \"these weapons, which are so unfamiliar to my  hand, and so distasteful to my spirit, are proof that I, at least, do  not look for a time of peace.  I accoutred myself thus on landing, at  the urgent advice of a friend, though my good cudgel--which has sufficed  for all my needs hitherto--is more to my mind, besides being useful as a  mountain staff.  But why do you ask?  Is there much probability of the  belligerents coming so far among the hills?\"    \"Wherever carrion is to be found, there you may be sure the vultures  will congregate.  There is booty to be got here among the hills; and  whether the soldiers belong to the well-trained battalions of Chili, or  the wretched levies of Peru, they are always prepared, for plunder--  ready to make hay while the sun shines.  I only hope, Senhor Armstrong,  that--but come, let us advance and see before the sun sets.\"    Turning abruptly as he spoke, the man mounted his mule and rode briskly  up the winding road, followed by the Indian girl and our Englishman.    At the second turning of the road they reached a spot where an opening  in the hills revealed the level country below, stretching away into  illimitable distance.    As had been anticipated, they here came upon the mills they were in  quest of.  The Peruvian reined up abruptly and looked back.    \"I feared as much,\" he said in a low tone as the Englishman rode  forward.    Rendered anxious by the man's manner, Lawrence Armstrong sprang from his  mule and pushed forward, but suddenly stopped and stood with clasped  hands and a gaze of agony.    For there stood the ruins of his early home--where his mother had died  while he was yet a child, where his father had made a fortune, which, in  his desolation, he had failed to enjoy, and where he finally died,  leaving his possessions to his only child.    The troops had visited the spot, fired no doubt with patriotic fervour  and knowing its owner to be wealthy.  They had sacked the place, feasted  on the provisions, drunk the wines, smashed up, by way of pleasantry,  all the valuables that were too heavy to carry away, and, finally,  setting fire to the place, had marched off to other fields of \"glory.\"    It was a tremendous blow to poor Lawrence, coming as he did fresh from  college in a peaceful land, and full of the reminiscences of childhood.    Sitting down on a broken wall, he bowed his head and wept bitterly--  though silently--while the Peruvian, quietly retiring with the Indian  girl, left him alone.    The first paroxysm of grief over, young Armstrong rose, and began sadly  to wander about the ruins.  It had been an extensive structure, fitted  with all the most approved appliances of mechanism which wealth could  purchase.  These now helped to enhance the wild aspect of the wreck, for  iron girders had been twisted by the action of fire into snake-like  convolutions in some places, while, in others, their ends stuck out  fantastically from the blackened walls.  Beautiful furniture had been  smashed up to furnish firewood for the cooking of the meal with which  the heroic troops had refreshed themselves before leaving, while a  number of broken wine-bottles at the side of a rosewood writing-desk  with an empty bottle on the top of it and heaps of stones and pebbles  around, suggested the idea that the warriors had mingled light amusement  with sterner business.  The roofs of most of the buildings had fallen  in; the window-frames, where spared by the fire, had been torn out; and  a pianoforte, which lay on its back on the grass, showed evidence of  having undergone an examination of its internal arrangements, with the  aid of the butt-ends of muskets.    \"And this is the result of war!\" muttered the young man, at last  breaking silence.    \"Only one phase of it,\" replied a voice at his side, in tones of  exceeding bitterness; \"you must imagine a few corpses of slaughtered men  and women and children, if you would have a perfect picture of war.\"    The speaker was the Peruvian, who had quietly approached to say that if  they wished to reach the next resting-place before dark it was necessary  to proceed without delay.    \"But perhaps,\" he added, \"you do not intend to go further.  No doubt  this was to have been the end of your journey had all been well.  It can  scarcely, I fear, be the end of it now.  I do not wish to intrude upon  your sorrows, Mr Armstrong, but my business will not admit of delay.  I  must push on, yet I would not do so without expressing my profound  sympathy, and offering to aid you if it lies in my power.\"    There was a tone and look about the man which awoke a feeling of  gratitude and confidence in the forlorn youth's heart.    \"You are very kind,\" he said, \"but it is not in the power of man to help  me.  As your business is urgent you had better go and leave me.  I thank  you for the sympathy you express--yet stay.  You cannot advance much  further to-night, why not encamp here?  There used to be a small hut or  out-house not far-off, in which my father spent much of his leisure.  Perhaps the--the--\"    \"Patriots!\" suggested the Peruvian.    \"The scoundrels,\" said Lawrence, \"may have spared or overlooked it.  The  hut would furnish shelter enough, and we have provisions with us.\"    After a moment's reflection the Peruvian assented to this proposal, and,  leaving the ruins together, they returned to the road, where they found  the Indian girl holding the youth's mule as well as that of her  companion.    Hastening forward, Lawrence apologised for having in the agitation of  the moment allowed his mule to run loose.    \"But I forgot,\" he added, \"of course you do not understand English.\"    \"Try Spanish,\" suggested the Peruvian, \"she knows a little of that.\"    \"Unfortunately I have forgotten the little that I had picked up here  when a boy,\" returned Lawrence, as he mounted, \"if I can manage to ask  for food and lodging in that tongue, it is all that I can do.\"    They soon reached an opening in the bushes at the roadside, and, at the  further end of a natural glade or track, observed a small wooden hut  thatched with rushes.  Towards this young Armstrong led the way.    He was evidently much affected, for his lips were compressed, and he  gave no heed to a remark made by his companion.  Entering the hut, he  stood for some time looking silently round.    It was but a poor place with bare walls; a carpenter's bench in one  corner, near to it a smith's forge, one or two chairs, and a few  tools;--not much to interest a stranger but to Lawrence full of tender  associations.    \"It was here,\" he said in tones of deepest pathos, \"that my father  showed me how to handle tools, and my mother taught me to read from the  Word of God.\"    Looking at his companions he observed that the large dark eyes of the  Indian girl were fixed on him with an expression of unmistakable  sympathy.  He felt grateful at the moment, for to most men sympathy is  sweet when unobtrusively offered whether it come from rich or poor--  civilised or savage.    \"Come, this will do,\" said the Peruvian, looking round, \"if you will  kindle a fire on the forge, Senhor Armstrong, Manuela will arrange a  sleeping chamber for herself in the closet I see there, while I look  after the beasts.\"    He spoke in cheering tones, which had the effect of rousing the poor  youth somewhat from his despondency.    \"Well, then,\" he replied, \"let us to work, and it is but just, as we are  to sup together, and you know my name, that I should be put on an equal  footing with yourself--\"    \"Impossible!\" interrupted the other, with a slight curl of his  moustache, \"for as I am only six feet one, and you are at least six feet  four, we can never be on an equal footing.\"    \"Nay, but I referred to names, not to inches.  Pray, by what name shall  I call you?\"    \"Pedro,\" returned the Spaniard.  \"I am known by several names in these  parts--some of them complimentary, others the reverse, according as I am  referred to by friends or foes.  Men often speak of me as a confirmed  rover because of my wandering tendencies, but I'm not particular and  will answer to any name you choose, so long as it is politely uttered.  The one I prefer is Pedro.\"    He went out as he spoke to look after the mules, while Lawrence set  about kindling a small fire and"]]]
