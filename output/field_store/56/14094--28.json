[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20907"],[0,"The Best of the World's Classics,  Restricted to prose. Volume I (of X) - Greece (#2)"],[1,"Best of the World's Classics,\" and \"classics\" is used not in the  narrow and technical sense, but rather in that of Thoreau, who defined  classics as \"the noblest recorded thoughts of mankind.\" Therefore, the  first principle of guidance in selection is to take examples of the  great writings which have moved and influenced the thought of the  world, and which have preeminently the quality of \"high seriousness\"  as required by Aristotle. This test alone, however, would limit the  selections too closely. Therefore the second principle of choice is to  make selections from writers historically important either personally  or by their writings. The third rule is to endeavor to give selections  which shall be representative of the various literatures and the  various periods through which, the collection ranges. Lastly, and this  applies, of course, only to passages taken from the writers of England  and the United States, the effort has been to give specimens of the  masters of English prose, of that prose in its development and at its  best, and to show, so far as may be, what can be accomplished with  that great instrument, and what a fine style really is as exhibited in  the best models. Everything contained in these volumes is there in  obedience to one at least of these principles, many in obedience to  more than one, some in conformity to all four.    No one will become a scholar or a master of any of the great  literatures here represented by reading this collection. Literature  and scholarship are not to be had so cheaply as that. Yet is there  much profit to be had from these little volumes. They contain many  passages which merit Dr. Johnson's fine saying about books: \"That they  help us to enjoy life or teach us to endure it.\" To the man of  letters, to the man of wide reading, they will at least serve to  recall, when far from libraries and books, those authors who have been  the delight and the instructors of a lifetime. They will bring at  least the pleasures of memory and that keener pleasure which arises  when we meet a poem or a passage of prose which we know as an old and  well-loved friend, remote from home, upon some alien page.    To that larger public whose lives are not spent among books and  libraries, and for whose delectation such a collection as this is  primarily intended, these volumes rightly read at odd times, in idle  moments, in out-of-the-way places, on the ship or the train, offer  much. They will bring the reader in contact with many of the greatest  intellects of all time. They contain some of the noblest thoughts that  have passed through the minds of our weak and erring race. There is no  man who will not be the better, for the moment at least, by reading  what Cicero says about old age, Seneca about death, and Socrates  about love, to go no further for examples than to        \"The glory that was Greece,      And the grandeur that was Rome.\"    Moreover, the bowing acquaintance which can be formed here may easily  offer attractions which will lead to a close and intimate friendship,  with all that the word implies in the case of a great author or a  great book. It seems to me, for example, as if no one who read here  the too brief extracts from Erasmus or from Cervantes, to take at  random two writers widely separated in thought, could fail to pursue  the acquaintance thus begun, so potent are the sympathetic charm, the  wit, the wisdom and the humor of both these great men. There is, at  least, variety in these little volumes, and while many things in them  may not appeal to us, they may to our neighbors. That which \"is dumb  to us may speak to him.\"    Again, let it be noticed that there is much more than the \"high  seriousness\" which is the test of the greatest prose as of the finest  poetry. Humor and pathos, tragedy and comedy, all find their place and  glimpses of the pageant of human history flit through the pages. It  would seem as if it were impossible to read extracts from Thucydides  and Tacitus and Gibbon and not long to go to their histories and learn  all that could be said by such men about the life of man upon earth,  about Athens and Rome and the rise and fall of empires. Selections are  unsatisfying and the better they are the more unsatisfying they  become. But this is in reality their great merit. They have much  beauty in themselves, they awaken pleasant memories, they revive old  delights, but, above all, if rightly read they open the gates to the  illimitable gardens whence all the flowers which have here been  gathered may be found blooming in radiance, unplucked and unbroken and  rooted in their native soil.    The most important part of the collection is that which gives  selections from those writers whose native tongue is English. No  translation even of prose can ever quite reproduce its original, and  as a rule can not hope to equal it. There are many translations,  notably the Elizabethan, which are extremely fine in themselves and  memorable examples of English prose. Still they are not the original  writings. Something escapes in the translation into another tongue,  an impalpable something which can not be held or transmitted. The  Bible stands alone, a great literary monument of the noblest and most  beautiful English, which has formed English speech and become a part  of the language as it is of the thought and emotion of the people who  read \"King James'\" version in all parts of the globe. Yet we know that  the version which the people, so fortunate in its possession, wisely  and absolutely decline to give up in exchange for any revision is  neither an accurate nor a faithful reproduction of its original.  Therefore, putting aside the English Bible as wholly by itself, it may  be safely said that the soul of a language and the beauties of style  which it is capable of exhibiting can only be found and studied in the  productions of writers who not only think in the language in which  they write, but to whom that speech is native, the inalienable  birthright and heritage of their race or country. In such writers we  get not only the thought, the humor, or the pathos, all that can be  transferred in a translation, but also the pleasure to the ear akin to  music, the sense of form, the artistic gratification which form  brings, all those attributes which are possible in the highest degree  to those only to whom the language is native.    For these reasons, as will be readily understood, in making selections  from those writers whose native tongue is English, specimens have been  given of all periods from the earliest time and occasionally of  authors who would not otherwise find a place in such a collection, for  the purpose of tracing in outline the development of English prose and  the formation of an English style which, like all true and great  styles, is peculiar to the language and can not be reproduced in any  other. This is not the place, nor would it be feasible within any  reasonable limits to narrate the history of English prose. But in  these selections it is possible to follow its gradual advance from the  first rude and crude attempts through the splendid irregularities of  the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries to the establishment of a  standard of style in the eighteenth and thence onward to the  modifications and changes in that standard which extend to our own  time.    The purpose of this collection is not didactic. If it were it would be  a school-book and not an anthology in the Greek sense, where the  first principle was to seek what was of literary value, artistic in  expression, and noble in thought. Yet the mere bringing together of  examples of prose from the writings of the great masters of style can  not but teach a lesson never more needed than now.    I do not mean by this to suggest imitation of any writer. Nothing is  more dangerous, especially when the style of the writer imitated is  peculiar and strongly marked. That which is valuable and instructive  is the opportunity given here for a study of fine English styles, and  in this way to learn the capabilities of the language and the general  principles which have governed the production of the best English  prose. We have in the English language an unequaled richness of  vocabulary far surpassing in extent that of any other tongue. It  possesses a great literature and a body of poetry unrivaled in modern  times. It is not only one of the strongest bonds of union in the  United States, but it is the language in which our freedom was won and  in which our history and our laws are written. It is our greatest  heritage. To weaken, corrupt or deprave it would be a misfortune  without parallel to our entire people. Yet we can not disguise from  ourselves the fact that the fertility of the printing-press, the  multiplication of cheap magazines, and the flood of printed words  poured out daily in the newspapers all tend strongly in this  direction. This is an era of haste and hurry stimulated by the great  inventions which have changed human environment. Form and style in any  art require time, and time seems the one thing we can neither spare  nor wisely economize. Yet, in literature above all arts, to abandon  form and style is inevitably destructive and entails misfortunes which  can hardly be estimated, for loose, weak and vulgar writing is a sure  precursor of loose, weak and vulgar thinking. If form of expression is  cast aside, form in thought and in the presentation of thought is  certain to follow. Against all this the fine English prose amply  represented in these selections offers a silent and convincing protest  to every one who will read it attentively.    We can begin with the splendid prose of the age of Elizabeth and of  the seventeenth century. It is irregular and untamed, but exuberant  and brilliant, rich both in texture and substance. We find it at its  height in the strange beauties of Sir Thomas Browne, in the noble  pages of Milton, stiff"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20910"],[0,"South American Fights and Fighters, and Other Tales of Adventure (#2)"],[1,"of the Spanish Main begins in 1509, with the voyages of  Ojeda and Nicuesa, which were the first definite and authorized  attempts to colonize the mainland of South America.    The honor of being the first of the fifteenth-century {4} navigators to  set foot upon either of the two American continents, indisputably  belongs to John Cabot, on June 24, 1497.  Who was next to make a  continental landfall, and in the more southerly latitudes, is a  question which lies between Columbus and Amerigo Vespucci.    Fiske, in a very convincing argument awards the honor to Vespucci,  whose first voyage (May 1497 to October 1498) carried him from the  north coast of Honduras along the Gulf coast around Florida, and  possibly as far north as the Chesapeake Bay, and to the Bahamas on his  return.    Markham scouts this claim.  Winsor neither agrees nor dissents.  His  verdict in the case is a Scottish one, \"Not proven.\"  Who shall decide  when the doctors disagree?  Let every one choose for himself.  As for  me, I am inclined to agree with Fiske.    If it were not Vespucci, it certainly was Columbus on his third voyage  (1498-1500).  On this voyage, the chief of the navigators struck the  South American shore off the mouth of the Orinoco and sailed westward  along it for a short distance before turning to the northward.  There  he found so many pearls that he called it the \"Pearl Coast.\"  It is  interesting to note that, however the question may be decided, all the  honors go to Italy.  Columbus was a Genoese.  Cabot, although born in  Genoa, had lived many years in Venice and had been made a citizen  there; while Vespucci was a Florentine.    The first important expedition along the northern coast of South  America was that of Ojeda in 1499-1500, in company with Juan de la  Cosa, next to Columbus the most expert navigator and pilot of the age,  and Vespucci, perhaps his equal in nautical science as he {5} was his  superior in other departments of polite learning.  There were several  other explorations of the Gulf coast, and its continuations on every  side, during the same year, by one of the Pizons, who had accompanied  Columbus on his first voyage; by Lepe; by Cabral, a Portuguese, and by  Bastidas and La Cosa, who went for the first time as far to the  westward as Porto Rico on the Isthmus of Darien.    On the fourth and last voyage of Columbus, he reached Honduras and  thence sailed eastward and southward to the Gulf of Darien, having not  the least idea that the shore line which he called Veragua was in fact  the border of the famous Isthmus of Panama.  There were a number of  other voyages, including a further exploration by La Cosa and Vespucci,  and a second by Ojeda in which an abortive attempt was made to found a  colony; but most of the voyages were mere trading expeditions,  slave-hunting enterprises or searches, generally fruitless, for gold  and pearls.  Ojeda reported after one of these voyages that the English  were on the coast.  Who these English were is unknown.  The news,  however, was sufficiently disquieting to Ferdinand, the Catholic--and  also the Crafty!--who now ruled alone in Spain, and he determined to  frustrate any possible English movement by planting colonies on the  Spanish Main.      II. The Don Quixote of Discoveries and His Rival    Instantly two claimants for the honor of leading such an expedition  presented themselves.  The first Alonzo de Ojeda, the other Diego de  Nicuesa.  Two more extraordinary characters never went knight-erranting  upon the seas.  Ojeda was one of the {6} prodigious men of a time which  was fertile in notable characters.  Although small in stature, he was a  man of phenomenal strength and vigor.  He could stand at the foot of  the Giralda in Seville and throw an orange over it, a distance of two  hundred and fifty feet from the earth![1]    Wishing to show his contempt for danger, on one occasion he ran out on  a narrow beam projecting some twenty feet from the top of the same  tower and there, in full view of Queen Isabella and her court,  performed various gymnastic exercises, such as standing on one leg, _et  cetera_, for the edification of the spectators, returning calmly and  composedly to the tower when he had finished the exhibition.    He was a magnificent horseman, an accomplished knight and an able  soldier.  There was no limit to his daring.  He went with Columbus on  his second voyage, and, single-handed, effected the capture of a  powerful Indian cacique named Caonabo, by a mixture of adroitness,  audacity and courage.    Professing amity, he got access to the Indian, and, exhibiting some  polished manacles, which he declared were badges of royalty, he offered  to put them on the fierce but unsophisticated savage and then mount the  chief on his own horse to show him off like a Spanish monarch to his  subjects.  The daring programme was carried out just exactly as it had  been planned.  When Ojeda had got the forest king safely fettered and  mounted on his horse, he sprang up behind him, held him there firmly in  spite of his efforts, and galloped off to Columbus with his astonished  and disgusted captive.    [Illustration: \"Ojeda Galloped Off with His Astonished Captive\"]    {7}    Neither of the voyages was successful.  With all of his personal  prowess, he was an unsuccessful administrator.  He was poor, not to say  penniless.  He had two powerful friends, however.  One was Bishop  Fonseca, who was charged with the administration of affairs in the  Indies, and the other was stout old Juan de la Cosa.  These two men  made a very efficient combination at the Spanish court, especially as  La Cosa had some money and was quite willing to put it up, a prime  requisite for the mercenary and niggardly Ferdinand's favor.    [Illustration: \"The Indians Poured a Rain of Poisoned Arrows\"]    The other claimant for the honor of leading the colony happened to be  another man small in stature, but also of great bodily strength,  although he scarcely equalled his rival in that particular.  Nicuesa  had made a successful voyage to the Indies with Ovando, and had ample  command of means.  He was a gentleman by birth and station--Ojeda was  that also--and was grand carver-in-chief to the King's uncle!  Among  his other qualities for successful colonization were a beautiful voice,  a masterly touch on the guitar and an exquisite skill in equitation.  He had even taught his horse to keep time to music.  Whether or not he  played that music himself on the back of the performing steed is not  recorded.    Ferdinand was unable to decide between the rival claimants.  Finally he  determined to send out two expeditions.  The Gulf of Uraba, now called  the Gulf of Darien, was to be the dividing line between the two  allotments of territory.  Ojeda was to have that portion extending from  the Gulf to the Cape de la Vela, which is just west of the Gulf of  Venezuela.  This territory was named new Andalusia.  Nicuesa was to  take that between the Gulf and the Cape Gracias a Dios off {8}  Honduras.  This section was denominated Golden Castile.  Each governor  was to fit out his expedition at his own charges.  Jamaica was given to  both in common as a point of departure and a base of supplies.    The resources of Ojeda were small, but when he arrived at Santo Domingo  with what he had been able to secure in the way of ships and men, he  succeeded in inducing a lawyer named Encisco, commonly called the  Bachelor[2] Encisco, to embark his fortune of several thousand gold  castellanos, which he had gained in successful pleadings in the court  in the litigious West Indies, in the enterprise.  In it he was given a  high position, something like that of District Judge.    With this reenforcement, Ojeda and La Cosa equipped two small ships and  two brigantines containing three hundred men and twelve horses.[3]    They were greatly chagrined when the imposing armada of Nicuesa,  comprising four ships of different sizes, but much larger than any of  Ojeda's, and two brigantines carrying seven hundred and fifty men,  sailed into the harbor of Santo Domingo.    The two governors immediately began to quarrel.  Ojeda finally  challenged Nicuesa to a duel which should determine the whole affair.  Nicuesa, who had everything to lose and nothing to gain by fighting,  but who could not well decline the challenge, said that he was willing  to fight him if Ojeda would put up what would popularly be known to-day  in the pugilistic {9} circles as \"a side bet\" of five thousand  castellanos to make the fight worth while.[4]    Poor Ojeda could not raise another maravedi, and as nobody would stake  him, the duel was off.  Diego Columbus, governor of Hispaniola, also  interfered in the game to a certain extent by declaring that the Island  of Jamaica was his, and that he would not allow anybody to make use of  it.  He sent there one Juan de Esquivel, with a party of men to take  possession of it.  Whereupon Ojeda stoutly declared that when he had  time he would stop at that island and if Esquivel were there, he would  cut off his head.    Finally on the 10th of November, 1509, Ojeda set sail, leaving Encisco  to bring after him another ship with needed supplies.  With Ojeda was  Francisco Pizarro, a middle-aged soldier of fortune, who had not  hitherto distinguished himself in any way.  Hernando Cortez was to have  gone along also, but fortunately for him, an inflammation of the knee  kept him at home.  Ojeda was in such a hurry to get to El Dorado--for  it was in the territory to the southward of his allotment, that the  mysterious city was supposed to be located--that he did not stop at  Jamaica to take off Esquivel's head--a good thing for him, as it  subsequently turned out.    Nicuesa would have followed Ojeda immediately, but his prodigal  generosity had exhausted even his large resources, and he was detained  by clamorous creditors, the law of the island being that no one could  leave it "]]]
