In general the Bulgarian winter  is short and severe; the spring short, changeable and rainy; the summer  hot, but tempered by thunderstorms; the autumn (_yasen_, \"the clear time\")  magnificently fine and sometimes prolonged into the month of December. The  mean temperature is 52 deg.. The climate is healthy, especially in the  mountainous districts. Malarial fever prevails in the valley of the  Maritza, in the low-lying regions of the Black Sea coast, and even in the  upland plain of Sofia, owing to neglect of drainage. The mean annual  rainfall is 25-59 in. (Gabrovo, 41-73; Sofia, 27-68; Varna, 18-50).    _Fauna._--Few special features are noticeable in the Bulgarian fauna. Bears  are still abundant in the higher mountain districts, especially in the  Rilska Planina and Rhodope; the Bulgarian bear is small and of brown  colour, like that of the Carpathians. Wolves are very numerous, and in  winter commit great depredations even in the larger country towns and  villages; in hard weather they have been known to approach the outskirts of  Sofia. The government offers a reward for the destruction of both these  animals. The roe deer is found in all the forests, the red deer is less  common; the chamois haunts the higher regions of the Rilska Planina,  Rhodope and the Balkans. The jackal (_Canis aureus_) appears in the  district of Burgas; the lynx is said to exist in the Sredna Gora; the wild  boar, otter, fox, badger, hare, wild cat, marten, polecat (_Foetorius  putorius_; the rare tiger polecat, _Foetorius sarmaticus_, is also found),  weasel and shrewmouse (_Spermophilus citillus_) are common. The beaver  (Bulg. _bebr_) appears to have been abundant in certain localities, _e.g._  Bebrovo, Bebresh, &c., but it is now apparently extinct. Snakes (_Coluber  natrix_ and other species), vipers (_Vipera berus_ and _V. ammodytes_), and  land and water tortoises are numerous. The domestic animals are the same as  in the other countries of southeastern Europe; the fierce shaggy grey  sheep-dog leaves a lasting impression on most travellers in the interior.  Fowls, especially turkeys, are everywhere abundant, and great numbers of  geese may be seen in the Moslem villages. The ornithology of Bulgaria is  especially interesting. Eagles (_Aquila imperialis_ and the rarer _Aquila  fulva_), vultures (_Vultur monachus_, _Gyps fulvus_, _Neophron  percnopterus_), owls, kites, and the smaller birds of prey are  extraordinarily abundant; singing birds are consequently rare. The  lammergeier (_Gypaetus barbatus_) is not uncommon. Immense flocks of wild  swans, geese, pelicans, herons and other waterfowl haunt the Danube and the  lagoons of the Black Sea coast. The cock of the woods (_Tetrao urogallus_)  is found in the Balkan and Rhodope forests, the wild pheasant in the Tunja  valley, the bustard (_Otis tarda_) in the Eastern Rumelian plain. Among the  migratory birds are the crane, which hibernates in the Maritza valley,  woodcock, snipe and quail; the great spotted cuckoo (_Coccystes  glandarius_) is an occasional visitant. The red starling (_Pastor roseus_)  sometimes appears in large flights. The stork, which is never molested,  adds a picturesque feature to the Bulgarian village. Of fresh-water fish,  the sturgeon (_Acipenser sturio_ and _A. huso_), sterlet, salmon (_Salmo  hucho_), and carp are found in the Danube; the mountain streams abound in  trout. The Black Sea supplies turbot, mackerel, &c.; dolphins and flying  fish may sometimes be seen.    _Flora._--In regard to its flora the country may be divided into (1) the  northern plain sloping from the Balkans to the Danube, (2) the southern  plain between the Balkans and Rhodope, (3) the districts adjoining the  Black Sea, (4) the elevated basins of Sofia, Samakov and Kiustendil, (5)  the Alpine and sub-Alpine regions of the Balkans and the southern mountain  group. In the first-mentioned region the vegetation resembles that of the  Russian and Rumanian steppes; in the spring the country is adorned with the  flowers of the crocus, orchis, iris, tulip and other bulbous plants, which  in summer give way to tall grasses, umbelliferous growths, _dianthi_,  _astragali_, &c. In the more sheltered district south of the Balkans the  richer vegetation recalls that of the neighbourhood of Constantinople and  the adjacent parts of Asia Minor. On the Black Sea coast many types of the  Crimean, Transcaucasian and even the Mediterranean flora present  themselves. The plateaus of Sofia and Samakov furnish specimens of  sub-alpine plants, while the vine disappears; the hollow of Kiustendil,  owing to its southerly aspect, affords the vegetation of the Macedonian  valleys. The flora of the Balkans corresponds with that of the Carpathians;  the Rila and Rhodope group is rich in purely indigenous types combined with  those of the central European Alps and the mountains of Asia Minor. The  Alpine types are often represented by variants: _e.g._ the _Campanula  alpina_ by the _Campanula orbelica_, the _Primula farinosa_ by the _Primula  frondosa_ and _P. exigua_, the _Gentiana germanica_ by the _Gentiana  bulgarica_, &c. The southern mountain group, in common, perhaps, with the  unexplored highlands of Macedonia, presents many isolated types, unknown  elsewhere in Europe, and in some cases corresponding with those of the  Caucasus. Among the more characteristic genera of the Bulgarian flora are  the following:--_Centaurea_, _Cirsium_, _Linaria_, _Scrophularia_,  _Verbascum_, _Dianthus_, _Silene_, _Trifolium_, _Euphorbia_, _Cytisus_,  _Astragalus_, _Ornithogalum_, _Allium_, _Crocus_, _Iris_, _Thymus_,  _Umbellifera_, _Sedum_, _Hypericum_, _Scabiosa_, _Ranunculus_, _Orchis_,  _Ophrys_.    _Forests._--The principal forest trees are the oak, beech, ash, elm,  walnut, cornel, poplar, pine and juniper. The oak is universal in the  thickets, but large specimens are now rarely found. Magnificent forests of  beech clothe the valleys of the higher Balkans and the Rilska Planina; the  northern declivity of the Balkans is, in general, well wooded, but the  southern slope is bare. The walnut and chestnut are mainly confined to  eastern Rumelia. Conifers (_Pinus silvestris_, _Picea excelsa_, _Pinus  laricis_, _Pinus mughus_) are rare in the Balkans, but abundant in the  higher regions of the southern mountain group, where the _Pinus peuce_,  otherwise peculiar to the Himalayas, also flourishes. The wild lilac forms  a beautiful feature in the spring landscape. Wild fruit trees, such as the  apple, pear and plum, are common. The vast forests of the middle ages  disappeared under the supine Turkish administration, which took no measures  for their protection, and even destroyed the woods in the neighbourhood of  towns and highways in order to deprive brigands of shelter. A law passed in  1889 prohibits disforesting, limits the right of cutting timber, and places  the state forests under the control of inspectors. According to official  statistics, 11,640 sq. m. or about 30% of the whole superficies of the  kingdom, are under forest, but the greater portion of this area is covered  only by brushwood and scrub. The beautiful forests of the Rila district are  rapidly disappearing under exploitation.    _Agriculture._--Agriculture, the main source of wealth to the country, is  still in an extremely primitive condition. The ignorance and conservatism  of the peasantry, the habits engendered by widespread insecurity and the  fear of official rapacity under Turkish rule, insufficiency of  communications, want of capital, and in some districts sparsity of  population, have all tended to retard the development of this most  important industry. The peasants cling to traditional usage, and look with  suspicion on modern implements and new-fangled modes of production. The  plough is of a primeval type, rotation of crops is only partially  practised, and the use of manure is almost unknown. The government has  sedulously endeavoured to introduce more enlightened methods and ideas by  the establishment of agricultural schools, the appointment of itinerant  professors and inspectors, the distribution of better kinds of seeds,  improved implements, &c. Efforts have been made to improve the breeds of  native cattle and horses, and stallions have been introduced from Hungary  and distributed throughout the country. Oxen and buffaloes are the  principal animals of draught; the buffalo, which was apparently introduced  from Asia in remote times, is much prized by the peasants for its patience  and strength; it is, however, somewhat delicate and requires much care. In  [v.04 p.0775] the eastern districts camels are also employed. The Bulgarian  horses are small, but remarkably hardy, wiry and intelligent; they are as a  rule unfitted for draught and cavalry purposes. The best sheep are found in  the district of Karnobat in Eastern Rumelia. The number of goats in the  country tends to decline, a relatively high tax being imposed on these  animals owing to the injury they inflict on young trees. The average price  of oxen is L5 each, draught oxen L12 the pair, buffaloes L14 the pair, cows  L2, horses L6, sheep, 7s., goats 5s., each. The principal cereals are  wheat, maize, rye, barley, oats and millet. The cultivation of maize is  increasing in the Danubian and eastern districts. Rice-fields are found in  the neighbourhood of Philippopolis. Cereals represent about 80% of the  total exports. Besides grain, Bulgaria produces wine, tobacco, attar of  roses, silk and cotton. The quality of the grape is excellent, and could  the peasants be induced to abandon their highly primitive mode of  wine-making the Bulgarian vintages would rank among the best European  growths. The tobacco, which is not of the highest quality, is grown in  considerable quantities for home consumption and only an"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19850"],[0,"The Human Side of Animals (#2)"],[1,"less degree by an African ape  when his mate is shot dead by a Christian missionary. The grandmother  sheep that watches her numerous little lamb grandchildren on the  hillside, while their mothers are away grazing, is just as mindful of  their care as any human grandparent could be. One drop of water is like  the ocean; and love is love.    The trouble with science is that too often it leaves out love. If you  agree that we cannot treat men like machines, why should we put animals  in that class? Why should we fall into the colossal ignorance and  conceit of cataloging every human-like action of animals under the word  \"instinct\"? Man delights in thinking of himself as only a little lower  than the angels. Then why should he not consider the animals as only a  little lower than himself? The poet has truly said that \"the beast is  the mirror of man as man is the mirror of God.\" Man had to battle with  animals for untold ages before he domesticated and made servants of  them. He is just beginning to learn that they were not created solely to  furnish material for sermons, nor to serve mankind, but that they also  have an existence, a life of their own.    Man has long preached this doctrine that he is not an animal, but a  kinsman of the gods. For this reason, he has claimed dominion over  animal creation and a right to assert that dominion without restraint.  This anthropocentric conceit is the same thing that causes one nation to  think it should rule the world, that the sun and moon were made only for  the laudable purpose of giving light unto a chosen few, and that young  lambs playing on a grassy hillside, near a cool spring, are just so much  mutton allowed to wander over man's domain until its flavour is  improved.    It is time to remove the barriers, once believed impassable, which man's  egotism has used as a screen to separate him from his lower brothers.  Our physical bodies are very similar to theirs except that ours are  almost always much inferior. Merely because we have a superior intellect  which enables us to rule and enslave the animals, shall we deny them all  intellect and all feeling? In the words of that remarkable naturalist,  William J. Long, \"To call a thing intelligence in one creature and  reflex action in another, or to speak of the same thing as love or  kindness in one and blind impulse in the other, is to be blinder  ourselves than the impulse which is supposed to govern animals. Until,  therefore, we have some new chemistry that will ignore atoms and the  atomic law, and some new psychology that ignores animal intelligence  altogether, or regards it as under a radically different law from our  own, we must apply what we know of ourselves and our own motives to the  smaller and weaker lives that are in some distant way akin to our own.\"    It is possible to explain away all the marvellous things the animals do,  but after you have finished, there will still remain something over and  above, which quite defies all mechanistic interpretation. An old war  horse, for instance, lives over and over his battles in his dreams. He  neighs and paws, just as he did in real battle; and cavalrymen tell us  that they can sometimes understand from their horses when they are  dreaming just what command they are trying to obey. This is only one of  the myriads of animal phenomena which man does not understand. If you  doubt it, try to explain the striking phenomena of luminescence,  hybridization, of eels surviving desiccation for fourteen years,  post-matrimonial cannibalism, Nature's vast chain of unities, the  suicide of lemmings, why water animals cannot get wet, transparency of  animals, why the horned toad shoots a stream of blood from his eye when  angry. If you are able to explain these things to humanity, you will be  classed second only to Solomon. Yet the average scientist explains them  away, with the ignorance and loquaciousness of a fisher hag.    By a thorough application of psychological principles, it is possible  to show that man himself is merely a machine to be explained in terms of  neurones and nervous impulses, heredity and environment and reactions to  outside stimuli. But who is there who does not believe that there is  more to a man than that?    Animals have demonstrated long ago that they not only have as many  talents as human beings, but that under the influence of the same  environment, they form the same kinds of combinations to defend  themselves against enemies; to shelter themselves against heat and cold;  to build homes; to lay up a supply of food for the hard seasons. In  fact, all through the ages man has been imitating the animals in  burrowing through the earth, penetrating the waters, and now, at last,  flying through the air.    When a skunk bites through the brains of frogs, paralysing but not  killing them, in order that he may store them away in his nursery-pantry  so that his babes may have fresh food; when a mole decapitates  earth-worms for the same reason and stores them near the cold surface of  the ground so that the heads will not regrow, as they would under normal  conditions, only a deeply prejudiced man can claim that no elements of  intelligence have been employed.    There are also numerous signs, sounds and motions by which animals  communicate with each other, though to man these symbols of language may  not always be understandable. Dogs give barks indicating surprise,  pleasure and all other emotions. Cows will bellow for days when mourning  for their dead. The mother bear will bury her dead cub and silently  guard its grave for weeks to prevent its being desecrated. The mother  sheep will bleat most pitifully when her lamb strays away. Foxes utter  expressive cries which their children know full well. The chamois, when  frightened, whistle; they might be termed the policemen of the animal  world. The sentinel will continue a long, drawn-out whistle, as long as  he can without taking a breath. He then stops for a brief moment, looks  in all directions, and begins blowing again. If the danger comes too  near, he scampers away.    In their ability to take care of their wounded bodies, in their reading  of the weather and in all forms of woodcraft, animals undoubtedly  possess superhuman powers. Even squirrels can prophesy an unusually long  and severe winter and thus make adequate preparations. Some animals act  as both barometers and thermometers. It is claimed that while frogs  remain yellow, only fair weather may be expected, but if their colour  changes to brown, ill weather is coming.    There is no limit to the marvellous things animals do. Elephants, for  example, carry leafy palms in their trunks to shade themselves from the  hot sun. The ape or baboon who puts a stone in the open oyster to  prevent it from closing, or lifts stones to crack nuts, or beats his  fellows with sticks, or throws heavy cocoanuts from trees upon his  enemies, or builds a fire in the forest, shows more than a glimmer of  intelligence. In the sly fox that puts out fish heads to bait hawks, or  suddenly plunges in the water and immerses himself to escape hunters, or  holds a branch of a bush over his head and actually runs with it to hide  himself; in the wolverine who catches deer by dropping moss, and  suddenly springing upon them and clawing their eyes out; in the bear,  who, as told in the account of Cook's third voyage, \"rolls down pieces  of rock to crush stags; in the rat when he leads his blind brother with  a stick\" is actual reasoning. Indeed, there is nothing which man makes  with all his ingenious use of tools and instruments, of which some  suggestion may not be seen in animal creation.    Great thinkers of all ages are not wanting who believe that animals have  a portion of that same reason which is the pride of man. Montaigne  admitted that they had both thought and reason, and Pope believed that  even a cat may consider a man made for his service. Humboldt, Helvitius,  Darwin and Smellie claimed that animals act as a definite result of  actual reasoning. Lord Brougham pertinently observes, \"I know not why so  much unwillingness should be shown by some excellent philosophers to  allow intelligent faculties and a share of reason to the lower animals,  as if our own superiority was not quite sufficiently established to  leave all jealousy out of view by the immeasurably higher place which we  occupy in the scale of being.\"    From the facts enumerated in this book I find that animals are possessed  of love, hate, joy, grief, courage, revenge, pain, pleasure, want and  satisfaction--that all things that go to make up man's life are also  found in them. In the attempt to establish this thesis I have been led  mentally and physically into some of Nature's most fascinating highways  and hedges, where I have had many occasions to wonder and adore. I will  be happy if I have at least added something to the depth of love and  appreciation with which most men look upon the animal world.
