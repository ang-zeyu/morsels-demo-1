If it was, I guess your Uncle  Dick's check would have to have four figures in it before you could  make a deal. But this is one of Chief's daughters. This is Rothsay  Lass. A grand little girl, ain't she? Say,\"--in a confidential  whisper,--\"since you've took a fancy for her, maybe I could coax the  old man into lettin' you have her at an easy price. He was plannin' to  sell her for a hundred or so. But he goes pretty much by what I say. He  might let her go for--How much of a check did you say your uncle sent  you?\"    \"Twelve dollars,\" answered the boy,--\"one for each year. Because I'm  named for him. It's my birthday, you know. But--but a dollar of it went  for the chain and the collar. How much do you suppose the gentleman  would want for Rothsay Lass?\"    The kennel-man considered for a moment. Then he went back to the house,  leaving the lad alone at the gate of the run. Eleven dollars, for a  high-pedigreed collie pup, was a joke price. But no one else wanted  Lass, and her feed was costing more every day. According to Rothsay  standards, the list of brood-females was already complete. Even as a  gift, the kennels would be making money by getting rid of the  prick-eared \"second.\" Wherefore he went to consult with the foreman.    Left alone with Lass, the boy opened the gate and went into the run. A  little to his surprise Lass neither shrank from him nor attacked him.  She danced about his legs in delight, varying this by jumping up and  trying to lick his excited face. Then she thrust her cold nose into the  cup of his hand as a plea to be petted.    When the kennel-man came back, the boy was sitting on the dusty ground  of the run, and Lass was curled up rapturously in his lap, learning how  to shake hands at his order.    \"You can have her, the boss says,\" vouchsafed the kennel-man. \"Where's  the eleven dollars?\"    By this graceless speech Dick Hazen received the key to the Seventh  Paradise, and a life-membership in the world-wide Order of Dog-Lovers.    The homeward walk, for Lass and her new master, was no walk at all, but  a form of spiritual levitation. The half-mile pilgrimage consumed a  full hour of time. Not that Lass hung back or rebelled at her first  taste of collar and chain! These petty annoyances went unfelt in the  wild joy of a real walk, and in the infinitely deeper happiness of  knowing her friendship-famine was appeased at last.    The walk was long for various reasons--partly because, in her frisking  gyrations, Lass was forever tangling the new chain around Dick's thin  ankles; partly because he stopped, every block or so, to pat her or to  give her further lessons in the art of shaking hands. Also there were  admiring boy-acquaintances along the way, to whom the wonderful pet  must be exhibited.    At last Dick turned in at the gate of a cheap bungalow on a cheap  street--a bungalow with a discouraged geranium plot in its  pocket-handkerchief front yard, and with a double line of drying  clothes in the no larger space behind the house.    As Dick and his chum rounded the house, a woman emerged from between  the two lines of flapping sheets, whose hanging she had been  superintending. She stopped at sight of her son and the dog.    \"Oh!\" she commented with no enthusiasm at all. \"Well, you did it, hey?  I was hoping you'd have better sense, and spend your check on a nice  new suit or something. He's kind of pretty, though,\" she went on, the  puppy's friendliness and beauty wringing the word of grudging praise  from her. \"What kind of a dog is he? And you're sure he isn't savage,  aren't you?\"    \"Collie,\" answered Dick proudly. \"Pedigreed collie! You bet she isn't  savage, either. Why, she's an angel. She minds me already. See--shake  hands, Lass!\" \"Lass!\" ejaculated Mrs. Hazen. \"'SHE!' Dick, you don't  mean to tell me you've gone and bought yourself a--a FEMALE dog?\"    The woman spoke in the tone of horrified contempt that might well have  been hers had she found a rattlesnake and a brace of toads in her son's  pocket. And she lowered her voice, as is the manner of her kind when  forced to speak of the unspeakable. She moved back from the puppy's  politely out-thrust forepaw as from the passing of a garbage cart.    \"A female dog!\" she reiterated. \"Well, of all the chuckle-heads! A  nasty FEMALE dog, with your birthday money!\"    \"She's not one bit nasty!\" flamed Dick, burying the grubby fingers of  his right hand protectively in the fluffy mass of the puppy's  half-grown ruff. \"She's the dandiest dog ever! She--\"    \"Don't talk back to me!\" snapped Mrs. Hazen. \"Here! Turn right around  and take her to the cheats who sold her to you. Tell them to keep her  and give you the good money you paid for her. Take her out of my yard  this minute! Quick!\"    A hot mist of tears sprang into the boy's eyes. Lass, with the queer  intuition that tells a female collie when her master is unhappy, whined  softly and licked his clenched hand.    \"I--aw, PLEASE, Ma!\" he begged chokingly. \"PLEASE! It's--it's my  birthday, and everything. Please let me keep her. I--I love her better  than 'most anything there is. Can't I please keep her? Please!\"    \"You heard what I said,\" returned his mother curtly.    The washerwoman, who one day a week lightened Mrs. Hazen's household  labors, waddled into view from behind the billows of wind-swirled  clothes. She was an excellent person, and was built for endurance  rather than for speed. At sight of Lass she paused in real interest.    \"My!\" she exclaimed with flattering approval. \"So you got your dog, did  you? You didn't waste no time. And he's sure a handsome little critter.  Whatcher goin' to call him?\"    \"It's not a him, Irene,\" contradicted Mrs. Hazen, with another modest  lowering of her strong voice. \"It's a HER. And I'm sending Dick back  with her, to where she came from. I've got my opinion of people who  will take advantage of a child's ignorance, by palming off a horrid  female dog on him, too. Take her away, Dick. I won't have her here  another minute. You hear me?\"    \"Please, Ma!\" stammered Dick, battling with his desire to cry. \"Aw,  PLEASE! I--I--\"    \"Your ma's right, Dick,\" chimed in the washerwoman, her first  interested glance at the puppy changing to one of refined and lofty  scorn. \"Take her back. You don't want any female dogs around. No nice  folks do.\"    \"Why not?\" demanded the boy in sudden hopeless anger as he pressed  lovingly the nose Lass thrust so comfortingly into his hand. \"WHY don't  we want a female dog around? Folks have female cats around them, and  female women. Why isn't a female dog--\"    \"That will do, Dick!\" broke in his shocked mother. \"Take her away.\"    \"I won't,\" said the boy, speaking very slowly, and with no excitement  at all.    A slap on the side of his head, from his mother's punitive palm, made  him stagger a little. Her hand was upraised for a second installment of  rebellion-quelling--when a slender little body flashed through the air  and landed heavily against her chest. A set of white puppy-teeth all  but grazed her wrathful red face.    Lass, who never before had known the impulse to attack, had jumped to  the rescue of the beaten youngster whom she had adopted as her god. The  woman screeched in terror. Dick flung an arm about the furry whirlwind  that was seeking to avenge his punishment, and pulled the dog back to  his side.    Mrs. Hazen's shriek, and the obbligato accompaniment of the  washerwoman, made an approaching man quicken his steps as he strolled  around the side of the house. The newcomer was Dick's father,  superintendent of the local bottling works. On his way home to lunch,  he walked in on a scene of hysteria.    \"Kill her, sir!\" bawled the washerwoman, at sight of him. \"Kill her!  She's a mad dog. She just tried to kill Miz' Hazen!\"    \"She didn't do anything of the kind!\" wailed Dick. \"She was pertecting  me. Ma hit me; and Lass--\"    \"Ed!\" tearily proclaimed Mrs. Hazen, \"if you don't send for a policeman  to shoot that filthy beast, I'll--\"    \"Hold on!\" interrupted the man, at a loss to catch the drift of these  appeals, by reason of their all being spoken in a succession so rapid  as to make a single blurred sentence. \"Hold on! What's wrong? And where  did the pup come from? He's a looker, all right a cute little cuss.  What's the row?\"    With the plangently useless iterations of a Greek chorus, the tale was  flung at him, piecemeal and in chunks, and in a triple key. When  presently he understood, Hazen looked down for a moment at the  puppy--which was making sundry advances of a shy but friendly nature  toward him. Then he looked at the boy, and noted Dick's hero-effort to  choke back the onrush of babyish sobs. And then, with a roughly  tolerant gesture, he silenced the two raucous women, who were beginning  the tale over again for the third time.    \"I see,\" he said. \"I see. I see how it is. Needn't din it at me any  more, folks. And I see Dicky's side of it, too. Yes, and I see the  pup's side of it. I know a lot about dogs. That pup isn't vicious. She  knows she belongs to Dick. You lammed into him, and she took up and  defended him. That's all there is to the 'mad-dog' part of it.\"    \"But Ed--\" sputtered his wife.    \"Now, you let ME do the talking, Sade!\" he insisted, half-grinning, yet  more than half grimly. \"I'm the boss here. If I'm not, then it's safe  to listen to me till the boss gets here. And we're goin' to do whatever  I say we are--without any back-talk or sulks, either. It's this way:  Your brother gave the boy a birthday check. We promised he could spend  it any way he had a mind to. He said he wanted a dog, didn't he? And I  said, 'Go to it!' didn't I? Well, he got the dog. Just because it  happens to be a she, that's no reason why he oughtn't to be allowed to  keep it. And he can."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2392"],[0,"Further Adventures of Lad (#2)"],[1,"for all concerned,--was within call. At her sharp  summons the puppy wheeled, midway in his charge, and trotted back to  her. Severely, yet trying not to laugh at his worried aspect, she  scolded Lad for his misdeed.    An hour later, as Lad was scampering ahead of her, past the stables,  they rounded a corner and came flush upon the same nerve-wrecked hen  and her brood. Lad halted in his scamper, with a suddenness that made  him skid. Then, walking as though on eggs, he made an idiotically wide  circle about the feathered dam and her silly chicks. Never thereafter  did he assail any of the Place's fowls.    It was the same, when he sprang up merrily at a line of laundry,  flapping in alluring invitation from the drying ground lines. A single  word of rebuke,--and thenceforth the family wash was safe from him.    And so on with the myriad perplexing \"Don'ts\" which spatter the career  of a fun-loving collie pup. Versed in the patience-fraying ways of pups  in general, the Mistress and the Master marveled and bragged and  praised.    All day and every day, life was a delight to the little dog. He had  friends everywhere, willing to romp with him. He had squirrels to  chase, among the oaks. He had the lake to splash ecstatically in: He  had all he wanted to eat; and he had all the petting his hungry little  heart could crave.    He was even allowed, with certain restrictions, to come into the  mysterious house itself. Nor, after one defiant bark at a leopard-skin  rug, did he molest anything therein. In the house, too, he found a  genuine cave:--a wonderful place to lie and watch the world at large,  and to stay cool in and to pretend he was a wolf. The cave was the deep  space beneath the piano in the music room. It seemed to have a peculiar  charm to Lad. To the end of his days, by the way, this cave was his  chosen resting place. Nor, in his lifetime, did any other dog set foot  therein.    So much for \"all day and every day.\" But the nights were different.    Lad hated the nights. In the first place, everybody went to bed and  left him alone. In the second, his hard-hearted owners made him sleep  on a fluffy rug in a corner of the veranda instead of in his delectable  piano-cave. Moreover, there was no food at night. And there was nobody  to play with or to go for walks with or to listen to. There was nothing  but gloom and silence and dullness. When a puppy takes fifty cat-naps  in the course of the day, he cannot always be expected to sleep the  night through. It is too much to ask. And Lad's waking hours at night  were times of desolation and of utter boredom. True, he might have  consoled himself, as does many a lesser pup, with voicing his woes in a  series of melancholy howls. That, in time, would have drawn plenty of  human attention to the lonely youngster; even if the attention were not  wholly flattering.    But Lad did not belong to the howling type. When he was unhappy, he  waxed silent. And his sorrowful eyes took on a deeper woe. By the way,  if there is anything more sorrowful than the eyes of a collie pup that  has never known sorrow, I have yet to see it.    No, Lad could not howl. And he could not hunt for squirrels. For these  enemies of his were not content with the unsportsmanliness of climbing  out of his reach in the daytime, when he chased them; but they added to  their sins by joining the rest of the world,--except Lad,--in sleeping  all night. Even the lake that was so friendly by day was a chilly and  forbidding playfellow on the cool North Jersey nights.    There was nothing for a poor lonely pup to do but stretch out on his  rug and stare in unhappy silence up the driveway, in the impossible  hope that someone might happen along through the darkness to play with  him.    At such an hour and in such lonesomeness, Lad would gladly have tossed  aside all prejudices of caste,--and all his natural dislikes, and would  have frolicked in mad joy with the veriest stranger. Anything was  better than this drear solitude throughout the million hours before the  first of the maids should be stirring or the first of the farmhands  report for work. Yes, night was a disgusting time; and it had not one  single redeeming trait for the puppy.    Lad was not even consoled by the knowledge that he was guarding the  slumbrous house. He was not guarding it. He had not the very remotest  idea what it meant to be a watchdog. In all his five months he had  never learned that there is unfriendliness in the world; or that there  is anything to guard a house against.    True, it was instinctive with him to bark when People came down the  drive, or appeared at the gates without warning. But more than once the  Master had bidden him be silent when a rackety Puppy salvo of barking  had broken in on the arrival of some guest. And Lad was still in  perplexed doubt as to whether barking was something forbidden or merely  limited.    One night,--a solemn, black, breathless August night, when half-visible  heat lightning turned the murk of the western horizon to pulses of  dirty sulphur, Lad awoke from a fitful dream of chasing squirrels which  had never learned to climb.    He sat up on his rug, blinking around through the gloom in the half  hope that some of those non-climbing squirrels might still be in sight.  As they were not, he sighed unhappily and prepared to lay his classic  young head back again on the rug for another spell of night-shortening  sleep.    But, before his head could touch the rug, he reared it and half of his  small body from the floor and focused his nearsighted eyes on the  driveway. At the same time, his tail began to wag a thumping welcome.    Now, by day, a dog cannot see so far nor so clearly as can a human. But  by night,--for comparatively short distances,--he can see much better  than can his master. By day or by darkness, his keen hearing and keener  scent make up for all defects of eyesight.    And now three of Lad's senses told him he was no longer alone in his  tedious vigil. Down the drive, moving with amusing slowness and  silence, a man was coming. He was on foot. And he was fairly well  dressed. Dogs, the foremost snobs in creation,--are quick to note the  difference between a well-clad and a disreputable stranger.    Here unquestionably was a visitor:--some such man as so often came to  the Place and paid such flattering attention to the puppy. No longer  need Lad be bored by the solitude of this particular night. Someone was  coming towards the house;--and carrying a small bag under his arm.  Someone to make friends with. Lad was very happy.    Deep in his throat a welcoming bark was born. But he stilled it. Once,  when he had barked at the approach of a stranger, the stranger had gone  away. If this stranger were to go away, all the night's fun would go  with him. Also, no later than yesterday, the Master had scolded Lad for  barking at a man who had called. Wherefore the dog held his peace.    Getting to his feet and stretching himself, fore and aft, in true  collie fashion, the pup gamboled up the drive to meet the visitor.    The man was feeling his way through the pitch darkness, groping  cautiously; halting once or twice for a smolder of lightning to  silhouette the house he was nearing. In a wooded lane, a quarter mile  away, his lightless motor car waited.    Lad trotted up to him, the tiny white feet noiseless in the soft dust  of the drive. The man did not see him, but passed so close to the dog's  hospitably upthrust nose that he all but touched it.    Only slightly rebuffed at such chill lack of cordiality, Lad fell in  behind him, tail awag, and followed him to the porch. When the guest  should ring the bell, the Master or one of the maids would come to the  door. There would be lights and talk; and perhaps Laddie himself might  be allowed to slip in to his beloved cave.    But the man did not ring. He did not stop at the door at all. On tiptoe  he skirted the veranda to the old-fashioned bay windows at the south  side of the living room; windows with catches as old-fashioned and as  simple to open as themselves.    Lad padded along, a pace or so to the rear;--still hopeful of being  petted or perhaps even romped with. The man gave a faint but promising  sign of intent to romp, by swinging his small and very shiny brown bag  to and fro as he walked. Thus ever did the Master swing Lad's precious  canton flannel doll before throwing it for him to retrieve. Lad made a  tentative snap at the bag, his tail wagging harder than ever. But he  missed it. And, in another moment the man stopped swinging the bag and  tucked it under his arm again as he began to mumble with a bit of steel.    There was the very faintest of clicks. Then, noiselessly the window  slid upward. A second fumbling sent the wooden inside shutters ajar.  The man worked with no uncertainty. Ever since his visit to the Place,  a week earlier, behind the aegis of a big and bright and newly forged  telephone-inspector badge, he had carried in his trained memory the  location of windows and of obstructing furniture and of the primitive  small safe in the living room wall, with its pitifully pickable  lock;--the safe wherein the Place's few bits of valuable jewelry and  other compact treasures reposed at night.    Lad was tempted to follow the creeping body and the fascinatingly  swinging bag indoors. But his one effort to enter the house,--with  muddy paws,--by way of an open window, had been rebuked by the  Lawgivers. He had been led to understand that really well-bred little  dogs come in by way of the door; and then only on permission.    So he waited, doubtfully, at the veranda edge; in the hope that his new  friend might reappear or that the Master might perhaps want to show off  his pup to the caller, as so often the Master was wont to do.    Head cocked to one side, tulip ears alert, Laddie stood listening. To  the keenest human ears the thief's soft progress across the wide living"]]]
