Remember Tchaplitzky, who, thanks to  you, was able to pay his debts.\"    An expression of interior agitation passed over the face of the old  woman; then she relapsed into her former apathy.    \"Will you tell me the names of the magic cards, or not?\" asked Herman  after a pause.    There was no reply.    The young man then drew a pistol from his pocket, exclaiming: \"You old  witch, I'll force you to tell me!\"    At the sight of the weapon the Countess gave a second sign of life. She  threw back her head and put out her hands as if to protect herself; then  they dropped and she sat motionless.    Herman grasped her arm roughly, and was about to renew his threats, when  he saw that she was dead!    *****    Seated in her room, still in her ball-dress, Lisaveta gave herself up to  her reflections. She had expected to find the young officer there, but  she felt relieved to see that he was not.    Strangely enough, that very night at the ball, Tomsky had rallied her  about her preference for the young officer, assuring her that he knew  more than she supposed he did.    \"Of whom are you speaking?\" she had asked in alarm, fearing her  adventure had been discovered.    \"Of the remarkable man,\" was the reply. \"His name is Herman.\"    Lisa made no reply.    \"This Herman,\" continued Tomsky, \"is a romantic character; he has the  profile of a Napoleon and the heart of a Mephistopheles. It is said he  has at least three crimes on his conscience. But how pale you are.\"    \"It is only a slight headache. But why do you talk to me of this  Herman?\"    \"Because I believe he has serious intentions concerning you.\"    \"Where has he seen me?\"    \"At church, perhaps, or on the street.\"    The conversation was interrupted at this point, to the great regret of  the young girl. The words of Tomsky made a deep impression upon her, and  she realized how imprudently she had acted. She was thinking of all this  and a great deal more when the door of her apartment suddenly opened,  and Herman stood before her. She drew back at sight of him, trembling  violently.    \"Where have you been?\" she asked in a frightened whisper.    \"In the bedchamber of the Countess. She is dead,\" was the calm reply.    \"My God! What are you saying?\" cried the girl.    \"Furthermore, I believe that I was the cause of her death.\"    The words of Tomsky flashed through Lisa's mind.    Herman sat down and told her all. She listened with a feeling of terror  and disgust. So those passionate letters, that audacious pursuit were  not the result of tenderness and love. It was money that he desired. The  poor girl felt that she had in a sense been an accomplice in the death  of her benefactress. She began to weep bitterly. Herman regarded her in  silence.    \"You are a monster!\" exclaimed Lisa, drying her eyes.    \"I didn't intend to kill her; the pistol was not even loaded.    \"How are you going to get out of the house?\" inquired Lisa. \"It is  nearly daylight. I intended to show you the way to a secret staircase,  while the Countess was asleep, as we would have to cross her chamber.  Now I am afraid to do so.\"    \"Direct me, and I will find the way alone,\" replied Herman.    She gave him minute instructions and a key with which to open the street  door. The young man pressed the cold, inert hand, then went out.    The death of the Countess had surprised no one, as it had long been  expected. Her funeral was attended by every one of note in the  vicinity. Herman mingled with the throng without attracting any especial  attention. After all the friends had taken their last look at the dead  face, the young man approached the bier. He prostrated himself on the  cold floor, and remained motionless for a long time. He rose at last  with a face almost as pale as that of the corpse itself, and went up the  steps to look into the casket. As he looked down it seemed to him that  the rigid face returned his glance mockingly, closing one eye. He turned  abruptly away, made a false step, and fell to the floor. He was picked  up, and, at the same moment, Lisaveta was carried out in a faint.    Herman did not recover his usual composure during the entire day. He  dined alone at an out-of-the-way restaurant, and drank a great deal, in  the hope of stifling his emotion. The wine only served to stimulate his  imagination. He returned home and threw himself down on his bed without  undressing.    During the night he awoke with a start; the moon shone into his chamber,  making everything plainly visible. Some one looked in at the window,  then quickly disappeared. He paid no attention to this, but soon he  heard the vestibule door open. He thought it was his orderly, returning  late, drunk as usual. The step was an unfamiliar one, and he heard the  shuffling sound of loose slippers.    The door of his room opened, and a woman in white entered. She came  close to the bed, and the terrified man recognized the Countess.    \"I have come to you against my will,\" she said abruptly; \"but I was  commanded to grant your request. The tray, seven, and ace in succession  are the magic cards. Twenty-four hours must elapse between the use  of each card, and after the three have been used you must never play  again.\"    The fantom then turned and walked away. Herman heard the outside door  close, and again saw the form pass the window.    He rose and went out into the hall, where his orderly lay asleep on the  floor. The door was closed. Finding no trace of a visitor, he returned  to his room, lit his candle, and wrote down what he had just heard.    Two fixed ideas cannot exist in the brain at the same time any more than  two bodies can occupy the same point in space. The tray, seven, and ace  soon chased away the thoughts of the dead woman, and all other thoughts  from the brain of the young officer. All his ideas merged into a single  one: how to turn to advantage the secret paid for so dearly. He even  thought of resigning his commission and going to Paris to force a  fortune from conquered fate. Chance rescued him from his embarrassment.    *****    Tchekalinsky, a man who had passed his whole life at cards, opened  a club at St. Petersburg. His long experience secured for him the  confidence of his companions, and his hospitality and genial humor  conciliated society.    The gilded youth flocked around him, neglecting society, preferring the  charms of faro to those of their sweethearts. Naroumov invited Herman  to accompany him to the club, and the young man accepted the invitation  only too willingly.    The two officers found the apartments full. Generals and statesmen  played whist; young men lounged on sofas, eating ices or smoking. In  the principal salon stood a long table, at which about twenty men sat  playing faro, the host of the establishment being the banker.    He was a man of about sixty, gray-haired and respectable. His ruddy face  shone with genial humor; his eyes sparkled and a constant smile hovered  around his lips.    Naroumov presented Herman. The host gave him a cordial handshake, begged  him not to stand upon ceremony, and returned, to his dealing. More than  thirty cards were already on the table. Tchekalinsky paused after each  coup, to allow the punters time to recognize their gains or losses,  politely answering all questions and constantly smiling.    After the deal was over, the cards were shuffled and the game began  again.    \"Permit me to choose a card,\" said Herman, stretching out his hand over  the head of a portly gentleman, to reach a livret. The banker bowed  without replying.    Herman chose a card, and wrote the amount of his stake upon it with a  piece of chalk.    \"How much is that?\" asked the banker; \"excuse me, sir, but I do not see  well.\"    \"Forty thousand rubles,\" said Herman coolly.    All eyes were instantly turned upon the speaker.    \"He has lost his wits,\" thought Naroumov.    \"Allow me to observe,\" said Tchekalinsky, with his eternal smile, \"that  your stake is excessive.\"    \"What of it?\" replied Herman, nettled. \"Do you accept it or not?\"    The banker nodded in assent. \"I have only to remind you that the cash  will be necessary; of course your word is good, but in order to keep the  confidence of my patrons, I prefer the ready money.\"    Herman took a bank-check from his pocket and handed it to his host. The  latter examined it attentively, then laid it on the card chosen.    He began dealing: to the right, a nine; to the left, a tray.    \"The tray wins,\" said Herman, showing the card he held--a tray.    A murmur ran through the crowd. Tchekalinsky frowned for a second only,  then his smile returned. He took a roll of bank-bills from his pocket  and counted out the required sum. Herman received it and at once left  the table.    The next evening saw him at the place again. Every one eyed him  curiously, and Tchekalinsky greeted him cordially.    He selected his card and placed upon it his fresh stake. The banker  began dealing: to the right, a nine; to the left, a seven.    Herman then showed his card--a seven spot. The onlookers exclaimed,  and the host was visibly disturbed. He counted out ninety-four-thousand  rubles and passed them to Herman, who accepted them without showing the  least surprise, and at once withdrew.    The following evening he went again. His appearance was the signal for  the cessation of all occupation, every one being eager to watch the  developments of events. He selected his card--an ace.    The dealing began: to the right, a queen; to the left, an ace.    \"The ace wins,\" remarked Herman, turning up his card without glancing at  it.    \"Your queen is killed,\" remarked Tchekalinsky quietly.    Herman trembled; looking down, he saw, not the ace he had selected,  but the queen of spades. He could scarcely believe his eyes. It seemed  impossible that he could have made such a mistake. As he stared at the  card it seemed to him that the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2306"],[0,"Uncle Remus, His Songs and His Sayings (#2)"],[1,"America by the negro slaves. They are certainly found among  the Red Negroes; but, unfortunately for the African theory, it is  equally certain that they are told by savage Indians of the  Amazons Valley, away up on the Tapajos, Red Negro, and Tapura.  These Indians hardly ever see a negro, and their languages are  very distinct from the broken Portuguese spoken by the slaves.  The form of the stories, as recounted in the Tupi and Mundurucu'  languages, seems to show that they were originally formed in  those languages or have long been adopted in them.    \"It is interesting to find a story from Upper Egypt (that of the  fox who pretended to be dead) identical with an Amazonian story,  and strongly resembling one found by you among the negroes.  Vambagen, the Brazilian historian (now Visconde de Rio Branco),  tried to prove a relationship between the ancient Egyptians, or  other Turanian stock, and the Tupi Indians. His theory rested on  rather a slender basis, yet it must be confessed that he had one  or two strong points. Do the resemblances between old and New  World stories point to a similar conclusion? It would be hard to  say with the material that we now have.    \"One thing is certain. The animal stories told by the negroes in  our Southern States and in Brazil were brought by them from  Africa. Whether they originated there, or with the Arabs, or  Egyptians, or with yet more ancient nations, must still be an  open question. Whether the Indians got them from the negroes or  from some earlier source is equally uncertain. We have seen  enough to know that a very interesting line of investigation has  been opened.\"    Professor Hartt, in his Amazonian Tortoise Myths, quotes a story  from the Riverside Magazine of November, 1868, which will be  recognized as a variant of one given by Uncle Remus. I venture to  append it here, with some necessary verbal and phonetic  alterations, in order to give the reader an idea of the  difference between the dialect of the cotton plantations, as used  by Uncle Remus, and the lingo in vogue on the rice plantations  and Sea Islands of the South Atlantic States:    \"One time B'er Deer an' B'er Cooter (Terrapin) was courtin', and  de lady did bin lub B'er Deer mo' so dan B'er Cooter. She did bin  lub B'er Cooter, but she lub B'er Deer de morest. So de young  lady say to B'er Deer and B'er Cooter bofe dat dey mus' hab a  ten-mile race, an de one dat beats, she will go marry him.    \"So B'er Cooter say to B'er Deer: 'You has got mo longer legs dan  I has, but I will run you. You run ten mile on land, and I will  run ten mile on de water!'    \"So B'er Cooter went an' git nine er his fam'ly, an' put one at  ebery mile-pos', and he hisse'f, what was to run wid B'er Deer,  he was right in front of de young lady's do', in de broom-grass.    \"Dat mornin' at nine o'clock, B'er Deer he did met B'er Cooter at  de fus mile-pos', wey dey was to start fum. So he call: 'Well,  B'er Cooter, is you ready? Co long!' As he git on to de nex'  mile-pos', he say: 'B'er Cooter!' B'er Cooter say: 'Hullo!' B'er  Deer say: 'You dere?' B'er Cooter say: 'Yes, B'er Deer, I dere  too.'    \"Nex' mile-pos' he jump, B'er Deer say: 'Hullo, B'er Cooter!'  B'er Cooter say: 'Hullo, B'er Deer! you dere too?' B'er Deer say:  'Ki! it look like you gwine fer tie me; it look like we gwine fer  de gal tie!'    \"W'en he git to de nine-mile pos' he tought he git dere fus,  'cause he mek two jump; so he holler: 'B'er Cooter!' B'er Cooter  answer: 'You dere too?' B'er Deer say: 'It look like you gwine  tie me.' B'er Cooter say: 'Go long, B'er Deer. I git dere in due  season time,' which he does, and wins de race.\"    The story of the Rabbit and the Fox, as told by the Southern  negroes, is artistically dramatic in this: it progresses in an  orderly way from a beginning to a well-defined conclusion, and is  full of striking episodes that suggest the culmination. It seems  to me to be to a certain extent allegorical, albeit such an  interpretation may be unreasonable. At least it is a fable  thoroughly characteristic of the negro; and it needs no  scientific investigation to show why he selects as his hero the  weakest and most harmless of all animals, and brings him out  victorious in contests with the bear, the wolf, and the fox. It  is not virtue that triumphs, but helplessness; it is not malice,  but mischievousness. It would be presumptuous in me to offer an  opinion as to the origin of these curious myth-stories; but, if  ethnologists should discover that they did not originate with the  African, the proof to that effect should be accompanied with a  good deal of persuasive eloquence.    Curiously enough, I have found few negroes who will acknowledge  to a stranger that they know anything of these legends; and yet  to relate one of the stories is the surest road to their  confidence and esteem. In this way, and in this way only, I have  been enabled to collect and verify the folklore included in this  volume. There is an anecdote about the Irishman and the rabbit  which a number of negroes have told to me with great unction, and  which is both funny and characteristic, though I will not  undertake to say that it has its origin with the blacks. One  day an Irishman who had heard people talking about \"mares' nests\"  was going along the big road--it is always the big road in  contradistinction to neighborhood paths and by-paths, called in  the vernacular \"nigh-cuts\"--when he came to a pumpkin--patch. The  Irishman had never seen any of this fruit before, and he at once  concluded that he had discovered a veritable mare's nest. Making  the most of his opportunity, he gathered one of the pumpkins in  his arms and went on his way. A pumpkin is an exceedingly awkward  thing to carry, and the Irishman had not gone far before he made  a misstep, and stumbled. The pumpkin fell to the ground, rolled  down the hill into a \"brush--heap,\" and, striking against a  stump, was broken. The story continues in the dialect: \"W'en de  punkin roll in de bresh--heap, out jump a rabbit; en soon's de  I'shmuns see dat, he take atter de rabbit en holler: 'Kworp,  colty! kworp, colty!' but de rabbit, he des flew.\" The point of  this is obvious.    As to the songs, the reader is warned that it will be found  difficult to make them conform to the ordinary rules of  versification, nor is it intended that they should so conform.  They are written, and are intended to be read, solely with  reference to the regular and invariable recurrence of the  caesura, as, for instance, the first stanza of the Revival Hymn:    \"Oh, whar / shill we go / w'en de great / day comes   Wid de blow / in' er de trumpits / en de bang / in' er de          drums /   How man / y po' sin / ners'll be kotch'd / out late   En fine / no latch ter de gold  / en gate /\"    In other words, the songs depend for their melody and rhythm  upon the musical quality of time, and not upon long or short,  accented or unaccented syllables. I am persuaded that this fact  led Mr. Sidney Lanier, who is thoroughly familiar with the  metrical peculiarities of negro songs, into the exhaustive  investigation which has resulted in the publication of his  scholarly treatise on The Science of English Verse.    The difference between the dialect of the legends and that of the  character--sketches, slight as it is, marks the modifications  which the speech of the negro has undergone even where education  has played in deed, save in the no part reforming it.  Indeed,  save in the remote country districts, the dialect of the legends  has nearly disappeared.  I am perfectly well aware that the  character sketches are without permanent interest, but they are  embodied here for the purpose of presenting a phase of negro  character wholly distinct from that which I have endeavored to  preserve in the legends. Only in this shape, and with all the  local allusions, would it be possible to adequately represent the  shrewd observations, the curious retorts, the homely thrusts, the  quaint comments, and the humorous philosophy of the race of which  Uncle Remus is the type.    If the reader not familiar with plantation life will imagine that  the myth--stories of Uncle Remus are told night after night to a  little boy by an old negro who appears to be venerable enough to  have lived during the period which he describes--who has nothing  but pleasant memories of the discipline of slavery--and who has  all the prejudices of caste and pride of family that were the  natural results of the system; if the reader can imagine all  this, he will find little difficulty in appreciating and  sympathizing with the air of affectionate superiority which Uncle  Remus assumes as he proceeds to unfold the mysteries of  plantation lore to a little child who is the product of that  practical reconstruction which has been going on to some extent  since the war in spite of the politicians. Uncle Remus describes  that reconstruction in his Story of the War, and I may as well  add here for the benefit of the curious that that story is almost  literally true.    J. C. H.
