There are also numerous hospitals and schools. Breslau is  exceedingly rich in fine monuments; the most noteworthy being the  equestrian statues of Frederick the Great and Frederick William III., both  by Kiss; the statue of Bluecher by Rauch; a marble statue of General  Tauentzien by Langhans and Schadow; a bronze statue of Karl Gottlieb Svarez  (1746-1798), the Prussian jurist, a monument to Schleiermacher, born here  in 1768, and statues of the emperor William I., Bismarck and Moltke. There  are also several handsome fountains. Foremost among the educational  establishments stands the university, founded in 1702 by the emperor  Leopold I. as a Jesuit college, and greatly extended by the incorporation  of the university of Frankfort-on-Oder in 1811. Its library contains  306,000 volumes and 4000 MSS., and has in the so-called _Bibliotheca  Habichtiana_ a valuable collection of oriental literature. Among its  auxiliary establishments are botanical gardens, an observatory, and  anatomical, physiological and kindred institutions. There are eight  classical and four modern schools, two higher girls' schools, a Roman  Catholic normal school, a Jewish theological seminary, a school of arts and  crafts, and numerous literary and charitable foundations. It is, however,  as a commercial and industrial city that Breslau is most widely known. Its  situation, close to the extensive coal and iron fields of Upper Silesia, in  proximity to the Austrian and Russian frontiers, at the centre of a network  of railways directly communicating both with these countries and with the  chief towns of northern and central Germany, and on a deep waterway  connecting with the Elbe and the Vistula, facilitates its very considerable  transit and export trade in the products of the province and of the  neighbouring countries. These embrace coal, sugar, cereals, spirits,  petroleum and timber. The local industries comprise machinery and tools,  railway and tramway carriages, furniture, cast-iron goods, gold and silver  work, carpets, furs, cloth and cottons, paper, musical instruments, glass  and china. Breslau is the headquarters of the VI. German army corps and  contains a large garrison of troops of all arms.    _History._--Breslau (Lat. _Vratislavia_) is first mentioned by the  chronicler Thietmar, bishop of Merseburg, in A.D. 1000, and was probably  founded some years before this date. Early in the 11th century it was made  the seat of a bishop, and after having formed part of Poland, became the  capital of an independent duchy in 1163. Destroyed by the Mongols in 1241,  it soon recovered its former prosperity and received a large influx of  German colonists. The bishop obtained the title of a prince of the Empire  in 1290.[1] When Henry VI., the last duke of Breslau, died in 1335, the  city came by purchase to John, king of Bohemia, whose successors retained  it until about 1460. The Bohemian kings bestowed various privileges on  Breslau, which soon began to extend its commerce in all directions, while  owing to increasing wealth the citizens took up a more independent  attitude. Disliking the Hussites, Breslau placed itself under the  protection of Pope Pius II. in 1463, and a few years afterwards came under  the rule of the Hungarian king, Matthias Corvinus. After his death in 1490  it again became subject to Bohemia, passing with the rest of Silesia to the  Habsburgs when in 1526 Ferdinand, afterwards emperor, was chosen king of  Bohemia. Having passed almost undisturbed through the periods of the  Reformation and the Thirty Years' War, Breslau was compelled to own the  authority of Frederick the Great in 1741. It was, however, recovered by the  Austrians in 1757, but was regained by Frederick after his victory at  Leuthen in the same year, and has since belonged to Prussia, although it  was held for a few days by the French in 1807 after the battle of Jena, and  again in 1813 after the battle of Bautzen. The sites of the fortifications,  dismantled by the French in 1807, were given to the civic authorities by  King Frederick William III., and converted into promenades. In March 1813  this monarch issued from Breslau his stirring appeals to the Prussians, _An  mein Volk_ and _An mein Kriegesheer_, and the city was the centre of the  Prussian preparations for the campaign which ended at Leipzig. After the  Prussian victory at Sadowa in 1866, William I. made a triumphant and  complimentary entry into the city, which since the days of Frederick the  Great has been only less loyal to the royal house than Berlin itself.

Silisiae,\" vol. ii. 1882);  Luchs, _Breslau, ein Fuehrer durch die Stadt_ (12th ed., Bresl. 1904).    [1] In 1195 Jaroslaw, son of Boleslaus I. of Lower Silesia, who became  bishop of Breslau in 1198, inherited the duchy of Neisse, which at his  death (1201) he bequeathed to his successors in the see. The Austrian part  of Neisse still belongs to the bishop of Breslau, who also still bears the  title of prince bishop.    BRESSANT, JEAN BAPTISTE PROSPER (1815-1886), French actor, was born at  Chalon-sur-Saone on the 23rd of October 1815, and began his stage career at  the Varietes in Paris in 1833. In 1838 he went to the French theatre at St  Petersburg, where for eight years he played important parts with  ever-increasing reputation. His success was confirmed at the Gymnase when  he returned to Paris in 1846, and he made his _debut_ at the Comedie  Francaise as a full-fledged _societaire_ in 1854. From playing the ardent  young lover, he turned to leading roles both in modern plays and in the  classical repertoire. His Richelieu in _Mlle de Belle-Isle_, his Octave in  Alfred de Musset's _Les Caprices de Marianne_, and his appearance in de  Musset's _Il faut qu'une porte soit ouverte ou fermee_ and _Un caprice_  were followed by _Tartuffe_, _Le Misanthrope_ and _Don Juan_. Bressant  retired in 1875, and died on the 23rd of January 1886. During his  professorship at the Conservatoire, Mounet-Sully was one of his pupils.    BRESSE, a district of eastern France embracing portions of the departments  of Ain, Saone-et-Loire and Jura. The Bresse extends from the Dombes on the  south to the river Doubs on the north, and from the Saone eastwards to the  Jura, measuring some 60 m. in the former, and 20 m. in the latter  direction. It is a plain varying from 600 to 800 ft. above the sea, with  few eminences and a slight inclination westwards. Heaths and coppice  alternate with pastures and arable land; pools and marshes are numerous,  especially in the north. Its chief rivers are the Veyle, the Reyssouze and  the Seille, all tributaries of the Saone. The soil is a gravelly clay but  moderately fertile, and cattle-raising is largely carried on. The region  is, however, more especially celebrated for its table poultry. The  inhabitants preserve a distinctive but almost obsolete costume, with a  curious head-dress. The Bresse proper, called the _Bresse Bressane_,  comprises the northern portion of the department of Ain. The greater part  of the district belonged in the middle ages to the lords of Bage, from whom  it passed in 1272 to the house of Savoy. It was not till the first half of  the 15th century that the province, with Bourg as its capital, was founded  as such. In 1601 it was ceded to France by the treaty of Lyons, after which  it formed (together with the province of Bugey) first a separate government  and afterwards part of the government of Burgundy.    BRESSUIRE, a town of western France, capital of an arrondissement in the  department of Deux-Sevres, 48 m. N. of Niort by rail. Pop. (1906) 4561. The  town is situated on an eminence overlooking the Dolo, a tributary of the  Argenton. It is the centre of a cattle-rearing and agricultural region, and  has important markets; the manufacture of wooden type and woollen goods is  carried on. Bressuire has two buildings of interest: the church of  Notre-Dame, which, dating chiefly from the 12th and 15th centuries, has an  imposing tower of the Renaissance period; and the castle, built by the  lords of [v.04 p.0500] Beaumont, vassals of the viscount of Thouars. The  latter is now in ruins, and a portion of the site is occupied by a modern  chateau, but an inner and outer line of fortifications are still to be  seen. The whole forms the finest assemblage of feudal ruins in Poitou.  Bressuire is the seat of a sub-prefect and has a tribunal of first  instance. Among the disasters suffered at various times by the town, its  capture from the English and subsequent pillage by French troops under du  Guesclin in 1370 is the most memorable.    BREST, a fortified seaport of western France, capital of an arrondissement  in the department of Finistere, 155 m. W.N.W. of Rennes by rail. Population  (1906) town, 71,163; commune, 85,294. It is situated to the north of a  magnificent landlocked bay, and occupies the slopes of two hills divided by  the river Penfeld,--the part of the town on the left bank being regarded as  Brest proper, while the part on the right is known as Recouvrance. There  are also extensive suburbs to the east of the town. The hill-sides are in  some places so steep that the ascent from the lower to the upper town has  to be effected by flights of steps and the second or third storey of one  house is often on a level with the ground storey of the next.

I started horribly. It  was a girl, quite a pretty girl, too, but very pale, and with  over-bright eyes. She gave one quick glance up into my face, muttered  something, an apology, I think, and drew back again into her  hiding-place.\"    \"He's been warned,\" growled Sime. \"It will be notice to quit next  time.\"    \"I ran upstairs and banged on Ferrara's door. He didn't open at first,  but shouted out to know who was knocking. When I told him, he let me  in, and closed the door very quickly. As I went in, a pungent cloud  met me--incense.\"    \"Incense?\"    \"His rooms smelt like a joss-house; I told him so. He said he was  experimenting with _Kyphi_--the ancient Egyptian stuff used in the  temples. It was all dark and hot; phew! like a furnace. Ferrara's  rooms always were odd, but since the long vacation I hadn't been in.  Good lord, they're disgusting!\"    \"How? Ferrara spent vacation in Egypt; I suppose he's brought things  back?\"    \"Things--yes! Unholy things! But that brings me to something too. I  ought to know more about the chap than anybody; Sir Michael Ferrara  and the governor have been friends for thirty years; but my father is  oddly reticent--quite singularly reticent--regarding Antony. Anyway,  have you heard about him, in Egypt?\"    \"I've heard he got into trouble. For his age, he has a devil of a  queer reputation; there's no disguising it.\"    \"What sort of trouble?\"    \"I've no idea. Nobody seems to know. But I heard from young Ashby that  Ferrara was asked to leave.\"    \"There's some tale about Kitchener--\"    \"_By_ Kitchener, Ashby says; but I don't believe it.\"    \"Well--Ferrara lighted a lamp, an elaborate silver thing, and I found  myself in a kind of nightmare museum. There was an unwrapped mummy  there, the mummy of a woman--I can't possibly describe it. He had  pictures, too--photographs. I shan't try to tell you what they  represented. I'm not thin-skinned; but there are some subjects that no  man anxious to avoid Bedlam would willingly investigate. On the table  by the lamp stood a number of objects such as I had never seen in my  life before, evidently of great age. He swept them into a cupboard  before I had time to look long. Then he went off to get a bath towel,  slippers, and so forth. As he passed the fire he threw something in. A  hissing tongue of flame leapt up--and died down again.\"    \"What did he throw in?\"    \"I am not absolutely certain; so I won't say what I _think_ it was,  at the moment. Then he began to help me shed my saturated flannels,  and he set a kettle on the fire, and so forth. You know the personal  charm of the man? But there was an unpleasant sense of something--what  shall I say?--sinister. Ferrara's ivory face was more pale than usual,  and he conveyed the idea that he was chewed up--exhausted. Beads of  perspiration were on his forehead.\"    \"Heat of his rooms?\"    \"No,\" said Cairn shortly. \"It wasn't that. I had a rub down and  borrowed some slacks. Ferrara brewed grog and pretended to make me  welcome. Now I come to something which I can't forget; it may be a  mere coincidence, but--. He has a number of photographs in his rooms,  good ones, which he has taken himself. I'm not speaking now of the  monstrosities, the outrages; I mean views, and girls--particularly  girls. Well, standing on a queer little easel right under the lamp was  a fine picture of Apollo, the swan, lord of the backwater.\"    Sime stared dully through the smoke haze.    \"It gave me a sort of shock,\" continued Cairn. \"It made me think,  harder than ever, of the thing he had thrown in the fire. Then, in his  photographic zenana, was a picture of a girl whom I am almost sure was  the one I had met at the bottom of the stair. Another was of Myra  Duquesne.\"    \"His cousin?\"    \"Yes. I felt like tearing it from the wall. In fact, the moment I saw  it, I stood up to go. I wanted to run to my rooms and strip the man's  clothes off my back! It was a struggle to be civil any longer. Sime,  if you had seen that swan die--\"    Sime walked over to the window.    \"I have a glimmering of your monstrous suspicions,\" he said slowly.  \"The last man to be kicked out of an English varsity for this sort of  thing, so far as I know, was Dr. Dee of St. John's, Cambridge, and  that's going back to the sixteenth century.\"    \"I know; it's utterly preposterous, of course. But I had to confide in  somebody. I'll shift off now, Sime.\"    Sime nodded, staring from the open window. As Cairn was about to close  the outer door:    \"Cairn,\" cried Sime, \"since you are now a man of letters and leisure,  you might drop in and borrow Wilson's brains for me.\"    \"All right,\" shouted Cairn.    Down in the quadrangle he stood for a moment, reflecting; then, acting  upon a sudden resolution, he strode over towards the gate and ascended  Ferrara's stair.    For some time he knocked at the door in vain, but he persisted in his  clamouring, arousing the ancient echoes. Finally, the door was opened.    Antony Ferrara faced him. He wore a silver-grey dressing gown, trimmed  with white swansdown, above which his ivory throat rose statuesque.  The almond-shaped eyes, black as night, gleamed strangely beneath the  low, smooth brow. The lank black hair appeared lustreless by  comparison. His lips were very red. In his whole appearance there was  something repellently effeminate.    \"Can I come in?\" demanded Cairn abruptly.    \"Is it--something important?\" Ferrara's voice was husky but not  unmusical.    \"Why, are you busy?\"    \"Well--er--\" Ferrara smiled oddly.    \"Oh, a visitor?\" snapped Cairn.    \"Not at all.\"    \"Accounts for your delay in opening,\" said Cairn, and turned on his  heel. \"Mistook me for the proctor, in person, I suppose. Good-night.\"    Ferrara made no reply. But, although he never once glanced back, Cairn  knew that Ferrara, leaning over the rail, above, was looking after  him; it was as though elemental heat were beating down upon his head.          CHAPTER II    THE PHANTOM HANDS      A week later Robert Cairn quitted Oxford to take up the newspaper  appointment offered to him in London. It may have been due to some  mysterious design of a hidden providence that Sime 'phoned him early  in the week about an unusual case in one of the hospitals.    \"Walton is junior house-surgeon there,\" he said, \"and he can arrange  for you to see the case. She (the patient) undoubtedly died from some  rare nervous affection. I have a theory,\" etc.; the conversation  became technical.    Cairn went to the hospital, and by courtesy of Walton, whom he had  known at Oxford, was permitted to view the body.    \"The symptoms which Sime has got to hear about,\" explained the  surgeon, raising the sheet from the dead woman's face, \"are--\"    He broke off. Cairn had suddenly exhibited a ghastly pallor; he  clutched at Walton for support.    \"My God!\"    Cairn, still holding on to the other, stooped over the discoloured  face. It had been a pretty face when warm life had tinted its curves;  now it was congested--awful; two heavy discolorations showed, one on  either side of the region of the larynx.    \"What on earth is wrong with you?\" demanded Walton.    \"I thought,\" gasped Cairn, \"for a moment, that I knew--\"    \"Really! I wish you did! We can't find out anything about her. Have a  good look.\"    \"No,\" said Cairn, mastering himself with an effort--\"a chance  resemblance, that's all.\" He wiped the beads of perspiration from his  forehead.    \"You look jolly shaky,\" commented Walton. \"Is she like someone you  know very well?\"    \"No, not at all, now that I come to consider the features; but it was  a shock at first. What on earth caused death?\"    \"Asphyxia,\" answered Walton shortly. \"Can't you see?\"    \"Someone strangled her, and she was brought here too late?\"    \"Not at all, my dear chap; nobody strangled her. She was brought here  in a critical state four or five days ago by one of the slum priests  who keep us so busy. We diagnosed it as exhaustion from lack of  food--with other complications. But the case was doing quite well up  to last night; she was recovering strength. Then, at about one  o'clock, she sprang up in bed, and fell back choking. By the time the  nurse got to her it was all over.\"    \"But the marks on her throat?\"    Walton shrugged his shoulders.    \"There they are! Our men are keenly interested. It's absolutely  unique. Young Shaw, who has a mania for the nervous system, sent a  long account up to Sime, who suffers from a similar form of  aberration.\"    \"Yes; Sime 'phoned me.\"    \"It's nothing to do with nerves,\" said Walton contemptuously. \"Don't  ask me to explain it, but it's certainly no nerve case.\"    \"One of the other patients--\"    \"My dear chap, the other patients were all fast asleep! The nurse was  at her table in the corner, and in full view of the bed the whole  time. I tell you no one touched her!\"    \"How long elapsed before the nurse got to her?\"    \"Possibly half a minute. But there is no means of learning when the  paroxysm commenced. The leaping up in bed probably marked the end and  not the beginning of the attack.\"    Cairn experienced a longing for the fresh air; it was as though some  evil cloud hovered around and about the poor unknown. Strange ideas,  horrible ideas, conjectures based upon imaginings all but insane,  flooded his mind darkly.    Leaving the hospital, which harboured a grim secret, he stood at the  gate for a moment, undecided what to do. His father, Dr. Cairn, was  out of London, or he would certainly have sought him in this hour of  sore perplexity.    \"What in Heaven's name is behind it all!\" he asked himself.    For he knew beyond doubt that the girl who lay in the hospital was the  same that he had seen one night at Oxford, was the girl whose  photograph he had found in Antony Ferrara's rooms!    He formed a sudden resolution. A taxi-cab was passing at that moment,  and he hailed it, giving Sir Michael "]]]
