In the  study and practice of taxidermy for several years I have failed to find  any work written primarily for these every day nature lovers, though  they probably handle a greater number of interesting specimens of animal  life than all other classes of people.    In view of this fact the following directions and suggestions for  preserving various animal forms as objects of use and ornament have been  prepared. As a treatise for the scientist or museum preparator it is not  intended, there are many books on the art expressly for them, but we  hope it may fill a place of its own, acting as a not too dry and  technical introduction to the art preservative for those who find life  all too short for the many things which are to be done.    Thoroughness, patience, and some love for nature, are qualities highly  desirable in this art. Work prepared by one possessing these qualities  need not be ashamed and practice will bring skill and perfection of  technic.    As a handicraft in which the workman has not been displaced or made  secondary by a machine taxidermy is noticeable also, and for many  reasons is worthy of its corner in the home work-shop.    In this work also the ladies can take a very effective hand, and numbers  have done so; for there is no doubt that a woman's taste and lightness  of touch enables her in some branches of taxidermy to far exceed the  average man. Especially in the manipulation of frail skins and delicate  feathers, in bird taxidermy, is this so.    I have endeavored to give preference to short cuts and time-saving  methods where possible in the following matter, and especially hints on  saving interesting and valuable specimens temporarily until sufficient  leisure is had to do justice to their further preservation. In this  connection I have given prominence to the liquid preservative for entire  specimens and the methods for preserving skins of birds and animals in a  damp and relaxed state ready for mounting at the operator's pleasure.    I would urge the beginner especially, to mount all his specimens as far  as possible. Dry scientific skins have their value, perhaps, to the  museum or closet naturalist whose chief delight is in multiplying  species, but a well mounted skin is a pleasure to all who may see it.  Making it a rule to utilize thus all specimens which come to hand would  also deter much thoughtless killing in the ranks of the country's  already depleted wild life.    Make this a rule and you will avoid friction and show yourself truly a  conservationist with the best. In a number of states there are legal  restrictions in the way of a license tax imposed on the professional  taxidermist. Detailed information of these are found in Game, Fur and  Fish Laws of the various states and Canadian provinces. Fur and game  animals and birds killed legally during open season may be preserved by  the taker for private possession without hindrance anywhere, I think.  More explicit details may be had on application to your state fish and  game commissioner or warden.    [Signature: Albert B. Farnham.]          Home Taxidermy for Pleasure and Profit    CHAPTER I.    HISTORY.      It is very evident that this art--Taxidermy, preservation or care of  skins--had its origin far back before the dawn of written history. There  existed then as now the desire to preserve the trophy of the hunter's  prowess and skill and the unusual in natural objects.    As far back as five centuries B. C. in the record of the African  explorations of Hanno the Carthaginian, an account is given of the  discovery of what was evidently the gorilla and the subsequent  preservation of their skins, which were, on the return of the voyagers,  hung in the temple of Astarte, where they remained until the taking of  Carthage in the year 146 B. C.    This, of course, was not the art as we know it now, but shows the  beginnings of what might be called the museum idea. The art of embalming  as practiced by the ancient Egyptians was, however, effective, not for  the purpose of having the specimens look natural, or for exhibition, but  to satisfy the superstition of the times, and though a preservative art,  hardly to be classed with taxidermy.    In the tombs of that period are found besides the mummies of human  beings, countless others of dogs, cats, monkeys, birds, sheep and oxen.  There have been a number of efforts made to substitute some form of  embalming for present day taxidermy but without much success, for though  the body of the specimen may be preserved from decay without removing it  from the skin, the subsequent shrinkage and distortion spoil any effect  which may have been achieved.    [Illustration: AN EARLY DAY SPECIMEN.]    The first attempt at stuffing and mounting birds was said to have been  made in Amsterdam in the beginning of the 16th century. The oldest  museum specimen in existence, as far as I know, is a rhinoceros in the  Royal Museum of Vertebrates in Florence, Italy, said to have been  originally mounted in the 16th century.    Probably on account of the necessary knowledge of preservative  chemicals, the art seems to have been in the hands of chemists and  astrologers, chiefly, during the middle ages, and stuffed animals such  as bats, crocodiles, frogs, snakes, lizards, owls, etc., figure in  literary descriptions of their abodes. Then as now also, the dining  halls of the nobles and wealthy were decorated with heads and horns  procured in the hunt.    The first publications on the art seem to have been made in France, in  which country and Germany, many still used methods and formulas  originated. Though the first volume of instruction in taxidermy was  published in the United States as late as 1865, it has been left for the  study and ingenuity of American taxidermists to accomplish what is  probably work of as high a standard as any in the world.    The Ward establishment at Rochester has turned out many well trained  taxidermists, the large museums of the United States are filled with  some of the best work of the kind in existence, besides many persons who  have engaged in it for commercial purposes or to gratify private tastes.  Many of these have made public their methods and modes in various  publications. Among these are the works of Batty, Hornaday, Shofeldt,  Davie, Rowley, Maynard, Reed and others, all of which are invaluable  books of reference for the home taxidermist.    It is to be regretted that the once flourishing Society of American  Taxidermists has not been perpetuated, numbering, as it did, among its  membership the best artists in their line in this country.    There is no royal road to success in this, more than any other of the  arts and sciences, though I believe the ambitious beginner will find the  way smoother; better materials are to be had, more helpful publications  to be consulted and the lessening supply of wild life tends to make a  more appreciative public than ever before.          CHAPTER II.    OUTFIT--TOOLS AND MATERIALS.      The extent and variety of work undertaken will determine the necessary  working space and the assortment of tools needful. Other things being  equal, the most complete assortment of tools and supplies makes possible  the production of the best work in the minimum time. The equipment of  the beginner need be but small and inexpensive, however, increasing the  same as he discovers what is most necessary and desirable, in an  increasing field of work. Wonderful pieces of taxidermy have been done  with a pocket knife, pliers, needle and thread, some wire, tow and  arsenic.    If no other room offers, much may be achieved (with the permission of  the lady of the house) in a corner of a dining room or kitchen. A room  or part of one well lighted, by north window or sky-light preferably,  makes the best location for the work table. This table may be of the  common unpainted kitchen variety for all small work. It is well to make  the top double by hinging on two leaves, which when extended will make  it twice its usual width. When so extended and supported by swinging  brackets it is specially adapted to sewing on rugs and robes. Such  tables usually have one or two shallow drawers which are most useful to  hold small tools. A shelf should be fitted between the legs, six or  eight inches from the floor, forming a handy place for boxes of  materials, books, etc.    [Illustration: WORK TABLE-SUPPLIES ON LOWER SHELF, TOOLS, ETC. ON WALL.]    If large work is in prospect a table should be built of the usual  heighth, two or three feet wide, and six long. The legs of stout  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23280"],[0,"The Shirley Letters from California Mines in 1851-52 (#2)"],[1,"time of Shirley's arrival, which was only a  few days prior to the death, and they had not met. The funeral service  was held at the log-cabin residence, which had \"one large opening in  the wall to admit light.\" The \"large opening\" was not, in the first  intention, to admit light. Shirley says (post, p. 70),--        It has no window, all the light admitted entering through an      aperture where there _will_ be a door when it becomes cold enough      for such a luxury.    Describing the service, the Doctor says, in part,--        After a long and wandering impromptu prayer by somebody, a prayer      which \"Shirley\" found disagreeable (since she herself was a      churchwoman, and missed the burial service), the procession,      containing twenty men and three women, set out.    Shirley was not, at that time, a churchwoman, and her account of the  prayer, etc., is,--        About twenty men, with the three women of the place, had assembled      at the funeral. An extempore prayer was made, filled with all the      peculiarities usual to that style of petition. Ah, how different      from the soothing verses of the glorious burial service of the      church!    It may not be inappropriate here to note that the baby referred to in  the two immediately preceding pages is none other than the original of  The Luck in Bret Harte's Luck of Roaring Camp. How the funeral scene as  described by Shirley was adapted by this master of short-story writing,  and how skillfully he combined it with the birth of The Luck, may be  perceived in the two paragraphs following.        [Shirley, post, p. 70.] On a board, supported by two butter-tubs,      was extended the body of the dead woman, covered with a sheet. By      its side stood the coffin, of unstained pine, lined with white      cambric.        [The Luck of Roaring Camp, Overland, vol. i, p. 184.] Beside the      low bunk or shelf, on which the figure of the mother was starkly      outlined below the blankets, stood a pine table. On this a      candle-box was placed, and within it, swathed in staring red      flannel, lay the last arrival at Roaring Camp.    Bancroft (History of California, vol. vii, p. 724), speaking of early  California literature, says,--        Mining life in California furnished inexhaustible material;... and      almost every book produced in the golden era gave specimens more or      less entertaining of the wit and humor developed by the struggle      with homelessness, physical suffering, and mental gloom. And when,      perchance, a writer had never heard original tales of the kind he      felt himself expected to relate, he took them at second-hand....      Even the most powerful of Bret Harte's stories borrowed their      incidents from the letters of Mrs. Laura A. K. Clapp, who under the      nom de plume of 'Shirley,' wrote a series of letters published in      the _Pioneer Magazine_, 1851-2. The 'Luck of Roaring Camp' was      suggested by incidents related in Letter II., p. 174-6 of vol. i.      of the _Pioneer_. In Letter XIX., p. 103-10 of vol. iv., is the      suggestion of the 'Outcasts of Poker Flat.' Mrs. Clapp's simple      epistolary style narrates the facts, and Harte's exquisite style      imparts to them the glamour of imagination.    The temptation cannot be resisted, at this point, to pursue the history  of The Luck of Roaring Camp a little further. The reader will kindly  remember that no changes are made in printing extracts. Mr. T. Edgar  Pemberton, in his Bret Harte: A Treatise and a Tribute (London, 1900),  says, in referring to criticism of the story when it was first in  type,--        Mr. Noah Brooks has recorded this strange incident as follows:--        'Perhaps I may be pardoned,' he says, 'for a brief reference to an      odd complication that arose while _The Luck of Roaring Camp_ was      being put into type in the printing office where _The Overland      Monthly_ was prepared for publication. A young lady who served as      proof-reader in the establishment had been somewhat shocked by the      scant morals of the mother of Luck, and when she came to the scene      where Kentuck, after reverently fondling the infant, said, \"he      wrastled with my finger, the d----d little cuss,\" the indignant      proof-reader was ready to throw up her engagement rather than go      any further with a story so wicked and immoral. There was      consternation throughout the establishment, and the head of the      concern went to the office of the publisher with the virginal      proof-reader's protest. Unluckily, Mr. Roman was absent from the      city. Harte, when notified of the obstacle raised in the way of      _The Luck of Roaring Camp_, manfully insisted that the story must      be printed as he wrote it, or not at all. Mr. Roman's _locum      tenens_ in despair brought the objectionable manuscript around to      my office and asked my advice. When I had read the sentence that      had caused all this turmoil, having first listened to the tale of      the much-bothered temporary publisher, I surprised him by a burst      of laughter. It seemed to me incredible that such a tempest in a      tea-cup could have been raised by Harte's bit of character      sketching. But, recovering my gravity, I advised that the whole      question should await Mr. Roman's return. I was sure that he would      never consent to any \"editing\" of Harte's story. This was agreed      to, and when the publisher came back, a few days later, the embargo      was removed. _The Luck of Roaring Camp_ was printed as it was      written, and printing office and vestal proof-reader survived the      shock.'        It is amazing to think that, but for the determination and      self-confidence of quite a young author, a story that has gladdened      and softened the hearts of thousands,--a story that has drawn      welcome smiles and purifying tears from all who can appreciate its      deftly-mingled humour and pathos,--a story that has been a boon to      humanity--might have been sacrificed to the shallow ruling of a      prudish 'young-lady' proof-reader, and a narrow-minded, pharisaical      deacon-printer!        It is appalling to think what might have happened if through      nervousness or modesty the writer had been frightened by the      premature criticisms of this precious pair.    The \"deacon-printer\" mentioned by Pemberton was Jacob Bacon, a fine  specimen of the printer of the latter half of the last century. He was  the junior partner of the firm of Towne and Bacon, the printers of  Harte's _first_ volume, The Lost Galleon. Mr. Towne (not _Tane_, as  spelled in Merwin's Life of Bret Harte) obtained judgment in Boston for  the printing of that volume. (See further, Mrs. T. B. Aldrich's  Crowding Memories, as to satisfaction of judgment.)    A half-tone portrait of the \"prudish 'young-lady' proof-reader\" (what a  lacerating taunt!) is printed in the Bret Harte Memorial Number of the  Overland (September, 1902).    The proof-readers have not dealt kindly with The Luck of Roaring Camp;  but the first of that ilk to mutilate the story was also the worst, to  wit, the aforesaid \"prudish 'young-lady' proof-reader.\"    Good usage in typography was utterly unknown to this young  lady,--punctuation, capitalization, the use of the hyphen in dividing  and compounding words. In practice she did not--perhaps could  not--recognize any distinction between a cipher and a lower-case _o_.  As to spelling, one may find \"etherial,\" \"azalias,\" \"tessallated.\"    Noah Brooks, in the Overland Memorial Number, says (p. 203),--        He [Bret Harte] collected some half-dozen stories and poems and      they were printed in a volume entitled \"The Luck of Roaring Camp      and Other Sketches,\" (1870.)    There were no poems printed in that volume. It was published in Boston  by Fields, Osgood, & Co. Printed at the University Press at Cambridge,  then unquestionably the best book-printing house in the United States,  of course many of the typographical errors were weeded out. This volume  was reprinted in London by John Camden Hotten.    It is to be regretted that the University Press was not more  painstaking in the proof-reading, for the Overland typographical  perversions persist in some instances to the present day. The reader is  not misled by the lubbering punctuation of the sentence, \"She was a  coarse, and, it is to be feared, a very sinful woman.\" The usage in  such a construction is, \"She was a coarse, and it is to be feared a  very sinful, woman.\" But note where the sense is affected:--        Cherokee Sal was sinking fast. Within an hour she had climbed, as      it were, that rugged road that led to the stars, and so passed out      of Roaring Camp, its sin and shame forever.    Cherokee Sal could not possibly be the sin and shame of Roaring Camp  forever; hence the sense calls for a comma after \"shame,\" in the  extract. It is gratifying to note that the comma is used in the Hotten  reprint.    Another egregious blunder which has persisted is the printing of the  word \"past\" for \"passed,\" in the extract below.        Then he [Kentuck] walked up the gulch, past the cabin, still      whistling with demonstrative unconcern. At a large redwood tree he      paused and retraced his steps, and again passed the cabin.    It remained for a proof-reader at the Riverside Press to reconstruct  the sentence by deleting the comma after the word \"gulch\"; thus, \"the  gulch past the cabin.\" That Kentuck \"again passed the cabin\" seems not  to have been considered. Hence, in the Houghton Mifflin Company's  printings of The Luck of Roaring Camp, the last error is worse than the  first.    These errors are not venial. Those that are such have not been  mentioned, as they occur in almost every book, and appear to be  unavoidable. Other errors, evincing a lack of knowledge of good usage  in book-typography, must also pass unnoticed.    The Luck of Roaring Camp having been"]]]
