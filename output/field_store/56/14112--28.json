[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2126"],[0,"The Quest of the Sacred Slipper (#2)"],[1,"constantly reverted to the  incidents of the voyage home.  I was perfectly convinced that the  curtain had been partially raised upon some fantasy in which  Professor Deeping figured.    But I had seen no more of Deeping nor had I heard from him, when  abruptly I found myself plunged again into the very vortex of his  troubled affairs.  I was half way through a long article, I  remember, upon the mystery of the outrage at the docks.  The poor  steward whose hand had been severed lay in a precarious condition,  but the police had utterly failed to trace the culprit.    I had laid down my pen to relight my pipe (the hour was about ten  at night) when a faint sound from the direction of the outside  door attracted my attention.  Something had been thrust through  the letter-box.    \"A circular,\" I thought, when the bell rang loudly, imperatively.    I went to the door.  A square envelope lay upon the mat--a  curious envelope, pale amethyst in colour.  Picking it up, I found  it to bear my name--written simply--    \"Mr. Cavanagh.\"    Tearing it open I glanced at the contents.  I threw open the door.  No one was visible upon the landing, but when I leaned over the  banister a white-clad figure was crossing the hall, below.    Without hesitation, hatless, I raced down the stairs.  As I crossed  the dimly lighted hall and came out into the peaceful twilight of  the court, my elusive visitor glided under the archway opposite.    Just where the dark and narrow passage opened on to Fleet Street  I overtook her--a girl closely veiled and wrapped in a long coat  of white ermine.    \"Madam,\" I said.    She turned affrightedly.    \"Please do not detain me!\"  Her accent was puzzling, but pleasing.  She glanced apprehensively about her.    You have seen the moon through a mist?--and known it for what it  was in spite of its veiling?  So, now, through the cloudy folds  of the veil, I saw the stranger's eyes, and knew them for the most  beautiful eyes I had ever seen, had ever dreamt of.    \"But you must explain the meaning of your note!\"    \"I cannot!  I cannot!  Please do not ask me!\"    She was breathless from her flight and seemed to be trembling.  From behind the cloud her eyes shone brilliantly, mysteriously.    I was sorely puzzled.  The whole incident was bizarre--indeed, it  had in it something of the uncanny.  Yet I could not detain the girl  against her will.  That she went in apprehension of something, of  someone, was evident.    Past the head of the passage surged the noisy realities of Fleet  Street.  There were men there in quest of news; men who would  have given much for such a story as this in which I was becoming  entangled.  Yet a story more tantalizingly incomplete could not  well be imagined.    I knew that I stood upon the margin of an arena wherein strange  adversaries warred to a strange end.  But a mist was over all.  Here, beside me, was one who could disperse the mist--and would  not.  Her one anxiety seemed to be to escape.    Suddenly she raised her veil; and I looked fully into the only  really violet eyes I had ever beheld.  Mentally, I started.  For  the face framed in the snowy fur was the most bewitchingly lovely  imaginable.  One rebellious lock of wonderful hair swept across  the white brow.  It was brown hair, with an incomprehensible  sheen in the high lights that suggested the heart of a blood-red  rose.    \"Oh,\" she cried, \"promise me that you will never breathe a word  to any one about my visit!\"    \"I promise willingly,\" I said; \"but can you give me no hint?\"    \"Honestly, truly, I cannot, dare not, say more!  Only promise that  you will do as I ask!\"    Since I could perceive no alternative--    \"I will do so,\" I replied.    \"Thank you--oh, thank you!\" she said; and dropping her veil again  she walked rapidly away from me, whispering, \"I rely upon you.  Do  not fail me.  Good-bye!\"    Her conspicuous white figure joined the hurrying throngs upon the  pavement beyond.  My curiosity brooked no restraint.  I hurried to  the end of the courtway.  She was crossing the road.  From the  shadows where he had lurked, a man came forward to meet her.  A  vehicle obstructed the view ere I could confirm my impression; and  when it had passed, neither my lovely visitor nor her companion  were anywhere in sight.    But, unless some accident of light and shade had deceived me, the  man who had waited was Ahmad Ahmadeen!    It seemed that some astral sluice-gate was raised; a dreadful sense  of foreboding for the first time flooded my mind.  Whilst the girl  had stood before me it had been different--the mysterious charm of  her personality had swamped all else.  But now, the messenger gone,  it was the purport of her message which assumed supreme significance.    Written in odd, square handwriting upon the pale amethyst paper,  this was the message--      Prevail upon Professor Deeping to place what he has in the brown    case in the porch of his house to-night.  If he fails to do so,    no power on earth can save him from the Scimitar of Hassan.                                                             A FRIEND.          CHAPTER III    \"HASSAN OF ALEPPO\"      Professor Deeping's number was in the telephone directory,  therefore, on returning to my room, where there still lingered the  faint perfume of my late visitor's presence, I asked for his number.  He proved to be at home.    \"Strange you should ring me up, Cavanagh,\" he said; \"for I was  about to ring you up.\"    \"First,\" I replied, \"listen to the contents of an anonymous letter  which I have received.\"    (I remembered, and only just in time, my promise to the veiled  messenger.)    \"To me,\" I added, having read him the note, \"it seems to mean  nothing.  I take it that you understand better than I do.\"    \"I understand very well, Cavanagh!\" he replied.  \"You will recall  my story of the scimitar which flashed before me in the darkness  of my stateroom on the Mandalay?  Well, I have seen it again!  I  am not an imaginative man: I had always believed myself to possess  the scientific mind; but I can no longer doubt that I am the object  of a pursuit which commenced in Mecca!  The happenings on the  steamer prepared me for this, in a degree.  When the man lost his  hand at Port Said I doubted.  I had supposed the days of such things  past.  The attempt to break into my stateroom even left me still  uncertain.  But the outrage upon the steward at the docks removed  all further doubt.  I perceived that the contents of a certain brown  leather case were the objective of the crimes.\"    I listened in growing wonder.    \"It was not necessary in order to further the plan of stealing the  bag that the hands were severed,\" resumed the Professor.  \"In fact,  as was rendered evident by the case of the steward, this was a  penalty visited upon any one who touched it!  You are thinking of  my own immunity?\"    \"I am!\"    \"This is attributable to two things.  Those who sought to recover  what I had in the case feared that my death en route might result  in its being lost to them for ever.  They awaited a suitable  opportunity.  They had designed to take it at Port Said certainly,  I think; but the bag was too large to be readily concealed, and,  after the outrage, might have led to the discovery of the culprit.  In the second place, they are uncertain of my faith.  I have long  passed for a true Believer in the East!  As a Moslem I visited  Mecca--\"    \"You visited Mecca!\"    \"I had just returned from the hadj when I joined the Mandalay at  Port Said!  My death, however, has been determined upon, whether  I be Moslem or Christian!\"    \"Why?\"    \"Because,\" came the Professor's harsh voice over the telephone, \"of  the contents of the brown leather case!  I will not divulge to you  now the nature of these contents; to know might endanger you.  But  the case is locked in my safe here, and the key, together with a  full statement of the true facts of the matter, is hidden behind  the first edition copy of my book 'Assyrian Mythology,' in the  smaller bookcase--\"    \"Why do you tell me all this?\" I interrupted.    He laughed harshly.    \"The identity of my pursuer has just dawned upon me,\" he said.  \"I  know that my life is in real danger.  I would give up what is  demanded of me, but I believe its possession to be my strongest  safeguard.\"    Mystery upon mystery!  I seemed to be getting no nearer to the heart  of this maze.  What in heaven's name did it all mean?  Suddenly an  idea struck me.    \"Is our late fellow passenger, Mr. Ahmadeen, connected with the  matter?\" I asked.    \"In no way,\" replied Deeping earnestly.  \"Mr. Ahmadeen is, I  believe, a person of some consequence in the Moslem world; but I  have nothing to fear from him.\"    \"What steps have you taken to protect yourself?\"    Again the short laugh reached my ears.    \"I'm afraid long residence in the East has rendered me something of  a fatalist, Cavanagh!  Beyond keeping my door locked, I have taken  no steps whatever.  I fear I am quite accessible!\"    A while longer we talked; and with every word the conviction was  more strongly borne in upon me that some uncanny menace threatened  the peace, perhaps the life, of Professor Deeping.    I had hung up the receiver scarce a moment when, acting upon a  sudden determination, I called up New Scotland Yard, and asked for  Detective-Inspector Bristol, whom I knew well.  A few words were  sufficient keenly to arouse his curiosity, and he announced his  intention of calling upon me immediately.  He was in charge of the  case of the severed hand.    I made no attempt to resume work in the interval preceding his  arrival.  I had not long to wait, however, ere Bristol was ringing  my bell; and I hurried to the door, only too glad to confide in one  so well equipped to analyze my doubts and fears.  For Bristol is no  ordinary policeman, but a trained observer, who, when I first made  his acquaintance, completely upset my ideas upon the mental"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21272"],[0,"The Bibliotaph, and Other People (#2)"],[1,"books for years in the huge  garret of a farmhouse standing upon the outskirts of a Westchester  County village. A good relative 'mothered' the books for him in his  absence. When the collection outgrew the garret it was moved into a  big village store. It was the wonder of the place. The country folk  flattened their noses against the panes and tried to peer into the  gloom beyond the half-drawn shades. The neighboring stores were in  comparison miracles of business activity. On one side was a  harness-shop; on the other a nondescript establishment at which one  might buy anything, from sunbonnets and corsets to canned salmon and  fresh eggs. Between these centres of village life stood the silent  tomb for books. The stranger within the gates had this curiosity  pointed out to him along with the new High School and the Soldiers'  Monument.    By shading one's eyes to keep away the glare of the light, it was  possible to make out tall carved oaken cases with glass doors, which  lined the walls. They gave distinction to the place. It was not  difficult to understand the point of view of the dressmaker from  across the way who stepped over to satisfy her curiosity concerning  the stranger, and his concerning the books, and who said in a friendly  manner as she peered through a rent in the adjoining shade, 'It's  almost like a cathedral, ain't it?'    To an inquiry about the owner of the books she replied that he was  brought up in that county; that there were people around there who  said that he had been an exhorter years ago; her impression was that  now he was a 'political revivalist,' if I knew what that was.    The phrase seemed hopeless, but light was thrown upon it when, later,  I learned that this man of many buried books gave addresses upon the  responsibilities of citizenship, upon the higher politics, and upon  themes of like character. They said that he was humorous. The farmers  liked to hear him speak. But it was rumored that he went to colleges,  too. The dressmaker thought that the buying of so many books was  'wicked.' 'He goes from New York to Beersheba, and from Chicago to  Dan, buying books. Never reads 'em because he hardly ever comes here.'    It became possible to identify the Bibliotaph of the country store  with a certain mature youth who some time since 'gave his friends the  slip, chose land-travel or seafaring,' and has not returned to build  the town house with proper library. They who observed him closely  thought that he resembled Heber in certain ways. Perhaps this fact  alone would justify an attempt at a verbal portrait. But the  additional circumstance that, in days when people with the slightest  excuse therefor have themselves regularly photographed, this  old-fashioned youth refused to allow his 'likeness' to be taken,--this  circumstance must do what it can to extenuate minuteness of detail in  the picture, as well as over-attention to points of which a photograph  would have taken no account.    You are to conceive of a man between thirty-eight and forty years of  age, big-bodied, rapidly acquiring that rotund shape which is thought  becoming to bishops, about six feet high though stooping a little,  prodigiously active, walking with incredible rapidity, having large  limbs, large feet, large though well-shaped and very white hands; in  short, a huge fellow physically, as big of heart as of body, and, in  the affectionate thought of those who knew him best, as big of  intellect as of heart.    His head might be described as leonine. It was a massive head, covered  with a tremendous mane of brown hair. This was never worn long, but it  was so thick and of such fine texture that it constituted a real  beauty. He had no conceit of it, being innocent of that peculiar  German type of vanity which runs to hair, yet he could not prevent  people from commenting on his extraordinary hirsute adornment. Their  occasional remarks excited his mirth. If they spoke of it again, he  would protest. Once, among a small party of his closest friends, the  conversation turned upon the subject of hair, and then upon the beauty  of _his_ hair; whereupon he cried out, 'I am embarrassed by this  unnecessary display of interest in my Samsonian assertiveness.'    He loved to tease certain of his acquaintances who, though younger  than himself, were rapidly losing their natural head-covering. He  prodded them with ingeniously worded reflections upon their unhappy  condition. He would take as a motto Erasmus's unkind salutation, 'Bene  sit tibi cum tuo calvitio,' and multiply amusing variations upon it.  He delighted in sending them prescriptions and advertisements clipped  from newspapers and medical journals. He quoted at them the remark of  a pale, bald, blond young literary aspirant, who, seeing him, the  Bibliotaph, passing by, exclaimed audibly and almost passionately,  'Oh, I perfectly adore _hair_!'    Of his clothes it might be said that he did not wear them, but rather  dwelt at large in them. They were made by high-priced tailors and were  fashionably cut, but he lived in them so violently--that is, traveled  so much, walked so much, sat so long and so hard, gestured so  earnestly, and carried in his many pockets such an extraordinary  collection of notebooks, indelible pencils, card-cases, stamp-boxes,  penknives, gold toothpicks, thermometers, and what not--that within  twenty-four hours after he had donned new clothes all the artistic  merits of the garments were obliterated; they were, from every point  of view, hopelessly degenerate.    He was a scrupulously clean man, but there was a kind of civilized  wildness in his appearance which astonished people; and in perverse  moments he liked to terrify those who knew him but little by affirming  that he was a near relative of Christopher Smart, and then explaining  in mirth-provoking phrases that one of the arguments used for proving  Smart's insanity was that he did not love clean linen.    His appetite was large, as became a large and active person. He was a  very valiant trencher-man; and yet he could not have been said to love  eating for eating's sake. He ate when he was hungry, and found no  difficulty in being hungry three times a day. He should have been an  Englishman, for he enjoyed a late supper. In the proper season this  consisted of a bountiful serving of tomatoes, cucumbers, onions, with  a glass of lemonade. As a variant upon the beverage he took milk. He  was the only man I have known, whether book-hunter or layman, who  could sleep peacefully upon a supper of cucumbers and milk.    There is probably no occult relation between first editions and  onions. The Bibliotaph was mightily pleased with both: the one, he  said, appealed to him aesthetically, the other dietetically. He  remarked of some particularly large Spanish onions that there was 'a  globular wholesomeness about them which was very gratifying;' and  after eating one he observed expansively that he felt 'as if he had  swallowed the earth and the fullness thereof.' His easy, good-humored  exaggerations and his odd comments upon the viands made him a pleasant  table companion: as when he described a Parker House Sultana Roll by  saying that 'it looked like the sanguinary output of the whole Crimean  war.'    High-priced restaurants did not please him as well as humbler and less  obtrusive places. But it was all one,--Delmonico's, the Bellevue, a  stool in the Twelfth Street Market, or a German cafe on Van Buren  Street. The humors of certain eating-houses gave him infinite delight.  He went frequently to the Diner's Own Home, the proprietor of which,  being both cook and Christian, had hit upon the novel plan of giving  Scriptural advice and practical suggestions by placards on the walls.  The Bibliotaph enjoyed this juxtaposition of signs: the first read,  'The very God of peace sanctify you wholly;' the second, 'Look out for  your Hat and Coat.'    The Bibliotaph had no home, and was reputed to live in his post-office  box. He contributed to the support of at least three clubs, but was  very little seen at any one of them. He enjoyed the large cities, and  was contented in whichever one he happened to find himself. He was  emphatically a city man, but what city was of less import. He knew  them all, and was happy in each. He had his favorite hotel, his  favorite bath, his work, bushels of newspapers and periodicals,  friends who rejoiced in his coming as children in the near advent of  Christmas, and finally book-shops in which to browse at his pleasure.  It was interesting to hear him talk about city life. One of his quaint  mannerisms consisted in modifying a well-known quotation to suit his  conversational needs. 'Why, sir,' he would remark, 'Fleet Street has a  very animated appearance, but I think the full tide of human existence  is at the corner of Madison and State.'    His knowledge of cities was both extensive and peculiar. I have heard  him name in order all the hotels on Broadway, beginning at the lower  end and coming up as far as hotels exist, branching off upon the  parallel and cross streets where there were noted caravansaries, and  connecting every name with an event of importance, or with the life  and fortunes of some noted man who had been guest at that particular  inn. This was knowledge more becoming in a guide, perhaps, but it will  illustrate the encyclopaedic fullness of his miscellaneous information.    As was natural and becoming in a man born within forty miles of the  metropolis, he liked best the large cities of the East, and was least  content in small Western cities. But this was the outcome of no  illiberal prejudice, and there was a quizzical smile upon his lips and  a teasing look in his eyes when he bantered a Westerner. 'A man,' he  would sometimes say, 'may come by the mystery of childbirth into Omaha  or Kansas City and be content, but he can't come by Boston, New York,  or Philadelphia.' Then, a moment later, "]]]
