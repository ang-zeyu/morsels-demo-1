They  took him a prisoner oncet, and instead of killin' him, they was about  ready to make him chief--he pretended all the while as how he'd like  that--when he got away from 'em. He was such a good fellow that them  Injuns admired his shrewdness, and they let him do about what he  pleased. So he thought they'd let Father alone.    \"Well, your grandfather was a Quaker, you see, and believed in treatin'  them red devils well--like William Penn done, you know. He was a man for  peace and quiet, and everything was goin' smooth with the tribes of what  we called the Beargrass Country, till one day, when he and my brothers,  Mordecai--'Mord' was a big fellow for his age--and Josiah, a few years  younger--was out in the clearin' with the oxen, haulin' logs down to the  crick. I went along too, but I didn't help much--for I was only six.    \"Young as I was, I remember what happened that day like it was only  yesterday. It come like a bolt out of the blue. We see Father drop like  he was shot--for he _was_ shot! Then I heard the crack of a rifle and I  saw a puff of smoke floatin' out o' the bushes.    \"Injuns!\" gasps Mord, and starts on the run for the house--to get his  gun. Josiah, he starts right off in the opposite direction to the  Beargrass fort--we called it a fort, but it was nothin' but a stockade.  The way we boys scattered was like a brood o' young turkeys, or  pa'tridges, strikin' for cover when the old one is shot. I knowed I'd  ought to run too, but I didn't want to leave my father layin' there on  the ground. Seemed like I'd ought to woke him up so he could run too.  Yet I didn't feel like touchin' him. I think I must 'a' knowed he was  dead.    \"While I was standin' still, starin' like the oxen, not knowin' what to  do, a big Injun come out o' the brush, with a big knife in his hand. I  knowed what he was goin' to do--skelp my father! I braced up to 'im to  keep 'im away, an' he jist laffed at me. I never think what the devil  looks like without seein' that red demon with his snaky black eyes,  grinnin' at me!      TOM LINCOLN CHASED BY INDIANS    \"He picked me up like I was a baby an set me on the sawlog, an' was  turnin' back to skelp Father, when--biff!--another gun-crack--and Mr.  Big Indian he drops jist like your grandfather did, only he wriggles and  squirms around, bitin' the dust--like a big snake for all the world!    \"I was standin' there, kind o' dazed, watchin' another puff o' white  smoke, comin' out between two logs in the side of our house. Then I  knowed 'Mord' had shot my Injun. He had run in, got the gun down off'n  the wall, an' peekin' out through a crack, he sees that Injun takin'  hold o' me. Waitin' till the ol' demon turns away, so's not to hit me,  'Mord' he aims at a silver dangler on Mr. Injun's breast and makes him  drop in his tracks like I said. Your Uncle 'Mord' he was a sure  shot--like Cousin Dan'l Boone.    \"Then I hears the most blood-curdlin' yells, and a lot o' red devils  jump out o' the bushes an' come for me brandishin' their tomahawks an'  skelpin' knives. It was like hell broke loose. They had been watchin'  an', of course, 'twas all right to kill Father, but when 'Mord' killed  one o' their bucks, that made a big difference. I had sense enough left  to run for the house with them Injuns after me. Seemed like I couldn't  run half as fast as usual, but I must 'a' made purty good time, from  what 'Mord' an' Mother said afterward.    \"He said one was ahead o' the rest an' had his tomahawk raised to brain  me with it when--bing!--an' 'Mord' fetches _him_ down like he did the  fellow that was goin' to skelp Father. That made the others mad an' they  took after me, but 'Mord' he drops the head one jist when he's goin' to  hit me. But all I knowed at the time was that them red devils was  a-chasin' me, and I'd got to 'leg it' for dear life!    \"When I gits near enough to the house, I hears Mother and 'Mord'  hollerin' to make me run faster and go to the door, for Mother had it  open jist wide enough to reach out an' snatch me in--when the third  Injun was stoopin' to grab me, but 'Mord' makes him bite the dust like  the others.    \"My, but wasn't them Injuns mad! Some of 'em sneaked around behind the  house--they had to give 'Mord's' gun a wide berth to git there!--but he  could only protect the front--and was a-settin' fire to our cabin to  smoke us out or roast us alive, jist when the soldiers come with Josiah  from the fort and saved our lives. Then the Injuns made 'emselves  scurce--but they druv off the oxen and all our other stock.      \"MORD\" LINCOLN, INDIAN FIGHTER    \"That was the breaking up of our family. None of us boys was old enough  to take Father's place, an' Mother she was afraid to live there alone.  Accordin' to the laws o' Virginia--Kentucky belonged to Virginia  then--the oldest son got all the proputty, so 'Mord' he gets it all. He  was welcome to it too, for he was the only one of us that could take  care of it. 'Mord' he wasn't satisfied with killin' a few Injuns that  day to revenge Father's death. He made a business of shootin' 'em on  sight--a reg'lar Injun stalker! He couldn't see that he was jist as  savage as the worst Injun, to murder 'em without waitin' to see whether  Mr. Injun was a friend or a foe.    \"Oncet when I told 'im there was good an' bad red men like they wuz good  an' bad white men, he said I might jist as well say 'good _devil_' as  'good Injun!' He says 'the only good Injun's the dead Injun!'    \"Well, the settlers must 'a' 'greed with 'Mord,' for they made him  sheriff o' the county--he was sech a good shot, too--an' they 'lected  him to the Legislatur' after Kentucky come in as a State. He stood high  in the county. Folks didn't mind his shootin' an' Injun or two, more or  less, when he got the chancet. They all looked on redskins like they  was catamounts an' other pesky varmints.    \"Your grandmother Lincoln an' Josiah an' me moved over into Washington  County, but she had hard scrabblin' to git a livin'. Josiah he stayed  with her, an' between him an' 'Mord,' they helped her along, but I had  to git out and scratch for a livin'. From the time I was ten I was hired  out to work for my 'keep,' an' anything else I could git. I knocked  aroun' the country, doin' this, that an' t'other thing till I picked up  carpenterin' o' Joseph Hanks, a cousin o' mine, an' there I met his  sister Nancy, an' that's how she come to be your mother--an' 'bout how I  come to be your father, too!\"    Little is known today of Mordecai Lincoln, and there would be less  interest in poor Thomas if he had not become the father of Abraham  Lincoln, the sixteenth President of the United States. Mordecai Lincoln  was a joker and humorist. One who knew him well said of him:    \"He was a man of great drollery, and it would almost make you laugh to  look at him. I never saw but one other man whose quiet, droll look  excited in me the disposition to laugh, and that was 'Artemus Ward.'    \"Mordecai was quite a story-teller, and in this Abe resembled his 'Uncle  Mord,' as we called him. He was an honest man, as tender-hearted as a  woman, and to the last degree charitable and benevolent.    \"Abe Lincoln had a very high opinion of his uncle, and on one occasion  remarked, 'I have often said that Uncle Mord had run off with all the  talents of the family.'\"    In a letter about his family history, just before he was nominated for  the presidency, Abraham Lincoln wrote:    \"My parents were both born in Virginia, of undistinguished  families--second families, perhaps I should say. My mother was of a  family of the name of Hanks. My paternal grandfather, Abraham Lincoln,  emigrated from Rockingham County, Virginia, to Kentucky about 1781 or 2,  where, a year or two later, he was killed by Indians--not in battle, but  by stealth, when he was laboring to open a farm in the forest. His  ancestors, who were Quakers, went to Virginia from Berks County,  Pennsylvania. An effort to identify them with the New England family of  the same name ended in nothing more definite than a similarity of  Christian names in both families, such as Enoch, Levi, Mordecai,  Solomon, Abraham, and the like.    \"My father, at the death of his father, was but six years of age; and he  grew up, literally without education.\"          CHAPTER II    ABRAHAM LINCOLN'S FATHER AND MOTHER      While Thomas Lincoln was living with a farmer and doing odd jobs of  carpentering, he met Nancy Hanks, a tall, slender woman, with dark skin,  dark brown hair and small, deep-set gray eyes. She had a full forehead,  a sharp, angular face and a sad expression. Yet her disposition was  generally cheerful. For her backwoods advantages she was considered well  educated. She read well and could write, too. It is stated that Nancy  Hanks taught Thomas Lincoln to write his own name. Thomas was  twenty-eight and Nancy twenty-three when their wedding day came.  Christopher Columbus Graham, when almost one hundred years old, gave  the following description of the marriage feast of the Lincoln bride  and groom:    \"I am one of the two living men who can prove that Abraham Lincoln, or  Linkhorn, as the family was miscalled, was born in lawful wedlock, for I  saw Thomas Lincoln marry Nancy Hanks on the 12th day of June, 1806. I  was hunting roots for my medicine and just went to the wedding to get a  good supper and got it.    \"Tom Lincoln was a carpenter, and a good one for those days, when a  cabin was built mainly with the ax, and not a nail or a bolt or hinge in  it, only leathers and pins to the doors, and no glass, except in watches  and spectacles and bottles. Tom had the best set of tools in what was  then and is now Washington County.    \"Jesse Head, the good Methodist minister that married them, was also a  carpenter or cabinet maker by trade, and as he was then a neighbor, they  were good friends.    \"While you pin me down to facts, I will say that I "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22965"],[0,"Ten Thousand Miles with a Dog Sled (#2)"],[1,"licensed liquor-dealers do not themselves sell to Indians, but they  notoriously sell to men who notoriously peddle to Indians, and the  suppression of this illicit commerce would materially reduce the total  sales of liquor.    Some measure of protection, one thinks, must also be afforded against a  predatory class of Indian traders, the back rooms of whose stores are  often barrooms, gambling-dens, and houses of assignation, and  headquarters and harbourage for the white degenerates--even if the  government go the length of setting up co-operative Indian stores in the  interior, as has been done in some places on the coast. This last is a  matter in which the missions are helpless, for there is no wise  combination of religion and trade.    So this book goes forth with a plea in the front of it, which will find  incidental support and expression throughout it, for the natives of  interior Alaska, that they be not wantonly destroyed off the face of the  earth.            HUDSON STUCK.            NEW YORK,          _March, 1914._          PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION      IT is gratifying to know that a second edition of this book has been  called for and it is interesting to write another preface; it even  proved interesting to do what was set about most reluctantly--the  reading of the book over again after entire avoidance of it for two  years. It was necessary to do it, though one shrank from it, and it is  interesting to know that after this comparatively long and complete  detachment I find little to add and less to correct. Upon a complete  rereading I am content to let the book stand, with two or three  footnotes thrown in, and the correction of the one printer's error it  contained from cover to cover--an error that a score of kind  correspondents pointed out, for it was conspicuous in the title of a  picture.    The tendency to which attention is drawn in the original preface, the  pendulum swing from the old notion that Alaska is a land of polar bears  and icebergs to the new notion that it is a \"world's treasure-house of  mineral wealth and unbounded agricultural possibilities\" is yet more  marked than it was two years ago. The beginning of the building of the  government railway has given new impetus to the \"boosting\" writers for  magazines and newspapers. Quite recently it was stated in one such  publication that we need not worry about the destruction of our  forests, for had we not the inexhaustible timber resources of the  interior of Alaska to draw upon?    And in the North itself--though no one there would write about the  timber resources of the interior--in certain shrill journals the man who  does not confidently expect to see the Yukon Flats waving with golden  grain and \"the lowing herd wind slowly o'er the lea\" of the Koyukuk and  the Chandalar is regarded as a traitor to his country and his God. But  it must be remembered that there are a number of journalists in Alaska  who know nothing of the country outside their respective towns, and that  \"boosting\" grows shriller, as Eugene Field found red paint grow redder,  \"the further out West one goes.\" When they get a newspaper at Cape  Prince of Wales what a clarion it will be!    Truth, however, is not more wont than of old to be found in extremes,  and the author of this book believes that those who desire a sober view  of the country it deals with will find it herein. He claims no more than  that he has had adequate opportunity of forming his opinions and that he  has a right to their expression. It is now twelve years since he began  almost constant travelling, winter and summer, in the interior of  Alaska. He has described nothing that he has not seen; ventured no  judgment that he has not well digested, and has nothing to retract or  even modify; but he would repeat and emphasise a caution of the original  preface. Alaska is not one country but many countries, and so widely do  they differ from one another in almost every respect that no general  statements about Alaska can be true. The present author's knowledge of  the territory is confined in the main to the interior--to the valley of  the Yukon and its tributary rivers, which make up one of the world's  great waterways--and nothing of his writing applies, with his authority,  to other parts.    The matter of the preservation of the native peoples still presses, and  is nearer to the author's heart than any other matter whatever. The  United States Congress, which voted thirty-five millions of dollars for  the government railroad, strikes out year by year the modest additional  score or two of thousands that year by year the Bureau of Education asks  for the establishment of hospital work amongst the Indians of the  interior, and the preventable mortality continues to be very great.    In the last two years, largely as the result of the untiring efforts of  Bishop Rowe on behalf of the natives, two modern, well-equipped  hospitals have been built, with money that he and his clergy have  gathered, on the Yukon River, one at Fort Yukon and one at Tanana; and  these are the only places of any kind, on nearly a thousand miles of the  river, where sick or injured Indians may be received and cared for.    Amongst men of thought and feeling there is noticeable revulsion from  the supercilious attitude that used not to be uncommon toward the little  peoples of the world. It begins to be recognised that it is quite  possible that even the smallest of the little peoples may have some  contribution to make to the welfare and progress of the human race. What  is the Boy Scout movement that is sweeping the country, to the enormous  benefit of the rising generation, but the incorporating into the nurture  of our youth of the things that were the nurture of the Indian youth;  that are a large part of the nurture of the Alaskan Indian youth to-day?  And the camp-fire clubs and woodcraft associations and the whole trend  to the life of the open recognise that the Indian had developed a  technique of wilderness life deserving of preservation for its value to  the white man. While as for the Esquimaux, the author never sees the  extraordinary prevalence amongst them of the art of graphic delineation  displayed in bold etchings of incidents of the chase upon their  implements and weapons (though not upon the articles made by the dozen  for the curio-venders at Nome and Saint Michael) without dreaming that  some day an artist will come from out that singular and most interesting  people who shall teach the world something new about art.    Whatever the future may hold for the interior of Alaska, the author is  convinced that its population will derive very largely from the present  native stocks, and this alone would justify any efforts to prevent  further inroads upon their health and vitality.
