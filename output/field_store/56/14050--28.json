This piece of metal, when nicely fitted into a file handle, will  answer all the purposes of the bluing pan and presents quite a neat  appearance. Having placed the blank in the angle, lay on it a piece of  yellow wax about the size of a bean, and heat it over your lamp until the  wax takes fire and burns. Blow out the flame and allow the staff to cool,  and it will be found to be of about the right hardness.    [Illustration: _Fig. 3._]    We have now arrived at an important station in staff making, a junction,  we may term it, where many lines branch off from the main road. At this  particular spot is where authorities differ. I have no hesitation in  saying that at this particular point the split chuck should be removed  from the lathe head and carefully placed in the chuck box and the cement  chuck put in its place. I believe that all of the remaining work upon a  staff should be executed while it is held in a cement chuck. On the other  hand I have seen good workmen who turned and finished all the lower part  of a staff while in a split chuck, cut it off and turned and finished the  upper part in a cement chuck. All I have got to say is that they had more  confidence in the truth of their chucks than I have in mine. I have even  read of watchmakers who made the entire staff in a split chuck, but I  must confess I am somewhat curious to examine a staff made in that way,  and must have the privilege of examining it before I will admit that a  true staff can be so made.    We will suppose that the workman has a moderately true chuck, and that he  prefers to turn and finish all the lower portions in this way. Of course  the directions for using a cement chuck on the upper part of a staff are  equally applicable to the lower. Before going further I think it  advisable to consider the requirements of a pivot, but will reserve this  for another chapter.          CHAPTER II.      The chief requirements of a pivot are that it shall be round and well  polished. Avoid the burnish file at all hazards; it will not leave the  pivot round, for the pressure is unequal at various points in the  revolution. A pivot that was not perfectly round might act fairly well in  a jewel hole that was round, but unfortunately the greater proportion of  jewel holes are not as they should be, and we must therefore take every  precaution to guard against untrue pivots. Let us examine just what the  effect will be if an imperfect pivot is fitted into an unround hole  jewel, and to demonstrate its action more clearly let us exaggerate the  defects. Suppose we pick a perfectly round jewel and insert into the  opening a three-cornered piece of steel wire, in shape somewhat  resembling the taper of a triangular file. We find that this triangular  piece of steel will turn in the jewel with the same ease that the most  perfect cylindrical pivot will. Now suppose we change the jewel for one  that is out of round and repeat the experiment. We now find that the  triangular steel soon finds the hollow spots in the jewel hole and comes  to a stand-still as it is inserted in the hole. The action of a pivot  that is not true, when in contact with a jewel whose hole is out of  round, is very similar, though in a less marked degree. If the pivot  inclines toward the elliptical and the jewel hole has a like failing,  which is often the case, it is very evident that this want of truth in  both the pivot and hole is very detrimental to the good going of a watch.    [Illustration: _Fig. 4._]    [Illustration: _Fig. 5._]    There are two kinds of pivots, known respectively as straight and conical  pivots, but for the balance staff there is but one kind and that is the  conical, which is illustrated in Fig. 4. The conical pivot has at least  one advantage over the straight one, _i. e._, it can be made much smaller  than a straight pivot, as it is much stronger in proportion, owing to its  shape. All pivots have a tendency to draw the oil away from the jewels,  and particularly the conically formed variety, which develops a strong  capillary attraction. To prevent this capillary attraction of the oil,  the back-slope is formed next to the shoulder, although many persons seem  to think that this back-slope is merely added by way of ornament, to make  the pivot more graceful in appearance. It is very essential, however, for  if too much oil is applied the staff would certainly draw it away if its  thickness were not reduced, by means of the back-slope. Before leaving  the subject of capillarity let us examine the enlarged jewel in Fig. 5;  _c_ is an enlarged pivot, _b_ is the hole jewel and _a_ is the end stone.  We observe that the hole jewel on the side towards the end stone is  convex. It is so made that through capillarity the oil is retained at  the end of the pivot where it is most wanted. It is, in my opinion, very  necessary that the young watchmaker should have at least a fair  understanding of capillarity, and should understand why the end stone is  made convex and the pivot with a back slope. For this reason I will try  and make clear this point before proceeding further. We all know that it  is essential to apply oil to all surfaces coming in contact, in order to  reduce the friction as much as possible, and if the application of oil is  necessary to any part of the mechanism of a watch, that part is the  pivot. Saunier very aptly puts it thus: \"A liquid is subject to the  action of three forces: gravity, adhesion (the mutual attraction between  the liquid and the substance of the vessel containing it), and cohesion  (the attractive force existing among the molecules of the liquid and  opposing the subdivision of the mass.)\"    We all know that if we place a small drop of oil upon a piece of flat  glass or steel and then invert the same the oil will cling to the glass,  owing to the adhesion of the particles; if we then add a little more to  the drop and again invert, it will still cling, although the drop may be  elongated to a certain degree. This is owing to the cohesion of the  molecules of the oil, which refuse to be separated from one another. If,  however, we again add to the drop of oil and invert the plate the drop  will elongate and finally part, one portion dropping while the other  portion clings to the main body of the liquid. The fall of the drop is  occasioned by gravity overcoming the cohesion of the molecules. Now take  a perfectly clean and polished needle and place a drop of oil upon its  point and we will see that the oil very rapidly ascends towards the  thicker portion of the needle. Now if we heat and hammer out the point of  the needle into the form of a small drill and repeat the operation we  find that the oil no longer ascends. It rises from the point to the  extreme width of the drill portion, but refuses to go beyond. It clings  to that portion of the needle which would correspond to the ridge just  back of the slope in a conical pivot. Water, oil, etc., when placed in a  clean wine glass, do not exhibit a perfectly level surface, but raise at  the edges as shown at _a_ in Fig. 6. If a tube is now inserted, we find  that the liquid not only rises around the outside of the tube and the  edges of the vessel, but also rises in the tube far beyond its mean  level, as shown at _b_. These various effects are caused by one of the  forces above described, _i. e._, the adhesion, or mutual attraction  existing between the liquid and the substance of the vessel and rod. The  word capillarity is of Latin derivation, and signifies hair-like  slenderness. The smaller the tube, or the nearer the edges of a vessel  are brought together, the higher in proportion will the liquid rise above  the level. An ascent of a liquid, due to capillarity, also takes place,  where the liquid is placed between two separate bodies, as oil placed  between two pieces of flat glass. If the plates are parallel to one  another and perpendicular to the surface of the liquid it will ascend to  the same height between the plates, as shown at _c_ in Fig. 6. If the  plates were united at the back like a book and spread somewhat at the  front, the oil would ascend the higher as the two sides approach one  another, as shown at _d_, Fig. 6. If a drop is placed somewhat away from  the intersecting point, of the glasses, as shown at _m_ it will, if not  too far away, gradually work its way to the junction, providing the  glasses are level. If, however, the glasses are inclined to a certain  extent, the drop will remain stationary, since it is drawn in one  direction by gravity and in the other by capillarity. When a drop of oil  is placed between two surfaces, both of which are convex, or one convex  and the other plain, as shown at _g_, it will collect at the point _n_,  at which the surfaces nearest approach one another. We now see very  clearly why the hole jewel is made convex on the side towards the  end-stone and concave on the side towards the pivot.    [Illustration: _Fig. 6._]    Particular pains should be taken to polish those portions of the pivots  which actually enter the jewel hole and to see that all marks of the  graver be thoroughly removed, because if any grooves, no matter how  small, are left, they act as minute capillary tubes to convey the oil.    If the hole jewel be of the proper shape, the end-stone not too far from  the hole jewel and too much oil is not applied at one time, the oil will  not spread nor run down the staff, but a small portion will be retained  at the acting surface of pivot and jewel, and this supply will be  gradually fed to these parts from the reservoir between the jewel and  end-stone, by the action of capillarity.    Having examined into the requirements of the pivot and its jewel and  having gained an insight into what their forms should be, we are the  better able to perform that portion of the work in an intelligent"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20318"],[0,"Little Journeys to the Homes of the Great - Volume 14 (#2)"],[1," that she was a weary  weight to him for the twenty-five years they lived together. Still men  grow strong by carrying burdens; and we must remember that Wagner was  what he was on account of what he endured and suffered.    Wagner expressed himself in his art, and all great art is simply the  honest, spontaneous, individual expression of soul-emotion. Had Wagner's  emotions been different he would have produced a totally different sort  of art. That is to say, if Wagner in his youth had loved and wedded a  woman who was capable of giving his soul peace, we would have had no  Wagner; we would have had some one else, and therefore a totally  different expression, or no expression at all. Probably the man would  have been quite content to be a village Kapellmeister. His life being  reasonably complete, his spirit would not have roamed the Universe  crying for rest. The ideals of his wife were so low and commonplace that  she influenced his career by antithesis. His soul was ahungered for the  bread of life, and stones were given him in way of the dull, the ugly,  the affected, the smug, the ridiculous. Wagner's life was a revolt from  the ossified commonplace, a struggle for right adjustment--a heart  tragedy. And all this reaching out of the spirit, all the prayers,  hopes, fears and travail of his soul, are told and told again in his  poetry and in his music.    All art is autobiography.    Minna Planer was amiable and kind, but the frantic effort she made at  times, in public, to be profound or chic must have touched the great man  on the raw. He sought, however, to protect her, and at public gatherings  used to keep very near to her in order that she should not fall into the  clutches of some sharp-witted enemy and be lead on into unseemliness of  speech. The scoffs of critics and the ready-made gibes and jeers of the  mob were to her gospel truth; her husband's genius was a vagary to be  stoutly endured. So for many years she was inclined to pose as one to be  pitied--and so she was. That she suffered at times can not be denied,  yet God is good, and so has put short limit on the sensibilities of the  vain.    But Wagner would never tolerate an unkind word spoken of Minna in his  presence, and once rebuked a friend who sought to console him by saying,  \"Never mind, Minna lives her life the best she can, and expresses the  thoughts that come to her--what more do you and I do?\"    And in his later years, when calm philosophy was his, he realized that  Minna Planer had supplied him a stinging discontent, a continued unrest  that formed the sounding-board on which his sorrow and his hope and his  faith in the Ideal were echoed forth.    Love is the recurring motif in all of Wagner's plays. A man and a woman,  joined by God, but separated by unkind condition, play their parts, and  our hearts are made by the Master to vibrate in sympathy with the  central idea. Only a broken-hearted man could have conjured forth from  his soul such couples as these: Senta and the Dutchman, Elizabeth and  Tannhauser, Elsa and Lohengrin, Tristan and Isolde, Siegmund and  Sieglinde, Walter and Eva, Siegfried and Brunhilde.    Wagner's unhappy marriage forms the keynote of his art. Every opera he  wrote depicts a soul in bonds. From \"The Flying Dutchman\" to \"Parsifal\"  we are shown the struggle of a strong man with cruel Fate; a reaching  out for liberty and light; the halting between duty and inclination; and  the endless search for a woman who shall give deliverance through her  abiding love and faith.           *       *       *       *       *    All art seems controlled by fad and fashion. No fashion endures, else  'twere not fashion, and in its character the fad is essentially  transient. Still we need not rail at fashion; it is a form of  periodicity, and periodicity exists through all Nature. There are day  and night, winter and summer, equinox and solstice, work and rest, years  of plenty and years of famine. Comets return, and all fashions come  back. Keep your old raiment long enough and it will be in style.    All things move in an orbit, even theories and religions. Certain forms  of fanaticism come with the centuries--every new heresy is old. All  extremes cure themselves, for when matters get pushed to a point where  the balance of things is in danger of being disturbed, a Reformer  appears and utters his stentorian protest. This man is always ridiculed,  hooted, reviled, mobbed, and very happy indeed is his fate if he is  hanged, crucified or made to drink of the deadly hemlock; for then his  place in the affection of men is made secure, sealed with blood, and we  proclaim him liberator or savior. The Piazza Signora is sacred soil  because there it was that Savonarola died; John Brown's body lies  a-moldering in the grave, but his soul goes marching on; J. Wilkes Booth  linked his own name with that of Judas Iscariot and made his victim  known to the Ages as the Emancipator of Men.    These strong men, sent at the pivotal points in history, are born out  of a sore need--they are sent from God. Yet strong men always exist, but  it is the needs of the hour that develop and bring them to our  attention. Not always have the Reformers been fortunate in their takings  off--many have lingered out lengthening, living deaths in walled-up  cells. The Bastile, Chillon, London Tower, that prison joined to a  palace by the Bridge of Sighs, and all other such plague-spots of blood  are haunted by the ghosts of infamy. Before the memory of all those who  wrote immortal books behind grated bars we stand uncovered.    Exile has been the lot of many who tried to live for sanity, justice and  truth when mad riot raged. Dante, Victor Hugo, Prince Kropotkin and  Wagner are types to which we turn. Then there is an attenuated form of  persecution known as ostracism, which consists in being exiled at home,  but of this it is not worth while to speak.    Wagner was a strong, honest man who simply desired to express his better  self. The elements of caution and expediency were singularly lacking in  his character. These qualities of independence and self-reliance brought  him into speedy collision with those who stood in the front rank of the  artistic world of his day, and he became a marked man. His offense was  that he expressed his honest self.    In Eighteen Hundred Forty-three, when he appeared upon the scene in  Dresden as Hofkapellmeister of the Royal Theater, matters musical were  just about where the stage now is in America. In this Year of Grace,  Nineteen Hundred One, the great Shakespeare has been elbowed from the  stage by the author of \"A Texas Steer\"; and where once the haughty  Richard trod the boards, the skirt-dance assumes the center of the stage  and looms lurid like the spirit of the Brocken. Recently a vaudeville  \"turn\" of Hamlet has been presented, where the gravediggers do their  gruesome tasks to ragtime; and on every hand we behold the Lyceum giving  way to the McClure Continuous, Lim.    Wagner abhorred the mere tune for the sake of tune. \"You can not produce  art and leave man out,\" he said. All art must suggest something. Mere  verbal description is not literature: it is only words, words, words; a  picture must be charged with soul, otherwise a photograph would outrank  \"The Angelus.\" Music must be more than jingling tunes and mincing  sounds. And thus we find Wagner at thirty years of age boldly putting  forth \"The Flying Dutchman,\" with music not written for the text, nor  text written for the music, but words and music created at the same  time--the melody mirroring forth the soul of the words.    In this play Wagner for the first time sacrificed every precedent of  musical construction and all thought of symmetrical form, in order to  make the music tell the tale. \"The Flying Dutchman\" is to opera what  Walt Whitman's \"Leaves of Grass\" is to poetry, or Millet's \"Sower\" is  to painting. There is strength, heroic strength, in each of these  masterpieces I have named, but the \"Dutchman\" needs a listener, \"Leaves  of Grass\" requires a reader who has experienced, and the \"Sower\" demands  one who has eyes to see, before its lesson of love and patience and the  pathetic truth of endless toil are bodied forth.    Whitman's book was well looked after by the local Antonius Ash-Box  inspector of the day, its publication forbidden, and the author  incidentally deprived of his clerkship at Washington; Millet did service  as the butt for jokes of artistic Paris, and was dubbed \"The Wild Man\";  Wagner's play was hooted off the stage.           *       *       *       *       *    Every man is but a type representing his class. Of course the class may  be small and one man may even be its sole living representative: but  Wagner had his double in William Morris. These men were brothers in  temperament, physique, habit of thought and occupation.    Wagner wrote largely on the subjects of Art and Sociology, and made his  appeal for the toiler in that the man should be allowed to share the  joys of Art by producing it. His argument is identical with that of  William Morris; and yet the essays of Wagner were not translated into  English until after Morris had written his \"Dream of John Ball,\" and  Morris did not read German.    Both men hark back to a time when Man and Nature were on friendly terms;  when the thought, best exemplified by the early Greeks, of the  sacredness of the human body was recognized; when the old medieval  feeling of helpful brotherhood yet lingered; and the restless misery of  competition and all the train of woe, squalor and ugliness that  \"civilization\" has brought were unknown.    Wagner's music is made up of the sounds of Nature conventionalized. You  hear the sighing of the breeze, the song of the birds, the cries of  animals, the rush of the storm. Wagner's essay, entitled, \"Art and  Revolution,\" is the twin to the lecture, \"Art and Socialism,\" by Morris;  and in the \"Art-Work of the Future,\""]]]
