The boy's  father then repairs to the girl's house, where he is respectfully  received and his feet are washed. He is then asked to take a drink of  plain water, which is a humble method of offering him a meal. After  this, presents for the girl are sent by a party accompanied by tomtom  players, and a date is fixed for the marriage, which, contrary to the  usual Hindu rule, may take place in the rains. The reason is perhaps  because iron-smelting is not carried on during the rains and the  Agarias therefore have no work to do. A few days before the wedding  the bride-price is paid, which consists of 5 seers each of _urad_  and til and a sum of Rs. 4 to Rs. 12. The marriage is held on any  Monday, Tuesday or Friday, no further trouble being taken to select  an auspicious day. In order that they may not forget the date fixed,  the fathers of the parties each take a piece of thread in which  they tie a knot for every day intervening between the date when the  marriage day is settled and the day itself, and they then untie one  knot for every day. Previous to the marriage all the village gods  are propitiated by being anointed with oil by the Baiga or village  priest. The first clod of earth for the ovens is also dug by the  Baiga, and received in her cloth by the bride's mother as a mark  of respect. The usual procedure is adopted in the marriage. After  the bridegroom's arrival his teeth are cleaned with tooth-sticks,  and the bride's sister tries to push _saj_ leaves into his mouth,  a proceeding which he prevents by holding his fan in front of his  face. For doing this the girl is given a small present. A _paili_  [3] measure of rice is filled alternately by the bride and bridegroom  twelve times, the other upsetting it each time after it is filled. At  the marriage feast, in addition to rice and pulse, mutton curry and  cakes of _urad_ pulse fried in oil are provided. _Urad_ is held in  great respect, and is always given as a food at ceremonial feasts  and to honoured guests. The greater part of the marriage ceremony  is performed a second time at the bridegroom's house. Finally, the  decorations of the marriage-shed and the palm-leaf crowns of the bride  and bridegroom are thrown into a tank. The bride and bridegroom go  into the water, and each in turn hides a jar under water, which the  other must find. They then bathe, change their clothes, and go back  to the bridegroom's house, the bride carrying the jar filled with  water on her head. The boy is furnished with a bow and arrows and  has to shoot at a stuffed deer over the girl's shoulder. After each  shot she gives him a little sugar, and if he does not hit the deer  in three shots he must pay 4 annas to the _sawasa_ or page. After  the marriage the bridegroom does not visit his wife for a month in  order to ascertain whether she is already pregnant. They then live  together. The marriage expenses usually amount to Rs. 15 for the  bridegroom's father and Rs. 40 for the bride's father. Sometimes the  bridegroom serves his father-in-law for his wife, and he is then not  required to pay anything for the marriage, the period of service being  three years. If the couple anticipate the ceremony, however, they  must leave the house, and then are recalled by the bride's parents,  and readmitted into caste on giving a feast, which is in lieu of the  marriage ceremony. If they do not comply with the first summons of  the parents, the latter finally sever connection with them. Widow  marriage is freely permitted, and the widow is expected to marry her  late husband's younger brother, especially if he is a bachelor. If  she marries another man with his consent, the new husband gives him  a turban and shoulder-cloth. The children by the first husband are  made over to his relatives if there are any. Divorce is permitted for  adultery or extravagance or ill-treatment by either party. A divorced  wife can marry again, but if she absconds with another man without  being divorced the latter has to pay Rs. 12 to the husband.        3. Birth and death ceremonies.      When a woman becomes pregnant for the first time, her mother goes to  her taking a new cloth and cakes and a preparation of milk, which  is looked on as a luxurious food, and which, it is supposed, will  strengthen the child in the womb. After birth the mother is impure  for five days. The dead are usually burnt, but children under six  whose ears have not been pierced, and persons dying a violent death  or from cholera or smallpox are buried. When the principal man of  the family dies, the caste-fellows at the mourning feast tie a cloth  round the head of his successor to show that they acknowledge his  new position. They offer water to the dead in the month of Kunwar  (September-October).        4. Religion and social customs.      They have a vague belief in a supreme God but do not pay much attention  to him. Their family god is Dulha Deo, to whom they offer goats,  fowls, cocoanuts and cakes. In the forest tracts they also worship  Bura Deo, the chief god of the Gonds. The deity who presides over  their profession is Loha-Sur, the Iron demon, who is supposed to live  in the smelting-kilns, and to whom they offer a black hen. Formerly,  it is said, they were accustomed to offer a black cow. They worship  their smelting implements on the day of Dasahra and during Phagun,  and offer fowls to them. They have little faith in medicine, and in  cases of sickness requisition the aid of the village sorcerer, who  ascertains what deity is displeased with them by moving grain to and  fro in a winnowing-fan and naming the village gods in turn. He goes  on repeating the names until his hand slackens or stops at some name,  and the offended god is thus indicated. He is then summoned and enters  into the body of one of the persons present, and explains his reason  for being offended with the sick person, as that he has passed by  the god's shrine without taking off his shoes, or omitted to make the  triennial offering of a fowl or the like. Atonement is then promised  and the offering made, while the sick person on recovery notes the  deity in question as one of a vindictive temper, whose worship must  on no account be neglected. The Agarias say that they do not admit  outsiders into the caste, but Gonds, Kawars and Ahirs are occasionally  allowed to enter it. They refuse to eat monkeys, jackals, crocodiles,  lizards, beef and the leavings of others. They eat pork and fowls  and drink liquor copiously. They take food from the higher castes  and from Gonds and Baigas. Only Bahelias and other impure castes will  take food from them. Temporary excommunication from caste is imposed  for conviction of a criminal offence, getting maggots in a wound, and  killing a cow, a dog or a cat. Permanent excommunication is imposed  for adultery or eating with a very low caste. Readmission to caste  after temporary exclusion entails a feast, but if the offender is  very poor he simply gives a little liquor or even water. The Agarias  are usually sunk in poverty, and their personal belongings are of  the scantiest description, consisting of a waist-cloth, and perhaps  another wisp of cloth for the head, a brass _lota_ or cup and a few  earthen vessels. Their women dress like Gond women, and have a few  pewter ornaments. They are profusely tattooed with representations of  flowers, scorpions and other objects. This is done merely for ornament.        5. Occupation.      The caste still follow their traditional occupation of iron-smelting  and also make a few agricultural implements. They get their ore from  the Maikal range, selecting stones of a dark reddish colour. They  mix 16 lbs. of ore with 15 lbs. of charcoal in the furnace, the blast  being produced by a pair of bellows worked by the feet and conveyed  to the furnace through bamboo tubes; it is kept up steadily for four  hours. The clay coating of the kiln is then broken down and the ball of  molten slag and charcoal is taken out and hammered, and about 3 lbs. of  good iron are obtained. With this they make ploughshares, mattocks,  axes and sickles. They also move about from village to village with an  anvil, a hammer and tongs, and building a small furnace under a tree,  make and repair iron implements for the villagers.              Agharia        1. Origin.      _Agharia_ [4] (a corruption of Agaria, meaning one who came from  Agra).--A cultivating caste belonging to the Sambalpur District [5]  and adjoining States. They number 27,000 persons in the Raigarh and  Sarangarh States and Bilaspur District of the Central Provinces,  and are found also in some of the Chota Nagpur States transferred  from Bengal. According to the traditions of the Agharias their  forefathers were Rajputs who lived near Agra. They were accustomed  to salute the king of Delhi with one hand only and without bending  the head. The king after suffering this for a long time determined  to punish them for their contumacy, and summoned all the Agharias to  appear before him. At the door through which they were to pass to his  presence he fixed a sword at the height of a man's neck. The haughty  Agharias came to the door, holding their heads high and not seeing  the sword, and as a natural consequence they were all decapitated as  they passed through. But there was one Agharia who had heard about the  fixing of the sword and who thought it better to stay at home, saying  that he had some ceremony to perform. When the king heard that there  was one Agharia who had not passed through the door, he sent again,  commanding him to come. The Agharia did not wish to go but felt it  impossible to decline. He therefore sent for a Chamar of his village  and besought him to go instead, saying that he would become a Rajput  in his death and that he would ever be held in remembrance by the  Agharia's descendants.
