Acting probably as  Montagu's secretary for some time, he was first appointed to a clerkship  in the Army pay office, and then soon afterwards became clerk of the  Acts of the Navy. Later on, like Evelyn, he held various more important  posts under the Crown, as well as being greatly distinguished by  promotion to non-official positions of the highest honour. His official  career was a very brilliant one, and deservedly so from the integrity of  his work, from his application, despite frequent immoderation in  partaking of wine, and from his business-like methods of work. As  Commissioner for the Affairs of Tangier and Treasurer, he visited  Tangier officially. He twice became Secretary to the Admiralty, and was  twice elected to represent Harwich in Parliament, after having  previously sat for Castle Rising. He was also twice chosen as Master of  the Trinity House, and was twice committed to prison, once on a charge  of high treason, and the other time (1690) on the charge of being  affected to King James II., upon whose flight from England Pepys had  laid down his office and withdrawn himself into retirement. Elected a  Fellow of the Royal Society in 1665, he attained the distinction of  being its President in 1684. He was Master of the Clothworkers' Company,  Treasurer and Vice-President of Christ's Hospital, and one of the Barons  of the Cinque Ports. In 1699, four years before he succumbed to a long  and painful disease borne with fortitude under the depression of reduced  circumstances, he received the freedom of the City of London,  principally for his services in connection with Christ's Hospital.    From the hasty sketch drafted in the above outlines, it will be seen  that throughout all Pepys' manhood the circumstances of his daily life  and environment were much more similar to those of Evelyn than to those  of Walton, who may well be ranked as their senior by almost one  generation. Like Evelyn, Izaak Walton was rather the child of the  country than a boy of the town. Born in Stafford in 1593, he only came  to settle in London after he had attained early manhood. Thus, though a  citizen exposing his linen drapery and mens' millinery for sale first in  the Gresham Exchange on the Cornhill, then in Fleet Street, and latterly  in Chancery Lane, the Bond Street of that time, he ever cherished a  longing for more rural surroundings and a desire to exchange life in the  city for residence in a smaller provincial town. On the civil war  breaking out in Charles the Ist's time, he retired from business and  went to live near his birth place, Stafford, where he had previously  bought some land. Here the last forty years of his long life were spent  in ease and recreation. When not angling or visiting friends, mostly  brethren of the angle, he engaged in the light literary work of  compiling biographies and in collecting material for the enrichment of  his _Compleat Angler_. Published in 1653, this ran through five editions  in 23 years, besides a reprint in 1664 of the third edition (1661).    In spite of the many similarities between Evelyn and Pepys as to  university education, official position, political partisanship, and  social and scientific status in London, there are yet such essential  differences between what has been bequeathed to us by these two friends  that comparison between them is almost impossible. They are both  authors: but it was by chance rather than by design that Pepys  ultimately acquired repute as an author, whereas Evelyn at once achieved  the literary fame he desired and wrote for. Neither of the two works  published by Pepys, _The Portugal History_ (1677) and the _Memories of  the Royal Navy_ (1690), procured for him the gratification of revising  them for a second edition, and it is indeed open to question if the  _Diary_ upon which his undying fame rests was ever intended by him to be  published after his death. This is a point that is never likely to be  settled satisfactorily. The fact of its having been written in cipher  looks as if it had been compiled solely for private amusement, and not  with any intention of posthumous publication; and this view is greatly  strengthened by the unblushing and complete manner in which he lays  aside the mask of outward propriety and records his too frequent  quaffing of the wine-cup, his household bickerings, his improprieties  with fair women, and his graver conjugal infidelities. The improprieties  of other persons, and especially those of higher social rank than  himself, might very intelligibly have been written in cipher intended to  have been transcribed and printed after his death; but it would be at  variance with human nature to believe that he could so unreservedly have  reduced to writing all the faults and follies of his life had even  posthumous publication of his _Diary_ been contemplated by him at the  time of writing it. For it is hardly capable of argument that, next to  the instincts of self-preservation and of the maintenance of family  ties, the desire to preserve outward appearances is undoubtedly one of  the strongest of human feelings; and this great natural law, often the  last remnant or the substitute of conscience, character, and  self-respect, is even more fully operative in a highly civilised than in  a savage or a semi-savage state of society. Of a truth, every human  being is more or less of a Pharisee with regard to certain  conventionalities of life. Complete disregard for the maintenance of  some sort of standard of outward appearances is the absolute vanishing  point of self-respect. Till that has been reached by any individual the  hope of his reformation is not lost, though at the same time successful  dissimulation makes the prospect of a turning point in a vicious career  but remote. Still, \"it is a long lane that has no turning.\" It is  therefore most probable that the leaving behind of the key to the cipher  was rather due to inadvertence than to intention and design. And if this  view be correct, then Pepys' charming _Diary_ was the purely natural  outpouring of his mind without ever a thought being bestowed on  authorship and ultimate publication.    With Evelyn's _Diary_, however, it was different. Although it was not  published until 1818, and though it may never have been intended by its  writer to have been given to the world in book form, yet it was very  clearly intended to be an autobiographical legacy to his family. Hence  it is no mere outpouring of the spirit upon pages meant only for the  subsequent perusal of him who thus rendered in indelible characters his  passing thoughts of the moment. And this being the case, comparison  between the two Diaries would be just as unfair as it is unnecessary.  The one is the fruit of unrestrained freedom and a mirthful mind, while  the other is the product of cultured leisure and a refined literary  method. When Evelyn was Commissioner for the maintenance of the Dutch  prisoners (1664-70) he had frequent communications with Pepys, then of  the Navy, and there are special references to him in Evelyn's memoirs.  That an intimate friendship existed there is no doubt, and that they  each held the other in great respect as a man of intellect, as well as  of good business capacity, is equally clear. Thus, in June, 1669, he  encouraged Pepys to be operated on 'when exceedingly afflicted with the  stone;' and on 19 February, 1671, 'This day din'd with me Mr. Surveyor,  Dr. Christopher Wren, and Mr. Pepys, Cleark of the Acts, two  extraordinary ingenious and knowing persons, and other friends. I  carried them to see the piece of carving which I had recommended to the  King.' This was a masterpiece of Grinling Gibbon's work, which Charles  admired but did not purchase; so Gibbon not long after sold it for L80,  though 'well worth L100, without the frame, to Sir George Viner.' Evelyn  at this time got Wren, however, to promise faithfully to employ Gibbon  to do the choir carving in the new St. Paul's Cathedral.    Each of their Diaries teems with reference to the other. Pepys asked  Evelyn to sit to Kneller for his portrait which he desired for 'reasons  I had (founded upon gratitude, affection, and esteeme) to covet that in  effigie which I most truly value in the original.' This refers to the  well-known portrait, now at Wotton, that has been copied and engraved.    It appears to have been begun in October, 1685, but it was not till  July, 1689, that the commission was actually completed. The portrait  exhibits the face of an elderly man distinctly of a high-strung and  nervous temperament, though not quite to the extent of being 'sicklied  oer with the pale caste of thought.' His right hand, too, which grasps  his _Sylva_ is one very characteristic of the nervous disposition. A  bright, shrewd intellect, lofty thoughts, high motives, good resolves,  and--last, tho' by no means least--a serene mind, the _mens conscia  recti_ which Pepys bluntly called 'a little conceitedness,' are all  stamped upon his well-marked and not unshapely features. It is eminently  the face of a philosopher, an enthusiast, a studious scholar, and a  gentleman.    No one can ever know Evelyn so well as Pepys did; and here is his  opinion of John Evelyn, expressed in the secret pages of his cipher  Diary on November, 1665:--'In fine, a most excellent person he is, and  must be allowed a little for a little conceitedness; but he may well be  so, being a man so much above others.' And this just exactly bears out  the rough general impression conveyed by the perusal of Evelyn's Diary  and his other literary works. The long friendship of these two was only  terminated by the death of Pepys on 26th May, 1703, not long before  Evelyn had himself to depart from this life. 'This day"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2078"],[0,"Thais (#2)"],[1,"these two means to prevent him from  committing a great sin. But Paphnutius had not been grateful to Him for  that, because at that time he was blind to his own interests, and did  not know that he was lusting after false delights. Now, kneeling in  his cell, before the image of that holy cross on which hung, as in a  balance, the ransom of the world, Paphnutius began to think of Thais,  because Thais was a sin to him, and he meditated long, according to  ascetic rules, on the fearful hideousness of the carnal delights with  which this woman had inspired him in the days of his sin and ignorance.  After some hours of meditation the image of Thais appeared to him  clearly and distinctly. He saw her again, as he had seen her when she  tempted him, in all the beauty of the flesh. At first she showed herself  like a Leda, softly lying upon a bed of hyacinths, her head bowed, her  eyes humid and filled with a strange light, her nostrils quivering, her  mouth half open, her breasts like two flowers, and her arms smooth and  fresh as two brooks. At this sight Paphnutius struck his breast and  said--    \"I call Thee to witness, my God, that I have considered how heinous has  been my sin.\"    Gradually the face of the image changed its expression. Little by little  the lips of Thais, by lowering at the corners of the mouth, expressed a  mysterious suffering. Her large eyes were filled with tears and lights;  her breast heaved with sighs, like the sighing of a wind that precedes  a tempest. At this sight Paphnutius was troubled to the bottom of his  soul. Prostrating himself on the floor, he uttered this prayer--    \"Thou who hast put pity in our hearts, like the morning dew upon the  fields, O just and merciful God, be Thou blessed! Praise! praise be unto  Thee! Put away from Thy servant that false tenderness which tempts to  concupiscence, and grant that I may only love Thy creatures in Thee, for  they pass away, but Thou endurest for ever. If I care for this woman,  it is only because she is Thy handiwork. The angels themselves feel  pity for her. Is she not, O Lord, the breath of Thy mouth? Let her not  continue to sin with many citizens and strangers. There is great pity  for her in my heart. Her wickednesses are abominable, and but to think  of them makes my flesh creep. But the more wicked she is, the more do I  lament for her. I weep when I think that the devils will torment her to  all eternity.\"    As he was meditating in this way, he saw a little jackal lying at his  feet. He felt much surprised, for the door of his cell had been closed  since the morning. The animal seemed to read the Abbot's thoughts, and  wagged its tail like a dog. Paphnutius made the sign of the cross and  the beast vanished. He knew then that, for the first time, the devil had  entered his cell, and he uttered a short prayer; then he thought again  about Thais.    \"With God's help,\" he said to himself, \"I must save her.\" And he slept.    The next morning, when he had said his prayers, he went to see the  sainted Palemon, a holy hermit who lived some distance away. He found  him smiling quietly as he dug the ground, as was his custom. Palemon  was an old man, and cultivated a little garden; the wild beasts came and  licked his hands, and the devils never tormented him.    \"May God be praised, brother Paphnutius,\" he said, as he leaned upon his  spade.    \"God be praised!\" replied Paphnutius. \"And peace be unto my brother.\"    \"The like peace be unto thee, brother Paphnutius,\" said Palemon; and he  wiped the sweat from his forehead with his sleeve.    \"Brother Palemon, all our discourse ought to be solely the praise of Him  who has promised to be wheresoever two or three are gathered together in  His Name. That is why I come to you concerning a design I have formed to  glorify the Lord.\"    \"May the Lord bless thy design, Paphnutius, as He has blessed my  lettuces. Every morning He spreads His grace with the dew on my garden,  and His goodness causes me to glorify Him in the cucumbers and melons  which He gives me. Let us pray that He may keep us in His peace. For  nothing is more to be feared than those unruly passions which trouble  our hearts. When these passions disturb us we are like drunken men,  and we stagger from right to left unceasingly, and are like to fall  miserably. Sometimes these passions plunge us into a turbulent joy, and  he who gives way to such, sullies the air with brutish laughter. Such  false joy drags the sinner into all sorts of excess. But sometimes also  the troubles of the soul and of the senses throw us into an impious  sadness which is a thousand times worse than the joy. Brother  Paphnutius, I am but a miserable sinner, but I have found, in my long  life, that the cenobite has no foe worse than sadness. I mean by that  the obstinate melancholy which envelopes the soul as in a mist, and  hides from us the light of God. Nothing is more contrary to salvation,  and the devil's greatest triumph is to sow black and bitter thoughts in  the heart of a good man. If he sent us only pleasurable temptations,  he would not be half so much to be feared. Alas! he excels in making  us sad. Did he not show to our father Anthony a black child of such  surpassing beauty that the very sight of it drew tears? With God's help,  our father Anthony avoided the snares of the demon. I knew him when he  lived amongst us; he was cheerful with his disciples, and never gave  way to melancholy. But did you not come, my brother, to talk to me of  a design you had formed in your mind? Let me know what it is--if, at  least, this design has for its object the glory of God.\"    \"Brother Palemon, what I propose is really to the glory of God.  Strengthen me with your counsel, for you know many things, and sin has  never darkened the clearness of your mind.\"    \"Brother Paphnutius, I am not worthy to unloose the latchet of thy  sandals, and my sins are as countless as the sands of the desert. But I  am old, and I will never refuse the help of my experience.\"    \"I will confide in you, then, brother Palemon, that I am stricken with  grief at the thought that there is, in Alexandria, a courtesan named  Thais, who lives in sin, and is a subject of reproach unto the people.\"    \"Brother Paphnutius, that is, in truth, an abomination which we do well  to deplore. There are many women amongst the Gentiles who lead lives of  that kind. Have you thought of any remedy for this great evil?\"    \"Brother Palemon, I will go to Alexandria and find this woman, and, with  God's help, I will convert her; that is my intention; do you approve of  it, brother?\"    \"Brother Paphnutius, I am but a miserable sinner, but our father Anthony  used to say, 'In whatsoever place thou art, hasten not to leave it to go  elsewhere.'\"    \"Brother Palemon, do you disapprove of my project?\"    \"Dear Paphnutius, God forbid that I should suspect my brother of bad  intentions. But our father Anthony also said, 'Fishes die on dry land,  and so is it with those monks who leave their cells and mingle with the  men of this world, amongst whom no good thing is to be found.'\"    Having thus spoken, the old man pressed his foot on the spade, and began  to dig energetically round a fig tree laden with fruit. As he was thus  engaged, there was a rustling in the bushes, and an antelope leaped  over the hedge which surrounded the garden; it stopped, surprised and  frightened, its delicate legs trembling, then ran up to the old man, and  laid its pretty head on the breast of its friend.    \"God be praised in the gazelle of the desert,\" said Palemon.    He went to his hut, the light-footed little animal trotting after him,  and brought out some black bread, which the antelope ate out of his  hand.    Paphnutius remained thoughtful for some time, his eyes fixed upon the  stones at his feet. Then he slowly walked back to his cell, pondering on  what he had heard. A great struggle was going on in his mind.    \"The hermit gives good advice,\" he said to himself; \"the spirit of  prudence is in him. And he doubts the wisdom of my intention. Yet it  would be cruel to leave Thais any longer in the power of the demon who  possesses her. May God advise and conduct me.\"    As he was walking along, he saw a plover, caught in the net that a  hunter had laid on the sand, and he knew that it was a hen bird, for  he saw the male fly to the net, and tear the meshes one by one with its  beak, until it had made an opening by which its mate could escape. The  holy man watched this incident, and as, by virtue of his holiness, he  easily comprehended the mystic sense of all occurrences, he knew that  the captive bird was no other than Thais, caught in the snares of sin,  and that--like the plover that had cut the hempen threads with its  beak--he could, by pronouncing the word of power, break the invisible  bonds by which Thais was held in sin. Therefore he praised God, and was  confirmed in his first resolution. But then seeing the plover caught  by the feet, and hampered by the net it had broken, he fell into  uncertainty again.    He did not sleep all night, and before dawn he had a vision. Thais  appeared to him again. There was no expression of guilty pleasure on her  face, nor was she dressed according to custom in transparent drapery.  She was enveloped in a shroud, which hid even a part of her face, so  that the Abbot could see nothing but the two eyes, from which flowed  white and heavy tears.    At this sight he began to weep, and believing that this vision came from  God, he no longer hesitated. He rose, seized a knotted stick, the symbol  of the Christian faith, and left his cell, carefully closing the door,  lest the animals of the desert and the birds of the air should enter,  and befoul the copy of the Holy Scriptures which stood at the head of  his bed. He called Flavian, the deacon, and gave him authority over the  other twenty-three disciples during his absence; and then, clad only in  a long"]]]
