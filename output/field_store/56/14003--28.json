Owing to this immeasurable calamity that has befallen the  white race, the question of eugenics has ceased to be merely academic.  It looms large whenever we consider the means of avoiding a stagnation  or even decline of our civilization in consequence of the losses the War  has inflicted upon the more valuable stocks. Eugenics is by no means  tender with established customs and institutions, and once it seemed  likely that its teachings would be left for our grandchildren to act on.  But the plowshare of war has turned up the tough sod of custom, and now  every sound new idea has a chance. Rooted prejudices have been leveled  like the forests of Picardy under gun fire. The fear of racial decline  provides the eugenist with a far stronger leverage than did the hope of  accelerating racial progress. It may be, then, that owing to the War  eugenic policies will gain as much ground by the middle of this century  as without it they would have gained by the end of the century.    This book could not have been written ten years ago because many of the  data it relies on were not then in existence. In view of inquiries now  going on, we may reasonably hope that ten years hence it will be  possible to make a much better book on the subject. But I am sure that  this book is as good a presentation as can be made of eugenics at its  present stage of development. The results of all the trustworthy  observations and experiments have been taken into account, and the  testing of human customs and institutions in the light of biological  principles tallies well with the sociology of our times.    I cannot understand how any conscientious person, dealing in a large way  with human life, should have the hardihood to ignore eugenics. This book  should command the attention not only of students of sociology, but, as  well, of philanthropists, social workers, settlement wardens, doctors,  clergymen, educators, editors, publicists, Y. M. C. A. secretaries and  industrial engineers. It ought to lie at the elbow of law-makers,  statesmen, poor relief officials, immigration inspectors, judges of  juvenile courts, probation officers, members of state boards of control  and heads of charitable and correctional institutions. Finally, the  thoughtful ought to find in it guidance in their problem of mating. It  will inspire the superior to rise above certain worldly ideals of life  and to aim at a family success rather than an individual success.                                                     EDWARD ALSWORTH ROSS.      The University of Wisconsin    Madison, Wisconsin    July 1918.          APPLIED EUGENICS          CHAPTER I    NATURE OR NURTURE?      At the First Race Betterment Conference held at Battle Creek, Mich.,  many methods were suggested by which it was believed that the people of  America might be made, on the average, healthier, happier, and more  efficient. One afternoon the discussion turned to the children of the  slums. Their condition was pictured in dark colors. A number of  eugenists remarked that they were in many cases handicapped by a poor  heredity. Then Jacob Riis--a man for whom every American must feel a  profound admiration--strode upon the platform, filled with indignation.    \"We have heard friends here talk about heredity,\" he exclaimed. \"The  word has rung in my ears until I am sick of it. Heredity! Heredity!  There is just one heredity in all the world that is ours--we are  children of God, and there is nothing in the whole big world that we  cannot do in His service with it.\"    It is probably not beyond the truth to say that in this statement Jacob  Riis voiced the opinion of a majority of the social workers of this  country, and likewise a majority of the people who are faithfully and  with much self-sacrifice supporting charities, uplift movements, reform  legislation, and philanthropic attempts at social betterment in many  directions. They suppose that they are at the same time making the race  better by making the conditions better in which people live.    It is widely supposed that, although nature may have distributed some  handicaps at birth, they can be removed if the body is properly warmed  and fed and the mind properly exercised. It is further widely supposed  that this improvement in the condition of the individual will result in  his production of better infants, and that thus the race, gaining a  little momentum in each generation, will gradually move on toward  ultimate perfection.    There is no lack of efforts to improve the race, by this method of  direct change of the environment. It involves two assumptions, which are  sometimes made explicitly, sometimes merely taken for granted. These  are:    1. That changes in a man's surroundings, or, to use the more technical  biological term, in his nurture, will change the nature that he has  inherited.    2. That such changes will further be transmitted to his children.    Any one who proposes methods of race betterment, as we do in the present  book, must meet these two popular beliefs. We shall therefore examine  the first of them in this chapter, and the second in Chapter II.    Galton adopted and popularized Shakespere's antithesis of _nature_ and  _nurture_ to describe a man's inheritance and his surroundings, the two  terms including everything that can pertain to a human being. The words  are not wholly suitable, particularly since nature has two distinct  meanings,--human nature and external nature. The first is the only one  considered by Galton. Further, nurture is capable of subdivision into  those environmental influences which do not undergo much change,--e.g.,  soil and climate,--and those forces of civilization and education which  might better be described as culture. The evolutionist has really to  deal with the three factors of germ-plasm, physical surroundings and  culture. But Galton's phrase is so widely current that we shall continue  to use it, with the implications that have just been outlined.    The antithesis of nature and nurture is not a new one; it was met long  ago by biologists and settled by them to their own satisfaction. The  whole body of experimental and observational evidence in biology tends  to show that the characters which the individual inherits from his  ancestors remain remarkably constant in all ordinary conditions to which  they may be subjected. Their constancy is roughly proportionate to the  place of the animal in the scale of evolution; lower forms are more  easily changed by outside influence, but as one ascends to the higher  forms, which are more differentiated, it is found more and more  difficult to effect any change in them. Their characters are more  definitely fixed at birth.[1]    It is with the highest of all forms, Man, that we have now to deal. The  student in biology is not likely to doubt that the differences in men  are due much more to inherited nature than to any influences brought to  bear after birth, even though these latter influences include such  powerful ones as nutrition and education within ordinary limits.    But the biological evidence does not lend itself readily to summary  treatment, and we shall therefore examine the question by statistical  methods.[2] These have the further advantage of being more easily  understood; for facts which can be measured and expressed in numbers are  facts whose import the reader can usually decide for himself: he is  perfectly able to determine, without any special training, whether twice  two does or does not make four. One further preliminary remark: the  problem of nature vs. nurture can not be solved in general terms; a  moment's thought will show that it can be understood only by examining  one trait at a time. The problem is to decide whether the differences  between the people met in everyday life are due more to inheritance or  to outside influences, and these differences must naturally be examined  separately; they can not be lumped together.    To ask whether nature in general contributes more to a man than nurture  is futile; but it is not at all futile to ask whether the differences in  a given human trait are more affected by differences in nature than by  differences in nurture. It is easy to see that a verdict may be  sometimes given to one side, sometimes to the other. Albinism in  animals, for instance, is a trait which is known to be inherited, and  which is very slightly affected by differences of climate, food supply,  etc. On the other hand, there are factors which, although having  inherited bases, owe their expression almost wholly to outside  influences. Professor Morgan, for example, has found a strain of fruit  flies whose offspring in cold weather are usually born with  supernumerary legs. In hot weather they are practically normal. If this  strain were bred only in the tropics, the abnormality would probably not  be noticed; on the other hand, if it were bred only in cold regions, it  would be set down as one characterized by duplication of limbs. The  heredity factor would be the same in each"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19562"],[0,"Napoleon and the Queen of Prussia (#2)"],[1," with gore, and  the number of corpses scattered over it was much smaller. Here and there  was the wreck of a cannon besmeared with blood and mire, and empty  knapsacks, fragments of broken wagons and muskets, in the utmost  disorder and confusion.    \"Spoils for the marauders,\" whispered the wounded officer, pressing on.  \"It seems they have not been here yet. God have mercy on me, if they  should come now and look on me, too, as their spoil!\"    He glanced around anxiously, and in doing so his eye beheld an  unsheathed, blood-stained sabre lying near his feet. He made an effort  to take it up regardless of the blood which, in consequence of the  effort, trickled again in larger drops from his wounds.    \"Well,\" he said, in a loud and menacing voice, \"I shall defend my life  at least to the best of my ability; the hateful enemies shall not  capture me as long as I am alive. Forward, then; forward with God! He  will not desert a faithful soldier!\"    And supporting himself on his sabre, as if it were a staff, the officer  walked on. Everywhere he met with the same signs of war and destruction;  everywhere he beheld corpses, blood-stained cannon-balls, or muskets,  which the fugitives had thrown away.    \"Oh, for a drop of water!\" groaned the officer, while slowly crossing  the field; \"my lips are parched!\"    Tottering and reeling, with the aid of his sabre, and by his firm,  energetic will, and the resolution of his spirit, he succeeded once more  in overcoming the weakness of his body.    He hastened on with quicker steps, and hope now lent wings to his feet,  for yonder, in the rear of the shrubbery, he beheld a house; men were  there, assistance also.    At length, after untold efforts, and a terrible struggle with his pain  and exhaustion, he reached the peasant's house. Looking up with longing  eyes to the windows, he shouted: \"Oh, give me a drink of water! Have  mercy on a wounded soldier!\"    But no voice responded; no human face appeared behind the small green  windows. Every thing remained silent and deserted.    With a deep sigh, and an air of bitter disappointment depicted on his  features, he murmured:    \"My feet cannot carry me any farther. Perhaps my voice was too weak, and  they did not hear me. I will advance closer to the house.\"    Gathering his strength, with staggering steps he approached and found  the door only ajar; whereupon he opened it and entered.    Within the house every thing was as silent as without; not a human being  was to be seen; not a voice replied to his shouts. The inside of the  dwelling presented a sorry spectacle. All the doors were open; the clay  floor was saturated here and there with blood; the small, low rooms were  almost empty; only some half-destroyed furniture, a few broken jars and  other utensils, were lying about. The inmates either had fled from the  enemy, or he had expelled them from their house.    \"There is no help for me,\" sighed the officer, casting a despairing  glance on this scene of desolation. \"Oh, why was it not vouchsafed to me  to die on the battle-field? Why did not a compassionate cannon-ball have  mercy on me, and give me death on the field of honor? Then, at least, I  should have died as a brave soldier, and my name would have been  honorably mentioned; now I am doomed to be named only among the missing!  Oh, it is sad and bitter to die alone, unlamented by my friends, and  with no tear of compassion from the eyes of my queen! Oh, Louisa,  Louisa, you will weep much for your crown, for your country, and for  your people, but you will not have a tear for the poor lieutenant of  your dragoons who is dying here alone uttering a prayer for a blessing  on you! Farewell queen, may God grant you strength, and--\"    His words died away; a deadly pallor overspread his features, his head  turned dizzy, and a ringing noise filled his ears.    \"Death! death!\" he murmured faintly, and, with a sigh, he fell senseless  to the ground.    Every thing had become silent again in the humble house; not a human  sound interrupted the stillness reigning in the desolate room. Only the  hum of a few flies, rushing with their heads against the window-panes,  was heard. Once a rustling noise was heard in a corner, and a mouse  glided across the floor, its piercing, glittering eyes looked  searchingly around, and the sight of the bloody, motionless form, lying  prostrate on the floor, seemed to affright it, for it turned and slipped  away even faster than it had approached, and disappeared in the corner.    The sun rose higher, and shone down on the dimmed windows of the house,  reflecting their yellow outlines on the floor, and illuminated the gold  lace adorning the uniform of the prostrate and motionless officer.    All at once the silence was broken by the approach of hurried steps, and  a loud voice was heard near at hand, shouting:    \"Is there anybody in the house?\"    Then every thing was still again. The new-comer was evidently waiting  for a reply. After a pause, the steps drew nearer--now they were already  in the hall; and now the tall, slender form of a Prussian officer, with  a bandaged head and arm, appeared on the threshold of the room. When he  beheld the immovable body on the floor, his pale face expressed surprise  and compassion.    \"An officer of the queen's dragoons!\" he ejaculated, and in the next  moment he was by his side. He knelt down, and placed his hand  inquiringly on the heart and forehead of the prostrate officer.    \"He is warm still,\" he murmured, \"and it seems to me his heart is yet  beating. Perhaps, perhaps he only fainted from loss of blood, just as I  did before my wounds had been dressed. Let us see.\"    He hastily drew a flask from his bosom, and pouring some of its contents  into his hand, he washed with it the forehead and temples of his poor  comrade.    A slight shudder now pervaded his whole frame, and he looked with a  half-unconscious, dreamy glance into the face of the stranger, who had  bent over him with an air of heart-felt sympathy.    \"Where am I?\" he asked, in a low, tremulous voice.    \"With a comrade,\" said the other, kindly. \"With a companion in  misfortune who is wounded, and a fugitive like you. I am an officer of  the Hohenlohe regiment, and fought at Jena. Since last night I have been  wandering about, constantly exposed to the danger of falling into the  hands of the enemy. My name is Pueckler--it is a good Prussian name. You  see, therefore, it is a friend who is assisting his poor comrade, and  you need not fear any thing. Now, tell me what I can do for you?\"    \"Water, water!\" groaned the wounded officer, \"water!\"    \"You had better take some of my wine here,\" said the other; \"it will  quench your thirst, and invigorate you at the same time.\"    He held the flask to the lips of his comrade, and made him sip a little  of his wine.    \"Now it is enough,\" he said, withdrawing the flask from his lips. \"Since  you have quenched your thirst, comrade, would you not like to eat a  piece of bread and some meat? Ah, you smile; you are surprised because I  guess your wishes and know your sufferings. You need not wonder at it,  however, comrade, for I have undergone just the same torture as you.  Above all, you must eat something.\"    While speaking, he had produced from his knapsack a loaf of bread and a  piece of roast chicken, and cutting a few slices from both, placed them  tenderly in the mouth of the sufferer, looking on with smiling joy while  the other moved his jaws, slowly at first, but soon more rapidly and  eagerly.    \"Now another draught of wine, comrade,\" he said, \"and then, I may dare  to give you some more food. Hush! do not say a word--it is a sacred work  you are doing now, a work by which you are just about to save a human  life. You must not, therefore, interrupt it by any superfluous  protestations of gratitude. Moreover, your words are written in your  eyes, and you cannot tell me any thing better and more beautiful than  what I am reading therein. Drink! So! And here is a piece of bread and a  wing of the chicken. While you are eating, I will look around in the  yard and garden to find there some water to wash your wounds.\"    Without waiting for a reply, he hastily left the officer alone with the  piece of bread, the wing of the chicken, and the flask. When he  returned, about fifteen minutes later, with a jar filled with water, the  bread and meat had disappeared; but instead of the pale, immovable, and  cadaverous being, he found seated on the floor a young man with flashing  eyes, a faint blush on his cheeks, and a gentle smile on his lips.    \"You have saved me,\" he said, extending his hand toward his returning  comrade. \"I should have died of hunger and exhaustion, if you had not  relieved me so mercifully.\"    \"Comrade,\" said the officer, smiling, \"you have just repeated the same  words which I addressed two hours ago to another comrade whom I met on  the retreat; or, to speak more correctly, who found me lying in the  ditch. The lucky fellow had got a horse; he offered me a seat behind  him. But I saw that the animal was too weak to carry both of us; hence I  did not accept his offer, but I took the refreshments which he gave to  me, and with which he not only saved my life, but yours too. You are,  therefore, under no obligations to me, but to him alone.\"    \"You are as kind as you are generous,\" said the other, gently,  involuntarily raising his hand toward his forehead.    \"And I see that you are in pain,\" exclaimed the officer, \"and that the  wound in your head is burning. Mine has been dressed already, and my  shattered arm bandaged--for I received both wounds yesterday in the  early part of the battle, and the surgeon attended to them while the  bullets were hissing around us.\"    \"I was wounded only when every thing was lost,\" sighed the other. \"A  member of the accursed imperial guard struck me down.\"    \"I hope you gave him a receipt in full for your wounds?\" asked the "]]]
