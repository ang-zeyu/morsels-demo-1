Whereupon I  informed them what would have happened to us thirty years ago if we had  ventured to address our parents in such fashion. But Sweetheart, with  the gravity of her age upon her, endeavoured to raise the discussion to  its proper level.    \"Scott writes such a lot before you get at the story,\" she objected,  knitting her brows; \"why couldn't he just have begun right away?\"    \"With Squire Trelawney and Dr. Livesey drawing at their pipes in the  oak-pannelled dining room, and Black Dog outside the door, and Pew  coming tapping along the road with his stick!\" cried Hugh John, turning  off a sketchy synopsis of his favourite situations in fiction.    \"Now that's what I call a proper book!\" said Sir Toady, hastily rolling  himself out of the way of being kicked. (For with these unusual  children, the smooth ordinary upper surfaces of life covered a constant  succession of private wars and rumours of wars, which went on under the  table at meals, in the schoolroom, and even, it is whispered, in  church.)    As for blithe Maid Margaret, she said nothing, for she was engaged in  testing the capacities of a green slope of turf for turning somersaults  upon.    \"In Sir Walter Scott's time,\" I resumed gravely, \"novels were not  written for little girls--\"    \"Then why did you give us Miss Edgeworth to read?\" said Sweetheart,  quickly. But I went on without noticing the interruption, \"Now, if you  like, I will tell you some of Sir Walter's stories over again, and then  I will mark in your own little edition the chapters you can read for  yourselves.\"    The last clause quieted the joyous shout which the promise of a  story--any sort of a story--had called forth. An uncertain look crept  over their faces, as if they scented afar off that abomination of  desolation--\"lessons in holiday time.\"    \"_Must_ we read the chapters?\" said Hugh John, unhopefully.    \"Tell us the stories, anyway, and leave it to our honour!\" suggested Sir  Toady Lion, with a twinkle in his eye.    \"Is it a story--oh, don't begin wifout me!\" Maid Margaret called from  behind the trees, her sturdy five-year-old legs carrying her to the  scene of action so fast that her hat fell off on the grass and she had  to turn back for it.    \"Well, I will tell you, if I can, the story of 'Waverley,'\" I said.    \"Was he called after the pens?\" said Toady Lion the irreverent, but  under his breath. He was, however, promptly kicked into silence by his  peers--seriously this time, for he who interferes with the telling of a  story is a \"Whelk,\"--which, for the moment, is the family word for  whatever is base, mean, unprofitable, and unworthy of being associated  with.    But first I told them about the writing of _Waverley_, and the hand at  the Edinburgh back window which wrote and wrote. Only that, but the  story as told by Lockhart had affected my imagination as a boy.    \"Did you ever hear of the Unwearied Hand?\" I asked them.    \"It sounds a nice title,\" said Sir Toady; \"had he only one?\"    \"It was in the early summer weather of 1814,\" I began, \"after a dinner  in a house in George Street, that a young man, sitting at the wine with  his companions, looked out of the window, and, turning pale, asked his  next neighbour to change seats with him.    \"'There it is--at it again!' he said, with a thump of his fist on  thetable that made the decanters jump, and clattered the glasses;  'it has haunted me every night these three weeks. Just when I am  lifting my glass I look through the window, and there it is at  it--writing--writing--always writing!'    \"So the young men, pressing about, looked eagerly, and lo! seen through  the back window of a house in a street built at right angles, they saw  the shape of a man's hand writing swiftly, steadily, on large quarto  pages. As soon as one was finished, it was added to a pile which grew  and grew, rising, as it were, visibly before their eyes.    \"'It goes on like that all the time, even after the candles are lit,'  said the young man, 'and it makes me ashamed. I get no peace for it when  I am not at my books. Why cannot the man do his work without making  others uncomfortable?'    \"Perhaps some of the company may have thought it was not a man at all,  but some prisoned fairy tied to an endless task--Wizard Michael's  familiar spirit, or Lord Soulis's imp Red Cap doing his master's bidding  with a goose-quill.    \"But it was something much more wonderful than any of these. It was the  hand of Walter Scott finishing _Waverley_, at the rate of a volume every  ten days!\"    \"Why did he work so hard?\" demanded Hugh John, whom the appearance of  fifty hands diligently writing would not have annoyed--no, not if they  had all worked like sewing-machines.    \"Because,\" I answered, \"the man who wrote _Waverley_ was beginning to  have more need of money. He had bought land. He was involved in other  people's misfortunes. Besides, for a long time, he had been a great  poet, and now of late there had arisen a greater.\"    \"I know,\" cried Sweetheart, \"Lord Byron--but _I_ don't think he was.\"    \"Anyway Fitzjames and Roderick Dhu is ripping!\" announced Hugh John,  and, rising to his feet, he whistled shrill in imitation of the outlaw.  It was the time to take the affairs of children at the fulness of the  tide.    \"I think,\" I ventured, \"that you would like the story of _Waverley_ if I  were to tell it now. I know you will like _Rob Roy_. Which shall it be  first?\"    Then there were counter-cries of \"Waverley\" and \"Rob Roy\"--all the fury  of a contested election. But Sweetheart, waiting till the brawlers were  somewhat breathed, indicated the final sense of the meeting by saying  quietly, \"_Tell us the one the hand was writing!_\"            RED CAP TALES    TOLD FROM    WAVERLEY            THE FIRST TALE FROM \"WAVERLEY\"[1]      I. GOOD-BYE TO WAVERLEY-HONOUR    ON a certain Sunday evening, toward the middle of the eighteenth  century, a young man stood practising the guards of the broadsword in  the library of an old English manor-house. The young man was Captain  Edward Waverley, recently assigned to the command of a company in  Gardiner's regiment of dragoons, and his uncle was coming in to say a  few words to him before he set out to join the colours.    Being a soldier and a hero, Edward Waverley was naturally tall and  handsome, but, owing to the manner of his education, his uncle, an high  Jacobite of the old school, held that he was \"somewhat too bookish\" for  a proper man. He must therefore see a little of the world, asserted old  Sir Everard.    His Aunt Rachel had another reason for wishing him to leave  Waverley-Honour. She had actually observed her Edward look too often  across at the Squire's pew in church! Now Aunt Rachel held it no wrong  to look at Squire Stubbs's pew if only that pew had been empty. But it  was (oh, wickedness!) just when it contained the dear old-fashioned  sprigged gown and the fresh pretty face of Miss Cecilia Stubbs, that  Aunt Rachel's nephew looked most often in that direction. In addition to  which the old lady was sure she had observed \"that little Celie Stubbs\"  glance over at her handsome Edward in a way that--well, when _she_ was  young! And here the old lady bridled and tossed her head, and the words  which her lips formed themselves to utter (though she was too ladylike  to speak them) were obviously \"The Minx!\" Hence it was clear to the most  simple and unprejudiced that a greater distance had better be put  between the Waverley loft and the Squire's pew--and that as soon as  possible.    Edward's uncle, Sir Everard, had wished him to travel abroad in company  with his tutor, a staunch Jacobite clergyman by the name of Mr.  Pembroke. But to this Edward's father, who was a member of the  government, unexpectedly refused his sanction. Now Sir Everard despised  his younger brother as a turncoat (and indeed something little better  than a spy), but he could not gainsay a father's authority, even though  he himself had brought the boy up to be his heir.    \"I am willing that you should be a soldier,\" he said to Edward; \"your  ancestors have always been of that profession. Be brave like them, but  not rash. Remember you are the last of the Waverleys and the hope of  the house. Keep no company with gamblers, with rakes, or with Whigs. Do  your duty to God, to the Church of England, and--\" He was going to say  \"to the King,\" when he remembered that by his father's wish Edward was  going to fight the battles of King George. So the old Jacobite finished  off rather lamely by repeating, \"to the Church of England and all  constituted authorities!\"    Then the old man, not trusting himself to say more, broke off abruptly  and went down to the stables to choose the horses which were to carry  Edward to the north. Finally, he delivered into the hands of his nephew  an important letter addressed as follows:--    \"To Cosmo Comyne Bradwardine, Esquire of Bradwardine, at his principal  mansion of Tully-Veolan in Perthshire, North Britain,--_These._--\"    For that was the dignified way in which men of rank directed their  letters in those days.    The leave-taking of Mr. Pembroke, Edward's tutor, was even longer and  more solemn. And had Edward attended in the least to his moralisings, he  might have felt somewhat depressed. In conclusion, the good clergyman  presented him with several pounds of foolscap, closely written over in  a neat hand.    \"These,\" he said, handling the sheets reverently, \"are purposely written  small that they may be convenient to keep by you in your saddle-bags.  They are my works--my unpublished works. They will teach you the real  fundamental principles of the Church, principles concerning which, while  you have been my pupil, I have been under obligation never to speak to  you. But now as you read them, I doubt not but that the light will come  upon you!

So wichtig es ist, nicht das Band zu loesen, welches die  gleichmaessige Erforschung der organischen und unorganischen Natur umfasst;  so werden dennoch der zunehmende Umfang und die allmaehlige Entwickelung  dieses Instituts die Nothwendigkeit fuehlen lassen, ausser den  gemeinschaftlichen oeffentlichen Versammlungen, denen diese Halle bestimmt  ist, auch sectionsweise ausfuehrlichere Vortraege ueber einzelne Disciplinen  zu halten. Nur in solchen engeren Kreisen, nur unter Maennern, welche  Gleichheit der Studien zu einander hinzieht, sind muendliche Discussionen  moeglich. Ohne diese Art der Eroerterung, ohne Ansicht der gesammelten, oft  schwer zu bestimmenden, und darum streitigen Naturkoerper, wuerde der  freimuethige Verkehr Wahrheit-suchender Maenner eines belebenden Princips  beraubt sein.    Unter den Anstalten, welche in dieser Stadt zur Aufnahme der Gesellschaft  getroffen worden sind, hat man vorzuglich auf die Moeglichkeit einer  solchen Absonderung in Sectionen Ruecksicht genommen. Die Hoffnung, dass  diese Vorkehrungen sich Ihres Beifalls erfreuen werden, legt mir die  Pflicht auf, hier in Erinnerung zu bringen, dass, obgleich Ihr Vertrauen  zweien Reisenden zugleich die Geschaeftsfuehrung uebertragen hat, doch nur  einem allein, meinem edlen Freunde, Herrn Lichtenstein, das Verdienst  sorgsamer Vorsicht und rastloser Thaetigkeit zukommt. Den  wissenschaftlichen Geist achtend, der die Gesellschaft deutscher  Naturforscher und Aerzte beseelt, und die Nuetzlichkeit ihres Bestrebens  anerkennend, ist das Koenigliche Ministerium des Unterrichts, seit vielen  Monaten, jedem unsrer Wuensche mit der aufopferndsten Bereitwilligkeit  zuvorgekommen.    In der Naehe der Versammlungsorte, welche auf diese Weise fuer ihre  allgemeinen und besondern Arbeiten vorbereitet worden, erheben sich die  Museen, welche der Zergliederungskunst, der Zoologie, der Oryktognosie und  der Gebirgskunde gewidmet sind. Sie liefern dem Naturforscher einen  reichen Stoff der Beobachtung und vielfache Gegenstaende kritischer  Discussionen. Der groessere Theil dieser wohlgeordneten Sammlungen zaehlt,  wie die Universitaet zu Berlin, noch nicht zwei Decennien; die aeltesten, zu  welchen der botanische Garten (einer der reichsten in Europa) gehoert, sind  in dieser Periode nicht bloss vermehrt, sondern gaenzlich umgeschaffen  worden. Der frohe und lehrreiche Genuss, den solche Institute gewaehren,  erinnert mit tiefem Dankgefuehle, dass sie das Werk des erhabenen Monarchen  sind, der, geraeuschlos, in einfacher Groesse, jedes Jahr diese Koenigsstadt  mit neuen Schaetzen der Natur und der Kunst ausschmueckt, und, was einen  noch hoeheren Werth hat, als diese Schaetze selbst, was dem preussischen  Volke jugendliche Kraft und inneres Leben und gemuethvolle Anhaenglichkeit  an das alte Herrscherhaus giebt, der sich huldreich jedem Talente zuneigt,  und freier Ausbildung des Geistes vertrauensvoll seinen koeniglichen Schutz  verleiht."]]]
