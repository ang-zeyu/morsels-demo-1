[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2066"],[0,"Wildfire (#2)"],[1,", as the  girl low down over his neck was riding for the love of riding. The Sage  King whistled again, and shot off with graceful sweep to meet them;  Sarchedon plunged after him; Two Face and Plume jealously trooped down,  too, but Dusty Ben, after a toss of his head, went on grazing. The gray  and the black met Buckles and could not turn in time to stay with him.  A girl's gay scream pealed up the slope, and Buckles went lower and  faster. Sarchedon was left behind. Then the gray King began to run as  if before he had been loping. He was beautiful in action. This was  play--a game--a race--plainly dominated by the spirit of the girl.  Lucy's hair was a bright stream of gold in the wind. She rode bareback.  It seemed that she was hunched low over Buckles with her knees high on  his back--scarcely astride him at all. Yet her motion was one with the  horse. Again that wild, gay scream pealed out--call or laugh or  challenge. Sage King, with a fleetness that made the eyes of Bostil and  his riders glisten, took the lead, and then sheered off to slow down,  while Buckles thundered past. Lucy was pulling him hard, and had him  plunging to a halt, when the rider Holley ran out to grasp his bridle.  Buckles was snorting and his ears were laid back. He pounded the ground  and scattered the pebbles.    \"No use, Lucy,\" said Bostil. \"You can't beat the King at your own game,  even with a runnin' start.\"    Lucy Bostil's eyes were blue, as keen as her father's, and now they  flashed like his. She had a hand twisted in the horse's long mane, and  as, lithe and supple, she slipped a knee across his broad back she  shook a little gantleted fist at Bostil's gray racer.    \"Sage King, I hate you!\" she called, as if the horse were human. \"And  I'll beat you some day!\"    Bostil swore by the gods his Sage King was the swiftest horse in all  that wild upland country of wonderful horses. He swore the great gray  could look back over his shoulder and run away from any broken horse  known to the riders.    Bostil himself was half horse, and the half of him that was human he  divided between love of his fleet racers and his daughter Lucy. He had  seen years of hard riding on that wild Utah border where, in those  days, a horse meant all the world to a man. A lucky strike of grassy  upland and good water south of the Rio Colorado made him rich in all  that he cared to own. The Indians, yet unspoiled by white men, were  friendly. Bostil built a boat at the Indian crossing of the Colorado  and the place became known as Bostil's Ford. From time to time his  personality and his reputation and his need brought horse-hunters,  riders, sheep-herders, and men of pioneer spirit, as well as wandering  desert travelers, to the Ford, and the lonely, isolated hamlet slowly  grew. North of the river it was more than two hundred miles to the  nearest little settlement, with only a few lonely ranches on the road;  to the west were several villages, equally distant, but cut off for two  months at a time by the raging Colorado, flooded by melting snow up in  the mountains. Eastward from the Ford stretched a ghastly, broken,  unknown desert of canyons. Southward rolled the beautiful uplands, with  valleys of sage and grass, and plateaus of pine and cedar, until this  rich rolling gray and green range broke sharply on a purple horizon  line of upflung rocky ramparts and walls and monuments, wild, dim, and  mysterious.    Bostil's cattle and horses were numberless, and many as were his  riders, he always could use more. But most riders did not abide long  with Bostil, first because some of them were of a wandering breed,  wild-horse hunters themselves; and secondly, Bostil had two great  faults: he seldom paid a rider in money, and he never permitted one to  own a fleet horse. He wanted to own all the fast horses himself. And in  those days every rider, especially a wild-horse hunter, loved his steed  as part of himself. If there was a difference between Bostil and any  rider of the sage, it was that, as he had more horses, so he had more  love.    Whenever Bostil could not get possession of a horse he coveted, either  by purchase or trade, he invariably acquired a grievance toward the  owner. This happened often, for riders were loath to part with their  favorites. And he had made more than one enemy by his persistent  nagging. It could not be said, however, that he sought to drive hard  bargains. Bostil would pay any price asked for a horse.    Across the Colorado, in a high, red-walled canyon opening upon the  river, lived a poor sheep-herder and horse-trader named Creech. This  man owned a number of thoroughbreds, two of which he would not part  with for all the gold in the uplands. These racers, Blue Roan and Peg,  had been captured wild on the ranges by Ute Indians and broken to  racing. They were still young and getting faster every year. Bostil  wanted them because he coveted them and because he feared them. It  would have been a terrible blow to him if any horse ever beat the gray.  But Creech laughed at all offers and taunted Bostil with a boast that  in another summer he would see a horse out in front of the King.    To complicate matters and lead rivalry into hatred young Joel Creech, a  great horseman, but worthless in the eyes of all save his father, had  been heard to say that some day he would force a race between the King  and Blue Roan. And that threat had been taken in various ways. It  alienated Bostil beyond all hope of reconciliation. It made Lucy Bostil  laugh and look sweetly mysterious. She had no enemies and she liked  everybody. It was even gossiped by the women of Bostil's Ford that she  had more than liking for the idle Joel. But the husbands of these  gossips said Lucy was only tender-hearted. Among the riders, when they  sat around their lonely camp-fires, or lounged at the corrals of the  Ford, there was speculation in regard to this race hinted by Joel  Creech. There never had been a race between the King and Blue Roan, and  there never would be, unless Joel were to ride off with Lucy. In that  case there would be the grandest race ever run on the uplands, with the  odds against Blue Roan only if he carried double. If Joel put Lucy up  on the Roan and he rode Peg there would be another story. Lucy Bostil  was a slip of a girl, born on a horse, as strong and supple as an  Indian, and she could ride like a burr sticking in a horse's mane. With  Blue Roan carrying her light weight she might run away from any one up  on the King--which for Bostil would be a double tragedy, equally in the  loss of his daughter and the beating of his best-beloved racer. But  with Joel on Peg, such a race would end in heartbreak for all  concerned, for the King would outrun Peg, and that would bring riders  within gunshot.    It had always been a fascinating subject, this long-looked-for race. It  grew more so when Joel's infatuation for Lucy became known. There were  fewer riders who believed Lucy might elope with Joel than there were  who believed Joel might steal his father's horses. But all the riders  who loved horses and all the women who loved gossip were united in at  least one thing, and that was that something like a race or a romance  would soon disrupt the peaceful, sleepy tenor of Bostil's Ford.    In addition to Bostil's growing hatred for the Creeches, he had a great  fear of Cordts, the horse-thief. A fear ever restless, ever watchful.  Cordts hid back in the untrodden ways. He had secret friends among the  riders of the ranges, faithful followers back in the canyon camps, gold  for the digging, cattle by the thousand, and fast horses. He had always  gotten what he wanted--except one thing. That was a certain horse. And  the horse was Sage King.    Cordts was a bad man, a product of the early gold-fields of California  and Idaho, an outcast from that evil wave of wanderers retreating back  over the trails so madly traveled westward. He became a lord over the  free ranges. But more than all else he was a rider. He knew a horse. He  was as much horse as Bostil. Cordts rode into this wild free-range  country, where he had been heard to say that a horse-thief was meaner  than a poisoned coyote. Nevertheless, he became a horse-thief. The  passion he had conceived for the Sage King was the passion of a man for  an unattainable woman. Cordts swore that he would never rest, that he  would not die, till he owned the King. So there was reason for Bostil's  great fear.        CHAPTER II    Bostil went toward the house with his daughter, turning at the door to  call a last word to his riders about the care of his horses.    The house was a low, flat, wide structure, with a corridor running  through the middle, from which doors led into the adobe-walled rooms.  The windows were small openings high up, evidently intended for defense  as well as light, and they had rude wooden shutters. The floor was  clay, covered everywhere by Indian blankets. A pioneer's home it was,  simple and crude, yet comfortable, and having the rare quality peculiar  to desert homes it was cool in summer and warm in winter.    As Bostil entered with his arm round Lucy a big hound rose from the  hearth. This room was immense, running the length of the house, and it  contained a huge stone fireplace, where a kettle smoked fragrantly, and  rude home-made chairs with blanket coverings, and tables to match, and  walls covered with bridles, guns, pistols, Indian weapons and  ornaments, and trophies of the chase. In a far corner stood a  work-bench, with tools upon it and horse trappings under it. In the  opposite corner a door led into the kitchen. This room was Bostil's  famous living-room, in which many things had happened, some of which  had helped make desert history and were never mentioned by Bostil.    Bostil's sister came in from the kitchen. She was a huge person with a  severe yet motherly face. She had her hands on her hips, and she cast a  rather disapproving"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20660"],[0,"The Faith of Islam (#2)"],[1," of other creeds, and, speaking generally, a tendency to inertness. It  is thus that in Bengal, Madras and perhaps in other places, they have  fallen far behind the Hindus in educational status, and in the number of  appointments they hold in the Government service. Indeed, this subject is a  serious one and deserves the special attention of the Indian Government. In  Bengal the proportion of Musalmans to Hindus in the upper ranks of the  Uncovenanted Civil Service in 1871 was 77 to 341. In the year 1880 it had  declined to 53 to 451. The state of affairs in Madras is equally bad. Yet  an intelligent Muslim, as a rule, makes a good official.    Looking at the subject from a wider stand-point, I think the Church has  hardly yet realised how great a barrier this system of Islam is to her  onward march in the East. Surely special men with special training are  required for such an enterprise as that of encountering Islam in its own  strongholds. No better pioneers of the Christian {xiii} faith could be  found in the East than men won from the Crescent to the Cross.    All who are engaged in such an enterprise will perhaps find some help in  this volume, and I am not without hope that it may also throw some light on  the political questions of the day.    {1}           *       *       *       *       *      THE FAITH OF ISLAM.    CHAPTER I.    THE FOUNDATIONS OF ISLAM.    The creed of Islam, \"La-ilaha-il-lal-lahu wa Muhammad-ur-Rasul-Ullah,\"  (There is no deity but God, and Muhammad is the Apostle of God) is very  short, but the system itself is a very dogmatic one. Such statements as:  \"The Quran is an all-embracing and sufficient code, regulating everything,\"  \"The Quran contains the _entire_ code of Islam--that is, it is not a book  of religious precepts merely, but it governs all that a Muslim does,\" \"The  Quran contains the whole religion of Muhammad,\" \"The Quran which contains  the whole Gospel of Islam\" are not simply misleading, they are erroneous.  So far from the Quran alone being the _sole_ rule of faith and practice to  Muslims, there is not one single sect amongst them whose faith and practice  is based on it alone. No one among them disputes its authority or casts any  doubt upon its genuineness. Its voice is supreme in all that it concerns,  but its exegesis, the whole system of legal jurisprudence and of  theological science, is largely founded on the Traditions. Amongst the  orthodox Musalmans, the foundations of the Faith are four in number, the  Quran, Sunnat, Ijma' and Qias. The fact that all the sects do not agree  with the orthodox--the Sunnis--in this matter illustrates another important  fact in Islam--the want of unity amongst its followers. {2}    1. THE QURAN.--The question of the inspiration will be fully discussed, and  an account of the laws of the exegesis of the Quran will be given in the  next chapter. It is sufficient now to state that this book is held in the  highest veneration by Muslims of every sect. When being read it is kept on  a stand elevated above the floor, and no one must read or touch it without  first making a legal ablution.[2] It is not translated unless there is the  most urgent necessity, and even then the Arabic text is printed with the  translation. It is said that God chose the sacred month of Ramazan in which  to give all the revelations which in the form of books have been vouchsafed  to mankind. Thus on the first night of that month the books of Abraham came  down from heaven; on the sixth the books of Moses; on the thirteenth the  Injil, or Gospel, and on the twenty-seventh the Quran. On that night, the  Laylut-ul-Qadr, or \"night of power,\" the whole Quran is said to have  descended to the lowest of the seven heavens, from whence it was brought  piecemeal to Muhammad as occasion required.[3] \"Verily we have caused it  (the Quran) to descend on the night of power.\" (Sura xcvii. 1.) That night  is called the blessed night, the night better than a thousand months, the  night when angels came down by the permission of their Lord, the night  which bringeth peace and blessings till the rosy dawn. Twice on that night  in the solitude of the cave of Hira the voice called, twice though pressed  sore \"as if a fearful weight had been laid upon him,\" the prophet struggled  {3} against its influence. The third time he heard the words:--     \"Recite thou, in the name of thy Lord who created--    Created man from clots of blood.\" (Sura xcvi. 5.)    \"When the voice had ceased to speak, telling how from minutest beginnings  man had been called into existence, and lifted up by understanding and  knowledge of the Lord, who is most beneficent, and who by the pen had  revealed that which man did not know, Muhammad woke up from his trance and  felt as if \"a book had been written in his heart.\" He was much alarmed.  Tradition records that he went hastily to his wife and said--\"O Khadija!  what has happened to me!\" He lay down and she watched by him. When he  recovered from his paroxysm, he said \"O Khadija! he of whom one would not  have believed (_i.e._, himself) has become either a soothsayer (kahin) or  mad.\" She replied, \"God is my protection, O Ab-ul-kasim. He will surely not  let such a thing happen unto thee, for thou speakest the truth, dost not  return evil for evil, keepest faith, art of a good life and art kind to thy  relatives and friends, and neither art thou a talker abroad in the bazaars.  What has befallen thee? Hast thou seen aught terrible?\" Muhammad replied  \"Yes.\" And he told her what he had seen. Whereupon she answered and  said:--\"Rejoice, O dear husband and be of good cheer. He in whose hands  stands Khadija's life, is my witness that thou wilt be the Prophet of this  people.\"[4] The next Sura, the 74th, was revealed at Mecca, after which  there seems to have been an intermission, called the Fatrah. It was during  this time that the Prophet gained some knowledge of the contents of the  Jewish and the Christian Scriptures.    Gabriel is believed to have been the medium of communication. This fact,  however, is only once stated in the Quran:--\"Say, whoso is the enemy of  Gabriel--For he it is {4} who by God's leave hath caused the Quran to  descend on thy heart\" (Sura ii. 91.) This Sura was revealed some years  after the Prophet's flight to Madina. The other references to the  revelation of the Quran are:--\"Verily from the Lord of the worlds hath this  book come down; the Faithful Spirit (Ruh-ul-Amin) hath come down with it\"  (Sura xxvi. 192.) \"The Quran is no other than a revelation revealed to him,  one terrible in power (Shadid-ul-Qua) taught it him.\" (Sura liii. 5.) These  latter passages do not state clearly that Gabriel was the medium of  communication, but the belief that he was is almost, if not entirely,  universal, and the Commentators say that the terms \"Ruh-ul-Amin\" and  \"Shadid-ul-Qua\" refer to no other angel or spirit. The use of the word  \"taught\" in the last Sura quoted, and the following expression in Sura  lxxv. 18. \"When we have _recited it_, then follow thou the recital,\" show  that the Quran is entirely an objective revelation and that Muhammad was  only a passive medium of communication. The Muhammadan historian, Ibn  Khaldoun, says on this point:--\"Of all the divine books the Quran is the  only one of which the text, words and phrases have been communicated to a  prophet by an audible voice. It is otherwise with the Pentateuch, the  Gospel and the other divine books: the prophets received them under the  form of ideas.\"[5] This expresses the universal belief on this point--a  belief which reveals the essentially mechanical nature of Islam.    The Quran thus revealed is now looked upon as the standing miracle of  Islam. Other divine books, it is admitted, were revelations received under  the form of ideas, but the Quran is far superior to them all for the actual  text was revealed to the ear of the prophet. Thus we read in Sura lxxv.  16-19:--    {5}     \"Move not thy tongue in haste to follow and master this revelation;    For we will see to the collecting and recital of it;    _But when we have recited it_, then follow thou the recital;    And verily it shall be ours to make it clear to thee.\"    The Quran is, then, believed to be a miraculous revelation of divine  eloquence, as regards both _form_ and _substance_, arrangement of words,  and its revelation of sacred things. It is asserted that each  well-accredited prophet performed miracles in that particular department of  human skill or science most flourishing in his age. Thus in the days of  Moses magic exercised a wide influence, but all the magicians of Pharaoh's  court had to submit to the superior skill of the Hebrew prophet. In the  days of Jesus the science of medicine flourished. Men possessed great skill  in the art of healing; but no physician could equal the skill of Jesus, who  not only healed the sick, but raised the dead. In the days of Muhammad the  special and most striking feature of the age was the wonderful power of the  Arabs in the art of poetry. Muhammad-ud-Damiri says:--\"Wisdom hath alighted  on three things--the brain of the Franks, the hands of the Chinese and the  tongue of the Arabs.\" They were unrivalled for their eloquence, for the  skill with which they arranged their material and gave expression to their  thoughts. It is in this very particular that superior excellence is claimed  for the Quran.[6] It is to the Muhammadan mind a sure evidence of its  miraculous origin that it should excel in this respect. Muslims say that  miracles have followed the revelations given to other prophets in order to  confirm the divine message. In this case the Quran is both a revelation and  a miracle. {6} Muhammad himself said:--\"Each prophet has received manifest  signs which carried conviction to men: but that which I have received is  the revelation. So I hope to have a larger following on the day of  resurrection than any other prophet has.\" Ibn Khaldoun says"]]]
