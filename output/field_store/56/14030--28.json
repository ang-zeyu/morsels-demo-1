Obj. 2: Further, it is not fitting to unite things that are  infinitely apart, even as it would not be a fitting union if one were  \"to paint a figure in which the neck of a horse was joined to the  head of a man\" [*Horace, Ars. Poet., line 1]. But God and flesh are  infinitely apart; since God is most simple, and flesh is most  composite--especially human flesh. Therefore it was not fitting that  God should be united to human flesh.    Obj. 3: Further, a body is as distant from the highest spirit as evil  is from the highest good. But it was wholly unfitting that God, Who  is the highest good, should assume evil. Therefore it was not fitting  that the highest uncreated spirit should assume a body.    Obj. 4: Further, it is not becoming that He Who surpassed the  greatest things should be contained in the least, and He upon Whom  rests the care of great things should leave them for lesser things.  But God--Who takes care of the whole world--the whole universe of  things cannot contain. Therefore it would seem unfitting that \"He  should be hid under the frail body of a babe in swathing bands, in  comparison with Whom the whole universe is accounted as little; and  that this Prince should quit His throne for so long, and transfer the  government of the whole world to so frail a body,\" as Volusianus  writes to Augustine (Ep. cxxxv).    _On the contrary,_ It would seem most fitting that by visible things  the invisible things of God should be made known; for to this end was  the whole world made, as is clear from the word of the Apostle (Rom.  1:20): \"For the invisible things of God . . . are clearly seen, being  understood by the things that are made.\" But, as Damascene says (De  Fide Orth. iii, 1), by the mystery of the Incarnation are made known  at once the goodness, the wisdom, the justice, and the power or might  of God--\"His goodness, for He did not despise the weakness of His own  handiwork; His justice, since, on man's defeat, He caused the tyrant  to be overcome by none other than man, and yet He did not snatch men  forcibly from death; His wisdom, for He found a suitable discharge  for a most heavy debt; His power, or infinite might, for there is  nothing greater than for God to become incarnate . . .\"    _I answer that,_ To each thing, that is befitting which belongs to it  by reason of its very nature; thus, to reason befits man, since this  belongs to him because he is of a rational nature. But the very  nature of God is goodness, as is clear from Dionysius (Div. Nom. i).  Hence, what belongs to the essence of goodness befits God. But it  belongs to the essence of goodness to communicate itself to others,  as is plain from Dionysius (Div. Nom. iv). Hence it belongs to the  essence of the highest good to communicate itself in the highest  manner to the creature, and this is brought about chiefly by \"His so  joining created nature to Himself that one Person is made up of these  three--the Word, a soul and flesh,\" as Augustine says (De Trin.  xiii). Hence it is manifest that it was fitting that God should  become incarnate.    Reply Obj. 1: The mystery of the Incarnation was not completed  through God being changed in any way from the state in which He had  been from eternity, but through His having united Himself to the  creature in a new way, or rather through having united it to Himself.  But it is fitting that a creature which by nature is mutable, should  not always be in one way. And therefore, as the creature began to be,  although it had not been before, so likewise, not having been  previously united to God in Person, it was afterwards united to Him.    Reply Obj. 2: To be united to God in unity of person was not fitting  to human flesh, according to its natural endowments, since it was  above its dignity; nevertheless, it was fitting that God, by reason  of His infinite goodness, should unite it to Himself for man's  salvation.    Reply Obj. 3: Every mode of being wherein any creature whatsoever  differs from the Creator has been established by God's wisdom, and is  ordained to God's goodness. For God, Who is uncreated, immutable, and  incorporeal, produced mutable and corporeal creatures for His own  goodness. And so also the evil of punishment was established by God's  justice for God's glory. But evil of fault is committed by  withdrawing from the art of the Divine wisdom and from the order of  the Divine goodness. And therefore it could be fitting to God to  assume a nature created, mutable, corporeal, and subject to penalty,  but it did not become Him to assume the evil of fault.    Reply Obj. 4: As Augustine replies (Ep. ad Volusian. cxxxvii): \"The  Christian doctrine nowhere holds that God was so joined to human  flesh as either to desert or lose, or to transfer and as it were,  contract within this frail body, the care of governing the universe.  This is the thought of men unable to see anything but corporeal  things . . . God is great not in mass, but in might. Hence the  greatness of His might feels no straits in narrow surroundings. Nor,  if the passing word of a man is heard at once by many, and wholly by  each, is it incredible that the abiding Word of God should be  everywhere at once?\" Hence nothing unfitting arises from God becoming  incarnate.  _______________________    SECOND ARTICLE [III, Q. 1, Art. 2]    Whether It Was Necessary for the Restoration of the Human Race That  the Word of God Should Become Incarnate?    Objection 1: It would seem that it was not necessary for the  reparation of the human race that the Word of God should become  incarnate. For since the Word of God is perfect God, as has been said  (I, Q. 4, AA. 1, 2), no power was added to Him by the assumption of  flesh. Therefore, if the incarnate Word of God restored human nature.  He could also have restored it without assuming flesh.    Obj. 2: Further, for the restoration of human nature, which had  fallen through sin, nothing more is required than that man should  satisfy for sin. Now man can satisfy, as it would seem, for sin; for  God cannot require from man more than man can do, and since He is  more inclined to be merciful than to punish, as He lays the act of  sin to man's charge, so He ought to credit him with the contrary act.  Therefore it was not necessary for the restoration of human nature  that the Word of God should become incarnate.    Obj. 3: Further, to revere God pertains especially to man's  salvation; hence it is written (Mal. 1:6): \"If, then, I be a father,  where is my honor? and if I be a master, where is my fear?\" But men  revere God the more by considering Him as elevated above all, and far  beyond man's senses, hence (Ps. 112:4) it is written: \"The Lord is  high above all nations, and His glory above the heavens\"; and farther  on: \"Who is as the Lord our God?\" which pertains to reverence.  Therefore it would seem unfitting to man's salvation that God should  be made like unto us by assuming flesh.    _On the contrary,_ What frees the human race from perdition is  necessary for the salvation of man. But the mystery of the  Incarnation is such; according to John 3:16: \"God so loved the world  as to give His only-begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him may  not perish, but may have life everlasting.\" Therefore it was  necessary for man's salvation that God should become incarnate.    _I answer that,_ A thing is said to be necessary for a certain end in  two ways. First, when the end cannot be without it; as food is  necessary for the preservation of human life. Secondly, when the end  is attained better and more conveniently, as a horse is necessary for  a journey. In the first way it was not necessary that God should  become incarnate for the restoration of human nature. For God with  His omnipotent power could have restored human nature in many other  ways. But in the second way it was necessary that God should become  incarnate for the restoration of human nature. Hence Augustine says  (De Trin. xii, 10): \"We shall also show that other ways were not  wanting to God, to Whose power all things are equally subject; but  that there was not a more fitting way of healing our misery.\"    Now this may be viewed with respect to our \"furtherance in good.\"  First, with regard to faith, which is made more certain by believing  God Himself Who speaks; hence Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xi, 2): \"In  order that man might journey more trustfully toward the truth, the  Truth itself, the Son of God, having assumed human nature,  established and founded faith.\" Secondly, with regard to hope, which  is thereby greatly strengthened; hence Augustine says (De Trin.  xiii): \"Nothing was so necessary for raising our hope as to show us  how deeply God loved us. And what could afford us a stronger proof of  this than that the Son of God should become a partner with us of  human nature?\" Thirdly, with regard to charity, which is greatly  enkindled by this; hence Augustine says (De Catech. Rudib. iv): \"What  greater cause is there of the Lord's coming than to show God's love  for us?\" And he afterwards adds: \"If we have been slow to love, at  least let us hasten to love in return.\" Fourthly, with regard to  well-doing, in which He set us an example; hence Augustine says in a  sermon (xxii de Temp.): \"Man who might be seen was not to be  followed; but God was to be followed, Who could not be seen. And  therefore God was made man, that He Who might be seen by man, and  Whom man might follow, might be shown to man.\" Fifthly, with regard  to the full participation of the Divinity, which is the true bliss of  man and end of human life; and this is bestowed upon us by Christ's  humanity; for Augustine says in a sermon (xiii de Temp.): \"God was  made man, that man might be made God.\"    So also was this useful for our _withdrawal from evil._ First,  because man is taught by it not to prefer the devil to himself, nor  to honor him who is the author of sin; hence Augustine says (De Trin.  xiii, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19953"],[0,"Origin and Development of Form and Ornament in Ceramic Art. (#2)"],[1,"of vessels so derived  may be said to have an adventitious origin, yet they are essentially  copies, although not so by design, and may as readily be placed under  the succeeding head.      +FORMS DERIVED BY IMITATION.+    Clay has no inherent qualities of a nature to impose a given form or  class of forms upon its products, as have wood, bark, bone, or stone. It  is so mobile as to be quite free to take form from surroundings, and  where extensively used will record or echo a vast deal of nature and of  coexistent art.    In this observation we have a key that will unlock many of the mysteries  of form.    In the investigation of this point it will be necessary to consider the  processes by which an art inherits or acquires the forms of another art  or of nature, and how one material imposes its peculiarities upon  another material. In early stages of culture the processes of art are  closely akin to those of nature, the human agent hardly ranking as more  than a part of the environment. The primitive artist does not proceed  by methods identical with our own. He does not deliberately and freely  examine all departments of nature or art and select for models those  things most convenient or most agreeable to fancy; neither does he  experiment with the view of inventing new forms. What he attempts  depends almost absolutely upon what happens to be suggested by preceding  forms, and so narrow and so direct are the processes of his mind that,  knowing his resources, we could closely predict his results.    The range of models in the ceramic art is at first very limited, and  includes only those utensils devoted to the particular use to which the  clay vessels are to be applied; later, closely-associated objects and  utensils are copied. In the first stages of art, when the savage makes a  weapon, he modifies or copies a weapon; when he makes a vessel, he  modifies or copies a vessel.    This law holds good in an inverse ratio to culture, varying to a certain  extent with the character of the material used.    _Natural originals_.--Natural originals, both animal and vegetable,  necessarily differ with the country and the climate, thus giving rise to  individual characters in art forms often extremely persistent and  surviving decided changes of environment.    The gourd is probably the most varied and suggestive natural vessel. We  find that the primitive potter has often copied it in the most literal  manner. One example only, out of the many available ones, is necessary.  This is from a mound in southeastern Missouri.    In Fig. 464, _a_ illustrates a common form of the gourd, while _b_  represents the imitation in clay.    [Illustration: _a_, Gourd. _b_, Clay vessel. FIG. 464.--Form  derived from a gourd.]    All nations situated upon the sea or upon large rivers use shells of  mollusks, which, without modification, make excellent receptacles for  water and food. Imitations of these are often found among the products  of the potter's art. A good example from the Mississippi Valley is shown  in Fig. 465, _a_ being the original and _b_ the copy in clay.    In Africa, and in other countries, such natural objects as cocoanut  shells, and ostrich eggs are used in like manner.    Another class of vessels, those made from the skins, bladders, and  stomachs of animals, should also be mentioned in this connection, as it  is certain that their influence has frequently been felt in the  conformation of earthen utensils.    In searching nature, therefore, for originals of primitive ceramic forms  we have little need of going outside of objects that in their natural or  slightly altered state are available for vessels.    [Illustration: _a_, Shell. _b_, Clay. FIG. 465.--Form derived  from a conch shell.]    True, other objects have been copied. We find a multitude of the higher  natural forms, both animal and vegetable, embodied in vessels of clay,  but their presence is indicative of a somewhat advanced stage of art,  when the copying of vessels that were functionally proper antecedents  had given rise to a familiarity with the use of clay and a capacity in  handling it that, with advancing culture, brought all nature within the  reach of the potter and made it assist in the processes of variation and  development.    _Artificial originals_.--There is no doubt that among most peoples art  had produced vessels in other materials antecedent to the utilization of  clay. These would be legitimate models for the potter and we may  therefore expect to find them repeated in earthenware. In this way the  art has acquired a multitude of new forms, some of which may be natural  forms at second hand, that is to say, with modifications imposed upon  them by the material in which they were first shaped. But all materials  other than clay are exceedingly intractable, and impress their own  characters so decidedly upon forms produced in them that ultimate  originals, where there are such, cannot often be traced through them.    It will be most interesting to note the influence of these peculiarities  of originals upon the ceramic art.    A nation having stone vessels, like those of California, on acquiring  the art of pottery would use the stone vessels as models, and such forms  as that given in Fig. 466 would arise, _a_ being in stone and _b_ in  clay, the former from California and the latter from Arizona.    Similar forms would just as readily come from gourds, baskets, or other  globular utensils.    Nations having wooden vessels would copy them in clay on acquiring the  art of pottery. This would give rise to a distinct group of forms, the  result primarily of the peculiarities of the woody structure. Thus in  Fig. 467, _a_, we have a form of wooden vessel, a sort of winged trough  that I have frequently found copied in clay. The earthen vessel given in  Fig. 467, _b_, was obtained from an ancient grave in Arkansas.    [Illustration: _a_, stone. _b_, clay. FIG. 466.--Form derived  from a stone pot.]    [Illustration: _a_, wood. _b_, clay. FIG. 467.--Form derived  from a wooden tray.]    [Illustration: _a_, Horn. _b_, Clay. FIG. 468.--Form derived  from a horn spoon.]    [Illustration: _a_, Bark. _b_, Clay. FIG. 469.--Form derived  from a bark vessel.]    The carapace of some species of turtles, and perhaps even the hard case  of the armadillo, could be utilized in a similar way. The shaping of a  knot of wood often gives rise to a dipper-shaped vessel, such as may be  found in use by many tribes, and is as likely an original for the dipper  form in clay as is the gourd or the conch shell; the familiar horn  vessel of the western tribes, Fig. 468, _a_, would have served equally  well. The specimen given in _b_ is from Arkansas. As a rule, however,  such vessels cannot be traced to their originals, since by copying and  recopying they have varied from the parent form, tending always toward  uniform conventional shapes.    A vessel of rectangular outline might originate in wood or bark. In Fig.  469, _a_, we have a usual form of bark tray, which is possibly the  prototype of the square-rimmed earthen vessel given in _b_.    [Illustration: _a_, Wicker. _b_, Clay. FIG. 470.--Form  originating in basketry.]    [Illustration: _a_, Wicker. _b_, Clay. FIG. 471.--Form  originating in basketry.]    [Illustration: _a_, Net. _b_, Clay. FIG. 472.--Form originating  in basketry.]    Basketry and other classes of woven vessels take a great variety of  forms and, being generally antecedent to the potter's art and constantly  present with it, have left an indelible impression upon ceramic forms.  This is traceable in the earthenware of nearly all nations. The clay  vessel is an intruder, and usurps the place and appropriates the dress  of its predecessor in wicker. The form illustrated in Fig. 470, _a_, is  a common one with the Pueblo peoples, and their earthen vessels often  resemble it very closely, as shown in _b_. Another variety is given in  Fig. 471, _a_ and _b_. These specimens are from southwestern Utah. Fig.  472, _b_, illustrates a form quite common in the Southern States, a  section in which pouch-like nets and baskets, _a_, were formerly in use  and in which the pots were often modeled.      +INVENTION OF FORM.+    In the early stages of art, forms are rarely invented outright and I  shall not stop to consider the subject here.          +MODIFICATION OF FORM.+    The acquisition of new materials, the development of new uses, the  employment of new processes of manufacture, and many other agencies lead  to the multiplication of forms through modification. The processes by  which highly differentiated forms are reached are interesting throughout  and repay the closest study.    A preliminary classification of the various causes that lead to  modification is given in the following synopsis:                         /                /                        /To assume form.                       |                |Incapacity of material--\\To retain form.                       |                |Incapacity of the artisan.                       |                |Changes in method of manufacture.                       |By adventition--|Changes in environment.                                        |Changes of use.  Modification of form--|               |Lack of use.                        |               \\Influence of new or exotic forms, etc.                        |                        |              /To enhance usefulness.                        |By intention--|                        |              \\To please fancy.--/For the beautiful.                        \\                                  \\For the grotesque.      +MODIFICATION BY ADVENTITION.+    _Incapacity of material._--It is evident at a glance that clay lacks the  capacity to assume and to retain many of the details of form found in  antecedent vessels. This necessarily results in the alteration or  omission of these features, and hence arise many modifications of  original "]]]
