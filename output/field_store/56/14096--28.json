THE TALKING BIRD, THE SINGING TREE, AND THE GOLDEN WATER      There was an emperor of Persia named Kosrouschah, who, when he first  came to his crown, in order to obtain a knowledge of affairs, took great  pleasure in night excursions, attended by a trusty minister. He often  walked in disguise through the city, and met with many adventures, one  of the most remarkable of which happened to him upon his first ramble,  which was not long after his accession to the throne of his father.    After the ceremonies of his father's funeral rites and his own  inauguration were over, the new sultan, as well from inclination as from  duty, went out one evening attended by his grand vizier, disguised like  himself, to observe what was transacting in the city. As he was passing  through a street in that part of the town inhabited only by the meaner  sort, he heard some people talking very loud; and going close to the  house whence the noise proceeded, and looking through a crack in the  door, perceived a light, and three sisters sitting on a sofa, conversing  together after supper. By what the eldest said he presently understood  the subject of their conversation was wishes: \"for,\" said she, \"since we  are talking about wishes, mine shall be to have the sultan's baker for  my husband, for then I shall eat my fill of that bread, which by way of  excellence is called the sultan's; let us see if your tastes are as good  as mine.\" \"For my part,\" replied the second sister, \"I wish I was wife  to the sultan's chief cook, for then I should eat of the most excellent  dishes; and as I am persuaded that the sultan's bread is common in the  palace, I should not want any of that; therefore you see,\" addressing  herself to her eldest sister, \"that I have a better taste than you.\" The  youngest sister, who was very beautiful, and had more charms and wit  than the two elder, spoke in her turn: \"For my part, sisters,\" said she,  \"I shall not limit my desires to such trifles, but take a higher flight;  and since we are upon wishing, I wish to be the emperor's queen-consort.  I would make him father of a prince, whose hair should be gold on one  side of his head, and silver on the other; when he cried, the tears from  his eyes should be pearls; and when he smiled, his vermilion lips should  look like a rosebud fresh-blown.\"    The three sisters' wishes, particularly that of the youngest, seemed so  singular to the sultan, that he resolved to gratify them in their  desires; but without communicating his design to his grand vizier, he  charged him only to take notice of the house, and bring the three  sisters before him the following day.    The grand vizier, in executing the emperor's orders, would but just give  the sisters time to dress themselves to appear before his majesty,  without telling them the reason. He brought them to the palace, and  presented them to the emperor, who said to them, \"Do you remember the  wishes you expressed last night, when you were all in so pleasant a  mood? Speak the truth; I must know what they were.\" At these unexpected  words of the emperor, the three sisters were much confounded. They cast  down their eyes and blushed, and the colour which rose in the cheeks of  the youngest quite captivated the emperor's heart. Modesty, and fear  lest they might have offended by their conversation, kept them silent.  The emperor, perceiving their confusion, said to encourage them, \"Fear  nothing, I did not send for you to distress you; and since I see that  without my intending it, this is the effect of the question I asked, as  I know the wish of each, I will relieve you from your fears. You,\" added  he, \"who wished to be my wife, shall have your desire this day; and  you,\" continued he, addressing himself to the two elder sisters, \"shall  also be married to my chief baker and cook.\"    As soon as the sultan had declared his pleasure, the youngest sister,  setting her elders an example, threw herself at the emperor's feet to  express her gratitude. \"Sir,\" said she, \"my wish, since it is come to  your majesty's knowledge, was expressed only in the way of conversation  and amusement. I am unworthy of the honour you do me, and supplicate  your pardon for my presumption.\" The other two sisters would have  excused themselves also, but the emperor, interrupting them, said, \"No,  no; it shall be as I have declared; the wishes of all shall be  fulfilled.\" The nuptials were all celebrated that day, as the emperor  had resolved, but in a different manner. The youngest sister's were  solemnized with all the rejoicings usual at the marriages of the  emperors of Persia; and those of the other two sisters according to the  quality and distinction of their husbands; the one as the sultan's chief  baker, and the other as head cook.    The two elder felt strongly the disproportion of their marriages to that  of their younger sister. This consideration made them far from being  content, though they were arrived at the utmost height of their late  wishes, and much beyond their hopes. They gave themselves up to an  excess of jealousy, which not only disturbed their joy, but was the  cause of great trouble and affliction to the queen-consort, their  younger sister. They had not an opportunity to communicate their  thoughts to each other on the preference the emperor had given her, but  were altogether employed in preparing themselves for the celebration of  their marriages. Some days afterward, when they had an opportunity of  seeing each other at the public baths, the eldest said to the other:  \"Well, what say you to our sister's great fortune? Is not she a fine  person to be a queen!\" \"I must own,\" said the other sister, \"I cannot  conceive what charms the emperor could discover to be so bewitched by  her. Was it a reason sufficient for him not to cast his eyes on you,  because she was somewhat younger? You were as worthy of his throne, and  in justice he ought to have preferred you.\"    \"Sister,\" said the elder, \"I should not have regretted if his majesty  had but pitched upon you; but that he should choose that little  simpleton really grieves me. But I will revenge myself; and you, I  think, are as much concerned as I; therefore, I propose that we should  contrive measures and act in concert: communicate to me what you think  the likeliest way to mortify her, while I, on my side, will inform you  what my desire of revenge shall suggest to me.\" After this wicked  agreement, the two sisters saw each other frequently, and consulted how  they might disturb and interrupt the happiness of the queen. They  proposed a great many ways, but in deliberating about the manner of  executing them, found so many difficulties that they durst not attempt  them. In the meantime, with a detestable dissimulation, they often went  together to make her visits, and every time showed her all the marks of  affection they could devise, to persuade her how overjoyed they were to  have a sister raised to so high a fortune. The queen, on her part,  constantly received them with all the demonstrations of esteem they  could expect from so near a relative. Some time after her marriage, the  expected birth of an heir gave great joy to the queen and emperor, which  was communicated to all the court, and spread throughout the empire.  Upon this news the two sisters came to pay their compliments, and  proffered their services, desiring her, if not provided with nurses, to  accept of them.    The queen said to them most obligingly: \"Sisters, I should desire  nothing more, if it were in my power to make the choice. I am, however,  obliged to you for your goodwill, but must submit to what the emperor  shall order on this occasion. Let your husbands employ their friends to  make interest, and get some courtier to ask this favour of his majesty,  and if he speaks to me about it, be assured that I shall not only  express the pleasure he does me but thank him for making choice of you.\"    The two husbands applied themselves to some courtiers, their patrons,  and begged of them to use their interest to procure their wives the  honour they aspired to. Those patrons exerted themselves so much in  their behalf that the emperor promised them to consider of the matter,  and was as good as his word; for in conversation with the queen he told  her that he thought her sisters were the most proper persons to be about  her, but would not name them before he had asked her consent. The queen,  sensible of the deference the emperor so obligingly paid her, said to  him, \"Sir, I was prepared to do as your majesty might please to command.  But since you have been so kind as to think of my sisters, I thank you  for the regard you have shown them for my sake, and therefore I shall  not dissemble that I had rather have them than strangers.\" The emperor  therefore named the queen's two sisters to be her attendants; and from  that time they went frequently to the palace, overjoyed at the  opportunity they would have of executing the detestable"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20924"],[0,"Ely Cathedral (#2)"],[1,"History and Antiquities of Ely Cathedral_, by the Rev. James  Bentham; or a more recent work, _The Architectural History of Ely  Cathedral_, by the Rev. D.J. Stewart, M.A., formerly Minor Canon of  Ely.    Christianity was first introduced into East Anglia about the end of  the sixth century, by Redwald, the grandson of Uffa, founder of that  kingdom; but it appears that little progress was made in his time,  although Ethelbert, king of Kent, is said to have founded a monastery  at Ely about A.D. 604. Eorpwald, and after him, Sigebert, sons of  Redwald, greatly promoted the cause of Christianity, and it was during  the reign of Sigebert that the truths of the Gospel spread over the  kingdom; three monasteries were founded, one at Bury St. Edmunds,  another at Burgh Castle, near Yarmouth, and a third at Soham; and the  first Bishop of East Anglia was consecrated. The pagan king of Mercia  frequently disturbed the tranquility of the kingdom, and Sigebert and  his cousin Egric (to whom Sigebert had resigned his kingdom) were both  slain in repelling an invasion. Anna met with the same fate; he was a  prince greatly esteemed for his good qualities; he married Heriswitha,  sister of St. Hilda, the foundress of Whitby Abbey, and had a numerous  family, among whom may be named Sexburga, who was married to  Ercombert, king of Kent; Withburga, who founded a nunnery at Dereham;  and AEthelryth, or, as she is more commonly called, Etheldreda, the  renowned foundress of the monastery at Ely, who was born about the  year 630, at Exning, in Suffolk, a short distance from Newmarket.    Before commencing our sketch of the life of Etheldreda, we may by way  of explanation say that what is now the Isle of Ely, was \"anciently  called _Suth Girwa_,\"[1] and is a large tract of high ground  en-compassed with fens that were formerly overflowed with water, of  which Ely is the principal place, and gives name to the whole. The  boundaries as now recognised are Lincolnshire on the north, Norfolk on  the east, Huntingdonshire and Northamptonshire on the west, and  Cambridgeshire on the south, of which county it forms the northern  portion, with a jurisdiction partially separate; within its bounds  there are, besides the city of Ely, several towns and villages, as  Wisbech, March, Chatteris, &c. and the former great waste of marsh  and fen has become, by means of drainage, a fertile corn-growing  district of great importance. Ely is believed to have taken its name  from _Elig_ in the Saxon tongue, signifying a willow; or from _Elge_  in the Latin of Bede the historian, from the abundance of eels  produced in the surrounding waters. We now continue our sketch.    [Footnote 1: Bentham's History, i. 47.]    Etheldreda, or Audrey, a princess of distinguished piety, devoted  herself to the service of God in early life, but urged by her parents,  was married to Tonbert, or Tonberet, Earldorman, or Prince of the  South Gyrvii, or Fenmen, A.D. 652, who settled upon her the whole Isle  of Ely as a dower. Three years after her marriage Tonbert died, and  left Etheldreda in sole possession, who, after a short time, committed  the care of her property to Ovin, her steward, and retired to Ely for  the purpose of religious meditation, for which it was well adapted, as  being surrounded by fens and waters it was difficult of access. She  was again solicited to enter the marriage state, and, although for  some time reluctant, she was induced by her uncle Ethelwold, then king  of East Anglia, to give her hand to Egfrid, son of Oswy, king of  Northumberland, and she afterwards became queen by the accession of  her husband to his father's kingdom. After the lapse of twelve years  she gained the permission of her husband to withdraw from his court,  and retired to the Abbey of Coldingham, where she took the veil;  thence withdrew to Ely, and repaired the old church founded by  Ethelbert, at a place called Cratendune, about a mile from the present  city, (of which place however nothing is now known); but, shortly  after, a more commodious site was chosen nearer the river, where the  foundations of her church were laid, and the monastery was commenced.    The history of this distinguished princess as related by various  writers, would be interesting and amusing, if space allowed; it is to  be found in _Bede's Ecclesiastical History_, in the _Liber Eliensis_,  a very valuable manuscript written or compiled by Thomas, a monk of  Ely, who lived in the twelfth century; and Mr. Bentham also relates it  at some length in his work;[2] but it would extend far beyond the  limits allowed in this sketch; we have, however, we hope given  sufficient to throw some light upon remarks we may make in subsequent  pages. She governed her house in such a manner as to gain the esteem  both of its members and the inhabitants of the surrounding country;  living and dying an example of piety and holiness, for we read that  \"in her last sickness, when sensible of her approaching end, she was  calm and composed, and retained her memory and understanding to the  last, and expired in the very act of her calling, in the presence of  her flock; and whilst she was instructing them how to live, by her  example also taught them how to die.\"[3] She was interred, in  accordance with her own wish, in the grave-yard of the monastery, but  after a period of sixteen years her remains were translated, with much  reverence and ceremony, to the church she had founded. The account of  this translation might interest some of our readers, but is too long  for insertion here.    [Footnote 2: Bentham's History, i. 45, &c.]    [Footnote 3: Ibid. i. 59.]    The following lines, written at an early date, picture the fen country  as a series of lakes and water-courses, (as it was until drained six  centuries after,) studded with islands, on one of which the monastery  of Ely stood, and the music of its '_nones_' or '_vespers_' sounding  soft and sweet over the solitude.         Sweetly sang the Monks at Ely,         Knuet, the king, row'd nigh:       \"Listen how the winds be bringing       From yon church a holy singing!         Row, men, nearer by.\"         Newborn sunbeams kiss the turrets         Of the minster high,       All the beauties of the morning,--       Grey at first, then golden dreaming,--         Deck the vernal sky.         Loudly sang the Monks of Ely         On that Thursday morn:       'Twas the Feast of \"God Ascended\"--       Of the wond'rous drama ended;--         God for sinners born!         Hark! \"_I will not leave you orphans,         I will not leave you long_,\"       Grand the minster music sounded       And the fen-land air resounded         With the holy song!         Sweetly sang the Monks at Ely         Knuet, the king, row'd nigh:       \"Listen to the angels bringing       Holy _thoughts_ that seem like singing!         Row yet nearer by.\"    We will now continue our narrative, briefly taking in review the  history of the monastery as it is handed down to us. About A.D. 673  Etheldreda commenced the foundation of a monastery for both sexes, and  was installed the first abbess; she gave the whole Isle of Ely to the  monastery as an endowment, and died A.D. 679. She was succeeded by her  elder sister Sexburga, then a widow, who died A.D. 699, and was buried  beside her sister in the church of the monastery. Erminilda, daughter  of Sexburga, and widow of Wulfure, king of Mercia, next succeeded; and  the fourth abbess was Werburga, daughter of Erminilda, the time of  whose death is not known. Although St. Etheldreda's monastery  continued to enjoy a regular succession of abbesses for nearly two  centuries, not a single name of its superiors is preserved; protected  by its situation in the midst of waters, it was little molested by  external troubles until A.D. 870, when it was destroyed--like that of  Peterborough--by the Danes, the monastery burnt, and the inhabitants  put to the sword.    After the destruction of the monastery a century elapsed before steps  were taken for its restoration. At length Ethelwold, then Bishop of  Winchester, who is spoken of as \"a great builder of churches and of  various other works,\" re-founded the monastery in the year 970, by the  direction of Edgar \"the peaceful,\" who then sat on the throne of  England. After some time Ethelwold arranged with the king for the  surrender of the whole district of the Isle of Ely, by way of purchase  and exchange, for the use of the monastery. The king, for certain  considerations, gave his royal charter[4] restoring the revenues,  rights, and privileges to the monastery for ever. This charter (which  was afterwards confirmed by king Edward the Confessor,) formed the  base of that temporal power given to the church and monastery of Ely  by St. Etheldreda, and exercised (with some interruption) by the  abbots and bishops down to the year 1836, when it was discontinued by  an Act of Parliament.    [Footnote 4: This Charter is given at length in the Saxon language,  with an English translation, in the Appendix to Bentham's History.]    On the re-foundation of the monastery it was placed under the  Benedictine rule, which required the separation of the sexes, whereas  under the previous order both men and women had resided in the same  establishment. Brithnoth, prior of Winchester, was instituted as the  first abbot of the restored monastery, by Ethelwold, and appears to  have been zealous in his duty; he governed the house eleven years, but  in the year 981 he met an untimely death at the instigation of  Elfrida, queen dowager of king Edgar. He was succeeded by Elsin,  Leofric, Leofsin, Wilfric, Thurstan, (the last Saxon abbot, who  surrendered the monastery to the Conqueror in 1071,) Theodwin,  Godfrey, (a monk, as Administrator _ad interim_,) and Simeon, the  ninth abbot, who was a relative of king William, and prior of  Winchester; he recovered for his monastery some of the lands which had  been given to"]]]
