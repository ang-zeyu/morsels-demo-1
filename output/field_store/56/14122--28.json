The event naturally cast a gloom over the Court;  frivolities were abandoned, and religious devotion, either genuine or  assumed in polite acquiescence with the royal humour, took the place of  the amusements which had hitherto held sway. In one case, at least, the  spirit of reformation was at work in good earnest. Rahere, repenting of  his wasted life, thereupon started on a pilgrimage to Rome, to do  penance for his sins on the ground hallowed by the martyrdom of St.  Paul, some three miles from the city. The spot known as the Three  Fountains, now rendered more or less sanitary by the free planting of  eucalyptus, was then and long afterwards particularly unhealthy, and  while there Rahere was attacked by malarial fever. In his distress he  made a vow that, if he were spared, he would establish a hospital for  the poor, as a thank-offering, on his return to England.    His prayer was granted, but his recovery was slow. During his  convalescence he had a vision, or dream, in which he thought a winged  monster had seized him in its claws, and was about to drop him into a  bottomless pit, when a majestic form came to his rescue, and thus  addressed him: \"I am Bartholomew, the Apostle of Jesus Christ, that come  to succour thee in thine anguish, and to open to thee the secret  mysteries of heaven. Know me truly, by the will and commandment of the  Holy Trinity, and the common favour of the celestial court and council,  to have chosen a place in the suburbs of London, at Smithfield, where in  my name thou shall found a church. This spiritual house Almighty God  shall inhabit, and hallow it, and glorify it. Wherefore doubt thou  nought; only give thy diligence, and my part shall be to provide  necessaries, direct, build, and end this work.\"[3] Rahere at once  promised compliance, and, as soon as he got back to London, first  obtained the King's consent, and then, \"nothing omitting of care and  diligence, two works of piety began, one for the vow that he had made,  the other as to him by precept was enjoined.\"[4]    The suburb of Smithfield (Smoothfield) is said to have already occurred  to Edward the Confessor as a suitable place for a church on the  outskirts of London, possibly as affording a similar area, in its level  and marshy surface, to that chosen for his Abbey at Westminster. The  greater part of it was, indeed, covered by water, the one dry spot  (known as \"The Elms\") being reserved for public executions, which  continued to take place there till some centuries later. The eastern  portion of this waste land was granted by Henry I, through the agency of  Richard de Belmeis, Bishop of London; and it was here that, in the year  1123, Rahere began building.[5]    In a marvellously short time the funds were forthcoming, and his double  object was achieved in the erection of the Hospital, with the Church at  a little distance, the whole being dedicated by the same friendly bishop  to St. Bartholomew the Apostle, in fulfilment of Rahere's vow and the  Saint's instructions.    Rahere is said to have been assisted in his architectural work by  Alfune, who had founded St. Giles's Church, Cripplegate, in the year  1090; and there is a story to the effect that three noble travellers, or  merchants, from Byzantium were present at the foundation, when they  foretold its future greatness, and were consulted by Rahere as to the  design and character of the building while his plans were under  consideration.    On the southern side of the church the group of buildings gradually  arose which constituted the Priory, of which the founder, having devoted  himself to the monastic life, of course became the first Prior; and here  he spent the rest of his days with thirteen companions--the sub-prior  and twelve subordinates--all living under the Rule of the Canons Regular  of St. Augustine. The number was afterwards brought up to thirty-five by  Thomas of St. Osyth, the second Prior (1144-1174), who made a  corresponding addition to the premises.[6]    In 1133, when the buildings were fairly advanced, and the value of  Rahere's work had got to be recognized, a charter of privileges was  granted by Henry I to the Prior and Canons. Commencing with an  invocation of the Holy Trinity, it was addressed to the Archbishop of  Canterbury and the Bishop of London, with a greeting to all the King's  faithful subjects, especially the citizens of London. Its comprehensive  immunities may be inferred from the opening paragraph:        Know ye that I have granted, and have by this my charter      confirmed, to the Church of St. Bartholomew of London, and to      Rahere the Prior, and to the Canons Regular, in the same church      serving God, and to the poor of the Hospital of the same church,      that they be free from all earthly servitude, and all earthly      power and subjection, except episcopal customs, to wit, only      consecration of the church, baptism, and ordination of clergy;      and that as any church in all England is free, so this church be      free, and all lands to it appertaining, which it now has, or      which Rahere the Prior, or the Canons, may be able reasonably to      acquire, whether by purchase or by gift. And it shall have socc      and sac, and thol and theme, and infogheneteof; and all      liberties and free customs and acquittances in all things which      belong to the same church in wood and in plain, in meadows and      pastures, in waters and mills, in ways and paths, in pools and      vineyards, and marshes and fisheries, and in all places now and      for ever.[7]    Another paragraph may be worth quoting, as it expressly includes  Bartholomew Fair among the privileges conveyed, though it is clear from  the terms of the instrument that a fair had previously been held in the  open space at Smithfield on the Saint's anniversary. Even before the  accession of Henry I there had been a market on the spot, known as \"the  King's Market\" when the ground was allotted to Rahere. (_Vide_ \"Vetusta  Monumenta,\" vol. ii.)        I grant also my firm peace to all persons coming to and      returning from the fair which is wont to be celebrated in that      place at the Feast of St. Bartholomew; and I forbid any one of      the royal officials to send to implead any one, or without the      consent of the Canons on those three days--to wit, the eve of      the feast, the feast itself, and the day following--to demand      customary dues from them.    The observance was afterwards extended to a double octave of fourteen  days, and included all kinds of shows and entertainments, theatrical,  conjuring, and acrobatic performances, in addition to the traffic in  cloth-stuffs, horses and cattle, which gave the fair its commercial  importance. The stalls, or booths, in which the portable goods were  exposed for sale, were held within the monastery walls, the gates of  which were locked at night, and a watch kept over the enclosure.[8]    Rahere died on 20th September, 1144, and was buried in the church, where  his tomb occupies the usual place for Founders on the north side of the  sanctuary, surrounded by his magnificent Norman work in the choir, with  the ambulatory beyond it, and extending upwards to the arcading of the  triforium. The eastern part of the clerestory is a modern reproduction  of that which superseded Rahere's; but, with this exception, the  interior of the choir was probably much the same originally as it is  (restored) to-day.    There was, however, a central tower, and, if the design on the  twelfth-century Priory seal is to be trusted, a high circular turret at  each end of the exterior.[9]    Thomas of St. Osyth, the second Prior (d. 1174), erected the transepts  and the easternmost bays of the nave, all of which bear signs of the  architectural transition. The nave was probably completed during the  next half-century, in the Early-English (then superseding the heavier  Norman) style, as may be inferred from the surviving western gateway,  and the mutilated columns which remain within the building at the  western end.    [Illustration: THE NORTH SIDE OF THE CHOIR FROM THE TRIFORIUM                 _E. Scamell. Photo._]    Perpendicular work was introduced early in the fifteenth century, when  Roger de Walden, Bishop of London (1405-1406), built a chantry-chapel to  the north-east of the choir, and inserted a new clerestory, in the then  fashionable style, in place of the original. He also made a considerable  alteration in the chancel by substituting a square east-end for the  circular apse, part of which was taken down and used as building  material for the innovation. But de Walden's work was cut short by his  death, when he had scarcely held the See of London for two years, and  was buried in his Chapel at St. Bartholomew's, instead of in the  Cathedral Church like most of his predecessors.    The Lady Chapel, with the crypt beneath it, dates from about 1410, when  also the central tower was probably rebuilt, and decorative additions  were made to the Founder's tomb, in the shape of a canopy and panelling.  In the first part of the next century Prior Bolton (1505-32) inserted  the Oriel window on the southern side of the choir-triforium and the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21528"],[0,"The International Monthly Magazine, Volume 1,  No. 1, August 1850 (#2)"],[1,"Peninsula, by John    E.
