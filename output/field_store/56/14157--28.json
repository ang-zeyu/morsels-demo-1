All he  asked was to get the car safely back to his father's garage before the  family returned from New York on the afternoon train. Now that his  excitement had cooled into sober second thought, he marveled that he had  been led into committing such a monstrous offense. He must have been  mad. Often he had begged to do the very thing he had done and his father  had always refused to let him, insisting that an expensive touring car  was no toy for a boy of his age. Perhaps there had been some truth in  the assertion, too, he now admitted. Yet were he to hang for it, he  could not see why he had not run the car exactly as his elders were wont  to do. Of course he had had a pretty big crowd aboard and the heavy load  might have strained the machinery; and possibly--just possibly--he had  speeded a bit. He certainly had made phenomenally good time for he did  not want the fellows to think he was afraid to let out the engine.    Well, whatever the matter was, the harm was done now and he was in a  most unenviable plight. No doubt it would cost a small fortune to get  the automobile into shape again, more money than he had in the world;  certainly far more than he had in his pocket at the present moment. What  was he to do? Even suppose the boys did remember to send back help  (they probably wouldn't--but suppose they did) how was he to pay a  machinist? As he pictured himself being towed to a garage and the car  being left there, he felt an uncomfortable sensation in his throat. He  certainly was in for it now.    It would be ignominious to charge the repairs to his father but that  would be the only course left him. Fortunately Mr. Tolman, who was a  railroad official, was well known in the locality and therefore there  would be no trouble about obtaining credit; but to ask his father to pay  the bills for this escapade was anything but a manly and honorable way  out and Steve wished with all his heart he had never been persuaded into  the wretched affair. If there were only some escape possible, some  alternative from being obliged to confess his wrong-doing! But to hope  to conceal or make good the disaster was futile. And even if he could  cover up what had happened, how contemptible it would be! He detested  doing anything underhanded. Only sneaks and cowards resorted to  subterfuge and although he had been called many names in his life these  two had not been among them.    No, he should make a clean breast of what he had done and bear the  consequences, and once out of his miserable plight he would take care  never again to be a party to such an adventure. He had learned his  lesson.    So absorbed was he in framing these worthy resolutions that he did not  notice a tiny moving speck that appeared above the crest of the hill and  now came whirling toward him. In fact the dusty truck and its yet more  dusty driver were beside him before he heeded either one. Then the  newcomer came to a stop and he heard a pleasant voice:    \"What's the matter, sonny?\"    Stephen glanced up, trying bravely to return his questioner's smile.    The man who addressed him was white-haired, ruddy, and muscular, and he  wore brown denim overalls stained with oil and grease; but although he  was middle-aged there was a boyish friendliness in his face and in the  frank blue eyes that peered out from under his shaggy brows.    \"What's the trouble with your machine?\" he repeated.    \"I don't know,\" returned Stephen. \"If I did, you bet I wouldn't be  sitting here.\"    The workman laughed.    \"Suppose you let me have a look at it,\" said he, climbing off the seat  on which he was perched.    \"I wish you would.\"    \"It is a pretty fine car, isn't it?\" observed the man, as he approached  it. \"Is it yours?\"    \"My father's.\"    \"He lets you use it, eh?\"    Stephen did not answer.    \"Some fathers ain't that generous,\" went on the man as he began to  examine the silent monster. \"If I had an outfit like this, I ain't so  sure I'd trust it to a chap of your size. Still, if you have your  license, I suppose you must know how to run it.\"    [Illustration: \"You've got your engine nicely warmed up, youngster,\" he  observed casually. Page 9.]    A shiver passed through Stephen's body. A license! What if the stranger  should ask to see it?    There was a heavy fine, he now remembered, for driving a car unless one  were in possession of this precious paper, although what the penalty was  he could not at the instant recall; he had entirely forgotten there were  any such legal details. Fearfully he eyed the mechanic.    The man, however, did not pursue the subject but instead appeared  engrossed in carefully inspecting the automobile inside and out. As he  poked about, now here, now there, Stephen watched him with constantly  increasing nervousness; and after the investigation had proceeded for  some little time and no satisfactory result had been reached, the boy's  heart sank. Something very serious must be the matter if the trouble  were so hard to locate, he reasoned. In imagination he heard his  father's indignant reprimands and saw the Northampton trip shrivel into  nothingness.    The workman in the meantime remained silent, offering no comment to  relieve his anxiety. What he was thinking under the shabby visor cap  pulled so low over his brows it was impossible to fathom. His hand was  now unscrewing the top of the gasoline tank.    \"You've got your engine nicely warmed up, youngster,\" observed he  casually. \"Maybe 'twas just as well you did come to a stop. You must  have covered the ground at a pretty good clip.\"    There certainly was something very disconcerting about the stranger's  conversation and again Stephen looked at him with suspicion.    \"Oh, I don't know,\" he mumbled, trying to assume an off-hand air.  \"Perhaps we did come along fairly fast.\"    \"You weren't alone then.\"    \"N--o,\" was the uncomfortable reply. \"The fellows who sent you back from  the village were with me.\"    For the first time the workman evinced surprise.    \"Nobody sent me,\" he retorted. \"I just thought as I was going by that  you looked as if you were up against it, and as I happen to know  something about engines I pulled up to give you a helping hand. The fix  you are in isn't serious, though.\" He smiled broadly as if something  amused him.    \"What is the matter with the car?\" demanded the boy desperately, in a  voice that trembled with eagerness and anxiety and defied all efforts to  remain under his control.    \"Why, son, nothing is wrong with your car. You've got no gasoline,  that's all.\"    \"Gasoline!\" repeated the lad blankly.    \"Sure! You couldn't have had much aboard when you started, I guess. It  managed to bring you as far as this, however, and here you came to a  stop. The up-grade of the hill tipped the little gas you did have back  in the tank so it would not run out, you see. Fill her up again and  she'll sprint along as nicely as ever.\"    The relief that came with the information almost bowled Steve over.    For a moment he could not speak; then when he had caught his breath he  exclaimed excitedly:    \"How can I get some gasoline?\"    His rescuer laughed at the fevered question.    \"Why, I happen to have a can of it here on my truck,\" he drawled, \"and I  can let you have part of it if you are so minded.\"    \"Oh, I don't want to take yours,\" objected the boy.    \"Nonsense! Why not? I am going right past a garage on my way back and  can get plenty more. We'll tip enough of mine into your tank to carry  you home. It won't take a minute.\"    The suggestion was like water to the thirsty.    \"All right!\" cried Stephen. \"If you will let me pay for it I shall be  mightily obliged to you. I'm mightily obliged anyway.\"    \"Pshaw! I've done nothing,\" protested the person in the oily jumper.  \"What are we in the world for if not to do one another a good turn when  we can?\"    As he spoke he extricated from his conglomerate load of lumber, tools,  and boxes a battered can, the contents of which he began to transfer  into Stephen's empty tank.    \"There!\" ejaculated he presently, as he screwed the metal top on. \"That  isn't all she'll hold, but it will at least get you home. You are going  right back, aren't you?\"    The boy glanced quickly at the speaker.    \"Yes.\"    \"That's right. I would if I were in your place,\" urged the man.    Furtively Stephen scrutinized the countenance opposite but although the  words had contained a mingled caution and rebuke there was not the  slightest trace of interest in the face of the speaker, who was  imperturbably wiping off the moist nickel cap with a handful of waste  from his pocket.    \"Yes,\" he repeated half-absently, \"I take it that amount of gas will  just about carry you back to Coventry; it won't allow for any detours,  to be sure, but if you follow the straight road it ought to fetch you up  there all right.\"    Stephen started and again an interrogation rose to his lips. Who was  this mysterious mechanic and why should he assume with such certainty  that Coventry was the abiding place of the car? He longed to ask but a  fear of lengthening the interview prevented him from doing so. If he  began to ask questions might not the stranger assume the same privilege  and wheel upon him with some embarrassing inquiry? No, the sooner he was  clear of this wizard in the brown overalls the better. But for the sake  of his peace of mind he should like to know whether the man really knew  who he was or whether his comments were simply matters of chance. There  certainly was something very uncanny and uncomfortable about it all,  something that led him to feel that the person in the jumper was fully  acquainted with his escapade, disapproved of it, and meant to prevent  him from prolonging it. Yet as he took a peep into the kindly blue eyes  which he did not trust himself to meet directly he wondered if this"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22248"],[0,"The Indian Fairy Book: From the Original Legends (#2)"],[1,"joy as he entered it, and from that moment he was one of the  happiest of men.    Winter and summer passed rapidly away, and as the spring drew near with  its balmy gales and its many-colored flowers, their happiness was  increased by the presence of a beautiful boy in their lodge. What more  of earthly blessing was there for them to enjoy?    Waupee's wife was a daughter of one of the stars; and as the scenes of  earth began to pall upon her sight, she sighed to revisit her father.  But she was obliged to hide these feelings from her husband. She  remembered the charm that would carry her up, and while White Hawk was  engaged in the chase, she took occasion to construct a wicker basket,  which she kept concealed. In the mean time, she collected such rarities  from the earth as she thought would please her father, as well as the  most dainty kinds of food.    One day when Waupee was absent, and all was in readiness, she went out  to the charmed ring, taking with her her little son. As they entered the  car she commenced her magical song, and the basket rose. The song was  sad, and of a lowly and mournful cadence, and as it was wafted far away  by the wind, it caught her husband's ear. It was a voice which he well  knew, and he instantly ran to the prairie Though he made breathless  speed, he could not reach the ring before his wife and child had  ascended beyond his reach. He lifted up his voice in loud appeals, but  they were unavailing. The basket still went up. He watched it till it  became a small speck, and finally it vanished in the sky. He then bent  his head down to the ground, and was miserable.    Through a long winter and a long summer Waupee bewailed his loss, but he  found no relief. The beautiful spirit had come and gone, and he should  see it no more!    He mourned his wife's loss sorely, but his son's still more; for the boy  had both the mother's beauty and the father's strength.    In the mean time his wife had reached her home in the stars, and in the  blissful employments of her father's house she had almost forgotten that  she had left a husband upon the earth. But her son, as he grew up,  resembled more and more his father, and every day he was restless and  anxious to visit the scene of his birth. His grandfather said to his  daughter, one day:    \"Go, my child, and take your son down to his father, and ask him to come  up and live with us. But tell him to bring along a specimen of each kind  of bird and animal he kills in the chase.\"    She accordingly took the boy and descended. The White Hawk, who was  ever near the enchanted spot, heard her voice as she came down the sky.  His heart beat with impatience as he saw her form and that of his son,  and they were soon clasped in his arms.    He heard the message of the Star, and he began to hunt with the greatest  activity, that he might collect the present with all dispatch. He spent  whole nights, as well as days, in searching for every curious and  beautiful animal and bird. He only preserved a foot, a wing, or a tail  of each.    When all was ready, Waupee visited once more each favorite spot--the  hill-top whence he had been used to see the rising sun; the stream where  he had sported as a boy; the old lodge, now looking sad and solemn,  which he was to sit in no more; and last of all, coming to the magic  circle, he gazed widely around him with tearful eyes, and, taking his  wife and child by the hand, they entered the car and were drawn up--into  a country far beyond the flight of birds, or the power of mortal eye to  pierce.    Great joy was manifested upon their arrival at the starry plains. The  Star Chief invited all his people to a feast; and when they had  assembled, he proclaimed aloud that each one might continue as he was,  an inhabitant of his own dominions, or select of the earthly gifts such  as he liked best. A very strange confusion immediately arose; not one  but sprang forward. Some chose a foot, some a wing, some a tail, and  some a claw. Those who selected tails or claws were changed into  animals, and ran off; the others assumed the form of birds, and flew  away. Waupee chose a white hawk's feather. His wife and son followed his  example, and each one became a white hawk. He spread his wings, and,  followed by his wife and son, descended with the other birds to the  earth, where he is still to be found, with the brightness of the starry  plains in his eye, and the freedom of the heavenly breezes in his  wings.          II.    THE BOY WHO SET A SNARE FOR THE SUN.      At the time when the animals reigned in the earth, they had killed all  the people but a girl and her little brother, and these two were living  in fear, in an out-of-the-way place. The boy was a perfect little pigmy,  and never grew beyond the size of a mere infant; but the girl increased  with her years, so that the task of providing food and shelter fell  wholly upon her. She went out daily to get wood for the lodge-fire, and  she took her little brother with her that no mishap might befall him;  for he was too little to leave alone. A big bird, of a mischievous  disposition, might have flown away with him. She made him a bow and  arrows, and said to him one day, \"My little brother, I will leave you  behind where I have been gathering the wood; you must hide yourself, and  you will soon see the snow-birds come and pick the worms out of the logs  which I have piled up. Shoot one of them and bring it home.\"    He obeyed her, and tried his best to kill one, but he came home  unsuccessful. His sister told him that he must not despair, but try  again the next day.    She accordingly left him at the gathering-place of the wood, and  returned to the lodge. Toward night-fall she heard his little footsteps  crackling through the snow, and he hurried in and threw down, with an  air of triumph, one of the birds which he had killed. \"My sister,\" said  he, \"I wish you to skin it, and stretch the skin, and when I have killed  more, I will have a coat made out of them.\"    \"But what shall we do with the body?\" said she; for they had always up  to that time lived upon greens and berries.    \"Cut it in two,\" he answered, \"and season our pottage with one half of  it at a time.\"    It was their first dish of game, and they relished it greatly.    The boy kept on in his efforts, and in the course of time he killed ten  birds--out of the skins of which his sister made him a little coat:  being very small, he had a very pretty coat, and a bird skin to spare.    \"Sister,\" said he, one day, as he paraded up and down before the lodge,  enjoying his new coat, and fancifying himself the greatest little fellow  in the world--as he was, for there was no other beside him--\"My sister,  are we really alone in the world, or are we playing at it? Is there  nobody else living? And, tell me, was all this great broad earth and  this huge big sky made for a little boy and girl like you and me?\"    She told him, by no means; there were many folks very unlike a harmless  girl and boy, such as they were, who lived in a certain other quarter of  the earth, who had killed off all of their kinsfolk; and that if he  would live blameless and not endanger his life, he must never go where  they were. This only served to inflame the boy's curiosity; and he soon  after took his bow and arrows and went in that direction. After walking  a long time and meeting no one, he became tired, and stretched himself  upon a high green knoll where the day's warmth had melted off the snow.    It was a charming place to lie upon, and he fell asleep; and, while  sleeping, the sun beat so hot upon him that it not only singed his  bird-skin coat, but it so shrivelled and shrunk and tightened it upon  the little boy's body, as to wake him up.    When he felt how the sun had seared and the mischief its fiery beams had  played with the coat he was so proud of, he flew into a great passion,  and berated the sun in a terrible way for a little boy no higher than a  man's knee, and he vowed fearful things against it.    \"Do not think you are too high,\" said he; \"I shall revenge myself. Oh,  sun! I will have you for a plaything yet.\"    On coming home he gave an account of his misfortune to his sister, and  bitterly bewailed the spoiling of his new coat. He would not eat--not so  much as a single berry. He lay down as one that fasts; nor did he move  nor change his manner of lying for ten full days, though his sister  strove to prevail on him to rise. At the end of ten days he turned over,  and then he lay full ten days on the other side.    When he got up he was very pale, but very resolute too. He bade his  sister make a snare, for, he informed her, that he meant to catch the  sun. She said she had nothing; but after awhile she brought forward a  deer's sinew which the father had left, and which she soon made into a  string suitable for a noose. The moment she showed it to him he was  quite wroth, and told her that would not do, and directed her to find  something else. She said she had nothing--nothing at all. At last she  thought of the bird-skin that was left over when the coat was made; and  this she wrought into a string. With this the little boy was more vexed  than before. \"The sun has had enough of my bird-skins,\" he said; \"find  something else.\" She went out of the lodge saying to herself, \"Was there  ever so obstinate a boy?\" She did not dare to answer this time that she  had nothing. Luckily she thought of her own beautiful hair, and pulling  some of it from among her locks, she quickly braided it into a cord,  and, returning, she handed it to her brother. The moment his eye fell  upon this jet black braid he was delighted. \"This will do,\" he said; and  he immediately began to run it back and forth through his hands as  swiftly as he could; and as he drew it forth, he tried its strength. He  said again, \"this will do;\" and winding it in a glossy coil about his  shoulders, he set out a little after"]]]
