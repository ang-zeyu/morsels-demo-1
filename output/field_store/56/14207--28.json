Our early history is the study of European germs  developing in an American environment. Too exclusive attention has been  paid by institutional students to the Germanic origins, too little to  the American factors. The frontier is the line of most rapid and  effective Americanization. The wilderness masters the colonist. It finds  him a European in dress, industries, tools, modes of travel, and  thought. It takes him from the railroad car and puts him in the birch  canoe. It strips off the garments of civilization and arrays him in the  hunting shirt and the moccasin. It puts him in the log cabin of the  Cherokee and Iroquois and runs an Indian palisade around him. Before  long he has gone to planting Indian corn and plowing with a sharp stick;  he shouts the war cry and takes the scalp in orthodox Indian fashion. In  short, at the frontier the environment is at first too strong for the  man. He must accept the conditions which it furnishes, or perish, and so  he fits himself into the Indian clearings and follows the Indian trails.  Little by little he transforms the wilderness, but the outcome is not  the old Europe, not simply the development of Germanic germs, any more  than the first phenomenon was a case of reversion to the Germanic mark.  The fact is, that here is a new product that is American. At first, the  frontier was the Atlantic coast. It was the frontier of Europe in a very  real sense. Moving westward, the frontier became more and more American.  As successive terminal moraines result from successive glaciations, so  each frontier leaves its traces behind it, and when it becomes a settled  area the region still partakes of the frontier characteristics. Thus the  advance of the frontier has meant a steady movement away from the  influence of Europe, a steady growth of independence on American lines.  And to study this advance, the men who grew up under these conditions,  and the political, economic, and social results of it, is to study the  really American part of our history.    In the course of the seventeenth century the frontier was advanced up  the Atlantic river courses, just beyond the \"fall line,\" and the  tidewater region became the settled area. In the first half of the  eighteenth century another advance occurred. Traders followed the  Delaware and Shawnese Indians to the Ohio as early as the end of the  first quarter of the century.[5:1] Gov. Spotswood, of Virginia, made an  expedition in 1714 across the Blue Ridge. The end of the first quarter  of the century saw the advance of the Scotch-Irish and the Palatine  Germans up the Shenandoah Valley into the western part of Virginia, and  along the Piedmont region of the Carolinas.[5:2] The Germans in New York  pushed the frontier of settlement up the Mohawk to German Flats.[5:3] In  Pennsylvania the town of Bedford indicates the line of settlement.  Settlements soon began on the New River, or the Great Kanawha, and on  the sources of the Yadkin and French Broad.[5:4] The King attempted to  arrest the advance by his proclamation of 1763,[5:5] forbidding  settlements beyond the sources of the rivers flowing into the Atlantic;  but in vain. In the period of the Revolution the frontier crossed the  Alleghanies into Kentucky and Tennessee, and the upper waters of the  Ohio were settled.[5:6] When the first census was taken in 1790, the  continuous settled area was bounded by a line which ran near the coast  of Maine, and included New England except a portion of Vermont and New  Hampshire, New York along the Hudson and up the Mohawk about  Schenectady, eastern and southern Pennsylvania, Virginia well across the  Shenandoah Valley, and the Carolinas and eastern Georgia.[6:1] Beyond  this region of continuous settlement were the small settled areas of  Kentucky and Tennessee, and the Ohio, with the mountains intervening  between them and the Atlantic area, thus giving a new and important  character to the frontier. The isolation of the region increased its  peculiarly American tendencies, and the need of transportation  facilities to connect it with the East called out important schemes of  internal improvement, which will be noted farther on. The \"West,\" as a  self-conscious section, began to evolve.    From decade to decade distinct advances of the frontier occurred. By the  census of 1820[6:2] the settled area included Ohio, southern Indiana and  Illinois, southeastern Missouri, and about one-half of Louisiana. This  settled area had surrounded Indian areas, and the management of these  tribes became an object of political concern. The frontier region of the  time lay along the Great Lakes, where Astor's American Fur Company  operated in the Indian trade,[6:3] and beyond the Mississippi, where  Indian traders extended their activity even to the Rocky Mountains;  Florida also furnished frontier conditions. The Mississippi River region  was the scene of typical frontier settlements.[7:1]    The rising steam navigation[7:2] on western waters, the opening of the  Erie Canal, and the westward extension of cotton[7:3] culture added five  frontier states to the Union in this period. Grund, writing in 1836,  declares: \"It appears then that the universal disposition of Americans  to emigrate to the western wilderness, in order to enlarge their  dominion over inanimate nature, is the actual result of an expansive  power which is inherent in them, and which by continually agitating all  classes of society is constantly throwing a large portion of the whole  population on the extreme confines of the State, in order to gain space  for its development. Hardly is a new State or Territory formed before  the same principle manifests itself again and gives rise to a further  emigration; and so is it destined to go on until a physical barrier must  finally obstruct its progress.\"[7:4]    In the middle of this century the line indicated by the present eastern  boundary of Indian Territory, Nebraska, and Kansas marked the frontier  of the Indian country.[8:1] Minnesota and Wisconsin still exhibited  frontier conditions,[8:2] but the distinctive frontier of the period is  found in California, where the gold discoveries had sent a sudden tide  of adventurous miners, and in Oregon, and the settlements in Utah.[8:3]  As the frontier had leaped over the Alleghanies, so now it skipped the  Great Plains and the Rocky Mountains; and in the same way that the  advance of the frontiersmen beyond the Alleghanies had caused the rise  of important questions of transportation and internal improvement, so  now the settlers beyond the Rocky Mountains needed means of  communication with the East, and in the furnishing of these arose the  settlement of the Great Plains and the development of still another kind  of frontier life. Railroads, fostered by land grants, sent an  increasing tide of immigrants into the Far West. The United States Army  fought a series of Indian wars in Minnesota, Dakota, and the Indian  Territory.    By 1880 the settled area had been pushed into northern Michigan,  Wisconsin, and Minnesota, along Dakota rivers, and in the Black Hills  region, and was ascending the rivers of Kansas and Nebraska. The  development of mines in Colorado had drawn isolated frontier settlements  into that region, and Montana and Idaho were receiving settlers. The  frontier was found in these mining camps and the ranches of the Great  Plains. The superintendent of the census for 1890 reports, as previously  stated, that the settlements of the West lie so scattered over the  region that there can no longer be said to be a frontier line.    In these successive frontiers we find natural boundary lines which have  served to mark and to affect the characteristics of the frontiers,  namely: the \"fall line;\" the Alleghany Mountains; the Mississippi; the  Missouri where its direction approximates north and south; the line of  the arid lands, approximately the ninety-ninth meridian; and the Rocky  Mountains. The fall line marked the frontier of the seventeenth century;  the Alleghanies that of the eighteenth; the Mississippi that of the  first quarter of the nineteenth; the Missouri that of the middle of this  century (omitting the California movement); and the belt of the Rocky  Mountains and the arid tract, the present frontier. Each was won by a  series of Indian wars.    At the Atlantic frontier one can study the germs of processes repeated  at each successive frontier. We have the complex European life sharply  precipitated by the wilderness into the simplicity of primitive  conditions. The first frontier had to meet its Indian question, its  question of the disposition of the public domain, of the means of  intercourse with older settlements, of the extension of political  organization, of religious and educational activity. And the settlement  of these and similar questions for one frontier served as a guide for  the next. The American student needs not to go to the \"prim little  townships of Sleswick\" for illustrations of the law of continuity and  development. For example, he may study the origin of our land policies  in the colonial land policy; he may see how the system grew by adapting  the statutes to the customs of the successive frontiers.[10:1] He may  see how the mining experience in the lead regions of Wisconsin,  Illinois, and Iowa was applied to the mining laws of the Sierras,[10:2]  and how our Indian policy has been a series of experimentations on  successive frontiers. Each tier of new States has found in the older  ones material for its constitutions.[10:3] Each frontier has made  similar contributions to American character, as will be discussed  farther on.    But with all these similarities there are essential differences due to  the place element and the time element. It is evident that the farming  frontier of the Mississippi Valley presents different conditions from  the mining frontier"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/230"],[0,"The Bucolics and Eclogues (#2)"],[1,"behind the sedges.    DAMOETAS                              Well, was he  Whom I had conquered still to keep the goat.  Which in the piping-match my pipe had won!  You may not know it, but the goat was mine.    MENALCAS  You out-pipe him? when had you ever pipe  Wax-welded? in the cross-ways used you not  On grating straw some miserable tune  To mangle?    DAMOETAS                 Well, then, shall we try our skill  Each against each in turn? Lest you be loth,  I pledge this heifer; every day she comes  Twice to the milking-pail, and feeds withal  Two young ones at her udder: say you now  What you will stake upon the match with me.    MENALCAS  Naught from the flock I'll venture, for at home  I have a father and a step-dame harsh,  And twice a day both reckon up the flock,  And one withal the kids. But I will stake,  Seeing you are so mad, what you yourself  Will own more priceless far- two beechen cups  By the divine art of Alcimedon  Wrought and embossed, whereon a limber vine,  Wreathed round them by the graver's facile tool,  Twines over clustering ivy-berries pale.  Two figures, one Conon, in the midst he set,  And one- how call you him, who with his wand  Marked out for all men the whole round of heaven,  That they who reap, or stoop behind the plough,  Might know their several seasons? Nor as yet  Have I set lip to them, but lay them by.    DAMOETAS  For me too wrought the same Alcimedon  A pair of cups, and round the handles wreathed  Pliant acanthus, Orpheus in the midst,  The forests following in his wake; nor yet  Have I set lip to them, but lay them by.  Matched with a heifer, who would prate of cups?    MENALCAS  You shall not balk me now; where'er you bid,  I shall be with you; only let us have  For auditor- or see, to serve our turn,  Yonder Palaemon comes! In singing-bouts  I'll see you play the challenger no more.    DAMOETAS  Out then with what you have; I shall not shrink,  Nor budge for any man: only do you,  Neighbour Palaemon, with your whole heart's skill-  For it is no slight matter-play your part.    PALAEMON  Say on then, since on the greensward we sit,  And now is burgeoning both field and tree;  Now is the forest green, and now the year  At fairest. Do you first, Damoetas, sing,  Then you, Menalcas, in alternate strain:  Alternate strains are to the Muses dear.      DAMOETAS  \"From Jove the Muse began; Jove filleth all,  Makes the earth fruitful, for my songs hath care.\"    MENALCAS  \"Me Phoebus loves; for Phoebus his own gifts,  Bays and sweet-blushing hyacinths, I keep.\"    DAMOETAS  \"Gay Galatea throws an apple at me,  Then hies to the willows, hoping to be seen.\"    MENALCAS  \"My dear Amyntas comes unasked to me;  Not Delia to my dogs is better known.\"    DAMOETAS  \"Gifts for my love I've found; mine eyes have marked  Where the wood-pigeons build their airy nests.\"    MENALCAS  \"Ten golden apples have I sent my boy,  All that I could, to-morrow as many more.\"      DAMOETAS  \"What words to me, and uttered O how oft,  Hath Galatea spoke! waft some of them,  Ye winds, I pray you, for the gods to hear.\"    MENALCAS  \"It profiteth me naught, Amyntas mine,  That in your very heart you spurn me not,  If, while you hunt the boar, I guard the nets.\"    DAMOETAS  \"Prithee, Iollas, for my birthday guest  Send me your Phyllis; when for the young crops  I slay my heifer, you yourself shall come.\"    MENALCAS  \"I am all hers; she wept to see me go,  And, lingering on the word, 'farewell' she said,  'My beautiful Iollas, fare you well.'\"    DAMOETAS  \"Fell as the wolf is to the folded flock,  Rain to ripe corn, Sirocco to the trees,  The wrath of Amaryllis is to me.\"    MENALCAS  \"As moisture to the corn, to ewes with young  Lithe willow, as arbute to the yeanling kids,  So sweet Amyntas, and none else, to me.\"    DAMOETAS  \"My Muse, although she be but country-bred,  Is loved by Pollio: O Pierian Maids,  Pray you, a heifer for your reader feed!\"     MENALCAS  \"Pollio himself too doth new verses make:  Feed ye a bull now ripe to butt with horn,  And scatter with his hooves the flying sand.\"    DAMOETAS  \"Who loves thee, Pollio, may he thither come  Where thee he joys beholding; ay, for him  Let honey flow, the thorn-bush spices bear.\"    MENALCAS  \"Who hates not Bavius, let him also love  Thy songs, O Maevius, ay, and therewithal  Yoke foxes to his car, and he-goats milk.\"    DAMOETAS  \"You, picking flowers and strawberries that grow  So near the ground, fly hence, boys, get you gone!  There's a cold adder lurking in the grass.\"    MENALCAS  \"Forbear, my sheep, to tread too near the brink;  Yon bank is ill to trust to; even now  The ram himself, see, dries his dripping fleece!\"    DAMOETAS  \"Back with the she-goats, Tityrus, grazing there  So near the river! I, when time shall serve,  Will take them all, and wash them in the pool.\"    MENALCAS  \"Boys, get your sheep together; if the heat,  As late it did, forestall us with the milk,  Vainly the dried-up udders shall we wring.\"      DAMOETAS  \"How lean my bull amid the fattening vetch!  Alack! alack! for herdsman and for herd!  It is the self-same love that wastes us both.\"    MENALCAS  \"These truly- nor is even love the cause-  Scarce have the flesh to keep their bones together  Some evil eye my lambkins hath bewitched.\"    DAMOETAS  \"Say in what clime- and you shall be withal  My great Apollo- the whole breadth of heaven  Opens no wider than three ells to view.\"    MENALCAS  \"Say in what country grow such flowers as bear  The names of kings upon their petals writ,  And you shall have fair Phyllis for your own.\"    PALAEMON  Not mine betwixt such rivals to decide:  You well deserve the heifer, so does he,  With all who either fear the sweets of love,  Or taste its bitterness. Now, boys, shut off  The sluices, for the fields have drunk their fill.          ECLOGUE IV    POLLIO    Muses of Sicily, essay we now  A somewhat loftier task! Not all men love  Coppice or lowly tamarisk: sing we woods,  Woods worthy of a Consul let them be.    Now the last age by Cumae's Sibyl sung  Has come and gone, and the majestic roll  Of circling centuries begins anew:  Justice returns, returns old Saturn's reign,  With a new breed of men sent down from heaven.  Only do thou, at the boy's birth in whom  The iron shall cease, the golden race arise,  Befriend him, chaste Lucina; 'tis thine own  Apollo reigns. And in thy consulate,  This glorious age, O Pollio, shall begin,  And the months enter on their mighty march.  Under thy guidance, whatso tracks remain  Of our old wickedness, once done away,  Shall free the earth from never-ceasing fear.  He shall receive the life of gods, and see  Heroes with gods commingling, and himself  Be seen of them, and with his father's worth  Reign o'er a world at peace. For thee, O boy,  First shall the earth, untilled, pour freely forth  Her childish gifts, the gadding ivy-spray  With foxglove and Egyptian bean-flower mixed,  And laughing-eyed acanthus. Of themselves,  Untended, will the she-goats then bring home  Their udders swollen with milk, while flocks afield  Shall of the monstrous lion have no fear.  Thy very cradle shall pour forth for thee  Caressing flowers. The serpent too shall die,  Die shall the treacherous poison-plant, and far  And wide Assyrian spices spring. But soon  As thou hast skill to read of heroes' fame,  And of thy father's deeds, and inly learn  What virtue is, the plain by slow degrees  With waving corn-crops shall to golden grow,  From the wild briar shall hang the blushing grape,  And stubborn oaks sweat honey-dew. Nathless  Yet shall there lurk within of ancient wrong  Some traces, bidding tempt the deep with ships,  Gird towns with walls, with furrows cleave the earth.  Therewith a second Tiphys shall there be,  Her hero-freight a second Argo bear;  New wars too shall arise, and once again  Some great Achilles to some Troy be sent.  Then, when the mellowing years have made thee man,  No more shall mariner sail, nor pine-tree bark  Ply traffic on the sea, but every land  Shall all things bear alike: the glebe no more  Shall feel the harrow's grip, nor vine the hook;  The sturdy ploughman shall loose yoke from steer,  Nor wool with varying colours learn to lie;  But in the meadows shall the ram himself,  Now with soft flush of purple, now with tint  Of yellow saffron, teach his fleece to shine.  While clothed in natural scarlet graze the lambs.  \"Such still, such ages weave ye, as ye run,\"  Sang to their spindles the consenting Fates  By Destiny's unalterable decree.  Assume thy greatness, for the time draws nigh,  Dear child of gods, great progeny of Jove!  See how it totters- the world's orbed might,  Earth, and wide ocean, and the vault profound,  All, see, enraptured of the coming time!  Ah! might such length of days to me be given,  And breath suffice me to rehearse thy deeds,  Nor Thracian Orpheus should out-sing me then,  Nor Linus, though his mother this, and that  His sire should aid- Orpheus Calliope,  And Linus fair Apollo. Nay, though Pan,  With Arcady for judge, my claim contest,  With Arcady for judge great Pan himself  Should own him foiled, and from the field retire.    Begin to greet thy mother with a smile,  O baby-boy! ten months of weariness  For thee she bore: O baby-boy, begin!  For him, on whom his parents have not smiled,  Gods deem not worthy of their board or bed.          ECLOGUE V    MENALCAS   MOPSUS      MENALCAS  Why, Mopsus, being both together met,  You skilled to breathe upon the slender reeds,  I to sing ditties, do we not sit down  Here where the elm-trees and the hazels blend?    MOPSUS  You are the elder, 'tis for me to bide  Your choice, Menalcas, whether now we seek  Yon shade that quivers to the changeful breeze,  Or the cave's shelter. Look you how the cave  Is with the wild vine's clusters over-laced!    MENALCAS  None but Amyntas on these hills of ours  Can vie with you.    MOPSUS                     What if he also strive  To out-sing Phoebus?"]]]
