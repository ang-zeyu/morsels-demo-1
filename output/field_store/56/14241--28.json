It not only makes \"a carpenter of a man; it  makes a man of a carpenter.\" In one sense, therefore, it is of greater  value than any other institution for the training of men and women that  we have, from Cambridge to Palo Alto. It is almost the only one of which  it may be said that it points the way to a new epoch in a large area of  our national life.    To work out the plan on paper, or at a distance--that is one thing. For  a white man to work it out--that too, is an easy thing. For a coloured  man to work it out in the South, where, in its constructive period,  he was necessarily misunderstood by his own people as well as by the  whites, and where he had to adjust it at every step to the strained race  relations--that is so very different and more difficult a thing that the  man who did it put the country under lasting obligations to him.    It was not and is not a mere educational task. Anybody could teach boys  trades and give them an elementary education. Such tasks have been done  since the beginning of civilization. But this task had to be done with  the rawest of raw material, done within the civilization of the dominant  race, and so done as not to run across race lines and social lines that  are the strongest forces in the community. It had to be done for the  benefit of the whole community. It had to be done, moreover, without  local help, in the face of the direst poverty, done by begging, and done  in spite of the ignorance of one race and the prejudice of the other.    No man living had a harder task, and a task that called for more wisdom  to do it right. The true measure of Mr. Washington's success is, then,  not his teaching the pupils of Tuskegee, nor even gaining the support of  philanthropic persons at a distance, but this--that every Southern white  man of character and of wisdom has been won to a cordial recognition  of the value of the work, even men who held and still hold to the  conviction that a mere book education for the Southern blacks under  present conditions is a positive evil. This is a demonstration of  the efficiency of the Hampton-Tuskegee idea that stands like the  demonstration of the value of democratic institutions themselves--a  demonstration made so clear in spite of the greatest odds that it is no  longer open to argument.    Consider the change that has come in twenty years in the discussion  of the Negro problem. Two or three decades ago social philosophers and  statisticians and well-meaning philanthropists were still talking and  writing about the deportation of the Negroes, or about their settlement  within some restricted area, or about their settling in all parts of the  Union, or about their decline through their neglect of their children,  or about their rapid multiplication till they should expel the whites  from the South--of every sort of nonsense under heaven. All this has  given place to the simple plan of an indefinite extension among the  neglected classes of both races of the Hampton-Tuskegee system of  training. The \"problem\" in one sense has disappeared. The future will  have for the South swift or slow development of its masses and of its  soil in proportion to the swift or slow development of this kind of  training. This change of view is a true measure of Mr. Washington's  work.    The literature of the Negro in America is colossal, from political  oratory through abolitionism to \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" and \"Cotton is  King\"--a vast mass of books which many men have read to the waste of  good years (and I among them); but the only books that I have read a  second time or ever care again to read in the whole list (most of them  by tiresome and unbalanced \"reformers\") are \"Uncle Remus\" and \"Up from  Slavery\"; for these are the great literature of the subject. One has all  the best of the past, the other foreshadows a better future; and the  men who wrote them are the only men who have written of the subject with  that perfect frankness and perfect knowledge and perfect poise whose  other name is genius.    Mr. Washington has won a world-wide fame at an early age. His story  of his own life already has the distinction of translation into more  languages, I think, than any other American book; and I suppose that  he has as large a personal acquaintance among men of influence as any  private citizen now living.    His own teaching at Tuskegee is unique. He lectures to his advanced  students on the art of right living, not out of text-books, but  straight out of life. Then he sends them into the country to visit Negro  families. Such a student will come back with a minute report of the way  in which the family that he has seen lives, what their earnings are,  what they do well and what they do ill; and he will explain how they  might live better. He constructs a definite plan for the betterment  of that particular family out of the resources that they have. Such a  student, if he be bright, will profit more by an experience like this  than he could profit by all the books on sociology and economics that  ever were written. I talked with a boy at Tuskegee who had made such a  study as this, and I could not keep from contrasting his knowledge and  enthusiasm with what I heard in a class room at a Negro university  in one of the Southern cities, which is conducted on the idea that a  college course will save the soul. Here the class was reciting a lesson  from an abstruse text-book on economics, reciting it by rote, with so  obvious a failure to assimilate it that the waste of labour was pitiful.    I asked Mr. Washington years ago what he regarded as the most important  result of his work, and he replied:    \"I do not know which to put first, the effect of Tuskegee's work on the  Negro, or the effect on the attitude of the white man to the Negro.\"    The race divergence under the system of miseducation was fast getting  wider. Under the influence of the Hampton-Tuskegee idea the races  are coming into a closer sympathy and into an honourable and helpful  relation. As the Negro becomes economically independent, he becomes a  responsible part of the Southern life; and the whites so recognize  him. And this must be so from the nature of things. There is nothing  artificial about it. It is development in a perfectly natural way. And  the Southern whites not only so recognize it, but they are imitating it  in the teaching of the neglected masses of their own race. It has thus  come about that the school is taking a more direct and helpful hold on  life in the South than anywhere else in the country. Education is not  a thing apart from life--not a \"system,\" nor a philosophy; it is direct  teaching how to live and how to work.    To say that Mr. Washington has won the gratitude of all thoughtful  Southern white men, is to say that he has worked with the highest  practical wisdom at a large constructive task; for no plan for the  up-building of the freedman could succeed that ran counter to Southern  opinion. To win the support of Southern opinion and to shape it was a  necessary part of the task; and in this he has so well succeeded that  the South has a sincere and high regard for him. He once said to me that  he recalled the day, and remembered it thankfully, when he grew large  enough to regard a Southern white man as he regarded a Northern one. It  is well for our common country that the day is come when he and his work  are regarded as highly in the South as in any other part of the Union. I  think that no man of our generation has a more noteworthy achievement to  his credit than this; and it is an achievement of moral earnestness of  the strong character of a man who has done a great national service.    Walter H. Page.          UP FROM SLAVERY        Chapter I. A Slave Among Slaves    I was born a slave on a plantation in Franklin County, Virginia. I am  not quite sure of the exact place or exact date of my birth, but at  any rate I suspect I must have been born somewhere and at some time.  As nearly as I have been able to learn, I was born near a cross-roads  post-office called Hale's Ford, and the year was 1858 or 1859. I do not  know the month or the day. The earliest impressions I can now recall are  of the plantation and the slave quarters--the latter being the part of  the plantation where the slaves had their cabins.    My life had its beginning in the midst of the most miserable, desolate,  and discouraging surroundings. This was so, however, not because my  owners were especially cruel, for they were not, as compared with many  others. I was born in a typical log cabin, about fourteen by sixteen  feet square. In this cabin I lived with my mother and a brother and  sister till after the Civil War, when we were all declared free.    Of my ancestry I know almost nothing. In the slave quarters, and even  later, I heard whispered conversations among the coloured people of  the tortures which the slaves, including, no doubt, my ancestors on my  mother's side, suffered in the middle passage of the slave ship while  being conveyed from Africa to America. I have been unsuccessful in  securing any information that would throw any accurate light upon  the history of my family beyond my mother. She, I remember, had a  half-brother and a half-sister. In the days of slavery not very much  attention was given to family history and family records--that is,  black family records. My mother, I suppose, attracted the attention of a  purchaser who was afterward my owner and hers. Her addition to the slave  family attracted about as much attention as the purchase of a new horse  or cow. Of my father I know even less than of my mother. I do not even  know his name. I have heard reports to the effect that he was a white  man who lived on one of the near-by plantations. Whoever he was, I never  heard of his taking the least interest in me"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23770"],[0,"Mission Furniture: How to Make It, Part 1 (#2)"],[1,"are pierced in  them as suggested in the \"layout.\" This piercing is done by driving the  point of a nail through the metal from the under side before the parts  are soldered or riveted together. If the parts are to be riveted, enough  additional metal must be left on the last panel to allow for a lap. No  lap is needed when joints are soldered.    A better way, and one which will permit the use of heavier metal, is to  cut each side of the shade separately and fasten them together by  riveting a piece of metal over each joint. The shape of this piece can  be made so as to accentuate the rivet heads and thus give a pleasing  effect.    For art-glass the metal panels are cut out, the glass is inserted from  the under side and held in place by small clips soldered to the frame of  the shade.    Pleasing effects are obtained by using one kind of metal, as brass, and  reinforcing and riveting with another metal, such as copper.    [Illustration: Details of Home-Made Porch Seat]          HOW TO MAKE A PORCH CHAIR      The illustration shows a very comfortable and attractive porch chair  that can be made with few tools and easily procured material. Most any  kind of wood will answer, says the American Carpenter and Builder, but  if open grained wood, such as oak or chestnut, is used, the parts should  be filled with a paste filler. If the natural color of the wood is not  desired, the wood may first be stained, the filler being colored  somewhat darker than the stain.    Procure enough lumber to make all the pieces shown in the detail drawing  and finish to the dimensions shown, being careful to make the  corresponding pieces exactly alike in order to preserve the perfect  symmetry which is necessary in work of this kind. In boring the holes  care must be taken to keep both edges of the holes sharp and clean. The  holes should each be bored until the spur shows; the bit should then be  withdrawn and the rest of the boring be done from the other side. The  semicircular notches are made by placing the two pieces edge to edge in  the vise and placing the spur of the bit in the crack. The 1-in. bit is  used. As it will be difficult to finish the boring of these blocks from  the second side, the parts remaining may be cut out with the knife after  the pieces have been separated.    Five 1/2-in. dowel rods are needed. It is possible to get these in one  long piece if you happen to live near a mill and then all you will have  to do is to saw off the desired lengths. However, if they cannot be got  easily you can make your own. Two rods each 18-1/4 in. long; two rods  each 20-1/4 in. and one rod 22-1/4 in. give the exact lengths. It is  well to cut each piece a little longer than required so that the ends  which are imperfectly formed may be cut off. These rods should fit tight  and may be fastened in addition with a small screw or nail from the  under or back side.    [Illustration: Porch Chair Finished]    The hand rests should be nailed to the arms with small nails or brads  before the arms are bolted. The illustration of the assembled chair  shows the relative position.    The bolts should be 1/4 in. and of the following lengths: 4 bolts 2-1/4  in. long; 2 bolts 2 in. long; 2 bolts 3 in. long. Washers should be  placed between adjacent pieces of wood fastened together with bolts and  also at both ends of the bolts. This will require 26 washers in all.  While the size of the chair may be varied, it will be necessary to keep  the proportions if the parts are to fold properly.          HOW TO MAKE A TABOURET      Secure from the planing mill the following pieces and have them planed  and sandpapered on two surfaces: For the top, one piece 7/8 in. thick  and 17 in. square. For the legs, four pieces 7/8 in. thick, 4-3/4 in.  wide and 18-1/2 in. long. For the lower stretchers, two pieces 7/8 in.  thick, 2-3/4 in. wide and 15-3/4 in. long. For the top stretchers, two  pieces 7/8 in. thick, 2-1/4 in. wide and 13-1/4 in. long. No stock need  be ordered for the keys, as they can be made out of the waste pieces  remaining after the legs are shaped.    Begin work on the four legs first. While both sides of each leg slope,  it will be necessary to plane a joint edge on each leg from which to lay  out the mortises, grooves and to test the ends. It will be necessary to  have a bevel square to use in marking off the slopes and for testing  them. To get the setting for the bevel square, make a full sized \"lay  out\" or drawing of the necessary lines in their proper relation to one  another and adjust the bevel to those lines.    From the joint edge lay out the mortises, grooves and the slopes of  sides and ends of the legs. Cut the mortises and grooves first, then  shape up the sides. Saw the sides accurately and quite close to the  lines, finishing with the steel cabinet scraper.    [Illustration: Details of Tabouret]    Next make the bottom stretchers. In laying out the cross lap joint, the  working faces are both to be up when the joint is completed, therefore  lay off one groove on the face of one piece and on the side opposite the  face on the other. In gauging for depth, however, be careful to keep the  gauge block against the working face of each piece.    In laying out the mortises for the keys, the opening on the top surface  is to be made 1/8 in. longer than on the under surface. The slope of  the key will therefore be 1/8 in. of slope to each 7/8 in. of length.  The drawing shows the mortise as 7/8 in. from the shoulders of the  tenon. This distance is the same as the thickness of the leg and to  insure the key's pulling the shoulder up against the leg firmly, should  any of the legs happen to be a little less than 7/8 in., it is well to  make the mortise slightly nearer the shoulder than 7/8 in.    It is a good plan to lay out the mortise in the tenon at the same time  the shoulders of the tenons are laid out. Otherwise the joint edge being  cut off in making the tenon there is no convenient way to locate this  mortise accurately.    Lay off the top stretchers according to the dimensions shown in the  drawing. Observe the same precautions about the cross lap joint as were  given for the lower stretchers, except that the joint edges are to be  placed up in this latter case. Make sure the grooves are laid out in the  middle before cutting. As a test, place the pieces side by side, examine  the markings, then turn one of them end for end and again examine.    The grooves into which the legs pass are 1/8 in. deep and must be very  carefully cut. Their purpose is to give rigidity to the tabouret frame.  Bore two holes in each stretcher for the screws that are to fasten the  top in place.    Make the keys, scrape all the parts and sandpaper those that were not so  treated at the mill. Use glue to fasten the tops of the legs to the top  stretchers and assemble these parts.    The top is octagonal or eight-sided. To make it, square up a piece to  16-1/2 by 16-1/2 in. Measure the diagonal, take one-half of it and  measure from each corner of the board each way along the edges to locate  the places at which to cut off the corners. Connect these points, saw  and plane the remaining four sides. There is to be a 5/8-in. bevel on  the under side of the top. Scrape and sandpaper these edges and secure  the top to the stretchers with screws.    [Illustration: Tabouret as Completed]    Much time can be saved and a better result obtained if the wood  finishing is done before the parts are put together. Especially is this  true if stain and filler are used.    A very pretty finish and one easily put on even after the parts are put  together is obtained as follows: Take a barrel and stuff up the cracks  or paste paper over them so as to make it as near airtight as possible.  In some out-of-the-way place put a dish with about 2 oz. of strong  ammonia. Set the tabouret over this dish and quickly invert the barrel  over the tabouret. Allow the fumes to act on the wood for at least 15  hours. Remove the barrel and allow the fumes to escape. Polish with  several coats of wax such as is used upon floors. Directions for waxing  will be found on the cans that contain the wax.. This produces the rich  nut-brown finish so popular in Arts and Crafts furniture and is known as  fumed oak.          HOW TO MAKE A MORRIS CHAIR      The stock necessary to make a morris chair of craftsman design as shown  in the engraving can be purchased mill-planed and sandpapered on four  sides as given in the following list:      4 posts 1-3/4 by 3 by 26 in.    2 front and back rails 7/8 by 5-1/2 by 24 in.    2 side rails 7/8 by 5-1/2 by 28 in.    2 arm pieces 7/8 by 5-1/2 by 37 in.    7 slats 3/8 by 2 by 24 in.    2 cleats 1 by 1 by 22-1/2 in.    2 back stiles 1 by 2-1/2 by 24-1/2 in.    2 back rails 1 by 2 by 17 in.    3 back slats 3/8 by 1-1/2 by 19 in.    1 back support 3/4 by 3/4 by 24 in.    2 support rests 1 by 1-1/2 by 8-1/2 in.    2 dowels 1/2 in. diameter, 6 in. long.    First make and put together the sides of the chair. While the glue is  setting on these parts make and assemble the back. The front and back  rails may next be made and placed and the cleats and bottom slats  fastened. With the adjustment of the back the chair is ready for the  finish.    The posts are to be tenoned on the upper ends. These tenons are to  project 3/16 in. above the arm and should be slightly beveled. The lower  ends of the posts, likewise, all other projecting ends, should be  beveled to avoid their splintering. All sharp corners, as on the arms,  should be sandpapered just enough to take their sharpness off, so as not  to injure the hand.    That the chair may be properly inclined, the rear posts are cut 1 in.  shorter than the forward ones. To get the correct slant on the bottoms  of these posts, lay a straightedge so that its edge touches the bottom  of the front post at its front surface, but keep it 1 in. above the  bottom of the rear post.
