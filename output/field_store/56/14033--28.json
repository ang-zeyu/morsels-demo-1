[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19980"],[0,"A Joy For Ever (and Its Price in the Market) (#2)"],[1,"with mocking at rich people, and  constructing merry dialogues between Charon and Diogenes or Menippus, in  which the ferryman and the cynic rejoiced together as they saw kings and  rich men coming down to the shore of Acheron, in lamenting and  lamentable crowds, casting their crowns into the dark waters, and  searching, sometimes in vain, for the last coin out of all their  treasures that could ever be of use to them.      4. But these Pagan views of the matter were indulgent, compared with  those which were held in the Middle Ages, when wealth seems to have been  looked upon by the best men not only as contemptible, but as criminal.  The purse round the neck is, then, one of the principal signs of  condemnation in the pictured Inferno; and the Spirit of Poverty is  reverenced with subjection of heart, and faithfulness of affection, like  that of a loyal knight for his lady, or a loyal subject for his queen.  And truly, it requires some boldness to quit ourselves of these  feelings, and to confess their partiality or their error, which,  nevertheless, we are certainly bound to do. For wealth is simply one of  the greatest powers which can be entrusted to human hands: a power, not  indeed to be envied, because it seldom makes us happy; but still less to  be abdicated or despised; while, in these days, and in this country, it  has become a power all the more notable, in that the possessions of a  rich man are not represented, as they used to be, by wedges of gold or  coffers of jewels, but by masses of men variously employed, over whose  bodies and minds the wealth, according to its direction, exercises  harmful or helpful influence, and becomes, in that alternative, Mammon  either of Unrighteousness or of Righteousness.      5. Now, it seemed to me that since, in the name you have given to this  great gathering of British pictures, you recognize them as  Treasures--that is, I suppose, as part and parcel of the real wealth of  the country--you might not be uninterested in tracing certain commercial  questions connected with this particular form of wealth. Most persons  express themselves as surprised at its quantity; not having known before  to what an extent good art had been accumulated in England: and it will,  therefore, I should think, be held a worthy subject of consideration,  what are the political interests involved in such accumulations, what  kind of labour they represent, and how this labour may in general be  applied and economized, so as to produce the richest results.      6. Now, you must have patience with me, if in approaching the specialty  of this subject, I dwell a little on certain points of general political  science already known or established: for though thus, as I believe,  established, some which I shall have occasion to rest arguments on are  not yet by any means universally accepted; and therefore, though I will  not lose time in any detailed defence of them, it is necessary that I  should distinctly tell you in what form I receive, and wish to argue  from them; and this the more, because there may perhaps be a part of my  audience who have not interested themselves in political economy, as it  bears on ordinary fields of labour, but may yet wish to hear in what way  its principles can be applied to Art. I shall, therefore, take leave to  trespass on your patience with a few elementary statements in the  outset, and with the expression of some general principles, here and  there, in the course of our particular inquiry.      7. To begin, then, with one of these necessary truisms: all economy,  whether of states, households, or individuals, may be defined to be the  art of managing labour. The world is so regulated by the laws of  Providence, that a man's labour, well applied, is always amply  sufficient to provide him during his life with all things needful to  him, and not only with those, but with many pleasant objects of luxury;  and yet farther, to procure him large intervals of healthful rest and  serviceable leisure. And a nation's labour, well applied, is, in like  manner, amply sufficient to provide its whole population with good food  and comfortable habitation; and not with those only, but with good  education besides, and objects of luxury, art treasures, such as these  you have around you now. But by those same laws of Nature and  Providence, if the labour of the nation or of the individual be  misapplied, and much more if it be insufficient,--if the nation or man  be indolent and unwise,--suffering and want result, exactly in  proportion to the indolence and improvidence--to the refusal of labour,  or to the misapplication of it. Wherever you see want, or misery, or  degradation, in this world about you, there, be sure, either industry  has been wanting, or industry has been in error. It is not accident, it  is not Heaven-commanded calamity, it is not the original and inevitable  evil of man's nature, which fill your streets with lamentation, and your  graves with prey. It is only that, when there should have been  providence, there has been waste; when there should have been labour,  there has been lasciviousness; and wilfulness, when there should have  been subordination.[1]    [Note 1: Proverbs xiii. 23: \"Much food is in the tillage of the  poor, but there is that is destroyed for want of judgment.\"]    8. Now, we have warped the word \"economy\" in our English language into a  meaning which it has no business whatever to bear. In our use of it, it  constantly signifies merely sparing or saving; economy of money means  saving money--economy of time, sparing time, and so on. But that is a  wholly barbarous use of the word--barbarous in a double sense, for it is  not English, and it is bad Greek; barbarous in a treble sense, for it is  not English, it is bad Greek, and it is worse sense. Economy no more  means saving money than it means spending money. It means, the  administration of a house; its stewardship; spending or saving, that is,  whether money or time, or anything else, to the best possible advantage.  In the simplest and clearest definition of it, economy, whether public  or private, means the wise management of labour; and it means this  mainly in three senses: namely, first, _applying_ your labour  rationally; secondly, _preserving_ its produce carefully; lastly,  _distributing_ its produce seasonably.      9. I say first, applying your labour rationally; that is, so as to  obtain the most precious things you can, and the most lasting things, by  it: not growing oats in land where you can grow wheat, nor putting fine  embroidery on a stuff that will not wear. Secondly, preserving its  produce carefully; that is to say, laying up your wheat wisely in  storehouses for the time of famine, and keeping your embroidery  watchfully from the moth: and lastly, distributing its produce  seasonably; that is to say, being able to carry your corn at once to the  place where the people are hungry, and your embroideries to the places  where they are gay; so fulfilling in all ways the Wise Man's  description, whether of the queenly housewife or queenly nation: \"She  riseth while it is yet night, and giveth meat to her household, and a  portion to her maidens. She maketh herself coverings of tapestry, her  clothing is silk and purple. Strength and honour are in her clothing,  and she shall rejoice in time to come.\"      10. Now, you will observe that in this description of the perfect  economist, or mistress of a household, there is a studied expression of  the balanced division of her care between the two great objects of  utility and splendour: in her right hand, food and flax, for life and  clothing; in her left hand, the purple and the needlework, for honour  and for beauty. All perfect housewifery or national economy is known by  these two divisions; wherever either is wanting, the economy is  imperfect. If the motive of pomp prevails, and the care of the national  economist is directed only to the accumulation of gold, and of pictures,  and of silk and marble, you know at once that the time must soon come  when all these treasures shall be scattered and blasted in national  ruin. If, on the contrary, the element of utility prevails, and the  nation disdains to occupy itself in any wise with the arts of beauty or  delight, not only a certain quantity of its energy calculated for  exercise in those arts alone must be entirely wasted, which is bad  economy, but also the passions connected with the utilities of property  become morbidly strong, and a mean lust of accumulation merely for the  sake of accumulation, or even of labour merely for the sake of labour,  will banish at last the serenity and the morality of life, as  completely, and perhaps more ignobly, than even the lavishness of pride,  and the likeness of pleasure. And similarly, and much more visibly, in  private and household economy, you may judge always of its perfectness  by its fair balance between the use and the pleasure of its possessions.  You will see the wise cottager's garden trimly divided between its  well-set vegetables, and its fragrant flowers; you will see the good  housewife taking pride in her pretty table-cloth, and her glittering  shelves, no less than in her well-dressed dish, and her full storeroom;  the care in her countenance will alternate with gaiety, and though you  will reverence her in her seriousness, you will know her best by her  smile.      11. Now, as you will have anticipated, I am going to address you, on  this and our succeeding evening, chiefly on the subject of that economy  which relates rather to the garden than the farm-yard. I shall ask you  to consider with me the kind of laws by which we shall best distribute  the beds of our national garden, and raise in it the sweetest succession  of trees pleasant to the sight, and (in no forbidden sense) to be  desired to make us wise. But, before proceeding to open this specialty  of our subject, let me pause for a few "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19998"],[0,"Rural Architecture (#2)"],[1,"Arrangement, and Main Floor Plan,                  293    Underground Plan, and Yard,                                 295  DESIGN II.

This work owes its appearance to the absence of any cheap and popular  book on the subject of Rural Architecture, exclusively intended for the  farming or agricultural interest of the United States. Why it is, that  nothing of the kind has been heretofore attempted for the chief benefit  of so large and important a class of our community as our farmers  comprise, is not easy to say, unless it be that they themselves have  indicated but little wish for instruction in a branch of domestic  economy which is, in reality, one of great importance, not only to their  domestic enjoyment, but their pecuniary welfare. It is, too, perhaps,  among the category of neglects, and in the lack of fidelity to their own  interests which pervades the agricultural community of this country,  beyond those of any other profession--for we insist that agriculture,  in its true and extended sense, is as much a profession as any other  pursuit whatever. To the reality of such neglects they have but of late  awaked, and indeed are now far too slowly wheeling into line for more  active progress in the knowledge pertaining to their own advancement. As  an accessory to their labors in such advancement, the present work is  intended.    It is an opinion far too prevalent among those engaged in the more  active occupations of our people,--fortified indeed in such opinion,  by the too frequent example of the farmer himself--that everything  connected with agriculture and agricultural life is of a rustic and  uncouth character; that it is a profession in which ignorance, as they  understand the term, is entirely consistent, and one with which no  aspirations of a high or an elevated character should, or at least need  be connected. It is a reflection upon the integrity of the great  agricultural interest of the country, that any such opinion should  prevail; and discreditable to that interest, that its condition or  example should for a moment justify, or even tolerate it.    Without going into any extended course of remark, we shall find ample  reason for the indifference which has prevailed among our rural  population, on the subject of their own domestic architecture, in the  absence of familiar and practical works on the subject, by such as have  given any considerable degree of thought to it; and, what little thought  has been devoted to this branch of building, has been incidentally  rather than directly thrown off by those professionally engaged in the  finer architectural studies appertaining to luxury and taste, instead of  the every-day wants of a strictly agricultural population, and, of  consequence, understanding but imperfectly the wants and conveniences of  the farm house in its connection with the every-day labors and  necessities of farm life.    It is not intended, in these remarks, to depreciate the efforts of those  who have attempted to instruct our farmers in this interesting branch of  agricultural economy. We owe them a debt of gratitude for what they have  accomplished in the introduction of their designs to our notice; and  when it is remarked that they are insufficient for the purposes  intended, it may be also taken as an admission of our own neglect, that  we have so far disregarded the subject ourselves, as to force upon  others the duty of essaying to instruct us in a work of which we  ourselves should long ago have been the masters.    Why should a farmer, because he _is_ a farmer, only occupy an uncouth,  outlandish house, any more than a professional man, a merchant, or a  mechanic? Is it because he himself is so uncouth and outlandish in his  thoughts and manners, that he deserves no better? Is it because his  occupation is degrading, his intellect ignorant, his position in life  low, and his associations debasing? Surely not. Yet, in many of the  plans and designs got up for his accommodation, in the books and  publications of the day, all due convenience, to say nothing of the  respectability or the elegance of domestic life, is as entirely  disregarded as if such qualities had no connection with the farmer or  his occupation. We hold, that although many of the practical operations  of the farm may be rough, laborious, and untidy, yet they are not, and  need not be inconsistent with the knowledge and practice of neatness,  order, and even elegance and refinement within doors; and, that the due  accommodation of the various things appertaining to farm stock, farm  labor, and farm life, should have a tendency to elevate the social  position, the associations, thoughts, and entire condition of the  farmer. As the man himself--no matter what his occupation--be lodged and  fed, so influenced, in a degree, will be his practice in the daily  duties of his life. A squalid, miserable tenement, with which they who  inhabit it are content, can lead to no elevation of character, no  improvement in condition, either social or moral, of its occupants. But,  the family comfortably and tidily, although humbly provided in their  habitation and domestic arrangements, have usually a corresponding  character in their personal relations. A log cabin, even,--and I speak  of this primitive American structure with profound affection and regard,  as the shelter from which we have achieved the most of our prodigious  and rapid agricultural conquests,--may be so constructed as to speak an  air of neatness, intelligence, and even refinement in those who inhabit  it.    Admitting, then, without further argument, that well conditioned  household accommodations are as important to the farmer, even to the  indulgence of luxury itself, when it can be afforded, as for those who  occupy other and more active pursuits, it is quite important that he be  equally well instructed in the art of planning and arranging these  accommodations, and in designing, also, the various other structures  which are necessary to his wants in their fullest extent. As a question  of economy, both in saving and accumulating, good and sufficient  buildings are of the first consequence, in a pecuniary light, and when  to this are added other considerations touching our social enjoyment,  our advancement in temporal condition, our associations, our position  and influence in life, and, not least, the decided item of national good  taste which the introduction of good buildings throughout our extended  agricultural country will give, we find abundant cause for effort in  improvement.    It is not intended in our remarks to convey the impression that we  Americans, as a people, are destitute of comfortable, and, in many  cases, quite convenient household and farm arrangements. Numerous  farmeries in every section of the United States, particularly in the  older ones, demonstrate most fully, that where our farmers have taken  the trouble to _think_ on the subject, their ingenuity has been equal,  in the items of convenient and economical arrangement of their dwellings  and out-buildings, to their demands. But, we are forced to say, that  such buildings have been executed, in most cases, with great neglect of  _architectural_ system, taste, or effect; and, in many instances, to the  utter violation of all _propriety_ in appearance, or character, as  appertaining to the uses for which they are applied.    The character of the farm should be carried out so as to _express_  itself in everything"]]]
