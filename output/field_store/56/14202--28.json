A description of the church thus destroyed is given by Prof. Willis, who  quotes all the ancient writers who mention it. The chief authority is  Eadmer, who was a boy at the monastery school when the Saxon church was  pulled down, and was afterwards a monk and \"singer\" in the cathedral. It  is he who tells us that it was arranged in some parts in imitation of the  church of St. Peter at Rome. Odo had translated the body of Wilfrid,  Archbishop of York, from Ripon to Canterbury, and had \"worthily placed it  in a more lofty receptacle, to use his own words, that is to say, in the  great Altar which was constructed of rough stones and mortar, close to the  wall at the eastern part of the presbytery. Afterwards another altar was  placed at a convenient distance before the aforesaid altar.... In this  altar the blessed Elphege had solemnly deposited the head of St. Swithin  ... and also many relics of other saints. To reach these altars, a certain  crypt which the Romans call a Confessionary had to be ascended by means of  several steps from the choir of the singers. This crypt was fabricated  beneath in the likeness of the confessionary of St. Peter, the vault of  which was raised so high that the part above could only be reached by many  steps.\" The resting-place of St. Dunstan was separated from the crypt  itself by a strong wall, for that most holy father was interred before the  aforesaid steps at a great depth in the ground, and at the head of the  saint stood the matutinal altar. Thence the choir of the singers was  extended westward into the body of the church.... In the next place,  beyond the middle of the length of the body there were two towers which  projected beyond the aisles of the church. The south tower had an altar in  the midst of it, which was dedicated in honour of the blessed Pope  Gregory.... Opposite to this tower and on the north, the other tower was  built in honour of the blessed Martin, and had about it cloisters for the  use of the monks.... The extremity of the church was adorned by the  oratory of Mary.... At its eastern part, there was an altar consecrated to  the worship of that Lady.... When the priest performed the Divine  mysteries at this altar he had his face turned to the east.... Behind him,  to the west, was the pontifical chair constructed with handsome  workmanship, and of large stones and cement, and far removed from the  Lord's table, being contiguous to the wall of the church which embraced  the entire area of the building.    Lanfranc, the first Norman archbishop, was granted the see in 1070. He  quickly set about the task of building himself a cathedral. Making no  attempt to restore the old fabric, he even destroyed what was left of  the monastic building, and built up an entirely new church and monastery.  Seven years sufficed to complete his cathedral, which stood on the same  ground as the earlier fane. His work, however, was not long left  undisturbed. It had not stood for twenty years before the east end of the  church was pulled down during the Archiepiscopate of Anselm, and rebuilt  in a much more splendid style by Ernulph, the prior of the monastery.  Conrad, who succeeded Ernulph as prior, finished the choir, decorating it  with great magnificence, and, in the course of his reconstruction, nearly  doubling the area of the building. Thus completed anew, the cathedral was  dedicated by Archbishop William in A.D. 1130. At this notable ceremony the  kings of England and Scotland both assisted, as well as all the English  bishops. Forty years later this church was the scene of Thomas a Becket's  murder (A.D. 1170), and it was in Conrad's choir that the monks watched  over his body during the night after his death.    Eadmer also gives some description of the church raised by Lanfranc. The  new archbishop, \"filled with consternation\" when he found that \"the church  of the Saviour which he undertakes to rule was reduced to almost nothing  by fire and ruin,\" proceeded to \"set about to destroy it utterly, and  erect a more noble one. And in the space of seven years he raised this new  church from the very foundations and rendered it nearly perfect....  Archbishop Anselm, who succeeded Lanfranc, appointed Ernulf to be  prior.... Having taken down the eastern part of the church which Lanfranc  had built, he erected it so much more magnificently, that nothing like it  could be seen in England, either for the brilliancy of its glass windows,  the beauty of its marble pavement, or the many coloured pictures which led  the wondering eyes to the very summit of the ceiling.\" It was this part of  the church, however, that was completed by Ernulf's successor, Conrad, and  afterwards known as Conrad's choir. It appears that Anselm \"allowed the  monks to manage their own affairs, and gave them for priors Ernulf, and  then Conrad, both monks of their own monastery. And thus it happened that,  in addition to the general prosperity and good order of their property,  which resulted from this freedom, they were enabled to enlarge their  church by all that part which stretches from the great tower to the east;  which work Anselm himself provided for,\" having \"granted to the said  church the revenues of his town of Peckham, for seven years, the whole of  which were expended upon the new work.\" Prof. Willis, unable to account  for the haste with which the east end of Lanfranc's church was pulled  down, assumes that the monks \"did not think their church large enough for  the importance of their monastery,\" and moreover wanted shrine-room for  the display of relics. The main body of Lanfranc's church was left  standing, and is described as follows by Gervase. \"The tower, raised upon  great pillars, is placed in the midst of the church, like the centre in  the middle of a circle. It had on its apex a gilt cherub. On the west of  the tower is the nave of the church, supported on either side upon eight  pillars. Two lofty towers with gilded pinnacles terminate this nave or  aula. A gilded _corona_ hangs in the midst of the church. A screen with a  loft (_pulpitum_) separated in a manner the aforesaid tower from the nave,  and had in the middle and on the side towards the nave, the altar of the  holy cross. Above the _pulpitum_ and placed across the church, was the  beam, which sustained a great cross, two cherubim, and the images of St.  Mary and St. John the Apostle.... The great tower had a cross from each  side, to wit, a south cross and a north cross, each of which had in the  midst a strong pillar; this pillar sustained a vault which proceeded from  the walls on three of its sides,\" etc. Prof. Willis considers that as far  as these parts of the building are concerned, the present fabric stands  exactly on the site of Lanfranc's. \"In the existing building,\" he says,  \"it happens that the nave and transepts have been transformed into the  Perpendicular style of the fourteenth century, and the central tower  carried up to about double its original altitude in the same style.  Nevertheless indications may be detected that these changed parts stand  upon the old foundations of Lanfranc.\"    The building, however, was not destined to remain long intact. In A.D.  1174 the whole of Conrad's choir was destroyed by a fire, which was  described fully by Gervase, a monk who witnessed it. He gives an  extraordinary account of the rage and grief of the people at the sight of  the burning cathedral. The work of rebuilding was immediately set on foot.  In September, 1174, one William of Sens, undertook the task, and wrought  thereat until 1178, when he was disabled by an unfortunate fall from a  scaffolding, and had to give up his charge and return to France. Another  William, an Englishman this time, took up the direction of the work,  and under his supervision the choir and eastern portion of the church  were finished in A.D. 1184. Further alterations were made under Prior  Chillenden at the end of the fourteenth century. Lanfranc's nave was  pulled down, and a new nave and transepts were constructed, leaving but  little of the original building set up by the first Norman archbishop.  Finally, about A.D. 1495, the cathedral was completed by the addition of  the great central tower.    [Illustration: PLAN OF CANTERBURY CATHEDRAL, ABOUT A.D. 1165.

Hence it is that  Canterbury Cathedral is a history, written in solid stone, of  architectural progress, illustrating in itself almost all the various  kinds of the style commonly called Pointed. Of these the earliest form of  Gothic and Perpendicular chiefly predominate. The shape and arrangement of  the building was doubtless largely influenced by the extraordinary number  of precious relics which it contained, and which had to be properly  displayed and fittingly enshrined. Augustine's church had possessed the  bodies of St. Blaize and St. Wilfrid, brought respectively from Rome and  from Ripon; of St. Dunstan, St. Alphege, and St. Ouen, as well as the  heads of St. Swithin and St. Furseus, and the arm of St. Bartholomew.  These were all carefully removed and placed, each in separate altars and  chapels, in Lanfranc's new cathedral. Here their number was added to by  the acquisition of new relics and sacred treasures as time went on, and  finally Canterbury enshrined its"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2284"],[0,"Animal Heroes (#2)"],[1,"innocently walked toward him. She did not  remember him. He rubbed the sides of his jaws on a post, and quietly,  slowly turned and disappeared. The last that she saw of him was the end  of his tail twitching from side to side; and the little Slummer had no  idea that she had been as near death to-day, as she had been when she  ventured into the fox-cage.    As night came on the Kitten began to feel hungry. She examined  carefully the long invisible colored stream that the wind is made of.  She selected the most interesting of its strands, and, nose-led,  followed. In the corner of the iron-yard was a box of garbage. Among  this she found something that answered fairly well for food; a bucket  of water under a faucet offered a chance to quench her thirst.    The night was spent chiefly in prowling about and learning the main  lines of the iron-yard. The next day she passed as before, sleeping in  the sun. Thus the time wore on. Sometimes she found a good meal at the  garbage-box, sometimes there was nothing. Once she found the big Black  Tom there, but discreetly withdrew before he saw her. The water-bucket  was usually at its place, or, failing that, there were some muddy  little pools on the stone below. But the garbage-box was very  unreliable. Once it left her for three days without food. She searched  along the high fence, and seeing a small hole, crawled through that and  found herself in the open street. This was a new world, but before she  had ventured far, there was a noisy, rumbling rush--a large Dog came  bounding, and Kitty had barely time to run back into the hole in the  fence. She was dreadfully hungry, and glad to find some old  potato-peelings, which gave a little respite from the hunger-pang. In  the morning she did not sleep, but prowled for food. Some Sparrows  chirruped in the yard. They were often there, but now they were viewed  with new eyes. The steady pressure of hunger had roused the wild hunter  in the Kitten; those Sparrows were game--were food. She crouched  instinctively and stalked from cover to cover, but the chirpers were  alert and flew in time. Not once, but many times, she tried without  result except to confirm the Sparrows in the list of things to be eaten  if obtainable.    On the fifth day of ill luck the Slum Kitty ventured forth into the  street, desperately bent on finding food. When far from the haven hole  some small boys opened fire at her with pieces of brick. She ran in  fear. A Dog joined in the chase, and Kitty's position grew perilous;  but an old-fashioned iron fence round a house-front was there, and she  slipped in between the rails as the Dog overtook her. A woman in a  window above shouted at the Dog. Then the boys dropped a piece of  cat-meat down to the unfortunate; and Kitty had the most delicious meal  of her life. The stoop afforded a refuge. Under this she sat patiently  till nightfall came with quiet, then sneaked back like a shadow to her  old iron-yard.    Thus the days went by for two months. She grew in size and strength and  in an intimate knowledge of the immediate neighborhood. She made the  acquaintance of Downey Street, where long rows of ash-cans were to be  seen every morning. She formed her own ideas of their proprietors. The  big house was to her, not a Roman Catholic mission, but a place whose  garbage-tins abounded in choicest fish scrapings. She soon made the  acquaintance of the meat-man, and joined in the shy fringe of Cats that  formed the outer circle. She also met the Wharf Dog as well as two or  three other horrors of the same class. She knew what to expect of them  and how to avoid them; and she was happy in being the inventor of a new  industry. Many thousand Cats have doubtless hung, in hope, about the  tempting milk-cans that the early milk-man leaves on steps and  window-ledges, and it was by the merest accident that Kitty found one  with a broken lid, and so was taught to raise it and have a satisfying  drink. Bottles, of course, were beyond her, but many a can has a misfit  lid, and Kitty was very painstaking in her efforts to discover the  loose-jointed ones. Finally she extended her range by exploration till  she achieved the heart of the next block, and farther, till once more  among the barrels and boxes of the yard behind the bird-man's cellar.    The old iron-yard never had been home, she had always felt like a  stranger there; but here she had a sense of ownership, and at once  resented the presence of another small Cat. She approached this  newcomer with threatening air. The two had got as far as snarling and  spitting when a bucket of water from an upper window drenched them both  and effectually cooled their wrath. They fled, the newcomer over the  wall, Slum Kitty under the very box where she had been born. This whole  back region appealed to her strongly, and here again she took up her  abode. The yard had no more garbage food than the other and no water at  all, but it was frequented by stray Rats and a few Mice of the finest  quality; these were occasionally secured, and afforded not only a  palatable meal, but were the cause of her winning a friend.      IV    Kitty was now fully grown. She was a striking-looking Cat of the tiger  type. Her marks were black on a very pale gray, and the four  beauty-spots of white on nose, ears, and tail-tip lent a certain  distinction. She was very expert at getting a living, and yet she had  some days of starvation and failed in her ambition of catching a  Sparrow. She was quite alone, but a new force was coming into her life.    She was lying in the sun one August day, when a large Black Cat came  walking along the top of a wall in her direction. She recognized him at  once by his torn ear. She slunk into her box and hid. He picked his way  gingerly, bounded lightly to a shed that was at the end of the yard,  and was crossing the roof when a Yellow Cat rose up. The Black Torn  glared and growled, so did the Yellow Tom. Their tails lashed from side  to side. Strong throats growled and yowled. They approached each other  with ears laid back, with muscles a-tense.    \"Yow-yow-ow!\" said the Black One.    \"Wow-w-w!\" was the slightly deeper answer.    \"Ya-wow-wow-wow!\" said the Black One, edging up half an inch nearer.    \"Yow-w-w!\" was the Yellow answer, as the blond Cat rose to full height  and stepped with vast dignity a whole inch forward. \"Yow-w!\" and he  went another inch, while his tail went swish, thump, from one side to  the other.    \"Ya-wow-yow-w!\" screamed the Black in a rising tone, and he backed the  eighth of an inch, as he marked the broad, unshrinking breast before  him.    Windows opened all around, human voices were heard, but the Cat scene  went on.    \"Yow-yow-ow!\" rumbled the Yellow Peril, his voice deepening as the  other's rose.    \"Yow!\" and he advanced another step.    Now their noses were but three inches apart; they stood sidewise, both  ready to clinch, but each waiting for the other. They glared for three  minutes in silence and like statues, except that each tail-tip was  twisting.    The Yellow began again. \"Yow-ow-ow!\" in deep tone.    \"Ya-a-a--a-a!\" screamed the Black, with intent to strike terror by his  yell; but he retreated one sixteenth of an inch. The Yellow walked up a  long half-inch; their whiskers were mixing now; another advance, and  their noses almost touched.    \"Yo-w-w!\" said Yellow, like a deep moan.    \"Y-a-a-a-a-a-a!\" screamed the Black, but he retreated a thirty-second  of an inch, and the Yellow Warrior closed and clinched like a demon.    Oh, how they rolled and bit and tore, especially the Yellow One!    How they pitched and gripped and hugged, but especially the Yellow One!    Over and over, sometimes one on top, sometimes another, but mostly the  Yellow One; and farther till they rolled off the roof, amid cheers from  all the windows. They lost not a second in that fall to the junk-yard;  they tore and clawed all the way down, but especially the Yellow One.  And when they struck the ground, still fighting, the one on top was  chiefly the Yellow One; and before they separated both had had as much  as they wanted, especially the Black One! He scaled a wall and,  bleeding and growling, disappeared, while the news was passed from  window to window that Cayley's Nig had been licked at last by Orange  Billy.    Either the Yellow Cat was a very clever seeker, or else Slum Kitty did  not hide very hard; but he discovered her among the boxes, and she made  no attempt to get away, probably because she had witnessed the fight.  There is nothing like success in warfare to win the female heart, and  thereafter the Yellow Tom and Kitty became very good friends, not  sharing each other's lives or food,--Cats do not do that way much,--but  recognizing each other as entitled to special friendly privileges.      V    September had gone. October's shortening days were on when an event  took place in the old cracker-box. If Orange Billy had come he would  have seen five little Kittens curled up in the embrace of their mother,  the little Slum Cat. It was a wonderful thing for her. She felt all the  elation an animal mother can feel, all the delight, and she loved them  and licked them with a tenderness that must have been a surprise to  herself, had she had the power to think of such things.    She had added a joy to her joyless life, but she had also added a care  and a heavy weight to her heavy load. All her strength was taken now to  find food. The burden increased as the offspring grew up big enough to  scramble about the boxes, which they did daily during her absence after  they were six weeks old. That troubles go in flocks and luck in  streaks, is well known in Slumland. Kitty had had three encounters with  Dogs, and had been stoned by Malee's negro during a two days' starve.  Then the tide turned. The very next morning she found a full milk-can  without a lid, successfully robbed a barrow pensioner, and found a big  fish-he"]]]
