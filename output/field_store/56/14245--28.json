At the very  start he'd been shot through the lower spine. So, his companions put him  in the escape boat while they clinched their prey. But as the escape  boat sheered off, the blast of enemy fire killed three and disabled two.    Scott must have been some boy. He'd already doctored himself with  hemostatics and local anaesthetics but, from the hips down, he was dead  as salt pork, and his visceral reflexes must have been reacting like a  worm cut with a hoe. Yet somehow, he doctored the two others and got  that boat home.    The other two had died, but Scott lived as sole survivor of Operation  Armada. And he hadn't been a big, bronze, Latin-Indian with incongruous  hazel eyes, but a snub-nosed redhead. And he'd been wheel-chaired for  life. They'd patched him up, decorated him, sent him to a base hospital  in Wisconsin where he could live in whatever comfort was available. So,  he dropped out of sight. And now, this!    Clyde was lying, of course. He'd picked the episode at random. Except  that so much else about him didn't square. Including his name compared  to his physique, now I thought about it.           *       *       *       *       *    I tabled it during our odyssey home. But during post-mission leave, it  kept bothering me. I checked, and came up with what I'd already known:  Scott _had_ been sole survivor, and the others were certified dead. But  about Scott, I got a runaround. He'd apparently vanished. Oh, they'd  check for me, but that could take years. Which didn't lull my curiosity  any. Into Clyde's past I was sworn not to pry.    We were training for our next assignment, when word came through of the  surrender at Kelowna. It was a flare of sunlight through a black sky.  The end was suddenly close.    Clyde and I were in Victoria, British Columbia. Not subscribing to the  folkway that prescribes seasick intoxication as an expression of joy, we  did the town with discrimination. At midnight we found ourselves  strolling along the waterfront in that fine, Vancouver-Island mist, with  just enough drink taken to be moving through a dream. At one point, we  leaned on a rail to watch the mainland lights twinkling dimly like the  hope of a new world--blackout being lifted.    Suddenly, Clyde said, \"What's fraying you recently, Will? When we were  taking our ICEG reconditioning, it came through strong as garlic, though  you wouldn't notice it normally.\"    Why be coy about an opening like that? \"Clyde, what do you know about  Edwin Scott?\" That let him spin any yarn he chose--if he chose.    He did the cigarette-lighting routine, and said quietly, \"Well, I _was_  Edwin Scott, Will.\" Then, as I waited, \"Yes, really me, the real me  talking to you. This,\" he held out a powerful, coppery hand, \"once  belonged to a man called Marco da Sanhao ... You've heard of  transplanting limbs?\"    I had. But this man was no transplant job. And if a spinal cord is cut,  transplanting legs from Ippalovsky, the primo ballerino, is worthless. I  said, \"What about it?\"    \"I was the first--successful--brain transplant in man.\"    For a moment, it queered me, but only a moment. Hell, you read in fairy  tales and fantasy magazines about one man's mind in another man's body,  and it's marvelous, not horrible. But--    By curiosity, I know a bit about such things. A big surgery journal,  back in the '40s, had published a visionary article on grafting a whole  limb, with colored plates as if for a real procedure[A]. Then they'd  developed techniques for acclimating a graft to the host's serum, so it  would not react as a foreign body. First, they'd transplanted hunks of  ear and such; then, in the '60s, fingers, feet, and whole arms in fact.    But a brain is another story. A cut nerve can grow together; every fiber  has an insulating sheath which survives the cut and guides growing  stumps back to their stations. In the brain and spinal cord, no sheaths;  growing fibers have about the chance of restoring contact that you'd  have of traversing the Amazon jungle on foot without a map. I said so.    \"I know,\" he said, \"I learned all I could, and as near as I can put it,  it's like this: When you cut your finger, it can heal in two ways.  Usually it bleeds, scabs, and skin grows under the scab, taking a week  or so. But if you align the edges exactly, at once, they may join  almost immediately healing by First Intent. Likewise in the brain, if  they line up cut nerve fibers before the cut-off bit degenerates, it'll  join up with the stump. So, take a serum-conditioned brain and fit it to  the stem of another brain so that the big fiber bundles are properly  fitted together, fast enough, and you can get better than ninety per  cent recovery.\"           *       *       *       *       *    \"Sure,\" I said, parading my own knowledge, \"but what about injury to the  masses of nerve cells? And you'd have to shear off the nerves growing  out of the brain.\"    [Illustration]    \"There's always a way, Willie. There's a place in the brain stem called  the isthmus, no cell masses, just bundles of fibers running up and down.  Almost all the nerves come off below that point; and the few that don't  can be spliced together, except the smell nerves and optic nerve. Ever  notice I can't smell, Willie? And they transplanted my eyes with the  brain--biggest trick of the whole job.\"    It figured. But, \"I'd still hate to go through with it.\"    \"What could I lose? Some paraplegics seem to live a fuller life than  ever. Me, I was going mad. And I'd seen the dogs this research team at  my hospital was working on--old dogs' brains in whelps' bodies, spry as  natural.    \"Then came the chance. Da Sanhao was a Brazilian wrestler stranded here  by the war. Not his war, he said; but he did have the decency to  volunteer as medical orderly. But he got conscripted by a bomb that took  a corner off the hospital and one off his head. They got him into  chemical stasis quicker than it'd ever been done before, but he was dead  as a human being--no brain worth salvaging above the isthmus. So, the  big guns at the hospital saw a chance to try their game on human  material, superb body and lower nervous system in ideal condition,  waiting for a brain. Only, whose?    \"Naturally, some big-shot's near the end of his rope and willing to  gamble. But _I_ decided it would be a forgotten little-shot, name of  Edwin Scott. I already knew the surgeons from being a guinea pig on  ICEG. Of course, when I sounded them out, they gave me a kindly  brush-off: The matter was out of the their hands. However, I knew whose  hands it _was_ in. And I waited for my chance--a big job that needed  somebody expendable. Then I'd make a deal, writing my own ticket because  they'd figure I'd never collect. Did you hear about Operation  Seed-corn?\"    That was the underground railway that ran thousands of farmers out of  occupied territory. Manpower was what finally broke Invader, improbable  as it seems. Epidemics, desertions, over-extended lines, thinned that  overwhelming combat strength; and every farmer spirited out of their  hands equalled ten casualties. I nodded.    \"Well, I planned that with myself as director. And sold it to Filipson.\"    I contemplated him: just a big man in a trench coat and droop-brimmed  hat silhouetted against the lamp-lit mist. I said, \"You directed  Seed-corn out of a wheel chair in enemy territory, and came back to get  transplanted into another body? Man, you didn't tell Ferd a word of a  lie when you said you were used to walking up to death.\" (But there was  more: Besides that dour Scot's fortitude, where did he come by that  high-hearted valor?)    He shrugged. \"You do what you can with what you've got. _Those_ weren't  the big adventures I was thinking about when I said that. I had a team  behind me in those--\"    I could only josh. \"I'd sure like to hear the capperoo then.\"    He toed out his cigarette. \"You're the only person who's equipped for  it. Maybe you'd get it, Willie.\"    \"How do you mean?\"    \"I kept an ICEG record. Not that I knew it was going to happen, just  wanted proof if they gave me a deal and I pulled it off. Filipson  wouldn't renege, but generals were expendable. No one knew I had that  transmitter in my temporal bone, and I rigged it to get a tape on my  home receiver. Like to hear it?\"    I said what anyone would, and steered him back to quarters before he'd  think better of it. This would be something!           *       *       *       *       *    On the way, he filled in background. Scott had been living out of  hospital in a small apartment, enjoying as much liberty as he could  manage. He had equipment so he could stump around, and an antique car  specially equipped. He wasn't complimentary about them. Orthopedic  products had to be: unreliable, hard to service, unsightly, intricate,  and uncomfortable. If they also squeaked and cut your clothes, fine!    Having to plan every move with an eye on weather and a dozen other  factors, he developed in uncanny foresight. Yet he had to improvise at a  moment's notice. With life a continuous high-wire act, he trained every  surviving fiber to precision, dexterity, and tenacity. Finally, he  avoided help. Not pride, self-preservation; the compulsively helpful  have rarely the wit to ask before rushing in to knock you on your face,  so he learned to bide his time till the horizon was clear of beaming  simpletons. Also, he found an interest in how far he could go.    These qualities, and the time he had for thinking, begot Seed-corn. When  he had it convincing, he applied to see General Filipson, head of  Regional Intelligence, a man with both insight and authority to make the  deal--but also as tough as his post demanded. Scott got an appointment  two weeks ahead.    That put it early in April, which decreased the weather hazard--a major  consideration in even a trip to the Supermarket. What was Scott's grim "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23922"],[0,"Dead Man's Land (#2)"],[1,"her,\" said Mark sadly, \"I never thought of that!  It would be  hard, dad; and it seems selfish.  It's all over.  I shan't go.\"    \"Oh!\" said Sir James, trying to frown very severely, and forcing a very  peculiar husky cough.  \"Dear, dear, how tiresome!\" he cried.  \"Haven't  got a lozenge in your pocket, have you, Dean?\"    \"No, uncle.  Shall I get you a glass of water?\"    \"No, sir,\" almost shouted his uncle.  \"You know I hate cold water.  Dear, dear!  Barking like this, just as if something has gone the wrong  way!\"  And the baronet pulled out a big silk handkerchief and began  blowing his nose violently.  \"Ah, that's better now.  Can't be cold  coming on.  Ah, much better now.\"    Then next moment he had clapped his hand smartly down on Mark's  shoulder, and the doctor noticed that he kept it there, while there was  an artificial ring in his voice as he continued, \"Oh, you won't go, sir,  won't you?\"    \"No, father,\" cried the boy firmly, and he gave his prisoned shoulder a  hitch as if to free himself from the pressure, which immediately grew  tighter.    \"Oh, that's it, is it, sir?  Now that I have made up my mind to it and  am going to start you all off with a first class equipment, you tell me  you are going to play the disobedient young dog, and plump out in a most  insolent way--you heard him doctor?--that you won't go!\"    \"Oh, I must say on his behalf, Sir James,\" cried the doctor, \"that he  did not strike me as being insolent.\"    \"Then you could not have been listening, sir, attentively,\" retorted Sir  James.  \"I look upon it as disobedient and undutiful and--and cowardly.\"    \"Oh, father! cowardly!\" cried Mark, making another unsuccessful attempt  to set his shoulder free.  \"How could it be cowardly?\"    \"Why, sir, if there's any selfishness in it you want to shuffle it off  your shoulders on to mine.\"    \"Oh, no, father; don't say that.\"    \"But I have said it, sir,\" cried Sir James.    \"But he doesn't mean it, Mark,\" cried Dean.    \"What, sir!  What!  What!  What's that, sir?  How dare you!\" thundered  Sir James.  \"Are you going to be insolent and disobedient too?\"    \"Excuse me, Sir James,\" said the doctor.  \"Let me say a few words.\"    \"No, sir,\" cried Sir James fiercely, \"not one word!  This is my affair.  I never interfere with you over your teaching of my boys.\"    \"I beg your pardon, Sir James.\"    \"No, don't,\" cried the baronet.  \"I beg yours.  I am very much put out,  doctor--very angry--very angry indeed.  I always am when I am opposed in  anything which I consider to be right.  I oughtn't to have spoken to you  as I did, so pray leave this to me or I may forget myself and say words  to you, my good old friend, for which I shall be sorry afterwards.\"    The doctor bowed his head.    \"I say, uncle,\" cried Dean.    \"Well, sir, and pray what do you say?\" snapped out Sir James.    \"I was only going to say don't be cross with us, uncle.\"    \"I am not cross, sir--cross, indeed!--only angry and hurt at this  opposition.  Well, sir, what were you going to say?\"    \"Only, nunkey--\"    \"Nunkey, sir!  Bah!\"  That bah! was a regular bark.  \"You know how I  hate that silly, childish word.\"    \"That you don't,\" thought the boy.  \"You know you always like it when  you are not out of temper.\"    \"Well, there, sir; go on.\"    \"I was going to say, uncle, that I know how it can all be managed.\"    \"Yes, sir, of course!  Like all stupid people you want to put your spoke  in the wheel and stir everything up and make the mess worse than it was  before.--I say, doctor,\"--and there was a peculiar twinkle in Sir  James's eye--\"that's what you would call a mixed metaphor, isn't it?\"    \"Well, Sir James,\" said the doctor, smiling, \"it does sound something  like it.\"    \"Sound!\" said Sir James, who was cooling fast.  \"It would look very much  like it in print.  Now, Dean, fire away.  How were you going to put it  right?\"    \"You come too, uncle.\"    \"Come too!\" cried the boy's uncle, growing fierce again.  \"How can I  come too, sir?  Why, sir, I should want a Sam Weller, like poor old  Pickwick at Dingley Dell, when he could not go to the partridge  shooting.  Do you think I want to go in a wheelbarrow with someone to  push me, in a country where there are no roads?  Bah!  Pish!  Tush!  Rrrrr-r-r-rubbish!  Here, doctor, did you ever hear such a piece of  lunacy in your life?\"    \"Well, I don't know, Sir James.  Lunacy?\"    \"Yes, sir; lunacy.  Now, look here, doctor, don't you begin apologising  for these boys and taking their part, because if you do, sir, we are no  longer friends.\"    \"Well, Sir James, it has always been an understood thing between us that  I was to be quite independent and have liberty to express my opinion in  matters connected with you and your boys.\"    \"There, I knew it!  You are going over to their side!\" raged out Sir  James.  \"And I know how it will be: I shall be so upset that I shall  have a fearful fit of the gout after this, and be obliged to have in  that doctor with his wretched mixtures for the next fortnight.  Well,  sir, I must listen to you, I suppose.\"    \"Yes, Sir James, I think you had better,\" said the doctor, smiling; and  he glanced at Mark.    \"Well, go on, then,\" cried Sir James.    \"Oh, I say, father, don't,\" cried Mark sharply.    \"Don't what, sir?\" pretty well roared his father.    \"I don't mind a nip or two, but you did give it to me then.  It was like  a vice.\"    \"Pooh, boy, pooh!  You are not a baby, are you?\"    \"No, father, but--\" began Mark, wriggling his shoulder.    \"Hold your tongue, sir, and don't interrupt the doctor.  Now, doctor,  what were you going to say?\"    \"I was going to say, Sir James, that I fully believe that a fit of the  gout must be very painful--\"    \"Oh, you think so, do you?\"    \"Yes, Sir James, and I think also that you are not troubled with many.  Of course we are not going to imitate Mr Pickwick, and a wheelbarrow is  quite out of the question.\"    \"Now, look here, sir,\" cried Sir James angrily--but somehow there was a  want of reality in his tones--\"don't you begin to suggest  impossibilities.  I think I know what you are aiming at.\"    \"I should not be surprised, sir, if you do.  Now, of course if we went  on this expedition, or expeditions, we should be going through forests  often nearly impassable; but I think I have read--\"    \"Oh, yes, I know,\" said Sir James shortly, and the boys watched the  doctor with eager eyes, and as they caught his he gave to each a keen  encouraging look; \"you have read everything--a deal too much, I think,\"  he grumbled, almost inaudibly.    \"--that,\" continued the doctor, making believe that he had not heard the  baronet's tetchy words, \"great use is made of the blacks in Africa and  India, who are quite accustomed to using a litter for the sportsmen in  hunting expeditions, for the benefit of their employers.\"    Sir James set his son's shoulder free by giving him a fierce thrust, and  his own hand too, so as to bring down his doubled fist upon the library  table.    \"Look here, sir,\" he roared, \"do you for a moment think that I would  consent to be carried stretched out on a couple of poles raised shoulder  high by a pack of niggers?  Because if you do--\"    \"And sometimes,\" continued the doctor calmly, \"the sure-footed ponies of  a country are very much used by travellers and hunting parties, for it  is necessary that the sportsman or naturalist should not be over  fatigued and should keep his nerves steady, as at times his life or that  of his companions may rest upon the ability to be true in his aim at  some dangerous beast about to charge and strike him down.\"    \"Humph!  Yes.  That's quite true, boys.  A man can't shoot straight when  he's pumped out with too much exertion.  I have missed horribly  sometimes after a long day's tramp seeing nothing worth shooting at; and  then just at the end the birds have risen, or a hare has started up and  given me an easy chance, and then got away.  There, go on, doctor, and  don't let me check you with my chatter.\"    \"Oh, I have not much more to say, sir,\" was the reply.    \"Not much more to say!\" cried Sir James, in a disappointed tone.  \"There, go on, sir; go on.  The boys are very anxious to hear you--  there, I won't be a sham--so am I too.\"    \"Well, to be brief, sir--\" began the doctor.    \"But I don't want you to be brief,\" cried Sir James, thumping the table  again, but this time more softly, and no coffee sprang out into the  saucers.    \"Oh, do go on; do go on!\" said Mark's lips inaudibly, and Dean sat  swinging himself softly to and fro as he rubbed his hands over his  knees.    \"Well, Sir James,\" continued the doctor, \"I must say that it seems to me  perfectly feasible for you to make up your mind to be one of the party.\"    \"An old man like me, sir?\" cried Sir James.    \"I beg your pardon, sir; you are not an old man.  I believe I number as  many years as you, and saving for a slight indisposition now and then  you certainly enjoy robust health.\"    \"Oh, no, no, no, no!\" cried Sir James.  \"That's adulation, sir, and I  won't have it.\"    \"'Tisn't father; is it, Dean?\"    \"Not a bit of it,\" was the reply.  \"The doctor never flatters.\"    \"Will you boys be quiet?\" shouted Sir James, and Mark clapped his hand  over his cousin's lips, receiving a similar compliment from Dean in  return, while Sir James threw himself back in his chair, frowned  severely as he stared straight out of the wide open window, and then  twitched himself about, changing his position again and again as if his  seat were not comfortable.    A strange silence had fallen on the group, and it was as if three of the  four individuals present were suffering from a desire to turn a  questioning look upon their companions, but dared not for fear of  interrupting Sir James in the deep thoughts which were evidently playing  about in his brain and filling his frank, florid, John-Bull-like  countenance with wrinkles.    During the space of perhaps two minutes the silence deepened,"]]]
