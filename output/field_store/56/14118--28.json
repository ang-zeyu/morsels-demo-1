Bechele!  What names!\"    \"Well,\" said Dick, languidly, as he sat down in a weary fashion: \"one's  going to be your boy, and the other mine.  Let's call them `Black Jack'  and `Black Dick.'\"    \"But they are brown,\" said his brother.    \"Yes, they are brown certainly,\" said Dick, thoughtfully.  \"Regular  coffee colour.  You might call one of them `Coffee.'\"    \"That'll do,\" said Jack, laughing, \"`Coffee!' and shorten it into  `Cough.'  I say, Dick, I'll have that name, and I can tell people I've  got a bad `Cough.'  But what will you call the other?\"    \"I don't know.  Stop a moment--`Chicory.'\"    \"And shorten it into `chick'.  That will do, Dick; splendid!  Cough and  Chick.  Now you two, one of you is to be Cough and the other Chick; do  you hear?\"    The Zulu boys nodded and laughed, though, in spite of the pretty good  knowledge of the English language which they had picked up from their  intercourse with the British settlers, it is doubtful whether they  understood the drift.  What they did comprehend, however, was, that they  should make friends; and this being settled, there was the old boot.    \"Give me boot, and show you big snake,\" cried Chicory.    \"No, no, give me; show more big snake,\" cried Coffee.    Just then Dinny came up with two old pairs of the lads' boots, which he  threw down upon the sandy earth; and reading consent in their young  masters' eyes, the Zulu lads pounced upon them with cries of triumph,  Coffee obtaining the two rights, and Chicory the two lefts, with which  they danced about, flourishing them over their heads with delight.    \"Come here, stupids!\" cried Jack; and after a little contention, the  boys being exceedingly unwilling to part as they thought with their  prizes, he managed to make them understand that the boots ought to go in  pairs; and the exchange having been made, each boy holding on to a boot  with one hand till he got a good grip of the other, they proceeded to  put them on.    \"Ugh! the haythen bastes,\" said Dinny, with a look of disgust.  \"Think  of the likes o' them wearing the young masthers' brogues.  Ah, Masther  Dick, dear, ye'll be repinting it one of these days.\"    \"Dinny, you're a regular prophet of evil,\" said Dick, quietly.    \"Avic--prophet of avil!\" cried Dinny.  \"Well, isn't it the truth?  Didn't I say avore we left the owld counthry that no good would come of  it?  And avore we'd been out here two years didn't the dear misthress--  the saints make her bed in heaven--go and die right away?\"    \"Dinny! how can you!\" cried Jack, angrily, as he saw the tears start  into his brother's eyes, and that in spite of the sunburning he turned  haggard and pale.    \"Don't take any notice, Dick,\" he whispered, in a tender, loving way, as  he laid one arm on his brother's shoulder and drew him aside.  \"Dinny  don't mean any harm, Dick, but he has such a long tongue.\"    Dick looked piteously in his brother's face, and one tear stole softly  down his cheek.    \"I say, Dick,\" cried Jack, imploringly, \"don't look like that.  It makes  me think so of poor mamma.  You look so like her.  I say don't, or  you'll make me cry too; and I won't,\" he cried, grinding his teeth.  \"I  said I'd never cry again, because it's so childish; and I won't.\"    \"Then I'm childish, Jack,\" said Dick, as he rubbed the tear away with  one hand.    \"No, no.  You have been so weak and delicate that you can't help it.  I'm strong.  But I say, Dick, you are ever so much stronger than when we  came out here.\"    \"Yes,\" said Dick, with a wistful look at his brother's muscular arms.  \"I am stronger, but I do get tired so soon, Jack.\"    \"Not so soon as you did, Dick; and father says you'll be a strong man  yet.  Hallo! what's the matter?  Look there.\"    The brothers turned round, and hardly knew whether to laugh or to be  alarmed; for a short distance away there was Dinny dancing about, waving  his arms and shouting, while Coffee and Chicory, each with his kiri,  were making attacks and feints, striking at the Irishman fiercely.    \"Ah, would you, ye black baste?\" shouted Dinny, as roaring now with  laughter the brothers ran back.    \"Shoo, Shoo! get out, you dirty-coloured spalpeen.  Ah, ye didn't.  Kape  off wid you.  An' me widout a bit of shtick in me fist.  Masther Dick,  dear!  Masther Jack! it's murthering me the two black Whiteboys are.  Kape off!  Ah, would ye again!  Iv I'd me shtick I'd talk to ye both,  and see if your heads weren't thick as a Tipperary boy's, I would.  Masther Dick!  Masther Jack! they'll murther me avore they've done.\"    As aforesaid, the two Zulu boys had picked up a great deal of the  English language, but their understanding thereof was sometimes very  obscure.  In this instance they had heard Dinny talking to his young  masters in a way that had made the tears come in Dick's eye, and driven  him and Jack away.  This, in the estimation of the Zulu boys, must be  through some act of cruelty or insult.  They did not like Dinny, who  made no attempt to disguise his contempt for them as \"a pair of  miserable young haythens,\" but at the same time they almost idolised the  twin brothers as their superiors and masters, for whom they were almost  ready to lay down their lives.    Here then was a cause for war.  Their nature was to love and fight, as  dearly as the wildest Irishman who was ever born.  Dinny had offended  their two \"bosses\"--as they called them, after the fashion of the Dutch  Boers, and this set their blood on fire.    Hardly had the brothers walked away than, as if moved by the same  spirit, they forgot the beauty of the old boots in which they had been  parading--to such an extent that they kicked them off, and kiri in hand  made so fierce an attack upon unarmed Dinny that, after a show of  resistance, he fairly took to his heels and ran back to the house, just  as the brothers came up.    \"Popo give him kiri,\" cried Chicory.    \"Bechele de boy make Boss Dinny run,\" cried the other, his eyes  sparkling with delight.  \"No make de boss cry eye any more.\"    \"No make Boss Dick cry eye any more,\" repeated Chicory.    The brothers looked at each other as they comprehended the meaning of  the attack.    \"Why, Jack,\" said Dick, \"what faithful true fellows they are.  They'll  never leave us in a time of trouble.\"    \"No, that they won't,\" cried Jack; and just then a tall, stern, sunburnt  man, with grizzled hair and saddened eyes, came up to where they stood.  Laying his hand affectionately on the shoulder of Dick,--    \"Come, my boys,\" he said, \"dinner is ready.  Let's be punctual while we  are leading a civilised life.\"    \"And afterwards, father, as punctual a life as we can,\" said Dick,  smiling.    \"Hurray!\" cried Jack, giving his cap a wave in the air.  \"Only another  week, and then, father--\"    \"Yes,\" said Mr Rogers, with a quiet, sad look, \"then, my boy, good-bye  to civilisation.\"    \"Only for a time, father,\" said Dick, quietly.    \"Till you win health and strength, my boy,\" said Mr Rogers, with an  affectionate glance.    \"And that we'll soon find,\" cried Jack; \"for we are off to the wilds.\"        CHAPTER TWO.    WHY THEY WENT AWAY.    It was about two years before this that Mr Edward Rogers, a gentleman  holding a post of importance in the City of London, had purchased some  land and come out to dwell in Natal.  For physician after physician had  been consulted, seaside and health resort visited, but as the time  glided on the verdict of the doctors became more and more apparent as a  true saying, that unless Mrs Rogers was taken to a warmer climate her  days would be few.    Even if she were removed the doctors said that she could not recover;  but still her days might be prolonged.  What was more, they strongly  advised such a course in favour of young Richard, who was weak and  delicate to a degree.    \"Then you really consider it necessary?\" said Mr Rogers to the great  physician who had been called in.    \"I do indeed.  As I have said, it will prolong your wife's days, and  most probably it will turn that delicate, sickly boy into a strong man.\"    On being asked further what country he would recommend, he promptly  replied,--    \"South Africa.\"    \"Natal is the place,\" he continued.  \"There you have the Drakensberg,  and you can choose your own elevation, so as to get a pure, temperate  climate, free from the cold of the mountains and the heat of the  plains.\"    Mr Rogers was a man of prompt action, for the health of those dear to  him was his first consideration.  The consequence was that after rapidly  making his arrangements, and providing the necessaries for his new home,  he took passage to Durban, arrived there in safety with his wife, two  sons, and Dennis; then made his way to Maritzburg; and soon after he had  purchased an extensive tract of land, and a pleasantly situated home,  with garden in full perfection, the owner of which, having made money in  the colony, wished to retire to England.    Here for a time Mrs Rogers had seemed better, and undoubtedly her life  was considerably prolonged.  Gardening, farming, and a little hunting  formed the occupations of the father and sons, and for a time all was  happiness in the sunny far-off home.  Then the much-dreaded day came,  and they were left to mourn for a tender wife and mother, whose loss was  irreparable.    Richard, who partook greatly of his"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21381"],[0,"Stories Of Ohio (#2)"],[1,"chiefs of the people, and  to have ruled them through their superstitions; but there is nothing to  prove this, for their laws were never put in written words or any other  sign of speech. In some of the mounds little figures of burnt clay have  been found, which may be idols, and pieces of ancient pottery, which may  be fragments of sacred vessels, and small plates of copper, with marks  or scratches on them, which may be letters. Some antiquarians have tried  to read these letters, if they are letters, and to make sense out  of them, but no seeker after true Ohio stories can trust their  interpretations.    The Mound Builders used very little stone and showed no knowledge of  masonry. But they built so massively out of the earth, that their works  have lasted to this day in many places, just as they left them, except  for the heavy growth of trees, which the first settlers found covering  them, and which were sometimes seven or eight hundred years old. At  Marietta, these works when the white people came were quite perfect and  inclosed fifty acres on the bank of the Muskingum, overlooking the Ohio.  They were in great variety of design. The largest mound was included in  the grounds of the present cemetery, and so has been saved, but the  plow of the New England emigrant soon passed over the foundations of  the Mound Builders' temples. At Circleville the shape of their  fortifications gave its name to the town, which has long since hid them  from sight. One of them was almost perfectly round, and the other nearly  square. The round fort was about seventy feet in diameter, and was  formed of two walls twenty feet high, with a deep ditch between; the  other fort was fifty-five rods square, and it had no ditch; seven  gateways opened into it at the side and corners, and it was joined to  the round fort by an eighth. It is forever to be regretted that these  precious ancient works should have been destroyed to make place for the  present town; but within a few years one of the most marvelous of the  Mound Builders' works, the great Serpent Mound near Loudon, in Adams  County, has been preserved to after time by the friends of science, and  put in the keeping of the Peabody Museum at Harvard University.    [Illustration: Serpent Mound 019L]    The state of Ohio has passed a law protecting the land around it as a  park, and there is now reason to hope that the mound will last as long  as the rocky bluff on which the serpent lies coiled. This huge idol is  more than twelve hundred feet long, and is the most wonderful symbol  in the world of the serpent worship, which was everywhere the earliest  religion of our race.    The largest military ruin is the famous Fort Ancient in Warren County,  where, on a terrace above the Little Miami River, five miles of wall,  which can still be easily traced, shut in a hundred acres. In Highland  County, about seventeen miles southeast of Hillsborough, another great  fortress embraces thirty-five acres oh the crest of a hill overlooking  Brush Creek. Itswalls are some twenty-five feet wide at the base, and  rise from &ix to ten feet above the ground. Within their circuit are  two ponds which could supply water in time of siege, and in the valley,  which the hill commands, are the ruins of the Mound Builders' village,  whose people could take refuge in the fort on the hilltop and hold it  against any approaching force.    For the rest, the works of the Mound Builders, except such as were too  large to be destroyed by the farmer, have disappeared almost as wholly  as the Mound Builders themselves. Their mole-like race threw up their  ridges and banks and larger and lesser heaps, and then ceased from the  face of the earth, as utterly as if they had burrowed into its heart.  They may have fled before the ancestors of the savages whom our  ancestors found here; they may have passed down peacefully into Mexico  and built the cities which the Spaniards destroyed there. Or, they  may have come up out of Mexico, and lost the higher arts of their  civilization in our northern woods, warring with the wild tribes who  were here before them. In either case, it is imaginable that the Mound  Builders were of the same race as the ancient Mexicans and Peruvians,  and it is probable that they were akin to the Zufiis of our own day. The  snake dances of the Zufiis are a relic of the old serpent worship; and  the fear and hate which the Zufiis bear the red savages of the plains  may be another heritage from the kindred race which once peopled our  Ohio valleys.          II. OHIO AS A PART OF FRANCE.    If the people of Ohio were Eskimos in the ages before history began,  and then thousands of years after, but still thousands of years ago were  Aztecs, there is no doubt that when history first knew of them they were  Frenchmen. The whole Great West, in fact, was once as much a province  of France as Canada; for the dominions of Louis XV. were supposed to  stretch from Quebec to New Orleans, and from the Alleghanies to the  Mississippi. The land was really held by savages who had never heard of  this king; but that was all the same to the French. They had discovered  the Great Lakes, they had discovered the Mississippi, they had  discovered the Ohio; and they built forts at Detroit, at Kaskaskia, and  at Pittsburg, as well as at Niagara; they planted a colony at the mouth  of our mightiest river, and opened a highway to France through the  Gulf of Mexico, as well as through the Gulf of St. Lawrence; and they  proclaimed their king sovereign over all.    In Ohio they had a post on the Maumee, and everywhere they had  settlements at each of the forts, where there was always a chapel and a  priest for the conversion of the Indians. With the French, the sword and  the cross went together, but very few of the savages knew that they  were either conquered or converted. From time to time they knew that  companies of picturesque strangers visited their towns, and promised  them the favor of the French king if they would have nothing to do with  the traders from the English colonies on the Atlantic, and threatened  them with his displeasure if they refused. When these brilliant  strangers staid among them, and built a fort and a chapel, and laid out  farms, then the savages willingly partook of the great king's bounty,  and clustered around the French post in their wigwams and settled down  to the enjoyment of his brandy, his tobacco, his ammunition, and his  religion. When the strangers went away, almost as soon as they had  promised and threatened, then the savages went back to business with the  English traders.    The company of Frenchmen who visited our Miami Indians at their town of  Pickawillany, on the head waters of the Miami River in 1749, was of this  last sort. It was commanded by the Chevalier Celoron de Bienville, and  it counted some two hundred Canadians and French troops, officered by  French gentlemen, and attended by one of those brave priests who led or  followed wherever the French flag was carried in the wilderness. Celoron  was sent by the governor of Canada to lay claim to the Ohio valley for  his king, and he did this by very simple means. He nailed plates of  tin to certain trees, and he buried plates of lead at the mouths of the  larger streams. The leaden plates no one ever saw for a hundred years,  till some boys going to bathe found them here and there in the wave-worn  banks; but if the Indians could have read anything, or if the English  traders could have read French, they might have learned at once from  the tin plates that the king of France owned the \"Ohio River and all the  waters that fell into it, and all the lands on both sides.\" As it was,  however, it is hard to see how anybody was the wiser for them, or could  know that the king had upheld his right to the Ohio country by battle  and by treaty and would always defend it.    In fact, neither the battles nor the treaties between the French and  English in Europe had really settled the question of their claim to the  West in America, and both sides began to urge it in a time of peace  by every kind of secret and open violence. As for the Miamis and their  allies among the neighboring tribes, they believed that God had created  them on the very spot where Celoron found them living, and when he asked  them to leave their capital at Pickawillany, and go to live near the  French post on the Maumee, they answered him that they would do so when  it was more convenient. He bade them banish the English traders, but  they merely hid them, while he was with them, and as soon as he was  gone, they had them out of hiding, and began to traffic with them. They  never found it more convenient to leave their town, until a few years  later, when a force of Canadians and Christian Indians came down from  the post on the Maumee, and destroyed Pickawillany.    Celoron came into the Ohio country through the western part of New York.  He launched his canoes on the head waters of the Beautiful River, as the  French called the Ohio, and drifted down its current till he reached the  mouth of the Great Miami. He worked up this shallow and uncertain stream  into Shelby County, where he had his friendly but fruitless meeting with  the chief of the Miamis. After that he kept on northward to the Maumee,  and then embarked on Lake Erie, and so got back to Canada. It could not  be honestly said that he had done much to make good his king's claim  to the country with his plates of tin and lead. He had flattered and  threatened the Indians at several places; and the Indians had promised,  over the cups of brandy and pipes of tobacco which he supplied them, to  be good subjects to Louis XV., who was such a very bad king that he did  not deserve even such subjects as they meant to be. They seem not to  have taken Celoron's warnings very seriously, though he told them that  the English traders would ruin them, and that they were preparing the  way for "]]]
