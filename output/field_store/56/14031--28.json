Or who was a lamp to you, issuing forth from the deep  night that ever makes the infernal valley black? Are the laws of  the abyss thus broken? or is a new design changed in heaven that,  being damned, ye come unto my rocks?\"    My Leader then took hold of me, and with words, and with hands,  and with signs, made my legs and my brow reverent. Then he  answered him, \"Of myself I came not; a Lady descended from  Heaven, through whose prayers I succored this man with my  company. But since it is thy will that more of our condition be  unfolded to thee as it truly is, mine cannot be that to thee this  be denied. This man has not seen his last evening, but through  his folly was so near thereto that very little time there was to  turn. Even as I have said, I was sent to him to rescue him, and  there was no other way than this, along which I have set myself.  I have shown to him all the guilty people; and now I intend to  show him those spirits that purge themselves under thy ward. How  I have led him, it would be long to tell thee; from on high  descends power that aids me to conduct him to see thee and to  hear thee. Now may it please thee to approve his coming. He goes  seeking liberty, which is so dear, as he knows who for her  refuses life. Thou knowest it, for death for her sake was not  hitter to thee in Utica, where thou didst leave the garment that  on the great day shall he so bright. The eternal edicts are not  violated by us, for this one is alive, and Minos does not bind  me; but I am of the circle where are the chaste eyes of thy  Marcia, who in her look still prays thee, O holy breast, that for  thine own thou hold her. For her love, then, incline thyself to  us; let us go on through thy seven realms.[1] Thanks unto thee  will I carry back to her, if to be mentioned there below thou  deign.\"    [1] The seven circles of Purgatory.      \"Marcia so pleased my eyes while I was on earth,\" said he then,  \"that whatsoever grace she wished from me I did it; now, that on  the other side of the evil stream she dwells, she can no more  move me, by that law which was made when thence I issued  forth.[1] But if a Lady of heaven move and direct thee, as thou  sayest, there is no need of flattery; suffice it fully to thee  that for her sake thou askest me. Go then, and see thou gird this  one with a smooth rush, and that thou wash his face so that thou  remove all sully from it, for it were not befitting to go with  eye overcast by any cloud before the first minister that is of  those of Paradise. This little island, round about at its base,  down there yonder where the wave heats it, bears rushes upon its  soft ooze. No plant of other kind, that might put forth leaf or  grow hard, can there have life, because it yields not to the  shocks. Thereafter let not your return be this way; the Sun which  now is rising will show you to take the mountain by easier  ascent.\"    [1] The law that the redeemed cannot be touched by other than  heavenly affections.      So he disappeared, and I rose up, without speaking, and drew me  close to my Leader, and turned my eyes to him. He began, \"Son,  follow my steps; let us turn back, for this plain slopes that way  to its low limits.\"    The dawn was vanquishing the matin hour which fled before it, so  that from afar I discerned the trembling of the sea. We set forth  over the solitary plain like a man who turns unto the road which  he has lost, and, till he come to it, seems to himself to go in  vain. When we were where the dew contends with the sun, and,  through being in a place where there is shade, is little  dissipated, my Master softly placed both his hands outspread upon  the grass. Whereon I, who perceived his design, stretched toward  him my tear-stained cheeks. Here he wholly uncovered that color  of mine which hell had hidden on me.[1]    [1] Allegorically, when the soul has entered upon the way of  purification Reason, with the dew of repentance, washes off the  stain of sin, and girds the spirit with humility.      We came, then, to the desert shore that never saw navigate its  waters one who afterwards had experience of return. Here he girt  me, even as pleased the other. O marvel! that such as he plucked  the humble plant, it instantly sprang up again there whence he  tore it.[1]    [1] The goods of the spirit are not diminished by appropriation.        CANTO II.

Now had the sun reached the horizon whose meridian circle covers  Jerusalem with its highest point; and the night which circles  opposite to it was issuing forth from Ganges with the Scales that  fall from her hand when she exceeds;[1] so that where I was the  white and red cheeks of the beautiful Aurora by too much age were  becoming orange.    [1] Purgatory and Jerusalem are antipodal, and in one direction  the Ganges or India was arbitrarily assumed to be their common  horizon. The night is here taken as the point of the Heavens  opposite the sun, and the sun being in Aries, the night is in  Libra. When night exceeds, that is, at the autumnal equinox, when  the night becomes longer than the day, the Scales may be said to  drop from her hand, since the sun enters Libra.      We were still alongside the sea, like folk who are thinking of  their road, who go in heart and linger in body; and lo! as, at  approach of the morning, through the dense vapors Mars glows  ruddy, down in the west above the ocean floor, such appeared to  me,--so may I again behold it!--a light along the sea coming so  swiftly that no flight equals its motion. From which when I had a  little withdrawn my eye to ask my Leader, again I saw it,  brighter become and larger. Then on each side of it appeared to  me a something, I know not what, white, and beneath, little by  little, another came forth from it. My Master still said not a  word, until the first white things showed themselves wings; then,  When he clearly recognized the pilot, he cried out, \"Mind, mind,  thou bend thy knees. Lo! the Angel of God: fold thy hands;  henceforth shalt thou see such officials. See how he scorns human  means, so that he wills not oar, or other sail than his own wings  between such distant shores. See, how he holds them straight  toward heaven, stroking the air with his eternal feathers that  are not changed like mortal hair.\"    Then, as nearer and nearer toward us came the Bird Divine, the  brighter he appeared; so that near by my eye endured him not, but  I bent it down: and he came on to the shore with a small vessel,  very swift and light so that the water swallowed naught of it. At  the stern stood the Celestial Pilot, such that if but described  he would make blessed; and more than a hundred spirits sat  within. \"In exitu Israel de Egypto\"[1] they all were singing  together with one voice, with whatso of that psalm is after  written. Then he made the sign of holy cross upon them; whereon  they all threw themselves upon the strand; and he went away swift  as he had come.    1 \"When Israel went out of Egypt.\" Psalm cxiv.      The crowd which remained there seemed strange to the place,  gazing round about like him who of new things makes essay. On all  sides the Sun, who had with his bright arrows chased from  midheaven the Capricorn,[1] was shooting forth the day, when the  new people raised their brow toward us, saying to us, \"If ye  know, show us the way to go unto the mountain.\" And Virgil  answered, \"Ye believe, perchance, that we are acquainted with  this place, but we are pilgrims even as ye are. Just now we came,  a little before you, by another way, which was so rough and  difficult that the ascent henceforth will seem play to us.    [1] When Aries, in which the Sun was rising, is on the horizon,  Capricorn is at the zenith.      The souls who had become aware concerning me by my breathing,  that I was still alive, marvelling became deadly pale. And as to  a messenger who bears an olive branch the folk press to hear  news, and no one shows himself shy of crowding, so, at the sight  of me, those fortunate souls stopped still, all of them, as if  forgetting to go to make themselves fair.    I saw one of them drawing forward to embrace me with so great  affection that it moved me to do the like. O shades empty save in  aspect! Three times behind it I clasped my hands and as oft  returned with them unto my breast. With marvel, I believe, I  painted me; wherefore the shade smiled and drew back, and I,  following it, pressed forward, Gently it said, that I should  pause; then I knew who it was, and I prayed it that to speak with  me it would stop a little. It replied to me, \"So as I loved thee  in the mortal body, so loosed from it I love thee; therefore I  stop; but wherefore goest thou?\"    \"Casella mine, in order to return another time to this place  where I am, do I make this journey,\" said I, \"but from thee how  has so much time been taken?\"[1]    [1] \"How has thy coming hither been delayed so long since thy  death?\"      And he to me, \"No wrong has been done me if he[1] who takes both  when and whom it pleases him ofttimes hath denied to me this  passage; for of a just will[2] his own is made. Truly for three  months he has taken with all peace whoso has wished to enter.  Wherefore I who was now turned to the seashore where the water of  Tiber grows salt was benignantly received by him.[3] To that  outlet has he now turned his wing, because always those assemble  there who towards Acheron do not descend.\"      [1] The Celestial Pilot.    [2] That is, of the Divine Will; but there is no explanation of  the motive of the delay.

And that is always the way,--something we haven't got always seems more  worth having than the things we have.    When Tiki had recovered from his surprise he remembered one familiar  word in Swanki's list of things to eat, and as he was always ready to  please, he said:    \"Swanki, I don't know where the mince pie and plum duff and--and vinegar  trees grow, but I can show you the pickled cabbage trees all right.\"    \"Oh, Tiki, can you?\" cried Swanki. \"Then let's go at once. I'm longing  for some pickled cabbage.\"    \"It's a long way,\" said Tiki, doubtfully, \"a long, long way to go;\"  (though he'd never heard of the popular song, which shows how easy it  must be to write those songs).    But Swanki said it didn't matter how far it was; the sooner they  started, the sooner they'd be there, which was true in a way.    They slid down the tree, and having persuaded the kiwi to give them a  lift, which was pretty cool of them, considering, they set off and  travelled in fine style for some way.    But as they arrived near the edge of the bush and the trees grew  thinner, the kiwi, who hates the open country for his own reasons,  refused to go any farther, and the Piccaninnies had to get off and  trudge the rest of the way on foot.    And crossing a little green glade they met Miss Fantail darting round  and round the glade after flies. Now, Miss Fantail is a friendly and  harmless little bird, but she's the most inquisitive creature in the  bush, and a regular little gossip.    The Piccaninnies knew that if she got wind of where they were going it  would soon be all over the bush, and they made up their minds to dodge  her. So they pretended to be little brown lizards crawling through the  moss, but Miss Fantail wasn't taken in for a moment, but flitted down  to them and put her head on one side in her bright-eyed inquisitive way.    [Illustration: Miss Fantail, the most inquisitive creature in the bush.]    \"Now she'll begin to ask questions,\" muttered Swanki, and sure enough  Miss Fantail began in her usual manner:    \"Whit--Whit--Whit--What? What? What? What? Where are you two off to?  Whit! What are you after? What? When are you coming back? Why are you  going so fast? Whit--Whit--Whit--What? What? What?\"    And when they wouldn't answer she persisted in following them, flitting  in her restless way from tree to tree, sometimes darting ahead of them,  sometimes circling round them, and never ceasing to cry inquisitively:    \"Whit--Whit--Whit--What? What? What? What?\"    On the very edge of the bush, however, she hesitated. She had been born  in the bush, and was used only to its cool green shade, and the glare of  the sun on the outside world rather scared her. So after hanging about  for a time to see what the Piccaninnies intended doing, she flitted away  after a large blue fly, and while she was busy Tiki and Swanki gave her  the slip. They, too, had been rather dismayed at the glare of the sun  and the shelterless look of the outside world, but Tiki said that the  Pickled Cabbage trees were not far away; he had seen them once when he  had climbed to the top of a rata tree, and a bush pigeon had told him  the name of them.    So, shrinking a little and keeping a sharp look-out for enemies in case  they had need to \"drop dead\" and pretend to be a dead stick or leaf,  they ran on hand in hand, and came after a time to the edge of the  swamp.    \"There!\" said Tiki proudly, \"there are the Pickled Cabbage trees.\"    There were quite a number of them, tall slim trees with long bare trunks  and a crown of long, narrow leaves at the top.    \"We must climb to the top to find the cabbages,\" said Swanki; but though  they had done a lot of climbing in their day, it was usually up trees  with plenty of branches and twigs to help them.    They found it very hard to get a grip with their little, bare, brown  knees on the long, smooth trunks, and Tiki frowned thoughtfully at his  tree as he slid down for the fifth time.    \"You give me a leg up first,\" said Swanki, \"and when I'm up I'll give  you one,\" which was rather a silly thing to say when you come to think  of it.    However, you can do most things if you try hard enough, and Swanki,  seeing how the last year's jackets of the cicadas, which they had quite  grown out of, were clinging to the Cabbage trees with their tiny claws,  slipped her hands and feet into a set of them and through this clever  idea of hers was able to climb right up the trunk, followed by Tiki, who  was busy all the time trying to explain that he had just been going to  think of the plan himself.    When they were at last nestled in the crown of leaves they began to look  about for the cabbages, but could find nothing resembling Swanki's idea  of a cabbage, which wasn't very clear, but quite different from anything  they found in that tree.    They nibbled some of the leaves which were bitter and stringy, and tried  some of last year's flowers, which were very little better, and then  Swanki cried out in disappointment:    \"You've played me a trick, Tiki. These are not cabbages.\"    She gave him an angry little push, and to her surprise he fell backward  out of the tree splash into the swamp, where she saw him struggling in  the muddy water.    Very frightened Swanki hurried down the tree and ran to the edge of the  water, where she held out her hands to Tiki who grabbed them tightly.    But just as she was drawing him to land the boggy piece of ground on  which she was standing gave way, and she, too, fell into the water.    Luckily it was not very deep, and a friendly old frog gave them a leg up  the bank, and very wet and muddy and miserable they started back for the  bush.    The worst of it was that tiresome Miss Fantail had spread it all abroad  that they had left the bush, and on the way home they met her and all  her relations, and all the Piccaninnies too, setting out on a search  party.    [Illustration: \"To her surprise he fell backward out of the tree.\"]    How they stared and questioned and teased the poor little tired  travellers, standing before them so wet and grimy and weary, and when  they had heard the whole story how they all laughed at Swanki and Tiki!    And glad, indeed, were those two Piccaninnies to sit down to  a delicious tea of fern root, young nikau, and assorted berries,  and never again did any one hear Swanki complain of just  \"berries--berries--berries--roots--roots--roots.\"    [Illustration]          [Illustration: \" ... he rocked himself to sleep among the pretty little  starry flowers.\"]          TEA TREE.      One of the Piccaninnies had a horrid adventure one day.  He had heard a tui that morning singing in the Bush, and had made up his  mind to speak to it, because he was sulking with the other Piccaninnies.    You know they say a tui can be made to talk, but it's hard to get near  enough to one to find out, but perhaps if you did get close and  surprised it, it would be so mad at you that it would _answer back_.    The Piccaninny followed his tui up and up, but it flitted from tree top  to tree top, and he could hear it tolling a bell and cracking a whip,  and chuckling at him, and finally it flew away, and that was the last of  it.    The Piccaninny, tired out, climbed up into a tea tree bush, and swung  himself gently to-and-fro until he rocked himself to sleep among the  pretty little starry flowers, a thing he should never have done unless a  Piccaninny Boy Scout had been posted near by in case of danger. He was  _so_ drowsy, that he never heard a voice saying:    \"Oh! look here, George, this is a lovely spray!\" nor felt the spray on  which he was sleeping torn from its mother-bush, and carried away. It  was taken into a big room in a big house, and there on a big table it  was placed in a silver vase.    It was then the Piccaninny woke up because the bough had ceased to sway  gently up and down. At first he was very surprised, and then, poking his  little brown head out, he was horribly frightened. Instead of the green  leafy arch above him, he saw a flat white thing, and all around him were  enormous strange objects. Craning out still farther he over-balanced  himself and fell thud! upon a hard, polished flat plain. He tried to  scramble to his feet, but the ground under him was so slippery that he  could only crawl gingerly on all fours and flounder about on it.    Someone exclaimed suddenly:    \"Oh, look at that horrid brown insect. It must have come from the tea  tree. Fetch the brush and dustpan.\"    And someone else cried excitedly:    \"Kill it! Kill it!\"    But a third someone said quite calmly:    \"Nonsense! It's quite harmless!\"    Then a huge bristly thing fell upon him, and smothered and gasping he  felt himself swept along, and then flying through the air. Again he fell  with a thud upon something hard, but it was only the hardness of the  good brown earth, and the tall green grass closed protectingly over him.    You may be sure he lost no time in scuttling back to the bush, and he  didn't hunt tuis again for many a long day.

They are the prettiest  little things--fair as lilies with golden ringlets, and little golden  peaked caps, bent over like a horn upon their heads. I don't think they  wear anything else much, just an odd little fluff of green here and  there, like stray feathers that have stuck to them.
