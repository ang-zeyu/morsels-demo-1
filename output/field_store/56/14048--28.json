But frightful  spasms of pain convulsed her, contorting her pale face.    \"Some brandy--!\" cried Leroux, anxiously.    \"If you please,\" whispered the visitor.    She dropped her arms and fell back upon the chesterfield, insensible.          II    MIDNIGHT AND MR. KING      Leroux clutched at the corner of the writing-table to steady himself  and stood there looking at the deathly face. Under the most favorable  circumstances, he was no man of action, although in common with the rest  of his kind he prided himself upon the possession of that presence of  mind which he lacked. It was a situation which could not have alarmed  \"Martin Zeda,\" but it alarmed, immeasurably, nay, struck inert with  horror, Martin Zeda's creator.    Then, in upon Leroux's mental turmoil, a sensible idea intruded itself.    \"Dr. Cumberly!\" he muttered. \"I hope to God he is in!\"    Without touching the recumbent form upon the chesterfield, without  seeking to learn, without daring to learn, if she lived or had died,  Leroux, the tempo of his life changed to a breathless gallop, rushed  out of the study, across the entrance hail, and, throwing wide the flat  door, leapt up the stair to the flat above--that of his old friend, Dr.  Cumberly.    The patter of the slippered feet grew faint upon the stair; then, as  Leroux reached the landing above, became inaudible altogether.    In Leroux's study, the table-clock ticked merrily on, seeming to hasten  its ticking as the hand crept around closer and closer to midnight.  The mosaic shade of the lamp mingled reds and blues and greens upon the  white ceiling above and poured golden light upon the pages of manuscript  strewn about beneath it. This was a typical work-room of a literary man  having the ear of the public--typical in every respect, save for the  fur-clad figure outstretched upon the settee.    And now the peeping light indiscreetly penetrated to the hem of a silken  garment revealed by some disarrangement of the civet fur. To the eye  of an experienced observer, had such an observer been present in Henry  Leroux's study, this billow of silk and lace behind the sheltering fur  must have proclaimed itself the edge of a night-robe, just as the ankle  beneath had proclaimed itself to Henry Leroux's shocked susceptibilities  to be innocent of stocking.    Thirty seconds were wanted to complete the cycle of the day, when one of  the listless hands thrown across the back of the chesterfield opened and  closed spasmodically. The fur at the bosom of the midnight visitor began  rapidly to rise and fall.    Then, with a choking cry, the woman struggled upright; her hair, hastily  dressed, burst free of its bindings and poured in gleaming cascade down  about her shoulders.    Clutching with one hand at her cloak in order to keep it wrapped about  her, and holding the other blindly before her, she rose, and with that  same odd, groping movement, began to approach the writing-table. The  pupils of her eyes were mere pin-points now; she shuddered convulsively,  and her skin was dewed with perspiration. Her breath came in agonized  gasps.    \"God!--I... am dying... and I cannot--tell him!\" she breathed.    Feverishly, weakly, she took up a pen, and upon a quarto page, already  half filled with Leroux's small, neat, illegible writing, began to  scrawl a message, bending down, one hand upon the table, and with her  whole body shaking.    Some three or four wavering lines she had written, when intimately,  for the flat of Henry Leroux in Palace Mansions lay within sight of the  clock-face--Big Ben began to chime midnight.    The writer started back and dropped a great blot of ink upon the paper;  then, realizing the cause of the disturbance, forced herself to continue  her task.    The chime being completed: ONE! boomed the clock; TWO!... THREE! ...  FOUR!...    The light in the entrance-hall went out!    FIVE! boomed Big Ben;--SIX!... SEVEN!...    A hand, of old ivory hue, a long, yellow, clawish hand, with part of a  sinewy forearm, crept in from the black lobby through the study doorway  and touched the electric switch!    EIGHT!...    The study was plunged in darkness!    Uttering a sob--a cry of agony and horror that came from her very  soul--the woman stood upright and turned to face toward the door,  clutching the sheet of paper in one rigid hand.    Through the leaded panes of the window above the writing-table swept  a silvern beam of moonlight. It poured, searchingly, upon the fur-clad  figure swaying by the table; cutting through the darkness of the room  like some huge scimitar, to end in a pallid pool about the woman's  shadow on the center of the Persian carpet.    Coincident with her sobbing cry--NINE! boomed Big Ben; TEN!...    Two hands--with outstretched, crooked, clutching fingers--leapt from the  darkness into the light of the moonbeam.    \"God! Oh, God!\" came a frenzied, rasping shriek--\"MR. KING!\"    Straight at the bare throat leapt the yellow hands; a gurgling cry  rose--fell--and died away.    Gently, noiselessly, the lady of the civet fur sank upon the carpet by  the table; as she fell, a dim black figure bent over her. The tearing  of paper told of the note being snatched from her frozen grip; but never  for a moment did the face or the form of her assailant encroach upon the  moonbeam.    Batlike, this second and terrible visitant avoided the light.    The deed had occupied so brief a time that but one note of the great  bell had accompanied it.    TWELVE! rang out the final stroke from the clock-tower. A low, eerie  whistle, minor, rising in three irregular notes and falling in weird,  unusual cadence to silence again, came from somewhere outside the room.    Then darkness--stillness--with the moon a witness of one more ghastly  crime.    Presently, confused and intermingled voices from above proclaimed the  return of Leroux with the doctor. They were talking in an excited  key, the voice of Leroux, especially, sounding almost hysterical. They  created such a disturbance that they attracted the attention of Mr. John  Exel, M. P., occupant of the flat below, who at that very moment had  returned from the House and was about to insert the key in the lock of  his door. He looked up the stairway, but, all being in darkness, was  unable to detect anything. Therefore he called out:--    \"Is that you, Leroux? Is anything the matter?\"    \"Matter, Exel!\" cried Leroux; \"there's a devil of a business! For  mercy's sake, come up!\"    His curiosity greatly excited, Mr. Exel mounted the stairs, entering  the lobby of Leroux's flat immediately behind the owner and Dr.  Cumberly--who, like Leroux, was arrayed in a dressing-gown; for he had  been in bed when summoned by his friend.    \"You are all in the dark, here,\" muttered Dr. Cumberly, fumbling for the  switch.    \"Some one has turned the light out!\" whispered Leroux, nervously; \"I  left it on.\"    Dr. Cumberly pressed the switch, turning up the lobby light as Exel  entered from the landing. Then Leroux, entering the study first of the  three, switched on the light there, also.    One glance he threw about the room, then started back like a man  physically stricken.    \"Cumberly!\" he gasped, \"Cumberly\"--and he pointed to the furry heap by  the writing-table.    \"You said she lay on the chesterfield,\" muttered Cumberly.    \"I left her there.\"...    Dr. Cumberly crossed the room and dropped upon his knees. He turned the  white face toward the light, gently parted the civet fur, and pressed  his ear to the silken covering of the breast. He started slightly and  looked into the glazing eyes.    Replacing the fur which he had disarranged, the physician stood up and  fixed a keen gaze upon the face of Henry Leroux. The latter swallowed  noisily, moistening his parched lips.    \"Is she\"... he muttered; \"is she\"...    \"God's mercy, Leroux!\" whispered Mr. Exel--\"what does this mean?\"    \"The woman is dead,\" said Dr. Cumberly.    In common with all medical men, Dr. Cumberly was a physiognomist; he was  a great physician and a proportionately great physiognomist. Therefore,  when he looked into Henry Leroux's eyes, he saw there, and recognized,  horror and consternation. With no further evidence than that furnished  by his own powers of perception, he knew that the mystery of this  woman's death was as inexplicable to Henry Leroux as it was inexplicable  to himself.    He was a masterful man, with the gray eyes of a diplomat, and he knew  Leroux as did few men. He laid both hands upon the novelist's shoulders.    \"Brace up, old chap!\" he said; \"you will want all your wits about you.\"    \"I left her,\" began Leroux, hesitatingly--\"I left\"...    \"We know all about where you left her, Leroux,\" interrupted Cumberly;  \"but what we want to get at is this: what occurred between the time you  left her, and the time of our return?\"    Exel, who had walked across to the table, and with a horror-stricken  face was gingerly examining the victim, now exclaimed:--    \"Why! Leroux! she is--she is... UNDRESSED!\"    Leroux clutched at his dishevelled hair with both hands.    \"My dear Exel!\" he cried--\"my dear, good man! Why do you use that tone?  You say 'she is undressed!' as though I were responsible for the poor  soul's condition!\"    \"On the contrary, Leroux!\" retorted Exel, standing very upright, and  staring through his monocle; \"on the contrary, YOU misconstrue ME! I did  not intend to imply--to insinuate--\"    \"My dear Exel!\" broke in Dr. Cumberly--\"Leroux is perfectly well aware  that you intended nothing unkindly. But the poor chap, quite naturally,  is distraught at the moment. You MUST understand that, man!\"    \"I understand; and I am sorry,\" said Exel, casting a sidelong glance  at the body. \"Of course, it is a delicate subject. No doubt Leroux can  explain.\"...    \"Damn your explanation!\" shrieked Leroux"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20293"],[0,"A Popular History of the Art of Music (#2)"],[1,"ideas about music and education--\"Song of the  Harper\"--kindergarten.
