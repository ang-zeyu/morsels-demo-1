[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20715"],[0,"Marriage and Love (#2)"],[1,"factor, is indeed phenomenal  when we reflect that it is but a short time since she has entered the  industrial arena. Six million women wage workers; six million women, who  have the equal right with men to be exploited, to be robbed, to go on  strike; aye, to starve even. Anything more, my lord? Yes, six million  wage workers in every walk of life, from the highest brain work to the  mines and railroad tracks; yes, even detectives and policemen. Surely  the emancipation is complete.    Yet with all that, but a very small number of the vast army of women  wage workers look upon work as a permanent issue, in the same light as  does man. No matter how decrepit the latter, he has been taught to be  independent, self-supporting. Oh, I know that no one is really  independent in our economic treadmill; still, the poorest specimen of a  man hates to be a parasite; to be known as such, at any rate.    The woman considers her position as worker transitory, to be thrown  aside for the first bidder. That is why it is infinitely harder to  organize women than men. \"Why should I join a union? I am going to get  married, to have a home.\" Has she not been taught from infancy to look  upon that as her ultimate calling? She learns soon enough that the home,  though not so large a prison as the factory, has more solid doors and  bars. It has a keeper so faithful that naught can escape him. The most  tragic part, however, is that the home no longer frees her from wage  slavery; it only increases her task.    According to the latest statistics submitted before a Committee \"on  labor and wages, and congestion of population,\" ten per cent. of the  wage workers in New York City alone are married, yet they must continue  to work at the most poorly paid labor in the world. Add to this horrible  aspect the drudgery of housework, and what remains of the protection and  glory of the home? As a matter of fact, even the middle-class girl in  marriage can not speak of her home, since it is the man who creates her  sphere. It is not important whether the husband is a brute or a  darling. What I wish to prove is that marriage guarantees woman a home  only by the grace of her husband. There she moves about in _his_ home,  year after year, until her aspect of life and human affairs becomes as  flat, narrow, and drab as her surroundings. Small wonder if she becomes  a nag, petty, quarrelsome, gossipy, unbearable, thus driving the man  from the house. She could not go, if she wanted to; there is no place to  go. Besides, a short period of married life, of complete surrender of  all faculties, absolutely incapacitates the average woman for the  outside world. She becomes reckless in appearance, clumsy in her  movements, dependent in her decisions, cowardly in her judgment, a  weight and a bore, which most men grow to hate and despise. Wonderfully  inspiring atmosphere for the bearing of life, is it not?    But the child, how is it to be protected, if not for marriage? After  all, is not that the most important consideration? The sham, the  hypocrisy of it! Marriage protecting the child, yet thousands of  children destitute and homeless. Marriage protecting the child, yet  orphan asylums and reformatories overcrowded, the Society for the  Prevention of Cruelty to Children keeping busy in rescuing the little  victims from \"loving\" parents, to place them under more loving care, the  Gerry Society. Oh, the mockery of it!    Marriage may have the power to bring the horse to water, but has it ever  made him drink? The law will place the father under arrest, and put him  in convict's clothes; but has that ever stilled the hunger of the child?  If the parent has no work, or if he hides his identity, what does  marriage do then? It invokes the law to bring the man to \"justice,\" to  put him safely behind closed doors; his labor, however, goes not to the  child, but to the State. The child receives but a blighted memory of its  father's stripes.    As to the protection of the woman,--therein lies the curse of marriage.  Not that it really protects her, but the very idea is so revolting, such  an outrage and insult on life, so degrading to human dignity, as to  forever condemn this parasitic institution.    It is like that other paternal arrangement--capitalism. It robs man of  his birthright, stunts his growth, poisons his body, keeps him in  ignorance, in poverty, and dependence, and then institutes charities  that thrive on the last vestige of man's self-respect.    The institution of marriage makes a parasite of woman, an absolute  dependent. It incapacitates her for life's struggle, annihilates her  social consciousness, paralyzes her imagination, and then imposes its  gracious protection, which is in reality a snare, a travesty on human  character.    If motherhood is the highest fulfillment of woman's nature, what other  protection does it need, save love and freedom? Marriage but defiles,  outrages, and corrupts her fulfillment. Does it not say to woman, Only  when you follow me shall you bring forth life? Does it not condemn her  to the block, does it not degrade and shame her if she refuses to buy  her right to motherhood by selling herself? Does not marriage only  sanction motherhood, even though conceived in hatred, in compulsion?  Yet, if motherhood be of free choice, of love, of ecstasy, of defiant  passion, does it not place a crown of thorns upon an innocent head and  carve in letters of blood the hideous epithet, Bastard? Were marriage to  contain all the virtues claimed for it, its crimes against motherhood  would exclude it forever from the realm of love.      Love, the strongest and deepest element in all life, the harbinger of  hope, of joy, of ecstasy; love, the defier of all laws, of all  conventions; love, the freest, the most powerful moulder of human  destiny; how can such an all-compelling force be synonymous with that  poor little State and Church-begotten weed, marriage?      Free love? As if love is anything but free! Man has bought brains, but  all the millions in the world have failed to buy love. Man has subdued  bodies, but all the power on earth has been unable to subdue love. Man  has conquered whole nations, but all his armies could not conquer love.  Man has chained and fettered the spirit, but he has been utterly  helpless before love. High on a throne, with all the splendor and pomp  his gold can command, man is yet poor and desolate, if love passes him  by. And if it stays, the poorest hovel is radiant with warmth, with life  and color. Thus love has the magic power to make of a beggar a king.  Yes, love is free; it can dwell in no other atmosphere. In freedom it  gives itself unreservedly, abundantly, completely. All the laws on the  statutes, all the courts in the universe, cannot tear it from the soil,  once love has taken root. If, however, the soil is sterile, how can  marriage make it bear fruit? It is like the last desperate struggle of  fleeting life against death.    Love needs no protection; it is its own protection. So long as love  begets life no child is deserted, or hungry, or famished for the want of  affection. I know this to be true. I know women who became mothers in  freedom by the men they loved. Few children in wedlock enjoy the care,  the protection, the devotion free motherhood is capable of bestowing.      The defenders of authority dread the advent of a free motherhood, lest  it will rob them of their prey. Who would fight wars? Who would create  wealth? Who would make the policeman, the jailer, if woman were to  refuse the indiscriminate breeding of children? The race, the race!  shouts the king, the president, the capitalist, the priest. The race  must be preserved, though woman be degraded to a mere machine,--and the  marriage institution is our only safety valve against the pernicious sex  awakening of woman. But in vain these frantic efforts to maintain a  state of bondage. In vain, too, the edicts of the Church, the mad  attacks of rulers, in vain even the arm of the law. Woman no longer  wants to be a party to the production of a race of sickly, feeble,  decrepit, wretched human beings, who have neither the strength nor moral  courage to throw off the yoke of poverty and slavery. Instead she  desires fewer and better children, begotten and reared in love and  through free choice; not by compulsion, as marriage imposes. Our  pseudo-moralists have yet to learn the deep sense of responsibility  toward the child, that love in freedom has awakened in the breast of  woman. Rather would she forego forever the glory of motherhood than  bring forth life in an atmosphere that breathes only destruction and  death. And if she does become a mother, it is to give to the child the  deepest and best her being can yield. To grow with the child is her  motto; she knows that in that manner alone can she help build true  manhood and womanhood.      Ibsen must have had a vision of a free mother, when, with a master  stroke, he portrayed Mrs. Alving. She was the ideal mother because she  had outgrown marriage and all its horrors, because she had broken her  chains, and set her spirit free to soar until it returned a personality,  regenerated and strong. Alas, it was too late to rescue her life's joy,  her Oswald; but not too late to realize that love in freedom is the only  condition of a beautiful life. Those who, like Mrs. Alving, have paid  with blood and tears for their spiritual awakening, repudiate marriage  as an imposition, a shallow, empty mockery. They know, whether love last  but one brief span of time or for eternity, it is the only creative,  inspiring, elevating basis for a new race, a new world.      In our present pygmy state love is indeed a stranger to most people.  Misunderstood and shunned, it rarely takes root; or if it does, it soon  withers and dies. Its delicate fiber can not endure the stress and  strain of the daily grind. Its soul is too complex to adjust itself to  the slimy"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20729"],[0,"At the Point of the Bayonet: A Tale of the Mahratta War (#2)"],[1,"of baggage possible, and made up  for inferiority in numbers by speed, activity, and dash. Here, on  the contrary, we have a force hampered to an unheard-of degree by  baggage and camp followers; with an invalid at its head, controlled  by two civilians; and moving at a rate which, in itself, testifies  to divided councils and utter incompetency on the part of its  commander. It is almost impossible even to hope for success, under  such conditions.\"    \"The lookout is certainly bad,\" the younger officer agreed.  \"However, before now the fighting powers of the British soldier  have made up for the blunders of his commanders; and we may hope  that this will be the case, now.\"    \"If a disaster happen,\" the major said, \"we shall have the  Mahrattas down at the gates of Bombay; and as soon as I hear a  rumour of it--and news travels wonderfully fast among the  natives--I shall return to the city.\"    \"Oh, I don't think you need fear anything of that sort, Major!  Besides, this is not on the direct line between the Ghauts and the  city. And even if they find they cannot push on, I should say our  force would be able to secure their retreat. The Mahratta horse  will never be able to break our squares; but of course, in that  case we should have to abandon all our baggage and baggage  animals.\"    \"I agree with you that the Mahrattas would doubtless hang on the  skirts of our force, and follow them down the Bhore Ghaut, and so  would not come anywhere near us; but they might detach flying  parties to burn and plunder, as is their custom. Brave as they are,  the Mahrattas do not fight for the love of fighting, but simply  from the hope of plunder and of enlarging their territories.    \"Well, we may hope, in a day or two, to hear that a battle has been  fought, and that a victory has been won. Not that one victory would  settle the matter, for the Mahratta force consists almost entirely  of cavalry and, as we have only a handful, they would, if beaten,  simply ride off and be ready to fight again, another day. If we had  pushed on and occupied Poona, directly we landed--which should have  been easy enough, if the baggage train had been left behind, for it  is but forty miles from Panwell to the Mahratta capital--the  position would have been altogether different. The Mahrattas would  not have had time to collect their forces, and we should probably  have met with no opposition and, once in Poona, could have held it  against the whole Mahratta force. Besides, it is certain that some  of the chiefs, seeing that Rugoba was likely to be made Peishwa,  would have come to the conclusion that it would be best for them to  side with him.    \"Of course, the baggage should all have been left at Panwell and,  in that case, the force could have entered Poona three days after  landing, instead of delaying from the 25th of November until today,  the 7th of January; and even now, at their present rate of advance,  they may be another fortnight before they arrive at Poona. I don't  think there has been so disgraceful a business since we first put  foot in India.    \"At any rate, I shall send Mary and the child down to Bombay,  tomorrow. It is all very well to have her with me, when everything  is peaceable; but although I do not think there is any actual risk,  it is as well that, in turbulent times like these, with nothing but  a force under such incompetent leading between us and a powerful  and active enemy, she should be safe at Bombay.\"    Just before daybreak, next morning, there was a sudden shout from  one of the sentries; who had for the first time been posted round  the camp. The warning was followed by a fierce rush, and a large  body of horse and foot charged into the camp. The escort were, for  the most part, killed as they issued from their tents. The major  and his friend were shot down as they sallied out, sword in hand.  The same fate befell Mrs. Lindsay.    Then the Mahrattas proceeded to loot the camp. The ayah had thrust  the child underneath the wall of the tent, at the first alarm. A  Mahratta seized her, and would have cut her down, had she not  recognized him by the light of the lamp which hung from the tent  ridge.    \"Why, cousin Sufder,\" she exclaimed, \"do you not know me?\"    He loosed his hold, and stood back and gazed at her.    \"Why, Soyera,\" he exclaimed, \"is it you? It is more than ten years  since I saw you!    \"It is my cousin,\" he said to some of his companions who were  standing round, \"my mother's sister's child.\"    \"Don't be alarmed,\" he went on, to the woman, \"no one will harm  you. I am one of the captains of this party.\"    \"I must speak to you alone, Sufder.\"    She went outside the tent with him.    \"You have nothing to fear,\" he said. \"You shall go back with us to  Jooneer. I have a house there, and you can stay with my wife.  Besides, there are many of your people still alive.\"    \"But that is not all, Sufder. I was ayah to the major and his  wife--whom your people have just killed, and whom I loved  dearly--and in my charge is their child. He is but a few months  old, and I must take him with me.\"    \"It is impossible,\" Sufder replied. \"No white man, woman, or child  would be safe in the Deccan, at present.\"    \"No one would see his face,\" the woman said. \"I would wrap him up,  and will give out that he is my own child. As soon as we get up the  Ghauts I would stain his face and skin, and no one would know that  he was white. If you will not let me do it, tell your men to cut me  down. I should not care to live, if the child were gone as well as  his father and mother. You cannot tell how kind they were to me.  You would not have me ungrateful, would you, Sufder?\"    \"Well, well,\" the man said good naturedly, though somewhat  impatiently, \"do as you like; but if any harm comes of it, mind it  is not my fault.\"    Thankful for the permission, Soyera hurried round to the back of  the tent, picked up the child and wrapped it in her robe; and then  when, after firing the place, the Mahrattas retired, she fell in  behind them, and followed them in the toilsome climb up the  mountains, keeping so far behind that none questioned her. Once or  twice Sufder dropped back to speak to her.    \"It is a foolish trick of yours,\" he said, \"and I fear that trouble  will come of it.\"    \"I don't see why it should,\" she replied. \"The child will come to  speak Mahratta and, when he is stained, none will guess that he is  English. In time, I may be able to restore him to his own people.\"    The other shook his head.    \"That is not likely,\" he said, \"for before many weeks, we shall  have driven them into the sea.\"    \"Then he must remain a Mahratta,\" she said, \"until he is able to  make his way to join the English in Madras or Calcutta.\"    \"You are an obstinate woman, and always have been so; else you  would not have left your people to go to be servant among the  whites. However, I will do what I can for you, for the sake of my  mother's sister and of our kinship.\"    On the way up the hills Soyera stopped, several times, to pick  berries. When they halted she went aside and pounded them, and then  boiled them in some water in a lota--a copper vessel--Sufder lent  her for the purpose, and dyed the child's head and body with it,  producing a colour corresponding to her own.    The party, which was composed of men from several towns and  villages, broke up the next morning.    \"Have you money?\" Sufder asked her, as she was about to start alone  on her journey.    \"Yes; my savings were all lodged for me, by Major Lindsay, with  some merchants at Bombay; but I have twenty rupees sewn up in my  garments.\"    \"As to your savings, Soyera, you are not likely to see them again,  for we shall make a clean sweep of Bombay. However, twenty rupees  will be useful to you, and would keep you for three or four months,  if you needed but, as you are going to my wife, you will not want  them.    \"Take this dagger. When you show it to her, she will know that you  come from me; but mind, she is, like most women, given to gossip;  therefore I warn you not to let her into the secret of this child's  birth, for if you did so, half the town would know it in the course  of a day or two.    \"Now, I must go back with my men to join a party who are on their  way to fight the English. I should have gone there direct, but met  the others starting on this marauding expedition, which was so much  to the taste of my men that I could not restrain them from joining.  I shall see you at Jooneer, as soon as matters are finished with  the English; then I shall, after staying a few days there, rejoin  Scindia, in whose service I am.\"    Soyera started on her way. At the villages through which she  passed, she was questioned as to where she came from; and replied  that she had been living down near Bombay but, now that the English  were going to fight the Mahrattas, she was coming home, having lost  her husband a few months before.    As the road to Jooneer diverged widely from that to Poona, she was  asked no questions about the war. All were confident that the  defeat of the English was certain, now that Scindia and Holkar and  the government of the Peishwa had laid aside their mutual  jealousies, and had joined for the purpose of crushing the whites.    On arriving, after two days' journey, at Jooneer, she went to the  address that Sufder had given her; but was coldly received by his  wife.    \"As it is Sufder's order, of course I must take you in,\" she said,  \"but when he returns, I shall tell him that I do not want another  woman and child in the house. Why do you not go to your own people?  As you are Sufder's cousin, you must be the sister of Ramdass. Why  should you not go to him?\"    \"I will gladly do so, if you will tell me where he lives.\"    \"He has a small farm. You must have passed it, as you came along.  It is about a mile from here.\"    \"I will go to him at once,\" Soyera said.    \"No, no,\" the woman exclaimed; \"that will"]]]
