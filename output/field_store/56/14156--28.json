But the quality of the subject is not the only justification for a  record. What one has truly felt, if only it can be made sensible to  others, is always of importance to one's fellow men. If pictures which  have taken shape in memory can be brought out in words, they are worth a  place in literature.    It is as literary material that I offer my memory pictures. To take them  as an attempt at autobiography would be a mistake. In such a view these  reminiscences would appear useless as well as incomplete.          (2) _Teaching Begins_      We three boys were being brought up together. Both my companions were  two years older than I. When they were placed under their tutor, my  teaching also began, but of what I learnt nothing remains in my memory.    What constantly recurs to me is \"The rain patters, the leaf quivers.\"[1]  I am just come to anchor after crossing the stormy region of the  _kara_, _khala_[2] series; and I am reading \"The rain patters, the leaf  quivers,\" for me the first poem of the Arch Poet. Whenever the joy of  that day comes back to me, even now, I realise why rhyme is so needful  in poetry. Because of it the words come to an end, and yet end not; the  utterance is over, but not its ring; and the ear and the mind can go on  and on with their game of tossing the rhyme to each other. Thus did the  rain patter and the leaves quiver again and again, the live-long day in  my consciousness.    Another episode of this period of my early boyhood is held fast in my  mind.    We had an old cashier, Kailash by name, who was like one of the family.  He was a great wit, and would be constantly cracking jokes with  everybody, old and young; recently married sons-in-law, new comers into  the family circle, being his special butts. There was room for the  suspicion that his humour had not deserted him even after death. Once my  elders were engaged in an attempt to start a postal service with the  other world by means of a planchette. At one of the sittings the pencil  scrawled out the name of Kailash. He was asked as to the sort of life  one led where he was. Not a bit of it, was the reply. \"Why should you  get so cheap what I had to die to learn?\"    This Kailash used to rattle off for my special delectation a doggerel  ballad of his own composition. The hero was myself and there was a  glowing anticipation of the arrival of a heroine. And as I listened my  interest would wax intense at the picture of this world-charming bride  illuminating the lap of the future in which she sat enthroned. The list  of the jewellery with which she was bedecked from head to foot, and the  unheard of splendour of the preparations for the bridal, might have  turned older and wiser heads; but what moved the boy, and set wonderful  joy pictures flitting before his vision, was the rapid jingle of the  frequent rhymes and the swing of the rhythm.    These two literary delights still linger in my memory--and there is the  other, the infants' classic: \"The rain falls pit-a-pat, the tide comes  up the river.\"    The next thing I remember is the beginning of my school-life. One day I  saw my elder brother, and my sister's son Satya, also a little older  than myself, starting off to school, leaving me behind, accounted unfit.  I had never before ridden in a carriage nor even been out of the house.  So when Satya came back, full of unduly glowing accounts of his  adventures on the way, I felt I simply could not stay at home. Our tutor  tried to dispel my illusion with sound advice and a resounding slap:  \"You're crying to go to school now, you'll have to cry a lot more to be  let off later on.\" I have no recollection of the name, features or  disposition of this tutor of ours, but the impression of his weighty  advice and weightier hand has not yet faded. Never in my life have I  heard a truer prophecy.    My crying drove me prematurely into the Oriental Seminary. What I learnt  there I have no idea, but one of its methods of punishment I still bear  in mind. The boy who was unable to repeat his lessons was made to stand  on a bench with arms extended, and on his upturned palms were piled a  number of slates. It is for psychologists to debate how far this method  is likely to conduce to a better grasp of things. I thus began my  schooling at an extremely tender age.    My initiation into literature had its origin, at the same time, in the  books which were in vogue in the servants' quarters. Chief among these  were a Bengali translation of Chanakya's aphorisms, and the Ramayana of  Krittivasa.    A picture of one day's reading of the Ramayana comes clearly back to me.    [Illustration: Rabindranath Tagore in 1877]    The day was a cloudy one. I was playing about in the long verandah[3]  overlooking the road. All of a sudden Satya, for some reason I do not  remember, wanted to frighten me by shouting, \"Policeman! Policeman!\" My  ideas of the duties of policemen were of an extremely vague description.  One thing I was certain about, that a person charged with crime once  placed in a policeman's hands would, as sure as the wretch caught in a  crocodile's serrated grip, go under and be seen no more. Not knowing how  an innocent boy could escape this relentless penal code, I bolted  towards the inner apartments, with shudders running down my back for  blind fear of pursuing policemen. I broke to my mother the news of my  impending doom, but it did not seem to disturb her much. However, not  deeming it safe to venture out again, I sat down on the sill of my  mother's door to read the dog-eared Ramayana, with a marbled paper  cover, which belonged to her old aunt. Alongside stretched the verandah  running round the four sides of the open inner quadrangle, on which had  fallen the faint afternoon glow of the clouded sky, and finding me  weeping over one of its sorrowful situations my great-aunt came and took  away the book from me.          (3) _Within and Without_      Luxury was a thing almost unknown in the days of my infancy. The  standard of living was then, as a whole, much more simple than it is  now. Apart from that, the children of our household were entirely free  from the fuss of being too much looked after. The fact is that, while  the process of looking after may be an occasional treat for the  guardians, to the children it is always an unmitigated nuisance.    We used to be under the rule of the servants. To save themselves trouble  they had almost suppressed our right of free movement. But the freedom  of not being petted made up even for the harshness of this bondage, for  our minds were left clear of the toils of constant coddling, pampering  and dressing-up.    Our food had nothing to do with delicacies. A list of our articles of  clothing would only invite the modern boy's scorn. On no pretext did we  wear socks or shoes till we had passed our tenth year. In the cold  weather a second cotton tunic over the first one sufficed. It never  entered our heads to consider ourselves ill-off for that reason. It was  only when old Niyamat, the tailor, would forget to put a pocket into one  of our tunics that we complained, for no boy has yet been born so poor  as not to have the wherewithal to stuff his pockets; nor, by a merciful  dispensation of providence, is there much difference between the wealth  of boys of rich and of poor parentage. We used to have a pair of  slippers each, but not always where we had our feet. Our habit of  kicking the slippers on ahead, and catching them up again, made them  work none the less hard, through effectually defeating at every step the  reason of their being.    Our elders were in every way at a great distance from us, in their dress  and food, living and doing, conversation and amusement. We caught  glimpses of these, but they were beyond our reach. Elders have become  cheap to modern children; they are too readily accessible, and so are  all objects of desire. Nothing ever came so easily to us. Many a trivial  thing was for us a rarity, and we lived mostly in the hope of attaining,  when we were old enough, the things which the distant future held in  trust for us. The result was that what little we did get we enjoyed to  the utmost; from skin to core nothing was thrown away. The modern child  of a well-to-do family nibbles at only half the things he gets; the  greater part of his world is wasted on him.    Our days were spent in the servants' quarters in the south-east corner  of the outer apartments. One of our servants was Shyam, a dark chubby  boy with curly locks, hailing from the District of Khulna. He would put  me into a selected spot and, tracing a chalk line all round, warn me  with solemn face and uplifted finger of the perils of transgressing this  ring. Whether the threatened danger was material or spiritual I never  fully understood, but a great fear used to possess me. I had read in the  Ramayana of the tribulations of Sita for having left the ring drawn by  Lakshman, so it was not possible for me to be sceptical of its potency.    Just below the window of this room was a tank with a flight of masonry  steps leading down into the water; on its west bank, along the garden  wall, an immense banyan tree; to the south a fringe of cocoanut palms.  Ringed round as I was near this window I would spend the whole day  peering through the drawn Venetian shutters, gazing and gazing on this  scene as on a picture book. From early morning our neighbours would drop  in one by one to have their bath. I knew the time for each one to  arrive. I was familiar with the peculiarities of each one's toilet. One  would stop up his ears with his fingers as he took his regulation number  of dips, after which he would depart. Another would not venture on a  complete immersion but be content with only squeezing his wet towel  repeatedly over his head. A third would carefully drive the surface  impurities away from him with a rapid play of "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22224"],[0,"At Aboukir and Acre: A Story of Napoleon's Invasion of Egypt (#2)"],[1,", who were some eighteen months younger than  himself; after that he was free to wander about the house or to go into  the streets, provided that one of the grooms, either Hammed or Abdul,  accompanied him. When at thirteen he was sent to England to stay with an  uncle and to go through a couple of years' schooling, he entered a world  so wholly unlike that in which he himself had been brought up, that for  a time he seemed completely out of his element.    His father had an excellent library, and during the heat of the day the  boy had got through a great deal of reading, and was vastly better  acquainted with standard English writers than his cousins or  school-fellows, but of ordinary school work he was absolutely ignorant,  and at first he was much laughed at for his deficiencies in Latin and  Greek. The latter he never attempted, but his knowledge of Italian  helped him so greatly with his Latin that in a very few months he went  through class after class, until he was fully up to the level of other  boys of his age. His uncle lived in the suburbs of London, and he went  with his cousins to St. Paul's. At that time prize-fighting was the  national sport, and his father had, when he sent him over, particularly  requested his uncle to obtain a good teacher for him.    \"Whether Edgar will stay out here for good, Tom, I cannot say, but  whether he does or not, I should like him to be able to box well. In  England every gentleman in our day learns to use his fists, while out  here it is of very great advantage that a man should be able to do so.  We have a mixed population here, and a very shady one. Maltese, Greeks,  Italians, and French, and these probably the very scum of the various  seaports of the Mediterranean, therefore to be able to hit quick and  straight from the shoulder may well save a man's life. Of course he is  young yet, but if he goes regularly for an hour two or three times a  week to one of the light-weight men, I have no doubt that when he  returns he will be able to astonish any of these street ruffians who may  interfere with him.    \"Even if he is never called upon to use his fists, it will do him a  great deal of good, for boxing gives a quickness and readiness not only  of hands, but of thought, that is of great service; and moreover, the  exercise improves the figure, and is, in that respect, I think, fully  equal to fencing. Please put this matter in hand as soon as he arrives.  As to his studies, I own that I care very little; the boy speaks  half-a-dozen languages, any one of which is vastly more useful to a  resident here than Latin and Greek together. Naturally he will learn  Latin. Of course his Italian will facilitate this, and it is part of a  gentleman's education to be able to understand a quotation or turn a  phrase in it. Still, it is not for this that I send him to England, but  to become an English boy, and that your Bob and Arthur and his  school-fellows will teach him.\"    Edgar was quite as much surprised at his cousins and school-fellows as  they were with him. The fact that he could talk half-a-dozen languages  was to them amazing, while not less astonishing to him was their  ignorance of the affairs of Europe except, indeed, of the French  Revolution--their vagueness in geography, and the absolute blank of  their minds as to Egypt. It was not until three months after his arrival  that he had his first fight, and the instructions he had received during  that time sufficed to enable him to win so easy a victory, that it was  some months before he had again occasion to use his fists in earnest.  This time it was in the streets. He was returning home with his cousins,  when a pert young clerk thought it a good joke to twitch off his cap and  throw it into a shop, and was astounded when, before the cap had reached  the floor, he himself was prostrate on the pavement.    He was no coward, however, and leapt up, furious, to punish this boy of  fourteen, but in spite of his superior strength and weight, he was no  match for Edgar, whose quickness on his legs enabled him to avoid his  rushes, while he planted his blows so quickly and heavily that in ten  minutes the clerk was unable to see out of his eyes, and had to be led  away amid the jeers of the crowd. This success increased Edgar's ardour  to perfect himself in the art. If he could so easily defeat an English  lad of seventeen, he felt sure that after another year's teaching he  need not fear an attack by the greatest ruffian in Alexandria. His  uncle had taken advice on the subject, and, desirous of carrying out his  brother's instructions to the fullest, changed his master every six  months; so that during the two years and a half that he was in England  Edgar had learned all that the five most skilled light-weight pugilists  in England could teach him.    \"Yes, he is going in for it thoroughly,\" his uncle would say to his  friends. \"Of course, I shall have my own boys taught in another three or  four years, for I think that every gentleman should be able to defend  himself if assaulted by a street ruffian; but in his case he has to  learn when quite young or not at all, and I think that it will be very  useful to him, as all these foreign fellows draw their knives on the  least occasion.\"    When Edgar returned to Alexandria, nine months before the time when he  and Sidi were watching Nelson's fleet, his father was well pleased with  the change that had taken place in him. He had been tall for his age  before he left, now he had not only grown considerably, but had widened  out. He was still far from being what may be called a squarely-built  boy, but he was of a fair width across the shoulders, and was a picture  of health and activity. The muscles of his arms, shoulders, and loins  were as tough as steel, his complexion was fresh and clear, and he had  scarce an ounce of superfluous flesh upon him.    \"Save for your complexion, Edgar, you might well pass as a young Bedouin  if you were to wrap yourself up in their garb. I see you have profited  well by your teachers' instructions. Your uncle wrote to me a year ago  that you had administered a sound thrashing to a fellow seventeen years  old who had meddled with you, and as, no doubt, you have improved in  skill and strength since that time, I should think that you need have no  fear of holding your own should you get into trouble with any of these  street ruffians.\"    \"I should hope so, father; at any rate I should not mind trying. I know  that I could hold my own pretty fairly with young Jackson. They call him  the 'Bantam'. He is the champion light-weight now, though he does not  fight above nine stone, so there is not much difference between us in  weight.\"    \"Good! and how about your school work?\"    \"Oh, I did pretty well, father! I was good in Latin, but I was nowhere  in figures.\"    \"Not grown quarrelsome, I hope, on the strength of your fighting,  Edgar?\"    \"No, sir, I hope not. I never had a fight at school except the one I had  three months after I got there, and I only had that one row you speak of  with a clerk. I don't think it would be fair, you see, to get into rows  with fellows who have no idea how thoroughly I have been taught.\"    His father nodded.    \"Quite right, Edgar. My ideas are that a man who can box well is much  less likely to get into quarrels than one who cannot. He knows what he  can do, and that, if forced to use his skill, he is able to render a  good account of himself, and therefore he can afford to put up with  more, than one who is doubtful as to whether he is likely to come well  out of a fight if he begins one.\"    Edgar found on his arrival at Alexandria that his mother and sisters  were about to leave for England. Mrs. Blagrove had become seriously  indisposed, the result, as she maintained, of the climate, but which was  far more due to her indolent habits, for she never took any exercise  whatever. Her general health was greatly impaired, and the two Italian  doctors who attended her--there being no English medical men resident  there--had most strongly advised that she should return home. They had  frankly told Mr. Blagrove that a colder climate was absolutely necessary  to her, not only because it would brace her up and act as a tonic, but  because she would probably there be induced to take a certain amount of  exercise. The two girls were to accompany her, in order that they  should, like Edgar, enjoy the advantage of going to an English school  and mixing with English girls of their own age. They, too, had both felt  the heat during the preceding summer, and Mr. Blagrove felt that a stay  of two or three years in England would be an immense advantage to them.    Mrs. Blagrove was to stay with her father, a clergyman in the west of  England, for a few months, when her husband intended himself to go over  for a time. The war had much reduced business, the activity of the  French privateers rendered communication irregular and precarious, the  rates both for freight and insurance were very high, the number of  vessels entering the port were but a tithe of those that frequented it  before the outbreak of the war, and as no small part of Mr. Blagrove's  business consisted in supplying vessels with such stores as they needed,  his operations were so restricted that he felt he could, without any  great loss, leave the management of his affairs in the hands of his  chief assistant, a German, who had been with him for twenty years, and  in whom he placed the greatest reliance.    Edgar would be there to assist generally, and his father thought that it  would even benefit him to be placed for a time in a responsible  position. It was, of course, a great disappointment to Edgar to find  that his mother and the girls were on the point of returning. Their  departure, indeed, had been decided upon somewhat suddenly owing to a  strongly-armed English privateer, commanded by an old acquaintance of  Mr. Blagrove, coming"]]]
