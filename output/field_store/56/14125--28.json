No woman calling herself  a Christian, acknowledging her duties as such, can, therefore,  consistently deny the obligation of a limited subordination laid upon  her by her Lord and His Church.    From these three chief considerations--the great inferiority of  physical strength, a very much less and undefined degree of inferiority  in intellect, and the salutary teachings of the Christian faith--it  follows that, to a limited degree, varying with circumstances, and  always to be marked out by sound reason and good feeling, the  subordination of woman, as a sex, is inevitable.    This subordination once established, a difference of position, and a  consequent difference of duties, follow as a matter of course. There  must, of necessity, in such a state of things, be certain duties  inalienably connected with the position of man, others inalienably  connected with the position of woman. For the one to assume the duties  of the other becomes, first, an act of desertion, next, an act of  usurpation. For the man to discharge worthily the duties of his own  position becomes his highest merit. For the woman to discharge worthily  the duties of her own position becomes her highest merit. To be noble  the man must be manly. To be noble the woman must be womanly.  Independently of the virtues required equally of both sexes, such as  truth, uprightness, candor, fidelity, honor, we look in man for  somewhat more of wisdom, of vigor, of courage, from natural endowment,  combined with enlarged action and experience. In woman we look more  especially for greater purity, modesty, patience, grace, sweetness,  tenderness, refinement, as the consequences of a finer organization, in  a protected and sheltered position. That state of society will always  be the most rational, the soundest, the happiest, where each sex  conscientiously discharges its own duties, without intruding on those  of the other.    It is true that the world has often seen individual women called by the  manifest will of Providence to positions of the highest authority, to  the thrones of rulers and sovereigns. And many of these women have  discharged those duties with great intellectual ability and great  success. It is rather the fashion now among literary men to depreciate  Queen Elizabeth and her government. But it is clear that, whatever may  have been her errors--and no doubt they were grave--she still appears  in the roll of history as one of the best sovereigns not only of her  own house, but of all the dynasties of England. Certainly she was in  every way a better and a more successful ruler than her own father or  her own brother-in-law, and better also than the Stuarts who filled her  throne at a later day. Catherine of Russia, though most unworthy as a  woman, had a force of intellectual ability quite beyond dispute, and  which made itself felt in every department of her government. Isabella  I. of Spain gave proof of legislative and executive ability of the very  highest order; she was not only one of the purest and noblest, but  also, considering the age to which she belonged, and the obstacles in  her way, one of the most skillful sovereigns the world has ever seen.  Her nature was full of clear intelligence, with the highest moral and  physical courage. She was in every way a better ruler than her own  husband, to whom she proved nevertheless an admirable wife, acting  independently only where clear principle was at stake. The two greet  errors of her reign, the introduction of the Inquisition and the  banishment of the Jews, must be charged to the confessor rather than to  the Queen, and these were errors in which her husband was as closely  involved as herself. On the other hand, some of the best reforms of her  reign originated in her own mind, and were practically carried out  under her own close personal supervision. Many other skillful female  rulers might be named. And it is not only in civilized life and in  Christendom that woman has shown herself wise in governing; even among  the wildest savage tribes they have appeared, occasionally, as leaders  and rulers. This is a singular fact. It may be proved from the history  of this continent, and not only from the early records of Mexico and  Cuba and Hayti, but also from the reports of the earliest navigators on  our own coast, who here and there make mention incidentally of this or  that female chief or sachem. But a fact far more impressive and truly  elevating to the sex also appears on authority entirely indisputable.  While women are enjoined by the Word of God to refrain from public  teaching in the Church, there have been individual women included among  the Prophets, speaking under the direct influence of the Most Holy  Spirit of God, the highest dignity to which human nature can attain.  But all these individual cases, whether political or religious, have  been exceptional. The lesson to be learned from them is plain. We  gather naturally from these facts, what may be learned also from other  sources, that, while the positions of the two sexes are as such  distinct, the one a degree superior, the other a degree inferior, the  difference between them is limited--it is not impassable in individual  cases. The two make up but one species, one body politic and religious.  There are many senses besides marriage in which the two are one. It is  the right hand and the left, both belonging to one body, moved by  common feeling, guided by common reason. The left hand may at times be  required to do the work of the right, the right to act as the left.  Even in this world there are occasions when the last are first, the  first last, without disturbing the general order of things. These  exceptional cases temper the general rule, but they can not abrogate  that rule as regards the entire sex. Man learns from them not to  exaggerate his superiority--a lesson very often needed. And woman  learns from them to connect self-respect and dignity with true  humility, and never, under any circumstances, to sink into the mere  tool and toy of man--a lesson equally important.    Such until the present day has been the general teaching and practice  of Christendom, where, under a mild form, and to a limited point, the  subordination of woman has been a fact clearly established. But this  teaching we are now called upon to forget, this practice we are  required to abandon. We have arrived at the days foretold by the  Prophet, when \"knowledge shall be increased, and many shall run to and  fro.\" The intellectual progress of the race during the last half  century has indeed been great.  But admiration is not the only feeling  of the thoughtful mind when observing this striking advance in  intellectual acquirement. We see that man has not yet fully mastered  the knowledge he has acquired. He runs to and fro. He rushes from one  extreme to the other. How many chapters of modern history, both  political and religious, are full of the records of this mental  vacillation of our race, of this illogical and absurd tendency to pass  from one extreme to the point farthest from it!    An adventurous party among us, weary of the old paths, is now eagerly  proclaiming theories and doctrines entirely novel on this important  subject. The EMANCIPATION OF WOMAN is the name chosen by its advocates  for this movement. They reject the idea of all subordination, even in  the mildest form, with utter scorn. They claim for woman absolute  social and political equality with man. And they seek to secure these  points by conferring on the whole sex the right of the elective  franchise, female suffrage being the first step in the unwieldy  revolutions they aim at bringing about. These views are no longer  confined to a small sect. They challenge our attention at every turn.  We meet them in society; we read them in the public prints; we hear of  them in grave legislative assemblies, in the Congress of the Republic,  in the Imperial Parliament of Great Britain. The time has come when it  is necessary that all sensible and conscientious men and women should  make up their minds clearly on a subject bearing upon the future  condition of the entire race.    There is generally more than one influence at work in all public  movements of importance. The motive power in such cases is very seldom  simple. So it has been with the question of female suffrage. The abuses  inflicted on woman by legislation, the want of sufficient protection  for her interests when confided to man, are generally asserted by the  advocates of female suffrage as the chief motives for a change in the  laws which withhold from her the power of voting. But it is also  considered by the friend of the new movement that to withhold the  suffrage from half the race is an inconsistency in American politics;  that suffrage is an inalienable right, universal in its application;  that women are consequently deprived of a great natural right when  denied the power of voting. A third reason is also given for this  proposed change in our political constitution. It is asserted that the  entire sex would be greatly elevated in intellectual and moral dignity  by such a course; and that the effect on the whole race would therefore  be most advantageous, as the increased influence of woman in public  affairs would purify politics, and elevate the whole tone of political  life. Here we have the reason for this movement as advanced by its  advocates. These are the points on which they lay the most stress:    FIRST. The abuse of legislative power in man, by oppressing the sex.    SECONDLY. The inalienable natural right of woman to vote; and  imperatively so in a country where universal suffrage is a great  political principle.    THIRDLY. The elevation of the sex, and the purification of politics"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/216"],[0,"The Tao Teh King, or the Tao and its Characteristics (#2)"],[1,"were thus beyond men's  knowledge, I will make an effort to describe of what sort they  appeared to be.    2. Shrinking looked they like those who wade through a stream in  winter; irresolute like those who are afraid of all around them; grave  like a guest (in awe of his host); evanescent like ice that is melting  away; unpretentious like wood that has not been fashioned into  anything; vacant like a valley, and dull like muddy water.    3. Who can (make) the muddy water (clear)?  Let it be still, and it  will gradually become clear.  Who can secure the condition of rest?  Let movement go on, and the condition of rest will gradually arise.    4. They who preserve this method of the Tao do not wish to be full (of  themselves).  It is through their not being full of themselves that  they can afford to seem worn and not appear new and complete.      16. 1. The (state of) vacancy should be brought to the utmost degree,  and that of stillness guarded with unwearying vigour.  All things  alike go through their processes of activity, and (then) we see them  return (to their original state).  When things (in the vegetable  world) have displayed their luxuriant growth, we see each of them  return to its root.  This returning to their root is what we call the  state of stillness; and that stillness may be called a reporting that  they have fulfilled their appointed end.    2. The report of that fulfilment is the regular, unchanging rule.  To  know that unchanging rule is to be intelligent; not to know it leads  to wild movements and evil issues.  The knowledge of that unchanging  rule produces a (grand) capacity and forbearance, and that capacity  and forbearance lead to a community (of feeling with all things).  From this community of feeling comes a kingliness of character; and he  who is king-like goes on to be heaven-like.  In that likeness to  heaven he possesses the Tao.  Possessed of the Tao, he endures long;  and to the end of his bodily life, is exempt from all danger of decay.      17. 1. In the highest antiquity, (the people) did not know that there  were (their rulers).  In the next age they loved them and praised  them.  In the next they feared them; in the next they despised them.  Thus it was that when faith (in the Tao) was deficient (in the rulers)  a want of faith in them ensued (in the people).    2. How irresolute did those (earliest rulers) appear, showing (by  their reticence) the importance which they set upon their words!  Their work was done and their undertakings were successful, while the  people all said, 'We are as we are, of ourselves!'      18. 1. When the Great Tao (Way or Method) ceased to be observed,  benevolence and righteousness came into vogue.  (Then) appeared wisdom  and shrewdness, and there ensued great hypocrisy.    2. When harmony no longer prevailed throughout the six kinships,  filial sons found their manifestation; when the states and clans fell  into disorder, loyal ministers appeared.      19. 1. If we could renounce our sageness and discard our wisdom, it  would be better for the people a hundredfold.  If we could renounce  our benevolence and discard our righteousness, the people would again  become filial and kindly.  If we could renounce our artful  contrivances and discard our (scheming for) gain, there would be no  thieves nor robbers.    2.       Those three methods (of government)     Thought olden ways in elegance did fail     And made these names their want of worth to veil;     But simple views, and courses plain and true     Would selfish ends and many lusts eschew.      20.    1.       When we renounce learning we have no troubles.     The (ready) 'yes,' and (flattering) 'yea;'--     Small is the difference they display.     But mark their issues, good and ill;--     What space the gulf between shall fill?    What all men fear is indeed to be feared; but how wide and without end  is the range of questions (asking to be discussed)!    2. The multitude of men look satisfied and pleased; as if enjoying a  full banquet, as if mounted on a tower in spring.  I alone seem  listless and still, my desires having as yet given no indication of  their presence.  I am like an infant which has not yet smiled.  I look  dejected and forlorn, as if I had no home to go to.  The multitude of  men all have enough and to spare.  I alone seem to have lost  everything.  My mind is that of a stupid man; I am in a state of  chaos.    Ordinary men look bright and intelligent, while I alone seem to be  benighted.  They look full of discrimination, while I alone am dull  and confused.  I seem to be carried about as on the sea, drifting as  if I had nowhere to rest.  All men have their spheres of action, while  I alone seem dull and incapable, like a rude borderer.  (Thus) I alone  am different from other men, but I value the nursing-mother (the Tao).      21.        The grandest forms of active force      From Tao come, their only source.      Who can of Tao the nature tell?      Our sight it flies, our touch as well.      Eluding sight, eluding touch,      The forms of things all in it crouch;      Eluding touch, eluding sight,      There are their semblances, all right.      Profound it is, dark and obscure;      Things' essences all there endure.      Those essences the truth enfold      Of what, when seen, shall then be told.      Now it is so; 'twas so of old.      Its name--what passes not away;      So, in their beautiful array,      Things form and never know decay.    How know I that it is so with all the beauties of existing things?  By  this (nature of the Tao).      22. 1. The partial becomes complete; the crooked, straight; the empty,  full; the worn out, new.  He whose (desires) are few gets them; he  whose (desires) are many goes astray.    2. Therefore the sage holds in his embrace the one thing (of  humility), and manifests it to all the world.  He is free from  self-display, and therefore he shines; from self-assertion, and  therefore he is distinguished; from self-boasting, and therefore his  merit is acknowledged; from self-complacency, and therefore he  acquires superiority.  It is because he is thus free from striving  that therefore no one in the world is able to strive with him.    3. That saying of the ancients that 'the partial becomes complete' was  not vainly spoken:--all real completion is comprehended under it.      23. 1. Abstaining from speech marks him who is obeying the spontaneity  of his nature.  A violent wind does not last for a whole morning; a  sudden rain does not last for the whole day.  To whom is it that these  (two) things are owing?  To Heaven and Earth.  If Heaven and Earth  cannot make such (spasmodic) actings last long, how much less can man!    2. Therefore when one is making the Tao his business, those who are  also pursuing it, agree with him in it, and those who are making the  manifestation of its course their object agree with him in that; while  even those who are failing in both these things agree with him where  they fail.    3. Hence, those with whom he agrees as to the Tao have the happiness  of attaining to it; those with whom he agrees as to its manifestation  have the happiness of attaining to it; and those with whom he agrees  in their failure have also the happiness of attaining (to the Tao).  (But) when there is not faith sufficient (on his part), a want of  faith (in him) ensues (on the part of the others).      24. He who stands on his tiptoes does not stand firm; he who stretches  his legs does not walk (easily).  (So), he who displays himself does  not shine; he who asserts his own views is not distinguished; he who  vaunts himself does not find his merit acknowledged; he who is  self-conceited has no superiority allowed to him.  Such conditions,  viewed from the standpoint of the Tao, are like remnants of food, or a  tumour on the body, which all dislike.  Hence those who pursue (the  course) of the Tao do not adopt and allow them.      25. 1. There was something undefined and complete, coming into  existence before Heaven and Earth.  How still it was and formless,  standing alone, and undergoing no change, reaching everywhere and in  no danger (of being exhausted)!  It may be regarded as the Mother of  all things.    2. I do not know its name, and I give it the designation of the Tao  (the Way or Course).  Making an effort (further) to give it a name I  call it The Great.    3. Great, it passes on (in constant flow).  Passing on, it becomes  remote.  Having become remote, it returns.  Therefore the Tao is  great; Heaven is great; Earth is great; and the (sage) king is also  great.  In the universe there are four that are great, and the (sage)  king is one of them.    4. Man takes his law from the Earth; the Earth takes its law from  Heaven; Heaven takes its law from the Tao.  The law of the Tao is its  being what it is.      26. 1. Gravity is the root of lightness; stillness, the ruler of  movement.    2. Therefore a wise prince, marching the whole day, does not go far  from his baggage waggons.  Although he may have brilliant prospects to  look at, he quietly remains (in his proper place), indifferent to  them.  How should the lord of a myriad chariots carry himself lightly  before the kingdom?  If he do act lightly, he has lost his root (of  gravity); if he proceed to active movement, he will lose his throne.      27. 1. The skilful traveller leaves no traces of his wheels or  footsteps; the skilful speaker says nothing that can be found fault  with or blamed; the skilful reckoner uses no tallies; the skilful  closer needs no bolts or bars, while to open what he has shut will be  impossible; the skilful binder uses no strings or knots, while to  unloose what he has bound will be impossible.  In the same way the  sage is always skilful at saving men, and so he does not cast away any  man; he is always skilful at saving things, and so he does not cast  away anything.  This is called 'Hiding the light of his"]]]
