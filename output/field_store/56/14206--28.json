They had brandy at the corn shuckin'  and I herd Sam talkin' about gittin' drunk.    I 'member one 'oman dying. Her name wuz Caroline Covington. I didn't go  to the grave. But you know they had a little cart used with hosses to  carry her to the grave, jist a one horse wagon, jist slipped her in  there.    Yes, I 'member a field song. It wuz 'Oh! come let us go where pleasure  never dies. Great fountain gone over'. Dat's one uv 'em. We had a good  doctor when we got sick. He come to see us. The slaves took herbs dey  found in de woods. Dat's what I do now, Sir. I got some 'erbs right in  my kitchen now.    When the Yankees come through I did not know anything about 'em till  they got there. Jist like they were poppin up out of de ground. One of  the slaves wuz at his master's house you know, and he said, 'The Yankees  are in Cheraw, S. C. [HW correction: South Carolina] and the Yankees are  in town'. It didn't sturb me at tall. I wuz not afraid of de Yankees. I  'member dey went to Miss Emma's house, and went in de smoke house and  emptied every barrel of 'lasses right in de floor and scattered de  cracklings on de floor. I went dere and got some of 'em. Miss Emma wuz  my missus. Dey just killed de chickens, hogs too, and old Jeff the dog;  they shot him through the thoat. I 'member how his mouth flew open when  dey shot him. One uv 'em went into de tater bank, and we chillun wanted  to go out dere. Mother wouldn't let us. She wuz fraid uv 'em.    Abraham Lincoln freed us by the help of the Lawd, by his help. Slavery  wuz owin to who you were with. If you were with some one who wuz good  and had some feelin's for you it did tolerable well; yea, tolerable  well.    We left the plantation soon as de surrender. We lef' right off. We went  to goin' towards Fayetteville, North Carolina. We climbed over fences  and were just broke down chillun, feet sore. We had a little meat, corn  meal, a tray, and mammy had a tin pan. One night we came to a old house;  some one had put wheat straw in it. We staid there, next mornin', we  come back home. Not to Marster's, but to a white 'oman named Peggy  McClinton, on her plantation. We stayed there a long time. De Yankees  took everything dey could, but dey didn't give us anything to eat. Dey  give some of de 'omen shoes.    I thinks Mr. Roosevelt is a fine man and he do all he can for us.

My mammy an' pappy, Hattie an' Jim Jeffries belonged to Marse Frank  Jeffries. Marse Frank come from Mississippi, but when I wuz bawn he an'  Mis' Mary Jane wuz livin' down herr near Louisburg in North Carolina  whare dey had er big plantation an' [HW addition: I] don' know how many  niggers. Marse Frank wuz good to his niggers, 'cept [HW addition: that]  he never give dem ernough to eat. He worked dem hard on half rations,  but he didn' believe in all de time beatin' an' sellin' dem.    My pappy worked at de stables, he wuz er good horseman, but my mammy  worked at de big house helpin' Mis' Mary Jane. Mammy worked in de  weavin' room. I can see her now settin' at de weavin' machine an' hear  de pedals goin' plop, plop, as she treaded dem wid her feets. She wuz a  good weaver. I stayed 'roun' de big house too, pickin' up chips,  sweepin' de yard an' such as dat. Mis' Mary Jane wuz quick as er  whippo'-will. She had black eyes dat snapped, an' dey seed everythin'.  She could turn her head so quick dat she'd ketch you every time you  tried to steal a lump of sugar. I liked Marse Frank better den I did  Mis' Mary Jane. All us little chillun called him Big Pappy. Every time  he went [HW correction: come back] to Raleigh he brung us niggers back  some candy. He went to Raleigh erbout twice er year. Raleigh wuz er far  ways from de plantations--near 'bout sixty miles. [HW notation:  check--appears to be about 40 miles only.] It always took Marse Frank  three days to make de trip. A day to go, er' day to stay in town, an' a  day to come back. Den he always got home in de night. Ceptn' [HW  addition: when] he rode ho'se back 'stead of de carriage, [HW addition:  an'] den sometimes he got home by sun down.    Marse Frank didn' go to de war. He wuz too ole. So when de Yankees come  through dey foun' him at home. When Marse Frank seed de blue coats  comin' down de road he run an' got his gun. De Yankees was on horses. I  ain't never seed so many men. Dey was thick as hornets comin' down de  road in a cloud of dus' [HW: correction \"dust\"]. Dey come up to de house  an' tied de horses to de palin's; [HW correction: dey was so many dey  was stan] 'roun' de yard [HW addition: fence]. When dey seed Marse Frank  standin' on de po'ch [HW correction: porch] wid de gun leveled on dem,  dey got mad. Time Marse Frank done shot one time [HW correction: \"once  a\"] a bully Yankee snatched de gun away an' tole Marse Frank to hold up  his hand. Den dey tied his hands an' pushed him down on de floor 'side  de house an' tole him dat if he moved [HW addition: a inch] dey would  shoot him. Den dey went in de house.    I wuz skeered near 'bout to death, but I run in de kitchen an' got a  butcher knife, an' when de Yankees wasn' lookin', I tried to cut de rope  an' set Marse Frank free. But one of dem blue debils seed me an' come  runnin'. He say:    'Whut you doin', you black brat! you stinkin' little alligator bait!' He  snatched de knife from my hand an' told me to stick out my tongue, dat  he wuz gwine to cut it off. I let out a yell an' run behin' de house.    Some of de Yankees was in de smoke house gettin' de meat, some of dem  wuz at de stables gettin' de ho'ses, an' some of dem wuz in de house  gettin' de silver an' things. I seed dem put de big silver pitcher an'  tea pot in a bag. Den dey took de knives an' fo'ks an' all de candle  sticks an' platters off de side board. Dey went in de parlor an' got de  gol' clock dat wuz Mis' Mary Jane's gran'mammy's. Den dey got all de  jewelry out of Mis' Mary Jane's box.    Dey went up to Mis' Mary Jane, an' while she looked at dem wid her black  eyes snappin', dey took de rings off her fingers; den dey took her gol'  bracelet; dey even took de ruby ear rings out of her ears an' de gol'  comb out of her hair.    I done quit peepin' in de window an' wuz standin' 'side de house when de  Yankees come out in de yard wid all de stuff dey wuz totin' off. Marse  Frank wuz still settin' on de po'ch [HW correction: porch] floor wid his  han's tied an' couldn' do nothin'. 'Bout dat time I seed de bee gums in  de side yard. Dey wuz a whole line of gums. Little as I wuz I had a  notion. I run an' got me a long stick an' tu'ned over every one of dem  gums. Den I stirred dem bees up wid dat stick 'twell [HW correction:  'till] dey wuz so mad I could smell de pizen. An' bees! you ain't never  seed de like of bees. Dey wuz swarmin' all over de place. Dey sailed  into dem Yankees like bullets, each one madder den de other. Dey lit on  dem ho'ses 'twell [HW correction: till] dey looked like dey wuz live [HW  correction: alive] wid varmints. De ho'ses broke dey bridles an' tore  down de palin's an' lit out down de road. But dey [HW correction: dar]  runnin' wuzn' nothin' to what dem Yankees done. Dey bust out cussin',  but what did a bee keer about cuss words! Dey lit on dem blue coats an'  every time dey lit dey stuck in a pizen sting. De Yankee's forgot all  about de meat an' things dey done stole; dey took off down de road on er  [HW correction: a] run, passin' de horses. De bees was right after dem  in a long line. Dey'd zoom an' zip, an' zoom an' zip, an' every time  dey'd zip a Yankee would yell.    When dey'd gone Mis' Mary Jane untied Marse Frank. Den dey took all de  silver, meat an' things de Yankees lef' behin' an' buried it so if dey  come back dey couldn' fin' it.    Den day called ma an' said:    'Ida Lee, if you hadn't tu'ned [HW correction: turned] over dem bee gums  dem Yankees would have toted off near 'bout everythin' fine we got. We  want to give you somethin' you can keep so' you'll always remember dis  day, an' how you run de Yankees away.'    Den Mis' Mary Jane took a plain gold ring off her finger an' put it on  mine.

It is impossible to determine the time when repairing the  church took place; however, this happened probably not before the  middle of the thirteenth century and in the then new style,  since called the Gothic order. This opinion is confirmed by the  ancient seal of our city, which likely enough and according to  the custom of those times, represents the front of the Cathedral.    That it had a tower in 1130 is a certain fact; for K[oe]nigscoven  speaks of its destruction by fire in the course of that year;  successive fires, in 1140, 1150, 1176 also materially injured the  beautiful edifice; besides, the continual wars and tumultuous  commotions of the time prevented the bishops from undertaking  essential repairs. It appears that these causes, by degrees,  brought on the complete ruin of bishop Wernher's constructions;  for unquestionably the part included between the nave and the two  towers dates but from the thirteenth century, and cannot have  been begun before the middle of it. What remained of the old  church was pulled down at that time and a new and more spacious  edifice was erected, built in the style then spreading over all  Europe. Considering the immense size of this monument, it is easy  to imagine that the work went on but slowly, and an old chronicle  mentions that on the 7th September 1275 they finished the middle  part of the superior arch-roofs, with the exception of the towers  in front. By whom these labours were directed is altogether  unknown.    It was bishop Conrad of Lichtenberg who undertook to rebuild the  parts that were still in a state of ruin and thus at last to  accomplish this great work of the Cathedral[1].      [1] \"... _Ipsa ecclesia in meliorum statuum reedificetur_ ...\"    (See a charter of bishop Conrad of Lichtenberg, published by M.    L. SPACE 1841, p. 6).    In order to execute this design, he published indulgences all  over the country; and after collecting large sums of money in the  town, he applied to the ecclesiastics of his diocese, asking  their own gifts and offerings as well as those of the faithful  under their direction; in a synod held in the diocese, the clergy  agreed to give up, during four years, a fourth part of their  revenues. Conrad entrusted the direction of this work to Master  Erwin of Steinbach, who, according to some old documents, was a  native of Mayence. This great architect began by rebuilding the  nave, the arch-roofs of which were completed in 1275. Then he  commenced the facade of the church and its towers from a plan so  bold and sublime that the conception of it places Erwin for ever  at the head of the architects of the middle age[1]. In 1276 they  laid the foundation of the northern tower; to consecrate the  spot, the bishop walked solemnly round it, then took a trowel in  his hand and thrust it into the ground, as a sign for beginning  the work. They relate that a quarrel having occured between two  workmen who both wished to work with the trowel the bishop had  held in his hand, one of them was killed. This murder was  considered as a very bad omen; Conrad ordered their labour to be  suspended for nine days; they were only resumed after he had  consecrated the place anew. The following year, on saint Urban's  day (25th May), Conrad himself laid the first stone of the tower.  In the midst of his warfares, this bishop always entertained much  affection for his Cathedral, as he beheld the gradual rising of  this _glorious work_, as an old inscription terms it[2]; in his  heartfelt joy he used to compare it to the flowers of May that  bloom in the sun[3]. To the very end of his life Conrad of  Lichtenberg neglected nothing to urge on the progress of his work  of predilection; after his death, in 1299, he received in it a  sepulchre worthy of him; his statue is still to be seen in saint  John's chapel. Yet, during the life of Conrad, the Cathedral was  shaken by several earthquakes in 1279, 1289, 1291; that of 1289  was so violent that the columns in the interior of the building  threatened for a moment to fall down. But a very favourable  circumstance happened in 1292, which was the surrender of the  _[OE]uvre-Notre-Dame_ to the magistrate of the city, who was  henceforth charged with the management of the revenues allotted  to the keeping in repair of the Church and consequently also to  the completion of it. A few years after, in 1298, a new  misfortune happened to the Cathedral. A fire, caused by the  imprudence of a cavalier of Albert I, during the sojourn of that  prince at Strasburg, consumed all the timberwork and threatened  even the pillars and walls. However the damage was promptly  repaired. In 1302 a bloody conflict between two citizens of the  town, which took place in the very chancel of the church,  required again a new consecration of it.      [1] They still preserve in the records of the convent of the    _[OE]uvre Notre-Dame_ several old drawings on parchment of the    facade and towers; these curious designs belong to different    epochs; according to the opinion of the _connaisseurs_, the    oldest would most likely be that of Erwin himself.      [2] _Anno Domini MCCLXXVII in die beati Urbani hoc gloriosum    opus inchoavit magister Erwinus de Steinbach._ This inscription    was formerly placed in the vault of the northern portal.      [3] In a letter of indulgence.    After the death of bishop Conrad of Lichtenberg, who in the year  1299 was killed in a battle near Friburg, his brother and  successor, Frederic, showed no less ardour for the continuation  of this building; in 1303 he invited the curates throughout  Alsacia to exhort those of their faithful parishioners who had  horses and carts, to convey stones for the edifice; in 1308 the  magistrate of Strasburg, no doubt at the request of bishop John,  promised freepasses to all those who would bring stones or wood,  and he secured wine and wheat for the workmen.    Erwin superintended the works until 1318, when he died on the  14th of January. All the children of this grand master were  artists worthy of him: Sabina, his daughter, carved several  statues for the Cathedral; one of his sons, who died in 1330,  built the fine church of Haslach; his other son, John, succeeded  him in directing the works of the Cathedral, and he died in 1339.  In 1331 bishop Berthold of Bucheck built the chapel of saint  Catherine, which also contains his tomb. The disturbances and  calamities that desolated Strasburg during a great part of the  fourteenth century, the revolution of 1332 that altered the form  of the government of the town, the ravage caused by the black  plague in 1349 with the insurrections accompanying it, the  contest of bishop Berthold with his chapter and with the emperor,  all this retarded of course the progress of the construction of  the Cathedral. Nevertheless they terminated in 1365 the northern  tower; K[oe]nigshoven calls it the new tower, perhaps, because  they purposed erecting a pyramid on it, which was quite an  innovation in the architecture of that time. The southern tower,  which the chronicler calls the ancient one, because it was not  intended to be raised higher, was finished at the same time. The  name of the artist who made the plan of the pyramid and spire of  the northern tower is still unknown; nor is it known who built  the steeple which formerly rose above the _grande rosace_, or  rose.    In 1368 the church was again struck by lightning without  receiving much damage; in 1384 a fire that broke out in the  organ, burnt all the interior with the exception of the chancel.  Ever since that time large vats were set in the different parts  of the building and guardians placed in the interior and in the  towers. In 1429, John Hueltz of Cologne was sent for to complete  this great work; ten years after, he finished the spire; on  Midsummer's day 1439, in the presence of a great multitude, he  laid the last stone, exactly a hundred and sixty two years after  Conrad of Lichtenberg had placed the first stone of this  monument; a statue of the Virgin Mary was also erected on the  knob terminating the spire[1].      [1] It was taken down in 1488.    At the time of the reformation the Cathedral passed over to the  protestants; it is true that on account of their worship, they  caused several chapels to be closed and some altars to be  removed, but they made no material change, nor spoiled any thing;  on the contrary, they watched with care over the magnificent  building and even caused important repairs to be made in it.  Several times it was very much injured by fire and by lightning,  particularly in the years 1540, 1555, 1568, 1624 and 1625. In  1654 the spire was destroyed by lightning; the skilful architect  Heckler was obliged to rebuild it sixty five feet high. By  the capitulation of 1681 the Cathedral was restored to the  catholics, who immediately began to repair it, but unfortunately  in that wretched style then prevailing, and when not the least  intelligence of christian art existed any longer, they pulled  down the lobby made by Erwin, so much admired in the middle age  as a masterpiece of elegance; in 1692 they adorned the interior  of the choir with wainscots of wood painted and gilt; in 1732  they widened it to the detriment of a portion of the nave, and  ten years later galleries were made for the orchestra. To punish,  as it would seem, those who were thus spoiling this wonderful  monument, an earthquake shook it in 1728; in 1759 it was struck  by lightning and considerably injured; the lead on the roof of  the nave was entirely melted, and the fine cupola or arched roof  that crowned the dome fell into pieces; the roof was then covered  with copper, but the cupola was not rebuilt. New destructions  awaited the"]]]
