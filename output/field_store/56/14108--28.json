I am not sure that the incessant search for  clues through this labyrinth would not end in analysis and disquisition,  that might be no great improvement even upon political history. Mr.  Gladstone said of reconstruction of the income-tax that he only did not  call the task herculean, because Hercules could not have done it.  Assuredly, I am not presumptuous enough to suppose that this difficulty  of fixing the precise scale between history and biography has been  successfully overcome by me. It may be that Hercules himself would have  succeeded little better.    Some may think in this connection that I have made the preponderance of  politics excessive in the story of a genius of signal versatility, to  whom politics were only one interest among many. No doubt speeches,  debates, bills, divisions, motions, and manoeuvres of party, like the  manna that fed the children of Israel in the wilderness, lose their  savour and power of nutriment on the second day. Yet after all it was to  his thoughts, his purposes, his ideals, his performances as statesman,  in all the widest significance of that lofty and honourable designation,  that Mr. Gladstone owes the lasting substance of his fame. His life was  ever '_greatly absorbed_,' he said, '_in working the institutions of his  country_.' Here we mark a signal trait. Not for two centuries, since the  historic strife of anglican and puritan, had our island produced a ruler  in whom the religious motive was paramount in the like degree. He was  not only a political force but a moral force. He strove to use all the  powers of his own genius and the powers of the state for moral purposes  and religious. Nevertheless his mission in all its forms was action. He  had none of that detachment, often found among superior minds, which we  honour for its disinterestedness, even while we lament its impotence in  result. The track in which he moved, the instruments that he employed,  were the track and the instruments, the sword and the trowel, of  political action; and what is called the Gladstonian era was  distinctively a political era.    On this I will permit myself a few words more. The detailed history of  Mr. Gladstone as theologian and churchman will not be found in these  pages, and nobody is more sensible than their writer of the gap. Mr.  Gladstone cared as much for the church as he cared for the state; he  thought of the church as the soul of the state; he believed the  attainment by the magistrate of the ends of government to depend upon  religion; and he was sure that the strength of a state corresponds to  the religious strength and soundness of the community of which the state  is the civil organ. I should have been wholly wanting in biographical  fidelity, not to make this clear and superabundantly clear. Still a  writer inside Mr. Gladstone's church and in full and active sympathy  with him on this side of mundane and supramundane things, would  undoubtedly have treated the subject differently from any writer  outside. No amount of candour or good faith--and in these essentials I  believe that I have not fallen short--can be a substitute for the  confidence and ardour of an adherent, in the heart of those to whom the  church stands first. Here is one of the difficulties of this complex  case. Yet here, too, there may be some trace of compensation. If the  reader has been drawn into the whirlpools of the political Charybdis, he  might not even in far worthier hands than mine have escaped the rocky  headlands of the ecclesiastic Scylla. For churches also have their  parties.    Lord Salisbury, the distinguished man who followed Mr. Gladstone in a  longer tenure of power than his, called him 'a great Christian'; and  nothing could be more true or better worth saying. He not only accepted  the doctrines of that faith as he believed them to be held by his own  communion; he sedulously strove to apply the noblest moralities of it  to the affairs both of his own nation and of the commonwealth of  nations. It was a supreme experiment. People will perhaps some day  wonder that many of those who derided the experiment and reproached its  author, failed to see that they were making manifest in this a wholesale  scepticism as to truths that they professed to prize, far deeper and  more destructive than the doubts and disbeliefs of the gentiles in the  outer courts.    The epoch, as the reader knows, was what Mr. Gladstone called 'an  agitated and expectant age.' Some stages of his career mark stages of  the first importance in the history of English party, on which so much  in the working of our constitution hangs. His name is associated with a  record of arduous and fruitful legislative work and administrative  improvement, equalled by none of the great men who have grasped the helm  of the British state. The intensity of his mind, and the length of years  through which he held presiding office, enabled him to impress for good  in all the departments of government his own severe standard of public  duty and personal exactitude. He was the chief force, propelling,  restraining, guiding his country at many decisive moments. Then how many  surprises and what seeming paradox. Devotedly attached to the church, he  was the agent in the overthrow of establishment in one of the three  kingdoms, and in an attempt to overthrow it in the Principality.  Entering public life with vehement aversion to the recent dislodgment of  the landed aristocracy as the mainspring of parliamentary power, he lent  himself to two further enormously extensive changes in the  constitutional centre of gravity. With a lifelong belief in  parliamentary deliberation as the grand security for judicious laws and  national control over executive act, he yet at a certain stage betook  himself with magical result to direct and individual appeal to the great  masses of his countrymen, and the world beheld the astonishing spectacle  of a politician with the microscopic subtlety of a thirteenth century  schoolman wielding at will the new democracy in what has been called  'the country of plain men.' A firm and trained economist, and no friend  to socialism, yet by his legislation upon land in 1870 and 1881 he  wrote the opening chapter in a volume on which many an unexpected page  in the history of Property is destined to be inscribed. Statesmen do far  less than they suppose, far less than is implied in their resounding  fame, to augment the material prosperity of nations, but in this  province Mr. Gladstone's name stands at the topmost height. Yet no ruler  that ever lived felt more deeply the truth--for which I know no better  words than Channing's--that to improve man's outward condition is not to  improve man himself; this must come from each man's endeavour within his  own breast; without that there can be little ground for social hope.  Well was it said to him, 'You have so lived and wrought that you have  kept the soul alive in England.' Not in England only was this felt. He  was sometimes charged with lowering the sentiment, the lofty and  fortifying sentiment, of national pride. At least it is a ground for  national pride that he, the son of English training, practised through  long years in the habit and tradition of English public life, standing  for long years foremost in accepted authority and renown before the eye  of England, so conquered imagination and attachment in other lands, that  when the end came it was thought no extravagance for one not an  Englishman to say, 'On the day that Mr. Gladstone died, the world has  lost its greatest citizen.' The reader who revolves all this will know  why I began by speaking of temerity.    That my book should be a biography without trace of bias, no reader will  expect. There is at least no bias against the truth; but indifferent  neutrality in a work produced, as this is, in the spirit of loyal and  affectionate remembrance, would be distasteful, discordant, and  impossible. I should be heartily sorry if there were no signs of  partiality and no evidence of prepossession. On the other hand there is,  I trust, no importunate advocacy or tedious assentation. He was great  man enough to stand in need of neither. Still less has it been needed,  in order to exalt him, to disparage others with whom he came into strong  collision. His own funeral orations from time to time on some who were  in one degree or another his antagonists, prove that this petty and  ungenerous method would have been to him of all men most repugnant. Then  to pretend that for sixty years, with all 'the varying weather of the  mind,' he traversed in every zone the restless ocean of a great nation's  shifting and complex politics, without many a faulty tack and many a  wrong reckoning, would indeed be idle. No such claim is set up by  rational men for Pym, Cromwell, Walpole, Washington, or either Pitt. It  is not set up for any of the three contemporaries of Mr. Gladstone whose  names live with the three most momentous transactions of his  age--Cavour, Lincoln, Bismarck. To suppose, again, that in every one of  the many subjects touched by him, besides exhibiting the range of his  powers and the diversity of his interests, he made abiding contributions  to thought and knowledge, is to ignore the jealous conditions under  which such contributions come. To say so much as this is to make but a  small deduction from the total of a grand account.    I have not reproduced the full text of Letters in the proportion  customary in English biography. The existing mass of his letters is  enormous. But then an enormous proportion of them touch on affairs of  public business, on which they shed little new light. Even when he  writes in his kindest and most cordial vein to friends to whom he is  most warmly attached, it is usually a letter of business. He deals  freely and genially with the points in hand, and then without play"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21102"],[0,"Tom and Some Other Girls: A Public School Story (#2)"],[1,"times Rhoda would put on her riding habit and go a ride round the  estate, taking care to emerge from the west gate at the moment when the  village children were returning from school.  The little girls would  \"bob\" in old-fashioned style, and the boys would pull off their caps,  and Rhoda would toss her flaxen mane and acknowledge their salutations  with a gracious smile and a wave of the little gloved hand.  The  children thought she looked like a fairy princess, and no more dreamt  that she was of the same flesh and blood as themselves than did Miss  Rhoda herself.  Then came lunch, and more often than not some excuse for  getting off the hour's lessons with Fraulein before the \"visiting  professors\" arrived.  Music master, drawing master, French master--they  each came in their turn, and Rhoda exerted herself to do her best, as  she invariably did, given the stimulus of an audience, and was praised  and flattered to her heart's desire.  It was a happy life, and most  satisfactory from the girl's point of view; so that it seemed most  annoying that it should be interrupted, and by Fraulein too, who had  always been so meek and tractable!  Who could have imagined when she  went home for the summer holidays that an old love would appear and  insist upon marrying her out of hand?    \"But what am _I_ to do?\" cried Rhoda, when the news was first received;  and then, in stern disapproval, \"I'm _surprised_ at Fraulein!  At her  age she should know better.  She always professed to be so devoted.  I  can't understand how she could make up her mind to leave me.\"    \"It must have been a terrible trial to her, dearest,\" said Mrs Chester  soothingly, and she meant what she said.  How could any one prefer a  fat, long-haired, spectacled lover (all Germans were fat, long-haired,  and spectacled!) to her beautiful, clever daughter?  She sighed, once  for Rhoda's disappointment, and once again, and with an added stab, for  herself.    Several times lately Mr Chester had hinted that Rhoda was getting too  much for Fraulein, and should be sent to school, while Harold had  treacherously seconded his father with remarks of such brotherly candour  as made his mother hot with indignation.  Jim was mercifully away from  home, but even so it was two against one, and she instinctively felt  that Fraulein's defection would be seized upon by the enemy and the  attack pressed home upon the first opportunity.  And now it had come,  and there sat the poor, dear soul, shedding tears of anguish on her  lace-edged handkerchief, as she vainly tried to oppose the inevitable.    \"I cannot, and will not, part from my child!\"    \"Nonsense, mother, you parted from me, and I shall take it as a personal  insult if you insinuate that you would feel Rhoda's absence more than  you did mine.  Remember how delighted you were when I came back!  Remember the holidays, how happy you were, how interested in all I had  to tell!\"    Harold Chester crossed the room, and laid his hand on his mother's  shoulder with a kindly gesture.  He looked as if he were made on the  same principle as the other objects of _vertu_ in the room, and if Mrs  Chester had desired to possess \"the most superfine specimen of sons and  heirs,\" she had certainly got her wish, so far as appearances were  concerned.  Harold was tall and fair, with aquiline features and a manly  carriage.  His hair would have curled if it had not been cropped so  close to his head; his clothes were of immaculate cut.  At twenty-five  he was known as one of the most daring sportsmen in the county, and if  he had not distinguished himself at college, he had, at least, scrambled  through with the crowd.  His mother declared with pride that he had  never given her an hour's anxiety since he had had the measles, and  thanked Heaven for her mercies every time she saw him ride off to the  hunt in his beautiful pink coat.  Harold was her first-born darling, but  Rhoda was the baby, and she could not bring herself to believe that her  baby was growing up.    \"The child will fret and break her heart.  I don't care about myself,  but I will not have her made unhappy.  She has such a sensitive heart!\"  She sobbed as she spoke, and Harold laughed.    \"You trust me, mater; Rhoda is as well able to take care of herself as  any girl can be.  You will regret it all your life long if you keep her  at home now.  School is what she needs, and school she must have, if she  is to make a woman worth having.  She is a jolly little soul, and I'm  proud of her; but her eyes are so taken up admiring Miss Rhoda Chester  that she has no attention left for anything else.  Let her go, mother,  and find out that there are other girls in the world beside herself!\"    \"But the other girls will b-b-bully her.  They will make fun of her and  laugh at her little ways--\"    \"And a good--\" Harold checked himself and said cheerily: \"Rhoda won't  let herself be bullied without knowing the reason why, mother.  Whatever  faults she may have, no one can accuse her of lack of spirit.  I believe  she would like to go.  She has very few girl friends, and would enjoy  the new experience.\"    \"We will tell her about it, and see what she says,\" said Mr Chester;  and at that very moment the door opened and Rhoda walked into the room.        CHAPTER TWO.    WHAT RHODA THOUGHT.    Father, mother, and brother looked at Rhoda, and felt a pardonable pride  in her appearance.  Her white evening frock showed off the fair  complexion and golden locks, and she carried herself with an erect,  fearless mien which made a pleasant contrast to the stooping backs and  shambling gait of most growing girls.  If she were not regularly pretty,  her air of assurance forced onlookers to think her so, despite their  better judgment, and there was about her a breezy atmosphere of health  and youth.  She looked from one to the other of the watching faces, and  smiled in a good-humoured, tolerant manner, which showed a dimple in the  round cheek.    \"Hatching mischief!\" she cried, nodding her head sagely.  \"The way in  which your voices ceased as I entered the room was highly suspicious.  Never mind--I'll go to bed soon, and then you can talk at your ease.  It  _is_ awkward when birthdays are drawing near! ...  Chain bracelets are  very nice, with turquoises set here and there, and I rather like that  new edition of Shakespeare with a lot of dear little books fitted into a  case.  I don't object to brooches either, or ornaments for my room--\"    \"But, strange to say, we were not thinking of giving you anything!  We  were talking of a much more serious consideration than a birthday.  We  were talking of your Future Education,\" said Mr Chester, solemnly.  He  spoke so impressively, and with such very large capitals to the last two  words, that Rhoda was startled into attention, and turned her eyes upon  him in wonder.    \"My--future--education?  Why, what do you--what am I going to do?\"    \"We have been considering the advisability of sending you to school.  You are nearly sixteen, and have been educated at home all your life,  and now that Fraulein cannot return I feel strongly that it would be for  your good to spend a couple of years at school among girls of your own  age.  Your mother naturally dreads the parting, and fears that you would  be unhappy, but Harold thinks that you would enjoy the experience.  What  is your own impression?  Do you dislike the idea, or feel inclined  towards it?\"    Rhoda meditated, and her mother watched her with wistful eyes.  At the  first mention of the word \"school\" the girl had started with surprise,  and her eyes had looked wide and puzzled, but now as she stood  deliberating, it was not dismay, but rather pleasure and excitement,  that showed in her face.  The eyes gleamed complacently, the dimple  dipped, the fair head tilted itself, and Rhoda said slowly--    \"I think I should--_like_ it!  It would be a--change!\"    Alas for Mrs Chester, and alas for every mother in that sharp moment  when she realises that the nestling which she has been keeping so safe  and warm is already beginning to find the nest too narrow for its  ambitions, and is longing to fly away into the big, wide world!  Two  salt tears splashed on to the satin gown, but no one saw them, for the  girl was engrossed in her own feelings, while Mr Chester was saying  brightly--    \"That's my brave girl!  I knew you would be no coward.\"    Harold watched his sister with mingled pity and amusement.    \"They'll take it out of her!  They'll take it out of her!  Poor little  Ro!  Won't she hate it, and won't it do her good!\" he said to himself,  shrewdly.  \"And, after the first, I shouldn't wonder if she became a  prime favourite!\"    Rhoda seated herself on a crimson plush chair, and folded her hands on  her knees, in an attitude of expectation.  She was an impetuous young  person, and could brook no delay when once her interest was aroused.  School having been mentioned as a possibility of the future, it became  imperative to settle the matter off-hand.    Which school?  When?  Who would take her?  What would she have to buy?  What were the rules?  When were the holidays?  How long would they be?  Where would she spend them?--One question succeeded another in  breathless succession, making Mr Chester smile with indulgent  amusement.    \"My dear child, how can I tell?  So far it is only a suggestion.  Nothing is settled.  We have not even thought of one school before  another--\"    \"If she goes at all, I should like her to go to Miss Moorby's, at  Bournemouth,\" said Mrs Chester quickly.  \"She only takes ten girls, and  I'm told it is just like a home--hot bottles in all the beds, and beef-  tea at eleven--\"    \"Mother!\" cried Rhoda, in a tone of deep reproach.  Her eyes flashed,  and she drew herself up proudly.  \"No, indeed!  If I go at all, I will  do the thing properly, and go to a real school, and not a hot-house.  I  don't want their old beef-tea and bottles.  I want to"]]]
