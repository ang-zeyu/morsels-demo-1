[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21918"],[0,"Hindu Law and Judicature (#2)"],[1," (but imperfectly) in the earliest records of Hindu philosophy, the  Upanishads.    Thus, cast governs and is antecedent to law, which must bend and adapt  itself to cast, as the overruling, intrinsic, unalterable condition of  Hinduism, of Hindu life. There is one law, one phase of obligation for  the twice-born, another for the Sudra. In Manu, cast is not so  fully and severely developed: Manu permits to the Brahmana four  wives, of whom one may be a Sudra, necessarily permitting,  therefore, a transition or quasi-amalgamation between the highest and  the lowest in the scale. Yajnavalkya permits this Brahmanical  communion with the Kshattriya and Vaisya, but not with the Sudra.  Later promulgators of law,[9] restrict the Brahmana to his own  class.    But although cast, once developed, admitted not of change, juridical  rules, subservient to cast, might and did progress: civil laws and  procedure became more comprehensive and exact, the criminal code more  regulated, lenient, and enlightened. And as universally, (for such is  human,) breaches and occasional disregard of rules have, silently  though surely, worked a change, or caused exceptional accessions to  the rules themselves.    The rule of the Sastras, that kingly power should belong to the  Kshattriya alone, was, even in the halcyon days of Hindu polity,  repeatedly set aside. Chandragupta, a Sudra, and his dynasty, held  sway over India from 315 to 173 B. C.: afterwards came Brahmanical  kings, the Kanwas, from 66 to 21 B. C.: whilst the mighty Gupta kings,  from 150 to 280 A. C., were Vaisyas.    The code of Manu presents a disarranged mass of regulations, in so  much that some have supposed the disorder to have been designed.    That conclusion, however, is repelled by the comparatively succinct  arrangement of Yajnavalkya and other sages. It is more consistent to  suppose, that Manu, as originally promulgated, was, from time to time,  added to, with an accidental disregard of method.    _Achara_, ritual, comprises the distinctive cast-ceremonies, domestic  and social usages, rites of purification, of sacrifice.    _Vyavahara_, may be called the juridical rules, embracing as well  substantive law as the procedure and practice of legal tribunals.    _Prayaschitta_, expiations, are the religious sanctions, or penalties  of sin; the divine visitation upon offenders, and the mode in which  the sinner may avert, by atonement, the consequences of divine  vengeance.    The date of Yajnavalkya's Dharma Sastra is not definitely or  satisfactorily fixed. From internal evidence, it is doubtless much  subsequent to Manu.    The data for conjecturing the period of Yajnavalkya are;    1. Reference is made to Buddhist habits and doctrines, _viz._ the  yellow garments, the baldhead, the Swabhava (B. I. sl. 271, 272, and  349).    Hence, this Dharma Sastra must have been promulgated later than B.  C. 500.    2. Reference is made to a previous Yoga Sastra promulgated by  Yajnavalkya (B. III, sl. 110). Now, the Yoga philosophy was first  shaped into a system by Patanjali who, according to Lassen, probably  flourished about 200 B. C.    3. Mention is made of coin as _nanaka_ (B. II, sl. 240). Now, the  word _nano_ occurs on the coins of the Indoscythian king, Kanerki,  who, according to Lassen, reigned until 40 A. C.    The result, though indefinite, places the earliest date of  Yajnavalkya's code towards the middle of the first century after  Christ.

The Munis[11] after adoration to Yajnavalkya, lord of Yogis,[12]  thus addressed him:    Reveal to us the several duties of the casts, of the orders,[13] and  of the others![14]    2. The prince of the Yogis, who then abode in Mithila, meditating for  a moment, said to the Munis: Hearken to the rules of duty in the  country of the black antelope![15]    3. There are fourteen repositories[16] of the sciences and of law; the  four Vedas together with the Puranas, the Nyaya, the Mimansa, the  Dharma Sastras, and the six Angas.[17]    4. Manu, Atri, Vishnu, Harita, Yajnavalkya, Usanas, Angiras, Yama,  Apastamba, Sanvarta, Katyayana, Brihaspati,    5. Parasara, Vyasa, Sankha, Likhita, Daksha, Gautama,  Satatapa, and Vasishtha,[18] are they who have promulgated  Dharma Sastras.    6. When a gift is made, in due season, place and manner, in good faith  and to a fit person--all this gives the idea of Law.    7. The Sruti, the Smriti,[19] the practice of good men, what seems  good to one's self,[20] and a desire maturely considered--these are  declared to be the root[21] of Law.    9. Four learned in the Vedas and in the Law form a Court, or  Traividya.[22] Whatever is declared by this [Court], or by a single  person who has, in an eminent degree, knowledge of the soul in its  relations[23]--the same should be [held as] Law.    10. Brahmans, Kshattriyas, Vaisyas and Sudras are the casts: of  them the three first are twice-born; all their rites, commencing with  the procreative rites, and ending with those [which are gone through]  where the corpse is disposed of,[24] are with Mantras.[25]    14. In the eighth year from conception, or in the eighth [of  birth],[26] the investiture[27] of the Brahman [takes place]; of  Rajas[28] in the eleventh; of Vaisyas in the twelfth: some [have said,  this varies] in accordance with [the usage of] the family.    39. Brahmans, Kshattriyas, and Vaisyas are born, first, of their  mothers, and, a second time, by the girding on of the sacred  thread--therefore are they declared to be twice-born.    116. [Men] are to be honoured in the gradation following,--in respect  of learning, conduct, years, family, property. Even a Sudra, if he  excel in these respects, is in old age worthy of honour.    326. The monarch, at his rising [from the night's repose], having seen  to the [general] safety, shall himself inspect the [account of]  revenue and disbursements; he shall then adjudicate law-suits; after  which, having bathed,[29] he may, at his pleasure, take his meal.[30]    342. Of a newly subjugated territory, the monarch shall preserve the  social and religious usages, also the judicial system and the state of  classes as they already obtain.[31]    352. A ruler, a minister, people, a stronghold, treasure, [power of]  punishment, and allies--because these are its elements, a realm is  called seven-limbed.    353. When possessed of this, let a monarch cause punishment to fall on  the guilty; for, of old, justice was created by Brahma under the form  of punishment.[32]    357. A brother even, or a son, any one to whom respect is due, a  father-in-law or maternal uncle, if he transgress, is not to go  unpunished by the monarch.    358. The monarch who punishes such as deserve punishment, who slays  such as deserve death: he is as one who has made many sacrifices with  valuable offerings.[33]    359. Every day should the monarch, pondering on his reward (such as  sacrifices gain), himself investigate law-suits in their order with  the judges around him.    360. The monarch, always duly correcting [those among] the casts, the  mixed classes, the guilds, the schools[34] [of the learned], and the  people [in general], who have deviated from their duty, should set  them in the [right] path.    361. A particle of dust in the sunbeams, as they shine through a  window, is held to consist of three atoms; eight of those [particles]  are equal to a poppy seed, of which three are equal to a black mustard  seed;    362. Three of these to a white mustard seed, three of these to a  barley seed of middle size, three of these to a Krishnala  berry,[35] five of these to a Masha,[36] sixteen of these to a  Suvarna.[37]    363. A Pala is four or five[38] Suvarnas. Two Krishnalas are a  silver Masha; sixteen of the latter, a Dharana.    364. A Satamana and a Pala are each equal to ten Dharanas: a  Nishka is four Suvarnas: a copper Pana is of the weight of a  Karsha.[39]    365. One thousand and eighty Panas is declared the highest fine;  half of that amount the medium fine; and half of this the lowest fine.    366. Reproof, words of ignominy, fine, and death,[40] shall be  administered, singly or together, according to the crime.[41]    367. [The monarch] having informed himself of the crime, the place  where, and the time when [committed], the strength [of the criminal,  his] age, calling, and means, shall cause punishment to fall upon the  guilty.[42]    [Inverted \"therefore\" symbol] The foregoing extracts, it will have  been observed, are of general application, and do not refer to any  part of the law in detail.

Well, that shows that you don't use your eyes.  Suppose some one said there was nothing to say about you except that you  whistle?\"    \"Well, what is there about an old grasshopper, anyhow?\"    \"I don't know, but Ben will.\"    \"But tell us something, mum,\" urged Jimmie, who loved his mother dearly,  and was certain she knew more than anybody else, in part because she had  been to college, but chiefly because she was his mother.    \"Let me see,\" said Mrs. Reece, \"I shall have to think about it.\" Both  of the children came as close to her as they could, while she continued:    \"What a strange world it would be if there were no insects in it! We  should have no little crickets chirping in the sunny fields or in the  dark corners and cracks of our houses. There would be no katydids  singing all night, no clacking of the locusts in the tall grass along  dusty roads, no drowsy hum of bees. There would be no little ants and  big ants digging out underground tunnels and carrying the grains of sand  as far from their doorways as possible. There would be no brightly  colored moths and butterflies flitting from flower to flower. We should  find no sparkling fairy webs spun anew for us every morning.\"    \"But, mother, all these creatures aren't insects,\" said Jimmie.    \"Yes, they are, dear. It is hard to believe that they all belong to the  same family called insecta, but they do.\"    \"Mother, what's that word mean?\"    \"It doesn't mean anything more than cut up into parts. You see, Betty,  all these insect bodies are made up of separate rings joined nicely  together. If you look carefully you will find that behind the head there  is another distinct part. This is called the thorax, which means chest.  Behind that there is a pointed part of the body, which is called the  abdomen. Then, if you look again, you will see that all these little  creatures are alike in that they have six jointed legs.\"    \"And are they all good, like the bee and the butterfly?\" asked Betty,  who wasn't always a good little girl herself, and who thought it would  be much nicer if insects were naughty sometimes.    \"Not all, dear,\" answered Mrs. Reece; \"some do us real service, but  others are troublesome; insects are such hungry little fellows, and they  don't have chocolate cake every day to keep them from getting hungry.  They are hungry when they are babies and hungry when they grow up. Some  eat all they can see--like a little boy I know--and some prefer the  tender leaves and twigs. Some care only for the sweet sap flowing into  the new leaves and buds. And still others like best the tender new roots  of plants.\"    \"Mother, what are the baddest ones?\" asked Betty.    \"Pooh! I know,\" said Jimmie; \"the beetles are, because they eat  everything. Why, they'd eat the buttons off your coat or the nose off  your face or--\"    \"Jim! Jim! do tell the truth! The beetles, and bugs, too, are the most  troublesome. Many of the bugs are such tiny little creatures that it is  hard to realize that they can hurt a plant. But bugs have sucking beaks.  With these beaks they bore into the leaves or the buds of the plant, and  then by means of tiny muscles at the back of the mouth they pump up the  sap. To be sure, one little pump could do no harm; but think of millions  of little sucking beaks, millions of little pumps busy at work on a  single plant! Do you remember the pansies mother had in the winter, and  how they were all covered by green plant-lice? Well, those are bugs  called aphids. You remember they were pale green, just the color of the  plant, and so transparent and soft they looked most harmless. The scale  insects are very troublesome, too, but mother doesn't know anything  about them.\"    \"Oh, I know what _they_ are,\" announced Jimmie, \"they get into the fruit  trees.\"    \"And sometimes onto shrubs, too. Mother has heard of a scale insect out  in California which has been a great nuisance to fruit-growers. A  certain ladybug finds this cottony-cushion scale a tender morsel, so  many ladybugs were taken out there to help the owners of the fruit farms  get rid of the scale.\"    \"Did they carry them all the way out, mother?\"    \"Yes,\" answered Jimmie; \"they got a Pullman car for them, and Mr. and  Mrs. Ladybug and family travelled in style.\"    \"Mother, tell Jim to be still.\" Betty, not unlike other little sisters,  hated to be teased by her brother.    \"And now, let me see,\" said Mrs. Reece. \"I don't know that I can tell  you any more until I know more myself. Yes, I do know what baby beetles  are called. They are called grubs, and they live in the ground until it  is time for them to turn into grown-up beetles. While they are babies  they eat as much and as fast as they can, as no baby but a beetle  should. The more they eat the sooner they come out into the bright world  as a June-bug or some other kind of beetle. They eat all the tender  little roots they can find. This is very nice--\"    \"For Mary Ann, but rather hard on Abraham.\"    \"You horrid boy,\" said Betty, \"you don't even let me hear a story in  peace! It's very nice what, mother?\"    \"It's very nice for the little grubs, but it's rather hard on the  plants, for if too many roots are nibbled away the plants die. The  caterpillars are great eaters, too.\"    Betty leaned over and whispered something to her mother; then they both  giggled.    \"I know what you're saying,\" said Jimmie, but after that he was quieter.    \"Sometimes a caterpillar will thrive on just one kind of a plant; it may  be carrot, it may be milkweed. On that it feeds until it has grown as  large as possible. Then it spins itself a nice silken cocoon, or rolls  itself up in a soft leaf and takes a long, long nap. And now it is time  for us to take a nap, too, for we shall soon reach Bemis, and then there  will be still two long lakes to cross and a carry to walk.\"          II    RANGELEY VILLAGE      The next morning great was the stir in the town, for it was known by the  village children that Betty and Jimmie had come, and by the grown-ups  that Mrs. Reece was there. All winter long the children had looked  forward to their coming, for it meant jolly times: picnics, parties,  expeditions, and games. Then, too, Ben Gile would begin to tell them  wonderful things. Through the winter he had been teaching school, and it  was only when the ice broke up in the big lake and the beavers decided  to stop sleeping that Ben Gile came back to his guiding.    There was great excitement about Turtle Lodge. Lizzie kept flying out  with rugs, and then forgetting they hadn't been brushed and flying in  again. The cat was playing croquet with the balls and spools of an open  work-basket, and Max had discovered an old straw hat which tasted very  good to him. Only Mrs. Reece kept her head and stayed indoors, moving  about quietly from room to room, putting the house in that beautiful  order which little children never think about.    Out on the grass that sloped down to the street, which, in its turn,  tumbled head over heels down to the lake, Betty and Jimmie were playing  with their playmates. They were all so wild with joy that every time  Jimmie saw another boy he shouted, \"Come over!\" when the boy was coming,  anyway, just as fast as he could.    Up, up from the foot of the lake climbed an old man; up, up, up the  steep street he came, his white hair shaking and shining in the brisk  June breeze, his long, white beard caught every once in a while by the  wind and tossed sideways.    \"Mother,\" called Jimmie, \"Ben Gile is coming!\"    Out came Mrs. Reece to greet the old man.    Then, one by one, the children spoke with Ben Gile.    \"You're having a good time before you can say Jack Robinson, aren't  you?\"    \"Yes, sir,\" came in a chorus of voices. Then, \"Tell us a story; tell us  a story!\"    [Illustration:  _A._ A few facets of the compound eye of an insect.  _B._ Brain and nerve cord of an insect.]    \"Not to-day,\" said the old man. \"Why, you want a story before you've had  time to turn around.\"    Betty stuck her head out from behind her mother. \"Mother said you would  tell us about crickets and moths, and everything.\"    \"Well, well, well,\" murmured the old man, \"did she? But I can't tell a  story to-day. I'll tell you, though, something, so that when you come to  collect the little creatures you'll know what to do. All sit down.\"    They all sat down cross-legged on the ground, the old man in the middle.    \"Here, you big Jim-boy, catch me that butterfly.\"    There was a wild rush, and the bright wings were soon caught.    \"There, you've torn off one of its legs,\" said the old man.    Jimmie looked troubled. \"I didn't mean to, sir.\"    \"Do you know how it hurts to have your leg torn off, boy? Do you know,  children?\"    \"No,\" came in a chorus.    The guide took out a piece of paper and drew a picture on it. \"There,  every part of that little fellow's body I've drawn has muscles, such  fine muscles no naked eye could ever see them. I'll show them to you  under the microscope in my cabin. Those muscles move the body, and each  muscle is controlled by threads, still more fine, called nerves.\"    The old man reached out like a flash and pinched Jimmie.    \"Ouch!\" cried the boy, and there was a shout of laughter from the  children.    \"You felt that?\"    \"I guess I did,\" said Jim, sulkily.    \"Well, that's because you're made something the same way this butterfly  is. When anything hurts us it's because some of our nerves are hurt, and  quick as a flash the news travels to the brain, and we try to get away  from the thing that causes pain--a pinch, perhaps, or, still worse, the  hurt of a poor leg that has been torn off.\"    \"But a butterfly hasn't any brain,\" objected Jimmie, who was still  cross.    \"Hasn't it? Well, we'll see. Now, you watch my pencil.\" He pointed to  the head of the butterfly. \"This little fellow has a very tiny brain  there. Also running through the body, from end "]]]
