Rip's sole [v]domestic adherent was his dog Wolf, who was as much  henpecked as his master; for Dame Van Winkle regarded them as companions  in idleness, and even looked upon Wolf with an evil eye, as the cause of  his master's going so often astray. True it is, in all points of spirit  befitting an honorable dog, he was as courageous an animal as ever  scoured the woods; but what courage can withstand the ever-enduring and  all-besetting terrors of a woman's tongue? The moment Wolf entered the  house his crest fell, his tail drooped to the ground or curled between  his legs, he sneaked about with a gallows air, casting many a sidelong  glance at Dame Van Winkle, and at the least flourish of a broomstick or  ladle he would fly to the door with yelping precipitation.    Times grew worse and worse with Rip Van Winkle as years of matrimony  rolled on. A tart temper never mellows with age, and a sharp tongue is  the only edged tool that grows keener with constant use. For a long  while he used to console himself, when driven from home, by frequenting  a kind of perpetual club of sages, philosophers, and other idle  personages of the village, which held its sessions on a bench before a  small inn, designated by a [v]rubicund portrait of His Majesty George  III. Here they used to sit in the shade of a long, lazy summer's day,  talking listlessly over village gossip, or telling endless sleepy  stories about nothing. But it would have been worth any statesman's  money to have heard the profound discussions which sometimes took place,  when by chance an old newspaper fell into their hands from some passing  traveler. How solemnly they would listen to the contents, as drawled out  by Derrick Van Bummel, the schoolmaster,--a dapper, learned little man,  who was not to be daunted by the most gigantic word in the dictionary!  and how sagely they would deliberate upon public events some months  after they had taken place!    The opinions of this [v]junto were completely controlled by Nicholas  Vedder, a patriarch of the village, and landlord of the inn, at the door  of which he took his seat from morning till night, just moving  sufficiently to avoid the sun, and keep in the shade of a large tree; so  that the neighbors could tell the hour by his movements as accurately as  by a sun-dial. It is true, he was rarely heard to speak, but smoked his  pipe incessantly. His adherents, however (for every great man has his  adherents), perfectly understood him, and knew how to gather his  opinions. When anything that was read or related displeased him, he was  observed to smoke his pipe vehemently, and to send forth short,  frequent, and angry puffs; but, when pleased, he would inhale the smoke  slowly and tranquilly, and emit it in light and placid clouds, and  sometimes, taking the pipe from his mouth, and letting the fragrant  vapor curl about his nose, would nod his head in approbation.    From even this stronghold the unlucky Rip was at length routed by his  [v]termagant wife, who would suddenly break in upon the tranquility of  the assemblage, and call the members all to naught; nor was that august  personage, Nicholas Vedder himself, sacred from the daring tongue of  this terrible virago, who charged him with encouraging her husband in  habits of idleness.    Poor Rip was at last reduced almost to despair; and his only  [v]alternative, to escape from the labor of the farm and clamor of his  wife, was to take gun in hand and stroll away into the woods. Here he  would sometimes seat himself at the foot of a tree, and share the  contents of his wallet with Wolf, with whom he sympathized as a  fellow-sufferer in persecution. \"Poor Wolf,\" he would say, \"thy mistress  leads thee a dog's life of it; but never mind, my lad, whilst I live  thou shalt never want a friend to stand by thee.\" Wolf would wag his  tail, look wistfully in his master's face; and if dogs can feel pity, I  verily believe he [v]reciprocated the sentiment with all his heart.    In a long ramble of the kind on a fine autumnal day, Rip had  unconsciously scrambled to one of the highest parts of the Catskill  Mountains. He was after his favorite sport of squirrel-shooting, and the  still solitudes had echoed and reechoed with the reports of his gun.  Panting and fatigued, he threw himself, late in the afternoon, on a  green knoll, covered with mountain herbage, that crowned the brow of a  precipice. From an opening between the trees he could overlook all the  lower country for many a mile of rich woodland. He saw at a distance the  lordly Hudson, far, far below him, moving on its silent but majestic  course, with the reflection of a purple cloud, or the sail of a lagging  bark, here and there sleeping on its glassy bosom, and at last losing  itself in the blue highlands.    On the other side he looked down into a deep mountain glen, wild and  lonely, the bottom filled with fragments from the overhanging cliffs,  and scarcely lighted by the reflected rays of the setting sun. For some  time Rip lay musing on this scene; evening was gradually advancing; the  mountains began to throw their long blue shadows over the valleys; he  saw that it would be dark long before he could reach the village, and he  heaved a heavy sigh when he thought of encountering the terrors of Dame  Van Winkle.    As he was about to descend, he heard a voice from a distance, hallooing,  \"Rip Van Winkle! Rip Van Winkle!\" He looked round, but could see nothing  but a crow winging its solitary flight across the mountain. He thought  his fancy must have deceived him, and turned again to descend, when he  heard the same cry ring through the still evening air: \"Rip Van Winkle!  Rip Van Winkle!\"--at the same time Wolf bristled up his back, and giving  a low growl, skulked to his master's side, looking fearfully down into  the glen. Rip now felt a vague apprehension stealing over him; he looked  anxiously in the same direction, and perceived a strange figure slowly  toiling up the rocks, and bending under the weight of something he  carried on his back. He was surprised to see any human being in this  lonely and unfrequented place; but supposing it to be some one of the  neighborhood in need of his assistance, he hastened down to yield it.    On nearer approach he was still more surprised at the [v]singularity of  the stranger's appearance. He was a short, square-built old fellow, with  thick bushy hair, and a grizzled beard. His dress was of the antique  Dutch fashion,--a cloth jerkin strapped round the waist, and several  pair of breeches, the outer one of ample volume, decorated with rows of  buttons down the sides. He bore on his shoulder a stout keg that seemed  full of liquor, and made signs for Rip to approach and assist him with  the load. Though rather shy and distrustful of this new acquaintance,  Rip complied with his usual [v]alacrity, and relieving one another, they  clambered up a narrow gully, apparently the dry bed of a mountain  torrent.    As they ascended, Rip every now and then heard long, rolling peals, like  distant thunder, that seemed to issue out of a deep ravine, or rather  cleft, between lofty rocks, toward which their rugged path conducted. He  paused for an instant, but supposing it to be the muttering of one of  those transient thundershowers which often take place in mountain  heights, he proceeded. Passing through the ravine, they came to a  hollow, like a small [v]amphitheater, surrounded by perpendicular  precipices, over the brinks of which trees shot their branches, so that  you only caught glimpses of the azure sky and the bright evening cloud.  During the whole time Rip and his companion had labored on in silence;  for though the former marveled greatly, what could be the object of  carrying a keg of liquor up this wild mountain, yet there was something  strange and incomprehensible about the unknown that inspired awe and  checked familiarity.    On entering the amphitheater new objects of wonder presented themselves.  On a level spot in the center was a company of odd-looking personages  playing at ninepins. They were dressed in a quaint, outlandish fashion;  some wore short doublets, others jerkins, with long knives in their  belts, and most of them had enormous breeches, of similar style with  that of the guide's. Their visages, too, were peculiar: one had a large  head, broad face, and small, piggish eyes; the face of another seemed to  consist entirely of nose, and was surmounted by a white sugar-loaf hat,  set off with a little red cock's tail. They all had beards, of various  shapes and colors. There was one who seemed to be the commander. He was  a stout old gentleman, with a weather-beaten countenance; he wore a  laced doublet, broad belt and hanger, high-crowned hat and feather, red  stockings, and high-heeled shoes, with roses in them. The whole group  reminded Rip of the figures in an old Flemish painting, in the parlor of  [v]Dominie Van Shaick, the village parson, which had been brought over  from Holland at the time of the settlement.    What seemed particularly odd to Rip was that, though these folks were  evidently amusing themselves, yet they maintained the gravest faces, the  most mysterious silence, and were, withal, the most melancholy party of  pleasure he had ever witnessed. Nothing interrupted the stillness of the  scene but the noise of the balls, which, whenever they were rolled,  echoed along the mountains like rumbling peals of thunder.    As Rip and his companion approached them, they suddenly desisted from  their play, and stared at him with such fixed, statue-like gaze, and  such strange, uncouth countenances, that his heart turned within him,  and his knees smote together. His companion now emptied the contents of  the keg into large flagons, and made signs"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19722"],[0,"A Child's Garden of Verses (#2)"],[1,"quays,      And birdies asleep in the forks of the trees.        The squalling cat and the squeaking mouse,      The howling dog by the door of the house,      The bat that lies in bed at noon,      All love to be out by the light of the moon.        But all of the things that belong to the day      Cuddle to sleep to be out of her way;      And flowers and children close their eyes      Till up in the morning the sun shall rise.    [Illustration]          THE COW          The friendly cow all red and white,          I love with all my heart:      She gives me cream with all her might,          To eat with apple-tart.        She wanders lowing here and there,          And yet she cannot stray,      All in the pleasant open air,          The pleasant light of day.        And blown by all the winds that pass          And wet with all the showers,      She walks among the meadow grass          And eats the meadow flowers.    [Illustration]          FOREIGN LANDS          Up into the cherry tree      Who should climb but little me?      I held the trunk with both my hands      And looked abroad on foreign lands.        I saw the next door garden lie,      Adorned with flowers, before my eye,      And many pleasant places more      That I had never seen before.        I saw the dimpling river pass      And be the sky's blue looking-glass;      The dusty roads go up and down      With people tramping into town.        If I could find a higher tree      Farther and farther I should see,      To where the grown-up river slips      Into the sea among the ships.        To where the roads on either hand      Lead onward into fairy land,      Where all the children dine at five,      And all the playthings come alive.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]          SYSTEM          Every night my prayers I say,      And get my dinner every day;      And every day that I've been good      I get an orange after food.        The child that is not clean and neat,      With lots of toys and things to eat,      He is a naughty child, I'm sure--      Or else his dear papa is poor.    [Illustration]          AT THE SEASIDE          When I was down beside the sea,      A wooden spade they gave to me        To dig the sandy shore.      My holes were hollow like a cup,      In every hole the sea came up,        Till it could hold no more.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]          HAPPY THOUGHT          The world is so full of a number of things,      I'm sure we should all be as happy as kings    [Illustration]          THE LAND OF NOD          From breakfast on through all the day      At home among my friends I stay,      But every night I go abroad      Afar into the Land of Nod.        All by myself I have to go,      With none to tell me what to do--      All alone beside the streams      And up the mountain-sides of dreams.        The strangest things are there for me,      Both things to eat and things to see,      And many frightening sights abroad      Till morning in the Land of Nod.        Try as I like to find the way,      I never can get back by day,      Nor can remember plain and clear      The curious music that I hear.    [Illustration]          WINDY NIGHTS          Whenever the moon and stars are set,        Whenever the wind is high,      All night long in the dark and wet,        A man goes riding by.      Late in the night when the fires are out,    [Illustration]        Why does he gallop and gallop about?      Whenever the trees are crying aloud,        And ships are tossed at sea,      By, on the highway, low and loud,        By at the gallop goes he.      By at the gallop he goes, and then      By he comes back at the gallop again.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]          TIME TO RISE          A birdie with a yellow bill        Hopped up on the window sill,      Cocked his shining eye and said:      'Ain't you 'shamed, you sleepy-head?'    [Illustration]    [Illustration]          RAIN          The rain is raining all around.        It falls on field and tree,      It rains on the umbrellas here,        And on the ships at sea.    [Illustration]          FOREIGN CHILDREN          Little Indian, Sioux or Crow,      Little frosty Eskimo,      Little Turk or Japanee,      O! don't you wish that you were me?        You have seen the scarlet trees      And the lions over seas;      You have eaten ostrich eggs,      And turned the turtles off their legs.        Such a life is very fine,      But it's not so nice as mine:      You must often, as you trod,      Have wearied _not_ to be abroad.        You have curious things to eat,      I am fed on proper meat;      You must dwell beyond the foam,      But I am safe and live at home.    [Illustration]          LOOKING FORWARD            When I am grown to man's estate      I shall be very proud and great,        And tell the other girls and boys      Not to meddle with my toys.          MY SHADOW          I have a little shadow that goes in and out with me,      And what can be the use of him is more than I can see.      He is very, very like me, from the heels up to the head;      And I see him jump before me, when I jump into my bed.        The funniest thing about him is the way he likes to grow--      Not at all like proper children, which is always very slow;      For he sometimes shoots up taller, like an india-rubber ball,      And he sometimes gets so little that there's none of him at all.    [Illustration: \"_I have a little shadow._\"]        He hasn't got a notion of how children ought to play,      And can only make a fool of me in every sort of way.      He stays so close beside me, he's a coward you can see;      I'd think shame to stick to nursie as that shadow sticks to me!        One morning, very early, before the sun was up,      I 'rose and found the shining dew on every buttercup;      But my lazy little shadow, like an arrant sleepy head,      Had stayed at home behind me and was fast asleep in bed.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]          THE SUN'S TRAVELS          The sun is not a-bed when I      At night upon my pillow lie;      Still round the earth his way he takes,      And morning after morning makes.        While here at home in shining day,      We round the sunny garden play,      Each little Indian sleepy-head      Is being kissed and put to bed.        And when at eve I rise from tea,      Day dawns beyond the Atlantic Sea;      And all the children in the West      Are getting up and being dressed.    [Illustration]          LOOKING-GLASS RIVER          Smooth it slides upon its travel,      Here a wimple, there a gleam--          O the clean gravel!          O the smooth stream!        Sailing blossoms, silver fishes,        Paven pools as clear as air--          How a child wishes          To live down there!    [Illustration]        We can see our colored faces        Floating on the shaken pool          Down in cool places,          Dim and very cool;        Till a wind or water wrinkle,        Dipping marten, plumping trout,          Spreads in a twinkle          And blots all out.        See the rings pursue each other;        All below grows black as night,          Just as if mother          Had blown out the light!        Patience, children, just a minute--        See the spreading circles die;          The stream and all in it          Will clear by-and-by.    [Illustration]          THE LAMPLIGHTER          My tea is nearly ready and the sun has left the sky;      It's time to take the window to see Leerie going by;      For every night at teatime and before you take your seat,      With lantern and with ladder he comes posting up the street.        Now Tom would be a driver and Maria go to sea,      And my papa's a banker and as rich as he can be;      But I, when I am stronger and can choose what I'm to do,      O Leerie, I'll go round at night and light the lamps with you!        For we are very lucky, with a lamp before the door,      And Leerie stops to light it as he lights so many more;      And O, before you hurry by with ladder and with light,      O Leerie, see a little child and nod to him to-night!    [Illustration]          SINGING          Of speckled eggs the birdie sings        And nests among the trees;      The sailor sings of ropes and things        In ships upon the seas.        The children sing in far Japan,        The children sing in Spain;      The organ with the organ man        Is singing in the rain.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]          TRAVEL          I should like to rise and go      Where the golden apples grow;--      Where below another sky      Parrot Islands anchored lie,      And, watched by cockatoos and goats,      Lonely Crusoes building boats;--      Where in sunshine reaching out      Eastern cities, miles about,      Are with mosque and minaret      Among sandy gardens set,      And the rich goods from near and far      Hang for sale in the bazaar;--      Where the Great Wall round China goes,      And on one side the desert blows,      And with bell and voice and drum,      Cities on the other hum;--      Where are forests, hot as fire,      Wide as England, tall as a spire,      Full of apes and cocoa-nuts      And the negro hunters' huts;--      Where the knotty crocodile      Lies and blinks in the Nile,      And the red flamingo flies      Hunting fish before his eyes;--      Where in jungles, near and far,      Man-devouring tigers are,      Lying close and giving ear      Lest the hunt be drawing near,      Or a comer-by be seen      Swinging in a palanquin;--      Where among the desert sands      Some deserted city stands,      All its children, sweep and prince,      Grown to manhood ages since,      Not a foot in street or house,      Not a stir of child or mouse,      And when kindly falls the night,      In all the town no spark of light.      There I'll come when I'm a man      With a camel caravan;      Light a fire in the gloom      Of some"]]]
