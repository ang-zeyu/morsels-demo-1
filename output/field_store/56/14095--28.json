You're not attached to Scotland Yard, I understand?\"    Tarling shook his head.    \"No,\" he said quietly. \"I was regularly attached to the police in  Shanghai, and I had intended joining up with Scotland Yard; in fact, I  came over for that purpose. But several things happened which made me  open my own detective agency, the most important of which happenings, was  that Scotland Yard refused to give me the free hand I require!\"    The other nodded quickly.    China rang with the achievements of Jack Oliver Tarling, or, as the  Chinese criminal world had named him in parody of his name, \"Lieh Jen,\"  \"The Hunter of Men.\"    Lyne judged all people by his own standard, and saw in this unemotional  man a possible tool, and in all probability a likely accomplice.    The detective force in Shanghai did curious things by all accounts, and  were not too scrupulous as to whether they kept within the strict letter  of the law. There were even rumours that \"The Hunter of Men\" was not  above torturing his prisoners, if by so doing he could elicit confessions  which could implicate some greater criminal. Lyne did not and could not  know all the legends which had grown around the name of \"The Hunter\" nor  could he be expected in reason to differentiate between the truth and the  false.    \"I pretty well know why you've sent for me,\" Tarling went on. He spoke  slowly and had a decided drawl. \"You gave me a rough outline in your  letter. You suspect a member of your staff of having consistently robbed  the firm for many years. A Mr. Milburgh, your chief departmental  manager.\"    Lyne stopped him with a gesture and lowered his voice.    \"I want you to forget that for a little while, Mr. Tarling,\" he said. \"In  fact, I am going to introduce you to Milburgh, and maybe, Milburgh can  help us in my scheme. I do not say that Milburgh is honest, or that my  suspicions were unfounded. But for the moment I have a much greater  business on hand, and you will oblige me if you forget all the things  I have said about Milburgh. I will ring for him now.\"    He walked to a long table which ran half the length of the room, took up  a telephone which stood at one end, and spoke to the operator.    \"Tell Mr. Milburgh to come to me in the board-room, please,\" he said.    Then he went back to his visitor.    \"That matter of Milburgh can wait,\" he said. \"I'm not so sure that I  shall proceed any farther with it. Did you make inquiries at all? If so,  you had better tell me the gist of them before Milburgh comes.\"    Tarling took a small white card from his pocket and glanced at it.    \"What salary are you paying Milburgh?\"    \"Nine hundred a year,\" replied Lyne.    \"He is living at the rate of five thousand,\" said Tarling. \"I may even  discover that he's living at a much larger rate. He has a house up the  river, entertains very lavishly----\"    But the other brushed aside the report impatiently.    \"No, let that wait,\" he cried. \"I tell you I have much more important  business. Milburgh may be a thief----\"    \"Did you send for me, sir?\"    He turned round quickly. The door had opened without noise, and a man  stood on the threshold of the room, an ingratiating smile on his face,  his hands twining and intertwining ceaselessly as though he was washing  them with invisible soap.          CHAPTER II    THE HUNTER DECLINES HIS QUARRY      \"This is Mr. Milburgh,\" said Lyne awkwardly.    If Mr. Milburgh had heard the last words of his employer, his face did  not betray the fact. His smile was set, and not only curved the lips but  filled the large, lustreless eyes. Tarling gave him a rapid survey and  drew his own conclusions. The man was a born lackey, plump of face, bald  of head, and bent of shoulder, as though he lived in a perpetual gesture  of abasement.    \"Shut the door, Milburgh, and sit down. This is Mr. Tarling. Er--Mr.  Tarling is--er--a detective.\"    \"Indeed, sir?\"    Milburgh bent a deferential head in the direction of Tarling, and the  detective, watching for some change in colour, some twist of face--any  of those signs which had so often betrayed to him the convicted  wrongdoer--looked in vain.    \"A dangerous man,\" he thought.    He glanced out of the corner of his eye to see what impression the man  had made upon Ling Chu. To the ordinary eye Ling Chu remained an  impassive observer. But Tarling saw that faint curl of lip, an almost  imperceptible twitch of the nostrils, which invariably showed on the face  of his attendant when he \"smelt\" a criminal.    \"Mr. Tarling is a detective,\" repeated Lyne. \"He is a gentleman I heard  about when I was in China--you know I was in China for three months, when  I made my tour round the world?\" he asked Tarling.    Tarling nodded.    \"Oh yes, I know,\" he said. \"You stayed at the Bund Hotel. You spent  a great deal of time in the native quarter, and you had rather an  unpleasant experience as the result of making an experiment in opium  smoking.\"    Lyne's face went red, and then he laughed.    \"You know more about me than I know about you, Tarling,\" he said, with a  note of asperity in his voice, and turned again to his subordinate.    \"I have reason to believe that there has been money stolen in this  business by one of my cashiers,\" he said.    \"Impossible, sir!\" said the shocked Mr. Milburgh. \"Wholly impossible! Who  could have done it? And how clever of you to have found it out, sir! I  always say that you see what we old ones overlook even though it's right  under our noses!\"    Mr. Lyne smiled complacently.    \"It will interest you to know, Mr. Tarling,\" he said, \"that I myself have  some knowledge of and acquaintance with the criminal classes. In fact,  there is one unfortunate protege of mine whom I have tried very hard to  reform for the past four years, who is coming out of prison in a couple  of days. I took up this work,\" he said modestly, \"because I feel it is  the duty of us who are in a more fortunate position, to help those who  have not had a chance in the cruel competition of the world.\"    Tarling was not impressed.    \"Do you know the person who has been robbing you?\" he asked.    \"I have reason to believe it is a girl whom I have summarily dismissed  to-night, and whom I wish you to watch.\"    The detective nodded.    \"This is rather a primitive business,\" he said with the first faint hint  of a smile he had shown. \"Haven't you your own shop detective who could  take that job in hand? Petty larceny is hardly in my line. I understood  that this was bigger work----\"    He stopped, because it was obviously impossible to explain just why  he had thought as much, in the presence of the man whose conduct,  originally, had been the subject of his inquiries.    \"To you it may seem a small matter. To me, it is very important,\" said  Mr. Lyne profoundly. \"Here is a girl, highly respected by all her  companions and consequently a great influence on their morals, who, as I  have reason to believe, has steadily and persistently falsified my books,  taking money from the firm, and at the same time has secured the goodwill  of all with whom she has been brought into contact. Obviously she is more  dangerous than another individual who succumbs to a sudden temptation. It  may be necessary to make an example of this girl, but I want you clearly  to understand, Mr. Tarling, that I have not sufficient evidence to  convict her; otherwise I might not have called you in.\"    \"You want me to get the evidence, eh?\" said Tarling curiously.    \"Who is the lady, may I venture to ask, sir?\"    It was Milburgh who interposed the question.    \"Miss Rider,\" replied Lyne.    \"Miss Rider!\"    Milburgh's face took on a look of blank surprise, as he gasped the words.    \"Miss Rider--oh, no, impossible!\"    \"Why impossible?\" demanded Mr. Lyne sharply.    \"Well, sir, I meant----\" stammered the manager, \"it is so unlikely--she  is such a nice girl----\"    Thornton Lyne shot a suspicious glance at him.    \"You have no particular reason for wishing to shield Miss Rider, have  you?\" he asked coldly.    \"No, sir, not at all. I beg of you not to think that,\" appealed the  agitated Mr. Milburgh, \"only it seems so--extraordinary.\"    \"All things are extraordinary that are out of the common,\" snapped Lyne.  \"It would be extraordinary if you were accused of stealing, Milburgh. It  would be very extraordinary indeed, for example, if we discovered that  you were living a five-thousand pounds life on a nine-hundred pounds  salary, eh?\"    Only for a second did Milburgh lose his self-possession. The hand that  went to his mouth shook, and Tarling, whose eyes had never left the man's  face, saw the tremendous effort which he was making to recover his  equanimity.    \"Yes, sir, that would be extraordinary,\" said Milburgh steadily.    Lyne had lashed himself again into the old fury, and if his vitriolic  tongue was directed at Milburgh, his thoughts were centred upon that  proud and scornful face which had looked down upon him in his office.    \"It would be extraordinary if you were sent to penal servitude as the  result of my discovery that you had been robbing the firm for years,\" he  growled, \"and I suppose everybody else in the firm would say the same as  you--how extraordinary!\"    \"I daresay they would, sir,\" said Mr. Milburgh, his old smile back, the  twinkle again returning to his eyes, and his hands rubbing together in  ceaseless ablutions. \"It would sound extraordinary, and it would be  extraordinary, and nobody here would be more surprised than the  unfortunate victim--ha! ha!\"    \"Perhaps not,\" said Lyne coldly. \"Only I want to say a few words in your  presence, and I would like you to give them every attention. You have  been complaining to me for a "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20915"],[0,"Field's Chromatography (#2)"],[1,"s; viz.: the  gross and _material_ which is content with mere nature, and to which  belong the Dutch and Flemish schools; the _sensible_, which aims at  refined and select nature, and accords with the Venetian school; and the  _intellectual_, which aspires to the ideal in beauty, grandeur, and  sublimity, and corresponds with the Greek, Roman, and Florentine  schools. Modern art as founded upon the _intellectual_ school of the  ancient Greeks, became grand, scientific, and severe in the practice of  Michael Angelo, and Leonardo da Vinci; graceful, beautiful and  expressive in Raphael, Correggio, Dominichino, and Guido; and, aiming at  _sensible_ perfection, it attained harmony of colouring and effect in  the works of Titian and Tintoret; but it sunk into grossness and  sensuality while perfecting itself _materially_ among the Flemish and  Dutch.    In the practice of the individual in painting, as well as in all  revolutions of pictorial art, in ancient Greece as in modern Italy,  colouring in its perfection has been the last attainment of excellence  in every school. It has been justly observed, indeed, that for near  three hundred years, since painting was revived, we could hardly reckon  six painters that had been good colourists, among the thousands who had  laboured to become such. But there is reason to hope that as Zeuxis  succeeded and excelled Polygnotus, and Titian Raphael, the artists of  Britain will transcend all preceding schools in the chromatic department  of painting. It is even probable that they may surpass them in all other  branches, and in every mode and application of the art, as they have  already more particularly done in an original and unrivalled use of  water-colours.    Happily, too, there has arisen among us a school of colouring that  confirms this expectation, strengthened as it is, by the suitableness of  our climate to perfect vision. For in it we have that mean degree of  light which is best adapted to the distinguishing of colours, a  boundless diversity of hue in nature relieved by those fine effects of  light and shade which are denied to more vertical suns, besides those  beauties of complexion and feature in our females peculiar to England;  respects in which at least our country is not unfavourable to art.    Even now it is urged by some to the _disparagement_ of the British  school, that it excels in colouring; as if this were incompatible with  any other excellence, or as if nature, the great prototype of art, ever  dispensed with it. The graphic branches of painting, owe everything to  colour, which, if it does not constitute a picture, is its flesh and  blood. Without it, the finest performances remain lifeless skeletons,  and yield no pleasure. Painting is the art of representing visible  things by light, shade, form, and colour; but of these, colour--and  colour alone--is the immediate object which attracts the eye. Colouring  is, therefore, the first requisite--the one thing imparting warmth and  life--the chief quality engaging attention; in short, the best  introduction to a picture, and that which continues to give it value so  long as it is regarded. It is a power, too, which is with the most  difficulty retained, being the first to leave the artist himself, and  the first to quit a school on its decline. Graphic art without  colouring, is as food without flavour; and it was the deficiency of  colouring in the great works of the Roman and Florentine schools that  caused Sir Joshua Reynolds to confess a certain want of attraction in  them. To relish and estimate truly their greatness, required, he said, a  forced and often-repeated attention, and \"it was only those persons  incapable of appreciating such divine performances, who made pretensions  to instantaneous raptures on first beholding them.\" Gainsborough also,  with a candour similar to that of Reynolds, upon viewing the cartoons at  Hampton Court, acknowledged that their beauty was of a class he could  neither appreciate nor enjoy.    Colouring, then, is a necessity; but there is in it a vicious extreme;  that in which it is rendered so principal as, by want of subordination,  to overlay the subject. There is also a negative excellence which  consists in not always employing pleasing tints, but of sometimes taking  advantage of the effects to be derived from impure hues, as Poussin did  in his \"Deluge.\" In this work, neither black nor white, blue, red, nor  yellow appears; the whole mass being, with little variation, of a sombre  grey, the true resemblance of a dark and humid atmosphere, by which  every object is rendered indistinct and almost colourless. This absence  of colour, however, is a merit, and not a fault. Vandyke employed such  means with admirable effect in the background of a Crucifixion, and in  his Pieta; and the Phaëton of Giulio Romano is celebrated for a  suffusion of smothered red, which powerfully excites the idea of a world  on fire.    Of the rank and value of this department of painting, there will be, as  there has been, difference of judgment and opinion, as there is variety  in the powers of the eye and understanding. But take from Rubens,  Rembrandt, Titian, and other distinguished masters, the estimation of  their colouring, and we fear all that is left to them would hardly  preserve their names from oblivion. Art cannot, indeed, attain its  appropriate end, that of pleasing, without excellence in colouring. It  is colour which the true artist most loves, and it is colouring in all  its complex and high relations, that he ever seeks to attain. Looking  above, and around, and beneath him, with the intelligent eye of the  colourist, he finds a boundless source of never-ceasing enjoyment. With  harmonies and accordances lost to the untutored gaze, colour meets him  in every stone he treads on--in the mineral, vegetable, and animal  creation--in the heavens, sea, and earth. For him, in truth, colour is  as equally diffused as light, spreading itself over the entire face of  nature, and clothing the whole world with beauty.          CHAPTER II.    ON THE RELATIONS AND HARMONY OF COLOUR.      Assured as we must be of the importance of colouring as a branch of art,  colours in all their bearings become interesting to the artist, and on  their use and arrangement his reputation as a colourist must depend.    Colour, remarks Ruskin, is wholly _relative_; each hue throughout a work  is altered by every touch added in other places. Thus, to place white  beside a colour is to heighten its tone; to set black beside a colour is  to weaken its tone; while to put grey beside a colour, is to render it  more brilliant. If a dark colour be placed near a different, but lighter  colour, the tone of the first is heightened, while that of the second is  lowered. An important consequence of this principle is, that the first  effect may neutralize the second, or even destroy it altogether. What  was cold before, becomes warm when a colder colour is set near it, and  what was in harmony before, becomes discordant as other colours are put  beside it. For example, to place a light blue beside a yellow, tinges  it orange, and consequently heightens its tone. Again, there are some  blues so dark relatively to the yellow that they weaken it, and not only  hide the orange tint, but even cause sensitive eyes to feel that the  yellow is rather green than orange--a very natural result when it is  considered that the paler the yellow becomes, the more it tends to  appear green.    We learn from these relations of colours, why dapplings of two or more  produce effects in painting so much more clear and brilliant than  uniform tints obtained by compounding the same colours: and why  hatchings, or a touch of their contrasts, thrown as it were by accident  upon local tints, have the same effect. We see, too, why colours mixed  deteriorate each other, which they do more--in many cases--by  imperfectly neutralizing or subduing each other chromatically, than by  any chemical action. Finally, we are impressed with the necessity, not  only of using colours pure, but of using pure colours; although pure  colouring and brilliancy differ as much from crudeness and harshness, as  tone and harmony from murkiness and monotony.    The powers of colours in contrasting each other agree with their  correlative powers of light and shade, and are to be distinguished from  their powers individually on the eye, which are those of light alone.  Thus, although orange and blue are equal powers with respect to each  other, as regards the eye they are totally different and opposed. Orange  is a luminous colour, and has a powerfully irritating effect, while blue  is a shadowy colour, possessing a soothing quality--and it is the same,  in various degrees, with other colours.    There are yet further modes of contrast or antagonism in colouring,  which claim the attention and engage the skill of the colourist. Of the  contrast of _hues_, upon which depend the brilliancy, force, and harmony  of colouring, we have just spoken; but there is, secondly, the contrast  of _shades_. To this belong all the powers of chiaroscuro, by which term  the painter denotes the harmonious effects of light and shade; and  though they form the simplest part of colouring, yet they cannot be  separated from it--light and shade, the chiaroscuro, being a distinct  and important branch of painting. A third mode of contrast in colouring  is that of _warmth_ and _coolness_, upon which depend the toning and  general effect of a picture. Fourthly, there is the contrast of _colour_  and _neutrality_, the chromatic and achromatic, or hue and shade. By the  right management of this, local colours acquire value, gradation,  keeping, and connection: whence come breadth, aërial perspective, and  the due distribution of greys and shadows in a picture.    This principle of contrast applies even to _individual colours_, and  conduces greatly to good colouring. It may be carried "]]]
