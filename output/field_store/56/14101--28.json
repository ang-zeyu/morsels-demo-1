The same conditions, unfavourable to the aggregation of people into  towns or villages, have interfered with the development of lines of  travel, roads and cross-roads, which not only facilitate but define  movement; and as the face of the country, readily traversable in all  directions, does not compel roads to take a particular direction to  avoid obstacles, it has come {p.009} to pass that the seat of war  within the territory of the two Boer states has, like the ocean, and  for the same reasons, few strategic points either natural or  artificial.    The determining natural military features in South Africa are the  seaports, upon possession of which depends Great Britain's landing her  forces, and the mountain ranges, the passes of which, as in all such  regions, are of the utmost strategic value. It has been said that the  Boers' original plan of campaign was to force the British out of  Natal, thus closing access by Durban from the sea, and at the same  time to seize the pass back of Cape Town known as Hex River. If  successful, the eastern flank of the Boer frontier would have been  secured against British landing by the occupation of Durban, while  advance from Cape Town, against the other extremity, would have  involved a front attack upon a strong position in a difficult mountain  defile.    These movements, accurate in conception, were probably in any case too  developed for the Boer numbers, and were definitively foiled by the  British grip upon Ladysmith and Kimberley. Advance was too hazardous,  leaving in {p.010} the rear such forces, unchecked, upon the flank of  the lines of communication.    To these two extremes, or flanks, of the Boer frontier, correspond on  the British side the ports of Cape Town and Durban, which may be said  to mark the western and eastern limits of the field of military  operations in the war. They are the chief seaports on the South  African coast, which by nature is singularly deficient in good and  safe anchorages. The advantages of these two, artificially improved,  and combined with the relatively open and productive region  immediately behind them, have made them the starting-points of the  principal railroad lines by which, through the sea, the interior is  linked to the outer world.    The general direction of these roads is determined, as always, by the  principal objects of traffic or other interests. Thus the line from  Cape Town, ascending by a winding course through the mountains in the  rear, pushes its way north to Kimberley, where are the great diamond  fields, and thence on, by way of Mafeking, to the territory of the  British South African Company--now known as {p.011} Rhodesia. This  lies north of the Transvaal, and, like it, is separated from the sea  by the Portuguese dominion, having, however, by treaty a right of  military way through the latter by the port of Beira; of which right  use is now being made.    In the northern part of its course, which at present ends at Buluwayo,  this road is as yet rather political than economical in its  importance, joining the British entrance at the sea to the as yet  little developed regions of the distant interior. At a point called De  Aar Junction, five hundred miles from Cape Town, a principal branch is  thrown off to the eastward to Bloemfontein, the capital of the Orange  Free State, whence it continues on to Johannesburg, the great  industrial centre of the Gold Fields, and to Pretoria, the capital of  the Transvaal. A glance along this stretch of road will show that  between De Aar and Bloemfontein it receives three tributary routes  from three different points of the sea-coast--Port Elizabeth, Port  Alfred, and East London--the whole system concentrating some sixty  miles before Bloemfontein, at Springfontein, which thus becomes a  {p.012} central depot fed by four convergent, but, in their origin,  independent streams of supply; an administrative condition always  conducive to security and to convenience. This instance also  illustrates the capital importance--especially in a military point of  view--of a place where meet several roads from the permanent base of  operations, which in the case of the British interior campaign is the  sea. The fall of Springfontein would close every avenue of supply by  rail; but a blow at any one of the four lines which concentrate there  does not necessarily affect the others. Holding across-roads in fact  exemplifies the homely phrase of killing two birds with one stone.    Beyond Springfontein the straightness of the line sufficiently  testifies to the easy practicability of the country it traverses. Upon  this railroad system depend the supplies of the British army, which  presents in both men and animals a concentrated mass of life  heretofore unknown to the territory in which it is moving, and where,  from previous conditions of population and development, necessary  resources of every kind are deficient. This {p.013} system  constitutes the main chain of communications, as the term is  understood in war; by it chiefly, for much of the distance wholly,  must come all the ammunition, most of the food, and not improbably at  times a good deal of the water drunk during the dry season, which  fortunately, from this point of view, is also that of cooler weather.    The difficulty of reinforcing railway carriage by any other system of  road transportation is greatly increased by the local horse-sickness,  from which three-fourths of the horses exposed to it die. Reliance for  that purpose, therefore, must be upon the ox-wagon, which for this  reason, and owing to the open level character of the country, has in  the past played a leading part in the South African migrations.    The main and subsidiary railroads thus summarized should, from the  point of view of our subject, be considered as one, contributory to  the advance of the British army over a substantially even country,  which opposes few natural obstacles to such a movement, though here  and there \"accidents of {p.014} the ground\"--a range of hills, or a  dry river-bed, as at Paardeberg--may facilitate opposition by a  military force. The system receives no further support until  Johannesburg is reached. There the railroad from Durban comes in, and,  if its carrying capacity were adequate, which is doubtful, would  enable the chief base of operations and main line of communications to  be shifted to the nearer locality, retaining the Cape road only as  secondary.    The advantage to the British of the line of invasion from Cape Town is  that it crosses the mountains, which separate the coast district from  the inland plateau, at such a distance from the enemy's frontier that  it is impossible for the latter to offer serious resistance before the  comparatively easy rolling country has been reached. It was for this  reason that the decision of the Orange Free State to join in the war,  while it added to the numerical resistance to be encountered by the  British, had for them the compensating advantage that it removed the  necessity of forcing their way over the difficult mountain ranges  which separate Natal from the Transvaal.    With the power of Great Britain to bring into {p.015} the field a  great superiority of numbers, it is at least open to argument that the  Free State, by ceasing to be neutral, relieved the enemy of a  difficulty greater than that which its hostility introduced. It was  for these reasons that the original British plan, as generally  understood, was to make the main invasion along this line. The danger  of Ladysmith, it is commonly and with probability believed, caused the  momentary abandonment of this purpose. Whether the change was at the  moment correct in principle or not, it is evident that Lord Roberts  has reverted to the first intention; a course which enforces its  accuracy with all the weight of his well-earned great renown.    The other railroad system of direct importance to the military  operations of the present war is the single Natal line, from Durban to  Johannesburg and Pretoria, which at Ladysmith throws off a branch to  the westward, crossing the mountains to Bethlehem in the Free State,  and there ends, over sixty miles from the road between Bloemfontein  and Pretoria. The Natal road, having been opened as lately as 1895,  may be considered the {p.016} child of the Gold Fields; prior to the  discovery of which, indeed, there were in the Transvaal neither  products nor consumers enough to give commercial value to a railroad.    The Cape Town line reached Pretoria only in 1892, and it is still  characteristic of all the lines that there is but little local  traffic, either freight or passenger; the roads exist as means whereby  the function of communication, so far discharged by the sea, is  prolonged from the coast to the interior of the continent.    It is not the least noteworthy in the incidents of commercial and  mechanical energy, by which foreign hands have developed the Transvaal  from a poor to a wealthy state, that \"all the heavy machinery, the  timber, the corrugated iron with which the works and men's houses are  constructed, and nearly every requirement of work and life, had to be  brought for over three hundred miles upon ox-wagons, the country  itself supplying scarcely anything, and even to this day (1897) wheat  being brought from Australia.\"[1]                       [Footnote 1: Younghusband's \"South Africa of                     To-day.\" Second Edition, 1899.]    Regarded {p.017} as a source of supply, especially of military supply,  the demands of which are more urgent than those of common life, as its  needs and dangers are more imminent, the Natal railroad, though much  shorter in distance to the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2099"],[0,"A History of the Moravian Church (#2)"],[1,"priests, and had tried in vain to persuade  the Pope to condemn the two preachers as heretics. And the people loved  the Bohemian preachers, and hated the German priests. The old feud was  raging still. If the preacher spoke in German, he was hated; if he spoke  in Bohemian, he was beloved; and Gregory VII. had made matters worse by  forbidding preaching in the language of the people.    The result can be imagined. It is admitted now by all  historians--Catholic and Protestant alike--that about the time when our  story opens the Church in Bohemia had lost her hold upon the affections  of the people. It is admitted that sermons the people could understand  were rare. It is admitted that the Bible was known to few, that the  services held in the parish churches had become mere senseless shows,  and that most of the clergy never preached at all. No longer were  the clergy examples to their flocks. They hunted, they gambled, they  caroused, they committed adultery, and the suggestion was actually  solemnly made that they should be provided with concubines.    For some years a number of pious teachers had made gallant but vain  attempts to cleanse the stables. The first was Conrad of Waldhausen,  an Augustinian Friar (1364-9). As this man was a German and spoke in  German, it is not likely that he had much effect on the common people,  but he created quite a sensation in Prague, denounced alike the vices of  the clergy and the idle habits of the rich, persuaded the ladies of high  degree to give up their fine dresses and jewels, and even caused certain  well-known sinners to come and do penance in public.    The next was Milic of Kremsir (1363-74). He was a Bohemian, and  preached in the Bohemian language. His whole life was one of noble  self-sacrifice. For the sake of the poor he renounced his position as  Canon, and devoted himself entirely to good works. He rescued thousands  of fallen women, and built them a number of homes. He was so disgusted  with the evils of his days that he thought the end of the world was  close at hand, declared that the Emperor, Charles IV., was Anti-Christ,  went to Rome to expound his views to the Pope, and posted up a notice on  the door of St. Peter's, declaring that Anti-Christ had come.    The next was that beautiful writer, Thomas of Stitny (1370-1401). He  exalted the Holy Scriptures as the standard of faith, wrote several  beautiful devotional books, and denounced the immorality of the monks.  \"They have fallen away from love,\" he said; \"they have not the peace of  God in their hearts; they quarrel, condemn and fight each other; they  have forsaken God for money.\"    In some ways these three Reformers were all alike. They were all men  of lofty character; they all attacked the vices of the clergy and the  luxury of the rich; and they were all loyal to the Church of Rome, and  looked to the Pope to carry out the needed reform.    But the next Reformer, Matthew of Janow, carried the movement further  (1381-93). The cause was the famous schism in the Papacy. For the long  period of nearly forty years (1378-1415) the whole Catholic world was  shocked by the scandal of two, and sometimes three, rival Popes, who  spent their time abusing and fighting each other. As long as this schism  lasted it was hard for men to look up to the Pope as a true spiritual  guide. How could men call the Pope the Head of the Church when no one  knew which was the true Pope? How could men respect the Popes when  some of the Popes were men of bad moral character? Pope Urban VI. was  a ferocious brute, who had five of his enemies secretly murdered; Pope  Clement VII., his clever rival, was a scheming politician; and Pope John  XXIII. was a man whose character will scarcely bear describing in print.  Of all the scandals in the Catholic Church, this disgraceful quarrel  between rival Popes did most to upset the minds of good men and to  prepare the way for the Reformation. It aroused the scorn of John  Wycliffe in England, and of Matthew of Janow in Bohemia. \"This schism,\"  he wrote, \"has not arisen because the priests loved Jesus Christ and His  Church, but rather because they loved themselves and the world.\"    But Matthew went even further than this. As he did not attack any  Catholic dogma--except the worship of pictures and images--it has been  contended by some writers that he was not so very radical in his views  after all; but the whole tone of his writings shows that he had lost  his confidence in the Catholic Church, and desired to revive the simple  Christianity of Christ and the Apostles. \"I consider it essential,\" he  wrote, \"to root out all weeds, to restore the word of God on earth,  to bring back the Church of Christ to its original, healthy, condensed  condition, and to keep only such regulations as date from the time of  the Apostles.\" \"All the works of men,\" he added, \"their ceremonies and  traditions, shall soon be totally destroyed; the Lord Jesus shall alone  be exalted, and His Word shall stand for ever.\" Back to Christ! Back to  the Apostles! Such was the message of Matthew of Janow.    At this point, when the minds of men were stirred, the writings of  Wycliffe were brought to Bohemia, and added fuel to the fire. He had  asserted that the Pope was capable of committing a sin. He had  declared that the Pope was not to be obeyed unless his commands were  in accordance with Scripture, and thus had placed the authority of the  Bible above the authority of the Pope. He had attacked the Doctrine of  Transubstantiation, and had thus denied the power of the priests \"to  make the Body of Christ.\" Above all, in his volume, \"De Ecclesia,\" he  had denounced the whole Catholic sacerdotal system, and had laid down  the Protestant doctrine that men could come into contact with God  without the aid of priests. Thus step by step the way was prepared for  the coming revolution in Bohemia. There was strong patriotic national  feeling; there was hatred of the German priests; there was a growing  love for the Bible; there was lack of respect for the immoral clergy,  and lack of belief in the Popes; there was a vague desire to return to  Primitive Christianity; and all that was needed now was a man to gather  these straggling beams together, and focus them all in one white burning  light.          CHAPTER II. -- THE BURNING OF HUS.    On Saturday, July 6th, 1415, there was great excitement in the city of  Constance. For the last half-year the city had presented a brilliant and  gorgeous scene. The great Catholic Council of Constance had met at last.  From all parts of the Western World distinguished men had come. The  streets were a blaze of colour. The Cardinals rode by in their scarlet  hats; the monks in their cowls were telling their beads; the revellers  sipped their wine and sang; and the rumbling carts from the country-side  bore bottles of wine, cheeses, butter, honey, venison, cakes and fine  confections. King Sigismund was there in all his pride, his flaxen hair  falling in curls about his shoulders; there were a thousand Bishops,  over two thousand Doctors and Masters, about two thousand Counts, Barons  and Knights, vast hosts of Dukes, Princes and Ambassadors--in all over  50,000 strangers.    And now, after months of hot debate, the Council met in the great  Cathedral to settle once for all the question, What to do with John Hus?  King Sigismund sat on the throne, Princes flanking him on either side.  In the middle of the Cathedral floor was a scaffold; on the scaffold a  table and a block of wood; on the block of wood some priestly robes. The  Mass was said. John Hus was led in. He mounted the scaffold. He breathed  a prayer. The awful proceedings began.    But why was John Hus there? What had he done to offend both Pope  and Emperor? For the last twelve years John Hus had been the boldest  reformer, the finest preacher, the most fiery patriot, the most powerful  writer, and the most popular hero in Bohemia. At first he was nothing  more than a child of his times. He was born on July 6th, 1369, in a  humble cottage at Husinec, in South Bohemia; earned coppers in his  youth, like Luther, by chanting hymns; studied at Prague University; and  entered the ministry, not because he wanted to do good, but because  he wanted to enjoy a comfortable living. He began, of course, as an  orthodox Catholic. He was Rector first of Prague University, and then  of the Bethlehem Chapel, which had been built by John of Milheim for  services in the Bohemian language. For some years he confined himself  almost entirely, like Milic and Stitny before him, to preaching of an  almost purely moral character. He attacked the sins and vices of all  classes; he spoke in the Bohemian language, and the Bethlehem Chapel was  packed. He began by attacking the vices of the idle rich. A noble lady  complained to the King. The King told the Archbishop of Prague that he  must warn Hus to be more cautious in his language.    \"No, your Majesty,\" replied the Archbishop, \"Hus is bound by his  ordination oath to speak the truth without respect of persons.\"    John Hus went on to attack the vices of the clergy. The Archbishop now  complained to the King. He admitted that the clergy were in need of  improvement, but he thought that Hus's language was rash, and would do  more harm than good. \"Nay,\" said the King, \"that will not do. Hus is  bound by his ordination oath to speak the truth without respect of  persons.\"    And Hus continued his attacks. His preaching had two results. It fanned  the people's desire for reform, and it taught them to despise the clergy  more than ever.    At the same time, when opportunity offered, John Hus made a practice of  preaching on the burning topics of the day; and the most popular topic  then was the detested power of Germans in Bohemia. German soldiers  ravaged the land; German nobles held offices of state; and German  scholars, in Prague University, had three-fourths of the voting power."]]]
