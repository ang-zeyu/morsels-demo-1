A number of people said they  liked it, and asked me to write again; therefore these notes and  sketches on a Journey to India and Burmah. They may not be so  interesting as notes about Antarctic adventure and jolly old Shell Backs  and South Spainers on a whaler; but one journal ought at least, to be a  contrast to the other. The first, a voyage on a tiny wooden ship with a  menu of salt beef, biscuit, and penguin, to unsailed seas and  uninhabited ice-bound lands; the other, in a floating hotel, with  complicated meals, and crowds of passengers, to a hot land with  innumerable inhabitants.    I trust that the sketches I make on the way will help out my notes when  they are not quite King's-English, and that the notes will help to  explain the sketches if they are not sufficiently academical for the  general reader, and moreover, I fondly believe that any journal written  in the East in these years of grace 1905-6, must catch a little  reflected interest from the historic visit of their Royal Highnesses the  Prince and Princess of Wales to India and Burmah.    Edinburgh is our point of departure; the date 13th Oct. and the hour 10  P.M. All journeys seem to me to begin in Edinburgh, from the moment my  baggage is on the dickey and the word \"Waverley\" is given to the cabby.  On this occasion we have three cabs, and a pile of baggage, for six  months clothing for hot and cold places, and sketching, shooting, and  fishing things take space. I trundle down to the station in advance with  the luggage, and leave G. and her maid to follow, and thus miss the  tearful parting with domestics in our marble halls.... Good-bye Auld  Reekie, good-bye. Parting with you is not all sorrow; yet before we  cross the Old Town I begin to wonder why I leave you to paint abroad;  for I am positive your streets are just as picturesque and as dirty and  as paintable as any to be found in the world. Perhaps the very fact of  our going away intensifies last impressions.... There is a street corner  I passed often last year; two girls are gazing up at the glory of colour  of dresses and ribbons and laces in electric light, and a workman reads  his evening paper beside the window--it is a subject for a  Velasquez--"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2276"],[0,"The Private Memoirs and Confessions of a Justified Sinner (#2)"],[1,"rning, found that he was  still lying alone. His sleep had been of the deepest and most genuine  sort; and, all the time that it lasted, he had never once thought of  either wives, children, or sweethearts, save in the way of dreaming  about them; but, as his spirit began again by slow degrees to verge  towards the boundaries of reason, it became lighter and more buoyant  from the effects of deep repose, and his dreams partook of that  buoyancy, yea, to a degree hardly expressible. He dreamed of the reel,  the jig, the strathspey, and the corant; and the elasticity of his  frame was such that he was bounding over the heads of maidens, and  making his feet skimmer against the ceiling, enjoying, the while, the  most ecstatic emotions. These grew too fervent for the shackles of the  drowsy god to restrain. The nasal bugle ceased its prolonged sounds in  one moment, and a sort of hectic laugh took its place. \"Keep it  going--play up, you devils!\" cried the laird, without changing his  position on the pillow. But this exertion to hold the fiddlers at their  work fairly awakened the delighted dreamer, and, though he could not  refrain from continuing, his laugh, beat length, by tracing out a  regular chain of facts, came to be sensible of his real situation.  \"Rabina, where are you? What's become of you, my dear?\" cried the  laird. But there was no voice nor anyone that answered or regarded. He  flung open the curtains, thinking to find her still on her knees, as he  had seen her, but she was not there, either sleeping or waking.  \"Rabina! Mrs. Colwan!\" shouted he, as loud as he could call, and then  added in the same breath, \"God save the king--I have lost my wife!\"    He sprung up and opened the casement: the day-light was beginning to  streak the east, for it was spring, and the nights were short, and the  mornings very long. The laird half dressed himself in an instant, and  strode through every room in the house, opening the windows as he went,  and scrutinizing every bed and every corner. He came into the hall  where the wedding festival had been held; and as he opened the various  windowboards, loving couples flew off like hares surprised too late in  the morning among the early braird. \"Hoo-boo! Fie, be frightened!\"  cried the laird. \"Fie, rin like fools, as if ye were caught in an  ill-turn!\" His bride was not among them; so he was obliged to betake  himself to further search. \"She will be praying in some corner, poor  woman,\" said he to himself. \"It is an unlucky thing this praying. But,  for my part, I fear I have behaved very ill; and I must endeavour to  make amends.\"    The laird continued his search, and at length found his beloved in the  same bed with her Glasgow cousin who had acted as bridesmaid. \"You sly  and malevolent imp,\" said the laird; \"you have played me such a trick  when I was fast asleep! I have not known a frolic so clever, and, at  the same time, so severe. Come along, you baggage you!\"    \"Sir, I will let you know that I detest your principles and your person  alike,\" said she. \"It shall never be said, Sir, that my person was at  the control of a heathenish man of Belial--a dangler among the  daughters of women--a promiscuous dancer--and a player of unlawful  games. Forgo your rudeness, Sir, I say, and depart away from my  presence and that of my kinswoman.    \"Come along, I say, my charming Rab. If you were the pink of all  puritans, and the saint of all saints, you are my wife, and must do as  I command you.\"    \"Sir, I will sooner lay down my life than be subjected to your godless  will; therefore I say, desist, and begone with you.\"    But the laird regarded none of these testy sayings: he rolled her in a  blanket, and bore her triumphantly away to his chamber, taking care to  keep a fold or two of the blanket always rather near to her mouth, in  case of any outrageous forthcoming of noise.    The next day at breakfast the bride was long in making her appearance.  Her maid asked to see her; but George did not choose that anybody  should see her but himself. He paid her several visits, and always  turned the key as he came out. At length breakfast was served; and  during the time of refreshment the laird tried to break several jokes;  but it was remarked that they wanted their accustomed brilliancy, and  that his nose was particularly red at the top.    Matters, without all doubt, had been very bad between the new-married  couple; for in the course of the day the lady deserted her quarters,  and returned to her father's house in Glasgow, after having been a  night on the road; stage-coaches and steam-boats having then no  existence in that quarter.    Though Baillie Orde had acquiesced in his wife's asseveration regarding  the likeness of their only daughter to her father, he never loved or  admired her greatly; therefore this behaviour nothing astounded him. He  questioned her strictly as to the grievous offence committed against  her, and could discover nothing that warranted a procedure so fraught  with disagreeable consequences. So, after mature deliberation, the  baillie addressed her as follows:    \"Aye, aye, Raby! An' sae I find that Dalcastle has actually refused to  say prayers with you when you ordered him; an' has guidit you in a rude  indelicate manner, outstepping the respect due to my daughter--as my  daughter. But, wi' regard to what is due to his own wife, of that he's  a better judge nor me. However, since he has behaved in that manner to  MY DAUGHTER, I shall be revenged on him for aince; for I shall return  the obligation to ane nearer to him: that is, I shall take pennyworths  of his wife--an' let him lick at that.\"    \"What do you mean, Sir?\" said the astonished damsel.    \"I mean to be revenged on that villain Dalcastle,\" said he, \"for what  he has done to my daughter. Come hither, Mrs. Colwan, you shall pay for  this.\"    So saying, the baillie began to inflict corporal punishment on the  runaway wife. His strokes were not indeed very deadly, but he made a  mighty flourish in the infliction, pretending to be in a great rage  only at the Laird of Dalcastle. \"Villain that he is!\" exclaimed he, \"I  shall teach him to behave in such a manner to a child of mine, be she  as she may; since I cannot get at himself, I shall lounder her that is  nearest to him in life. Take you that, and that, Mrs. Colwan, for your  husband's impertinence!\"    The poor afflicted woman wept and prayed, but the baillie would not  abate aught of his severity. After fuming and beating her with many  stripes, far drawn, and lightly laid down, he took her up to her  chamber, five stories high, locked her in, and there he fed her on  bread and water, all to be revenged on the presumptuous Laird of  Dalcastle; but ever and anon, as the baillie came down the stair from  carrying his daughter's meal, he said to himself: \"I shall make the  sight of the laird the blithest she ever saw in her life.\"    Lady Dalcastle got plenty of time to read, and pray, and meditate; but  she was at a great loss for one to dispute with about religious tenets;  for she found that, without this advantage, about which there was a  perfect rage at that time, the reading and learning of Scripture texts,  and sentences of intricate doctrine, availed her naught; so she was  often driven to sit at her casement and look out for the approach of  the heathenish Laird of Dalcastle.    That hero, after a considerable lapse of time, at length made his  appearance. Matters were not hard to adjust; for his lady found that  there was no refuge for her in her father's house; and so, after some  sighs and tears, she accompanied her husband home. For all that had  passed, things went on no better. She WOULD convert the laird in spite  of his teeth: the laird would not be converted. She WOULD have the  laird to say family prayers, both morning and evening: the laird would  neither pray morning nor evening. He would not even sing psalms, and  kneel beside her while she performed the exercise; neither would he  converse at all times, and in all places, about the sacred mysteries of  religion, although his lady took occasion to contradict flatly every  assertion that he made, in order that she might spiritualize him by  drawing him into argument.    The laird kept his temper a long while, but at length his patience wore  out; he cut her short in all her futile attempts at spiritualization,  and mocked at her wire-drawn degrees of faith, hope, and repentance. He  also dared to doubt of the great standard doctrine of absolute  predestination, which put the crown on the lady's Christian resentment.  She declared her helpmate to be a limb of Antichrist, and one with whom  no regenerated person could associate. She therefore bespoke a separate  establishment, and, before the expiry of the first six months, the  arrangements of the separation were amicably adjusted. The upper, or  third, story of the old mansion-house was awarded to the lady for her  residence. She had a separate door, a separate stair, a separate  garden, and walks that in no instance intersected the laird's; so that  one would have thought the separation complete. They had each their own  parties, selected from their own sort of people; and, though the laird  never once chafed himself about the lady's companies, it was not long  before she began to intermeddle about some of his.    \"Who is that fat bouncing dame that visits the laird so often, and  always by herself?\" said she to her maid Martha one day.    \"Oh dear, mem, how can I ken? We're banished frae our acquaintances  here, as weel as frae the sweet gospel ordinances.\"    \"Find me out who that jolly dame is, Martha. You, who hold communion  with the household of this ungodly man, can be at no loss to attain  this information. I observe that she always casts her eye up toward our  windows, both in coming and going; and I suspect that she seldom  departs from the house emptyhanded.\"    That same evening Martha came"]]]
