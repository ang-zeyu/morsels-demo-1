While the broth is boiling, put as many  piled-up table-spoonfuls of oatmeal as you have pints of liquor into a  basin; mix this with cold water into a smooth liquid batter, and then  stir it into the boiling soup; season with some pepper and a good pinch  of allspice, and continue stirring the soup with a stick or spoon on the  fire for about twenty minutes; you will then be able to serve out a  plentiful and nourishing meal to a large family at a cost of not more  than the price of the oatmeal.      No. 4. POTATO SOUP FOR SIX PERSONS.    Peel and chop four onions, and put them into a gallon saucepan, with two  ounces of dripping fat, or butter, or a bit of fat bacon; add rather  better than three quarts of water, and set the whole to boil on the fire  for ten minutes; then throw in four pounds of peeled and sliced-up  potatoes, pepper and salt, and with a wooden spoon stir the soup on the  fire for about twenty-five minutes, by which time the potatoes will be  done to a pulp, and the soup ready for dinner or breakfast.      No. 5. PEA SOUP FOR SIX PERSONS.    Cut up two and a-half pounds of pickled pork, or some pork cuttings, or  else the same quantity of scrag end of neck of mutton, or leg of beef,  and put any one of these kinds of meat into a pot with a gallon of  water, three pints of split or dried peas, previously soaked in cold  water over-night, two carrots, four onions, and a head of celery, all  chopped small; season with pepper, but _no_ salt, as the pork, if pork  is used, will season the soup sufficiently; set the whole to boil very  gently for at least three hours, taking care to skim it occasionally,  and do not forget that the peas, etc., must be stirred from the bottom  of the pot now and then; from three to four hours' gentle boiling will  suffice to cook a good mess of this most excellent and satisfying soup.  If fresh meat is used for this purpose, salt must be added to season it.  Dried mint may be strewn over the soup when eaten.      No. 6. ONION SOUP FOR SIX PERSONS.    Chop fine six onions, and fry them in a gallon saucepan with two ounces  of butter or dripping fat, stirring them continuously until they become  of a very light colour; then add six ounces of flour or oatmeal, and  moisten with three quarts of water; season with pepper and salt, and  stir the soup while boiling for twenty minutes, and when done, pour it  out into a pan or bowl containing slices of bread.      No. 7. BROTH MADE FROM BONES FOR SOUP.    Fresh bones are always to be purchased from butchers at about a farthing  per pound; they must be broken up small, and put into a boiling-pot with  a quart of water to every pound of bones; and being placed on the fire,  the broth must be well skimmed, seasoned with pepper and salt, a few  carrots, onions, turnips, celery, and thyme, and boiled very gently for  six hours; it is then to be strained off, and put back into the pot,  with any bits of meat or gristle which may have fallen from the bones  (the bones left are still worth a farthing per pound, and can be sold to  the bone-dealers). Let this broth be thickened with peasemeal or  oatmeal, in the proportion of a large table-spoonful to every pint of  broth, and stirred over the fire while boiling for twenty-five minutes,  by which time the soup will be done. It will be apparent to all good  housewives that, with a little trouble and good management, a savoury  and substantial meal may thus be prepared for a mere trifle.      No. 8. THICK MILK FOR BREAKFAST.    Milk, buttermilk, or even skim-milk, will serve for this purpose. To  every pint of milk, mix a piled-up table-spoonful of flour, and stir the  mixture while boiling on the fire for ten minutes; season with a little  salt, and eat it with bread or a boiled potato. This kind of food is  well adapted for the breakfast of women and children, and is far  preferable to a sloppy mess of tea, which comes to more money.      No. 9. OATMEAL PORRIDGE FOR SIX PERSONS.    To five pints of skim or buttermilk, add a couple of onions chopped  fine, and set them to boil on the fire; meanwhile, mix six  table-spoonfuls of oatmeal with a pint of milk or water very smoothly,  pour it into the boiling milk and onions, and stir the porridge on the  fire for ten minutes; season with salt to taste.      No. 10. OX-CHEEK SOUP.    An ox-cheek is always to be bought cheap; let it be thoroughly washed in  several waters, place it whole in a three gallon boiling-pot filled up  with water, and set it to boil on the fire; skim it well, season with  carrots, turnips, onions, celery, allspice, pepper, and salt; and allow  the whole to boil very gently by the side of the hob for about three  hours and a-half, by which time the ox-cheek, etc., will be done quite  tender; the cheek must then be taken out on to a dish, the meat removed  from the bone, and after being cut up in pieces, put back into the soup  again. Next mix smoothly twelve ounces of flour with a quart of cold  water, pour this into the soup, and stir the whole on the fire, keeping  it boiling for about twenty-five minutes longer; when it will be ready  for dinner. One ox-cheek, properly managed, will, by attending to the  foregoing instructions, furnish an ample quantity of substantial and  nutritious food, equal to the wants of a large family, for three days'  consumption.      No. 11. SHEEP'S-HEAD BROTH.    Get the butcher to split the sheep's head into halves, wash these clean,  and put them into a boiling-pot with two gallons of water; set this on  the fire to boil, skim it well, add carrots, turnips, onions, leeks,  celery, thyme or winter savory, season with pepper and salt; add a pint  of Patna rice, or Scotch barley; and all the whole to keep gently  boiling by the side of the fire for three hours, adding a little water  to make up for the deficiency in quantity occasioned by boiling.      No. 12. COW-HEEL BROTH.    Put a couple of cow-heels into a boiling-pot, with a pound of rice, a  dozen leeks washed free from grit and cut into pieces, and some coarsely  chopped parsley; fill up with six quarts of water, set the whole to boil  on the fire, skim it well, season with thyme, pepper, and salt, and  allow the whole to boil very gently on the hob for about two hours. You  will thus provide a savoury meal at small cost.      No. 13. BACON AND CABBAGE SOUP.    When it happens that you have a dinner consisting of bacon and cabbages,  you invariably throw away the liquor in which they have been boiled, or,  at the best, give it to the pigs, if you possess any; this is wrong, for  it is easy to turn it to a better account for your own use, by paying  attention to the following instructions, viz.:--Put your piece of bacon  on to boil in a pot with two gallons (more or less, according to the  number you have to provide for) of water, when it has boiled up, and has  been well skimmed, add the cabbages, kale, greens, or sprouts, whichever  may be used, well washed and split down, and also some parsnips and  carrots; season with pepper, but _no_ salt, as the bacon will season the  soup sufficiently; and when the whole has boiled together very gently  for about two hours, take up the bacon surrounded with the cabbage,  parsnips, and carrots, leaving a small portion of the vegetables in the  soup, and pour this into a large bowl containing slices of bread; eat  the soup first, and make it a rule that those who eat most soup are  entitled to the largest share of bacon.      No. 14. STEWED LEG OF BEEF.    Four pounds of leg or shin of beef cost about one shilling; cut this  into pieces the size of an egg, and fry them of a brown colour with a  little dripping fat, in a good sized saucepan, then shake in a large  handful of flour, add carrots and onions cut up in pieces the same as  the meat, season with pepper and salt, moisten with water enough to  cover in the whole, stir the stew on the fire till it boils, and then  set it on the hob to continue boiling very gently for about an hour and  a half, and you will then be able to enjoy an excellent dinner.      No. 15. COCKY LEEKY.    I hope that at some odd times you may afford yourselves an old hen or  cock; and when this occurs, this is the way in which I recommend that it  be cooked, viz.:--First pluck, draw, singe off the hairs, and tie the  fowl up in a plump shape; next, put it into a boiling-pot with a gallon  of water, and a pound of Patna rice, a dozen leeks cut in pieces, some  peppercorns and salt to season; boil the whole very gently for three  hours, and divide the fowl to be eaten with the soup, which will prove  not only nourishing but invigorating to the system.      No. 16. ROAST FOWL AND GRAVY.    Let us hope that at Christmas, or some other festive season, you may  have to dress a fowl or turkey for your dinner. On such occasions I  would recommend the following method:--First, draw the fowl, reserving  the gizzard and liver to be tucked under the wings; truss the fowl with  skewers, and tie it to the end of a skein of worsted, which is to be  fastened to a nail stuck in the chimney-piece, so that the fowl may  dangle rather close to the fire, in order to roast it. Baste the fowl,  while it is being roasted, with butter, or some kind of grease, and when  nearly done, sprinkle it with a little flour and salt, and allow the  fowl to attain a bright yellow-brown colour before you take it up. Then  place it on its dish, and pour some brown gravy over it.      No. 17. THIS IS THE BROWN GRAVY FOR THE FOWL.    Chop up an onion, and fry it with a sprig of thyme and a bit of butter,  and when it is brown, add a good tea-spoonful of moist sugar and a drop  of water, and boil all together on the fire until the water is reduced,  and the sugar begins to bake of a dark brown colour. It must then be  stirred on the fire for three minutes longer; after which moisten it  with half-a-pint of water, add a little pepper and salt; boil all  together for five minutes, and strain "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22117"],[0,"Across Coveted Lands; or, a Journey from Flushing (Holland) to Calcutta Overland (#2)"],[1,"  officer. Having eagerly read it, he stood with his heels together and  gave me a military salute. With a profound bow he begged me to point out  to him all my luggage so that he could have it stamped without giving me  further trouble. He politely declined to use the keys I handed him, and  thinking that I might feel uncomfortable in the hustling crowd of people  he conveyed me to a chair in order that I might sit down.    I turned round to look at the Frenchmen. They had altogether collapsed.    \"I thought you said that Englishmen were hated in Russia, and that they  would confiscate all my things? You see they have confiscated nothing,\" I  meekly remarked to the Frenchmen, when they returned to the sleeping car.  \"I do not think that I have met with more polite Customs officials  anywhere.\"    \"_Oui, oui_,\" muttered the stouter Frenchman, who was evidently in no  mood to enter into further conversation. \"_Et nous autres betes_,\" he  soliloquized, \"_qui avons fait l'alliance avec ces sauvages la! On m'a  tout pris meme le papier a lettres!_\"    He removed his coat and waistcoat and the many interesting patent  appliances for holding his tie in the correct position--where it never  remained--then he threw himself violently on the berth, face towards the  wall, and grumbled the greater part of the night on the stupid mistake of  the Franco-Russian Alliance. On his return to France he would write a  letter to the Ministre des Affaires Etrangeres. After a long and tedious  soliloquy he fortunately fell asleep.    Warsaw on the Vistula, the old capital of Poland, was reached in the  morning.    The quickest way to Baku would have been to proceed to Moscow and then by  the so-called \"petroleum express,\" which leaves once a week, every  Tuesday, for Baku. Unluckily, I could not reach Moscow in time, and  therefore decided to travel across Russia by the next best route, _via_  Kiev, Rostoff, and the Caspian. The few hours I remained in Warsaw were  pleasantly spent in going about seeing the usual sights; the Palace and  lovely Lazienski gardens, laid out in the old bed of the Vistula; the  out-of-door theatre on a small island, the auditorium being separated by  water from the stage; the lakes, the Saski Ogrod, and the Krasinski  public gardens; the Jewish quarter of the town; the museums of ancient  and modern art.    There are few cities in Europe that are prettier, cleaner, and more  animated than Warsaw, and few women in the world that have a better claim  to good looks than the Warsaw fair sex. The majority of women one sees in  the streets are handsome, and carry themselves well, and their dress is  in good taste, never over-done as it is in Paris, for instance.    The whole city has a flourishing appearance, with its tramways, gay  omnibuses, electric light, telephones, and every modern convenience. The  streets are broad and cheerful. In the newer parts of the city there are  beautiful residences, several of which, I was told, belong to British  subjects settled there. The Russian military element is very strong, for  Poland's love for Russia is not yet very great. As we walk along the main  thoroughfares a long string of Cossacks, in their long black felt cloaks  and Astrakan caps, canter along. They are a remarkably picturesque and  business-like lot of soldiers.    Poles are civility itself, that is, of course, if one is civil to them.    Historically the place is of extreme interest, and the battlefields of  Novogeorgievsk, which played such an important part in the Polish  insurrection of 1831, and of Grochowo, where the Poles were defeated, are  well worth a visit. At Maciejowice, too, some fifty miles up the Vistula,  Kosciuzko was made prisoner by the conquering Russians.    Warsaw is the third largest city in the Russian Empire, and its  favourable geographical position makes it one of the great pivots of  Eastern Europe. With a navigable river and the great main railway lines  to important centres such as Berlin, Vienna, Moscow, St. Petersburg,  Dantzig, Kiev, and Odessa, with good climatic conditions, and fertile  soil; with the pick of natural talent in art and science, and the love  for enterprise that is innate in the Polish character, Warsaw cannot help  being a prosperous place.    The city has very extensive suburbs. The best known to foreigners, Praga,  on the opposite bank of the Vistula, is connected with Warsaw by two iron  bridges. Warsaw itself is built on terraces, one above another, along the  bank of the river, but the main portion of the city stands on a high  undulating plain above. There are over a hundred Catholic, several Greek  churches, and a number of synagogues; a university, schools of art,  academies, fourteen monasteries, and two nunneries.    There are few places in the world where the artisan or the common workman  is more intelligent and artistic, and where the upper classes are more  refined and soundly cultured, than in Warsaw. With a certain reflex of  the neighbouring German commercial influence, the place has become a  thriving manufacturing and trading centre. Machinery, excellent pianos  and other musical instruments, carriages, silver and electro-plate, boots  and leather goods are manufactured and exported on a large scale. The  tanneries of Warsaw are renowned the world over, and the Warsaw boots are  much sought after all over the Russian Empire for their softness,  lightness and durability. Then there are great exports of wheat, flax,  sugar, beer, spirits, and tobacco.    But time is short, and we must drive to the station. Say what you will  about the Russian, there is a thing that he certainly knows how to do. He  knows how to travel by rail. One has a great many preconceived ideas of  the Russian and his ways. One is always reminded that he is a barbarian,  that he is ignorant, that he is dirty. He is possibly a barbarian in one  way, that he can differentiate good from bad, real comfort from \"optical  illusions\" or illusions of any other kind, a thing highly civilised  people seem generally unable to do. This is particularly noticeable in  Russian railway travelling,--probably the best and cheapest in the world.    To begin with, when you take a first-class ticket it entitles you to a  seat numbered and reserved that nobody can appropriate. No more tickets  are sold than correspond with the accommodation provided in the train.  This does away entirely with the \"leaving one's umbrella\" business, to  secure a seat, or scattering one's belongings all over the carriage to  ensure the whole compartment to one's self, to the inconvenience of other  travellers. Then first, second and third-class passengers are provided  with sleeping accommodation. The sleeping accommodation, especially for  first and second-class passengers, consists of a wide and long berth  wherein they can turn round at their will, if they please, not of a  short, narrow bunk in which even a lean person has to lie edgewise or  roll out, as in the continental sleeping car, for which discomfort  (rather than accommodation) preposterous extra charges have to be paid,  above the first-class fare. Then, too, in the latter the compartments are  so small, so ridiculously ventilated, that after one night spent boxed  in, especially if another passenger shares the same cabin, one feels sick  for some hours, and in the day-time one has no room to turn round, nor  space to put one's legs. As for the lighting, the less said the better.  These faults exist in our own and the continental first-class  compartments.    But the barbarian Russian knows and does better. The line being of a very  broad gauge, his first-class carriages are extremely spacious and very  high, with large windows and efficacious ventilators; and there is plenty  of room everywhere to spread one's limbs in every direction. There is  probably less gilding about the ceiling, fewer nickel-plated catches  about the doors; not so much polished wood, nor ghastly coloured  imitation-leather paper, nor looking-glasses, but very convenient  folding-tables are found instead; the seats are ample and serviceable, of  plain, handsome red velvet, devoid of the innumerable dust-collecting  button-pits--that striking feature of British and continental  railway-carriage decoration. Movable cushions are provided for one's back  and head. There are bright electric lights burning overhead, and  adjustable reading lights in the corners of the carriage. A corridor runs  along the whole train, and for a few kopeks passengers can at any moment  procure excellent tea, caviare sandwiches, or other light refreshments  from attendants.    Now for the bedding itself. The Russian, who is ever a practical man,  carries his own bedding--a couple of sheets, blankets, and small  pillow,--a custom infinitely cleaner and more sensible than sleeping in  dubious, smelly blankets of which one does not know who has used them  before, nor when they were washed last. But if passengers wish, by paying  a rouble (two shillings) a night to the guard, bedding is provided by the  Railway. There is a fine _lavabo_ at the end of each carriage, with  shampoo, hot and cold water, etc. Here, too, by asking the guard, towels  are handed over to those passengers who have not brought their own.    Here I may relate another amusing incident. Unable to get at my towels  packed in my registered baggage, and ignorant of the Russian language, I  inquired of a polyglot fellow-passenger what was the Russian word for  towel, so that I could ask the guard for one.    \"_Palatiensi_,\" said he, and I repeated, \"Palatiensi, palatiensi,  palatiensi,\" so as to impress the word well upon my memory. Having  enjoyed a good wash and a shampoo, and dripping all over with water, I  rang for the guard, and sure enough, when the man came, I could  not recollect the word. At last it dawned upon me that it  was,--\"_Palatinski_,\" and \"_Palatinski_,\" I asked of the guard.    To my surprise the guard smiled"]]]
