The sheet was then given  to the illuminator, who painted it. The ornamentation of a mediaeval book  of the first class is beyond description by words or by wood cuts. Every  inch of space was used. Its broad margins were filled with quaint  ornaments, sometimes of high merit, admirably painted in vivid colors.  Grotesque initials, which, with their flourishes, often spanned the full  height of the page, or broad bands of floriated tracery that occupied its  entire width, were the only indications of changes of chapter or subject.  In printer's phrase the composition was \"close-up and solid\" to the  extreme degree of compactness. The uncommonly free use of red ink for the  smaller initials was not altogether a matter of taste; if the page had  been written entirely in black ink it would have been unreadable through  its blackness. This nicety in writing consumed much time, but the  mediaeval copyist was seldom governed by considerations of time or  expense. It was of little consequence whether the book he transcribed  would be finished in one or in ten years. It was required only that he  should keep at his work steadily and do his best. His skill is more to be  commended than his taste. Many of his initials and borders were  outrageously inappropriate for the text for which they were designed. The  gravest truths were hedged in the most childish conceits. Angels,  butterflies, goblins, clowns, birds, snails and monkeys, sometimes in  artistic, but much oftener in grotesque and sometimes in highly offensive  positions are to be found in the illuminated borders of copies of the  gospels and writings of the fathers.    \"The book was bound by the forwarder, who sewed the leaves and put them  in a cover of leather or velvet; by the finisher, who ornamented the  cover with gilding and enamel. The illustration of book binding,  published by Amman in his Book of Trades, puts before us many of the  implements still in use. The forwarder, with his customary apron of  leather, is in the foreground, making use of a plow-knife for trimming  the edges of a book. The lying press, which rests obliquely against the  block before him, contains a book that has received the operation of  backing-up from a queer shaped hammer lying upon the floor. The workman  at the end of the room is sewing together the sections of a book, for  sewing was properly regarded as a man's work, and a scientific operation  altogether beyond the capacity of the raw seamstress. The work of the  finisher is not represented, but the brushes, the burnishers, the  sprinklers and the wheel-shaped gilding tools hanging against the wall  leave us no doubt as to their use. There is an air of antiquity about  everything connected with this bookbindery which suggests the thought  that its tools and usages are much older than those of printing.  Chevillier says that seventeen professional bookbinders found regular  employment in making up books for the University of Paris, as early as  1292. Wherever books were produced in quantities, bookbinding was set  apart as a business distinct from that of copying.    \"The poor students who copied books for their own use were also obliged  to bind them, which they did in a simple but efficient manner by sewing  together the folded sheets, attaching them to narrow parchment bands, the  ends of which were made to pass through a cover of stout parchment at the  joint near the back. The ends of the bands were then pasted down under  the stiffening sheet of the cover, and the book was pressed. Sometimes  the cover was made flexible by the omission of the stiffening sheet;  sometimes the edges of the leaves were protected by flexible and  overhanging flaps which were made to project over the covers; or by the  insertion in the covers of stout leather strings with which the two  covers were tied together. Ornamentation was entirely neglected, for a  book of this character was made for use and not for show. These methods  of binding were mostly applied to small books intended for the pocket;  the workmanship was rough, but the binding was strong and serviceable.\"    The book of Mr. Merryweather, here reprinted, is thought worthy of  preservation in a series designed for the library of the booklover. Its  publication followed shortly after that of the works of Digby and  Maitland, but shows much original research and familiarity with early  authorities; and it is much more than either of these, or of any book  with which we are acquainted, a plea in defense of bibliomania in the  middle ages. Indeed the charm of the book may be said to rest largely  upon the earnestness with which he takes up his self-imposed task. One  may fancy that after all he found it not an easy one; in fact his  \"Conclusion\" is a kind of apology for not having made out a better case.  But this he believes he has proven, \"that with all their superstition,  with all their ignorance, their blindness to philosophic light--the monks  of old were hearty lovers of books; that they encouraged learning,  fostered it, and transcribed repeatedly the books which they had rescued  from the destruction of war and time; and so kindly cherished and  husbanded them as intellectual food for posterity. Such being the case,  let our hearts look charitably upon them; and whilst we pity them for  their superstition, or blame them for their pious frauds, love them as  brother men and workers in the mines of literature.\"    Of the author himself little can be learned. A diligent search revealed  little more than the entry in the London directory which, in various  years from 1840 to 1850, gives his occupation as that of bookseller, at  14 King Street, Holborn. Indeed this is shown by the imprint of the  title-page of _Bibliomania_, which was published in 1849. He published  during the same year _Dies Dominicae_, and in 1850 _Glimmerings in the  Dark_, and _Lives and Anecdotes of Misers_. The latter has been  immortalized by Charles Dickens as one of the books bought at the  bookseller's shop by Boffin, the Golden Dustman, and which was read to  him by the redoubtable Silas Wegg during Sunday evenings at \"Boffin's  Bower.\"[6]    FOOTNOTES:    [1] Hallam, Henry. \"Introduction to the Literature of Europe.\" 4      vols.

[6] Dickens's Mutual Friend.          CHAPTER I.         _Introductory Remarks--Monachism--Book Destroyers--Effects of the       Reformation on Monkish Learning, etc._      In recent times, in spite of all those outcries which have been so  repeatedly raised against the illiterate state of the dark ages, many and  valuable efforts have been made towards a just elucidation of those  monkish days. These labors have produced evidence of what few  anticipated, and some even now deny, viz., that here and there great  glimmerings of learning are perceivable; and although debased, and often  barbarous too, they were not quite so bad as historians have usually  proclaimed them. It may surprise some, however, that an attempt should be  made to prove that, in the olden time in \"merrie Englande,\" a passion  which Dibdin has christened Bibliomania, existed then, and that there  were many cloistered bibliophiles as warm and enthusiastic in book  collecting as the Doctor himself. But I must here crave the patience of  the reader, and ask him to refrain from denouncing what he may deem a  rash and futile attempt, till he has perused the volume and thought well  upon the many facts contained therein. I am aware that many of these  facts are known to all, but some, I believe, are familiar only to the  antiquary--the lover of musty parchments and the cobwebbed chronicles of  a monastic age. I have endeavored to bring these facts together--to  connect and string them into a continuous narrative, and to extract from  them some light to guide us in forming an opinion on the state of  literature in those ages of darkness and obscurity; and here let it be  understood that I merely wish to give a fact as history records it. I  will not commence by saying the Middle Ages were dark and miserably  ignorant, and search for some poor isolated circumstance to prove it; I  will not affirm that this was pre-eminently the age in which real piety  flourished and literature was fondly cherished, and strive to find all  those facts which show its learning, purposely neglecting those which  display its unlettered ignorance: nor let it be deemed ostentation when I  say that the literary anecdotes and bookish memoranda now submitted to  the reader have been taken, where such a course was practicable, from  the original sources, and the references to the authorities from whence  they are derived have been personally consulted and compared.    That the learning of the Middle Ages has been carelessly represented  there can be little doubt: our finest writers in the paths of history  have employed their pens in denouncing it; some have allowed difference  of opinion as regards"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21632"],[0,"Fame and Fortune; or, The Progress of Richard Hunter (#2)"],[1,"been able to stow away all their  wardrobe without difficulty in the drawers of the bureau with which  their room in Mott Street was provided.    \"Why are you like an elephant, Fosdick?\" asked Dick, jocosely, as they  emerged into the street.    \"I don't know, I'm sure.\"    \"Because you haven't got any trunk except what you carry round with  you.\"    \"We'll have to get trunks, or perhaps carpet-bags would do.\"    \"No,\" said Dick, decisively, \"it aint 'spectable to be without a trunk,  and we're going to be 'spectable now.\"    \"_Re_spectable, Dick.\"    \"All right,--respectable, then. Let's go and buy each a trunk.\"    This advice seemed reasonable, and Fosdick made no objection. The boys  succeeded in getting two decent trunks at three dollars apiece, and  ordered them sent to their room in Mott Street. It must be remembered by  my readers, who may regard the prices given as too low, that the events  here recorded took place several years before the war, when one dollar  was equal to two at the present day.    At the close of the afternoon Fosdick got away from the store an hour  earlier, and the boys, preceded by an expressman bearing their trunks,  went to their new home. They had just time to wash and comb their hair,  when the bell rang for dinner, and they went down to the dining-room.    Nearly all the boarders were assembled, and were sitting around a long  table spread with a variety of dishes. Mrs. Browning was a good manager,  and was wise enough to set a table to which her boarders could not  object.    \"This way, if you please, young gentlemen,\" she said, pointing to two  adjoining seats on the opposite side of the table.    Our hero, it must be confessed, felt a little awkward, not being used to  the formality of a boarding-house, and feeling that the eyes of twenty  boarders were upon him. His confusion was increased, when, after taking  his seat, he saw sitting opposite him, a young man whose boots he  remembered to have blacked only a week before. Observing Dick's look,  Mrs. Browning proceeded to introduce him to the other.    \"Mr. Clifton,\" she said, \"let me introduce Mr. Hunter and his friend,  Mr. Fosdick,--two new members of our family.\"    Dick bowed rather awkwardly, and the young man said, \"Glad to make your  acquaintance, Mr. Hunter. Your face looks quite familiar. I think I must  have seen you before.\"    \"I think I've seen _you_ before,\" said Dick.    \"It's strange I can't think where,\" said the young man, who had not the  least idea that the well-dressed boy before him was the boot-black who  had brushed his boots near the Park railings the Monday previous. Dick  did not think proper to enlighten him. He was not ashamed of his past  occupation; but it was past, and he wanted to be valued for what he  might become, not for what he had been.    \"Are you in business, Mr. Hunter?\" inquired Mr. Clifton.    It sounded strange to our hero to be called Mr. Hunter; but he rather  liked it. He felt that it sounded respectable.    \"I am at Rockwell & Cooper's, on Pearl Street,\" said Dick.    \"I know the place. It is a large firm.\"    Dick was glad to hear it, but did not say that he knew nothing about it.    The dinner was a good one, much better than the two boys were accustomed  to get at the eating-houses which in times past they had frequented.  Dick noticed carefully how the others did, and acquitted himself quite  creditably, so that no one probably suspected that he had not always  been used to as good a table.    When the boys rose from the table, Mrs. Browning said, \"Won't you walk  into the parlor, young gentlemen? We generally have a little music after  dinner. Some of the young ladies are musical. Do either of you play?\"    Dick said he sometimes played marbles; at which a young lady laughed,  and Dick, catching the infection, laughed too.    \"Miss Peyton, Mr. Hunter,\" introduced Mrs. Browning.    Miss Peyton made a sweeping courtesy, to which Dick responded by a bow,  turning red with embarrassment.    \"Don't you sing, Mr. Hunter?\" asked the young lady.    \"I aint much on warblin',\" said Dick, forgetting for the moment where he  was.    This droll answer, which Miss Peyton supposed to be intentionally funny,  convulsed the young lady with merriment.    \"Perhaps your friend sings?\" she said.    Thereupon Fosdick was also introduced. To Dick's astonishment, he  answered that he did a little. It was accordingly proposed that they  should enter the next room, where there was a piano. The young lady  played some well-known melodies, and Fosdick accompanied her with his  voice, which proved to be quite sweet and melodious.    \"You are quite an acquisition to our circle,\" said Miss Peyton,  graciously. \"Have you boarded in this neighborhood before?\"    \"No,\" said Fosdick; \"at another part of the city.\"    He was afraid she would ask him in what street, but fortunately she  forbore.    In about half an hour the boys went up to their own room, where they  lighted the gas, and, opening their trunks, placed the contents in the  bureau-drawers.    \"Blessed if it don't seem strange,\" said Dick, \"for a feller brought up  as I have been to live in this style. I wonder what Miss Peyton would  have said if she had known what I had been.\"    \"You haven't any cause to be ashamed of it, Dick. It wasn't a very  desirable business, but it was honest. Now you can do something better.  You must adapt yourself to your new circumstances.\"    \"So I mean to,\" said Dick. \"I'm going in for respectability. When I get  to be sixty years old, I'm goin' to wear gold spectacles and walk round  this way, like the old gentlemen I see most every day on Wall Street.\"    Dick threw his head back, and began to walk round the room with a  pompous step and an air of great importance.    \"I hope we'll both rise, Dick; we've got well started now, and there've  been other boys, worse off than we are, who have worked hard, and risen  to FAME AND FORTUNE.\"    \"We can try,\" said Dick. \"Now let us go out and have a walk.\"    \"All right,\" said Fosdick.    They went downstairs, and out into the street. Accustomed to the lower  part of the city, there was a novelty in the evening aspect of Broadway,  with its shops and theatres glittering with light. They sauntered  carelessly along, looking in at the shop-windows, feeling more and more  pleased with their change of location. All at once Dick's attention was  drawn to a gentleman accompanied by a boy of about his own size, who was  walking a little in advance.    \"Stop a minute,\" he said to Fosdick, and hurrying forward placed his  hand on the boy's arm.    \"How are you, Frank?\" he said.    Frank Whitney, for it was he, turned in some surprise and looked at  Dick, but did not at first recognize in the neat, well-dressed boy of  fifteen the ragged boot-black he had encountered a year before.    \"I don't think I remember you,\" he said, surveying Dick with a puzzled  expression.    \"Perhaps you'd remember me better if I had on my Washington coat and  Napoleon pants,\" said our hero, with a smile. He felt rather pleased to  find he was not recognized, since it was a compliment to his improved  appearance.    \"What!\" exclaimed Frank, his face lighting up with pleasure, \"is it  possible that you are--\"    \"Richard Hunter, at your service,\" said our hero; \"but when you knew me  I was Ragged Dick.\"          CHAPTER II.    INTRODUCTION TO MERCANTILE LIFE.      Frank Whitney was indeed surprised to find the ragged boot-black of a  year before so wonderfully changed. He grasped Dick's hand, and shook it  heartily.    \"Uncle,\" he said, \"this is Dick. Isn't he changed?\"    \"It is a change I am glad to see,\" said Mr. Whitney, also extending his  hand; \"for it appears to be a change for the better. And who is this  other young man?\"    \"This is my private tutor,\" said Dick, presenting Fosdick,--\"Professor  Fosdick. He's been teachin' me every evenin' for most a year. His terms  is very reasonable. If it hadn't been for him, I never should have  reached my present high position in literature and science.\"    \"I am glad to make your acquaintance, _Professor_ Fosdick,\" said Frank,  laughing. \"May I inquire whether my friend Dick owes his elegant system  of pronunciation to your instructions?\"    \"Dick can speak more correctly when he pleases,\" said Fosdick; \"but  sometimes he falls back into his old way. He understands the common  English branches very well.\"    \"Then he must have worked hard; for when I first met him a year ago, he  was--\"    \"As ignorant as a horse,\" interrupted Dick. \"It was you that first made  me ambitious, Frank. I wanted to be like you, and grow up 'spectable.\"    \"_Re_spectable, Dick,\" suggested Fosdick.    \"Yes, that's what I mean. I didn't always want to be a boot-black, so I  worked hard, and with the help of Professor Fosdick, I've got up a  little way. But I'm goin' to climb higher.\"    \"I am very glad to hear it, my young friend,\" said Mr. Whitney. \"It is  always pleasant to see a young man fighting his way upward. In this free  country there is every inducement for effort, however unpromising may be  the early circumstances in which one is placed. But, young gentlemen, as  my nephew would be glad to speak further with you, I propose that we  adjourn from the sidewalk to the St. Nicholas Hotel, where I am at  present stopping.\"    \"Yes, Dick,\" said Frank, \"you and Professor Fosdick must spend the  evening with me. I was intending to visit some place of amusement, but  would much prefer a visit from you.\"    Dick and Fosdick readily accepted this invitation, and turned in the  direction of the St. Nicholas, which is situated on Broadway, below  Bleecker Street.    \"By the way, Dick, where are your Washington coat and Napoleon pants  now?\"    \"They were stolen from my room,\" said Dick, \"by somebody that wanted to  appear on Broadway dressed in tip-top style, and hadn't got money enough  to pay for a suit.\"    \"Perhaps it was some agent of Barnum who desired to"]]]
