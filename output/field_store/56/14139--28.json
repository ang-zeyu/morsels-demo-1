We aimed the water at the hedge, and we didn't see Ness and  Aleck until they let out a yell.\"    \"But I saw two of you playing the water in that direction,\" cried Dick  Rover. \"You were one of them, Jack.\"    \"Oh, well, Dad, what was the harm after they were all wet?\" pleaded his  son. \"They'd have to change their clothing anyway.\"    \"That's just it,\" added Andy Rover quickly, with his eyes twinkling  from merriment. \"A little more water won't hurt a person when he's  already soaked. It's just like spoiling a rotten egg--it can't be  done,\" and at this reply, both Dick Rover and his brother, the  fun-loving Tom, had to turn away their faces to hide their amusement.  Nevertheless, Dick sobered his face almost instantly as he answered:    \"Well, these pranks around the farm have got to stop. You'll have your  grandfather and Uncle Randolph and Aunt Martha all upset, not to say  anything about your sisters and your mothers. It's a fortunate thing  that they went down to the town to do some shopping. Otherwise I think  all of you would be in for quite some punishment.\"    \"Oh! Then you're not going to punish us, are you?\" broke in Randy Rover  quickly. \"That's fine! I knew you wouldn't mind our having a little  fun.\"    \"Don't be so fast, young man,\" returned his father. \"Your Uncle Dick  may be too lenient. I am rather of the opinion that you and your  brother, if not your cousins, have got to be taken in hand.\"    \"Oh, please, Massa Tom, don' go fo' to punish 'em,\" burst out old Aleck  Pop. \"I--I don't s'pose dey meant any great ha'm, even do dey did t'row  dat stream of wattah right in dis yere coon's mouf;\" and he smiled  broadly, showing a row of ivories, rather the worse for wear.    \"I think all of you boys had better go into the house and get some dry  clothing on before your mothers put in an appearance,\" suggested Dick  Rover. \"If they see you like this, all dripping wet, they'll certainly  be worried.\"    \"All right, Dad; I'll do it,\" answered Jack, quickly. And then he  motioned to his cousins. \"Come on, let's see how fast we can make the  change;\" and off into the big farmhouse rushed the boys, clattering up  the back stairs one after the other, to the two big rooms which they  occupied.    \"Some boys!\" was Sam Rover's comment, as he shook his head doubtfully.    \"They are certainly growing older--and wilder,\" returned Dick Rover.    \"We've got to take them in hand--that is dead certain!\" said Tom Rover,  with conviction. \"Why! if I don't do something with Andy and Randy  pretty soon, they'll be as--as----\"    \"As bad as you were, Tom, at their age,\" finished Dick Rover, with a  smile.    \"Now you've said something, Dick,\" affirmed Sam Rover. \"Andy isn't  quite so bad when it comes to playing tricks, although he certainly  says some awfully funny things, but when it comes to doing things Randy  continually puts me in mind of Tom.\"    \"Oh, say! To hear you fellows talk, you'd think that I was the worst  boy that ever lived,\" grumbled Tom Rover. \"What did I ever do to raise  such a rumpus as this?\"    \"Phew! What did he ever do to raise such a rumpus as this?\" mocked Sam  Rover. \"Well, what didn't he do? When father went to Africa and  disappeared and we came down here to good old Valley Brook Farm, wasn't  he the constant torment of Uncle Randolph and Aunt Martha, and the  hired girl, and all the rest of the community until, in sheer despair,  uncle had to send us off to Putnam Hall? And when we went to the Hall,  who was the first one to get into trouble--exploding a giant firecracker  on the campus? Answer me that, will you?\"    \"Ancient history,\" murmured Tom Rover, dryly. But then, of a sudden his  eyes began to twinkle. \"No use talking, though, we certainly did have  some good times in those days, didn't we?\" he continued. \"Do you  remember how we got the best of old Josiah Crabtree?\"    \"Yes. And how we got the best of a whole lot of our enemies,\" added Sam  Rover.    \"Yes, and what gloriously good times we did have at Putnam Hall and at  Brill College,\" came from Dick Rover, with a sigh. \"Sometimes I wish  all those happy days could be lived over again.\"    \"When you think of those days, Dick, just think of what great times are  in store for our boys,\" said Sam. \"I only trust they have as good times  as we had.\"    \"I guess they'll know how to take care of themselves all right enough,\"  was Tom Rover's comment. \"But, just the same, we can't permit them to  become too wild. Sending them to that private school in New York City  doesn't seem to have done them so very much good, although, of course,  I admit they are well educated for their age.\"    \"I know where I'm going to send Jack when the proper time comes,\"  answered Dick Rover.    \"Where?\" came from his brothers.    \"I'm going to send him to Colby Hall, the military academy which our  old school chum, Larry Colby, has opened. Larry sent me some of his  literature some time ago; and I have heard from several people that  it's already a first-class institution of learning--every bit as good  as Putnam Hall.\"    \"Well, if it's half as good as dear old Putnam Hall it must be some  school,\" said Tom Rover. \"And there's no reason why Larry Colby  shouldn't be able to run a first-class military academy. He was a good  scholar and a first-class cadet when he was at Putnam Hall.\"    \"After Larry left Putnam Hall he went to travel in Europe,\" continued  Dick. \"Then he went through college, and immediately after that he  joined the militia of New York State and there worked his way up until  he now sports the title of colonel.\"    \"Colonel Colby, eh? That's going some,\" was Tom's comment.    \"His school is patterned after West Point, as was Putnam Hall, and I  understand he has a West Point officer there to instruct the cadets in  military tactics.\"    \"Well, that's the sort of school our boys will need,\" answered Tom  Rover. \"The stricter it is the better it will be for them.\"    \"I think it would be a good scheme to send them to Larry Colby's  school,\" was Sam's comment. \"As Larry knows us so well he would  probably take an especial interest in our boys.\"    \"Yes. But I wouldn't want him to show our lads any special favors,\"  broke in Tom, quickly. \"If the boys went there, I should want them to  stand on their own feet, just as we did when we went to Putnam Hall.\"    \"That's the talk, Tom! No favoritism!\" cried Dick. \"The only way to  make a boy thoroughly self-reliant is to make him take his own part.\"    \"If we are going to send them off to boarding school, they might as  well go this Fall as any other time,\" remarked Sam Rover. \"Have you any  idea when the term at Colby Hall begins, Dick?\"    \"About the middle of September.\"    \"It's the middle of August now. That would give us a full month in  which to make arrangements and for them in which to get ready.\"    \"Have you ever said anything to the twins about going to boarding  school, Tom?\" questioned Sam.    \"Oh, yes. They understand that they are to go to some place sooner or  later. Fred understands it, too, doesn't he?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"And I told Jack only a short while ago that he must get ready to think  of leaving home,\" put in Dick Rover. \"Of course, it will be rather hard  on the boys at first. They have never been away from us at all except  the two weeks when they were out in that boys' camp.\"    \"They'll have to get used to it, just as we got used to it when father  went off to Africa and Uncle Randy sent us to Putnam Hall. Perhaps we  had better tell them----\"    Sam Rover broke off short as a series of shrieks in a high-pitched  feminine voice issued from the pantry of the big farmhouse. An instant  later a hired girl, followed by a middle-aged cook, came flying forth  from the kitchen doorway.    \"Oh, save me! Save me!\" cried the hired girl, clutching her skirts  tightly around her ankles, \"Save me!\"    \"Oh, Mr. Rover! Mr. Rover! It's those dreadful boys! I won't stay here  another minute!\" screamed the cook, flourishing a big spoon in one hand  and a dish-cloth in the other. \"It's outrageous! That's what it is! I'm  going to pack my trunk and leave this house right away!\"    \"What's the matter?\" demanded Tom Rover, quickly.    \"Are you hurt?\" came anxiously from Dick.    \"What have the boys done now?\" questioned Sam.    \"What have they done?\" wailed the hired girl. \"I just went into the  pantry and opened the closet door and out jumped about a thousand mice  at me!\"    \"Yes! and they are running all over the house!\" broke in the cook  savagely. \"One of 'em ran right over my foot and tried to bite me! I'm  going to pack my trunk and leave! I won't stay here another minute!\"          CHAPTER II    SOMETHING OF THE PAST      At the announcement of the hired girl that their sons had let loose in  the farmhouse a thousand mice--more or less--the three Rover brothers  looked at each other enquiringly.    \"Another joke--and so soon!\" gasped Sam Rover.    \"That certainly is the limit!\" broke out Dick Rover, as he started for  the house.    \"If I find Andy and Randy have been up to another trick right on top of  this water-hose nonsense, I'll give them a tanning they won't forget in  a hurry,\" added Tom Rover; and then he and Sam followed Dick up the  back porch and into the kitchen.    To the readers of the former volumes in these two \"Rover Boys Series,\"  Dick, Tom and Sam Rover will need no special introduction. For the  benefit of others, however, let me state that the sober-minded and  determined Dick was the oldest of the three, with the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21899"],[0,"A Rip Van Winkle Of The Kalahari (#2)"],[1,"face!  who can describe it? Seamed and scarred in deep gashes, as though by  some hideous torture, the nose broken and flattened almost upon the  cheek, there remained but little human about the awful countenance  except the eyes. But these, as I found later, were of a beauty and  expressiveness to make one forget their terrible setting. Large,  pellucid, of a bright hazel, there was something magnetic in their  straight and honest gaze; and I can well believe that before he met  with his awful disfigurement their owner must have been a man of superb  appearance.    As I moved, he came towards me, holding out his hand as he did so, and  a fine, warm-hearted grip he gave me.    \"Better, eh?\" he said. \"No don't get up; you've had an ugly smack, and  must take care of yourself for a bit. And I'm afraid,\" he continued, as  he sat down beside me, \"that I was the cause of your accident for your  horse shied at me, and you came near breaking your neck!\"    \"Shied at you?\" I queried, in surprise for there was scarce cover for a  cat just where I had been thrown \"but where were you, then I never saw  you?\"    \"No, but I saw you,\" he replied grimly, \"and having been the cause of  your downfall, I could do no less than look after you till your boys  came.\"    Thus strangely began an acquaintance that lasted only all too short a  time, but that was full of interest for me; for I found my new friend  to be a remarkable man in more ways than in appearance. His knowledge  of the region we were in was wonderful, the few natives we met treated  him with every sign of respect and fear, and he seemed equally  conversant with their language, as with that of my own boys, Jantje the  Hottentot, and Kambala the Herero.    The habits of the game, the properties of each bush and shrub, each  game-path and water-hole, he knew them all, and had something  interesting to say about all of them; and the few days of our  companionship were pleasant in the extreme.    I never knew his name, and had it not been that chance came to my aid,  I should probably never have heard his strange history. But it so  happened that a few days after our first meeting, a buffalo, with the  finest horns I had ever seen, got up within twenty yards of us; and in  my eagerness to secure his wonderful head, I shot badly, and only  succeeded in wounding him slightly. His terrific charge was a thing to  be remembered.    Straight at us he came, wild with rage, and my new friend's horse,  gored and screaming, went down before him in a flash. The rider was  thrown, and to my horror, before I could control my own frightened  animal sufficiently to enable me to shoot, the bull was upon the fallen  man, goring and trampling upon him in an awful manner. Leaping from my  horse, I put bullet after bullet through the big bull's head, and at  length he lurched forward, dead, upon the mangled body of his victim.    We had some difficulty in extricating the man, and never expected to  find him alive, but though badly crushed and torn he still breathed,  and naturally I did all I could to save his life.    That night he was delirious, and it was then that I had evidence of the  almost superhuman strength with which he was endowed. Time after time  he tore himself from the combined strength of my two sturdy boys, and  always he raved of diamonds, and of a never-ending search for  something, or some one, in the desert.    His hurts were sufficient to have killed half a dozen men, and I never  expected him to live; but two days later he was able to tell the  natives, in their own tongue, of certain herbs which they prepared  under his direction, and in a week he was about again.    His cure was nothing short of miraculous in my eyes at least but he  made light of his own share in the matter, and was all gratitude for  the little I had been able to do to atone for the result of my bad  shooting. And one night, by the camp fire, and with very little  preamble, he told me the following strange story, which I have set down  as nearly as possible in his own words.         A RIP VAN WINKLE OF THE KALAHARI        CHAPTER I THE BLUE DIAMOND        Diamonds first brought me to this country--a small glass phial full of  them in the hands of an old sailor who had been shipwrecked on the  South-west African coast, somewhere in the vicinity of Cape Cross, and  who had spent many months wandering with the Bushmen who found him,  before he eventually worked his way back safely to Walfisch Bay. Here  one of the rare whalers, that occasionally called at that little-known  spot, eventually picked him up, and he at length got back to Liverpool,  with nothing but his tiny packet of little bright stones to show for  all his months of hardship among the Bushmen.    The ignorant whalers had laughed at his assertion that the little  crystals were of any value; as at that time diamonds were undreamed of  in South Africa--for all this was long, long ago.    Chance threw me in the old man's way, and a small service I was able to  render him led to his showing me the stones. He had been in Brazil and  had seen rough diamonds there; and I too, who had also dug in the  fields of Minhas Geraes, saw at once that he was right; they were  diamonds.    I had money, but I wanted more; for there was a girl for whom I had  sworn to make a fortune, and who in turn had sworn to wait for me, poor  girl! She little knew how long that wait would be, or the kind of wreck  that would return to her at last. And even as I poured the little  glittering cascade of diamonds that old Anderson had found from one  hand to the other, my mind was made up.    \"Anderson,\" I said, \"come out with me to Africa again, man; we can make  ourselves rich men! Of course, there must be more where these came  from?\"    \"More!\" said the hard-bitten old seaman, who was as brown and withered  as the Bushmen he had lived amongst so long; \"More, is it? Why, sir,  there's bushels of them in a valley as I knows of out there; so many  that I couldn't believe myself that they was diamonds, so I only  brought a few! But there they can stay for me. No more Bushmen for me,  thank 'ee; they'd put a poisoned arrow through me if ever they saw me  again. But if you want to go, well and good; I'll tell you where to  find the diamonds!\"    And the upshot was that I sailed for the Cape a week later, and a few  months afterwards I landed at Walfisch Bay, from whence I intended  trekking north in search of the Golconda old Anderson had described to  me.    At that time, with the exception of a few traders, hunters, and  missionaries near the coast, the country was uninhabited by white men;  moreover, it was in a state of turmoil. From the north-east, a powerful  Bantu race the Damaras, or Ovaherero as they term themselves had been  gradually spreading over the land south and west, and had just come in  contact with the Namaquas, a Hottentot race who had come from the  south. The result had been a series of bloody native wars, in which  neither race could for long claim decided advantage. Meanwhile the  aboriginal Bushmen of the country had been almost exterminated,  scattered tribes of them only remaining in the most inaccessible parts  of the country. It was towards these wild people that my path lay, and  the few settlers I met warned me that my trip was likely to be a  dangerous one.    \"And you have nothing to gain!\" they pointed out, \"these Bushmen have  no cattle, no ivory, nothing! They are but vermin, and a poisoned arrow  is all you are likely to get from them.\" But, secure in my knowledge of  the riches awaiting me, I was not to be deterred; and there came a day  when my wagon, loaded with a goodly stock of \"trade\" goods, trekked  from the sands of Walfisch Bay towards the then unknown country lying  to the north. Rain had fallen and I found the trek by no means as  difficult as I had expected, for I had good native guides, and for a  time all went well. But gradually the long sandy stretches were left  behind, and the country became extremely difficult. On all sides rose  vast table-topped mountains with almost perpendicular sides, and the  wide valleys between them gradually narrowed till they became nothing  but deep, narrow, precipitous gorges, impassable for a wagon. Deep we  penetrated into this tangle of mountains, endeavoring in vain to find a  way through in the direction I believed the valley to lie, and at  length it became evident that to proceed farther with the wagon was out  of the question. Here, therefore, in a well-wooded kloof, with an  abundance of water, I made my central camp; and from it I proceeded to  explore the country farther north. By this time the wild Bushmen, who  had hitherto fled at our approach, had gained confidence, and came  freely to the camp, and I had guides in plenty. For a time their  extraordinary \"click\" language was utterly beyond my comprehension, but  at length I learnt enough of it to make them understand what I wished  to find.    But search as I would I could never find the spot--valley after valley  they took me to, krantz after krantz, and kloof after kloof, I  scrambled through and searched, but all in vain. Mineral wealth I found  everywhere, copper and tin in abundance, and in one deep valley rich  nuggets of gold, but still the diamonds evaded me. Nor did I ever find  them, though I am sure that Anderson's tale was true, and that  somewhere in those mountains lie diamonds galore. It may be that they  are now buried deep in the sand; for at times the wind blows with  incredible force; and in the terrific sandstorms, huge dunes are lifted  and swept across the country; and it may well be that the deep valley  of his day is now filled to the level of its walls.    Sick and disheartened I determined at last to offer a big reward to any  of the guides who should bring in a diamond to me; and calling them all  together, I made them understand as much; at the same time showing one  of the little diamonds "]]]
