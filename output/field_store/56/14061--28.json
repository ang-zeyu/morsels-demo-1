[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20470"],[0,"Etiquette (#2)"],[1," so much a manifestation _toward others_ as it  is an exponent of _ourselves_.  We are courteous to others, first of  all, because such behavior only is consistent with our own claim to be  well-bred.    Bearing this in mind we can behave with serenity in the presence of our  most aggravating foe; his worst manifestation of himself fails to  provoke us to retort in kind.  We treat him politely, not because he  deserves it, but because we owe it to ourselves to be gentle-mannered.  Etiquette _begins at self_.  There is no worthy deference to others  that does not rest on the basis of self-respect.      \"To thine own self be true;    And it must follow, as the night the day,    Thou canst not then be false to any man.\"      It is a superficial judgment that descries nothing but insincerity in  the unvarying suavity of a well-bred manner; that regards the  conventional code of behavior as merely a device for rendering social  life artificial.  The _raison d'etre_ is always to be found in the  established rules of etiquette; and probably the most exacting and  seemingly unnecessary of formalities has its foundation in some good  common sense principle not far removed in spirit from \"the rule golden.\"    In short, manners and morals are twin shoots from the same root.  The  essentially well-bred man is he whose manners are the polite expression  of moral principle, magnanimity, and benevolence.          VISITING CARDS    THE OFFICE OF THE VISITING CARD    The personal, or visiting, card is the representative of the individual  whose name it bears.  It goes where he himself would be entitled to  appear, and in his absence it is equivalent to his presence.  It is his  \"double,\" delegated to fill all social spaces which his  variously-occupied life would otherwise compel him to leave vacant.    Since the card is to be received as the equivalent of one's self, it is  important that it shall be discreetly sent upon its embassy.  In every  case where personal cards are correctly used the owner is accredited  with having performed _de facto_ whatever the card expresses for him,  be it a \"call,\" a \"regret,\" a \"congratulation,\" an \"apology,\" an  \"introduction,\" a \"farewell-taking,\" or whatever.    The rules guiding the uses of visiting cards are based upon this idea  of representation.  The deputy is on duty only in the absence of his  superior, so the card is usually superfluous when the owner himself is  present.    A card sent at a wrong time suggests the possibility that the owner  might blunder similarly in his personal appearing.  The neglect to send  a card at a proper time is equivalent to a _personal_ neglect.  The man  who comes himself and hands you his card also is apt to have too many  elbows at a dinner, too many feet at a ball.  He has about him a  suggestion of awkward superfluousness that is subtly consistent with  his duplicate announcement of himself.    For want of the much-needed genderless singular pronoun I have been  using the masculine form; but upon reflection I remember that it is the  women of society who have the most diverse responsibility in the  management of personal cards, their duties extending even to the care  and oversight of the cards of their socially careless and negligent  male relatives.  But no matter who attends to the proprieties, the  relation of the card to its owner is the same in all cases.  If his  card blunders, he gets the discredit of it.  If his card always  flutters gracefully into the salver at exactly the right time and  place, the glory is all his own, even though his tireless wife or  mother or sister has done all the hard thinking bestowed on the matter.  Happy the man allied by the ties of close kindred to a gifted society  woman, for lo! his cards shall never be found missing, wherever _he_  may stray.      STYLE OF CARDS    The prevailing shape of cards for women is nearly square (about 2 1/2 x  3 inches).  A fine dull-finished card-board of medium weight and  stiffness is used.    A man's card is smaller, and narrower proportionately; and is of  slightly heavier card-board.    The color is pearl white, not cream.  Tinted cards are not admissible.    The engraving is plain script, or elaborate text; as the fashion may  for the time decree.    The responsibility of furnishing the correct style of card rests with  the engraver, whose business it is to know the ruling fashion of the  day.  Any one may have an elegant card by intrusting the choice to a  first-class stationer.  But it is not half the battle to secure an  elegant card.  An elegant use of the card distinguishes the  well-informed in social usage.  This distinction shows when the  distribution of cards begins.        THE ENGRAVING OF VISITING CARDS    CARDS FOR MEN    If the surname is short, the full name may be engraved.  If the names  are long, and the space does not admit of their full extension, the  initials of given names may be used.  The former style is preferred,  when practicable.    In the absence of any special title properly accompanying the name--as  \"Rev.,\" \"Dr.,\" \"Col.,\" etc.,--\"Mr.\" is always prefixed.  Good form  requires this on an engraved card.  If in any emergency a man _writes_  his own name on a card he does _not_ prefix \"Mr.\"    What titles may properly be used on a man's visiting-card?  The  distinctions made in the use of titles seem arbitrary unless some  reason can be discovered.    The rule should be, to omit from visiting-cards all titles that signify  _transient offices_, or _occupations not related to social life_; using  such titles only as indicate a rank or profession that is _for life_;  and which has become a part of the man's _identity_, or which is  distinctly allied to his _social conditions_.    To illustrate:--The rank of an officer in the army or the navy should  be indicated by title on his card, his connection with the service  being _for life_, and _a part of his identity_.  His personal card is  engraved thus: \"General Schofield\"--the title in full when only the  surname is used; or, \"Gen. Winfield Scott,\" \"Gen. W. S. Hancock\"--the  title abbreviated when the given names, or their initials, are used.  The first style is appropriate to the Commander-in-chief, or the senior  officer; or in any case where no other officer of the same name and  rank is on the roster.    Officers on the retired list, and veteran officers of the late war who  rose from the volunteer ranks, retain their titles by courtesy.  And  very appropriately so, since the war record of many a gallant soldier  is inseparable from the man himself, in the minds of his  fellow-citizens.  He may have retired to private life again, but his  distinguished services have outlived the brief hour of action; and his  hero-worshiping countrymen will always recognize him in his most  salient character, \"every inch a soldier.\"  It is quite impossible to  call him \"Mr.,\" or at once to know who is meant if his card reads--for  instance--\"Mr. Lucius Fairchild.\"  Nothing but the title of his  well-earned rank gives an adequate idea of the man.    The official cards of political officers and ambassadors, which bear  the title and office of the man--with or without his name--should be  used only on official or State occasions, and during the term of  office.  When the incumbent \"steps down and out,\" this card is also  \"relegated.\"  His friends may continue to greet him as \"Governor,\" but  he no longer _uses_ the title himself.  In strictly social life, the  personal card of the ex-Governor is like that of any other private  citizen, subject to the same rules.    Similarly, professional or business cards that bear ever so slight an  advertisement of occupations are not allowable for social purposes.    The three \"learned\" professions, theology, medicine, and law, are  equally \"for life.\"  But the occupation of the lawyer is distinctly  related to business matters, and not at all to social affairs.  His  title, or sub-title, _Esquire_, is properly ignored on his  visiting-card, and socially he is simply \"Mr. John Livingstone.\"  On  the other hand, the callings of the clergyman and the physician  respectively, are closely allied to the social side of life, closely  identified with the man himself.  Therefore \"Rev.,\" or \"Dr.\" may with  propriety be considered as forming an inseparable compound with the  name.  The title is an important identifying mark, and its omission, by  the clergyman, at least, is not strictly dignified.  \"Office hours\" are  not announced on a physician's social card.    It is not good form to use _merely honorary titles_ on visiting-cards.  In most cases, a man should lay aside all pretension to special office  or rank, and appear in society simply as \"Mr. John Brown,\" to take his  chances in the social world strictly on his own merits; assured that if  he has any merit, other people will discover it without an ostentatious  reminder of it in the shape of a pompous visiting-card.  Of course this  suggestion of democratic simplicity refers to the engraving of _one's  own card_; other people _address_ the man properly by his official or  honorary title, with all due respect for the worth which the world  recognizes--even though the wearer of such honors ignores his own claim  to high distinction.  \"Blow your own trumpet, if you would hear it  sound,\" is a sharply sarcastic bit of advice, since only hopeless  mediocrity could ever profit by the injunction.  Real merit needs no  trumpeter.  Mrs. Grant could afford to call her husband \"Mr.\" Grant, as  was her modest custom; because all the world knew that he was the  General of our armies, and the President of the republic.  It is some  \"Mayor Puff,\" of Boomtown, who can hardly be persuaded by the engraver  from giving himself the satisfaction of incidentally announcing on his  visiting-cards the result of the last borough election.    A man's address may be engraved beneath his name at the lower right  corner, the street and number _only_ if"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20472"],[0,"Grace Harlowe's Plebe Year at High School (#2)"],[1,"ed, as they went down the steps, \"be sure and  come to the basketball meeting at the gym this afternoon.\"    And so it was arranged that Anne Pierson, the shabbiest and poorest girl  in Oakdale High School, was to help receive at one of the prettiest and  most charming houses in town. Miriam Nesbit's rudeness was to bring  about a friendship between Anne Pierson and her three schoolmates that  lasted a lifetime.    After the half-past two o'clock dinner, which was the universal custom  in Oakdale, the chums met again at the gymnasium in the Boys' High  School. Wednesdays and Saturdays were nicknamed \"ladies' days\" by the  High School boys, for on these afternoons the girls were permitted free  use of the gymnasium.    The meeting to-day was not for gymnastic exercises, however, but an  important subject was to be discussed--the Freshman Basketball Team.  Also the captain of the team was to be elected.    Other club meetings were in full force when the girls arrived, and the  great room vibrated with the hum of voices. The three freshmen, who knew  better than to interrupt sophomores and juniors at their pow-wows, made  their way quietly across the hall to the appointed place of rendezvous.  Of course, the entire Freshman Class did not assemble to discuss this  subject. Many members were not interested in basketball, except to look  on. Girls who were overstudious, and not physically strong, could not at  any rate play on the team, and therefore they seldom attended such  meetings. Jessica Bright was one of these, nevertheless, she followed  her two friends, who had always been foremost in athletics at the  Central Grammar School.    The election of a captain was the first business of the meeting. That  over, the captain, after due and serious consultation with a friendly  cabinet, chose the players and their substitutes.    Undoubtedly Grace Harlowe had the coolest head in the class, and was the  most to be relied upon at critical moments; yet Miriam Nesbit exerted a  strange influence over her followers, who were almost her slaves. She  was the richest of all the girls and wore the costliest clothes. The  parties she gave, from time to time, in her mother's large and handsome  home were the talk of the place. She was also the cleverest girl in the  class, and had taken undisputed first place since she was a child. She  was not a close student, but seemed to absorb her lessons in half the  time that it took her friends to master them. Popular she certainly was,  or rather she was feared by her schoolmates. Her masterful, overpowering  spirit seemed to sweep everything before it.    Grace Harlowe was quite as powerful in her way, but she had a noble,  unselfish disposition and was much beloved by her friends. She stood  well in her studies, but had never taken first place. Perhaps this was  because she had interested herself so much in outdoor sports that she  had not given enough time to study.    Both girls were handsome--Miriam tall, dark and oriental-looking, with  flashing eyes and an imperious curve to her lips; Grace was also tall,  with wavy, chestnut hair, fine gray eyes, regular features, a full,  generous chin and cheeks glowing with health.    Miriam Nesbit had already done a good deal of lobbying when the three  girls arrived on the scene. She wished to be elected captain of the team  at any cost; but Grace's adherents were holding off, quietly waiting for  her arrival.    \"Well, here you are at last!\" said Marian Barber, who had been preparing  the ballots for the coming election.    Marian was the busy girl of the class, and always made herself useful.    \"Is everyone here?\" demanded Nora, scanning the crowd of freshmen with a  view to ascertaining what her chum's chances were.    \"All that intend coming,\" replied Miriam. \"The softies stayed away, as  usual.\"    \"Suppose we wait five minutes,\" said Grace, looking at her watch, \"and  then, if no one comes, we will cast the votes.\"    \"No, no,\" exclaimed Miriam impatiently. \"I have an engagement and can't  spare any more time. I vote that we have the election at once, without  waiting another moment.\"    \"Very well,\" assented Grace. \"I only suggested waiting because Anne  Pierson promised to come, and, of course, every girl in the class has a  right to vote at the class elections.\"    \"Anne Pierson?\" cried Miriam, turning crimson with suppressed rage.    \"Yes,\" answered Grace calmly; \"but, if everybody is agreeable, suppose  we go ahead.\"    \"Agreed!\" cried the others and the ballots were cast.    There was not much parliamentary practice in these class elections. Each  girl wrote the name of her choice on a slip of paper and dropped it in a  hat. Four of the girls then counted the votes, and the one receiving the  most slips was declared elected.    The slips were dropped into the hat, amid the silence of the company.  Some of the sophomores and juniors, perched on parallel bars, watched  the scene with superior amusement, but no notice was taken of their  half-whispered jeers.    The four girls then retired to count the votes.    \"It's a tie,\" announced Marian Barber, returning presently; \"a tie  between Grace and Miriam. I wish some of the others would come and  settle the matter.\"    \"Here's some one,\" cried Nora. \"Here's Anne Pierson. Let her cast the  decisive vote.\"    Miriam's eyes blazed, but she held her peace. There was nothing to do  but submit with an uneasy grace. But who could doubt what the outcome  would be? However, she felt somewhat relieved when Grace said:    \"I think we should cast the votes over again, and, according to the  rules we made last year, Miriam and I should not vote, since the  election rests between us.\"    The votes were cast again, Anne timidly dropping her slip in the hat  with the others, and, as might have been expected, Grace was elected  captain of the Freshman Basketball Team of the Oakdale High School.          CHAPTER II    THE SPONSOR OF THE FRESHMAN CLASS      \"Grace,\" asked Mrs. Harlowe, the day of the famous freshman tea, \"have  you asked some of the girls to help this afternoon? Bridget can attend  to the sandwiches, but some one ought to pour the lemonade and generally  look after the wants of the others.\"    Grace was arranging a bowl of China asters on the piano in her mother's  charming drawing room. The shining mahogany chairs and tables reflected  the glow of the wood fire, for the day was chilly, and bright chintz  curtains at the windows gave a cheerful note of color to the scene.    \"Oh, yes, mother,\" replied Grace. \"Nora and Jessica, of course, and Anne  Pierson.\"    \"And who is Anne Pierson?\"    \"I don't know who she is,\" answered Grace. \"I never knew her until she  entered the High School. But she is terribly poor. Her mother is an  invalid and her sister takes in plain sewing. I really asked her at  first because Miriam Nesbit was rude to her one day. But I'm beginning  to like her so much, now, that I'm glad I did it. She's as quiet as a  little mouse, but she is fast taking first place in class. I believe she  will outstrip Miriam before the end of the year. Don't ask me who she  is, though. I haven't the least idea, but she's all right, I can promise  you that. I'm sorry for her because she is poor. They live in a little  broken-down cottage on River Street.\"    Mrs. Harlowe looked dubious. Grace was always bringing home stray people  and animals, and the mother was accustomed to her daughter's whims. The  young girl was familiar to all the ragamuffins of the town slum, and  when she sometimes found one gazing wistfully through the fence palings  of her mother's old-fashioned garden, she promptly led him around to the  kitchen, gave him a plate of food on the back steps, picked him a small  bouquet and sent him off half-dazed with her gracious and impetuous  kindness.    \"Well, my dear, I shall be prepared for anything,\" exclaimed Mrs.  Harlowe; \"but remember that feeding people on the back steps and asking  them into the parlor to meet your friends and acquaintances are two  different matters altogether.\"    \"Don't be afraid, mother,\" replied Grace. \"You will like Anne as well as  I do, once you get to know her. You must be careful not to frighten her  at first. She is the most timid little soul I ever met.\"    Just then the front gate clicked and two girls strolled up the red-brick  walk, their light organdie dresses peeping out from the folds of their  long capes.    \"Here come Nora and Jessica,\" cried Grace excitedly, running to the door  to meet her friends.    Mrs. Harlowe smiled. In spite of Grace's sixteen years she was still her  little girl.    There was another click at the gate and Mrs. Harlowe saw through the  parlor window a little, dark figure, pathetically plain in its shabby  coat and hat.    \"Poor little soul,\" thought the good woman. \"How I wish I could put her  into one of Grace's muslins, but, of course, I couldn't think of  offering to do such a thing.\"    \"Mother,\" said Grace some minutes later, when the girls had laid aside  their wraps and descended into the drawing room, \"this is Anne Pierson,  our new friend.\"    Anne Pierson, small and shrinking, was dressed in a queer, old-fashioned  black silk that had evidently been taken up and made short for the  occasion. Mrs. Harlowe's heart was touched to the quick and she bent and  kissed the young girl gently.    \"How do you do, my dear?\" she said kindly. \"I am always glad to meet  Grace's friends, and you are most welcome.\"    Anne was too frightened almost to speak. This was the first party she  had ever attended, and the beautiful room, the girls in their light,  pretty dresses, the bowls of flowers and the cheery firelight nearly  stupefied her.    Mrs. Harlowe disappeared into the little conservatory off the dining  room, returning in a moment with two big red roses which she pinned to  Anne's dress.    \"These red roses have been waiting for you all morning,\" she said, \"and  they're just in their prime"]]]
