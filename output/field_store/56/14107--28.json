And that was why she  didn't see old dog Spot when he stuck his nose around a corner of the  farmhouse.    Now, Spot's ways were quite different from Miss Kitty's. Whenever he set  out on a hunt he never could keep still. So the moment he caught sight  of Miss Kitty Cat he gave a joyful bark. At the same time he bounded  towards her.    Of course Spot's yelps warned her to run. The moment she heard his first  bark she forgot all about her own hunt, being herself the hunted. She  scurried off across the farmyard, with Spot tearing after her.    If she had had time enough Miss Kitty would have climbed a tree. But  Spot was altogether too near her for that. And being a stranger about  the farmyard, she hadn't learned all the fine hiding places. Since Spot  was between her and the house, she made for the barn and sprang through  the open door. Inside Spot quickly cornered her.    With her back arched and her tail almost as big as Tommy Fox's brush,  Miss Kitty Cat turned and faced her pursuer.          IV    A TENDER NOSE      \"HURRAH!\" old dog Spot barked. At least, what he said sounded a good  deal like that.    He had cornered Miss Kitty Cat in the barn. And there was nothing he  liked more than teasing anybody that was short-tempered as she was.    \"_Tchah!_\" Miss Kitty hissed.    Now, that ought to have been warning enough to Spot to keep a good, safe  distance from her. But he was one of the sort that never knows enough to  take a warning for what it is worth.    \"_Wow!_\" he chuckled. \"You needn't think I'm afraid of you. If you ran  from me once, you'll run again.\"    He didn't intend to hurt Miss Kitty. All he wanted was to get her to run  across the yard again, so that he might have the sport of chasing her.  So he edged nearer and nearer her, thinking that she would dodge past  him and run out of the barn.    But Miss Kitty Cat had no relish for that sport.    \"Keep your distance, sir!\" she cried. And though she spoke plainly  enough, old Spot paid no heed to her words. Instead, he gave a quick  spring at her, just to worry her a bit more.    To his great surprise, almost at that same instant Miss Kitty Cat sprang  at him. And as she jumped, she flashed one of her paws out and struck  Spot on one side of his long nose.    It was not just a gentle tap with a soft, well-padded paw. She thrust  her claws well out from between her toes. And jabbing them deep into  Spot's tender nose, she gave a sharp downward pull.    All at once old dog Spot thought of the time when, as a puppy, he stuck  his nose into a hornet's nest. His joyful bark changed suddenly to a  shrill _ki-yi_ of pain. And at the same time he became angry.    \"You don't know how to have fun,\" he growled at Miss Kitty Cat. \"Just to  teach you better manners I'm going to take you by the back of your neck  and shake you.\"    It appeared that Miss Kitty herself had quite a different notion. At  least, she went through an entirely different motion, which was not at  all like offering the back of her neck for old Spot to seize. When Spot  reached for her she clawed him furiously, with one paw after another,  while she told him what she thought of him.    He did not wait to hear everything that Miss Kitty had to say to him.  Spot thought too much of his nose to linger in the barn any longer, but  turned tail and hurried into the yard.    Miss Kitty Cat chased him as far as the door. Taking one quick backward  glance at her as he went, Spot noticed how fiercely her eyes glared. It  was a terrible sight. And it made him hasten all the faster.    \"My goodness! What a temper!\" he said under his breath.    Loping across the farmyard, he looked about him uneasily. He hoped  nobody had seen Miss Kitty Cat driving him out of the barn. He knew it  would be a hard matter to explain to any one. All his farmyard friends  would be sure to think it a great joke.    Luckily there was no one in sight except Henrietta Hen.    \"She won't notice anything,\" Spot assured himself. \"She's the stupidest  person on the farm.\"    Having nothing more to worry about except his scratched nose, old Spot  crawled under the woodshed and nursed his wounds during the rest of the  morning.    As for Miss Kitty Cat, she stayed in the barn a long time.    \"What a worthless fellow that old dog is!\" she thought. \"This barn is  full of mice! I don't believe he has caught one in all the years he has  lived on the farm.\"          V    SPOTS AND SPECKLES      WHEN she first met Miss Kitty Cat face to face Henrietta Hen exclaimed,  \"What a pity!\"    Miss Kitty Cat hadn't intended to speak to Henrietta Hen at all. She  didn't care, as a rule, to have anything to do with hens. She often  remarked that she liked eggs and she liked chickens; but she never could  see what hens were good for.    Well, when Henrietta Hen spoke to her like that Miss Kitty Cat paused  and stared at her coolly for a moment or two. Then she asked in rather a  distant tone, \"What's a pity?\"    Now, Henrietta Hen seldom knew when she was snubbed. And goodness knows  people snubbed her often enough, too. For she was forever making remarks  about their looks. And now she said to Miss Kitty Cat, \"It's a pity your  speckles are so big.\"    Miss Kitty Cat saw at once that Henrietta Hen was a vain creature. She  had half a mind to walk on and leave her, without saying another word to  her. Indeed, Miss Kitty had turned aside to continue her stroll towards  the meadow when Henrietta Hen spoke to her again.    \"Don't you think,\" Henrietta demanded, \"that speckles should be worn  very small, like mine? Don't you think yours are too big?\"    \"I'd rather not talk with you,\" said Miss Kitty Cat. \"I can see plainly  that we'd never agree.\"    \"Oh, do stop for a while!\" Henrietta Hen besought her. \"I love a chat  with a cat,\" she added with a silly giggle.    Miss Kitty Cat was vexed. She thought that Henrietta Hen was a tiresome  person.    \"Ill stop and have a chat with you,\" Miss Kitty relented, \"for it's not  often that I meet a spotted hen. If my speckles are too big,\" she went  on in an icy tone, \"it is just as true that your spots are altogether  too small.\"    \"Spots!\" Henrietta cackled. Like all empty-headed people, she was quick  to lose her temper. \"Spots indeed! I'd have you know that I haven't any  spots. I'm a speckled beauty--that's what I am. And if you don't believe  it you can ask the Rooster.\"    \"Perhaps I was mistaken,\" Miss Kitty Cat purred. \"Anyhow, I'll take  _your_ word about the Specks. I won't bother to ask the Rooster.\"    \"Ah!\" Henrietta Hen exclaimed. \"You're afraid of him! You're afraid he  might want to fight you. And I wish he would,\" she screamed at Miss  Kitty, \"for it's plain that you're no gentleman.\"    \"Well--I should hope not!\" Miss Kitty Cat gasped.    \"I thought you were a gentleman, or I should never have spoken to you,\"  Henrietta Hen declared. \"When I first saw you I said to myself, 'Here's  a quiet, polite gentleman! It will be pleasant to have him living at the  farmhouse.' But I see that I was mistaken.\"    \"You were!\" cried Miss Kitty, who was--to say the least--greatly  astonished by Henrietta's odd remarks. \"My name is Miss Kitty Cat. And  what made you think I was a gentleman is more than I can guess.\"    \"_Miss!_\" cried Henrietta. \"_Miss!_ Then why, pray tell me, do you wear  those whiskers?\"    Try as she would, Miss Kitty could give no reason that satisfied  Henrietta Hen. And Henrietta always declared that Miss Kitty Cat was a  strange, strange person.          VI    BEECHNUT SHUCKS      ONCE in a while Frisky Squirrel paid a visit to Farmer Green's place.  Although he had learned that the farmyard was not without its dangers,  after one adventure Frisky was always sure to return, sometime, as if in  search of another.    So a certain fine, fall day found him scampering along the top of the  stone wall that followed the road as it dropped down the hill from the  woods to Farmer Green's front gate.    Old Mr. Crow, sailing lazily over the yellowing fields, caught sight of  the stone wall traveller and glided into a tree beside the road. \"You'd  better not go near the farmyard, young fellow!\" old Mr. Crow called.    Frisky Squirrel stopped, sat down, and looked up at Mr. Crow in the tree  above him.    \"Why not?\" Frisky inquired.    \"Haven't you heard the news?\" Mr. Crow asked him. \"Haven't you heard  that there's a cat at the farmhouse?\"    \"I didn't know it,\" Frisky admitted. \"But I don't see why I should turn  back. I won't hurt her.\"    Old Mr. Crow _haw-hawed_.    \"I don't believe,\" he croaked, \"you've ever met a cat.\"    \"No, I haven't,\" Frisky Squirrel replied, \"but I'd like to see one. So  I'll be on my way. But don't worry, Mr. Crow? I won't hurt her.\" And  then Frisky started off along the top of the stone wall once more, at a  somewhat brisker pace to make up for lost time.    \"He can't say I didn't warn him,\" Mr. Crow exclaimed as he watched the  bouncing bit of gray fur.    \"I hope Mr. Crow won't worry,\" said Frisky Squirrel to himself. \"If the  cat gets hurt it will be her own fault, for I certainly won't harm her.\"    When Frisky reached the farmyard he crept around a corner of the barn,  hoping to find a few kernels of corn. But Henrietta Hen had been there  before him and there wasn't one kernel left. He ran here and there about  the yard. And at last, when quite near the woodshed door, he sat up  suddenly, twitched his nose a few times, and said, \"Ha! I smell  beechnuts!\"    Now, that was not strange. Johnnie Green had been eating beechnuts in  the woodshed doorway. And he had scattered the shucks on the broad  stone step. Frisky Squirrel began nosing them. And just out of sight  inside the woodshed Miss Kitty Cat awoke from a short nap, stopped right  in the middle of a long stretch, and said, \"Ha! I smell a squirrel!\"    Miss Kitty Cat was wide awake in an instant.

The next issue will close another volume of this paper, and with it       several thousand subscriptions will expire.         It being an inflexible rule of the publishers to stop sending the       paper when the time is up for which subscriptions are prepaid,       present subscribers will oblige us by remitting for a renewal       without delay, and if they can induce one or more persons to join       them in subscribing for the paper, they will largely increase our       obligation.         By heeding the above request to renew immediately, it will save the       removal of thousands of names from our subscription books, and       insure a continuance of the paper without interruption.         The publishers beg to suggest to manufacturers and employers in       other branches of industry that in renewing their own subscriptions       they add the names of their foremen and other faithful employes.

It is estimated that the total annual losses of insured property by  fire, throughout the world, average nearly two hundred million dollars.  Add to this the annual destruction of uninsured property, and we should  probably have a total amounting to quite double these figures. How great  the loss, how severe the tax upon the productive industry of mankind,  this enormous yearly destruction amounts to, will come home to the minds  of most readers more directly if we call attention to the fact that it  just about equals the value of our total wheat crop during a year of  good yield. And it is a direct tax upon productive industry everywhere,  because, although here and there a nominal loser, fully insured, has  only made what is sometimes called \"a good sale\" to the companies  holding his risk, this is only a way of apportioning the loss whereby  the community at large become the sufferers. Thus it is that we find all  ably-managed insurance companies earnestly endeavoring to make it plain  to the public how fires should be guarded against, or most effectually  localized and controlled when once started.    During the fall, or from \"lighting up\" time till about New Year's day,  more fires occur ordinarily than in any other portion of the year. This  fact points to some of the most general causes of conflagrations--as in  the lighting and heating of houses, factories, etc., where this had not  been necessary during the summer months. It is also found that after the  first of the year the number of fires is greatly diminished, the  lighting and heating arrangements having been subjected to a period of  trial during which their most obvious defects would be remedied. While  it may readily be conceded that the utmost care of the owner of property  could not totally prevent great average losses from fire--for the  greater the holdings the more must the proprietor trust to the oversight  of others--it is evident that the above facts indicate the necessity of  more strenuous precautions at this season. Gas pipes and fittings should  then be tested; furnace flues and settings looked to; stove, heater, and  grate fixtures and connections examined--and in all these particulars  the scrutiny should be most closely directed to parts ordinarily covered  up or out of sight, so that any defect or weakness from long disuse may  be exposed. When to the above causes of fires we have added the  extremely fruitful one found in the extensive use of coal oil within a  few years past, we have indicated the most common sources of  conflagrations of known origin. An English authority gives the  percentages of different causes of 30,000 fires in London, from 1833 to  1865, as follows: Candles, 11.07; curtains, 9.71; flues, 7.80; gas,  7.65; sparks, 4.47; stoves, 1.67; children playing, 1.59; matches, 1.41;  smoking tobacco, 1.40, other known causes, 19.40; unknown causes, 32.88.  The foregoing figures do not give the percentage of incendiary fires,  and later statistics would, no doubt, show vastly more fires from the  use of kerosene than are here attributed to candles.    The prevention of fires, and the best means of minimizing the loss when  they do occur, are topics which cover a wide field, and a collection of  the literature on the subject would make a very respectable library. As  the question presents itself to-day, it may well be doubted whether the  general practice of large property holders of insuring all their  possessions does not tend to lessen the constant vigilance which is the  most essential requisite in preventing fires. Thousands of merchants  never mean to keep a dollar's worth of goods in store or warehouse that  is not fully covered by insurance, and they make this cost a regular  charge upon their business as peremptorily as they do the wages paid the  hands in their employ. But few manufacturers can so completely cover  their risks by insurance, yet a large portion of them do so as far as  they are able. It does not follow but that the larger portion of both  merchants and manufacturers exercise what the law will fully decide is  \"due vigilance\" in the care of the property so insured, but it is  evident that in most cases the thoughtfulness is much less complete--the  care wonderfully lacking in personal supervision--as compared with what  would be the case were each one his own insurer. Of course, this in no  way casts a doubt upon the general policy of business men being amply  insured, but in fact shows the greater necessity why they should be so,  that they may not suffer from the carelessness of a neighbor; it also  points to the necessity of continually increasing care and thoroughness  of inspection on the part of the insurance companies. These agencies, in  fact, must compel the insured to keep up to the mark in the introduction  of every improvement to ward off fires or diminish their  destructiveness. The progress made in this department during recent  years has been great. The almost universal use of steam has been  attended by the fitting up of factories with force pumps, hose, and all  the appliances of a modern fire brigade; dangerous rooms are metal  sheathed, and machinery likely to cause fire is surrounded by stationary  pipes from which jets of water may be turned on instantaneously from the  outside; stores and warehouses have standing pipes from which every  floor may be flooded with water under pressure, and the elevators, those  most dangerous flues for rapidly spreading a fire, are either bricked in  entirely or supposed to be closed at every floor. The latter point,  however, is sometimes forgotten, as sea captains forget to keep the  divisions of their vessels having watertight compartments separate from  one another; the open elevator enlarges a small fire as rapidly as the  open compartment allows the vessel to sink.    With the best of appliances, however, discipline and drill on the part  of the hands, in all factories, is of prime importance. It is always in  the first stages of a fire that thoroughly efficient action is  necessary, and here it is worth a thousand-fold more than can be any  efforts after a fire is once thoroughly started. Long immunity is apt to  beget a feeling of security, and the carelessness resulting from  overconfidence has been the means of destroying many valuable factories  which were amply provided with every facility for their own  preservation. The teachers in some of the public schools of New York and  Brooklyn, during the past year, set an example which some of our  millowners might profitably follow. There have been cases when, from a  sudden alarm of fire, children have been crushed in their crowding to  get out of the building. The teachers, in the instances referred to,  marched their children out, under discipline, as if there had been a  fire. Let owners of factories try some such plan as this, by which  workmen may be called upon to cope with an imaginary fire, and many of  them will, we venture to say, find means of improving their present  system or appliances for protection, elaborate as they may at present  think them to be.           *       *       *       *       *          WHAT IS LIGHT?
