THE AUTHOR AND THE PLAY      Concerning the life, the date, and the very identity[2] of  King Shudraka, the reputed author of The Little Clay Cart,  we are curiously ignorant. No other work is ascribed to him, and  we have no direct information about him, beyond the somewhat  fanciful statements of the Prologue to this play. There are, to be  sure, many tales which cluster about the name of King Shudraka,  but none of them represents him as an author. Yet our very lack of  information may prove, to some extent at least, a disguised blessing.  For our ignorance of external fact compels a closer study of  the text, if we would find out what manner of man it was who  wrote the play. And the case of King Shudraka is by no means  unique in India; in regard to every great Sanskrit writer,--so bare  is Sanskrit literature of biography,--we are forced to concentrate  attention on the man as he reveals himself in his works. First, however,  it may be worth while to compare Shudraka with two other  great dramatists of India, and thus to discover, if we may, in what  ways he excels them or is excelled by them.    Kalidasa, Shudraka, Bhavabhuti--assuredly, these are the greatest  names in the history of the Indian drama. So different are these  men, and so great, that it is not possible to assert for any one of  them such supremacy as Shakspere holds in the English drama.  It is true that Kalidasa's dramatic masterpiece, the Shakuntala,  is the most widely known of the Indian plays. It is true that the  tender and elegant Kalidasa has been called, with a not wholly fortunate  enthusiasm, the \"Shakspere of India.\" But this rather exclusive  admiration of the Shakuntala results from lack of information  about the other great Indian dramas. Indeed, it is partly due  to the accident that only the Shakuntala became known in translation  at a time when romantic Europe was in full sympathy with  the literature of India.    Bhavabhuti, too, is far less widely known than Kalidasa; and for this  the reason is deeper-seated. The austerity of Bhavabhuti's style, his  lack of humor, his insistent grandeur, are qualities which prevent his  being a truly popular poet. With reference to Kalidasa, he holds a  position such as Aeschylus holds with reference to Euripides. He will  always seem to minds that sympathize with his grandeur[3] the greatest  of Indian poets; while by other equally discerning minds of another  order he will be admired, but not passionately loved.    Yet however great the difference between Kalidasa, \"the grace  of poetry,\"[4] and Bhavabhuti, \"the master of eloquence,\"[5] these two  authors are far more intimately allied in spirit than is either of  them with the author of The Little Clay Cart. Kalidasa and Bhavabhuti  are Hindus of the Hindus; the Shakuntala and the Latter  Acts of Rama could have been written nowhere save in India:  but Shudraka, alone in the long line of Indian dramatists, has a  cosmopolitan character. Shakuntala is a Hindu maid, Madhava is  a Hindu hero; but Sansthanaka and Maitreya and Madanika are  citizens of the world. In some of the more striking characteristics of  Sanskrit literature--in its fondness for system, its elaboration of  style, its love of epigram--Kalidasa and Bhavabhuti are far truer  to their native land than is Shudraka. In Shudraka we find few  of those splendid phrases in which, as the Chinese[6] say, \"it is only  the words which stop, the sense goes on,\"--phrases like Kalidasa's[7]  \"there are doors of the inevitable everywhere,\" or Bhavabhuti's[8] \"for  causeless love there is no remedy.\" As regards the predominance of  swift-moving action over the poetical expression of great truths,  The Little Clay Cart stands related to the Latter Acts of Rama as  Macbeth does to Hamlet. Again, Shudraka's style is simple and direct,  a rare quality in a Hindu; and although this style, in the passages  of higher emotion, is of an exquisite simplicity, yet Shudraka  cannot infuse into mere language the charm which we find in Kalidasa  or the majesty which we find in Bhavabhuti.    Yet Shudraka's limitations in regard to stylistic power are not  without their compensation. For love of style slowly strangled originality  and enterprise in Indian poets, and ultimately proved the  death of Sanskrit literature. Now just at this point, where other  Hindu writers are weak, Shudraka stands forth preeminent. Nowhere  else in the hundreds of Sanskrit dramas do we find such variety,  and such drawing of character, as in The Little Clay Cart;  and nowhere else, in the drama at least, is there such humor. Let  us consider, a little more in detail, these three characteristics of  our author; his variety, his skill in the drawing of character, his  humor.    To gain a rough idea of Shudraka's variety, we have only to recall  the names of the acts of the play. Here The Shampooer who  Gambled and The Hole in the Wall are shortly followed by The  Storm; and The Swapping of the Bullock-carts is closely succeeded  by The Strangling of Vasantasena. From farce to tragedy, from  satire to pathos, runs the story, with a breadth truly Shaksperian.  Here we have philosophy:        _The lack of money is the root of all evil._                 (_i. 14_)    And pathos:        _My body wet by tear-drops falling, falling;        My limbs polluted by the clinging mud;      Flowers from the graveyard torn, my wreath appalling;      For ghastly sacrifice hoarse ravens calling,        And for the fragrant incense of my blood._                 (_x. 3_)    And nature description:        _But mistress, do not scold the lightning. She is your friend,                    This golden cord that trembles on the breast                    Of great Airavata; upon the crest                      Of rocky hills this banner all ablaze;                    This lamp tn Indra's palace; but most blest                      As telling where your most beloved stays._   (_v. 33_)    And genuine bitterness:        _Pride and tricks and lies and fraud        Are in your face;      False playground of the lustful god,        Such is your face;      The wench's stock in trade, in fine,      Epitome of joys divine,        I mean your face--      For sale! the price is courtesy.      I trust you'll find a man to buy        Your face._                                                (_v. 36_)    It is natural that Shudraka should choose for the expression of  matters so diverse that type of drama which gives the greatest  scope to the author's creative power. This type is the so-called  \"drama of invention,\"[9] a category curiously subordinated in India  to the heroic drama, the plot of which is drawn from history or  mythology. Indeed, The Little Clay Cart is the only extant drama  which fulfils the spirit of the drama of invention, as defined by the  Sanskrit canons of dramaturgy. The plot of the \"Malati and Madhava,\"  or of the \"Mallika and Maruta,\" is in no true sense the invention  of the author; and The Little Clay Cart is the only drama  of invention which is \"full of rascals.\"[10]    But a spirit so powerful as that of King Shudraka could not be  confined within the strait-jacket of the minute, and sometimes  puerile, rules of the technical works. In the very title of the drama,  he has disregarded the rule[11] that the name of a drama of invention  should be formed by compounding the names of heroine and hero.[12]  Again, the books prescribe[13] that the hero shall appear in every act;  yet Charudatta does not appear in acts ii., iv., vi., and viii. And  further, various characters, Vasantasena, Maitreya, the courtier,  and others, have vastly gained because they do not conform too  closely to the technical definitions.    The characters of The Little Clay Cart are living men and women. Even  when the type makes no strong appeal to Western minds, as in the case  of Charudatta, the character lives, in a sense in which Dushyanta[14]  or even Rama[15] can hardly be said to live. Shudraka's men are better  individualized than his women; this fact alone differentiates him  sharply from other Indian dramatists. He draws on every class of  society, from the high-souled Brahman to the executioner and the  housemaid.    His greatest character is unquestionably Sansthanaka, this  combination of ignorant conceit, brutal lust, and cunning, this greater  than Cloten, who, after strangling an innocent woman, can say:[16]  \"Oh, come! Let's go and play in the pond.\" Most attractive characters  are the five[17] conspirators, men whose home is \"east of Suez  and the ten commandments.\" They live from hand to mouth, ready  at any moment to steal a gem-casket or to take part in a revolution,  and preserving through it all their character as gentlemen and their  irresistible conceit. And side by side with them moves the hero  Charudatta, the Buddhist beau-ideal of manhood,        _A tree of life to them whose sorrows grow_,      _Beneath its fruit of virtue bending low_.                   (_i. 48_)    To him, life itself is not dear, but only honor.[18] He values wealth  only as it supplies him with the means of serving others. We may,  with some justice, compare him with Antonio in The Merchant  of Venice. There is some inconsistency, from our point of view,  in making such a character the hero of a love-drama; and indeed,  it is Vasantasena who does most of the love-making.[19]    Vasantasena is a character with neither the girlish charm of  Shakuntala[20] nor the mature womanly dignity of Sita.[21] She is  more admirable than lovable. Witty and wise she is, and in her  love as true as steel; this too, in a social position which makes such  constancy difficult. Yet she cannot be called a great character; she  does not seem so true to life as her clever maid, Madanika. In  making the heroine of his play a courtezan, Shudraka follows a  suggestion of the technical works on the drama; he does not  thereby cast any imputation"]]]
