The chiefs who ventured  to oppose him were taken off one after another by secret means, or were  compelled to flee for safety to other tribes.  His subtlety and artifices  had acquired for him the reputation of a wizard.  He knew, they say, what  was going on at a distance as well as if he were present; and he could  destroy his enemies by some magical art, while he himself was far away.  In spite of the fear which he inspired, his domination would probably not  have been endured by an Indian community, but for his success in war.  He  had made himself and his people a terror to the Cayugas and the Senecas.  According to one account, he had subdued both of those tribes; but the  record-keepers of the present day do not confirm this statement, which  indeed is not consistent with the subsequent history of the confederation.    The name Atotarho signifies \"entangled.\"  The usual process by which  mythology, after a few generations, makes fables out of names, has not  been wanting here.  In the legends which the Indian story-tellers recount  in winter about their cabin fires, Atotarho figures as a being of  preterhuman nature, whose head, in lieu of hair, is adorned with living  snakes.  A rude pictorial representation shows him seated and giving  audience, in horrible state, with the upper part of his person enveloped  by these writhing and entangled reptiles.  But the grave Councillors of  the Canadian Reservation, who recite his history as they have heard it  from their fathers at every installation of a high chief, do not repeat  these inventions of marvel-loving gossips, and only smile with  good-humored derision when they are referred to.    There was at this time among the Onondagas a chief of high rank whose  name, variously written--Hiawatha, Hayonwatha, Ayongwhata,  Taoungwatha--is rendered, \"he who seeks the wampum belt.\"  He had made  himself greatly esteemed by his wisdom and his benevolence.  He was now  past middle age.  Though many of his friends and relatives had perished  by the machinations of Atotarho, he himself had been spared.  The  qualities which gained him general respect had, perhaps, not been without  influence even on that redoubtable chief.  Hiawatha had long beheld with  grief the evils which afflicted not only his own nation, but all the  other tribes about them, through the continual wars in which they were  engaged, and the misgovernment and miseries at home which these wars  produced.  With much meditation he had elaborated in his mind the scheme  of a vast confederation which would ensure universal peace.  In the mere  plan of a confederation there was nothing new.  There are probably few,  if any, Indian tribes which have not, at one time or another, been  members of a league or confederacy.  It may almost be said to be their  normal condition.  But the plan which Hiawatha had evolved differed from  all others in two particulars.  The system which he devised was to be not  a loose and transitory league, but a permanent government.  While each  nation was to retain its own council and its management of local affairs,  the general control was to be lodged in a federal senate, composed of  representatives elected by each nation, holding office during good  behavior, and acknowledged as ruling chiefs throughout the whole  confederacy.  Still further, and more remarkably, the confederation was  not to be a limited one.  It was to be indefinitely expansible.  The  avowed design of its proposer was to abolish war altogether.  He wished  the federation to extend until all the tribes of men should be included  in it, and peace should everywhere reign.  Such is the positive testimony  of the Iroquois themselves; and their statement, as will be seen, is  supported by historical evidence.    Hiawatha's first endeavor was to enlist his own nation in the cause.  He  summoned a meeting of the chiefs and people of the Onondaga towns.  The  summons, proceeding from a chief of his rank and reputation, attracted a  large concourse.  \"They came together,\" said the narrator, \"along the  creeks, from all parts, to the general council-fire.\"  But what effect  the grand projects of the chief, enforced by the eloquence for which he  was noted, might have had upon his auditors, could not be known.  For  there appeared among them a well-known figure, grim, silent and  forbidding, whose terrible aspect overawed the assemblage.  The unspoken  displeasure of Atotarho was sufficient to stifle all debate, and the  meeting dispersed.  This result, which seems a singular conclusion of an  Indian council--the most independent and free-spoken of all  gatherings--is sufficiently explained by the fact that Atotarho had  organized among the more reckless warriors of his tribe a band of  unscrupulous partisans, who did his bidding without question, and took  off by secret murder all persons against whom he bore a grudge.  The  knowledge that his followers were scattered through the assembly,  prepared to mark for destruction those who should offend him, might make  the boldest orator chary of speech.  Hiawatha alone was undaunted.  He  summoned a second meeting, which was attended by a smaller number, and  broke up as before, in confusion, on Atotarho's appearance.  The  unwearied reformer sent forth his runners a third time; but the people  were disheartened.  When the day of the council arrived, no one attended.  Then, continued the narrator, Hiawatha seated himself on the ground in  sorrow.  He enveloped his head in his mantle of skins, and remained for a  long time bowed down in grief and thought.  At length he arose and left  the town, taking his course toward the southeast.  He had formed a bold  design.  As the councils of his own nation were closed to him, he would  have recourse to those of other tribes.  At a short distance from the  town (so minutely are the circumstances recounted) he passed his great  antagonist, seated near a well-known spring, stern and silent as usual.  No word passed between the determined representatives of war and peace;  but it was doubtless not without a sensation of triumphant pleasure that  the ferocious war-chief saw his only rival and opponent in council going  into what seemed to be voluntary exile.  Hiawatha plunged into the  forest; he climbed mountains; he crossed a lake; he floated down the  Mohawk river in a canoe.  Many incidents of his journey are told, and in  this part of the narrative alone some occurrences of a marvellous cast  are related even by the official historians.  Indeed, the flight of  Hiawatha from Onondaga to the country of the Mohawks is to the Five  Nations what the flight of Mohammed from Mecca to Medina is to the  votaries of Islam.  It is the turning point of their history.  In  embellishing the narrative at this point, their imagination has been  allowed a free course.  Leaving aside these marvels, however, we need  only refer here to a single incident which may well enough have been of  actual occurrence.  A lake which Hiawatha crossed had shores abounding in  small white shells.  These he gathered and strung upon strings, which he  disposed upon his breast, as a token to all whom he should meet that he  came as a messenger of peace.  And this, according to one authority, was  the origin of wampum, of which Hiawatha was the inventor.  That honor,  however, is one which must be denied to him.  The evidence of sepulchral  relics shows that wampum was known to the mysterious moundbuilders, as  well as in all succeeding ages.  Moreover, if the significance of white  wampum-strings as a token of peace had not been well known in his day,  Hiawatha would not have relied upon them as a means of proclaiming his  pacific purpose.    Early one morning he arrived at a Mohawk town, the residence of the noted  chief Dekanawidah, whose name, in point of celebrity, ranks in Iroquois  tradition with those of Hiawatha and Atotarho.  It is probable that he  was known by reputation to Hiawatha, and not unlikely that they were  related.  According to one account Dekanawidah was an Onondaga, adopted  among the Mohawks.  Another narrative makes him a Mohawk by birth.  The  probability seems to be that he was the son of an Onondaga father, who  had been adopted by the Mohawks, and of a Mohawk mother.  That he was not  of pure Mohawk blood is shown by the fact, which is remembered, that his  father had had successively three wives, one belonging to each of the  three clans, Bear, Wolf, and Turtle, which compose the Mohawk nation.  If  the father had been a Mohawk, he would have belonged to one of the Mohawk  clans, and could not then (according to the Indian law) have married into  it.  He had seven sons, including Dekanawidah, who, with their families,  dwelt together in one of the \"long houses\" common in that day among the  Iroquois.  These ties of kindred, together with this fraternal strength,  and his reputation as a sagacious councillor, gave Dekanawidah great  influence among his people.  But, in the Indian sense, he was not the  leading chief.  This position belonged to Tekarihoken (better known in  books as Tecarihoga) whose primacy as the first chief of the eldest among  the Iroquois nations was then, and is still, universally admitted.  Each  nation has always had a head-chief, to whom belonged the hereditary right  and duty of lighting the council-fire, and taking the first place in  public meetings.  But among the Indians, as in other communities,  hereditary rank and personal influence do not always, or indeed  ordinarily, go together.  If Hiawatha could gain over Dekanawidah to his  views, he would have done much toward the accomplishment of his purposes.    In the early dawn he seated himself on a fallen trunk, near the spring  from which the inhabitants of the long-house drew their water.  Presently  one of the brothers came out with a vessel of elm-bark, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22605"],[0,"Book-Lovers, Bibliomaniacs and Book Clubs (#2)"],[1,"ibliophiles, and as well increase in demand and price  whenever thereafter its copies may \"turn up\" for sale.    Next in importance, after considering literary and mechanical fitness,  and the limitation of the work, is the question of distribution; its  scope, and the class of subscribers. The stock of a corporation, if  limited to a reasonable number of shares and issued only to a few expert  investors of high standing, and for tangible considerations, will  obviously be considered a safer and more attractive investment than if  it be scattered indiscriminately among a class of professional  manipulators for stock-jobbing purposes. With such a stock where thus  closely held for investment purposes, an order for a few shares may  largely elevate its market value. But if the stock were issued in  unlimited quantities, the monetary value would be entirely lost. Again,  if the stock had no corporeal assets as a basis for its issue, the  \"limited and registered\" clause could not sustain it in the market.    So it is with books: if the number of copies issued be held within a  reasonable constraint, consistent with the price charged per copy, and  if they are subscribed for by book-lovers who prize them for their  literary or historic value and luxurious appearance no less than for  pecuniary values, they are not likely to find their way into the  bookstalls, or to be \"picked up\" in auction rooms at less than their  original price. This condition applies particularly to legitimate club  editions and privately printed editions. If an edition of five hundred  copies is widely distributed throughout the country, it is reasonable  to assume that the speculative market therefor would be less apt to  suffer from congestion than if the sale of the whole number of sets  were confined to one locality.    [Illustration]    Passing now to those who, in one way or another, are to meet with  and handle the completed book, we may begin with a class of _literary  barnacles_ who stick about the libraries of their friends and of the  public institutions, and feed their bibliophilistic appetites on what  others have spent much time and money in collecting. These may perhaps  more appropriately be called biblio-spongers, and are of all ranks in  the community, many even owning beautiful homes, and having ample  resources at command; but while enjoying the congenial atmosphere of a  well-furnished library, and the delights of caressing the precious and  wisely selected tomes of others, they are still of such temperaments  that they would no more think of _buying_ books than would another of  buying an opera-house in order to satisfy theatre-going propensities.  These people should be taught that fine books, like friends, are not  loanable or exchangeable chattels. They will argue that there is no  use spending money for books, because they reside within easy reach of  a public library where such books as they desire are readily  obtainable, or perhaps suggest that \"I have free access to my friend  Smith's library; he scarcely ever uses it;\" without reflecting that  Smith would probably use it more, if his friends used it less. And yet  such folk will still incur the needless expense of providing their own  homes with chairs, unless, haply, such homes may chance to be within  convenient reach of some park or public institution where _free_ seats  are provided.    Most of us are disposed to idealize a besotted bibliomaniac as a  harmless being whose companionship and favor are neither to be courted  nor particularly avoided,--a sort of shellfish basking on the bank of  life's flow in whatever sunshine it may absorb, and paying little heed  to the thoughts or actions of others.    The following curious inscription which is found on an old  copperplate print of the famous bibliomaniac, John Murray, will  illustrate one of the varieties:--        Hoh Maister John Murray of Sacomb,      The Works of old Time to collect was his pride,        Till Oblivion dreaded his Care:      Regardless of Friends, intestate he dy'd,        So the Rooks and the Crows were his Heir.    Mr. Nathan Haskell Dole, President of The Bibliophile Society, aptly  describes a miserly bibliomaniac as a        Victim of a frenzied passion,        He is lean and lank and crusty;      Naught he cares for dress or fashion        And his rusty coat smells musty;    while in characterizing the natural impulses of true bibliophilism, he  says that        Bibliophiles take pride in showing        All the gems of their collections;      They are generous in bestowing,        They have genuine affections.    Peignot says a bibliomaniac is one who has \"a passion for possessing  books; not so much to be instructed by them as to gratify the eye by  looking on them.\" This presumption is about as reasonable as it would  be to say that a man is a monomaniac because he gets married when he  is in no special need of a house-servant, or body-guard.    In his _Bibliomania_ Dibdin enumerates eight symptoms of this \"darling  passion or insanity,\" in the following order: \"A passion for  large-paper copies, uncut copies, extra-illustrated copies, unique  copies, copies printed on vellum, first editions, true editions, and  black-letter copies.\"    The first of these should be omitted from the symptomatic category:  it would be fallacy to assume that one is a maniac because one admires  the ample margins and paramount qualities of these large-paper copies,  which Dibdin himself says are \"printed upon paper of a larger  dimension and superior quality than the ordinary copies. The presswork  and ink are always proportionately better in these copies, and the  price of them is enhanced according to their beauty and rarity. . . .  That a volume so published has a more pleasing aspect cannot be  denied.\" He adds that \"this symptom of the bibliomania is at the  present day both general and violent.\" No wonder! And yet the charming  Dr. Ferriar dips his pen in gall and writes the following satirical  lines upon this highly commendable \"weakness:\"--        But devious oft, from every classic Muse,      The keen collector, meaner paths will choose.      And first the margin's breadth his soul employs,      Pure, snowy, broad, the type of nobler joys.      In vain might Homer roll the tide of song,      Or Horace smile, or Tully charm the throng,      If, crost by Pallas' ire, the trenchant blade      Or too oblique or near the edge invade,      The Bibliomane exclaims with haggard eye,      \"No margin!\"--turns in haste, and scorns to buy.    Dibdin ventures to further assert that \"the day is not far distant  when _females_ will begin to have as high a relish for large-paper  copies of every work as their male rivals.\" If he could return to this  sphere and behold the enormously increased number of women  bibliophiles in our country at the present time, the subject would  doubtless furnish him with a congenial theme for another of his  rambling discourses, this time perhaps under the caption of  _Bibliowomania_. He was far in advance of the age in which he lived;  for although he had very little upon which to base the prediction, he  yet prophesied that not many years would lapse before women would  invade the fields of book-collecting and prove themselves valiant  competitors in the market. This, in fact, is now common enough, and I  myself have known of many instances in auction-rooms where a small  army of rampant bibliomaniacs have been obliged to retreat and to  abandon their pursuit of some coveted treasure, on finding it boldly  covered by a _carte-blanche_ order from a feminine competitor. Women  rarely appear in the book auction-room, but leave their orders to be  executed through a trusted broker, and many a collector has found  himself suddenly obliged to soar aloft to dizzy heights in quest of  some prize, on being thus lifted and pursued by one of the  representatives of an unseen and unknown member of the gentler sex.    Many people suppose the term \"uncut,\" characteristic of Dibdin's  second \"symptom,\" to signify that the leaves of such volume as may be  concerned have never been severed, whether for convenience of reading  or otherwise. \"Uncut,\" however, in its technical sense does not imply  that the sheets are folded and bound just as they came from the press.  The leaves may all be cut, and the tops trimmed, and even gilded,  without striking terror to the heart of the bibliomaniac. Dibdin,  indeed, treats this last mentioned symptom in merely a superficial way  and dismisses it with a few cursory remarks, viz: \"It may be defined a  passion to possess books of which the edges have never been sheared by  the binder's tools.\" This definition is vague and unsatisfactory. Mr.  Adrian H. Joline (_Diversions of a Booklover_, Harper & Bros., New  York, 1903,--a charming book that should be read by every  book-fancier) discourses upon the subject more intelligently; he  observes that the word _uncut_ appears to be a stumbling-block to the  unwary, and says: \"The casual purchaser is sometimes deceived by it,  for he thinks that it means that the leaves have not been severed by  the paper-knife. I have read with much glee divers indignant letters  in the very interesting 'Saturday Review' of one of our best New York  journals, in which the barbarian writers have denounced the _uncut_,  and have assailed in vigorous but misguided phrases those who prefer  to have their books in that condition. Henry Stevens tells us that  even such a famous collector as James Lenox, founder of the splendid  library into whose magnificent mysteries so few of us dare to  penetrate, was misled by the word _uncut_, and chided Stevens for  buying an _uncut_ book whose pages were all open. He says: 'Again when  his tastes had grown into the mysteries of _uncut_ leaves, he returned  a very rare, early New England tract, expensively bound, because it  did not answer the description of _uncut_ in the invoice, for the  "]]]
