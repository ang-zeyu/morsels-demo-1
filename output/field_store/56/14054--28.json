[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20387"],[0,"A Thin Ghost and Others (#2)"],[1," was  usual.    These generalities I gather from the doctor's notes in his diary and  from letters. They are generalities, and we should like, in view of  what has to be told, something sharper and more detailed. We get it in  entries which begin late in the year, and, I think, were posted up all  together after the final incident; but they cover so few days in all  that there is no need to doubt that the writer could remember the  course of things accurately.    On a Friday morning it was that a fox, or perhaps a cat, made away  with Mrs. Ashton's most prized black cockerel, a bird without a single  white feather on its body. Her husband had told her often enough that  it would make a suitable sacrifice to AEsculapius; that had discomfited  her much, and now she would hardly be consoled. The boys looked  everywhere for traces of it: Lord Saul brought in a few feathers,  which seemed to have been partially burnt on the garden rubbish-heap.  It was on the same day that Dr. Ashton, looking out of an upper  window, saw the two boys playing in the corner of the garden at a game  he did not understand. Frank was looking earnestly at something in the  palm of his hand. Saul stood behind him and seemed to be listening.  After some minutes he very gently laid his hand on Frank's head, and  almost instantly thereupon, Frank suddenly dropped whatever it was  that he was holding, clapped his hands to his eyes, and sank down on  the grass. Saul, whose face expressed great anger, hastily picked the  object up, of which it could only be seen that it was glittering, put  it in his pocket, and turned away, leaving Frank huddled up on the  grass. Dr. Ashton rapped on the window to attract their attention, and  Saul looked up as if in alarm, and then springing to Frank, pulled him  up by the arm and led him away. When they came in to dinner, Saul  explained that they had been acting a part of the tragedy of  Radamistus, in which the heroine reads the future fate of her father's  kingdom by means of a glass ball held in her hand, and is overcome by  the terrible events she has seen. During this explanation Frank said  nothing, only looked rather bewilderedly at Saul. He must, Mrs. Ashton  thought, have contracted a chill from the wet of the grass, for that  evening he was certainly feverish and disordered; and the disorder was  of the mind as well as the body, for he seemed to have something he  wished to say to Mrs. Ashton, only a press of household affairs  prevented her from paying attention to him; and when she went,  according to her habit, to see that the light in the boys' chamber had  been taken away, and to bid them good-night, he seemed to be sleeping,  though his face was unnaturally flushed, to her thinking: Lord Saul,  however, was pale and quiet, and smiling in his slumber.    Next morning it happened that Dr. Ashton was occupied in church and  other business, and unable to take the boys' lessons. He therefore set  them tasks to be written and brought to him. Three times, if not  oftener, Frank knocked at the study door, and each time the doctor  chanced to be engaged with some visitor, and sent the boy off rather  roughly, which he later regretted. Two clergymen were at dinner this  day, and both remarked--being fathers of families--that the lad seemed  sickening for a fever, in which they were too near the truth, and it  had been better if he had been put to bed forthwith: for a couple of  hours later in the afternoon he came running into the house, crying  out in a way that was really terrifying, and rushing to Mrs. Ashton,  clung about her, begging her to protect him, and saying, \"Keep them  off! keep them off!\" without intermission. And it was now evident that  some sickness had taken strong hold of him. He was therefore got to  bed in another chamber from that in which he commonly lay, and the  physician brought to him: who pronounced the disorder to be grave and  affecting the lad's brain, and prognosticated a fatal end to it if  strict quiet were not observed, and those sedative remedies used which  he should prescribe.    We are now come by another way to the point we had reached before. The  minster clock has been stopped from striking, and Lord Saul is on the  threshold of the study.    \"What account can you give of this poor lad's state?\" was Dr. Ashton's  first question. \"Why, sir, little more than you know already, I fancy.  I must blame myself, though, for giving him a fright yesterday when we  were acting that foolish play you saw. I fear I made him take it more  to heart than I meant.\" \"How so?\" \"Well, by telling him foolish tales  I had picked up in Ireland of what we call the second sight.\"  \"_Second_ sight! What kind of sight might that be?\" \"Why, you know our  ignorant people pretend that some are able to foresee what is to  come--sometimes in a glass, or in the air, maybe, and at Kildonan we  had an old woman that pretended to such a power. And I daresay I  coloured the matter more highly than I should: but I never dreamed  Frank would take it so near as he did.\" \"You were wrong, my lord, very  wrong, in meddling with such superstitious matters at all, and you  should have considered whose house you were in, and how little  becoming such actions are to my character and person or to your own:  but pray how came it that you, acting, as you say, a play, should fall  upon anything that could so alarm Frank?\" \"That is what I can hardly  tell, sir: he passed all in a moment from rant about battles and  lovers and Cleodora and Antigenes to something I could not follow at  all, and then dropped down as you saw.\" \"Yes: was that at the moment  when you laid your hand on the top of his head?\" Lord Saul gave a  quick look at his questioner--quick and spiteful--and for the first  time seemed unready with an answer. \"About that time it may have  been,\" he said. \"I have tried to recollect myself, but I am not sure.  There was, at any rate, no significance in what I did then.\" \"Ah!\"  said Dr. Ashton, \"well, my lord, I should do wrong were I not to tell  you that this fright of my poor nephew may have very ill consequences  to him. The doctor speaks very despondingly of his state.\" Lord Saul  pressed his hands together and looked earnestly upon Dr. Ashton. \"I am  willing to believe you had no bad intention, as assuredly you could  have no reason to bear the poor boy malice: but I cannot wholly free  you from blame in the affair.\" As he spoke, the hurrying steps were  heard again, and Mrs. Ashton came quickly into the room, carrying a  candle, for the evening had by this time closed in. She was greatly  agitated. \"O come!\" she cried, \"come directly. I'm sure he is going.\"  \"Going? Frank? Is it possible? Already?\" With some such incoherent  words the doctor caught up a book of prayers from the table and ran  out after his wife. Lord Saul stopped for a moment where he was.  Molly, the maid, saw him bend over and put both hands to his face. If  it were the last words she had to speak, she said afterwards, he was  striving to keep back a fit of laughing. Then he went out softly,  following the others.    Mrs. Ashton was sadly right in her forecast. I have no inclination to  imagine the last scene in detail. What Dr. Ashton records is, or may  be taken to be, important to the story. They asked Frank if he would  like to see his companion, Lord Saul, once again. The boy was quite  collected, it appears, in these moments. \"No,\" he said, \"I do not want  to see him; but you should tell him I am afraid he will be very cold.\"  \"What do you mean, my dear?\" said Mrs. Ashton. \"Only that;\" said  Frank, \"but say to him besides that I am free of them now, but he  should take care. And I am sorry about your black cockerel, Aunt  Ashton; but he said we must use it so, if we were to see all that  could be seen.\"    Not many minutes after, he was gone. Both the Ashtons were grieved,  she naturally most; but the doctor, though not an emotional man, felt  the pathos of the early death: and, besides, there was the growing  suspicion that all had not been told him by Saul, and that there was  something here which was out of his beaten track. When he left the  chamber of death, it was to walk across the quadrangle of the  residence to the sexton's house. A passing bell, the greatest of the  minster bells, must be rung, a grave must be dug in the minster yard,  and there was now no need to silence the chiming of the minster clock.  As he came slowly back in the dark, he thought he must see Lord Saul  again. That matter of the black cockerel--trifling as it might  seem--would have to be cleared up. It might be merely a fancy of the  sick boy, but if not, was there not a witch-trial he had read, in  which some grim little rite of sacrifice had played a part? Yes, he  must see Saul.    I rather guess these thoughts of his than find written authority for  them. That there was another interview is certain: certain also that  Saul would (or, as he said, could) throw no light on Frank's words:  though the message, or some part of it, appeared to affect him  horribly. But there is no record of the talk in detail. It is only  said that Saul sat all that evening in the study, and when he bid  good-night, which he did most reluctantly, asked for the doctor's  prayers.    The month of January was near its end when Lord Kildonan, in the  Embassy at Lisbon, received a letter that for once gravely disturbed  that vain man and neglectful father. Saul was dead. The scene at  Frank's burial had been very distressing. The day was awful in  blackness and wind: the bearers, staggering blindly along under the  flapping black pall, found it a hard job, when they emerged from the  porch of the minster, to make their way to the grave. Mrs. Ashton was  in her room--women did not then go to their kinsfolk's funerals--but  Saul was there, draped in the mourning cloak of the time, and his face  was white and fixed as that of one dead, except when, as was noticed"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20390"],[0,"Elements of Structural and Systematic Botany (#2)"],[1,"                    237          BOTANY.          CHAPTER I.    INTRODUCTION.      All matter is composed of certain constituents (about seventy are at  present known), which, so far as the chemist is concerned, are  indivisible, and are known as elements.    Of the innumerable combinations of these elements, two general classes  may be recognized, organic and inorganic bodies. While it is  impossible, owing to the dependence of all organized matter upon  inorganic matter, to give an absolute definition, we at once recognize  the peculiarities of organic or living bodies as distinguished from  inorganic or non-living ones. All living bodies feed, grow, and  reproduce, these acts being the result of the action of forces  resident within the organism. Inorganic bodies, on the other hand,  remain, as a rule, unchanged so long as they are not acted upon by  external forces.    All living organisms are dependent for existence upon inorganic  matter, and sooner or later return these elements to the sources  whence they came. Thus, a plant extracts from the earth and air  certain inorganic compounds which are converted by the activity of the  plant into a part of its own substance, becoming thus incorporated  into a living organism. After the plant dies, however, it undergoes  decomposition, and the elements are returned again to the earth and  atmosphere from which they were taken.    Investigation has shown that living bodies contain comparatively few  elements, but these are combined into extraordinarily complex  compounds. The following elements appear to be essential to all living  bodies: carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, sulphur, potassium.  Besides these there are several others usually present, but not  apparently essential to all organisms. These include phosphorus, iron,  calcium, sodium, magnesium, chlorine, silicon.    As we examine more closely the structure and functions of organic  bodies, an extraordinary uniformity is apparent in all of them. This  is disguised in the more specialized forms, but in the simpler ones is  very apparent. Owing to this any attempt to separate absolutely the  animal and vegetable kingdoms proves futile.    The science that treats of living things, irrespective of the  distinction between plant and animal, is called \"Biology,\" but for  many purposes it is desirable to recognize the distinctions, making  two departments of Biology,--Botany, treating of plants; and Zooelogy,  of animals. It is with the first of these only that we shall concern  ourselves here.    When one takes up a plant his attention is naturally first drawn to  its general appearance and structure, whether it is a complicated one  like one of the flowering plants, or some humbler member of the  vegetable kingdom,--a moss, seaweed, toadstool,--or even some still  simpler plant like a mould, or the apparently structureless green scum  that floats on a stagnant pond. In any case the impulse is to  investigate the form and structure as far as the means at one's  disposal will permit. Such a study of structure constitutes  \"Morphology,\" which includes two departments,--gross anatomy, or a  general study of the parts; and minute anatomy, or \"Histology,\" in  which a microscopic examination is made of the structure of the  different parts. A special department of Morphology called  \"Embryology\" is often recognized. This embraces a study of the  development of the organism from its earliest stage, and also the  development of its different members.    From a study of the structure of organisms we get a clue to their  relationships, and upon the basis of such relationships are enabled to  classify them or unite them into groups so as to indicate the degree  to which they are related. This constitutes the division of Botany  usually known as Classification or \"Systematic Botany.\"    Finally, we may study the functions or workings of an organism: how it  feeds, breathes, moves, reproduces. This is \"Physiology,\" and like  classification must be preceded by a knowledge of the structures  concerned.    For the study of the gross anatomy of plants the following articles  will be found of great assistance: 1. a sharp knife, and for more  delicate tissues, a razor; 2. a pair of small, fine-pointed scissors;  3. a pair of mounted needles (these can be made by forcing ordinary  sewing needles into handles of pine or other soft wood); 4. a hand  lens; 5. drawing-paper and pencil, and a note book.    For the study of the lower plants, as well as the histology of the  higher ones, a compound microscope is indispensable. Instruments with  lenses magnifying from about 20 to 500 diameters can be had at a cost  varying from about $20 to $30, and are sufficient for any ordinary  investigations.    Objects to be studied with the compound microscope are usually  examined by transmitted light, and must be transparent enough to allow  the light to pass through. The objects are placed upon small glass  slips (slides), manufactured for the purpose, and covered with  extremely thin plates of glass, also specially made. If the body to be  examined is a large one, thin slices or sections must be made. This  for most purposes may be done with an ordinary razor. Most plant  tissues are best examined ordinarily in water, though of course  specimens so mounted cannot be preserved for any length of time.[1]    [1] For the mounting of permanent preparations, see Chapter XIX.    In addition to the implements used in studying the gross anatomy, the  following will be found useful in histological work: 1. a small  camel's-hair brush for picking up small sections and putting water in  the slides; 2. small forceps for handling delicate objects; 3.  blotting paper for removing superfluous water from the slides and  drawing fluids under the cover glass; 4. pieces of elder or sunflower  pith, for holding small objects while making sections.    In addition to these implements, a few reagents may be recommended for  the simpler histological work. The most important of these are  alcohol, glycerine, potash (a strong solution of potassium hydrate in  water), iodine (either a little of the commercial tincture of iodine  in water, or, better, a solution of iodine in iodide of potassium),  acetic acid, and some staining fluid. (An aqueous or alcoholic  solution of gentian violet or methyl violet is one of the best.)    A careful record should be kept by the student of all work done, both  by means of written notes and drawings. For most purposes pencil  drawings are most convenient, and these should be made with a  moderately soft pencil on unruled paper. If it is desired to make the  drawings with ink, a careful outline should first be made with a hard  pencil and this inked over with India-ink or black drawing ink. Ink  drawings are best made upon light bristol board with a hard,  smooth-finished surface.    When obtainable, the student will do best to work with freshly  gathered specimens; but as these are not always to be had when wanted,  a few words about gathering and preserving material may be of service.    Most of the lower green plants (_algae_) may be kept for a long time in  glass jars or other vessels, provided care is taken to remove all  dead specimens at first and to renew the water from time to time. They  usually thrive best in a north window where they get little or no  direct sunshine, and it is well to avoid keeping them too warm.    Numbers of the most valuable fungi--_i.e._ the lower plants that are  not green--grow spontaneously on many organic substances that are kept  warm and moist. Fresh bread kept moist and covered with a glass will  in a short time produce a varied crop of moulds, and fresh horse  manure kept in the same way serves to support a still greater number  of fungi.    Mosses, ferns, etc., can be raised with a little care, and of course  very many flowering plants are readily grown in pots.    Most of the smaller parasitic fungi (rusts, mildews, etc.) may be kept  dry for any length of time, and on moistening with a weak solution of  caustic potash will serve nearly as well as freshly gathered specimens  for most purposes.    When it is desired to preserve as perfectly as possible the more  delicate plant structures for future study, strong alcohol is the best  and most convenient preserving agent. Except for loss of color it  preserves nearly all plant tissues perfectly.          CHAPTER II.    THE CELL.      If we make a thin slice across the stem of a rapidly growing  plant,--_e.g._ geranium, begonia, celery,--mount it in water, and  examine it microscopically, it will be found to be made up of numerous  cavities or chambers separated by delicate partitions. Often these  cavities are of sufficient size to be visible to the naked eye, and  examined with a hand lens the section appears like a piece of fine  lace, each mesh being one of the chambers visible when more strongly  magnified. These chambers are known as \"cells,\" and of them the whole  plant is built up.    [Illustration: FIG. 1.--A single cell from a hair on the stamen of the  common spiderwort (_Tradescantia_), x 150. _pr._ protoplasm; _w_, cell  wall; _n_, nucleus.]      In order to study the structure of the cell more exactly we will    select such as may be examined without cutting them. A good example    is furnished by the common spiderwort (Fig. 1). Attached to the base    of the stamens (Fig. 85, _B_) are delicate hairs composed of chains    of cells, which may be examined alive by carefully removing a stamen    and placing it in a drop of water under a cover glass. Each cell    (Fig. 1) is an oblong sac, with a delicate colorless wall which    chemical tests show to be composed of cellulose, a substance closely    resembling starch. Within this sac, and forming a lining to it, is    a thin layer of colorless matter containing many fine granules.    Bands and threads of the same substance traverse the cavity of the    cell, which is filled with a"]]]
