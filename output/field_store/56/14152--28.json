INFLUENCE OF VENETIAN ART    INDEX TO THE WORKS OF THE PRINCIPAL VENETIAN PAINTERS    INDEX OF PLACES          THE VENETIAN PAINTERS OF THE RENAISSANCE      =I. Value of Venetian Art.=--Among the Italian schools of painting the  Venetian has, for the majority of art-loving people, the strongest and  most enduring attraction. In the course of the present brief account of  the life of that school we shall perhaps discover some of the causes of  our peculiar delight and interest in the Venetian painters, as we come  to realise what tendencies of the human spirit their art embodied, and  of what great consequence their example has been to the whole of  European painting for the last three centuries.    The Venetians as a school were from the first endowed with exquisite  tact in their use of colour. Seldom cold and rarely too warm, their  colouring never seems an afterthought, as in many of the Florentine  painters, nor is it always suggesting paint, as in some of the Veronese  masters. When the eye has grown accustomed to make allowance for the  darkening caused by time, for the dirt that lies in layers on so many  pictures, and for unsuccessful attempts at restoration, the better  Venetian paintings present such harmony of intention and execution as  distinguishes the highest achievements of genuine poets. Their mastery  over colour is the first thing that attracts most people to the painters  of Venice. Their colouring not only gives direct pleasure to the eye,  but acts like music upon the moods, stimulating thought and memory in  much the same way as a work by a great composer.      =II. The Church and Painting.=--The Church from the first took account of  the influence of colour as well as of music upon the emotions. From the  earliest times it employed mosaic and painting to enforce its dogmas and  relate its legends, not merely because this was the only means of  reaching people who could neither read nor write, but also because it  instructed them in a way which, far from leading to critical enquiry,  was peculiarly capable of being used as an indirect stimulus to moods of  devotion and contrition. Next to the finest mosaics of the first  centuries, the early works of Giovanni Bellini, the greatest Venetian  master of the fifteenth century, best fulfil this religious intention.  Painting had in his lifetime reached a point where the difficulties of  technique no longer stood in the way of the expression of profound  emotion. No one can look at Bellini's pictures of the Dead Christ upheld  by the Virgin or angels without being put into a mood of deep  contrition, nor at his earlier Madonnas without a thrill of awe and  reverence. And Giovanni Bellini does not stand alone. His  contemporaries, Gentile Bellini, the Vivarini, Crivelli, and Cima da  Conegliano all began by painting in the same spirit, and produced almost  the same effect.    The Church, however, thus having educated people to understand painting  as a language and to look to it for the expression of their sincerest  feelings, could not hope to keep it always confined to the channel of  religious emotion. People began to feel the need of painting as  something that entered into their every-day lives almost as much as we  nowadays feel the need of the newspaper; nor was this unnatural,  considering that, until the invention of printing, painting was the only  way, apart from direct speech, of conveying ideas to the masses. At  about the time when Bellini and his contemporaries were attaining  maturity, the Renaissance had ceased to be a movement carried on by  scholars and poets alone. It had become sufficiently widespread to seek  popular as well as literary utterance, and thus, toward the end of the  fifteenth century, it naturally turned to painting, a vehicle of  expression which the Church, after a thousand years of use, had made  familiar and beloved.    To understand the Renaissance at the time when its spirit began to find  complete embodiment in painting, a brief survey of the movement of  thought in Italy during its earlier period is necessary, because only  when that movement had reached a certain point did painting come to be  its most natural medium of expression.      =III. The Renaissance.=--The thousand years that elapsed between the  triumph of Christianity and the middle of the fourteenth century have  been not inaptly compared to the first fifteen or sixteen years in the  life of the individual. Whether full of sorrows or joys, of storms or  peace, these early years are chiefly characterised by tutelage and  unconsciousness of personality. But toward the end of the fourteenth  century something happened in Europe that happens in the lives of all  gifted individuals. There was an awakening to the sense of personality.  Although it was felt to a greater or less degree everywhere, Italy felt  the awakening earlier than the rest of Europe, and felt it far more  strongly. Its first manifestation was a boundless and insatiable  curiosity, urging people to find out all they could about the world and  about man. They turned eagerly to the study of classic literature and  ancient monuments, because these gave the key to what seemed an immense  store-house of forgotten knowledge; they were in fact led to antiquity  by the same impulse which, a little later, brought about the invention  of the printing-press and the discovery of America.    The first consequence of a return to classical literature was the  worship of human greatness. Roman literature, which the Italians  naturally mastered much earlier than Greek, dealt chiefly with politics  and war, seeming to give an altogether disproportionate place to the  individual, because it treated only of such individuals as were  concerned in great events. It is but a step from realising the greatness  of an event to believing that the persons concerned in it were equally  great, and this belief, fostered by the somewhat rhetorical literature  of Rome, met the new consciousness of personality more than half way,  and led to that unlimited admiration for human genius and achievement  which was so prominent a feature of the early Renaissance. The two  tendencies reacted upon each other. Roman literature stimulated the  admiration for genius, and this admiration in turn reinforced the  interest in that period of the world's history when genius was supposed  to be the rule rather than the exception; that is to say, it reinforced  the interest in antiquity.    The spirit of discovery, the never satisfied curiosity of this time, led  to the study of ancient art as well as of ancient literature, and the  love of antiquity led to the imitation of its buildings and statues as  well as of its books and poems. Until comparatively recent times  scarcely any ancient paintings were found, although buildings and  statues were everywhere to be seen, the moment anyone seriously thought  of looking at them. The result was that while the architecture and  sculpture of the Renaissance were directly and strongly influenced by  antiquity, painting felt its influence only in so far as the study of  antiquity in the other arts had conduced to better draughtsmanship and  purer taste. The spirit of discovery could thus show itself only  indirectly in painting,--only in so far as it led painters to the  gradual perfection of the technical means of their craft.    Unlimited admiration for genius and wonder that the personalities of  antiquity should have survived with their great names in no way  diminished, soon had two consequences. One was love of glory, and the  other the patronage of those arts which were supposed to hand down a  glorious name undiminished to posterity. The glory of old Rome had come  down through poets and historians, architects and sculptors, and the  Italians, feeling that the same means might be used to hand down the  achievements of their own time to as distant a posterity, made a new  religion of glory, with poets and artists for the priests. At first the  new priesthood was confined almost entirely to writers, but in little  more than a generation architects and sculptors began to have their  part. The passion for building is in itself one of the most instinctive,  and a man's name and armorial bearings, tastefully but prominently  displayed upon a church or palace, were as likely, it was felt, to hand  him down to posterity as the praise of poets or historians. It was the  passion for glory, in reality, rather than any love of beauty, that gave  the first impulse to the patronage of the arts in the Renaissance.  Beauty was the concern of the artists, although no doubt their patrons  were well aware that the more impressive a building was, the more  beautiful a monument, the more likely was it to be admired, and the  more likely were their names to reach posterity. Their instincts did not  mislead them, for where their real achievements would have tempted only  the specialist or antiquarian into a study of their career, the  buildings and monuments put up by them--by such princes as Sigismondo  Malatesta, Frederick of Urbino, or Alfonzo of Naples,--have made the  whole intelligent public believe that they were really as great as they  wished posterity to believe them.    As painting had done nothing whatever to transmit the glory of the great  Romans, the earlier generations of the Renaissance expected nothing from  it, and did not give it that patronage which the Church, for its own  purposes, continued to hold out to it. The Renaissance began to make  especial use of painting only when its own spirit had spread very  widely, and when the love of knowledge, of power, and of glory had  ceased to be the only recognised passions, and when, following the lead  of the Church, people began to turn to painting for the expression of  deep emotion. The new religion, as I"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22131"],[0,"The Story of the Upper Canadian Rebellion, Volume 1 (#2)"],[1," suspecting,  whence the blow proceeded. They were the head and front of the junto of  oligarchs who formed the Vehmgericht known as the Family Compact, and  for all practical purposes their judgment in matters relating to the  dispensing of patronage and the disposal of Crown property was final and  conclusive.    The counsel for the prosecution was a handsome young man of  twenty-eight, who for some years past had been steadily fitting himself  for the important part he was destined to play--that of Mr. Powell's  judicial[1] and political successor in the colony. The time was only ten  years distant when he, in his turn, was to become Chief Justice of Upper  Canada. The time was still less remote when he was to succeed Chief  Justice Powell as Dr. Strachan's most active colleague--as the chief lay  spokesman of his party, and the chief lay adviser of successive  Lieutenant-Governors. His name was John Beverley Robinson, and his  destiny was doubtless sufficiently clear before him on this 20th of  August, 1819. He had strong claims upon his party, for he was the son of  a United Empire Loyalist, and during the late war with the United States  had proved that he was no degenerate scion of the stock whence he had  sprung. He had been present at the surrender of Detroit, and had borne  himself gallantly at the battle of Queenston Heights. Nor had his party  shown any disposition to ignore his claims. On the contrary, they had  pushed him forward with a rapidity which would have turned any head with  a natural tendency to giddiness. He had been appointed Attorney-General  of the Province before he had been called to the bar, and when he was  only twenty-one years of age--a special Act of Parliament being  subsequently passed to confirm the proceeding. In 1815 he had been  appointed Solicitor-General, chiefly in order that he might draw the  salary incidental to that office during a two years' visit to England.  Soon after his return he had again been appointed Attorney-General, and  had early signalized his re-accession to office by his manner of  prosecuting certain criminals from the Red River country, who had been  placed on trial at York. Those proceedings do not fall within the  purview of this work, but it may be said with reference to the young  Attorney-General's connection with them that he had proved himself an  exceedingly narrow partisan and a docile pupil of Dr. Strachan. He now  presented himself to take a leading part in one of the most shameless  and iniquitous prosecutions that ever disgraced a court of justice. His  personal appearance was decidedly prepossessing. His figure, clad in  well-fitting garments of the fashionable cut of the period, was light,  agile and compact, and his face, rather inclining to narrowness, was  surmounted by a high and smoothly-finished brow, beneath which looked  out a pair of steel-grey eyes, the usual expression of which was eager  and firm, but on the whole not unkindly. His mouth was finely formed,  and when he was in a pleasant humour--as indeed he not infrequently  was--his smile was sweet and ingratiating. In intellectual capacity he  was considerably in advance of most of his professional brethren of that  day, and he had cultivated his natural abilities by constant  watchfulness and study. His features, one and all, were well and sharply  defined, and he was probably the handsomest man at the Provincial bar.    Several other members of the legal profession, all of them more or less  widely known in the forensic, judicial or political annals of the  Province, were present. Conspicuous among them was the brilliant but  unscrupulous Christoper Alexander Hagerman, who had already taken high  rank at the bar, and was destined to be one of the most active and  intolerant directors of the oligarchical policy. Archibald McLean, tall  and lithe of limb, had then been more than four years at the bar, and he  had already given evidence of the high abilities which were to gain for  him an honoured seat upon the judicial bench. He had been retained to  defend two prisoners at the Niagara assizes, and his presence in the  court-room was due to this fact. Another figure at the barristers' table  was Samuel Peters Jarvis, his hands yet red with the blood of young John  Ridout, ruthlessly shed by him in a duel two years before, and never to  be effaced from the tablets of his memory. There, too, sat Henry John  Boulton, a young man of much pretension but mediocre intellect, who had  been appointed acting Solicitor-General during the previous year, and  who united in his own person all the bigotry and narrow selfishness of  the faction to which he belonged. He, also, had been concerned in the  shedding of young Ridout's blood, having acted as second to the  surviving principal in that affair. With this exception his past life  had been uneventful, but his future was fated to be marked by  considerable variety of incident, and by actions which even the most  favourable judgment cannot regard with unmixed complacency.    The twelve jurymen sat in their places, in the jury-box to the left of  the judge. The witnesses summoned on behalf of the Crown were the  Honourable William Dickson and the Honourable William Claus, both of  whom were members of the Legislative Council of Upper Canada. The former  gentleman was an enterprising Scotchman who had settled in Niagara while  it was yet known as Newark, where he had first kept a general store, and  afterwards practised law and speculation with great pecuniary success.  Like the Jarvis above mentioned, he was disfigured by a red right hand,  having shot his man in a duel fought in the autumn of 1808 behind the  United States fort on the opposite bank of the river. It is fair to Mr.  Dickson, however, to say that he was the challenged party, and that the  duel was in a measure forced upon him by the barbarous usages of society  in those (happily) far-off days. The other witness, Mr. Claus, was at  the head of the Indian department at Niagara, the abuses in the  administration whereof were notorious. It was well understood throughout  the district that Dickson and Claus between them had contrived to make a  tolerably good thing out of the Indians, and that they had been  concerned in some decidedly shady transactions. If it be true that  Heaven helps those who help themselves, certainly both those gentlemen  were entitled to look for divine assistance. They possessed and  exercised a wide influence throughout the settlements in the Niagara  peninsula, as well as at the Provincial capital, and were commonly  regarded as being on the high road to great wealth. Two years before the  date of the trial forming the subject of the present chapter, Dickson  had purchased the whole of the splendid township of Dumfries, comprising  94,305 acres, at a trifle over a dollar an acre; and he had already  begun to realize upon his investment. Claus and he occupied seats at the  barristers' table, in close proximity to the Attorney-General. The  spectators included pretty nearly every prominent resident of the town  of Niagara and its immediate neighbourhood.    But the most conspicuous figure in that crowded court-room yet remains  to be considered. It has been mentioned that the prisoners' dock was  large enough to hold five or six persons. On this occasion it held but  a single, solitary prisoner. A man large and bony, who, when in his  ordinary state of health, must have weighed not less than fifteen stone.  Just at present he was very far from being in ordinary health, for  during the preceding twelvemonth he had undergone sufficient worry and  suffering to destroy the life of any man of average vitality. After  having successfully defended himself through two criminal trials, he had  been cast into prison, where he had languished for more than seven  months. During his long confinement he had been subjected to a course of  treatment which would have been highly culpable if meted out to a  convicted criminal, and which was marked by a malignant cruelty hardly  to be comprehended when the nature of the offence charged against him is  considered. His own account of the matter is a plain and simple  narration of facts, the truth whereof rests upon the clearest and most  indisputable evidence. \"After two months' close confinement,\" he writes,  \"in one of the cells of the jail, my health had begun to suffer, and, on  complaint of this, the liberty of walking through the passages and  sitting at the door was granted. This liberty prevented my getting worse  the four succeeding months, although I never enjoyed a day's health, but  by the power of medicine. At the end of this period I was again locked  up in the cell, cut off from all conversation with my friends, but  through a hole in the door, while the jailor or under-sheriff watched  what was said, and for some time both my attorney and magistrates of my  acquaintance were denied admission to me. The quarter sessions were held  soon after this severe and unconstitutional treatment commenced, and on  these occasions it was the custom and duty of the grand jury to  perambulate the jail, and see that all was right with the prisoners. I  prepared a memorial for their consideration, but on this occasion was  not visited. I complained to a magistrate through the door, who promised  to mention my case to the chairman of the sessions, but the chairman  happened to be brother of one of those who had signed my commitment, and  the court broke up without my obtaining the smallest relief.  Exasperation of mind, now joined to the heat of the weather, which was  excessive, rapidly wasted my health and impaired my faculties. I felt my  memory sensibly affected, and could not connect my ideas through any  length of reasoning, but by writing, which many days I was wholly  unfitted for by the violence of continual headache.\"    There is a pathos about this plain, unvarnished story that appeals to  every heart."]]]
