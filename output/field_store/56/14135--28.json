O Ralph, Ralph, I had entertained too good  an opinion of you.\"    \"But tell me about Jack,\" said I, impatient to hear more concerning my  dear old comrade.    \"Not just now, my boy; more of him in a few minutes.  First let us  return to the point.  What was it?  Oh! a--about my being a celebrated  hunter.  A very Nimrod--at least a miniature copy.  Well, Ralph, since  we last met I have been all over the world, right round and round it.  I'm a lieutenant in the navy now--at least I was a week ago.  I've been  fighting with the Kaffirs and the Chinamen, and been punishing the  rascally sepoys in India, and been hunting elephants in Ceylon and  tiger-shooting in the jungles, and harpooning whales in the polar seas,  and shooting lions at the Cape; oh, you've no notion where all I've  been.  It's a perfect marvel I've turned up here alive.  But there's one  beast I've not yet seen, and I'm resolved to see him and shoot him  too--\"    \"But,\" said I, interrupting, \"what mean you by saying that you were a  lieutenant in the navy a week ago?\"    \"I mean that I've given it up.  I'm tired of the sea.  I only value it  as a means of getting from one country to another.  The land, the land  for me!  You must know that an old uncle, a rich old uncle of mine, whom  I never saw, died lately and left me his whole fortune.  Of course he  died in India.  All old uncles who die suddenly and leave unexpected  fortunes to unsuspecting nephews are old Indian uncles, and mine was no  exception to the general rule.  So I'm independent, like you, Ralph,  only I've got three or four thousand a year instead of hundreds, I  believe; but I'm not sure and don't care--and I'm determined now to go  on a long hunting expedition.  What think ye of all that, my boy?\"    \"In truth,\" said I, \"it would puzzle me to say what I think, I am so  filled with surprise by all you tell me.  But you forget that you have  not yet told me to which part of the world you mean to go, and what sort  of beast it is you are so determined to see and shoot if you can.\"    \"If I can!\" echoed Peterkin, with a contemptuous curl of the lip.  \"Did  not I tell you that I was a _celebrated_ hunter?  Without meaning to  boast, I may tell you that there is no peradventure in my shooting.  If  I only get there and see the brute within long range, I'll--ha! won't  I!\"    \"Get _where_, and see _what_?\"    \"Get to Africa and see the gorilla!\" cried Peterkin, while a glow of  enthusiasm lighted up his eyes.  \"You've heard of the gorilla, Ralph, of  course--the great ape--the enormous puggy--the huge baboon--the man  monkey, that we've been hearing so much of for some years back, and that  the niggers on the African coast used to dilate about till they caused  the very hair of my head to stand upon end?  I'm determined to shoot a  gorilla, or prove him to be a myth.  And I mean you to come and help me,  Ralph; he's quite in your way.  A bit of natural history, I suppose,  although he seems by all accounts to be a very unnatural monster.  And  Jack shall go too--I'm resolved on that; and we three shall roam the  wild woods again, as we did in days of yore, and--\"    \"Hold, Peterkin,\" said I, interrupting.  \"How do you know that Jack will  go?\"    \"How do I know?  Intuitively, of course.  I shall write to him to-night;  the post does not leave till ten.  He'll get it to-morrow at breakfast,  and will catch the forenoon coach, which will bring him down here by two  o'clock, and then we'll begin our preparations at once, and talk the  matter over at dinner.  So you see it's all cut and dry.  Give me a  sheet of paper and I'll write at once.  Ah! here's a bit; now a pen.  Bless me, Ralph, haven't you got a quill?  Who ever heard of a  philosophical naturalist writing with steel.  Now, then, here  goes:--`B'luv'd Jack,'--will that do to begin with, eh?  I'm afraid it's  too affectionate; he'll think it's from a lady friend.  But it can't be  altered,--`Here I am, and here's Ralph--Ralph Rover!!!!!! think of  that,' (I say, Ralph, I've put six marks of admiration there); `I've  found him out.  Do come to see us.  Excruciatingly important business.  Ever thine--Peterkin Gay.'  Will that bring him, d'ye think?\"    \"I think it will,\" said I, laughing.    \"Then off with it, Ralph,\" cried my volatile friend, jumping up and  looking hastily round for the bell-rope.  Not being able to find it, my  bell-pull being an unobtrusive knob and not a rope, he rushed to the  door, unlocked it, darted out, and uttered a tremendous roar, which was  followed by a clatter and a scream from old Agnes, whom he had upset and  tumbled over.    It was curious to note the sudden change that took place in Peterkin's  face, voice, and manner, as he lifted the poor old woman, who was very  thin and light, in his arms, and carrying her into the room, placed her  in my easy-chair.  Real anxiety was depicted in his countenance, and he  set her down with a degree of care and tenderness that quite amazed me.  I was myself very much alarmed at first.    \"My poor dear old _woman_,\" said Peterkin, supporting my landlady's  head; \"my stupid haste I fear you are hurt.\"    \"Hech! it's nae hurt--it's deed I am, fair deed; killed be a  whaumlskamerin' young blagyird.  Oh, ma puir heed!\"    The manner and tone in which this was said convinced me that old Agnes  was more frightened than injured.  In a few minutes the soothing tones  and kind manner of my friend had such an effect upon her that she  declared she was better, and believed after all that she was only a \"wee  bit frichtened.\"  Nay, so completely was she conciliated, that she  insisted on conveying the note to the post-office, despite Peterkin's  assurance that he would not hear of it.  Finally she hobbled out of the  room with the letter in her hand.    It is interesting to note how that, in most of the affairs of humanity,  things turn out very different, often totally different, from what we  had expected or imagined.  During the remainder of that evening Peterkin  and I talked frequently and much of our old friend Jack Martin.  We  recalled his manly yet youthful countenance, his bold, lion-like  courage, his broad shoulders and winning gentle smile, and although we  knew that six years must have made an immense difference in his personal  appearance--for he was not much more than eighteen when we last parted--  we could not think of him except as a hearty, strapping sailor-boy.  We  planned, too, how we would meet him at the coach; how we would stand  aside in the crowd until he began to look about for us in surprise, and  then one of us would step forward and ask if he wished to be directed to  any particular part of the town, and so lead him on and talk to him as a  stranger for some time before revealing who we were.  And much more to  the same effect.  But when next day came our plans and our conceptions  were utterly upset.    A little before two we sauntered down to the coach-office, and waited  impatiently for nearly twenty minutes.  Of course the coach was late; it  always is on such occasions.    \"Suppose he does not come,\" said I.    \"What a fellow you are,\" cried Peterkin, \"to make uncomfortable  suppositions!  Let us rather suppose that he does come.\"    \"Oh, then, it would be all right; but if he does not come, what then?\"    \"Why, then, it would be all wrong, and we should have to return home and  eat our dinner in the sulks, that's all.\"    As my companion spoke we observed the coach come sweeping round the turn  of the road about half a mile distant.  In a few seconds it dashed into  the town at full gallop, and finally drew up abruptly opposite the door  of the inn, where were assembled the usual group of hostlers and waiters  and people who expected friends by the coach.    \"He's not there,\" whispered Peterkin, in deep disappointment--\"at least  he's not on the outside, and Jack would never travel inside of a coach  even in bad weather, much less in fine.  That's not him on the back-seat  beside the fat old woman with the blue bundle, surely!  It's very like  him, but too young, much too young.  There's a great giant of a man on  the box-seat with a beard like a grenadier's shako, and a stout old  gentleman behind him with gold spectacles.  That's all, except two boys  farther aft, and three ladies in the cabin.  Oh, _what_ a bore!\"    Although deeply disappointed at the non-arrival of Jack, I could with  difficulty refrain from smiling at the rueful and woe-begone countenance  of my poor companion.  It was evident that he could not bear  disappointment with equanimity, and I was on the point of offering some  consolatory remarks, when my attention was attracted by the little old  woman with the blue bundle, who went up to the gigantic man with the  black beard, and in the gentlest possible tone of voice asked if he  could direct her to the white house.    \"No, madam,\" replied the big man hastily; \"I'm a stranger here.\"    The little old woman was startled by his abrupt answer.  \"Deary me, sir,  no offence, I hope.\"    She then turned to Peterkin and put the same question, possibly under a  vague sort of impression that if a gigantic frame betokened a gruff  nature, diminutive stature must necessarily imply extreme amiability.  If so, she must have been much surprised as well as disappointed, for  Peterkin, rendered irascible by disappointment, turned short round and  said sharply, \"Why, madam, how can _I_ tell you where the white house  is, unless you say which white house you want?  Half the houses of the  town are white--at least they're _dirty_ white,\" he added bitterly, as  he turned away.    \"I think I can direct you, ma'am,\" said I, stepping quickly up with a  bland smile, in order to counteract, if possible, my companion's  rudeness.    \"Thank you, sir, kindly,\" said the little old woman; \"I'm glad to find  _some_ little civility in the town.\"    \"Come with me, ma'am; I am"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2176"],[0,"Seven Discourses on Art (#2)"],[1,"ideal excellence which  it is the lot of genius always to contemplate and never to attain.    The principal advantage of an academy is, that, besides furnishing able  men to direct the student, it will be a repository for the great examples  of the art.  These are the materials on which genius is to work, and  without which the strongest intellect may be fruitlessly or deviously  employed.  By studying these authentic models, that idea of excellence  which is the result of the accumulated experience of past ages may be at  once acquired, and the tardy and obstructed progress of our predecessors  may teach us a shorter and easier way.  The student receives at one  glance the principles which many artists have spent their whole lives in  ascertaining; and, satisfied with their effect, is spared the painful  investigation by which they come to be known and fixed.  How many men of  great natural abilities have been lost to this nation for want of these  advantages?  They never had an opportunity of seeing those masterly  efforts of genius which at once kindle the whole soul, and force it into  sudden and irresistible approbation.    Raffaelle, it is true, had not the advantage of studying in an academy;  but all Rome, and the works of Michael Angelo in particular, were to him  an academy.  On the site of the Capel la Sistina he immediately from a  dry, Gothic, and even insipid manner, which attends to the minute  accidental discriminations of particular and individual objects, assumed  that grand style of painting, which improves partial representation by  the general and invariable ideas of nature.    Every seminary of learning may be said to be surrounded with an  atmosphere of floating knowledge, where every mind may imbibe somewhat  congenial to its own original conceptions.  Knowledge, thus obtained, has  always something more popular and useful than that which is forced upon  the mind by private precepts or solitary meditation.  Besides, it is  generally found that a youth more easily receives instruction from the  companions of his studies, whose minds are nearly on a level with his  own, than from those who are much his superiors; and it is from his  equals only that he catches the fire of emulation.    One advantage, I will venture to affirm, we shall have in our academy,  which no other nation can boast.  We shall have nothing to unlearn.  To  this praise the present race of artists have a just claim.  As far as  they have yet proceeded they are right.  With us the exertions of genius  will henceforward be directed to their proper objects.  It will not be as  it has been in other schools, where he that travelled fastest only  wandered farthest from the right way.    Impressed as I am, therefore, with such a favourable opinion of my  associates in this undertaking, it would ill become me to dictate to any  of them.  But as these institutions have so often failed in other  nations, and as it is natural to think with regret how much might have  been done, and how little has been done, I must take leave to offer a few  hints, by which those errors may be rectified, and those defects  supplied.  These the professors and visitors may reject or adopt as they  shall think proper.    I would chiefly recommend that an implicit obedience to the rules of art,  as established by the great masters, should be exacted from the _young_  students.  That those models, which have passed through the approbation  of ages, should be considered by them as perfect and infallible guides as  subjects for their imitation, not their criticism.    I am confident that this is the only efficacious method of making a  progress in the arts; and that he who sets out with doubting will find  life finished before he becomes master of the rudiments.  For it may be  laid down as a maxim, that he who begins by presuming on his own sense  has ended his studies as soon as he has commenced them.  Every  opportunity, therefore, should be taken to discountenance that false and  vulgar opinion that rules are the fetters of genius.  They are fetters  only to men of no genius; as that armour, which upon the strong becomes  an ornament and a defence, upon the weak and misshapen turns into a load,  and cripples the body which it was made to protect.    How much liberty may be taken to break through those rules, and, as the  poet expresses it,       \"To snatch a grace beyond the reach of art,\"    may be an after consideration, when the pupils become masters themselves.  It is then, when their genius has received its utmost improvement, that  rules may possibly be dispensed with.  But let us not destroy the  scaffold until we have raised the building.    The directors ought more particularly to watch over the genius of those  students who, being more advanced, are arrived at that critical period of  study, on the nice management of which their future turn of taste  depends.  At that age it is natural for them to be more captivated with  what is brilliant than with what is solid, and to prefer splendid  negligence to painful and humiliating exactness.    A facility in composing, a lively, and what is called a masterly handling  the chalk or pencil, are, it must be confessed, captivating qualities to  young minds, and become of course the objects of their ambition.  They  endeavour to imitate those dazzling excellences, which they will find no  great labour in attaining.  After much time spent in these frivolous  pursuits, the difficulty will be to retreat; but it will be then too  late; and there is scarce an instance of return to scrupulous labour  after the mind has been debauched and deceived by this fallacious  mastery.    By this useless industry they are excluded from all power of advancing in  real excellence.  Whilst boys, they are arrived at their utmost  perfection; they have taken the shadow for the substance; and make that  mechanical facility the chief excellence of the art, which is only an  ornament, and of the merit of which few but painters themselves are  judges.    This seems to me to be one of the most dangerous sources of corruption;  and I speak of it from experience, not as an error which may possibly  happen, but which has actually infected all foreign academies.  The  directors were probably pleased with this premature dexterity in their  pupils, and praised their despatch at the expense of their correctness.    But young men have not only this frivolous ambition of being thought  masterly inciting them on one hand, but also their natural sloth tempting  them on the other.  They are terrified at the prospect before them, of  the toil required to attain exactness.  The impetuosity of youth is  distrusted at the slow approaches of a regular siege, and desires, from  mere impatience of labour, to take the citadel by storm.  They wish to  find some shorter path to excellence, and hope to obtain the reward of  eminence by other means than those which the indispensable rules of art  have prescribed.  They must, therefore, be told again and again that  labour is the only price of solid fame, and that whatever their force of  genius may be, there is no easy method of becoming a good painter.    When we read the lives of the most eminent painters, every page informs  us that no part of their time was spent in dissipation.  Even an increase  of fame served only to augment their industry.  To be convinced with what  persevering assiduity they pursued their studies, we need only reflect on  their method of proceeding in their most celebrated works.  When they  conceived a subject, they first made a variety of sketches; then a  finished drawing of the whole; after that a more correct drawing of every  separate part, heads, hands, feet, and pieces of drapery; they then  painted the picture, and after all re-touched it from the life.  The  pictures, thus wrought with such pain, now appear like the effect of  enchantment, and as if some mighty genius had struck them off at a blow.    But, whilst diligence is thus recommended to the students, the visitors  will take care that their diligence be effectual; that it be well  directed and employed on the proper object.  A student is not always  advancing because he is employed; he must apply his strength to that part  of the art where the real difficulties lie; to that part which  distinguishes it as a liberal art, and not by mistaken industry lose his  time in that which is merely ornamental.  The students, instead of vying  with each other which shall have the readiest band, should be taught to  contend who shall have the purest and most correct outline, instead of  striving which shall produce the brightest tint, or, curiously trifling  endeavour to give the gloss of stuffs so as to appear real, let their  ambition be directed to contend which shall dispose his drapery in the  most graceful folds, which shall give the most grace and dignity to the  human figure.    I must beg leave to submit one thing more to the consideration of the  visitors, which appears to me a matter of very great consequence, and the  omission of which I think a principal defect in the method of education  pursued in all the academies I have ever visited.  The error I mean is,  that the students never draw exactly from the living models which they  have before them.  It is not indeed their intention, nor are they  directed to do it.  Their drawings resemble the model only in the  attitude.  They change the form according to their vague and uncertain  ideas of beauty, and make a drawing rather of what they think the figure  ought to be than of what it appears.  I have thought this the obstacle  that has stopped the progress of many young men of real genius; and I  very much doubt whether a habit of drawing correctly what we see will not  give a proportionable power of drawing correctly what we imagine.  He who  endeavours to copy nicely the figure before him not only acquires a habit  of exactness and precision, but is"]]]
