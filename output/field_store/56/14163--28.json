Nobly, my lord:  as out of the Grecian horse issued many    famous princes, so out of brave horsemanship arise the first sparks    of growing resolution, that raise the mind to noble action.      FERDINAND.  You have bespoke it worthily.      SILVIO.  Your brother, the lord cardinal, and sister duchess.           [Enter CARDINAL, with DUCHESS, and CARIOLA]      CARDINAL.  Are the galleys come about?      GRISOLAN.                               They are, my lord.      FERDINAND.  Here 's the Lord Silvio is come to take his leave.      DELIO.  Now, sir, your promise:  what 's that cardinal?    I mean his temper?  They say he 's a brave fellow,    Will play his five thousand crowns at tennis, dance,    Court ladies, and one that hath fought single combats.      ANTONIO.  Some such flashes superficially hang on him for form;    but observe his inward character:  he is a melancholy churchman.    The spring in his face is nothing but the engend'ring of toads;    where he is jealous of any man, he lays worse plots for them than    ever was impos'd on Hercules, for he strews in his way flatterers,    panders, intelligencers, atheists, and a thousand such political    monsters.  He should have been Pope; but instead of coming to it    by the primitive decency of the church, he did bestow bribes    so largely and so impudently as if he would have carried it away    without heaven's knowledge.  Some good he hath done----      DELIO.  You have given too much of him.  What 's his brother?      ANTONIO.  The duke there?  A most perverse and turbulent nature.    What appears in him mirth is merely outside;    If he laught heartily, it is to laugh    All honesty out of fashion.      DELIO.                       Twins?      ANTONIO.                             In quality.    He speaks with others' tongues, and hears men's suits    With others' ears; will seem to sleep o' the bench    Only to entrap offenders in their answers;    Dooms men to death by information;    Rewards by hearsay.      DELIO.              Then the law to him    Is like a foul, black cobweb to a spider,--    He makes it his dwelling and a prison    To entangle those shall feed him.      ANTONIO.                           Most true:    He never pays debts unless they be shrewd turns,    And those he will confess that he doth owe.    Last, for this brother there, the cardinal,    They that do flatter him most say oracles    Hang at his lips; and verily I believe them,    For the devil speaks in them.    But for their sister, the right noble duchess,    You never fix'd your eye on three fair medals    Cast in one figure, of so different temper.    For her discourse, it is so full of rapture,    You only will begin then to be sorry    When she doth end her speech, and wish, in wonder,    She held it less vain-glory to talk much,    Than your penance to hear her.  Whilst she speaks,    She throws upon a man so sweet a look    That it were able to raise one to a galliard.[10]    That lay in a dead palsy, and to dote    On that sweet countenance; but in that look    There speaketh so divine a continence    As cuts off all lascivious and vain hope.    Her days are practis'd in such noble virtue,    That sure her nights, nay, more, her very sleeps,    Are more in heaven than other ladies' shrifts.    Let all sweet ladies break their flatt'ring glasses,    And dress themselves in her.      DELIO.                        Fie, Antonio,    You play the wire-drawer with her commendations.      ANTONIO.  I 'll case the picture up:  only thus much;    All her particular worth grows to this sum,--    She stains[11] the time past, lights the time to come.      CARIOLA.  You must attend my lady in the gallery,    Some half and hour hence.      ANTONIO.                   I shall.         [Exeunt ANTONIO and DELIO.]      FERDINAND.  Sister, I have a suit to you.      DUCHESS.                                   To me, sir?      FERDINAND.  A gentleman here, Daniel de Bosola,    One that was in the galleys----      DUCHESS.                       Yes, I know him.      FERDINAND.  A worthy fellow he is:  pray, let me entreat for    The provisorship of your horse.      DUCHESS.                         Your knowledge of him    Commends him and prefers him.      FERDINAND.                     Call him hither.         [Exit Attendant.]    We [are] now upon[12] parting.  Good Lord Silvio,    Do us commend to all our noble friends    At the leaguer.      SILVIO.          Sir, I shall.      [DUCHESS.]                      You are for Milan?      SILVIO.  I am.      DUCHESS.        Bring the caroches.[13]--We 'll bring you down    To the haven.         [Exeunt DUCHESS, SILVIO, CASTRUCCIO, RODERIGO, GRISOLAN,         CARIOLA, JULIA, and Attendants.]      CARDINAL.      Be sure you entertain that Bosola    For your intelligence.[14]  I would not be seen in 't;    And therefore many times I have slighted him    When he did court our furtherance, as this morning.      FERDINAND.  Antonio, the great-master of her household,    Had been far fitter.      CARDINAL.             You are deceiv'd in him.    His nature is too honest for such business.--    He comes:  I 'll leave you.         [Exit.]           [Re-enter BOSOLA]      BOSOLA.                      I was lur'd to you.      FERDINAND.  My brother, here, the cardinal, could never    Abide you.      BOSOLA.     Never since he was in my debt.      FERDINAND.  May be some oblique character in your face    Made him suspect you.      BOSOLA.                Doth he study physiognomy?    There 's no more credit to be given to the face    Than to a sick man's urine, which some call    The physician's whore, because she cozens[15] him.    He did suspect me wrongfully.      FERDINAND.                     For that    You must give great men leave to take their times.    Distrust doth cause us seldom be deceiv'd.    You see the oft shaking of the cedar-tree    Fastens it more at root.      BOSOLA.                   Yet take heed;    For to suspect a friend unworthily    Instructs him the next way to suspect you,    And prompts him to deceive you.      FERDINAND.                       There 's gold.      BOSOLA.                                          So:    What follows?  [Aside.] Never rain'd such showers as these    Without thunderbolts i' the tail of them.--Whose throat must I cut?      FERDINAND.  Your inclination to shed blood rides post    Before my occasion to use you.  I give you that    To live i' the court here, and observe the duchess;    To note all the particulars of her haviour,    What suitors do solicit her for marriage,    And whom she best affects.  She 's a young widow:    I would not have her marry again.      BOSOLA.                            No, sir?      FERDINAND.  Do not you ask the reason; but be satisfied.    I say I would not.      BOSOLA.             It seems you would create me    One of your familiars.      FERDINAND.              Familiar!  What 's that?      BOSOLA.  Why, a very quaint invisible devil in flesh,--    An intelligencer.[16]      FERDINAND.          Such a kind of thriving thing    I would wish thee; and ere long thou mayst arrive    At a higher place by 't.      BOSOLA.                   Take your devils,    Which hell calls angels!  These curs'd gifts would make    You a corrupter, me an impudent traitor;    And should I take these, they'd take me [to] hell.      FERDINAND.  Sir, I 'll take nothing from you that I have given.    There is a place that I procur'd for you    This morning, the provisorship o' the horse;    Have you heard on 't?      BOSOLA.                No.      FERDINAND.                  'Tis yours:  is 't not worth thanks?      BOSOLA.  I would have you curse yourself now, that your bounty    (Which makes men truly noble) e'er should make me    A villain.  O, that to avoid ingratitude    For the good deed you have done me, I must do    All the ill man can invent!  Thus the devil    Candies all sins o'er; and what heaven terms vile,    That names he complimental.      FERDINAND.                   Be yourself;    Keep your old garb of melancholy; 'twill express    You envy those that stand above your reach,    Yet strive not to come near 'em.  This will gain    Access to private lodgings, where yourself    May, like a politic dormouse----      BOSOLA.                         As I have seen some    Feed in a lord's dish, half asleep, not seeming    To listen to any talk; and yet these rogues    Have cut his throat in a dream.  What 's my place?    The provisorship o' the horse?  Say, then, my corruption    Grew out of horse-dung:  I am your creature.      FERDINAND.                                    Away!         [Exit.]      BOSOLA.  Let good men, for good deeds, covet good fame,    Since place and riches oft are bribes of shame.    Sometimes the devil doth preach.         [Exit.]             [Scene III][17]           [Enter FERDINAND, DUCHESS, CARDINAL, and CARIOLA]      CARDINAL.  We are to part from you; and your own discretion    Must now be your director.      FERDINAND.                  You are a widow:    You know already what man is; and therefore    Let not youth, high promotion, eloquence----      CARDINAL.  No,    Nor anything without the addition, honour,    Sway your high blood.      FERDINAND.             Marry! they are most luxurious[18]    Will wed twice.      CARDINAL.        O, fie!      FERDINAND.                Their livers are more spotted    Than Laban's sheep.[19]      DUCHESS.              Diamonds are of most value,    They say, that have pass'd through most jewellers' hands.      FERDINAND.  Whores by that rule are precious.      DUCHESS.                                       Will you hear me?    I 'll never marry.      CARDINAL.           So most widows say;    But commonly that motion lasts no longer    Than the turning of an hour-glass:  the funeral sermon    And it end both together.      FERDINAND.                 Now hear me:    You live "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22323"],[0,"Impressions of South Africa (#2)"],[1,"of the electoral areas. A  Redistribution Bill was passed by a species of compromise, and in the  elections to the new constituencies which followed the Dutch party  slightly increased its majority, and kept its Cabinet (in which,  however, men of Dutch blood are a minority) in power. Party feeling,  both inside and outside the legislature, became, and has remained,  extremely strong on both sides. The English generally have rallied to  and acclaim Mr. Rhodes, whose connection with Dr. Jameson's expedition  has made him the special object of Dutch hostility. There is, according  to the reports which reach England, no longer any moderating third  party: all are violent partisans. Nevertheless--and this is a remarkable  and most encouraging fact--this violence did not diminish the warmth  with which the whole Assembly testified its loyalty and affection  towards the Queen on the occasion of the completion of the sixtieth year  of her reign in 1897. And the Bond Ministry of Mr. Schreiner proposed  and carried by a unanimous vote a grant of L30,000 per annum as a  contribution by the Colony to the naval defence of the Empire, leaving  the application of this sum to the unfettered discretion of the British  Admiralty.    In the Orange Free State the explosion of Dutch sentiment was still  stronger. Its first result was seen in the election of a President. In  November, 1895, two candidates for the vacant office had come forward,  and their chances were deemed to be nearly equal. When the news of the  Jameson expedition was received, the chance of the candidate of British  stock vanished. Since then, though there was not (so far as I gather)  down till the last few weeks any indication of hostility to Britain,  much less any social friction within the State, a disposition to draw  closer to the threatened sister Republic showed itself at once. This  led to the conclusion of a defensive alliance between the Free State and  the Transvaal, whereby either bound itself to defend the other, if  unjustly attacked. (The Transvaal is believed to have suggested, and the  Free State to have refused, a still closer union.) As the Orange Free  State had no reason to fear an attack, just or unjust, from any quarter,  this was a voluntary undertaking on its part, with no corresponding  advantage, of what might prove a dangerous liability, and it furnishes a  signal proof of the love of independence which animates this little  community.    We come now to the Transvaal itself. In that State the burgher party of  constitutional reform was at once silenced, and its prospect of  usefulness blighted. So, too, the Uitlander agitation was extinguished.  The Reform leaders were in prison or in exile. The passionate  anti-English feeling, and the dogged refusal to consider reforms, which  had characterized the extreme party among the Boers, were intensified.  The influence of President Kruger, more than once threatened in the  years immediately preceding, was immensely strengthened.    The President and his advisers had a golden opportunity before them of  using the credit and power which the failure of the Rising and the  Expedition of 1895 had given them. They ought to have seen that  magnanimity would also be wisdom. They ought to have set about a reform  of the administration and to have proposed a moderate enlargement of the  franchise such as would have admitted enough of the new settlers to give  them a voice, yet not enough to involve any sudden transfer of  legislative or executive power. Whether the sentiment of the Boers  generally would have enabled the President to extend the franchise may  be doubtful; but he could at any rate have tried to deal with the more  flagrant abuses of administration. However, he attempted neither. The  abuses remained, and though a Commission reported on some of them, and  suggested important reforms, no action was taken. The weak point of the  Constitution (as to which see p. 152) was the power which the  legislature apparently possessed of interfering with vested rights, and  even with pending suits, by a resolution having the force of law. This  was a defect due, not to any desire to do wrong, but to the inexperience  of those who had originally framed the Constitution, and to the want of  legal knowledge and skill among those who had worked it, and was  aggravated by the fact that the legislature consisted of one Chamber  only, which was naturally led to legislate by way of resolution  (besluit) because the process of passing laws in the stricter sense of  the term involved a tedious and cumbrous process of bringing them to the  knowledge of the people throughout the country. Upon this point there  arose a dispute with the Chief Justice which led to the dismissal of  that official and one of his colleagues, a dispute which could not be  explained here without entering upon technical details. There is no  reason to think that the President's action was prompted by any wish to  give the legislature the means of wronging individuals, nor has evidence  been produced to show that its powers have been in fact (at least to any  material extent) so used. The matter cannot be fairly judged without  considering the peculiar character of the Transvaal Constitution, for  which the President is nowise to blame, and the statements often made in  this country that the subjection of the judiciary to the legislature  destroys the security of property are much exaggerated, for property has  been, in fact, secure. It was, nevertheless, an error not to try to  retain a man so much respected as the Chief Justice, and not to fulfil  the promise given to Sir Henry de Villiers (who had been invoked as  mediator) that the judiciary should be placed in a more assured  position.    The idea which seems to have filled the President's mind was that force  was the only remedy. The Republic was, he thought, sure to be again  attacked from within or from without; and the essential thing was to  strengthen its military resources for defence, while retaining political  power in the hands of the burghers. Accordingly, the fortifications  already begun at Pretoria were pushed on, a strong fort was erected to  command Johannesburg, and munitions of war were imported in very large  quantities, while the Uitlanders were debarred from possessing arms.  Such precautions were natural. Any government which had been nearly  overthrown, and expected another attack, would have done the like. But  these measures of course incensed the Uitlanders, who saw that another  insurrection would have less chance of success than the last, and  resented the inferiority implied in disarmament, as Israel resented the  similar policy pursued by the Philistine princes. The capitalists also,  an important factor by their wealth and by their power of influencing  opinion in Europe, were angry and restless, because the prospect of  securing reforms which would reduce the cost of working the gold reefs  became more remote.    This was the condition of things in the two Republics and the British  Colonies when the diplomatic controversy between the Imperial Government  and the South African Republic, which had been going on ever since 1895,  passed in the early summer of 1899 into a more acute phase. The  beginning of that phase coincided, as it so happened, with the expiry of  the period during which the leaders of the Johannesburg rising of 1895  had promised to abstain from interference in politics, and the incident  out of which it grew was the presentation to the Queen (in March 1899),  through the High Commissioner, of a petition from a large number of  British residents on the Witwatersrand complaining of the position in  which they found themselves. The situation soon became one of great  tension, owing to the growing passion of the English in South Africa and  the growing suspicion on the part of the Transvaal Boers. But before we  speak of the negotiations, let us consider for a moment what was the  position of the two parties to the controversy.    The position of the Transvaal Government, although (as will presently  appear) it had some measure of legal strength, was, if regarded from the  point of view of actual facts, logically indefensible and materially  dangerous. It was not, indeed, the fault of that Government that the  richest goldfield in the world had been discovered in its territory, nor  would it have been possible for the Boers, whatever they might have  wished, to prevent the mines from being worked and the miners from  streaming in. But the course they took was condemned from the first to  failure. They desired to have the benefit of the gold-mines while yet  retaining their old ways of life, not seeing that the two things were  incompatible. Moreover, they--or rather the President and his  advisers--committed the fatal mistake of trying to maintain a government  which was at the same time undemocratic and incompetent. If it had been  representative of the whole mass of the inhabitants it might have  ventured, like the governments of some great American cities, to  disregard both purity and efficiency. If, on the other hand, it had been  a vigorous and skilful government, giving to the inhabitants the  comforts and conveniences of municipal and industrial life at a  reasonable charge, the narrow electoral basis on which it rested would  have remained little more than a theoretic grievance, and the bulk of  the people would have cared nothing for political rights. An exclusive  government may be pardoned if it is efficient, an inefficient government  if it rests upon the people. But a government which is both inefficient  and exclusive incurs a weight of odium under which it must ultimately  sink; and this was the kind of government which the Transvaal attempted  to maintain. They ought, therefore, to have either extended their  franchise or reformed their administration. They would not do the  former, lest the new burghers"]]]
