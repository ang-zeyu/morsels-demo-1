[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21003"],[0,"Bell's Cathedrals: The Cathedral Church of Ely (#2)"],[1," the word comes from the Greek for a \"marsh,\" hardly deserves  mention. The Saxon word for \"eel\" was apparently pronounced exactly as  the modern word. Bede gives this etymology: \"A copia anguillarum, quae in  iisdem paludibus capiuntur, nomen accepit.\" William of Malmesbury, in  his \"Gesta Pontificum,\" 1125, takes the same view. The \"Liber Eliensis,\"  of about the same date, also adopts it. Milton may not be regarded as a  great authority upon such a question; he writes, however, as considering  the matter settled. In his Latin poem on the death of Bishop Felton, of  Ely, who died in 1626, he says that Fame, with her hundred tongues, ever  a true messenger of evil and disaster, has spread the report of the  bishop's death:      \"Cessisse morti, et ferreis sororibus,      Te, generis humani decus,    Qui rex sacrorum fuisti in insula      Quae nomen Anguillae tenet.\"    That Ely should mean \"Isle of Eels,\" and that the expression Isle of  Ely is consequently redundant, is no argument against this view. The  Isle of Athelney, beyond all question, means the Isle of the AEthelings'  Isle. Compare also a remarkable instance of redundancy in the name of  the Isle of Axholme. This name, says Canon Taylor, \"shows that it has  been an island during the time of the Celts, Saxons, Danes, and English.  The first syllable, _Ax_, is the Celtic word for the water by which it  was surrounded. The Anglo-Saxons added their word for island to the  Celtic name, and called it Axey. A neighbouring village still goes by  the name of Haxey. The Danes added _holm_--the Danish word for  island--to the Saxon name, and modern English influences have corrupted  Axeyholme into Axelholme, and contracted it into Axholme, and have  finally prefixed the English word _Isle_.\"[2]    The North Girvii and the South Girvii were two peoples that formed  districts of the East Anglian kingdom. In the early part of the seventh  century Anna was King of the East Angles; and Etheldreda, his daughter,  was born at Exning, near Newmarket,--a Suffolk parish, but detached from  the main county and entirely surrounded by Cambridgeshire,--about the  year 630. When quite young there were many suitors for her hand, but she  was altogether unwilling to accept any one of them. But the king, her  father, had so high an opinion of Tonbert--one of the noblemen of his  Court, who was alderman, or, as some render it, prince, of the South  Girvii--that he prevailed upon his daughter to be married to him, and  the marriage took place in 652, two years before Anna's death. From her  husband Etheldreda received the Isle of Ely--that is, the whole of the  region of the South Girvii--as a marriage settlement (\"Insulam Elge ab  eodem sponso ejus accepit in dotem\"). It is clear, therefore, that  Tonbert was something more than an officer of the king's if he had the  power of assigning such a district to his wife.    Tonbert only lived for three years after his marriage, and at his death  his widow came into possession of the Isle of Ely according to the  terms of her marriage settlement. She resided within it, and gave  herself up entirely to works of religion and devotion, entrusting the  civil government of her territory to Ovin. Her reputation for piety was  spread far and wide, and attracted the attention of Egfrid, son of Oswy,  King of Northumberland, who sought her hand in marriage. But no  attraction he could offer could persuade the princess to change her  state, until her Uncle Ethelwold, who was now King of East Anglia,  overcame her scruples. The disturbed state of his kingdom and the  importance of an alliance with so powerful a house as that of Oswy are  believed to have influenced Ethelwold to urge his niece to give her  consent to the proposed marriage; and the marriage took place at York.  It is constantly affirmed by all historians that in neither of these  marriages did the married couple live together as man and wife. At the  Northumbrian Court Etheldreda lived for twelve years, her husband  meanwhile, in 670, having become king. He had been for some years  previously associated with his father in the government. The queen,  however, became more and more wearied of the glories of her royal  position, and tired out her husband with persistent entreaties that she  might be permitted to withdraw herself altogether from his Court and  devote herself entirely to the religious life. At last she obtained his  reluctant consent, and betook herself to Coldingham, where Ebba, the  king's aunt, was abbess, and was there admitted into the order of nuns  at the hands of Wilfrid, Archbishop of York. This Ebba was afterwards  canonised, and her name is preserved in the name of the promontory on  the coast of Berwickshire known as S. Abb's Head.    After remaining about a year at Coldingham, the queen found it necessary  to move away. The king began to regret the permission he had given her,  and, following the advice of some of his courtiers, made his way to the  religious house where Etheldreda was settled, with the intention of  forcibly compelling her return to his Court. His intention having become  known to the abbess, she recommended the queen to escape at once to her  own territory, the Isle of Ely. The queen immediately followed this  advice. Egfrid arrived at Coldingham very soon after her departure, and  set off in pursuit. No reason for her leaving Coldingham is given by  Bede; but a lengthy account of the journey and its occasion is given in  the \"Liber Eliensis.\" In the remarkable sculptures on the corbels in the  octagon are representations of two scenes that are unintelligible  without this account; it is necessary, therefore, to summarise it here.  Directly after setting out from Coldingham, which is some ten miles  north of the Tweed, not far from the sea, the queen, with two lady  companions, Sewenna and Sewara, reached a rocky eminence on the coast,  where the king in pursuit came up with them; but he was \"prevented from  coming near them by a sudden and unusual inundation of water from the  sea, which surrounded the hill, and continued in that state several  days, without retiring into its former channel. Amazed at the  strangeness of this appearance, the king presently interpreted it as the  interposition of Heaven in her favour, and concluded that it was not the  will of God that he should have her again; and this occasioned his  retiring to _York_ again, leaving the queen quietly to pursue her  journey.\"[3] After the king had abandoned his intention of reclaiming  his wife, the three ladies proceeded southwards, and crossed the Humber,  and so through Winteringham and Alftham, where she stayed a few days,  and where she is said to have built a church. This can only mean that  she arranged for its building or undertook the cost. At West Halton, the  next village to Winteringham (as Bentham has observed), the church is  dedicated to S. Etheldreda; and this place may be identified with the  Alftham of the chronicler. The party had now assumed the dress of  pilgrims, and went by unfrequented roads, so as to escape observation.  At one point of their journey a second miraculous event is recorded. The  queen had lain down to sleep while her attendants kept watch, and had  stuck her pilgrim's staff in the ground. When she awoke, this staff was  found to have taken root and already to have brought forth leaves. It  was left standing, and grew into a flourishing tree; and the place, from  the circumstance, was named Etheldrede's-Stow.[4] A church was  afterwards built and dedicated to S. Etheldreda.    In course of time the three pilgrims arrived safely at their  destination. Wilfrid, the archbishop, soon joined them. He had lost  favour with King Egfrid, being supposed to have influenced the queen in  her decision to take the veil. The king, regarding his marriage with  Etheldreda as being _de facto_ dissolved, took another wife, who was for  various reasons much opposed to Wilfrid. The archbishop also greatly  resented the action of the king and Archbishop Theodore in dividing his  diocese without his consent into four different sees, and he was at one  time banished and at another imprisoned.    Etheldreda now set to work in earnest to establish a religious house.  Her buildings were begun in 673. This year is accordingly taken as the  date of the foundation of the monastery and of the town itself. King  Ethelbert is indeed said to have built a church a short distance from  the site of the present cathedral, at a place called Cratendune[5]; but  there is much uncertainty as to the fact, and some considerable  difficulties in reconciling the different references to it. It is stated  that this church had but a short existence, being destroyed by Penda,  King of Mercia. This Ethelbert was the Bretwalda, King of Kent, husband  of the Christian queen Bertha. After his conversion he was instrumental  in furthering the spread of Christianity among the East Saxons, and also  apparently in East Anglia, one of the East Anglian kings, Redwald,  having (but only for a time) given his adherence to the Christian  religion. As the building of this church near Ely is stated to have been  undertaken on the advice of Augustine, who died in 604, we have an  approximate date for it, since Augustine only arrived in England in 597.  Whether this church was so built by Ethelbert or not, it seems clear  there was some church in a state of partial decay standing in 673,  because it is recorded that at first Etheldreda designed to restore it  and to make it the centre of her religious work; but the present site  was judged to be more suitable, and there she began to build. The few  remaining inhabitants of Cratendune soon abandoned their dwellings, and  came to live near the rising buildings of the monastery.    Upon the death of King Anna, who fell in battle against Penda, King of  the Mercians, he was succeeded in turn by his brothers Adelbert and  Ethelwold, and the kingdom"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21007"],[0,"The Bird Study Book (#2)"],[1,"migrating birds often alight on ships  . . . . . . . . .   79    Grouse \"budding\" in an apple tree  . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   88    Cuckoo raiding a tent of caterpillars  . . . . . . . . . . . .  111    Screech owl and its prey . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  115    Passenger Pigeons are now extinct  . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  127    The Great Auk, now extinct . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  133    Terns formerly sought by the feather trade . . . . . . . . . .  144    Crowned Pigeon that furnishes the \"goura\" of    the feather trade  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  159    Migrative birds are protected by the Government  . . . . . . .  172    The grotesque Wood Ibis  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  208    Hungry young Egrets  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  210    Cemented holes shut out the Chickadee  . . . . . . . . . . . .  216    Gourds and boxes for Martins . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  219    A bird bath  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  235    Coloring of birds upon outline drawings  . . . . . . . . . . .  257          {3}    THE BIRD STUDY BOOK      CHAPTER I    FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE BIRDS    It is in spring that wild birds make their strongest appeal to the  human mind; in fact, the words \"birds\" and \"spring\" seem almost  synonymous, so accustomed are we to associate one with the other.  All  the wild riotous singing, all the brave flashing of wings and tail, all  the mad dashing in and out among the thickets or soaring upward above  the tree-tops, are impelled by the perfectly natural instinct of mating  and rearing young.  And where, pray, dwells the soul so poor that it  does not thrill in response to the appeals of the ardent lover, even if  it be a bird, or feel sympathy upon beholding expressions of parental  love and solicitude.  Most people, therefore, are interested in such  spring bird life as comes to their notice, the extent of this interest  depending {4} in part on their opportunity for observation, but more  especially, perhaps, on their individual taste and liking for things  out of doors.    It would seem safe to assume that there is hardly any one who does not  know by sight at least a few birds.  Nearly every one in the eastern  United States and Canada knows the Robin, Crow, and English Sparrow; in  the South most people are acquainted with the Mockingbird and Turkey  Buzzard; in California the House Finch is abundant about the towns and  cities; and to the dwellers in the Prairie States the Meadowlark is  very familiar.    Taking such knowledge, however slight, as a basis, there is no reason  why any one, if he so desires, should not, with a little effort, get on  neighbourly terms with a large number of birds of the region, and  spring is a most favourable time to begin such an effort.  One may  learn more about a bird's habits by closely observing its movements for  a few hours at this season than by watching it for a month later on.  The life that centres about the nest is most {5} absorbing.  Few sights  are more stimulating to interest in outdoor life than spying on a pair  of wild birds engaged in nest building.  Nest hunting, therefore, soon  becomes a part of the bird student's occupation, and I heartily  recommend such a course to beginners, _provided_ great care is  exercised not to injure the nests and their contents.    _Caution in Nest Hunting._--A thoughtful person will, of course, be  careful in approaching a wild bird's nest, otherwise much mischief may  be done in a very short time.  I have known \"dainty eggs\" and \"darling  baby-birds\" to be literally visited to death by well-meaning people,  with the best of intentions.  The parents become discouraged by  constantly recurring alarms and desert the nest, or a cat will follow  the path made through the weeds and leave nothing in the nest worth  observing.  Even the bending of limbs, or the pushing aside of leaves,  will produce a change in the surroundings, which, however slight, may  be sufficient to draw the attention of some feathered enemy.    {6}    When one stumbles on the nest of a Quail, Meadowlark, or Oven-bird, it  is well not to approach it closely, because all over the country many  night-prowling animals have the habit of following by scent the  footsteps of any one who has lately gone along through the woods or  across the fields.  One afternoon by the rarest chance I found three  Quails' nests containing eggs.  The next morning I took out a friend to  share the pleasure of my discoveries.  We found every nest destroyed  and the eggs eaten.  My trail the evening before lay through cultivated  fields, and it was thus easy for us to find in the soft ground the  tracks of the fox or small dog that, during the night, had followed the  trail with calamitous results to the birds.  When finding the nests I  had made the mistake of going to within a few inches of them.  Had I  stopped six feet away the despoiler that followed probably never would  have known there was a nest near, for unless a dog approaches within a  very few feet of a _brooding_ Quail it seems not to possess the power  of smelling it.    [Illustration: The Fox that Followed the Footsteps]    {7}    _Going Afield._--It is rarely necessary to go far afield to begin the  study of birds.  Often one may get good views of birds from one's open  window, as many species build their nests close to the house when the  surroundings are favourable.  Last spring {8} I counted eighteen kinds  of birds one morning while sitting on the veranda of a friend's house,  and later found the nests of no less than seven of them within sight of  the house.  When one starts out to hunt birds it is well to bear in  mind a few simple rules.  The first of these is to go quietly.  One's  good sense would of course tell him not to rush headlong through the  woods, talking loudly to a companion, stepping upon brittle twigs, and  crashing through the underbrush.  Go quietly, stopping to listen every  few steps.  Make no violent motions, as such actions often frighten a  bird more than a noise.  Do not wear brightly coloured clothing, but  garments of neutral tones which blend well with the surroundings of  field and wood.  It is a good idea to sit silently for a time on some  log or stump, and soon the birds will come about you, for they seldom  notice a person who is motionless.  A great aid to field study is a  good _Field Glass_.  A glass enables one to see the colours of small  birds hopping about the shrubbery, or moving through the branches of  trees.  With its {9} aid one may learn much of their movements, and  even observe the kind of food they consume.  A very serviceable glass  may be secured at a price varying from five to ten dollars.  The  National Association of Audubon Societies, New York City, sells a  popular one for five dollars.  If you choose a more expensive,  high-powered binocular, it will be found of greater advantage when  watching birds at a distance, as on a lake or at the seashore.    _Notebooks._--The bird student should early acquire the custom of  making notes on such subjects as are of special interest.  In listening  to the song or call of some unknown bird, the notes can usually be  written down in characters of human speech so that they may be recalled  later with sufficient accuracy to identify the singer.  It is well to  keep a list of the species observed when on a trip.  For many years in  my field excursions I have kept careful lists of the birds seen and  identified, and have found these notes to be of subsequent use and  pleasure.  In college and summer-school work I {10} have always  insisted on pupils cultivating the notebook habit, and results have  well justified this course.    In making notes on a bird that you do not know it is well to state the  size by comparing it with some bird you know, as, for example, \"smaller  than an English Sparrow,\" \"about the size of a Robin,\" and so on.  Try  to determine the true colours of the birds and record these.  Also note  the shape and approximate length of the bill.  This, for example, may  be short and conical like a Canary's, awl-shaped like the bill of a  Warbler, or very long and slender like that of a Snipe.  By failing to  observe these simple rules the learner may be in despair when he tries  to find out the name of his strange bird by examining a bird book, or  may cause some kindly friend an equal amount of annoyance.    [Illustration: Heads and feet of various birds]    As a further aid to subsequent identification it is well to record the  place where the bird was seen, for example: \"hopping up the side of a  tree,\" \"wading in a marsh,\" \"circling about in the air,\" or \"feeding  {12} on dandelions.\"  Such secondary information, while often a  valuable aid to identification, would in itself hardly be sufficient to  enable an ornithologist to render the service desired.    That a young correspondent of mine entertained a contrary view was  evident from a letter I received a few weeks ago from an inexperienced  boy enthusiast, who was a member of a newly formed nature-study class.  Here is the exact wording of the communication: \"Dear Sir: 10 A. M.  Wind East.  Cloudy.  Small bird seen on ground in orchard.  Please  name.  _P. S._ All the leaves have fallen.\"    _Reporting Blanks._--A convenient booklet of reporting blanks and  directions for using them is issued by the National Association of  Audubon Societies, New York City.  This is very useful in recording  descriptions of birds.  (See sample, page 13.)  The blanks may be sent  to the office of the National Association and the species described  will be named.    [Illustration: Sample page of reporting-blank]    Bird Books.--There are a number of inexpensive {14} books which contain  illustrations of birds in natural colours.  One of these will be of the  greatest aid to the beginner in bird study.  Among the most useful are  the Reed's, \"Bird "]]]
