[3] In the twenty-fifth Canto of Purgatory, Dante has said that  when the articulation of the brain is perfect God breathes into  it a new spirit, the living soul; and he means here that, like  St. Paul caught up into Paradise, he cannot tell \"whether in the  body or Out of the body.\" (2 Corinthians, xii. 3).    [4] The desire to be united with God is the source of the eternal  revolution of the heavens. \"The Empyrean . . . is the cause of  the most swift motion of the Primum Mobile. because of the most  ardent desire of every part of the latter to be conjoined with  every part of that most divine quiet heaven.\"--Convito, 14.      The novelty of the sound and the great light kindled in me a  desire concerning their cause, never before felt with such  acuteness. Whereupon she, who saw me as I see myself, to quiet my  perturbed mind opened her mouth, ere I mine to ask, and began,  \"Thou thyself makest thyself dull with false imagining, so that  thou seest not what thou wouldst see, if thou hadst shaken it  off. Thou art not on earth, as thou believest; but lightning,  flying from its proper site, never ran as thou who thereunto[1]  returnest.\"    [1] To thine own proper site,--Heaven, the true home of the soul.      If I was divested of my first doubt by these brief little smiled-  out words, within a new one was I the more enmeshed. And I said,  \"Already I rested content concerning a great wonder; but now I  wonder how I can transcend these light bodies.\" Whereupon she,  after a pitying sigh, directed her eyes toward me, with that look  which a mother turns on her delirious son, and she began, \"All  things whatsoever have order among themselves; and this is the  form which makes the universe like to God. Here[1] the high  creatures[2] see the imprint of the eternal Goodness, which is  the end for which the aforesaid rule is made. In the order of  which I speak, all natures are arranged, by diverse lots, more or  less near to their source;[3] wherefore they are moved to diverse  ports through the great sea of being, and each one with an  instinct given to it which may bear it on. This bears the fire  upward toward the moon; this is the motive force in mortal  hearts; this binds together and unites the earth. Nor does this  bow shoot forth.[4] Only the created things which are outside  intelligence, but also those which have understanding and love.  The Providence that adjusts all this, with its own light makes  forever quiet the heaven[5] within which that revolves which hath  the greatest speed. And thither now, as to a site decreed, the  virtue of that cord bears us on which directs to a joyful mark  whatever it shoots. True is it, that as the form often accords  not to the intention of the art, because the material is deaf to  respond, so the creature sometimes deviates from this course; for  it has power, though thus impelled, to incline in another  direction (even as the fire of a cloud may be seen to fall[6]),  if the first impetus, bent aside by false pleasure, turn it  earthwards. Thou shouldst not, if I deem aright, wonder more at  thy ascent, than at a stream if from a high mountain it descends  to the base. A marvel it would be in thee, if, deprived of  hindrance, thou hadst sat below, even as quiet in living fire on  earth would be.\"    [1] In this order of the universe.    [2] The created beings endowed with souls,--angels and men.    [3] The source of their being, God.    [4] This instinct directs to their proper end animate as well as  inanimate things, as the bow shoots the arrow to its mark.    [5] The Empyrean, within which the Primum Mobile, the first  moving heaven, revolves.    [6] Contrary to its true nature.      Thereon she turned again toward heaven her face.        CANTO II. Proem.--Ascent to the Moon.--The cause of Spots on the  Moon.--Influence of the Heavens.    O ye, who are in a little bark, desirous to listen, following  behind my craft which singing passes on, turn to see again Your  shores; put not out upon the deep; for haply losing me, ye would  remain astray. The water that I sail was never crossed. Minerva  inspires, and Apollo guides me, and nine Muses point out to me  the Bears.    Ye other few, who have lifted tip your necks be. times to the  bread of the Angels, oil which one here subsists, but never  becomes sated of it, ye may well put forth your vessel over the  salt deep, keeping my wake before you on the water which turns  smooth again. Those glorious ones who passed over to Colchos  wondered not as ye shall do, when they saw Jason become a  ploughman.    The concreate and perpetual thirst for the deiform realm was  bearing us on swift almost as ye see the heavens. Beatrice was  looking upward, and I upon her, and perhaps in such time as a  quarrel[1] rests, and flies, and from the notch is unlocked,[2] I  saw myself arrived where a wonderful thing drew my sight to  itself; and therefore she, from whom the working of my mind could  not be hid, turned toward me, glad as beautiful. \"Uplift thy  grateful mind to God,\" she said to me, \"who with the first  star[3] has conjoined us.\"    [1] The bolt for a cross-bow.    [2] The inverse order indicates the instantaneousness of the act.    [3] The moon.      It seemed to me that a cloud had covered us, lucid, dense, solid,  and polished, like a diamond which the sun had struck. Within  itself the eternal pearl had received us, even as water receives  a ray of light, remaining unbroken. If I was body (and here[1]  it is not conceivable how one dimension brooked another, which  needs must be if body enter body) the desire ought the more to  kindle us to see that Essence, in which is seen how our nature  and God were united. There will be seen that which we hold by  faith, not demonstrated, but it will be known of itself like the  first truth which man believes.[2]    [1] On earth, by mortal faculties.    [2] Not demonstrated by argument, but known by direct cognition,  like the intuitive perception of first principles, per se notu.      I replied, \"My Lady, devoutly to the utmost that I can, do I  thank him who from the mortal world has removed me. But tell me  what are the dusky marks of this body, which there below on earth  make people fable about Cain?\"[1]      [1] Fancying the dark spaces on the surface of the moon to  represent Cain carrying a thorn-bush for the fire of his  sacrifice.      She smiled somewhat, and then she said, \"If the opinion of  mortals errs where the key of sense unlocks not, surely the  shafts of wonder ought not now to pierce thee, since thou seest  that the reason following the senses has short wings. But tell me  what thou thyself thinkest of it.\" And I, \"That which here above  appears to us diverse, I believe is caused by rare and dense  bodies.\" And she, \"Surely enough thou shalt see that thy belief  is submerged in error, if then listenest well to the argument  that I shall make against it. The eighth sphere[1] displays to  you many lights, which may be noted of different aspects in  quality and quantity. If rare and dense effected all this,[2] one  single virtue, more or less or equally distributed, would be in  all. Different virtues must needs be fruits of formal  principles;[3] and by thy reckoning, these, all but one, would  be destroyed. Further, if rarity were the cause of that darkness  of which you ask, either this planet would be thus deficient of  its matter through and through, or else as a body distributes the  fat and the loan, so this would interchange the leaves in its  volume. If the first were the case, it would be manifest in the  eclipses of the sun, by the shining through of the light, as when  it is poured out upon any other rare body. This is not so;  therefore we must look at the other, and if it happen that I  quash this other, thy opinion will be falsified. If it be that  this rare passes not through,[4] there needs must be a limit,  beyond which its contrary allows it not to pass further; and  thence the ray from another body is poured back, just as color  returns through a glass which hides lead behind itself. Now thou  wilt say that the ray shows itself dimmer there than in the other  parts, by being there reflected from further back. From this  objection experiment, which is wont to be the fountain to the  streams of your arts, may deliver thee, if ever thou try it. Thou  shalt take three mirrors, and set two of them at an equal  distance from thee, and let the other, further removed, meet  thine eyes between the first two. Turning toward them, cause a  light to be placed behind thy back, which may illumine the three  mirrors, and return to thee thrown back front all. Although the  more distant image reach thee not so great in quantity, thou wilt  then see how it cannot but be of equal brightness.    [1] The heaven of the fixed stars.    [2] If all this difference were caused merely by difference in  rarity and density.    [3] The stars exert various influences; hence their differences,  from which the variety of their influence proceeds, must be  caused by different formal principles or intrinsic causes.

[2[My argument has removed the error which covered thy mind, and  nov I will tell thee the true cause of the variety in the  surface of the moon.    \"Within the heaven of the divine peace revolves a body, in whose  virtue lies the being of all that it contains.[1] The following  heaven[2] which has so many sights, distributes that being  through divers essences[3] from it distinct, and by it  contained. The other spheres, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19979"],[0,"A Righte Merrie Christmasse: The Story of Christ-Tide (#2)"],[1," known as Clemens of Alexandria, lived  exactly at this time, and was a contemporary of Origen. He speaks  plainly on the subject, and shows the uncertainty, even at that early  epoch of Christianity, of fixing the date:[1] \"There are those who,  with an over-busy curiosity, attempt to fix not only the year, but the  date of our Saviour's birth, who, they say, was born in the  twenty-eighth year of Augustus, on the 25th of the month Pachon,\"  _i.e._ the 20th of May. And in another place he says: \"Some say that  He was born on the 24th or 25th of the month Pharmuthi,\" which would  be the 19th or 20th of April.    [Footnote 1: _Stromat._, L. 1, pp. 407-408, ed. Oxon., 1715.]    But, perhaps, the best source of information is from the _Memoires  pour servir a l'histoire ecclesiastique des six premiers Siecles_, by  Louis Sebastian le Nain de Tillemont, written at the very commencement  of the eighteenth century,[2] and I have no hesitation in appending a  portion of his fourth note, which treats \"_Upon the day and year of  the birth of Jesus Christ_.\"    [Footnote 2: Translated by T. Deacon in 1733-35, pp. 335-336.]    \"It is thought that Jesus Christ was born in the night, because it was  night when the angel declared His birth to the shepherds: in which S.  Augustin says that He literally fulfilled David's words, _Ante  luciferum genuite_.    \"The tradition of the Church, says this father, is that it was upon  the 25th of December. Casaubon acknowledges that we should not  immediately reject it upon the pretence that it is too cold a season  for cattle to be at pasture, there being a great deal of difference  between these countries and Judaea; and he assures us that, even in  England, they leave the cows in the field all the year round.    \"S. Chrysostom alleges several reasons to prove that Jesus Christ was  really born upon the 25th of December; but they are weak enough,  except that which he assures of, that it has always been the belief of  the Western Churches. S. Epiphanius, who will have the day to have  been the 6th of January, places it but at twelve days' distance. S.  Clement of Alexandria says that, in his time, some fixed the birth of  Jesus Christ upon the 19th or 20th April; others, on the 20th of May.  He speaks of it as not seeing anything certain in it.    \"It is cited from one John of Nice, that it was only under Pope Julius  that the Festival of the Nativity was fixed at Rome upon the 25th of  December. Father Combesisius, who has published the epistle of this  author, confesses that he is very modern: to which we may add that he  is full of idle stories, and entirely ignorant of the history and  discipline of antiquity. So that it is better to rest upon the  testimony of S. Chrysostom, who asserts that, for a long time before,  and by very ancient tradition, it was celebrated upon the 25th of  December in the West, that is, in all the countries which reach from  Thrace to Cadiz, and to the farthest parts of Spain. He names Rome  particularly; and thinks that it might be found there that this was  the true day of our Saviour's birth, by consulting the registers of  the description of Judaea made at that time, supposing them still to be  preserved there. We find this festival placed upon the 25th of  December in the ancient Roman Calendar, which was probably made in the  year 354....    \"We find by S. Basil's homily upon the birth of our Lord that a  festival in commemoration of it was observed in Cappadocia, provided  that this homily is all his; but I am not of opinion that it appears  from thence either that this was done in January rather than December  or any other month in the year, or that this festival was joined with  that of the Baptism. On the contrary, the Churches of Cappadocia seem  to have distinguished the Feast of the Nativity from that of the  Epiphany, for S. Gregory Nazianzen says, that after he had been  ordained priest, in the year 361, upon the festival of one mystery, he  retired immediately after into Pontus, on that of another mystery, and  returned from Pontus upon that of a third. Now we find that he  returned at Easter, so that there is all imaginable reason to believe  that he was ordained at Christmas, and retired upon the Epiphany. S.  Basil died, in all probability, upon the 1st of January in the year  379, and S. Gregory Nyssen says that his festival followed close upon  those of Christmas, S. Stephen, S. Peter, S. James, and S. John. We  read in an oration ascribed to S. Amphilochius, that he died on the  day of the Circumcision, between the Nativity of Jesus Christ and His  Baptism. S. Gregory Nyssen says that the Feast of Lights, and of the  Baptism of Jesus Christ, was celebrated some days after that of His  Nativity. The other S. Gregory takes notice of several mysteries which  were commemorated at Nazianzium with the Nativity, the Magi, etc., but  he says nothing, in that place, of the Baptism. And yet, if the  festival of Christmas was observed in Cappadocia upon the 25th of  December, we must say that S. Chrysostom was ignorant of it, since he  ascribes this practice only to Thrace and the more Western  provinces....    \"In the year 377, or soon after, some persons who came from Rome,  introduced into Syria the practice of celebrating our Lord's Nativity  in the month of December, upon the same day as was done in the West;  and this festival was so well received in that country that in less  than ten years it was entirely established at Antioch, and was  observed there by all the people with great solemnity, though some  complained of it as an innovation. S. Chrysostom, who informs us of  all this, speaks of it in such a manner as to make Father Thomassin  say, not that the birth of Jesus Christ had till then been kept upon a  wrong day, but that absolutely it had not been celebrated there at  all.    \"S. Chrysostom seems to say, that this festival was received at the  same time by the neighbouring provinces to Antioch; but this must not  be extended as far as to Egypt, as we learn from a passage in Cassian.  This author seems to speak only of the time when he was in Scetae  (about 399), but also of that when he wrote his tenth conference  (about the year 420 or 425). But it appears that, in the year 432,  Egypt had likewise embraced the practice of Rome: for Paul of Emesa,  in the discourse which he made then at Alexandria upon the 29th of  Coiac, which is the 25th of December, says it was the day on which  Jesus Christ was born. S. Isidore of Pelusium, in Egypt, mentions the  Theophany and the Nativity of our Saviour, according to the flesh, as  two different festivals. We were surprised to read in an oration of  Basil of Seleucia, upon S. Stephen, that Juvenal of Jerusalem, who  might be made bishop about the year 420, was the first who celebrated  there our Saviour's Nativity.\"    The Armenian Church still keeps up the eastern 6th of January as  Christmas day--and, as the old style of the calendar is retained, it  follows that they celebrate the Nativity twenty-four days after we do:  and modern writers make the matter more mixed--for Wiesseler thinks  that the date of the Nativity was 10th January, whilst Mr. Greswell  says it occurred on the 9th April B.C. 4.    It is not everybody that knows that our system of chronology is four  years wrong--_i.e._ that Jesus Christ must have been born four years  before _Anno Domini_, the year of our Lord. It happened in this way.  Dionysius Exiguus, in 533, first introduced the system of writing the  words _Anno Domini_, to point out the number of years which had  elapsed since the Incarnation of our Lord; in other words he  introduced our present chronology. He said the year 1 was the same as  the year A.U.C. (from the building of Rome) 754; and this statement he  based on the fact that our Saviour was born in the twenty-eighth year  of the reign of Augustus; and he reckoned from A.U.C. 727, when the  emperor first took the name of Augustus. The early Christians,  however, dated from the battle of Actium, which was A.U.C. 723, thus  making the Nativity 750. Now we believe that that event took place  during Herod's reign, and we know that Herod died between the 13th  March and 29th March, on which day Passover commenced, in A.U.C. 750,  so that it stands to reason that our chronology is wrong.    Some think that the date of 25th December, which certainly began in  the Roman Church, was fixed upon to avoid the multiplication of  festivals about the vernal equinox, and to appropriate to a Christian  use the existing festival of the winter solstice--the returning sun  being made symbolical of the visit of Christ to our earth; and to  withdraw Christian converts from those pagan observances with which  the closing year was crowded, whilst the licence of the _Saturnalia_  was turned into the merriment of Christmas.    This festival of the Saturnalia (of which the most complete account is  given by Macrobius in his _Conviviorum Saturnaliorum_) dated from the  remotest settlement of Latium, whose people reverenced Saturnus as the  author of husbandry and the arts of life. At this festival the utmost  freedom of social intercourse was permitted to all classes; even  slaves were allowed to come to the tables of their masters clothed in  their apparel, and were waited on by those whom they were accustomed  to serve. Feasting, gaming, and revelry were the occupations of all  classes, without discrimination of age, or sex, or rank. Processions  crowded the streets, boisterous with mirth: these illuminated the  night with lighted tapers of wax, which were also used as gifts  between friends in the humbler walks of life. The season was one for  the exchange of gifts of friendship, and especially of gifts to  children. It began on the 17th December, and extended virtually, to  the commencement of the New Year.    Prynne[3] speaks thus of Christmas: \"If we compare our Bacchanalian  Christmasses and New Year's Tides with"]]]
