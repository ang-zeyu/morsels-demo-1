It is nothing but a grass bank with some not very pretty trees  scattered over it, wholly without grouping. The stream at the bottom  is rocky indeed, but its rocks are mean, flat, and of a dull yellow  color. The sky is gray and shapeless. There's absolutely nothing to  paint anywhere of essential landscape subject, as commonly understood.    Now see what the landscape consists in, which I have told you is one  of the most beautiful ever painted by man. There's first a little bit  of it left nearly wild, not quite wild; there's a cart and rider's  track through it among the copse; and then, standing simply on the  wild moss-troopers' ground, the scattered ruins of a great abbey, seen  so dimly, that they seem to be fading out of sight, in color as in  time.    These two things together, the wild copse wood and the ruin, take you  back into the life of the fourteenth century. The one is the  border-riders' kingdom; the other that of peace which has striven  against border-riding--how vainly! Both these are remains of the past.  But the outhouses and refectory of the abbey have been turned into a  farmhouse, and that is inhabited, and in front of it the Mistress is  feeding her chickens. You see the country is perfectly quiet and  innocent, for there is no trace of a fence anywhere; the cattle have  strayed down to the riverside, it being a hot day; and some rest in  the shade and two in the water.    They could not have done so at their ease had the river not been  humanized. Only a little bit of its stony bed is left; a mill weir,  thrown across, stays the water in a perfectly clear and delicious  pool; to show how clear it is, Turner has put the only piece of  playing color in all the picture into the reflections in this. One cow  is white, another white and red, evidently as clean as morning dew  can wash their sides. They could not have been so in a country where  there was the least coal smoke; so Turner has put a wreath of  perfectly white smoke through the trees; and lest that should not be  enough to show you they burnt wood, he has made his foreground of a  piece of copse just lopped, with the new fagots standing up against  it; and this still not being enough to give you the idea of perfect  cleanliness, he has covered the stones of the river-bed with white  clothes laid out to dry; and that not being enough yet, for the  river-bed might be clean though nothing else was, he has put a  quantity more hanging over the abbey walls.    9. _Only natural phenomena in their direct relation to  humanity_--these are to be your subjects in landscape. Rocks and water  and air may no more be painted for their own sakes, than the armor  carved without the warrior.    But, secondly. I said landscape is to be a _passionate representation_  of these things. It must be done, that is to say, with strength and  depth of soul. This is indeed to some extent merely the particular  application of a principle that has no exception. If you are without  strong passions, you cannot be a painter at all. The laying of paint  by an insensitive person, whatever it endeavors to represent, is not  painting, but daubing or plastering; and that, observe, irrespective  of the boldness or minuteness of the work. An insensitive person will  daub with a camel's hair-brush and ultramarine; and a passionate one  will paint with mortar and a trowel.    10. But far more than common passion is necessary to paint landscape.  The physical conditions there are so numerous, and the spiritual ones  so occult, that you are sure to be overpowered by the materialism,  unless your sentiment is strong. No man is naturally likely to think  first of anatomy in painting a pretty woman; but he is very apt to do  so in painting a mountain. No man of ordinary sense will take pleasure  in features that have no meaning, but he may easily take it in heath,  woods or waterfalls, that have no expression. So that it needs much  greater strength of heart and intellect to paint landscape than  figure: many commonplace persons, bred in good schools, have painted  the figure pleasantly or even well; but none but the strongest--John  Bellini, Titian, Velasquez, Tintoret, Mantegna, Sandro Botticelli,  Carpaccio and Turner--have ever painted a fragment of good landscape.  In missal painting exquisite figure-drawing is frequent, and landscape  backgrounds in late works are elaborate; but I only know thoroughly  good landscape in one book; and I have examined--I speak  deliberately--thousands.    11. For one thing, the passion is necessary for the mere quantity of  design. In good art, whether painting or sculpture, I have again and  again told you every touch is necessary and beautifully intended. Now  it falls within the compass of ordinary application to place rightly  all the folds of drapery or gleams of light on a chain, or ornaments  in a pattern; but when it comes to placing every leaf in a tree, the  painter gets tired. Here, for instance, is a little bit of Sandro  Botticelli background; I have purposefully sketched it in the  slightest way, that you might see how the entire value of it depends  on thoughtful placing. There is no texture aimed at, no completion,  scarcely any variety of light and shade; but by mere care in the  placing the thing is beautiful. Well, every leaf, every cloud, every  touch is placed with the same care in great work; and when this is  done as by John Bellini in the picture of Peter Martyr,[2] or as it  was by Titian in the great Peter Martyr, with every leaf in a wood he  gets tired. I know no other such landscape in the world as that is, or  as that was.    [Footnote 2: National Gallery, No. 812.]    12. Perhaps you think on such conditions you never can paint landscape  at all. Well, great landscape certainly not; but pleasant and useful  landscape, yes; provided only the passion you bring to it be true and  pure. The degree of it you cannot command; the genuineness of it you  can--yes, and the depth of source also. Tintoret's passion may be like  the Reichenbach, and yours only like a little dripping Holywell, but  both equally from deep springs.    13. But though the virtue of all painting (and similarly of sculpture  and every other art) is in passion, I must not have you begin by  working passionately. The discipline of youth, in all its work, is in  cooling and curbing itself, as the discipline of age is in warming and  urging itself; you know the Bacchic chorus of old men in Plato's  _Laws_. To the end of life, indeed, the strength of a man's finest  nature is shown in due continence; but that is because the finest  natures remain young to the death: and for you the first thing you  have to do in art (as in life) is to be quiet and firm--quiet, above  everything; and modest, with this most essential modesty, that you  must like the landscape you are going to draw better than you expect  to like your drawing of it, however well it may succeed. If you would  not rather have the real thing than your sketch of it, you are not in  a right state of mind for sketching at all. If you only think of the  scene, \"what a nice sketch this will make!\" be assured you will never  make a nice sketch of it. You may think you have produced a beautiful  work; nay, perhaps the public and many fair judges will agree with  you; but I tell you positively, there will be no enduring value in  what you have thus done. Whereas if you think of the scene, \"Ah, if I  could only get some shadow or scrawl of this to carry away with me,  how glad I should be!\"--then whatever you do will be, according to  your strength, good and progressive: it may be feeble, or much  faultful, but it will be vital and essentially precious.    14. Now, it is not possible for you to command this state of mind, or  anything like it, in yourselves at once. Nay, in all probability your  eyes are so satiated by the false popular art surrounding us now on  all sides, that you cannot see the delicate reality though you try;  but even though you may not care for the truth, you can act as if you  did, and tell it.    Now, therefore, observe this following quite plain direction. Whenever  you set yourself to draw anything, consider only how best you may give  a person who has not seen the place, a true idea of it. Use any means  in your power to do that, and don't think of the person for whom you  are drawing as a connoisseur, but as a person of ordinary sense and  feeling. Don't get artist-like qualities for him: but first give him  the pleasant sensation of being at the place, then show him how the  land lies, how the water runs, how the wind blows, and so on. Always  think of the public as Moliere of his old woman; you have done nothing  really great or good if you can't please her.    15. Now beginning wisely, so as to lose no time or labor, you will  learn to paint all the conditions of quiet light and sky, before you  attempt those of variable light and cloud. Do not trouble yourselves  with or allow yourselves to be tempted by any effects that are  brilliant or tremendous; except only that from the beginning I  recommend you to watch always for sunrise; to keep a little diary of  the manner of it, and to have beside your window a small sketch-book,  with pencil cut over night, and colors moist. The one indulgence which  I would have you allow yourselves in fast coloring, for some time, is  the endeavor to secure some record at the instant of the colors of  morning clouds; while, if they are merely white or gray or blue, you  must get an outline of them with pencil. You will soon feel by this  means what are the real difficulties to be encountered in all  landscape coloring, and your eyes will be educated to quantity and  harmonious action of forms.    But for the rest--learn to paint everything in the quietest and  simplest light.
