My breath is stronger than your whole body.\" Then,  taking from his knapsack a piece of white cheese, he showed it to the  dragon. \"Do you see this stone?\" he said. \"Pick one up from the bank  of yonder stream, and we'll try our strength.\"    The dragon took a stone from the shore of the brook.    \"Can you squeeze buttermilk out of the stone?\" asked Stan.    The dragon crushed the stone in his hand, so that he crumbled it into  powder. But he squeezed no buttermilk from it.    \"It can't be done,\" he said rather angrily.    \"I'll show you whether it can be done,\" replied Stan, and then  squeezed the soft cheese in his hand, till the buttermilk trickled  down between his fingers.    When the dragon saw this, he began to look about him to find the  shortest road to run away; but Stan placed himself before the forest.  \"Let us have a little reckoning about what you have taken from the  fold,\" he said. \"Nothing is given away here.\"    The poor dragon would have taken flight, if he hadn't been afraid that  Stan might blow behind him, and bury him under the trees in the  forest. So he stood still, like a person who doesn't know what else to  do.    \"Listen!\" he said, after a while. \"I see that you are a useful man. My  mother has long been looking for a servant like you, but has not been  able to find one. Enter our service. The year has three days, and each  day's wages is seven sacks of ducats!\"    Three times seven sacks of ducats! A fine business! That was just what  Stan needed. \"And,\" he thought, \"if I've outwitted the dragon, I can  probably get the better of his mother!\" So he didn't waste many words  about the matter, but set off with the monster. A long, rough road;  but still it was too short, since it led to a bad end. It seemed to  Stan as if he had arrived almost before he started.    The old she-dragon, old as Time itself, was waiting for them. She had  made a fire under the huge caldron, in which she meant to boil the  milk and mix it with the blood of a lamb and the marrow from its  bones, that the liquid might have healing power. Stan saw her eyes  glistening in the darkness when they were still three gun-shots off.  But, when they reached the spot and the she-dragon perceived that her  son had brought her nothing, she was very angry. This she-dragon was  by no means lovable. She had a wrinkled face, open jaws, tangled hair,  sunken eyes, parched lips, and a breath reeking with the smell of  onions.    \"Stay here,\" said the dragon. \"I'll go and make arrangements with my  mother.\"    Stan would willingly have stood still further off, but he had no  choice now that he had once entered upon this evil business. So he let  the dragon go on.    \"Listen, mother!\" said the dragon, when he had entered the house.  \"I've brought you a man to get rid of. He's a terrible fellow, who  eats pieces of rock and squeezes buttermilk out of stones.\" Then he  told her what had happened.    \"Just leave him to me,\" she said, after hearing the whole story. \"No  man ever slipped through _my_ fingers.\"    So the matter remained as it had first been settled. Stan Bolovan  became the servant of this monster and his mother. A terrible fix! I  really don't know what will come of it.    The next day, the she-dragon gave him his task. They were to give a  signal to the dragon world with a club sheathed in seven thicknesses  of iron. The dragon raised the club and hurled it three miles, then he  set off with Stan, that he might also throw it three miles, or, if  possible, further still. When Stan reached the club, he began to look  at it rather anxiously. He saw that he and all his children together  could not even lift it from the ground.    \"Why are you standing there?\" asked the dragon.    \"Why, you see, it's such a handsome club. I'm sorry,\" replied Stan.    \"Sorry? Why?\" inquired the dragon.    \"Because,\" answered Stan, \"I'm afraid you'll never see it again in  your whole life, if I throw it; for I know my own strength.\"    \"Don't fear. Just throw it,\" replied the dragon.    \"If you really mean it, we'll first go and get provisions enough to  last three days; for we shall have to travel at least three days, if  not longer, to get it.\"    These words frightened the dragon, but he did not yet believe that it  would be so bad as Stan said. So they went home for the provisions,  though he wasn't at all pleased with the idea of having Stan serve his  year in merely going after the club. When they got back again to it,  Stan sat down on the bag of provisions and became absorbed in staring  at the moon.    \"What are you doing?\" asked the dragon.    \"Only waiting for the moon to sail by.\"    \"Why?\"    \"Don't you see that the moon is directly in my way?\" said Stan. \"Or do  you want me to fling the club into the moon?\"    The dragon now began to be seriously anxious. It was a club that had  descended to him from his ancestors, and he wouldn't have liked to  lose it in the moon.    \"I'll tell you what,\" he said. \"Don't throw the club. I'll do it  myself.\"    \"Certainly not. Heaven forbid!\" replied Stan. \"Only wait till the moon  passes by.\"    Then a long conversation followed; for Stan would not consent to have  the dragon throw the club again, except on the promise of seven sacks  of ducats.    \"Oh, dear! mother, he's a tremendously strong man,\" said the dragon.  \"I could scarcely prevent him from throwing the club into the moon.\"    The she-dragon began to be anxious, too. Just think of it! Would it be  a joke to have a person able to throw any thing into the moon? She was  a she-dragon of true dragon blood, however, and the next day had  thought of a still harder task.    \"Bring some water,\" she said early in the morning, and gave each  twelve buffalo skins, ordering them to fill them by evening, and fetch  them all home at once.    They went to the well; and, before one could wink, the dragon had  filled the twelve skins, and was in the act of carrying them back.  Stan was tired, he had scarcely been able to drag the empty skins  along. A chill ran through his veins, when he thought of the full  ones. What do you suppose he did? He pulled a worn-out knife blade  from his belt, and began to scratch the earth around the well with it.    \"What are you doing?\" asked the dragon.    \"I'm not a blockhead, that I should go to the labor of filling the  skins with water,\" replied Stan.    \"But how will you carry the water to the house, then?\"    \"How? Just as you see,\" said Stan. \"I'm going to take the well, you  goose!\"    The dragon stood with his mouth wide-open in amazement. He wouldn't  have had this done on any account, for the well was one that had  belonged to his ancestors.    \"I'll tell you,\" he said anxiously, \"let me carry your skins home,  too.\"    \"Certainly not. Heaven forbid!\" replied Stan, digging on around the  well.    Now, another long discussion followed; and this time, too, the dragon  could only persuade Stan by promising him seven sacks of ducats.    On the third day, that is the last one, the she-dragon sent them into  the forest for wood.    Before one could count three, the dragon tore up more trees than Stan  had ever seen before in his whole life, and piled them up together.  But Stan began to examine the trees, chose the very finest, climbed up  into one and tied its top with a wild grape-vine to the next. So,  without saying a word, he continued to fasten one splendid tree to  another.    \"What are you doing there?\" asked the dragon.    \"You see what I am doing,\" replied Stan, working quietly on.    \"Why are you tying the trees together?\"    \"Why, to save myself unnecessary work in pulling them up one by one,\"  said Stan.    \"But how are you going to carry them home?\"    \"I shall take the whole forest, you goose! Can't you understand that?\"  said Stan, continuing to fasten them together.    The dragon now felt as if he wanted to take to his heels, and never  stop until he reached home.    But he was afraid that he should suddenly find Stan pulling the whole  forest down on his head.    This time, as it was the end of the year's service, it seemed as if  the discussion would never cease. Stan did not want to listen at all,  but had set his mind upon flinging the forest on his back at any rate.    \"I'll tell you what,\" said the dragon, trembling with fear, \"your  wages shall be seven times seven sacks of ducats. Content yourself  with that.\"    \"Well, be it so, as I see you are a good fellow,\" replied Stan, and  agreed that the dragon should carry the wood for him.    The year was now over. Stan was anxious only about one things--how he  was to drag so many ducats home.    In the evening, the dragon and his mother sat talking together in  their room; but Stan listened in the entry.    \"Woe betide us!\" said the dragon: \"this fellow upsets us terribly.  Give him money, even more than he has, only let us get rid of him.\"    Ah, yes! but the she-dragon cared for money.    \"Let me tell you one thing,\" she said: \"you must kill this man  to-night.\"    \"I am afraid of him, mother,\" he answered in terror.    \"Have no fear,\" replied his mother. \"When you see that he is asleep,  take your club and strike him in the middle of the forehead.\"    So it was agreed. Ah, yes! but Stan always had a bright idea at the  right time. When he saw that the dragon and his mother had put out the  light, he took the pig's trough, and laid it bottom upward in his  place, covered it carefully with a shaggy coat, and lay down himself  under the bed, where he began to snore like a person who is sound  asleep.    The dragon went out softly, approached the bed, raised his club, and  struck one blow on the spot where Stan's head ought to have been. The  trough sounded hollow, Stan groaned, and the dragon tiptoed back  again.    Stan then crept out from under the bed, cleaned it, and lay down, but  was wise enough not to close an eye all night long.    The dragon and his mother were rigid with amazement when they saw Stan  come in the next"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20556"],[0,"Lamarck, the Founder of Evolution (#2)"],[1,"                     32             V.

HIS LIFE AND WORK          CHAPTER I    BIRTH, FAMILY, YOUTH, AND MILITARY CAREER      The life of Lamarck is the old, old story of a man of genius who lived  far in advance of his age, and who died comparatively unappreciated and  neglected. But his original and philosophic views, based as they were on  broad conceptions of nature, and touching on the burning questions of  our day, have, after the lapse of a hundred years, gained fresh interest  and appreciation, and give promise of permanent acceptance.    The author of the _Flore Francaise_ will never be forgotten by his  countrymen, who called him the French Linne; and he who wrote the  _Animaux sans Vertebres_ at once took the highest rank as the leading  zooelogist of his period. But Lamarck was more than a systematic  biologist of the first order. Besides rare experience and judgment in  the classification of plants and of animals, he had an unusually active,  inquiring, and philosophical mind, with an originality and boldness in  speculation, and soundness in reasoning and in dealing with such  biological facts as were known in his time, which have caused his views  as to the method of organic evolution to again come to the front.    As a zooelogical philosopher no one of his time approached Lamarck. The  period, however, in which he lived was not ripe for the hearty and  general adoption of the theory of descent. As in the organic world we  behold here and there prophetic types, anticipating, in their  generalized synthetic nature, the incoming, ages after, of more  specialized types, so Lamarck anticipated by more than half a century  the principles underlying the present evolutionary theories.    So numerous are now the adherents, in some form, of Lamarck's views,  that at the present time evolutionists are divided into Darwinians and  Lamarckians or Neolamarckians. The factors of organic evolution as  stated by Lamarck, it is now claimed by many, really comprise the  primary or foundation principles or initiative causes of the origin of  life-forms. Hence not only do many of the leading biologists of his  native country, but some of those of Germany, of the United States, and  of England, justly regard him as the founder of the theory of organic  evolution.    Besides this, Lamarck lived in a transition period. He prepared the way  for the scientific renascence in France. Moreover, his simple, unselfish  character was a rare one. He led a retired life. His youth was tinged  with romance, and during the last decade of his life he was blind. He  manfully and patiently bore adverse criticisms, ridicule,  forgetfulness, and inappreciation, while, so far from renouncing his  theoretical views, he tenaciously clung to them to his dying day.    The biography of such a character is replete with interest, and the  memory of his unselfish and fruitful devotion to science should be  forever cherished. His life was also notable for the fact that after his  fiftieth year he took up and mastered a new science; and at a period  when many students of literature and science cease to be productive and  rest from their labors, he accomplished the best work of his life--work  which has given him lasting fame as a systematist and as a philosophic  biologist. Moreover, Lamarckism comprises the fundamental principles of  evolution, and will always have to be taken into consideration in  accounting for the origin, not only of species, but especially of the  higher groups, such as orders, classes, and phyla.    This striking personage in the history of biological science, who has  made such an ineffaceable impression on the philosophy of biology,  certainly demands more than a brief _eloge_ to keep alive his memory.           ~       ~       ~       ~       ~    Jean-Baptiste-Pierre-Antoine de Monet, Chevalier de Lamarck, was born  August 1, 1744, at Bazentin-le-Petit. This little village is situated in  Picardy, or what is now the Department of the Somme, in the  Arrondissement de Peronne, Canton d'Albert, a little more than four  miles from Albert, between this town and Bapaume, and near Longueval,  the nearest post-office to Bazentin. The village of Bazentin-le-Grand,  composed of a few more houses than its sister hamlet, is seen half a  mile to the southeast, shaded by the little forest such as borders  nearly every town and village in this region. The two hamlets are  pleasantly situated in a richly cultivated country, on the chalk uplands  or downs of Picardy, amid broad acres of wheat and barley variegated  with poppies and the purple cornflower, and with roadsides shaded by  tall poplars.    The peasants to the number of 251 compose the diminishing population.  There were 356 in 1880, or about that date. The silence of the single  little street, with its one-storied, thatched or tiled cottages, is at  infrequent intervals broken by an elderly dame in her _sabots_, or by a  creaking, rickety village cart driven by a farmer-boy in blouse and  hob-nailed shoes. The largest inhabited building is the _mairie_, a  modern structure, at one end of which is the village school, where  fifteen or twenty urchins enjoy the instructions of the worthy teacher.  A stone church, built in 1774, and somewhat larger than the needs of the  hamlet at present require, raises its tower over the quiet scene.    Our pilgrimage to Bazentin had for its object the discovery of the  birthplace of Lamarck, of which we could obtain no information in Paris.  Our guide from Albert took us to the _mairie_, and it was with no little  satisfaction that we learned from the excellent village teacher,  M. Duval, that the house in which the great naturalist was born was  still standing, and but a few steps away, in the rear of the church and  of the _mairie_. With much kindness he left his duties in the  schoolroom, and accompanied us to the ancient structure.    [Illustration: BIRTHPLACE OF LAMARCK, FRONT VIEW]    [Illustration: BIRTHPLACE OF LAMARCK]    The modest _chateau_ stands a few rods to the westward of the little  village, and was evidently the seat of the leading family of the place.  It faces east and is a two-storied house of the shape seen everywhere in  France, with its high, incurved roof; the walls, nearly a foot and a  half thick, built of brick; the corners and windows of blocks of white  limestone. It is about fifty feet long and twenty-five feet wide. Above  the roof formerly rose a small tower. There is no porch over the front  door. Within, a rather narrow hall passes through the centre, and opens  into a large room on each side. What was evidently the drawing-room or  _salon_ was a spacious apartment with a low white wainscot and a heavy  cornice. Over the large, roomy fireplace is a painting on the wood  panel, representing a rural scene, in which a shepherdess and her lover  are engaged in other occupations than the care of the flock of sheep  visible in the distance.
