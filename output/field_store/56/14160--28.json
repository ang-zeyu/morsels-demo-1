Thou dost indeed seem so jealous of the  salvation Thou hast purchased, that Thou dost prefer the sinner to the  righteous! The poor sinner beholds himself vile and wretched, is in a  manner constrained to detest himself; and finding his state so  horrible, casts himself in his desperation into the arms of his  Saviour, and plunges into the healing fountain, and comes forth \"white  as wool.\" Then confounded at the review of his disordered state, and  overflowing with love for Him, who having alone the power, had also the  compassion to save him--the excess of his love is proportioned to the  enormity of his crimes, and the fullness of his gratitude to the extent  of the debt remitted. The self-righteous, relying on the many good  works he imagines he has performed, seems to hold salvation in his own  hand, and considers Heaven as a just reward of his merits. In the  bitterness of his zeal he exclaims against all sinners, and represents  the gates of mercy as barred against them, and Heaven as a place to  which they have no claim. What need have such self-righteous persons of  a Saviour? they are already burdened with the load of their own merits.  Oh, how long they bear the flattering load, while sinners divested of  everything, fly rapidly on the wings of faith and love into their  Saviour's arms, who freely bestows on them that which he has so freely  promised!    How full of self-love are the self-righteous, and how void of the love  of God! They esteem and admire themselves in their works of  righteousness, which they suppose to be a fountain of happiness. These  works are no sooner exposed to the Sun of Righteousness, than they  discover all to be so full of impurity and baseness, that it frets them  to the heart. Meanwhile the poor sinner, Magdalene, is pardoned because  she loves much, and her faith and love are accepted as righteousness.  The inspired Paul, who so well understood these great truths and so  fully investigated them, assures us that \"the faith of Abraham was  imputed to him for righteousness.\" This is truly beautiful for it is  certain that all of that holy patriarch's actions were strictly  righteous; yet, not seeing them as such, and being devoid of the love  of them, and divested of selfishness, his faith was founded on the  coming Christ. He hoped in Him even against hope itself, and this was  imputed to him for righteousness, (Rom. 41: 18, 22,) a pure, simple and  genuine righteousness, wrought by Christ, and not a righteousness  wrought by himself, and regarded as of himself.    You may imagine this a digression wide of the subject, but it leads  insensibly to it. It shows that God accomplishes His work either in  converted sinners, whose past iniquities serve as a counterpoise to  their elevation, or in persons whose self-righteousness He destroys, by  totally overthrowing the proud building they had reared on a sandy  foundation, instead of the Rock--CHRIST.    The establishment of all these ends, which He proposed in coming into  the world, is effected by the apparent overthrow of that very structure  which in reality He would erect. By means which seem to destroy His  Church, He establishes it. How strangely does He found the new  dispensation and give it His sanction! The legislator Himself is  condemned by the learned and great, as a malefactor, and dies an  ignominious death. Oh, that we fully understood how very opposite our  self-righteousness is to the designs of God--it would be a subject for  endless humiliation, and we should have an utter distrust in that which  at present constitutes the whole of our dependence.    From a just love of His supreme power, and a righteous jealousy of  mankind, who attribute to each other the gifts He Himself bestows upon  them, it pleased Him to take one of the most unworthy of the creation,  to make known the fact that His graces are the effects of His will, not  the fruits of our merits. It is the property of His wisdom to destroy  what is proudly built, and to build what is destroyed; to make use of  weak things to confound the mighty and to employ in His service such as  appear vile and contemptible.    This He does in a manner so astonishing, as to render them the objects  of the scorn and contempt of the world. It is not to draw public  approbation upon them, that He makes them instrumental in the salvation  of others; but to render them the objects of their dislike and the  subjects of their insults; as you will see in this life you have  enjoined upon me to write.          CHAPTER 2      I was born on April 18, 1648. My parents, particularly my father, was  extremely pious; but to him it was a manner hereditary. Many of his  forefathers were saints.    My mother, in the eighth month, was accidentally frightened, which  caused an abortion. It is generally imagined that a child born in that  month cannot survive. Indeed, I was so excessively ill, immediately  after my birth, that all about me despaired of my life, and were  apprehensive I should die without baptism. Perceiving some signs of  vitality, they ran to acquaint my father, who immediately brought a  priest; but on entering the chamber they were told those symptoms which  had raised their hopes were only expiring struggles, and all was over.    I had no sooner shown signs of life again, than I again relapsed, and  remained so long in an uncertain state, that it was some time before  they could find a proper opportunity to baptize me. I continued very  unhealthy until I was two and a half years old, when they sent me to  the convent of the Ursulines, where I remained a few months.    On my return, my mother neglected to pay due attention to my education.  She was not fond of daughters and abandoned me wholly to the care of  servants. Indeed, I should have suffered severely from their  inattention to me had not an all-watchful Providence been my protector:  for through my liveliness, I met with various accidents. I frequently  fell into a deep vault that held our firewood; however, I always  escaped unhurt.    The Dutchess of Montbason came to the convent of the Benedictines, when  I was about four years old. She had a great friendship for my father,  and obtained his permission that I should go to the same convent. She  took peculiar delight in my sportiveness and certain sweetness in my  external deportment. I became her constant companion.    I was guilty of frequent and dangerous irregularities in this house,  and committed serious faults. I had good examples before me, and being  naturally well inclined, I followed them, when there were none to turn  me aside. I loved to hear God spoken of, to be at church, and to be  dressed in a religious garb. I was told of terrors of Hell which I  imagined was intended to intimidate me as I was exceedingly lively, and  full of a little petulant vivacity which they called wit. The  succeeding night I dreamed of Hell, and though I was so young, time has  never been able to efface the frightful ideas impressed upon my  imagination. All appeared horrible darkness, where souls were punished,  and my place among them was pointed out. At this I wept bitterly, and  cried, \"Oh, my God, if Thou wilt have mercy upon me, and spare me yet a  little longer, I will never more offend Thee.\" And thou didst, O Lord,  in mercy hearken unto my cry, and pour upon me strength and courage to  serve thee, in an uncommon manner for one of my age. I wanted to go  privately to confession, but being little, the mistress of the boarders  carried me to the priest, and stayed with me while I was heard. She was  much astonished when I mentioned that I had suggestions against the  faith, and the confessor began to laugh, and inquire what they were. I  told him that till then I had doubted there was such a place as Hell,  and supposed my mistress had spoken of it merely to make me good, but  now my doubts were all removed. After confession my heart glowed with a  kind of fervor, and at one time I felt a desire to suffer martyrdom.  The good girls of the house, to amuse themselves, and to see how far  this growing fervor would carry me, desired me to prepare for  martyrdom. I found great fervency and delight in prayer, and was  persuaded that this ardor, which was as new as it was pleasing, was a  proof of God's love. This inspired me with such courage and resolution,  that I earnestly besought them to proceed, that I might thereby enter  into His sacred presence, but was there not latent hypocrisy here? Did  I not imagine that it was possible they would not kill me, and that I  would have the merit of martyrdom without suffering it? Indeed, it  appeared there was something of this nature in it. Being placed  kneeling on a cloth spread for the purpose, and seeing behind me a  large sword lifted up which they had prepared to try how far my ardor  would carry me I cried, \"Hold! it is not right I should die without  first obtaining my father's permission.\" I was quickly upbraided with  having said this that I might escape, and that I was no longer a  martyr. I continued long disconsolate, and would receive no comfort;  something inwardly reproved me, for not having embraced that  opportunity of going to Heaven, when it rested altogether on my own  choice.    At my solicitation, and on account of my falling so frequently sick, I  was at length taken home. On my return, my mother having a maid in whom  she placed confidence, left me again to the care of servants. It is a  great fault, of which mothers are guilty, when under pretext of  external devotions, or other engagements, they suffer their daughters  to be absent from them. I forbear not condemning that unjust partiality  with which parents treat some of their children. It is frequently  productive of divisions in families, and even the ruin of some.  Impartiality, by uniting children's hearts together, lays the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22282"],[0,"Uncle Remus and Brer Rabbit (#2)"],[1,"an' some  a big word dat it aint wuff while ter ermember, but I wanter move in.

It sent a brisk gale before it, as  if to clear the path of leaves and dust. Presently there was a blinding  flash of lightning, a snap and a crash, and, with that, the child took  to his heels, and ran to Uncle Remus, who was standing in his door. \"Dar  now!\" he exclaimed, before the echoes of the thunder had rolled away,  \"Dat dust an' win', an' rain, puts me in mind er de time when ol' Brer  Rabbit got up a big race fer ter pleasure de yuther creeturs.
