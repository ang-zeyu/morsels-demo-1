Where'll I put your plunder, mister?\" He  was already loosing Croaker's pack. \"You be stayin' over to th' Jacks?\"    Drew glanced up at the haymow from which Callie had just descended. \"Any  reason why I can't bunk up there?\" he asked Kells.    \"None 'tall, Kirby, none 'tall. Know you want to be handy like. Stow that  there gear up above, Callie, an' don't you drop nothin'. Rest yourself  easy, son. These here hosses is goin' to be treated jus' like th' good  stuff they is.\"    \"Croaker, also.\" Drew stopped by the mule, patted the long nose, gave a  flip to the limp ear. \"He's good stuff, too--served in the cavalry....\"    Kells studied the young man by the mule. Cavalry saddle on the stud, two  Colt pistols belted high and butt forward, and that military cord on his  hat--army boots, too. The liveryman knew the signs. This was not the first  veteran to drift into Tubacca; he wouldn't be the last either. Seems like  half of both them armies back east didn't want to go home an' sit down  peaceful like now that they was through wi' shootin' at each other. No,  siree, a right big herd o' 'em was trailin' out here. An' he thought he  could put name to the color of coat this young'un had had on his back,  too. Only askin' more than a man volunteered to tell, that warn't neither  manners nor wise.    \"He gits th' best, too, Kirby.\" Kells shifted a well-chewed tobacco cud  from one cheek to the other.    He could trust Kells, Drew thought. A little of his concern over Shadow  eased. He shouldered the saddlebags and made his way back down the alley,  beginning to see the merit in the liveryman's suggestions. Food--and a  bath! What he wouldn't give for a bath! Hay to sleep on was fine; he had  had far worse beds during the past four years. But a hot bath to be  followed by a meal which was not the jerky, corn meal, bitter coffee of  trail cooking! His pace quickened into a trot but slackened again as he  neared the Four Jacks and remembered all the precautions he must take in  Tubacca.    In the big room of the cantina oil lamps made yellow pools of light. The  man in the painted vest was seated at a table laying out cards in a  complicated pattern of a solitaire game. And at one side a round-faced  Mexican in ornate, south-of-the-border clothing held a guitar across one  plump knee, now and then plucking absent-mindedly at a single string as he  stared raptly into space. A third man stood behind the bar polishing thick  glasses.    \"Greetings!\" As Drew stood blinking just within the doorway the card  player rose. He was a tall, wide-shouldered man, a little too thin for his  height. Deep lines in his clean-shaven face bracketed his wide mouth. His  curly hair was a silvery blond, and he had dark, deeply set eyes. \"I'm  Reese Topham, owner of this oasis,\" he introduced himself.    \"Drew Kirby.\" He must remember that always--he was Drew Kirby, a Texan  schooled with kinfolk in Kentucky, who served in the war under Forrest and  was now drifting west, as were countless other rootless Confederate  veterans. Actually the story was close enough to the truth. And he had had  months on the trail from San Antonio to Santa Fe, then on to Tucson, to  study up on any small invented details. He was Drew Kirby, Texan, not Drew  Rennie of Red Springs, Kentucky.    \"For a man just off the trail, Kirby, the Four Jacks does have a few of  the delights of civilization. A bath....\" One of Topham's dark eyebrows,  so in contrast to his silvery hair, slid up inquiringly, and he grinned at  Drew's involuntary but emphatic nod. \"One of nature's gifts to our fair  city is the hot spring. Hamilcar!\" His hand met table top in a sharp slap.  The Mexican jerked fully awake and looked around. From the back of the  cantina emerged a middle-aged Negro.    \"Yes, Mistuh Reese, suh?\"    \"Customer for you, Hamilcar. I would judge he wants the full treatment.  This, Mister Kirby, is the best barber, valet, and general aid to comfort  in town, the sultan of our bath. Hamilcar, Mister Kirby would like to  remove the layers of dust he has managed to pick up. Good luck to you  both!\"    Drew found himself laughing as he followed Hamilcar to the rear of the  building.    Topham had reason to be proud of his bath, Drew admitted some time later.  A natural hot spring might be the base of the luxury, but man's labor had  piped the water into stone-slab tubs and provided soap and towels. To sit  and soak was a delight he had forgotten. He shampooed his unkempt head  vigorously and allowed himself to forget all worries, wallowing in the  sheer joy of being really clean again.    Hamilcar had produced a clean shirt and drawers from the saddlebags, even  managing to work up a shadow of shine on the scuffed cavalry boots, and  had beat the worst of the trail dust from the rest of the traveler's  clothing. Drew had re-dressed except for his gun belt when he heard a  voice call from the next cubicle.    \"Ham--Ham! You git yourself in here, 'fore I skin that black hide--\"    \"Johnny!\" Topham's voice cut through the other's thickened slur. \"You soak  that rot-gut out of you, and mind your tongue while you do it!\"    \"Sure, sure, Reese--\" The voice was pitched lower this time, but to Drew  the tone was more mocking than conciliatory. Drunk or sober, that stranger  did not hold very kindly thoughts of Topham. But that was none of the  Kentuckian's business.    \"Yore hat, suh.\" Hamilcar brought in the well-brushed headgear, much more  respectable looking than it had been an hour ago. The cord on it  glistened. Army issue--brave gold bullion--made for a general's wearing.  Drew straightened it, remembering....    Sergeant Rennie of the Scouts, in from an independent foray into  enemy-held Tennessee, reporting to the Old Man himself--General Bedford  Forrest. And Forrest saying:    \"We don't give medals, Sergeant. But I think a good soldier might just be  granted a birthday present without any one gittin' too excited about how  military that is.\" Then he had jerked the cord off his own hat and given  it to Drew. It was something big to remember when you were only nineteen  and had been soldiering three years, three years with a dogged army that  refused to be beaten. That hat cord, the spurs on his boots, they were all  he had brought home from war--save a tough body and a mind he hoped was as  hard.    \"Mighty pretty hat trimmin', that, suh,\" Hamilcar admired.    \"Mighty big man wore it once.\" Drew was still half in the past. \"What do I  owe you more'n the thanks of a mighty tired man you've turned out brand  new again?\" He smiled and was suddenly all boy.    \"Foah bits, suh. An' it was a pleasure to do fo' a gentleman. It truly  was. Come agin, suh--come, agin!\"    Drew went down the corridor, his spurs answering with a chiming ring each  time his heels met planking. Worn at Chapultepec by a Mexican officer,  they had been claimed as spoils of war in '47 by a Texas Ranger. And in  '61 the Ranger's son, Anson Kirby, had jingled off in them to another war.  Then Kirby had disappeared during that last scout in Tennessee, vanishing  into nowhere when he fell wounded from the saddle, smashing into a  bushwhackers' hideout.    On a Sunday in May of '65, back in Gainesville, when Forrest's men had  finally accepted surrender and the deadness of defeat, a Union trooper had  worn those spurs into church. And Boyd Barrett had sold his horse the same  day to buy back those silver bits because he knew what they meant to his  cousin Drew. Now here Drew was, half the continent away from Gainesville  and Tennessee, wearing Anse's spurs and half of Anse's name--to find a  father he had not known was still alive, until last year.    The Kentuckian was sure of only one thing right now, he was not going to  enter a town or a stretch of country where Hunt Rennie was _the_ big man,  and claim to be Rennie's unknown son. Maybe later he could come to a  decision about his action. But first he wanted to be sure. There might  well be no place for a Drew Rennie in Hunt Rennie's present life. They  were total strangers and perhaps it must be left that way.    There was no reason for him to claim the kinship. He was independent. Drew  Kirby had a mule and two good horses, maybe three by tomorrow. Aunt  Marianna had insisted that he accept part of the Mattock estate, even  though his Kentucky grandfather had left him penniless. He'd made his  choice without hesitation: the colt Shiloh, the mare Shadow, and she bred  to Storm Cloud for what should be a prize foal. His aunt had made him take  more--gold in his money belt, enough to give him a start in the west. He  was his own man, not Rennie's son, unless he chose....    Two more lamps had been lighted in the cantina. Drew sat down at a table.  There was a swish of full skirts, and he looked up at a girl. She smiled  as if she liked what she saw of this brown-faced stranger with quiet,  disciplined features and eyes older than his years.    \"You like, _senor_ ... tequila ... whiskee ... food?\"    \"Food, _senorita_. You see a most hungry man.\"    She laughed and then frowned anxiously. \"Ah, but, _senor_, this is a time  when the cupboard is, as you would say, bare! When the wagons come--then  what a difference! Now, tortillas, frijoles, maybe some fruit ... sweet  for the tongue, like wine in the throat. Perhaps an egg--\"    \"To me that is a feast.\" Drew fell into the formal speech which seemed  natural here. \"You see one who has done his own trail cooking too long.\"    \"Ah--_el pobrete_--poor man! Surely there will be an egg!\" She was gone and  Drew began covertly to study the other men in the room.    In any western town the cantina, or saloon, was the meeting place for  masculine society. Even if Hunt Rennie did not appear bodily in the Four  Jacks tonight, Drew could pick up information about his father merely by  keeping open ears. As far away as Santa Fe he had heard of Rennie's Range  and _Don_ Cazar (the name the Mexicans had"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20842"],[0,"Dreams (#2)"],[1,"   a vague fringe around the distinct recollections. It would not be       at all surprising if perceptions of the organs of our senses,       useful perceptions, were the result of a selection or of a       canalization worked by the organs of our senses in the interest of       our action, but that there should yet be around those perceptions a       fringe of vague perceptions, capable of becoming more distinct in       extraordinary, abnormal cases. Those would be precisely the cases       with which psychical research would deal.      This conception of mental action forms, as will be seen, the foundation  of the theory of dreams which Professor Bergson first presented in a  lecture before the _Institut psychologique_, March 26, 1901. It was  published in the _Revue scientifique_ of June 8, 1901. An English  translation, revised by the author and printed in _The Independent_ of  October 23 and 30, 1913, here appears for the first time in book form.    In this essay Professor Bergson made several contributions to our  knowledge of dreams. He showed, in the first place, that dreaming is not  so unlike the ordinary process of perception as had been hitherto  supposed. Both use sense impressions as crude material to be molded and  defined by the aid of memory images. Here, too, he set forth the idea,  which he, so far as I know, was the first to formulate, that sleep is a  state of disinterestedness, a theory which has since been adopted by  several psychologists. In this address, also, was brought into  consideration for the first time the idea that the self may go through  different degrees of tension--a theory referred to in his _Matter and  Memory_.    Its chief interest for the general reader will, however, lie in the  explanation it gives him of the cause of some of his familiar dreams. He  may by practice become the interpreter of his own visions and so come to  an understanding of the vagaries of that mysterious and inseparable  companion, his dream-self.                                                  EDWIN E. SLOSSON.      NEW YORK CITY,    FEBRUARY 10, 1914.          DREAMS      The subject which I have to discuss here is so complex, it raises so  many questions of all kinds, difficult, obscure, some psychological,  others physiological and metaphysical; in order to be treated in a  complete manner it requires such a long development--and we have so  little space, that I shall ask your permission to dispense with all  preamble, to set aside unessentials, and to go at once to the heart of  the question.    A dream is this. I perceive objects and there is nothing there. I see  men; I seem to speak to them and I hear what they answer; there is no  one there and I have not spoken. It is all _as if_ real things and real  persons were there, then on waking all has disappeared, both persons and  things. How does this happen?    But, first, is it true that there is nothing there? I mean, is there not  presented a certain sense material to our eyes, to our ears, to our  touch, etc., during sleep as well as during waking?    Close the eyes and look attentively at what goes on in the field of our  vision. Many persons questioned on this point would say that nothing  goes on, that they see nothing. No wonder at this, for a certain amount  of practise is necessary to be able to observe oneself satisfactorily.  But just give the requisite effort of attention, and you will  distinguish, little by little, many things. First, in general, a black  background. Upon this black background occasionally brilliant points  which come and go, rising and descending, slowly and sedately. More  often, spots of many colors, sometimes very dull, sometimes, on the  contrary, with certain people, so brilliant that reality cannot compare  with it. These spots spread and shrink, changing form and color,  constantly displacing one another. Sometimes the change is slow and  gradual, sometimes again it is a whirlwind of vertiginous rapidity.  Whence comes all this phantasmagoria? The physiologists and the  psychologists have studied this play of colors. \"Ocular spectra,\"  \"colored spots,\" \"phosphenes,\" such are the names that they have given  to the phenomenon. They explain it either by the slight modifications  which occur ceaselessly in the retinal circulation, or by the pressure  that the closed lid exerts upon the eyeball, causing a mechanical  excitation of the optic nerve. But the explanation of the phenomenon and  the name that is given to it matters little. It occurs universally and  it constitutes--I may say at once--the principal material of which we  shape our dreams, \"such stuff as dreams are made on.\"    Thirty or forty years ago, M. Alfred Maury and, about the same time, M.  d'Hervey, of St. Denis, had observed that at the moment of falling  asleep these colored spots and moving forms consolidate, fix themselves,  take on definite outlines, the outlines of the objects and of the  persons which people our dreams. But this is an observation to be  accepted with caution, since it emanates from psychologists already half  asleep. More recently an American psychologist, Professor Ladd, of  Yale, has devised a more rigorous method, but of difficult application,  because it requires a sort of training. It consists in acquiring the  habit on awakening in the morning of keeping the eyes closed and  retaining for some minutes the dream that is fading from the field of  vision and soon would doubtless have faded from that of memory. Then one  sees the figures and objects of the dream melt away little by little  into phosphenes, identifying themselves with the colored spots that the  eye really perceives when the lids are closed. One reads, for example, a  newspaper; that is the dream. One awakens and there remains of the  newspaper, whose definite outlines are erased, only a white spot with  black marks here and there; that is the reality. Or our dream takes us  upon the open sea--round about us the ocean spreads its waves of  yellowish gray with here and there a crown of white foam. On awakening,  it is all lost in a great spot, half yellow and half gray, sown with  brilliant points. The spot was there, the brilliant points were there.  There was really presented to our perceptions, in sleep, a visual dust,  and it was this dust which served for the fabrication of our dreams.    Will this alone suffice? Still considering the sensation of sight, we  ought to add to these visual sensations which we may call internal all  those which continue to come to us from an external source. The eyes,  when closed, still distinguish light from shade, and even, to a certain  extent, different lights from one another. These sensations of light,  emanating from without, are at the bottom of many of our dreams. A  candle abruptly lighted in the room will, for example, suggest to the  sleeper, if his slumber is not too deep, a dream dominated by the image  of fire, the idea of a burning building. Permit me to cite to you two  observations of M. Tissie on this subject:    \"B---- Leon dreams that the theater of Alexandria is on _fire_; the  flame lights up the whole place. All of a sudden he finds himself  transported to the midst of the fountain in the public square; a line  of _fire_ runs along the chains which connect the great posts placed  around the margin. Then he finds himself in Paris at the exposition,  which is on _fire_. He takes part in terrible scenes, etc. He wakes with  a start; his eyes catch the rays of light projected by the dark lantern  which the night nurse flashes toward his bed in passing. M---- Bertrand  dreams that he is in the marine infantry where he formerly served. He  goes to Fort-de-France, to Toulon, to Loriet, to Crimea, to  Constantinople. He sees lightning, he hears thunder, he takes part in a  combat in which he sees _fire_ leap from the mouths of cannon. He wakes  with a start. Like B., he was wakened by a flash of light projected from  the dark lantern of the night nurse.\" Such are often the dreams provoked  by a bright and sudden light.    Very different are those which are suggested by a mild and continuous  light like that of the moon. A. Krauss tells how one day on awakening he  perceived that he was extending his arm toward what in his dream  appeared to him to be the image of a young girl. Little by little this  image melted into that of the full moon which darted its rays upon him.  It is a curious thing that one might cite other examples of dreams where  the rays of the moon, caressing the eyes of the sleeper, evoked before  him virginal apparitions. May we not suppose that such might have been  the origin in antiquity of the fable of Endymion--Endymion the shepherd,  lapped in perpetual slumber, for whom the goddess Selene, that is, the  moon, is smitten with love while he sleeps?    I have spoken of visual sensations. They are the principal ones. But the  auditory sensations nevertheless play a role. First, the ear has also  its internal sensations, sensations of buzzing, of tinkling, of  whistling, difficult to isolate and to perceive while awake, but which  are clearly distinguished in sleep. Besides that we continue, when once  asleep, to hear external sounds. The creaking of furniture, the  crackling of the fire, the rain beating against the window, the wind  playing its chromatic scale in the chimney, such are the sounds which  come to the ear of the sleeper and which the dream converts, according  to circumstances, into conversation, singing, cries, music, etc.  Scissors were struck against the tongs in the ears of Alfred Maury while  he slept. Immediately he dreamt that he heard the tocsin and took part  in the events of June, 1848. Such observations and experiences are  numerous. But let us hasten to say that sounds do not play in our dreams  so important a role as colors. Our dreams are, above all, visual, and  even more visual than we think.
