[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23666"],[0,"Mission Furniture: How to Make It, Part 3 (#2)"],[1,"labor can be saved by ordering the material ready cut to length,  squared and sanded. Quarter-sawed oak should be used and the material  needed will be as follows:    [Illustration: Dresser Made of Quarter-Sawed Oak]      4 posts, 1-3/4 by 1-3/4 by 27 in., S-4-S.    1 top board, 3/4 by 17 by 37 in., S-2-S.    5 side rails, 3/4 by 1-1/2 by 37-1/2 in., S-4-S.    4 end rails, 3/4 by 2 by 17-1/2 in., S-4-S.    2 end panels, 1/4 by 16-1/4 by 16-3/4 in., S-4-S.    1 drawer partition, 1 by 7-3/4 by 18-1/2 in., S-4-S.    1 back board, 3/4 by 4-1/2 by 36 in., S-2-S.    2 mirror supports, 7/8 by 2-1/2 by 30 in., S-4-S.    2 side pieces for mirror, 3/4 by 2 by 42 in., S-4-S.    2 end pieces for mirror, 3/4 by 2 by 21-1/2 in., S-4-S.    2 drawer fronts, 3/4 by 7 by 17-1/2 in., S-4-S.    1 drawer front, 3/4 by 7 by 36 in., S-4-S.    1 20 by 38 bevel mirror.    The following pieces may be of any soft wood:      5 drawer slides, 3/4 by 2 by 17 in.    6 drawer sides, 1/2 by 7 by 17 in.    2 drawer bottoms, 1/2 by 17 by 17 in.    1 drawer bottom, 1/2 by 17 by 35-1/2 in.    4-1/2 sq. ft. of 3/8-in. pine for back.    First be sure the posts are perfectly square and of equal length. Either  chamfer or round the upper ends as desired. The mortises can now be laid  out and cut or they can be left until the rail tenons are all made and  then marked and cut directly from each tenon. The posts as well as the  end rails should have grooves cut in them to take the 1/4-in. end  panels.    The top board should have the corners cut to fit about the posts. The  corners of the back board should be rounded as shown in the drawing.    The end sections of the dresser can be glued together first, care being  taken to get the joints square and tight. When these are dry the side  rails and drawer slides can be fitted and glued in place. The top board  is held in position by means of screws through cleats which are fastened  to the inner sides of the rails.    [Illustration: Detail of the Princess Dresser]    The mirror frame is made by mortising the end pieces with the side  pieces as shown. It is rabbeted on the back to hold a 20 by 38-in.  mirror. After the mirror is securely fastened in the frame a thin wood  covering should be tacked on the back to protect the glass. The frame  swings between two upright posts which are securely fastened to the  body of the dresser as shown.    The drawers are made and fitted in the usual manner. The drawing shows  two drawers in the top compartment, but one exactly like the lower can  be made and used instead by simply leaving out the 1 in. partition.  Suitable handles for the drawers can be purchased at any hardware store.    The back is made of soft wood and is put on in the usual manner. Scrape  all surplus glue from about the joints as the stain will not take where  there is any glue. Finish smooth with fine sandpaper and apply the stain  desired, which may be any of the many mission stains supplied by the  trade for this purpose.          A SEWING BOX      A rather unique sewing box, and one that is quite as convenient as  unique, is shown in the illustration. The material is walnut and ash.  The posts are walnut and the slats and top rail ash. Both are finished  in their natural colors. The following is the stock bill:       4 posts, 1-1/2 in. in diameter and 15 in. long, walnut.     1 bottom, 3/8 by 16-1/2 by 16-1/2 in., S-2-S, walnut.     4 top rails, 3/8 by 1-1/2 by 20 in., S-2-S, ash.     4 under rails, 5/8 by 3/4 by 20 in., S-2-S, walnut.    72 slats, 1/8 by 5/8 by 6-1/2 in., S-2-S, ash.    In ordering the stock it will be wise to combine the lengths of pieces  having like widths and thicknesses.    If not possible to secure doweling of the diameter indicated for the  verticals, it is an easy matter to take a square piece of stock, lay it  off and work it into an eight-sided prism. After this, the arrises may  again be planed until it has 16 and then 32 sides. The rest may be  removed with sandpaper. Or it is possible that curtain pole stock will  be available. Saw these posts to length and leave the ends square.    [Illustration: Sewing Box Made of Walnut and Ash]    Square up the stock for the other parts. Work the bottom piece to a  16-in. square. The rails are not to be squared on the ends but are to be  mitered each in turn. The bottom is fastened to the posts by metal  brackets.    [Illustration: Detail of the Sewing Box]    Chisel out recesses in the posts so that the bottom may be inserted.  Insert the corners and use glue and nails to hold them in place. Place  the lower of the two top rails, notching out the posts as is necessary  to bring the inner edge of these rails in position. Fasten to the posts.  Miter and place the top rails. The slats, it will be noted, are fastened  to the bottom from the outer side and to the lower of the two top rails  from the inner side. Brass-headed tacks such as upholsterers use are  required.    In finishing, sandpaper all parts and then apply a coat of boiled  linseed oil. Allow this to stand a half hour or so and then wipe the  surface clean. After this has dried thoroughly apply a thin coating of  shellac and allow it to harden. Sand the shellac when hard with No. 00  sandpaper and then apply several coats of wax, polishing in the usual  manner.    Two pairs of castors will add to the ease with which the box may be  moved about.          A FERN STAND      When making the fern stand shown in the accompanying sketch use  quarter-sawed oak if possible, as this wood is the most suitable for  finishing in the different mission stains. Considerable labor can be  saved in its construction by ordering the stock from the mill ready cut  to length, squared and sanded. Order the following pieces:       4 posts, 1-1/2 by 1-1/2 by 30 in., S-4-S.     8 side rails, 3/4 by 1-1/2 by 13-1/2 in., S-4-S.     2 shelf supports, 3/4 by 1 by 13-1/2 in., S-4-S.     1 top, 3/4 by 16 by 16 in., S-4-S.     1 shelf, 3/4 by 15 by 15 in., S-4-S.    16 slats, 3/8 by 3 by 5 in., S-4-S.    The legs are made first. Be sure they are square and of equal length.  The mortises can be laid out and cut or they can be left until the  tenons on the side rails are all made, then marked and cut from each  tenon. The top rails and the slats are exactly alike for the four sides,  as the table is square. In addition to the tenons on the rails, grooves  should be cut in each for the ends of the slats to fit into as shown in  the cross section in the detail drawing. Holes should be cut in the  slats as shown.    [Illustration: Detail of the Fern Stand]    The top board should have the corners cut out to fit around the posts.  It is held in place by means of screws through cleats which are fastened  to the inner sides of the top rails.    The bottom board or shelf rests upon two rails that are mortised into  the posts as shown. The top and bottom boards should be of one piece if  possible, otherwise two or more boards will have to be glued together.    Before gluing up the joints see that all the pieces fit together square  and tight. The posts and rails should be glued and assembled, then the  top and bottom boards put in place to hold the frame square when the  clamps are put on.    [Illustration: Finished Stand in Quartered Oak]    Leave to dry for about 24 hours before removing the clamps. Fasten the  top and bottom boards in place and then go over the stand with fine  sandpaper and remove all surplus glue and rough spots.          A WARDROBE      The wardrobe or clothes closet shown in the accompanying sketch and  detail drawing will be found a great convenience in a bedroom where  closet space is limited or where there is no closet at all. It provides  ample room for hanging suits, dresses and other wearing apparel, as well  as space for boots and shoes. It can be made of any of the several  furniture woods in common use, but quarter-sawed oak will be found to  give the most pleasing effect. The stock should be ordered from the mill  ready cut to length, squared and sanded. In this way much labor will be  saved. The following pieces will be needed:      4 posts, 1-3/4 by 1-3/4 by 64-1/2 in., S-4-S.    2 front rails, 3/4 by 1-1/2 by 37-1/2 in., S-4-S.    1 top and 1 bottom board, each 3/4 by 18-1/2 by 37 in., S-4-S.    1 top back rail, 3/4 by 4-1/4 by 37-1/2 in., S-4-S.    1 lower back rail, 3/4 by 4 by 37-1/2 in., S-4-S.    6 end rails, 3/4 by 6 by 18-1/2 in., S-4-S.    4 end uprights, 3/4 by 4 by 22-1/2 in., S-4-S.    8 end panels, 3/8 by 7-1/2 by 22-1/2 in., S-4-S.    5 shelves, 3/4 by 17-3/4 by 19-1/2 in., S-4-S.    2 drawer fronts, 3/4 by 4-3/4 by 8-1/2 in., S-4-S.    1 door, 3/4 by 7-3/4 by 10 in., S-4-S.    1 shelf partition, 3/4 by 10 by 19 in., S-4-S.    2 drawer fronts, 3/4 by 7 by 17 in., S-4-S.    1 drawer front, 3/4 by 8 by 17 in., S-4-S.    1 partition (several pieces), 3/4 by 19-1/2 by 57-3/4 in., S-4-S.    4 door uprights, 3/4 by 2-1/2 by 57 in., S-4-S.    2 top rails, 3/4 by 3-1/2 by 14-1/2 in., S-4-S.    2 middle rails, 3/4 by 6 by 14-1/2 in., S-4-S.    2 lower rails, 3/4 by 4-1/2 by 14-1/2 in., S-4-S.    4 center uprights, 3/4 by 2-1/2 by 23 in., S-4-S.    8 panels, 3/8 by 6 by 22-1/2 in., S-4-S.    4 pieces, 3/8 by 4-3/4 by 19 in., soft wood.    2 pieces, 3/8 by 8 by 19 in., soft wood.    2 pieces, 3/8 by 4-1/4 by 8 in., soft wood.    4 pieces, 1/2 by 7 by 19 in., soft wood.    3 pieces, 1/2 by 16-1/2 by 19 in., soft wood.    2 pieces, 1/2 by 6-1/2 by 16-1/2 in., soft wood.    2 pieces, 1/2 by 8 by 19 in., soft wood.    1 piece, 1/2 by 7-1/2 by 16-1/2 in., soft wood.    1 back (several pieces), 3/8 by 36 by 58 in., S-2-S.    [Illustration: The Wardrobe Complete]    First be sure the posts are perfectly square and of equal length. The  upper ends can be chamfered or rounded if desired. The two front posts  are alike, as are the back ones. The mortises should be laid out in each  pair of posts and then cut with a sharp chisel, or they can be left  until the tenons are all"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23667"],[0,"Woodland Tales (#2)"],[1,"Tail                                   163       68.

Mater Cara! I have never seen you, but I hungered so to know  you that I understood it when you came, unseen, and silently whispered  to me that first time in the long ago.    I cannot tell the children what you look like, Mother Carey, for mortal  eye hath never rested on your face; and yet I can offer them a portrait,  O strong Angel of the Wild Things, neither young nor old--Oh! loving One  that neither trembles nor relents!           *       *       *       *       *    A mink he was, a young mink and foolish. One of a happy brood, who were  seeing the world with their mother--a first glimpse of it. She was  anxious and leading, happy and proud, warning, sniffing, inviting,  loving, yet angersome at trivial disobedience, doling out her wisdom in  nips and examples and shrill warnings that all heeded; except this one,  the clever fool of the family, the self-satisfied smart one. He would  not be warned, the thing smelt so good. He plunged ahead. Mother was a  fool; he was wiser than Mother. Here was a merry feasting for him. Then  _clank_! The iron jaws of a trap sprang from the hiding grass, and  clutched on his soft young paws. Screams of pain, futile strainings,  writhings, ragings and moanings; bloody jaws on the trap; the mother  distraught with grief, eager to take all the punishment herself, but  helpless and stunned, unable to leave; the little brothers, aghast at  this first touch of passion, this glimpse of reality, skurrying, scared,  going and coming, mesmerized, with glowing eyes and bristling  shoulder-fur. And the mother, mad with sorrow, goaded by the screaming,  green-eyed, vacant-minded, despairing--till a new spirit entered into  her, the spirit of Cara the All-mother, Mother Carey the Beneficent,  Mother Carey the wise Straightwalker. Then the mother mink, inspired,  sprang on her suffering baby. With all the power of her limbs she sprang  and clutched; with all the power of her love she craunched. His screams  were ended; his days in the land were ended. He had not heeded her  wisdom; the family fool was finished. The race was better, better for  the suffering fool mink; better for the suffering mother mink.    The spirit left her; left her limp and broken-hearted. And away on the  wind went riding, grimly riding her empire.    Four swift steeds for riding, has she, the White Wind, the West Wind,  the Wet Wind and the Waking Wind. But mostly she rides the swift West  Wind.    She is strong, is Mother Carey, strong, wise, inexorable, calm and  direct as an iceberg. And beneficent; but she loves the strong ones  best. She ever favours the wise ones. She is building, ceaselessly  building. The good brick she sets in a place of honour, and the poor one  she grinds into gravel for the workmen to walk on.    She loves you, but far less than she does your race. It may be that you  are not wise, and if it seem best, she will drop a tear and crush you  into the dust.    Three others there be of power, like Mother Carey: Maka Ina who is  Mother Earth; El Sol, the Sun in the Sky, and Diablo the Evil Spirit of  Disease and Dread. But over all is the One Great Spirit, the Beginning  and the Ruler with these and many messengers, who do His bidding. But  mostly you shall hear of Mother Carey.    It is long ago since first I heard her whisper, and though I hear better  now than then, I have no happier memory than that earliest message.    \"Ho Wayseeker,\" she called, \"I have watched your struggle to find the  pathway, and I know that you will love the things that belong to it.  Therefore, I will show you the trail, and this is what it will lead you  to: a thousand pleasant friendships that will offer honey in little  thorny cups, the twelve secrets of the underbrush, the health of  sunlight, suppleness of body, the unafraidness of the night, the delight  of deep water, the goodness of rain, the story of the trail, the  knowledge of the swamp, the aloofness of knowing,--yea, more, a crown  and a little kingdom measured to your power and all your own.    \"But there is a condition attached. When you have found a trail you are  thereby ordained a guide. When you have won a kingdom you must give it  to the world or lose it. For those who have got power must with it bear  responsibility; evade the one, the other fades away.\"    This is the pledge I am trying to keep; I want to be your Guide. I am  offering you my little kingdom.          THINGS TO SEE IN SPRINGTIME    [Illustration: Blue-eyes the Snow Child]          Things to See in Springtime      TALE 1    Blue-eyes, the Snow Child, or The Story of Hepatica    Have you ever seen El Sol, the Chief of the Wonder-workers, brother to  Mother Carey? Yes, you have, though probably you did not know it; at  least you could not look him in the face. Well, I am going to tell you  about him, and tell of a sad thing that happened to him, and to some one  whom he loved more than words can tell.    Tall and of blazing beauty was El Sol, the King of the Wonder-workers;  his hair was like shining gold, and stood straight out a yard from his  head, as he marched over the hilltops.    Everyone loved him, except a very few, who once had dared to fight him,  and had been worsted. Everyone else loved him, and he liked everybody,  without really loving them. Until one day, as he walked in his garden,  he suddenly came on a beautiful white maiden, whom he had never seen  before. Her eyes were of the loveliest blue, her hair was so soft that  it floated on the air, and her robe was white, covered with ferns done  in white lace.    He fell deeply in love with her at once, but she waved a warning hand,  when he tried to come near.    \"Who are you, oh radiant princess? I love you even before I hear you  speak.\"    \"I am Snowroba, the daughter of the great King Jackfrost,\" she said.    \"I love you as I never loved any one. Will you marry me? I am the King  of the Wonder-workers. I will make you the Queen.\"    \"No,\" said she, \"I cannot marry you, for it is written that if one of my  people marry one of your people, she will sink down and die in a day.\"    Then El Sol was very sad. But he said, \"May I not see you again?\"    \"Yes,\" she answered, \"I will meet you here in the morning, for it is  pleasant to look on your beauty,\" and her voice tinkled sweetly.    So she met him in the morning, and again on the third morning. He loved  her madly now, and though she held back, he seized her in his arms and  kissed her tenderly.    Then her arms fell weakly to her sides, and her eyes half closed as she  said: \"I know now that the old writing spake truth. I love you, I love  you, my love; but you have killed me.\""]]]
