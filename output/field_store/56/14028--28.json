Jackson).]    The tent was commonly made of ten or a dozen dressed or tanned buffalo  skins. It was in the shape of a sugar loaf, and was from 10 to 12 feet  high, 10 or 15 feet in diameter at the bottom, and about a foot and a  half in diameter at the top, which served as a smokehole  ([t]ihu[k]a^{n}). Besides the interior tent poles ([t]ici--3,  figure 309) and the tent skin ([t]iha--1), the tent had the  [t]i[|c]uma^{n}ha^{n}, or the place where the skins were fastened  together above the entrance (4). The [t]i[|c]uma^{n}ha^{n} was fastened  with the [t]ihu[|c]ubaxa^{n}(5), which consisted of sticks or pieces of  hide thrust crosswise through the holes in the tent skins. The bottom of  the tent was secured to the ground by pins ([t]ihu[|c]ugada^{n}--6)  driven through holes ([t]ihugaq[|c]uge) in the bottom of the skins, made  when the latter were tanned and before they had become hard. The  entrance ([t]ijebe) was generally opposite the quarter from which the  wind was blowing. A door flap ([t]ijebeg[|c]a^{n}--7) hung over the  entrance; it was made of skin with the hair outside, so as to turn  water, and was held taut by a stick fastened to it transversely. The  bottom of the door flap was loose, but the top was fastened to the tent.    [Illustration: Fig. 309--Exterior parts of an Omaha tent.]    The smokehole was formed by the two [t]ihugab[|c]i^{n}[|c]a(9), or  triangular ends of tent skins, immediately above the entrance and  [t]icuma^{n}ha^{n}. When there was no wind both of the  [t]ihugab[|c]i^{n}[|c]a were kept open by means of the  [t]ihu[|c]ubaji^{n}(8) or exterior tent poles, which were thrust  through the ujiha, or small sacks, in the corners of the  [t]ihugab[|c]i^{n}[|c]a. When the wind blew one of the  [t]ihu[|c]ubaji^{n} was raised to the windward and the other was  lowered, pulling its skin close to the tent and leaving an opening for  the escape of the smoke; but if the wind came directly against the  entrance both the flaps were raised, closing the smokehole to prevent  the wind from blowing down it. When the wind blew the people used  nandi[|c]agaspe to keep the bottom of each tent skin in place. These  consisted of twisted grass, sticks, stones, or other heavy objects.    Figure 310 represents the tent of [P]ejequde, an Omaha. The banners or  standards, which were carried by the leaders of a war party or a party  going on a dancing tour, are depicted with their decorations of strips  of red and blue Indian cloth. Sometimes these standards were ornamented  with feathers instead of with cloth. Each standard could be used in four  war expeditions.    No totem posts were in use among the Omaha. The tent of the principal  man of each gens was decorated on the outside with his gentile badge,  which was painted on each side of the entrance as well as on the back of  the tent.[1] The furniture of the sacred tents resembled that of the  ordinary ones.    Before the introduction of canvas tents by the whites no needles or  thread were used by the Siouan tribes. The women used sinew of the deer  or buffalo instead of thread, and for needles they had awls made of elk  horn.    [Illustration: Fig. 310.--[P]ejequde's tent.]    Since there were no outbuildings, public granaries, or other structures  of this description, each household stored away its own grain and other  provisions. There were no special tribal or communal dwellings; but  sometimes two or more households occupied a single earth lodge. When a  council was held, it took place in the earth lodge of one of the head  chiefs, or else two or three common tents were united, making one large  one.[2] There were no public baths, as the Missouri river was near, and  they could resort to it whenever they desired. Dance houses were  improvised either of earth lodges or skin tents.    Sweat-lodges were in the form of low tents ([t]iu[|c]ipu).[3] Stones  were not boiled for the sweat-lodge, but were put into the fire to be  heated. They were removed from the fire by means of sticks called  i^{n}[,][)e]basi[|c]a^{n}, and then water from the kettle was poured on  them, creating steam. Cedar fronds were dropped on the stones, causing a  perfume to arise.    [Footnote 1: Third Ann. Rep. Bur. Ethnology for 1882-'83, p. 230; also  \"A Study of Siouan Cults,\" in Eleventh Ann. Rep. Bur. Ethnology,  1889-'90, p. 351.]    [Footnote 2: Third Ann. Rep., op. cit., p. 294.]    [Footnote 3: Contributions to North American Ethnology, vol. vi, 1890,  pp. 152, 169, and 234.]          FURNITURE AND IMPLEMENTS.      Fireplaces.    Within the tent, in the center, was the fireplace (une[|c][)e]), formed  by excavating a small hollow. Beside this was erected a forked post  (isag[|c][)e]), on which was hung the apparatus for suspending a kettle  over the fire. This apparatus was called [|c]exe u[|c]ugacke by the  Ponka, literally, \"that by means of which the kettle is hung.\" The Omaha  have two names for it, uha^{n} u[|c]ugacke, and u[|c]ugackeg[|c]e, the  last syllable of the latter name referring to the attitude of the post.  Around the fireplace was a circular space for the feet of the people as  they sat about the fire. The couches of the occupants of the tent were  arranged outside of and all around this circular space.      Beds and Bedding.    A couch was formed by laying down two or three winter hides dried with  the hair on. These hides were placed around the fireplace at a safe  distance. In the earth lodges, according to Joseph La Fleche, the Omaha  used sahi, or grass mats, for seats, as is the present custom of the  Winnebago; but at night they reclined on dressed hides with thick hair  on them, and covered themselves with similar hides.    For pillows they used ibehi^{n} or i^{n}behi^{n}. When the vegetation  was about 3 inches high in the spring, the Indians killed deer and  pulled off the hair in order to remove the thin skin or tissue next to  it. This latter, when thoroughly dried, is smooth and white, resembling  parchment. It was used for pillows and moccasin-strings. When used for  pillows the case was filled with goose feathers or the hair of the deer  until it was about 2 feet long and 9 inches high. During the day, and  whenever there was occasion, they were used as seats; but if none could  be had, the people sat on winter robes or hides forming the couches.[1]  Back of the couches and next to the interior tent-poles were placed the  baggage, sacks of corn, and other household properties.    The upright tent is one form of the Dakota \"wake[']ya,\" the plural of  which, \"wake[']yapi,\" undoubtedly gave rise to the familiar \"wick[']iup\"  of the plains, and also to \"wae-ka[']-yo\" of Morgan.[2]      Cradles.    A board of convenient size, usually about a yard long and a foot wide,  was selected to form a cradle or u[|c]uhe. No pillow was needed. A  soft skin ([p]aq[|c]uqaha [|c]a^{n}) covered with plenty of thick hair  was laid on the board, and on it was placed the infant.    [Footnote 1: Hammocks and bedsteads were unknown prior to their  introduction by the traders and other white people.]    [Footnote 2: Contributions to North American Ethnology, vol. iv., 1881,  p. 114.]    [Illustration: Fig. 311.--Omaha cradle--plan.]    In the annexed figures, <i>a</i> is the [)i]ndua[|c]isi^{n}ka^{n}he, the  object painted on the board at the end where the infant's head is laid;  <i>b</i> is the [)i]ndei[|c]id[)i]ndi^{n} (\"that which is drawn taut over  the face\"), the two strings of beads and sinew or thread (sometimes made of  red calico alone), which keep in place the fan, etc.; the fan  ([)i]ndeagani), which is suspended from a bow of wood, (<i>c</i>) is about  6 inches square, and is now made of interwoven sinew on which beads have  been strung. Occasionally thimbles and other bright objects dangle from  the bottom of the fan. The i[|c]a[|c]istage (<i>d</i>) is the band by which  the infant is fastened to the cradle.    [Illustration: Fig. 312.--Omaha cradle--side view.]      Children's Swings.    For swings the ends of two withes of buffalo hide were secured to four  trees or posts which formed the corners of a parallelogram. A blanket  was thrown across the withes and folded over on them. The infant was  laid on top of the fold and swung from side to side without falling.      Brooms.    Brooms were of two kinds. One form was made of sticks tied together, and  was used for sweeping the ground outside of the tent or earth lodge, and  the interior of the earth lodge, except the fireplace. The other kind  was made of goose or turkey feathers, and was used for sweeping the  fireplace of an earth lodge.      Pottery.    Pottery has not been made by the Omaha for more than fifty years. The  art of making it has been forgotten by the tribe.      Mortar and Pestles.    A mortar was made by burning a large hole in a round knot or piece of  wood about 7 inches in diameter. The lower end was sharpened to a  point, which was thrust into the ground when needed for use. After  putting corn in a mortar of this description, the woman grasped the  wooden pestle in the middle, with the larger end upward; the smaller  end, which was about an inch in diameter, was put into the mortar. The  operation of pounding corn among the Omaha was called \"he.\" The mortar  (uhe) and pestle (wehe) were both made commonly of elm, although  sometimes they were fashioned of white oak. Mortars were of various  sizes, some of them measuring 2 feet in diameter. Pestles were always of  hard and heavy wood, and fully 3 feet long, taperring from 4 inches to  an inch in diameter.    [Illustration: Fig. 314.--Omaha pestle.]    [Illustration: Fig. 313.--Omaha mortar.]      Spoons, Ladles and Drinking Vessels.    Spoons were made of horn, wood, or pottery. The black spoons made of  buffalo horn ([t]ehe sab[)e]), are not used by such Omaha as belong to  the Buffalo gentes (Inkesab[)e], [|C]atada, [T]esinde, etc.) which may  not touch a buffalo head.

Thus it appears that  well-advanced peoples may have produced inferior textiles and that  backward tribes may have excelled in the art. Caution is necessary in  using the evidence furnished by the art to aid in determining relative  degrees of culture.      SOURCES OF INFORMATION.    The failure of the textile art to secure a prominent place in the field  of archeologic evidence is due to the susceptibility of the products to  decay. Examples of archaic work survive to us only by virtue of  exceptionally favorable circumstances; it rarely happened that mound  fabrics were so conditioned, as the soil in which they were buried is  generally porous and moist; they were in some cases preserved through  contact with objects of copper, the oxides of that metal having a  tendency to arrest decay. The custom of burial in caves and rock  shelters has led to the preservation of numerous fabrics through the  agency of certain salts with which the soil is charged. Preservation by  charring is common, and it is held by some that carbonization without  the agency of fire has in some cases taken place.    Considerable knowledge of the fabrics of the ancient North American  tribes is preserved in a way wholly distinct from the preceding. The  primitive potter employed woven textiles in the manufacture of  earthenware; during the processes of construction the fabrics were  impressed on the soft clay, and when the vessels were baked the  impressions became fixed. The study of these impressions led to meager  results until the idea was conceived of taking castings from them in  clay, wax, or paper; through this device the negative impression becomes  a positive reproduction and the fabrics are shown in relief, every  feature coming out with surprising distinctness; it is possible even to  discover the nature of the threads employed and to detect the manner of  their combination.    Evidence of the practice of textile arts by many ancient nations is  preserved to us by such implements of weaving as happened to be of  enduring materials; spindle-whorls in clay and stone are perhaps the  most common of these relics. These objects tell us definitely of the  practice of the art, but give little insight into the character of the  products. It is a notable fact that evidence of this class is almost  wholly wanting in the United States; spindle-whorls have in rare cases  been reported from southern localities, and a few writers have mentioned  their use by modern tribes.    It happens that in some cases we may learn something of the progress  made by vanished peoples in this art by a study of the forms of such of  their earthen vessels as were manifestly derived from baskets, or made  in imitation of them. The ornamental art of peoples well advanced in  culture often bears evidence of the influence of the system of  combination of parts followed originally in the textile arts, and little  art, ancient or modern, in which men have endeavored to embody beauty,  is without strongly marked traces of this influence. By the study of  archaic ornament embodied in clay, wood, and stone, therefore, the  archeologist may hope to add something to the sum of his knowledge of  ancient textiles. It should be noted that the pottery of the  mound-builders shows less evidence of the influence of textile forms  than does that of most other nations, and some groups of their ware  appear to present no recognizable traces of it whatever.    Although much information has been brought together from all of the  sources mentioned, it is not at all certain that we can form anything  like a complete or correct notion of the character and scope of the art  as practiced by the mound-builders. No doubt the finest articles of  apparel were often buried with the dead, but a very small fraction only  of the mortuary wrappings or costumes has been preserved, and from vast  areas once thickly inhabited by the most advanced tribes nothing  whatever has been collected. Of embroideries, featherwork, and the like,  so frequently mentioned by early travelers, hardly a trace is left.    The relations of our historic tribes to the ancient peoples of our  continent and to all of the nations, ancient and modern, who built  mounds and earthworks, are now generally considered so intimate that no  objection can be raised to the utilization of the accounts of early  explorers in the elucidation of such features of the art as archeology  has failed to record. The first step in this study may consist quite  properly of a review of what is recorded of the historic art.  Subsequently the purely archeologic data will be given.          PRODUCTS OF THE ART.      In undertaking to classify the textile fabrics of the mound region it  is found that, although there is an unbroken gradation from the rudest  and heaviest textile constructions to the most delicate and refined  textures, a number of well-marked divisions may be made. The  broadest of these is based on the use of spun as opposed to unspun  strands or parts, a classification corresponding somewhat closely to the  division into rigid and pliable forms. Material, method of combination  of parts, and function may each be made the basis of classification,  but for present purposes a simple presentation of the whole body of  products, beginning with the rudest or most primitive forms and ending  with the most elaborate and artistic products, is sufficient. The material  will be presented in the following order: (1) Wattle work; (2)  basketry; (3) matting; (4) pliable fabrics or cloths.      WATTLE WORK.    The term wattling is applied to such constructions as employ by  interlacing, plaiting, etc., somewhat heavy, rigid, or slightly pliable  parts, as rods, boughs, canes, and vines. Primitive shelters and  dwellings are very often constructed in this manner, and rafts, cages,  bridges, fish weirs, and inclosures of various kinds were and still are  made or partly made in this manner. As a matter of course, few of these  constructions are known to us save through historic channels; but traces  of wattle work are found in the mounds of the lower Mississippi valley,  where imprints of the interlaced canes occur in the baked clay plaster  with which the dwellings were finished. When we consider the nature of  the materials at hand, and the close correspondence in habits and  customs of our prehistoric peoples with the tribes found living by the  earliest explorers and settlers, we naturally conclude that this class  of construction was very common at all known periods of native American  history.    The constructors of native dwellings generally employed pliable branches  or saplings, which are bound together with vines, twigs, and other more  pliable woody forms. John Smith says of the Indians of Virginia[1]  that--        Their houses are built like our Arbors, of small young      springs bowed and tyed, and so close covered with Mats, or      the barkes of trees very handsomely, that notwithstanding      either winde, raine, or weather, they are as warm as stooues,      but very smoaky, yet at the toppe of the house there is a      hole made for the smoake to goe into right over the fire.       [1] Hist. Virginia, John Smith. Richmond, 1819, vol. I, p.     130.    Butel-Dumont also, in describing the dwellings of the Natchez Indians of  the lower Mississippi region, speaks of the door of an Indian cabin  \"made of dried canes fastened and interlaced on two other canes placed  across.\"[2]    A singular use of wattle work is mentioned by Lafitau. He states that  the young men, when going through the ordeal of initiation on attaining  their majority, were placed apart in--        An inclosure very strongly built, made expressly for this      purpose, one of which I saw in 1694, which belonged to the      Indians of Paumauenkie. It was in the form of a sugar loaf and      was open on all sides like a trellis to admit the air.[3]    Of a somewhat similar nature was the construction of biers described by  Butel-Dumont. Speaking of the Mobilians, he says:        When their chief is dead they proceed as follows: At 15 or 20      feet from his cabin they erect a kind of platform raised      about 41/2 feet from the ground. This is composed of four      large forked poles of oak wood planted in the earth, with      others placed across; this is covered with canes bound and      interlaced so as to resemble greatly the bed used by the      natives.[4]    According to John Lawson, similarly constructed \"hurdles\" were in use  among the Carolina Indians.    [Illustration: 1.--Fish weir of the Virginia Indiana (after Hariot).]    The tide-water tribes of the Atlantic coast region made very frequent  use of fish weirs, which were essentially textile in character. John  Smith mentions their use in Virginia, and Hariot gives a number of  plates in which the weirs are delineated. The cut here given (figure 1)  is from Hariot's plate XIII. It represents a very elaborate trap; much  simpler forms are shown in other plates. Slender poles set in the  shallow water are held in place by wattling or interlacing of pliable  parts.    It is probable that traps of similar character were used by the  mound-building tribes wherever the conditions were favorable. The only  apparent traces of such weirs yet found in any part of the country are a  number of stumps of stakes discovered by H. T. Cresson in Delaware river  near Wilmington, but these appear to be much heavier than would have  been used for the purpose by the natives.    Another somewhat usual use of wattling is mentioned by various authors.  Butel-Dumont speaks of a raft made of poles and canes, and Du Pratz,  writing of the Louisiana Indians, says:        The conveniencies for passing rivers would soon be suggested      to them by the floating of wood upon the water. Accordingly      one of their methods of crossing"]]]
