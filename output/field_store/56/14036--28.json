But lately there had been an  estrangement between the squire's wife and the village shopkeeper.  Mrs. Ellison, whose husband owned all the houses in the village, as  well as the land surrounding it, was accustomed to speak her mind  very freely to the wives of the villagers. She was kindness itself,  in cases of illness or distress; and her kitchen supplied soups,  jellies, and nourishing food to all who required it; but in return,  Mrs. Ellison expected her lectures on waste, untidiness, and  mismanagement to be listened to with respect and reverence.    She was, then, at once surprised and displeased when, two or three  months before, having spoken sharply to Mrs. Whitney as to the  alleged delinquencies of Reuben, she found herself decidedly,  though not disrespectfully, replied to.    \"The other boys are always set against my Reuben,\" Mrs. Whitney  said, \"because he is a stranger in the village, and has no father;  and whatever is done, they throw it on to him. The boy is not a bad  boy, ma'm--not in any way a bad boy. He may get into mischief, like  the rest; but he is not a bit worse than others, not half as bad as  some of them, and those who have told you that he is haven't told  you the truth.\"    Mrs. Ellison had not liked it. She was not accustomed to be  answered, except by excuses and apologies; and Mrs. Whitney's  independent manner of speaking came upon her almost as an act of  rebellion, in her own kingdom. She was too fair, however, to  withdraw her custom from the shop; but from that time she had not,  herself, entered it.    Reuben was a source of anxiety to his mother, but this had no  reference to his conduct. She worried over his future. The receipts  from the shop were sufficient for their wants; and indeed the widow  was enabled, from time to time, to lay by a pound against bad  times; but she did not see what she was to do with the boy. Almost  all the other lads of the village, of the same age, were already in  the fields; and Mrs. Whitney felt that she could not much longer  keep him idle. The question was, what was she to do with him? That  he should not go into the fields she was fully determined, and her  great wish was to apprentice him to some trade; but as her father  had recently died, she did not see how she was to set about it.    That evening, at dinner, Mrs. Ellison told the squire of the scene  in the school room.    \"White must go,\" he said, \"that is quite evident. I have seen, for  some time, that we wanted a younger man, more abreast of the times  than White is; but I don't like turning him adrift altogether. He  has been here upwards of thirty years. What am I to do with him?\"    Mrs. Ellison could make no suggestion; but she, too, disliked the  thought of anyone in the village being turned adrift upon the  world.    \"The very thing!\" the squire exclaimed, suddenly. \"We will make him  clerk. Old Peters has long been past his work. The old man must be  seventy-five, if he's a day, and his voice quavers so that it makes  the boys laugh. We will pension him off. He can have his cottage  rent free, and three or four shillings a week. I don't suppose it  will be for many years. As for White, he cannot be much above  sixty. He will fill the place very well.    \"I am sure the vicar will agree, for he has been speaking to me,  about Peters being past his work, for the last five years. What do  you say, my dear?\"    \"I think that will do very well, William,\" Mrs. Ellison replied,  \"and will get over the difficulty altogether.\"    \"So you see, wife, for once that boy of Widow Whitney's was not to  blame. I told you you took those stories on trust against him too  readily. The boy's a bit of a pickle, no doubt; and I very near  gave him a thrashing, myself, a fortnight since, for on going up to  the seven-acre field, I found him riding bare backed on that young  pony I intended for Kate.\"    \"You don't say so, William!\" Mrs. Ellison exclaimed, greatly  shocked. \"I never heard of such an impudent thing. I really wonder  you didn't thrash him.\"    \"Well, perhaps I should have done so, my dear; but the fact is, I  caught sight of him some time before he saw me, and he was really  sitting her so well that I could not find it in my heart to call  out. He was really doing me a service. The pony had never been  ridden, and was as wild as a wild goat. Thomas is too old, in fact,  to break it in, and I should have had to get someone to do it, and  pay him two or three pounds for the job.    \"It was not the first time the boy had been on her back, I could  see. The pony was not quite broken and, just as I came on the  scene, was trying its best to get rid of him; but it couldn't do  it, and I could see, by the way he rode her about afterwards, that  he had got her completely in hand; and a very pretty-going little  thing she will turn out.\"    \"But what did you say to him, William? I am sure I should never  stop to think whether he was breaking in the pony, or not, if I saw  him riding it about.\"    \"I daresay not, my dear,\" the squire said, laughing; \"but then you  see, you have never been a boy; and I have, and can make  allowances. Many a pony and horse have I broken in, in my time; and  have got on the back of more than one, without my father knowing  anything about it.\"    \"Yes, but they were your father's horses, William,\" Mrs. Ellison  persisted. \"That makes all the difference.\"    \"I don't suppose it would have made much difference to me,\" the  squire laughed, \"at that time. I was too fond of horse flesh, even  from a boy, to be particular whose horse it was I got across.  However, of course, after waiting till he had done, I gave the  young scamp a blowing up.\"    \"Not much of a blowing up, I am sure,\" Mrs. Ellison said; \"and as  likely as not, a shilling at the end of it.\"    \"Well, Mary, I must own,\" the squire said pleasantly, \"that a  shilling did find its way out of my pocket into his.\"    \"It's too bad of you, William,\" Mrs. Ellison said indignantly.  \"Here is this boy, who is notoriously a scapegrace, has the  impertinence to ride your horse, and you encourage him in his  misdeeds by giving him a shilling.\"    \"Well, my dear, don't you see, I saved two pounds nineteen by the  transaction.    \"Besides,\" he added more seriously, \"I think the boy has been  maligned. I don't fancy he's a bad lad at all. A little mischief  and so on, but none the worse for that. Besides, you know, I knew  his father; and have sat many a time on horseback chatting to him,  at the door of his mill; and drank more than one glass of good ale,  which his wife has brought out to me. I am not altogether easy in  my conscience about them. If there had been a subscription got up  for the widow at his death, I should have put my name down for  twenty pounds; and all that I have done for her is to take eighteen  pence a week off that cottage of theirs.    \"No, I called the boy to me when he got off, and pretty scared he  looked when he saw me. When he came up, I asked him how he dared to  ride my horses about, without my leave. Of course he said he was  sorry, which meant nothing; and he added, as a sort of excuse, that  he used from a child to ride the horses at the mill down to the  ford for water; and that his father generally had a young one or  two, in that paddock of his by the mill, and he used often to ride  them; and seeing the pony one day, galloping about the field and  kicking up its heels, he wondered whether he could sit a horse  still, and especially whether he could keep on that pony's back.  Then he set to, to try.    \"The pony flung him several times, at first; and no wonder, as he  had no saddle, and only a piece of old rope for a bridle; but he  mastered him at last, and he assured me that he had never used the  stick, and certainly he had not one when I saw him. I told him, of  course, that he knew he ought not to have done it; but that, as he  had taken it in hand, he might finish it. I said that I intended to  have it broken in for Kate, and that he had best get a bit of  sacking and put it on sideways, to accustom the pony to carry a  lady. Then I gave him a shilling, and told him I would give him  five more, when he could tell me the pony was sufficiently broken  and gentle to carry Kate.\"    Mrs. Ellison shook her head in disapprobation.    \"It is of no use, William, my talking to the villagers as to the  ways of their boys, if that is the way you counteract my advice.\"    \"But I don't always, my dear,\" the squire said blandly. \"For  instance, I shall go round tomorrow morning with my dog whip to  Thorne's; and I shall offer him the choice of giving that boy of  his the soundest thrashing he ever had, while I stand by to see it,  or of going out of his house at the end of the quarter.    \"I rather hope he will choose the latter alternative. That beer  shop of his is the haunt of all the idle fellows in the village. I  have a strong suspicion that he is in league with the poachers, if  he doesn't poach himself; and the first opportunity I get of laying  my finger upon him, out he goes.\"    A few days later when Kate Ellison issued from the gate of the  house, which lay just at the end of the village, with the basket  containing some jelly and medicine for a sick child, she found  Reuben Whitney awaiting her. He touched his cap.    \"Please, miss, I made bold to come here, to thank you for having  cleared me.\"    \"But I couldn't help clearing you, Reuben, for you see, I knew it  wasn't you.\"    \"Well, miss, it was very kind, all the same; and I am very much  obliged to you.\"    \"But why do you get into scrapes?\" the girl said. \"If you didn't,  you wouldn't be suspected of other things. Mamma said, the other  day, you got into more scrapes than any boy in the village; and you  look nice, too. Why do you do it?\"    \"I don't know why I do it, miss,\" Reuben said shamefacedly. \"I  suppose it's because I don't go into the fields, like most of the  other"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20034"],[0,"Scottish Ghost Stories (#2)"],[1," of cone-shaped mountains,  darkly silhouetted against the silvery sky, and seemingly hushed in  gaping expectancy; the shining, scaly surface of some far-off tarn or  river, perceptible only at intervals, owing to the thick clusters of  gently nodding pines; the white-washed walls of cottages, glistening  amid the dark green denseness of the thickly leaved box trees, and the  light, feathery foliage of the golden laburnum; the undulating  meadows, besprinkled with gorse and grotesquely moulded crags of  granite; the white, the dazzling white roads, saturated with  moonbeams; all--all were overwhelmed with stillness--the stillness  that belongs, and belongs only, to the mountains, and trees, and  plains--the stillness of shadowland. I even counted the buttons, the  horn buttons, on the rustics' coats--one was missing from the man's,  two from the boy's; and I even noted the sweat-stains under the  armpits of Matthew's shirt, and the dents and tears in Tammas's soft  wideawake. I observed all these trivialities and more besides. I saw  the abrupt rising and falling of the man's chest as his breath came in  sharp jerks; the stream of dirty saliva that oozed from between his  blackberry-stained lips and dribbled down his chin; I saw their  hands--the man's, square-fingered, black-nailed, big-veined, shining  with perspiration and clutching grimly at the reins; the boy's,  smaller, and if anything rather more grimy--the one pressed flat down  on the hay, the other extended in front of him, the palm stretched  outwards and all the fingers widely apart.    And while these minute particulars were being driven into my soul, the  cause of it all--the indefinable, esoteric column--stood silent and  motionless over-against the hedge, a baleful glow emanating from it.    The horse suddenly broke the spell. Dashing its head forward, it broke  off at a gallop, and, tearing frantically past the phantasm, went  helter-skelter down the road to my left. I then saw Tammas turning a  somersault, miraculously saved from falling head first on to the  road, by rebounding from the pitchfork which had been wedged upright  in the hay, whilst the figure, which followed in their wake with  prodigious bounds, was apparently trying to get at him with its  spidery arms. But whether it succeeded or not I cannot say, for I was  so uncontrollably fearful lest it should return to me, that I mounted  my bicycle and rode as I had never ridden before and have never ridden  since.    I described the incident to Miss Macdonald on my return. She looked  very serious.    \"It was stupid of me not to have warned you,\" she said. \"That that  particular spot in the road has always--at least ever since I can  remember--borne the reputation of being haunted. None of the peasants  round here will venture within a mile of it after twilight, so the  carters you saw must have been strangers. No one has ever seen the  ghost except in the misty form in which it appeared to you. It does  not frequent the place every night; it only appears periodically; and  its method never varies. It leaps over a wall or hedge, remains  stationary till some one approaches, and then pursues them with  monstrous springs. The person it touches invariably dies within a  year. I well recollect when I was in my teens, on just such a night as  this, driving home with my father from Lady Colin Ferner's croquet  party at Blair Atholl. When we got to the spot you name, the horse  shied, and before I could realise what had happened, we were racing  home at a terrific pace. My father and I sat in front, and the groom,  a Highland boy from the valley of Ben-y-gloe, behind. Never having  seen my father frightened, his agitation now alarmed me horribly, and  the more so as my instinct told me it was caused by something other  than the mere bolting of the horse. I was soon enlightened. A gigantic  figure, with leaps and bounds, suddenly overtook us, and, thrusting  out its long, thin arms, touched my father lightly on the hand, and  then with a harsh cry, more like that of some strange animal than that  of a human being, disappeared. Neither of us spoke till we reached  home,--I did not live here then, but in a house on the other side of  Pitlochry,--when my father, who was still as white as a sheet, took me  aside and whispered, 'Whatever you do, Flora, don't breathe a word of  what has happened to your mother, and never let her go along that road  at night. It was the death bogle. I shall die within twelve months.'  And he did.\"    Miss Macdonald paused. A brief silence ensued, and she then went on  with all her customary briskness: \"I cannot describe the thing any  more than you can, except that it gave me the impression it had no  eyes. But what it was, whether the ghost of a man, woman, or some  peculiar beast, I could not, for the life of me, tell. Now, Mr.  O'Donnell, have you had enough horrors for one evening, or would you  like to hear just one more?\"    Knowing that sleep was utterly out of the question, and that one or  two more thrills would make very little difference to my already  shattered nerves, I replied that I would listen eagerly to anything  she could tell me, however horrible. My permission thus gained--and  gained so readily--Miss Macdonald, not without, I noticed, one or two  apprehensive glances at the slightly rustling curtains, began her  narrative, which ran, as nearly as I can remember, as follows:--    \"After my father's death, I told my mother about our adventure the  night we drove home from Lady Colin Ferner's party, and asked her if  she remembered ever having heard anything that could possibly account  for the phenomenon. After a few moments' reflection, this is the story  she told me:--      THE INEXTINGUISHABLE CANDLE OF THE OLD WHITE HOUSE    There was once a house, known as \"The Old White House,\" that used to  stand by the side of the road, close to where you say the horse first  took fright. Some people of the name of Holkitt, relations of dear old  Sir Arthur Holkitt, and great friends of ours, used to live there. The  house, it was popularly believed, had been built on the site of an  ancient burial-ground. Every one used to say it was haunted, and the  Holkitts had great trouble in getting servants. The appearance of the  haunted house did not belie its reputation, for its grey walls, sombre  garden, gloomy hall, dark passages and staircase, and sinister-looking  attics could not have been more thoroughly suggestive of all kinds of  ghostly phenomena. Moreover, the whole atmosphere of the place, no  matter how hot and bright the sun, was cold and dreary, and it was a  constant source of wonder to every one how Lady Holkitt could live  there. She was, however, always cheerful, and used to tell me that  nothing would induce her to leave a spot dear to so many generations  of her family, and associated with the happiest recollections in her  life. She was very fond of company, and there was scarcely a week in  the year in which she had not some one staying with her. I can only  remember her as widow, her husband, a major in the Gordon Highlanders,  having died in India before I was born. She had two daughters,  Margaret and Alice, both considered very handsome, but some years  older than I. This difference in age, however, did not prevent our  being on very friendly terms, and I was constantly invited to their  house--in the summer to croquet and archery, in the winter to balls.  Like most elderly ladies of that period, Lady Holkitt was very fond of  cards, and she and my mother used frequently to play bezique and  cribbage, whilst the girls and I indulged in something rather more  frivolous. On those occasions the carriage always came for us at ten,  since my mother, for some reason or other--I had a shrewd suspicion it  was on account of the alleged haunting--would never return home after  that time. When she accepted an invitation to a ball, it was always  conditionally that Lady Holkitt would put us both up for the night,  and the carriage used, then, to come for us the following day, after  one o'clock luncheon. I shall never forget the last time I went to a  dance at \"The Old White House,\" though it is now rather more than  fifty years ago. My mother had not been very well for some weeks,  having, so she thought, taken cold internally. She had not had a  doctor, partly because she did not feel ill enough, and partly because  the only medical man near us was an apothecary, of whose skill she had  a very poor opinion. My mother had quite made up her mind to accompany  me to the ball, but at the last moment, the weather being appalling,  she yielded to advice, and my aunt Norah, who happened to be staying  with us at the time, chaperoned me instead. It was snowing when we  set out, and as it snowed all through the night and most of the next  day, the roads were completely blocked, and we had to remain at \"The  Old White House\" from Monday evening till the following Thursday. Aunt  Norah and I occupied separate bedrooms, and mine was at the end of a  long passage away from everybody else's. Prior to this my mother and I  had always shared a room--the only really pleasant one, so I thought,  in the house--overlooking the front lawn. But on this occasion there  being a number of visitors, belated like ourselves, we had to squeeze  in wherever we could; and as my aunt and I were to have separate rooms  (my aunt liking a room to herself), it was natural that she should be  allotted the largest and most comfortable. Consequently, she was  domiciled in the wing where all the other visitors slept, whilst I was  forced to retreat to a passage on the other side of the house, where,  with the exception of my apartment, there were none other but  lumber-rooms. All went smoothly and happily, and nothing interrupted  the harmony of our visit, till the night before we returned home. We  had had supper--our meals were differently arranged in those days--and"]]]
