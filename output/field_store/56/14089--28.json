The cruiser also  studies the kinds and character of the trees, the contour of the  ground, the proximity to streams,--all with the view to marketing the  product. Acting on the information thus gained by the cruiser, the  lumberman purchases his sections at the proper land office, or if  he is less scrupulous, buys only enough to serve as a basis for  operations. Enormous fortunes have been made by timber thieves, now  respectable members of the community. As a further preliminary step to  lumbering itself, the _tote road_ and _camp_ are built. The tote road  is a rough road on which supplies for crew and cattle can be taken to  camp from civilization.        It is barely passable for a team and a wagon, but it serves      its purpose, and over it come more men and horses. Lumber for      the floors and roofs of the shanties and for the rude pieces      of furniture that will be needed, tarred paper to make the      roofs tight, a few glazed window sashes, a huge range and a      number of box stoves, dishes and kitchen utensils, a little      stock of goods for the van, blankets by the dozen and score,      and countless boxes and barrels and bags of provisions.[1]        [Footnote 1: Hulbert: The Lumber Jack; Outlook, 76: 801, April      2, '04.]    The _camp_ itself, Fig. 3, is built of logs, roofed with plank,  covered with heavy tar paper, and dimly lighted. There are usually  five buildings,--the men's camp, the cook camp, the office, the barn,  and the blacksmith's shop. Many camps accommodate from eighty to one  hundred men. The men's camp is filled with bunks and is heated by a  stove and in general roughly furnished. Cooking and eating are done in  the cook camp, where the cook and his assistant, the \"cookee,\" sleep.  The office is occupied by the foreman, log-sealers and clerks. Here  the books and accounts are kept, and here is the \"van,\" stocked with  such goods as will supply the immediate needs of the lumber jacks.    [Illustration: Fig. 3. Winter Logging Camp. Itasco County, Minnesota.]    Before winter sets in the _main road_ is built, Fig. 15, p. 17, very  carefully graded from the camp down to the nearest mill or railway  siding, or oftener to the stream down which the logs are to be  floated. This road has to be as wide as a city street, 25 feet. The  route is carefully chosen, and the grade is made as easy as possible.  Much labor is spent upon it, clearing away stumps and rocks, leveling  up with corduroy, building bridges strong enough to carry enormous  loads, and otherwise making it as passable as can be; for when needed  later, its good condition is of first importance. This main road is  quite distinct from and much superior to the tote road.    At intervals alongside the main road, small squares called _skidways_  are cleared of brush and in each of them two tree trunks, \"skids,\" are  laid at right angles to the road. On these the logs, when cut later,  are to be piled. Back from the skidways, into the woods the swampers  cut rough, narrow roads called _dray roads_ or travoy roads,--mere  trails sufficiently cleared of brush to allow a team of horses to pull  a log thru.    [Illustration: Fig. 4. Tools used in Logging.]    All these are operations preliminary to the felling of trees. The  tools commonly used in logging are shown in Fig. 4. When everything is  ready for felling, the \"fitter\" goes ahead _marking_ each tree to be  felled and the direction in which it is to fall by cutting a notch on  that side. Then come the sawyers in pairs, Fig. 5. First they chop a  deep gash on the side of the tree toward which it is to fall, and  then from the opposite side begin cutting with a long, Tuttle-tooth,  crosscut-saw. The saw is a long, flexible ribbon of steel, with  handles so affixed to each end that they can be removed easily. The  cut is made on the pulling stroke, and hence the kerf can be very  narrow. As soon as the saw is well within the trunk, the sawyers drive  iron wedges into the kerf behind it, partly to keep the weight of the  trunk from binding the saw, and partly to direct its fall. Then the  saw is pulled back and forth, and the wedges driven in farther and  farther, until every stroke of the maul that drives them sends a  shiver thru the whole tree. Just as the tree is ready to go over, the  saw handle at one end is unhooked and the saw pulled out at the other  side. \"Timber!,\" the men cry out as a warning to any working near by,  for the tree has begun to lean slightly. Then with a hastening rush  the top whistles thru the air, and tears thru the branches of other  trees, and the trunk with a tremendous crash strikes the ground. Even  hardened loggers can hardly keep from shouting, so impressive is the  sight of a falling giant tree.    [Illustration: Fig. 5. Felling Red Spruce with a Saw. Adirondack  Mountains, New York.]    [Illustration: Fig. 6. Sawing Logs into Lengths.]    All this seems simple enough in outline, but the actual execution  requires considerable skill. Trees seldom stand quite vertical, there  is danger of lodging in some other tree in thick woods, and it is  therefore necessary to throw trees quite exactly. Some men become  so expert at this that they can plant a stake and drive it into the  ground by the falling trunk as truly as if they hit it with a maul. On  the other hand, serious accidents often happen in falling trees. Most  of them come from \"side winders,\" i. e., the falling of smaller trees  struck by the felled trees.    After \"falling\" a tree, the sawyers mark off and saw the trunk into  log lengths, Fig. 6, paying due attention to the necessity of avoiding  knots, forks, and rotten places, so that some of the logs are eighteen  feet, some sixteen feet, some fourteen feet, and some only twelve feet  in length. Meanwhile the swampers trim off the branches, Fig. 7, a job  requiring no little skill, in order that the trunk may be shaved close  but not gashed.    [Illustration: Fig. 7. Trimming off Branches of Spruce. Adirondack  Mountains, New York.]    [Illustration: Fig. 8. Hauling Spruce Logs to the Skidway. Adirondack  Mountains, New York.]    This finishes the second group of operations, the felling. Next the  logs are _dragged_ out to the dray roads, Fig. 8. A heavy pair of  tongs, like ice-tongs, is attached to one end, and the log is snaked  out by horses to the skidway. If the log is very heavy, one end is put  on a dray. By one way or another the log is dragged out and across the  two parallel skids, on which it is rolled by cant-hooks to the end  of skids toward the road way. If other logs already occupy the skids,  each new log as it arrives is piled on the first tier. As the pile  grows higher, each log is \"decked,\" that is, rolled up parallel poles  laid slanting up the face of the pile, by means of a chain passed  under and over the log and back over the pile, Fig. 11. A horse  hitched to the end of the chain hauls up the log, which is guided by  the \"send-up men\" with their cant-hooks.    Once piled the logs are \"_scaled_,\" that is measured in order to  compute the number of board feet in them, Fig. 9. The scaler generally  has an assistant, for logs in large piles must be measured at both  ends in order to determine which is the top, the body of the log being  out of sight. When measured each end of the log is stamped with a  hammer with the owner's mark, by which it can afterward be identified.  Here the logs rest and the felling and skidding continue until deep  snow falls and then the sleigh haul begins.    [Illustration: Fig. 9. \"Scaling\" Logs on the Skids.]    [Illustration: Fig. 10. Making an Ice Road by Flooding.]    [Illustration: Fig. 11. Decking Logs on Skidway.]    For this the main road is especially prepared. First the road is  carefully _plowed_ with an immense V plow, weighted down by logs. To  the plow are attached fans. Only an inch or two of snow is left on  the ground by this plow, which is followed by another special plow  to gouge the ruts, and by a gang of \"road monkeys\" who clear the  road thoroly. Then follows an immense tank set on runners and holding  perhaps seventy-five barrels of water, and so arranged as to flood  the road from holes in the bottom of the tank, a sort of rough road  sprinkler, Fig. 10. The sprinkler goes over the road again and again  until the road is covered by a clear, solid sheet of ice often two  feet thick, extending from the skidways to the banking grounds. This  ice road is one of the modern improvements in logging. Once finished,  these roads are beautiful pieces of construction with deep, clear  ruts. They have to be constantly watched and repaired, and this is  the work of the \"road monkeys.\" If possible the road has been made  entirely with down grades but some of these are so steep that a man  must be prepared with sand or hay to check too headlong a descent.    [Illustration: Fig. 12. Loading a Sled from a Skidway.]    [Illustration: Fig. 13. A Load of Logs. Flathead County, Montana.]    When all is ready the sleigh haul begins. Piling on the sleighs  or bobs, Fig. 12, is similar to piling on the skidways, but more  difficult, for the load has to be carefully balanced, Fig. 13. Chains  bind the loads but the piling is only too apt to be defective, and  the whole load \"squash out\" with a rush. It is a time of feverish  activity. The sprinklers are at work till after midnight, the loaders  are out long before daylight. The blacksmith is busy with repairs,  the road monkeys work overtime, and the cook works all the time.  \"Everybody works.\" The haul itself is full of excitement. The  ponderous load of logs, weighing anywhere from eight to thirty-five  tons has to be conducted largely by its own momentum down this glassy  road. If a horse fall nothing can save its life. If the runners get  out of the ruts, the whole load, driver and all, is likely to be  upset. It is an"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20847"],[0,"India: What can it teach us?

Friedrich Maximilian Mueller, the son of Wilhelm Mueller, the Saxon  poet, was born at Dessau, December 6th, 1823. He matriculated at  Leipzig in his eighteenth year, giving his principal attention to  classical philology, and receiving his degree in 1843. He immediately  began a course of Oriental studies, chiefly Sanskrit, under the  supervision of Professor Brockhaus, and in 1844 engaged in his  translation of the \"Hitopadesa.\" He removed from Leipzig to Berlin,  and attended the lectures of Bopp, Ruecker, and Schelling. The next  year he went to Paris to listen to Eugene Burnouf at the College de  France. He now began the collecting of material for his great quarto  edition of the \"Rig-Veda Sanhita\" and the \"Commentary of  Saganadranja.\" He visited England for this purpose to examine the  manuscripts in the Bodleian Library and at the Indian House. At the  recommendation of H. H. Wilson, the Orientalist, he was commissioned  by the East India Company to publish his edition in England at their  expense. The first volume appeared in 1849, and five others followed  during the next few years.    In 1850 he delivered a course of \"Lectures on Comparative Philology\"  at Oxford, and the next year was made member of Christ Church,  curator, etc., and appointed Taylorian Professor of Modern European  Languages and Literature. He received also numerous other marks of  distinction from universities, and was made one of the eight foreign  members of the Institute of France. The Volney prize was awarded him  by the French Academy for his \"Essay on the Comparative Philology of  Indo-European Languages and its Bearing on the Early Civilization of  Mankind.\"    His writings have been numerous. Besides editing the translations of  the \"Sacred Books of the Principal Religions,\" he has published a  \"Handbook for the Study of Sanskrit,\" a \"Sanskrit-English Dictionary  and Grammar,\" \"Lectures upon the Science of Language,\" \"An  Introduction to the Science of Religion,\" \"Essays on Mythology,\"  \"Chips from a German Workshop,\" etc. He seems to have no intermission,  but penetrates where others would not have ventured, or have faltered  from utter weariness. In the field of philology he has few peers,  while in early Sanskrit learning he has virtually taken the part of an  innovator. While reverently following after Sir William Jones,  Colebrooke, Windischmann, Bopp, and others of equal distinction, he  sets aside the received views in regard to chronology and historical  occurrences. The era of Vikramaditya and the Golden Age of Sanskrit  literature, bearing a date almost simultaneous with the Augustan  period at the West, are postponed by him to a later century. It may be  that he has overlooked some canon of interpretation that would have  modified his results. Those, however, who hesitate to accept his  conclusions freely acknowledge his scholarly enthusiasm, persistent  energy, and great erudition.    Sanskrit in his judgment constitutes an essential element of a liberal  education. While heartily admiring the employment of some of the best  talent and noblest genius of our age in the study of development in  the outward world, from the first growth of the earth and the  beginning of organic life to the highest stages, he pleads earnestly  that there is an inward and intellectual world also to be studied in  its historical development in strict analogy with the other, leading  up to the beginning of rational thought in its steady progress from  the lowest to the highest stages. In that study of the history of the  human mind, in that study of ourselves, our true selves, India  occupies a place which is second to no other country. Whatever sphere  of the human mind may be selected for special study, whether language,  religion, mythology, or philosophy, whether laws, customs, primitive  art or primitive science, we must go to India, because some of the  most valuable and most instructive materials in the history of man are  treasured up there, and there only. He inveighs most eloquently  against the narrowing of our horizon to the history of Greeks and  Romans, Saxons and Celts, with a dim background of Palestine, Egypt,  and Babylon, leaving out of sight our nearest intellectual relatives,  the Aryans of India, the framers of that most wonderful language the  Sanskrit, the fellow-workers in the construction of our fundamental  concepts, the fathers of the most natural of natural religions, the  makers of the most transparent of mythologies, the inventors of the  most subtle philosophy, and the givers of the most elaborate laws. It  is the purpose of historical study to enable each generation to  profit from the experience of those who came before, and advance  toward higher aims, without being obliged to start anew from the same  point as its ancestors after the manner of every race of brutes. He  who knows little of those who preceded is very likely to care little  for those coming after. \"Life would be to him a chain of sand, while  it ought to be a kind of electric chain that makes our hearts tremble  and vibrate with the most ancient thoughts of the Past, as well as  with the most distant hopes of the Future.\"    In no just sense is this an exaggeration. Deep as science and research  have explored, extensive as is the field which genius and art have  occupied, they have an Herculean labor yet to perform before India  will have yielded up all her opulence of learning. The literature of  the world in all ages has been richly furnished, if not actually  inspired, from that fountain. The Wisdom of the Ancients, so much  lauded in the earlier writings of Hebrews, Greeks, and Phoenicians,  was abundantly represented in the lore of these Wise Men of the East.    The first Ionian sages lighted the torch of philosophy at the altar of  Zoroaster. The conquest of Asia Minor by the Persians brought Thales,  Anaximenes, and Herakleitos into contact with the Eranian dogmas. The  leaven thus imparted had a potent influence upon the entire mass of  Grecian thought. We find it easy to trace its action upon opinions in  later periods and among the newer nations. Kant, Hegel, Stewart, and  Hamilton, as well as Plato, Zeno, and Aristotle, had their prototypes  in the world and antiquity beyond. Even the first Zarathustra was an  exponent and not the originator of the Religion and Science of Light.  We are thus carried by this route back to the ancient Aryan Home for  the sources from which so many golden streams have issued. In the  Sanskrit books and mantras we must look for the treasures that make  human souls rich. Perhaps we have been too much disposed to regard  that former world as a wonderland, a repertory of folk-lore, or a  theatre of gross and revolting superstition. We are now required by  candor and justice to revise such notions. These primeval peoples, in  their way and in a language akin to ours, adored the Father in heaven,  and contemplated the future of the soul with a sure and certain hope.    Nor did they, while observing the myriads of races intervening between  man and the monad, regard the world beyond as waste and void.  Intelligences of every grade were believed to people the region  between mortals and the Infinite. The angels and archangels, and the  spirits of the just made perfect--_devas_ and _pitris_ they called  them--ministered about the throne of the Supreme Being, and abode in  the various spheres of universal space. Much of the difference between  our thought and theirs consists in the names and not in the substance  of our beliefs.    We may thus be prepared to receive what India can teach us. In her  classic dialect, the Sanskrit, we may read with what success the  children of the men who journeyed from the ancient Aryan Home into the  Punjab and Aryavartta have ventured \"to look inward upon themselves,  upward to something not themselves, and to see whether they could not  understand a little of the true purport of that mystery which we call  life upon earth.\" It was perfectly natural, as well as perfectly  right, that as the beholder caught a glance of the Infinite Beyond,  the image impressed itself upon his sensorium, as would be the case  from looking at the sun, and he would as a result perceive that  Infinite in all that he looked upon. Thus to the Sanskrit-speaking  Aryan, as to the enlightened mind of to-day, not to see it was utter  blindness. What we call science, law, morality, religion, was in his  view pervaded alike throughout by this concept of Divine presence, or  else it would have been less than a dream that had not come to the  awaking. He was a follower of the light, not from the senses or the  logical understanding, but from the eternal world. Let us not dwell on  any darker shade of the picture. Clouds are dark to those who are  beneath them; but on the upper side, where the sun shines, they glow  with golden splendor. Let us be willing to contemplate India  fraternally, and upon that side where the radiance of the Divine sheds  a refulgent illumination.    ALEXANDER WILDER.    NEWARK, N.
