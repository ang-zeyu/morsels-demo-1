'If  the lady who fainted on Brixton bus'--she does not interest me.  'Every  day my heart longs--' Bleat, Watson--unmitigated bleat!  Ah, this is a  little more possible.  Listen to this:  'Be patient.  Will find some  sure means of communications.  Meanwhile, this column.  G.'  That is  two days after Mrs. Warren's lodger arrived.  It sounds plausible, does  it not?  The mysterious one could understand English, even if he could  not print it.  Let us see if we can pick up the trace again.  Yes, here  we are--three days later.  'Am making successful arrangements.  Patience and prudence.  The clouds will pass.  G.'  Nothing for a week  after that.  Then comes something much more definite:  'The path is  clearing.  If I find chance signal message remember code agreed--One A,  two B, and so on. You will hear soon.  G.'  That was in yesterday's  paper, and there is nothing in to-day's. It's all very appropriate to  Mrs. Warren's lodger.  If we wait a little, Watson, I don't doubt that  the affair will grow more intelligible.\"    So it proved; for in the morning I found my friend standing on the  hearthrug with his back to the fire and a smile of complete  satisfaction upon his face.    \"How's this, Watson?\" he cried, picking up the paper from the table.  \"'High red house with white stone facings.  Third floor. Second window  left.  After dusk.  G.'  That is definite enough. I think after  breakfast we must make a little reconnaissance of Mrs. Warren's  neighbourhood.  Ah, Mrs. Warren! what news do you bring us this  morning?\"    Our client had suddenly burst into the room with an explosive energy  which told of some new and momentous development.    \"It's a police matter, Mr. Holmes!\" she cried.  \"I'll have no more of  it!  He shall pack out of there with his baggage.  I would have gone  straight up and told him so, only I thought it was but fair to you to  take your opinion first.  But I'm at the end of my patience, and when  it comes to knocking my old man about--\"    \"Knocking Mr. Warren about?\"    \"Using him roughly, anyway.\"    \"But who used him roughly?\"    \"Ah! that's what we want to know!  It was this morning, sir.  Mr.  Warren is a timekeeper at Morton and Waylight's, in Tottenham Court  Road.  He has to be out of the house before seven. Well, this morning  he had not gone ten paces down the road when two men came up behind  him, threw a coat over his head, and bundled him into a cab that was  beside the curb.  They drove him an hour, and then opened the door and  shot him out.  He lay in the roadway so shaken in his wits that he  never saw what became of the cab. When he picked himself up he found he  was on Hampstead Heath; so he took a bus home, and there he lies now on  his sofa, while I came straight round to tell you what had happened.\"    \"Most interesting,\" said Holmes.  \"Did he observe the appearance of  these men--did he hear them talk?\"    \"No; he is clean dazed.  He just knows that he was lifted up as if by  magic and dropped as if by magic. Two at least were in it, and maybe  three.\"    \"And you connect this attack with your lodger?\"    \"Well, we've lived there fifteen years and no such happenings ever came  before.  I've had enough of him.  Money's not everything. I'll have him  out of my house before the day is done.\"    \"Wait a bit, Mrs. Warren.  Do nothing rash. I begin to think that this  affair may be very much more important than appeared at first sight.  It is clear now that some danger is threatening your lodger.  It is  equally clear that his enemies, lying in wait for him near your door,  mistook your husband for him in the foggy morning light.  On  discovering their mistake they released him. What they would have done  had it not been a mistake, we can only conjecture.\"    \"Well, what am I to do, Mr. Holmes?\"    \"I have a great fancy to see this lodger of yours, Mrs. Warren.\"    \"I don't see how that is to be managed, unless you break in the door.  I always hear him unlock it as I go down the stair after I leave the  tray.\"    \"He has to take the tray in.  Surely we could conceal ourselves and see  him do it.\"    The landlady thought for a moment.    \"Well, sir, there's the box-room opposite.  I could arrange a  looking-glass, maybe, and if you were behind the door--\"    \"Excellent!\" said Holmes.  \"When does he lunch?\"    \"About one, sir.\"    \"Then Dr. Watson and I will come round in time.  For the present, Mrs.  Warren, good-bye.\"    At half-past twelve we found ourselves upon the steps of Mrs. Warren's  house--a high, thin, yellow-brick edifice in Great Orme Street, a  narrow thoroughfare at the northeast side of the British Museum.  Standing as it does near the corner of the street,  it commands a view  down Howe Street, with its more pretentious houses.  Holmes pointed with  a chuckle to one of these, a row of residential flats, which projected  so that they could not fail to catch the eye.    \"See, Watson!\" said he.  \"'High red house with stone facings.' There is  the signal station all right.  We know the place, and we know the code;  so surely our task should be simple.  There's a 'to let' card in that  window.  It is evidently an empty flat to which the confederate has  access.  Well, Mrs. Warren, what now?\"    \"I have it all ready for you.  If you will both come up and leave your  boots below on the landing, I'll put you there now.\"    It was an excellent hiding-place which she had arranged.  The mirror  was so placed that, seated in the dark, we could very plainly see the  door opposite.  We had hardly settled down in it, and Mrs. Warren left  us, when a distant tinkle announced that our mysterious neighbour had  rung.  Presently the landlady appeared with the tray, laid it down upon  a chair beside the closed door, and then, treading heavily, departed.  Crouching together in the angle of the door, we kept our eyes fixed  upon the mirror. Suddenly, as the landlady's footsteps died away, there  was the creak of a turning key, the handle revolved, and two thin hands  darted out and lifted the tray from the chair.  An instant later it was  hurriedly replaced, and I caught a glimpse of a dark, beautiful,  horrified face glaring at the narrow opening of the box-room.  Then the  door crashed to, the key turned once more, and all was silence. Holmes  twitched my sleeve, and together we stole down the stair.    \"I will call again in the evening,\" said he to the expectant landlady.  \"I think, Watson, we can discuss this business better in our own  quarters.\"    \"My surmise, as you saw, proved to be correct,\" said he, speaking from  the depths of his easy-chair.  \"There has been a substitution of  lodgers.  What I did not foresee is that we should find a woman, and no  ordinary woman, Watson.\"    \"She saw us.\"    \"Well, she saw something to alarm her.  That is certain.  The general  sequence of events is pretty clear, is it not?  A couple seek refuge in  London from a very terrible and instant danger. The measure of that  danger is the rigour of their precautions. The man, who has some work  which he must do, desires to leave the woman in absolute safety while  he does it.  It is not an easy problem, but he solved it in an original  fashion, and so effectively that her presence was not even known to the  landlady who supplies her with food.  The printed messages, as is now  evident, were to prevent her sex being discovered by her writing. The  man cannot come near the woman, or he will guide their enemies to her.  Since he cannot communicate with her direct, he has recourse to the  agony column of a paper.  So far all is clear.\"    \"But what is at the root of it?\"    \"Ah, yes, Watson--severely practical, as usual!  What is at the root of  it all?  Mrs. Warren's whimsical problem enlarges somewhat and assumes  a more sinister aspect as we proceed.  This much we can say:  that it  is no ordinary love escapade.  You saw the woman's face at the sign of  danger.  We have heard, too, of the attack upon the landlord, which was  undoubtedly meant for the lodger.  These alarms, and the desperate need  for secrecy, argue that the matter is one of life or death.  The attack  upon Mr. Warren further shows that the enemy, whoever they are, are  themselves not aware of the substitution of the female lodger for the  male.  It is very curious and complex, Watson.\"    \"Why should you go further in it?  What have you to gain from it?\"    \"What, indeed?  It is art for art's sake, Watson.  I suppose when you  doctored you found yourself studying cases without thought of a fee?\"    \"For my education, Holmes.\"    \"Education never ends, Watson.  It is a series of lessons with the  greatest for the last.  This is an instructive case.  There is neither  money nor credit in it, and yet one would wish to tidy it up.  When  dusk comes we should find ourselves one stage advanced in our  investigation.\"    When we returned to Mrs. Warren's rooms, the gloom of a London winter  evening had thickened into one gray curtain, a dead monotone of colour,  broken only by the sharp yellow squares of the windows and the blurred  haloes of the gas-lamps.  As we peered from the darkened sitting-room  of the lodging-house, one more dim light glimmered high up through the  obscurity.    \"Someone is moving in that room,\" said Holmes in a whisper, his gaunt  and eager face thrust forward to the window-pane.  \"Yes, I can see his  shadow.  There he is again!  He has a candle in his hand.  Now he is  peering across.  He wants to be sure that she is on the lookout.  Now  he begins to flash.  Take the message also, Watson, that we may check  each other.  A single flash--that is A, surely.  Now, then.  How many  did you make it?  Twenty.  So did I.  That should mean T.  AT--that's  intelligible enough. Another T.  Surely this is the beginning of a  second word.  Now, then--TENTA. Dead stop.  That can't be all, Watson?  ATTENTA gives no sense.  Nor is it any better as three words AT, TEN,  TA, unless T. A. are a person's"]]]
