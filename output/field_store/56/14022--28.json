And so it was, that, while they were there, the days were accomplished  that she should be delivered. And she brought forth her first born  son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger;  because there was no room for them in the inn.    (_Exit_ PROLOGUE.)    (_Soft chimes. As these chimes die away in the distance a concealed  choir is heard singing._)         O COME, COME, AWAY.         O come, come away       From labor now reposing,       Let busy care a while forbear;       O come, come away.    (_The front curtains are drawn, showing a winter street in Bethlehem.  No one appears on the stage, but the choir continues singing outside  at right front._)         Come, come, our social joys renew,       And thus where trust and friendship grew,       Let true hearts welcome you,       O come, come away.    RACHEL _and_ PRISCILLA _enter from the inn at right front, arm in arm.  They go to the center, then to the rear of the stage, turn and face  the inn, pause a moment or two, listening to the choir, and then go  out at rear left. The choir continues:_         From toils and the cares       On which the day is closing,       The hour of eve brings sweet reprieve,       O come, come away.       O come where love will smile on thee,       And round its hearth will gladness be,       And time fly merrily,       O come, come away.    _While the choir is singing the last three lines of the song_, SIMEON  _and_ ISAAC _enter from rear left, leaning on their shepherd's crooks.  They pause at rear center and listen to the singing. When the song is  finished the organ continues the same music softly._    SIMEON.       Make haste, my son, the hour is waxing late,       The night is cold, methinks our sheep await.    ISAAC.       Nay gran'ther, I would liefer tarry here.       The town is gay, the inns are full of cheer.    SIMEON (_points to rear right_).       But there our duty lies, the wind grows cold!       Come, let's away and put the sheep in fold.    (_Starts off right._)    ISAAC.       Nay, Simeon, wait! What means this crowd of men       And women here in peaceful Bethlehem?    SIMEON (_comes to him_).       Herod the King hath issued a decree       That each and all his subjects taxed be;       And every one who in this town saw light       Must here return and register tonight.       From all Judea, aye, from th' distant land,       Each Bethlehemite must come at his command.    ISAAC (_comes to the doorway of the inn and peers in_).       The town is full of people, great and small,       Each inn is crowded to its very wall.    SIMEON (_comes down center and takes his arm_).       But come, we're wasting time, 'tis very late.       Make haste, my son, I know the flocks await!    ISAAC.       Thou speakest true, though I would rather stay,       Our duty calls, so to the hills, away!    (_They go out at rear right._)    _The concealed choir repeats the first stanza of the song softly.  After a slight pause_ DEBORAH _enters from the inn._    DEBORAH (_coming down to right front_).       My inn is crowded to the doors. The heat       Is stifling, but out here the air is sweet.    (_Looks upward._)         The bright stars twinkle with mysterious light,       Methinks there's something strange about the night.    _She sits on the bench in front of the inn._ TIMOTHY _enters from rear  left._ DEBORAH _continues her soliloquy._         The air is still, the night is very cold,       The shepherds seek the hills to watch the fold.    (_Sees him._)    (TIMOTHY _goes out at rear R._)    DEBORAH.       Some strange, unearthly voice seems calling me,       Methinks this night portends great things to be.    _Enter_ RACHEL _and_ PRISCILLA _from rear right, then come down center  and address the hostess._    RACHEL.       Hail, hostess of the inn, my cousin here       Hath lodgings at your inn. We'd seek its cheer.    DEBORAH (_rises_).       Enter within. My guests tonight are gay       And fain would turn this winter's night to day.    RACHEL _and_ PRISCILLA _enter the inn, followed by_ DEBORAH. _The  organ music continues softly. After a slight pause enter_ ANNA _from  rear left. She leads_ RUTH _and_ THOMAS _by the hand._    THOMAS (_at rear center_).       Oh, mother, hark! There's music in the inn!    ANNA.       'Tis not for us--their noise and merry din.    RUTH.       Our little town is crowded, joyous, gay.    THOMAS.       So many travelers came this way today.    RUTH.       The night is chill and cold, I much do fear       The little sheep will shiver by the mere.    ANNA.       Too cold it is for thee, I fear, in truth,       Return and get thy cloak, my little Ruth.       We'll wait for thee upon the little hill.    (_Points off R._)         But speed thy steps, the cold will work thee ill.    RUTH.       I'll fly, dear mother, like an arrow home.    (_Runs out at L._)    ANNA.       We must not tarry. Come, my Thomas, come!    (_She leads him out at rear R. There is a pause. The music changes to  a mysterious plaintive air. The old German song, Holy Night, may be  effectively introduced as an organ solo._)    _Enter from rear right,_ JOSEPH, _walking with a staff and supporting_  MARY.    MARY.       Here is a place, now I must rest awhile!       For many a league, for many a weary mile,       We've trudged along since break of day began.    JOSEPH.       'Tis true, and I'm an old and ancient man,       My joints are stiff, my bones are waxing old--       And the long night is bitter, bitter cold.       Here take my cloak and keep thee warm within,       And wait thee here while I search out an inn.    (_He wraps his cloak around her and seats her on the bench or stool in  front of the manger. He goes out at rear left. The music changes to  the Magnificat, to be found in all Episcopal hymnals._)    MARY (_sings_).       My soul doth magnify the Lord: and my spirit hath rejoiced in God         my Saviour.       For he hath regarded: the lowliness of his handmaiden.       For behold, from henceforth: all generations shall call me blessed.       For he that is mighty has magnified me: and holy is his Name.       And his mercy is on them that fear him: throughout all generations.       He hath showed strength with his arm: he hath scattered the proud         in the imagination of their hearts.       He hath put down the mighty from their seat: and hath exalted the         humble and meek.       He hath filled the hungry with good things: and the rich he hath         sent empty away.       He remembering his mercy hath holpen his servant Israel: as he         promised to our forefathers, Abraham and his seed, forever.    _Enter_ JOSEPH _from rear L._    JOSEPH.       For hours I've trudged the street in fruitless quest,       Here is an inn, mayhap at last we'll rest.    _Enter_ DEBORAH _from the inn._    MARY.       Husband, I'm faint; I can no farther go.       Methinks I'll rest me here upon this loe.    (_Sits in front of the manger._)    JOSEPH (_assisting her_).       Have courage, Mary, here's the hostess here.    (_Comes to_ DEBORAH _at right._)         We'd lodge with thee tonight.    DEBORAH.       Alas, I fear       My inn is crowded to the very wall,       Soldiers and scribes, the rich, the great, the small!    JOSEPH.       Is there room for us? My wife is ill.    DEBORAH.       My heart is sad and it is not my will       To send you hence, but naught is left to do.       Perhaps some other inn will shelter you.    JOSEPH.       Alas, the other inns are all the same!    DEBORAH.       Never was seen the like in Bethlehem.    (_Laughter and noise at R._)         My guests are merry, hear their jovial din!    (_Goes to R._)         I pity you, there's no room at the inn.    (_Exits into the inn._)    MARY.       Our last hope gone! Now, what shall we do?       My strength is leaving!    (_Bows head._)    JOSEPH.       Would I could succor you.       I'll wrap thee warm. Now rest thee here a while.       We've traveled far, full many a weary mile.    _Enter_ RUTH _from rear L., hurrying along._    JOSEPH.       Maiden, I fain would stop thee in thy flight--       Can'st tell where we could lodge this winter night?    RUTH.       That inn is crowded. There's one upon the hill.    JOSEPH.       I've tried them all, my wife is very ill.    RUTH.       That little stable there upon the loe,    (_Points to L front._)         'Tis snug and warm. 'Twill shield thee from the snow.    MARY (_rises_).       God's blessing on thy little head, sweet child!       Come, Joseph, for the wind now waxes wild.    (_Exits L. front._)    (JOSEPH _leads her to exit L., then turns and looks off R._)    JOSEPH.         O little town of Bethlehem,         How still we see thee lie!       Above thy deep and dreamless sleep         The silent stars go by.       Yet in thy dark streets shineth    (_Turns toward manger._)           The everlasting Light;       The hopes and fears of all the years         Are met in thee tonight.    (RUTH _stands at rear C., watching him._)    _The curtains slowly fall._      Scene II: _Hymn by the congregation._         WHILE SHEPHERDS WATCHED THEIR FLOCKS.         While shepherds watched their flocks by night,         All seated on the ground.       The angel of the Lord came down,         And glory shone around,         And glory shone around.         \"Fear not,\" said he,--for mighty dread         Had seized their troubled mind,       \"Glad tidings of great joy I bring,          To you and all mankind,          To you and all mankind.\"         \"To you in David's town this day,          Is born of David's line,       The Saviour, who is Christ, the Lord,         And this shall be the sign,         And this shall be the sign.\"         \"The heav'nly babe you there shall find         To human view displayed,       All meanly wrapped in swathing bands,         And in a manger laid,         And in a manger"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19831"],[0,"The Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government, Volume 1 (#2)"],[1,"declined by  Mr. Douglas.--The Election of Lincoln and Hamlin.--Proceedings in the  South.--Evidences of Calmness and Deliberation.--Mr. Buchanan's  Conservatism and the weakness of his Position.--Republican Taunts.--The  \"New York Tribune,\" etc.      CHAPTER VIII.
