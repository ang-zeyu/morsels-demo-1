This keeps the land fertile,  and makes up for the lack of rain.    Apart from its wonderful river, the country itself has no very striking  features. It is rather a monotonous land--a long ribbon of green running  through a great waste of yellow desert and barren hills. But the great  charm that draws people's minds to Egypt, and gives the old land a  never-failing interest, is its great story of the past, and all the  relics of that story which are still to be seen.    In no other land can you see the real people and things of the days of  long ago as you can see them in Egypt. Think how we should prize an  actual building that had been connected with the story of King Arthur,  if such a thing could be found in our country, and what wonderful  romance would belong to the weapons, the actual shields and helmets,  swords and lances, of the Knights of the Round Table, Lancelot and  Tristram and Galahad--if only we could find them. Out there in Egypt you  can see buildings compared with which King Arthur's Camelot would be  only a thing of yesterday; and you can look, not only on the weapons,  but on the actual faces and forms of great Kings and soldiers who lived,  and fought bravely for their country, hundreds of years before Saul and  Jonathan and David began to fight the battles of Israel. You can see the  pictures of how people lived in those far-away days, how their houses  were built, how they traded and toiled, how they amused themselves, how  they behaved in time of sorrow, how they worshipped God--all set down by  themselves at the very time when they were doing these things. You can  even see the games at which the children used to play, and the queer  old-fashioned toys and dolls that they played with, and you can read the  stories which their mothers and their nurses used to tell them.    These are the things which make this old land of Egypt so interesting to  us all to-day; and I want to try to tell you about some of them, so that  you may be able to have in your mind's eye a real picture of the life of  those long past days.          CHAPTER II    A DAY IN THEBES      If any foreigner were wanting to get an idea of our country, and to see  how our people live, I suppose the first place that he would go to would  be London, because it is the capital of the whole country, and its  greatest city; and so, if we want to learn something about Egypt, and  how people lived there in those far-off days, we must try to get to the  capital of the country, and see what is to be seen there.    Suppose, then, that we are no longer living in Britain in the twentieth  century, but that somehow or other we have got away back into the past,  far beyond the days of Jesus Christ, beyond even the times of Moses,  and are living about 1,300 years before Christ. We have come from Tyre  in a Phoenician galley, laden with costly bales of cloth dyed with  Tyrian purple, and beautiful vessels wrought in bronze and copper, to  sell in the markets of Thebes, the greatest city in Egypt. We have  coasted along past Carmel and Joppa, and, after narrowly escaping being  driven in a storm on the dangerous quicksand called the Syrtis, we have  entered one of the mouths of the Nile. We have taken up an Egyptian  pilot at the river mouth, and he stands on a little platform at the bow  of the galley, and shouts his directions to the steersmen, who work the  two big rudders, one on either side of the ship's stern. The north wind  is blowing strongly and driving us swiftly upstream, in spite of the  current of the great river; so our weary oarsmen have shipped their  oars, and we drive steadily southwards under our one big swelling sail.    At first we sail along through a broad flat plain, partly cultivated,  and partly covered with marsh and marsh plants. By-and-by the green  plain begins to grow narrower; we are coming to the end of the Delta,  and entering upon the real valley of Egypt. Soon we pass a great city,  its temples standing out clear against the deep blue sky, with their  towering gateways, gay flags floating from tall flagstaves in front of  them, and great obelisks pointing to the sky; and our pilot says that  this is Memphis, one of the oldest towns in the country, and for long  its capital. Not far from Memphis, three great pyramid-shaped masses of  stone rise up on the river-bank, looking almost like mountains; and the  pilot tells us that these are the tombs of some of the great Kings of  long past days, and that all around them lie smaller pyramids and other  tombs of Kings and great men.    But we are bound for a city greater even than Memphis, and so we never  stop, but hasten always southward. Several days of steady sailing carry  us past many towns that cluster near the river, past one ruined city,  falling into mere heaps of stone and brick, which our pilot tells us was  once the capital of a wicked King who tried to cast down all the old  gods of Egypt, and to set up a new god of his own; and at last we see,  far ahead of us, a huge cluster of buildings on both sides of the river,  which marks a city greater than we have ever seen.    As we sweep up the river we see that there are really two cities. On the  east bank lies the city of the living, with its strong walls and towers,  its enormous temples, and an endless crowd of houses of all sorts and  sizes, from the gay palaces of the nobles to the mud huts of the poor  people. On the west bank lies the city of the dead. It has neither  streets nor palaces, and no hum of busy life goes up from it; but it is  almost more striking than its neighbour across the river. The hills and  cliffs are honeycombed with long rows of black openings, the doorways of  the tombs where the dead of Thebes for centuries back are sleeping. Out  on the plain, between the cliffs and the river, temple rises after  temple in seemingly endless succession. Some of these temples are small  and partly ruined, but some are very great and splendid; and, as the  sunlight strikes upon them, it sends back flashes of gold and crimson  and blue that dazzle the eyes.    [Illustration: Plate 2  THE GODDESS ISIS DANDLING THE KING. _Page 18_]    But now our galley is drawing in towards the quay on the east side of  the river, and in a few minutes the great sail comes thundering down,  and, as the ship drifts slowly up to the quay, the mooring-ropes are  thrown and made fast, and our long voyage is at an end. The Egyptian  Custom-house officers come on board to examine the cargo, and collect  the dues that have to be paid on it; and we watch them with interest,  for they are quite different in appearance from our own hook-nosed,  bearded sailors, with their thick many-coloured cloaks. These Egyptians  are all clean shaven; some of them wear wigs, and some have their hair  cut straight across their brows, while it falls thickly behind upon  their necks in a multitude of little curls, which must have taken them  no small trouble to get into order. Most wear nothing but a kilt of  white linen; but the chief officer has a fine white cloak thrown over  his shoulders; his linen kilt is stiffly starched, so that it stands out  almost like a board where it folds over in front, and he wears a gilded  girdle with fringed ends which hang down nearly to his knees. In his  right hand he carries a long stick, which he is not slow to lay over the  shoulders of his men when they do not obey his orders fast enough.    After a good deal of hot argument, the amount of the tax is settled and  paid, and we are free to go up into the great town. We have not gone far  before we find that life in Thebes can be quite exciting. A great noise  is heard from one of the narrow riverside streets, and a crowd of men  comes rushing up with shouts and oaths. Ahead of them runs a single  figure, whose writing-case, stuck in his girdle, marks him out as a  scribe. He is almost at his last gasp, for he is stout and not  accustomed to running; and he is evidently fleeing for his life, for the  men behind him--rough, half-naked, ill-fed creatures of the working  class--are chasing him with cries of anger, and a good deal of  stone-throwing. Bruised and bleeding, he darts up to the gate of a  handsome house whose garden-wall faces the street. He gasps out a word  to the porter, and is quickly passed into the garden. The gate is  slammed and bolted in the faces of his pursuers, who form a ring round  it, shouting and shaking their fists.    In a little while the gate is cautiously unbarred, and a fine-looking  man, very richly dressed, and followed by half a dozen well-armed negro  guards, steps forward, and asks the workmen why they are here, making  such a noise, and why they have chased and beaten his secretary. He is  Prince Paser, who has charge of the Works Department of the Theban  Government, and the workmen are masons employed on a large job in the  cemetery of Thebes. They all shout at once in answer to the Prince's  question; but by-and-by they push forward a spokesman, and he begins,  rather sheepishly at first, but warming up as he goes along, to make  their complaint to the great man.    He and his mates, he says, have been working for weeks. They have had no  wages; they have not even had the corn and oil which ought to be issued  as rations to Government workmen. So they have struck work, and now they  have come to their lord the Prince to entreat him either to give command  that the rations be issued, or, if his stores are exhausted, to appeal  to Pharaoh. \"We have been driven here by hunger and thirst; we have no  clothes, we have no oil, we have no food. Write to our lord the Pharaoh,  that he may give us something for our sustenance.\" When the spokesman  has finished his complaint, the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22816"],[0,"The Adventures of Buster Bear (#2)"],[1,"catching _our_ fish!\"    \"I don't see how we are going to stop him,\" said Billy Mink.    \"I do!\" cried Little Joe, into whose head an idea had just popped. \"I'm  going to drive all the fish out of the little pools and muddy the water  all up. Then we'll see how many fish he will get! Just you watch me get  even with Buster Bear.\"    Little Joe slipped swiftly into the water and swam straight to the  little pool that Buster Bear would try next. He frightened the fish so  that they fled in every direction. Then he stirred up the mud until the  water was so dirty that Buster couldn't have seen a fish right under his  nose. He did the same thing in the next pool and the next. Buster Bear's  fishing was spoiled for that day.          III    BUSTER BEAR IS GREATLY PUZZLED      Buster Bear hadn't enjoyed himself so much since he came to the Green  Forest to live. His fun began when he surprised Little Joe Otter on the  bank of a little pool in the Laughing Brook and Little Joe was so  frightened that he dropped a fat trout he had just caught. It had seemed  like a great joke to Buster Bear, and he had chuckled over it all the  time he was eating the fat trout. When he had finished it, he started on  to do some fishing himself.    Presently he came to another little pool. He stole up to it very, very  softly, so as not to frighten the fish. Then he sat down close to the  edge of it and didn't move. Buster learned a long time ago that a  fisherman must be patient unless, like Little Joe Otter, he is just as  much at home in the water as the fish themselves, and can swim fast  enough to catch them by chasing them. So he didn't move so much as an  eye lash. He was so still that he looked almost like the stump of an old  tree. Perhaps that is what the fish thought he was, for pretty soon, two  or three swam right in close to where he was sitting. Now Buster Bear  may be big and clumsy looking, but there isn't anything that can move  much quicker than one of those big paws of his when he wants it to. One  of them moved now, and quicker than a wink had scooped one of those  foolish fish out on to the bank.    Buster's little eyes twinkled, and he smacked his lips as he moved on  to the next little pool, for he knew that it was of no use to stay  longer at the first one. The fish were so frightened that they wouldn't  come back for a long, long time. At the next little pool the same thing  happened. By this time Buster Bear was in fine spirits. It was fun to  catch the fish, and it was still more fun to eat them. What finer  breakfast could any one have than fresh-caught trout? No wonder he felt  good! But it takes more than three trout to fill Buster Bear's stomach,  so he kept on to the next little pool.    But this little pool, instead of being beautiful and clear so that  Buster could see right to the bottom of it and so tell if there were any  fish there, was so muddy that he couldn't see into it at all. It looked  as if some one had just stirred up all the mud at the bottom.    \"Huh!\" said Buster Bear. \"It's of no use to try to fish here. I would  just waste my time. I'll try the next pool.\"    So he went on to the next little pool. He found this just as muddy as  the other. Then he went on to another, and this was no better. Buster  sat down and scratched his head. It was puzzling. Yes, Sir, it was  puzzling. He looked this way and he looked that way suspiciously, but  there was no one to be seen. Everything was still save for the laughter  of the Laughing Brook. Somehow, it seemed to Buster as if the Brook were  laughing at him.    \"It's very curious,\" muttered Buster, \"very curious indeed. It looks as  if my fishing is spoiled for to-day. I don't understand it at all. It's  lucky I caught what I did. It looks as if somebody is trying to--ha!\" A  sudden thought had popped into his head. Then he began to chuckle and  finally to laugh. \"I do believe that scamp Joe Otter is trying to get  even with me for eating that fat trout!\"    And then, because Buster Bear always enjoys a good joke even when it is  on himself, he laughed until he had to hold his sides, which is a whole  lot better than going off in a rage as Little Joe Otter had done.  \"You're pretty smart, Mr. Otter! You're pretty smart, but there are  other people who are smart too,\" said Buster Bear, and still chuckling,  he went off to think up a plan to get the best of Little Joe Otter.          IV    LITTLE JOE OTTER SUPPLIES BUSTER BEAR WITH A BREAKFAST        Getting even just for spite      Doesn't always pay.    Fact is, it is very apt      To work the other way.    That is just how it came about that Little Joe Otter furnished Buster  Bear with the best breakfast he had had for a long time. He didn't mean  to do it. Oh, my, no! The truth is, he thought all the time that he was  preventing Buster Bear from getting a breakfast. You see he wasn't well  enough acquainted with Buster to know that Buster is quite as smart as  he is, and perhaps a little bit smarter. Spite and selfishness were at  the bottom of it. You see Little Joe and Billy Mink had had all the  fishing in the Laughing Brook to themselves so long that they thought no  one else had any right to fish there. To be sure Bobby Coon caught a few  little fish there, but they didn't mind Bobby. Farmer Brown's boy fished  there too, sometimes, and this always made Little Joe and Billy Mink  very angry, but they were so afraid of him that they didn't dare do  anything about it. But when they discovered that Buster Bear was a  fisherman, they made up their minds that something had got to be done.  At least, Little Joe did.    \"He'll try it again to-morrow morning,\" said Little Joe. \"I'll keep  watch, and as soon as I see him coming, I'll drive out all the fish,  just as I did to-day. I guess that'll teach him to let our fish alone.\"    So the next morning Little Joe hid before daylight close by the little  pool where Buster Bear had given him such a fright. Sure enough, just as  the Jolly Sunbeams began to creep through the Green Forest, he saw  Buster Bear coming straight over to the little pool. Little Joe slipped  into the water and chased all the fish out of the little pool, and  stirred up the mud on the bottom so that the water was so muddy that the  bottom couldn't be seen at all. Then he hurried down to the next little  pool and did the same thing.    Now Buster Bear is very smart. You know he had guessed the day before  who had spoiled his fishing. So this morning he only went far enough to  make sure that if Little Joe were watching for him, as he was sure he  would be, he would see him coming. Then, instead of keeping on to the  little pool, he hurried to a place way down the Laughing Brook, where  the water was very shallow, hardly over his feet, and there he sat  chuckling to himself. Things happened just as he had expected. The  frightened fish Little Joe chased out of the little pools up above swam  down the Laughing Brook, because, you know, Little Joe was behind them,  and there was nowhere else for them to go. When they came to the place  where Buster was waiting, all he had to do was to scoop them out on to  the bank. It was great fun. It didn't take Buster long to catch all the  fish he could eat. Then he saved a nice fat trout and waited.    By and by along came Little Joe Otter, chuckling to think how he had  spoiled Buster Bear's fishing. He was so intent on looking behind him to  see if Buster was coming that he didn't see Buster waiting there until  he spoke.    \"I'm much obliged for the fine breakfast you have given me,\" said Buster  in his deepest, most grumbly-rumbly voice. \"I've saved a fat trout for  you to make up for the one I ate yesterday. I hope we'll go fishing  together often.\"    Then he went off laughing fit to kill himself. Little Joe couldn't find  a word to say. He was so surprised and angry that he went off by himself  and sulked. And Billy Mink, who had been watching, ate the fat trout.          V    GRANDFATHER FROG'S COMMON-SENSE      There is nothing quite like common sense to smooth out troubles. People  who have plenty of just plain common sense are often thought to be very  wise. Their neighbors look up to them and are forever running to them  for advice, and they are very much respected. That is the way with  Grandfather Frog. He is very old and very wise. Anyway, that is what his  neighbors think. The truth is, he simply has a lot of common sense,  which after all is the very best kind of wisdom.    Now when Little Joe Otter found that Buster Bear had been too smart for  him and that instead of spoiling Buster's fishing in the Laughing Brook  he had really made it easier for Buster to catch all the fish he wanted,  Little Joe went off down to the Smiling Pool in a great rage.    Billy Mink stopped long enough to eat the fat fish Buster had left on  the bank and then he too went down to the Smiling Pool.    When Little Joe Otter and Billy Mink reached the Smiling Pool, they  climbed up on the Big Rock, and there Little Joe sulked and sulked,  until finally Grandfather Frog asked what the matter was. Little Joe  wouldn't tell, but Billy Mink told the whole story. When he told how  Buster had been too smart for Little Joe, it tickled him so that Billy  had to laugh in spite of himself. So did Grandfather Frog. So did Jerry  Muskrat, who had been listening. Of course this made Little Joe angrier  than ever. He said a lot of unkind things about Buster Bear and about  Billy Mink and Grandfather Frog and Jerry Muskrat, because they had  laughed at the smartness of Buster.    \"He's nothing but a great big bully and thief!\" declared Little Joe.    \"Chug-a-rum! He may be a bully, because great big people are very apt to  be bullies, and though I haven't seen him, I guess Buster Bear is big  enough from all I have heard, but I don't see how he is a thief,\" said  Grandfather Frog.    \"Didn't he catch my fish and eat them?\" snapped Little Joe. \"Doesn't  that "]]]
