And my  zest for self-exploration seems not to have been distracted by the  necessity of exploring a new outer universe. I embarked on a double  voyage of discovery, and an exciting life it was! I took note of  everything. I could no more keep my mind from the shifting, changing  landscape than an infant can keep his eyes from the shining candle  moved across his field of vision. Thus everything impressed itself on  my memory, and with double associations; for I was constantly  referring my new world to the old for comparison, and the old to the  new for elucidation. I became a student and philosopher by force of  circumstances.    Had I been brought to America a few years earlier, I might have  written that in such and such a year my father emigrated, just as I  would state what he did for a living, as a matter of family history.  Happening when it did, the emigration became of the most vital  importance to me personally. All the processes of uprooting,  transportation, replanting, acclimatization, and development took  place in my own soul. I felt the pang, the fear, the wonder, and the  joy of it. I can never forget, for I bear the scars. But I want to  forget--sometimes I long to forget. I think I have thoroughly  assimilated my past--I have done its bidding--I want now to be of  to-day. It is painful to be consciously of two worlds. The Wandering  Jew in me seeks forgetfulness. I am not afraid to live on and on, if  only I do not have to remember too much. A long past vividly  remembered is like a heavy garment that clings to your limbs when you  would run. And I have thought of a charm that should release me from  the folds of my clinging past. I take the hint from the Ancient  Mariner, who told his tale in order to be rid of it. I, too, will tell  my tale, for once, and never hark back any more. I will write a bold  \"Finis\" at the end, and shut the book with a bang!          THE PROMISED LAND      CHAPTER I    WITHIN THE PALE      When I was a little girl, the world was divided into two parts;  namely, Polotzk, the place where I lived, and a strange land called  Russia. All the little girls I knew lived in Polotzk, with their  fathers and mothers and friends. Russia was the place where one's  father went on business. It was so far off, and so many bad things  happened there, that one's mother and grandmother and grown-up aunts  cried at the railroad station, and one was expected to be sad and  quiet for the rest of the day, when the father departed for Russia.    After a while there came to my knowledge the existence of another  division, a region intermediate between Polotzk and Russia. It seemed  there was a place called Vitebsk, and one called Vilna, and Riga, and  some others. From those places came photographs of uncles and cousins  one had never seen, and letters, and sometimes the uncles themselves.  These uncles were just like people in Polotzk; the people in Russia,  one understood, were very different. In answer to one's questions, the  visiting uncles said all sorts of silly things, to make everybody  laugh; and so one never found out why Vitebsk and Vilna, since they  were not Polotzk, were not as sad as Russia. Mother hardly cried at  all when the uncles went away.    One time, when I was about eight years old, one of my grown-up  cousins went to Vitebsk. Everybody went to see her off, but I didn't.  I went with her. I was put on the train, with my best dress tied up in  a bandana, and I stayed on the train for hours and hours, and came to  Vitebsk. I could not tell, as we rushed along, where the end of  Polotzk was. There were a great many places on the way, with strange  names, but it was very plain when we got to Vitebsk.    The railroad station was a big place, much bigger than the one in  Polotzk. Several trains came in at once, instead of only one. There  was an immense buffet, with fruits and confections, and a place where  books were sold. My cousin never let go my hand, on account of the  crowd. Then we rode in a cab for ever so long, and I saw the most  beautiful streets and shops and houses, much bigger and finer than any  in Polotzk.    We remained in Vitebsk several days, and I saw many wonderful things,  but what gave me my one great surprise was something that wasn't new  at all. It was the river--the river Dvina. Now the Dvina is in  Polotzk. All my life I had seen the Dvina. How, then, could the Dvina  be in Vitebsk? My cousin and I had come on the train, but everybody  knew that a train could go everywhere, even to Russia. It became clear  to me that the Dvina went on and on, like a railroad track, whereas I  had always supposed that it stopped where Polotzk stopped. I had never  seen the end of Polotzk; I meant to, when I was bigger. But how could  there be an end to Polotzk now? Polotzk was everything on both sides  of the Dvina, as all my life I had known; and the Dvina, it now turned  out, never broke off at all. It was very curious that the Dvina should  remain the same, while Polotzk changed into Vitebsk!    The mystery of this transmutation led to much fruitful thinking. The  boundary between Polotzk and the rest of the world was not, as I had  supposed, a physical barrier, like the fence which divided our garden  from the street. The world went like this now: Polotzk--more  Polotzk--more Polotzk--Vitebsk! And Vitebsk was not so different, only  bigger and brighter and more crowded. And Vitebsk was not the end. The  Dvina, and the railroad, went on beyond Vitebsk,--went on to Russia.  Then was Russia more Polotzk? Was here also no dividing fence? How I  wanted to see Russia! But very few people went there. When people went  to Russia it was a sign of trouble; either they could not make a  living at home, or they were drafted for the army, or they had a  lawsuit. No, nobody went to Russia for pleasure. Why, in Russia lived  the Czar, and a great many cruel people; and in Russia were the  dreadful prisons from which people never came back.    Polotzk and Vitebsk were now bound together by the continuity of the  earth, but between them and Russia a formidable barrier still  interposed. I learned, as I grew older, that much as Polotzk disliked  to go to Russia, even more did Russia object to letting Polotzk come.  People from Polotzk were sometimes turned back before they had  finished their business, and often they were cruelly treated on the  way. It seemed there were certain places in Russia--St. Petersburg,  and Moscow, and Kiev--where my father or my uncle or my neighbor must  never come at all, no matter what important things invited them. The  police would seize them and send them back to Polotzk, like wicked  criminals, although they had never done any wrong.    It was strange enough that my relatives should be treated like this,  but at least there was this excuse for sending them back to Polotzk,  that they belonged there. For what reason were people driven out of  St. Petersburg and Moscow who had their homes in those cities, and had  no other place to go to? Ever so many people, men and women and even  children, came to Polotzk, where they had no friends, with stories of  cruel treatment in Russia; and although they were nobody's relatives,  they were taken in, and helped, and set up in business, like  unfortunates after a fire.    It was very strange that the Czar and the police should want all  Russia for themselves. It was a very big country; it took many days  for a letter to reach one's father in Russia. Why might not everybody  be there who wanted to?    I do not know when I became old enough to understand. The truth was  borne in on me a dozen times a day, from the time I began to  distinguish words from empty noises. My grandmother told me about it,  when she put me to bed at night. My parents told me about it, when  they gave me presents on holidays. My playmates told me, when they  drew me back into a corner of the gateway, to let a policeman pass.  Vanka, the little white-haired boy, told me all about it, when he ran  out of his mother's laundry on purpose to throw mud after me when I  happened to pass. I heard about it during prayers, and when women  quarrelled in the market place; and sometimes, waking in the night, I  heard my parents whisper it in the dark. There was no time in my life  when I did not hear and see and feel the truth--the reason why Polotzk  was cut off from the rest of Russia. It was the first lesson a little  girl in Polotzk had to learn. But for a long while I did not  understand. Then there came a time when I knew that Polotzk and  Vitebsk and Vilna and some other places were grouped together as the  \"Pale of Settlement,\" and within this area the Czar commanded me to  stay, with my father and mother and friends, and all other people like  us. We must not be found outside the Pale, because we were Jews.    So there was a fence around Polotzk, after all. The world was divided  into Jews and Gentiles. This knowledge came so gradually that it could  not shock me. It trickled into my consciousness drop by drop. By the  time I fully understood that I was a prisoner, the shackles had grown  familiar to my flesh.    The first time Vanka threw mud at me, I ran home and complained to my  mother, who brushed off my dress and said, quite resignedly, \"How can  I help you, my poor child? Vanka is a Gentile. The Gentiles do as they  like with us Jews.\" The next time Vanka abused me, I did not cry, but  ran for shelter, saying to myself, \"Vanka is a Gentile.\" The third  time, when Vanka spat on me, I wiped my face and thought nothing at  all. I accepted ill-usage from the Gentiles as one accepts the  weather. The world was made in a certain way, and I had to live in it.    Not quite all the Gentiles were like Vanka. Next door to us lived a  Gentile family which was very friendly. There was a girl as big as I,  who never called me names, and gave me flowers from her father's  garden. And there"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20897"],[0,"A Short History of England (#2)"],[1,"bull, is \"a  dumb ox of thought\"; a standing mystification in the mind. There is  something double in the thoughts as of the soul mirrored in many waters.  Of all peoples they are least attached to the purely classical; the  imperial plainness which the French do finely and the Germans coarsely,  but the Britons hardly at all. They are constantly colonists and  emigrants; they have the name of being at home in every country. But  they are in exile in their own country. They are torn between love of  home and love of something else; of which the sea may be the explanation  or may be only the symbol. It is also found in a nameless nursery rhyme  which is the finest line in English literature and the dumb refrain of  all English poems--\"Over the hills and far away.\"    The great rationalist hero who first conquered Britain, whether or no he  was the detached demigod of \"Caesar and Cleopatra,\" was certainly a Latin  of the Latins, and described these islands when he found them with all  the curt positivism of his pen of steel. But even Julius Caesar's brief  account of the Britons leaves on us something of this mystery, which is  more than ignorance of fact. They were apparently ruled by that terrible  thing, a pagan priesthood. Stones now shapeless yet arranged in symbolic  shapes bear witness to the order and labour of those that lifted them.  Their worship was probably Nature-worship; and while such a basis may  count for something in the elemental quality that has always soaked the  island arts, the collision between it and the tolerant Empire suggests  the presence of something which generally grows out of Nature-worship--I  mean the unnatural. But upon nearly all the matters of modern  controversy Caesar is silent. He is silent about whether the language was  \"Celtic\"; and some of the place-names have even given rise to a  suggestion that, in parts at least, it was already Teutonic. I am not  capable of pronouncing upon the truth of such speculations, but I am of  pronouncing upon their importance; at least, to my own very simple  purpose. And indeed their importance has been very much exaggerated.  Caesar professed to give no more than the glimpse of a traveller; but  when, some considerable time after, the Romans returned and turned  Britain into a Roman province, they continued to display a singular  indifference to questions that have excited so many professors. What  they cared about was getting and giving in Britain what they had got and  given in Gaul. We do not know whether the Britons then, or for that  matter the Britons now, were Iberian or Cymric or Teutonic. We do know  that in a short time they were Roman.    Every now and then there is discovered in modern England some fragment  such as a Roman pavement. Such Roman antiquities rather diminish than  increase the Roman reality. They make something seem distant which is  still very near, and something seem dead that is still alive. It is like  writing a man's epitaph on his front door. The epitaph would probably be  a compliment, but hardly a personal introduction. The important thing  about France and England is not that they have Roman remains. They are  Roman remains. In truth they are not so much remains as relics; for they  are still working miracles. A row of poplars is a more Roman relic than  a row of pillars. Nearly all that we call the works of nature have but  grown like fungoids upon this original work of man; and our woods are  mosses on the bones of a giant. Under the seed of our harvests and the  roots of our trees is a foundation of which the fragments of tile and  brick are but emblems; and under the colours of our wildest flowers are  the colours of a Roman pavement.    Britain was directly Roman for fully four hundred years; longer than she  has been Protestant, and very much longer than she has been industrial.  What was meant by being Roman it is necessary in a few lines to say, or  no sense can be made of what happened after, especially of what happened  immediately after. Being Roman did _not_ mean being subject, in the  sense that one savage tribe will enslave another, or in the sense that  the cynical politicians of recent times watched with a horrible  hopefulness for the evanescence of the Irish. Both conquerors and  conquered were heathen, and both had the institutions which seem to us  to give an inhumanity to heathenism: the triumph, the slave-market, the  lack of all the sensitive nationalism of modern history. But the Roman  Empire did not destroy nations; if anything, it created them. Britons  were not originally proud of being Britons; but they were proud of being  Romans. The Roman steel was at least as much a magnet as a sword. In  truth it was rather a round mirror of steel, in which every people came  to see itself. For Rome as Rome the very smallness of the civic origin  was a warrant for the largeness of the civic experiment. Rome itself  obviously could not rule the world, any more than Rutland. I mean it  could not rule the other races as the Spartans ruled the Helots or the  Americans ruled the negroes. A machine so huge had to be human; it had  to have a handle that fitted any man's hand. The Roman Empire  necessarily became less Roman as it became more of an Empire; until not  very long after Rome gave conquerors to Britain, Britain was giving  emperors to Rome. Out of Britain, as the Britons boasted, came at length  the great Empress Helena, who was the mother of Constantine. And it was  Constantine, as all men know, who first nailed up that proclamation  which all after generations have in truth been struggling either to  protect or to tear down.    About that revolution no man has ever been able to be impartial. The  present writer will make no idle pretence of being so. That it was the  most revolutionary of all revolutions, since it identified the dead body  on a servile gibbet with the fatherhood in the skies, has long been a  commonplace without ceasing to be a paradox. But there is another  historic element that must also be realized. Without saying anything  more of its tremendous essence, it is very necessary to note why even  pre-Christian Rome was regarded as something mystical for long  afterwards by all European men. The extreme view of it was held,  perhaps, by Dante; but it pervaded mediaevalism, and therefore still  haunts modernity. Rome was regarded as Man, mighty, though fallen,  because it was the utmost that Man had done. It was divinely necessary  that the Roman Empire should succeed--if only that it might fail. Hence  the school of Dante implied the paradox that the Roman soldiers killed  Christ, not only by right, but even by divine right. That mere law  might fail at its highest test it had to be real law, and not mere  military lawlessness. Therefore God worked by Pilate as by Peter.  Therefore the mediaeval poet is eager to show that Roman government was  simply good government, and not a usurpation. For it was the whole point  of the Christian revolution to maintain that in this, good government  was as bad as bad. Even good government was not good enough to know God  among the thieves. This is not only generally important as involving a  colossal change in the conscience; the loss of the whole heathen repose  in the complete sufficiency of the city or the state. It made a sort of  eternal rule enclosing an eternal rebellion. It must be incessantly  remembered through the first half of English history; for it is the  whole meaning in the quarrel of the priests and kings.    The double rule of the civilization and the religion in one sense  remained for centuries; and before its first misfortunes came it must be  conceived as substantially the same everywhere. And however it began it  largely ended in equality. Slavery certainly existed, as it had in the  most democratic states of ancient times. Harsh officialism certainly  existed, as it exists in the most democratic states of modern times. But  there was nothing of what we mean in modern times by aristocracy, still  less of what we mean by racial domination. In so far as any change was  passing over that society with its two levels of equal citizens and  equal slaves, it was only the slow growth of the power of the Church at  the expense of the power of the Empire. Now it is important to grasp  that the great exception to equality, the institution of Slavery, was  slowly modified by both causes. It was weakened both by the weakening of  the Empire and by the strengthening of the Church.    Slavery was for the Church not a difficulty of doctrine, but a strain on  the imagination. Aristotle and the pagan sages who had defined the  servile or \"useful\" arts, had regarded the slave as a tool, an axe to  cut wood or whatever wanted cutting. The Church did not denounce the  cutting; but she felt as if she was cutting glass with a diamond. She  was haunted by the memory that the diamond is so much more precious than  the glass. So Christianity could not settle down into the pagan  simplicity that the man was made for the work, when the work was so much  less immortally momentous than the man. At about this stage of a history  of England there is generally told the anecdote of a pun of Gregory the  Great; and this is perhaps the true point of it. By the Roman theory the  barbarian bondmen were meant to be useful. The saint's mysticism was  moved at finding them ornamental; and \"Non Angli sed Angeli\" meant more  nearly \"Not slaves, but souls.\" It is to the point, in passing, to note  that in the modern country most collectively Christian, Russia, the  serfs were always referred to as \"souls.\" The great Pope's phrase,  hackneyed as it is, is perhaps the first glimpse of the golden halos in  the best Christian Art. Thus the Church, with whatever other faults,  worked of her own nature towards greater social equality; and it is a  historical error to suppose that the Church hierarchy worked with  aristocracies, or was of a kind"]]]
