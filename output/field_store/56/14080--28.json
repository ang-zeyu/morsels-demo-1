Take more care of yourself, and let no one enter when we are  not with you.\"    Meanwhile, the Queen had reached home, and, going before her mirror, she  repeated her usual words:        \"Mirror, mirror on the wall,       Who is the fairest of us all?\"    and it replied as before:        \"The Queen was fairest yesterday;       Snow-White is fairest now, they say.       The Dwarfs protect her from thy sway       Amid the forest, far away.\"    As soon as it had finished, all her blood rushed to her heart, for  she was so angry to hear that Snow-White was yet living. \"But now,\"  thought she to herself, \"will I make something which shall destroy her  completely.\" Thus saying, she made a poisoned comb by arts which she  understood, and then, disguising herself, she took the form of an old  widow. She went over the seven hills to the house of the seven Dwarfs,  and knocking at the door, called out, \"Good wares to sell to-day!\"    Snow-White peeped out and said, \"You must go farther, for I dare not  let you in.\"    [Illustration]    \"But still you may look,\" said the old woman, drawing out her poisoned  comb and holding it up. The sight of this pleased the maiden so much  that she allowed herself to be persuaded, and opened the door. As soon  as she had bought something the old woman said, \"Now let me for once  comb your hair properly,\" and Snow-White consented. But scarcely was  the comb drawn through the hair when the poison began to work, and the  maiden fell down senseless.    \"You pattern of beauty,\" cried the wicked Queen, \"it is now all over  with you.\" And so saying, she departed.    Fortunately, evening soon came, and the seven Dwarfs returned, and as  soon as they saw Snow-White lying, like dead, upon the ground, they  suspected the Queen, and discovering the poisoned comb, they immediately  drew it out. Then the maiden very soon revived and told them all that  had happened. So again they warned her against the wicked stepmother,  and bade her open the door to nobody.    Meanwhile the Queen, on her arrival home, had again consulted her  mirror, and received the same answer as twice before. This made her  tremble and foam with rage and jealousy, and she swore that Snow-White  should die if it cost her her own life. Thereupon she went into an inner  secret chamber where no one could enter, and made an apple of the most  deep and subtle poison. Outwardly it looked nice enough, and had rosy  cheeks which would make the mouth of everyone who looked at it water;  but whoever ate the smallest piece of it would surely die. As soon as  the apple was ready the Queen again dyed her face, and clothed herself  like a peasant's wife, and then over the seven mountains to the house of  the seven Dwarfs she made her way.    She knocked at the door, and Snow-White stretched out her head and said,  \"I dare not let anyone enter; the seven Dwarfs have forbidden me.\"    \"That is hard on me,\" said the old woman, \"for I must take back my  apples; but there is one which I will give you.\"    \"No,\" answered Snow-White; \"no, I dare not take it.\"    \"What! are you afraid of it?\" cried the old woman. \"There, see--I will  cut the apple in halves; do you eat the red cheeks, and I will eat the  core.\" (The apple was so artfully made that the red cheeks alone were  poisoned.) Snow-White very much wished for the beautiful apple, and  when she saw the woman eating the core she could no longer resist, but,  stretching out her hand, took the poisoned part. Scarcely had she placed  a piece in her mouth when she fell down dead upon the ground. Then the  Queen, looking at her with glittering eyes, and laughing bitterly,  exclaimed, \"White as snow, red as blood, black as ebony! This time  the Dwarfs cannot reawaken you.\"    When she reached home and consulted her mirror--        \"Mirror, mirror on the wall,       Who is the fairest of us all?\"    it answered:        \"The Queen is fairest of the day.\"    [Illustration]    Then her envious heart was at rest, as peacefully as an envious heart  can rest.    When the little Dwarfs returned home in the evening they found  Snow-White lying on the ground, and there appeared to be no life in  her body; she seemed to be quite dead. They raised her up, and tried  if they could find anything poisonous. They unlaced her, and even  uncombed her hair, and washed her with water and with wine. But  nothing availed: the dear child was really and truly dead.    Then they laid her upon a bier, and all seven placed themselves around  it, and wept and wept for three days without ceasing. Then they prepared  to bury her. But she looked still fresh and life-like, and even her red  cheeks had not deserted her, so they said to one another, \"We cannot  bury her in the black ground.\" Then they ordered a case to be made of  glass. In this they could see the body on all sides, and the Dwarfs  wrote her name with golden letters upon the glass, saying that she was  a King's daughter. Now they placed the glass case upon the ledge on a  rock, and one of them always remained by it watching. Even the birds  bewailed the loss of Snow-White; first came an owl, then a raven, and  last of all a dove.    For a long time Snow-White lay peacefully in her case, and changed not,  but looked as if she were only asleep, for she was still white as snow,  red as blood, and black-haired as ebony. By and by it happened that a  King's son was traveling in the forest, and came to the Dwarfs' house  to pass the night. He soon saw the glass case upon the rock, and the  beautiful maiden lying within, and he read also the golden inscription.    When he had examined it, he said to the Dwarfs, \"Let me have this case,  and I will pay what you like for it.\"    But the Dwarfs replied, \"We will not sell it for all the gold in the  world.\"    \"Then give it to me,\" said the Prince; \"for I cannot live without  Snow-White. I will honor and protect her as long as I live.\"    When the Dwarfs saw that he was so much in earnest, they pitied him,  and at last gave him the case, and the Prince ordered it to be carried  away on the shoulders of his attendants. Presently it happened that  they stumbled over a rut, and with the shock the piece of poisoned  apple which lay in Snow-White's mouth fell out. Very soon she opened  her eyes, and raising the lid of the glass case, she rose up and asked,  \"Where am I?\"    Full of joy, the Prince answered, \"You are safe with me.\" And he told  to her what she had suffered, and how he would rather have her than any  other for his wife, and he asked her to accompany him home to the castle  of the King his father. Snow-White consented, and when they arrived  there they were married with great splendor and magnificence.    Snow-White's stepmother was also invited to the wedding, and when she  was dressed in all her finery to go, she first stepped in front of her  mirror and asked:        \"Mirror, mirror on the wall,       Who is the fairest of us all?\"    and it replied:        \"The Queen was fairest yesterday;       The Prince's bride is now, they say.\"    At these words the Queen was in a fury, and was so terribly mortified  that she knew not what to do with herself. At first she resolved not  to go to the wedding, but she could not resist the wish to see the  Princess. So she went; but as soon as she saw the bride she recognized  Snow-White, and was so terrified with rage and astonishment that she  rushed out of the castle and was never heard of again.    [Illustration]          THE UGLY DUCKLING    [Illustration]      It was beautiful in the country. It was summertime. The wheat was  yellow, the oats were green, the hay was stacked up in the green  meadows, and the stork paraded about on his long red legs, talking  in Egyptian, which language he had learnt from his mother.    The fields and meadows were skirted by thick woods, and a deep lake lay  in the midst of the woods. Yes; it was indeed beautiful in the country!  The sunshine fell warmly on an old mansion, surrounded by deep canals,  and from the walls down to the water's edge there grew large burdock  leaves, so high that children could stand upright among them without  being seen.    This place was as wild as the thickest part of the wood, and on that  account a Duck had chosen to make her nest there. She was sitting on  her eggs; but the pleasure she had felt at first was now almost gone,  because she had been there so long, and had so few visitors, for the  other Ducks preferred swimming on the canals to sitting among the  burdock leaves gossiping with her.    At last the eggs cracked one after another, \"Chick, chick!\" All the eggs  were alive, and one little head after another peered forth. \"Quack,  quack!\" said the Duck, and all got up as well as they could. They peeped  about from under the green leaves; and as green is good for the eyes,  their mother let them look as long as they pleased.    \"How large the world is!\" said the little ones, for they found their new  abode very different from their former narrow one in the egg-shells.    \"Do you imagine this to be the whole of the world?\" said the mother.  \"It extends far beyond the other side of the garden in the pastor's  field; but I have never been there. Are you all here?\" And then she got  up. \"No, not all, for the largest egg is still here. How long will this  last? I am so weary of it!\" And then she sat down again.    \"Well, and how are you getting on?\" asked an old Duck, who had come to  pay her a visit.    \"This one egg keeps me so long,\" said the mother. \"It will not break.  But you should see the others! They are the prettiest little Ducklings  I have seen in all my days. They are all like their father--the  good-for-nothing fellow, he has not been to visit me once!\"    \"Let me see the egg that will not break,\" said the old Duck. \"Depend  upon it, it is a turkey's egg.

The same may be said of other Amphipoda, such as _Urothoe inostratus_,  Dana, from South America, which so nearly resembles in form the _U.  elegans_ of the British shores.      GALATHEA DISPERSA, mihi.    _G._ rostro brevi, dentibus 4 utrinque ornato, 2 anterioribus minoribus;  pedibus anterioribus elongatis, sparse spiosus; chelarum digitis  parallelis.    Galathea with short rostrum, armed on each side with 4 teeth, the two  posterior being less important than the two anterior. The fingers of the  chelae impinge through their whole length; outer margin of the hand  furnished with 3 or 4 small spines.    _Hab._ Trawling-ground, Plymouth, common; Moray Frith, Scotland.    This species unites _G. Andrewsii_ with _G. nexa_, and, I think, has  often been mistaken for the young of the latter; but _G. nexa_, so far  as my experience goes, is a species peculiar to the north of England,  whereas _G. dispersa_, I anticipate, will be found to be the most  universally dispersed, in deep water, of any of the species known. It  can always be detected from _G. nexa_ by the form of the hand and the  manner in which the fingers impinge: in _G. nexa_ the hand is broad  towards the extremity, and the fingers meet only at the apex; in _G.  dispersa_ the hand gradually narrows to the apex, and the fingers meet  each other through their whole length, the inner margin of the finger  being finely serrated, the thumb not.    It also may be distinguished from _G. Andrewsii_ by the breadth of the  hands, which are narrow and round in _G. Andrewsii_, and moderately  broad and flat in _G. dispersa_.    By an examination of the texture of the integument under a magnifying  power of low degree, the surface of _G. dispersa_ will be seen  distinctly to differ from that of any of the others; it is covered with  flat scales, fringed with short cilia. The length of the animal,  including the arms, is about 2-1/4 inches.          Catalogue of Hymenopterous Insects collected at Celebes by Mr. A. R.  WALLACE. By FREDERICK SMITH, Esq., Assistant in the Zoological  Department, British Museum. Communicated by W. W. SAUNDERS, Esq.,  F.R.S., F.L.S.    [Read April 15th, 1858.]      This collection of the Hymenoptera of Celebes is specially interesting,  as adding greatly to our knowledge of the geographical range of many  well-known species, while the additions made to the Fossorial group  contain many of great beauty and rarity. A new species belonging to the  tribe of Solitary Wasps, _Odynerus clavicornis_, is perhaps the most  interesting insect in the collection; this Wasp has clavate antennae, the  flagellum being broadly dilated towards the apex, convex above and  concave beneath. I am not acquainted with any other insect belonging to  the Vespidious group which exhibits such an anomaly.      Fam. ANDRENIDAE, _Leach._    Gen. SPHECODES, _Latr._    1.
