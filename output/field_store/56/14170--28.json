The thick smoke was  in his nostrils. In his ears was the war-cry of the flames. He sprang to  the door of his lodge and saw the fiery river leaping down the mountain.  \"My people, my people,\" he cried, \"the flames are upon us!\" With cries  of fear the people in the village fled far away into the forest, and the  flames feasted upon the homes they loved.    The two hunters went to look upon the mountain, and when they came back,  they said sadly, \"There are no flowers on the mountain. Not a bird-song  did we hear. Not a living creature did we see. It is all dark and  gloomy. We know the fire is there, for the blue smoke still floats up to  the sky, but the mountain will never again be our friend.\"      PART III. THE BIRD OF FLAME    When the Great Spirit saw the work of the flames, he was very angry.  \"The fires of this mountain must perish,\" he said. \"No longer shall its  red flames light the midnight sky.\"    The mountain trembled with fear at the angry words of the Great Spirit.  \"O father of all fire and light,\" cried the Fire Spirit, \"I know that  the flames have been cruel. They killed the beautiful flowers and drove  your children from their homes, but for many, many moons they heeded my  words and were good and gentle. They drove the frost and cold of winter  from the wigwams of the village. The little children laughed to see  their red light in the sky. The hearts of your people will be sad, if  the flames must perish from the earth.\"    The Great Spirit listened to the words of the gentle Spirit of Fire, but  he answered, \"The fires must perish. They have been cruel to my people,  and the little children will fear them now; but because the children  once loved them, the beautiful colors of the flames shall still live to  make glad the hearts of all who look upon them.\"    Then the Great Spirit struck the mountain with his magic war-club. The  smoke above it faded away; its fires grew cold and dead. In its dark and  gloomy heart only one little flame still trembled. It looked like a  star. How beautiful it was!    The Great Spirit looked upon the little flame. He saw that it was  beautiful and gentle, and he loved it. \"The fires of the mountain must  perish,\" he said, \"but you little, gentle flame, shall have wings and  fly far away from the cruel fires, and all my children will love you as  I do.\" Swiftly the little thing rose above the mountain and flew away in  the sunshine. The light of the flames was still on its head; their  marvelous colors were on its wings.    [Illustration]    So from the mountain's heart of fire sprang the first humming-bird. It  is the bird of flame, for it has all the beauty of the colors of the  flame, but it is gentle, and every child in all the earth loves it and  is glad to see it fluttering over the flowers.          THE STORY OF THE FIRST BUTTERFLIES.      The Great Spirit thought, \"By and by I will make men, but first I will  make a home for them. It shall be very bright and beautiful. There shall  be mountains and prairies and forests, and about it all shall be the  blue waters of the sea.\"    As the Great Spirit had thought, so he did. He gave the earth a soft  cloak of green. He made the prairies beautiful with flowers. The forests  were bright with birds of many colors, and the sea was the home of  wonderful sea-creatures. \"My children will love the prairies, the  forests, and the seas,\" he thought, \"but the mountains look dark and  cold. They are very dear to me, but how shall I make my children go to  them and so learn to love them?\"    Long the Great Spirit thought about the mountains. At last, he made many  little shining stones. Some were red, some blue, some green, some  yellow, and some were shining with all the lovely colors of the  beautiful rainbow. \"All my children will love what is beautiful,\" he  thought, \"and if I hide the bright stones in the seams of the rocks of  the mountains, men will come to find them, and they will learn to love  my mountains.\"    When the stones were made and the Great Spirit looked upon their beauty,  he said, \"I will not hide you all away in the seams of the rocks. Some  of you shall be out in the sunshine, so that the little children who  cannot go to the mountains shall see your colors.\" Then the southwind  came by, and as he went, he sang softly of forests flecked with light  and shadow, of birds and their nests in the leafy trees. He sang of long  summer days and the music of waters beating upon the shore. He sang of  the moonlight and the starlight. All the wonders of the night, all the  beauty of the morning, were in his song.    \"Dear southwind,\" said the Great Spirit \"here are some beautiful things  for you to bear away with, you to your summer home. You will love them,  and all the little children will love them.\" At these words of the Great  Spirit, all the stones before him stirred with life and lifted  themselves on many-colored wings. They fluttered away in the sunshine,  and the southwind sang to them as they went.    [Illustration]    So it was that the first butterflies came from a beautiful thought of  the Great Spirit, and in their wings were all the colors of the shining  stones that he did not wish to hide away.          THE STORY OF THE FIRST WOODPECKER.      In the days of long ago the Great Spirit came down from the sky and  talked with men. Once as he went up and down the earth, he came to the  wigwam of a woman. He went into the wigwam and sat down by the fire, but  he looked like an old man, and the woman did not know who he was.    \"I have fasted for many days,\" said the Great Spirit to the woman. \"Will  you give me some food?\" The woman made a very little cake and put it on  the fire. \"You can have this cake,\" she said, \"if you will wait for it  to bake.\" \"I will wait,\" he said.    When the cake was baked, the woman stood and looked at it. She thought,  \"It is very large. I thought it was small. I will not give him so large  a cake as that.\" So she put it away and made a small one. \"If you will  wait, I will give you this when it is baked,\" she said, and the Great  Spirit said, \"I will wait.\"    When that cake was baked, it was larger than the first one. \"It is so  large that I will keep it for a feast,\" she thought. So she said to her  guest, \"I will not give you this cake, but if you will wait, I will make  you another one.\" \"I will wait,\" said the Great Spirit again.    Then the woman made another cake. It was still smaller than the others  had been at first, but when she went to the fire for it, she found it  the largest of all. She did not know that the Great Spirit's magic had  made each cake larger, and she thought, \"This is a marvel, but I will  not give away the largest cake of all.\" So she said to her guest, \"I  have no food for you. Go to the forest and look there for your food. You  can find it in the bark of the trees, if you will.\"    The Great Spirit was angry when he heard the words of the woman. He rose  up from where he sat and threw back his cloak. \"A woman must be good and  gentle,\" he said, \"and you are cruel. You shall no longer be a woman and  live in a wigwam. You shall go out into the forest and hunt for your  food in the bark of trees.\"    The Great Spirit stamped his foot on the earth, and the woman grew  smaller and smaller. Wings started from her body and feathers grew upon  her. With a loud cry she rose from the earth and flew away to the  forest.    And to this day all woodpeckers live in the forest and hunt for their  food in the bark of trees.          WHY THE WOODPECKER'S HEAD IS RED.      One day the woodpecker said to the Great Spirit, \"Men do not like me. I  wish they did.\"    The Great Spirit said, \"If you wish men to love you, you must be good to  them and help them. Then they will call you their friend.\"    \"How can a little bird help a man?\" asked the woodpecker.    \"If one wishes to help, the day will come when he can help,\" said the  Great Spirit. The day did come, and this story shows how a little bird  helped a strong warrior.    There was once a cruel magician who lived in a gloomy wigwam beside the  Black-Sea-Water. He did not like flowers, and they did not blossom in  his pathway. He did not like birds, and they did not sing in the trees  above him. The breath of his nostrils was fatal to all life. North,  south, east, and west he blew the deadly fever that killed the women and  the little children.    \"Can I help them?\" thought a brave warrior, and he said, \"I will find  the magician, and see if death will not come to him as he has made it  come to others. I will go straightway to his home.\"    For many days the brave warrior was in his canoe traveling across the  Black-Sea-Water. At last he saw the gloomy wigwam of the cruel magician.  He shot an arrow at the door and called, \"Come out, O coward! You have  killed women and children with your fatal breath, but you cannot kill a  warrior. Come out and fight, if you are not afraid.\"    The cruel magician laughed loud and long. \"One breath of fever,\" he  said, \"and you will fall to the earth.\" The warrior shot again, and then  the magician was angry. He did not laugh, but he came straight out of  his gloomy lodge, and as he came, he blew the fever all about him.    Then was seen the greatest fight that the sun had ever looked upon. The  brave warrior shot his flint-tipped arrows, but the magician had on his  magic cloak, and the arrows could not wound him. He blew from his  nostrils the deadly breath of fever, but the heart of the warrior was so  strong that the fever could not kill him.    At last the brave warrior had but three arrows in his quiver. \"What  shall I do?\" he said sadly. \"My arrows are good and my aim is good, but  no arrow can go through the magic cloak.\"    \"Come on, come on,\" called the magician. \"You are the man who wished to  fight. Come on.\" Then a woodpecker in a tree"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22430"],[0,"Evolution in Modern Thought (#2)"],[1,"nment.    A reference to Kant[6] should come in historical order after Buffon,  with whose writings he was acquainted, but he seems, along with Herder  and Schelling, to be best regarded as the culmination of the  evolutionist philosophers--of those at least who interested themselves  in scientific problems. In a famous passage he speaks of \"the  agreement of so many kinds of animals in a certain common plan of  structure\" ... an \"analogy of forms\" which \"strengthens the  supposition that they have an actual blood-relationship, due to  derivation from a common parent.\" He speaks of \"the great Family of  creatures, for as a Family we must conceive it, if the above-mentioned  continuous and connected relationship has a real foundation.\" Prof.  Osborn alludes to the scientific caution which led Kant, biology being  what it was, to refuse to entertain the hope \"that a Newton may one  day arise even to make the production of a blade of grass  comprehensible, according to natural laws ordained by no intention.\"  As Prof. Haeckel finely observes, Darwin rose up as Kant's Newton.[7]    The scientific renaissance brought a wealth of fresh impressions and  some freedom from the tyranny of tradition, and the twofold stimulus  stirred the speculative activity of a great variety of men from old  Claude Duret of Moulins, of whose weird transformism (1609) Dr. Henry  de Varigny[8] gives us a glimpse, to Lorenz Oken (1779-1851) whose  writings are such mixtures of sense and nonsense that some regard him  as a far-seeing prophet and others as a fatuous follower of  intellectual will-o'-the-wisps. Similarly, for De Maillet, Maupertuis,  Diderot, Bonnet, and others, we must agree with Professor Osborn that  they were not actually in the main Evolution movement. Some have been  included in the roll of honour on very slender evidence, Robinet for  instance, whose evolutionism seems to us extremely dubious.[9]    The first naturalist to give a broad and concrete expression to the  evolutionist doctrine of descent was Buffon (1707-1788), but it is  interesting to recall the fact that his contemporary Linnaeus  (1707-1778), protagonist of the counter-doctrine of the fixity of  species,[10] went the length of admitting (in 1762) that new species  might arise by inter-crossing. Buffon's position among the pioneers of  the evolution-doctrine is weakened by his habit of vacillating between  his own conclusions and the orthodoxy of the Sorbonne, but there is no  doubt that he had firm grasp of the general idea of \"l'enchainment des  etres.\"    Erasmus Darwin (1731-1802), probably influenced by Buffon, was another  firm evolutionist, and the outline of his argument in the  _Zoonomia_[11] might serve in part at least to-day. \"When we revolve  in our minds the metamorphoses of animals, as from the tadpole to the  frog; secondly, the changes produced by artificial cultivation, as in  the breeds of horses, dogs, and sheep; thirdly, the changes produced  by conditions of climate and of season, as in the sheep of warm  climates being covered with hair instead of wool, and the hares and  partridges of northern climates becoming white in winter: when,  further, we observe the changes of structure produced by habit, as  seen especially in men of different occupations; or the changes  produced by artificial mutilation and prenatal influences, as in the  crossing of species and production of monsters; fourth, when we  observe the essential unity of plan in all warm-blooded animals,--we  are led to conclude that they have been alike produced from a similar  living filament\".... \"From thus meditating upon the minute portion of  time in which many of the above changes have been produced, would it  be too bold to imagine, in the great length of time since the earth  began to exist, perhaps millions of years before the commencement of  the history of mankind, that all warm-blooded animals have arisen from  one living filament?\"... \"This idea of the gradual generation of all  things seems to have been as familiar to the ancient philosophers as  to the modern ones, and to have given rise to the beautiful  hieroglyphic figure of the [Greek: proton oon], or first great egg,  produced by night, that is, whose origin is involved in obscurity, and  animated by [Greek: Eros], that is, by Divine Love; from whence  proceeded all things which exist.\"    Lamarck (1744-1829) seems to have become an evolutionist  independently of Erasmus Darwin's influence, though the parallelism  between them is striking. He probably owed something to Buffon, but he  developed his theory along a different line. Whatever view be held in  regard to that theory there is no doubt that Lamarck was a  thorough-going evolutionist. Professor Haeckel speaks of the  _Philosophie Zoologique_ as \"the first connected and thoroughly  logical exposition of the theory of descent.\"[12]    Besides the three old masters, as we may call them, Buffon, Erasmus  Darwin, and Lamarck, there were other quite convinced pre-Darwinian  evolutionists. The historian of the theory of descent must take  account of Treviranus whose _Biology or Philosophy of Animate Nature_  is full of evolutionary suggestions; of Etienne Geoffroy St. Hilaire,  who in 1830, before the French Academy of Sciences, fought with  Cuvier, the fellow-worker of his youth, an intellectual duel on the  question of descent; of Goethe, one of the founders of morphology and  the greatest poet of Evolution--who, in his eighty-first year, heard  the tidings of Geoffrey St. Hilaire's defeat with an interest which  transcended the political anxieties of the time; and of many others  who had gained with more or less confidence and clearness a new  outlook on Nature. It will be remembered that Darwin refers to  thirty-four more or less evolutionist authors in his Historical  Sketch, and the list might be added to. Especially when we come near  to 1858 do the numbers increase, and one of the most remarkable, as  also most independent champions of the evolution-idea before that date  was Herbert Spencer, who not only marshalled the arguments in a very  forcible way in 1852, but applied the formula in detail in his  _Principles of Psychology_ in 1855.[13]    It is right and proper that we should shake ourselves free from all  creationist appreciations of Darwin, and that we should recognise the  services of pre-Darwinian evolutionists who helped to make the time  ripe, yet one cannot help feeling that the citation of them is apt to  suggest two fallacies. It may suggest that Darwin simply entered into  the labours of his predecessors, whereas, as a matter of fact, he knew  very little about them till after he had been for years at work. To  write, as Samuel Butler did, \"Buffon planted, Erasmus Darwin and  Lamarck watered, but it was Mr. Darwin who said 'That fruit is ripe,'  and shook it into his lap\" ... seems to us a quite misleading version  of the facts of the case. The second fallacy which the historical  citation is a little apt to suggest is that the filiation of ideas is  a simple problem. On the contrary, the history of an idea, like the  pedigree of an organism, is often very intricate, and the evolution of  the evolution-idea is bound up with the whole progress of the world.  Thus in order to interpret Darwin's clear formulation of the idea of  organic evolution and his convincing presentation of it, we have to do  more than go back to his immediate predecessors, such as Buffon,  Erasmus Darwin, and Lamarck; we have to inquire into the acceptance of  evolutionary conceptions in regard to other orders of facts, such as  the earth and the solar system;[14] we have to realise how the growing  success of scientific interpretation along other lines gave confidence  to those who refused to admit that there was any domain from which  science could be excluded as a trespasser; we have to take account of  the development of philosophical thought, and even of theological and  religious movements; we should also, if we are wise enough, consider  social changes. In short, we must abandon the idea that we can  understand the history of any science as such, without reference to  contemporary evolution in other departments of activity.    While there were many evolutionists before Darwin, few of them were  expert naturalists and few were known outside a small circle; what was  of much more importance was that the genetic view of Nature was  insinuating itself in regard to other than biological orders of facts,  here a little and there a little, and that the scientific spirit had  ripened since the days when Cuvier laughed Lamarck out of court. How  was it that Darwin succeeded where others had failed? Because, in the  first place, he had clear visions--\"pensees de la jeunesse, executees  par l'age mur\"--which a University curriculum had not made impossible,  which the _Beagle voyage_ made vivid, which an unrivalled British  doggedness made real--visions of the web of life, of the fountain of  change within the organism, of the struggle for existence and its  winnowing, and of the spreading genealogical tree. Because, in the  second place, he put so much grit into the verification of his  visions, putting them to the proof in an argument which is of its  kind--direct demonstration being out of the question--quite  unequalled. Because, in the third place, he broke down the opposition  which the most scientific had felt to the seductive modal formula of  evolution by bringing forward a more plausible theory of the process  than had been previously suggested. Nor can one forget, since  questions of this magnitude are human and not merely academic, that he  wrote so that all men could understand.      _As Regards the Factors of Evolution_    It is admitted by all who are acquainted with the history of biology  that the general idea of organic evolution as expressed in the  Doctrine of Descent was quite familiar to Darwin's grandfather and to  others before and"]]]
