The following pages were written as an exercise for my leisure hours,  while attending the Oneida Conference Seminary during the past winter.  As it is the first attempt that, to my knowledge, has ever been made to  reduce the Chippeway language to any system, it cannot be expected to be  otherwise than imperfect, and perhaps may hereafter be found to be, in  some respects, erroneous. It is, however, as free from errors as my  present means have enabled me to make it. It has been printed at the  request of my friends, by a fellow student, at his own suggestion and  expense.    J. SUMMERFIELD.    Cazenovia, April 10, 1834.          SKETCH OF GRAMMAR, &c.      The Letters used in the Chippeway Language, are twenty-one, viz.  A, a; B, b; C, c; D, d; E, e; G, g; H, h; I, i; J, j; K, k; M, m; N, n;  O, o; P, p; Q, q; S, s; T, t; U, u; W, w; Y, y; Z, z. F, L, R, V, and X,  are not used.    There are, in the Chippeway Language, ten parts of Speech, namely,  the _article_, the _noun_, the _pronoun_, the _adjective_, the _verb_,  the _participle_, the _adverb_, the _preposition_, the _conjunction_,  and the _interjection_.      OF THE ARTICLE.    There is but one Article, used definitely both in the masculine and  neuter genders, viz. Owh, the, m.; Ewh, the, n.      OF NOUNS.    A Noun is the name of any person, place, or thing; as, Eneneh, man;  Kahdahnahqueeng, Kingston; metig, tree.    Nouns are of two sorts, Common and Proper.    Common Nouns stand for kinds containing many sorts, or for sorts  containing many individuals under them; as, Ahwaseeh, animal; eneneh,  man; kegownh, fish; penaseh, bird.    Proper Nouns are the names appropriated to individuals, as, Charles,  Cazenovia, Ganges. [N.B. Proper names, with a few exceptions, are the  same as in English.]    To Nouns belong gender, person, number, and case.    GENDER.    Gender is the distinction of nouns with regard to sex.    Nouns have three genders, the masculine, the feminine, and the neuter.    The masculine gender denotes males; as, Eneneh, man.    The feminine gender is applied to animals, fishes, and birds; as,  Nahbak, a she bear, &c.    The neuter gender denotes things without sex; as, Wewahquon, a hat.    NUMBER.    Number is the distinction of objects as one or more.    Nouns are of two numbers, the singular and the plural.    The singular number implies but one object; as, Mahzenahegun, a book.    The plural number implies more than one; as, Mahzhenahegahnun, books.    CASE.    Nouns have three cases, the nominative, the possessive, and the  objective.    The nominative case simply expresses the name of a thing, &c.;  as, Owh quewesanceoobahkahmegezeh, the boy plays.    The possessive case expresses the relation of property or possession,  and always ends with the letter _o_; as, Noosayo wegewaum, my father's  house.    The objective case expresses the object of an action or of relation;  as John owejeahn Charles, John assists Charles.    Nouns may be declined in the following manner:                       Singular.          Plural.    _Nom. Case_,     Eneneh, man.       Enenewug, men.    _Poss. Case_,    Eneneho, man's.    Enenewugo, men's.    _Obj. Case_,     Eneneh, man.       Enenewug, men.      OF PRONOUNS.    A Pronoun is a word used instead of a noun, to avoid repeating the same  word; as, Pahpenatum eneneh, the man is happy; Pahpenatum, he is happy.    PERSONAL PRONOUNS.    There are three personal pronouns, viz. Neen, I; keen, thou; ween, he;  with their plurals, Nenahwind, we; kenahwah, ye or you; wenahwah, they.    Personal pronouns have person, number, gender and case.    The persons of pronouns are three in each number, viz.      Neen, I, is the first person,        }    Keen, thou, is the second person,    } Singular.    Ween, he, is the third person,       }    Nenahwind, we, is the first person,     }    Kenahwah, you, is the second person,    } Plural.    Wenahwah, they, is the third person,    }    _Number._--Pronouns have two numbers, the singular and the plural.    _Case._--Pronouns have three cases, the nominative, the possessive, and  the objective.    Pronouns cannot be declined. The cases of each person have the same  form.      First person.  _Singular._    _Plural._        _Nom._     Neen, I.       Nenahwind, we.        _Poss._    Neen, mine.    Nenahwind, ours.        _Obj._     Neen, me.      Nenahwind, us.      OF ADJECTIVES.    An Adjective is a word added to a noun to express its quality; as,  quahnoj eneneh, a good man; menwawezheh eneneh, an industrious man.    Adjectives are not varied to agree with their nouns, nor do they have  any regular comparison.    The following is a list of Numeral Adjectives:      Pazhick,                   1    Neezhe,                    2    Nesweh,                    3    Newin,                     4    Nahnun,                    5    Ingoodwahsweh,             6    Neswahsweh,                7    Shahsweh,                  8    Shongsweh,                 9    Metahsweh,                10    Metahsweh ahshepazhick,   11    ---- ahsheneezhe,         12    ---- ahshenesweh,         13    ---- ahshenewin,          14    ---- ahshenahnun,         15    ---- ahsheingoodwahsweh,  16    ---- ahsheneswahsweh,     17    ---- ahsheswahsweh,       18    ---- ahsheshongsweh,      19    Nestahnah,                20    Nestahnah ahshepachick,   21    ---- ahsheneezhe,         22    ---- ahshenesweh,         23    ---- ahshenewin,          24    ---- ahshenahnun,         25    ---- ahsheingoodwahsweh,  26    ---- ahsheneswahsweh,     27    ---- ahsheshahsweh,       28    ---- ahsheshongsweh,      29    Nesemetahnah,             30    Nemedahnah,               40    Nahnemedahnah,            50    Ingoodwahsemedahnah,      60    Neswahsemedahnah,         70    Swahsemedahnah,           80    Shonggahswehmedahnah,     90    Ingoodwak,               100    Nezhwak,                 200    Neswak,                  300    Newak,                   400    Nahnwak,                 500    Ingoodwahswak,           600    Nezhahswak,              700    Shawhswak,               800    Shongahswak,             900    Medahswak,              1000    Neezhemedahswak,        2000    Medahswehdahswak,     10,000    Nestahnahdahswak,     20,000    Nemedahnahdahswak,    40,000      OF VERBS.    A Verb is a word which signifies to be, to do, or to suffer; as,  Nedahyah, I am; Nedebahkoonewa, I rule; Nedebahkoonegoo, I am ruled.    Verbs are of three kinds, active, passive, and neuter.    A Verb Active expresses an action, and necessarily implies an agent  and an object acted upon; as, Nezhahgeah James, I love James.    A Verb Passive expresses passion or a suffering or the receiving of an  action, and implies an object acted upon, and an agent by which it is  acted upon; as, Chezhahwaneding, to be loved; John oojezhahwanemah  neen, John is loved by me.    A Verb Neuter expresses neither action nor passion, but being or a  state of being; as, Nenebah, I sleep; Nenahmahdub, I sit.    Verbs have number, person, mood and tense.    NUMBER AND PERSON.    Verbs have two numbers, the singular and the plural.    There are three persons in each number; as,      Pers.  _Singular._                   _Plural._      1.   Nezhahwanega, I love.         Nezhahwanegamin, we love.      2.   Kezhahwanega, thou lovest.    Kezhahwanegaim, you love.      3.   Zhawanega, he loves.          Zhahwanegawug, they love.    MOOD.    The moods are five, Indicative, Subjunctive, Imperative, Potential, and  the Infinitive.    The Indicative declares or affirms positively, or it asks a question;  as, Zhahwanega, he loves; Zhahwaneganah? Does he love?    The Subjunctive expresses action or passion in a doubtful manner;  as, Kespin zhahwanegaid, if he loves.    The Imperative is used for commanding, exhorting, and entreating;  as, Mahjahn keen, depart thou; Noodahmooyook, do thou listen.    The Potential implies possibility, liberty, power, will; as,  Tahgemewan kahnahbuge, it may rain; Kegahwesenemin kiya kahmenequamin,  we shall eat and drink.    The Infinitive simply expresses the signification of the verb;  as, Cheezechegang, to do; Chegegedoong, to speak.    TENSE.    Verbs have six tenses, the present, the imperfect, the perfect, the  pluperfect, the first and second future tenses.    The present tense represents a present action as taking place at the  time in which it is mentioned; as, Nebop, I laugh; Newob, I see;  Nedenadum, I think.    The imperfect tense denotes past action or event however distant,  finished, but without defining the exact time of its completion;  as, Oodanongezahbahneeg ahpe naquaskahwod, they were travelling to  the town when he met them.    The perfect tense refers not only to what is past but also conveys  an allusion to the present time; as, Ahzheh negegezhetoon  nemahzhenahegun, I have finished my letter.    The pluperfect tense represents a thing, not only as past, but also  as prior to some other point of time specified in the sentence;  as, Ahzehnegegezhetonahbun letter chebwabedahgweshing, I had finished  my letter before he arrived.    The first future tense represents the action as yet to come, either  with or without respect to the precise time when; as, Owh kezis  tahbemookahum wahbung, the sun will rise to-morrow.    The second future tense represents a future action that will be  accomplished before another future action; as, Negahwesenenahbun  nahwahquaig, I shall have dined at twelve o'clock.
