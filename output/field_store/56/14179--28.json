RESULTS OF THE FRENCH AND INDIAN WAR    [1763]    The results of the French and Indian War were out of all proportion to  the scale of its military operations. Contrasted with the campaigns  which were then shaking all Europe, it sank into insignificance; and the  world, its eyes strained to see the magnitude and the issue of those  European wars, little surmised that they would dictate the course of  history far less than yonder desultory campaigning in America. Yet here  and there a political prophet foresaw some of these momentous indirect  consequences of the war. \"England will erelong repent,\" said Vergennes,  then the French ambassador at Constantinople, \"of having removed the  only check that could keep her colonies in awe. They no longer stand in  need of her protection. She will call on them to contribute toward  supporting the burdens they have helped to bring upon her, and they will  answer by striking off all dependence.\" This is, in outline, the history  of the next twenty years.    The war in Europe and America had been a heavy drain upon the treasury  of England. Her national debt had doubled, amounting at the conclusion  of peace to 140,000,000 Pounds sterling. The Government naturally  desired to lay upon its American subjects a portion of this burden,  which had been incurred partly on their behalf. The result was that new  system of taxation which the king and his ministers sought to impose  upon the colonies, and which was the immediate cause of the Revolution.  The hated taxes cannot, of course, be traced to the French and Indian  War alone as their source. England had for years shown a growing purpose  to get revenue out of her American dependencies; but the debt incurred  by the war gave an animus and a momentum to this policy which carried it  forward in the face of opposition that might otherwise have warned even  George III. to pause ere it was too late.    [1765]    While the war thus indirectly led England to encroach upon the rights of  the colonies, it also did much to prepare the latter to resist such  encroachment. It had this effect mainly in two ways: by promoting union  among the colonies, and by giving to many of their citizens a good  training in the duties of camp, march, and battle-field.    The value to the colonists of their military experience in this war can  hardly be overestimated.

Also, the subject of vocal  registers is as vexing to-day as ever.    While, then, we may confidently expect further and more complete  elucidation of the physiology of the voice, there is yet sufficient data  to guide us safely in vocal training, if we neglect not the empirical  rules which the accumulated experience of the past has established.    The organ by which the singing-voice is produced is the larynx. It forms  the upper extremity of the windpipe, which again is the upper portion  and beginning of the bronchial tubes, which, extending downward, branch  off from its lower part to either side of the chest and continually  subdivide until they become like little twigs, around which cluster the  constituent parts of the lungs, which form the bellows for the supply of  air necessary to the performance of vocal functions. Above, the larynx  opens into the throat and the cavities of the pharynx, mouth, nose, and  its accessory cavities, which constitute the resonator for vocal  vibrations set up within the larynx.    The larynx itself consists of a framework of cartilages joined by  elastic membranes or ligaments, and joints. These cartilages move freely  toward and upon each other by means of attached muscles. Also the larynx  as a whole can be moved in various directions by means of extrinsic  muscles joined to points above and below.    The vocal bands are two ligaments or folds of mucous membrane attached  in front to the largest cartilage of the larynx, called the thyroid, and  which forms in man the protuberance commonly called Adam's apple; and,  extending horizontally backward, are inserted posteriorly into the  arytenoid cartilages, the right vocal band into the right arytenoid  cartilage and the left band into the left cartilage. These arytenoid  cartilages, by means of an articulation or joint, move freely upon the  cricoid, the second large cartilage of the larynx, forming its base, and  sometimes called the ring cartilage, from its resemblance in shape to a  seal ring. The vocal bands are composed of numberless elastic fibres  running in part parallel to each other, and in part interwoven in  various directions with each other. The fibres also vary in length; some  are inserted into the extending projections, called processes of the  arytenoid cartilages, and some extend further back and are inserted into  the body of the cartilages. The vocal bands, then, lie opposite each  other, on a level, raised a little in front, and with a narrow slit  between, called the glottis.    The muscles controlling the action of the vocal bands, and which  regulate the mechanism producing sound, are of three groups, viz.,  abductors (drawing-apart muscles), adductors (drawing-together muscles),  and tensors.    The abductors act to keep the bands apart during respiration, while the  function of the adductors and tensors is to bring the bands into  position for speech or singing. They are, since phonation is at will,  voluntary muscles; but it is an interesting fact that the laryngeal  muscles of either side invariably act together. It has been shown that  it is not possible to move one vocal cord without the other at the same  time executing the same movement. It is thus shown that the laryngeal  muscles are, to a less extent, under the control of the will than are  those of either hand or eye. The rational training of the singing-voice  cannot, therefore, proceed upon any theory based upon the voluntary  training of the muscles controlling the movements of the vocal cords.    The mucous membrane which lines the larynx is liberally supplied with  secreting glands, whose function is to keep the parts moist. Above the  vocal bands, another pair of membranous ligaments are stretched across  the larynx forming, with its sides and the vocal bands, a pouch or  pocket. The upper ligaments are sometimes called the false vocal cords,  but are more properly termed ventricular bands. Their function has  occasioned much speculation, but whatever modification of tone they may  be supposed to produce, they no doubt protect the true vocal bands and  permit their free vibration. The larynx, in the production of sound, may  be compared to an organ-pipe. The two vocal cords which act  simultaneously and are anatomically alike, when set in vibration by the  blast of air coming from the lungs, correspond to the reed of the  organ-pipe; the vibration of the cords, producing sound, which is  communicated to the air enclosed in the cavities of the chest and head.  Pitch of tone is determined by the rapidity of vibrations of the bands,  according to acoustical law, and the length, size, and tension of the  cords will determine the number of vibrations per second, _i.e._, their  rapidity.    Strength or loudness of tone is determined primarily by the width or  amplitude of the vibrations of the vocal membrane, and quality or timbre  is determined by the form of the vibration.    The infinitely varying anatomical divergencies in the form and structure  of the nasal, pharyngeal and throat cavities, and possibly the  composition of the vocal bands, modifies, in numberless ways, the  character of tone in speech or song. It is a fascinating topic, but must  be dismissed here with the remark that, as those anatomical differences  in structure are far less marked in children than in adults, their  voices are, in consequence, more alike in quality and strength. It takes  long, patient training to blend adult voices, but children's voices,  when properly used, are homogeneous in tone.    The voices of boys and girls, prior to the age of puberty, are alike.  The growth of the larynx, which in each is quite rapid up to the age of  six years, then, according to all authorities with which the writer is  conversant, ceases, and the vocal bands neither lengthen nor thicken, to  any appreciable extent, before the time of change of voice, which occurs  at the age of puberty.    It is scarcely possible, however, that the larynx literally remains  _unchanged_ through the period of the child's life, extending from the  age of six to fourteen or fifteen years. In point of fact, authorities  upon the subject refer only to the lack of growth and development in  _size_ of the larynx during the period; but _undoubtedly, during these  years, there is a constant gaining of firmness and strength, in both the  cartilages and their connecting membranes and muscles_. None of the  books written upon the voice have even mentioned this most important  fact. It bears with great significance upon questions relating to the  capacities of the child's voice at different ages, and explains that  phenomenon called the \"movable break,\" which has puzzled so many in  their investigations of the registers of the child's voice. The  constant, though of course extremely slow, hardening of the  cartilaginous portions of the larynx, and the steady increase in the  strength of its muscles and ligaments is not in the least inconsistent  with the previously noted fact, that the vocal bands during this time  increase to no appreciable extent in length; for, it may be observed,  after the change of voice, which often occurs with great rapidity, and  during which the vocal bands increase to double their previous length in  males, that, though the pitch of the voice, owing to increased length of  the bands, suddenly lowers, yet not until full maturity is reached, do  the laryngeal cartilages attain that rigidity, or the vocal bands that  ready elasticity essential to the production of pure, resonant voice.  Yet, during these years, while the voice is developing, the vocal bands  remain unchanged in _length_. Even in those cases where the voice  changes slowly in consequence of the slow growth in length and thickness  of the vocal cords, it takes several years, after laryngeal development  has ceased, for the voice to attain its full size and resonance.    Furthermore, the continual increase in strength and firmness of the  larynx from six years onward to puberty, is consistent with the constant  growth in strength and firmness of tissue characterizing the entire  body. It is again proven by the continual improvement in the power and  timbre of the tone through this period, always premising, be it  understood, that the voice is used properly, and never forced beyond its  natural capabilities. The voice, at the age of eleven or twelve, is far  stronger, and is capable of more sustained effort than at the age of six  or seven years, and, for the year or two preceding the break of voice,  the brilliance and power of boys' voices, especially in the higher  tones, is often phenomenal, and in all cases is far superior to that of  previous years.    The resemblance between the voices of boys and girls, a resemblance  which amounts to identity, save that the voices of boys are stronger and  more brilliant in quality, disappears at puberty.    Among the physical changes which occur at this period is a marked growth  of the larynx, sufficient to alter entirely the pitch and character of  the boy's voice. As a female larynx is affected to a lesser extent, the  voices of girls undergo little change in pitch, but become eventually  more powerful, and richer in tone.    This break of the voice, as it is called, occurs at about the age of  fifteen years in this climate, but often a year or two earlier, and not  infrequently a year or two later. The growth of the larynx goes on, with  greater or less rapidity, varying in different individuals, for from six  months to two or three years, until it attains its final size. In boys,  the larynx doubles in size, and the vocal bands increase in the  proportion of five to ten in length. This great gain in the length of  the vocal cords is due to the lateral development of the larynx, for the  male larynx, in its entirety, increases more in depth than in height.  The result is a"]]]
