It is not surprising  that I am hardly recognisable to some of the young eyes around me and  perfectly unknown to the youngest. But some of the older ones gaze with  astonishment and wonder at me, and seem at a loss to reconcile what they  see and what was pictured in their imaginations. I find them, too,  much grown, and all well, and I have much cause for thankfulness, and  gratitude to that good God who has once more united us.\"    My next recollection of my father is in Baltimore, while we were on  a visit to his sister, Mrs. Marshall, the wife of Judge Marshall. I  remember being down on the wharves, where my father had taken me to see  the landing of a mustang pony which he had gotten for me in Mexico, and  which had been shipped from Vera Cruz to Baltimore in a sailing vessel.  I was all eyes for the pony, and a very miserable, sad-looking object  he was. From his long voyage, cramped quarters and unavoidable lack of  grooming, he was rather a disappointment to me, but I soon got over  all that. As I grew older, and was able to ride and appreciate him, he  became the joy and pride of my life. I was taught to ride on him by Jim  Connally, the faithful Irish servant of my father, who had been with him  in Mexico. Jim used to tell me, in his quizzical way, that he and \"Santa  Anna\" (the pony's name) were the first men on the walls of Chepultepec.  This pony was pure white, five years old and about fourteen hands high.  For his inches, he was as good a horse as I ever have seen. While we  lived in Baltimore, he and \"Grace Darling,\" my father's favourite mare,  were members of our family.    Grace Darling was a chestnut of fine size and of great power, which he  had bought in Texas on his way out to Mexico, her owner having died on  the march out. She was with him during the entire campaign, and was  shot seven times; at least, as a little fellow I used to brag about that  number of bullets being in her, and since I could point out the scars of  each one, I presume it was so. My father was very much attached to her  and proud of her, always petting her and talking to her in a loving way,  when he rode her or went to see her in her stall. Of her he wrote on his  return home:    \"I only arrived yesterday, after a long journey up the Mississippi,  which route I was induced to take, for the better accommodation of  my horse, as I wished to spare her as much annoyance and fatigue as  possible, she already having undergone so much suffering in my service.  I landed her at Wheeling and left her to come over with Jim.\"    Santa Anna was found lying cold and dead in the park at Arlington one  morning in the winter of '60-'61. Grace Darling was taken in the spring  of '62 from the White House [My brother's place on the Pamunkey River,  where the mare had been sent for save keeping.\"] by some Federal  quartermaster, when McClellan occupied that place as his base of  supplies during his attack on Richmond. When we lived in Baltimore, I  was greatly struck one day by hearing two ladies who were visiting us  saying:    \"Everybody and everything--his family, his friends, his horse, and his  dog--loves Colonel Lee.\"    The dog referred to was a black-and-tan terrier named \"Spec,\" very  bright and intelligent and really a member of the family, respected and  beloved by ourselves and well known to all who knew us. My father picked  up his mother in the \"Narrows\" while crossing from Fort Hamilton to  the fortifications opposite on Staten Island. She had doubtless fallen  overboard from some passing vessel and had drifted out of sight before  her absence had been discovered. He rescued her and took her home, where  she was welcomed by his children an made much of. She was a handsome  little thing, with cropped ears and a short tail. My father named her  \"Dart.\" She was a fine ratter, and with the assistance of a Maltese cat,  also a member of the family, the many rats which infested the house and  stables were driven away or destroyed. She and the cat were fed out of  the same plate, but Dart was not allowed to begin the meal until the cat  had finished.    Spec was born at Fort Hamilton and was the joy of us children, our  pet and companion. My father would not allow his tail and ears to be  cropped. When he grew up, he accompanied us everywhere and was in the  habit of going into church with the family. As some of the little ones  allowed their devotions to be disturbed by Spec's presence, my father  determined to leave him at home on those occasions. So the next Sunday  morning, he was sent up to the front room of the second story. After the  family had left for church he contented himself for awhile looking  out of the window, which was open, it being summer time. Presently  impatience overcame his judgement and he jumped to the ground, landed  safely notwithstanding the distance, joined the family just as they  reached the church, and went in with them as usual, much to the joy  of the children. After that he was allowed to go to church whenever he  wished. My father was very fond of him, and loved to talk to him and  about him as if he were really one of us. In a letter to my mother,  dated Fort Hamilton, January 18, 1846, when she and her children were on  a visit to Arlington, he thus speaks of him:    \"...I am very solitary, and my only company is my dogs and cats. But  'Spec' has become so jealous now that he will hardly let me look at the  cats. He seems to be afraid that I am going off from him, and never lets  me stir without him. Lies down in the office from eight to four without  moving, and turns himself before the fire as the side from it becomes  cold. I catch him sometimes sitting up looking at me so intently that I  am for a moment startled...\"    In a letter from Mexico written a year later--December 25, '46, to my  mother, he says:    \"...Can't you cure poor 'Spec.' Cheer him up--take him to walk with you  and tell the children to cheer him up...\"    In another letter from Mexico to his eldest boy, just after the capture  of Vera Cruz, he sends this message to Spec....    \"Tell him I wish he was here with me. He would have been of great  service in telling me when I was coming upon the Mexicans. When I  was reconnoitering around Vera Cruz, their dogs frequently told me by  barking when I was approaching them too nearly....\"    When he returned to Arlington from Mexico, Spec was the first to  recognise him, and the extravagance of his demonstrations of delight  left no doubt that he knew at once his kind master and loving friend,  though he had been absent three years. Sometime during our residence in  Baltimore, Spec disappeared, and we never knew his fate.    From that early time I began to be impressed with my father's character,  as compared with other men. Every member of the household respected,  revered and loved him as a matter of course, but it began to dawn on  me that every one else with whom I was thrown held him high in their  regard. At forty-five years of age he was active, strong, and as  handsome as he had ever been. I never remember his being ill. I presume  he was indisposed at times; but no impressions of that kind remain. He  was always bright and gay with us little folk, romping, playing, and  joking with us. With the older children, he was just as companionable,  and the have seen him join my elder brothers and their friends when  they would try their powers at a high jump put up in our yard. The two  younger children he petted a great deal, and our greatest treat was to  get into his bed in the morning and lie close to him, listening while  he talked to us in his bright, entertaining way. This custom we kept  up until I was ten years old and over. Although he was so joyous and  familiar with us, he was very firm on all proper occasions, never  indulged us in anything that was not good for us, and exacted the most  implicit obedience. I always knew that it was impossible to disobey my  father. I felt it in me, I never thought why, but was perfectly sure  when he gave an order that it had to be obeyed. My mother I could  sometimes circumvent, and at times took liberties with her orders,  construing them to suit myself; but exact obedience to every mandate of  my father was part of my life and being at that time. He was very  fond of having his hands tickled, and, what was still more curious, it  pleased and delighted him to take off his slippers and place his feet in  our laps in order to have them tickled. Often, as little things, after  romping all day, the enforced sitting would be too much for us, and our  drowsiness would soon show itself in continued nods. Then, to arouse,  us, he had a way of stirring us up with his foot--laughing heartily at  and with us. He would often tell us the most delightful stories, and  then there was no nodding. Sometimes, however, our interest in his  wonderful tales became so engrossing that we would forget to do our  duty--when he would declare, \"No tickling, no story!\" When we were a  little older, our elder sister told us one winter the ever-delightful  \"Lady of the Lake.\" Of course, she told it in prose and arranged it to  suit our mental capacity. Our father was generally in his corner by the  fire, most probably with a foot in either the lap of myself or youngest  sister--the tickling going on briskly--and would come in at different  points of the tale and repeat line after line of the poem--much to our  disapproval--but to his great enjoyment.    In January, 1849, Captain Lee was one of a board of army officers  appointed to examine the coasts of Florida and its defenses and to  recommend locations for new fortifications. In April he was assigned  to the duty of the construction of Fort Carroll, in the Patapsco River  below Baltimore. He was there, I think, for three years, and lived in  a house on Madison Street, three doors above Biddle. I used to go down  with him to the Fort quite often. We went to the wharf in a \"bus"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23245"],[0,"Ancient Ballads and Legends of Hindustan (#2)"],[1,"that is discord in an English ear. The notes are no  less curious, and to a stranger no less bewildering. Nothing could be  more naive than the writer's ignorance at some points, or more startling  than her learning at others. On the whole, the attainment of the book  was simply astounding. It consisted of a selection of translations from  nearly one hundred French poets, chosen by the poetess herself on a  principle of her own which gradually dawned upon the careful reader. She  eschewed the Classicist writers as though they had never existed. For  her Andre Chenier was the next name in chronological order after Du  Bartas. Occasionally she showed a profundity of research that would have  done no discredit to Mr. Saintsbury or \"le doux Assellineau.\" She was  ready to pronounce an opinion on Napol le Pyrenean or to detect a  plagiarism in Baudelaire. But she thought that Alexander Smith was still  alive, and she was curiously vague about the career of Saint Beuve.  This inequality of equipment was a thing inevitable to her isolation,  and hardly worth recording, except to show how laborious her mind was,  and how quick to make the best of small resources.    We have already seen that the \"Sheaf gleaned in French Fields\" attracted  the very minimum of attention in England. In France it was talked about  a little more. M. Garcin de Tassy, the famous Orientalist, who scarcely  survived Toru by twelve months, spoke of it to Mlle. Clarisse Bader,  author of a somewhat remarkable book on the position of women in ancient  Indian society. Almost simultaneously this volume fell into the hands of  Toru, and she was moved to translate it into English, for the use of  Hindus less instructed than herself. In January, 1877, she accordingly  wrote to Mlle. Bader requesting her authorization, and received a prompt  and kind reply. On the 18th of March Toru wrote again to this, her  solitary correspondent in the world of European literature, and her  letter, which has been preserved, shows that she had already descended  into the valley of the shadow of death:--        Ma constitution n'est pas forte; j'ai contracte une toux opiniatre,      il y a plus de deux ans, qui ne me quitte point. Cependant j'espere      mettre la main a l'[oe]uvre bientot. Je ne peux dire, mademoiselle,      combien votre affection,--car vous les aimez, votre livre et votre      lettre en temoignent assez,--pour mes compatriotes et mon pays me      touche; et je suis fiere de pouvoir le dire que les heroines de nos      grandes epopees sont dignes de tout honneur et de tout amour. Y      a-ti-il d'heroine plus touchante, plus aimable que Sita? Je ne le      crois pas. _Quand j'entends ma mere chanter, le soir, les vieux      chants de notre pays, je pleure presque toujours._ La plainte de      Sita, quand, bannie pour la seconde fois, elle erre dans la vaste      foret, seule, le desespoir et l'effroi dans l'ame, est si pathetique      qu'il n'y a personne, je crois, qui puisse l'entendre sans verser      des larmes. Je vous envois sous ce pli deux petites traductions du      Sanscrit, cette belle langue antique. Malheureusement j'ai ete      obligee de faire cesser mes traductions de Sanscrit, il y a six      mois. Ma sante ne me permet pas de les continuer.    These simple and pathetic words, in which the dying poetess pours out  her heart to the one friend she had, and that one gained too late, seem  as touching and as beautiful as any strain of Marceline Valmore's  immortal verse. In English poetry I do not remember anything that  exactly parallels their resigned melancholy. Before the month of March  was over, Toru had taken to her bed. Unable to write, she continued to  read, strewing her sick-room with the latest European books, and  entering with interest into the questions raised by the Societe  Asiatique of Paris in its printed Transactions. On the 30th of July she  wrote her last letter to Mlle. Clarisse Bader, and a month later, on the  30th of August, 1877, at the age of twenty-one years, six months, and  twenty-six days, she breathed her last in her father's house in  Maniktollah Street, Calcutta.    In the first distraction of grief it seemed as though her unequalled  promise had been entirely blighted, and as though she would be  remembered only by her single book. But as her father examined her  papers, one completed work after another revealed itself. First a  selection from the sonnets of the Comte de Grammont, translated into  English, turned up, and was printed in a Calcutta magazine; then some  fragments of an English story, which were printed in another Calcutta  magazine. Much more important, however, than any of these was a complete  romance, written in French, being the identical story for which her  sister Aru had proposed to make the illustrations. In the meantime Toru  was no sooner dead than she began to be famous. In May, 1878, there  appeared a second edition of the \"Sheaf gleaned in French Fields,\" with  a touching sketch of her death, by her father; and in 1879 was  published, under the editorial care of Mlle. Clarisse Bader, the romance  of \"Le Journal de Mlle. D'Arvers,\" forming a handsome volume of 259  pages. This book, begun, as it appears, before the family returned from  Europe, and finished nobody knows when, is an attempt to describe scenes  from modern French society, but it is less interesting as an experiment  of the fancy, than as a revelation of the mind of a young Hindu woman of  genius. The story is simple, clearly told, and interesting; the studies  of character have nothing French about them, but they are full of vigour  and originality. The description of the hero is most characteristically  Indian.--        Il est beau en effet. Sa taille est haute, mais quelques-uns la      trouveraient mince, sa chevelure noire est bouclee et tombe jusqu'a      la nuque; ses yeux noirs sont profonds et bien fendus, le front est      noble; la levre superieure, couverte par une moustache naissante et      noire, est parfaitement modelee; son menton a quelque chose de      severe; son teint est d'un blanc presque feminin, ce qui denote sa      haute naissance.    In this description we seem to recognize some Surya or Soma of Hindu  mythology, and the final touch, meaningless as applied to an European,  reminds us that in India whiteness of skin has always been a sign of  aristocratic birth, from the days when it originally distinguished the  conquering Aryas from the indigenous race of the Dasyous.    As a literary composition \"Mlle. D'Arvers\" deserves high commendation.  It deals with the ungovernable passion of two brothers for one placid  and beautiful girl, a passion which leads to fratricide and madness.  That it is a very melancholy and tragical story is obvious from this  brief sketch of its contents, but it is remarkable for coherence and  self-restraint no less than for vigour of treatment. Toru Dutt never  sinks to melodrama in the course of her extraordinary tale, and the  wonder is that she is not more often fantastic and unreal.    But we believe that the original English poems, which we present to the  public for the first time to-day, will be ultimately found to  constitute Toru's chief legacy to posterity. These ballads form the last  and most matured of her writings, and were left so far fragmentary at  her death that the fourth and fifth in her projected series of nine were  not to be discovered in any form among her papers. It is probable that  she had not even commenced them. Her father, therefore, to give a  certain continuity to the series, has filled up these blanks with two  stories from the \"Vishnupurana,\" which originally appeared respectively  in the \"Calcutta Review\" and in the \"Bengal Magazine.\" These are  interesting, but a little rude in form, and they have not the same  peculiar value as the rhymed octo-syllabic ballads. In these last we see  Toru no longer attempting vainly, though heroically, to compete with  European literature on its own ground, but turning to the legends of her  own race and country for inspiration. No modern Oriental has given us  so strange an insight into the conscience of the Asiatic as is presented  in the stories of \"Prehlad\" and of \"Savitri,\" or so quaint a piece of  religious fancy as the ballad of \"Jogadhya Uma.\" The poetess seems in  these verses to be chanting to herself those songs of her mother's race  to which she always turned with tears of pleasure. They breathe a Vedic  solemnity and simplicity of temper, and are singularly devoid of that  littleness and frivolity which seem, if we may judge by a slight  experience, to be the bane of modern India.    As to the merely technical character of these poems, it may be suggested  that in spite of much in them that is rough and inchoate, they show that  Toru was advancing in her mastery of English verse. Such a stanza as  this, selected out of many no less skilful, could hardly be recognized  as the work of one by whom the language was a late acquirement:--        What glorious trees! The sombre saul,        On which the eye delights to rest,--      The betel-nut, a pillar tall,        With feathery branches for a crest,--      The light-leaved tamarind spreading wide,--        The pale faint-scented bitter neem,      The seemul, gorgeous as a bride,        With flowers that have the ruby's gleam.    In other passages, of course, the text reads like a translation from  some stirring ballad, and we feel that it gives but a faint and  discordant echo of the music welling in Toru's brain. For it must  frankly be confessed that in the brief May-day of her existence she had  not time to master our language as Blanco White did, or as Chamisso  mastered German. To the end of her days, fluent and graceful as she was,  she was not entirely conversant with English, especially with the  colloquial turns of modern speech. Often a very fine thought is spoiled  for hypercritical ears by the queer turn of"]]]
