The Origin, Prevalence, and Variety of Superstition--The       Belief in Witchcraft the most horrid Form of       Superstition--Most flourishing in the Sixteenth and       Seventeenth Centuries--The Sentiments of Addison,       Blackstone, and the Lawyers of the Eighteenth Century upon       the Subject--Chaldean and Persian Magic--Jewish       Witchcraft--Its important Influence on Christian and Modern       Belief--Greek Pharmacy and Sorcery--Early Roman Laws against       Conjuration and Magic Charms--Crimes perpetrated, under the       Empire, in connection with Sorceric Practices--The general       Persecution for Magic under Valentinian and Valens--German       and Scandinavian Sagae--The probable Origin of the general       Belief in an Evil Principle.      Superstition, the product of ignorance of causes, of the  proneness to seek the solution of phenomena out of and beyond  nature, and of the consequent natural but unreasoning dread of  the Unknown and Invisible (ignorantly termed the supernatural),  is at once universal in the extent, and various in the kinds,  of its despotism. Experience and reason seem to prove that,  inherent to and apparently coexistent with the human mind, it  naturally originates in the constitution of humanity: in ignorance  and uncertainty, in an instinctive doubt and fear of the  _Unknown_. Accident may moderate its power among particular peoples  and persons; and there are always exceptional minds whose  natural temper and exercise of reason are able to free them from  the servitude of a delusive imagination. For the mass of mankind,  the germ of superstition, prepared to assume always a new shape  and sometimes fresh vigour, is indestructible. The severest  assaults are ineffectual to eradicate it: hydra-like, far from  being destroyed by a seeming mortal stroke, it often raises its  many-headed form with redoubled force.    It will appear more philosophic to deplore the imperfection, than  to deride the folly of human nature, when the fact that the  superstitious sentiment is not only a result of mere barbarism or  vulgar ignorance, to be expelled of course by civilisation and  knowledge, but is indigenous in the life of every man, barbarous  or civilised, pagan or Christian, is fully recognised. The  enlightening influence of science, as far as it extends, is  irresistible; and its progress within certain limits seems sure  and almost omnipotent. But it is unfortunately limited in the  extent of its influence, as well as uncertain in duration; while  reason enjoys a feeble reign compared with ignorance and  imagination.[1] If it is the great office of history to teach by  experience, it is never useless to examine the causes and the  facts of a mischievous creed that has its roots deep in the  ignorant fears of mankind; but against the recurrence of the  fatal effects of fanaticism apparent in the earliest and latest  records of the world, there can be no sufficient security.      [1] That 'speculation has on every subject of human enquiry    three successive stages; in the first of which it tends to    explain the phenomena by supernatural agencies, in the    second by metaphysical abstractions, and in the third or    final state, confines itself to ascertaining their laws of    succession and similitude' (_System of Logic_, by J. S.    Mill), is a generalisation of Positive Philosophy, and a    theory of the Science of History, consistent probably with    the progress of knowledge among philosophers, but is    scarcely applicable to the mass of mankind.    Dreams, magic terrors, miracles, witches, ghosts, portents, are  some of the various forms superstition has invented and magnified  to disturb the peace of society as well as of individuals. The  most extravagant of these need not be sought in the remoter ages  of the human race, or even in the 'dark ages' of European  history: they are sufficiently evident in the legislation and  theology, as well as in the popular prejudices of the seventeenth  century.    The belief in the _infernal_ art of witchcraft is perhaps the  most horrid, as it certainly is the most absurd, phenomenon in  the religious history of the world. Of the millions of victims  sacrificed on the altars of religion this particular delusion can  claim a considerable proportion. By a moderate computation, nine  millions have been burned or hanged since the establishment of  Christianity.[2] Prechristian antiquity experienced its  tremendous power, and the primitive faith of Christianity easily  accepted and soon developed it. It was reserved, however, for the  triumphant Church to display it in its greatest horrors: and if  we deplore the too credulous or accommodative faith of the early  militant Church or the unilluminated ignorance of paganism, we  may still more indignantly denounce the cruel policy of  Catholicism and the barbarous folly of Protestant theology which  could deliberately punish an impossible crime. It is the reproach  of Protestantism that this persecution was most furiously raging  in the age that produced Newton and Locke. Compared with its  atrocities even the Marian burnings appear as nothing: and it may  well be doubted whether the fanatic zeal of the 'bloody Queen,'  is no less contemptible than the credulous barbarity of the  judges of the seventeenth century. The period 1484 (the year in  which Innocent VIII. published his famous 'Witch Hammer' signally  ratified 120 years later by the Act of Parliament of James I. of  England) to 1680 might be characterised not improperly as the era  of devil-worship; and we are tempted almost to embrace the theory  of Zerdusht and the Magi and conceive that Ahriman was then  superior in the eternal strife; to imagine the _Evil One_, as in  the days of the Man of Uz, 'going to and fro in the earth, and  walking up and down in it.' It is come to that at the present  day, according to a more rational observer of the seventeenth  century, that it is regarded as a part of religion to ascribe  great wonders to the devil; and those are taxed with infidelity  and perverseness who hesitate to believe what thousands relate  concerning his power. Whoever does not do so is accounted an  atheist because he cannot persuade himself that there are two  Gods, the one good and the other evil[3]--an assertion which is  no mere hyperbole or exaggeration of a truth: there is the  certain evidence of facts as well as the concurrent testimony of  various writers.      [2] According to Dr. Sprenger (_Life of Mohammed_). Cicero's    observation that there was no people either so civilised or    learned, or so savage and barbarous, that had not a belief    that the future may be predicted by certain persons (De    Divinatione, i.), is justified by the faith of Christendom,    as well as by that of paganism; and is as true of witchcraft    as it is of prophecy or divination.      [3] Dr. Balthazar Becker, Amsterdam, 1691, quoted in    Mosheim's _Institutes of Ecclesiastical History_, ed. Reid.    Those (comparatively few) whose reason and humanity alike  revolted from a horrible dogma, loudly proclaim the prevailing  prejudice. Such protests, however, were, for a long time at  least, feeble and useless--helplessly overwhelmed by the  irresistible torrent of public opinion. All classes of society  were almost equally infected by a plague-spot that knew no  distinction of class or rank. If theologians (like Bishop Jewell,  one of the most esteemed divines in the Anglican Church,  publicly asserting on a well known occasion at once his faith and  his fears) or lawyers (like Sir Edward Coke and Judge Hale) are  found unmistakably recording their undoubting conviction, they  were bound, it is plain, the one class by theology, the other by  legislation. Credulity of so extraordinary a kind is sufficiently  surprising even in theologians; but what is to be thought of the  deliberate opinion of unbiassed writers of a recent age  maintaining the possibility, if not the actual occurrence, of the  facts of the belief?    The deliberate judgment of Addison, whose wit and preeminent  graces of style were especially devoted to the extirpation of  almost every sort of popular folly of the day, could declare:  'When I hear the relations that are made from all parts of the  world, not only from Norway and Lapland, from the East and West  Indies, but from every particular nation in Europe, I cannot  forbear thinking that there is such an intercourse and commerce  with evil spirits as that which we express by the name of  witchcraft.... In short, when I consider the question whether  there are such persons in the world as those we call witches, my  mind is divided between two opposite opinions; or rather, to  speak my thoughts freely, I believe in general that there is and  has been such a thing as witchcraft, but at the same time can  give no credit to any particular modern instance of it.'[4]  Evidence, if additional were wanted, how deference to authority  and universal custom may subdue the reason and understanding. The  language and decision of Addison are adopted by Sir W. Blackstone  in 'Commentaries on the Laws of England,' who shelters himself  behind that celebrated author's sentiment; and Gibbon informs us  that 'French and English lawyers of the present age [the latter  half of the last century] allow the _theory_ but deny the  _practice_ of witchcraft'--influenced doubtless by the spirit of  the past legislation of their respective countries. In England  the famous enactment of the subservient parliament of James I.  against the crimes of sorcery, &c., was repealed in the middle of  the reign of George II., our laws sanctioning not 130 years since  the popular persecution, if not the legal punishment.      [4] _Spectator_, No. 117. The sentiments of Addison on a    kindred subject are very similar. Writing about the vulgar    ghost creed, he adds these remarkable words: 'At the same    time I think a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22829"],[0,"No Animal Food; and Nutrition and Diet; with Vegetable Recipes (#2)"],[1," know about  nutrition, or about obedience to an unperverted appetite? The doctors  seem to know little about health; they are not asked to keep us healthy,  but only to cure us of disease, and so their studies relate to disease,  not health; and dietetics, a science dealing with the very first  principles of health, is an optional course in the curriculum of the  medical student.    Food is the first necessary of life, and the right kind of food, eaten  in the right manner, is necessary to a right, that is, healthy life. No  doubt, pathological conditions are sometimes due to causes other than  wrong feeding, but in a very large percentage of cases there is little  doubt that errors in diet have been the cause of the trouble, either  directly, or indirectly by rendering the system susceptible to  pernicious influences.[1] A knowledge of what is the right food to eat,  and of the right way to eat it, does not, under existing conditions of  life, come instinctively. Under other conditions it might do so, but  under those in which we live, it certainly does not; and this is owing  to the fact that for many hundred generations back there has been a  pandering to sense, and a quelling and consequent atrophy of the  discriminating animal instinct. As our intelligence has developed we  have applied it to the service of the senses and at the expense of our  primitive intuition of right and wrong that guided us in the selection  of that which was suitable to our preservation and health. We excel the  animals in the possession of reason, but the animals excel us in the  exercise of instinct.    It has been said that animals do not study dietetics and yet live  healthily enough. This is true, but it is true only as far as concerns  those animals which live _in their natural surroundings and under  natural conditions_. Man would not need to study diet were he so  situated, but he is not. The wild animal of the woods is far removed  from the civilized human being. The animal's instinct guides him aright,  but man has lost his primitive instinct, and to trust to his  inclinations may result in disaster.    The first question about vegetarianism, then, is this:--Is it the best  diet from the hygienic point of view? Of course it will be granted that  diseased food, food containing pernicious germs or poisons, whether  animal or vegetable, is unfit to be eaten. It is not to be supposed that  anyone will defend the eating of such food, so that we are justified in  assuming that those who defend flesh-eating believe flesh to be free  from such germs and poisons; therefore let the following be noted. It is  affirmed that 50 per cent. of the bovine and other animals that are  slaughtered for human food are affected with Tuberculosis, or some of  the following diseases: Cancer, Anthrax, Pleuro-Pneumonia, Swine-Fever,  Sheep Scab, Foot and Mouth Disease, etc., etc., and that to exclude all  suspected or actually diseased carcasses would be practically to leave  the market without a supply. One has only to read the literature dealing  with this subject to be convinced that the meat-eating public must  consume a large amount of highly poisonous substances. That these  poisons may communicate disease to the person eating them has been  amply proved. Cooking does _not_ necessarily destroy all germs, for the  temperature at the interior of a large joint is below that necessary to  destroy the bacilli there present.    Although the remark is irrelevant to the subject in hand, one is tempted  to point out that, quite apart from the question of hygiene, the idea of  eating flesh containing sores and wounds, bruises and pus-polluted  tissues, is altogether repulsive to the imagination.    Let it be supposed, however, that meat can be, and from the meat-eater's  point of view, should be and will be under proper conditions,  uncontaminated, there yet remains the question whether such food is  physiologically necessary to man. Let us first consider what kind of  food is best suited to man's natural constitution.    FOOTNOTES:    [Footnote 1: It seems reasonable to suppose that granting the organism  has such natural needs satisfied as sleep, warmth, pure air, sunshine,  and so forth, fundamentally all susceptibility to disease is due to  wrong feeding and mal-nutrition, either of the individual organism or of  its progenitors. The rationale of nutrition is a far more complicated  matter than medical science appears to realise, and until the intimate  relationship existing between nutrition and pathology has been  investigated, we shall not see much progress towards the extermination  of disease. Medical science by its curative methods is simply pruning  the evil, which, meanwhile, is sending its roots deeper into the  unstable organisms in which it grows.]          II    PHYSICAL CONSIDERATIONS      There are many eminent scientists who have given it as their opinion  that anatomically and physiologically man is to be classed as a  frugivorous animal. There are lacking in man all the characteristics  that distinguish the prominent organs of the carnivora, while he  possesses a most striking resemblance to the fruit-eating apes. Dr.  Kingsford writes: 'M. Pouchet observes that all the details of the  digestive apparatus in man, as well as his dentition, constitute \"so  many proofs of his frugivorous origin\"--an opinion shared by Professor  Owen, who remarks that the anthropoids and all the quadrumana derive  their alimentation from fruits, grains, and other succulent and  nutritive vegetable substances, and that the strict analogy which exists  between the structure of these animals and that of man clearly  demonstrates his frugivorous nature. This view is also taken by Cuvier,  Linnaeus, Professor Lawrence, Charles Bell, Gassendi, Flourens, and a  great number of other eminent writers.' (see _The Perfect Way in Diet_.)    Linnaeus is quoted by John Smith in _Fruits and Farinacea_ as speaking  of fruit as follows: 'This species of food is that which is most  suitable to man: which is evidenced by the series of quadrupeds,  analogy, wild men, apes, the structure of the mouth, of the stomach, and  the hands.'    Sir Ray Lancaster, K.C.B., F.R.S., in an article in _The Daily  Telegraph_, December, 1909, wrote: 'It is very generally asserted by  those who advocate a purely vegetable diet that man's teeth are of the  shape and pattern which we find in the fruit-eating, or in the  root-eating, animals allied to him. This is true.... It is quite clear  that man's cheek teeth do not enable him to cut lumps of meat and bone  from raw carcasses and swallow them whole. They are broad,  square-surfaced teeth with four or fewer low rounded tubercles to crush  soft food, as are those of monkeys. And there can be no doubt that man  fed originally like monkeys, on easily crushed fruits, nuts, and roots.'    With regard to man's original non-carnivorous nature and omnivorism, it  is sometimes said that though man's system may not thrive on a raw flesh  diet, yet he can assimilate cooked flesh and his system is well adapted  to digest it. The answer to this is that were it demonstrable, and it is  _not_, that cooked flesh is as easily digested and contains as much  nutriment as grains and nuts, this does not prove it to be suitable for  human food; for man (leaving out of consideration the fact that the  eating of diseased animal flesh can communicate disease), since he was  originally formed by Nature to subsist exclusively on the products of  the vegetable kingdom, cannot depart from Nature's plan without  incurring penalty of some sort--unless, indeed, his natural original  constitution has changed; but _it has not changed_. The most learned and  world-renowned scientists affirm man's present anatomical and  physiological structure to be that of a frugivore. Disguising an  unnatural food by cooking it may make that food more assimilable, but it  by no means follows that such a food is suitable, let alone harmless, as  human food. That it is harmful, not only to man's physical health, but  to his mental and moral health, this book endeavours to demonstrate.    With regard to the fact that man has not changed constitutionally from  his original frugivorous nature Dr. Haig writes as follows: 'If man  imagines that a few centuries, or even a few hundred centuries, of  meat-eating in defiance of Nature have endowed him with any new powers,  except perhaps, that of bearing the resulting disease and degradation  with an ignorance and apathy which are appalling, he deceives himself;  for the record of the teeth shows that human structure has remained  unaltered over vast periods of time.'    According to Dr. Haig, human metabolism (the process by which food is  converted into living tissue) differs widely from that of the  carnivora. The carnivore is provided with the means to dispose of such  poisonous salts as are contained in and are produced by the ingestion of  animal flesh, while the human system is not so provided. In the human  body these poisons are not held in solution, but tend to form deposits  and consequently are the cause of diseases of the arthritic group,  conspicuously rheumatism.    There is sometimes some misconception as regards the distinction between  a frugivorous and herbivorous diet. The natural diet of man consists of  fruits, farinacea, perhaps certain roots, and the more esculent  vegetables, and is commonly known as vegetarian, or fruitarian  (frugivorous), but man's digestive organs by no means allow him to eat  grass as the herbivora--the horse, ox, sheep, etc.--although he is much  more nearly allied to these animals than to the carnivora.    We are forced to conclude, in the face of all the available evidence,  that the natural constitution of man closely resembles that of  fruit-eating animals, and widely differs from that of flesh-eating  animals, and that from analogy it is only reasonable to suppose that the  fruitarian, or"]]]
