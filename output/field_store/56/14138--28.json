To insure a due observance of the laws of numismatics, and  that they might bear comparison with the best specimens of modern  times, Colonel Humphreys asked the aid of the French Academy of  Inscriptions and Belles-Lettres in the composition of the designs. (p. xii)  He explained his action in this respect to the President of Congress  in the following letter:         To His Excellency                       Paris, March 18, 1785.          THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.         Sir: Before I left America, I made application to the       Superintendent of Finances for the sword which Congress had been       pleased to order, by their resolution of the 17th of November,       1781, to be presented to me, in consequence of which Mr. Morris       informed me verbally that he would take the necessary       arrangements for procuring all the honourary presents which had       been directed to be given to different officers during the late       war, and requested that I would undertake to have them executed       in Europe. Some time after my arrival here, I received the       inclosed letter[1] from him, accompanied with a list of medals,       etc., and a description of those intended for General Morgan and       Colonels Washington and Howard.         Upon the receipt of these documents I did not delay to make the       proper inquiries from the characters who were the best skilled in       subjects of this nature, and after having spoken to some of the       first artists, I was advised to apply to the Abbe Barthelemy,       member of the academies of London, Madrid, Cortona, and       Hesse-Cassel, and actual keeper of the King's Cabinet of Medals       and Antiquities, at whose instance I wrote a letter to the Royal       Academy of Inscriptions and Belles-Lettres, of which a copy is       inclosed. Being informed at the same time that the description of       medals for General Morgan, etc., was not in the style and manner       such medals were usually executed, I took the liberty of       suspending the execution of them, until I could learn whether it       is the pleasure of Congress to have them performed _exactly_ in       the manner prescribed--which shall be done accordingly, in case I       should not be honoured with further instructions on the subject       before their approaching recess.         The medals voted for the capture of Stony Point have been, or I       believe may be, all struck from the die originally engraved to       furnish one of them for Colonel de Fleury.         As to the swords in question, it is proposed to have them all       constructed in precisely the same fashion, the hilt to be of       silver, round which a foliage of laurel to be enameled in    (p. xiii)       gold in such a manner as to leave a medallion in the centre       sufficient to receive the arms of the United States on one side,       and on the reverse an inscription in English, \"The United States       to Colonel Meigs, July 25, 1777,\" and the same for the others.       The whole ten, executed in this manner, may probably cost about       three hundred louis d'or, which is (as I have been informed) but       little more than was paid for the sword which some time since was       presented on the part of the United States to the Marquis de la       Fayette.         I have the honour to be, with the most perfect respect,                                               D. HUMPHREYS.         P.S. I forgot to mention that, in order to have the medals for       General Morgan, etc., executed in the manner originally proposed,       it will be necessary for me to have more particular information       of the numbers on both sides, of the killed, wounded, prisoners,       trophies, etc., which the enemy lost in the action of the       Cowpens.                       [Footnote 1: I have not been able to find this                     letter.]    The following is the letter to the Royal Academy of Inscriptions and  Belles-Lettres, referred to by Colonel Humphreys in the above:                                                 Paris, March 14, 1785.       Mr. DACIER,           Perpetual Secretary of the Academy of Inscriptions                 and Belles-Lettres, Rue Chabanais, Paris.         Sir: Having it in charge to procure the honourary presents which       (during the late war) have been voted by Congress to several       meritorious officers in their service, particularly three medals       in gold, one for General Washington, another for General Gates,       and a third for General Greene; and, being extremely desirous       that these medals should be executed in a manner grateful to the       illustrious personages for whom they are designed, worthy the       dignity of the sovereign power by whom they are presented, and       calculated to perpetuate the remembrance of those great events       which they are intended to consecrate to immortality, I therefore       take the liberty to address, through you, Sir, the Academy of       Inscriptions and Belles-Lettres, on the subject, and entreat that       this learned body will be pleased to honour me, as soon as    (p. xiv)       may be convenient, with their advice and sentiments respecting       the devices and inscriptions proper for the before mentioned       medals. A memoir,[2] which has been left in the hands of M.       Barthelemy, one of their members, will give the necessary       information.         In addressing so respectable an assembly of _literati_ I do not       think myself permitted to enlarge on the importance of this       subject, because they must know, much better than I can inform       them, in how great a degree such monuments of public gratitude       are calculated to produce a laudable emulation, a genuine love of       liberty, and all the virtues of real patriotism, not only among       the innumerable generations who are yet to people the wastes of       America, but on the human character in general. Nor do I make       those apologies for the trouble I am now giving, which would be       requisite, did I not feel a conviction that whatever is       interesting to the national glory of America, to the good of       posterity, or to the happiness of the human race, cannot be       indifferent to a society composed of the most enlightened and       liberal characters in Europe, fostered by the royal protection of       a monarch whose name will forever be as dear to the United States       as it will be glorious in the annals of mankind.         Being so unfortunate as not to be able to write myself in French,       my intimate friend and brave companion in arms, M. le marquis de       la Fayette, has had the goodness to make a translation of this       letter into that language, which I inclose herewith.         I have the honour to be, with the most perfect respect, Sir, your       most obedient and most humble servant,                                               D. HUMPHREYS.                       [Footnote 2: I have not been able to find any trace                     of this memoir in the archives of the French                     Academy.]    A letter written by Franklin, about the same time, to John Jay, then  Secretary for Foreign Affairs, is of much interest in this connection:         To the Honourable          John JAY,                            Passy, May 10, 1785.               Secretary for Foreign Affairs.           -       -       -       -       -         P.S. The striking of the medals being now in agitation here, I       send the inclosed for consideration.         _A thought concerning the Medals that are to be struck by      (p. xv)       order of Congress._         The forming of dies in steel to strike medals or money, is       generally with the intention of making a great number of the same       form.         The engraving those dies in steel is, from the hardness of the       substance, very difficult and expensive, but, once engraved, the       great number to be easily produced afterward by stamping       justifies the expense, it being but small when divided among a       number.         Where only one medal of a kind is wanted, it seems an unthrifty       way to form dies for it in steel to strike the two sides of it,       the whole expense of the dies resting on that medal.         It was by this means that the medal voted by Congress for M. de       Fleury cost one hundred guineas, when an engraving of the same       figures and inscriptions might have been beautifully done on a       plate of silver of the same size for two guineas.         The ancients, when they ordained a medal to record the memory of       any laudable action, and do honour to the performer of that       action, struck a vast number and used them as money. By this       means the honour was extended through their own and neighbouring       nations, every man who received or paid a piece of such money was       reminded of the virtuous action, the person who performed it, and       the reward attending it, and the number gave such security to       this kind of monuments against perishing and being forgotten,       that some of each of them exist to this day, though more than two       thousand years old, and, being now copied in books by the arts of       engraving and painting, are not only exceedingly multiplied but       likely to remain some thousands of years longer.         The man who is honoured only by a single medal is obliged to show       it to enjoy the honour, which can be done only to a few and often       awkwardly. I therefore wish the medals of Congress were ordered       to be money, and so continued as to be convenient money, by being       in value aliquot parts of a dollar.         Copper coins are wanting in America for small change. We have       none but those of the King of England. After one silver or gold       medal is struck from the dies, for"]]]
