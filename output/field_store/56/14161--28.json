He's an awfully modest fellow, and he went over to London with Hall, who  swears by him; says he believes he put a new heart in him, and all that  sort of thing. There comes the boat now. Better have your photographers  ready, for all you'll get will be a picture of him keeping his mouth  shut.\"    As the big English boat swung slowly into its dock, with the help of  half a dozen tugs that puffed and pounded at its side, the newspaper men  and Dr. Earl's family caught sight of him simultaneously, as he waved  his hand and called across the intervening space with all the abandon  of a returning traveler.    He could make them hear now. \"Leonora, dear, how are you!\" as a  remarkably sweet-faced girl threw a shower of kisses in his direction,  which passed on their way an equal number of his own. \"And Hilda! And  for the life of me, there's Frank! Love to all of you!\" A few minutes  more and he was with them. He caught the girl in his arms and gave her a  long and tender embrace. Then he turned to the others and greeted them  with all the fraternal warmth natural after eighteen months' separation.    \"How splendid it is to see you all again! What brought you to New York,  Frank?\"    \"Oh, just to see if I could cross Broadway without being bumped into by  a trolley car or a taxi-cab or an airship. Incidentally, to keep you  from losing your breath and hearing in the new tunnels through which you  will be shot under these New York rivers.\"    \"Tubes, you mean, brother dear, tubes. I've been doing nothing else but  shoot the London tubes for the last fortnight.\"    \"Where I live, in the wild and woolly Rockies, we call them tunnels,\"  answered his brother. \"Wouldn't the railroad builder howl at the idea  of 'tubing the mountains,' and the miner would have a war-dance of  delight at the suggestion that he must 'tube his claim.' These English  airs are all right, Dr. John Earl, but you may as well learn to talk  real American if you expect to chop bones and exploit microbes in this  country,\" and the young man glowed his admiration while plying him with  badinage.    The first greetings were scarcely over when the newspaper men made known  their mission, Tourney acting as spokesman for them all. Earl shook his  hand warmly.    \"I'm awfully glad to see you,\" he said, \"but you know I never give  interviews. I don't know how, to begin with, and I couldn't say anything  that would interest your readers. I have come back to practice my  profession in New York City; that is all I can tell you.\"    \"But that Paris case,\" pleaded Bedford. \"Do tell us about that.\"    \"Did you use the Hindoo method of respiration that the Swami  Bramachunenda gave an exposition of here two or three years ago?\" asked  another of the fraternity, and the others followed with different  interrogatives, but Earl laughed and waved them all away.    \"I don't know what the Swami did,\" he said, \"but if he is like some of  his brothers I'm ready to believe anything. All that I did, and a great  deal that I never thought of doing myself, or heard of anybody else  doing on this planet, was told in your papers at the time. Really, if I  had anything worth your while as a news story I would be glad to give it  to you--one of these days I may have, but you must excuse me now.\"    His manner was courteous but unmistakable, and turning away from them he  was soon absorbed in conversation with the pretty girl and his brother  and sister. He hardly took his eyes off the former as he recounted his  adventures abroad.    Three months previously he and Leonora Kimball had been betrothed in  Vienna, and it was agreed that they were to be married soon after his  arrival home. In a social way, the match met the approval of New York's  select set, for they belonged to equally wealthy and prominent families.  The Earls had come to New York from New England, two generations ago,  and the foundation of the family fortune had been laid in a small block  of New York, New Haven and Hartford stock, which had grown into a huge  block of both stocks and bonds from the various expansions of stock and  consolidations of property that had meanwhile taken place. The Kimballs  had come from the Pacific coast, where the same alchemist's result had  been wrought with a block of Southern Pacific Railway stock. The family  tree of the Earls had rooted itself into the subsoil of real culture,  while that of the Kimballs was mostly displayed above ground with only  here and there a stray fibre that had sunk to any depth.    Leonora Kimball, who at this time was slightly over twenty-three years  of age, possessed a most winning and gracious manner--a face that might  have served as a better model for a madonna than many of those  apparently used by the old masters; a lithe and graceful figure and an  abundance of vivacity when doing the things that pleased her. She had so  captivated John Earl from their first meeting that he had never tried  nor cared to analyze her. Indeed, had he so wished, he would have found  it a difficult undertaking, for he was too content with the pleasure he  felt in her presence to care to question it.    Dr. Earl had taken infinite pains to search the world for the sources of  disease and its prevention and cure. He had delved deeply into the  mysteries of mental and spiritual therapeutics, and had closely studied  the influences surrounding the origin of individual human beings. But  while he had harnessed many more or less occult forces into scientific  service in treating invalids, strangely enough, it never occurred to him  that similar elements might have an important mission in determining the  natural affinity of those attracted by the tenderest passion in the  world, and might do much, if properly regarded, to render stable that  one-time sacred bond of the sexes known as the marriage relation, which  at this time, everywhere, was resting upon such shifting quicksands of  mismating as to menace its existence.    \"Love is of man's life a thing apart,\" applied with full force to Dr.  Earl, and he accepted his relations with Leonora Kimball with the same  confidence and light heart that might characterize the least thoughtful  man on Manhattan Island. While he had traveled many thousands of miles  and burned many a midnight lamp to ascertain if improvement could not be  made in the prevailing orthodox method of treating disease, he blindly  accepted, as millions of strong men before him had done, the prevailing  orthodox method of selecting a wife.    In any event, after the brother and sister had been left at the Ramsey  mansion on upper Fifth Avenue, he and Leonora proceeded to spend the  time from eleven to three o'clock very much as other lovers similarly  situated would have consumed those four hours. They motored until one  o'clock, when they went to her house, not far from his sister's  residence, where he had luncheon with her and her widowed mother, and at  three o'clock he arrived at the Hotel Gotham, where he had engaged  apartments.    When he stepped into his new sitting-room a large photograph of Leonora  confronted him on the dressing-case, his valet being a man of rare sense  and tact.    As he looked into the counterfeit impression of the large blue eyes and  reflected back her smile he declared to himself for the twentieth time  that day that she was the most fascinating creature in the world.          CHAPTER II    A MYSTICAL PARADE      When Dr. Earl arrived at his hotel he noticed crowds of people gathering  on the sidewalk, and lining up along the curbstone further down the  avenue, evidently expecting a parade of some sort. He had dismissed the  matter from his mind and was startled about an hour later to hear the  tap of a drum on the street, then a martial air by a band, followed by  the clatter of horses' hoofs and the shouts of policemen clearing the  way. Throwing open a window, he witnessed a sight that dazed him for a  moment, and he wondered whether or not he really was in an American  city.    As if by magic, the street was now filled with women, arranging  themselves in marching order, with the shout of command ringing clear  upon the air, and down Fifth Avenue as far as he could see, other  columns of women were forming to the strains of military music and to  the stirring echoes of fife and drum.    He grabbed his hat and stick, and joined the throng that packed the  sidewalk. His six feet of height and his athletic training rendered him  good service in ascertaining where to go and making it possible to get  there. He hurried along several blocks until he reached what he thought  must be the leading column of the march. Then he elbowed his way to the  curbstone and took up a position to witness this, as yet, mysterious  demonstration.    The air was sharp for a day late in April, but the sky was clear and the  sun shed occasional rays of splendor over some of the lower buildings  upon the waiting multitude.    The crowd was remarkably quiet. There seemed to be a spell over the  whole performance that savored of some of the wonders he had so recently  witnessed in India. There was something electric in the air that brought  with it an echo from some distant past or a promise for the future which  he tried in vain to catch and recognize.    Finally the order, \"Forward, march!\" was given, and to the air of  \"Marching Through Georgia\" the first column swung down the Avenue with  easy grace and in perfect step.    Long before the first standard came near he knew it was a Woman  Suffrage parade, and before he could get a view of the women carrying  it, he read the inscription on the banner:        Forward out of Error,        Leave behind the night;      Forward through the darkness,        Forward into Light.    Then the standard bearers were opposite him. The one nearest to him was  an exceedingly pretty young woman, as was also the second one, but as  his eyes rested upon the one farthest away he gave a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22288"],[0,"Chinese Painters: A Critical Study (#2)"],[1,"inhaling the fragrance of a peony.

Varying phases are but accidents and underneath the divers wrappings  of historic periods or different civilizations, the heart as well as the  mind of man has been moved by the same desires.    Art possesses a unity like that of nature. It is profound and stirring,  precisely because it blends and perpetuates feeling and intelligence by  means of outward expressions. Of all human achievements art is the most  vital, the one that is dowered with eternal youth, for it awakens in the  soul emotions which neither time nor civilization has ever radically  altered. Therefore, in commencing the study of an art of strange  appearance, what we must seek primarily is the exact nature of the  complexity of ideas and feelings upon which it is based. Such is the  task presented to us, and since the problem which we here approach is  the general study of Chinese painting, we must prepare ourselves first  to master the peculiarities of its appearance and technique, in order  to understand later on the motives which inspired it.    While the first part of this study will carry us far from our habitual  modes of thought, the second part will bring us back into a domain which  our own philosophies, sciences and arts have already made familiar.  Admittedly, Chinese painting is governed by distinctive ideas. Born of a  civilization vastly different from our own, it may at times appear in a  guise that seems incomprehensible. It would be astonishing, however, if  Western intelligence were unable to grasp an aesthetic code of a magnitude  which is too great to be ignored.    The progress of history and of criticism has given us the opportunity to  reach a comprehension of the most peculiar formulas. Our culture is  sufficiently broad to allow us to perceive the beauty of an Egyptian  fresco or an Assyrian bas-relief as well as of a Byzantine mosaic or a  painting of the Renaissance. We have therefore no excuse for remaining  inaccessible to the art of the Far East and we have surely all the mental  vigor that is requisite in order to accustom ourselves to the foreign  nature of its presentation. It is in the realm of painting that this  foreign element is most noticeable. This is due partly to a special  technique and partly to the nature of the doctrines which serve as its  inspiration.    It behooves us then to acquaint ourselves with these new aspects of the  human soul. That is the justification for this little book. It forms an  introduction in which gaps are shown without attempt at concealment and  is presented in all modesty.             *       *       *       *       *      PART ONE  TECHNIQUE    I. EQUIPMENT OF THE PAINTER      Where our painters have chosen wood or canvas as a ground, the Chinese  have employed silk or paper. While our art recognizes that drawing itself,  quite apart from painting, is a sufficient objective, drawing and painting  have always been closely intermingled in the Far East. While the mediums  used in Europe for painting in color, distemper, tempera and oil, led to  an exact study of form, the colors employed by the Orientals--at times  brilliant, at times subdued with an almost studied restraint--preserved a  singular fluidity and lent themselves to undefined evanescences which gave  them a surprising charm.    The early paintings were generally done on cotton, coarse silk or paper.  In the eighth century, under the T'ang dynasty, the use of finer silk  began. The dressing was removed with boiling water, the silk was then  sized and smoothed with a paddle. The use of silken fabric of the finest  weave, prepared with a thick sizing, became general during the Sung  dynasty. Papers were made of vegetable fibres, principally of bamboo.  Being prepared, as was the silk, with a sizing of alum, they became  practically indestructible. Upon these silks and papers the painter  worked with brush and Chinese ink,[1] color being introduced with more  or less freedom or restraint.    The brushes are of different types. Each position of the brush conforms  to a specific quality of the line, either sharp and precise or broad and  quivering, the ink spreading in strong touches or thinning to delicate  shades.    The colors are simple, of mineral or vegetable origin. Chinese painters  have always avoided mixing colors so far as possible. From malachite they  obtained several shades of green, from cinnabar or sulphide of mercury, a  number of reds. They knew also how to combine mercury, sulphur and potash  to produce vermilion. From peroxide of mercury they drew coloring powders  which furnished shades ranging from brick red to orange yellow. During the  T'ang dynasty coral was ground to secure a special red, while white was  extracted from burnt oyster shells. White lead was later substituted for  this lime white. Carmine lake they obtained from madder, yellows from  the sap of the rattan, blues from indigo. To these must be added the  different shades of Chinese ink and lastly, gold in leaf and in powder.      [1] Chinese ink is a very different composition from the ink of    Western countries. It is a solid made of soot obtained by burning    certain plants, which is then combined with glue or oil and moulded    into a cake and dried. Other ingredients may be added to produce sheen    or a dead finish. It improves with age if properly kept. The cake is    moistened and rubbed on a slab, and the ink thus obtained must be used    in a special way and with special care to produce the full    effect.--TRANSLATOR.      [Illustration: PLATE I. SCULPTURED STONES OF THE HAN DYNASTY    Second to Third Centuries. Rubbings taken by the Chavannes Expedition.]    The brush-stroke in the painting of the Far East is of supreme importance.  We know that this could not be otherwise if we recall that the characters  in Chinese writing are ideographs, not actually _written_, but rather  _drawn_. The stroke is not a mere formal, lifeless sign. It is an  expression in which is reflected the beauty of the thought that inspired  it as well as the quality of the soul of him who gives it form. In  writing, as in painting, it reveals to us the character and the conception  of its author. Placed at the service of certain philosophical ideas, which  will be set forth later on, this technique was bound to lead to a special  code of Aesthetics. The painter seeks to suggest with an unbroken line the  fundamental character of a form. His endeavor, in this respect, is to  simplify the objective images of the world to the extreme, replacing them  with ideal images, which prolonged meditation shall have freed from every  non-essential. It may therefore be readily understood how the brush-stroke  becomes so personal a thing, that in itself it serves to reveal the hand  of the master. There is no Chinese book treating of painting which does  not discuss and lay stress upon the value of its aesthetic code.          II. REPRESENTATION OF FORMS      It has often been said that in Chinese painting, as in Japanese painting,  perspective is ignored. Nothing is further from the truth. This error  arises from the fact that we have confused one system of perspective with  perspective as a whole. There are as many systems of perspective as there  are conventional laws for the representation of space.    The practice of drawing and painting offers the student the following  problem in descriptive geometry: _to represent the three dimensions of  space by means of a plane surface of two dimensions_. The Egyptians and  Assyrians solved this problem by throwing down vertical objects upon one  plane, which demands a great effort of abstraction on the part of the  observer. European perspective, built up in the fifteenth century upon  the remains of the geometric knowledge of the Greeks, is based on the  monocular theory used by the latter. In this system, it is assumed that  the picture is viewed with the eye fixed on a single point. Therefore  the conditions of foreshortening--or distorting the actual dimensions  according to the angle from which they are seen--are governed by placing  in harmony the distance of the eye from the scheme of the picture, the  height of the eye in relation to the objects to be depicted, and the  relative position of these objects with reference to the surface employed.      [Illustration: PLATE II. PORTION OF A SCROLL BY KU K'AI-CHIH    British Museum, London.]    But, in assuming that the picture is viewed with the eye fixed on a single  point, we put ourselves in conditions which are not those of nature. The  European painter must therefore compromise with the exigencies of  binocular vision, modify the too abrupt fading of forms and, in fine,  evade over-exact principles. Thus he arrives at a _perspective de  sentiment_, which is the one used by our masters.    Chinese perspective was formulated long before that of the Europeans and  its origins are therefore different. It was evolved in an age when the  method of superimposing different registers to indicate different planes  was still being practiced in bas-reliefs. The succession of planes, one  above the other, when codified, led to a system that was totally different  from our monocular perspective. It resulted in a"]]]
