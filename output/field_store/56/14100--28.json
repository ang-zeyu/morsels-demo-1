They landed in the north, and, having gained  some advantages, proceeded southward to the fen country, which they  plundered and laid waste with fire and sword. Heavy fines were extorted  from the rich abbeys; that on Crowland amounting to L64,000 of the  present value of money. Elsinus died in 1055.    Arwinus was then elected abbot, but he resigned in 1067 to Leofric. He  was nephew to Earl Leofric, of Mercia, whose Countess, according to the  chroniclers, redeemed Coventry from toll by riding naked through the  streets of that town.    During the third year of this abbot, William the Conqueror invaded  England, and we are told that Leofric fought for some time in the  English army, but in consequence of ill health, was obliged \"to return  to his monastery, where he died on the third of the kalends of  November, A.D. 1066.\" Braddo (or Brand) was the next successive abbot,  but died after a rule of three years.    Thorold of Fescamp, who for some service rendered to the conqueror, had  been appointed to an abbacy near Salisbury, was considered by William,  on account of his soldier-like qualities, to be a fit person to  transfer to the rebellious and disorderly neighbourhood of the Camp of  Refuge, and he was accordingly appointed Abbot of Peterborough, in  1069.    Between the death of Braddo and the arrival of his successor, the  second destruction of the monastery took place. A band of Danish  soldiers, headed by Hereward de Wake, nephew of Braddo, attacked the  monastery, and all the valuable treasures which it possessed were  either taken away or destroyed. They then set fire to the building. The  following is Gunton's account of the treasures which they captured;  and, as it puts us in possession of much curious information concerning  those times, we will give the extract entire:--\"They took the golden  crown from the head of the crucifix, the cross with the precious  stones, and the footstool under; _duo aurea feretra_ (two golden or  gilded biers whereon they carried the saints' reliques, and other such  like things, in procession), and nine silver ones; and twelve crosses,  some of gold and some of silver. And, besides all this, they went up to  the tower and took away the great table which the monks had hidden  there, which was all of gold, and silver, and precious stones, and wont  to be before the altar, with abundance of books, and other precious  things, which were valuable, there being not the like in all England.\"    The monks were disconsolate at the loss of these valuable treasures,  and the abbot solicited William the King to interfere for them, in  order that they might be returned. It appears, however, that the  conqueror did not pay much attention to their request; and it is  probable that, as he had just after this depredation concluded a treaty  of peace with the Danish sovereign, he was unwilling to do anything  that should cause a breach of peace between them, especially as they  were such troublesome and dangerous enemies. The greater part of the  treasure was by some means once more restored to the monks,[5] and,  according to the Saxon chronicler, they commenced from this time to  build ramparts for their own protection, and for the security of the  monastery. Tout Hill[6] in the vineyard field was raised at this time,  and there is said to have been a subterraneous passage which ran thence  to Croyland and Thorney. This hill was originally called Mount Thorold.    After the arrival of Thorold at Peterborough, being accompanied by 160  well-armed Frenchmen, he proceeded to turn his attention to the Camp of  Refuge, situated near Ely; and, joining Ives of Taillebois in an  assault upon it, was repulsed by Hereward de Wake, and taken prisoner,  with many of the monks; nor was he liberated, according to Dean  Patrick, until he had paid three thousand marks. After his liberation,  he returned to the monastery, and made himself more odious to the monks  than before. He was depraved and dissolute, and, to satisfy his  licentious desires, he is said to have made free with the treasury. He  introduced two monks likewise into the monastery, who were foreigners,  and quite as unscrupulous as himself, in purloining the wealth of the  abbey. He was afterwards made a bishop in France, but owing to his  utter recklessness of conduct and morality, he was sent back to England  four days after: was again admitted abbot of the monastery of  _Peterburgh_, where he died in 1098, after an odious government of  twenty-eight years.    During the reign of Henry I., the son of the Conqueror, Ernulphus  became Abbot of _Peterburgh_. This event took place in the year 1107,  and he made several important improvements in the monastery; built a  new dormitory and refectory, and completed the chapter-house, which  had been left in an unfinished state for several years. He likewise  enriched the convent by making an arrangement with all who held in rent  the abbey lands to pay tithes to him, and, when they died, that they  should give the third part of their estates to be buried in the church.  Thus it was that the monastery continued to grow in wealth, and when  Ernulphus was made Bishop of Rochester, which happened in 1114, the  abbey was entitled to a tithe of 40,800 acres of land.    During the rule of his successor, John de Sais, the monastery was  burned down. The fire is said to have occurred accidentally, and such  was the violence of the flames, that they reached the village and  consumed most of the cottagers' houses. The additions which Ernulphus  had made to the abbey, however, are said to have escaped the general  ruin.            [1] The most probable etymology of this word is that which is        given by Britton in his History of Peterborough Cathedral,        viz.--\"_Mede_ or _Mead_, a meadow; _ham_, a sheltered habitation;        and _sted, stead_, or _stad_, a bank, station, or place of rest.\"          [2] In cleaning out the river, a little below the bridge, in        June, 1820, a dagger was found, which is supposed to have        belonged to these Danes. It is in the possession of the present        Bishop.          [3] At a meeting of the Archaeological Society at Peterborough, in        1861, Mr. Bloxam read a paper in which he denied the authenticity        of this monument, which had previously been regarded as one of        the oldest monumental stones extant. Mr. Bloxam regards it as a        Norman, and not a Saxon work, and some centuries later in date        than the massacre of the monks. He considers that the figures are        not martyred monks with their abbot, but Christ and his eleven        disciples. It has been further conjectured by Canon Westcott        that it is part of the shrine erected over the relics of St.        Kyneburgha, which were removed from Castor to Peterborough during        the Abbacy of Elsinus, A.D. 1005-1055. A fragment of sculpture in        the same style is built into the west wall of the South Transept.          [4] A Saxon King of Northumbria and the second Christian monarch        of that province. An interesting account of this prince, and of        the extraordinary miracles said to have been performed by his        remains after death, will be found in a larger edition of the        Guide to the Cathedral, by Thos. Craddock, Esq. Price 2.6 & 15.          [5] Britton says, on the authority of Gunton, that they sent the        secretary of the monastery over to Denmark, on purpose to obtain        it. It is, however, more probable that Hereward, knowing the        disposition of the Norman abbot would lead him to enrich himself        at the expense of the monastery, took this means of removing        temptation out of the way of Thorold, and subsequently restored        the treasure to the monastery, when there was no longer any        danger of its being appropriated by the abbot.          [6] Toot is an old Saxon word, signifying to stand out, or be        prominent.          CHAPTER II.    _From the Foundation of the New Church, in 1117, to its dissolution  as an Abbey by Henry the Eighth, in 1541;--embracing a period of 425  years._      In the first chapter of our history, we traced the rise and progress of  the monastery of _Peterburgh_ through a period of 462 years, at the  expiration of which time we saw it burned to the ground, with all the  treasures which it had accumulated. We have now to witness its  restoration, and to follow it until we come to the nineteenth century,  through all the ravages which it has survived.    At the time of the eventful destruction which we have mentioned [1116],  John de Sais was abbot of the monastery, and had regained for it  several of the lands which had been forfeited by his predecessors. He  was, according to Gunton, a very learned man, and possessed great  strength of mind and decision of character. He showed his energy by the  prompt measures which he took to rebuild the abbey after its  destruction, and to get all those lands, manors, and fees confirmed to  it which it had so long enjoyed, and which continued daily to increase.  It was a very long time, however, before the new monastery was built.  John de Sais superintended it during his abbacy, but he lived only nine  years after he had laid the foundation-stone (which ceremony he  performed in the month of March, 1117), and the building was not  completed at his death; nor did he succeed in securing to the monastery  all its former possessions, although he exerted himself very  assiduously to obtain them.    John de Sais was succeeded by Henri de Angeli, in 1128, of whom nothing  of moment is recorded. He was a man of no character, and tried to  injure the monastery in the estimation of the king, by speaking falsely  of the brotherhood. Some writers say that he was detected in his  villany by the king, who obliged him to "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2097"],[0,"The Sign of the Four (#2)"],[1,", did you deduce the telegram?\"    \"Why, of course I knew that you had not written a letter, since I sat  opposite to you all morning.  I see also in your open desk there that  you have a sheet of stamps and a thick bundle of post-cards.  What  could you go into the post-office for, then, but to send a wire?  Eliminate all other factors, and the one which remains must be the  truth.\"    \"In this case it certainly is so,\" I replied, after a little thought.  \"The thing, however, is, as you say, of the simplest. Would you think  me impertinent if I were to put your theories to a more severe test?\"    \"On the contrary,\" he answered, \"it would prevent me from taking a  second dose of cocaine.  I should be delighted to look into any problem  which you might submit to me.\"    \"I have heard you say that it is difficult for a man to have any object  in daily use without leaving the impress of his individuality upon it  in such a way that a trained observer might read it.  Now, I have here  a watch which has recently come into my possession.  Would you have the  kindness to let me have an opinion upon the character or habits of the  late owner?\"    I handed him over the watch with some slight feeling of amusement in my  heart, for the test was, as I thought, an impossible one, and I  intended it as a lesson against the somewhat dogmatic tone which he  occasionally assumed.  He balanced the watch in his hand, gazed hard at  the dial, opened the back, and examined the works, first with his naked  eyes and then with a powerful convex lens.  I could hardly keep from  smiling at his crestfallen face when he finally snapped the case to and  handed it back.    \"There are hardly any data,\" he remarked.  \"The watch has been recently  cleaned, which robs me of my most suggestive facts.\"    \"You are right,\" I answered.  \"It was cleaned before being sent to me.\"  In my heart I accused my companion of putting forward a most lame and  impotent excuse to cover his failure.  What data could he expect from  an uncleaned watch?    \"Though unsatisfactory, my research has not been entirely barren,\" he  observed, staring up at the ceiling with dreamy, lack-lustre eyes.  \"Subject to your correction, I should judge that the watch belonged to  your elder brother, who inherited it from your father.\"    \"That you gather, no doubt, from the H. W. upon the back?\"    \"Quite so.  The W. suggests your own name.  The date of the watch is  nearly fifty years back, and the initials are as old as the watch:  so  it was made for the last generation.  Jewelry usually descends to the  eldest son, and he is most likely to have the same name as the father.  Your father has, if I remember right, been dead many years.  It has,  therefore, been in the hands of your eldest brother.\"    \"Right, so far,\" said I.  \"Anything else?\"    \"He was a man of untidy habits,--very untidy and careless.  He was left  with good prospects, but he threw away his chances, lived for some time  in poverty with occasional short intervals of prosperity, and finally,  taking to drink, he died.  That is all I can gather.\"    I sprang from my chair and limped impatiently about the room with  considerable bitterness in my heart.    \"This is unworthy of you, Holmes,\" I said.  \"I could not have believed  that you would have descended to this.  You have made inquires into the  history of my unhappy brother, and you now pretend to deduce this  knowledge in some fanciful way.  You cannot expect me to believe that  you have read all this from his old watch!  It is unkind, and, to speak  plainly, has a touch of charlatanism in it.\"    \"My dear doctor,\" said he, kindly, \"pray accept my apologies. Viewing  the matter as an abstract problem, I had forgotten how personal and  painful a thing it might be to you.  I assure you, however, that I  never even knew that you had a brother until you handed me the watch.\"    \"Then how in the name of all that is wonderful did you get these facts?  They are absolutely correct in every particular.\"    \"Ah, that is good luck.  I could only say what was the balance of  probability.  I did not at all expect to be so accurate.\"    \"But it was not mere guess-work?\"    \"No, no:  I never guess.  It is a shocking habit,--destructive to the  logical faculty.  What seems strange to you is only so because you do  not follow my train of thought or observe the small facts upon which  large inferences may depend.  For example, I began by stating that your  brother was careless.  When you observe the lower part of that  watch-case you notice that it is not only dinted in two places, but it  is cut and marked all over from the habit of keeping other hard  objects, such as coins or keys, in the same pocket.  Surely it is no  great feat to assume that a man who treats a fifty-guinea watch so  cavalierly must be a careless man.  Neither is it a very far-fetched  inference that a man who inherits one article of such value is pretty  well provided for in other respects.\"    I nodded, to show that I followed his reasoning.    \"It is very customary for pawnbrokers in England, when they take a  watch, to scratch the number of the ticket with a pin-point upon the  inside of the case.  It is more handy than a label, as there is no risk  of the number being lost or transposed.  There are no less than four  such numbers visible to my lens on the inside of this case.  Inference,--that your brother was often at low water.  Secondary  inference,--that he had occasional bursts of prosperity, or he could  not have redeemed the pledge. Finally, I ask you to look at the inner  plate, which contains the key-hole.  Look at the thousands of scratches  all round the hole,--marks where the key has slipped.  What sober man's  key could have scored those grooves?  But you will never see a  drunkard's watch without them.  He winds it at night, and he leaves  these traces of his unsteady hand.  Where is the mystery in all this?\"    \"It is as clear as daylight,\" I answered.  \"I regret the injustice  which I did you.  I should have had more faith in your marvellous  faculty.  May I ask whether you have any professional inquiry on foot  at present?\"    \"None.  Hence the cocaine.  I cannot live without brain-work. What else  is there to live for?  Stand at the window here.  Was ever such a  dreary, dismal, unprofitable world?  See how the yellow fog swirls down  the street and drifts across the dun-colored houses.  What could be  more hopelessly prosaic and material?  What is the use of having  powers, doctor, when one has no field upon which to exert them?  Crime  is commonplace, existence is commonplace, and no qualities save those  which are commonplace have any function upon earth.\"    I had opened my mouth to reply to this tirade, when with a crisp knock  our landlady entered, bearing a card upon the brass salver.    \"A young lady for you, sir,\" she said, addressing my companion.    \"Miss Mary Morstan,\" he read.  \"Hum!  I have no recollection of the  name.  Ask the young lady to step up, Mrs. Hudson.  Don't go, doctor.  I should prefer that you remain.\"        Chapter II    The Statement of the Case    Miss Morstan entered the room with a firm step and an outward composure  of manner.  She was a blonde young lady, small, dainty, well gloved,  and dressed in the most perfect taste.  There was, however, a plainness  and simplicity about her costume which bore with it a suggestion of  limited means.  The dress was a sombre grayish beige, untrimmed and  unbraided, and she wore a small turban of the same dull hue, relieved  only by a suspicion of white feather in the side.  Her face had neither  regularity of feature nor beauty of complexion, but her expression was  sweet and amiable, and her large blue eyes were singularly spiritual  and sympathetic.  In an experience of women which extends over many  nations and three separate continents, I have never looked upon a face  which gave a clearer promise of a refined and sensitive nature. I could  not but observe that as she took the seat which Sherlock Holmes placed  for her, her lip trembled, her hand quivered, and she showed every sign  of intense inward agitation.    \"I have come to you, Mr. Holmes,\" she said, \"because you once enabled  my employer, Mrs. Cecil Forrester, to unravel a little domestic  complication.  She was much impressed by your kindness and skill.\"    \"Mrs. Cecil Forrester,\" he repeated thoughtfully.  \"I believe that I  was of some slight service to her.  The case, however, as I remember  it, was a very simple one.\"    \"She did not think so.  But at least you cannot say the same of mine.  I can hardly imagine anything more strange, more utterly inexplicable,  than the situation in which I find myself.\"    Holmes rubbed his hands, and his eyes glistened.  He leaned forward in  his chair with an expression of extraordinary concentration upon his  clear-cut, hawklike features.  \"State your case,\" said he, in brisk,  business tones.    I felt that my position was an embarrassing one.  \"You will, I am sure,  excuse me,\" I said, rising from my chair.    To my surprise, the young lady held up her gloved hand to detain me.  \"If your friend,\" she said, \"would be good enough to stop, he might be  of inestimable service to me.\"    I relapsed into my chair.    \"Briefly,\" she continued, \"the facts are these.  My father was an  officer in an Indian regiment who sent me home when I was quite a  child.  My mother was dead, and I had no relative in England.  I was  placed, however, in a comfortable boarding establishment at Edinburgh,  and there I remained until I was seventeen years of age.  In the year  1878 my father, who was senior captain of his regiment, obtained twelve  months' leave and came home.  He telegraphed to me from London that he  had arrived all safe, and directed me to come down at once, giving the  Langham Hotel as his address.  His message, as I remember, was full of  kindness and love.  On reaching London I drove to the Langham, and"]]]
