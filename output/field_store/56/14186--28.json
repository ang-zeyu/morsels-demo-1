It is probable that the magnificent enterprises of the Portuguese and  Spaniards, would, ere this, have colonised and converted to  Christianity, all the eligible spots of idolatrous Africa, if their  attention to this grand object had not been diverted by the discovery of  America, and their establishments in Brazil, Mexico, &c.    I was established upwards of sixteen years in West and South Barbary;  territories that maintain an uninterrupted intercourse with all those  countries that Major Houghton, Hornemann, Park, Rontgen, Burckhardt,  Ritchie, and others have attempted to explore. I was diplomatic agent to  several maritime nations of Europe, which familiarised me with all ranks  of society in those countries. I had a perfect knowledge of the  commercial and travelling language of Africa, (the Arabic.) I  corresponded _myself_ with the Emperors, Princes, and Bashaws in this  language; my commercial connections were _very_ extensive, amongst all  the most respectable merchants who traded with Timbuctoo and other  countries of Sudan. My residence at Agadeer, or Santa Cruz, in Suse,  afforded me eligible opportunities of procuring information respecting  the trade with Sudan, and the interior of Africa. A long residence in  the country, and extensive connections, enabled me to discriminate, and  to ascertain who were competent and who were not competent to give me  the information I required. I had opportunities at my leisure of  investigating the motives that any might have to deceive me; I had time  and leisure also to investigate their moral character, and to ascertain  the principles that regulated their respective conduct. Possessed of all  these sources of information, how could I fail of procuring correct and  authentic intelligence of the interior of Africa; yet my account of the  two Niles has been doubted by our fire-side critics, and the desultory  intelligence of other travellers, who certainly did not possess those  opportunities of procuring information that I did, has been substituted:  but, notwithstanding this unaccountable scepticism, my uncredited  account of the connection of the two Niles of Africa, continues daily to  receive additional confirmation from all the African travellers  themselves. And thus, TIME, (to use the words of a [j]learned and most  intelligent writer), \"which is more obscure in its course than the Nile,  and in its termination than the Niger,\" is disclosing all these things:  so that I now begin to think that the before-mentioned critics will not  be able much longer to maintain their theoretical hypothesis.[k]         [Footnote j: Vide the Rev. C. C. Colton's Lacon, sect. 587. p. 260,       261.]         [Footnote k: See various letters on Africa, in this work, p. 443.]    The talents, the extraordinary prudence and forbearance, the knowledge  of the Arabic language, and other essential qualifications in an African  traveller, which the ever-to-be-lamented Burckhardt so eminently  possessed, gave me the greatest hopes of his success in his arduous  enterprise, until I discovered, when reading his Travels, that he was  _poor and despised, though a Muselman_.    There is too much reason to apprehend that he was suspected, if not  discovered by the Muselmen, or he would not have been _secluded from  their meals_ and society: the Muselmen never (_sherik taam_) eat or  divide food with those they suspect of deception, nor do they ever  _refuse to partake of food with a Muselman_, unless they do suspect him  of treachery or deception; this principle prevails so universally among  them, that artful and designing people have practised as many deceptions  on the Bedouin under the cloak of hospitality, as are practised in  Christian countries under the cloak of religion! I cannot but suspect,  therefore, from the circumstance before recited, that the Muselmism of  Burckhardt was seriously suspected, and that his companions only waited  a convenient opportunity in the Sahara for executing their revenge on  him for the deception.    The very favourable reception that my account of Marocco met with from  the British public; the many things therein stated, which are daily  gaining confirmation, although they were doubted at the period of their  publication, have contributed in no small degree, to the production of  the following sheets, in which I can conscientiously declare, that truth  has been my guide; I have never sacrificed it to ambition, vanity,  avarice, or any other passion.    The learned, I am flattered to see, are now beginning to adopt my  orthography of African names; they have lately adopted _Timbuctoo_ for  the old and barbarous orthography of _Timbuctoo_; they have, however,  been upwards of ten years about it. In ten years more, I anticipate that  _Fez_ will be changed into _Fas_, and _Morocco_ into _Marocco_, for this  plain and uncontrovertible reason,--because they are so spelled in the  original language of the countries, of which they are the chief cities.  Since the publication of my account of Marocco, I have seen Arabic words  spelled various ways by the same author (I have committed the same error  myself); but in the following work I have adopted a plan to correct this  prevailing error in Oriental orthography, which, I think, ought to be  followed by every Oriental scholar, as the only correct way of  transcribing them in English; viz. by writing them exactly according to  the original Arabic orthography, substituting _gr_ (not _gh_, as  Richardson directs) for the Arabic guttural [Arabic] grain, and _kh_  for the guttural _k_ or [Arabic]--    _Note._ We should be careful not to copy the orthography of Oriental or  African names from the French, which has too often been done, although  their pronunciation of European letters is very dissimilar from our own.
