Inspiring as the spectacle was, however, it did not appreciably help  matters. On the contrary, it created so much friction among the people  that the conservative business men--resenting involuntary taxation,  yet wanting, if possible with honour, reconciliation and peace with  the mother country--organised, in May, 1774, a body of their own known  as the Committee of Fifty-one, which thought the time had come to  interrupt the assumed leadership of the Committee of Fifty. This  usurpation by one committee of powers that had been exercised by  another, caused the liveliest indignation.    The trouble between England and America had grown out of the need for  a continental revenue and the lack of a continental government with  taxing power--a weakness experienced throughout the Revolution and  under the Confederation. In the absence of such a government,  Parliament undertook to supply the place of such a power; but the  Americans blocked the way by an appeal to the principle that had been  asserted by Simon de Montford's Parliament in 1265 and admitted by  Edward I. in 1301--\"No taxation without representation.\" So the Stamp  Act of 1765 was repealed. The necessity for a continental revenue,  nevertheless, remained, and in the effort to adopt some expedient,  like the duty on tea, Crown and Colonies became involved in bitter  disputes. The idea of independence, however, had, in May, 1774,  scarcely entered the mind of the wildest New York radical. In their  instructions to delegates to the first Continental Congress, convened  in September, 1774, the Colonies made no mention of it. Even in May,  1775, the Sons of Liberty in Philadelphia cautioned John Adams not to  use the word, since \"it is as unpopular in all the Middle States as  the Stamp Act itself.\"[1] Washington wrote from the Congress that  independence was then not \"desired by any thinking man in America.\"[2]    [Footnote 1: E.B. Andrews, _History of the United States_, Vol. 1, p.  172.]    [Footnote 2: _Ibid._, p. 172.]    The differences, therefore, between the Committees of Fifty and  Fifty-one were merely political. One favoured agitation for the  purpose of arousing resistance to the King's summary methods--the  other preferred a more orderly but not less forceful way of making  known their opposition. Members of both committees were patriots in  the highest and best sense, yet each faction fancied itself the only  patriotic, public spirited and independent party.    It was during these months of discord that Alexander Hamilton, then a  lad of seventeen, astonished his listeners at the historic meeting \"in  the Fields,\"[3] with the cogency of his arguments and the wonderful  flights of an unpremeditated eloquence while denouncing the act of  Parliament which closed the port of Boston. Hamilton had already been  a year in America attending the Elizabethtown grammar school,  conducted under the patronage of William Livingston, soon to become  the famous war governor of New Jersey. This experience quickened the  young man's insight into the vexed relations between the Colonies and  the Crown, and shattered his English predilections in favour of the  little minds that Burke thought so ill-suited to a great empire. A  visit to Boston shortly after the \"tea party\" seems also to have had  the effect of crowding his mind with thoughts, deeply and  significantly freighted with the sentiment of liberty, which were soon  to make memorable the occasion of their first utterance.    [Footnote 3: City Hall Park.]    The remarkable parallel between Hamilton and the younger Pitt begins  in this year, while both are in the schoolroom. Hamilton \"in the  Fields\" recalls Pitt at the bar of the House of Lords, amazing his  companions with the ripe intelligence and rare sagacity with which he  followed the debate, and the readiness with which he skilfully  formulated answers to the stately arguments of the wigged and powdered  nobles. Pitt, under the tuition of his distinguished father, was  fitted for the House of Commons as boys are fitted for college at  Exeter and Andover, and he entered Parliament before becoming of age.  Hamilton's preparation had been different. At twelve years of age he  was a clerk in a counting house on the island of Nevis in the West  Indies; at sixteen he entered a grammar school in New Jersey; at  seventeen he became a sophomore at King's College. It is then that he  spoke \"in the Fields\"--not as a sophomore, not as a precocious youth  with unripe thoughts, not as a boy orator--but as a man speaking with  the wisdom of genius.    After the meeting \"in the Fields\" patriotism proved stronger than  prejudice, and in November, 1774, the Committee of Fifty-one gave  place to a Committee of Sixty, charged with carrying out  recommendations of the Continental Congress. Soon after a Committee of  One Hundred, composed of members of the Committees of Fifty and  Fifty-one, assumed the functions of a municipal government. Finally,  in May, 1775, representatives were chosen from the several counties to  organise a Provincial Congress to take the place of the long  established legislature of the Colony, which had become so steeped in  toryism that it refused to recognise the action of any body of men who  resented the tyranny of Parliament. Thus, in the brief space of  eighteen months, the government of the Crown had been turned into a  government of the people.    For several months, however, the patriots of New York had desired a  more complete state government. All admitted that the revolutionary  committees were essentially local and temporary. Even the hottest Son  of Liberty came to fear the licentiousness of the people on the one  hand, and the danger from the army on the other. Nevertheless, the  Provincial Congress, whose members had been trained by harsh  experience to be stubborn in defence and sturdy in defiance, declined  to assume the responsibility of forming such a government as the  Continental Congress recommended. That body had itself come into  existence as a revolutionary legislature after the Provincial Assembly  had refused either to approve the proceedings of the first Continental  Congress, or to appoint delegates to the second; and, although it did  not hesitate to usurp temporarily the functions of the Tory Assembly,  to its great credit it believed the right of creating and framing a  new civil government belonged to the people; and, accordingly, on May  24, 1776, it recommended the election of new representatives who  should be specially authorised to form a government for New York.    The members of this new body were conspicuous characters in New York's  history for the next third of a century. Among them were John Jay,  George Clinton, James Duane, Philip Livingston, Philip Schuyler, and  Robert R. Livingston. The same men appeared in the Committee of  Safety, at the birth of the state government, as witnesses of the  helplessness of the Confederation, and as backers or backbiters of the  Federal Constitution. Among those associated with them were James  Clinton, Ezra L'Hommedieu, Marinus Willett, John Morin Scott,  Alexander McDougall, John Sloss Hobart, the Yateses, Abraham, Richard  and Robert; the Van Cortlandts, James, John and Philip; the Morrises,  Richard, Lewis and Gouverneur, and all the Livingstons. Only two  illustrious names are absent from these early patriotic lists, but  already Alexander Hamilton had won the heart of the people by his  wonderful eloquence and logic, and Aaron Burr, a comely lad of  nineteen, slender and graceful as a girl, with the features of his  beautiful mother and the refinement of his distinguished grandfather,  had thrown away his books to join Arnold on his way to Quebec. These  men passed into history in companies, but each left behind his own  trail of light. Where danger called, or civic duties demanded prudence  and profound sagacity, this band of patriots appeared in council and  in the camp, ready to answer to the roll-call of their country, and by  voice and vote set the pace which achieved independence.    The new Provincial Congress met at the courthouse in White Plains on  July 9, 1776, and, as evidence of the change from the old institutions  to the new, it adopted the name of the \"Convention of the  Representatives of the State of New York.\" As further evidence of the  new order of things it declared that New York began its existence as a  State on April 20, 1775. It also adopted as the law of the State such  parts of the common and statute law of England as were in force in the  Colony of New York on April 19, 1775.    By this time the British forces had become so active in the vicinity  of New York that the convention thought it advisable to postpone the  novel and romantic work of state-making until the threatened danger  had passed; but, before its hasty adjournment, by requesting officers  of justice to issue all processes and pleadings under the authority  and in the name of the State of New York, it served notice that King  and Parliament were no longer recognised as the source of political  authority. This appears to have been the first official mention of the  new title of the future government.[4] When the convention reassembled  on the first day of the following August it appointed John Jay  chairman of a committee to report the draft of a state constitution.    [Footnote 4: _Memorial History of the City of New York_, Vol. 2, p.  608.]    Jay was then thirty-one years old, a cautious, clever lawyer whose  abilities were to make a great impression upon the history of his  country. He belonged to a family of Huguenot merchants. The Jays lived  at La Rochelle until the revocation of the Edict of Nantes drove the  great-grandfather to England, where the family continued until 1686,  when Augustus, the grandfather, settled in New York. It was not a  family of aristocrats; but for more than a century the Jays had ranked  among the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22594"],[0,"Colonial Records of Virginia (#2)"],[1,"Assembly is prefaced with the  introductory note published with Mr. Bancroft's copy, to which a few  notes explanatory have been added.

The Colony was ruled during that period by laws written in  blood; and its history shows how the narrow selfishness of despotic  power could counteract the best efforts of benevolence. The colonists  suffered an extremity of distress too horrible to be described.  In April, 1619, Sir George Yeardley arrived. Of the emigrants who had  been sent over at great cost, not one in twenty then remained alive. \"In  James Citty were only those houses that Sir Thomas Gates built in the  tyme of his government, with one wherein the Governor allwayes dwelt,  and a church, built wholly at the charge of the inhabitants of that  citye, of timber, being fifty foote in length and twenty foot in  breadth.\" At Henrico, now Richmond, there were no more than \"three old  houses, a poor ruinated Church, with some few poore buildings in the  Islande.\"[1] \"For ministers to instruct the people, he founde only three  authorized, two others who never received their orders.\" \"The natives he  founde uppon doubtfull termes;\" so that when the twelve years of Sir  Thomas Smith's government expired, Virginia, according to the  \"judgements\" of those who were then members of the Colony, was \"in a  poore estate.\"[A]    From the moment of Yeardley's arrival dates the real life of Virginia.  He brought with him \"Commissions and instructions from the Company for  the better establishinge of a Commonwealth heere.\"[B] He made  proclamation, \"that those cruell lawes by which we\" (I use the words of  the Ancient Planters themselves) \"had soe longe been governed, were now  abrogated, and that we were to be governed by those free lawes which his  Majesties subjectes live under in Englande.\" Nor were these  considerations made dependent on the good will of administrative  officers.    \"And that they might have a hande in the governinge of themselves,\" such  are the words of the Planters, \"yt was graunted that a generall  Assemblie shoulde be helde yearly once, whereat were to be present the  Gov^r and Counsell w^{th} two Burgesses from each Plantation, freely to  be elected by the Inhabitants thereof, this Assemblie to have power to  make and ordaine whatsoever lawes and orders should by them be thought  good and proffitable for our subsistance.\"[C]    In conformity with these instructions, Sir George Yeardley \"sente his  summons all over the country, as well to invite those of the Counsell of  Estate that were absente, as also for the election of Burgesses;\"[D] and  on Friday, the 30th day of July, 1619, the first elective legislative  body of this continent assembled at James City.    In the relation of Master John Rolfe, inserted by Captain John Smith in  his History of Virginia,[E] there is this meagre notice of the Assembly:  \"The 25 of June came in the _Triall_ with Corne and Cattell in all  safety, which tooke from vs cleerely all feare of famine; then our  gouernor and councell caused Burgesses to be chosen in all places and  met at a generall Assembly, where all matters were debated thought  expedient for the good of the Colony.\"  This account did not attract the attention of Beverley, the early  historian of Virginia, who denies that there was any Assembly held there  before May, 1620.[F]    The careful Stith, whose work is not to be corrected without a hearty  recognition of his superior diligence and exemplary fidelity, gives an  account[G] of this first legislative body, though he errs a little in  the date by an inference from Rolfe's narrative, which the words do not  warrant.    The prosperity of Virginia begins with the day when it received, as \"a  commonwealth,\" the freedom to make laws for itself. In a solemn address  to King James, which was made during the government of Sir Francis  Wyatt, and bears the signature of the Governor, Council, and apparently  every member of the Assembly, a contrast is drawn between the former  \"miserable bondage,\" and \"this just and gentle authoritye which hath  cherished us of late by more worthy magistrates. And we, our wives and  poor children shall ever pray to God, as our bounden duty is, to give  you in this worlde all increase of happines, and to crowne you in the  worlde to come w^{th} immortall glorye.\"[H]    A desire has long existed to recover the record of the proceedings of  the Assembly which inaugurated so happy a revolution. Stith was unable  to find it; no traces of it were met by Jefferson; and Hening,[I] and  those who followed Hening, believed it no longer extant. Indeed, it was  given up as hopelessly lost.    Having, during a long period of years, instituted a very thorough  research among the papers relating to America in the British State Paper  Office, partly in person and partly with the assistance of able and  intelligent men employed in that Department, I have at last been so  fortunate as to obtain the \"Proceedings of the First Assembly of  Virginia.\"[5] the document is in the form of \"a reporte\" from the  Speaker; and is more fall and circumstantial than any subsequent  journal of early legislation in the Ancient Dominion.    Many things are noticeable. The Governor and Council sat with the  Burgesses; and took part in motions and debates. The Secretary of the  Colony was chosen Speaker, and I am not sure that he was a Burgess.[6]  This first American Assembly set the precedent of beginning legislation  with prayer. It is evident that Virginia was then as thoroughly a Church  of England colony, as Connecticut afterwards was a Calvinistic one. The  inauguration of legislative power in the Ancient Dominion preceded the  existence of negro slavery, which we will believe it is destined also to  survive. The earliest Assembly in the oldest of the original thirteen  States, at its first session, took measures \"towards the erecting of\" a  \"University and Colledge.\" Care was also taken for the education of  Indian children. Extravagance in dress was not prohibited, but the  ministers were to profit by a tax on excess in apparel. On the whole,  the record of these Proceedings will justify the opinion of Sir Edward  Sandys, that \"they were very well and judiciously carried.\" The  different functions of government may have been confounded and the laws  were not framed according to any speculative theory; but a perpetual  interest attaches to the first elective body representing the people of  Virginia, more than a year before the Mayflower, with the Pilgrims, left  the harbor of Southampton, and while Virginia was still the oldest  British Colony on the whole Continent of America.
