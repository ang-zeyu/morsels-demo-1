Coiling her long  tongue out of her way, she quickly made her escape.    So Johnnie Green lost her. But she was not all that he lost. A strange  accident happened just as he fell, for old dog Spot leaped forward at  the same time. And, much to his surprise, Spot found his head inside the  butterfly net. The long broomstick handle thumped him sharply on his  back. And the silly fellow took fright at once.    With yelps of terror he scurried out of the flower garden. And Johnnie  picked himself up just in time to see Spot tearing across the meadow  toward the woods.    \"Spot! Spot! Come back!\" Johnnie Green shouted. But old Spot paid no  attention to his young master. Perhaps he was too scared to hear him.    Spot wanted to get rid of that net that covered his head. And he knew of  no better place to go than the woods where he hoped to be able to free  himself from his odd muzzle by rubbing against a tree or nosing among  some bushes.    Johnnie ran a little way after him. But when he saw Spot duck into the  woods he turned back sadly towards the house. For all he knew, old Spot  might run a mile further before he stopped.    Johnnie would have to make a new net if he wanted to catch any more  butterflies for his collection.    And the trouble was, he had no more mosquito netting.    A good many of the field people saw old Spot as he dashed off with the  butterfly net over his head. And they enjoyed a hearty laugh at the  strange sight.    As for Betsy Butterfly, she had learned to watch out for Johnnie Green.  And she knew that another time he would have to be twice as spry as he  had shown himself, if he expected to capture her.    Old Spot didn't come home till afternoon. When he appeared at last he  looked very sheepish. He hoped no one had noticed his fright. And he  wouldn't go near the flower garden again for a whole week.          IV    BUSYBODIES      LITTLE Mrs. Ladybug said that she wished Betsy Butterfly no ill luck.  But she thought that perhaps it would have been a good thing for her if  Johnnie Green had caught her and put her in his collection.    On hearing that strange remark Mehitable Moth turned quite pale. She  never wanted Johnnie Green's name mentioned by anyone, because she lived  in constant terror for fear he might mistake her for one of the  Butterfly family and capture her.    \"What _do_ you mean?\" she asked Mrs. Ladybug, while fat Jennie Junebug  waddled nearer them, in order to hear everything they said. Though  Jennie was sleepy, having stayed out very late the night before, the  promise of a bit of gossip made her brighten up at once.    \"I mean--\" said Mrs. Ladybug--\"I mean that Johnnie Green would certainly  have brushed Betsy Butterfly before adding her to his collection.\" And  then, seeing a blank look on the faces of her hearers, she cried. \"Don't  tell me you haven't noticed how untidy Betsy Butterfly is! Can it be  possible that the airs she gives herself, and her fine manners, have  deceived you?\"    \"What is it?\" asked Mehitable Moth breathlessly. And as for Jennie  Junebug, her breath was coming so fast that she couldn't say a word.    \"I'll tell you exactly what I mean,\" Mrs. Ladybug continued. \"I stopped  and spoke to Betsy Butterfly this very morning. And I stepped up close  to her, because I wanted to see if she really does paint her wings, as  my friend Miss Moth, here, suspects,\" Mrs. Ladybug explained to Jennie  Junebug. \"And what do you think? I saw that Betsy Butterfly was  _completely covered with dust_, from head to foot!\"    Mehitable Moth looked rather uncomfortable. She was somewhat dusty  herself. And she thought that Mrs. Ladybug might be giving her a sly  dig.    \"Perhaps Betsy had been on a journey,\" she ventured.    \"Ah! But there is no dust to-day, on account of the rain we had last  night,\" Mrs. Ladybug replied. \"I'm convinced that the dust I saw on  Betsy Butterfly was _weeks old_.\"    \"The idea!\" Jennie Junebug exclaimed. \"I should think she'd be ashamed  of herself. Did you tell her how untidy she looked?\"    Mrs. Ladybug shook her head.    \"No!\" she answered. \"But I've been thinking the matter over. And I  believe it's my duty to speak to her about it. I don't see what she's  thinking of, to go about looking like that!\"    Miss Moth looked more uneasy than ever, especially when Mrs. Ladybug  said:    \"Wouldn't you like to come with me while I look for Betsy?\"    \"I must go home now, thank you!\" said Mehitable. And she hurried away  without another word.    But Jennie Junebug spoke up at once and said she would be delighted to  accompany Mrs. Ladybug.    \"Really,\" Jennie confided to her companion, \"it's a good thing to have  backs as hard and slippery as yours and mine. For the dust can't stick  to us as it does to some.\"    \"There's no excuse for not keeping oneself neat,\" Mrs. Ladybug said  severely. \"And I shall give Betsy Butterfly a piece of my mind.\"          V    NO JOKER      MUCH to Mrs. Ladybug's surprise, she did not find Betsy Butterfly in the  flower garden.    \"It's too bad she's not here,\" Mrs. Ladybug remarked to her friend  Jennie Junebug, who accompanied her. \"We'll have to look in the meadow.  And it may take a long time to find Betsy there.\"    Jennie Junebug yawned right in Mrs. Ladybug's face.    \"Then I can't come with you,\" she said. \"I'm getting terribly sleepy  again. And since I expect to be up all night, I'm going to take a nap.\"    Mrs. Ladybug looked at Jennie with great disapproval as that fat young  person crept under a leaf and went to sleep.    \"Things have come to a pretty pass when ladies stay out all night!\" she  muttered. \"It was not that way when I was a girl. But times have changed  for the worse.\"    The longer Mrs. Ladybug stared at her sleeping friend, the more she  thought that she ought to wake her up. \"If I rouse her she'll be so  drowsy to-night that she'll simply have to go to bed,\" Mrs. Ladybug  thought.    So she poked Jennie Junebug several times.    But Jennie Junebug only stirred slightly and murmured something in her  sleep.    And seeing that it was useless to try to awaken her Mrs. Ladybug set out  for the meadow alone.    The sun hung low in the west when Mrs. Ladybug found Betsy Butterfly  among a clump of milk-weed blossoms. But Mrs. Ladybug did not care what  time it was. She was satisfied when she saw that Betsy was just as dusty  as ever. For, to tell the truth, little Mrs. Ladybug was so jealous of  the beautiful Betsy that she _wanted_ to say something disagreeable to  her.    \"Hasn't this been a lovely day?\" Betsy Butterfly cried happily, as soon  as she noticed Mrs. Ladybug. \"I've enjoyed every moment of it. Ever  since I saw you in the flower garden this morning I've been here in the  meadow, flitting from one blossom to another.\"    \"You might better have spent a little of your time in a different way,\"  Mrs. Ladybug remarked with a frown.    Betsy Butterfly looked up in surprise, withdrawing her long tongue from  the blossom in which she had just buried it.    \"_Ugh!_\" A shudder shook prim Mrs. Ladybug. \"Please coil your tongue!\"  she begged. \"I can't bear the sight of it. But I must say that I ought  not to expect good manners in a person who goes about looking as untidy  as you do.\"    Betsy Butterfly laughed gaily.    \"I didn't know you were such a joker!\" she exclaimed.    \"Oh, I'm not joking,\" Mrs. Ladybug said. \"I mean every word I say.\"    \"Then I wouldn't talk so much, if I were you,\" Betsy Butterfly advised  her with a merry twinkle in her eye. And before Mrs. Ladybug could say  another word Betsy Butterfly flew away and left her spluttering and  choking.    \"She insulted me!\" Mrs. Ladybug screamed, as soon as she was able to  speak. \"She insulted me. And then she hurried off because she didn't  dare stay!\"    But Mrs. Ladybug was mistaken about one thing. Betsy Butterfly knew that  she had just time to reach home before sunset. So that was why she left  so suddenly. For she never was willing to travel when the sun was not  shining.    \"I'll see Betsy in the morning,\" Mrs. Ladybug promised herself savagely.  \"I'll make it my business to follow her everywhere she goes, until I've  given her a good talking to.\"          VI    MRS. LADYBUG'S ADVICE      LITTLE did Betsy Butterfly guess what Mrs. Ladybug intended to say to  her. And if she had known what it was she would have been merely amused.  For Betsy was entirely too sweet-tempered to take offense at anybody's  fault-finding--least of all that of Mrs. Ladybug, who was really a  good-hearted soul, when she wasn't jealous. And when Betsy went to the  flower garden early the next morning she felt kindly towards the whole  world, not even excepting Johnnie Green, though he had tried to capture  her.    Well, Mrs. Ladybug was waiting for Betsy Butterfly among the flowers.  She had been in such haste to reach the garden early that she had not  stopped to have her breakfast. And like many people who have not drunk  their morning cup of coffee, she was in a very peevish mood.    \"Now, Miss Pert, I want you to listen to me!\" That was Mrs. Ladybug's  greeting to Betsy Butterfly on one of the most delightful days of the  whole summer. \"It's my unpleasant duty--\" said Mrs. Ladybug, who by that  time was enjoying herself thoroughly--\"it's my unpleasant duty to tell  you that people are talking about you. They say that you're going about  _covered with dust_! And as a friend, I advise you to give yourself a  thorough brushing each morning, and as often thereafter as may be  necessary.\"    Betsy Butterfly had listened in amazement to Mrs. Ladybug's words. And  she had hard work not to laugh, too, because she thought Mrs. Ladybug's  advice decidedly funny.    \"Thank you very much!\" Betsy said most politely. \"I'll remember what  you've told me.\"    Somehow Mrs. Ladybug thought that Betsy meant she would follow her  advice. And she looked quite pleased.    \"I shall expect a great"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21324"],[0,"Recollections of Old Liverpool (#2)"],[1,"in the following pages,  appeared originally the _Liverpool Compass_, their publication extending  over a period of several months.    When they were commenced it was intended to limit them to three, or at  the most four, chapters, but such was the interest they created, that  they were extended to their present length.    Those who have recorded the green memories of an old man, as told while  seated by his humble \"ingle nook\" have endeavoured to adhere to his own  words and mode of narration--hence the somewhat rambling and discursive  style of these \"Recollections\"--a style which does not, in the opinion of  many, by any means detract from their general interest.    The frontispiece is copied (by special permission) from part of a very  finely-painted view of Liverpool, by Jenkinson, dated 1813, in the  possession of Thomas Dawson, Esq., Rodney-street.  The vignette of the  Mill which stood at the North end of the St. James' Quarry in the title  page, is from an original water colour drawing by an amateur (name  unknown), dated 1821.    _November_, 1863.          CHAPTER I.      I was born in Liverpool, on the 4th of June in 1769 or '70.  I am  consequently about ninety-three years old.  My friends say I am a  wonderful old man.  I believe I am.  I have always enjoyed such excellent  health, that I do not know what the sensation is of a medical man putting  his finger on my wrist.  I have eaten and drunk in moderation, slept  little, risen early, and kept a clear conscience before God and man.  My  memory is surprising.  I am often astonished at myself in recalling to  mind events, persons, and circumstances, that occurred so long ago as to  be almost forgotten by everybody else.    I can recollect every occurrence that has fallen under my cognizance,  since I was six years old.  I do not remember so well events that have  taken place during the last twenty or thirty years, as they seem confused  to me; but whatever happened of which I had some knowledge during my  boyish days and early manhood, is most vividly impressed upon my memory.  My family have been long-livers.  My father was ninety odd, when he died,  my mother near that age at her death.  My brother and sister are still  living, are healthy, and, like myself, in comfortable circumstances.    I may be seen any fine day on the Pier-head or Landing-stage, accompanied  by one of my dear great grandchildren; but you would not take me to be  more than sixty by my air and appearance.    We lived in a street out of Church-street, nearly opposite St. Peter's.  I was born there.  At that time the churchyard was enclosed by trees, and  the gravestones were erect.  One by one the trees died or were destroyed  by mischievous boys, and unfortunately they were not replaced.  The  church presented then a very pretty appearance.  Within the last thirty  years there was one tree standing nearly opposite to the Blue Coat  School.  When that tree died, I regretted its loss as of an old friend.  The stocks were placed just within the rails, nearly opposite the present  extensive premises occupied by the Elkingtons.  Many and many a man have  I seen seated in them for various light offences, though in many cases  the punishment was heavy, especially if the culprit was obnoxious in any  way, or had made himself so by his own conduct.  The town boys were very  cruel in my young days.  It was a cruel time, and the effects of the  slave-trade and privateering were visible in the conduct of the lower  classes and of society generally.  Goodness knows the town boys are cruel  now, but they are angels to what their predecessors were.  I think  education has done some good.  All sorts of mischievous tricks used to be  played upon the culprits in the stocks; and I have seen stout and sturdy  fellows faint under the sufferings they endured.  By the way, at the top  of Marybone, there was once a large pond, called the Flashes, where there  was a ducking-post and this was a favourite place of punishment when the  Lynch Law of that time was carried out.  I once saw a woman ducked there.  She might have said with Queen Catherine:--        \"Do with me what you will,      For any change must better my condition.\"    There was a terrible row caused once by the rescue of a woman from the  Cuckstool.  At one time it threatened to be serious.  The mayor was  dining at my father's, and I recollect he was sent for in a great hurry,  and my father and his guests all went with him to the pond.  The woman  was nearly killed, and her life for long despaired of.  She was taken to  the Infirmary, on the top of Shaw's Brow, where St. George's Hall now  stands.  The way they ducked was this.  A long pole, which acted as a  lever, was placed on a post; at the end of the pole was a chair, in which  the culprit was seated; and by ropes at the other end of the lever or  pole, the culprit was elevated or dipped in the water at the mercy of the  wretches who had taken upon themselves the task of executing punishment.  The screams of the poor women who were ducked were frightful.  There was  a ducking tub in the House of Correction, which was in use in Mr.  Howard's time.  I once went with him through the prison (as I shall  describe presently) and saw it there.  It was not till 1804 or 1805 that  it was done away with.    My father was owner and commander of the _Mary Ellen_.  She was launched  on the 4th of June, my birthday, and also the anniversary of our revered  sovereign, George III.  We used to keep his majesty's birthday in great  style.  The bells were set ringing, cannon fired, colours waved in the  wind, and all the schools had holiday.  We don't love the gracious Lady  who presides over our destinies less than we did her august grandfather,  but I am sure we do not keep her birthday as we did his.  The _Mary  Ellen_ was launched on the 4th of June, 1775.  She was named after and by  my mother.  The launch of this ship is about the first thing I can  remember.  The day's proceedings are indelibly fixed upon my memory.  We  went down to the place where the ship was built, accompanied by our  friends.  We made quite a little procession, headed by a drum and fife.  My father and mother walked first, leading me by the hand.  I had new  clothes on, and I firmly believed that the joy bells were ringing solely  because _our_ ship was to be launched.  The _Mary Ellen_ was launched  from a piece of open ground just beyond the present Salt-house Dock, then  called, \"the South Dock.\"  I suppose the exact place would be somewhere  about the middle of the present King's Dock.  The bank on which the ship  was built sloped down to the river.  There was a slight boarding round  her.  There were several other ships and smaller vessels building near  her; amongst others, a frigate which afterwards did great damage to the  enemy during the French war.  The government frequently gave orders for  ships to be built at Liverpool.  The view up the river was very fine.  There were few houses to be seen southward.  The mills on the  Aigburth-road were the principal objects.    It was a pretty sight to see the _Mary Ellen_ launched.  There were  crowds of people present, for my father was well-known and very popular.  When the ship moved off there was a great cheer raised.  I was so excited  at the great \"splash\" which was made, that I cried, and was for a time  inconsolable, because they would not launch the ship again, so that I  might witness another great \"splash.\"  I can, in my mind's eye, see \"the  splash\" of the _Mary Ellen_ even now.  I really believe the displacement  of the water on that occasion opened the doors of observation in my mind.  After the launch there was great festivity and hilarity.  I believe I  made myself very ill with the quantity of fruit and good things I became  possessed of.  While the _Mary Ellen_ was fitting-up for sea, I was often  taken on board.  In her hold were long shelves with ring-bolts in rows in  several places.  I used to run along these shelves, little thinking what  dreadful scenes would be enacted upon them.  The fact is that the _Mary  Ellen_ was destined for the African trade, in which she made many very  successful voyages.  In 1779, however, she was converted into a  privateer.  My father, at the present time, would not, perhaps, be  thought very respectable; but I assure you he was so considered in those  days.  So many people in Liverpool were, to use an old and trite  sea-phrase, \"tarred with the same brush\" that these occupations were  scarcely, indeed, were not at all, regarded as anything derogatory from a  man's character.  In fact, during the privateering time, there was  scarcely a man, woman, or child in Liverpool, of any standing, that did  not hold a share in one of these ships.  Although a slave captain, and  afterwards a privateer, my father was a kind and just man--a good father,  husband, and friend.  His purse and advice were always ready to help and  save, and he was, consequently, much respected by the merchants with whom  he had intercourse.  I have been told that he was quite a different man  at sea, that there he was harsh, unbending and stern, but still just.  How he used to rule the turbulent spirits of his crews I don't know, but  certain it is that he never wanted men when other Liverpool ship-owners  were short of hands.  Many of his seamen sailed voyage after voyage with  him.  It was these old hands that were attached to him who I suspect kept  the others in subjection.  The men used to make much of me.  They made me  little sea toys, and always brought my mother and myself presents from  Africa, such as parrots, monkeys, shells, and articles of the natives'  workmanship.  I recollect very well, after the _Mary Ellen_ had been  converted into a privateer, that, on her return from a successful West  Indian cruise, the mate of the ship, a great big fellow, named Blake, and  who was one of the roughest and most ungainly men ever seen,"]]]
