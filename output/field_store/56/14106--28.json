No, I am inclined to  think that it is some inward-bound craft, becalmed like ourselves.  We  caught the sound of some order spoken on board her when we first became  aware of her presence, and Mr Fortescue here was of opinion that the  words used were Spanish, although the distance was too great to enable  us to distinguish just what was said.\"    \"Ay,\" responded the skipper; \"two out of every three slavers doing  business on this coast are either Spaniards or Portuguese.  Now, the  question is, What are we to do with regard to our unknown friend out  yonder?  Either she is, or is not, the craft that we are on the look-out  for.  If she _is_, we must take her, by hook or by crook, before the  sea-breeze sets in and gives her the chance to run away from us; and  that means a jaunt in the boats.  On the other hand, if she is not the  craft that we are after, she is still in all probability a slaver, and  in any case will doubtless pay for an overhaul, which again means a boat  trip.  Therefore, Mr Perry, be good enough to have the hands called,  and the boats got into the water as silently as possible.  If the men  are quick we may be able to get away, and perhaps alongside her, before  the dawn breaks.  I will take charge of this little pleasure-party  myself, and you can stay here and keep house during my absence.\"    \"Ay, ay, sir,\" answered Perry, in tones which clearly betrayed his  disappointment at the arrangement come to by the skipper.  \"I will put  matters in hand.\"    \"Yes, do,\" returned the skipper; \"and meanwhile I will go and dress.  It  shall be your turn next time, Perry,\" he chuckled, as he turned away to  go below again.    \"Ay,\" grumbled the lieutenant to himself, but audibly enough for me to  hear.  \"Same old yarn--`your turn next time, Perry.'  This will make the  third time running that I have been left behind to `keep house,' but  there's not going to be a fourth, I'll see to that; it is time that this  child stood up for his rights.  Now, Mr Fortescue, have the goodness,  if you please, to pass the word for all hands to arm and man boats; and  to be quiet about it, too, and show no lights.\"    \"Ay, ay, sir,\" I briskly responded, as I turned to hurry away; \"I'll see  that our lambs don't bleat too loudly.  And--I suppose--that I may take  it for granted that--\"    \"That you will make one of the `pleasure-party'?\" interrupted the  lieutenant, with a laugh, as he put his disappointment and ill-humour  away from him.  \"Oh, yes, I suppose so.  At all events there will be no  harm in making your preparations; the captain is pretty certain to take  you.\"    Still on my bare feet, I hurried forward and found the boatswain.    \"That you, Mr Futtock?\"  I inquired, as I made out his burly form.    \"Ay, ay, Mr Fortescue, it's me, right enough,\" was the answer.  \"I  presoom, sir, it's another boat job, eh?  You heard that bell?\"    \"We did, Mr Futtock; yes, we heard it distinctly, seeing that we don't  `caulk' in our watch on deck,\" I retorted.  \"Yes, it's another boat  affair; so be good enough to have all hands called at once, if you  please.  And kindly make it your personal business to see that nobody  raises his voice, lets anything fall, or otherwise creates row enough to  wake the dead.  This is going to be a little surprise visit, you  understand.\"    \"Ay, ay, Mr Fortescue, I understands,\" answered Futtock, as he moved  toward the open hatchway; \"I'll see that the swabs don't make no noise.  The man that raises his voice above a whisper won't go.  That's all.\"    \"Just one word more, Mr Futtock,\" I hastily interposed, as the  boatswain stepped over the coaming to descend the hatchway.  \"You may do  me a favour, if you will.  Kindly ask the armourer to pick me out a nice  sharp cutlass, if you please.  You can bring it on deck with you when  you come up.\"    To this request the boatswain readily enough assented; and matters being  thus far satisfactorily arranged I descended to the cockroach-haunted  den wherein we mids. ate and slept, to find that little Tom  Copplestone--who shared my watch, and who was a special favourite of  mine because of his gentle, genial disposition, and also perhaps because  he hailed from the same county as myself--having overheard the  conversation between Mr Perry and myself, had already come below and  roused the occupants of the place, who, by the smoky rays of a flaring  oil lamp that did its best to make the atmosphere quite unendurable,  were hastily arraying themselves.    \"Murder!\"  I ejaculated, as I entered the pokey little place and got my  first whiff of its close, reeking, smoke-laden atmosphere; \"put out that  abominable lamp and light a candle or two, somebody, for pity's sake.  How the dickens you fellows can manage to breathe down here I can't  understand.  And, boy,\" to the messenger outside, \"pass the word for  Cupid to bring us along some cocoa from the galley.\"    \"There's no need,\" remarked Nugent, the master's mate, as he struggled  ineffectively to find the left sleeve of his jacket.  \"The word has  already been passed; I passed it myself when Master Cock-robin there,\"  pointing to Copplestone, \"came and roused us out.  And, as to candles,  I'm afraid we haven't any; the rats appear to have eaten the last two we  had in the locker.  However--ah, here comes the cocoa.  Put the pot down  there, Cupid--never mind if it _does_ soil our beautiful damask table-  cloth, we're going to have it washed next time we go into Sierra Leone.  And just see if you can find us a biscuit or two and some butter, will  ye, you black angel?  Here, avast there,\"--as the black was about to  retire--\"produce our best china breakfast-set before you go, you swab,  and pour out the cocoa.\"    The black, a herculean Krooboy, picked up when we first arrived on the  Coast, and promptly christened \"Cupid\" by the master's mate, who,  possibly because of sundry disappointments, had developed a somewhat  sardonic turn of humour, grinned appreciatively at Nugent's sorry jest  respecting \"our best china breakfast-set,\" and proceeded to rout out the  heterogeneous assortment of delf and tin cups, basins, and plates that  constituted the table-equipage of the midshipmen's berth, poured out a  generous allowance of cocoa for each of us, and then departed, with the  empty bread-barge, in quest of a supply of ship's biscuit.  By the time  that Cupid returned with this, we had gulped down our cocoa and were  ready to go on deck.  I therefore helped myself to a couple of biscuits  which, breaking into pieces of convenient size by the simple process of  dashing them against my elbow, I crammed into my jacket pocket, and then  rushed up the ladder to the deck, leaving my companions to follow after  they had snatched a hasty bite or two of food; for there was now no  knowing when we might get breakfast.    Upon my arrival on deck I found the hands already mustering under the  supervision of the first lieutenant, and a moment later I encountered  the boatswain, who handed over to me a good serviceable ship's cutlass--  worth a dozen of the ridiculous little dirks which were considered  suitable weapons for midshipmen--which I promptly girded about my waist.  At this moment all was bustle and animation throughout the ship, yet so  sedulously had we been trained to act in perfect silence that I am  certain the stealthy footfalls of the men hurrying to their stations,  and the whispered words of command, were quite inaudible at a distance  of twenty yards from the ship.  Within a minute or two, however, even  these faint sounds had subsided, the crew were all mustered, and the  first lieutenant, assisted by a quartermaster who carried a carefully  masked lantern, was carefully, yet rapidly, inspecting each man's  weapons and equipment, scrutinising the flints in the locks of the  pistols, and otherwise satisfying himself of the efficiency of our  hurried preparations.  While the inspection was still in progress the  captain came on deck, with his sword girded to his side and a brace of  pistols thrust into his belt, and stood quietly looking on until the  inspection was completed and Mr Perry had reported that everything was  in order.    Then the skipper announced that he would personally lead the attack in  his own gig, manned by eight oarsmen, a coxswain, and a midshipman--  myself; while the first cutter, manned by sixteen oarsmen, a coxswain,  and a midshipman--Jack Keene--was to be commanded by Mr Purchase, the  second lieutenant; and the second cutter, with twelve oarsmen, a  coxswain, and Nugent, the master's mate, was to be under the command of  the boatswain.  Thus the attacking party was to consist of forty-five  persons, all told, which was as many, I suppose, as the skipper felt  justified in taking out of the ship under the circumstances.    Then ensued a busy five minutes, during which the boats were being  noiselessly lowered and manned, the oars muffled, and every possible  precaution observed to enable us to take our unseen but doubtless  vigilant enemy unawares.  This was just then regarded as of especial  importance, for at the time of which I am now writing the traffic in  slaves was regarded as piracy, and rendered its perpetrators liable to  capital punishment, in consequence of which almost every slaver went  heavily armed, and her crew, knowing that the halter was already about  their necks, resisted capture by every means which their ingenuity could  devise, whenever they had the chance, and often fought with desperate  valour.    As I hurried"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21077"],[0,"The Mind and the Brain (#2)"],[1,"see that  certain authors put the distinction between the physical and the  mental in one thing, others in another. Thus there have been a very  large number of distinctions proposed, and their number is much  greater than is generally thought. Since we propose to make ourselves  judges of these distinctions, since, in fact, we shall reject most of  them in order to suggest entirely new ones, it must be supposed that  we shall do so by means of a criterion. Otherwise, we should only be  acting fantastically. We should be saying peremptorily, \"In my opinion  this is mental,\" and there would be no more ground for discussion  than, if the assertion were \"I prefer the Romanticists to the  Classicists,\" or \"I consider prose superior to poetry.\"    The criterion which I have employed, and which I did not analyse until  the unconscious use I had made of it revealed its existence to me, is  based on the two following rules:--    1. _A Rule of Method._--The distinction between mind and matter must  not only apply to the whole of the knowable, but must be the deepest  which can divide the knowable, and must further be one of a permanent  character. _A priori_, there is nothing to prove the existence of such  a distinction; it must be sought for and, when found, closely  examined.    2. _An Indication of the Direction in which the Search must be  Made._--Taking into account the position already taken up by the  majority of philosophers, the manifestation of mind, if it exists,  must be looked for in the domain of facts dealt with by psychology,  and the manifestation of matter in the domain explored by physicists.    I do not conceal from myself that there may be much that is arbitrary  in my own criterion; but this does not seem to me possible to avoid.  We must therefore appeal to psychology, and ask whether it is  cognisant of any phenomenon offering a violent, lasting, and  ineffaceable contrast with all the rest of the knowable.    _The Method of Concepts and the Method of Enumeration._--Many authors  are already engaged in this research, and employ a method which I  consider very bad and very dangerous--the method of concepts. This  consists in looking at real and concrete phenomena in their most  abstract form. For example, in studying the mind, they use this word  \"mind\" as a general idea which is supposed to contain all the  characteristics of psychical phenomena; but they do not wait to  enumerate these characteristics or to realise them, and they remain  satisfied with the extremely vague idea springing from an unanalysed  concept. Consequently they use the word \"mind\" with the imprudence of  a banker who should discount a trade bill without ascertaining  whether the payment of that particular piece of paper had been  provided for. This amounts to saying that the discussion of  philosophical problems takes especially a verbal aspect; and the more  complex the phenomena a concept thus handled, contains, the more  dangerous it is. A concept of the colour red has but a very simple  content, and by using it, this content can be very clearly  represented. But how can the immense meaning of the word \"mind\" be  realised every time that it is used? For example, to define mind and  to separate it from the rest of the knowable which is called matter,  the general mode of reasoning is as follows: all the knowable which is  apparent to our senses is essentially reduced to motion; \"mind,\" that  something which lives, feels, and judges, is reduced to \"thought.\" To  understand the difference between matter and mind, it is necessary to  ask one's self whether there exists any analogy in nature between  motion and thought. Now this analogy does not exist, and what we  comprehend, on the contrary, is their absolute opposition. Thought is  not a movement, and has nothing in common with a movement. A movement  is never anything else but a displacement, a transfer, a change of  place undergone by a particle of matter. What relation of similarity  exists between this geometrical fact and a desire, an emotion, a  sensation of bitterness? Far from being identical, these two facts  are as distinct as any facts can be, and their distinction is so deep  that it should be raised to the height of a principle, the principle  of heterogeneity.    This is almost exactly the reasoning that numbers of philosophers have  repeated for several years without giving proof of much originality.  This is what I term the metaphysics of concept, for it is a  speculation which consists in juggling with abstract ideas. The moment  that a philosopher opposes thought to movement, I ask myself under  what form he can think of a \"thought,\" I suppose he must very  poetically and very vaguely represent to himself something light and  subtle which contrasts with the weight and grossness of material  bodies. And thus our philosopher is punished in the sinning part; his  contempt of the earthly has led him into an abuse of abstract  reasoning, and this abuse has made him the dupe of a very naive  physical metaphor.    At bottom I have not much faith in the nobility of many of our  abstract ideas. In a former psychological study[2] I have shown that  many of our abstractions are nothing else than embryonic, and, above  all, loosely defined concrete ideas, which can satisfy only an  indolent mind, and are, consequently, full of snares.    The opposition between mind and matter appears to me to assume a very  different meaning if, instead of repeating ready-made formulas and  wasting time on the game of setting concept against concept, we take  the trouble to return to the study of nature, and begin by drawing up  an inventory of the respective phenomena of mind and matter, examining  with each of these phenomena the characteristics in which the  first-named differ from the second. It is this last method, more slow  but more sure than the other, that we shall follow; and we will  commence by the study of matter.    FOOTNOTES:    [Footnote 1: _L'Ame et la Corps._--Disagreeable as it is to alter an  author's title, the words \"Soul and Body\" had to be abandoned because  of their different connotation in English.

Binet's approval.--ED.]    [Footnote 2: _Etude experimentale de l'Intelligence._ Paris:  Schleicher.]          CHAPTER II    OUR KNOWLEDGE OF EXTERNAL OBJECTS IS ONLY SENSATIONS      Of late years numerous studies have been published on the conception  of matter, especially by physicists, chemists, and mathematicians.  Among these recent contributions to science I will quote the articles  of Duhem on the Evolution of Mechanics published in 1903 in the _Revue  generale des Sciences_, and other articles by the same author, in  1904, in the _Revue de Philosophie_. Duhem's views have attracted much  attention, and have dealt a serious blow at the whole theory of the  mechanics of matter. Let me also quote that excellent work of Dastre,  _La Vie et la Mort_, wherein the author makes so interesting an  application to biology of the new theories on energetics; the  discussion between Ostwald and Brillouin on matter, in which two rival  conceptions find themselves engaged in a veritable hand-to-hand  struggle (_Revue generale des Sciences_, Nov. and Dec. 1895); the  curious work of Dantec on _les Lois Naturelles_, in which the author  ingeniously points out the different sensorial districts into which  science is divided, although, through a defect in logic, he accepts  mechanics as the final explanation of things. And last, it is  impossible to pass over, in silence, the rare works of Lord Kelvin, so  full, for French readers, of unexpected suggestions, for they show us  the entirely practical and empirical value which the English attach to  mechanical models.    My object is not to go through these great studies in detail. It is  the part of mathematical and physical philosophers to develop their  ideas on the inmost nature of matter, while seeking to establish  theories capable of giving a satisfactory explanation of physical  phenomena. This is the point of view they take up by preference, and  no doubt they are right in so doing. The proper role of the natural  sciences is to look at phenomena taken by themselves and apart from  the observer.    My own intention, in setting forth these same theories on matter, is  to give prominence to a totally different point of view. Instead of  considering physical phenomena in themselves, we shall seek to know  what idea one ought to form of their nature when one takes into  account that they are observed phenomena. While the physicist  withdraws from consideration the part of the observer in the  verification of physical phenomena, our role is to renounce this  abstraction, to re-establish things in their original complexity, and  to ascertain in what the conception of matter consists when it is  borne in mind that all material phenomena are known only in their  relation to ourselves, to our bodies, our nerves, and our  intelligence.    This at once leads us to follow, in the exposition of the facts, an  order which the physicist abandons. Since we seek to know what is the  physical phenomenon we perceive, we must first enunciate this  proposition, which will govern the whole of our discussion: to wit--    _Of the outer world we know nothing except our sensations._    Before demonstrating this proposition, let us develop it by an example  which will at least give us some idea of its import. Let us take as  example one of those investigations in which, with the least possible  recourse to reasoning, the most perfected processes of observation are  employed, and in which one imagines that one is penetrating almost  into the very heart of nature. We are, let us suppose, dissecting an  animal. After killing it, we lay bare its viscera, examine their  colour, form, dimensions, and connections; then we dissect"]]]
