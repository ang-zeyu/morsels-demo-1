[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2347"],[0,"The Adventure of the Dying Detective (#2)"],[1,"-you are enough to drive a patient into an  asylum.  Sit down, man, and let me have my rest!\"    The incident left a most unpleasant impression upon my mind.  The  violent and causeless excitement, followed by this brutality of speech,  so far removed from his usual suavity, showed me how deep was the  disorganization of his mind.  Of all ruins, that of a noble mind is the  most deplorable.  I sat in silent dejection until the stipulated time  had passed.  He seemed to have been watching the clock as well as I,  for it was hardly six before he began to talk with the same feverish  animation as before.    \"Now, Watson,\" said he.  \"Have you any change in your pocket?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Any silver?\"    \"A good deal.\"    \"How many half-crowns?\"    \"I have five.\"    \"Ah, too few!  Too few!  How very unfortunate, Watson!  However, such  as they are you can put them in your watchpocket.  And all the rest of  your money in your left trouser pocket.  Thank you. It will balance you  so much better like that.\"    This was raving insanity.  He shuddered, and again made a sound between  a cough and a sob.    \"You will now light the gas, Watson, but you will be very careful that  not for one instant shall it be more than half on.  I implore you to be  careful, Watson.  Thank you, that is excellent. No, you need not draw  the blind.  Now you will have the kindness to place some letters and  papers upon this table within my reach. Thank you.  Now some of that  litter from the mantelpiece. Excellent, Watson!  There is a sugar-tongs  there.  Kindly raise that small ivory box with its assistance.  Place  it here among the papers.  Good!  You can now go and fetch Mr.  Culverton Smith, of 13 Lower Burke Street.\"    To tell the truth, my desire to fetch a doctor had somewhat weakened,  for poor Holmes was so obviously delirious that it seemed dangerous to  leave him.  However, he was as eager now to consult the person named as  he had been obstinate in refusing.    \"I never heard the name,\" said I.    \"Possibly not, my good Watson.  It may surprise you to know that the  man upon earth who is best versed in this disease is not a medical man,  but a planter.  Mr. Culverton Smith is a well-known resident of  Sumatra, now visiting London.  An outbreak of the disease upon his  plantation, which was distant from medical aid, caused him to study it  himself, with some rather far-reaching consequences.  He is a very  methodical person, and I did not desire you to start before six,  because I was well aware that you would not find him in his study.  If  you could persuade him to come here and give us the benefit of his  unique experience of this disease, the investigation of which has been  his dearest hobby, I cannot doubt that he could help me.\"    I gave Holmes's remarks as a consecutive whole and will not attempt to  indicate how they were interrupted by gaspings for breath and those  clutchings of his hands which indicated the pain from which he was  suffering.  His appearance had changed for the worse during the few  hours that I had been with him.  Those hectic spots were more  pronounced, the eyes shone more brightly out of darker hollows, and a  cold sweat glimmered upon his brow. He still retained, however, the  jaunty gallantry of his speech. To the last gasp he would always be the  master.    \"You will tell him exactly how you have left me,\" said he.  \"You will  convey the very impression which is in your own mind--a dying man--a  dying and delirious man.  Indeed, I cannot think why the whole bed of  the ocean is not one solid mass of oysters, so prolific the creatures  seem.  Ah, I am wandering!  Strange how the brain controls the brain!  What was I saying, Watson?\"    \"My directions for Mr. Culverton Smith.\"    \"Ah, yes, I remember.  My life depends upon it.  Plead with him,  Watson.  There is no good feeling between us.  His nephew, Watson--I  had suspicions of foul play and I allowed him to see it.  The boy died  horribly.  He has a grudge against me.  You will soften him, Watson.  Beg him, pray him, get him here by any means.  He can save me--only he!\"    \"I will bring him in a cab, if I have to carry him down to it.\"    \"You will do nothing of the sort.  You will persuade him to come. And  then you will return in front of him.  Make any excuse so as not to  come with him.  Don't forget, Watson.  You won't fail me. You never did  fail me.  No doubt there are natural enemies which limit the increase  of the creatures.  You and I, Watson, we have done our part.  Shall the  world, then, be overrun by oysters? No, no; horrible!  You'll convey  all that is in your mind.\"    I left him full of the image of this magnificent intellect babbling  like a foolish child.  He had handed me the key, and with a happy  thought I took it with me lest he should lock himself in.  Mrs. Hudson  was waiting, trembling and weeping, in the passage.  Behind me as I  passed from the flat I heard Holmes's high, thin voice in some  delirious chant.  Below, as I stood whistling for a cab, a man came on  me through the fog.    \"How is Mr. Holmes, sir?\" he asked.    It was an old acquaintance, Inspector Morton, of Scotland Yard, dressed  in unofficial tweeds.    \"He is very ill,\" I answered.    He looked at me in a most singular fashion.  Had it not been too  fiendish, I could have imagined that the gleam of the fanlight showed  exultation in his face.    \"I heard some rumour of it,\" said he.    The cab had driven up, and I left him.    Lower Burke Street proved to be a line of fine houses lying in the  vague borderland between Notting Hill and Kensington.  The particular  one at which my cabman pulled up had an air of smug and demure  respectability in its old-fashioned iron railings, its massive  folding-door, and its shining brasswork.  All was in keeping with a  solemn butler who appeared framed in the pink radiance of a tinted  electrical light behind him.    \"Yes, Mr. Culverton Smith is in.  Dr. Watson!  Very good, sir, I will  take up your card.\"    My humble name and title did not appear to impress Mr. Culverton Smith.  Through the half-open door I heard a high, petulant, penetrating voice.    \"Who is this person?  What does he want?  Dear me, Staples, how often  have I said that I am not to be disturbed in my hours of study?\"    There came a gentle flow of soothing explanation from the butler.    \"Well, I won't see him, Staples.  I can't have my work interrupted like  this.  I am not at home.  Say so.  Tell him to come in the morning if  he really must see me.\"    Again the gentle murmur.    \"Well, well, give him that message.  He can come in the morning, or he  can stay away.  My work must not be hindered.\"    I thought of Holmes tossing upon his bed of sickness and counting the  minutes, perhaps, until I could bring help to him.  It was not a time  to stand upon ceremony.  His life depended upon my promptness.  Before  the apologetic butler had delivered his message I had pushed past him  and was in the room.    With a shrill cry of anger a man rose from a reclining chair beside the  fire.  I saw a great yellow face, coarse-grained and greasy, with  heavy, double-chin, and two sullen, menacing gray eyes which glared at  me from under tufted and sandy brows.  A high bald head had a small  velvet smoking-cap poised coquettishly upon one side of its pink curve.  The skull was of enormous capacity, and yet as I looked down I saw to  my amazement that the figure of the man was small and frail, twisted in  the shoulders and back like one who has suffered from rickets in his  childhood.    \"What's this?\" he cried in a high, screaming voice.  \"What is the  meaning of this intrusion?  Didn't I send you word that I would see you  to-morrow morning?\"    \"I am sorry,\" said I, \"but the matter cannot be delayed.  Mr. Sherlock  Holmes--\"    The mention of my friend's name had an extraordinary effect upon the  little man.  The look of anger passed in an instant from his face.  His  features became tense and alert.    \"Have you come from Holmes?\" he asked.    \"I have just left him.\"    \"What about Holmes?  How is he?\"    \"He is desperately ill.  That is why I have come.\"    The man motioned me to a chair, and turned to resume his own.  As he  did so I caught a glimpse of his face in the mirror over the  mantelpiece.  I could have sworn that it was set in a malicious and  abominable smile.  Yet I persuaded myself that it must have been some  nervous contraction which I had surprised, for he turned to me an  instant later with genuine concern upon his features.    \"I am sorry to hear this,\" said he.  \"I only know Mr. Holmes through  some business dealings which we have had, but I have every respect for  his talents and his character.  He is an amateur of crime, as I am of  disease.  For him the villain, for me the microbe. There are my  prisons,\" he continued, pointing to a row of bottles and jars which  stood upon a side table. \"Among those gelatine cultivations some of the  very worst offenders in the world are now doing time.\"    \"It was on account of your special knowledge that Mr. Holmes desired to  see you.  He has a high opinion of you and thought that you were the  one man in London who could help him.\"    The little man started, and the jaunty smoking-cap slid to the floor.    \"Why?\" he asked.  \"Why should Mr. Homes think that I could help him in  his trouble?\"    \"Because of your knowledge of Eastern diseases.\"    \"But why should he think that this disease which he has contracted is  Eastern?\"    \"Because, in some professional inquiry, he has been working among  Chinese sailors down in the docks.\"    Mr. Culverton Smith smiled pleasantly and picked up his smoking-cap.    \"Oh, that's it--is it?\" said he.  \"I trust the matter is not so grave  as you suppose.  How long has he been ill?\"    \"About three days.\"    \"Is he delirious?\"    \"Occasionally.\"    \"Tut, tut!  This sounds serious.  It would be inhuman not to answer his  call.  I very much resent any"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23475"],[0,"The Works of Lord Byron.

[_Sardanapale, Tragedie Imitee de Lord Byron_, par L. Alvin, was  performed at the Theatre Royal at Brussels, January 13, 16, 1834.    _Sardanapalus_, a Tragedy, was played for the first time at Drury Lane  Theatre, April 10, 1834, and (for the twenty-second time) June 5, 1834.  Macready appeared as \"Sardanapalus,\" Miss Phillips as \"Zarina,\" and Miss  Ellen Tree as \"Myrrha.\" [In his diary for April 11, 1834 (see  _Reminiscences_, 1875, i. 414, 415) Macready wrote, \"On arriving at my  chambers ... I found a letter without a signature; the seal was the head  of Byron, and in the envelope was a folded sheet with merely the words,  'Werner, Nov., 1830. Byron, Ravenna, 1821,' and 'Sardanapalus, April  10th, 1834.' Encircling the name of Byron, etc., was a lock of grey hair  fastened by a gold thread, which I am sure was Byron's, ... it surprised  and pleased me.\"]    _Sardanapalus, King of Assyria_, was produced at the Princess's Theatre,  June 13, 1853, and played till September 2, 1853. Charles Kean appeared  as \"Sardanapalus,\" Miss Heath as \"Zarina,\" and Mrs. Charles Kean as  \"Myrrha.\"    _Sardanapale, Opera en Trois Actes_, par M. Henry Becque, Musique de M.  Victorin Joncieres, was performed for the first time at the Theatre  Imperial-Lyrique, February 8, 1867.    _Lord Byron's Tragedy of Sardanapalus_, in four acts, was performed at  the Theatre Royal, Manchester, March 31-April 28, 1877. Charles Calvert  (the adapter) played \"Sardanapalus,\" Miss Hathaway \"Zarina,\" and Miss  Fanny Ensor \"Myrrha;\" and June 26-July 27, 1877, at the Royal Alexandra  Theatre, Liverpool. Calvert's adaptation was also performed at Booth's  Theatre, New York.]                                INTRODUCTION TO _SARDANAPALUS_      Byron's passion or infatuation for the regular drama lasted a little  over a year. _Marino Faliero_, _Sardanapalus_, and the _Two Foscari_,  were the fruits of his \"self-denying ordinance to dramatize, like the  Greeks ... striking passages of history\" (letter to Murray, July 14,  1821, _Letters_, 1901, v. 323). The mood was destined to pass, but for a  while the neophyte was spell-bound.    _Sardanapalus, a Tragedy_, the second and, perhaps, the most successful  of these studies in the poetry of history, was begun at Ravenna, January  13, 1821, \"with all deliberate speed;\" but, for a time, from laziness or  depression of spirits, or, perhaps, from the counter-excitement of \"the  poetry of politics\" (_Letters_, 1901, v. 205), that is, the  revolutionary drama which had begun to run its course, a month went by  before he had finished the first act (February 15). Three months later  (May 28) he announces the completion of the drama, the last act having  been \"dashed off\" in two or three days (_Letters_, 1901, v. 300).    For the story of Sardanapalus, which had excited his interest as a  schoolboy, Byron consulted the pages of Diodorus Siculus (_Bibliothecae  Historicae_, lib. ii. pp. 78, sq., ed. 1604), and, possibly to ward off  and neutralize the distracting influence of Shakespeare and other  barbarian dramatists, he \"turned over\" the tragedies of Seneca  (_Letters_, 1901, v. 173). It is hardly necessary to remind the modern  reader that the Sardanapalus of history is an unverified if not an  unverifiable personage. Diodorus the Sicilian, who was contemporary with  Cicero, derived his knowledge of Assyrian history from the _Persica_ of  Ctesias of Cnidos, who was private physician at the court of Artaxerxes  Mnemon (B.C. 405-359), and is said to have had access to, and to have  consulted, the \"Persian authorities\" ([Greek: diphthe/rai Basilikai\\]).    The character which Ctesias depicted or invented, an effeminate  debauchee, sunk in luxury and sloth, who at the last was driven to take  up arms, and, after a prolonged but ineffectual resistance, avoided  capture by suicide, cannot be identified. Asurbanipal  (A[)s]ur-b[=a]ni-apli), the son of Esarhaddon and grandson of  Sennacherib, who ascended the throne B.C. 668, and reigned for about  forty years, was, as the cuneiform records and the friezes of his palace  testify, a bold hunter and a mighty warrior. He vanquished Tark[=u]  (Tirhakah) of Ethiopia, and his successor, Urdaman[=e]. Ba'al King of  Tyre, Yakinl[=u] King of the island-city of Arvad, Sand[)a]sarm[=u] of  Cilicia, Teumman of Elam, and other potentates, suffered defeat at his  hands. \"The land of Elam,\" writes the king or his \"Historiographer  Royal,\" \"through its extent I covered as when a mighty storm approaches;  I cut off the head of Teumman, their king... Beyond number I slew his  warriors; alive in my hands I took his fighting men; with their corpses,  as with thorns and thistles, I filled the vicinity of Susa; their blood  I caused to flow in the Eulaeus, and I stained its waters like wool.\"  Clearly the Sardanapalus who painted his face and carded purple wool in  the _penetralia_ of his seraglio does not bear even a traditional  resemblance to A[)s]ur-b[=a]ni-apli the Conqueror.    All that can be affirmed with any certainty is that within twenty years  of the death of Asurbanipal, the Assyrian Empire passed into the hands  of the Medes;[1] but there is nothing to show whether the period of  decay had already set in before the close of his reign, or under which  of his two successors, [)A]sur-etil-il[=a]ni or Sin-[)s]ar-i[)s]kun,  the final catastrophe (B.C. 606) took place (_Encyclopedia Biblica_,  art. \"Assyria,\" art. \"[)A]sur-bani-pal,\" by Leonard W. King).    \"I have made,\" writes Byron (May 25, 1821), \"Sardanapalus brave though  voluptuous (as history represents him), and as amiable as my poor pen  could make him.\" Diodorus, or rather Ctesias, who may have drawn upon  personal reminiscences of his patron, Artaxerxes Mnemon (see Plutarch's  _Artaxerxes_, _passim_), does not enlarge upon his amiability, and  credits him only with the courage of despair. Byron's Sardanapalus, with  his sudden transition from voluptuous abandonment to heroic chivalry,  his remorseful recognition of the sanctities of wedlock, his general  good nature, his \"sly, insinuating sarcasms\" (Moore's Diary, September  30, 1821, _Memoirs_, iii. 282), \"all made out of the carver's brain,\"  resembles _history_ as little as _history_ resembles the Assyrian  record. Fortunately, the genius of the poet escaped from the meshes  which he had woven round himself, and, in spite of himself, he was  constrained to \"beat his music out,\" regardless of his authorities.    The character of Myrrha, which bears some resemblance to Aspasia, \"a  native of Phocea in Ionia--the favourite mistress of Cyrus\" (see  Plutarch's _Artaxerxes_, Langhorne's Translation, 1838, p. 699), was  introduced partly to pacify the Countess Guiccioli, who had quarrelled  with him for maintaining that \"love was not the loftiest theme for true  tragedy,\" and, in part, to prove that he was not a slave to his own  ideals, and could imagine and delineate a woman who was both passionate  and high-minded. Diodorus (_Bibl. Hist._, lib. iii. p. 130) records the  exploits of Myrina, Queen of the Amazons, but it is probable that Byron  named his Ionian slave after Mirra, who gives her name to Alfieri's  tragedy, which brought on a convulsive fit of tears and shuddering when  he first saw it played at Bologna in August, 1819 (_Letters_, 1900, iv.  339).    _Sardanapalus, a Tragedy_, was published together with _The Two Foscari,  a Tragedy_, and _Cain, a Mystery_, December 19, 1821.    The three plays were reviewed by Heber in the _Quarterly Review_, July,  1822, vol. xxvii. pp. 476-524; by Jeffrey in the _Edinburgh Review_,  February, 1822, vol. 36, pp. 413-452; in _Blackwood's Edinburgh  Magazine_, February, 1822, vol. xi. pp. 212-217; and in the _Portfolio_  (Philadelphia), December, 1822, vol. xiv. pp. 487-492.
