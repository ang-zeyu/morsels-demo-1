It does  not become continuous till the year after his consulship (B.C. 62).  There are no letters in the year of the consulship itself or the year of  his canvass for the consulship (B.C. 64 and 63). It begins in B.C. 68,  and between that date and B.C. 65 there are only eleven letters. We  have, therefore, nothing exactly contemporaneous to help us to form a  judgment on the great event which coloured so much of his after life,  the suppression of the Catilinarian conspiracy and the execution of the  conspirators, in the last month of his consulship. But setting aside the  first eleven letters, we have from that time forward a correspondence  illustrating, as no other document in antiquity does, the hopes and  fears, the doubts and difficulties, of a keen politician living through  the most momentous period of Roman history, the period of the fall of  the Republic, beginning with Pompey's return from the East in B.C. 62,  and ending with the appearance of the young Octavian on the scene and  the formation of the Triumvirate in B.C. 43, of whose victims Cicero was  one of the first and most illustrious. It is by his conduct and speeches  during this period that Cicero's claim to be a statesman and a patriot  must be judged, and by his writings in the same period that his place in  literature must chiefly be assigned. Before B.C. 63 his biography, if we  had it, would be that of the advocate and the official, no doubt with  certain general views on political questions as they occurred, but not  yet committed definitely to a party, or inclined to regard politics as  the absorbing interest of his life. In his early youth his hero had  been his fellow townsman Marius, in whose honour he composed a poem  about the time of taking the _toga virilis_. But it was as the  successful general, and before the days of the civil war. And though he  served in the army of Sulla in the Marsic war (B.C. 90-88), he always  regarded his cruelties with horror, however much he may have afterwards  approved of certain points of his legislation. It was not till the  consulship that he became definitely a party man[1] and an Optimate, and  even then his feelings were much distracted by a strong  belief--strangely ill-founded--that Pompey would be as successful as a  statesman as he had been fortunate as a general. For him he had also a  warm personal attachment, which never seems to have wholly died out, in  spite of much petulance of language. This partly accounts for the  surrender of B.C. 56, and his acquiescence in the policy of the  triumvirs, an acquiescence never hearty indeed, as far as Caesar and  Crassus were concerned, but in which he consoled himself with the belief  that nothing very unconstitutional could be done while Pompey was  practically directing affairs at Rome.    [Sidenote: The various nature of the Correspondence.]    It is through this period of political change and excitement that the  correspondence will take us, with some important gaps indeed, but on the  whole fullest when it is most wanted to shew the feelings and motives  guiding the active politicians of the day, or at any rate the effect  which events had upon one eager and acute intellect and sensitive heart.  One charm of the correspondence is variety. There is almost every sort  of letter. Those to Atticus are unstudied, spontaneous, and reflect the  varying moods of the writer. At times of special excitement they follow  each other day by day, and sometimes more than once in the same day; and  the writer seems to conceal nothing, however much it might expose him to  ridicule, and to the charge of fickleness, weakness, or even cowardice.  Those addressed to other friends are sometimes familiar and playful,  sometimes angry and indignant. Some of them are careful and elaborate  state papers, others mere formal introductions and recommendations.  Business, literature, and philosophy all have their share in them; and,  what is so rare in ancient literature, the family relations of the  writer, his dealings with wife, son, and daughter, brother and nephew,  and sons-in-law, are all depicted for us, often with the utmost  frankness. After reading them we seem to know Cicero the man, as well as  Cicero the statesman and orator. The eleven letters which precede the  consulship are happily, from this point of view, addressed to Atticus.  For it was to Atticus that he wrote with the least concealment, and with  the confidence that any detail, however small, which concerned himself  would be interesting to his correspondent. It is well, therefore, that,  though we thus come into his life when it was more than half over, we  should at once hear his genuine sentiments on whatever subjects he may  be speaking. Besides his own, we have about ninety letters to Cicero  from some of the chief men of the day--Pompey, Caesar, Cato, Brutus,  Antony, and many others. They are of very various excellence. The best  of them are by much less known men. Neither Pompey nor Caesar were good  letter-writers, or, if the latter was so, he was too busy to use his  powers.    [Sidenote: Cicero's position previous to the beginning of the  Correspondence in B.C. 68.]    [Sidenote: Quaestor, B.C. 75.]    The letters begin, then, in B.C. 68, when Cicero was in his  thirty-seventh year. He was already a man of established reputation both  as a pleader and a writer. Rhetorical treatises (B.C. 86), translations  from Xenophon and Plato (B.C. 84), and from the poems of Aratus (B.C.  81), had given evidence of a varied literary interest and a promise of  future eminence, while his success as an advocate had led to the first  step in the official _cursus honorum_ by his becoming a quaestor in B.C.  75. The lot assigned Lilybaeum as his sphere of work, and though the  duties of a quaestor in Sicily were not such as to bring a man's name  much before the Roman public, Cicero plumes himself, as was not unusual  with him, on the integrity and energy which he displayed in his  administration. He has indeed the honesty to tell against himself the  story of the acquaintance who, meeting him at Puteoli on his return  journey, asked him what day he had left Rome and what was the news  there. When he answered rather crossly that he had just come from  Sicily, another acquaintance put in with \"Why, of course. Didn't you  know he has just been quaestor _at Syracuse_!\" At any rate he had done  sufficiently well in Lilybaeum to give him his next step, the aedileship  to which he was elected B.C. 70, and to induce the Sicilians to apply to  him, when in that year they desired the prosecution of the extortionate  Verres. His energy and success in this business raised him, without  question, to the first rank of advocates, and pledged him to a righteous  policy in regard to the government of the provinces.    [Sidenote: Cicero's Boyhood and Education.]    Still Cicero was a _novus homo_, and the jealous exclusiveness of the  great families at Rome might yet prevent his attainment of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21254"],[0,"In Africa: Hunting Adventures in the Big Game Country (#2)"],[1,"America.    In the middle of August Mr. Stephenson and I arrived in London. Mr.  Akeley had ordered most of our equipment by letter, but there still  remained many things to be done, and for a week or more we were busy  from morning till night.    It is amazing how much stuff is required to outfit a party of four  people for an African shooting expedition of several months' duration.  First in importance come the rifles, then the tents and camp equipment,  then the clothes and boots, then the medical supplies, and finally the  food. Perhaps the food might be put first in importance, but just now,  after a hearty dinner, it seems to be the least important detail.    Many men outfitting for an African campaign among wild animals secure  their outfits in London. It is there, in modest little shops, that one  gets the weapons that are known to sportsmen from one end of the world  to the other--weapons designed expressly for the requirements of African  shooting, and which have long stood the test of hard, practical service.  For two days we haunted these famous gun-makers' shops, and for two days  I made a magnificent attempt to look learnedly at things about which I  knew little.    [Drawing: _Practising in the Museum_]    At last, after many hours of gun shopping, attended by the constant  click of a taxicab meter, I assembled such an imposing arsenal that I  was nervous whenever I thought about it. With such a battery it was a  foregone conclusion that something, or somebody, was likely to get hurt.  I hoped that it would be something, and not somebody.    The old-time \"elephant gun\" which shot an enormous ball and a staggering  charge of black powder has given way to the modern double-barreled  rifle, with its steel bullet and cordite powder. It is not half so heavy  or clumsy as the old timers, but its power and penetration are  tremendous. The largest of this modern type is the .650 cordite--that  is, it shoots a bullet six hundred and fifty thousandths of an inch in  diameter, and has a frightful recoil. This weapon is prohibitive on  account of its recoil, and few, if any, sportsmen now care to carry one.  The most popular type is the .450 and .475 cordite double-barreled  ejector, hammerless rifles, and these are the ones that every elephant  hunter should have.    We started out with the definite purpose of getting three .450s--one for  Mr. Akeley, one for Mr. Stephenson, and one for myself; also three  nine-millimeter (.375) Mannlichers and two .256 Mannlichers. What we  really got were three .475 cordites, two nine-millimeter Mannlichers,  one eight-millimeter Mauser, and two .256 Mannlichers. We were switched  off the .450s because a government regulation forbids the use of that  caliber in Uganda, although it is permitted in British East Africa, and  so we played safe by getting the .475s. This rifle is a heavy gun that  carries a bullet large enough to jolt a fixed star and recoil enough to  put one's starboard shoulder in the hospital for a day or so.  Theoretically, the sportsman uses this weapon in close quarters, and  with a bullet placed according to expert advice sees the charging lion,  rhino or elephant turn a back somersault on his way to kingdom come. It  has a tremendous impact and will usually stop an animal even if the  bullet does not kill it. The bullets of a smaller rifle may kill the  animal, but not stop it at once. An elephant or lion, with a small  bullet in its heart, may still charge for fifty or one hundred yards  before it falls. Hence the necessity for a rifle that will shock as well  as penetrate.    [Drawing: _Advice from a Cheerful Stranger_]    Several experienced African lion hunters strongly advise taking a  \"paradox,\" which in their parlance is affectionately called a  \"cripple-stopper.\" It looks like what one would suppose an elephant gun  to look like. Its weight is staggering, and it shoots a solid ball,  backed up by a fearful charge of cordite. They use it under the  following conditions: Suppose that a big animal has been wounded and not  instantly killed. It at once assumes the aggressive, and is savage  beyond belief. The pain of the wound infuriates it and its one object in  life is to get at the man who shot it. It charges in a well-nigh  irresistible rush, and no ordinary bullet can stop it unless placed in  one or two small vital spots. Under the circumstances the hunter may not  be able to hold his rifle steady enough to hit these aforesaid spots.  That is when the paradox comes in. The hunter points it in a general way  in the direction of the oncoming beast, pulls the trigger and hopes for  the best. The paradox bullet hits with the force of a sledge hammer, and  stuns everything within a quarter of a mile, and the hunter turns  several back somersaults from the recoil and fades into bruised  unconsciousness.    We decided not to get the paradox, preferring to trust to hitting the  small vital spots rather than transport the weapon by hand through long  tropical marches.    The nine-millimeter rifles were said to be large enough for nearly all  purposes, but not reassuring in extremely close quarters. The .256  Mannlichers are splendid for long range shooting, as they carry a small  bore bullet and have enormous penetrating power.    The presumption, therefore, was that we should first shoot the lion at  long range with the .256, then at a shorter range with the  nine-millimeter, then at close range with the .475 cordite, and then  perhaps fervently wish that we had the paradox or a balloon.    After getting our arsenal, we then had to get the cartridges, all done  up in tin boxes of a weight not exceeding sixty pounds, that being the  limit of weight which the African porter is expected to carry. There  were several thousand rounds of ammunition, but this did not mean that  several thousand lions were to be killed. Allowing for a fair percentage  of misses, we calculated, if lucky, to get one or two lions.    After getting our rifles and ammunition under satisfactory headway, we  then saw that our seventy-two \"chop\" boxes of food were sure to be ready  in time to catch our steamer at Southampton.    And yet these preliminary details did not half conclude our shopping  preliminaries in London. There were camping rugs, blankets, cork  mattresses, pillows and pillow cases, bed bags, towels, lanterns,  mosquito boots, whetstones, hunting and skinning knives, khaki helmets,  pocket tapes to measure trophies, Pasteur anti-venomous serum,  hypodermic syringes, chairs, tables, cots, puttees, sweaters, raincoats,  Jaeger flannels, socks and pajamas, cholera belts, Burberry hunting  clothes, and lots of other little odds and ends that seemed to be  necessary.    The clothes were put up in air-proof tin uniform cases, small enough to  be easily carried by a porter and secure enough to keep out the millions  of ants that were expected to seek habitation in them.    [Drawing: _Part of the Equipment_]    Most of our equipment, especially the food supplies, had been ordered by  letter, and these we found to be practically ready. The remaining  necessities, guns, ammunition, camera supplies, medical supplies,  clothes, helmets, and so on, we assembled after two days of prodigious  hustling. There was nothing then to be done except to hope that all our  mountainous mass of equipment would be safely installed on the steamer  for Mombasa. This steamer, the _Adolph Woermann_, sailed from Hamburg on  the fourteenth of August, was due at Southampton on the eighteenth and  at Naples on the thirtieth. To avoid transporting the hundred cases of  supplies overland to Naples, it was necessary to get them to Southampton  on the eighteenth. It was a close shave, for only by sending them down  by passenger train on that morning were they able to reach Southampton.  Fortunately our hopes were fulfilled, and at last we received word that  they were on board and were careening down toward Naples, where we  expected to join them on the thirtieth.    [Drawing: Map]    [Drawing: Map]    [Drawing: _Studying the Lion's Vital Spots_]    After disposing of this important preliminary, we then had time to visit  the zoo at South Kensington and the British museum of natural history,  where we carefully studied many of the animals that we hoped to meet  later under less formal conditions. We picked out the vital spots, as  seen from all angles, and nothing then remained to be done but to get  down to British East Africa with our rifles and see whether we could hit  those vital spots.    Mr. Akeley had an elaborate moving picture machine and we planned to get  some excellent pictures of charging animals. The lion, rhino or other  subject was to be allowed to charge within a few feet of the camera and  then with a crack of our trusty rifles he was supposed to stop. We  seemed safe in assuming, even without exaggeration, that this would be  exciting.    It was at least that.    At last we said farewell to London, a one-sided ceremony, stopped at  Rheims to see the aviators, joined the Akeleys at Paris, and after  touching a few of the high spots in Europe, arrived in Naples in ample  time to catch our boat for Mombasa.          CHAPTER II    THE FIRST HALF OF THE VOYAGE. FROM NAPLES TO THE RED SEA, WITH A FEW  SIDE LIGHTS ON INDIAN OCEAN TRAVEL      Lion hunting had not been fraught with any great hardships or dangers up  to this time. The Mediterranean was as smooth as a mill-pond, the Suez  Canal was free from any tempestuous rolling, and the Red Sea was placid  and hot. After some days we were in the Indian Ocean, plowing lazily  along and counting the hours until we reached Mombasa. Perhaps after  that the life of a lion hunter would be less tranquil and calm.    The _Adolph Woermann_ was a six-thousand-three-hundred-ton ship, three  years old, and so heavily laden with guns and ammunition and steel rails  for the Tanga Railway that it would hardly roll in a hurricane.
