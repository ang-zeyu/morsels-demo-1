The remaining English residents were few in number, and kept, to all  appearance, \"strictly neutral,\" until the morning of June 5th, 1900,  when the British troops poured into the capital.    The two people chiefly concerned in this story, mother and daughter,  lived in Sunnyside, a south-eastern suburb of Pretoria, on a large and  beautiful old property, appropriately called Harmony, one of the  oldest estates in the capital.    This historical place consisted of a simple, comfortable farm-house,  with a rambling garden--a romantic spot, and an ideal setting for the  adventures and enterprises here recorded.    At the time our story opens, the owner, Mrs. van Warmelo, was living  alone on it with her daughter, Hansie, a girl of twenty-two, the  diarist referred to in the Introduction.    The other members of the family, though they took no part in those  events of the war which took place within the capital, were so closely  connected with the principal figures in this book that their  introduction will be necessary here.    The family consisted of five, two daughters and three sons. The elder  daughter was married and was living at Wynberg near Cape Town, the  younger, as we have seen, was with her mother in Pretoria during the  war, while of the sons, two, the eldest and the youngest, Dietlof and  Fritz, were on commando, having left the capital with the first  contingent of volunteers on September 28th.    The third brother, Willem, who had been studying in Holland when the  war broke out, had, with his mother's knowledge and permission, given  up his nearly completed studies and had come to South Africa, to take  part in the deadly struggle in which his fellow-countrymen were  engaged.    In order to achieve his purpose, he had taken the only route open to  him, the eastern route through Delagoa Bay, and had joined his  brothers in the field, after a brief sojourn with his mother and  sister at Harmony.    Considering the circumstances under which he had joined the Boer  forces and the sacrifice he had made for love of fatherland, it was  particularly sad that he should have been made a prisoner at the last  great fight at the Tugela, the battle of Pieter's Height in Natal, on  February 27th, after a very short experience of commando life.    He was lodged in the Maritzburg jail at this time, where things would  have gone hard with him, but for the loving-kindness of his cousin,  Miss Berning, now Lady Bale, who frequently visited him with her  sister, and provided him with baskets of fruit and other delicacies,  which helped greatly to brighten the long months of his imprisonment.    Later on, through the influence of his brother-in-law, Mr. Henry  Cloete, of \"Alphen,\" Wynberg, he was released on parole, and allowed  to return to Holland to complete his studies. His name therefore will  no more appear in these pages.    He was \"out of action\" once and for all, and could not be made use of,  even when, later on, through the development of the events with which  this book deals, his services were most required by his mother and  sister.    The other two brothers, as we have said, had left Pretoria with the  first volunteers.    It is strange that the first blood shed in that terrible war should  have been that of a young Boer accidentally shot by a comrade.    As a train, laden with its burden of brave and hopeful burghers,  steamed slowly through the cutting on the south-eastern side of  Pretoria, volleys of farewell shots were fired.    It is customary to extract the bullets from the cartridges on such  occasions, but one of the burghers must have omitted to do this, with  the result that the bullet, rebounding from the rocks, penetrated a  carriage window, and seriously wounded one of the occupants.    Was this event prophetic of a later development of the war, when, as  we shall see, Boer shed the blood of brother Boer in the formation of  the National Scouts Corps?    Mrs. van Warmelo was a \"voor-trekker,\" a pioneer, in every sense of  the word. As a girl of fourteen she had left Natal with her parents  and had \"trekked,\" with other families, through the wild waste of  country, into the unknown and barbaric regions in which she was  destined to spend her youth.    She had watched the growth of a new country, the building up of a new  race. She had known all the hardships and dangers of life in an  unsettled and uncivilised land, had been through a number of Kaffir  wars and could speak, through personal experience, of many adventures  with savage foes and wild beasts. Her children knew her stories by  heart, and it is not to be wondered at that they grew up with the love  of adventure strong in them. And above all things, they grew up with a  strong love for the strange, rich, wild country for which their  forefathers had fought and suffered.    Mrs. van Warmelo was the eldest daughter of a family of sixteen. Her  father, Dietlof Siegfried Mare, for many years Landdrost of  Zoutpansberg, that northern territory of the Transvaal, was a direct  descendant of the Huguenot fugitives, and was a typical Frenchman,  short of stature, dark, vivacious, and exceedingly humorous, a man  remembered by all who knew him for his great hospitality and for  the shrewd, quaint humour of his sayings.        [Illustration: MRS. VAN WARMELO.]    Some years after their arrival in Zoutpansberg, Mrs. van Warmelo had  married a Hollander, a young minister of the Dutch Reformed Church. Of  him it is not necessary to speak in this book.    He had taken his part in the first Anglo-Boer war and had passed away  in Heidelberg, Transvaal, leaving to the people of his adopted  fatherland and to his children a rich inheritance in the memory of a  life spent in doing noble deeds--a life of rare self-sacrifice.    His family had left Heidelberg a few years after his death, and had  taken up their abode in the capital in order to be near Mrs. van  Warmelo's married daughter, Mrs. Cloete, who then lived close to  Harmony, in Sunnyside.    It was a wild, romantic suburb in those days, being still almost  entirely in its natural state. Grass-covered hills, clumps of mimosa,  and other wild trees, with here and there an old homestead  picturesquely situated in isolated spots, were all there was to be  seen.    Of all the private properties in this suburb, Harmony was the most  overgrown and neglected when Mrs. van Warmelo first took possession of  it.    It was bounded at the lower, the western end, by the Aapies River, a  harmless rivulet in its normal state--almost dry, in fact, during the  winter season--but in flood a most dangerous and destructive element,  overflowing its banks and sweeping away every obstruction in its wild  course.    The property was overgrown with rank vegetation and reminded one of  the impenetrable forest abode of the \"Sleeping Beauty\" of fairy-tale  fame.    Friends wondered that Mrs. van Warmelo had the courage to live alone  with her daughter Hansie in such a wild and desolate spot, and they  wondered still more when they heard of the alarming experience the two  ladies had the very first night they spent in their new home.    On their arrival, there were still workmen busy repairing the house,  and Mrs. van Warmelo pointed out to one of them that the skylight  above the bathroom door had not yet been put in. The man nailed a  piece of canvas over it, with the remark that that would do for the  night, and that he would put in the skylight on his return the next  day. Mrs. van Warmelo was only half satisfied, but left the matter  there.    During the night one of her own servants, a sullen,  treacherous-looking native, recently in her employment, entered the  bathroom by putting a ladder against the door and tearing away the  canvas from the skylight.    He must then have unlocked the door on the inside, striking about a  dozen matches while he was in the room, and carried various  portmanteaux out into the garden, where he slashed them open at the  sides and overhauled their contents for money and valuables.    Early the next morning Mrs. van Warmelo was roused by old Anne  Merriman, the only woman servant on the place, who came in from the  garden with articles of wearing apparel which she had picked up under  the trees, and which she held up to the astonished gaze of her  mistress. On investigating further, they found the garden littered  with articles of clothing, valuable documents, and title-deeds, which  the thief had thrown aside as worthless, in his search for money.    The only things of value which he had taken with him were a set of  pearl ear-rings and brooch, and a beautiful lined \"kar"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20195"],[0,"Wood-Block Printing (#2)"],[1,"those  fellow-craftsmen who have been privileged to work for the Series is  itself an honour of high estimation in the mind of the present writer.

WOOD-BLOCK PRINTING    BY THE    JAPANESE METHOD          CHAPTER I      _INTRODUCTORY_         Introduction and Description of the Origins of Wood-block Printing;       its uses for personal artistic expression, for reproduction of       decorative designs, and as a fundamental training for students of       printed decoration.    The few wood-block prints shown from time to time by the Society of  Graver Printers in Colour, and the occasional appearance of a wood-block  print in the Graver Section of the International Society's Exhibitions,  or in those of the Society of Arts and Crafts, are the outcome of the  experiments of a small group of English artists in making prints by the  Japanese method, or by methods based on the Japanese practice.    My interest was first drawn in 1897 to experiments that were being made  by Mr. J. D. Batten, who for two years previously had attempted, and  partially succeeded in making, a print from wood and metal blocks with  colour mixed with glycerine and dextrine, the glycerine being afterwards  removed by washing the prints in alcohol. As the Japanese method seemed  to promise greater advantages and simplicity, we began experiments  together, using as our text-book the pamphlet by T. Tokuno, published by  the Smithsonian Institution, Washington, and the dextrine and glycerine  method was soon abandoned. The edition of prints, however, of Eve and  the Serpent designed by J. D. Batten, printed by myself and published at  that time, was produced partly by the earlier method and partly in the  simpler Japanese way.    Familiar as everyone is with Japanese prints, it is not generally known  that they are produced by means of an extremely simple craft. No  machinery is required, but only a few tools for cutting the designs on  the surface of the planks of cherry wood from which the impressions are  taken. No press is used, but a round flat pad, which is rubbed on the  back of the print as it lies on the blocks. The colours are mixed with  water and paste made from rice flour. The details of the craft and  photographs of the tools were given in full in the Smithsonian  Institution pamphlet already mentioned.    It is slow and unsatisfactory work, however, learning manipulation from  a book, and several technical difficulties that seemed insurmountable  were made clear by the chance discovery in London of a Japanese  printseller who, although not a printer, was sufficiently familiar with  the work to give some invaluable hints and demonstrations.    Further encouragement was given to the work by the institution, a little  later, of a class in wood-cuts in colour under my charge, at the L.C.C.  Central School of Arts and Crafts, which for several years became the  chief centre of the movement.    Such are the bare historical facts of the"]]]
