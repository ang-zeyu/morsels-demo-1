[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23680"],[0,"Sex: Avoided subjects Discussed in Plain English (#2)"],[1," the functional workings of reproduction are  not, primarily, a source of pleasure, but that--when safeguarded by  the institution of matrimony, on which civilized social life is  based--they stand for the observance of solemn duties and obligations,  duties to church and state, and obligations to posterity. Hence,  parents, in talking to their children about these matters should do so  in a sober and instructive fashion. The attention of a mother,  perhaps, need not be called to this. But fathers may be inclined, in  many cases, to inform their sons without insisting that the  information they give them is, in the final analysis, intended to be  applied to lofty constructive purposes. They may, in their desire to  speak _practically_, forget the moral values which should underlie  this intimate information. Never should the spirit of levity intrude  itself in these intimate personal sex colloquies. Restraint and  decency should always mark them.    In making clear to the mind of youth the fact data which initiates and  governs reproduction in animal and in human life, the ideal to be  cultivated is continence, the refraining from all experimentation  undertaken in a spirit of curiosity, until such time as a well-placed  affection, sanctioned by the divine blessing, will justify a sane and  normal exploitation of physical needs and urges in the matrimonial  state. To this end hard bodily and mental work should be encouraged in  the youth of both sexes. \"Satan finds work for idle hands to do,\" has  special application in this connection, and a chaste and continent  youth is usually the forerunner of a happy and contented marriage. And  incidentally, a happy marriage is the best guarantee that  reproduction, the carrying on of the species, will be morally and  physically a success. Here, too, the fact should be strongly stressed  that prostitution cannot be justified on any moral grounds. It  represents a deliberate ignoring of the rightful function of sex, and  the perversion of the sane and natural laws of reproduction. It is in  marriage, in the sane and normal activities of that unit of our whole  social system--the family--that reproduction develops nature's basic  principle of perpetuation in the highest and worthiest manner, in  obedience to laws humane and divine.                                        CHAPTER II                    THE TRANSITION FROM CELL TO HUMAN BEING      In the functional processes alluded to in the preceding chapter, the  male germ-cell and the female germ-cell unite in a practically equal  division of substance. We say \"practically\" because the maternal and  the paternal influences are not equally divided in the offspring. One  or the other usually predominates. But, as a general rule, it may be  said that in the development of the embryonal life the process of cell  division proceeds in such a way that every germ of the child's future  organism represents approximately one-half maternal and one-half  paternal substance and energy.    In this process lies the true secret of heredity. The inherited  energies retain their full measure of power, and all their original  quality in the growing and dividing chromosomes (the chromosome is one  of the segments into which the chromoplasmic filaments of a  cell-nucleus break up just before indirect division). On the other  hand, the egg-substance of the female germ-cell, which is assimilated  by the chromosomes, and which is turned into _their_ substance by the  process of organic chemistry, loses its specific plastic vital energy  completely. It is in the same way that food eaten by the adult has  absolutely no effect on his qualitative organic structure. We may eat  ever so many beef-steaks without acquiring any of the characteristics  of an ox. And the germ-cell may devour any amount of egg-protoplasma  without losing its original paternal energy. As a rule a child  inherits as many qualities from its mother as from its father.                               DETERMINATION OF SEX    Sex is determined after conception has taken place. At an early stage  of the embryo certain cells are set apart. These, later, form the sex  glands. Modern research claims to have discovered the secret of  absolutely determining sex in the human embryo, but even if these  claims are valid they have not as yet met with any general  application.                                 EARLY DEVELOPMENT    Some twelve days after conception, the female ovule or egg, which has  been impregnated by the male spermatazooen, escapes from the ovary  where it was impregnated, and entering a tube (Fallopian) gradually  descends by means of it into the cavity of the womb or uterus. Here  the little germ begins to mature in order to develop into an exact  counterpart of its parents. In the human being the womb has only a  single cavity, and usually develops but a single embryo.                                       TWINS    Sometimes two ovules are matured at the same time. If fecundated, two  embryos instead of one will develop, producing twins. Triplets and  quadruplets, the results of the maturing of three or four ovules at  the same time, occur more rarely. As many as five children have been  born alive at a single birth, but have seldom lived for more than a  few minutes.                                     GESTATION    The development of the ovule in the womb is known as gestation or  pregnancy. The process is one of continued cell division and growth,  and while it goes on the ovule sticks to the inner wall of the womb.  There it is soon enveloped by a mucous membrane, which grows around it  and incloses it.                                    THE EMBRYO    The _Primitive Trace_, a delicate straight line appearing on the  surface of the growing layer of cells is the base of the embryonic  spinal column. Around this the whole embryo develops in an intricate  process of cell division and duplication. One end of the Primitive  Trace becomes the head, the other the tail, for every human being has  a tail at this stage of his existence. The neck is marked by a slight  depression; the body by a swollen center. Soon little buds or \"pads\"  appear in the proper positions. These represent arms and legs, whose  ends, finally, split up into fingers and toes. The embryonic human  being has been steadily increasing in size, meanwhile. By the fifth  week the heart and lungs are present in a rudimentary form, and ears  and face are distinctly outlined. During the seventh week the kidneys  are formed, and a little later the genital organs. At two months,  though sex is not determined as yet, eyes and nose are visible, the  mouth is gaping, and the skin can be distinguished. At ten weeks the  sexual organs form more definitely, and in the third month sex can be  definitely determined.                                    THE FOETUS    At the end of its fourth month the embryo--now four or five inches  long and weighing about an ounce--is promoted. It receives the name of  foetus. Hairs appear on the scalp, the eyes are provided with lids,  the tongue appears far back in the mouth. The movements of the foetus  are plainly felt by the mother. If born at this time it lives but a  few minutes. It continues to gain rapidly in weight. By the sixth  month the nails are solid, the liver large and red, and there is fluid  in the gall bladder. The seventh month finds the foetus from twelve  and a half to fourteen inches long, and weighing about fifty-five  ounces. It is now well proportioned, the bones of the cranium,  formerly flat, are arched. All its parts are well defined, and it can  live if born. By the end of the eighth month the foetus has thickened  out. Its skin is red and covered by a delicate down; the lower jaw has  grown to the same length as the upper one. The convolutions of the  brain structure also appear during this month.                            PLACENTA AND UMBILICAL CORD    During gestation the unborn infant has been supplied with air and  nourishment by the mother. An organ called the _Placenta_, a spongy  growth of blood vessels, develops on the inner point of the womb. To  this organ the growing foetus is moored by a species of cable, the  _Umbilical Cord_. This cord, also made up mainly of blood vessels,  carries the blood of the foetus to and from the _Placenta_, absorbing  it through the thin walls which separate it from the mother's blood.  Only through her blood can the mother influence the child, since the  Umbilical Cord contains no nerves. The Umbilical Cord, attached to the  body of the child at the navel, is cut at birth, and with the Placenta  is expelled from the womb soon after the child has been born. Together  with the Placenta it forms a shapeless mass, familiarly known as the  \"afterbirth,\" and when it is retained instead of being expelled is apt  to cause serious trouble.                             CHILDBIRTH OR PARTURITION    At nine month's time the foetus is violently thrust from that  laboratory of nature in which it has formed. It is born, and comes  into the world as a child. Considering the ordinary size of the  generative passages, the expelling of the foetus from the womb would  seem impossible. But Nature, during those months in which she enlarged  the womb to hold its gradually increasing contents, has also increased  the generative passages in size. She has made them soft and  distensible, so that an apparent physical impossibility could take  place, though it is often accompanied by intense suffering. Modern  medical science has made childbirth easier, but the act of childbirth  is usually accompanied by more or less suffering. Excessive pain,  however, is often the result of causes which proper treatment can  remove before and at the time of confinement.
