[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23644"],[0,"Marjorie Dean, High School Freshman (#2)"],[1,", this way,\" Clark puckered his lips and emitted a soft  whistle, \"ring the bell.\"    \"Right-o,\" softly retorted three or four boyish voices.    Clark rapidly divided his little squad of thirty into fives, and moved  toward the house with the first division. Two minutes later the next  five conspirators began to move, and in an incredibly short space of  time the surprise party was overflowing the Dean veranda and front  steps. The boy who had been appointed bell ringer pressed his finger  firmly against the electric bell. There came the sound of a quick  footstep, then Marjorie herself opened the door, to be greeted with a  merry shout of \"Surprise! Surprise!\"    \"Why--what--who!\" she gasped.    \"Just exactly,\" agreed Clark Grayson. \"'Why--what--who'--and enough  others to make thirty. Of course, if you don't want us----\"    \"Stop teasing me, Clark, until I get over my surprise, at least,\" begged  Marjorie. \"No, I never suspected a single thing,\" she said, in answer to  Ethel Duval's question. \"Here are mother and father. They know more  about all this than they'll say. They made me believe they were going to  a party.\"    \"And so we are,\" declared her father, as he and Mrs. Dean came forward  to welcome their young guests, with the cordiality and graciousness for  which they were noted among Marjorie's friends.    \"Come this way, girls,\" invited Marjorie's mother, who, in an evening  frock of white silk, looked almost as young as the bevy of pretty girls  that followed her. \"Mr. Dean will look after you, boys.\"    Once she had helped her mother usher the girls into the upstairs  sleeping room set aside for their use, Marjorie lost no time in slipping  over to the dressing table where Mary stood, patting her fluffy hair and  lamenting because it would not stay smooth.    \"You dear thing,\" whispered Marjorie, slipping her arm about her chum.  \"I'll forgive you for not telling me where you were going. I was  terribly hurt for a minute, though. You know we've never had secrets  from each other.\"    \"And we never will,\" declared Mary, firmly. \"Promise me, Marjorie, that  you'll always tell me things; that is, when they're not someone else's  secrets.\"    \"I will,\" promised Marjorie, solemnly. \"We'll write our secrets to each  other instead of telling them. Now I must leave you for a minute and see  if everyone is having a good time. We'll have another comfy old talk  later.\"    To Mary Raymond fell the altogether agreeable task of keeping Marjorie  away from the dining-room, where Mrs. Dean, Ethel Duval and two of her  classmates busied themselves with the decorating of the two long tables.  By ten o'clock all was ready for the guests. In the middle of each  table, rising from a centerpiece of ferns, was a green silk pennant,  bearing the figures 19-- embroidered in scarlet. The staffs of the two  pennants were wound with green and scarlet ribazine which extended in  long streamers to each place, and was tied to dainty hand-painted  pennant-shaped cards, on which appeared the names of the guests. Laid  beside the place cards were funny little favors, which had been  gleefully chosen with a sly view toward exploiting every one's pet  hobby, while at either end of each table were tall vases of red roses,  which seemed to nod their fragrant approval of the merry-making.    \"It's quite perfect, isn't it?\" sighed Ethel, with deep satisfaction,  gently touching one of the red roses. \"The very nicest part of it all is  that you've been just as enthusiastic as we over the party.\" She turned  affectionate eyes upon Mrs. Dean.    \"It could hardly be otherwise, my dear,\" returned Mrs. Dean. \"Remember,  it is for my little girl that you have planned all this happiness.  Nothing can please me more than the thought that Marjorie has so many  friends. I only hope she will be equally fortunate in her new home,  though, I am sure, she will never forget her Franklin High School  chums.\"    \"We won't give her that chance,\" nodded Ethel, emphatically. \"There, I  think we are ready. Clark wants to be your partner, Mrs. Dean, and  Seldon is to escort Marjorie to her place. We aren't going to give her  the pin until we are ready to drink the toasts. Robert Barrett is to be  toastmaster. Will you go first and announce supper?\"    There was a buzz of delight and admiration from the guests, as headed by  Marjorie and Seldon, the little procession marched into the dining-room.  For a moment the very sight of the gayly decked table with its weight of  goodies and wonderful red roses caused Marjorie's brown eyes to blur.  Then, as Seldon bowed her to the head of one of the tables, she winked  back her tears, and nodding gayly to the eager faces turned toward her  and said with her prettiest smile: \"It's the very nicest surprise that  ever happened to me, and I hope you will all have a perfectly splendid  time to-night.\"    \"Three cheers for Marjorie Dean! May we give them, Mrs. Dean?\" called  Robert Barrett.    Mrs. Dean's smiling assent was lost in the volume of sound that went up  from thirty lusty young throats.    \"Now, Franklin High,\" proposed Mary Hammond, and the Franklin yell was  given by the girls. The boys, who were nearly all students at the La  Fayette High School, just around the corner from Franklin, responded  with their yell, and the merry little company began hunting their places  and seating themselves at the tables.    Marjorie was far too much excited to eat. Her glances strayed  continually down the long tables to the cheery faces of her schoolmates.  It seemed almost too wonderful that her friends should care so much  about her.    \"Marjorie Dean, stop dreaming and eat your supper,\" commanded Mary, who  had been covertly watching her friend. \"Clark, you are sitting next to  her. Make her eat her chicken salad. It's perfectly delicious.\"    \"Will you eat your salad or must I exercise my stern authority?\" began  Clark, drawing down his face until he exactly resembled a certain  roundly disliked teacher of mathematics in the boys' high school. There  was a laugh of recognition from the boys sitting nearest to Clark. He  continued to eye Marjorie severely.    \"Of course, I'm going to eat my salad,\" declared Marjorie, stoutly. \"You  must give me time, though. I'm still too surprised to be hungry.\"    But the greatest surprise was still in store for her. When everyone had  finished eating, Robert Barrett began his duties as toastmaster. Ethel  Duval came first with \"What Friendships Mean to a Schoolgirl,\" and  Seldon Ames followed with a ridiculously funny little toast to \"The High  School Fellows.\" Then Mr. and Mrs. Dean were toasted, and Lillian Hale,  a next-door neighbor and the only upper-class girl invited, gave solemn  counsel and advice to the \"freshman babies.\"    As Marjorie's dearest friend, to Mary had been accorded the honor of  giving the farewell toast, \"Aufwiedersehen,\" and the presentation of the  pin. Mary's clear voice trembled slightly as she began the little speech  which she had composed and learned for the occasion. Then her faltering  tones gathered strength, and before she realized that she was actually  making a speech, she had reached the most important part of it and was  saying, \"We wish you to keep and wear this remembrance of our good will  throughout your school life in Sanford. We hope you will make new  friends, and we ask only that you won't forget the old.\"    \"I can't begin to tell you how much I thank you all,\" Marjorie  responded, her tones not quite steady, her face lighted with a fond  pride that lay very near to tears. \"I shall love my butterfly all my  life, and never forget that you gave it to me. I am going to call it my  talisman, and I am sure it will bring me good luck.\"    But neither the givers nor Marjorie Dean could possibly guess that, in  the days to come, the beautiful golden butterfly was to prove anything  but a talisman to the popular little freshman.          CHAPTER III    THE GIRL WHO LOOKED LIKE MARY      \"It's rather nice to have so much room, but I know I shall never feel  quite at home here,\" murmured Marjorie Dean, under her breath, as she  came slowly down the steps of her new home and paused for a moment in  the middle of the stone walk which led to the street. Her wistful glance  strayed over the stretch of lawn, still green, then turned to rest on  the house, a comfortable three-story structure of wood, painted dark  green, with lighter green trimmings. Her mother's sudden appearance at  the window caused Marjorie to retrace her steps. Luncheon was ready.    \"Everything is so different,\" she sighed, as she climbed the steps she  had so lately descended. \"I've been here a week, and I haven't met a  single girl. I don't believe there are any girls in this neighborhood. I  should feel a good deal worse, too, if the Franklin girls hadn't been  such dears!\" Marjorie's last comment, spoken half aloud, referred to the  numerous letters she had received since her arrival in the town of  Sanford from her Franklin High School friends, now so many miles away.  Mary Raymond had not only fulfilled her promise to write one long letter  every week, but had mailed Marjorie, almost daily, hurriedly-written  little notes full of the news of what went on among the boys and girls  she had left behind.    It had been a busy, yet a very long week for Marjorie. The unpacking of  the Deans' furniture, which had been shipped to Sanford a week before  their arrival there, and the setting to rights of her new home had so  occupied the attention of Mrs. Dean and Nora, her faithful  maid-of-all-work, that Marjorie, aside from certain tasks allotted to  her to perform, was left for the most part to her own devices. As they  had arrived in Sanford on Monday, Marjorie's mother had decided to give  her daughter an opportunity to accustom herself to her new home and  surroundings before allowing her to enter the high school. So the day  for Marjorie's initial appearance in \"The Sanford"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23650"],[0,"Ten Boys from History (#2)"],[1,"divine letter clasped in his hand, Stephen ran homeward  through the little village where he lived, past its dilapidated church,  its quaint shops and rows of houses, over the old stone bridge by which  the main street crosses the little river Loir, running in a southerly  direction to join the beautiful Loire. The bridge is a pleasant place  to linger on a summer day, and recalls many a historic memory of Joan  of Arc, who once passed that way, on her way to Orleans--of Philip  Augustus--of Richard Coeur-de-Lion--but on naught save his divine  mission was the lad Stephen intent as he crossed the bridge on that  April day.    Having reached home, he hastily called his parents from their labour,  and gathering together such neighbours as could be summoned, he told of  his talk with the Saviour, who had come to call him, Stephen, the  shepherd boy, from tending his flocks, to rescue the Holy City and tomb  from wicked hands, and in proof of the truth of his story he showed the  letter from Jesus Christ to the King of France asking the king's aid  for Stephen in his holy mission.    As I have said, this was an age of dense ignorance and superstition  among the peasant classes. Those who had heard Stephen's tale were dumb  with awe and wonder and doubted not its truth. Only his father spoke  against the plan, mentioning his son's youth--commanding him to go back  to his flocks. But to these commands Stephen turned a deaf ear, for was  not he the Lord's anointed? Who could dictate to him, now that the  Divine voice had spoken in accents clear and strong?    On the next day and the next, even until darkness fell over the little  town, Stephen narrated his story in the market-place to ever-increasing  audiences, telling that now when the defenders of the Holy Sepulchre  were so few, and older and stronger Crusaders had failed to carry out  their divine purpose by reason of the ravages of war and disease, God  had revealed his plan to give the possession of Palestine to those  children who should enlist in his holy cause.    \"For the last time have we heard of defeat,\" cried Stephen. \"Hereafter  shall children show mailed warriors and proud barons how invulnerable  are youths when God leads them!\"    This cry stirred the youths of Cloyes profoundly, and they all rushed  to enlist under the banner of Stephen and the Holy Cross, but the  number was not large enough to satisfy Stephen's ambition. He was  determined now to rouse all France and in consequence of that desire,  he decided to leave his home and go to a town five miles north of  Paris--St. Denys, the great shrine of the land, where lie the bones of  the martyr Dionysius, the object of countless pilgrimages, where to  ever-changing crowds, he could preach his Crusade, and gain recruits  for his army.    And so to St. Denys, Stephen of Cloyes went, in May of 1212. Dressed in  his shepherd's clothes, for he had no others, with his crook in his  hand and a little wallet by his side, he left quiet Cloyes for ever.  With a heart throbbing with hope and excitement, he journeyed on,  feeling neither fatigue nor fear, and as he went he preached his  mission in towns and cities by the way, and ever the interest deepened  in this lad who spoke with such burning eloquence, proclaiming himself  God's chosen instrument to rescue the Holy Sepulchre, and everywhere he  gained recruits. But even in Paris and Chartres, he did not linger  long, being eager to reach St. Denys. At last he arrived there, and  standing at the door of the historic church which contained the  martyr's tomb, proclaimed his new Crusade to astonished crowds whom he  fascinated by his unusual eloquence as he told the old story of the  sufferings of the Christians in the Holy Land, telling it so simply and  so vividly that his audiences were profoundly stirred, especially by  Stephen's last and best appeal. He pointed to the Sepulchre of St.  Denys, to which worshippers were thronging, and contrasted its  condition with that of the Sepulchre of the Saviour, asking if his  hearers would not help him make the Saviour's tomb as honoured and as  free from disturbing influences as was that of the saint. He then read  his letter to the king and asked if God's commands were to be  disregarded, telling of his interview with Christ, and adding that  after his day in Chartres, he had gone in search of his flocks and  found them missing, but had later discovered them in a field of grain,  from which he was about to drive them angrily, when they fell on their  knees and begged his forgiveness. This, he said, with other signs, had  led him to believe that he was truly God's anointed, even before he had  been visited by Christ.    It may well be asked here how a lad scarcely over twelve years of age  and born of the peasant class, could have suddenly become so  eloquent--so capable of appealing to audiences, and the answer is not  easy to give unless one thoroughly understands the spirit of that age  in which Stephen lived--an age in which there was much high-coloured  and stirring language used by the priests, language which appealed so  strongly to an impressionable lad like Stephen, that he unconsciously  took it for his own and made use of it; being often carried on the tide  of his emotion, far beyond his own understanding of the words and  thoughts he was uttering.    Immediately, he became the Saint of the day, and the martyr's bones  were deserted by those who preferred to listen to the lad's stirring  appeals. It is even reported that he worked miracles to support his own  divine claim, and the enthusiasm to join his army grew daily more  intense. As pilgrims went back to their homes they carried news of  Stephen's Crusade to their children, who, filled with excitement, in  turn passed the news on to their friends. And so the interest spread  like a contagion throughout all parts of France, through Brittany,  where the English ruled, through Normandy, recently added to Philip's  domain, to Aquitaine and Provence, to Toulouse and peaceful Gascony.  Whatever feuds their parents were engaged in, the children did not  care, and were not interested in the wars for power. So while their  elders were prevented from unity of action by the strife and political  divisions of the land, the young were one in feeling and in desire, and  joined gleefully in Stephen's stirring cry:    \"Long enough have you knights and warriors, so boastful and so  honoured, been making your fruitless attempts to rescue the tomb of  Christ! God can wait no longer! He is tired of your vain puny efforts.  Stand back and let us, whom you despise, carry out his commission! He  who calls can insure the victory, and we will show you what the  children can do!\"    Among the children who listened to Stephen's appeals, the more  enterprising returned home determined to play a part in the Crusade  only second to that of the Prophet, as Stephen was now called.  Everywhere in France, they went through their home districts, begging  their companions to join the Crusade, and it is probable that these  children had much help from priests who sought in every way to inflame  the youthful host, and to lead them on to concerted action.    As the army grew larger, the children formed into bands, and marched  through towns and villages with all the pomp and display possible,  despite much opposition from their parents, who saw with alarm that the  excitement was growing daily more intense. The bands of recruits  carried lighted candles, waving perfumed censers, and at the head of  every band there marched a proud youth carrying the Oriflamme--a copy  of the flag of the church, which was kept at St. Denys. The design of  this banner was a red triple-tongued flame, symbolic of the tongues of  fire that came down at Pentecost. This banner, like the colours of a  regiment, was a symbol of honour, and an object of the young Crusader's  devotion.    As the bands marched, they either sang hymns, such as had kept up the  courage of previous Crusaders, or others composed on the spur of the  moment by their revered children's minds, and in all of the hymns came  the refrain--\"Lord, restore Christendom! Lord, restore to us the true  and holy Cross!\"    And too they adopted the watchword which for two centuries had rung  through Asia. Crying, \"God wills it!\" children of all classes and  conditions and ages, cast aside authority, and joined the army, and  soon the movement became like the surge of a great wave, carrying the  youth of France out on its dangerous tide--girls as well as boys--weak  as well as strong--joining the forces.    Of course, the matter attracted the attention of the king, Philip  Augustus, who at first, for political reasons, was inclined to favour  the young Crusaders, but then seeing how serious the matter really was,  and that if it were not suppressed it would bear away the youth of the  land, to almost certain disaster, finally issued an edict or command  that the children return to their homes.    Kings are too wise to pay any attention even to messages written by a  divine hand, and there is no evidence to show that Philip was in any  way influenced by the letter given to Stephen by his celestial visitor,  and Philip's edict went forth, that there be an end to the uprising of  the children.    But in vain was the edict, which the King did not attempt to enforce,  in vain were all the commands and threats and pleas of parents and  guardians. Stephen's Crusade had become an epidemic. If a lad were  locked up that he might not join its ranks, he straightway sickened;  some even died of pining; where commands were the only bar to freedom,  the youths utterly disregarded them and ran away. So, after a few weeks  of Stephen's inflamed preaching there was rebellion in many a before  happy household in France, agony in many a mother's heart, who saw her  children leaving her, never, as her mother instinct told her, to  return.
