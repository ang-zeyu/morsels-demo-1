Always at that time were the open gardens  lively, the roses blooming with the crude, dense hues that the  Teutons like, and all the folk pursuing their busy tasks and  vigorous pleasures with a sort of goose-step alacrity.    But the closer, more sensitive onlooker felt something more in  1913--something widely organized, unified, puissant, imperial  indeed, such as, he may have imagined, had not existed since the  days of the great emperors in Rome. What the Germans told all comers  was that they had the best of governments, and that no nation had  been so thoroughly, soundly and extensively prosperous.    For each citizen read in his daily paper of successful and growing  Teuton activities in the most distant parts of the earth--in ports,  regions and among peoples whose names he had never heard before and  could not pronounce. At breakfast his capacious paunch and his  wife's fat, flowing bosom expanded with pride in hearing of some new  far-off passenger route carrying the flag, of the Made in Germany  brand sweeping the markets of the world, and perhaps of the Kaiser's  safe return to his palace, bronzed with the cast of health and  strength. Never had investments brought the German such high  rates. Never had speculation been so rife and withal so uniformly  profitable.    As for industry, Deutschland was a colossal beehive. If Frederick  the Great started the beehive, William the Second was increasing its  size to unbelievable proportions. Insignificant villages everywhere  contained millions of dollars' worth of machinery, manufacturing  goods of untold value. Not an ounce of energy, not a second of time,  seemed to be lost in the Empire. Every German was a busy cog fitted  precisely into the whole national plant.    It was as if the Teuton knew that other races must soon stand with  their backs to the wall and that now was the moment to redouble  effort to capture still more trade and reduce the rest of the world  to an acknowledged state of submission.          CHAPTER II    DEUTSCHLAND UEBER ALLES      Thus the Germans, in 1913, felt how supreme their country was or was  speedily becoming. Not only their newspapers but their educators,  their pastors and, more than all, their military and political  leaders told them that a place above the rest of mankind had been  reached. The pride, the assurance, pervading the land was the stiff  and hardy efflorescence of this universal conclusion. And the  Teutons had earned and therefore merited it all, for no one,  nothing, scarcely even Nature, had lent a helping hand.    German women knew they were the best housekeepers, wives, mothers,  dressers, dancers. Never had they been so to the fore. Never had  they had so much money to spend for clothes. Never had they  promenaded so proudly to martial music or waltzed so perspiringly  with the fashion-plate officers whom they adored.    The children were paragons of diligence and promise. In their school  books and college text books everything German was lauded in the  superlative; everything foreign was decried as inferior,  undesirable. Nearly every human discovery, invention, improvement,  was somehow traced to a Teuton origin. Even characteristic German  vices were held to be better than many virtues in other lands.    The young person grew up to believe that the Rhine was the finest of  rivers, the mountains of the Fatherland were the most celebrated in  song and story, its lakes the most picturesque, its soil the best  tilled. He was properly stuffed with the indomitable conviction, the  aggressive obsession, that the fittest civilization _must_ prevail.    And the army! Always the army--that bulwark, that invincible force!  Hundreds of thousands of civilians apparently regretted they were  not back in the barracks, following the noblest of occupations as  soldiers for the supreme War Lord. The army represented admitted  perfection. Foreign observers were united in naively attesting its  impeccableness. It was ready to the last shoe button, to the last  twist of its waxed mustache. But ready for what? Few outside of  Germany appeared to think of asking. The army was taken to be simply  Teuton life and of no more ulterior significance than the national  beer.    The admission was also general at home and abroad that the German  Government was the most free from graft and the most thorough. In  Germany the kings and princes were paid homage as models of wisdom  and virtue, and the Kaiser was believed to be walking with God, hand  in hand, palm to palm. In token of the mystic union between Emperor  and people, Hohenzollern monuments were seen rising in all parts of  the Empire in greater quantity, amid greater thanksgivings. These  _Denkmals_ were growing huger, more thunderous in appearance, and  served the double purpose of keeping the populace in a state of  admiring, unquestioning awe and expressing fulminating Bewares! to  other races. In every home, factory, retail shop, public place, was  the Kaiser's picture, with his trellised mustache, and his devout  eyes cast with a chummy comradeship up to heaven.    All the foregoing explanations accounted in part for a glorious  increase in noise among a people that does everything loudly. The  national noisiness was harmonized somewhat by innumerable bands and  orchestras. Public balls seemed to have become the order of the  night, and the famous forests by day were filled by echoes of the  horns of the bloody chase--the _cors de chasse_ of the legendary  Roland and knights of the Nibelungen. Humble civilians grew fonder  of the habit of donning their military or hunting uniforms and big  marching boots, and sticking cock's feathers in their hats at rakish  angles, recalling the war of 1870 or reviving dreams of the sporting  Tyrol. They drank daily more pints of beer and swallowed the  hot-headed Rhine wines as if thus renewing their blood in that of  their fiery ancestors. Meals mounted to seven or eight a day, for it  was proper to gorge themselves like the human gods they were. Even  the most servile took on a conscious air of being of a regal  species.    In this wise, the German, like Cain, the competent iron-worker, was  treading the earth with resounding footsteps. Over his bullneck and  under his spiked hat he had naturally come to look upon himself as a  super-being. While the American watched ball games, the Englishman  played golf and the Frenchman wrote to his loved one, the Teuton was  keeping himself hardened for war, and toiling like the systematic  beaver in up-building national industries that were so swiftly  dominating all others. To say the least, this intense people were  strenuously perfecting an intensive and powerful civilization such  as never had been seen.    So--as Gard Kirtley was finding and yet failing to explain to  himself--expectancy, undescribable and splendid, was in the air  beyond the Rhine. And there was one special toast drunk to it all  with ever more loudly clinking glasses--Der Tag! Such was triumphant  Germany, the triumphant Vaterland, in 1913--foretasting a portentous  future; pregnant with colossal success; swollen with a hundred years  of victories and growth; as sure of its prowess and might as were  the swaggering gods of its Valhallas.    Imperial Deutschland ueber Alles!          CHAPTER III    GARD KIRTLEY      Into this Triumphant Germany young Kirtley had come to recuperate  from the sadness over the loss, the previous year, of his parents  and from a siege of sickness. Still somewhat pale, somewhat weak, he  showed the shock he had undergone. He had toured across southern  Germany and up to Berlin where he had bidden good-by to his chance  American traveling companion, Jim Deming, who was knocking about  Italy and Teutonland. They had exchanged final addresses.    Kirtley, clean-shaven, with pleasant brown eyes, and brown hair  brushed down flat, giving his head the appearance of smallness,  looked very lank and Yankeeish among the robust, fat Teutons of the  Saxon capital. He was entering Dresden on a late afternoon brown  with German sunshine. The school year had begun, but a loitering  summer-time brightened city and countryside. As he made his way  slowly through the throng at the station, he gave evidence of a  rather shy way of looking up and about, an apologetic readiness  to step aside, to yield place, not characteristic of the speedy  American in Europe. He had not, as we have said, come to Germany  for adventure. He had not come merely to idle for the winter. And  certainly he little mistrusted he was finally to figure as a modest  hero in a curious and dangerous experience that linked itself up  with the beginning of the war of which he, like the world at large,  felt not the slightest premonition.    His German teacher had been his favorite in his eastern college  where he had one season been a very fair halfback. His better  showing had exhibited itself in his ability to throw from left field  to home plate on the ball team. This American preceptor of German  parentage had taken an interest in Kirtley with the insistent way of  Teutonic pedagogues. Always commending with a uniform vigor the  Germans and German fashions of living, he had gradually filled Gard  full of the idea of their excelling merits.    Kirtley heard of the tonic of the nutritious Teuton beer and Teuton  music in overflowing measures. In the Kaiser's realm, it appeared,  the digestions are always good. How desirable it would be for Gard  to take on some flesh in the German manner! In that climate,  Professor Rebner claimed with assurance, although he had never been  abroad, one can eat and drink his fill without causing the human  system to rebel as it is apt to in our dry, high-strung America. His  pupil's appetite would come back. Hearty meals of robust cheese and  sausages would be craved with an honest, clamorous hunger that meant  foolish indelicacy here at home.

In my translation  of the Inferno I am often Dr. Carlyle's debtor. His conception of  what a translation should be is very much the same as my own. Of  the Purgatorio there is a prose version which has excellent  qualities, by Mr. W. S. Dugdale. Another version of great merit,  of both the Purgatorio and Paradiso, is that of Mr. A. J. Butler.  It is accompanied by a scholarly and valuable comment, and I owe  much to Mr. Butler's work. But through what seems to me  occasional excess of literal fidelity his English is now and then  somewhat crabbed. \"He overacts the office of an interpreter,\" I  cite again from Howell, \"who doth enslave himself too strictly to  words or phrases. One may be so over-punctual in words that he  may mar the matter.\"    I have tried to be as literal in my translation as was consistent  with good English, and to render Dante's own words in words as  nearly correspondent to them as the difference in the languages  would permit. But it is to be remembered that the familiar uses  and subtle associations which give to words their full meaning  are never absolutely the same in two languages. Love in English  not only SOUNDS but IS different from amor in Latin, or amore in  Italian. Even the most felicitous prose translation must fail  therefore at times to afford the entire and precise meaning of  the original.    Moreover, there are difficulties in Dante's poem for Italians,  and there are difficulties in the translation for English  readers. These, where it seemed needful, I have endeavored to  explain in brief footnotes. But I have desired to avoid  distracting the attention of the reader from the narrative, and  have mainly left the understanding of it to his good sense and  perspicacity. The clearness of Dante's imaginative vision is so  complete, and the character of his narration of it so direct and  simple, that the difficulties in understanding his intention are  comparatively few.    It is a noticeable fact that in by far the greater number of  passages where a doubt in regard to the interpretation exists,  the obscurity lies in the rhyme-word. For with all the abundant  resources of the Italian tongue in rhyme, and with all Dante's  mastery of them, the truth still is that his triple rhyme often  compelled him to exact from words such service as they did not  naturally render and as no other poet had required of them. The  compiler of the Ottimo Commento records, in an often-cited  passage, that \"I, the writer, heard Dante say that never a rhyme  had led him to say other than he would, but that many a time and  oft he had made words say for him what they were not wont to  express for other poets.\" The sentence has a double truth, for it  indicates not only Dante's incomparable power to compel words to  give out their full meaning, but also his invention of new uses  for them, his employment of them in unusual significations or in  forms hardly elsewhere to be found. These devices occasionally  interfere with the limpid flow of his diction, but the  difficulties of interpretation to which they give rise serve  rather to mark the prevailing clearness and simplicity of his  expression than seriously to impede its easy and unperplexed  current. There are few sentences in the Divina Commedia in which  a difficulty is occasioned by lack of definiteness of thought or  distinctness of image.    A far deeper-lying and more pervading source of imperfect  comprehension of the poem than any verbal difficulty exists in  the double or triple meaning that runs through it. The narrative  of the poet's spiritual journey is so vivid and consistent that  it has all the reality of an account of an actual experience; but  within and beneath runs a stream of allegory not less consistent  and hardly less continuous than the narrative itself. To the  illustration and carrying out of this interior meaning even the  minutest details of external incident are made to contribute,  with an appropriateness of significance, and with a freedom from  forced interpretation or artificiality of construction such as no  other writer of allegory has succeeded in attaining. The poem may  be read with interest as a record of experience without attention  to its inner meaning, but its full interest is only felt when  this inner meaning is traced, and the moral significance of the  incidents of the story apprehended by the alert intelligence. The  allegory is the soul of the poem, but like the soul within the  body it does not show itself in independent existence. It is, in  scholastic phrase, the form of the body, giving to it its special  individuality. Thus in order truly to understand and rightly  appreciate the poem the reader must follow its course with a  double intelligence. \"Taken literally,\" as Dante declares in his  Letter to Can Grande, \"the subject is the state of the soul after  death, simply considered. But, allegorically taken, its subject  is man, according as by his good or ill deserts he renders  himself liable to the reward or punishment of Justice.\" It is the  allegory of human life; and not of human life as an abstraction,  but of the individual life; and herein, as Mr. Lowell, whose  phrase I borrow, has said, \"lie its profound meaning and its  permanent force.\" [1] And herein too lie its perennial freshness  of interest, and the actuality which makes it contemporaneous  with every successive generation. The increase of knowledge, the  loss of belief in doctrines that were fundamental in Dante's  creed, the changes in the order of society, the new thoughts of  the world, have not lessened the moral import of the poem, any  more than they have lessened its excellence as a work of art. Its  real substance is as independent as its artistic beauty, of  science, of creed, and of institutions. Human nature has not  changed; the motives of action are the same, though their  relative force and the desires and ideals by which they are  inspired vary from generation to generation. And thus it is that  the moral judgments of life framed by a great poet whose  imagination penetrates to the core of things, and who, from his  very nature as poet, conceives and sets forth the issues of life  not in a treatise of abstract morality, but by means of sensible  types and images, never lose interest, and have a perpetual  contemporaneousness. They deal with the permanent and unalterable  elements of the soul of man.    [1] Mr. Lowell's essay on Dante makes other writing about the  poet or the poem seem ineffectual and superfluous. I must assume  that it will be familiar to the readers of my version, at least  to those among them who desire truly to understand the Divine  Comedy.      The scene of the poem is the spiritual world, of which we are  members even while still denizens of the world of time. In the  spiritual world the results of sin or perverted love, and of  virtue or right love, in this life of probation, are manifest.  The life to come is but the fulfilment of the life that now is.  This is the truth that Dante sought to enforce. The allegory in  which he cloaked it is of a character that separates the Divine  Comedy from all other works of similar intent. In The Pilgrim's  Progress, for example, the personages introduced are mere  simulacra of men and women, the types of moral qualities or  religious dispositions. They are abstractions which the genius of  Bunyan fails to inform with vitality sufficient to kindle the  imagination of the reader with a sense of their actual, living  and breathing existence. But in the Divine Comedy the personages  are all from real life, they are men and women with their natural  passions and emotions, and they are undergoing an actual  experience. The allegory consists in making their characters and  their fates, what all human characters and fates really are, the  types and images of spiritual law. Virgil and Beatrice, whose  nature as depicted in the poem makes nearest approach to purely  abstract and typical existence, are always consistently presented  as living individuals, exalted indeed in wisdom and power, but  with hardly less definite and concrete humanity than that of  Dante himself.    The scheme of the created Universe held by the Christians of the  Middle Ages was comparatively simple, and so definite that Dante,  in accepting it in its main features without modification, was  provided with the limited stage that was requisite for his  design, and of which the general disposition was familiar to all  his readers. The three spiritual realms had their local bounds  marked out as clearly as those of time earth itself. Their  cosmography was but an extension of the largely hypothetical  geography of the tune.    The Earth was the centre of the Universe, and its northern  hemisphere was the abode of man. At the middle point of this  hemisphere stood Jerusalem, equidistant from the Pillars of  Hercules on the West, and the Ganges on the East.    Within the body of this hemisphere was hell, shared as a vast  cone, of which the apex was the centre of the globe; and here,  according to Dante, was the seat of Lucifer. The concave of Hell  had been formed by his fall, when a portion of the solid earth,  through fear of him, ran back to the southern uninhabited  hemisphere, and formed there, directly antipodal to Jerusalem,  the mountain of Purgatory which rose from the waste of waters  that covered this half of the globe. Purgatory was shaped as a  cone, of similar dimensions to that of Hell, amid at its summit  was the Terrestrial Paradise.    Immediately surrounding the atmosphere of the Earth was the  sphere of elemental fire. Around this was the Heaven of the Moon,  and encircling this, in order, were the Heavens of Mercury,  Venus, the Sun, Mars, Jove, Saturn, the Fixed Stars, and the  Crystalline or first moving Heaven.
