Terrestrial distances are now, at least in scientific researches,  universally expressed in kilometres. A kilometre is, however, an  inappropriate unit for celestial distances. When dealing with distances  in our planetary system, the astronomers, since the time of NEWTON, have  always used the mean distance of the earth from the sun as universal  unit of distance. Regarding the distances in the stellar system the  astronomers have had a varying practice. German astronomers, SEELIGER  and others, have long used a stellar unit of distance corresponding to  an annual parallax of 0\".2, which has been called a \"Siriusweite\". To  this name it may be justly objected that it has no international use, a  great desideratum in science. Against the theoretical definition of this  unit it may also be said that a distance is suitably to be defined  through another distance and not through an angle--an angle which  corresponds moreover, in this case, to the _harmonic_ mean distance of  the star and not to its arithmetic mean distance. The same objection may  be made to the unit \"parsec.\" proposed in 1912 by TURNER.    For my part I have, since 1911, proposed a stellar unit which, both in  name and definition, nearly coincides with the proposition of SEELIGER,  and which will be exclusively used in these lectures. A _siriometer_ is  put equal to 10^6 times the planetary unit of distance, corresponding to  a parallax of 0\".206265 (in practice sufficiently exactly 0\".2).    In popular writings, another unit: a _light-year_, has for a very long  time been employed. The relation between these units is        1 siriometer = 15.79   light-years,      1 light-year =  0.0633 siriometers.      5. In regard to _time_ also, the terrestrial units (second, day, year)  are too small for stellar wants. As being consistent with the unit of  distance, I have proposed for the stellar unit of time a _stellar year_  (st.), corresponding to 10^6 years. We thus obtain the same relation  between the stellar and the planetary units of length and time, which  has the advantage that a _velocity_ of a star expressed in siriometers  per stellar year is expressed with the same numerals in planetary units  of length per year.    Spectroscopic determinations of the velocities, through the  DOPPLER-principle, are generally expressed in km. per second. The  relation with the stellar unit is the following:        1 km./sec. = 0.2111 sir./st.,                 = 0.2111 planetary units per year,      1 sir./st. = 4.7375 km./sec.    Thus the velocity of the sun is 20 km./sec. or 4.22 sir./st. (= 4.22  earth distances from the sun per year).    Of the numerical value of the stellar velocity we shall have opportunity  to speak in the following. For the present it may suffice to mention  that most stars have a velocity of the same degree as that of the sun  (in the mean somewhat greater), and that the highest observed velocity  of a star amounts to 72 sir./st. (= 340 km./sec.). In the next chapter I  give a table containing the most speedy stars. The least value of the  stellar velocity is evidently equal to zero.      6. _Intensity of the radiation._ This varies within wide limits. The  faintest star which can give an impression on the photographic plates of  the greatest instrument of the Mount Wilson observatory (100 inch  reflector) is nearly 100 million times fainter than Sirius, a star which  is itself more than 10000 million times fainter than the sun--speaking  of apparent radiation.    The intensity is expressed in _magnitudes_ (_m_). The reason is partly  that we should otherwise necessarily have to deal with very large  numbers, if they were to be proportional to the intensity, and partly  that it is proved that the human eye apprehends quantities of light as  proportional to _m_.    This depends upon a general law in psycho-physics, known as FECHNER's  _law_, which says that changes of the apparent impression of light are  proportional not to the changes of the intensity but to these changes  divided by the primitive intensity. A similar law is valid for all  sensations. A conversation is inaudible in the vicinity of a waterfall.  An increase of a load in the hand from nine to ten hectograms makes no  great difference in the feeling, whereas an increase from one to two  hectograms is easily appreciable. A match lighted in the day-time makes  no increase in the illumination, and so on.    A mathematical analysis shows that from the law of FECHNER it follows  that the impression increases in _arithmetical_ progression (1, 2, 3, 4,  ...) simultaneously with an increase of the intensity in _geometrical_  progression (_I_, _I_^2, _I_^3, _I_^4, ...). It is with the sight the  same as with the hearing. It is well known that the numbers of  vibrations of the notes of a harmonic scale follow each other in a  geometrical progression though, for the ear, the intervals between the  notes are apprehended as equal. The magnitudes play the same role in  relation to the quantities of light as do the logarithms to the  corresponding numbers. If a star is considered to have a brightness  intermediate between two other stars it is not the _difference_ but the  _ratio_ of the quantities of light that is equal in each case.    The branch of astronomy (or physics) which deals with intensities of  radiation is called _photometry_. In order to determine a certain scale  for the magnitudes we must choose, in a certain manner, the _zero-point_  of the scale and the _scale-ratio_.    Both may be chosen arbitrarily. The _zero-point_ is now almost  unanimously chosen by astronomers in accordance with that used by the  Harvard Observatory. No rigorous definition of the Harvard zero-point,  as far as I can see, has yet been given (compare however H. A. 50[3]),  but considering that the Pole-star ([alpha] Ursae Minoris) is used at  Harvard as a fundamental star of comparison for the brighter stars, and  that, according to the observations at Harvard and those of HERTZSPRUNG  (A. N. 4518 [1911]), the light of the Pole-star is very nearly  invariable, we may say that _the zero-point of the photometric scale is  chosen in such a manner that for the Pole-star _m_ = 2.12_. If the  magnitudes are given in another scale than the Harvard-scale (H. S.), it  is necessary to apply the zero-point correction. This amounts, for the  Potsdam catalogue, to -0m.16.    It is further necessary to determine the _scale-ratio_. Our magnitudes  for the stars emanate from PTOLEMY. It was found that the  scale-ratio--giving the ratio of the light-intensities of two  consecutive classes of magnitudes--according to the older values of the  magnitudes, was approximately equal to 21/2. When exact photometry began  (with instruments for measuring the magnitudes) in the middle of last  century, the scale-ratio was therefore put equal to 2.5. Later it was  found more convenient to choose it equal to 2.512, the logarithm of  which number has the value 0.4. The magnitudes being themselves  logarithms of a kind, it is evidently more convenient to use a simple  value of the logarithm of the ratio of intensity than to use this ratio  itself. This scale-ratio is often called the POGSON-scale (used by  POGSON in his \"Catalogue of 53 known variable stars\", Astr. Obs. of the  Radcliffe Observatory, 1856), and is now exclusively used.    It follows from the definition of the scale-ratio that two stars for  which the light intensities are in the ratio 100:1 differ by exactly 5  magnitudes. A star of the 6th magnitude is 100 times fainter than a star  of the first magnitude, a star of the 11th magnitude 10000 times, of the  16th magnitude a million times, and a star of the 21st magnitude 100  million times fainter than a star of the first magnitude. The star  magnitudes are now, with a certain reservation for systematic errors,  determined with an accuracy of 0m.1, and closer. Evidently, however,  there will correspond to an error of 0.1 in the magnitude a considerable  uncertainty in the light ratios, when these differ considerably from  each other.        Sun         -26m.60      Full moon   -11m.77      Venus       - 4m.28      Jupiter     - 2m.35      Mars        - 1m.79      Mercury     - 0m.90      Saturn      + 0m.88      Uranus      + 5m.86      Neptune     + 7m.66    A consequence of the definition of _m_ is that we also have to do with  _negative_ magnitudes (as well as with negative logarithms). Thus, for  example, for _Sirius_ _m_ = -1.58. The magnitudes of the greater  planets, as well as those of the moon and the sun, are also negative, as  will be seen from the adjoining table, where the values are taken from  \"Die Photometrie der Gestirne\" by G. MUeLLER.    The apparent magnitude of the sun is given by ZOeLLNER (1864). The other  values are all found in Potsdam, and allude generally to the maximum  value of the apparent magnitude of the moon and the planets.    The brightest star is _Sirius_, which has the magnitude _m_ = -1.58. The  magnitude of the faintest visible star evidently depends on the  penetrating power of the instrument used. The telescope of WILLIAM  HERSCHEL, used by him and his son in their star-gauges and other stellar  researches, allowed of the discerning of stars down to the 14th  magnitude. The large instruments of our time hardly reach much farther,  for visual observations. When, however, photographic plates are used, it  is easily possible to get impressions of fainter stars, even with rather  modest instruments. The large 100-inch mirror of the Wilson Observatory  renders possible the photographic observations of stars of the 20th  apparent magnitude, and even fainter.    The observations of visual magnitudes are performed almost exclusively  with the photometer of ZOeLLNER in a more or less improved form.      7. _Absolute magnitude._ The apparent magnitude of a star is changed as  the star changes its distance from the observer, the intensity"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22163"],[0,"The Rover Boys on the Farm; or, Last Days at Putnam Hall (#2)"],[1,"several days. As usual, he left the lads in charge of his brother  and the boys' aunt.    \"Now just take it easy for awhile,\" was Mr. Rover's advice, on leaving.  \"Rest up all you can, and then, when you go back to the school, you'll  feel as bright as a dollar.\"    \"Silver or paper, dad?\" asked Tom, mischievously.    \"Now, Tom----\"    \"Oh, I know what you mean, dad, and I'll be as quiet as a mule with a  sandbag tied to his tail,\" answered the fun-loving offspring.    The day after Anderson Rover's departure from the farm was quiet enough,  but on the morning following the boys' uncle received a letter in the  mail which seemed to trouble him not a little.    \"I must attend to this matter without delay,\" said Randolph Rover to his  wife.    \"What is wrong, Randolph?\"    \"I don't think I can explain to you, Martha. It's about those traction  company bonds I purchased a few months ago.\"    \"Those you paid ten thousand dollars for?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"What about them?\"    \"As I said before, I can't explain--it is rather a complicated affair.\"    \"They are yours, aren't they, Randolph?\"    \"Oh, yes. But----\"    \"Aren't they worth what you gave for them?\"    \"I hope so.\"    \"Can't you find out and make sure?\"    \"That is what I am going to do,\" replied Randolph Rover, and heaved a  deep sigh. As my old readers know, he was a very retired individual,  given to scientific research, especially in regard to farming, and knew  little about business.    \"If you've been swindled in any way, you must go after the men who sold  you the bonds,\" said Mrs. Rover. \"We cannot afford to lose so much  money.\"    \"I don't believe I've been swindled--at least, if I have, I think the  party who sold me the bonds will make them good, Martha. I'll know all  about it to-morrow,\" answered Randolph Rover, and there the conversation  came to an end.          CHAPTER II    WHAT HAPPENED ON THE MOUNTAIN      It was on the day that Randolph Rover was to go to the town of Carwell,  fifteen miles away, to see about the bonds, that the three Rover boys  planned for a day's outing.    \"Let us go to the top of Chase Mountain,\" suggested Sam. \"I haven't been  up there for three years.\"    \"Second the suggestion,\" replied Tom. \"We can take a lunch along and  make a day of it,\" and so it was arranged.    Chase Mountain was about three miles away, on the other side of Humpback  Falls, where Sam had once had such a stirring adventure, as told in  detail in \"The Rover Boys at School.\" It was a ragged eminence, and from  the top a view could be had of the country for many miles around.    The day seemed to be a perfect one when the three youths started, and  when they reached the top of the mountain they enjoyed the vast panorama  spread before them. They likewise enjoyed the substantial lunch their  Aunt Martha had provided, and ate until Tom was ready to \"bust his  buttons,\" as he expressed it.    \"Let us try a new path down,\" said Sam, when it came time to go home,  and he and Tom led the way, over a series of rocky ridges and cliffs  anything but easy to traverse. In some places they had to drop ten and  fifteen feet, and once Tom came down on his ankle in a manner that made  him cry with pain.    \"You look out for yourself,\" warned Dick. \"If you sprain an ankle up  here we'll have a job of it getting you home.\"    \"No sprained ankle for mine, thank you,\" replied Tom. And he was more  careful after that.    As Dick came after his brothers he saw something peculiar at one side of  the path he was pursuing. It appeared to be a tin lunch box suspended  from a tree limb by a bit of wire. The box was painted red and seemed to  be new.    \"That's strange,\" said the eldest Rover boy to himself. \"Who would leave  such a thing as that in that position? I'll have to investigate.\"    Without telling Sam and Tom what he was going to do, Dick left the path  and plunged into the bushes which grew between himself and the tree from  which the tin box was suspended. Among the bushes the footing was  uncertain, and hardly had he taken a dozen steps when he felt himself  sinking.    \"Hi! this won't do!\" he cried in alarm, and then plunged down into a big  hole, some bushes, moss and dead leaves coming down on top of him.    In the meantime, Sam and Tom had gone on. Coming to where the path  appeared to divide, they turned to the right, only to find, five minutes  later, that they had made a mistake.    \"Where in the world can Dick be?\" murmured Sam, after he and his brother  had called again. \"I thought he was right behind us.\"    \"So did I, Sam. It's mighty queer what's become of him. If he fell over  a cliff----\" Tom did not finish, but heaved a deep sigh.    With anxious hearts the two boys endeavored to retrace their steps up  the mountainside. They had to climb up one of the cliffs, and just as  this was accomplished it began to rain.    \"More bad luck,\" grumbled Sam. \"If this keeps on we'll soon be soaked.\"    \"Spit, spat, spo! Where did that mountain path go!\" cried Tom, repeating  a doggerel often used by children. \"Dick! Dick!\" he yelled, at the top  of his lungs. Then Sam joined in the call once again. But as before,  there was no answer.    It must be confessed that the two Rover boys were now thoroughly  alarmed. As they had climbed up the mountainside they knew they must be  close to the spot where they had last seen Dick. What had become of  their big brother?    \"Tom, do you think he could have fallen over some cliff and rolled to  the bottom of the mountain?\" questioned Sam, anxiously.    \"How could he roll to the bottom with the trees so thick? He would have  plenty of chance to catch hold of one of them.\"    \"Not if he was knocked unconscious.\"    \"Well, where can he be?\"    \"I don't know.\"    It was now raining steadily, and to protect themselves the two boys  pulled their caps well down over their heads and turned up their coat  collars. They came to a halt under the wide-spreading branches of a  hemlock tree.    \"It beats the nation, that's what it does,\" declared Tom. \"Maybe the  earth opened and swallowed him up!\"    \"Tom, this is no joke.\"    \"And I'm not joking, Sam. I can't understand it at all.\"    \"Is that the path over yonder?\" continued the youngest Rover, pointing  to a spot beyond the opposite side of the hemlock tree.    \"It looks a little like it,\" was Tom's reply. \"Might as well go over and  make sure.\"    Leaving the shelter of the tree, they made their way through the bushes,  which were now beginning to drip from the rain. As they progressed Sam  pushed a big branch from him and let it swing back suddenly, thereby  catching Tom full in the face.    \"Wow!\" spluttered the fun-loving Rover, as he staggered back. \"Hi! Sam,  do you think I need a shower bath? I'm wet enough already.\" And Tom  commenced to brush the water from his face.    \"I didn't mean to let it slip,\" answered Sam. \"But say----\"    What Sam was going to say further will never be known, for just then he  felt himself slipping down into some sort of a hole. He tried to leap  back, and made a clutch at Tom's legs, and the next instant both rolled  over and over and shot downward, out of the daylight into utter  darkness.    They were taken so completely by surprise that neither said a word. Over  and over they went, a shower of dirt, sticks and dead leaves coming  after them. Then they brought up on a big pile of decayed leaves and lay  there, the breath all but knocked out of them.    \"Wha--what--where are we?\" gasped Sam, when he felt able to speak.    \"Say, is thi--this a ne--new shoot-the--the--chutes?\" asked Tom who was  bound to have his fun no matter what occurred.    \"Are you hurt?\"    \"I don't think I am, but I reckon my liver turned over about ten times.  How about you?\"    \"Shook up, that's all,\" answered Sam, after rising to his feet. \"Say, we  came down in a hurry, didn't we?\"    \"Yes, and got no return ticket either.\" Tom looked upward. \"Gracious!  the top of this hole is about fifty feet away! We are lucky that we  didn't break our necks!\"    \"Now we are down here, the question is, How do we get out, Tom?\"    \"Don't ask me any conundrums.\"    \"We've got to get out somehow.\"    \"Unless we want to stay here and save the expense of a cemetery lot.\"    \"Tom!\"    \"Oh, I know it's no joke, Sam. But what is there to do? Here's a hole at  least fifty feet deep and the sides are almost perpendicular. Do you  think we can climb up? I am afraid, if we try it, we'll end by breaking  our necks.\"    \"It certainly is steep,\" answered the youngest brother, looking upward.  \"Say!\" he added, suddenly, \"do you suppose Dick went down in some such  hole as this?\"    \"Perhaps; where there is one hole there may be more. If he went down let  us hope he didn't get killed.\"    As well as they were able, the two boys gazed around them. The hole was  irregular in form, but about fifteen feet in diameter. One side was of  rough rocks and the other dirt and tree roots. At the top the  treacherous bushes overhung all sides of the opening, partly concealing  the yawning pit below.    \"The rain is coming in pretty lively,\" was Sam's comment, presently. \"I  wonder if there is any danger of this hole filling up with water.\"    \"I don't think so, but if it does we can swim out.\"    \"Or get drowned.\"    \"Now who is getting blue?\" demanded Tom.    To keep out of the worst of the rain Sam leaned against one of the sides  of the hole. He felt it give beneath his weight and before he could save  himself he went down into another hole, and Tom came after him.    The boys were scared and both cried out lustily. They did not fall far,  however--in fact, they rather rolled, for the second opening was on a  slant of forty-five degrees. They brought up against something soft, but  this time it was not a bank of decayed leaves.    \"Sam! And Tom!\"    \"Dick!\"    \"Where did you come from?\"    \"How did you get here?\"    \"Are you hurt?\"    \"No, are you?\"    \"No.\"    These were some of the questions asked and "]]]
