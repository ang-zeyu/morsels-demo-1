Apply this to the wood, and when  dry treat with a solution of bichromate of potash in the same proportion  as with the catechu. Bichromate of potash alone in water will give a  good stain. A solution of 2 oz. of pearl ash and 2 oz. of potash mixed  in a quart of water makes a good stain. Potash solution darkens the  wood, and when applied very strong will produce an almost ebon hue, due  to what we might describe as the burning of the wood fiber.          A PLAIN OAK HALL CLOCK      The hall clock shown in the illustration should be made of plain oak.  The following pieces will be needed to make it:       2 back posts, 1-1/2 by 1-1/2 by 81 in., S-4-S.     2 front posts, 1-1/2 by 1-1/2 by 21 in., S-4-S.     2 front posts, 1-1/2 by 1-1/2 by 44 in., S-4-S.    10 front and back horizontals, 1-1/2 by 1-1/2 by 15 in., S-4-S.    10 side horizontals, 1-1/2 by 1-1/2 by 11 in., S-4-S.     1 face, 3/8 by 14 by 14 in., S-4-S.    FRONT DOORS      4 rails, 3/4 by 1-1/2 by 18 in., S-4-S.    4 stiles, 3/4 by 1-1/2 by 12 in., S-4-S.    4 horizontal mullions, 3/16 by 3/4 by 11 in., S-4-S.    4 horizontal mullions, 3/16 by 5/8 by 11 in., S-4-S.    4 vertical mullions, 3/16 by 3/4 by 15 in., S-4-S.    2 vertical mullions, 3/16 by 5/8 by 15 in., S-4-S.    BACK      1 piece, 3/8 by 14 by 21 in., S-4-S.    2 pieces, 3/8 by 14 by 18 in., S-4-S.    4 horizontal mullions, 3/16 by 5/8 by 14 in., S-4-S.    4 vertical mullions, 3/16 by 5/8 by 20 in., S-4-S.    TOP SIDE PANELS      2 pieces, 3/8 by 9-1/2 by 14 in., S-4-S.    8 horizontal mullions, 3/16 by 5/8 by 9-1/2 in., S-4-S.    6 vertical mullions, 3/16 by 5/8 by 14 in., S-4-S.    2 middle side panels, 3/4 by 9-1/2 by 20 in., S-2-S.    LOWER SIDE PANELS      8 vertical mullions, 3/16 by 3/4 by 18 in., S-4-S.    8 vertical mullions, 3/16 by 5/8 by 18 in., S-4-S.    8 horizontal mullions, 3/16 by 3/4 by 9-1/2 in., S-4-S.    8 horizontal mullions, 3/16 by 5/8 by 9-1/2 in., S-4-S.    If the worker will take the trouble to combine the different lengths of  pieces having like thicknesses and widths into pieces of standard  lengths, he will be able to save himself some expense at the mill with  no more work for himself.    Begin work by shaping the ends of the posts as indicated in the drawing.  Lay out and cut the mortises for the tenons of the horizontals or rails.  These mortises need not be deep if the joints are to be reinforced later  with lag screws as is the clock shown. They may be what are known as  stub tenons and mortises. The tenons are not more than 1/2 in. long,  just enough to keep the rail from turning about.    Next lay out and cut the tenons on the rails. Bore the holes for the lag  screws, being careful to bore on adjacent surfaces so that the holes  will miss each other. Use a 3/8 by 3-in. lag screw, boring the hole in  the tenon with a 1/4-in. bit the full depth the screw is to enter.    The side panels should be fitted into grooves in the rails, and before  the frame is put together these panels should be squared up and the  grooves cut in the rails and posts at the proper places.    [Illustration: Hall Clock Complete]    [Illustration: Details of Hall Clock]    The mullions of the lower side panels, it will be noted, are specified  5/8 and 3/4 in. wide. The 5/8-in. pieces are for the central parts of  the frame and the others for the outside. The frame is to be made 1/8  in. larger all around than the distance between the posts and between  the rails so that it may be set in grooves cut in the posts and the  rails to a similar depth, 1/8 in. This is true, also, of the mullions of  the front doors. Square up the shelves so that they may be set into  grooves in the adjacent rails. The middle shelf is to have an overhang  and will rest upon the rails.    The mullions of the top side panels are all of the same width, and it is  not intended or necessary to set their frame into grooves in the posts.  The wood panel back of them gives ample strength.    It is a good plan not to groove the panel upon which the figures are  placed, and which becomes the face of the clock. It is better to fit  this piece in and fasten metal or wood buttons on the back side so that  it can be readily taken off to get at the clock movement from the front.    Make the doors, tenoning the rails into the stiles and grooving both to  receive the mullioned framework of 3/16-in. stuff.    Put the whole frame together, using good hot glue for the joints. When  the glue has dried sufficiently to allow the clamps to be taken off, fit  the doors and hinge them. Butterfly surface hinges look well and are the  easiest to apply.    Thoroughly scrape all the surplus glue off and sandpaper the parts  preparatory to applying the finish.    To finish, apply one coat of mission oak water stain. When dry,  sandpaper lightly, using No. 00 paper. Apply a second coat, diluted with  an equal amount of water. Sand this lightly and put on a very thin coat  of shellac to keep the filler color, which follows, from discoloring the  high lights. When the shellac has had time to harden, sand lightly and  put on a coat of paste filler. Use light filler, colored with umber and  Venetian red in the proportion of 12 oz, of umber, and 4 oz. of red to  20 lb. of filler. The directions for applying the filler will be found  on the can labels. On the hardened filler apply a thin coat of shellac.  Sand the shellac lightly and put on several coats of some good floor  wax, polishing well according to the directions on the can. This is what  is known as a mission oak finish and is quite popular for this type of  furniture design.    The metal figures for the dial come with the clock movement. Some of the  movements come already set in boxes of wood so that all one needs to do  is to shape the projecting ends of the wood containing boxes and fasten  them to the frame with screws from the back. A clock with dial figures,  eight-day movement, striking the hours and half hours, with cathedral  gong can be bought for $4, possibly less.          A ROCKING CHAIR      In furniture construction such as this, nothing is gained by trying to  plane up the stock out of the rough. This is mere drudgery and can be  more cheaply and easily done at the planing mill by machinery. There  will be plenty to do to cut and fit all the different parts. Order the  pieces mill-planed and sandpapered to the sizes specified below.    Plain sawed red oak takes a mission finish nicely and is appropriate.  Some people like quartered white oak better, however. The cost is about  the same.    The stock for the chair is as follows: Widths and thicknesses are  specified exact except for the rear posts and the rockers; but to the  lengths enough surplus stock has been added to allow for squaring the  ends.      2 front posts, 1-5/8 by 2-1/4 by 22-1/2 in., S-4-S.    2 back posts, 1-5/8 by 11 by 40 in., S-2-S.    1 front horizontal, 3/4 by 3-1/2 by 22 in., S-4-S.    1 back horizontal, 3/4 by 3-1/2 by 20 in., S-4-S.    2 back horizontals, 3/4 by 3-1/2 by 20 in., S-4-S.    2 side horizontals, 3/4 by 3-1/2 by 20 in., S-4-S.    2 back slats, 5/16 by 3-1/2 by 20 in., S-4-S.    2 arms, 1 by 4-1/2 by 25 in., S-2-S.    1 rocker, 2-1/4 by 6 by 33 in., S-2-S.    5 bottom slats, 3/4 by 2-1/2 by 19-1/2 in., S-4-S.    [Illustration: Rocking Chair Complete]    [Illustration: Details of Rocking Chair]    Begin work on the posts first. The front posts should have one end of  each squared, after which they can be cut to the exact length. The  rear posts, according to the stock bill, are specified for the exact  thickness. By exercising forethought, both may be got from the piece  ordered. The tops and bottoms of the posts should have their edges  slightly chamfered to prevent their slivering.    The shape of the arm is a little out of the ordinary, but the drawing  indicates quite clearly how it is cut. The arm is fastened to the posts  by means of dowels and glue after the other parts of the chair have been  put together.    Now prepare the curved parts of the back. These parts are worked to  size, after which they are thoroughly steamed and bent in the forms  described on another page. These forms should have a surface curve whose  radius is 22 in. While the parts are drying out, go ahead with the  cutting of the mortises and tenons of post and rail.    Inasmuch as the width of the front of the chair exceeds that of the back  by 2 in., allowance must be made for slant either in the tenons of the  side rails or in the mortises. This will necessitate the use of the  bevel in laying off the shoulders of the tenons.    The slats for the bottom are made long enough so that their ends may be  \"let into\" the front and back rails, a 3/4-in. groove being plowed to  receive them.    Assemble the back, then the front; and when the glue on them has dried,  put the side rails in place, then the arms. The chair should now be  scraped and sandpapered preparatory to applying the finish.    The cushion shown in the picture is made of Spanish roan skin leather  and is filled with elastic felt. Such cushions can be purchased at the  upholsterer's or they can be made by the craftsman himself. Frequently  the two parts of the cushion are laced together by means of leather  thongs.          A CURVED BACK ARM CHAIR      The arm chair, the picture and drawing of which is given herewith is a  companion piece to the rocker described on another page.    With the exception of the back-legs the stock bill which follows gives  the thicknesses and widths exact. To the length, however, enough has  been added to allow squaring up the ends.    Plain sawed white or red oak will be suitable for a design such as this.      Front posts, 2 pieces, 1-5/8 by 2-1/4 by 26 in., S-4-S.    Back posts, 1 piece, 1-5/8 by 8 by 45 in., S-2-S.    Front horizontals, 2 pieces,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23997"],[0,"Eugene Oneguine [Onegin] (#2)"],[1,"on the part of Count Vorontsoff, the Governor of  Odessa, played a part in the transaction. Be this as it may, the  consequences were serious for the poet, who was not only placed  under the surveillance of the police, but expelled from the  Foreign Office by express order of the Tsar \"for bad conduct.\" A  letter on this subject, addressed by Count Vorontsoff to Count  Nesselrode, is an amusing instance of the arrogance with which  stolid mediocrity frequently passes judgment on rising genius. I  transcribe a portion thereof:           Odessa, _28th March (7th April)_ 1824    Count--Your Excellency is aware of the reasons for which, some  time ago, young Pushkin was sent with a letter from Count Capo  d'Istria to General Inzoff. I found him already here when I  arrived, the General having placed him at my disposal, though he  himself was at Kishineff. I have no reason to complain about him.  On the contrary, he is much steadier than formerly. But a desire  for the welfare of the young man himself, who is not wanting in  ability, and whose faults proceed more from the head than from  the heart, impels me to urge upon you his removal from Odessa.  Pushkin's chief failing is ambition. He spent the bathing season  here, and has gathered round him a crowd of adulators who praise  his genius. This maintains in him a baneful delusion which seems  to turn his head--namely, that he is a \"distinguished writer;\"  whereas, in reality he is but a feeble imitator of an author in  whose favour very little can be said (Byron). This it is which  keeps him from a serious study of the great classical poets, which  might exercise a beneficial effect upon his talents--which cannot  be denied him--and which might make of him in course of time a  \"distinguished writer.\"    The best thing that can be done for him is to remove him hence....    The Emperor Nicholas on his accession pardoned Pushkin and received  him once more into favour. During an interview which took place it  is said that the Tsar promised the poet that he alone would in  future be the censor of his productions. Pushkin was restored to  his position in the Foreign Office and received the appointment of  Court Historian. In 1828 he published one of his finest poems,  _Poltava_, which is founded on incidents familiar to English  readers in Byron's _Mazeppa_. In 1829 the hardy poet accompanied  the Russian army which under Paskevitch captured Erzeroum. In 1831  he married a beautiful lady of the Gontchareff family and settled  in the neighbourhood of St. Petersburg, where he remained for the  remainder of his life, only occasionally visiting Moscow and  Mikhailovskoe. During this period his chief occupation consisted  in collecting and investigating materials for a projected history  of Peter the Great, which was undertaken at the express desire of  the Emperor. He likewise completed a history of the revolt of  Pougatchoff, which occurred in the reign of Catherine II. [Note:  this individual having personated Peter III, the deceased husband  of the Empress, raised the Orenburg Cossacks in revolt. This revolt  was not suppressed without extensive destruction of life and  property.] In 1833 the poet visited Orenburg, the scene of the  dreadful excesses he recorded; the fruit of his journey being one  of the most charming tales ever written, _The Captain's Daughter_.  [Note: Translated in _Russian Romance_, by Mrs. Telfer, 1875.]    The remaining years of Pushkin's life, spent in the midst of  domestic bliss and grateful literary occupation, were what  lookers-on style \"years of unclouded happiness.\" They were,  however, drawing rapidly to a close. Unrivalled distinction rarely  fails to arouse bitter animosity amongst the envious, and Pushkin's  existence had latterly been embittered by groundless insinuations  against his wife's reputation in the shape of anonymous letters  addressed to himself and couched in very insulting language. He  fancied he had traced them to one Georges d'Anthes, a Frenchman  in the Cavalier Guard, who had been adopted by the Dutch envoy  Heeckeren. D'Anthes, though he had espoused Madame Pushkin's  sister, had conducted himself with impropriety towards the former  lady. The poet displayed in this affair a fierce hostility quite  characteristic of his African origin but which drove him to his  destruction. D'Anthes, it was subsequently admitted, was not the  author of the anonymous letters; but as usual when a duel is  proposed, an appeal to reason was thought to smack of cowardice.  The encounter took place in February 1837 on one of the islands of  the Neva. The weapons used were pistols, and the combat was of a  determined, nay ferocious character. Pushkin was shot before he  had time to fire, and, in his fall, the barrel of his pistol  became clogged with snow which lay deep upon the ground at the  time. Raising himself on his elbow, the wounded man called for  another pistol, crying, \"I've strength left to fire my shot!\" He  fired, and slightly wounded his opponent, shouting \"Bravo!\" when  he heard him exclaim that he was hit. D'Anthes was, however, but  slightly contused whilst Pushkin was shot through the abdomen. He  was transported to his residence and expired after several days  passed in extreme agony. Thus perished in the thirty-eighth year of  his age this distinguished poet, in a manner and amid surroundings  which make the duel scene in the sixth canto of this poem seem  almost prophetic. His reflections on the premature death of Lenski  appear indeed strangely applicable to his own fate, as generally  to the premature extinction of genius.    Pushkin was endowed with a powerful physical organisation. He was  fond of long walks, unlike the generality of his countrymen, and  at one time of his career used daily to foot it into St. Petersburg  and back, from his residence in the suburbs, to conduct his  investigations in the Government archives when employed on the  History of Peter the Great. He was a good swordsman, rode well,  and at one time aspired to enter the cavalry; but his father not  being able to furnish the necessary funds he declined serving in  the less romantic infantry. Latterly he was regular in his habits;  rose early, retired late, and managed to get along with but very  little sleep. On rising he betook himself forthwith to his literary  occupations, which were continued till afternoon, when they gave  place to physical exercise. Strange as it will appear to many, he  preferred the autumn months, especially when rainy, chill and  misty, for the production of his literary compositions, and was  proportionally depressed by the approach of spring. (Cf. Canto  VII st. ii.)         Mournful is thine approach to me,       O Spring, thou chosen time of love    He usually left St. Petersburg about the middle of September and  remained in the country till December. In this space of time it was  his custom to develop and perfect the inspirations of the  remaining portion of the year. He was of an impetuous yet  affectionate nature and much beloved by a numerous circle of  friends. An attractive feature in his character was his unalterable  attachment to his aged nurse, a sentiment which we find reflected  in the pages of _Eugene Oneguine_ and elsewhere.    The preponderating influence which Byron exercised in the formation  of his genius has already been noticed. It is indeed probable that  we owe _Oneguine_ to the combined impressions of _Childe Harold_ and  _Don Juan_ upon his mind. Yet the Russian poem excels these  masterpieces of Byron in a single particular--namely, in completeness  of narrative, the plots of the latter being mere vehicles for the  development of the poet's general reflections. There is ground for  believing that Pushkin likewise made this poem the record of his  own experience. This has doubtless been the practice of many  distinguished authors of fiction whose names will readily occur to  the reader. Indeed, as we are never cognizant of the real motives  which actuate others, it follows that nowhere can the secret springs  of human action be studied to such advantage as within our own  breasts. Thus romance is sometimes but the reflection of the writer's  own individuality, and he adopts the counsel of the American poet:         Look then into thine heart and write!    But a further consideration of this subject would here be out of  place. Perhaps I cannot more suitably conclude this sketch than by  quoting from his _Ode to the Sea_ the poet's tribute of admiration  to the genius of Napoleon and Byron, who of all contemporaries seem  the most to have swayed his imagination.         Farewell, thou pathway of the free,       For the last time thy waves I view       Before me roll disdainfully,       Brilliantly beautiful and blue.         Why vain regret? Wherever now       My heedless course I may pursue       One object on thy desert brow       I everlastingly shall view--         A rock, the sepulchre of Fame!       The poor remains of greatness gone       A cold remembrance there became,       There perished great Napoleon.         In torment dire to sleep he lay;       Then, as a tempest echoing rolls,       Another genius whirled away,       Another sovereign of our souls.         He perished. Freedom wept her child,       He left the world his garland bright.       Wail, Ocean, surge in tumult wild,       To sing of thee was his delight.         Impressed upon him was thy mark,       His genius moulded was by thee;       Like thee, he was unfathomed, dark       And untamed in his majesty.    Note: It may interest some to know that Georges d'Anthes was tried  by court-martial for his participation in the duel in which Pushkin  fell, found guilty, and reduced to the ranks; but, not being a  Russian subject, he was conducted by a gendarme across the frontier  and then set at liberty.
