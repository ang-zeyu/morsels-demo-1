A GENERAL SURVEY.      Coddling is no longer the chief need of the American composer. While  he still wants encouragement in his good tendencies,--much more  encouragement than he gets, too,--he is now strong enough to profit by  the discouragement of his evil tendencies.    In other words, the American composer is ready for criticism.    The first and most vital flaw of which his work will be accused is the  lack of nationalism. This I should like to combat after the sophistic  fashion of Zeno,--showing, first, why we lack that desideratum, a  strictly national school; secondly, that a strictly national school is  not desirable; and thirdly, that we most assuredly have a national  school.    In building a national individuality, as in building a personal  individuality, there is always a period of discipleship under some  older power. When the rudiments and the essentials are once thoroughly  mastered, the shackles of discipleship are thrown off, and personal  expression in an original way begins. This is the story of every  master in every art: The younger Raphael was only Perugino junior.  Beethoven's first sonatas were more completely Haydn's than the word  \"gewidmet\" would declare. The youthful Canova was swept off his feet  by the unearthing of old Greek masterpieces. Stevenson confesses  frankly his early efforts to copy the mannerisms of Scott and others.  Nations are only clusters of individuals, and subject to the same  rules. Italy borrowed its beginnings from Byzantium; Germany and  France took theirs from Italy; we, ours, from them.    It was inconceivable that America should produce an autocthonous art.  The race is one great mixture of more or less digested foreign  elements; and it is not possible to draw a declaration of artistic, as  of political, independence, and thenceforward be truly free.    Centuries of differentiated environment (in all the senses of the word  environment) are needed to produce a new language or a new art; and it  was inevitable that American music should for long be only a more or  less successful employment of European methods. And there was little  possibility, according to all precedents in art history, that any  striking individuality should rise suddenly to found a school based  upon his own mannerism.    Especially was this improbable, since we are in a large sense of  English lineage. As the co-heirs, with those who remain in the British  Isles, of the magnificent prose and poetry of England, it was possible  for us to produce early in our own history a Hawthorne and a Poe and  an Emerson and a Whitman. But we have had more hindrance than help  from our heritage of English music, in which there has never been a  master of the first rank, Purcell and the rest being, after all,  brilliants of the lesser magnitude (with the permission of that  electric Englishman, Mr. John F. Runciman).    A further hindrance was the creed of the Puritan fathers of our  civilization; they had a granite heart, and a suspicious eye for  music. Here is a cheerful example of congregational lyricism, and a  lofty inspiration for musical treatment (the hymn refers to the fate  of unbaptized infants):        \"A crime it is! Therefore in Bliss        You may not hope to dwell;      But unto you I shall allow        The easiest room in Hell.\"    It was only at the end of the seventeenth century that singing by  note began to supplant the \"lining-out\" barbarism, and to provoke such  fierce opposition as this:        \"First, it is a new way--an unknown tongue; 2d, it is not so      melodious as the old way; 3d, there are so many tunes that      nobody can learn them; 4th, the new way makes a disturbance      in churches, grieves good men, exasperates them, and causes      them to behave disorderly; 5th, it is popish; 6th, it will      introduce instruments; 7th, the names of the notes are      blasphemous; 8th, it is needless, the old way being good      enough; 9th, it requires too much time to learn it; 10th, it      makes the young disorderly.\"    At the time when such puerility was disturbing this cradle of freedom  and cacophony, Bach and Haendel were at work in their contrapuntal  webs, the Scarlattis, Corelli and Tartini and Porpora were alive.  Peri, Josquin and Willaert and Lassus were dead, and the church had  had its last mass from the most famous citizen of the town of  Palestrina. Monteverde was no longer inventing like an Edison; Lulli  had gone to France and died; and Rameau and Couperin were alive.    At this time in the world's art, the Americans were squabbling over  the blasphemy of instruments and of notation! This is not the place to  treat the history of our music. The curious can find enlightenment at  such sources as Mr. Louis C. Elson's \"National Music of America.\" It  must be enough for me to say that the throttling hands of Puritanism  are only now fully loosened. Some of our living composers recall the  parental opposition that met their first inclinations to a musical  career, opposition based upon the disgracefulness, the heathenishness,  of music as a profession.    The youthfulness of our school of music can be emphasized further by a  simple statement that, with the exception of a few names like Lowell  Mason, Louis Moreau Gottschalk, Stephen A. Emery (a graceful writer as  well as a theorist), and George F. Bristow, practically every American  composer of even the faintest importance is now living.    The influences that finally made American music are chiefly German.  Almost all of our composers have studied in Germany, or from teachers  trained there; very few of them turning aside to Paris, and almost  none to Italy. The prominent teachers, too, that have come from  abroad have been trained in the German school, whatever their  nationality. The growth of a national school has been necessarily  slow, therefore, for its necessary and complete submission to German  influences.    It has been further delayed by the meagre native encouragement to  effort of the better sort. The populace has been largely  indifferent,--the inertia of all large bodies would explain that. A  national, a constructive, and collaborative criticism has been  conspicuously absent.    The leaders of orchestras have also offered an almost insurmountable  obstacle to the production of any work from an American hand until  very recently.

The young are often accused of being thoughtless, rash, and unwilling  to be advised.    That the former of these charges is in a great measure just, is not  denied. Indeed, what else could be expected? They are _thoughtless_,  for they are yet almost strangers to the world, and its cares and  perplexities. They are forward, and sometimes _rash_; but this  generally arises from that buoyancy of spirits, which health and vigor  impart. True, it is to be corrected, let the cause be what it may; but  we shall correct with more caution,"]]]
