You are  her father. Surely you can at least try to persuade her.\"    \"Can't coerce a girl.\"    \"I never suggested that you should coerce her, as you put it. I  merely meant that you could point out to her, as a father, where  her duty and happiness lie.\"    \"Drink this!\" cried his lordship with sudden fury, spraying his can  over the nearest bush, and addressing his remark to the invisible  thrips. He had forgotten Lady Caroline completely. \"Don't stint  yourselves! There's lots more!\"    A girl came down the steps of the castle and made her way towards  them. She was a good-looking girl, with an air of quiet efficiency  about her. Her eyes were grey and whimsical. Her head was  uncovered, and the breeze stirred her dark hair. She made a  graceful picture in the morning sunshine, and Reggie Byng, sighting  her from the terrace, wobbled in his tracks, turned pink, and lost  the thread of his remarks.    The sudden appearance of Alice Faraday always affected him like  that.    \"I have copied out the notes you made last night, Lord  Marshmoreton. I typed two copies.\"    Alice Faraday spoke in a quiet, respectful, yet subtly  authoritative voice. She was a girl of great character. Previous  employers of her services as secretary had found her a jewel. To  Lord Marshmoreton she was rapidly becoming a perfect incubus. Their  views on the relative importance of gardening and family histories  did not coincide. To him the history of the Marshmoreton family was  the occupation of the idle hour: she seemed to think that he ought  to regard it as a life-work. She was always coming and digging him  out of the garden and dragging him back to what should have been a  purely after-dinner task. It was Lord Marshmoreton's habit, when  he awoke after one of his naps too late to resume work, to throw  out some vague promise of \"attending to it tomorrow\"; but, he  reflected bitterly, the girl ought to have tact and sense to  understand that this was only polite persiflage, and not to be  taken literally.    \"They are very rough,\" continued Alice, addressing her conversation  to the seat of his lordship's corduroy trousers. Lord Marshmoreton  always assumed a stooping attitude when he saw Miss Faraday  approaching with papers in her hand; for he laboured under a  pathetic delusion, of which no amount of failures could rid him,  that if she did not see his face she would withdraw. \"You remember  last night you promised you would attend to them this morning.\" She  paused long enough to receive a non-committal grunt by way of  answer. \"Of course, if you're busy--\" she said placidly, with a  half-glance at Lady Caroline. That masterful woman could always be  counted on as an ally in these little encounters.    \"Nothing of the kind!\" said Lady Caroline crisply. She was still  ruffled by the lack of attention which her recent utterances had  received, and welcomed the chance of administering discipline. \"Get  up at once, John, and go in and work.\"    \"I am working,\" pleaded Lord Marshmoreton.    Despite his forty-eight years his sister Caroline still had the  power at times to make him feel like a small boy. She had been a  great martinet in the days of their mutual nursery.    \"The Family History is more important than grubbing about in the  dirt. I cannot understand why you do not leave this sort of thing  to MacPherson. Why you should pay him liberal wages and then do his  work for him, I cannot see. You know the publishers are waiting for  the History. Go and attend to these notes at once.\"    \"You promised you would attend to them this morning, Lord  Marshmoreton,\" said Alice invitingly.    Lord Marshmoreton clung to his can of whale-oil solution with the  clutch of a drowning man. None knew better than he that these  interviews, especially when Caroline was present to lend the weight  of her dominating personality, always ended in the same way.    \"Yes, yes, yes!\" he said. \"Tonight, perhaps. After dinner, eh? Yes,  after dinner. That will be capital.\"    \"I think you ought to attend to them this morning,\" said Alice,  gently persistent. It really perturbed this girl to feel that she  was not doing work enough to merit her generous salary. And on the  subject of the history of the Marshmoreton family she was an  enthusiast. It had a glamour for her.    Lord Marshmoreton's fingers relaxed their hold. Throughout the  rose-garden hundreds of spared thrips went on with their morning  meal, unwitting of doom averted.    \"Oh, all right, all right, all right! Come into the library.\"    \"Very well, Lord Marshmoreton.\" Miss Faraday turned to Lady  Caroline. \"I have been looking up the trains, Lady Caroline. The  best is the twelve-fifteen. It has a dining-car, and stops at  Belpher if signalled.\"    \"Are you going away, Caroline?\" inquired Lord Marshmoreton  hopefully.    \"I am giving a short talk to the Social Progress League at  Lewisham. I shall return tomorrow.\"    \"Oh!\" said Marshmoreton, hope fading from his voice.    \"Thank you, Miss Faraday,\" said Lady Caroline. \"The twelve-fifteen.\"    \"The motor will be round at a quarter to twelve.\"    \"Thank you. Oh, by the way, Miss Faraday, will you call to Reggie  as you pass, and tell him I wish to speak to him.\"    Maud had left Reggie by the time Alice Faraday reached him, and  that ardent youth was sitting on a stone seat, smoking a cigarette  and entertaining himself with meditations in which thoughts of  Alice competed for precedence with graver reflections connected  with the subject of the correct stance for his approach-shots.  Reggie's was a troubled spirit these days. He was in love, and he  had developed a bad slice with his mid-iron. He was practically a  soul in torment.    \"Lady Caroline asked me to tell you that she wishes to speak to  you, Mr. Byng.\"    Reggie leaped from his seat.    \"Hullo-ullo-ullo! There you are! I mean to say, what?\"    He was conscious, as was his custom in her presence, of a warm,  prickly sensation in the small of the back. Some kind of  elephantiasis seemed to have attacked his hands and feet, swelling  them to enormous proportions. He wished profoundly that he could  get rid of his habit of yelping with nervous laughter whenever he  encountered the girl of his dreams. It was calculated to give her a  wrong impression of a chap--make her think him a fearful chump and  what not!    \"Lady Caroline is leaving by the twelve-fifteen.\"    \"That's good! What I mean to say is--oh, she is, is she? I see  what you mean.\" The absolute necessity of saying something at least  moderately coherent gripped him. He rallied his forces. \"You  wouldn't care to come for a stroll, after I've seen the mater, or a  row on the lake, or any rot like that, would you?\"    \"Thank you very much, but I must go in and help Lord Marshmoreton  with his book.\"    \"What a rotten--I mean, what a dam' shame!\"    The pity of it tore at Reggie's heart strings. He burned with  generous wrath against Lord Marshmoreton, that modern Simon Legree,  who used his capitalistic power to make a slave of this girl and  keep her toiling indoors when all the world was sunshine.    \"Shall I go and ask him if you can't put it off till after dinner?\"    \"Oh, no, thanks very much. I'm sure Lord Marshmoreton wouldn't  dream of it.\"    She passed on with a pleasant smile. When he had recovered from the  effect of this Reggie proceeded slowly to the upper level to meet  his step-mother.    \"Hullo, mater. Pretty fit and so forth? What did you want to see me  about?\"    \"Well, Reggie, what is the news?\"    \"Eh? What? News? Didn't you get hold of a paper at breakfast?  Nothing much in it. Tam Duggan beat Alec Fraser three up and two to  play at Prestwick. I didn't notice anything else much. There's a  new musical comedy at the Regal. Opened last night, and seems to be  just like mother makes. The Morning Post gave it a topping notice.  I must trickle up to town and see it some time this week.\"    Lady Caroline frowned. This slowness in the uptake, coming so soon  after her brother's inattention, displeased her.    \"No, no, no. I mean you and Maud have been talking to each other  for quite a long time, and she seemed very interested in what you  were saying. I hoped you might have some good news for me.\"    Reggie's face brightened. He caught her drift.    \"Oh, ah, yes, I see what you mean. No, there wasn't anything of  that sort or shape or order.\"    \"What were you saying to her, then, that interested her so much?\"    \"I was explaining how I landed dead on the pin with my spoon out of  a sand-trap at the eleventh hole yesterday. It certainly was a  pretty ripe shot, considering. I'd sliced into this baby bunker,  don't you know; I simply can't keep 'em straight with the iron  nowadays--and there the pill was, grinning up at me from the sand.  Of course, strictly speaking, I ought to have used a niblick, but--\"    \"Do you mean to say, Reggie, that, with such an excellent  opportunity, you did not ask Maud to marry you?\"    \"I see what you mean. Well, as a matter of absolute fact, I, as it  were, didn't.\"    Lady Caroline uttered a wordless sound.    \"By the way, mater,\" said Reggie, \"I forgot to tell you about that.  It's all off.\"    \"What!\"    \"Absolutely. You see, it appears there's a chappie unknown for whom  Maud has an absolute pash. It seems she met this sportsman up in  Wales last summer. She was caught in the rain, and he happened to  be passing and rallied round with his rain-coat, and one thing led  to another. Always raining in Wales, what! Good fishing, though,  here and there. Well, what I mean is, this cove was so deucedly  civil, and all that, that now she won't look at anybody else.

If the breasts continue to receive a sufficient quantity  of blood, the secretion of milk goes on properly, but the womb is  deprived of its necessary supply; the embryo, in consequence, languishes  and dies, and, becoming an extraneous body, is thrown off, producing  abortion; while, on the other hand, should the womb still obtain its due  proportion of blood, the breasts are robbed of it, and the secretion of  milk, if not altogether suppressed, is rendered either deficient in  quantity or deteriorated in quality.    Finally, the breast-milk may become depraved and injurious by the  process of lactation being continued too long, a practice which is,  unfortunately, in this, as well as other countries, extensively  prevalent.    I have not yet had an opportunity of examining the breast-milk in these  diseased conditions except by the eye, and that rarely--but even this  slight examination has enabled me to state, that it was greatly altered  from its natural condition;--that it was more fluid than usual, and  changed in colour, resembling a yellowish turbid serum, instead of  displaying its well-known bluish hue.    I propose in future to attend carefully to this subject, and I would beg  leave to recommend it as one well worthy the notice of those members of  our profession who have made animal chemistry a particular study, having  no doubt that they would be able, by a series of accurate experiments  upon the breast-milk at different periods after delivery, and under  various conditions of the mother, to collect many interesting and  important facts--such, perhaps, as would tend very materially to augment  our knowledge of pathology, and improve our practice in the treatment  of certain diseases[C].    We cannot but believe that the Supreme Being has done nothing without an  infinitely wise and good object, and it is obviously our interest, no  less than our duty, to be guided by those indications of the Divine  purpose which are distinctly to be traced throughout the creation.    It must appear evident to all who examine the matter in question, that  the infant was intended to be nourished for the first few months of its  existence through the medium of a fluid; because no teeth are provided  to prepare for its use substances of a more solid description; and there  can be no doubt that this fluid is the mother's milk;--but when the  child has attained a certain age the teeth begin to appear, doubtless at  the precise time when they are meant to be used; and, therefore, more  solid food should now be given. Besides, in consequence of its new  acquisition, the child sucks less perfectly than before, an additional  proof that weaning ought at this period to be commenced. Indeed, the  teeth are calculated indirectly to produce this effect themselves, the  mother being now liable to suffer inconvenience by letting the child  take the breast--for the latter _bites_ instead of _sucking_ the nipple,  and the pain hence arising may, perhaps, induce the former, for her own  sake, to discontinue a practice injurious to both.    It must also be remembered, that when the teeth are usually produced,  the milk loses its nutritious properties, and this too at a time when  the infant from his increasing size must evidently require a more solid  and substantial, rather than a thinner and less nourishing diet. What  rational argument, therefore, can be offered why he should still be  suckled? If we observe the brute creation, do any analogies appear by  which we can defend the propriety in the human species of protracted  suckling? by no means:--on the contrary, we find that the female animals  soon drive away their young from their dugs; and what is, perhaps, still  more to the purpose, I have heard stated, on good authority, as a  well-known fact among the breeders of cattle, that if calves be allowed  to suck beyond a few months they do not thrive, but, on the contrary,  become lean and diseased.    The belief so generally prevailing, that the longer a child is suckled  the stronger it will become, is a prejudice, like many others concerning  women and children, which has been handed down from mother to daughter  for ages, and has thereby become so universally entertained and so  deeply rooted in the minds of females, that even medical men scarcely  venture to question its propriety. My own experience, however, compels  me to declare, that there is not a more erroneous or mischievous  doctrine; and I can most truly affirm, that I never yet witnessed an  instance where protracted lactation had produced any good effect[D],  though I have seen numerous examples (some of which will be introduced  hereafter) where, I believe, it had been the indirect cause of death.    Having thus strongly noticed the impropriety of long continued  suckling, it will, perhaps, be proper to state my opinion as to the  period when this process should terminate. As a general rule, at nine  months after birth the child ought to be entirely weaned; and in no  instance should he be permitted to suck more than ten. In many cases  suckling may be relinquished with advantage (and occasionally it is  absolutely necessary to discontinue it) before the time first above  mentioned; in others, however, it may be protracted beyond it.    I by no means recommend the breast-milk to be at once superseded by  artificial food, but, on the contrary, that the child should be  _gradually_ accustomed to such aliment from a much earlier period; the  proportion of the latter being increased by degrees, while the  breast-milk is diminished in a corresponding ratio. Hence we shall  produce a double advantage; the mother will be benefited as well as the  child--the former, by giving suck less frequently, and in smaller  quantities at a time than usual, will have the secretion of milk  _gradually lessened_, and, therefore all likelihood of inconvenience, as  far as regards herself when the child is entirely weaned, will be  completely prevented; while, on the other hand, the child being  _insensibly estranged_ from the breast, will have become accustomed to  his new food, so that there will be less chance of its disagreeing with  him when it forms his sole support; and thus the danger which is  generally apprehended from weaning will be either materially lessened or  altogether avoided.    The difficulty of bringing up infants by hand, as it is termed, is well  known; but I suspect that the great mortality which has been recorded as  occurring from this source is not inseparable from the practice itself,  but arises mainly from the improper manner in which it is usually  conducted. When it is determined to bring up an infant by hand, the  substitute offered for the mother's milk should as nearly as possible  resemble that fluid; and the child should be constrained to imbibe it in  _the same manner as_ it would _the milk from the maternal breast_; that  is, it should be _sucked_ from a bottle contrived for that purpose,  instead of the child being gorged with it, by means of a large spoon, or  some other equally improper instrument, as is the usual custom. It is a  fact too palpable to be questioned, that the food generally given to  infants brought up by hand is not only administered in an improper  manner, but is also of an improper quality; their tender stomachs are  daily overloaded with _solid_ instead of _liquid_ aliment, and hence  arises the numerous train of evils which, in my opinion, produce the  great mortality just referred to.          CHAPTER II.    _On Lactation, and the Disorders frequently produced in Women by that  process._      There can be no doubt that, speaking generally, a mother is bound to  suckle her children, and that the performance of this duty is no less  conducive to her own health than to the moral and physical welfare of  her offspring; yet there is not a more unfounded doctrine than that  which presumes every woman who is willing to be also capable of  advantageously discharging the important office of a nurse.    If the mother enjoy good health, and the process be not continued too  long, it is likely to produce beneficial effects both in herself and her  infant; but if she be of a very delicate habit--labour under any  dangerous disease--be subject during the period of lactation to great  affliction, or constant mental inquietude--or should the periodical  appearance return, pregnancy occur, or suckling be continued too long,  it may not only prove highly detrimental to herself, but may be the  means of occasioning serious or fatal consequences to her child.    In cases of extreme delicacy of constitution, lactation will often  produce the worst effects. Many young ladies, on becoming mothers, are  incapable of supporting the constant drain to which the wants of their  infants subject them--they lose their good looks, become gradually  weaker, and as their strength declines, their milk is simultaneously  lessened in quantity, and altered in its other properties.    If the suckling be still continued, their debility daily increases,  distressing pains in the back and loins succeed; the patients become  exceedingly nervous, as it is termed, and are unusually susceptible of  ordinary impressions; pain in the head, often of great violence,  follows, which, in some cases, is succeeded by delirium, in others, by  absolute mania. Nor is this the whole catalogue of ills to which  in such cases the unfortunate mother is subjected: the appetite  fails, distressing languor is experienced by day, while copious  perspirations deluge her by night, and dissipate"]]]
