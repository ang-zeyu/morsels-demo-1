A bark or log shutter was hung at  the window, and a bark door hung on withe hinges, or, if very luxurious,  on leather straps, completed the quickly made home. This was called  rolling-up a house, and the house was called a puncheon and bark house.  A rough puncheon floor, hewed flat with an axe or adze, was truly a  luxury. One settler's wife pleaded that the house might be rolled up  around a splendid flat stump; thus she had a good, firm table. A small  platform placed about two feet high alongside one wall, and supported at  the outer edge with strong posts, formed a bedstead. Sometimes hemlock  boughs were the only bed. The frontier saying was, \"A hard day's work  makes a soft bed.\" The tired pioneers slept well even on hemlock boughs.  The chinks of the logs were filled with moss and mud, and in the autumn  banked up outside with earth for warmth.    These log houses did not satisfy English men and women. They longed to  have what Roger Williams called English houses, which were, however,  scarcely different in ground-plan. A single room on the ground, called  in many old wills the fire-room, had a vast chimney at one end. A  so-called staircase, usually but a narrow ladder, led to a sleeping-loft  above. Some of those houses were still made of whole logs, but with  clapboards nailed over the chinks and cracks. Others were of a lighter  frame covered with clapboards, or in Delaware with boards pinned on  perpendicularly. Soon this house was doubled in size and comfort by  having a room on either side of the chimney.    Each settlement often followed in general outline as well as detail the  houses to which the owners had become accustomed in Europe, with, of  course, such variations as were necessary from the new surroundings, new  climate, and new limitations. New York was settled by the Dutch, and  therefore naturally the first permanent houses were Dutch in shape, such  as may be seen in Holland to-day. In the large towns in New Netherland  the houses were certainly very pretty, as all visitors stated who wrote  accounts at that day. Madam Knights visited New York in 1704, and wrote  of the houses,--I will give her own words, in her own spelling and  grammar, which were not very good, though she was the teacher of  Benjamin Franklin, and the friend of Cotton Mather:--         \"The Buildings are Brick Generaly very stately and high: the Bricks       in some of the houses are of divers Coullers, and laid in Checkers,       being glazed, look very agreable. The inside of the houses is neat       to admiration, the wooden work; for only the walls are plaster'd;       and the Sumers and Gist are planed and kept very white scour'd as       so is all the partitions if made of Bords.\"    The \"sumers and gist\" were the heavy timbers of the frame, the  summer-pieces and joists. The summer-piece was the large middle beam in  the middle from end to end of the ceiling; the joists were cross-beams.  These were not covered with plaster as nowadays, but showed in every  ceiling; and in old houses are sometimes set so curiously and fitted so  ingeniously, that they are always an entertaining study. Another  traveller says that New York houses had patterns of colored brick set in  the front, and also bore the date of building. The Governor's house at  Albany had two black brick-hearts. Dutch houses were set close to the  sidewalk with the gable-end to the street; and had the roof notched like  steps,--corbel-roof was the name; and these ends were often of brick,  while the rest of the walls were of wood. The roofs were high in  proportion to the side walls, and hence steep; they were surmounted  usually in Holland fashion with weather-vanes in the shape of horses,  lions, geese, sloops, or fish; a rooster was a favorite Dutch  weather-vane. There were metal gutters sticking out from every roof  almost to the middle of the street; this was most annoying to passers-by  in rainy weather, who were deluged with water from the roofs. The cellar  windows had small loop-holes with shutters. The windows were always  small; some had only sliding shutters, others had but two panes or  quarels of glass, as they were called, which were only six or eight  inches square. The front doors were cut across horizontally in the  middle into two parts, and in early days were hung on leather hinges  instead of iron.    In the upper half of the door were two round bull's-eyes of heavy  greenish glass, which let faint rays of light enter the hall. The door  opened with a latch, and often had also a knocker. Every house had a  porch or \"stoep\" flanked with benches, which were constantly occupied in  the summer time; and every evening, in city and village alike, an  incessant visiting was kept up from stoop to stoop. The Dutch farmhouses  were a single straight story, with two more stories in the high,  in-curving roof. They had doors and stoops like the town houses, and all  the windows had heavy board shutters. The cellar and the garret were the  most useful rooms in the house; they were store-rooms for all kinds of  substantial food. In the cellar were great bins of apples, potatoes,  turnips, beets, and parsnips. There were hogsheads of corned beef,  barrels of salt pork, tubs of hams being salted in brine, tonnekens of  salt shad and mackerel, firkins of butter, kegs of pigs' feet, tubs of  souse, kilderkins of lard. On a long swing-shelf were tumblers of spiced  fruits, and \"rolliches,\" head-cheese, and strings of sausages--all Dutch  delicacies.    In strong racks were barrels of cider and vinegar, and often of beer.  Many contained barrels of rum and a pipe of Madeira. What a storehouse  of plenty and thrift! What an emblem of Dutch character! In the attic  by the chimney was the smoke-house, filled with hams, bacon, smoked  beef, and sausages.    In Virginia and Maryland, where people did not gather into towns, but  built their houses farther apart, there were at first few sawmills, and  the houses were universally built of undressed logs. Nails were costly,  as were all articles manufactured of iron, hence many houses were built  without iron; wooden pins and pegs were driven in holes cut to receive  them; hinges were of leather; the shingles on the roof were sometimes  pinned, or were held in place by \"weight-timbers.\" The doors had latches  with strings hanging outside; by pulling in the string within-doors the  house was securely locked. This form of latch was used in all the  colonies. When persons were leaving houses, they sometimes set them on  fire in order to gather up the nails from the ashes. To prevent this  destruction of buildings, the government of Virginia gave to each  planter who was leaving his house as many nails as the house was  estimated to have in its frame, provided the owner would not burn the  house down.    Some years later, when boards could be readily obtained, the favorite  dwelling-place in the South was a framed building with a great stone or  log-and-clay chimney at either end. The house was usually set on sills  resting on the ground. The partitions were sometimes covered with a  thick layer of mud which dried into a sort of plaster and was  whitewashed. The roofs were covered with cypress shingles.    Hammond wrote of these houses in 1656, in his _Leah and Rachel_,  \"Pleasant in their building, and contrived delightfull; the rooms large,  daubed and whitelimed, glazed and flowered; and if not glazed windows,  shutters made pretty and convenient.\"    When prosperity and wealth came through the speedily profitable crops of  tobacco, the houses improved. The home-lot or yard of the Southern  planters showed a pleasant group of buildings, which would seem the most  cheerful home of the colonies, only that all dearly earned homes are  cheerful to their owners. There was not only the spacious mansion house  for the planter with its pleasant porch, but separate buildings in which  were a kitchen, cabins for the negro servants and the overseer, a  stable, barn, coach-house, hen-house, smoke-house, dove-cote, and  milk-room. In many yards a tall pole with a toy house at top was  erected; in this bird-house bee-martins built their nests, and by  bravely disconcerting the attacks of hawks and crows, and noisily  notifying the family and servants of the approach of the enemy, thus  served as a guardian for the domestic poultry, whose home stood close  under this protection. There was seldom an ice-house. The only means for  the preservation of meats in hot weather was by water constantly pouring  into and through a box house erected over the spring that flowed near  the house. Sometimes a brew-house was also found in the yard, for making  home-brewed beer, and a tool-house for storing tools and farm  implements. Some farms had a cider-mill, but this was not in the house  yard. Often there was a spinning-house where servants could spin flax  and wool. This usually had one room containing a hand-loom on which  coarse bagging could be woven, and homespun for the use of the negroes.  A very beautiful example of a splendid and comfortable Southern mansion  such as was built by wealthy planters in the middle of the eighteenth  century has been preserved for us at Mount Vernon, the home of George  Washington.    Mount Vernon was not so fine nor so costly a house as many others built  earlier in the century, such as Lower Brandon--two centuries and a half  old--and Upper Brandon, the homes of the Harrisons; Westover, the home  of the Byrds; Shirley, built in 1650, the home of the Carters; Sabin  Hall, another Carter home, is still standing on the Rappahannock with  its various and many quarters and outbuildings, and is a splendid  example of colonial architecture.

This is an impressive theory,  but it will not bear close scrutiny.  Human nature everywhere responds  to the influence of personality.  In Greece this response is more  marked than anywhere else.  No people in the world has been so  completely dominated by personal figures and suffered so grievously  from their feuds, ever since the day when strife first parted Atreides,  king of men, and god-like Achilles.    The outbreak of the European War found Greece under the sway of King  Constantine and his Premier Eleutherios Venizelos; and her history  during that troubled era inevitably centres round these two  personalities.    By the triumphant conduct of the campaigns of 1912 and 1913, King  Constantine had more than effaced the memory of his defeat in 1897.  His victories ministered to the national lust for power and formed an  earnest of the glory that was yet to come to Greece.  Henceforth a halo  of military romance--a thing especially dear to the hearts of  men--shone about the head of Constantine; and his grateful country  bestowed upon him the title of {2} _Stratelates_.  In town mansions and  village huts men's mouths were filled with his praise: one dwelt on his  dauntless courage, another on his strategic genius, a third on his  sympathetic recognition of the claims of the common soldier, whose  hardships he shared, and for whose life he evinced a far greater  solicitude than for his own.    But it was not only as a leader of armies that King Constantine  appealed to the hearts of his countrymen.  They loved to explain to  strangers the reason of the name _Koumbaros_ or \"Gossip,\" by which they  commonly called him.  It was not so much, they would say, that he had  stood godfather to the children born to his soldiers during the  campaigns, but rather that his relations with the rank and file of the  people at large were marked by the intimate interest of a personal  companion.    In peace, as in war, he seemed a prince born to lead a democratic  people.  With his tall, virile figure, and a handsome face in which  strength and dignity were happily blended with simplicity, he had a  manner of address which was very engaging: his words, few, simple,  soldier-like, produced a wonderful effect; they were the words of one  who meant and felt what he said: they went straight to the hearer's  heart because they came straight from the speaker's.    Qualities of a very different sort had enabled M. Venizelos to impose  himself upon the mind of the Greek nation, and to make his name current  in the Chancelleries of the world.    Having begun life as an obscure lawyer in Crete, he had risen through a  series of political convulsions to high notability in his native  island; and in 1909 a similar convulsion in Greece--brought about not  without his collaboration--opened to him a wider sphere of activity.  The moment was singularly opportune.    The discontent of the Greek people at the chronic mismanagement of  their affairs had been quickened by the Turkish Revolution into  something like despair.  Bulgaria had exploited that upheaval by  annexing Eastern Rumelia: Greece had failed to annex Crete, and ran the  risk, if the Young Turks' experiment succeeded, of seeing the {3}  fulfilment of all her national aspirations frustrated for ever.  A  group of military malcontents in touch with the Cretan leader  translated the popular feeling into action: a revolt against the reign  of venality and futility which had for so many years paralyzed every  effort, which had sometimes sacrificed and always subordinated the  interests of the nation to the interests of faction, and now left  Greece a prey to Bulgarian and Ottoman ambition.  The old politicians  who were the cause of the ill obviously could not effect a cure.  A new  man was needed--a man free from the deadening influences of a corrupt  past--a man daring enough to initiate a new course and tenacious enough  to push on with inexorable purpose to the goal.    During the first period of his career, M. Venizelos had been a capable  organizer of administrative departments no less than a clever  manipulator of seditious movements.  But he had mainly distinguished  himself as a rebel against authority.  And it was in the temper of a  rebel that he came to Athens.  Obstacles, however, external as well as  internal, made a subversive enterprise impossible.  With the quick  adaptability of his nature, he turned into a guardian of established  institutions: the foe of revolution and friend of reform.  Supported by  the Crown, he was able to lift his voice for a \"Revisionist\" above the  angry sea of a multitude clamouring for a \"Constituent Assembly.\"    All that was healthy in the political world rallied to the new man; and  the new man did not disappoint the faith placed in him.  Through the  next two years he stood in every eye as the embodiment of constructive  statesmanship.  His Government had strength enough in the country to  dispense with \"graft.\"  The result was a thorough overhauling of the  State machinery.  Self-distrust founded on past failures vanished.  Greece seemed like an invalid healed and ready to face the future.  It  was a miraculous change for a nation whose political life hitherto had  exhibited two traits seldom found combined: the levity of childhood and  the indolence of age.    For this miracle the chief credit undoubtedly belonged {4} to M.  Venizelos.  He had brought to the task a brain better endowed than any  associated with it.  His initiative was indefatigable; his decision  quick.  Unlike most of his countrymen, he did not content himself with  ideas without works.  His subtlety in thinking did not serve him as a  substitute for action.  To these talents he added an eloquence of the  kind which, to a Greek multitude, is irresistible, and a certain gift  which does not always go with high intelligence, but, when it does, is  worth all the arts of the most profound politician and accomplished  orator put together.  He understood, as it were instinctively, the  character of every man he met, and dealt with him accordingly.  This  tact, coupled with a smile full of sweetness and apparent frankness,  gave to his vivid personality a charm which only those could appraise  who experienced it.    Abroad the progress of M. Venizelos excited almost as much interest as  it did in Greece.  The Greeks are extraordinarily sensitive to foreign  opinion: a single good word in a Western newspaper raises a politician  in public esteem more than a whole volume of home-made panegyric.  M.  Venizelos had not neglected this branch of his business; and from the  outset every foreign journalist and diplomatist who came his way was  made to feel his fascination: so that, even before leaving his native  shores, the Cretan had become in the European firmament a star of the  third or fourth magnitude.  Reasons other than personal contributed to  enlist Western opinion in his favour.  Owing to her geographical  situation, Greece depends for the fulfilment of her national  aspirations and for her very existence on the Powers which command the  Mediterranean.  A fact so patent had never escaped the perception of  any Greek politician.  But no Greek politician had ever kept this fact  more steadily in view, or put "]]]
