Then keep them clean.        7. Don't leave the company street or barracks on the first day,      except with the permission of your company commander. Don't ask for      this permission unless you have a valid reason.        RULES OF CONDUCT FOR CAMP LIFE      The first few days will be easy and profitable if you will read  carefully and adhere to the following plan of procedure:        1. Get up at the first note of reveille and get quickly into proper      uniform.        2. Get within two or three feet of your place in ranks and await the      sounding of assembly for reveille and then step into ranks.        3. Stand at attention after the first sergeant commands \"Fall In.\"      Remember that this command is equivalent to \"Company, Attention.\"        4. After reveille, make up your bed, arrange neatly your equipment,      and clean up the ground under and around your cot. The company      commander will require the beds made up and the equipment arranged      in a prescribed way.        5. Wash for breakfast.        6. Upon returning from breakfast, go at once to the toilet. Next,      prepare the equipment prescribed to be worn to drill. This is      especially important when the full pack is prescribed. Assist your      tent mates in policing the ground in and around your tent.        7. If you need medical attention give your name to the first      sergeant at reveille and report to him at his tent upon your return      from breakfast. Don't wait until you are sick to report to the      hospital, but go as soon as you feel in the least unwell.        8. When the first call for drill is blown, put on your equipment,      inspect your bed and property to see that everything is in order,      and then go to your place in ranks.        9. After the morning drill, get ready for dinner. Get a little rest      at this time if possible.        10. After dinner a short rest is usually allowed before the      afternoon drill. Take advantage of this opportunity; get off your      feet and rest. Be quiet so that your tent mates may rest.        11. Following the afternoon drill there is a short intermission      before the ceremony of retreat. During this time take a quick bath,      shave, get into the proper uniform for retreat, shine your shoes and      brush your clothes and hat. Be the neatest man in the company.        12. Supper usually follows retreat.        13. After supper, you usually have some spare time until taps. The      Y. M. C. A. generally provides a place supplied with Bibles,      newspapers, good magazines, and writing material. Don't be ashamed      to read the Bible. Don't forget to write to the folks back home.        14. Be in bed with lights out at taps. After taps and before      reveille, remain silent, thus showing consideration for those who      are sleeping or trying to sleep.        15. Consult the company bulletin board at least twice daily. On this      bulletin board is usually found the following information:            (a) A list of calls.          (b) The proper uniform for each formation.          (c) Schedule of drills.          (d) Special orders and instructions.        16. Get all your orders from (a) the bulletin board, (b) the first      sergeant, (c) the acting noncommissioned officers, (d) the company      commander. Don't put much faith in rumors.        ADVICE REGARDING HABITS      Your life in camp in regard to food, exercise, hours of sleep,  surroundings, and comforts, will differ greatly from that you lead as a  civilian. You will submit your body to a sudden, severe, physical test.  In order to prepare your body for this change in manner of living and  work, we recommend that for a short time prior to your arrival in camp,  and thereafter, you observe the following suggestions:         1. Use no alcohol of any kind.         2. Stop smoking, or at least be temperate in the use of tobacco.         3. Eat and drink moderately. Chew your food well. It is advisable,       however, to drink a great deal of cool (not cold) water between       meals.         4. Don't eat between meals.         5. Accustom yourself to regular hours as to sleeping, eating, and       the morning functions.         6. Keep away from all soda fountains and soft drink stands.         7. For at least two weeks prior to your arrival at camp, take       regularly the exercises described in this book.    Most men are troubled with their feet during the first week of each  camp, usually because they do not observe the following precautions:         1. If you have ever had trouble with the arches of your feet, wear          braces for them.         2. Lace your shoe as tightly as comfort will permit.         3. Wash the feet daily.         4. Every morning shake a little talcum powder or \"Foot Ease\" in          each shoe.         5. Each morning put on a fresh pair of socks. Your socks should fit          the feet so neatly that no wrinkles remain in them and yet not be          so tight that they bind the foot. Do not wear a sock with a hole in          it or one that has been darned.         6. Some men cannot wear light wool socks with comfort. Do not wear          silk or cotton socks until you have given light wool socks a fair          trial.         7. In case of a blister, treat it as directed in Chapter X.         8. Most of the foot troubles are caused by wearing shoes that do          not fit properly. If the shoe is too large it rubs blisters, if too          small it cramps the foot and causes severe pain. Marching several          hours while carrying about thirty pounds of equipment causes each          foot to expand at least one half a size in length and          correspondingly in breadth; hence the size of the shoe you wear in          the office will be too small for training camp use. If you have          been living a sedentary life, ask for a pair of shoes larger than          you ordinarily wear.         9. In case the tendon in your heel becomes tender, report at once          to the hospital tent and get it strapped.        A DISCIPLINED SOLDIER      You will be expected to become quickly amenable both mentally and  physically to discipline. A clear conception on your part of what drills  are disciplinary in character and what discipline really is, will help  you to become a disciplined soldier. Drills executed at attention are  disciplinary exercises and are designed to teach precise and soldierly  movements and to inculcate that prompt and subconscious obedience which  is essential to proper military control. Hence, all corrections should  be given and received in an impersonal manner. Never forget that you  lose your identity as an individual when you step into ranks; you then  become merely a unit of a mass. As soon as you obey properly, promptly,  and, at times, unconsciously, the commands of your officers, as soon as  you can cheerfully give up pleasures and personal privileges that  conflict with the new order of life to which you have submitted, you  will then have become a disciplined man.        DRESS      The uniform you will wear stands for Duty, Honor, and Country. You  should not disgrace it by the way you wear it or by your conduct any  more than you would trample the flag of the United States of America  under foot. You must constantly bear in mind that in our country a  military organization is too often judged by the acts of a few of its  members. When one or two soldiers in uniform conduct themselves in an  ungentlemanly or unmilitary manner to the disgrace of the uniform, the  layman shakes his head and condemns all men wearing that uniform. Hence,  show by the way in which you wear your uniform that you are proud of it;  this can be best accomplished by observing the following rules:         1. Carry yourself at all times as though you were proud of          yourself, your uniform, and your country.         2. Wear your hat so that the brim is parallel to the ground.         3. Have all buttons fastened.         4. Never have sleeves rolled up.         5. Never wear sleeve holders.         6. Never leave shirt or coat unbuttoned at the throat.         7. Have leggins and trousers properly laced.         8. Keep shoes shined.         9. Always be clean shaved.        10. Keep head up and shoulders square.        11. Camp life has a tendency to make one careless as to personal          cleanliness. Bear this in mind.        SALUTING      The military salute is universal. It is at foundation but a courteous  recognition between two individuals of their common fellowship in the  same honorable profession, the profession of arms. Regulations require  that it be rendered by both the senior and the junior, as bare courtesy  requires between gentlemen in civil life. It is the military equivalent  of the laymen's expressions \"Good Morning,\" or \"How do you do?\"  Therefore be punctilious about saluting; be proud of the manner in which  you execute your salute, and make it indicative of discipline and good  breeding. Always look at the officer you are saluting. The junior  salutes first. It is very unmilitary to salute with the left hand in a  pocket, or with a cigarette, cigar, or pipe in the mouth. Observe the  following general rules:         1. Never salute an officer when you are in ranks.         2. Indoors (in your tent) unarmed, do not salute but stand at          attention, uncovered, on the entrance of an officer. If he speaks          to you, then salute.         3. Indoors, armed, render the prescribed salute, i.e., the rifle          salute at order arms or at trail.         4. Outdoors, armed, render the prescribed salute, i.e., the rifle          salute at right shoulder arms.         5. Outdoors, unarmed, or armed with side arms, salute with the          right hand.        ARMY SLANG      The following army slang is universally employed:         \"Bunkie\"--the"]]]
