Little Mr. Hummer turned and flew as he never had  flown before. He wanted to get back before a new king was chosen, so  that King Eagle might never know that his subjects had lost faith in  him.    \"He was so out of breath when he reached the other birds that he  couldn't say a word for a few minutes. Then he told them that King Eagle  was coming. The other birds had proved that they were not brave when  they had refused to go out in search of Old Mother Nature, and now they  proved it again. Instead of waiting to give King Eagle a royal welcome,  they hurried away, one after another. They were afraid to meet him,  because in their hearts they knew that they had done a cowardly thing in  deciding to choose a new king. So when King Eagle, weary and with torn  wings and broken tail feathers, dropped down to the tall tree in the  Green Forest, there was none to give him greeting save little Mr.  Hummer.    \"King Eagle said nothing about the failure of the other birds to give  him greeting but at once sent little Mr. Hummer around to tell all the  others that far away he had found Old Mother Nature preparing a new land  for them, and that when she gave the word, he would lead them to it.  Then King Eagle flew to his home on the cliff of the mountain, and not  one word did he ever say of his terrible journey, of how he had gone  hungry, had been beaten by storms, and had suffered from cold and  weariness, yet never once had turned back.    \"But when Old Mother Nature came later and announced that the new land  was ready for the birds, she first called them together and told them  all that King Eagle had suffered, and how he had proved himself a royal  king. As a reward she promised that his family should be rulers over the  birds forever, and as a sign that this should be so, she reached forth  and touched his black head, and it became snowy white, and all the birds  cried 'Long live the king!'    \"Then Old Mother Nature turned to tiny Mr. Hummer and touched his  throat, and behold a shining ruby was there, the reward of loyalty,  faith, and bravery.    \"Then King Eagle mounted into the air and proudly led the way to the  promised land. And so the birds went forth and peopled the Great World,  and King Eagle and his children and his children's children have ruled  the air ever since and have worn the snowy crown which King Eagle of  long ago so bravely won.\"                                           II                     HOW OLD MR. MINK TAUGHT HIMSELF TO SWIM                                           II                     HOW OLD MR. MINK TAUGHT HIMSELF TO SWIM      Of all the little people who live in the Green Forest or on the Green  Meadows or around the Smiling Pool, Billy Mink has the most  accomplishments. At least, it seems that way to his friends and  neighbors. He can run very swiftly; he can climb very nimbly; his eyes  and his ears and his nose are all wonderfully keen, and--he can swim  like a fish. Yes, Sir, Billy Mink is just as much at home in the water  as out of it. So, wherever he happens to be, in the Green Forest, out on  the Green Meadows, along the Laughing Brook, or in the Smiling Pool, he  feels perfectly at home and quite able to look out for himself.    Once Billy Mink had boasted that he could do anything that any one else  who wore fur could do, but boasters almost always come to grief, and  Grandfather Frog had brought Billy to grief that time. He had invited  every one to meet at the Smiling Pool and see Billy Mink do whatever any  one else who wore fur could do, and then, when Billy had run and jumped  and climbed and swum, Grandfather Frog had called Flitter the Bat. There  was some one wearing fur who could fly, and of course Billy Mink  couldn't do that. It cured Billy of boasting,--for a while, anyway.    Now Peter Rabbit, who can do little but run and jump, used sometimes to  feel a wee bit of envy in his heart when he thought of all the things  that Billy Mink could do and do well. Somehow Peter could never make it  seem quite right that one person should be able to do so many things  when others could do only one or two things. He said as much to  Grandfather Frog one day, as they watched Billy Mink catch a fat trout.    \"Chug-a-rum!\" said Grandfather Frog and looked sharply at Peter.  \"Chug-a-rum! People never know what they can do till they try. Once upon  a time Billy Mink's great-great-ever-so-great-grandfather couldn't swim  any more than you can, but he didn't waste any time foolishly wishing  that he could.\"    \"What did he do?\" asked Peter eagerly.    \"Learned how,\" replied Grandfather Frog gruffly. \"Made it his business  to learn how. Then he taught his children, and they taught their  children, and after a long time it came natural to the Mink family to  swim.\"    \"Did it take old Mr. Mink very long to learn how?\" asked Peter  wistfully.    \"Quite a while,\" replied Grandfather Frog. \"Quite a while. Perhaps you  would like to hear about it.\"    \"Oh, if you please, Grandfather Frog,\" cried Peter. \"If you please. I  should love dearly to hear about it. Perhaps then I can learn to swim.\"    Grandfather Frog snapped up a foolish green fly that happened his way,  and Peter heard something that sounded very much like a chuckle. He  looked at Grandfather Frog suspiciously. Was that chuckle because of the  foolish green fly, or was Grandfather Frog laughing at him? Peter wasn't  sure.    \"It all happened a long time ago when the world was young, as a great  many other things happened,\" began Grandfather Frog. \"Old Mr. Mink, the  ever-so-great-grandfather of Billy Mink, couldn't do all the things that  Billy can now. For instance, he couldn't swim. But he could do a great  many things, and he was very smart. It has always run in the Mink family  to be smart. He dressed very much as Billy does now, except that he  didn't have the waterproof coat that Billy has. And he was a great  traveler, just as Billy is. Everybody smaller than he and some who were  bigger were a little bit afraid of old Mr. Mink, for he was quite as sly  and cunning as Mr. Fox, and it was suspected that he knew a great deal  more than he ever admitted about eggs that were stolen and nests that  were broken up, and other strange things that happened in the Green  Forest and along the Laughing Brook. But he never was caught doing  anything wrong and always seemed to be minding his own business, so, all  things considered, he got along very well with his neighbors.    \"Now Mr. Mink was small and spry, and his wits were as nimble as his  feet. He saw all that was going on about him, and he was wise enough to  keep his tongue still, so that it never got him into trouble as gossipy  tongues do some people I know.\"    Peter Rabbit fidgeted uneasily. It seemed to him that Grandfather Frog  had looked at him very hard when he said this. But Grandfather Frog just  cleared his throat and went on with his story.    \"Yes, Sir, old Mr. Mink kept his eyes wide open and his ears wide open  and the wits in his little brown head always working. He noticed that  those who were fussy about what they ate and insisted on having a  special kind of food often went hungry or had to hunt long and hard to  find what they liked, so he made up his mind to learn to eat many kinds  of food. This is how it happens that he learned to like fish. His big  cousin, Mr. Otter, often caught a bigger fish than he could eat all  himself and would leave some of it on the bank. Mr. Mink would find it  and help himself.    \"But having to depend on Mr. Otter to get the fish for him didn't suit  Mr. Mink at all. In the first place, he didn't have as much as he  wanted. And then again he didn't have it when he wanted it. 'If I could  learn to catch fish for myself, I would be much better off,' thought Mr.  Mink. After this he spent a great deal of time on the banks of the  Smiling Pool watching Mr. Otter swim to see just how he did it. 'If he  can swim, I can swim,' said Mr. Mink to himself, and went off up the  Laughing Brook to a quiet little pool where the water was not deep.    \"At first he didn't like it at all. The water got in his ears and up his  nose and choked him. And then it was so dreadfully wet! But he would  grit his teeth and keep at it. After a while he got so that he could  paddle around a little. Gradually he lost his fear of the water. Then he  found that because he naturally moved so quickly he could sometimes  catch foolish minnows who swam in where the water was very shallow. This  was great sport, and he quite often had fish for dinner now.    \"But he wasn't satisfied. No, Sir, he wasn't satisfied. Whatever Mr.  Mink did, he wanted to do well. He could run well and climb well, and  there was no better hunter in all the Green Forest. He was bound that he  would swim well. So he kept trying and trying. He learned to fill his  lungs with air and hold his breath for a long time, while he swam as  fast as ever he could with his head under water as he had seen his  cousin, Mr. Otter, swim. The more he did this, the longer he could hold  his breath. After a while he found that because he was slim and trim and  moved so fast, he could out-swim Mr. Muskrat, and this made him feel  very good indeed, for Mr. Muskrat spent nearly all his time in the water  and was accounted a very good swimmer. There was only one thing that  bothered Mr. Mink. The water was so dreadfully wet! Every time he came  out of it, he had to run his hardest to dry off and keep from getting  cold. This was very tiresome and he did wish that there was an easier  way of drying off.    \"Then came the bad time, the sad time, when food was scarce, and most of  the little people in the Green Forest and on the Green Meadow went  hungry. But Mr. Mink didn't go hungry. Oh, my, no! You see, he had  learned to catch fish, and so he had plenty to eat.

So Clancy rode to wheel them -- he was racing on the wing      Where the best and boldest riders take their place,     And he raced his stock-horse past them, and he made the ranges ring      With the stockwhip, as he met them face to face.     Then they halted for a moment, while he swung the dreaded lash,      But they saw their well-loved mountain full in view,     And they charged beneath the stockwhip with a sharp and sudden dash,      And off into the mountain scrub they flew.       Then fast the horsemen followed, where the gorges deep and black      Resounded to the thunder of their tread,     And the stockwhips woke the echoes, and they fiercely answered back      From cliffs and crags that beetled overhead.     And upward, ever upward, the wild horses held their way,      Where mountain ash and kurrajong grew wide;     And the old man muttered fiercely, 'We may bid the mob good day,      _NO_ man can hold them down the other side.'       When they reached the mountain's summit, even Clancy took a pull,      It well might make the boldest hold their breath,     The wild hop scrub grew thickly, and the hidden ground was full      Of wombat holes, and any slip was death.     But the man from Snowy River let the pony have his head,      And he swung his stockwhip round and gave a cheer,     And he raced him down the mountain like a torrent down its bed,      While the others stood and watched in very fear.       He sent the flint stones flying, but the pony kept his feet,      He cleared the fallen timber in his stride,     And the man from Snowy River never shifted in his seat --      It was grand to see that mountain horseman ride.     Through the stringy barks and saplings, on the rough and broken ground,      Down the hillside at a racing pace he went;     And he never drew the bridle till he landed safe and sound,      At the bottom of that terrible descent.       He was right among the horses as they climbed the further hill,      And the watchers on the mountain standing mute,     Saw him ply the stockwhip fiercely, he was right among them still,      As he raced across the clearing in pursuit.     Then they lost him for a moment, where two mountain gullies met      In the ranges, but a final glimpse reveals     On a dim and distant hillside the wild horses racing yet,      With the man from Snowy River at their heels.       And he ran them single-handed till their sides were white with foam.      He followed like a bloodhound on their track,     Till they halted cowed and beaten, then he turned their heads for home,      And alone and unassisted brought them back.     But his hardy mountain pony he could scarcely raise a trot,      He was blood from hip to shoulder from the spur;     But his pluck was still undaunted, and his courage fiery hot,      For never yet was mountain horse a cur.       And down by Kosciusko, where the pine-clad ridges raise      Their torn and rugged battlements on high,     Where the air is clear as crystal, and the white stars fairly blaze      At midnight in the cold and frosty sky,     And where around the Overflow the reedbeds sweep and sway      To the breezes, and the rolling plains are wide,     The man from Snowy River is a household word to-day,      And the stockmen tell the story of his ride.          Old Pardon, the Son of Reprieve           You never heard tell of the story?      Well, now, I can hardly believe!     Never heard of the honour and glory      Of Pardon, the son of Reprieve?     But maybe you're only a Johnnie      And don't know a horse from a hoe?     Well, well, don't get angry, my sonny,      But, really, a young un should know.       They bred him out back on the 'Never',      His mother was Mameluke breed.     To the front -- and then stay there -- was ever      The root of the Mameluke creed.     He seemed to inherit their wiry      Strong frames -- and their pluck to receive --     As hard as a flint and as fiery      Was Pardon, the son of Reprieve.       We ran him at many a meeting      At crossing and gully and town,     And nothing could give him a beating --      At least when our money was down.     For weight wouldn't stop him, nor distance,      Nor odds, though the others were fast,     He'd race with a dogged persistence,      And wear them all down at the last.       At the Turon the Yattendon filly      Led by lengths at the mile-and-a-half,     And we all began to look silly,      While _HER_ crowd were starting to laugh;     But the old horse came faster and faster,      His pluck told its tale, and his strength,     He gained on her, caught her, and passed her,      And won it, hands-down, by a length.       And then we swooped down on Menindie      To run for the President's Cup --     Oh! that's a sweet township -- a shindy      To them is board, lodging, and sup.     Eye-openers they are, and their system      Is never to suffer defeat;     It's 'win, tie, or wrangle' -- to best 'em      You must lose 'em, or else it's 'dead heat'.       We strolled down the township and found 'em      At drinking and gaming and play;     If sorrows they had, why they drowned 'em,      And betting was soon under way.     Their horses were good 'uns and fit 'uns,      There was plenty of cash in the town;     They backed their own horses like Britons,      And, Lord! how _WE_ rattled it down!       With gladness we thought of the morrow,      We counted our wagers with glee,     A simile homely to borrow --      'There was plenty of milk in our tea.'     You see we were green; and we never      Had even a thought of foul play,     Though we well might have known that the clever      Division would 'put us away'.       Experience 'docet', they tell us,      At least so I've frequently heard,     But, 'dosing' or 'stuffing', those fellows      Were up to each move on the board:     They got to his stall -- it is sinful      To think what such villains would do --     And they gave him a regular skinful      Of barley -- green barley -- to chew.       He munched it all night, and we found him      Next morning as full as a hog --     The girths wouldn't nearly meet round him;      He looked like an overfed frog.     We saw we were done like a dinner --      The odds were a thousand to one     Against Pardon turning up winner,      'Twas cruel to ask him to run.       We got to the course with our troubles,      A crestfallen couple were we;     And we heard the 'books' calling the doubles --      A roar like the surf of the sea;     And over the tumult and louder      Rang 'Any price Pardon, I lay!'     Says Jimmy, 'The children of Judah      Are out on the warpath to-day.'       Three miles in three heats: -- Ah, my sonny,      The horses in those days were stout,     They had to run well to win money;      I don't see such horses about.     Your six-furlong vermin that scamper      Half-a-mile with their feather-weight up;     They wouldn't earn much of their damper      In a race like the President's Cup.       The first heat was soon set a-going;      The Dancer went off to the front;     The Don on his quarters was showing,      With Pardon right out of the hunt.     He rolled and he weltered and wallowed --      You'd kick your hat faster, I'll bet;     They finished all bunched, and he followed      All lathered and dripping with sweat.       But troubles came thicker upon us,      For while we were rubbing him dry     The stewards came over to warn us:      'We hear you are running a bye!     If Pardon don't spiel like tarnation      And win the next heat -- if he can --     He'll earn a disqualification;      Just think over _THAT_, now, my man!'       Our money all gone and our credit,      Our horse couldn't gallop a yard;     And then people thought that _WE_ did it!      It really was terribly hard.     We were objects of mirth and derision      To folk in the lawn and the stand,     And the yells of the clever division      Of 'Any price Pardon!' were grand.       We still had a chance for the money,      Two heats still remained to be run;     If both fell to us -- why, my sonny,      The clever division were done.     And Pardon was better, we reckoned,      His sickness was passing away,     So he went to the post for the second      And principal heat of the day.       They're off and away with a rattle,      Like dogs from the leashes let slip,     And right at the back of the battle      He followed them under the whip.     They gained ten good lengths on him quickly      He dropped right away from the pack;     I tell you it made me feel sickly      To see the blue jacket fall back.       Our very last hope had departed --      We thought the old fellow was done,     When all of a sudden he started      To go like a shot from a gun.     His chances seemed slight to embolden      Our hearts; but, with teeth firmly set,     We thought, 'Now or never!  The old 'un      May reckon with some of 'em yet.'       Then loud rose the war-cry for Pardon;      He swept like the wind down the dip,     And over the rise by the garden,      The jockey was done with the whip     The field were at sixes and sevens --      The pace at the first had been fast --     And hope seemed to drop from the heavens,      For Pardon was coming at last.       And how he did come!  It was splendid;      He gained on them yards every bound,     Stretching out like a greyhound extended,      His girth laid right down on the ground.     A shimmer of silk in the cedars      As into the running they wheeled,     And out flashed the whips on the leaders,      For Pardon had collared the field.       Then right through the ruck he came sailing --      I knew that the battle was won --     The son of Haphazard was failing,      The Yattendon filly was done;     He cut down the Don and the Dancer,      He raced clean away from the mare --     He's in front!
