I understand that in the old  days----\"    \"Yes,\" the uncle said, \"but don't you think it's a coincidence they  breathe exactly the same kind of air we do, considering they claim to  come from another solar system?\"    \"No coincidence at all,\" said Ludovick shortly, no longer able to  pretend he didn't know what the other was getting at. He had heard the  ugly rumor before. Of course sacrilege was not illegal, but it was in  bad taste. \"Only one combination of elements spawns intelligent life.\"    \"They say,\" the uncle continued, impervious to Ludovick's unconcealed  dislike for the subject, \"that there's really only one Belphin, who  lives in the Blue Tower--in a tank or something, because he can't  breathe our atmosphere--and that the others are a sort of robot he  sends out to do his work for him.\"    \"Nonsense!\" Ludovick was goaded to irritation at last. \"How could a  robot have that delicate play of expression, that subtle economy of  movement?\"    Corisande and the uncle exchanged glances. \"But they are absolutely  blank,\" the uncle began hesitantly. \"Perhaps, with your rich poetic  imagination....\"    \"See?\" old Osmond remarked with satisfaction. \"The kid's brain-washed.  I told you so.\"                         *      *      *      *      *    \"Even if The Belphin is a single entity,\" Ludovick went on, \"that  doesn't necessarily make him less benevolent----\"    He was again interrupted by the grandfather. \"I won't listen to any  more of this twaddle. Benevolent, bah! He or she or it or them is or  are just plain exploiting us! Taking our mineral resources away--I've  seen 'em loading ore on the spaceships--and----\"    \"--and exchanging it for other resources from the stars,\" Ludovick said  tightly, \"without which we could not have the perfectly balanced  society we have today. Without which we would be, technologically, back  in the dark ages from which they rescued us.\"    \"It's not the stuff they bring in from outside that runs this technology,\"  the uncle said. \"It's some power they've got that we can't seem to figure  out. Though Lord knows we've tried,\" he added musingly.    \"Of course they have their own source of power,\" Ludovick informed  them, smiling to himself, for his old Belphin teacher had taken great  care to instill a sense of humor into him. \"A Belphin was explaining  that to me only today.\"    Twenty heads swiveled toward him. He felt uncomfortable, for he was a  modest young man and did not like to be the cynosure of all eyes.    \"Tell us, dear boy,\" the uncle said, grabbing Ludovick's glass from the  plinth and filling it, \"what exactly did he say?\"    \"He said the Belphins rule through the power of love.\"    The glass crashed to the tesserae as the uncle uttered a very unworthy  word.    \"And I suppose it was love that killed Mieczyslaw and George when they  tried to storm the Blue Tower----\" old Osmond began, then halted at the  looks he was getting from everybody.    Ludovick could no longer pretend his neighbors were a group of eccentrics  whom he himself was eccentric enough to regard as charming.    \"So!\" He stood up and wrapped his mantle about him. \"I knew you were  against the government, and, of course, you have a legal right to disagree  with its policies, but I didn't think you were actual--actual--\" he  dredged a word up out of his schooldays--\"_anarchists_.\"    [Illustration]    He turned to the girl, who was looking thoughtful as she stroked the  glittering jewel that always hung at her neck. \"Corisande, how can you  stay with these--\" he found another word--\"these _subversives_?\"    She smiled sadly. \"Don't forget: they're my family, Ludovick, and I owe  them dutiful respect, no matter how pig-headed they are.\" She pressed  his hand. \"But don't give up hope.\"    That rang a bell inside his brain. \"I won't,\" he vowed, giving her hand  a return squeeze. \"I promise I won't.\"                         *      *      *      *      *    Outside the Flockhart villa, he paused, struggling with his inner self.  It was an unworthy thing to inform upon one's neighbors; on the other  hand, could he stand idly by and let those neighbors attempt to destroy  the social order? Deciding that the greater good was the more  important--and that, moreover, it was the only way of taking Corisande  away from all this--he went in search of a Belphin. That is, he waited  until one glided past and called to him to leave the walk.    \"I wish to report a conspiracy at No. 7 Mimosa Lane,\" he said. \"The  girl is innocent, but the others are in it to the hilt.\"    The Belphin appeared to think for a minute. Then he gave off a smile.  \"Oh, them,\" he said. \"We know. They are harmless.\"    \"Harmless!\" Ludovick repeated. \"Why, I understand they've already tried  to--to attack the Blue Tower by _force_!\"    \"Quite. And failed. For we are protected from hostile forces, as you  were told earlier, by the power of love.\"    Ludovick knew, of course, that the Belphin used the word _love_  metaphorically, that the Tower was protected by a series of highly  efficient barriers of force to repel attackers--barriers which, he  realized now, from the sad fate of Mieczyslaw and George, were  potentially lethal. However, he did not blame the Belphin for being  so cagy about his race's source of power, not with people like the  Flockharts running about subverting and whatnot.    \"You certainly do have a wonderful intercommunication system,\" he  murmured.    \"Everything about us is wonderful,\" the Belphin said noncommittally.  \"That's why we're so good to you people. Be happy!\" And he was off.    But Ludovick could not be happy. He wasn't precisely sad yet, but he  was thoughtful. Of course the Belphins knew better than he did, but  still.... Perhaps they underestimated the seriousness of the Flockhart  conspiracy. On the other hand, perhaps it was he who was taking the  Flockharts too seriously. Maybe he should investigate further before  doing anything rash.    Later that night, he slipped over to the Flockhart villa and nosed  about in the courtyard until he found the window behind which the  family was conspiring. He peered through a chink in the curtains, so  he could both see and hear.    Corisande was saying, \"And so I think there is a lot in what Ludovick  said....\"    Bless her, he thought emotionally. Even in the midst of her plotting,  she had time to spare a kind word for him. And then it hit him: _she,  too, was a plotter_.    \"You suggest that we try to turn the power of love against the Belphins?\"  the uncle asked ironically.    Corisande gave a rippling laugh as she twirled her glittering pendant.  \"In a manner of speaking,\" she said. \"I have an idea for a secret  weapon which might do the trick----\"                         *      *      *      *      *    At that moment, Ludovick stumbled over a jug which some careless  relative had apparently left lying about the courtyard. It crashed to  the tesserae, spattering Ludovick's legs and sandals with a liquid  which later proved to be extremely red wine.    \"There's someone outside!\" the uncle declared, half-rising.    \"Nonsense!\" Corisande said, putting her hand on his shoulder. \"I didn't  hear anything.\"    The uncle looked dubious, and Ludovick thought it prudent to withdraw  at this point. Besides, he had heard enough. Corisande--his Corisande--was  an integral part of the conspiracy.    He lay down to sleep that night beset by doubts. If he told the  Belphins about the conspiracy, he would be betraying Corisande. As a  matter of fact, he now remembered, he _had_ already told them about  the conspiracy and they hadn't believed him. But supposing he could  _convince_ them, how could he give Corisande up to them? True, it was  the right thing to do--but, for the first time in his life, he could  not bring himself to do what he knew to be right. He was weak, weak--and  weakness was sinful. His old Belphin teacher had taught him that, too.    As Ludovick writhed restlessly upon his bed, he became aware that  someone had come into his chamber.    \"Ludovick,\" a soft, beloved voice whispered, \"I have come to ask your  help....\" It was so dark, he could not see her; he knew where she was  only by the glitter of the jewel on her neck-chain as it arced through  the blackness.    \"Corisande....\" he breathed.    \"Ludovick....\" she sighed.    Now that the amenities were over, she resumed, \"Against my will, I have  been involved in the family plot. My uncle has invented a secret weapon  which he believes will counteract the power of the barriers.\"    \"But I thought you devised it!\"    \"So it _was_ you in the courtyard. Well, what happened was I wanted to  gain time, so I said I had a secret weapon of my own invention which I  had not perfected, but which would cost considerably less than my  uncle's model. We have to watch the budget, you know, because we can  hardly expect the Belphins to supply the components for this job.  Anyhow, I thought that, while my folks were waiting for me to finish  it, you would have a chance to warn the Belphins.\"    \"Corisande,\" he murmured, \"you are as noble and clever as you are  beautiful.\"                         *      *      *      *      *    Then he caught the full import of her remarks. \"_Me!_ But they won't  pay any attention to me!\"    \"How do you know?\" When he remained silent, she said, \"I suppose you've  already tried to warn them about us.\"    \"I--I said _you_ had nothing to do with the plot.\"    \"That was good of you.\" She continued in a warmer tone: \"How many  Belphins did you warn, then?\"    \"Just one. When you tell one something, you tell them all. You know  that. Everyone knows that.\"    \"That's just theory,\" she said. \"It's never been proven. All we do know  is that they have some sort of central clearing house of information,  presumably The Belphin of Belphins.

It was I who destroyed Ehrenberg's theory that  the _Volvox globator_ was an animal, and proved that his \"monads\" with  stomachs and eyes were merely phases of the formation of a vegetable  cell, and were, when they reached their mature state, incapable of  the act of conjugation, or any true generative act, without which no  organism rising to any stage of life higher than vegetable can be said  to be complete. It was I who resolved the singular problem of rotation  in the cells and hairs of plants into ciliary attraction, in spite of  the assertions of Wenham and others that my explanation was the result  of an optical illusion.    But notwithstanding these discoveries, laboriously and painfully made  as they were, I felt horribly dissatisfied. At every step I found  myself stopped by the imperfections of my instruments. Like all active  microscopists, I gave my imagination full play. Indeed, it is a common  complaint against many such that they supply the defects of their  instruments with the creations of their brains. I imagined depths beyond  depths in nature which the limited power of my lenses prohibited me from  exploring. I lay awake at night constructing imaginary micro-scopes  of immeasurable power, with which I seemed to pierce through all the  envelopes of matter down to its original atom. How I cursed those  imperfect mediums which necessity through ignorance compelled me to  use! How I longed to discover the secret of some perfect lens, whose  magnifying power should be limited only by the resolvability of the  object, and which at the same time should be free from spherical and  chromatic aberrations--in short, from all the obstacles over which the  poor microscopist finds himself continually stumbling! I felt convinced  that the simple microscope, composed of a single lens of such vast yet  perfect power, was possible of construction. To attempt to bring the  compound microscope up to such a pitch would have been commencing at the  wrong end; this latter being simply a partially successful endeavor  to remedy those very defects of the simplest instrument which, if  conquered, would leave nothing to be desired.    It was in this mood of mind that I became a constructive microscopist.  After another year passed in this new pursuit, experimenting on every  imaginable substance--glass, gems, flints, crystals, artificial crystals  formed of the alloy of various vitreous materials--in short, having  constructed as many varieties of lenses as Argus had eyes--I found  myself precisely where I started, with nothing gained save an extensive  knowledge of glass-making. I was almost dead with despair. My parents  were surprised at my apparent want of progress in my medical studies  (I had not attended one lecture since my arrival in the city), and the  expenses of my mad pursuit had been so great as to embarrass me very  seriously.    I was in this frame of mind one day, experimenting in my laboratory on  a small diamond--that stone, from its great refracting power, having  always occupied my attention more than any other--when a young  Frenchman who lived on the floor above me, and who was in the habit of  occasionally visiting me, entered the room.    I think that Jules Simon was a Jew. He had many traits of the Hebrew  character: a love of jewelry, of dress, and of good living. There was  something mysterious about him. He always had something to sell, and yet  went into excellent society. When I say sell, I should perhaps have said  peddle; for his operations were generally confined to the disposal of  single articles--a picture, for instance, or a rare carving in ivory, or  a pair of duelling-pistols, or the dress of a Mexican _caballero_. When  I was first furnishing my rooms, he paid me a visit, which ended in my  purchasing an antique silver lamp, which he assured me was a Cellini--it  was handsome enough even for that--and some other knick-knacks for my  sitting-room. Why Simon should pursue this petty trade I never could  imagine. He apparently had plenty of money, and had the _entree_ of the  best houses in the city--taking care, however, I suppose, to drive no  bargains within the enchanted circle of the Upper Ten. I came at length  to the conclusion that this peddling was but a mask to cover some  greater object, and even went so far as to believe my young acquaintance  to be implicated in the slave-trade. That, however, was none of my  affair.    On the present occasion, Simon entered my room in a state of  considerable excitement.    \"_Ah! mon ami!_\" he cried, before I could even offer him the ordinary  salutation, \"it has occurred to me to be the witness of the most  astonishing things in the world. I promenade myself to the house of  Madame ------. How does the little animal--_le renard_--name himself in  the Latin?\"    \"Vulpes,\" I answered.    \"Ah! yes--Vulpes. I promenade myself to the house of Madame Vulpes.\"    \"The spirit medium?\"    \"Yes, the great medium. Great heavens! what a woman! I write on a  slip of paper many of questions concerning affairs of the most  secret--affairs that conceal themselves in the abysses of my heart the  most profound; and behold, by example, what occurs? This devil of a  woman makes me replies the most truthful to all of them. She talks to me  of things that I do not love to talk of to myself. What am I to think? I  am fixed to the earth!\"    \"Am I to understand you, M. Simon, that this Mrs. Vulpes replied to  questions secretly written by you, which questions related to events  known only to yourself?\"    \"Ah! more than that, more than that,\" he answered, with an air of some  alarm. \"She related to me things--But,\" he added after a pause, and  suddenly changing his manner, \"why occupy ourselves with these follies?  It was all the biology, without doubt. It goes without saying that it  has not my credence. But why are we here, _mon ami?_ It has occurred to  me to discover the most beautiful thing as you can imagine--a vase with  green lizards on it, composed by the great Bernard Palissy. It is in my  apartment; let us mount. I go to show it to you.\"    I followed Simon mechanically; but my thoughts were far from Palissy and  his enameled ware, although I, like him, was seeking in the dark a great  discovery. This casual mention of the spiritualist, Madame Vulpes,  set me on a new track. What if, through communication with more subtle  organisms than my own, I could reach at a single bound the goal which  perhaps a life, of agonizing mental toil would never enable me to  attain?    While purchasing the Palissy vase from my friend Simon, I was mentally  arranging a visit to Madame Vulpes.          III    Two evenings after this, thanks to an arrangement by letter and the  promise of an ample fee, I found Madame Vulpes awaiting me at her  residence alone. She was a coarse-featured woman, with keen and rather  cruel dark eyes, and an exceedingly sensual expression about her mouth  and under jaw. She received me in perfect silence, in an apartment on  the ground floor, very sparsely furnished. In the centre of the room,  close to where Mrs. Vulpes sat, there was a common round mahogany table.  If I had come for the purpose of sweeping her chimney, the woman could  not have looked more indifferent to my appearance. There was no attempt  to inspire the visitor with awe. Everything bore a simple and practical  aspect. This intercourse with the spiritual world was evidently as  familiar an occupation with Mrs. Vulpes as eating her dinner or riding  in an omnibus.    \"You come for a communication, Mr. Linley?\" said the medium, in a dry,  businesslike tone of voice.    \"By appointment--yes.\"    \"What sort of communication do you want--a written one?\"    \"Yes, I wish for a written one.\"    \"From any particular spirit?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Have you ever known this spirit on this earth?\"    \"Never. He died long before I was born. I wish merely to obtain from  him some information which he ought to be able to give better than any  other.\"    \"Will you seat yourself at the table, Mr. Lin-ley,\" said the medium,  \"and place your hands upon it?\"    I obeyed, Mrs. Vulpes being seated opposite to me, with her hands also  on the table. We remained thus for about a minute and a half, when a  violent succession of raps came on the table, on the back of my chair,  on the floor immediately under my feet, and even on the window-panes.  Mrs. Vulpes smiled composedly.    \"They are very strong to-night,\" she remarked. \"You are fortunate.\" She  then continued, \"Will the spirits communicate with this gentleman?\"    Vigorous affirmative.    \"Will the particular spirit he desires to speak with communicate?\"    A very confused rapping followed this question.    \"I know what they mean,\" said Mrs. Vulpes, addressing herself to me;  \"they wish you to write down the name of the particular spirit that  you desire to converse with. Is that so?\" she added, speaking to her  invisible guests.    That it was so was evident from the numerous affirmatory responses.  While this was going on, I tore a slip from my pocket-book and scribbled  a name under the table.    \"Will this spirit communicate in writing with this gentleman?\" asked the  medium once more.    After a moment's pause, her hand seemed to be seized with a violent  tremor, shaking so forcibly that the table vibrated. She said that a  spirit had seized her hand and would write. I handed her some sheets of  paper that were on the table and a pencil. The latter she held loosely  in her hand, which presently began to move over the paper with a  singular and seemingly involuntary motion. After a few moments had  elapsed, she handed me the paper, on which I found written, in a large,  uncultivated hand, the words, \"He is not here, but has been sent "]]]
