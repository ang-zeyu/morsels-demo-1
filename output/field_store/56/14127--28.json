In the chapter on Predisposition, in the most  delightful of his works,[1] my father has drawn from his own, though his  unacknowledged feelings, immortal truths. Then commenced the age of  domestic criticism. His mother, not incapable of deep affections, but so  mortified by her social position that she lived until eighty without  indulging in a tender expression, did not recognise in her only  offspring a being qualified to control or vanquish his impending fate.  His existence only served to swell the aggregate of many humiliating  particulars. It was not to her a source of joy, or sympathy, or solace.  She foresaw for her child only a future of degradation. Having a strong,  clear mind, without any imagination, she believed that she beheld an  inevitable doom. The tart remark and the contemptuous comment on her  part, elicited, on the other, all the irritability of the poetic  idiosyncrasy. After frantic ebullitions, for which, when the  circumstances were analysed by an ordinary mind, there seemed no  sufficient cause, my grandfather always interfered to soothe with  good-tempered commonplaces, and promote peace. He was a man who thought  that the only way to make people happy was to make them a present. He  took it for granted that a boy in a passion wanted a toy or a guinea. At  a later date, when my father ran away from home, and after some  wanderings was brought back, found lying on a tombstone in Hackney  churchyard, he embraced him, and gave him a pony.    In this state of affairs, being sent to school in the neighbourhood, was  a rather agreeable incident. The school was kept by a Scotchman, one  Morison, a good man, and not untinctured with scholarship, and it is  possible that my father might have reaped some advantage from this  change; but the school was too near home, and his mother, though she  tormented his existence, was never content if he were out of her sight.  His delicate health was an excuse for converting him, after a short  interval, into a day scholar; then many days of attendance were omitted;  finally, the solitary walk home through Mr. Mellish's park was dangerous  to the sensibilities that too often exploded when they encountered on  the arrival at the domestic hearth a scene which did not harmonise with  the fairy-land of reverie.    The crisis arrived, when, after months of unusual abstraction and  irritability, my father produced a poem. For the first time, my  grandfather was seriously alarmed. The loss of one of his argosies,  uninsured, could not have filled him with more blank dismay. His idea of  a poet was formed from one of the prints of Hogarth hanging in his room,  where an unfortunate wight in a garret was inditing an ode to riches,  while dunned for his milk-score. Decisive measures were required to  eradicate this evil, and to prevent future disgrace--so, as seems the  custom when a person is in a scrape, it was resolved that my father  should be sent abroad, where a new scene and a new language might divert  his mind from the ignominious pursuit which so fatally attracted him.  The unhappy poet was consigned like a bale of goods to my grandfather's  correspondent at Amsterdam, who had instructions to place him at some  collegium of repute in that city. Here were passed some years not  without profit, though his tutor was a great impostor, very neglectful  of his pupils, and both unable and disinclined to guide them in severe  studies. This preceptor was a man of letters, though a wretched writer,  with a good library, and a spirit inflamed with all the philosophy of  the eighteenth century, then (1780-1) about to bring forth and bear its  long-matured fruits. The intelligence and disposition of my father  attracted his attention, and rather interested him. He taught his charge  little, for he was himself generally occupied in writing bad odes, but  he gave him free warren in his library, and before his pupil was  fifteen, he had read the works of Voltaire and had dipped into Bayle.  Strange that the characteristics of a writer so born and brought up  should have been so essentially English; not merely from his mastery  over our language, but from his keen and profound sympathy with all that  concerned the literary and political history of our country at its most  important epoch.    When he was eighteen, he returned to England a disciple of Rousseau. He  had exercised his imagination during the voyage in idealizing the  interview with his mother, which was to be conducted on both sides with  sublime pathos. His other parent had frequently visited him during his  absence. He was prepared to throw himself on his mother's bosom, to  bedew her hands with his tears, and to stop her own with his lips; but,  when he entered, his strange appearance, his gaunt figure, his excited  manners, his long hair, and his unfashionable costume, only filled her  with a sentiment of tender aversion; she broke into derisive laughter,  and noticing his intolerable garments, she reluctantly lent him her  cheek. Whereupon Emile, of course, went into heroics, wept, sobbed, and  finally, shut up in his chamber, composed an impassioned epistle. My  grandfather, to soothe him, dwelt on the united solicitude of his  parents for his welfare, and broke to him their intention, if it were  agreeable to him, to place him in the establishment of a great merchant  at Bordeaux. My father replied that he had written a poem of  considerable length, which he wished to publish, against Commerce, which  was the corrupter of man. In eight-and-forty hours confusion again  reigned in this household, and all from a want of psychological  perception in its master and mistress.    My father, who had lost the timidity of his childhood, who, by nature,  was very impulsive, and indeed endowed with a degree of volatility which  is only witnessed in the south of France, and which never deserted him  to his last hour, was no longer to be controlled. His conduct was  decisive. He enclosed his poem to Dr. Johnson, with an impassioned  statement of his case, complaining, which he ever did, that he had never  found a counsellor or literary friend. He left his packet himself at  Bolt Court, where he was received by Mr. Francis Barber, the doctor's  well-known black servant, and told to call again in a week. Be sure that  he was very punctual; but the packet was returned to him unopened, with  a message that the illustrious doctor was too ill to read anything. The  unhappy and obscure aspirant, who received this disheartening message,  accepted it, in his utter despondency, as a mechanical excuse. But,  alas! the cause was too true; and, a few weeks after, on that bed,  beside which the voice of Mr. Burke faltered, and the tender spirit of  Benett Langton was ever vigilant, the great soul of Johnson quitted  earth.    But the spirit of self-confidence, the resolution to struggle against  his fate, the paramount desire to find some sympathising sage--some  guide, philosopher, and friend--was so strong and rooted in my father,  that I observed, a few weeks ago, in a magazine, an original letter,  written by him about this time to Dr. Vicesimus Knox, full of high-flown  sentiments, reading indeed like a romance of Scudery, and entreating  the learned critic to receive him in his family, and give him the  advantage of his wisdom, his taste, and his erudition.    With a home that ought to have been happy, surrounded with more than  comfort, with the most good-natured father in the world, and an  agreeable man; and with a mother whose strong intellect, under ordinary  circumstances, might have been of great importance to him; my father,  though himself of a very sweet disposition, was most unhappy. His  parents looked upon him as moonstruck, while he himself, whatever his  aspirations, was conscious that he had done nothing to justify the  eccentricity of his course, or the violation of all prudential  considerations in which he daily indulged. In these perplexities, the  usual alternative was again had recourse to--absence; he was sent  abroad, to travel in France, which the peace then permitted, visit some  friends, see Paris, and then proceed to Bordeaux if he felt inclined. My  father travelled in France, and then proceeded to Paris, where he  remained till the eve of great events in that capital. This was a visit  recollected with satisfaction. He lived with learned men and moved in  vast libraries, and returned in the earlier part of 1788, with some  little knowledge of life, and with a considerable quantity of books.    At this time Peter Pindar flourished in all the wantonness of literary  riot. He was at the height of his flagrant notoriety. The novelty and  the boldness of his style carried the million with him. The most exalted  station was not exempt from his audacious criticism, and learned  institutions trembled at the sallies whose ribaldry often cloaked taste,  intelligence, and good sense. His \"Odes to the Academicians,\" which  first secured him the ear of the town, were written by one who could  himself guide the pencil with skill and feeling, and who, in the form of  a mechanic's son, had even the felicity to discover the vigorous genius  of Opie. The mock-heroic which invaded with success the sacred recesses  of the palace, and which was fruitlessly menaced by Secretaries of  State, proved a reckless intrepidity, which is apt to be popular with  \"the general.\" The powerful and the learned quailed beneath the lash  with an affected contempt which scarcely veiled their tremor. In the  meantime, as in the latter days of the Empire, the barbarian ravaged the  country, while the pale-faced patricians were inactive within the walls.  No one offered resistance.    There appeared about this time a satire \"On the Abuse of Satire.\" The  verses were polished and pointed; a happy echo of that style of Mr. Pope  which still lingered in the spell-bound ear of the public.

What might have been her future  development had she remained in this milieu?  Fate--or was it  economic necessity?--willed it otherwise.  Her parents decided to  settle in St. Petersburg, the capital of the Almighty Tsar, and there  to embark in business.  It was here that a great change took place in  the life of the young dreamer.    It was an eventful period--the year of 1882--in which Emma Goldman,  then in her 13th year, arrived in St. Petersburg.  A struggle for  life and death between the autocracy and the Russian intellectuals  swept the country.  Alexander II had fallen the previous year.  Sophia Perovskaia, Zheliabov, Grinevitzky, Rissakov, Kibalchitch,  Michailov, the heroic executors of the death sentence upon the  tyrant, had then entered the Walhalla of immortality.  Jessie  Helfman, the only regicide whose life the government had reluctantly  spared because of pregnancy, followed the unnumbered Russian martyrs  to the etapes of Siberia.  It was the most heroic period in the great  battle of emancipation, a battle for freedom such as the world had  never witnessed before.  The names of the Nihilist martyrs were on  all lips, and thousands were enthusiastic to follow their example.  The whole INTELLIGENZIA of Russia was filled with the ILLEGAL  spirit: revolutionary sentiments penetrated into every home, from  mansion to hovel, impregnating the military, the CHINOVNIKS, factory  workers, and peasants.  The atmosphere pierced the very casemates of  the royal palace.  New ideas germinated in the youth.  The difference  of sex was forgotten.  Shoulder to shoulder fought the men and the  women.  The Russian woman!  Who shall ever do justice or adequately  portray her heroism and self-sacrifice, her loyalty and devotion?  Holy, Turgeniev calls her in his great prose poem, ON THE THRESHOLD.    It was inevitable that the young dreamer from Konigsberg should be  drawn into the maelstrom.  To remain outside of the circle of free  ideas meant a life of vegetation, of death.  One need not wonder at  the youthful age.  Young enthusiasts were not then--and, fortunately,  are not now--a rare phenomenon in Russia.  The study of the Russian  language soon brought young Emma Goldman in touch with revolutionary  students and new ideas.  The place of Marlitt was taken by Nekrassov  and Tchernishevsky.  The quondam admirer of the good Queen Louise  became a glowing enthusiast of liberty, resolving, like thousands of  others, to devote her life to the emancipation of the people.    The struggle of generations now took place in the Goldman family.  The parents could not comprehend what interest their daughter could  find in the new ideas, which they themselves considered fantastic  utopias.  They strove to persuade the young girl out of these  chimeras, and daily repetition of soul-racking disputes was the  result.  Only in one member of the family did the young idealist find  understanding--in her elder sister, Helene, with whom she later  emigrated to America, and whose love and sympathy have never failed  her.  Even in the darkest hours of later persecution Emma Goldman  always found a haven of refuge in the home of this loyal sister.    Emma Goldman finally resolved to achieve her independence.  She saw  hundreds of men and women sacrificing brilliant careers to go V  NAROD, to the people.  She followed their example.  She became a  factory worker; at first employed as a corset maker, and later in the  manufacture of gloves.  She was now 17 years of age and proud to earn  her own living.  Had she remained in Russia, she would have probably  sooner or later shared the fate of thousands buried in the snows of  Siberia.  But a new chapter of life was to begin for her.  Sister  Helene decided to emigrate to America, where another sister had  already made her home.  Emma prevailed upon Helene to be allowed to  join her, and together they departed for America, filled with the  joyous hope of a great, free land, the glorious Republic.      America!  What magic word.  The yearning of the enslaved, the  promised land of the oppressed, the goal of all longing for progress.  Here man's ideals had found their fulfillment: no Tsar, no Cossack,  no CHINOVNIK.  The Republic!  Glorious synonym of equality, freedom,  brotherhood.    Thus thought the two girls as they travelled, in the year 1886, from  New York to Rochester.  Soon, all too soon, disillusionment awaited  them.  The ideal conception of America was punctured already at  Castle Garden, and soon burst like a soap bubble.  Here Emma Goldman  witnessed sights which reminded her of the terrible scenes of her  childhood in Kurland.  The brutality and humiliation the future  citizens of the great Republic were subjected to on board ship, were  repeated at Castle Garden by the officials of the democracy in a more  savage and aggravating manner.  And what bitter disappointment  followed as the young idealist began to familiarize herself with the  conditions in the new land!  Instead of one Tsar, she found scores of  them; the Cossack was replaced by the policeman with the heavy club,  and instead of the Russian CHINOVNIK there was the far more inhuman  slave-driver of the factory.    Emma Goldman soon obtained work in the clothing establishment of the  Garson Co.  The wages amounted to two and a half dollars a week.  At  that time the factories were not provided with motor power, and the  poor sewing girls had to drive the wheels by foot, from early morning  till late at night.  A terribly exhausting toil it was, without a ray  of light, the drudgery of the long day passed in complete  silence--the Russian custom of friendly conversation at work was not  permissible in the free country.  But the exploitation of the girls  was not only economic; the poor wage workers were looked upon by  their foremen and bosses as sexual commodities.  If a girl resented  the advances of her \"superiors\", she would speedily find herself on  the street as an undesirable element in the factory.  There was never  a lack of willing victims: the supply always exceeded the demand.    The horrible conditions were made still more unbearable by the  fearful dreariness of life in the small American city.  The Puritan  spirit suppresses the slightest manifestation of joy; a deadly  dullness beclouds the soul; no intellectual inspiration, no thought  exchange between congenial spirits is possible.  Emma Goldman almost  suffocated in this atmosphere.  She, above all others, longed for  ideal surroundings, for friendship and understanding, for the  companionship of kindred minds.  Mentally she still lived in Russia.  Unfamiliar with the language and life of the country, she dwelt more  in the past than in the present.  It was at this period that she met  a young man who spoke Russian.  With great joy the acquaintance was  cultivated.  At last a person with whom she could converse, one who  could help her bridge the dullness of the narrow existence.  The  friendship gradually ripened and finally culminated in marriage.    Emma Goldman, too, had to walk the sorrowful road of married life;  she, too, had to learn from bitter experience that legal statutes  signify dependence and self-effacement, especially for the woman.  The marriage was no liberation from the Puritan dreariness of  American life; indeed, it was rather aggravated by the loss of  self-ownership.  The characters of the young people differed too  widely.  A separation soon followed, and Emma Goldman went to New  Haven, Conn.  There she found employment in a factory, and her  husband disappeared from her horizon.  Two decades later she was  fated to be unexpectedly reminded of him by the Federal authorities.    The revolutionists who were active in the Russian movement of the  80's were but little familiar with the social ideas then agitating  Western Europe and America.  Their sole activity consisted in  educating the people, their final goal the destruction of the  autocracy.  Socialism and Anarchism were terms hardly known even by  name.  Emma Goldman, too, was entirely unfamiliar with the  significance of those ideals.    She arrived in America, as four years previously in Russia, at a  period of great social and political unrest.  The working people were  in revolt against the terrible labor conditions; the eight-hour  movement of the Knights of Labor was at its height, and throughout  the country echoed the din of sanguine strife between strikers and  police.  The struggle culminated in the great strike against the  Harvester Company of Chicago, the massacre of the strikers, and the  judicial murder of the labor leaders, which followed upon the  historic Haymarket bomb explosion.  The Anarchists stood the martyr  test of blood baptism.  The apologists of capitalism vainly seek to  justify the killing of Parsons, Spies, Lingg, Fischer, and Engel.  Since the publication of Governor Altgeld's reason for his liberation  of the three incarcerated Haymarket Anarchists, no doubt is left that  a fivefold legal murder had been committed in Chicago, in 1887.    Very few have grasped the significance of the Chicago martyrdom;  least of all the ruling classes.  By the destruction of a number of  labor leaders they thought to stem the tide of a world-inspiring  idea.  They failed to consider that from the blood of the martyrs  grows the new seed, and that the frightful injustice will win new  converts to the Cause.    The two most prominent representatives of the Anarchist idea in  America, Voltairine de Cleyre and Emma Goldman--the one a native  American, the other a Russian--have been converted, like numerous  others, to the ideas of Anarchism by the judicial murder.  Two women  who had not known each other before, and who had received a widely  different education, were through that murder united in one idea.    Like most working men and women of America, Emma"]]]
