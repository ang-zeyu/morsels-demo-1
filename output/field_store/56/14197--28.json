We are informed in the fourth chapter  of Genesis, that cattle were kept by the early descendants of Adam;  Jubal, the son of Lamech--who was probably born during the lifetime of  Adam--being styled the father of such as have cattle. The ox having been  preserved by Noah from the flood of waters, the original breed of our  present cattle must have been in the neighborhood of Mount Ararat. From  thence, dispersing over the face of the globe--altering by climate, by  food, and by cultivation--originated the various breeds of modern ages.    That the value of the ox tribe has been in all ages and climates highly  appreciated, we have ample evidence. The natives of Egypt, India, and  Hindostan, seem alike to have placed the cow amongst their deities; and,  judging by her usefulness to all classes, no animal could perhaps have  been selected whose value to mankind is greater. The traditions, indeed,  of every Celtic nation enroll the cow among the earliest productions,  and represent it as a kind of divinity.    In nearly all parts of the earth cattle are employed for their labor,  for their milk, and for food. In southern Africa they are as much the  associates of the Caffre as the horse is of the Arab. They share his  toils, and assist him in tending his herds. They are even trained to  battle, in which they become fierce and courageous. In central Africa  the proudest ebony beauties are to be seen upon the backs of cattle. In  all ages they have drawn the plough. In Spain they still trample out the  corn; in India they raise the water from the deepest wells to irrigate  the thirsty soil of Bengal. When Caesar invaded Britain they constituted  the chief riches of its inhabitants; and they still form no  inconsiderable item in the estimate of that country's riches.    The parent race of the ox is said to have been much larger than any of  the present varieties. The Urus, in his wild state at least, was an  enormous and fierce animal, and ancient legends have thrown around him  an air of mystery. In almost every part of the continent of Europe and  in every district of England, skulls, evidently belonging to cattle,  have been found, far exceeding in bulk any now known.    As the various breeds of cattle among us were introduced into this  country from Great Britain, we propose, before going into the details of  the leading American breeds, to glance somewhat briefly at the history  of      THE BRITISH OX.    In the earliest and most reliable accounts which we possess of the  British Isles--the Commentaries of Caesar--we learn that the ancient  Britons possessed great numbers of cattle. No satisfactory description  of these cattle occurs in any ancient author; but, with occasional  exceptions, we know that they possessed no great bulk or beauty. Caesar  tells us that the Britons neglected tillage and lived on milk and flesh;  and this account of the early inhabitants of the British Isle is  corroborated by other authors. It was such an occupation and mode of  life as suited their state of society. The island was divided into many  little sovereignties; no fixed property was secure; and that alone was  valuable which could be hurried away at the threatened approach of the  invader. Many centuries after this, when--although one sovereign seemed  to reign paramount over the whole of the kingdom--there continued to be  endless contests among the feudal barons, and therefore that property  alone continued to be valuable which could be secured within the walls  of the castle, or driven beyond the assailant's reach--an immense stock  of provisions was always stored up in the various fortresses, both for  the vassals and the cattle; or it was contrived that the latter should  be driven to the domains of some friendly baron, or concealed in some  inland recess.    When the government became more powerful and settled, and property of  every kind was assured a proportionate degree of protection, as well as  more equally divided, the plough came into use; agricultural productions  were oftener cultivated, the reaping of which was sure after the labor  of sowing. Cattle were then comparatively neglected and for some  centuries injuriously so. Their numbers diminished, and their size also  seems to have diminished; and it is only within the last century and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22775"],[0,"Psychotherapy (#2)"],[1,"that in our period one great wave of civilization is sinking and a new  wave rising, while the one has not entirely disappeared and the other is  still far from its height. The history of civilization has shown at all  times a wavelike alternation between realism and idealism, that is,  between an interest in that which is, and an interest in that which  ought to be. In the realistic periods, the study of facts, especially of  the facts of nature, is prevalent; in idealistic periods, history and  literature appeal to the world. In realistic periods, technique enjoys  its triumphs; in idealistic periods, art and religion prevail. Such a  realistic movement lies behind us. It began with the incomparable  development of physics, chemistry, and biology, in the middle of the  last century, and it brought with it the achievements of modern  engineering and medicine. We are still fully under the influence of this  gigantic movement and its real achievements will never leave us; and yet  this realistic wave is ebbing to-day and a new period of idealism is  rising. If the signs are not deceitful, this new movement may reach its  historical climax a few decades hence, when new leaders may give to the  idealistic view of the world the same classical expression which Darwin  and others gave to the receding naturalistic age. The signs are clear  indeed that the days of idealistic philosophy and of art, and of  religion, are approaching; that the world is tired of merely connecting  facts without asking what their ultimate meaning is. The world dimly  feels again that technical civilization alone cannot make life more  worth living. The aim of the last generation was to explain the world;  the aim of the next generation will be to interpret the world; the one  was seeking laws, the other will seek ideals.    Psychotherapy stands in the service of both; it is the last word of the  passing naturalistic movement, and yet in another way it tries to be the  first word of the coming idealistic movement; and because it is under  the influence of both, it speaks sometimes the language of the one, and  sometimes the language of the other. That brings about a confusion and a  disorder which must be detrimental. To transform this vagueness into  clear, distinct relations is the immediate duty of science.    Indeed it may be said that psychotherapy is the last word of a  naturalistic age, because psychotherapy finds its real stronghold in a  systematic study of the mental laws, and such study of mental laws,  psychology, must indeed be the ultimate outcome of a naturalistic view  of the world. Realism begins with the analysis of lifeless nature,  begins with the study of the stars and the stones, of masses and of  atoms. At a higher level, it turns then to the living organism, studies  plants and animals and even brings the human organism entirely under the  point of view of natural law. When science has thus mastered the whole  physical universe, it finally brings even the mental life of man under  the naturalistic point of view, treats his inner experiences like any  outer objects, tears them in pieces, analyzes them, and studies them as  functions of the nervous system. A scientific psychology is thus reached  which is the climax of realism, because it means that even the ideas and  emotions and volitions of man are treated as natural phenomena, that  their causes are sought and that their effects are determined, that  their laws are found out. To apply this realistic knowledge of the mind  in the interest of therapy is merely to use it in the same way in which  the engineer uses his knowledge of physics, when he wants to harness  outer nature. As that is possible only when theoretical science has  reached a certain height of development, it can indeed be said that  practical psychotherapy on a scientific basis can be considered almost  as the ultimate point of a realistic movement; it cannot set in until  psychology has reached high development, and psychology cannot set in  unless biology has preceded it.    There is no doubt that we are still far from this last phase of the  realistic period. The practical application of scientific psychology is  still a new problem. Experimental psychology began about twenty-five  years ago; at that time there existed one psychological laboratory.  To-day there is no university in the world which does not have a  psychological workshop. But laboratories for applied psychology are only  arising in these present days, and the systematic application of  scientific psychology to education and law and industry and social life  and medicine is almost at its beginning. While the height of the last  realistic wave was in the period of the sixties, seventies, and  eighties, of the last century, its last phase, the practical application  of physiological psychology, including psychotherapy, is only at its  commencement.    But while this last great movement has not yet reached its end, the new  idealistic movement to come has not yet reached a clear self-expression.  A general philosophical interest can be felt, but a great philosophical  synthesis seems still lacking. A new sense of duty can vaguely be felt,  but great new tasks have not yet found common acknowledgment. Above all,  the unshaped emotionalism of the masses has not yet been brought into  any real contact with the new idealism which grows up on the higher  level of scholarly thought. But it is evident, if a new great mood of  idealism is to come, one of its popular forerunners must be the demand  that the spirit is real in a higher sense than matter, that the mind  controls the body, that faith can cure. In such unphilosophic crudeness,  no definite thought is expressed, as everything would depend on the  definition of spirit, of faith, of mind, of reality. Moreover, every  inquiry would prove that the idealistic value of such statements as are  afloat among the masses to-day is reached only by a juggling with words.  That faith can cure appears to point towards the higher world, as the  word faith has there the connotation of the faith in a religious sense;  and yet the faith which really cures a digestive trouble, for instance,  is the faith in the final overcoming of the intestinal disturbance, an  idea which belongs evidently in the region of physiological psychology,  but not in the region of the church. Yet, however clumsy such statements  may be, they are surely controlled by the instinctive desire for a new  idealistic order of our life, and the time will come when their  unreasoning and unreasonable wisdom will be transformed into sound  philosophy without losing its deepest impulse. The realistic conviction  that even the mind is completely controlled by natural laws and the  idealistic inspiration that the mind of man has in its freedom mastery  over the body, are thus most curiously mixed in the popular  psychotherapy of the day, and too few recognize that the real meaning of  mind is an entirely different one in these two propositions.    Of course the one or the other of these two elements prevails in the  systematic treatises on the subject; the realistic one in those written  by the psychiatrists, the idealistic one in those written by clergymen  or Christian Scientists. The literature indeed is almost entirely  supplied from these two quarters: and yet it is evident that neither the  one nor the other party can give to the problem its most natural  setting. The student of mental diseases naturally emphasizes the  abnormal features of the situation, and thus brings the  psychotherapeutic process too much into the neighborhood of pathology.  Psychotherapy became in such hands essentially a study of hypnotism,  with especial interest in its relation to hysteria and similar diseases.  The much more essential relation of psychotherapy to the normal mental  life, the relation of suggestion and hypnotism to the normal functions  seemed too often neglected. Whoever wants to influence the mind in the  interest of the patient, must in the first place be in intimate contact  with psychology. On the other hand, the minister's spiritual interest  brings the facts nearer to religion than they really are. That a  suggestion to get rid of toothache, or to sleep the next night, is given  by a minister, does not constitute it as a religious suggestion. If the  belief in religion simply lies alongside of the belief in most trivial  effects, and both are applied in the same way for curing the sick, it is  evident that not the spiritual meaning of religion is responsible for  the cure, but the psychological process of believing. But if that is the  case, it is clear that here again the psychologist, and not the  moralist, will give the correct account of the real process involved.  In short, it is psychology, psychology in its scientific modern form,  which has to furnish the basis for a full understanding of  psychotherapy. From psychology it cannot be difficult to bridge over to  the medical interests, on the one side, to the idealistic ones on the  other side.    Our task here is, therefore, to lay a broad psychological foundation. We  must carefully inquire how the modern psychologist looks on mental life  and how the inner experiences appear from such a psychological  standpoint. The first chapters of this volume may appear like a long,  tiresome way around before we come to our goal, the study of the  psychotherapeutic agencies. And yet it is the only possible way to  overcome the superficiality with which the discussion is too often  carried on; we must understand exactly how the psychological analysis  and explanation of the scientist differ from the popular point of view.  After studying in this spirit the foundation of psychotherapy, we shall  carefully examine the practical work, its methods and its results, its  possibilities and its limitations. We shall inquire finally into the  place which it has to take, looking back upon"]]]
