Of the Nature of Flatland        I call our world Flatland, not because we call it so, but to make its  nature clearer to you, my happy readers, who are privileged to live in  Space.    Imagine a vast sheet of paper on which straight Lines, Triangles,  Squares, Pentagons, Hexagons, and other figures, instead of remaining  fixed in their places, move freely about, on or in the surface, but  without the power of rising above or sinking below it, very much like  shadows--only hard and with luminous edges--and you will then have a  pretty correct notion of my country and countrymen.  Alas, a few years  ago, I should have said \"my universe\":  but now my mind has been opened  to higher views of things.    In such a country, you will perceive at once that it is impossible that  there should be anything of what you call a \"solid\" kind; but I dare  say you will suppose that we could at least distinguish by sight the  Triangles, Squares, and other figures, moving about as I have described  them.  On the contrary, we could see nothing of the kind, not at least  so as to distinguish one figure from another.  Nothing was visible, nor  could be visible, to us, except Straight Lines; and the necessity of  this I will speedily demonstrate.    Place a penny on the middle of one of your tables in Space; and leaning  over it, look down upon it.  It will appear a circle.    But now, drawing back to the edge of the table, gradually lower your  eye (thus bringing yourself more and more into the condition of the  inhabitants of Flatland), and you will find the penny becoming more and  more oval to your view, and at last when you have placed your eye  exactly on the edge of the table (so that you are, as it were, actually  a Flatlander) the penny will then have ceased to appear oval at all,  and will have become, so far as you can see, a straight line.    The same thing would happen if you were to treat in the same way a  Triangle, or Square, or any other figure cut out of pasteboard.  As  soon as you look at it with your eye on the edge on the table, you will  find that it ceases to appear to you a figure, and that it becomes in  appearance a straight line.  Take for example an equilateral  Triangle--who represents with us a Tradesman of the respectable class.  Fig. 1 represents the Tradesman as you would see him while you were  bending over him from above; figs. 2 and 3 represent the Tradesman, as  you would see him if your eye were close to the level, or all but on  the level of the table; and if your eye were quite on the level of the  table (and that is how we see him in Flatland) you would see nothing  but a straight line.      [Illustration 1]    [ASCII approximation follows]        (1)     __________     (2)    ___________     (3)     _________            \\        /             --__ __--                 ---              \\    /                   -                \\/      When I was in Spaceland I heard that your sailors have very similar  experiences while they traverse your seas and discern some distant  island or coast lying on the horizon.  The far-off land may have bays,  forelands, angles in and out to any number and extent; yet at a  distance you see none of these (unless indeed your sun shines bright  upon them revealing the projections and retirements by means of light  and shade), nothing but a grey unbroken line upon the water.    Well, that is just what we see when one of our triangular or other  acquaintances comes toward us in Flatland.  As there is neither sun  with us, nor any light of such a kind as to make shadows, we have none  of the helps to the sight that you have in Spaceland.  If our friend  comes closer to us we see his line becomes larger; if he leaves us it  becomes smaller:  but still he looks like a straight line; be he a  Triangle, Square, Pentagon, Hexagon, Circle, what you will--a straight  Line he looks and nothing else.    You may perhaps ask how under these disadvantageous circumstances we  are able to distinguish our friends from one another: but the answer to  this very natural question will be more fitly and easily given when I  come to describe the inhabitants of Flatland.  For the present let me  defer this subject, and say a word or two about the climate and houses  in our country.          Section 2.  Of the Climate and Houses in Flatland        As with you, so also with us, there are four points of the compass  North, South, East, and West.    There being no sun nor other heavenly bodies, it is impossible for us  to determine the North in the usual way; but we have a method of our  own.  By a Law of Nature with us, there is a constant attraction to the  South; and, although in temperate climates this is very slight--so that  even a Woman in reasonable health can journey several furlongs  northward without much difficulty--yet the hampering effect of the  southward attraction is quite sufficient to serve as a compass in most  parts of our earth.  Moreover, the rain (which falls at stated  intervals) coming always from the North, is an additional assistance;  and in the towns we have the guidance of the houses, which of course  have their side-walls running for the most part North and South, so  that the roofs may keep off the rain from the North.  In the country,  where there are no houses, the trunks of the trees serve as some sort  of guide.  Altogether, we have not so much difficulty as might be  expected in determining our bearings.    Yet in our more temperate regions, in which the southward attraction is  hardly felt, walking sometimes in a perfectly desolate plain where  there have been no houses nor trees to guide me, I have been  occasionally compelled to remain stationary for hours together, waiting  till the rain came before continuing my journey.  On the weak and aged,  and especially on delicate Females, the force of attraction tells much  more heavily than on the robust of the Male Sex, so that it is a point  of breeding, if you meet a Lady in the street, always to give her the  North side of the way--by no means an easy thing to do always at short  notice when you are in rude health and in a climate where it is  difficult to tell your North from your South.    Windows there are none in our houses:  for the light comes to us alike  in our homes and out of them, by day and by night, equally at all times  and in all places, whence we know not.  It was in old days, with our  learned men, an interesting and oft-investigated question, \"What is the  origin of light?\" and the solution of it has been repeatedly attempted,  with no other result than to crowd our lunatic asylums with the  would-be solvers.  Hence, after fruitless attempts to suppress such  investigations indirectly by making them liable to a heavy tax, the  Legislature, in comparatively recent times, absolutely prohibited them.  I--alas, I alone in Flatland--know now only too well the true solution  of this mysterious problem; but my knowledge cannot be made  intelligible to a single one of my countrymen; and I am mocked at--I,  the sole possessor of the truths of Space and of the theory of the  introduction of Light from the world of three Dimensions--as if I were  the maddest of the mad!  But a truce to these painful digressions:  let  me return to our houses.    The most common form for the construction of a house is five-sided or  pentagonal, as in the annexed figure.  The two Northern sides RO, OF,  constitute the roof, and for the most part have no doors; on the East  is a small door for the Women; on the West a much larger one for the  Men; the South side or floor is usually doorless.    Square and triangular houses are not allowed, and for this reason.  The  angles of a Square (and still more those of an equilateral Triangle),  being much more pointed than those of a Pentagon, and the lines of  inanimate objects (such as houses) being dimmer than the lines of Men  and Women, it follows that there is no little danger lest the points of  a square or triangular house residence might do"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20102"],[0,"The International Monthly Magazine - Volume V - No II (#2)"],[1,"privileges,  which, it would seem, they had somewhat abused, for we find that the  sovereign seized their manors of Egham and \"Torp\" (Thorp) on account of a  servant of the abbot's having killed \"Hagh de Torp.\" Oh, rare \"old times!\"  The abbot was mulcted in a heavy fine. Then, while Bartholomew de  Winchester was abbot, from 1272 until 1307, during the reign of our first  Edward, complaints were made to Pope Gregory X. that the possessions of  the abbey were alienated to civilians and laymen, whereupon the pope  issued a bull ordering such grants to be revoked.    It is worthy of note, that the Chertsey monastery sheltered, for a time,  the remains of the pious, but unfortunate, Henry VI.      \"Poor key-cold figure of a Holy King,    Pale ashes of the house of Lancaster.\"    And the reader of Shakespeare will recall the scene in which Richard meets  the Lady Anne on her way to Chertsey with her husband's body. This poor  king's remains had a claim to be well received by the monks of Chertsey  Abbey, for he had granted to the abbot the privilege of holding a fair on  St. Anne's-hill, then called Mount Eldebury, on the feast of St. Anne's  (the 26th of July): the fair has changed its time and quarters as well as  its patron, and is held in the town on the 6th of August, and called Black  Cherry Fair. Manning, in his history of Surrey, says, that the tolls of  this fair were taken by the abbot, and are now taken by the owner of the  site of the Abbey House; thus the memory of King Henry VI. is commemorated  in the town of Chertsey to this day, by the sale of black cherries in the  harvest month of August!                        [Illustration: \"THE NUN'S WELL.\"]                                \"THE NUN'S WELL.\"      Centuries passed over those magnificent abbeys, whose ruins in many places  add so much beauty to our fertile landscapes; they grew and grew, and  added acre to acre, and stone to stone, and knowledge to knowledge; but  most they cherished the knowledge which blazed like a lamp under a bushel,  and kept all but themselves in darkness; they preached no freedom in  Christ to the Christian world, they abolished no serfdom, they taught no  liberty, they enslaved even those who in their turn enslaved their \"born  thralls,\" and saw no evil in it. Oh, rare old times! Better it is for us  that the site of Chertsey Abbey should be scarcely traceable now-a-days  than that it should be as it was, with its proud pageants and pent-up  learning!--Yet we have neither sympathy no respect for that foul king, who,  to serve his own carnal purposes, overthrew the very faith which had  hallowed his throne. But he did not attack and storm the Abbey of  Chertsey, as he did other religious houses. He came to them, this Eighth  Harry, with a fair show of kindness, saying that \"to the honor of God, and  for the health of his soul, he proposed and most nobly intended to refound  the late Monastery, Priory, or Abbey of Bisham in Berks, and to  incorporate and establish the Abbot and Convent of Chertsey, as Abbot and  Convent of Bisham, and to endow them with all the Manors late belonging to  Bisham.\" How the then Abbot John Cordrey, and his brethren, must have  shivered at the conditions; how they must have grieved at quitting their  cherished home, their stews and fish-ponds, their rich meadows of Thorpe,  overlooked by the woods of Eldebury hill, their nursing ground where their  calves and young lambs were stowed in luxurious safety in the pleasant  farm of Simple Marsh at Addlestone!    But their star was setting, and they were forced to \"give, sell, grant and  confirm, to the king their house and all manors belonging to them.\"    The total destruction of the Abbey must have amazed the whole country. An  earthquake could hardly have obliterated it more entirely. Aubrey, writing  in the year 1673, says \"of this great Abbey, scarce any thing of the old  building remains, except the out walls about it. Out of this ruin, is  built a 'fair house,' which is now in possession of Sir Nicholas Carew,  master of the Buckhounds.\" Dr. Stukeley alludes to this house, in a letter  written in 1752; he speaks of the inveterate destruction, and of \"the  gardener\" carrying him through a \"court\" where he saw the remains of the  church of the Abbey. He says the \"east end reached up to an artificial  mount along the garden wall; that mount and all the terraces of the  pleasure garden, to the back front of the house, are entirely made up of  the sacred _rudera_ or rubbish of continual devastations. Bones of abbots,  monks, and great personages, who were buried in large numbers in the  church and cloisters which lay on the south side of the church, were  spread thick all over the garden, _so that one may pick up whole handsfull  of them every where amongst the garden stuff_.\" Brayley mentions in his  pleasant History of Surrey, that this artificial mount was levelled in  1810, and its materials employed to fill up a pond. Many human skulls and  bones were found intermixed with the chalk and mortar of which it had been  formed. Fragments of old tiles were also frequently found, and are still  sometimes turned up. No trace even of the \"Abbey house\" is left; it was  purchased in 1809 by a stock-broker, who in the following year sold the  materials--and so ends the great monastic history of Chertsey. Where are  now its spiritualities in Surrey?--its temporalities in Berkshire and  Hampshire?--its revenues of Stanwell, and rents of assize?--its  spiritualities in Cardiganshire? Alas! they have left no sign, except on  the yellow parchment--of rare value to the antiquary.    Those who desire, like ourselves, to investigate what tradition has  sanctified, will do well to turn down a lane beyond Chertsey Church, which  leads directly to the Abbey bridge, and there, amid tangled hedge rows and  orchards, stands the fragment of an arch, partly built up, and so to say,  disfigured by brick-work, and an old wall, both evidently portions of the  Abbey. In the wall are a great number of what the people call \"_black  stones_,\" a geological formation, making them seem fused by fire. Layers  of tiles were also inserted in this wall, and where the cement has dropped  away they can be distinctly traced; there is also an ivy, very aged  indeed; it is so knotted and thick that it seems to grow through the  stones, the soil has so evidently encroached on the wall that it is most  probably rooted at the foundation. The pleasant market garden of Mr. Roake  covers the actual ground on which the Abbey stood. The workmen frequently  turn up broken tiles and human bones, and there is no doubt that by  digging deeper much would be discovered that might elucidate the history  of the past. At the farther end of the market garden a vault has been  discovered which is of considerable length and breadth; but the water  rises so high in it (except after a long continuance of dry weather has  sealed the land springs) that it is impossible to get to the end without  wading. An enormous quantity of richly-colored and decorated encaustic  tiles have been found here; some are preserved in our local museum. But  the most interesting remains in this place are the \"stews,\" or fish-ponds,  which run parallel to each other like the bars of a gridiron; these ponds  do not communicate one with the other, nor has the water any outlet: a  little care and attention might make them valuable for their old purposes;  but they are deplorably neglected. Occasionally you see the fin of some  huge fish, whose slow movement partakes of the character of the stagnant  water he has inhabited for years;--who can tall how many?                       [Illustration: \"THE GOLDEN GROVE.\"]                               \"THE GOLDEN GROVE.\"      \"The Abbey River,\" as it is still called, travels slowly along its way,  fertilizing the meadows and imparting life and freshness to the placid  scene. The denizens of Chertsey have planted orchards, and in a few  instances gardens on its banks. One, the garden of Mr. Herring, is a model  of neatness, almost concealed by its roses and carefully tended shrubs. We  wandered from orchard to orchard, amid the trees and over the uneven  ground; all was so still and lonely that it required the suggestions of an  active imagination to believe it had ever been the scene of contention by  flood and field. From the Abbey Bridge the richness of the meadow scenery  is exceedingly refreshing, the grass is deep and verdant, as it cannot  fail to be, lying so low, and fertilized by perpetual moisture.    During their wide-spreading magnificence, the abbots of Chertsey erected a  picturesque chapel on the lovely hill of St. Anne: this was done somewhat  about the year 1334. Orleton, Bishop of Winchester, granted an indulgence  of forty days to such persons as should repair to, and contribute to the  fabric and its ornaments.    There is nowhere a more delightful road, than that which leads from the  \"Golden Grove,\" rendered picturesque by its old tree, the plantations of  Monksgrove on one side, and those of the once residence of Charles James  Fox on the other. The road is perfectly embowered, and so close is the  foliage that you have no idea of the beautiful view which awaits you,  until leaving the statesman's house to the left, you pass through a sort  of wicket gate on the right, and follow a foot-path to where two  magnificent trees crown the hill; it is wisest to wait until passing along  the level ridge you arrive at the \"view point,\" and there, spread around  you in such a panorama as England only can show, and show against the  world for its extreme richness. On the left is Cooper's Hill, which  Denham, that high-priest of \"Local poetry,\" long ago made famous; in the  bend just where it meets the plain, you see the towers of Windsor Castle;  there is Harrow Hill, the sun shining brightly on its tall church; a deep  pall hovers over London, but you can see the dome of St. Paul'"]]]
