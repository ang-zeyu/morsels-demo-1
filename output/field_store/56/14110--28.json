His imagination is not cultivated  enough to enable him to choose, or arrange.          [5] Sir Arthur Helps. \"Animals and their Masters,\" p. 67.          [6] Ariadne Florentina, vi. 45.    4. Nor can much more be said for the observations of modern science. It  is vulgar in a far worse way, by its arrogance and materialism. In  general, the scientific natural history of a bird consists of four  articles,--first, the name and estate of the gentleman whose gamekeeper  shot the last that was seen in England; secondly, two or three stories  of doubtful origin, printed in every book on the subject of birds for  the last fifty years; thirdly, an account of the feathers, from the  comb to the rump, with enumeration of the colors which are never more  to be seen on the living bird by English eyes; and, lastly, a  discussion of the reasons why none of the twelve names which former  naturalists have given to the bird are of any further use, and why the  present author has given it a thirteenth, which is to be universally,  and to the end of time, accepted.    5. You may fancy this is caricature; but the abyss of confusion  produced by modern science in nomenclature, and the utter void of the  abyss when you plunge into it after any one useful fact, surpass all  caricature. I have in my hand thirteen plates of thirteen species of  eagles; eagles all, or hawks all, or falcons all--whichever name you  choose for the great race of the hook-headed birds of prey--some so  like that you can't tell the one from the other, at the distance at  which I show them to you, all absolutely alike in their eagle or falcon  character, having, every one, the falx for its beak, and every one,  flesh for its prey. Do you suppose the unhappy student is to be allowed  to call them all eagles, or all falcons, to begin with, as would be the  first condition of a wise nomenclature, establishing resemblance by  specific name, before marking variation by individual name? No such  luck. I hold you up the plates of the thirteen birds one by one, and  read you their names off the back:--        The first, is        an Aquila.      The second,          a Haliaetus.      The third,           a Milvus.      The fourth,          a Pandion.      The fifth,           an Astur.      The sixth,           a Falco.      The seventh,         a Pernis.      The eighth,          a Circus.      The ninth,           a Buteo.      The tenth,           an Archibuteo.      The eleventh,        an Accipiter.      The twelfth,         an Erythropus.      And the thirteenth,  a Tinnunculus.    There's a nice little lesson to entertain a parish school-boy with,  beginning his natural history of birds!    6. There are not so many varieties of robin as of hawk, but the  scientific classifiers are not to be beaten. If they cannot find a  number of similar birds to give different names to, they will give two  names to the same one. Here are two pictures of your own redbreast, out  of the two best modern works on ornithology. In one, it is called  \"Motacilla rubecula;\" in the other, \"Rubecula familiaris.\"    7. It is indeed one of the most serious, as one of the most absurd,  weaknesses, of modern naturalists to imagine that _any_ presently  invented nomenclature can stand, even were it adopted by the consent of  nations, instead of the conceit of individuals. It will take fifty  years' digestion before the recently ascertained elements of natural  science can permit the arrangement of species in any permanently (even  over a limited period) namable order; nor then, unless a great man is  born to perceive and exhibit such order. In the meantime, the simplest  and most descriptive nomenclature is the best. Every one of these  birds, for instance, might be called falco in Latin, hawk in English,  some word being added to distinguish the genus, which should describe  its principal aspect or habit. Falco montium, Mountain Hawk; Falco  silvarum, Wood Hawk; Falco procellarum, Sea Hawk; and the like. Then,  one descriptive epithet would mark species. Falco montium, aureus,  Golden Eagle; Falco silvarum, apivorus, Honey Buzzard; and so on; and  the naturalists of Vienna, Paris, and London should confirm the names  of known creatures, in conclave, once every half-century, and let them  so stand for the next fifty years.    8. In the meantime, you yourselves, or, to speak more generally, the  young rising scholars of England,--all of you who care for life as well  as literature, and for spirit,--even the poor souls of birds,--as well  as lettering of their classes in books,--you, with all care, should  cherish the old Saxon-English and Norman-French names of birds, and  ascertain them with the most affectionate research--never despising  even the rudest or most provincial forms: all of them will, some day or  other, give you clue to historical points of interest. Take, for  example, the common English name of this low-flying falcon, the most  tamable and affectionate of his tribe, and therefore, I suppose,  fastest vanishing from field and wood, the buzzard. That name comes  from the Latin \"buteo,\" still retained by the ornithologists; but, in  its original form, valueless, to you. But when you get it comfortably  corrupted into Provencal \"Busac,\" (whence gradually the French busard,  and our buzzard,) you get from it the delightful compound \"busacador,\"  \"adorer of buzzards\"--meaning, generally, a sporting person; and then  you have Dante's Bertrand de Born, the first troubadour of war, bearing  witness to you how the love of mere hunting and falconry was already,  in his day, degrading the military classes, and, so far from being a  necessary adjunct of the noble disposition of lover or soldier, was,  even to contempt, showing itself separate from both.        \"Le ric home, cassador,      M'enneion, e'l buzacador.      Parlan de volada, d'austor,      Ne jamais, d'armas, ni d'amor.\"        The rich man, the chaser,      Tires me to death; and the adorer of buzzards.      They talk of covey and hawk,      And never of arms, nor of love.    \"Cassador,\" of course, afterwards becomes \"chasseur,\" and \"austor\"  \"vautour.\" But after you have read this, and familiarized your ear with  the old word, how differently Milton's phrase will ring to you,--\"Those  who thought no better of the Living God than of a buzzard idol,\"--and  how literal it becomes, when we think of the actual difference between  a member of Parliament in Milton's time, and the Busacador of to-day;--and  all this freshness and value in the reading, observe, come of your  keeping the word which great men have used for the bird, instead of  letting the anatomists blunder out a new one from their Latin  dictionaries.    9. There are not so many namable varieties, I just now said, of robin  as of falcon; but this is somewhat inaccurately stated. Those thirteen  birds represented a very large proportion of the entire group of the  birds of prey, which in my sevenfold classification I recommended you  to call universally, \"hawks.\" The robin is only one of the far greater  multitude of small birds which live almost indiscriminately on grain or  insects, and which I recommended you to call generally \"sparrows\"; but  of the robin itself, there are two important European varieties--one  red-breasted, and the other blue-breasted.    10. You probably, some of you, never heard of the blue-breast; very  few, certainly, have seen one alive, and, if alive, certainly not wild  in England.    Here is a picture of it, daintily done,[7] and you can see the pretty  blue shield on its breast, perhaps, at this distance. Vain shield, if  ever the fair little thing is wretched enough to set foot on English  ground! I find the last that was seen was shot at Margate so long ago  as 1842,--and there seems to be no official record of any visit before  that, since Mr. Thomas Embledon shot one on Newcastle town moor in  1816. But this rarity of visit to us is strange; other birds have no  such clear objection to being shot, and really seem to come to England  expressly for the purpose. And yet this blue-bird--(one can't say \"blue  robin\"--I think we shall have to call him \"bluet,\" like the  cornflower)--stays in Sweden, where it sings so sweetly that it is  called \"a hundred tongues.\"          [7] Mr. Gould's, in his \"Birds of Great Britain.\"    11. That, then, is the utmost which the lords of land, and masters of  science, do for us in their watch upon our feathered suppliants. One  kills them, the other writes classifying epitaphs.    We have next to ask what the poets, painters, and monks have done.    The poets--among whom I affectionately and reverently class the sweet  singers of the nursery, mothers and nurses--have done much; very nearly  all that I care for your thinking of. The painters and monks, the one  being so greatly under the influence of the other, we may for the  present class together; and may almost sum their contributions to  ornithology in saying that they have plucked the wings from birds, to  make angels of men, and the claws from birds, to make devils of men.    If you were to take away from religious art these two great helps of  its--I must say, on the whole, very feeble--imagination; if you were to  take from it, I say, the power of putting wings on shoulders, and claws  on fingers and toes, how wonderfully the sphere of its angelic and  diabolic characters would be contracted! Reduced only to the sources of  expression in face or movements, you might still find in good early  sculpture very sufficient devils; but the best angels would resolve  themselves, I think, into little more than, and not often into so much  as, the likenesses of pretty women, with that grave and (I do not say  it ironically) majestic expression which they put on, when, being very  fond of their husbands and children, they seriously think either the  one or the other have misbehaved themselves.

No statutes old or new forbid it,  Although with the same mouth he did it:  Yet this beware of old and young,  What Esop meant--a _double tongue_;  Which flatters now with civil clack,  And slanders soon behind one's back.          [Illustration]    THE TRAVELLERS AND THE PURSE.      Two friends once were walking in sociable chat,    When a purse one espied on the ground;  \"Oh, see!\" said he, (thank my fortune for that,)    \"What a large sum of money I've found!\"    \"Nay, do not say _I_\" said his friend, \"for you know    'Tis but friendship to share it with me;\"  \"I share it with you,\" said the other. \"How so?    He who _found_ it the owner should be.\"    \"Be it so,\" said his friend, \"but what sound do I hear?    'Stop thief!' one is calling to you;  He comes with a constable close in the rear!\"    Said the other, \"Oh, what shall we do?\"    \"Nay, do not say _we_,\" said his friend, \"for you know    You claimed the sole right to the prize!  And since all the _money_ was taken by you,    With you the _dishonesty_ lies.\"      MORAL.    When people are selfish, dishonest, and mean,  Their nature, in dealing, will quickly be seen.          [Illustration]    THE MOUTH AND THE LIMBS.    In days of yore, they say, 'twas then    When all things spoke their mind;  The arms and legs of certain men,    To treason felt inclined.    These arms and legs together met,    As snugly as they could,  With knees and elbows, hands and feet,    In discontented mood.    Said they, \"'Tis neither right nor fair,    Nor is there any need,  To labor with such toil and care,    The greedy mouth to feed.\"    \"This we're resolved no more to do,    Though we so long have done it;\"  \"Ah!\" said the knees and elbows too,    \"And we are bent upon it.\"    \"I,\" said the tongue, \"may surely speak,    Since I his inmate am;  And for his vices while you seek,    His virtues I'll proclaim.    \"You say the mouth embezzles all,    The fruit of your exertion;  But I on this assembly call    To prove the base assertion.    \"The food which you with labor gain,    He too with labor chews;  Nor does he long the food retain,    But gives it for your use.    \"But he his office has resign'd    To whom you may prefer;  He begs you therefore now to find    Some other treasurer.\"    \"Well, be it so,\" they all replied;    \"His wish shall be obeyed;  We think the hands may now be tried    As treasurers in his stead.\"    The hands with joy to this agreed,    And all to them was paid;  But they the treasure kept indeed,    And no disbursements made.    Once more the clam'rous members met,    A lean and hungry throng;  When all allowed, from head to feet,    That what they'd done was wrong.    To take his office once again,    The mouth they all implored;  Who soon accepted it, and then    Health was again restored.      MORAL.    This tale for state affairs is meant,    Which we need not discuss;  At present we will be content,    To find a moral thus:    The mouth has claims of large amount,    From arms, legs, feet, and hands;  But let them not, on that account,   Pay _more_ than it demands.    [Illustration]          [Illustration]    THE HARE AND THE TORTOISE.      Said a hare to a tortoise, \"Good sir, what a while    You have been only crossing the way;  Why I really believe that to go half a mile,    You must travel two nights and a day.\"    \"I am very contented,\" the creature replied,    \"Though I walk but a tortoise's pace,  But if you think proper the point to decide,    We will run half a mile in a race.\"    \"Very good,\" said the hare; said the tortoise, \"Proceed,    And the fox shall decide who has won,\"  Then the hare started off with incredible speed;    But the tortoise walk'd leisurely on.    \"Come tortoise, friend tortoise, walk on,\" said the hare,    \"Well, I shall stay here for my dinner;  Why, 'twill take you a month, at that rate, to get there,    Then how can you hope to be winner?\"    But the tortoise could hear not a word that she said    For he was far distant behind;  So the hare felt secured while at leisure she fed,    And took a sound nap when she dined.    So at last this slow walker came up with the hare,    And there fast asleep did he spy her;  And he cunningly crept with such caution and care,    That she woke not, although he pass'd by her.    \"Well now,\" thought the hare, when she open'd her eyes,    \"For the race,--and I soon shall have done it;\"  But who can describe her chagrin and surprise,    When she found that the _tortoise_ had won it!      MORAL.    Thus plain plodding people, we often shall find,  Will leave hasty confident people behind.          [Illustration]    THE MILKMAID.      A milkmaid, who poized a full pail on her head,  Thus mused on her prospects in life, it is said:  \"Let's see--I should think that this milk will procure  One hundred good eggs, or fourscore to be sure.    \"Well then--stop a bit,--it must not be forgotten,  Some of these may be broken, and some may be rotten;  But if twenty for accidents should be detach'd,  It will leave me just sixty sound eggs to hatch'd.    \"Well, sixty sound eggs--no; sound chickens, I mean;  Of these some may die--we'll suppose seventeen--  Seventeen!--not so many--say ten at the most,  Which will leave fifty chickens to boil or to roast.    \"But then there's their barley; how much will they need?  Why they take but one grain at a time when they feed,  So that's a mere trifle; now then let us see,  At a fair market price, how much money there'll be?    \"Six shillings a pair--five--four--three-and-six,  To prevent all mistakes, that low price I will fix;  Now what will that make? fifty chickens, I said,  Fifty times three-and-sixpence--_I'll ask brother Ned_.    \"Oh! but stop--three-and-sixpence a _pair_ I must sell 'em;  Well, a pair is a couple--now then let us tell 'em;  A couple in fifty will go--(my poor brain!)  Why just a score times, and five pair will remain.    \"Twenty-five pair of fowls--now how shameful it is,  That I can't reckon up as much money as this!  Well, there's no use in trying; so let's give a guess;  I will say twenty pounds, and _it can't be no less_.    \"Twenty pounds, I am certain, will buy me a cow,  Thirty geese, and two turkeys--eight pigs and a sow;  Now if these turn out well, at the end of the year,  I shall fill both my pockets with guineas 'tis clear.    \"Then I'll bid that old tumble-down hovel good-bye;  My mother she'll scold, and my sisters they'll cry:  But I won't care a crow's egg for all they can say;  I sha'n't go to stop with such beggars as they!\"    But forgetting her burden, when this she had said,  The maid superciliously toss'd up her head  When alas! for her prospects--the milk pail descended!  And so all her schemes for the future were ended.      MORAL.    This moral, I think, may be safely attach'd:  Reckon not on your chickens before they are hatch'd.    [Illustration]          [Illustration]    THE LARK AND HER YOUNG ONES.      A lark who had her nest conceal'd,  Says Esop, in a barley field;  Began, as harvest time drew near,  The reaping of the corn to fear;  Afraid they would her nest descry,  Before her tender brood could fly.  She charged them therefore every day,  Before for food she flew away,  To watch the farmer in her stead,  And listen well to all he said.    It chanced one day, she scarce was gone,  Ere the farmer came and his son.  The farmer well his field survey'd,  And sundry observations made;  At last, \"I'll tell you what,\" said he,  \"This corn is fit to cut, I see;  But we our neighbor's help must borrow,  So tell them we begin to-morrow.\"    Just after this the lark returned,  When from her brood this news she learned.  \"Ah! dearest mother,\" then, said they,  \"Pray, let us all begone to-day.\"    \"My dears,\" said she, \"you need not fret,  I shall not be uneasy yet;  For if he waits for neighbor's aid,  The business long will be delay'd.\"    At dawn she left her nest once more,  And charged her young ones as before.    At five the farmer came again,  And waited for his friends in vain,  \"Well,\" said the man, \"I fancy, son,  These _friends_ we can't depend upon;  To-morrow early, mind you go,  And let our own _relations_ know.\"    Again the lark approach'd her nest,  When round her all her young ones press'd,  And told their mother, word for word,  The fresh intelligence they heard.    \"Ah, children, be at ease,\" said she  \"We're safe another day, I see;  For these _relations_, you will find,  Just like his _friends_, will stay behind.\"    At dawn again the lark withdrew,  And did again her charge renew.    Once more the farmer early came,  And found the case was just the same.  The day advanced, the sun was high;  But not a single help drew nigh.  Then said the farmer, \"Hark ye, son--  I see this job will not be done,  While thus we wait for friends and neighbors;  So you and I'll commence our labors:  To-morrow early, we'll begin  _Ourselves_, and get our harvest in.\"    \"Now,\" said the lark, when this she heard,  \"Our movement must not be deferr'd;  For if the farmer and his son  Themselves begin, 'twill soon be done.\"    The morrow proved the lark was right;  For all was cut and housed by night.      MORAL.    Hence, while we wait for other's aid,  Our business needs must be delay'd;  Which might be done with half the labor  'Twould take to go and call a neighbor.

On the oak grew an acorn or two, it is said:  On the ground grew a pumpkin as big as his head.    Thought the sage, \"What's the reason this oak is so strong  A few acorns to bear that are scarce an inch long;  While this poor feeble plant has a weight to sustain,  Which had much better hang on the tree, it is plain?\"    But just at the time the philosopher spoke  An acorn dropp'd down on his head"]]]
