J. L. Petit._ WIMBORNE MINSTER IN 1840.]          WIMBORNE MINSTER          CHAPTER I    HISTORY OF THE BUILDING      Of the churches connected with the religious houses which once existed  in the county of Dorset, three only remain to the present day. Of some  of the rest we have ruins, others have entirely disappeared. But the  town of Sherborne, once the bishop-stool of the sainted Aldhelm, who  overlooked a vast diocese comprising a great portion of the West Saxon  kingdom, has its Abbey now used as its Parish Church. The great Abbey  of Milton, founded by AEthelstan, has handed down to us its choir and  transepts--rebuilt in the fourteenth century, after the former church  had been destroyed by fire--and this, though private property, is still  used for occasional services; and the minster church at Wimborne has  became the church of the parish of Wimborne Minster.    The town has been by many supposed to stand on the site of the Roman  Vindogladia, though this station has by others been identified with  Gussage Cowdown, or the circular encampment of Badbury Rings, about  three miles to the north-west of Wimborne Minster. Be this as it may,  the district was occupied by the Roman conquerors of our island; and  Roman pottery and other remains have been found in the neighbourhood,  including a small portion of pavement beneath the floor of the minster  church.    The derivation of the name Wimborne, or Winborne as we find it sometimes  written, has been much disputed; but as we find the same word appearing  as the name of several other places which lie on the course of the same  stream, now generally called the Allen, though sometimes the Wim, it  is highly probable that the name is derived from that of the river.  Compound names for villages are very common in Dorset--the first word  being the name of the river on which the village stands, the second  being added to distinguish one village from another. Thus we find along  the Tarrant, villages known as Tarrant Gunville, Tarrant Hinton, Tarrant  Launceston, Tarrant Monkton, etc.; and along the Winterborne we find  Winterborne Houghton, Winterborne Stickland, Winterborne Clenstone,  etc.; and in like manner we meet with Monkton up Wimborne, Wimborne  Saint Giles, and Wimborne Minster along the course of the Allen. The  characteristic name of Winterborne for a brook that is such in winter  only, but is a dried-up bed in a hot summer is borne by two streams in  Dorset, each giving its name to a string of villages. May not the word  Wimborne or Winborne be a contraction for this same word Winterborne,  the \"burn\" of the rainy winter months, applied to the little stream of  the Allen, though it cannot now be said to be dry in summer?    The small town of Wimborne Minster stands not far from the junction of  the Allen with the slow-running Dorset Stour, in the midst of pleasant  fertile meadow-land, from which here and there some low hills rise. Its  chief glory has been, and probably always will be, its splendid church,  with its central Norman and its Western Perpendicular towers, its Norman  and Decorated nave, its Early English choir, and its numerous tombs and  monuments of those whose names are recorded in the history of the  country.    The exact year of the foundation of the original religious house is  differently given in various ancient documents: the dates vary from  705 A.D. to 723 A.D. At this time, Ine was king of the West Saxons;  and one of his sisters, Cudburh--or Cuthberga, as her name appears in  its Latinised form--was espoused or married to Egfred, or, as he is  often called, Osric, the Northumbrian king, but the marriage was never  consummated, and the lady as soon as possible separated from him and  retired to the convent at Barking, and afterwards founded the convent at  Wimborne. Some say that she objected to the intemperate habits of her  espoused as soon as she met him; others, that having previously vowed  herself to heaven, she persuaded him to release her from the engagement  to him, which had been arranged without her wishes being consulted.  Her sister Quinberga is stated to have been associated with her in the  foundation of the religious house, and both were buried within its  precincts, and both were afterwards canonised; Saint Cuthberga was  commemorated on August 31st \"as a virgin but not a martyr.\" A special  service appointed for the day is to be found in a Missal kept in the  Library of the Cathedral Church at Salisbury, in which the following  prayer occurs:--    \"Deus qui eximie castitatis privilegio famulam tuam Cuthbergam  multipliciter decorasti, da nobis famulis tuis ejus promerente  intercessione utriusque vitae prosperitatem. Ut sicut ejus festivitas  nobiscum agitur in terris, ita per ejus interventum nostri memoria apud  te semper habeatur in coelis, per Dominum etc.\"    There is reason to believe that the earliest date given above for the  foundation (705 A.D.) is the most probable one, as Regner in his tracts  mentions a letter bearing this date written by Saint Aldhelm, and taken  from the register of Malmesbury, in which he includes in a list of  congregations to which he grants liberty of election the monastery at  Wimborne, presided over by the sister of the king. There is also some  evidence for the existence of a community of monks at Wimborne, as well  as of nuns. But of these original religious houses not a trace remains:  the very position of St Cuthberga's Church is uncertain; we cannot  be sure that the present building occupies the same site; the last  resting-places of the two royal foundresses are not even pointed out  by tradition. Probably the buildings were destroyed, the nuns slain or  driven out, when the raiding Danes overran Wessex in the ninth century.    The next historical event that we meet with in connection with Wimborne  is the burial of King AEthelred, the brother and immediate predecessor  on the throne of the great West Saxon king AElfred. As there is doubt  about the year of the foundation by Cuthberga, so again there is a  conflict of testimony as to the date, place, and manner of the death of  AEthelred--the inscription on the brass (about which more will be said  when we come to describe the interior of the minster) not agreeing with  the usually accepted date for the accession of AElfred, 871; but as the  brass is itself many centuries later than the burial of the king whose  likeness it professes to bear, its authority may well be questioned.  Anyhow, AEthelred died either of wounds received in some battle with the  Danes, in some spot which different archaeologists have placed in Surrey,  Oxford, Berkshire, or Wilts, or worn out by his long and arduous  exertions while struggling with the heathen invaders; and his body--this  alone is certain--was brought to Wimborne for burial. It has been  conjectured that AElfred, after he had defeated the Danes and established  himself firmly on the throne of Wessex, would naturally rebuild the  ruined abbey. He founded, as we know, an abbey at Shaftesbury; he is  recorded to have built at Winchester and London; he had undoubtedly a  taste for architecture, and he was a devout son of Mother Church, so  that it is by no means improbable that he would erect a church over the  grave of his brother: but no record of such building remains, and there  is no trace of any pre-Norman work in the existing minster.    The original church and conventual buildings having been swept away by  the Danes, whether AElfred restored it or not is uncertain, but it is  certain that a house of secular canons was established at Wimborne by a  king of the name of Eadward; but again there is some uncertainty as to  whether this king was the one who is sometimes called the Eadward the  Elder, sometimes Eadward the Unconquered, son and successor of AElfred,  or Eadward the Confessor. Anyhow, it became a collegiate church and a  royal free chapel, and as such it is mentioned in Domesday Book, and it  is noticed as a Deanery in the charters of Henry III. Leland, writing in  the reign of Henry VIII., says, \"It is but of late time that a dean and  prebendaries were inducted into it.\" The deanery was in the gift of the  Crown, and we have a full list of the deans from 1224 up to 1547, when  it was dissolved. The ecclesiastical establishment consisted of a dean,  four prebendaries, three vicars, four deacons, and five singing men.  It will not be needful to give any detailed account of these, as most  of them, though in many cases they held other more dignified posts,[1]  either together with the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19529"],[0,"Nala and Damayanti and Other Poems (#2)"],[1,"steeds:      Head of all the kings of mortals--like the monarch of the gods,      Over, over all exalted[1]--in his splendour like the sun:      Holy, deep-read in the Vedas[2]--in Nishadha lord of earth;[3]      Loving dice, of truth unblemished[4]--chieftain of a mighty host.      The admired of noble women--generous, with each sense subdued.[5]      Guardian of the state; of archers--best, a present Manu[6] he.        So there dwelt in high Vidarbha[7]--Bhima, terrible in strength,[8]      With all virtues blest, but childless--long for children had he pined.      Many an holy act, on offspring[9]--still intent, had he performed.      To his court there came a Brahmin,--Damana the seer was named.      Him the child-desiring Bhima--in all duties skilled, received,      Feasted with his royal consort--in his hospitable hall.[10]      Pleased on him the grateful Daman,--and his queen a boon bestowed,      One sweet girl, the pearl of maidens--and three fair and noble sons.      Damayanti, Dama Danta--and illustrious Damana,      Richly gifted with all virtues--mighty, fearful in their might.      Damayanti with her beauty--with her brilliance, brightness, grace,      Through the worlds unrivalled glory--won the slender-waisted maid.      Her, arrived at bloom of beauty,--sate a hundred slaves around,      And a hundred virgin handmaids--as around great Indra's queen.[11]      In her court shone Bhima's daughter--decked with every ornament,      Mid her handmaids, like the lightning[12]--shone she with her faultless          form;[13]      Like the long-eyed queen of beauty--without rival, without peer.      Never mid the gods immortal--never mid the Yaksha race,[14]      Nor 'mong men was maid so lovely--ever heard of, ever seen,      As the soul-disturbing maiden--that disturbed the souls of gods.      Nala too, 'mong kings the tiger[15]--peerless among earthly men,      Like Kandarpa in his beauty[16]--like that bright-embodied God.      All around Vidarbha's princess--praised they Nala in their joy.      Ever praised they Damayanti--round Nishadha's noble king.      Hearing so each others virtues--all unseen they 'gan to love.      Thus of each, O son of Kunti,[17]--the deep silent passion grew.        Nala, in his heart impatient--longer that deep love to bear,      To the grove, in secret, wandered--by the palace' inmost court.      There the swans he saw disporting[18]--with their wings bedropped with gold:      Through the grove thus lightly moving--one of these bright birds he caught.      But the bird, in human language--thus the wondering king addressed:      \"Slay me not, O gentle monarch!--I will do thee service true;      So in Damayanti's presence--will I praise Nishadha's king,      Never after shall the maiden--think of mortal man but thee.\"        Thus addressed, at once the monarch--let the bright-winged bird depart.      Flew away the swans rejoicing--to Vidarbha straight they flew;      To Vidharba's stately city:--there by Damayanti's feet,      Down with drooping plumes they settled--and she gazed upon the flock,      Wondering at their forms so graceful--where amid her maids she sate.      Sportively began the damsels--all around to chase the birds;      Scattering flew the swans before them--all about the lovely grove.      Lightly ran the nimble maidens,--every one her bird pursued;      But the swan that through the forest--gentle Damayanti chased,      Suddenly, in human language--spake to Damayanti thus.--        \"Damayanti, in Nishadha--Nala dwells, the noble king--      Like the Aswinas in beauty,[19]--peerless among men is he.      O incomparable princess--to this hero wert thou wed,      Noble birth and perfect beauty--not unworthy fruit had borne.      Gods, Gandharvas,[20] men, the Serpents,[21]--and the Rakshasas[22] we've          seen,      All we've seen--of noble Nala--never have we seen the peer.      Pearl art thou among all women--Nala is the pride of men.      If the peerless wed the peerless--blessed must the union be.\"        When the bird thus strangely speaking--gentle Damayanti heard,      Answered thus the wondering maiden--\"Thus to Nala, speak thou too.\"      \"Be it so,\" replied the egg-born--to Vidarbha's beauteous maid.      Home then flew he to Nishadha--and to Nala told it all.          BOOK II.          Damayanti, ever after--she the swan's sweet speech had heard--      With herself she dwelt no longer--all herself with Nala dwelt.      Lost in thought she sate dejected--pale her melancholy cheek,      Damayanti sate and yielded--all her soul to sighs of grief.      Upward gazing, meditative--with a wild distracted look,      Wan was all her soft complexion--and with passion heart-possessed,[23]      Nor in sleep nor gentle converse--nor in banquets found she joy;      Night nor day she could not slumber--Woe! oh woe! she wept and said.      Her no longer her own mistress--from her looks, her gesture, knew      Damayanti's virgin handmaids--to Vidarbha's monarch they      Told how pined his gentle daughter--for the sovereign of men.      This from Damayanti's maidens--when the royal Bhima heard,      In his mind he gravely pondered--for his child what best were done.      \"Wherefore is my gentle daughter--from herself in mind estranged?\"      When the lord of earth his daughter--saw in blooming youth mature,      Knew he for the Swayembara[24]--Damayanti's time was come.      Straight the lord of many peasants[25]--summoned all the chiefs of earth,      \"Come ye to the Swayembara--all ye heroes of the world!\"      Damayanti's Swayembara--soon as heard the kings of men,      All obeyed king Bhima's summons--all to Bhima's court drew near;      Elephants, and steeds, and chariots--swarmed along the sounding land;      All with rich and various garlands[26]--with his stately army each--      All the lofty-minded rajas--Bhima with the arm of strength,      As beseemed, received with honour--on their thrones of state they sate.        At this very hour the wisest--of the sages, the divine,      Moving in their might ascended--up from earth to Indra's world.[27]      Great in holiness and wisdom--Narada and Parvata[28]      Honoured entered they the palace--of the monarch of the gods.      Them salutes the cloud-compeller[29]--of their everlasting weal,      Of their weal the worlds pervading--courteous asks the immortal lord.        NARADA _spake_.        Well it fares with us, Immortal--in our weal the world partakes--      In the world, O cloud-compeller--well it fares with all her kings.        VRIHADASVA _spake_.        He that Bali slew and Vritra--asked of Narada again--      All earth's just and righteous rulers--reckless of their lives in fight--      Who the shafts' descending death-blow--meet with unaverted eye--      Theirs this everlasting kingdom[30]--even as Kamadhuk is mine.[31]      Where are they, the Kshetriya heroes?--wherefore see I not approach      All the earth's majestic guardians--all mine ever-honoured guests.      Thus addressed by holy Sakra[32]--Narada replied and said:      \"Hear me now, O cloud-compeller--why earth's kings appear not here.      Of Vidarbha's king the daughter--Damayanti, the renowned;      Through the earth the loveliest women--in her beauty she transcends--      Soon she holds her Swayembara--soon her lord the maid will choose.      Thither all the kings are hastening--thither all the sons of kings.      Suitors for her hand the rajas--her of all the world the pearl,      O thou mighty giant slayer!--one and all approach to woo.\"        As they spake, the world-protectors[33]--with the god of fire drew near;      Of the immortals all, the highest--stood before the king of gods.      As they all stood silent hearing--Narada's majestic speech,      All exclaimed in sudden rapture--thither we likewise will go;      All the immortals on the instant,--with their chariots, with their hosts,      Hastened down towards Vidarbha--where the lords of earth were met.        Nala, too, no sooner heard he--of that concourse of the kings,      Set he forth, with soul all sanguine--full of Damayanti's love.        Saw the gods, king Nala standing--on the surface of the earth;      Standing in transcendent beauty--equal to the god of love.[34]      Him beheld the world's high guardians--in his radiance like the sun;      Each arrested stood and silent--at his peerless form amazed.      All their chariots the celestials--in the midway air have checked.      Through the blue air then descending--they Nishadha's king address.      Ho! what, ho! Nishadha's monarch--Nala, king, for truth renowned;      Do our bidding, bear our message--O, most excellent of men.          BOOK III.          Nala made his solemn promise,--\"all your bidding will I do;\"      Then with folded hands adoring--humbly of their will enquired.      \"Who are ye? to whom must Nala--as your welcome herald go?      What is my commanded service?--tell me, mighty gods, the truth.\"      Spake the sovereign of Nishadha--Indra answered thus and said:--      \"Know us, the Immortals, hither--come for Damayanti's love.      Indra I, and yon is Agni,--and the king of waters there--      Slayer he of mortal bodies,--Yama, too, is here, O king!      Thou, O Nala, of our coming,--must to Damayanti tell:      Thee to see, the world's dread guardians--Indra and the rest came down,      Indra, Agni, Varun, Yama,--each to seek thine hand are come.      One of these celestial beings,--choose, O maiden, for thy lord.\"      Nala, thus addressed by Indra--with his folded hands replied:      \"Thus with one accord commanding--on this mission send not me.      How can man, himself enamoured--for another plead his cause?      Spare me then, ye gods, in mercy--this unwelcome service, spare.\"        THE GODS _spake_.        \"I will do your bidding freely--thus thou'st said, Nishadha's king;      Wilt thou now belie thy promise?--Nala, go, nor more delay.\"      By the gods adjured so"]]]
