The very primitive type of spinning, where no spindle was used, was to  fasten the strands of goats' hair or wool to a stone which was twirled  round until the yarn was sufficiently twisted when it was wound upon  the stone and the process repeated over and over.      [Illustration: ITALIAN WOMAN SPINNING FLAX    Spindle and Distaff.    From Hull House Museum. (In This Series of Pictures the Spinners and  Weavers Are in Native Costume.)]      [Illustration: RUSSIAN SPINNING    Flax Held on Frame, Leaving Both Hands Free to Manage the Thread and  Spindle.    From Hull House Museum.]      [Sidenote: Spinning with the Spindle]    The next method of twisting yarn was with the spindle, a straight stick  eight to twelve inches long on which the thread was wound after  twisting. At first it had a cleft or split in the top in which the  thread was fixed; later a hook of bone was added to the upper end. The  spindle is yet used by the North American Indians, the Italians, and in  the Orient. The bunch of wool or flax fibers is held in the left hand;  with the right hand the fibers are drawn out several inches and the end  fastened securely in the slit or hook on the top of the spindle. A  whirling motion is given to the spindle on the thigh or any convenient  part of the body; the spindle is then dropped, twisting the yarn, which  is wound on the upper part of the spindle. Another bunch of fibers is  drawn out, the spindle is given another twirl, the yarn is wound on the  spindle, and so on.    [Sidenote: Spindle Whorl]    A spindle containing a quantity of yarn was found to rotate more easily,  steadily and continue longer than an empty one, hence the next  improvement was the addition of a _whorl_ at the bottom of the spindle.  These whorls are discs of wood, stone, clay, or metal which keep the  spindle steady and promote its rotation. The process in effect is  precisely the same as the spinning done by our grandmothers, only the  spinning wheel did the twisting and reduced the time required for the  operation.      [Illustration: SPINNING WITH CRUDE WHEEL AND DISTAFF    Distaff Thrust Into the Belt.]      [Illustration: \"GOSSIP\" IN THE OLDEN TIMES]      [Illustration: COLONIAL WOOL WHEEL    The Large Wheel Revolved by Hand Thus Turning the Spindle and Twisting  the Yarn, Which Is Then Wound on the Spindle; Intermittent in Action.]      [Illustration: COLONIAL FLAX WHEEL    Worked by a Foot Treddle; Distaff on the Frame of the Wheel; \"Fliers\" on  the Spindle, Continuous in Action; Capacity Seven Times That of Hand  Spindle.]      [Illustration: DUTCH WHEEL    Spinner Sits in Front of the Wheel Spinning Flax at Hull House.]      [Sidenote: Distaff]    Later the distaff was used for holding the bunch of wool, flax, or other  fibers. It was a short stick on one end of which was loosely wound the  raw material. The other end of the distaff was held in the hand, under  the arm or thrust in the girdle of the spinner. When held thus, one hand  was left free for drawing out the fibers.      [Illustration: Graphic Diagram Showing Time During which Different  Methods of Spinning Has Been Used.]      [Sidenote: Wheel Spinning]    On the small spinning wheel the distaff was placed in the end of the  wheel bench in front of the \"fillers\"; this left both hands free to  manage the spindle and to draw out the threads of the fibers.      [Illustration: SYRIAN SPINNING    Spinner Sits on the Floor, Wheel Turned by a Crank; Spindle Held in  Place by Two Mutton Joints Which Contain Enough Oil for Lubrication. At  Hull House.]      The flax spinning wheel, worked by means of a treadle, was invented in  the early part of the sixteenth century and was a great improvement  upon the distaff and spindle. This it will be seen was a comparatively  modern invention. The rude wheel used by the natives of Japan and India  may have been the progenitor of the European wheel, as about this time  intercourse between the East and Europe increased. These wheels were  used for spinning flax, wool, and afterwards cotton, until Hargreaves'  invention superseded it.      WEAVING    Someone has said that \"weaving is the climax of textile industry.\" It is  an art practiced by all savage tribes and doubtless was known before the  dawn of history. The art is but a development of mat-making and  basketry, using threads formed or made by spinning in place of coarser  filaments.      [Illustration: PUEBLO WOMAN WORKING HEDDLE IN WEAVING A BELT]    [Illustration: A NAVAJO BELT WEAVER]    [Illustration: ZUNI WOMAN WEAVING CEREMONIAL BELT]    [Illustration: PRIMITIVE HEDDLES]      [Sidenote: The Heddle]    In the beginning of the art the warp threads were stretched between  convenient objects on the ground or from horizontal supports. At first  the woof or filling threads were woven back and forth between the warp  threads as in darning. An improvement was the device called the \"heald\"  or \"heddle,\" by means of which alternate warp threads could be drawn  away from the others, making an opening through which the filling thread  could be passed quickly. One form of the heddle was simply a straight  stick having loops of cord or sinew through which certain of the warp  threads were run. Another form was a slotted frame having openings or  \"eyes\" in the slats. This was carved from one piece of wood or other  material or made from many. Alternate warp threads passed through the  eyes and the slots. By raising or lowering the heddle frame, an opening  was formed through which the filling thread, wound on a rude shuttle,  was thrown. The next movement of the heddle frame crossed the threads  over the filling and made a new opening for the return of the shuttle.  At first the filling thread was wound on a stick making a primitive  bobbin. Later the shuttle to hold the bobbin was devised.      [Illustration: NAVAJO LOOM    One on the Earliest Types of Looms. At Hull House.]      [Illustration: SIMPLE COLONIAL LOOM]      [Sidenote: The Reed]    Before the \"reed\" was invented, the filling threads were drawn evenly  into place by means of a rude comb and driven home by sword-shaped piece  of wood or \"batten.\" The reed accomplished all this at one time.    [Illustration: A JAPANESE LOOM.]      [Illustration: A FOUR HARNESS HAND LOOM    Weaving Linen in the Mountains of Virginia. (Photograph by C. R.  Dodge).]      [Illustration: TYPICAL COLONIAL HAND LOOM    Two Harnesses in Use; Weaving Wool at Hull House.]      [Illustration: DIAGRAM OF A HAND LOOM    _A_--Warp Beam; _B_--Cloth Beam; _DD_--Lees Rods; _H_--Harness;  _T_--Treddle.]      [Sidenote: Definition of a Loom]    It is probable that the European looms were derived from those of India  as they seem to be made on the same principle. From crude beginnings,  the hand loom of our grandmothers' time developed. A loom has been  defined as a mechanism which affects the following necessary movements:    1. The lifting of the healds to form an opening, or shed, or race for  the shuttle to pass through.    2. The throwing of the weft or filling by means of a shuttle.    3. The beating up of the weft left in the shed by the shuttle to the  cloth already formed. This thread may be adjusted by means of the  batten, needle, comb, or any separate device like the reed.    4 & 5. The winding up or taking up of the cloth as it is woven and the  letting off of the warp as the cloth is taken up.      [Illustration: SWEDISH HAND LOOM    Norwegian Woman Weaving Linen at Hull House.]      [Illustration: DIAGRAM OF THE WORKING PARTS OF A LOOM.    _S_--Shuttle for carrying the woof; _R_--Reed for beating up the woof;  _H_--Frame holding heddles, with pullies (_P_) making the harness;  _T_--Treddles for moving the harness.]      [Sidenote: Colonial Loom]    No essential changes have been made since our grandmothers made cloth a  hundred years ago. The \"harnesses\" move part of the warp now up, now  down, and the shuttle carries the weft from side to side to be driven  home by the reeds to the woven cloth. Our grandmothers did all the work  with swift movements of hands and feet. The modern weaver has her loom  harnessed to the electric dynamo and moves her fingers only to keep the  threads in order. If she wishes to weave a pattern in the cloth, no  longer does she pick up threads of warp now here, now there, according  to the designs. It is all worked out for her on the loom. Each thread  with almost human intelligence settles automatically into its appointed  place, and the weaver is only a machine tender.      [Illustration: FLY SHUTTLE HAND LOOM.    The Pulling of the Reed Automatically Throws the Shuttle Back and Forth  and Works the Harness, Making a Shed at the Proper Time.]      [Sidenote: Primitive Fabrics]    No textiles of primitive people were ever woven in \"pieces\" or \"bolts\"  of yards and yards in length to be cut into garments. The cloth was made  of the size and shape to serve the particular purpose for which it was  designed. The mat, robe, or blanket had tribal outlines and proportions  and was made according to the materials and the use of common forms that  prevailed among the tribes. The designs were always conventional and  sometimes monotonous. The decoration never interfered with its use. \"The  first beauty of the savage woman was uniformity which belonged to the  texture and shape of the product.\" The uniformity in textile, basketry,  or pottery, after acquiring a family trait, was never lost sight of.  Their designs were suggested by the natural objects with which they were  familiar.      [Illustration: PICKING COTTON.
