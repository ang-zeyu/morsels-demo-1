The  fact is, all breaches of the law of health are physical sins.    When this is generally seen, then, and perhaps not till then, will the  physical training of the young receive all the attention it deserves.    Purity of life and thought should be taught in the home. It is the only  safeguard of the young. Let parents wake up on this important subject.           *       *       *       *       *      {9}    Value of Reputation.    1. WHO SHALL ESTIMATE THE COST.--Who shall estimate the cost of a priceless  reputation--that impress which gives this human dross its currency--without  which we stand despised, debased, depreciated? Who shall repair it injured?  Who can redeem it lost? Oh, well and truly does the great philosopher of  poetry esteem the world's wealth as \"trash\" in the comparison. Without it  gold has no value; birth, no distinction; station, no dignity; beauty, no  charm; age, no reverence; without it every treasure impoverishes, every  grace deforms, every dignity degrades, and all the arts, the decorations  and accomplishments of life stand, like the beacon-blaze upon a rock,  warning the world that its approach is dangerous; that its contact is  death.    2. THE WRETCH WITHOUT IT.--The wretch without it is under eternal  quarantine; no friend to greet; no home to harbor him, the voyage of his  life becomes a joyless peril; and in the midst of all ambition can achieve,  or avarice amass, or rapacity plunder, he tosses on the surge, a buoyant  pestilence. But let me not degrade into selfishness of individual safety or  individual exposure this individual principle; it testifies a higher, a  more ennobling origin.    3. ITS DIVINITY.--Oh, Divine, oh, delightful legacy of a spotless  reputation: Rich is the inheritance it leaves; pious the example it  testifies; pure, precious and imperishable, the hope which it inspires; can  there be conceived a more atrocious injury than to filch from its possessor  this inestimable benefit to rob society of its charm, and solitude of its  solace; not only to out-law life, but attain death, converting the very  grave, the refuge of the sufferer, into the gate of infamy and of shame.    4. LOST CHARACTER.--We can conceive few crimes beyond it. He who plunders  my property takes from me that which can be repaired by time; but what  period can repair a ruined reputation? He who maims my person effects that  which medicine may remedy; but what herb has sovereignty over the wounds of  slander? He who ridicules my poverty or reproaches my profession, upbraids  me with that which industry may retrieve, and integrity may purify; but  what riches shall redeem the bankrupt fame? What power shall blanch the  sullied show of character? There can be no injury more deadly. There can be  no crime more cruel. It is without remedy. It is without antidote. It is  without evasion.           *       *       *       *       *      {11}    Influence of Associates.        If you always live with those who are lame, you will yourself learn to      limp.--FROM THE LATIN.        If men wish to be held in esteem, they must associate with those who      are estimable.--LA BRUYERE.    [Illustration: GATHERING WILD FLOWERS.]    1. BY WHAT MEN ARE KNOWN.--An author is known by his writings, a mother by  her daughter, a fool by his words, and all men by their companions.    2. FORMATION OF A GOOD CHARACTER.--Intercourse with persons of decided  virtue and excellence is of great importance in the formation of a good  character. The force of example is powerful; we are creatures of imitation,  and, by a necessary influence, our tempers and habits are very much formed  on the model of those with whom we familiarly associate. Better be alone  than in bad company. Evil communications corrupt good manners. Ill  qualities are catching as well as diseases; and the mind is at least as  much, if not a great deal more, liable to infection, than the body. Go with  mean people, and you think life is mean.    3. GOOD EXAMPLE.--How natural is it for a child to look up to those around  him for an example of imitation, and how readily does he copy all that he  sees done, good or bad. The importance of a good example on which the young  may exercise this powerful and active element of their nature, is a matter  of the utmost moment.    4. A TRUE MAXIM.--It is a trite, but true maxim, that \"a man is known by  the company he keeps.\" He naturally assimilates by the force of imitation,  to the habits and manners of those by whom he is surrounded. We know  persons who walk much with the lame, who have learned to walk with a hitch  or limp like their lame friends. Vice stalks in the streets unabashed, and  children copy it.    5. LIVE WITH THE CULPABLE.--Live with the culpable, and you will be very  likely to die with the criminal. Bad company is like a nail driven into a  post, which after the first or second blow, may be drawn out with little  difficulty; but being once driven in up to the head, the pinchers cannot  take hold to draw it out, which can only be done by the destruction of the  wood. You may be ever so pure, you cannot associate with bad companions  without falling into bad odor.    6. SOCIETY OF THE VULGAR.--Do you love the society of the vulgar? Then you  are already debased in your sentiments. Do you seek to be with the profane?  In your heart you are like them. Are jesters and buffoons your choice  friends? {12} He who loves to laugh at folly, is himself a fool. Do you  love and seek the society of the wise and good? Is this your habit? Had you  rather take the lowest seat among these than the highest seat among others?  Then you have already learned to be good. You may not make very much  progress, but even a good beginning is not to be despised.    7. SINKS OF POLLUTION.--Strive for mental excellence, and strict integrity,  and you never will be found in the sinks of pollution, and on the benches  of retailers and gamblers. Once habituate yourself to a virtuous course,  once secure a love of good society, and no punishment would be greater than  by accident to be obliged for half a day to associate with the low and  vulgar. Try to frequent the company of your betters.    8. PROCURE NO FRIEND IN HASTE.--Nor, if once secured, in haste abandon  them. Be slow in choosing an associate, and slower to change him; slight no  man for poverty, nor esteem any one for his wealth. Good friends should not  be easily forgotten, nor used as suits of apparel, which, when we have worn  them threadbare, we cast them off, and call for new. When once you profess  yourself a friend, endeavor to be always such. He can never have any true  friends that will be often changing them.    9. HAVE THE COURAGE TO CUT THE MOST AGREEABLE ACQUAINTANCE.--Do this when  you are convinced that he lacks principle; a friend should bear with a  friend's infirmities, but not with his vices. He that does a base thing in  zeal for his friend, burns the golden thread that ties their hearts  together.           *       *       *       *       *      Self-Control.        \"Honor and profit do not always lie in the same sack.\"--GEORGE HERBERT.        \"The government of one's self is the only true freedom for the      individual.\"--FREDERICK PERTHES.        \"It is length of patience, and endurance, and forebearance, that so      much of what is called good in mankind and womankind is shown.\"--ARTHUR      HELPS.           *       *       *       *       *    1. ESSENCE OF CHARACTER.--Self-control is only courage under another form.  It may also be regarded as the primary essence of character. It is in  virtue of this quality that Shakespeare defines man as a being \"looking  before and after.\" It forms the chief distinction between man and the mere  animal; and, indeed, there can be no true manhood without it.    [Illustration: THE RESULT OF BAD COMPANY.]    2. ROOT OF ALL THE VIRTUES.--Self-control is at the root {14} of all the  virtues. Let a man give the reins to his impulses and passions, and from  that moment he yields up his moral freedom. He is carried along the current  of life, and becomes the slave of his strongest desire for the time being.    3. RESIST INSTINCTIVE IMPULSE.--To be morally free--to be more than an  animal--man must be able to resist instinctive impulse, and this can only  be done by exercise of self-control. Thus it is this power which  constitutes the real distinction between a physical and a moral life, and  that forms the primary basis of individual character.    4. A STRONG MAN RULETH HIS OWN SPIRIT.--In the Bible praise is given, not  to a strong man who \"taketh a city,\" but to the stronger man who \"ruleth  his own spirit.\" This stronger man is he who, by discipline, exercises a  constant control over his thoughts, his speech, and his acts. Nine-tenths  of the vicious desires that degrade society, and which, when indulged,  swell into the crimes that disgrace it, would shrink into insignificance  before the advance of valiant self-discipline, self-respect, and  self-control. By the watchful exercise of these virtues, purity of heart  and mind become habitual, and the character is built up in chastity,  virtue, and temperance.    5. THE BEST SUPPORT.--The best support of character will always be found in  habit, which, according as the will is directed rightly or wrongly, as the  case may be, will prove either a benignant ruler, or a cruel despot. We may  be its willing subject on the one hand, or its servile slave on the other.  It may help us on the road to good, or it may hurry us on the road to ruin.    6. THE IDEAL MAN.--\"In the supremacy of self-control,\" says Herbert  Spencer, \"consists one of the perfections of the ideal man. Not to be  impulsive, not to be spurred hither and thither by each desire that in turn  comes uppermost, but to be self-restrained, self-balanc"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23624"],[0,"Ride Proud, Rebel!

Red Springs' stock right enough, of the Gray Eagle-Ariel breed, which  was Alexander Mattock's pride. Born almost black, this colt had shed his  baby fur two seasons ago for a dark iron-gray hide which would grow  lighter with the years. He had Eclipse's heritage, but he was more than  a racing machine. He was--Drew's forehead rasped against the weathered  wood of the rail--he was the kind of horse a man could dream about all  his days and perhaps find once in a lifetime, if he were lucky! Give  that colt three or four more years and there wouldn't be any horse that  could touch him. Not in Kentucky, or anywhere else!    He was circling on a leading strap now, throwing his feet in a steady,  rhythmic pattern around the hub of a Negro groom who was holding the  strap and admiring the action. Mounted on another gray--a mare with a  dainty, high-held head--was a woman, her figure trim in a habit almost  the same shade of green as the fields.    Drew pulled back. Then he smiled wryly at his instinctive retreat. His  aunt, Marianna Forbes, had abilities to be respected, but he very much  doubted if she could either sense his presence or see through the leafy  wall of his present spy hole. Yet caution dictated that he get about his  real business and inspect the fields where the horses he sought should  be grazing.    He halted several times during his perimeter march to survey the  countryside. And the bits of activity he spied upon began to puzzle him.  Aunt Marianna's supervision of the colt's schooling had been the  beginning. And he had seen her later, riding out with Rafe, the  overseer, to make the daily rounds, a duty which had never been  undertaken at Red Springs by any one other than his grandfather.    Aunt Marianna had every right to be at Red Springs. She had been born  under its roof, having left it only as a bride to live in Lexington. The  war had brought her back when her husband became an officer in the  Second Kentucky Cavalry--Union. But now--riding with Rafe, watching in  the paddock--where was Alexander Mattock?    Red Springs was his grandfather. Drew found it impossible to think of  the house and the estate without the man, though in the past two years  he had discovered very few things could be dismissed as impossible.  Curiosity made him want to investigate the present mystery. But the  memory of his last exit from that house curbed such a desire.    Drew had never been welcome there from the day of his birth within those  walls. And the motive for his final flight from there had only provided  an added aggravation for his grandfather. A staunch Union supporter  wanted no part of a stubborn-willed and defiant grandson who rode with  John Hunt Morgan. Drew clung to his somewhat black thoughts as he made  his way to the pasture. The escape he had found in the army was no  longer so complete when he skulked through these familiar fields.    But there were only two horses grazing peacefully in the field dedicated  by custom to the four- and five-year-olds, and neither was of the best  stock. One could imagine that Red Springs had already contributed to the  service.    Of course, Morgan's men were not the only riders aiming to sweep good  horseflesh out of Kentucky blue grass this season, and here the Union  cavalry would be favored.    There was a slim chance that a few horses might be in the stables. He  debated the chance of that against the risk of discovery and continued  debating it as he started back to the tree house.    Drew had known short rations and slim foraging for a long time, but the  present pinch in his middle sharpened when he sighted the big house,  with its attendant summer kitchen showing a trail of chimney smoke.    Alexander Mattock might have considered his grandson an interloper at  Red Springs; certainly the old man never concealed the state of his  feelings on that subject. But neither had he, in any way, slighted what  he deemed to be his duty toward Drew.    There had been plenty of good clothing--the right sort for a Mattock  grandson--and the usual bounteous table set by hospitable Kentucky  standards. Just as there had been education, sometimes enforced by the  use of a switch when the tutor--imported from Lexington--thought it  necessary to impress learning on a rebellious young mind by a painful  application in another portion of the body. Education, as well as a  blooded horse in the stables, and all the other prerequisites of a young  blue-grass grandee. But never any understanding, affection, or sympathy.    That cold behavior--the cutting, weighing, and judgment of every act of  childish mischief and boyish recklessness--might have crushed some into  a colorless obedience. But it had made of Drew a rebel long before he  tugged on the short gray shell jacket of a Confederate cavalryman.    Drew had forgotten the feel of linen next to his now seldom clean skin,  the set of broadcloth across the shoulders. And he depended upon the  roan's services with appreciation which had nothing to do with boasted  bloodlines, having discovered in the army that a cold-blooded horse  could keep going on rough forage when a finer bred hunter broke down.  But today the famed dinner table at Red Springs was a painful memory to  one facing only cold hoecake and stone-hard dried beef.    He had circled back to the brush screening the brook and the tree house.  Now he stood very still, his hand sliding one of the heavy Colts out of  its holster. The roan was still grazing, paying no attention to a figure  who was kneeling on the limb-supported platform and turning over the  gear Drew had left piled there.    The scout flitted about a bush, choosing a path which would bring him  out at the stranger's back. That same warm sun, now striking from a  different angle into the tree house, was bright on a thick tangle of  yellow hair, curly enough to provide its owner with a combing problem.    Drew straightened to his full height. The sense of the past which had  dogged him all day now struck like a blow. He couldn't help calling  aloud that name, even though the soberer part of his brain knew there  could be no answer.    \"Shelly!\"    The blond head turned, and blue eyes looked at him, startled, across a  bowed shoulder. Drew's puzzlement was complete. Not Sheldon, of course,  but who? The other's open surprise changed to wide-eyed recognition  first.    \"Drew!\" The hail came in the cracked voice of an adolescent as the other  jumped down to face the scout. They stood at almost eye-to-eye level,  but the stranger was still all boy, awkwardly unsure of strength or  muscle control.    \"You must be Boyd--\" Drew blinked, something in him still clinging to  the memory of Sheldon, Sheldon who had helped to build the tree house.  Why, Boyd was only a small boy, usually tagging his impatient elders,  not this tall, almost exact copy of his dead brother.    \"Sure, I'm Boyd. And it's true then, ain't it, Drew? General Morgan's  coming back here? Where?\" He glanced over his shoulder once more as if  expecting to see a troop prance up through the bushes along the stream.    Drew holstered the revolver. \"Rumors of that around?\" he asked casually.    \"Some,\" Boyd answered. \"The Yankee-lovers called out the Home Guard  yesterday. What sort of a chance do they think they'll have against  _General Morgan_?\"    Drew moved toward the roan's picket rope. As his fingers closed on that  he thought fast. Just as the Mattocks and the Forbeses were Union, the  Barretts were, or had been, Southern in sympathy. Most of Kentucky was  divided that way now. But what might have been true two years ago was  not necessarily a fact today. One took no chances.    \"You come back to see your grandfather, Drew?\"    \"Any reason why I should?\" The whole countryside must know very well  the state of affairs between Alexander Mattock and Drew Rennie.    \"Well, he's been sick for so long.... Didn't you know about that?\" Boyd  must have read Drew's answer in his face, for he spilled out the news  quickly. \"He had some kind of a fit when he heard Murray was killed----\"    Drew dropped the picket rope. \"Uncle Murray ... dead?\"    Boyd nodded. \"Killed at Murfreesboro in sixty-two, but the news didn't  come till about a week after the battle. Mr. Mattock was in town when  Judge Hagerstorm told him ... just turned red in the face and fell down  in the middle of the street. They brought him home, and sometimes he  sits outdoors. But he can't walk too good and he talks thick; you can  hardly understand him.\"    \"So that's why Aunt Marianna's in charge.\" Drew thought of Uncle Murray  swept away by time and the chances of war as so many others--and no  emotion stirred within him. Murray Mattock had firmly agreed with his  father concerning the child who was the result of a runaway match  between his sister Melanie and a despised Texan. But Uncle Murray's  death must indeed have been a paralyzing blow for the old man at Red  Springs, with all his pride and his plans for his only son.    \"Yes, Cousin Marianna runs Red Springs,\" Boyd assented, \"she and Rafe.  They sell horses to the army--the blue bellies.\" He used the term with  the concentration of one determined to say the right thing at the right  time.    Drew laughed. And with that spontaneous outburst, years fell away from  his somber face. \"I take it that you do not approve of blue bellies,  Boyd?\"    \"'Course not! Me, I'm goin' to join General Morgan now. Ain't nobody  goin' to keep me from doin' that!\" Again his voice scaled up out of  control, and he flushed.    \"You're rather young----\" Drew began, when the other interrupted him  with something close to desperation in his voice.    \"No, I ain't too young! That's all I ever hear--too young to do this,  too young to be thinkin' about things like that!"]]]
