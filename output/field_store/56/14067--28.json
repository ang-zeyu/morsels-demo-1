Old Moze was a Missouri hound that Jones had procured in that  State of uncertain qualities; and the dog had grown old over  coon-trails. He was black and white, grizzled and battlescarred; and if  ever a dog had an evil eye, Moze was that dog. He had a way of wagging  his tail--an indeterminate, equivocal sort of wag, as if he realized  his ugliness and knew he stood little chance of making friends, but was  still hopeful and willing. As for me, the first time he manifested this  evidence of a good heart under a rough coat, he won me forever.    To tell of Moze's derelictions up to that time would take more space  than would a history of the whole trip; but the enumeration of several  incidents will at once stamp him as a dog of character, and will  establish the fact that even if his progenitors had never taken any  blue ribbons, they had at least bequeathed him fighting blood. At  Flagstaff we chained him in the yard of a livery stable. Next morning  we found him hanging by his chain on the other side of an eight-foot  fence. We took him down, expecting to have the sorrowful duty of  burying him; but Moze shook himself, wagged his tail and then pitched  into the livery stable dog. As a matter of fact, fighting was his  forte. He whipped all of the dogs in Flagstaff; and when our blood  hounds came on from California, he put three of them hors de combat at  once, and subdued the pup with a savage growl. His crowning feat,  however, made even the stoical Jones open his mouth in amaze. We had  taken Moze to the El Tovar at the Grand Canyon, and finding it  impossible to get over to the north rim, we left him with one of  Jones's men, called Rust, who was working on the Canyon trail. Rust's  instructions were to bring Moze to Flagstaff in two weeks. He brought  the dog a little ahead time, and roared his appreciation of the relief  it to get the responsibility off his hands. And he related many strange  things, most striking of which was how Moze had broken his chain and  plunged into the raging Colorado River, and tried to swim it just above  the terrible Sockdolager Rapids. Rust and his fellow-workmen watched  the dog disappear in the yellow, wrestling, turbulent whirl of waters,  and had heard his knell in the booming roar of the falls. Nothing but a  fish could live in that current; nothing but a bird could scale those  perpendicular marble walls. That night, however, when the men crossed  on the tramway, Moze met them with a wag of his tail. He had crossed  the river, and he had come back!    To the four reddish-brown, high-framed bloodhounds I had given the  names of Don, Tige, Jude and Ranger; and by dint of persuasion, had  succeeded in establishing some kind of family relation between them and  Moze. This night I tied up the bloodhounds, after bathing and salving  their sore feet; and I left Moze free, for he grew fretful and surly  under restraint.    The Mormons, prone, dark, blanketed figures, lay on the sand. Jones was  crawling into his bed. I walked a little way from the dying fire, and  faced the north, where the desert stretched, mysterious and  illimitable. How solemn and still it was! I drew in a great breath of  the cold air, and thrilled with a nameless sensation. Something was  there, away to the northward; it called to me from out of the dark and  gloom; I was going to meet it.    I lay down to sleep with the great blue expanse open to my eyes. The  stars were very large, and wonderfully bright, yet they seemed so much  farther off than I had ever seen them. The wind softly sifted the sand.  I hearkened to the tinkle of the cowbells on the hobbled horses. The  last thing I remembered was old Moze creeping close to my side, seeking  the warmth of my body.    When I awakened, a long, pale line showed out of the dun-colored clouds  in the east. It slowly lengthened, and tinged to red. Then the morning  broke, and the slopes of snow on the San Francisco peaks behind us  glowed a delicate pink. The Mormons were up and doing with the dawn.  They were stalwart men, rather silent, and all workers. It was  interesting to see them pack for the day's journey. They traveled with  wagons and mules, in the most primitive way, which Jones assured me was  exactly as their fathers had crossed the plains fifty years before, on  the trail to Utah.    All morning we made good time, and as we descended into the desert, the  air became warmer, the scrubby cedar growth began to fail, and the  bunches of sage were few and far between. I turned often to gaze back  at the San Francisco peaks. The snowcapped tips glistened and grew  higher, and stood out in startling relief. Some one said they could be  seen two hundred miles across the desert, and were a landmark and a  fascination to all travelers thitherward.    I never raised my eyes to the north that I did not draw my breath  quickly and grow chill with awe and bewilderment with the marvel of the  desert. The scaly red ground descended gradually; bare red knolls, like  waves, rolled away northward; black buttes reared their flat heads;  long ranges of sand flowed between them like streams, and all sloped  away to merge into gray, shadowy obscurity, into wild and desolate,  dreamy and misty nothingness.    \"Do you see those white sand dunes there, more to the left?\" asked  Emmett. \"The Little Colorado runs in there. How far does it look to  you?\"    \"Thirty miles, perhaps,\" I replied, adding ten miles to my estimate.    \"It's seventy-five. We'll get there day after to-morrow. If the snow in  the mountains has begun to melt, we'll have a time getting across.\"    That afternoon, a hot wind blew in my face, carrying fine sand that cut  and blinded. It filled my throat, sending me to the water cask till I  was ashamed. When I fell into my bed at night, I never turned. The next  day was hotter; the wind blew harder; the sand stung sharper.    About noon the following day, the horses whinnied, and the mules roused  out of their tardy gait. \"They smell water,\" said Emmett. And despite  the heat, and the sand in my nostrils, I smelled it, too. The dogs,  poor foot-sore fellows, trotted on ahead down the trail. A few more  miles of hot sand and gravel and red stone brought us around a low mesa  to the Little Colorado.    It was a wide stream of swiftly running, reddish-muddy water. In the  channel, cut by floods, little streams trickled and meandered in all  directions. The main part of the river ran in close to the bank we were  on. The dogs lolled in the water; the horses and mules tried to run in,  but were restrained; the men drank, and bathed their faces. According  to my Flagstaff adviser, this was one of the two drinks I would get on  the desert, so I availed myself heartily of the opportunity. The water  was full of sand, but cold and gratefully thirst-quenching.    The Little Colorado seemed no more to me than a shallow creek; I heard  nothing sullen or menacing in its musical flow.    \"Doesn't look bad, eh?\" queried Emmett, who read my thought. \"You'd be  surprised to learn how many men and Indians, horses, sheep and wagons  are buried under that quicksand.\"    The secret was out, and I wondered no more. At once the stream and wet  bars of sand took on a different color. I removed my boots, and waded  out to a little bar. The sand seemed quite firm, but water oozed out  around my feet; and when I stepped, the whole bar shook like jelly. I  pushed my foot through the crust, and the cold, wet sand took hold, and  tried to suck me down.    \"How can you ford this stream with horses?\" I asked Emmett.    \"We must take our chances,\" replied he. \"We'll hitch two teams to one  wagon, and run the horses. I've forded here at worse stages than this.  Once a team got stuck, and I had to leave it; another time the water  was high, and washed me downstream.\"    Emmett sent his son into the stream on a mule. The rider lashed his  mount, and plunging, splashing, crossed at a pace near a gallop. He  returned in the same manner, and reported one bad place near the other  side.    Jones and I got on the first wagon and tried to coax up the dogs, but  they would not come. Emmett had to lash the four horses to start them;  and other Mormons riding alongside, yelled at them, and used their  whips. The wagon bowled into the water with a tremendous splash. We  were wet through before we had gone twenty feet. The plunging horses  were lost in yellow spray; the stream rushed through the wheels; the  Mormons yelled. I wanted to see, but was lost in a veil of yellow mist.  Jones yelled in my ear, but I could not hear what he said. Once the  wagon wheels struck a stone or log, almost lurching us overboard. A  muddy splash blinded me. I cried out in my excitement, and punched  Jones in the back. Next moment, the keen exhilaration of the ride gave  way to horror. We seemed to drag, and almost stop. Some one roared:  \"Horse down!\" One instant of painful suspense, in which imagination  pictured another tragedy added to the record of this deceitful river--a  moment filled with intense feeling, and sensation of splash, and yell,  and fury of action; then the three able horses dragged their comrade  out of the quicksand. He regained his feet, and plunged on. Spurred by  fear, the horses increased their efforts, and amid clouds of spray,  galloped the remaining distance to the other side.    Jones looked disgusted. Like all plainsmen, he hated water. Emmett and  his men calmly unhitched. No trace of alarm, or even of excitement  showed in their bronzed faces.    \"We made that fine and easy,\" remarked Emmett.    So I sat down and wondered what Jones and Emmett, and these men would  consider really hazardous. I began to have a feeling that I would find  out; that experience for me was but in its infancy; that far across the  desert the something which had called me would show hard, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20571"],[0,"Woman's Work in Music (#2)"],[1," less important position than of old. \"When the ancient sages made our  musical system,\" says an eminent Brahmin in an interview at San  Francisco, \"there were many women among them; but now not one can  accomplish anything in the art.\"    In the traditions of ancient Egypt, music is entirely under the  patronage of male gods. Thoth, the Egyptian Hermes, invented the lyre by  striking the tendons of a dead tortoise, which had dried and stretched  in the shell. Osiris, too, the chief of the Egyptian gods, protected the  art, although Strabo says music was not allowed in his temple at  Abydos. While travelling in Ethiopia, the story runs, Osiris met a  troupe of revelling satyrs, and, being fond of singing, he admitted them  to his train of musicians. In their midst were nine young maidens,  skilled in music and various sciences, evidently the prototype of the  Grecian Muses. Horus, the son of Osiris (equivalent to the Greek Apollo)  was considered the god of Harmony.    An important mythical character was Maneros, son of the earliest  Egyptian king. He seems to hold the same position as Linus, son of  Apollo, among the Greeks. The first song of Egyptian music was a dirge  for his untimely end, and a lament for the swift passing away of youth,  spring, joy, and so on. Gradually the song itself, instead of the king's  son, began to be called Maneros, and became the well-known banquet song  of the social feasts, calling upon the guests to enjoy life while they  might. In time the song became a symbol of gaiety and merriment instead  of grief.    In most of the ancient civilizations, the songs appear to have been  accompanied by clapping of hands, to mark the rhythm. There were many  actual dances, also, in ancient Egypt, as is fully proven by a number of  the old paintings. Some were like our jigs, break-downs, or clog-dances,  while others consisted of regular figures, such as forward and back,  swing, and so on, the latter kind being restricted to the lower orders.  In all of these, women must have taken a large part, and doubtless they  were responsible for some of the music. They were not allowed to play  the flute, but could indulge in the tabor and other instruments. Some of  the scenes depicted closely resemble the modern stage, and it is more  than probable that, when the audiences of to-day applaud our own ballet  scenes, they are enjoying themselves in the old Egyptian manner.    There can be no doubt that woman played an important part in music,  possibly even in composition, in many civilizations which apparently  allowed her only a restricted field of action. The Empress of Germany  recently defined woman's sphere as consisting of four  subjects,--children, clothes, cooking, and church; yet the German women  have far more influence than this official utterance would indicate. It  is not surprising, then, to find in the folios of Lepsius a reproduction  of something analogous to our conservatories of music. It represents a  course of musical instruction in the school of singers and players of  King Amenhotep IV., of the eighteenth dynasty. There are several large  and small rooms, connected with each other, and containing furniture and  musical instruments. In some are the musicians practising and teaching.  One teacher sits listening to the singing of a young girl, while another  pupil is playing the accompaniment on a harp. Still another girl stands  attentively listening to the teacher's instructions, as in a modern  class. In another place are two girls practising a dance with harp  music. In one room is a young lady having her hair dressed, while in  another a young girl has placed aside her harp and is sitting down to  lunch with a companion. All this goes to show that different  civilizations often resemble one another more than would appear at first  sight, and very probably woman's part in ancient Egyptian music was much  like that which she plays in our own to-day.    The earliest Hebrew music was undoubtedly modelled after that of Egypt.  In later Biblical times, however, there were many national instruments,  and the style of the music must have been characteristic. The Old  Testament, even in its earlier books, contains many examples of the  songs of the people. Their ancient folk-music showed three principal  styles,--the joyous bridal song, the cheerful harvest or vintage song,  and the wailing funeral song; and there are many examples of each in the  Scriptures. As there was no definite notation among the ancient Hebrews,  the actual tunes that were sung with these songs will never be known.  But it may be possible that the melodies have been preserved by rote,  for it is certain that these three schools of singing exist to-day in  Arabia and Syria. Whole villages are known to unite in a seven-day  festival of rejoicing, not unlike the one at the wedding of Samson, as  described in the fourteenth chapter of Judges.    The Song of Solomon presents an entire set of bridal songs in the  popular vein. A good example of the mourning song is found in the  opening chapter of the second book of Samuel, where David laments the  death of Saul and Jonathan. It is somewhat exceptional because of its  being rendered by a man, for in Eastern countries the professional  mourners were always women, hired for the occasion. The men might join  in the chorus of woe if they wished, but the main part of the song was  always given by the women, who were not unlike the \"Keeners,\" heard in  Ireland on similar occasions, even down to recent times. The book of  Lamentations presents a series of funeral songs, written in imitation of  the professional lays of grief, and containing many allusions to the  mourning women. In the fifth chapter of Amos, in Habakkuk, and many  other books, are further illustrations of such folk-songs. The fifth  chapter of Isaiah begins with the cheerful style of the vintage song,  and then suddenly changes to a song of grief, forming an artistic  contrast that must have been highly effective.    In the Hebrew songs, as in the Egyptian, there must have been much  dramatic action united with the vocal work. When the word \"dancing\"  occurs, it generally means only gesture and pantomime. Its use is made  evident in the song of Moses, in Exodus XV. It requires little  imagination to picture Miriam using a folk-song with which her hearers  were familiar, improvising words to suit the occasion, and illustrating  the whole with successive gestures of pride, contempt, sarcasm, and  triumph, while the assembled multitude joined in the chorus at every  opportunity.    Still more evident does this union of voice and action become in the  song of Deborah and Barak, in Judges V. A possible description of the  performance of this musical comedy is given by Herder, who suggests that  \"Probably verses 1-11 were interrupted by the shouts of the populace;  verses 12-27 were a picture of the battle, with a naming of the leaders  with praise or blame, and mimicking each one as named; verses 28-30 were  mockery of the triumph of Sisera, and the last verse was given as a  chorus by the whole people.\" According to this, the tune must certainly  have been a familiar one. The whole scene, with its extemporized words,  its clapping of hands to mark the rhythm, and its alternation of solo  and chorus, was probably not unlike the singing at some of the negro  camp-meetings on the Southern plantations.    Foremost among the patrons of the art in Grecian mythology are the  Muses. These were not always nine in number. Originally, at Mount  Helicon, in B[oe]otia, three were worshipped,--Melete (meditation),  Mneme (memory), and Aoide (song). Three Muses were also recognized at  Delphi and Sicyon. Four are mentioned as daughters of Jupiter and  Plusia, while some accounts speak of seven Muses, daughters of Pierus.  Eight was the number known in Athens, until finally the Thracian worship  of nine spread over the whole of Greece. The parentage of these  divinities is given with as many variations as their number. Most  commonly they were considered daughters of Zeus and Mnemosyne (memory),  born in Pieria at the foot of Mount Olympus. Some call them daughters of  Uranus and Gaea, others of Pierus and Antiope, still others of Apollo or  of Jupiter and Minerva. The analogy between the Muses and the nine  maidens in the Egyptian troupe of Osiris has already been noted.    In Homer's poems, the Muses have already attained their well-known abode  on Olympus, where they sing the festive songs at the banquets of the  immortals. They were supposed to inspire the mind of the bards, and in  early times the poets were perfectly sincere in invoking them and  believing in their inspiration. The Muses, in presiding over the various  branches of Grecian art, appeared unable to brook any rivalry. Thamyris,  an ancient Thracian bard, boldly challenged them to a trial of skill,  and, on being overcome by them in the contest, was deprived by them of  his sight and of the power of singing. He is represented in art as  holding a broken lyre. The nine daughters of King Pierus of Macedonia  fared no better, and after an unsuccessful contest were changed into  birds. The Muses were closely connected with Apollo, who was looked upon  as their leader. Many mountains, as well as grottos, wells, and springs  in various parts of Greece, were sacred to them.    The Sirens were another personification of the marvellous power of music  among primitive peoples. Their parentage also is variously given, though  they are usually mentioned as daughters of the river god, Achelous. They  are generally represented as maidens, with a more or less extensive  equipment of wings and other plumage. These wings were obtained at their  request when Proserpine was carried off, that they might be better able  to hunt for her. But another account says that they refused their  sympathy to Ceres, and were given their feathery coating by her in  punishment. Some writers "]]]
