These dimples  were rather misleading, for they gave strangers the impression that  Lilias was humorous, which was entirely a mistake: it was Dulcie who was  the humorist in reality, Dulcie whose long lashes dropped over her shy  eyes, and who never could say a word for herself in public, though in  the society of intimate friends she could be amusing enough. Dulcie, at  fourteen, seemed years younger than Lilias; she did not wish to grow up  too soon, and thankfully tipped all responsibilities on to her elder  sister. Cousin Clare always said there were undiscovered depths in  Dulcie's character, but they were slow in development, and at present  she was a childish little person with a pink baby face, an affection for  fairy tales, and even a sneaking weakness for her discarded dolls. Life,  that to Lilias seemed a serious business, was a joyous venture to  Dulcie; she had a happy knack of shaking off the unpleasant things, and  throwing the utmost possible power of enjoyment into the nice ones. If  innocent happiness is the birthright of childhood, she clung to it  steadfastly, and had not yet exchanged it for the red pottage of worldly  wisdom.    Ever since Father and Mother, in the great disaster of the wreck of the  _Titanic_, had gone down together into the gray waters of the Atlantic,  the Ingleton children had lived with their grandfather, Mr. Leslie  Ingleton, at Cheverley Chase. There were six of them, Everard, Lilias,  Dulcie, Roland, Bevis, and Clifford, and as time passed on, and the  memory of that tragedy in mid-ocean grew faint, the Chase seemed as  entirely their home as if they had been born there. In Everard's  opinion, at any rate, it belonged to them, as it had always belonged to  the prospective heirs of the Ingleton family. And that family could  trace back through many centuries to days of civil wars and service for  king and country, to crusades and deeds of chivalry, and even to  far-away ancestors who gave counsel at Saxon Witenagemots. Norman keep  had succeeded wooden manor, and that in its turn had given place to a  Tudor dwelling, and both had finally merged into a long Georgian  mansion, with straight rows of windows and a classic porch, not so  picturesque as the older buildings, but very convenient and comfortable  from a modern point of view. The lovely gardens, with their clipped yew  hedges, were one of the sights of the neighborhood, and it was a family  satisfaction that the view from the terrace over park, wood, and stream  showed not a single acre of land that was not their own.    Mr. Leslie Ingleton, a fine type of the old-fashioned, kindly, but  autocratic English squire, belonged to a bygone generation, and found it  difficult to move with the march of the times. Because he had spent his  seventy-four years of life on the soil of Cheverley, the people  tolerated in \"the ould squire\" many things that they would not have  passed over in a younger man or a stranger. They shrugged their  shoulders and gave way to his well-meant tyranny, for man and boy,  everybody on the estate had experienced his kindness and realized his  good intentions towards his tenants.    \"If he does fly off at a tangent, ten to one Miss Clare'll be down the  next day and set all straight again,\" was the general verdict on his  frequent outbursts.    Cheverley Chase would have been quite incomplete without Cousin Clare.  She was a second cousin of the Ingletons, who had come to tend  Grandmother in her last illness, and after her death had remained to  take charge of the household and the newly-arrived family of  grandchildren. She was one of those calm, quiet, big-souled women who in  the early centuries would have been a saint, and in mediaeval times the  abbess of a nunnery, but happening to be born in the nineteenth century,  her mental outlook had a modern bias, and both her philanthropy and her  religious instincts had developed along the latest lines of thought. She  had schemes of her own for work in the world, but at present she was  doing the task that was nearest in helping to bring up the motherless  children who had been placed temporarily in her care. To manage this  rather turbulent crew, soothe the irascible old Squire, and keep the  general household in unity was a task that required unusual powers of  tact, and a capacity for administration and organization that was worthy  of a wider sphere. She might be described as the axle of the family  wheel, for she was the unobtrusive center around which everything  unconsciously revolved.    But by this time Lilias and Dulcie will have ridden up hill and down  dale, and will be turning Rajah and Peri in at the great wrought-iron  gates of Cheverley Chase, and trotting through the park, and up the  laurel-bordered carriage drive to the house. There was quite a big  welcome for them when they arrived. Everard had returned the day before  from Harrow, Roland was back from his preparatory school, and the two  little ones, Bevis and Clifford, had just said good-by for three weeks  to their nursery governess, and in consequence were in the wildest of  holiday spirits. There was a general family pilgrimage round the  premises to look at all the most cherished treasures, the horses, the  pigeons, the pet rabbits, the new puppies, the garden, and the woods  beyond the park; there were talks with the grooms and the keepers, and  plans for cutting evergreens and decorating both the house and the  village church in orthodox Christmas fashion.    \"It's lovely to be at home again,\" sighed Lilias with satisfaction, as  the three elder ones sauntered back through the winding paths of the  terraced vegetable garden.    \"And such a home, too!\" exulted Dulcie.    \"Rather!\" agreed Everard. \"That was exactly what was in my mind. The  first thing I thought when I looked out of the window this morning was:  'What a ripping place it is, and some day it will be all mine.'\"    \"Yours, Everard?\"    \"Why, of course. Who's else should it be? The Chase has always gone  strictly in the male line, and I'm the oldest grandson, so naturally I'm  the heir. It goes without saying!\"    Dulcie's pink face was looking puzzled.    \"Do you mean to say if Grandfather were to die, that everything would be  yours?\" she asked. \"Would you be the Squire?\"    \"I believe I'm called 'the young squire' already,\" replied Everard  airily.    \"But what about the rest of us?\" objected Dulcie.    \"Oh, I'd look after you, of course! The heir always does something for  the younger ones. You needn't be afraid on that score!\"    Everard's tone was magnanimous and patronizing in the extreme. He was  gazing at the house with an air of evident proprietorship. Dulcie, who  had never considered the question before, revolved it carefully in her  youthful brain for a moment or two; then she ventured a comment.    \"Wouldn't it be fairer to divide it?\"    \"Nonsense, Dulcie!\" put in Lilias. \"You don't understand. Properties  like this are never divided. They always go, just as they are, to the  eldest son. You couldn't chop them up into pieces, or there'd be no  estate left.\"    \"Couldn't one have the house and the other the wood, and another the  park?\"    \"Much good the house would do anybody without the estate to keep it up!\"  grunted Everard. \"Dulcie, you're an utter baby. I don't believe you ever  see farther than the end of your silly little nose. You may be glad  you've got a brother to take care of you.\"    \"But haven't I as much right here as you?\" persisted Dulcie obstinately.    \"No, you haven't; the heir always has the best right to everything.  Cheer up! When the place is mine, I mean to have a ripping time here!  I'll make things hum, I can tell you--ask my friends down, and you girls  shall help to entertain. I've planned it all out. I suppose I shall have  to go to Cambridge first, but I'll enjoy myself there too--you bet! On  the whole I think I was born under a lucky star! Hallo! there goes  Astley; I want to speak to him.\"    Everard whistled to the groom, and ran down the garden, leaving his  sisters to return to the house. At seventeen he was a fair, handsome,  dashing sort of boy, of a type more common thirty years ago than at  present. He held closely to the old-fashioned ideas of privileges of  birth, and, according to modern notions, had contracted some false  ideals of life. He had lounged through school without attempting to  work, and was depending for all his future upon what should be left him  by the industry of others. All the same, in spite of his attitude of  \"top dog\" in the family, he was attractive, and inclined to be generous.  Like most boys of seventeen, he had reached the \"swollen head\" stage,  and imagined himself of vastly greater importance than he really was.  The sobriquet of \"the young squire\" pleased his fancy, and he meant to  live up to what he considered were the traditions of so distinguished a  title.          CHAPTER II    A Stolen Joy-ride      Christmas passed over at Cheverley Chase in good old-fashioned orthodox  mode. The young Ingletons, with plenty of evergreens to work upon,  performed prodigies in the way of decorations at church and home. They  distributed presents at a Christmas-tree for the children of tenants,  and turned up in a body to occupy the front seats at the annual New  Year's concert in the village. When the usual festivities were finished,  however, time hung a little heavy on their hands, and one particular  morning found them lounging about the breakfast-room in the especially  aggravating situation of not quite knowing what to do with themselves.    \"It's too bad we can't have the horses to-day!\" groused Dulcie. \"I'd set  my heart on a ride, and I can't get on with my fancy work till I can go  to Balderton for some more silks.\"    \"And I want some wool,\" proclaimed Lilias, stopping from a rather  unnecessary onslaught of poking at the fire. \"There's never anything  fit to buy"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21677"],[0,"Milton (#2)"],[1," language of love  rather than of philosophy. I know that in Shakespeare, or in Milton, or  in any rare nature, as in Faire Virtue, the mistress of Philarete--      There is some concealed thing    So each gazer limiting,    He can see no more of merit    Than beseems his worth and spirit.    The appreciation of a great author asks knowledge and industry before it  may be attempted, but in the end it is the critic, not the author, who is  judged by it, and, where his sympathies have been too narrow, or his  sight too dim, condemned without reprieve, and buried without a  tombstone.    Imperfect sympathy, that eternal vice of criticism, is sometimes  irremediable, sometimes caused by imperfect knowledge. It takes forms as  various as the authors whom it misjudges. In the case of Shakespeare,  when we attempt to estimate him, to gauge him, to see him from all sides,  we become almost painfully conscious of his immensity. We can build no  watch-tower high enough to give us a bird's-eye view of that \"globe of  miraculous continents.\" We are out of breath when we attempt to accompany  him on his excursions, where he,              through strait, rough, dense, or rare,    With head, hands, wings, or feet pursues his way,    And swims, or sinks, or wades, or creeps, or flies.    He moves so easily and so familiarly among human passions and human  emotions, is so completely at home in all societies and all companies,  that he makes us feel hide-bound, prejudiced and ill-bred, by the side of  him. We have to widen our conception of human nature in order to think of  him as a man. How hard a thing it is to conceive of Shakespeare as of a  human spirit, embodied and conditioned, whose affections, though higher  mounted than ours, yet, when they stooped, stooped with the like wing, is  witnessed by all biographies of Shakespeare, and by many thousands of the  volumes of criticism and commentary that have been written on his works.  One writer is content to botanise with him--to study plant-lore, that is,  with a theatrical manager, in his hard-earned leisure, for teacher.  Another must needs read the Bible with him, although, when all is said,  Shakespeare's study was but little on the Bible. Others elect to keep him  to music, astronomy, law, hunting, hawking, fishing. He is a good  companion out of doors, and some would fain keep him there, to make a  country gentleman of him. His incorrigible preoccupation with humanity,  the ruling passion and employment of his life, is beyond the range of  their complete sympathy; they like to catch him out of hours, to draw him  aside and bespeak his interest, for a few careless minutes, in the trades  and pastimes that bulk so largely and so seriously in their own  perspective of life. They hardly know what to make of his \"unvalued  book\"; but they know that he was a great man, and to have bought a  wool-fell or a quarter of mutton from him, that would have been  something! Only the poet-critics attempt to see life, however brokenly,  through Shakespeare's eyes, to let their enjoyment keep attendance upon  his. And from their grasp, too, he escapes by sheer excess.    In the case of Milton the imperfection of our sympathy is due to other  causes. In the first place, we know him as we do not know Shakespeare.  The history of his life can be, and has been, minutely written. The  affairs of his time, political and religious, have been recorded with  enormous wealth of detail; and this wealth, falling into fit hands, has  given us those learned modern historians to whom the seventeenth century  means a period of five thousand two hundred and eighteen weeks. Milton's  own attitude towards these affairs is in no way obscure; he has explained  it with great fulness and candour in numerous publications, so that it  would be easy to draw up a declaration of his chief tenets in politics  and religion. The slanders of his adversaries he met again and again with  lofty passages of self-revelation. \"With me it fares now,\" he remarks in  one of these, \"as with him whose outward garment hath been injured and  ill-bedighted; for having no other shift, what help but to turn the  inside outwards, especially if the lining be of the same, or, as it is  sometimes, much better.\" In his poetry, too, he delights to reveal  himself, to take the knowing reader into his confidence, to honour the  fit audience with a confession.    But the difficulty is there none the less. Few critics have found Milton  too wide or too large for them; many have found him too narrow, which is  another form of imperfect sympathy. His lack of humour has alienated the  interest of thousands. His ardent advocacy of toleration in the noblest  of his prose treatises has been belittled by a generation which prides  itself on that flaccid form of benevolence, and finds the mere repeal of  the Licensing Act the smallest part of it. His pamphlets on divorce and  on government have earned him the reputation of a theorist and dreamer.  The shrewd practical man finds it easy to despise him. The genial  tolerant man, whose geniality of demeanour towards others is a kind of  quit-rent paid for his own moral laxity, regards him as a Pharisee. The  ready humourist devises a pleasant and cheap entertainment by dressing  Adam and Eve in modern garments and discussing their relations in the  jargon of modish frivolity. Even the personal history of the poet has  been made to contribute to the gaiety of nations, and the flight of Mary  Powell, the first Mrs. Milton, from the house in Aldersgate Street, has  become something of a stock comic episode in the history of English  literature. So heavy is the tax paid, even by a poet, for deficiency in  breadth and humour. Almost all men are less humorous than Shakespeare;  but most men are more humorous than Milton, and these, it is to be  feared, having suffered themselves to be dragooned by the critics into  professing a distant admiration for _Paradise Lost_, have paid their last  and utmost tribute to the genius of its author.    It may be admitted without hesitation that his lonely greatness rather  forces admiration on us than attracts us. That unrelenting intensity;  that lucidity, as clear as air and as hard as agate; that passion which  burns with a consuming heat or with a blinding light in all his writings,  have endeared him to none. It is impossible to take one's ease with  Milton, to induce him to forget his principles for a moment in the name  of social pleasure. The most genial of his personal sonnets is addressed  to Henry Lawrence, the son of the President of Cromwell's Council, and is  an invitation to dinner. The repast promised is \"light and choice\"; the  guest is apostrophised, somewhat formidably, as \"Lawrence, of virtuous  father, virtuous son,\" and is reminded, before he has dined, that      He who of these delights can judge, and spare    To interpose them oft, is not unwise.    But the qualities that make Milton a poor boon-companion are precisely  those which combine to raise his style to an unexampled loftiness, a  dignity that bears itself easily in society greater than human. To attain  to this height it was needful that there should be no aimless expatiation  of the intellect, no facile diffusion of the sympathies over the wide  field of human activity and human character. All the strength of mind and  heart and will that was in Milton went into the process of raising  himself. He is like some giant palm-tree; the foliage that sprang from it  as it grew has long since withered, the stem rises gaunt and bare; but  high up above, outlined against the sky, is a crown of perennial verdure.    It is essential for the understanding of Milton that we should take  account of the rare simplicity of his character. No subtleties; no tricks  of the dramatic intellect, which dresses itself in a hundred masquerading  costumes and peeps out of a thousand spy-holes; no development, one might  almost say, only training, and that self-imposed. There is but one  Milton, and he is throughout one and the same, in his life, in his prose,  and in his verse; from those early days, when we find him, an uncouth  swain,      With eager thought warbling his Doric lay,    to the last days when, amid a swarm of disasters, he approved himself  like Samson, and earned for himself the loftiest epitaph in the language,  his own--      Nothing is here for tears, nothing to wail    Or knock the breast; no weakness, no contempt,    Dispraise, or blame; nothing but well and fair,    And what may quiet us in a death so noble.    The world has not wholly misunderstood or failed to appreciate this  extraordinary character, as one curious piece of evidence will serve to  show. Milton is one of the most egotistic of poets. He makes no secret of  the high value he sets upon his gifts--\"gifts of God's imparting,\" as he  calls them, \"which I boast not, but thankfully acknowledge, and fear also  lest at my certain account they be reckoned to me many rather than few.\"  Before he has so much as begun his great poem he covenants with his  reader \"that for some few years yet I may go on trust with him toward the  payment of what I am now indebted, as being a work not to be raised from  the heat of youth or the vapours of wine; ... nor to be obtained by the  invocation of dame Memory and her siren daughters, but by devout prayer  to that eternal Spirit, who can enrich with all utterance and knowledge,  and sends out his seraphim, with the hallowed fire of his altar, to touch  and purify the lips of whom he pleases; to this must be added industrious  and select reading, steady observation, insight into all seemly and  generous arts and affairs; till which in some measure be compassed, at  mine own peril and cost, I refuse not to sustain this expectation from as  many as are not loth to hazard so much credulity upon the best pledges  that I can give them.\" And when he came to redeem his pledge, in the very  opening lines"]]]
