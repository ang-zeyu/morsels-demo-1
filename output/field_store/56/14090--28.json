These more limited studies are called the  _natural sciences_.    Since the study of nature is divided in this way for mere convenience,  and not because there is any division in nature itself, it often happens  that the different sciences are very intimately related, and a thorough  knowledge of any one of them involves a considerable acquaintance with  several others. Thus the botanist must know something about animals as  well as about plants; the student of human physiology must know  something about physics as well as about the parts of the body.    ~Intimate relation of chemistry and physics.~ Physics and chemistry are  two sciences related in this close way, and it is not easy to make a  precise distinction between them. In a general way it may be said that  they are both concerned with inanimate matter rather than with living,  and more particularly with the changes which such matter may be made to  undergo. These changes must be considered more closely before a  definition of the two sciences can be given.    ~Physical changes.~ One class of changes is not accompanied by an  alteration in the composition of matter. When a lump of coal is broken  the pieces do not differ from the original lump save in size. A rod of  iron may be broken into pieces; it may be magnetized; it may be heated  until it glows; it may be melted. In none of these changes has the  composition of the iron been affected. The pieces of iron, the  magnetized iron, the glowing iron, the melted iron, are just as truly  iron as was the original rod. Sugar may be dissolved in water, but  neither the sugar nor the water is changed in composition. The resulting  liquid has the sweet taste of sugar; moreover the water may be  evaporated by heating and the sugar recovered unchanged. Such changes  are called _physical changes_.    DEFINITION: _Physical changes are those which do not involve a change in  the composition of the matter._    ~Chemical changes.~ Matter may undergo other changes in which its  composition is altered. When a lump of coal is burned ashes and  invisible gases are formed which are entirely different in composition  and properties from the original coal. A rod of iron when exposed to  moist air is gradually changed into rust, which is entirely different  from the original iron. When sugar is heated a black substance is formed  which is neither sweet nor soluble in water. Such changes are evidently  quite different from the physical changes just described, for in them  new substances are formed in place of the ones undergoing change.  Changes of this kind are called _chemical changes_.    DEFINITION: _Chemical changes are those which involve a change in the  composition of the matter._    ~How to distinguish between physical and chemical changes.~ It is not  always easy to tell to which class a given change belongs, and many  cases will require careful thought on the part of the student. The test  question in all cases is, Has the composition of the substance been  changed? Usually this can be answered by a study of the properties of  the substance before and after the change, since a change in composition  is attended by a change in properties. In some cases, however, only a  trained observer can decide the question.    ~Changes in physical state.~ One class of physical changes should be noted  with especial care, since it is likely to prove misleading. It is a  familiar fact that ice is changed into water, and water into steam, by  heating. Here we have three different substances,--the solid ice, the  liquid water, and the gaseous steam,--the properties of which differ  widely. The chemist can readily show, however, that these three bodies  have exactly the same composition, being composed of the same substances  in the same proportion. Hence the change from one of these substances  into another is a physical change. Many other substances may, under  suitable conditions, be changed from solids into liquids, or from  liquids into gases, without change in composition. Thus butter and wax  will melt when heated; alcohol and gasoline will evaporate when exposed  to the air. _The three states--solid, liquid, and gas--are called the  three physical states of matter._    ~Physical and chemical properties.~ Many properties of a substance can be  noted without causing the substance to undergo chemical change, and are  therefore called its _physical properties_. Among these are its physical  state, color, odor, taste, size, shape, weight. Other properties are  only discovered when the substance undergoes chemical change. These are  called its _chemical properties_. Thus we find that coal burns in air,  gunpowder explodes when ignited, milk sours when exposed to air.    ~Definition of physics and chemistry.~ It is now possible to make a  general distinction between physics and chemistry.    DEFINITION: _Physics is the science which deals with those changes in  matter which do not involve a change in composition._    DEFINITION: _Chemistry is the science which deals with those changes in  matter which do involve a change in composition._    ~Two factors in all changes.~ In all the changes which matter can undergo,  whether physical or chemical, two factors must be taken into account,  namely, _energy_ and _matter_.    ~Energy.~ It is a familiar fact that certain bodies have the power to do  work. Thus water falling from a height upon a water wheel turns the  wheel and in this way does the work of the mills. Magnetized iron  attracts iron to itself and the motion of the iron as it moves towards  the magnet can be made to do work. When coal is burned it causes the  engine to move and transports the loaded cars from place to place. When  a body has this power to do work it is said to possess energy.    ~Law of conservation of energy.~ Careful experiments have shown that when  one body parts with its energy the energy is not destroyed but is  transferred to another body or system of bodies. Just as energy cannot  be destroyed, neither can it be created. If one body gains a certain  amount of energy, some other body has lost an equivalent amount. These  facts are summed up in the law of conservation of energy which may be  stated thus: _While energy can be changed from one form into another, it  cannot be created or destroyed._    ~Transformations of energy.~ Although energy can neither be created nor  destroyed, it is evident that it may assume many different forms. Thus  the falling water may turn the electric generator and produce a current  of electricity. The energy lost by the falling water is thus transformed  into the energy of the electric current. This in turn may be changed  into the energy of motion, as when the current is used for propelling  the cars, or into the energy of heat and light, as when it is used for  heating and lighting the cars. Again, the energy of coal may be  converted into energy of heat and subsequently of motion, as when it is  used as a fuel in steam engines.    Since the energy possessed by coal only becomes available when the coal  is made to undergo a chemical change, it is sometimes called _chemical  energy_. It is this form of energy in which we are especially interested  in the study of chemistry.    ~Matter.~ Matter may be defined as that which occupies space and possesses  weight. Like energy, matter may be changed oftentimes from one form into  another; and since in these transformations all the other physical  properties of a substance save weight are likely to change, the inquiry  arises, Does the weight also change? Much careful experimenting has  shown that it does not. The weight of the products formed in any change  in matter always equals the weight of the substances undergoing change.    ~Law of conservation of matter.~ The important truth just stated is  frequently referred to as the law of conservation of matter, and this  law may be briefly stated thus: _Matter can neither be created nor  destroyed, though it can be changed from one form into another._    ~Classification of matter.~ At first sight there appears to be no limit to  the varieties of matter of which the world is made. For convenience in  study we may classify all these varieties under three heads, namely,  _mechanical mixtures_, _chemical compounds_, and _elements_.    [Illustration: Fig. 1]    ~Mechanical mixtures.~ If equal bulks of common salt and iron filings are  thoroughly mixed together, a product is obtained which, judging by its  appearance, is a new substance. If it is examined more closely, however,  it will be seen to be merely a mixture of the salt and iron, each of  which substances retains its own peculiar properties. The mixture tastes  just like salt; the iron particles can be seen and their gritty  character detected. A magnet rubbed in the mixture draws out the iron  just as if the salt were not there. On the other hand, the salt can be  separated from the iron quite easily. Thus, if several grams of the  mixture are placed in a test tube, and the tube half filled with water  and thoroughly shaken, the salt dissolves in the water. The iron  particles can then be filtered from the liquid by pouring the entire  mixture upon a piece of filter paper folded so as to fit into the  interior of a funnel (Fig. 1). The paper retains the solid but allows  the clear liquid, known as the _filtrate_, to drain through. The iron  particles left upon the filter paper will be found to be identical with  the original iron. The salt can be recovered from the filtrate by  evaporation of the water. To accomplish this the filtrate is poured into  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20851"],[0,"Character Sketches of Romance, Fiction and the Drama, Vol. 3 (#2)"],[1,"the master of the mansion sitting at a good fire. Oliver told him  he desired to pass the night there, and ordered him to bring in supper.  \"Sir Ralph\" knowing his customer, humored the joke, which Oliver did not  discover till next day, when he called for his bill. (We are told in  _Notes and Queries_ that Ralph Fetherstone was only _Mr._, but his  grandson was _Sir Thomas_).      =Marmaduke Wharne.= Eccentric old Englishman long resident in America.  Benevolent and beneficent, but gruff in manner and speech.--A. D. T.  Whitney, _Leslie Goldthwaite's Summer_ (1866).      =Marmaduke= (_Sir_). A man who has lost all earth can give--wealth, love,  fame and friends, but thus comforts himself:       \"I account it worth      All pangs of fair hopes crossed,--      All loves and honors lost,--      To gain the heavens, at cost      Of losing earth.\"        Theodore Tilton, _Sir Marmaduke's Musings_ (1867).      =Marmion.= Lord Marmion was betrothed to Constance de Beverley, but he  jilted her for Lady Clare, an heiress, who was in love with Ralph de  Wilton. The Lady Clare rejected Lord Marmion's suit, and took refuge  from him in the convent of St. Hilda, in Whitby. Constance took the veil  in the convent of St. Cuthbert, in Holy Isle, but after a time left the  convent clandestinely, was captured, taken back, and buried alive in the  walls of a deep cell. In the mean time, Lord Marmion, being sent by  Henry VIII. on an embassy to James IV. of Scotland, stopped at the hall  of Sir Hugh de Heron, who sent a palmer as his guide. On his return,  Lord Marmion commanded the abbess of St. Hilda to release the Lady  Clare, and place her under the charge of her kinsman, Fitzclare of  Tantallon Hall. Here she met the palmer, who was Ralph de Wilton, and as  Lord Marmion was slain in the battle of Flodden Field, she was free to  marry the man she loved.--Sir W. Scott, _Marmion_ (1808).    _Marmion_ (_Lord_), a descendant of Robert de Marmion, who obtained from  William the Conqueror, the manor of Scrivelby, in Lincolnshire. This  Robert de Marmion was the first royal champion of England, and the  office remained in the family till the reign of Edward I., when in  default of male issue it passed to John Dymoke, son-in-law of Philip  Marmion, in whose family it remains still.      =Marnally= (_Bernard_). Good-looking Irish tutor at \"Happy-go-Lucky,\" a  country house. He is accused of murdering the infant children of a young  widow with whom he is in love, but is acquitted and goes back to  Ireland. Some years later, he revisits America, meets his old love and  marries her.--Miriam Coles Harris, _Happy-go-Lucky_ (1881).      =Marner= (_Silas_). Miser and misogynist in humble life, who finds a  baby-girl in his cottage one night, and in bringing her up, learns to  have patience with life and charity with his kind.--George Eliot, _Silas  Marner_.      =Ma'ro=, Virgil, whose full name was Publius Virgilius Maro (B.C. 70-19).        Oh, were it mine with the sacred Maro's art      To wake to sympathy the feeling heart,      Like him the smooth and mournful verse to dress      In all the pomp of exquisite distress ...      Then might I ...        Falconer, _The Shipwreck_, iii. 5 (1756).      =Mar'onites= (3 _syl._), a religious semi-Catholic sect of Syria,  constantly at war with their near neighbors, the Druses, a  semi-Mohammedan sect. Both are now tributaries of the sultan, but enjoy  their own laws. The Maronites number about 400,000, and the Druses about  half that number. The Maronites owe their name to J. Maron, their  founder; the Druses to Durzi, who led them out of Egypt into Syria. The  patriarch of the Maronites resides at Kanobin; the hakem of the Druses  at Deir-el-kamar. The Maronites, or \"Catholics of Lebanon,\" differ from  the Roman Catholics in several points, and have a pope or patriarch of  their own. In 1860 the Druses made on them a horrible onslaught, which  called forth the intervention of Europe.      =Marotte= (2 _syl._), a footman of Gorgibus; a plain bourgeois, who hates  affectation. When the fine ladies of the house try to convert him into a  fashionable flunky, and teach him a little grandiloquence, he bluntly  tells them he does not understand Latin.         _Marotte._ Voil[`a] un laquais qui demande si vous [^e]tes au logis,       et dit que son ma[^i]tre, vous venir voir.         _Madelon._ Apprenez, sotte, [`a] vous ['e]noncer moins vulgaiment.       Dites: Voil[`a] un n['e]cessaire que demande si vous [^e]tes en       commodit['e] d'etre visibles.         _Marotte._ Je n'entends point le Latin.--Moli[`e]re, _Les       Pr['e]cieuses Ridicules_, vii. (1659).      =Marphi'sa=, sister of Roge'ro, and a female knight of amazing prowess.  She was brought up by a magician, but being stolen at the age of seven,  was sold to the king of Persia. When she was 18, her royal master  assailed her honor; but she slew him, and usurped the crown. Marphisa  went to Gaul to join the army of Agramant, but subsequently entered the  camp of Charlemagne, and was baptized.--Ariosto, _Orlando Furioso_  (1516).      =Marphu'rius=, a doctor of the Pyrrhonian school. Sganarelle consults him  about his marriage; but the philosopher replies, \"Perhaps; it is  possible; it may be so; everything is doubtful;\" till at last Sganarelle  beats him, and Marphurius says he shall bring an action against him for  battery. \"Perhaps,\" replies Sganarelle; \"it is possible; it may be so,\"  etc., using the very words of the philosopher (sc. ix.).--Moli[`e]re, _Le  Mariage Forc['e]_ (1664).      =Marplot=, \"the busy body.\" A blundering, good-natured, meddlesome young  man, very inquisitive, too officious by half, and always bungling  whatever he interferes in. Marplot is introduced by Mrs. Centlivre in  two comedies, _The Busy Body_ and _Marplot in Lisbon_.         That unlucky dog Marplot ... is ever doing mischief, and yet (to       give him his due) he never designs it. This is some blundering       adventure, wherein he thought to show his friendship, as he calls       it.--Mrs. Centlivre, _The Busy Body_, iii. 5 (1709).    [Asterism] This was Henry Woodward's great part (1717-1777). His  unappeasable curiosity, his slow comprehension, his annihilation under  the sense of his dilemmas, were so diverting, that even Garrick  confessed him the decided \"Marplot\" of the stage.--Boaden, _Life of  Siddons_.    N. B.--William Cavendish, duke of Newcastle, brought out a free  tranlation[TN-2] of Moli[`e]re's _L'Etourdi_, which he entitled _Marplot_.      =Marquis de Basqueville=, being one night at the opera, was told by a  messenger that his mansion was on fire. \"Eh bien,\" he said to the  messenger, \"adressez-vous [`a] Mme. la marquise qui est en face dans cette  loge; car c'est affaire de m['e]nage.\"--Chapus, _Dieppe et ses Environs_  (1853).      =Marrall= (_Jack_), a mean-spirited, revengeful time-server. He is the  clerk and tool of Sir Giles Overreach. When Marrall thinks Wellborn  penniless, he treats him like a dog; but as soon as he fancies he is  about to marry the wealthy dowager, Lady Allworth, he is most servile,  and offers to lend him money. Marrall now plays the traitor to his  master, Sir Giles, and reveals to Wellborn the scurvy tricks by which he  has been cheated of his estates. When, however, he asks Wellborn to take  him into his service, Wellborn replies, \"He who is false to one master  will betray another;\" and will have nothing to say to him.--Massinger,  _A New Way to Pay Old Debts_ (1628).      =Married Men of Genius.= The number of men of genius unhappy in their  wives is very large. The following are notorious examples:--Socrat[^e]s  and Xantipp[^e]; Saadi, the Persian poet; Dant[^e] and Gemma Donati;  Milton, with Mary Powell; Marlborough and Sarah Jennings; Gustavus  Adolphus and his flighty queen; Byron and Miss Milbanke; Dickens and  Miss Hogarth; etc. Every reader will be able to add to the list.      =Mars=, divine Fortitude personified. Bacchus is the tutelary demon of the  Mahommedans, and Mars the guardian potentate of the Christians.--Camoens,  _The Lusiad_ (1569).    _That Young Mars of Men_, Edward the Black prince, who with 8,000 men  defeated, at Poitiers, the French king, John, whose army amounted to  60,000--some say even more (A. D. 1356).[TN-3]    _The Mars of Men_, Henry Plantagenet, earl of Derby, third son of Henry,  earl of Lancaster, and near kinsman of Edward III. (See DERBY.)      =Marse' Chan.= Brave Virginian soldier whose lady-love enacts \"My Lady  Disdain\" until news is brought her that he has fallen in battle. Then  she grieves for him as a widow for her husband, and when she dies, she  is buried by him.--Thomas Nelson Page, _In Ole Virginia_ (1887).      =Mars of Portugal= (_The_), Alfonso de Albuquerque, viceroy of India  (1452-1515).      =Mars Wounded.= A very remarkable parallel to the encounter of Di[)o]med  and Mars in the _Iliad_, v., occurs in Ossian. Homer says that Diomed  hurled his spear against Mars, which, piercing the belt, wounded the  war-god in the bowels; \"Loud bellowed Mars, nine thousand men, ten  thousand, scarce so loud, joining fierce battle.\" Then Mars ascending,  wrapped in clouds, was borne upwards to Olympus.    Ossian, in _Carrick-Thura_, says that Loda, the god of his foes, came like  a \"blast from the mountain. He came in his terror and shook his dusky  spear. His eyes were flames, and his voice like distant thunder. 'Son of  night,' said Fingal, 'retire. Do I fear thy gloomy form, spirit of dismal  Loda? Weak is thy shield of cloud, feeble thy meteor sword.'\"[TN-4] Then  cleft he the gloomy shadow with his sword. It fell like a column of  smoke. It shrieked. Then rolling itself up, the wounded spirit rose on the  wind, and the island shook to its foundation.\"      =Marseilles' Good Bishop=, Henri Fran[c,]ois Xavier de Belsunce  (1671-1775).
