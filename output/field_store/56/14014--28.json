At the time of the conquest of this country by the \"Army of the West\" in  1846, and of the rush to California in 1849, vague rumors were current  of wonderful \"cities\" built in the cliffs, but the position of the  canyon in the heart of the Navaho country apparently prevented  exploration. In 1849 it was found necessary to make a demonstration  against these Indians, and an expedition was sent out under the command  of Colonel Washington, then governor of New Mexico. A detachment of  troops set out from Santa Fe, and was accompanied by Lieutenant  (afterward General) J. H. Simpson, of the topographical engineers, to  whose indefatigable zeal for investigation and carefulness of  observation much credit is due. He was much interested in the archeology  of the country passed over and his descriptions are remarkable for their  freedom from the exaggerations and erroneous observations which  characterize many of the publications of that period. His journal was  published by Congress the next year[1] and was also printed privately.        [Footnote 1: Thirty-first Congress, first session, Senate Ex. Doc.      No. 64, Washington, 1850.]    The expedition camped in the Chin Lee valley outside of Canyon de  Chelly, and Lieutenant Simpson made a side trip into the canyon itself.  He mentions ruins noticed by him at 41/2, 5, and 7 miles from the mouth;  the latter, the ruin subsequently known as Casa Blanca, he describes at  some length. He also gives an illustration drawn by R. H. Kern, which is  very bad, and pictures some pottery fragments found near or in the ruin.  The name De Chelly was apparently used before this time. Simpson  obtained its orthography from Vigil, secretary of the province (of New  Mexico), who told him it was of Indian origin and was pronounced  _chay-e_. Possibly it was derived from the Navaho name of the place,  Tse-gi.    Simpson's description, although very brief, formed the basis of all the  succeeding accounts for the next thirty years. The Pacific railroad  surveys, which added so much to our knowledge of the Southwest, did not  touch this field. In 1860 the Abbe Domenech published his \"Deserts of  North America,\" which contains a reference to Casa Blanca ruin, but his  knowledge was apparently derived wholly from Simpson. None of the  assistants of the Hayden Survey actually penetrated the canyon, but one  of them, W. H. Jackson, examined and described some ruins on the Rio de  Chelly, in the lower Chin Lee valley. But in an article in Scribner's  Magazine for December, 1878, Emma C. Hardacre published a number of  descriptions and illustrations derived from the Hayden corps, among  others figures one entitled \"Ruins in Canon de Chelly,\" from a drawing  by Thomas Moran. The ruin can not be identified from the drawing.    This article is worth more than a passing notice, as it not only  illustrates the extent of knowledge of the ruins at that time (1878),  but probably had much to do with disseminating and making current  erroneous inferences which survive to this day. In an introductory  paragraph the author says:      Of late, blown over the plains, come stories of strange newly    discovered cities of the far south-west; picturesque piles of    masonry, of an age unknown to tradition. These ruins mark an era    among antiquarians. The mysterious mound-builders fade into    comparative insignificance before the grander and more ancient    cliff-dwellers, whose castles lift their towers amid the sands of    Arizona and crown the terraced slopes of the Rio Mancos and the    Hovenweap.    Of the Chaco ruins it is said:      In size and grandeur of conception, they equal any of the present    buildings of the United States, if we except the Capitol at    Washington, and may without discredit be compared to the Pantheon    and the Colosseum of the Old World.    In the same year Mr J. H. Beadle gave an account[2] of a visit he made  to the canyon. He entered it over the Bat trail, near the junction of  Monument canyon, and saw several ruins in the upper part. His  descriptions are hardly more than a mention. Much archeologic data were  secured by the assistants of the Wheeler Survey, but it does not appear  that any of them, except the photographer, visited Canyon de Chelly. In  the final reports of the Survey there is an illustration of the ruin  visited by Lieutenant Simpson about thirty years before.[3] The  illustration is a beautiful heliotype from a fine photograph made by  T. H. O'Sullivan, but one serious defect renders it useless; through  some blunder of the photographer or the engraver, the picture is  reversed, the right and left sides being interchanged, so that to see it  properly it must be looked at in a mirror. The illustration is  accompanied by a short text, apparently prepared by Prof. F. W. Putnam,  who edited the volume. The account by Simpson is quoted and some  additional data are given, derived from notes accompanying the  photograph. The ruin is said to have \"now received the name of the Casa  Blanca, or White House,\" but the derivation of the name is not stated.        [Footnote 2: Western Wilds, and the Men who Redeem Them:      Cincinnati, Philadelphia, Chicago, Memphis, 1878.]        [Footnote 3: U.S. Geog. Surveys West of the 100th Meridian,      Lieutenant George M. Wheeler in charge; reports, vol. VII,      Archaeology; Washington, 1879, pp. 372-373, pl. xx.]    In 1882 Bancroft could find no better or fuller description than  Simpson's, which he uses fully, and reproduces also Simpson's (Kern's)  illustration. In the same year investigation by the assistants of the  Bureau of Ethnology was commenced. Colonel James Stevenson and a party  visited the canyon, and a considerable amount of data was obtained. In  all, 46 ruins were visited, 17 of which were in Del Muerto; and  sketches, ground plans, and photographs were obtained. The report of the  Bureau for that year contains an account of this expedition, including a  short description of a large ruin in Del Muerto, subsequently known as  Mummy Cave. A brief account of the trip was also published elsewhere.[4]  The next year a map of the canyon was made by the writer and many new  ruins were discovered, making the total number in the canyon and its  branches about 140. Since 1883 two short visits have been made to the  place, the last late in 1893, and on each trip additional material was  obtained. In 1890 Mr F. T. Bickford[5] published an account of a visit  to the canyon, illustrated with a series of woodcuts made from the  photographs of the Bureau. The illustrations are excellent and the text  is pleasantly written, but the descriptions of ruins are too general to  be of much value to the student.        [Footnote 4: Bull. Am. Geog. Soc., 1886, No. 4; Ancient      Habitations of the Southwest, by James Stevenson.]        [Footnote 5: Century Magazine, October, 1890, vol. XL, No. 6, p.      806 et seq.]    In recent years several publications have appeared which, while not  bearing directly on the De Chelly ruins, are of great interest, as they  treat of analogous remains--the cliff ruins of the Mancos canyon and the  Mesa Verde. These ruins were discovered in 1874 by W. H. Jackson and  were visited and described in 1875 by W. H. Holmes,[6] both of the  Hayden Survey. This region was roamed over by bands of renegade Ute and  Navaho, who were constantly making trouble, and for fifteen years was  apparently not visited by whites. Recent exploration appears to have  been inaugurated by Mr F. H. Chapin, who spent two summers in the Mesa  Verde country. Subsequently he published the results of some of his  observations in a handsome little volume.[7] In 1891 Dr W. R. Birdsall  made a flying trip to this region and published an account[8] of the  ruins he saw the same year. At the time of this visit a more elaborate  exploration was being carried on by the late G. Nordenskioeld, who made  some excavations and obtained much valuable data which formed the basis  of a book published in 1893.[9] This is the most important treatise on  the cliff ruins that has ever been published, and the illustrations can  only be characterized as magnificent. All of these works, and especially  the last named, are of great value to the student of the cliff ruins  wherever located, or of pueblo architecture.        [Footnote 6: U.S. Geol. Survey, F. V. Hayden in charge; 10th Ann.      Rept. (for 1876), Washington, 1878.]        [Footnote 7: The Land of the Cliff Dwellers, by Frederick H.      Chapin; Boston, 1892.]        [Footnote 8: Bull. Am.

The limits  of the region are closely coincident with the boundaries of the plateau  country except on the south, so much so that a map of the latter,[10]  slightly extended around its margin, will serve to show the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19726"],[0,"The Door Through Space (#2)"],[1,"here. I said so, and  the kid swore again, gulping, more upset than he wanted to admit. \"Does  this kind of thing happen often?\"    \"All the time,\" his companion assured him soberly, with a sidewise wink  at me. I didn't return the wink.    The kid wouldn't let it drop. \"Where did you learn their lingo, Mr.  Cargill?\"    \"I've been on Wolf a long time,\" I said, spun on my heel and walked  toward Headquarters. I tried not to hear, but their voices followed me  anyhow, discreetly lowered, but not lowered enough.    \"Kid, don't you know who he is? That's Cargill of the Secret Service!  Six years ago he was the best man in Intelligence, before--\" The voice  lowered another decibel, and then there was the kid's voice asking,  shaken, \"But what the hell happened to his face?\"    I should have been used to it by now. I'd been hearing it, more or less  behind my back, for six years. Well, if my luck held, I'd never hear it  again. I strode up the white steps of the skyscraper, to finish the  arrangements that would take me away from Wolf forever. To the other end  of the Empire, to the other end of the galaxy--anywhere, so long as I  need not wear my past like a medallion around my neck, or blazoned and  branded on what was left of my ruined face.          CHAPTER TWO      The Terran Empire has set its blazon on four hundred planets circling  more than three hundred suns. But no matter what the color of the sun,  the number of moons overhead, or the geography of the planet, once you  step inside a Headquarters building, you are on Earth. And Earth would  be alien to many who called themselves Earthmen, judging by the  strangeness I always felt when I stepped into that marble-and-glass  world inside the skyscraper. I heard the sound of my steps ringing into  thin resonance along the marble corridor, and squinted my eyes,  readjusting them painfully to the cold yellowness of the lights.    The Traffic Division was efficiency made insolent, in glass and chrome  and polished steel, mirrors and windows and looming electronic clerical  machines. Most of one wall was taken up by a TV monitor which gave a  view of the spaceport; a vast open space lighted with blue-white mercury  vapor lamps, and a chained-down skyscraper of a starship, littered over  with swarming ants. The process crew was getting the big ship ready for  skylift tomorrow morning. I gave it a second and then a third look. I'd  be on it when it lifted.    Turning away from the monitored spaceport, I watched myself stride  forward in the mirrored surfaces that were everywhere; a tall man, a  lean man, bleached out by years under a red sun, and deeply scarred on  both cheeks and around the mouth. Even after six years behind a desk, my  neat business clothes--suitable for an Earthman with a desk job--didn't  fit quite right, and I still rose unconsciously on the balls of my feet,  approximating the lean stooping walk of a Dry-towner from the Coronis  plains.    The clerk behind the sign marked TRANSPORTATION was a little rabbit of a  man with a sunlamp tan, barricaded by a small-sized spaceport of desk,  and looking as if he liked being shut up there. He looked up in civil  inquiry.    \"Can I do something for you?\"    \"My name's Cargill. Have you a pass for me?\"    He stared. A free pass aboard a starship is rare except for professional  spacemen, which I obviously wasn't. \"Let me check my records,\" he  hedged, and punched scanning buttons on the glassy surface. Shadows came  and went, and I saw myself half-reflected, a tipsy shadow in a flurry of  racing colors. The pattern finally stabilized and the clerk read off  names.    \"Brill, Cameron ... ah, yes. Cargill, Race Andrew, Department 38,  transfer transportation. Is that you?\"    I admitted it and he started punching more buttons when the sound of the  name made connection in whatever desk-clerks use for a brain. He stopped  with his hand halfway to the button.    \"Are you Race Cargill of the Secret Service, sir? _The_ Race Cargill?\"    \"It's right there,\" I said, gesturing wearily at the projected pattern  under the glassy surface.    \"Why, I thought--I mean, everybody took it for granted--that is, I  heard--\"    \"You thought Cargill had been killed a long time ago because his name  never turned up in news dispatches any more?\" I grinned sourly, seeing  my image dissolve in blurring shadows, and feeling the long-healed scar  on my mouth draw up to make the grin hideous. \"I'm Cargill, all right.  I've been up on Floor 38 for six years, holding down a desk any clerk  could handle. You for instance.\"    He gaped. He was a rabbit of a man who had never stepped out of the safe  familiar boundaries of the Terran Trade City. \"You mean _you're_ the man  who went to Charin in disguise, and routed out The Lisse? The man who  scouted the Black Ridge and Shainsa? And you've been working at a desk  upstairs all these years? It's--hard to believe, sir.\"    My mouth twitched. It had been hard for me to believe while I was doing  it. \"The pass?\"    \"Right away, sir.\" He punched buttons and a printed chip of plastic  extruded from a slot on the desk top. \"Your fingerprint, please?\" He  pressed my finger into the still-soft surface of the plastic, indelibly  recording the print; waited a moment for it to harden, then laid the  chip in the slot of a pneumatic tube. I heard it whoosh away.    \"They'll check your fingerprint against that when you board the ship.  Skylift isn't till dawn, but you can go aboard as soon as the process  crew finishes with her.\" He glanced at the monitor screen, where the  swarming crew were still doing inexplicable things to the immobile  spacecraft. \"It will be another hour or two. Where are you going, Mr.  Cargill?\"    \"Some planet in the Hyades Cluster. Vainwal, I think, something like  that.\"    \"What's it like there?\"    \"How should I know?\" I'd never been there either. I only knew that  Vainwal had a red sun, and that the Terran Legate could use a trained  Intelligence officer. And _not_ pin him down to a desk.    There was respect, and even envy in the little man's voice. \"Could  I--buy you a drink before you go aboard, Mr. Cargill?\"    \"Thanks, but I have a few loose ends to tie up.\" I didn't, but I was  damned if I'd spend my last hour on Wolf under the eyes of a deskbound  rabbit who preferred his adventure safely secondhand.    But after I'd left the office and the building, I almost wished I'd  taken him up on it. It would be at least an hour before I could board  the starship, with nothing to do but hash over old memories, better  forgotten.    The sun was lower now. Phi Coronis is a dim star, a dying star, and once  past the crimson zenith of noon, its light slants into a long  pale-reddish twilight. Four of Wolf's five moons were clustered in a  pale bouquet overhead, mingling thin violet moonlight into the crimson  dusk.    The shadows were blue and purple in the empty square as I walked across  the stones and stood looking down one of the side streets.    A few steps, and I was in an untidy slum which might have been on  another world from the neat bright Trade City which lay west of the  spaceport. The Kharsa was alive and reeking with the sounds and smells  of human and half-human life. A naked child, diminutive and  golden-furred, darted between two of the chinked pebble-houses, and  disappeared, spilling fragile laughter like breaking glass.    A little beast, half snake and half cat, crawled across a roof, spread  leathery wings, and flapped to the ground. The sour pungent reek of  incense from the open street-shrine made my nostrils twitch, and a  hulked form inside, not human, cast me a surly green glare as I passed.    I turned, retracing my steps. There was no danger, of course, so close  to the Trade City. Even on such planets as Wolf, Terra's laws are  respected within earshot of their gates. But there had been rioting here  and in Charin during the last month. After the display of mob violence  this afternoon, a lone Terran, unarmed, might turn up as a solitary  corpse flung on the steps of the HQ building.    There had been a time when I had walked alone from Shainsa to the Polar  Colony. I had known how to melt into this kind of night, shabby and  inconspicuous, a worn shirtcloak hunched round my shoulders, weaponless  except for the razor-sharp skean in the clasp of the cloak; walking on  the balls of my feet like a Dry-towner, not looking or sounding or  smelling like an Earthman.    That rabbit in the Traffic office had stirred up things I'd be wiser to  forget. It had been six years; six years of slow death behind a desk,  since the day when Rakhal Sensar had left me a marked man; death-warrant  written on my scarred face anywhere outside the narrow confines of the  Terran law on Wolf.    Rakhal Sensar--my fists clenched with the old impotent hate. _If I could  get my hands on him!_    It had been Rakhal who first led me through the byways of the Kharsa,  teaching me the jargon of a dozen tribes, the chirping call of the  Ya-men, the way of the catmen of the rain-forests, the argot of thieves  markets, the walk and step of the Dry-towners from Shainsa and Daillon  and Ardcarran--the parched cities of dusty, salt stone which spread out  in the bottoms of Wolf's vanished oceans. Rakhal was from Shainsa,  human, tall as an Earthman, weathered by salt and sun, and he had worked  for Terran Intelligence since we were boys. We had traveled all over our  world together, and found it good.    And then, for some reason I had never known, it had come to an end.  Even now I was not wholly sure why he had erupted, that day, into  violence and a final explosion. Then he had disappeared, leaving me a  marked man. And a lonely one: Juli had gone with him.    I strode the streets of the slum unseeing, my thoughts running a  familiar channel. Juli, my kid sister, clinging around Rakhal's neck,  her gray eyes hating me. I had never seen her again.    That had been six years ago."]]]
