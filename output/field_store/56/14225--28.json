As to the maid, Marie, she had gone off some  days beforehand in floods of tears, after informing the other maids  that she was leaving service forever.  Dr. Shlessinger had paid the  bill of the whole party before his departure.    \"By the way,\" said the landlord in conclusion, \"you are not the only  friend of Lady Frances Carfax who is inquiring after her just now.  Only a week or so ago we had a man here upon the same errand.\"    \"Did he give a name?\" I asked.    \"None; but he was an Englishman, though of an unusual type.\"    \"A savage?\" said I, linking my facts after the fashion of my  illustrious friend.    \"Exactly.  That describes him very well. He is a bulky, bearded,  sunburned fellow, who looks as if he would be more at home in a  farmers' inn than in a fashionable hotel.  A hard, fierce man, I should  think, and one whom I should be sorry to offend.\"    Already the mystery began to define itself, as figures grow clearer  with the lifting of a fog.  Here was this good and pious lady pursued  from place to place by a sinister and unrelenting figure.  She feared  him, or she would not have fled from Lausanne.  He had still followed.  Sooner or later he would overtake her.  Had he already overtaken her?  Was THAT the secret of her continued silence?  Could the good people  who were her companions not screen her from his violence or his  blackmail? What horrible purpose, what deep design, lay behind this  long pursuit?  There was the problem which I had to solve.    To Holmes I wrote showing how rapidly and surely I had got down to the  roots of the matter.  In reply I had a telegram asking for a  description of Dr. Shlessinger's left ear.  Holmes's ideas of humour  are strange and occasionally offensive, so I took no notice of his  ill-timed jest--indeed, I had already reached Montpellier in my pursuit  of the maid, Marie, before his message came.    I had no difficulty in finding the ex-servant and in learning all that  she could tell me.  She was a devoted creature, who had only left her  mistress because she was sure that she was in good hands, and because  her own approaching marriage made a separation inevitable in any case.  Her mistress had, as she confessed with distress, shown some  irritability of temper towards her during their stay in Baden, and had  even questioned her once as if she had suspicions of her honesty, and  this had made the parting easier than it would otherwise have been.  Lady Frances had given her fifty pounds as a wedding-present.  Like me,  Marie viewed with deep distrust the stranger who had driven her  mistress from Lausanne.  With her own eyes she had seen him seize the  lady's wrist with great violence on the public promenade by the lake.  He was a fierce and terrible man.  She believed that it was out of  dread of him that Lady Frances had accepted the escort of the  Shlessingers to London.  She had never spoken to Marie about it, but  many little signs had convinced the maid that her mistress lived in a  state of continual nervous apprehension.  So far she had got in her  narrative, when suddenly she sprang from her chair and her face was  convulsed with surprise and fear.  \"See!\" she cried.  \"The miscreant  follows still!  There is the very man of whom I speak.\"    Through the open sitting-room window I saw a huge, swarthy man with a  bristling black beard walking slowly down the centre of the street and  staring eagerly at the numbers of the houses.  It was clear that, like  myself, he was on the track of the maid. Acting upon the impulse of the  moment, I rushed out and accosted him.    \"You are an Englishman,\" I said.    \"What if I am?\" he asked with a most villainous scowl.    \"May I ask what your name is?\"    \"No, you may not,\" said he with decision.    The situation was awkward, but the most direct way is often the best.    \"Where is the Lady Frances Carfax?\" I asked.    He stared at me with amazement.    \"What have you done with her?  Why have you pursued her?  I insist upon  an answer!\" said I.    The fellow gave a bellow of anger and sprang upon me like a tiger. I  have held my own in many a struggle, but the man had a grip of iron and  the fury of a fiend.  His hand was on my throat and my senses were  nearly gone before an unshaven French ouvrier in a blue blouse darted  out from a cabaret opposite, with a cudgel in his hand, and struck my  assailant a sharp crack over the forearm, which made him leave go his  hold.  He stood for an instant fuming with rage and uncertain whether  he should not renew his attack. Then, with a snarl of anger, he left me  and entered the cottage from which I had just come.  I turned to thank  my preserver, who stood beside me in the roadway.    \"Well, Watson,\" said he, \"a very pretty hash you have made of it! I  rather think you had better come back with me to London by the night  express.\"    An hour afterwards, Sherlock Holmes, in his usual garb and style, was  seated in my private room at the hotel.  His explanation of his sudden  and opportune appearance was simplicity itself, for, finding that he  could get away from London, he determined to head me off at the next  obvious point of my travels.  In the disguise of a workingman he had  sat in the cabaret waiting for my appearance.    \"And a singularly consistent investigation you have made, my dear  Watson,\" said he.  \"I cannot at the moment recall any possible blunder  which you have omitted.  The total effect of your proceeding has been  to give the alarm everywhere and yet to discover nothing.\"    \"Perhaps you would have done no better,\" I answered bitterly.    \"There is no 'perhaps' about it.  I HAVE done better.  Here is the Hon.  Philip Green, who is a fellow-lodger with you in this hotel, and we may  find him the starting-point for a more successful investigation.\"    A card had come up on a salver, and it was followed by the same bearded  ruffian who had attacked me in the street.  He started when he saw me.    \"What is this, Mr. Holmes?\" he asked.  \"I had your note and I have  come.  But what has this man to do with the matter?\"    \"This is my old friend and associate, Dr. Watson, who is helping us in  this affair.\"    The stranger held out a huge, sunburned hand, with a few words of  apology.    \"I hope I didn't harm you.  When you accused me of hurting her I lost  my grip of myself.  Indeed, I'm not responsible in these days.  My  nerves are like live wires.  But this situation is beyond me.  What I  want to know, in the first place, Mr. Holmes, is, how in the world you  came to hear of my existence at all.\"    \"I am in touch with Miss Dobney, Lady Frances's governess.\"    \"Old Susan Dobney with the mob cap!  I remember her well.\"    \"And she remembers you.  It was in the days before--before you found it  better to go to South Africa.\"    \"Ah, I see you know my whole story.  I need hide nothing from you.  I  swear to you, Mr. Holmes, that there never was in this world a man who  loved a woman with a more wholehearted love than I had for Frances.  I  was a wild youngster, I know--not worse than others of my class.  But  her mind was pure as snow.  She could not bear a shadow of coarseness.  So, when she came to hear of things that I had done, she would have no  more to say to me. And yet she loved me--that is the wonder of  it!--loved me well enough to remain single all her sainted days just  for my sake alone.  When the years had passed and I had made my money  at Barberton I thought perhaps I could seek her out and soften her. I  had heard that she was still unmarried, I found her at Lausanne and  tried all I knew.  She weakened, I think, but her will was strong, and  when next I called she had left the town.  I traced her to Baden, and  then after a time heard that her maid was here. I'm a rough fellow,  fresh from a rough life, and when Dr. Watson spoke to me as he did I  lost hold of myself for a moment.  But for God's sake tell me what has  become of the Lady Frances.\"    \"That is for us to find out,\" said Sherlock Holmes with peculiar  gravity.  \"What is your London address, Mr. Green?\"    \"The Langham Hotel will find me.\"    \"Then may I recommend that you return there and be on hand in case I  should want you?  I have no desire to encourage false hopes, but you  may rest assured that all that can be done will be done for the safety  of Lady Frances.  I can say no more for the instant.  I will leave you  this card so that you may be able to keep in touch with us.  Now,  Watson, if you will pack your bag I will cable to Mrs. Hudson to make  one of her best efforts for two hungry travellers at 7:30 to-morrow.\"      A telegram was awaiting us when we reached our Baker Street rooms,  which Holmes read with an exclamation of interest and threw across to  me.  \"Jagged or torn,\" was the message, and the place of origin, Baden.    \"What is this?\" I asked.    \"It is everything,\" Holmes answered.  \"You may remember my seemingly  irrelevant question as to this clerical gentleman's left ear. You did  not answer it.\"    \"I had left Baden and could not inquire.\"    \"Exactly.  For this reason I sent a duplicate to the manager of the  Englischer Hof, whose answer lies here.\"    \"What does it show?\"    \"It shows, my dear Watson, that we are dealing with an exceptionally  astute and dangerous man.  The Rev. Dr. Shlessinger, missionary from  South America, is none other than Holy Peters, one of the most  unscrupulous rascals that Australia has ever evolved--and for a young  country it has turned out some very finished types.  His particular  specialty is the beguiling of lonely ladies by playing upon their  religious feelings, and his so-called wife, an Englishwoman named  Fraser, is a worthy helpmate.  The nature of his tactics suggested his  identity to me, and this physical peculiarity--he was badly bitten in a  saloon-fight at Adelaide in '89--confirmed my suspicion.  This poor  lady is in the hands of a most infernal couple, who will"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2349"],[0,"The Adventure of the Devil's Foot (#2)"],[1,"of a very exceptional nature. Have you  been there yourself, Mr. Roundhay?\"    \"No, Mr. Holmes.  Mr. Tregennis brought back the account to the  vicarage, and I at once hurried over with him to consult you.\"    \"How far is it to the house where this singular tragedy occurred?\"    \"About a mile inland.\"    \"Then we shall walk over together.  But before we start I must ask you  a few questions, Mr. Mortimer Tregennis.\"    The other had been silent all this time, but I had observed that his  more controlled excitement was even greater than the obtrusive emotion  of the clergyman.  He sat with a pale, drawn face, his anxious gaze  fixed upon Holmes, and his thin hands clasped convulsively together.  His pale lips quivered as he listened to the dreadful experience which  had befallen his family, and his dark eyes seemed to reflect something  of the horror of the scene.    \"Ask what you like, Mr. Holmes,\" said he eagerly.  \"It is a bad thing  to speak of, but I will answer you the truth.\"    \"Tell me about last night.\"    \"Well, Mr. Holmes, I supped there, as the vicar has said, and my elder  brother George proposed a game of whist afterwards.  We sat down about  nine o'clock.  It was a quarter-past ten when I moved to go.  I left  them all round the table, as merry as could be.\"    \"Who let you out?\"    \"Mrs. Porter had gone to bed, so I let myself out.  I shut the hall  door behind me.  The window of the room in which they sat was closed,  but the blind was not drawn down.  There was no change in door or  window this morning, or any reason to think that any stranger had been  to the house.  Yet there they sat, driven clean mad with terror, and  Brenda lying dead of fright, with her head hanging over the arm of the  chair.  I'll never get the sight of that room out of my mind so long as  I live.\"    \"The facts, as you state them, are certainly most remarkable,\" said  Holmes.  \"I take it that you have no theory yourself which can in any  way account for them?\"    \"It's devilish, Mr. Holmes, devilish!\" cried Mortimer Tregennis. \"It is  not of this world.  Something has come into that room which has dashed  the light of reason from their minds.  What human contrivance could do  that?\"    \"I fear,\" said Holmes, \"that if the matter is beyond humanity it is  certainly beyond me.  Yet we must exhaust all natural explanations  before we fall back upon such a theory as this.  As to yourself, Mr.  Tregennis, I take it you were divided in some way from your family,  since they lived together and you had rooms apart?\"    \"That is so, Mr. Holmes, though the matter is past and done with. We  were a family of tin-miners at Redruth, but we sold our venture to a  company, and so retired with enough to keep us.  I won't deny that  there was some feeling about the division of the money and it stood  between us for a time, but it was all forgiven and forgotten, and we  were the best of friends together.\"    \"Looking back at the evening which you spent together, does anything  stand out in your memory as throwing any possible light upon the  tragedy?  Think carefully, Mr. Tregennis, for any clue which can help  me.\"    \"There is nothing at all, sir.\"    \"Your people were in their usual spirits?\"    \"Never better.\"    \"Were they nervous people?  Did they ever show any apprehension of  coming danger?\"    \"Nothing of the kind.\"    \"You have nothing to add then, which could assist me?\"    Mortimer Tregennis considered earnestly for a moment.    \"There is one thing occurs to me,\" said he at last.  \"As we sat at the  table my back was to the window, and my brother George, he being my  partner at cards, was facing it.  I saw him once look hard over my  shoulder, so I turned round and looked also.  The blind was up and the  window shut, but I could just make out the bushes on the lawn, and it  seemed to me for a moment that I saw something moving among them.  I  couldn't even say if it was man or animal, but I just thought there was  something there.  When I asked him what he was looking at, he told me  that he had the same feeling.  That is all that I can say.\"    \"Did you not investigate?\"    \"No; the matter passed as unimportant.\"    \"You left them, then, without any premonition of evil?\"    \"None at all.\"    \"I am not clear how you came to hear the news so early this morning.\"    \"I am an early riser and generally take a walk before breakfast. This  morning I had hardly started when the doctor in his carriage overtook  me.  He told me that old Mrs. Porter had sent a boy down with an urgent  message.  I sprang in beside him and we drove on. When we got there we  looked into that dreadful room.  The candles and the fire must have  burned out hours before, and they had been sitting there in the dark  until dawn had broken.  The doctor said Brenda must have been dead at  least six hours.  There were no signs of violence.  She just lay across  the arm of the chair with that look on her face.  George and Owen were  singing snatches of songs and gibbering like two great apes.  Oh, it  was awful to see!  I couldn't stand it, and the doctor was as white as  a sheet.  Indeed, he fell into a chair in a sort of faint, and we  nearly had him on our hands as well.\"    \"Remarkable--most remarkable!\" said Holmes, rising and taking his hat.  \"I think, perhaps, we had better go down to Tredannick Wartha without  further delay.  I confess that I have seldom known a case which at  first sight presented a more singular problem.\"      Our proceedings of that first morning did little to advance the  investigation.  It was marked, however, at the outset by an incident  which left the most sinister impression upon my mind. The approach to  the spot at which the tragedy occurred is down a narrow, winding,  country lane.  While we made our way along it we heard the rattle of a  carriage coming towards us and stood aside to let it pass.  As it drove  by us I caught a glimpse through the closed window of a horribly  contorted, grinning face glaring out at us.  Those staring eyes and  gnashing teeth flashed past us like a dreadful vision.    \"My brothers!\" cried Mortimer Tregennis, white to his lips. \"They are  taking them to Helston.\"    We looked with horror after the black carriage, lumbering upon its way.  Then we turned our steps towards this ill-omened house in which they  had met their strange fate.    It was a large and bright dwelling, rather a villa than a cottage, with  a considerable garden which was already, in that Cornish air, well  filled with spring flowers.  Towards this garden the window of the  sitting-room fronted, and from it, according to Mortimer Tregennis,  must have come that thing of evil which had by sheer horror in a single  instant blasted their minds.  Holmes walked slowly and thoughtfully  among the flower-plots and along the path before we entered the porch.  So absorbed was he in his thoughts, I remember, that he stumbled over  the watering-pot, upset its contents, and deluged both our feet and the  garden path.  Inside the house we were met by the elderly Cornish  housekeeper, Mrs. Porter, who, with the aid of a young girl, looked  after the wants of the family.  She readily answered all Holmes's  questions.  She had heard nothing in the night.  Her employers had all  been in excellent spirits lately, and she had never known them more  cheerful and prosperous.  She had fainted with horror upon entering the  room in the morning and seeing that dreadful company round the table.  She had, when she recovered, thrown open the window to let the morning  air in, and had run down to the lane, whence she sent a farm-lad for  the doctor.  The lady was on her bed upstairs if we cared to see her.  It took four strong men to get the brothers into the asylum carriage.  She would not herself stay in the house another day and was starting  that very afternoon to rejoin her family at St. Ives.    We ascended the stairs and viewed the body.  Miss Brenda Tregennis had  been a very beautiful girl, though now verging upon middle age.  Her  dark, clear-cut face was handsome, even in death, but there still  lingered upon it something of that convulsion of horror which had been  her last human emotion.  From her bedroom we descended to the  sitting-room, where this strange tragedy had actually occurred.  The  charred ashes of the overnight fire lay in the grate.  On the table  were the four guttered and burned-out candles, with the cards scattered  over its surface.  The chairs had been moved back against the walls,  but all else was as it had been the night before.  Holmes paced with  light, swift steps about the room; he sat in the various chairs,  drawing them up and reconstructing their positions.  He tested how much  of the garden was visible; he examined the floor, the ceiling, and the  fireplace; but never once did I see that sudden brightening of his eyes  and tightening of his lips which would have told me that he saw some  gleam of light in this utter darkness.    \"Why a fire?\" he asked once.  \"Had they always a fire in this small  room on a spring evening?\"    Mortimer Tregennis explained that the night was cold and damp. For that  reason, after his arrival, the fire was lit.  \"What are you going to do  now, Mr. Holmes?\" he asked.    My friend smiled and laid his hand upon my arm.  \"I think, Watson, that  I shall resume that course of tobacco-poisoning which you have so often  and so justly condemned,\" said he.  \"With your permission, gentlemen,  we will now return to our cottage, for I am not aware that any new  factor is likely to come to our notice here.  I will turn the facts  over in my mind, Mr. Tregennis, and should anything occur to me I will  certainly communicate with you and the vicar.  In the meantime I wish  you both good-morning.\"    It was not until long after we were back in Poldhu Cottage that Holmes  broke his complete and absorbed silence.  He sat coiled in his  armchair, his haggard and ascetic face hardly visible amid the"]]]
