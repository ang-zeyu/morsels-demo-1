In 1743 he entered Trinity College, Dublin, as a pensioner. He gained  fair honors during his residence there, but, like Johnson, Swift,  Goldsmith, and other eminent men, he did not distinguish himself so as  to lead to any speculation as to his after greatness, although his  elders said he was more anxious to acquire knowledge than to display  it;--a valuable testimony. His domestic life was so pure, his  friendships were so firm, his habits so completely those of a well-bred,  well-born IRISH GENTLEMAN--mingling, as only Irish gentlemen can do, the  suavity of the French with the dignity of English manners--that there is  little to write about, or speculate upon, beyond his public words and  deeds.    Like most young men of his time, his first oratory was exercised at a  club, and his first efforts as a politician were made in 1749, previous  to his quitting the Dublin University, in some letters against Mr. Henry  Brooke, the author of \"Gustavus Vasa.\" His determination was the bar,  and his entry at the Middle Temple bears date April 23, 1747. His  youthful impressions of England and its capital are recorded in graceful  language in his letters to those friends whom he never lost, but by  death; one passage is as applicable to the present as to the past. \"I  don't find that genius, the 'rath primrose which forsaken dies,' is  patronized by any of the nobility, so that writers of the first talents  are left to the capricious patronage of the public.\"    It was the taste of his time to desire, if not solicit patronage. In our  opinion literature is degraded by _patronage_, while it is honored by  the friendship of the good and great. Nothing is so loathsome in the  history of letters as the debased dedications which men of mind some  years ago laid at the feet of the so-styled \"patron!\" Literature in our  days has only to assert its own dignity, to be true and faithful to the  right, to avoid ribaldry, and preserve a noble and brave independence;  and then its importance to the state, as the minister of good, must be  acknowledged. It is only when forgetful of great purposes and great  power, that literature is open to be forgotten or sneered at. Still the  indifference an Englishman feels towards genius, even while enjoying its  fruits, was likely enough to check and chill the enthusiasm of Burke,  and drive him to much mystery as to his early literary engagements. One  of his observations made during his first visit to Westminster Abbey,  while hopes and ambitions quickened his throbbing pulse, and he might  have been pardoned for wishing for a resting-place in the grand  mausoleum of England, is remarkable, as showing how little he changed,  and how completely the youth        \"Was father to the man.\"    \"Yet after all, do you know that I would rather sleep in the southern  corner of a country church-yard than in the tomb of the Capulets? I  should like, however, that my dust should mingle with kindred dust; the  good old expression, 'family burying-grounds,' has something pleasant in  it, at least to me.\"    This was his last, as it seems to have been his first desire; and it has  found an echo in many a richly dowered heart.    \"Lay me,\" said Allan Cunningham, \"where the daisies can grow on my  grave;\" and it is well known that Moore--        \"The poet of all circles,\"--    and, as a poor Irishman once rendered it--        \"The _darlint_ of his own,\"      has frequently expressed a desire to be buried at Sloperton beside his  children.    The future orator found the law, as a profession, alien to his habits  and feelings, for at the expiration of the usual term he was not even  called to the bar. Some say he desired the professorship of logic at the  University of Glasgow, and even stood the contest; but this has been  disputed, and if he was rejected, it is matter of congratulation, that  his talents and time were not confined to so narrow a sphere. At that  period his mind was occupied by his theories on the Sublime and  Beautiful, which were finally condensed and published in the shape of  that essay which roused the world to admiration.    Mr. Prior says, and with every show of reason, \"that Mr. Burke's  ambition of being distinguished in literature, seems to have been one of  his earliest, as it was one of his latest, passions.\" His first avowed  work was \"The Vindication of Natural Society;\" but he wrote a great deal  anonymously; and the essay on \"The Sublime and Beautiful,\" triumphant as  it was, must have caused him great anxiety; he began it before he was  nineteen, and kept it by him for seven years before it was published--a  valuable lesson to those who rush into print and mistake the desire for  celebrity, for the power which bestows immortality.    The literature which is pursued chiefly in solitude, is always the best  sort: society, which cheers and animates men in most employments, is an  impediment to an author if really warmed by true genius, and impelled by  a sacred love of truth not to fritter away his thoughts or be tempted to  insincerity.    The genius and noble mind of Burke constituted him a high priest of  literature; the lighter, and it might be the more pleasurable enjoyments  of existence, could not be tasted without interfering with his pursuits;  but he knew his duty to his God, to the world, and to himself, and the  responsibility alone was sufficiently weighty to bend a delicate frame,  even when there was no necessity for laboring to live--but where an  object is to be attained, principles put forth or combated, God or man  to be served, the necessity for exertion always exists, and the great  soul must go forth on its mission.    That sooner or later this strife, or love, or duty--pursued  bravely--must tell upon all who even covet and enjoy their labor, the  experience of the past has recorded; and Edmund Burke, even at that  early period of life, was ordered to try the effects of a visit to Bath  and Bristol, then the principal resort of the invalids of the United  Kingdom.    At Bath he exchanged one malady for another, for he became attached to  Miss Nugent, the daughter of his physician, and in a very little time  formed what, in a worldly point of view, would be considered an  imprudent marriage, but which secured the happiness of his future life;  she was a Roman Catholic; but, however unfortunate dissenting creeds are  in many instances, in this it never disturbed the harmony of their  affection.    She was a woman exactly calculated to create happiness; possessing  accomplishments, goodness of heart, sweetness of disposition and  manners, veneration for talent, a hopeful spirit to allay her husband's  anxieties, wisdom and love to meet his ruffled temper, and tenderness to  subdue it--qualities which made him frequently declare \"that every care  vanished the moment he sheltered beneath his own roof.\"    Edmund Burke became a husband, and also continued a lover--and once  presented to his ladylove, on the anniversary of their marriage, his  idea of \"a perfect wife.\"[2]    For a considerable time after his marriage Burke toiled as a literary  man, living at Battersea or in town, now writing, it is believed,  jointly with his brother Richard and his cousin William a work on the  \"European Settlements in America,\" in two volumes, which, according to  tradition, brought him, or them, only fifty pounds! then planning and  commencing an abridgment of the \"History of England.\"    Struggling, it may be with difficulties brought on by his generous  nature, and which his father's allowance of two hundred a year, and his  own industry and perseverance could hardly overcome, the birth of a son  was an additional stimulant to exertion, and, in conjunction with  Dodsley, he established the _Annual Register_. This work he never  acknowledged, but his best biographers have no doubt of his having  brought forth and nurtured this useful publication. A hundred pounds a  volume seems to have been the sum paid for this labor; and Burke's  receipts for the money were at one time in the possession of Mr. Upcott.    Long before he obtained a seat in Parliament he won the esteem of Doctor  Johnson, who bore noble testimony to his virtue and talent, and what he  especially admired, and called, his \"affluence of conversation.\"    For a time he went to Ireland as private secretary to Mr. Hamilton,  distinguished from all others of his name as \"single-speech Hamilton;\"  but disagreeing with this person, he nobly threw up a pension of three  hundred a year, because of the unreasonable and derogatory claims made  upon his gratitude by Hamilton, who had procured it for him.    While in Dublin he made acquaintance with the genius of the painter  Barry, and though his own means were limited, he persuaded him to come  to England, and received him in his house in Queen Anne-street, where he  soon procured him employment; he already numbered Mr., afterwards Sir  Joshua, Reynolds amongst his friends; and his correspondence with Barry  might almost be considered a young painter's manual, so full is it of  the better parts of taste, wisdom, and knowledge.    Mr. Burke was then on the threshold of Parliament, Lord Verney arranging  for his _debut_ as member for Wendover, in Buckinghamshire, under the  Rockingham administration; another star was added to the galaxy of that  brilliant assembly, and if we had space it could not be devoted to a  better purpose than to trace his glorious career in the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/227"],[0,"Aeneidos (#2)"],[1,"ubi fata quietas    ostendunt; illic fas regna resurgere Troiae.    Durate, et vosmet rebus servate secundis.'      Talia voce refert, curisque ingentibus aeger    spem voltu simulat, premit altum corde dolorem.    Illi se praedae accingunt, dapibusque futuris;    tergora deripiunt costis et viscera nudant;    pars in frusta secant veribusque trementia figunt;    litore aena locant alii, flammasque ministrant.    Tum victu revocant vires, fusique per herbam    implentur veteris Bacchi pinguisque ferinae.    Postquam exempta fames epulis mensaeque remotae,    amissos longo socios sermone requirunt,    spemque metumque inter dubii, seu vivere credant,    sive extrema pati nec iam exaudire vocatos.    Praecipue pius Aeneas nunc acris Oronti,    nunc Amyci casum gemit et crudelia secum    fata Lyci, fortemque Gyan, fortemque Cloanthum.      Et iam finis erat, cum Iuppiter aethere summo    despiciens mare velivolum terrasque iacentis    litoraque et latos populos, sic vertice caeli    constitit, et Libyae defixit lumina regnis.    Atque illum talis iactantem pectore curas    tristior et lacrimis oculos suffusa nitentis    adloquitur Venus:  'O qui res hominumque deumque    aeternis regis imperiis, et fulmine terres,    quid meus Aeneas in te committere tantum,    quid Troes potuere, quibus, tot funera passis,    cunctus ob Italiam terrarum clauditur orbis?    Certe hinc Romanos olim, volventibus annis,    hinc fore ductores, revocato a sanguine Teucri,    qui mare, qui terras omni dicione tenerent,    pollicitus, quae te, genitor, sententia vertit?    Hoc equidem occasum Troiae tristisque ruinas    solabar, fatis contraria fata rependens;    nunc eadem fortuna viros tot casibus actos    insequitur.  Quem das finem, rex magne, laborum?    Antenor potuit, mediis elapsus Achivis,    Illyricos penetrare sinus, atque intima tutus    regna Liburnorum, et fontem superare Timavi,    unde per ora novem vasto cum murmure montis    it mare proruptum et pelago premit arva sonanti.    Hic tamen ille urbem Patavi sedesque locavit    Teucrorum, et genti nomen dedit, armaque fixit    Troia; nunc placida compostus pace quiescit:    nos, tua progenies, caeli quibus adnuis arcem,    navibus (infandum!) amissis, unius ob iram    prodimur atque Italis longe disiungimur oris.    Hic pietatis honos?  Sic nos in sceptra reponis?'        Olli subridens hominum sator atque deorum,    voltu, quo caelum tempestatesque serenat,    oscula libavit natae, dehinc talia fatur:    'Parce metu, Cytherea:  manent immota tuorum    fata tibi; cernes urbem et promissa Lavini    moenia, sublimemque feres ad sidera caeli    magnanimum Aenean; neque me sententia vertit.    Hic tibi (fabor enim, quando haec te cura remordet,    longius et volvens fatorum arcana movebo)    bellum ingens geret Italia, populosque feroces    contundet, moresque viris et moenia ponet,    tertia dum Latio regnantem viderit aestas,    ternaque transierint Rutulis hiberna subactis.    At puer Ascanius, cui nunc cognomen Iulo    additur,---Ilus erat, dum res stetit Ilia regno,---    triginta magnos volvendis mensibus orbis    imperio explebit, regnumque ab sede Lavini    transferet, et longam multa vi muniet Albam.    Hic iam ter centum totos regnabitur annos    gente sub Hectorea, donec regina sacerdos,    Marte gravis, geminam partu dabit Ilia prolem.    Inde lupae fulvo nutricis tegmine laetus    Romulus excipiet gentem, et Mavortia condet    moenia, Romanosque suo de nomine dicet.    His ego nec metas rerum nec tempora pono;    imperium sine fine dedi.  Quin aspera Iuno,    quae mare nunc terrasque metu caelumque fatigat,    consilia in melius referet, mecumque fovebit    Romanos rerum dominos gentemque togatam:    sic placitum.  Veniet lustris labentibus aetas,    cum domus Assaraci Phthiam clarasque Mycenas    servitio premet, ac victis dominabitur Argis.    Nascetur pulchra Troianus origine Caesar,    imperium oceano, famam qui terminet astris,---    Iulius, a magno demissum nomen Iulo.    Hunc tu olim caelo, spoliis Orientis onustum,    accipies secura; vocabitur hic quoque votis.    Aspera tum positis mitescent saecula bellis;    cana Fides, et Vesta, Remo cum fratre Quirinus,    iura dabunt; dirae ferro et compagibus artis    claudentur Belli portae; Furor impius intus,    saeva sedens super arma, et centum vinctus aenis    post tergum nodis, fremet horridus ore cruento.'      Haec ait, et Maia genitum demittit ab alto,    ut terrae, utque novae pateant Karthaginis arces    hospitio Teucris, ne fati nescia Dido    finibus arceret:  volat ille per aera magnum    remigio alarum, ac Libyae citus adstitit oris.    Et iam iussa facit, ponuntque ferocia Poeni    corda volente deo; in primis regina quietum    accipit in Teucros animum mentemque benignam.      At pius Aeneas, per noctem plurima volvens,    ut primum lux alma data est, exire locosque    explorare novos, quas vento accesserit oras,    qui teneant, nam inculta videt, hominesne feraene,    quaerere constituit, sociisque exacta referre    Classem in convexo nemorum sub rupe cavata    arboribus clausam circum atque horrentibus umbris    occulit; ipse uno graditur comitatus Achate,    bina manu lato crispans hastilia ferro.      Cui mater media sese tulit obvia silva,    virginis os habitumque gerens, et virginis arma    Spartanae, vel qualis equos Threissa fatigat    Harpalyce, volucremque fuga praevertitur Hebrum.    Namque umeris de more habilem suspenderat arcum    venatrix, dederatque comam diffundere ventis,    nuda genu, nodoque sinus collecta fluentis.    Ac prior, 'Heus' inquit 'iuvenes, monstrate mearum    vidistis si quam hic errantem forte sororum,    succinctam pharetra et maculosae tegmine lyncis,    aut spumantis apri cursum clamore prementem.'      Sic Venus; et Veneris contra sic filius orsus:    'Nulla tuarum audita mihi neque visa sororum---    O quam te memorem, virgo?  Namque haud tibi voltus    mortalis, nec vox hominem sonat:  O, dea certe---    an Phoebi soror?  an nympharum sanguinis una?---    sis felix, nostrumque leves, quaecumque, laborem,    et, quo sub caelo tandem, quibus orbis in oris    iactemur, doceas.  Ignari hominumque locorumque    erramus, vento huc vastis et fluctibus acti:    multa tibi ante aras nostra cadet hostia dextra.'      Tum Venus:  'Haud equidem tali me dignor honore;    virginibus Tyriis mos est gestare pharetram,    purpureoque alte suras vincire cothurno.    Punica regna vides, Tyrios et Agenoris urbem;    sed fines Libyci, genus intractabile bello.    Imperium Dido Tyria regit urbe profecta,    germanum fugiens.  Longa est iniuria, longae    ambages; sed summa sequar fastigia rerum.      'Huic coniunx Sychaeus erat, ditissimus agri    Phoenicum, et magno miserae dilectus amore,    cui pater intactam dederat, primisque iugarat    ominibus.  Sed regna Tyri germanus habebat    Pygmalion, scelere ante alios immanior omnes.    Quos inter medius venit furor.  Ille Sychaeum    impius ante aras, atque auri caecus amore,    clam ferro incautum superat, securus amorum    germanae; factumque diu celavit, et aegram,    multa malus simulans, vana spe lusit amantem.    Ipsa sed in somnis inhumati venit imago    coniugis, ora modis attollens pallida miris,    crudeles aras traiectaque pectora ferro    nudavit, caecumque domus scelus omne retexit.    Tum celerare fugam patriaque excedere suadet,    auxiliumque viae veteres tellure recludit    thesauros, ignotum argenti pondus et auri.    His commota fugam Dido sociosque parabat:    conveniunt, quibus aut odium crudele tyranni    aut metus acer erat; navis, quae forte paratae,    corripiunt, onerantque auro:  portantur avari    Pygmalionis opes pelago; dux femina facti.    Devenere locos, ubi nunc ingentia cernis    moenia surgentemque novae Karthaginis arcem,    mercatique solum, facti de nomine Byrsam,    taurino quantum possent circumdare tergo.    Sed vos qui tandem, quibus aut venistis ab oris,    quove tenetis iter?  'Quaerenti talibus ille    suspirans, imoque trahens a pectore vocem:      'O dea, si prima repetens ab origine pergam,    et vacet annalis nostrorum audire laborum,    ante diem clauso componat Vesper Olympo.    Nos Troia antiqua, si vestras forte per auris    Troiae nomen iit, diversa per aequora vectos    forte sua Libycis tempestas adpulit oris.    Sum pius Aeneas, raptos qui ex hoste Penates    classe veho mecum, fama super aethera notus.    Italiam quaero patriam et genus ab Iove summo.    Bis denis Phrygium conscendi navibus aequor,    matre dea monstrante viam, data fata secutus;    vix septem convolsae undis Euroque supersunt.    Ipse ignotus, egens, Libyae deserta peragro,    Europa atque Asia pulsus.'  Nec plura querentem    passa Venus medio sic interfata dolore est:      'Quisquis es, haud, credo, invisus caelestibus auras    vitalis carpis, Tyriam qui adveneris urbem.    Perge modo, atque hinc te reginae ad limina perfer,    Namque tibi reduces socios classemque relatam    nuntio, et in tutum versis aquilonibus actam,    ni frustra augurium vani docuere parentes.    Aspice bis senos laetantis agmine cycnos,    aetheria quos lapsa plaga Iovis ales aperto    turbabat caelo; nunc terras ordine longo    aut capere, aut captas iam despectare videntur:    ut reduces illi ludunt stridentibus alis,    et coetu cinxere polum, cantusque dedere,    haud aliter puppesque tuae pubesque tuorum    aut portum tenet aut pleno subit ostia velo.    Perge modo, et, qua te ducit via, dirige gressum.'      Dixit, et avertens rosea cervice refulsit,    ambrosiaeque comae divinum vertice odorem    spiravere, pedes vestis defluxit ad imos,    et vera incessu patuit dea.  Ille ubi matrem    adgnovit, tali fugientem est voce secutus:    'Quid natum totiens, crudelis tu quoque, falsis    iudis imaginibus?  Cur dextrae iungere dextram    non datur, ac veras audire et reddere voces?'      Talibus incusat, gressumque ad moenia tendit:    at Venus obscuro gradientes aere saepsit,    et multo nebulae circum dea fudit amictu,"]]]
