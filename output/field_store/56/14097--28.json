A list of the deputations of conversion received by      Mohammad at Medina during A.H. IX and X                 li--lviii    32. All conversions, individual and tribal, were without any      compulsion                                                    lix    33. Mohammad was not favoured with circumstances round      him.

Mohammad's unwavering belief in his own mission and      his success show him to be a true prophet. Mohammad's      efforts established monotheism in Arabia. His      manly exertions, and his single handed perseverance.      The business and office of a prophet described. Sir W.      Muir and Stobart quoted                                 lxv--lxix    35. The reforms of Mohammad, his iconoclastic policy. The      redemption of Arabia from venal debauchery and infatuated      superstition.

Hughes, Marcus Dods, and      Stanley Poole refuted                            lxxviii--lxxxvii    37. Objections to the (1) Finality of the social reforms of      Mohammad, (2) positive precepts, (3) ceremonial law,      (4) morality, (5) want of adaptability to the varying      circumstances                                     lxxxvii--lxxxix    38. All these objections apply rather to the teaching of the      Mohammadan Common Law than to the Koran                        xc    39. (1) Finality of social reforms of Mohammad discussed.      Intermediary not to be considered final                  xc--xcii    40. (2) Positive precepts and (3) ceremonial law, pilgrimage,      _Kibla_, amount of alms, fasts, forms and attitude of      prayer, &c.: pretentious prayers and ostentatious      almsgiving                                            xcii--xcvii    41.

Verses from the Koran in support of the defensive character      of the wars                                                    25    18. What the above quoted verses show                              26    19. Justification of the Moslems in taking up arms against their      aggressors                                                     27    20. The first aggression after the Hegira was not on the part      of Mohammad                                                    28    21.

At Badr Mohammad came only in his defence                      33    26. The first aggression after the Hegira if from Mohammad,      might fairly be looked upon as retaliation                     34    _IV.--The Jews._    27. The Jews broke treaties                                     _ib._    28. Bani Kainukaa, Bani Nazeer, Khyber, and Ghatafan               35    29.

Mohammad never taught intolerance                              43    35. In what sense the wars were religious wars                     44    36. The alleged verses of intolerance explained                    45    37. Sir William Muir quoted                                        47    38. Comment on the above quotation                                 50    39. Object of Mohammad's wars                                      51    _VII.--The Ninth Chapter or Sura Barat._    40.

The nine alleged interceptions of the Koreish caravans         57    42. The interceptions were impossible under the circumstances      in which Mohammad was placed                                   59    43. The interceptions, if occurred, were justified by way of      reprisal                                                       60    _IX.--The alleged Assassinations._    44.
