Put your hat on, Albert, like a little  gentleman,' he added, placing the basin on his head. He took the  Puddin's hand, Sam took the other, and they all set off along the road.  A peculiar thing about the Puddin' was that, though they had all had a  great many slices off him, there was no sign of the place whence the  slices had been cut.    'That's where the Magic comes in,' explained Bill. 'The more you eats  the more you gets. Cut-an'-come-again is his name, an' cut, an' come  again, is his nature. Me an' Sam has been eatin' away at this Puddin'  for years, and there's not a mark on him. Perhaps,' he added, 'you would  like to hear how we came to own this remarkable Puddin'.'    'Nothing would please me more,' said Bunyip Bluegum.    'In that case,' said Bill, 'let her go for a song.'    [Illustration]      'Ho, the cook of the _Saucy Sausage_,      Was a feller called Curry and Rice,    A son of a gun as fat as a tun    With a face as round as a hot-cross bun,      Or a barrel, to be precise.      'One winter's morn we rounds the Horn,      A-rollin' homeward bound.    We strikes on the ice, goes down in a trice,    And all on board but Curry and Rice      And me an' Sam is drowned.    [Illustration]      'For Sam an' me an' the cook, yer see,      We climbs on a lump of ice,    And there in the sleet we suffered a treat    For several months from frozen feet,    With nothin' at all but ice to eat,      And ice does not suffice.      'And Sam and me we couldn't agree      With the cook at any price.    We was both as thin as a piece of tin    While that there cook was busting his skin      On nothin' to eat but ice.    [Illustration]      'Says Sam to me, \"It's a mystery      More deep than words can utter;    Whatever we do, here's me an' you,    Us both as thin as Irish stoo,      While he's as fat as butter.\"      'But late one night we wakes in fright      To see by a pale blue flare,    That cook has got in a phantom pot    A big plum-duff an' a rump-steak hot,    And the guzzlin' wizard is eatin' the lot,      On top of the iceberg bare.'    'There's a verse left out here,' said Bill, stopping the song, 'owin' to  the difficulty of explainin' exactly what happened, when me and Sam  discovered the deceitful nature of that cook. The next verse is as  follows--      'Now Sam an' me can never agree      What happened to Curry and Rice.    The whole affair is shrouded in doubt,    For the night was dark and the flare went out,    And all we heard was a startled shout,    Though I think meself, in the subsequent rout,    That us bein' thin, an' him bein' stout,    In the middle of pushin' an' shovin' about,      He--MUST HAVE FELL OFF THE ICE.'    'That won't do, you know,' began the Puddin', but Sam said hurriedly,  'It was very dark, and there's no sayin' at this date what happened.'    'Yes there is,' said the Puddin', 'for I had my eye on the whole affair,  and it's my belief that if he hadn't been so round you'd have never  rolled him off the iceberg, for you was both singin' out \"Yo heave Ho\"  for half an hour, an' him trying to hold on to Bill's beard.'    [Illustration]    'In the haste of the moment,' said Bill, 'he may have got a bit of a  shove, for the ice bein' slippy, and us bein' justly enraged, and him  bein' as round as a barrel, he may, as I said, have been too fat to save  himself from rollin' off the iceberg. The point, however, is immaterial  to our story, which concerns this Puddin'; and this Puddin',' said Bill  patting him on the basin, 'was the very Puddin' that Curry and Rice  invented on the iceberg.'    'He must have been a very clever cook,' said Bunyip.    'He was, poor feller, he was,' said Bill, greatly affected. 'For plum  duff or Irish stoo there wasn't his equal in the land. But enough of  these sad subjects. Pausin' only to explain that me an' Sam got off the  iceberg on a homeward bound chicken coop, landed on Tierra del Fuego,  walked to Valparaiso, and so got home, I will proceed to enliven the  occasion with \"The Ballad of the Bo'sun's Bride\".'    And without more ado, Bill, who had one of those beef-and-thunder  voices, roared out--      'Ho, aboard the _Salt Junk Sarah_      We was rollin' homeward bound,    When the bo'sun's bride fell over the side      And very near got drowned.    Rollin' home, rollin' home,    Rollin' home across the foam,      She had to swim to save her glim    And catch us rollin' home.'    It was a very long song, so the rest of it is left out here, but there  was a great deal of rolling and roaring in it, and they all joined in  the chorus. They were all singing away at the top of their pipe, as Bill  called it, when round a bend in the road they came on two low-looking  persons hiding behind a tree. One was a Possum, with one of those sharp,  snooting, snouting sort of faces, and the other was a bulbous,  boozy-looking Wombat in an old long-tailed coat, and a hat that marked  him down as a man you couldn't trust in the fowlyard. They were busy  sharpening up a carving knife on a portable grind-stone, but the moment  they caught sight of the travellers the Possum whipped the knife behind  him and the Wombat put his hat over the grindstone.    Bill Barnacle flew into a passion at these signs of treachery.    'I see you there,' he shouted.    'You can't see all of us,' shouted the Possum, and the Wombat added,  ''Cause why, some of us is behind the tree.'    [Illustration]    Bill led the others aside, in order to hold a consultation.    'What on earth's to be done?' he said.    'We shall have to fight them, as usual,' said Sam.    'Why do you have to fight them?' asked Bunyip Bluegum.    'Because they're after our Puddin',' said Bill.    'They're after our Puddin',' explained Sam, 'because they're  professional puddin'-thieves.'    'And as we're perfessional Puddin'-owners,' said Bill, 'we have to fight  them on principle. The fighting,' he added, 'is a mere flea-bite, as the  sayin' goes. The trouble is, what's to be done with the Puddin'?'    'While you do the fighting,' said Bunyip bravely, 'I shall mind the  Puddin'.'    'The trouble is,' said Bill, 'that this is a very secret, crafty  Puddin', an' if you wasn't up to his game he'd be askin' you to look at  a spider an' then run away while your back is turned.'    'That's right,' said the Puddin', gloomily. 'Take a Puddin's character  away. Don't mind his feelings.'    [Illustration]    'We don't mind your feelin's, Albert,' said Bill. 'What we minds is your  treacherous 'abits.' But Bunyip Bluegum said, 'Why not turn him  upside-down and sit on him?'    [Illustration]    'What a brutal suggestion,' said the Puddin'; but no notice was taken of  his objections, and as soon as he was turned safely upside-down, Bill  and Sam ran straight at the puddin'-thieves and commenced sparring up at  them with the greatest activity.    'Put 'em up, ye puddin'-snatchers,' shouted Bill. 'Don't keep us  sparrin' up here all day. Come out an' take your gruel while you've got  the chance.'    The Possum wished to turn the matter off by saying, 'I see the price of  eggs has gone up again', but Bill gave him a punch on the snout that  bent it like a carrot, and Sam caught the Wombat such a flip with his  flapper that he gave in at once.    'I shan't be able to fight any more this afternoon,' said the Wombat,  'as I've got sore feet.' The Possum said hurriedly, 'We shall be late  for that appointment', and they took their grindstone and off they went.    [Illustration]    But when they were a safe distance away the Possum sang out: 'You'll  repent this conduct. You'll repent bending a man's snout so that he can  hardly see over it, let alone breathe through it with comfort', and the  Wombat added, 'For shame, flapping a man with sore feet.'    'We laugh with scorn at threats,' said Bill, and he added as a warning--      'I don't repent a snout that's bent,      And if again I tap it,    Oh, with a clout I'll bend that snout      With force enough to snap it.'    and Sam added for the Wombat's benefit--      'I take no shame to fight the lame    When they deserve to cop it.    So do not try to pipe your eye,    Or with my flip I'll flop it.'    [Illustration]    The puddin'-thieves disappeared over the hill and, as the evening  happened to come down rather suddenly at that moment, Bill said,  'Business bein' over for the day, now's the time to set about makin' the  camp fire.'    This was a welcome suggestion, for, as all travellers know, if you don't  sit by a camp fire in the evening, you have to sit by nothing in the  dark, which is a most unsociable way of spending your time. They found a  comfortable nook under the hedge, where there were plenty of dry leaves  to rest on, and there they built a fire, and put the billy on, and made  tea. The tea and sugar and three tin cups and half a pound of mixed  biscuits were brought out of the bag by Sam, while Bill cut slices of  steak-and-kidney from the Puddin'. After that they had boiled jam-roll  and apple-dumpling, as the fancy took them, for if you wanted a change  of food from the Puddin', all you had to do was to whistle twice and  turn the basin round.    After they had eaten as much as they wanted, the things were put away in  the bag, and they settled down comfortably for the evening.    'This is what I call grand,' said Bill, cutting up his tobacco.  'Full-and-plenty to eat, pipes goin' and the evenin's enjoyment before  us. Tune up on the mouth-organ, Sam, an' off she goes with a song.'    They had a mouth-organ in the bag which they took turns at playing, and  Bill led off with a song which he said was called--    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    SPANISH GOLD      'When I was young I used to hold      I'd run away to sea,    And be a Pirate brave and bold      On the coast of Caribbee.

From their behaviour during  the many and varied processes through which they have passed he finds  out, with unerring accuracy, the exact proportions of their composition,  and, in many cases, the cause of their origin.    It may be thought that, knowing all this, it is strange that man does  not himself manufacture these rare gems, such as the diamond, but so far  he has only succeeded in making a few of microscopic size, altogether  useless except as scientific curiosities. The manner in which these  minute gems and spurious stones are manufactured, and the methods by  which they may readily be distinguished from real, will be dealt with in  due course.    The natural stones represent the slow chemical action of water, decay,  and association with, or near, other chemical substances or elements,  combined with the action of millions of years of time, and the unceasing  enormous pressure during that time of thousands, perhaps millions, of  tons of earth, rock, and the like, subjected, for a certain portion at  least of that period, to extremes of heat or cold, all of which  determine the nature of the gem. So that only in the earth itself,  under strictly natural conditions, can these rare substances be found at  all in any workable size; therefore they must be sought after  assiduously, with more or less speculative risk.          CHAPTER II.    THE ORIGIN OF PRECIOUS STONES.      Though the origin, formation, composition, characteristics and tests of  each stone will be examined in detail when dealing with the stones  seriatim, it is necessary to enquire into those particulars of origin  which are common to all, in order thoroughly to understand why they  differ from other non-metallic and metallic minerals.    At the very commencement we are faced with a subject on which  mineralogists and geologists are by no means in full agreement, and  there seems just ground for considerable divergence of opinion,  according to the line of argument taken. It is a most remarkable fact  that, precious as are certain stones, they do not (with a few  exceptions) contain any of the rarer metals, such as platinum, gold,  etc., or any of their compounds, but are composed entirely of the common  elements and their derivatives, especially of those elements contained  in the upper crust of the earth, and this notwithstanding the fact that  gems are often found deep down in the earth. This is very significant,  and points to the conclusion that these stones were formed by the slow  percolation of water from the surface through the deeper parts of the  earth, carrying with it, in solution or suspension, the chemical  constituents of the earth's upper crust; time and long-continued  pressure, combined with heat or cold, or perhaps both in turn, doing the  rest, as already mentioned.    The moisture falling in dew and rain becomes acidulated with carbonic  acid, CO_{2} (carbon dioxide), from the combustion and decay of organic  matter, vegetation, and other sources, and this moisture is capable of  dissolving certain calcareous substances, which it takes deep into the  earth, till the time comes when it enters perhaps a division-plane in  some rock, or some such cavity, and is unable to get away. The hollow  becomes filled with water, which is slowly more and more charged with  the salts brought down, till saturated; then super-saturated, so that  the salts become precipitated, or perhaps crystallised out, maybe by the  presence of more or other salts, or by a change in temperature. These  crystals then become packed hard by further supplies and pressure, till  eventually, after the lapse of ages, a natural gem is found, _exactly  filling_ the cavity, and is a precious find in many cases.    If now we try to find its analogy in chemistry, and for a moment  consider the curious behaviour of some well-known salts, under different  conditions of temperature, what is taking place underground ceases to be  mysterious and becomes readily intelligible.    Perhaps the best salt for the purpose, and one easy to obtain for  experiment, is the sulphate of sodium--known also as Glauber's Salt.    It is in large, colourless prisms, which may soon be dissolved in about  three parts of water, so long as the water does not exceed 60 deg. F., and  at this temperature a super-saturated solution may easily be made. But  if the water is heated the salt then becomes more and more insoluble as  the temperature increases, till it is completely insoluble.    If a super-saturated solution of this Glauber's Salt is made in a glass,  at ordinary atmospheric temperature, and into this cold solution,  without heating, is dropped a small crystal of the same salt, there will  be caused a rise in temperature, and the whole will then crystallise out  quite suddenly; the water will be absorbed, and the whole will solidify  into a mass which exactly fits the inner contour of the vessel.    We have now formed what _might_ be a precious stone, and no doubt would  be, if continuous pressure could be applied to it for perhaps a few  thousand years; at any rate, the formation of a natural jewel is not  greatly different, and after being subjected for a period, extending to  ages, to the washings of moisture, the contact of its containing bed  (its later matrix), the action of the changes in the temperature of the  earth in its vicinity, it emerges by volcanic eruption, earthquake,  landslip and the like, or is discovered as a rare and valuable specimen  of some simple compound of earth-crust and water, as simple as Glauber's  Salt, or as the pure crystallized carbon.    It is also curious to note that in some cases the stones have not been  caused by aqueous deposit in an already existing hollow, but the aqueous  infusion has acted on a portion of the rock on which it rested,  absorbing the rock, and, as it were, replacing it by its own substance.  This is evidenced in cases where gems have been found encrusted on their  matrix, which latter was being slowly transformed to the character of  the jewel encrusted, or \"scabbed\" on it.    The character of the matrix is also in a great measure the cause of the  variety of the stone, for it is obvious that the same salt-charged  aqueous solution which undergoes change in and on ironstone would result  in an entirely different product from that resting on or embedded in  silica.    Following out the explanation of the aqueous solution, in which the  earth-crust constituents are secreted, we find that the rarer and more  precious metals do not generally enter into the composition of precious  stones--which fact may advisedly be repeated. It is, of course, to be  expected that beryllium will be found in the emerald, since it is under  the species beryl, and zirconium in zircon; but such instances are the  exception, and we may well wonder at the actions of the infinite powers  of nature, when we reflect that the rarest, costliest and most beautiful  of all precious stones are the simplest in their constituents.    Thus we find the diamond standing unique amongst all gems in being  composed of one element only--carbon--being pure crystallised carbon; a  different form from graphite, it is true, but, nevertheless, pure carbon  and nothing else. Therefore, from its chemical, as well as from its  commercial aspect, the diamond stands alone as the most important of  gems.    The next in simplicity, whilst being the most costly of all, is the  ruby, and with this may be classed the blue sapphire, seeing that their  chemical constituents are exactly the same, the difference being one of  colour only. These have two elements, oxygen and aluminium, which  important constituents appear also in other stones, but this example is  sufficient to prove their simplicity of origin.    Another unique stone is the turquoise, in that it is the only rare gem  essentially containing a great proportion of water, which renders it  easily liable to destruction, as we shall see later. It is a combination  of alumina, water, and phosphoric acid, and is also unique in being the  only known valuable stone containing a phosphate.    Turning to the silica series, we again find a number of gems with two  elements only, silica--an important constituent of the earth's  crust--and oxygen--an important constituent of atmospheric air. In this  group may be mentioned the opal, amethyst, agate, rock-crystal, and the  like, as the best known examples, whilst oxygen appears also mostly in  the form of oxides, in chrysoberyl, spinel, and the like. This silica  group is extremely interesting, for in it, with the exception of the  tourmaline and a few others, the composition of the gems is very simple,  and we find in this group such stones as the chrysolite, several  varieties of topaz, the garnet, emerald, etc., etc.    Malachite and similar stones are more ornamental than precious, though  they come in the category of precious stones. These are the carbonate  series, containing much carbonic acid, and, as may be expected, a  considerable proportion of water in their composition, which water can,  of course, be dispelled by the application of heat, but to the  destruction of the stone.    From all this will be seen how strong is the theory of aqueous  percolation, for, given time and pressure, water charged with  earth-crust constituents appears to be the origin of the formation of  all precious stones; and all the precious stones known have, when  analysed, been found to be almost exclusively composed of  upper-earth-crust"]]]
