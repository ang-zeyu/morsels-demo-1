Leaving Stockholm by train in the evening, we travel all night in  comfortable sleeping-cars and arrive next morning at the southernmost  point of Sweden, the port of Trelleborg, where the sunlit waves sweep in  from the Baltic Sea.    Here we might expect to have done with railway travelling, and we rather  look for the guard to come and open the carriage doors and ask the  passengers to alight. Surely it is not intended that the train shall go  on right across the sea? Yet that is actually what happens. The same  train and the same carriages, which bore us out of Stockholm yesterday  evening, go calmly across the Baltic Sea, and we need not get out before  we arrive at Berlin. The section of the train which is to go on to  Germany is run by an engine on to a great ferry-boat moored to the quay  by heavy clamps and hooks of iron. The rails on Swedish ground are  closely connected with those on the ferry-boat, and when the carriages  are pushed on board by the engine, they are fastened with chains and  hooks so that they may remain quite steady even if the vessel begins to  roll. As the traveller lies dozing in his compartment, he will certainly  hear whistles and the rattle of iron gear and will notice that the  compartment suddenly becomes quite dark. But only when the monotonous  groaning and the constant vibration of the wheels has given place to a  gentle and silent heaving will he know that he is out on the Baltic Sea.    We are by no means content, however, to lie down and doze. Scarcely  have the carriages been anchored on the ferry-boat before we are on the  upper deck with its fine promenade. The ferry-boat is a handsome vessel,  370 feet long, brand-new and painted white everywhere. It is almost like  a first-class hotel. In the saloon the tables are laid, and Swedish and  German passengers sit in groups at breakfast. There are separate rooms  for coffee and smoking, for reading and writing; and we find a small  bookstall where a boy sells guidebooks, novels, and the Swedish and  German newspapers of the day.    [Illustration: MAP SHOWING JOURNEY FROM STOCKHOLM TO BERLIN.]    The ferry-boat is now gliding out of the harbour, and every minute that  passes carries us farther from our native land. Now the whole town of  Trelleborg is displayed before our eyes, its warehouses and new  buildings, its chimneys and the vessels in the harbour. The houses  become smaller, the land narrows down to a strip on the horizon, and at  last there is nothing to be seen but a dark cloud of smoke rising from  the steamers and workshops. We steam along a fairway rich in memories,  and over a sea which has witnessed many wonderful exploits and  marvellous adventures. Among the wreckage and fragments at its bottom  sleep vikings and other heroes who fought for their country; but to-day  peace reigns over the Baltic, and Swedes, Danes, Russians, and Germans  share in the harvest of the sea. Yet still, as of yore, the autumn  storms roll the slate-grey breakers against the shores; and still on  bright summer days the blue waves glisten, silvered by the sun.    Four hours fly past all too quickly, and before we have become  accustomed to the level expanses of the sea a strip of land appears to  starboard. This is Ruegen, the largest island of Germany, lifting its  white chalk cliffs steeply from the sea, like surf congealed into stone.  The ferry-boat swings round in a beautiful curve towards the land, and  in the harbour of Sassnitz its rails are fitted in exactly to the  railway track on German soil. We hasten to take our seats in the  carriages, for in a few minutes the German engine comes up and draws the  train on to the land of Ruegen.    The monotonous grind of iron on iron begins again, and the coast and the  ferry-boat vanish behind us. Ruegen lies as flat as a pancake on the  Baltic Sea, and the train takes us through a landscape which reminds us  of Sweden. Here grow pines and spruces, here peaceful roe-deer jump and  roam about without showing the slightest fear of the noise of the engine  and the drone of the carriages.    Another ferry takes us over the narrow sound which separates Ruegen from  the mainland, and we see through the window the towers and spires and  closely-packed houses of Stralsund. Every inch of ground around us has  once been Swedish. In this neighbourhood Gustavus Adolphus landed with  his army, and in Stralsund Charles XII. passed a year of his adventurous  life.    In the twilight the train carries us southwards through Pomerania, and  before we reach Brandenburg the autumn evening has shrouded the North  German lowland in darkness. The country is flat and monotonous; not a  hill, hardly even an insignificant mound, rises above the level expanse.  Yet the land has a peculiar attraction for the stranger from Sweden. He  thinks of the time when Swedish gun-carriages splashed and dashed  through the mud before the winter frost made their progress still more  difficult and noisy. He thinks of heroic deeds and brave men, of early  starts, and horses neighing with impatience at the reveille; of  victories and honourable peaces, and of the captured flags at home.    If he is observant he will find many other remembrances in the North  German low country. Boulders of Swedish granite lie scattered over the  plain. They stand out like milestones and mark the limits of the  extension of the Scandinavian inland ice. During a colder period of the  world's history all northern Europe was covered with a coat of ice, and  this period is called the Ice Age. No one knows why the ice embraced  Scandinavia and the adjacent countries and swept in a broad stream over  the Baltic Sea. And no one knows why the climate afterwards became  warmer and drier, and forced the ice to melt away and gradually to leave  the ground bare. But we know for a fact that the boulders in northern  Germany were carried there on the back of an immense ice stream, for  they are composed of rocks which occur only in Scandinavia. The ice tore  them away from the solid mountains; during its slow movement southwards  it carried them with it, and when it melted the blocks were left on the  spot.    At last points of light begin to flash by like meteors in the night.  They become more and more numerous, and finally come whole rows and  clusters of electric lamps and lighted windows. We are passing through  the suburbs of a huge city, one of the largest in the world and the  third largest in Europe--Berlin.      BERLIN    If we spread out on the table a map of Europe on which all the railways  are indicated by black lines, the map will look like a net with  irregular meshes. At all the knots are towns, large centres of  population which are in constant communication with one another by means  of the railways. If we fix our eyes on North Germany, we see what looks  like an enormous spider's web, and in the middle of it sits a huge  spider.

Come to the end of the garden, and let me show you the view down  into the valley.\"    She had conquered her fit of merriment, but her face wore a settled look  of mischief, and she was evidently the possessor of some secret joke.  She seemed in capital health and spirits, and had so much to say that  was bright and interesting that Oswald Everard found himself becoming  reconciled to the whole race of tuners. He was amazed to learn that she  had walked all the way from Z----, and quite alone, too.    \"Oh, I don't think anything of that,\" she said; \"I had a splendid time,  and I caught four rare butterflies. I would not have missed those for  anything. As for the going about by myself, that is a second nature.  Besides, I do not belong to any one. That has its advantages, and I  suppose its disadvantages; but at present I have only discovered the  advantages. The disadvantages will discover themselves!\"    \"I believe you are what the novels call an advanced young woman,\" he  said. \"Perhaps you give lectures on woman's suffrage, or something of  that sort?\"    \"I have very often mounted the platform,\" she answered. \"In fact, I am  never so happy as when addressing an immense audience. A most unfeminine  thing to do, isn't it? What would the lady yonder in the horse-cloth  dress and billycock hat say? Don't you think you ought to go and help  her drive away the goat? She looks so frightened. She interests me  deeply. I wonder whether she has written an essay on the feminine in  woman. I should like to read it; it would do me so much good.\"    \"You are at least a true woman,\" he said, laughing, \"for I see you can  be spiteful. The tuning has not driven that away.\"    \"Ah, I had forgotten about the tuning,\" she answered, brightly; \"but now  you remind me, I have been seized with a great idea.\"    \"Won't you tell it to me?\" he asked.    \"No,\" she answered; \"I keep my great ideas for myself, and work them out  in secret. And this one is particularly amusing. What fun I shall have!\"    \"But why keep the fun to yourself?\" he said. \"We all want to be amused  here; we all want to be stirred up; a little fun would be a charity.\"    \"Very well, since you wish it, you shall be stirred up,\" she answered;  \"but you must give me time to work out my great idea. I do not hurry  about things, not even about my professional duties; for I have a  strong feeling that it is vulgar to be always amassing riches! As I have  neither a husband nor a brother to support, I have chosen less wealth,  and more leisure to enjoy all the loveliness of life! So you see I take  my time about everything. And to-morrow I shall catch butterflies at my  leisure, and lie among the dear old pines, and work at my great idea.\"    \"I shall catch butterflies,\" said her companion; \"and I too shall lie  among the dear old pines.\"    \"Just as you please,\" she said; and at that moment the _table d'hote_  bell rang.    The little girl hastened to the bureau, and spoke rapidly in German to  the cashier.    \"_Ach, Fraulein_!\" he said. \"You are not really serious?\"    \"Yes, I am,\" she said. \"I don't want them to know my name. It will only  worry me. Say I am the young lady who tuned the piano.\"    She had scarcely given these directions and mounted to her room when  Oswald Everard, who was much interested in his mysterious companion,  came to the bureau, and asked for the name of the little lady.    \"_Es ist das Fraulein welches das Piano gestimmt hat_,\" answered the  man, returning with unusual quickness to his account-book.    No one spoke to the little girl at _table d'hote_, but for all that she  enjoyed her dinner, and gave her serious attention to all the courses.  Being thus solidly occupied, she had not much leisure to bestow on the  conversation of the other guests. Nor was it specially original; it  treated of the short-comings of the chef, the tastelessness of the  soup, the toughness of the beef, and all the many failings which go  to complete a mountain hotel dinner. But suddenly, so it seemed to the  little girl, this time-honoured talk passed into another phase; she  heard the word \"music\" mentioned, and she became at once interested to  learn what these people had to say on a subject which was dearer to her  than any other.    \"For my own part,\" said a stern-looking old man, \"I have no words to  describe what a gracious comfort music has been to me all my life. It is  the noblest language which man may understand and speak. And I sometimes  think that those who know it, or know something of it, are able at rare  moments to find an answer to life's perplexing problems.\"    The little girl looked up from her plate. Robert Browning's words rose  to her lips, but she did not give them utterance:         God has a few of us whom He whispers in the ear;       The rest may reason, and welcome; 'tis we musicians know.    \"I have lived through a long life,\" said another elderly man, \"and have  therefore had my share of trouble; but the grief of being obliged to  give up music was the grief which held me longest, or which perhaps has  never left me. I still crave for the gracious pleasure of touching once  more the strings of the violoncello, and hearing the dear, tender voice  singing and throbbing, and answering even to such poor skill as mine.  I still yearn to take my part in concerted music, and be one of those  privileged to play Beethoven's string-quartettes. But that will have to  be in another incarnation, I think.\"    He glanced at his shrunken arm, and then, as though ashamed of this  allusion to his own personal infirmity, he added hastily:    \"But when the first pang of such a pain is over, there remains the  comfort of being a listener. At first one does not think it is a  comfort; but as time goes on there is no resisting its magic influence.  And Lowell said rightly that 'one of God's great charities is music.'\"    \"I did not know you were musical, Mr. Keith,\" said an English lady. \"You  have never before spoken of music.\"    \"Perhaps not, madam,\" he answered. \"One does not often speak of what one  cares for most of all. But when I am in London I rarely miss hearing our  best players.\"    At this point others joined in, and the various merits of eminent  pianists were warmly discussed.    \"What a wonderful name that little English lady has made for herself!\"  said the major, who was considered an authority on all subjects. \"I would  go anywhere to hear Miss Thyra Flowerdew. We all ought to be very proud  of her. She has taken even the German musical world by storm, and they  say her recitals at Paris have been brilliantly successful. I myself  have heard her at New York, Leipsic, London, Berlin, and even Chicago.\"    The little girl stirred uneasily in her chair.    \"I don't think Miss Flowerdew has ever been to Chicago,\" she said.    There was a dead silence. The admirer of Miss Thyra Flowerdew looked  much annoyed, and twiddled his watch-chain. He had meant to say  \"Philadelphia,\" but he did not think it necessary to own to his mistake.    \"What impertinence!\" said one of the ladies to Miss Blake. \"What can she  know about it? Is she not the young person who tuned the piano?\"    \"Perhaps she tunes Miss Thyra Flowerdew's piano!\" suggested Miss Blake,  in a loud whisper.    \"You are right, madam,\" said the little girl, quietly. \"I have often  tuned Miss Flowerdew's piano.\"    There was another embarrassing silence; and then a lovely old lady, whom  every one reverenced, came to the rescue.    \"I think her playing is simply superb,\" she said. \"Nothing that I ever  hear satisfies me so entirely. She has all the tenderness of an angel's  touch.\"    \"Listening to her,\" said the major, who had now recovered from his  annoyance at being interrupted, \"one becomes unconscious of her  presence, for she _is the music itself_. And that is rare. It is but  seldom nowadays that we are allowed to forget the personality of the  player. And yet her personality is an unusual one; having once seen her,  it would not be easy to forget her. I should recognise her anywhere.\"    As he spoke, he glanced at the little tuner, and could not help admiring  her dignified composure under circumstances which might have been  distressing to any one; and when she rose with the others he followed  her, and said stiffly:    \"I regret that I was the indirect cause of putting you in an awkward  position.\"    \"It is really of no consequence,\" she said, brightly. \"If you think I  was impertinent, I ask your forgiveness. I did not mean to be officious.  The words were spoken before I was aware of them.\"    She passed into the salon, where she found a quiet corner for herself,  and read some of the newspapers. No one took the slightest notice of  her; not a word was spoken to her; but when she relieved the company of  her presence her impertinence was commented on.    \"I am sorry that she heard what I said,\" remarked Miss Blake; \"but she  did not seem to mind. These young women who go out into the world lose  the edge of their sensitiveness and femininity. I have always observed  that.\"    \"How much they are spared then!\" answered some one.    Meanwhile the little girl slept soundly. She had merry dreams, and  finally woke up laughing. She hurried over her breakfast, and then  stood ready to go for a butterfly hunt. She looked thoroughly happy,  and evidently had found, and was holding tightly, the key to life's  enjoyment.    Oswald Everard was waiting on the balcony, and he reminded her that he  intended to go with her.    \"Come along then,\" she answered; \"we must not lose a moment.\"    They caught butterflies; they picked flowers; they ran; they lingered  by the wayside; they sang; they climbed, and he marvelled at her easy  speed. Nothing seemed to tire her, and everything seemed to delight  her--the flowers, the birds, the clouds, the grasses, and the fragrance  of the pine woods.    \"Is it not good to live?\" she cried. \""]]]
