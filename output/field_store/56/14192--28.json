A fair wind conveyed us in six hours from Poole to Cherbourg. It was dusk  when we entered the harbour, and so we had no opportunity of seeing its  beauty until the following morning, when we ascended a height behind the  town, called the Mont du Roule. It is reached either on foot or by  carriage, the Emperor having ordered a road to be made up to the fort  which crowns the heights, on the occasion of the visit to Cherbourg, in  1858, of her Majesty Queen Victoria. Some 1500 men were immediately set to  work, and, in a few days, an easy carriage-road was finished, up which the  Emperor drove the Queen at his usual rapid pace. The view from the fort is  lovely, commanding the whole line of the northern point of the Cotentin,  from the low promontory of Cape de la Hogue to Barfleur. The water of the  harbour, owing to its great depth, is of the most intense blue, which we  quite agreed with the guardian of the fort in likening to that of the Bay  of Naples. Across its entrance stretches, for two miles, the long line of  the breakwater, and within were anchored the fleet of our yacht squadron,  which the day before had run a race between Poole and Cherbourg. We took a  boat to visit the breakwater. It is commanded at each end by a fort, with  another in the centre, where the provisions are kept. In stormy weather  the sea washes over the breakwater, and sometimes for days prevents all  communication between the forts, and the supplies consequently are  stopped. Boys offered us for sale the silvery shells of the Venus' ear,  which inhabits the rocks of the breakwater. We afterwards saw them in the  fish-market exposed for sale, and, on expressing some curiosity as to how  they were eaten, the landlord had a dish prepared for us. These fish  resemble the scallop in taste, but are very tough, and require a great  deal of beating with a wooden mallet to make them tender enough to eat.  They are called \"ormer,\" or \"gofish.\" The table d'hote was very  plentifully supplied with fish, and here, as throughout Normandy and  Brittany, cider, the customary beverage of the country, was always placed  upon the table. It varies very much in quality in different districts;  that of Bayeux is most esteemed.    The next morning we set out for the dockyard. To obtain admission, it  first requires a letter from the English Consul, who lives in a charming  spot overlooking the sea, at the foot of the Montagne du Roule. Furnished  with this, we repaired to the Prefet Maritime, who gave us an order to be  presented at the dockyard gate, where it was countersigned, and a guide  appointed to show us over the establishment. We made the tour round all  the basins and workshops, and saw the canot imperial used by the Emperor  on the visit of our Queen,--a most elegant boat, beautifully carved with  marine subjects. The model of a Roman trireme, or galley, is in one of the  basins, and in the little museum, or Salle des Modeles, are the two  flagstones that covered the grave of Napoleon, and were deposited here by  the Prince de Joinville, when he returned with the Emperor's remains from  St. Helena. The dockyard partly stands on a spot called Chantereyne. The  Empress Matilda, fleeing from Stephen, was overtaken by a tempest when  making for Cherbourg, and vowed, if her life were spared, to build a  church. The ship was in jeopardy, but the pilot cheered her spirits, and,  when gaining the port, exclaimed, \"Chantes Reine! we are safe in harbour.\"  The place where she landed has always retained the name; and here the  Empress, in fulfilment of her vow, founded an abbey, which was destroyed  in the Revolution. The habitations of the nuns is the present provisional  Hopital de la Marine; a new one, containing above a thousand beds, being  in course of construction, and a modern church, called Eglise du Voeu, has  been erected in another part of the town in place of that of the Empress  Matilda.    Henry II. held his court in the castle with his empress-mother in great  splendour; it had formerly been tenanted by Duke William of Normandy  before his invasion of England, and, within its enclosure, he built a  church also, in consequence of a vow made during a serious illness. There  are few objects of interest in the town of Cherbourg. The women all wear  the large Normandy cap. In the Place d'Armes is a bronze equestrian statue  of the Emperor Napoleon I., and on the pedestal is inscribed \"J'avois  resolu de renouveler a Cherbourg les merveilles de l'Egypte.\"  In the  Library is a curiously sculptured chimney-piece of the fifteenth century,  coloured and gilt, removed from a room of the abbey. The principal church,  La Trinite, is a strange jumble of architecture. There is some beautiful  tracery in the windows, and a fine boss (clef pendante) in the south  porch, now restored. On a board in the church is an inscription, setting  forth it was built in consequence of a \"voeu solennel des habitans de  Cherbourg en 1450 de la delivrance de la domination etrangere\"--that is,  from the English, whose defeat the same year at Formigny, by the Constable  de Richemont, expelled them for ever from Normandy.    There is much to see in the environs of Cherbourg, which makes it a good  central point for excursions. We drove by the fort of Octeville, where a  magnificent panoramic view is obtained, equalling in extent that from the  Mont du Roule. A fisherman, who was standing by, told us the names of the  numerous forts that bristle in every direction, and related to us the  legend of the monk of Saire, who, having received the rent due to his  father for some land, appropriated the money to his own use, and, on the  tenant declaring he had paid the sum, adjured the evil one to carry him  off, if he had ever received the money. The words were no sooner uttered  than there came a flash of lightning, and the monk vanished: but he still  appears in the roads of Cherbourg floating on the sea; when he sees a  sailor, he cries \"Save me, save me! I am about to sink!\" but the hapless  being who approaches to assist him is immediately dragged into the water,  a peal of infernal laughter is heard, and the luckless mariner disappears  for ever. We asked our guide if he believed in the phantom monk, but he  was silent.    [Illustration: 1. Querqueville Church.]    From Octeville we proceeded to Querqueville, where, in the same churchyard  as the parochial church, stands a little church, named after St. Germain,  the first apostle of the Cotentin, who, in the fifth century, landed from  England on the coast of La Hogue, and preached Christianity in this  district and the valley traversed by the river Saire, which falls into the  sea near St. Vaast-la-Hogue. This tiny church, for it measures only 34  feet by 24, and is 11 feet high, is by some supposed to have been a temple  of the Gauls converted into a Christian place of worship; the nave and  tower having been added to the old temple, which consists of a triple apse  forming a regular trefoil, each of which has a domed top. We drove on to  Nacqueville, the chateau of Comte Hippolyte de Tocqueville. The park is  prettily laid out, a stream of water runs in front of the house, and a row  of blue hydrangeas blazed forth in great beauty, with the relief of a  background of dark firs. Time prevented us from pursuing our excursion  further west, to see the famed cliffs of Jobourg.    [Illustration: 2. Plan of Querqueville Church.]    To the east of Cherbourg a high road leads to Barfleur and the lighthouse  of Gatteville, between which and the Isle of Wight is the narrowest point  of the English Channel, passing by Saint-Pierre-Eglise, near which is the  chateau of the late Alexis de Tocqueville, author of 'Democracy in  America;' but we did not get further on the road than Tourlaville, the  ancient chateau of the Ravalet family, upon whom tradition has heaped  every crime imaginable. One seigneur entered the church with his hounds  and "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22716"],[0,"The Book-Hunter at Home (#2)"],[1,"he awoke sane and conscious of his folly. An early visit to  the bookstall followed, but the little volume had gone; and it was not  comforting to learn that it had been sold shortly after our bookman saw  it, to a man who 'knew a lot about that kind of books.' Let us hope that  the purchaser treasures the little square volume, printed in italics, as  much as our friend would.    What poignant memories they are, these memories of rare books which we  have found and failed to secure! Two prominent instances of our bookman's  folly stand out with bitter clearness, ever fresh in his memory as a  reminder of the criminal stupidity of procrastination. One was an  exceedingly scarce work by Lawrence Humphrey, entitled 'Optimates sive De  Nobilitate eiusque Antiqua Origine,' printed in small octavo at Basle in  1560, which he once saw in a catalogue for five shillings. He sent for it  three days after the receipt of the catalogue, and of course it had gone.  The other was an unknown, or at least undescribed, edition of Osorio's  'De Gloria et Nobilitate,' printed at Barcelona in the early part of the  sixteenth century. He lost this in the same manner, at two shillings!  Perhaps, however, you too have been guilty of these lapses, reader?  _Semel insanivimus omnes._ Experience is better than advice, and for his  part our book-hunter will not be caught napping again. The following  incident will show you, moreover, that it is not always safe to order  books from a catalogue even by return of post.    For many years he had searched in vain for that rarest of all English  heraldry books (though not properly English, for it is in the Latin  tongue), the 'De Studio Militari, Libri Quatuor' of Master Nicholas  Upton. It was edited by Sir Edward Bysshe, and printed in folio at London  in 1654. The numerous booksellers in London and the country from whom he  sought it had never seen it; indeed, most of them were unaware of its  existence, though it is well known to all heralds.    At length, coming home late one night, our book-hunter found on his table  a catalogue from a bookseller who seems to garner more out-of-the-way  books than any of his fellows. His catalogues are issued very frequently,  for he has a large and quick sale, pricing most of his wares at less than  five shillings. Moreover, the fact that the books described therein are  thrown together without any attempt at classification, even alphabetical,  serves but to add a zest to the repast. But our book-hunter was tired,  and his evil star was in the ascendant, for he went to bed leaving the  catalogue unopened.    Reading it over a late breakfast next morning, upon the last page he came  across the following entry:--         Uptoni (Nich.) De Studio Militari. Johan de Bado Aureo, Tractatus       de Armis. Henrici Spelmanni Aspilogia. Folio, calf. _Scarce._ 8s.       6d.    Scarce, indeed! In less than five minutes he was driving hot-haste to the  shop.    Of course it was sold: sold by _telegram dispatched the night before_. He  was allowed to see it, even to handle it, and he frankly confesses that  murderous thoughts rose within him as he held it in his hands. . . . The  bookseller was an old man . . . the shop was very dark . . . just a push,  and perhaps one firm application _super caput_ of a large-paper copy of  Camden's 'Britannia' which lay handy upon the table. . . . But I am glad  to say that our bookman's better nature prevailed, and sorrowfully he  returned the volume to the dealer's hands. Did he know the customer, and  if so would he try to buy it back? Certainly he would. A week later came  a letter saying that the customer was also a collector of these things,  but that he was willing to part with it 'at a price.' Unfortunately his  price was not our book-hunter's, and he failed to secure the  treasure--then.    Now comes the more pleasant sequel. About a year later, coming home in  the small hours from a dance, our bookman found a catalogue from this  same bookseller on his table. Although tired out, his previous bitter  experience had taught him a lesson; so pulling up a chair before the  remains of the fire he proceeded to skim through the catalogue. He had  reached the last page, and was already beginning to nod, when suddenly  his weariness vanished in a flash: he was wide awake and on his feet in  an instant, for his eyes had met the same entry that had thrilled him a  year ago. This time it was described as 'very scarce,' and the price was  considerably enhanced; but he had his coat on and was in the street  almost immediately.    The nearest telegraph office likely to be open at such an hour was a mile  away, and it was a miserable night, snowing and blowing; but no weather  would have deterred him. So the telegram was safely dispatched, and he  returned to bed, pinning a notice on the bedroom door to the effect that  he was to be called, without fail, at seven o'clock.    That night he was obsessed by Uptons of all shapes and sizes. Some he  beheld with agony, cut down by the ruthless binder to duodecimo size;  others there were no larger than Pickering's Diamond Classics; some (on  his chest) were of a size which I can only describe as 'Atlas,' or,  perhaps more appropriately, 'Elephant Folio,' large-paper copies with  hideous margins.    Next morning our bookman was at the shop betimes. Yes! his wire had  arrived; Upton was his at last! Should the dealer send it for him by  carrier? Carrier, forsooth! As well entrust the Koh-i-noor to a messenger  boy. Of course it was the same copy that our friend had missed  previously, the owner having sold his books _en bloc_ in the meantime.    Why Upton is so scarce it is hard to say; perhaps very few copies were  printed, or perhaps a fire at the printer's destroyed most of them.  Certain it is that the premises of James Allestry and Roger Norton, who  published the book, were both burnt in the great fire twelve years after  its publication. Besides the two copies in the British Museum, there are  examples of it in several of the ancient libraries throughout the  kingdom; but it is very rarely indeed to be met with in the London  salerooms.[1] Dallaway mentions two copies as being, in 1793, in the  library of Lord Carlisle at Naworth; and probably there are examples in  some of the libraries of our older nobility. There would seem to be  copies, also, in France; for several writers upon chivalry, such as La  Roque and Sainte Marie, make mention of it. The writer bought a portion  of it, some forty-eight pages, a few years ago for four shillings. But  take heart, brother bibliophile; it is quite possible that you may  unearth a copy some day--if indeed the book be in your line--long buried  in the dust of some old country bookshop.    Upton died in 1457, and his work was so popular that numerous copies of  the manuscript were made. The treatise on coat-armour, or 'cootarmuris,'  as it is quaintly spelt, which comprises the third part of the 'Book of  Saint Albans' (first printed in 1486), is, for the greater part, a  literal translation of the second half of the fourth book of the 'De  Studio Militari' as printed by Bysshe. Ames, in his 'Typographical  Antiquities,' asserts that Upton's work was reprinted from the St.  Albans book in folio, 1496, 'with the King's Arms and Caxton's mark  printed in red ink.' But he gives no authority for his assertion, and it  seems doubtful whether such a volume ever existed. At all events there  does not appear to be any trace of such a book beyond this mention, and  Herbert, editing Ames, omitted the whole passage. Hain,[2] probably  copying Ames, calls this supposititious work 'De Re Heraldica,' and  states that it was printed at Westminster in 1496 'Anglice.' So much for  worthy Master Nicholas, Canon of Salisbury and protege of the 'good duke  Humfrey.'    There is a curious phenomenon of not infrequent occurrence among  book-collectors, and that is the enforced acquisition of certain volumes  solely by means of the passive persuasion of their presence. In other  words, it is possible to bully the bibliophile into purchasing a book  merely by obtruding it continually before his gaze, till at length its  very presence becomes a source of annoyance to him. To escape from this  incubus he purchases the volume.    In nine cases out of ten, books so acquired never attain the same status  as their fellow-volumes. They are invariably assigned either to the  lowest or topmost shelves of the library, and are, in fact, pariahs.  Their owner did not really want them, and he can never quite forgive  their presence on his shelves. Generally their stay in any one home is  not a long one, for they are weeded out at the first opportunity, and  find no permanent rest until they come finally to that ultimate goal of  books, the paper mills. I confess that in my early days of  collecting this phenomenon was of not infrequent occurrence, being  associated, probably, with the indecision of youth. And in this  connection a bookseller once told me an interesting story.    A certain young man of the working class, on his way to work every day,  used to pass a bookstall situated in a narrow alley. Every day he glanced  at the books, and as custom was scanty he would notice what books were  sold and with what works the bookseller filled the empty places on the  shelves. In this way all of the books which the young man had first  noticed gradually disappeared, with one exception. This was a volume  bound in calf, containing some rather curious poems, and no one seemed to  want it. At length, after some weeks, the young man could stand it no  longer. He approached the bookseller, and for sixpence the volume became  his.    The verses seemed to him rather poor, though one entitled 'Hans Carvel'  amused him rather. The title-page bore the date 1707, and he wondered who  was the 'E. Curll at the Peacock without Temple-Bar,' for whom the work  was printed. Some time afterwards he"]]]
