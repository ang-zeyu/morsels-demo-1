But no--Mr  Thompson was a more experienced traveller than his companions thought  him at first.  The contents of the hat-case were sundry brushes--  including one for the teeth--combs, razors, and pieces of soap.  The hat  had been left at Saint Louis.    But the umbrella had _not_.  It was then under Thompson's arm, with its  full proportions of whalebone and gingham.  Under that umbrella he had  hunted tigers in the jungles of India--under that umbrella he had chased  the lion upon the plains of Africa--under that umbrella he had pursued  the ostrich and the vicuna over the pampas of South America; and now  under that same hemisphere of blue gingham he was about to carry terror  and destruction among the wild buffaloes of the prairies.    Besides the umbrella--strictly a weapon of defence--Mr Thompson carried  another, a heavy double-barrelled gun, marked \"Bishop, of Bond Street,\"  no bad weapon with a loading of buck-shot, and with this both barrels  were habitually loaded.    So much for Mr Thompson, who may pass for Number 1 of the hunting  party.  He was mounted on a strong bay cob, with tail cut short, and  English saddle, both of which objects--the short tail and the saddle--  were curiosities to all of the party except Mr Thompson and myself.    Number 2 was as unlike Number 1 as two animals of the same species could  possibly be.  He was a Kentuckian, full six inches taller than Thompson,  or indeed than any of the party.  His features were marked, prominent  and irregular, and this irregularity was increased by a \"cheekful\" of  half-chewed tobacco.  His complexion was dark, almost olive, and the  face quite naked, without either moustache or whisker; but long straight  hair, black as an Indian's, hung down to his shoulders.  In fact, there  was a good deal of the Indian look about him, except in his figure.  That was somewhat slouched, with arms and limbs of over-length, loosely  hung about it.  Both, however, though not modelled after the Apollo,  were evidently full of muscle and tough strength, and looked as though  their owner could return the hug of a bear with interest.  There was a  gravity in his look, but that was not from any gravity of spirits; it  was his swarth complexion that gave him this appearance, aided, no  doubt, by several lines of \"ambeer\" proceeding from the corners of his  mouth in the direction of the chin.  So far from being grave, this dark  Kentuckian was as gay and buoyant as any of the party.  Indeed, a light  and boyish spirit is a characteristic of the Kentuckian as well as of  all the natives of the Mississippi Valley--at least such has been my  observation.    Our Kentuckian was costumed just as he would have been upon a cool  morning riding about the \"woodland\" of his own plantation, for a  \"planter\" he was.  He wore a \"Jeans\" frock, and over that a long-tailed  overcoat of the best green blanket, with side pockets and flaps.  His  jeans pantaloons were stuck into a pair of heavy horse-leather pegged  boots, sometimes known as \"nigger\" boots; but over these were \"wrappers\"  of green baize, fastened with a string above the knees.  His hat was a  \"broad-brimmed felt,\" costly enough, but somewhat crushed by being sat  upon and slept in.  He bestrode a tall raw-boned stood that possessed  many of the characteristics of the rider; and in the same proportion  that the latter overtopped his companions, so did the steed out-size all  the other horses of the cavalcade.  Over the shoulders of the Kentuckian  were suspended, by several straps, pouch, horn, and haversack, and  resting upon his toe was the butt of a heavy rifle, the muzzle of which  reached to a level with his shoulder.    He was a rich Kentucky planter, and known in his native state as a great  deer-hunter.  Some business or pleasure had brought him to Saint Louis.  It was hinted that Kentucky was becoming too thickly settled for him--  deer becoming scarce, and bear hardly to be found--and that his visit to  Saint Louis had something to do with seeking a new \"location\" where  these animals were still to be met with in greater plenty.  The idea of  buffalo-hunting was just to his liking.  The expedition would carry him  through the frontier country, where he might afterwards choose his  \"location\"--at all events the sport would repay him, and he was one of  the most enthusiastic in regard to it.    He that looms up on the retrospect of my memory as Number 3 was as  unlike the Kentuckian, as the latter was to Thompson.  He was a disciple  of Esculapius--not thin and pale, as these usually are, but fat, red,  and jolly.  I think he was originally a \"Yankee,\" though his long  residence in the Western States had rubbed the Yankee out of him to a  great extent.  At all events he had few of their characteristics about  him.  He was neither staid, sober, nor, what is usually alleged as a  trait of the true bred Yankee, \"stingy.\"  On the contrary, our doctor  was full of talk and joviality--generous to a fault.  A fault, indeed;  for, although many years in practice in various parts of the United  States, and having earned large sums of money, at the date of our  expedition we found him in Saint Louis almost without a dollar, and with  no great stock of patients.  The truth must be told; the doctor was of a  restless disposition, and liked his glass too well.  He was a singer  too, a fine amateur singer, with a voice equal to Mario's.  That may  partly account for his failure in securing a fortune.  He was a  favourite with all--ladies included--and so fond of good company, that  he preferred the edge of the jovial board to the bed-side of a patient.    Not from any fondness for buffalo-hunting, but rather through an  attachment to some of the company, had the doctor volunteered.  Indeed,  he was solicited by all to make one of us--partly on account of his  excellent society, and partly that his professional services might be  called into requisition before our return.    The doctor still preserved his professional costume of black--somewhat  russet by long wear--but this was modified by a close-fitting fur cap,  and wrappers of brown cloth, which he wore around his short thick legs.  He was not over-well mounted--a very spare little horse was all he had,  as his funds would not stretch to a better.  It was quite a quiet one,  however, and carried the doctor and his \"medical saddle-bags\" steadily  enough, though not without a good deal of spurring and whipping.  The  doctor's name was \"Jopper\"--Dr John Jopper.    A very elegant youth, with fine features, rolling black eyes, and  luxuriant curled hair, was one of us.  The hands were well formed and  delicate; the complexion silky, and of nearly an olive tint; but the  purplish-red broke through upon his cheeks, giving the earnest of  health, as well as adding to the picturesque beauty of his face.  The  form was perfect, and full of manly expression, and the pretty sky-blue  plaited pantaloons and close-fitting jacket of the same material, sat  gracefully on his well-turned limbs and arms.  These garments were of  \"cottonade,\" that beautiful and durable fabric peculiar to Louisiana,  and so well suited to the southern climate.  A costly Panama hat cast  its shadow over the wavy curls and pictured cheek of this youth, and a  cloak of fine broad cloth, with velvet facings, hung loosely from his  shoulders.  A slight moustache and imperial lent a manlier expression to  his chiselled features.    This young fellow was a Creole of Louisiana--a student of one of the  Jesuit Colleges of that State--and although very unlike what would be  expected from such a dashing personage, he was an ardent, even  passionate, lover of nature.  Though still young, he was the most  accomplished botanist in his State, and had already published several  discoveries in the _Flora_ of the South.    Of course the expedition was to him a delightful anticipation.  It would  afford the finest opportunity for prosecuting his favourite study in a  new field; one as yet almost unvisited by the scientific traveller.  The  young Creole was known as Jules Besancon.    He was not the only naturalist of the party.  Another was with us; one  who had already acquired a world-wide fame; whose name was as familiar  to the _savans_ of Europe as to his own countrymen.  He was already an  old man, almost venerable in his aspect, but his tread was firm, and his  arm still strong enough to steady his long, heavy, double-barrelled  rifle.  An ample coat of dark blue covered his body; his limbs were  enveloped in long buttoned leggings of drab cloth, and a cap of sable  surmounted his high, broad forehead.  Under this his blueish grey eye  glanced with a calm but clear intelligence, and a single look from it  satisfied you that you were in the presence of a superior mind.  Were I  to give the name of this person, this would readily be acknowledged.  For certain reasons I cannot do this.  Suffice it to say, he was one of  the most distinguished of modern zoologists, and to his love for the  study we were indebted for his companionship upon our hunting  expedition.  He was known to us as Mr A-- the \"hunter-naturalist.\"  There was no jealousy between him and the young Besancon.  On the  contrary, a similarity of tastes soon brought about a mutual friendship,  and the Creole was observed to treat the other with marked deference and  regard.    I may set myself down as Number 6 of the party.  Let a short description  of me suffice.  I was then but a young fellow, educated somewhat better  than common; fond of wild sports; not indifferent to a knowledge of  nature; fond almost to folly of a good horse, and possessing one of the  very best; not ill-looking in the face, and of middle stature; costumed  in a light hunting-shirt of embroidered buckskin, with fringed cape and  skirt; leggings of scarlet cloth, and cloth forage-cap, covering a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23519"],[0,"The Mormon Menace: The Confessions of John Doyle Lee, Danite (#2)"],[1,"of Gentile sympathy  against the Mormon. The Mormon women are beings disgraced among  the Gentiles; they must defend their good repute. The children of  polygamous marriages must defend polygamy to defend their own  legitimacy. The practice, which doubtless had its beginning  solely to produce as rapidly as might be a Church strength, now  acts as a bar to the member's escape; wherefore the President,  his two counselors, the twelve apostles and others at the head of  Mormon affairs, insist upon it as a best, if not an only, Church  protection. Without polygamy the Mormon membership would dwindle  until Mormonism had utterly died out. The Mormon heads think so,  and preserve polygamy as a means of preserving the Church.    What the Mormon leaders think and feel and say on this keynote  question of polygamy, however much they may seek to hide their  sentiments behind a mask of lies, may be found in former  utterances from the Church pulpit, made before the shadow of the  law had fallen across it.    President Heber C. Kimball, in a discourse delivered in the  Tabernacle, November 9, 1856 (Deseret News, volume 6, page 291),  said: \"I have no wife or child that has any right to rebel  against me. If they violate my laws and rebel against me, they  will get into trouble just as quickly as though they transgressed  the counsels and teachings of Brother Brigham. Does it give a  woman a right to sin against me because she is my wife? No; but  it is her duty to do my will as I do the will of my Father and my  God. It is the duty of a woman to be obedient to her husband, and  unless she is I would not give a damn for all her queenly right  and authority, nor for her either, if she will quarrel and lie  about the work of God and the principles of plurality. A  disregard of plain and correct teachings is the reason why so  many are dead and damned, and twice plucked up by the roots, and  I would as soon baptize the devil as some of you.\"    October 6, 1855 (volume 5, page 274), Kimball said: \"If you  oppose any of the works of God you will cultivate a spirit of  apostasy. If you oppose what is called the spiritual wife  doctrine, the patriarchal order, which is of God, that course  will corrode you with apostasy, and you will go overboard. The  principle of plurality of wives never will be done away, although  some sisters have had revelations that when this time passes  away, and they go through the vale, every woman will have a  husband to herself. I wish more of our young men would take to  themselves wives of the daughters of Zion, and not wait for us  old men to take them all. Go ahead upon the right principle,  young gentlemen, and God bless you for ever and ever, and make  you fruitful, that we may fill the mountains and then the earth  with righteous inhabitants.\"    President Heber C. Kimball, in a lengthy discourse delivered in  the Tabernacle on the 4th day of April, 1857, took occasion to  say: \"I would not be afraid to promise a man who is sixty years  of age, if he will take the counsel of Brother Brigham and his  brethren, that he will renew his youth. I have noticed that a man  who has but one wife, and is inclined to that doctrine, soon  begins to wither and dry up, while a man who goes into plurality  looks fresh, young, and sprightly. Why is this? Because God loves  that man, and because he honors his work and word. Some of you  may not believe this - I not only believe it, but I also know it.  For a man of God to be confined to one woman is a small business;  it is as much as we can do to keep up under the burdens we have  to carry, and I do not know what we should do if we only had one  woman apiece.\"    President Heber C. Kimball used the following language in a  discourse, instructing a band of missionaries about to start on  their mission: \"I say to those who are elected to go on missions,  Go, if you never return, and commit what you have into the hands  of God - your wives, your children, your brethren, and your  property. Let truth and righteousness be your motto, and don't go  into the world for anything else but to preach the gospel, build  up the Kingdom of God, and gather the sheep into the fold. You  are sent out as shepherds to gather the sheep together; and  remember that they are not your sheep; they belong to Him that  sends you. Then don't make a choice of any of those sheep; don't  make selections before they are brought home and put into the  fold. You understand that! Amen.\"    When the Edmunds law was passed, and punishment and confiscation  and exile became the order, even dullwits among Mormons knew that  the day of terror and bloodshed as a system of Church defense was  over with and done. Then the Mormons made mendacity take the  place of murder, and went about to do by indirection what before  they had approached direct. Prophet Woodruff was conveniently  given a \"revelation\" to the effect that polygamy might be  abandoned. They none the less kept the Mormon mind in leash for  its revival. The men were still taught subjection; the women were  still told that wifehood and motherhood were their two great  stepping-stones in crossing to the heavenly shore, missing which  they would be swept away. Meanwhile, and in secret, those same  heads of the Church - Smith, the President, Cluff, the head of  the Mormon College, Tanner, chief of the Young Men's Mutual  Improvement Association - took unto themselves plural wives by  way of setting an example and to keep the practical fires of  polygamy alive.    True, these criminals ran risks, and took what President Smith in  his recent testimony, when telling of his own quintette of  helpmeets, called \"the chances of the law.\" To lower these risks,  and diminish them to a point where in truth they would be no  risks, the Mormon Church, under the lead of its bigamous  President several years rearward, became a political machine. It  looked over the future, considered its own black needs as an  outlaw, and saw that its first step towards security should be  the making of Utah into a State. As a territory the hand of the  Federal power rested heavily upon it; the Edmunds law could be  enforced whenever there dwelt a will in Washington so to do. Once  a State, Utah would slip from beneath the pressure of that iron  statute. The Mormons would at the worst face nothing more  rigorous than the State's own laws against bigamy, enforced by  judges and juries and sheriffs of their own selection, and jails  whereof they themselves would weld the bars and hew the stones  and forge the keys.    With that, every Mormon effort of lying promise and pretense of  purity were put forward to bring statehood about. What Gentiles  were then in Utah exerted themselves to a similar end, and made  compacts, and went, as it were, bail for Mormon good behavior. In  the end Utah was made a State; the Mormons breathed the freer as  ones who had escaped that Edmunds statute which was like a sword  of Damocles above their polygamous heads. To be sure, as a State  Utah had her laws against plural marriages, and provided a  punishment for the bigamist; the general government would consent  to nothing less as the price of that statehood prayed for. But  the Mormon criminals, the Smiths, the Lymans, the Tanners, and  the Cluffs, were not afraid. They had gotten the reins of power  into their own fingers, and made sure of their careful ability to  drive ahead without an upset.    The Mormon Church, now when Utah was a State, went into politics  more openly and deeply than before. Practically there are three  parties in Utah - Republicans and Democrats and Mormons. The  Gentiles are Democrats or Republicans; the Mormons are never  anything but Mormons, voting on this side or on that, for one man  or another, as the Mormon interest dictates and the Mormon  President and the apostles direct. Every Mormon who has a vote  occupies a double position; he is a Mormon in religion and a  Mormon in political faith. In that way every office is filled  with a Mormon, or with a Gentile who can be blind to Mormon  iniquities. To-day a bigamist in Utah has no more to fear from  the law than has a gambling-house keeper in the city of New York.    That Mormon conspiracy, whereof Smoot in the Senate is one  expression, was not made yesterday. It had its birth in the year  of the Edmunds law and its drastic enforcement. In that day,  black for Mormons, it was resolved to secure such foothold, such  representation in the Congress at Washington, that, holding a  balance of power in the Senate or House, or both, the Congressional  Democrats or Republicans would grant the Mormons safety for their  pet tenet of polygamy as the price of Mormon support. The Mormons  in carrying out these plans decided upon an invasion and,  wherever possible, the political conquest of other States. They  already owned Utah; they would bring - politically - beneath  their thumb as many more as they might. With this thought they  planted colonies in Nevada, in Colorado, in Idaho, in Wyoming, in  Montana, in Oregon, in Arizona. As a refuge for polygamists,  should the unexpected happen and a storm of law befall, they also  planted colonies over the Mexico line in Chihuahua and Sonora.    Before going to the latter move they talked with Diaz; and that  astute dictator said \"Yes,\" with emphasis. Diaz welcomed the  Mormons; they might be as polygamous as they pleased. He wanted  citizens; and he was not blind to those beauties of enterprise  and courage and hardihood that are the heritage of the Anglo-  Dane. He bade the Mormons come to Mexico and make a bulwark of  themselves between him and his American neighbors north of the  Rio Grande. The Mormons hated the Americans; Diaz could trust  them. The Mormons went to Mexico; there they are to-day in many a  rich community, as freely polygamous as in the most wide-flung  hour of Brigham Young. Diaz smiles as he reviews those prodigal  crops of corn and cattle and children "]]]
