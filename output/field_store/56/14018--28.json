The title had then an element of novelty, Dante Gabriel  Rossetti's _Dante and his Circle_, at the time the only book of this  particular character, having quite another aim. There are now some  twenty or more biographies based upon a similar plan.[1] The method has  its convenience where there are earlier lives of a given writer, as one  can in this way differentiate the book from previous efforts by making  one's hero stand out among his friends. Some such apology, I feel, is  necessary, because, in these days of the multiplication of books, every  book, at least other than a work of imagination, requires ample apology.  In _Charlotte Bronte and her Circle_ I was able to claim that, even  though following in the footsteps of Mrs. Gaskell, I had added some four  hundred new letters by Charlotte Bronte to the world's knowledge of that  interesting woman, and still more considerably enlarged our knowledge of  her sister Emily. This achievement has been generously acknowledged, and  I am most proud of the testimony of the most accomplished of living  biographers, Sir George Otto Trevelyan, who once rendered me the  following quite spontaneous tribute:         We have lately read _aloud_ for the second time your Bronte       book; let alone private readings. It is unique in plan and       excellence, and I am greatly obliged to you for it. Apart from       the pleasure of the book, the form of it has always interested       me as a professional biographer. It certainly is novel; and in       this case I am pretty sure that it is right.    With such a testimony before me I cannot hesitate to present my second  biography in similar form. In the case of George Borrow, however, I am  not in a position to supplement one transcendent biography, as in the  case of Charlotte Bronte and Mrs. Gaskell. I have before me no less than  four biographies of Borrow, every one of them of distinctive merit.  These are:         _Life, Writings, and Correspondence of George Borrow._ Derived       from Official and other Authentic Sources. By William I. Knapp,       Ph.D., LL.D. 2 vols. John Murray, 1899.         _George Borrow: The Man and his Work._ By R. A. J. Walling.       Cassell, 1908.         _The Life of George Borrow._ Compiled from Unpublished Official       Documents. His Works, Correspondence, etc. By Herbert Jenkins.       John Murray, 1912.         _George Borrow: The Man and his Books._ By Edward Thomas.       Chapman and Hall, 1912.    All of these books have contributed something of value and importance to  the subject. Dr. Knapp's work it is easiest to praise because he is  dead.[2] His biography of Borrow was the effort of a lifetime. A scholar  with great linguistic qualifications for writing the biography of an  author whose knowledge of languages was one of his titles to fame, Dr.  Knapp spared neither time nor money to achieve his purpose. Starting  with an article in _The Chautauquan Magazine_ in 1887, which was  reprinted in pamphlet form, Dr. Knapp came to England--to Norwich--and  there settled down to write a _Life_ of Borrow, which promised at one  time to develop into several volumes. As well it might, for Dr. Knapp  reached Norfolk at a happy moment for his purpose. Mrs. MacOubrey,  Borrow's stepdaughter, was in the humour to sell her father's  manuscripts and books. They were offered to the city of Norwich; there  was some talk of Mr. Jeremiah Coleman, M.P., whose influence and wealth  were overpowering in Norwich at the time, buying them. Finally, a very  considerable portion of the collection came into the hands of Mr.  Webber, a bookseller of Ipswich, who later became associated with the  firm of Jarrold of Norwich. From Webber Dr. Knapp purchased the larger  portion, and, as his bibliography indicates (_Life_, vol. ii. pp.  355-88), he became possessed of sundry notebooks which furnish a record  of certain of Borrow's holiday tours, about a hundred letters from and  to Borrow, and a considerable number of other documents. The result, as  I have indicated, was a book that abounded in new facts and is rich in  new material. It was not, however, a book for popular reading. You must  love the subject before you turn to this book with any zest. It is a  book for your true Borrovian, who is thankful for any information about  the word-master, not for the casual reader, who might indeed be  alienated from the subject by this copious memoir. The result was  somewhat discouraging. There were not enough of true Borrovians in those  years, and the book was not received too generously. The two volumes  have gone out of print and have not reached a second edition. Time  however, will do them justice. As it is, your good Borrow lover has  always appreciated their merits. Take Lionel Johnson for example, a good  critic and a master of style. After saying that these 'lengthy and rich  volumes are a monument of love's labour, but not of literary art or  biographical skill,' he adds: 'Of his over eight hundred pages there is  not one for which I am not grateful' and every new biographer of Borrow  is bound to re-echo that sentiment. Dr. Knapp did the spade work and  other biographers have but entered into his inheritance. Dr. Knapp's  fine collection of Borrow books and manuscripts was handed over by his  widow to the American nation--to the Hispanic Society of New York. Dr.  Knapp's biography was followed nine years later by a small volume by Mr.  R. A. J. Walling, whose little book adds considerably to our knowledge  of Borrow's Cornish relatives, and is in every way a valuable monograph  on the author of _Lavengro_. Mr. Herbert Jenkins's book is more  ambitious. Within four hundred closely printed pages he has compressed  every incident in Borrow's career, and we would not quarrel with him nor  his publisher for calling his life a 'definitive biography' if one did  not know that there is not and cannot be anything 'definitive' about a  biography except in the case of a Master. Boswell, Lockhart, Mrs.  Gaskell are authors who had the advantage of knowing personally the  subjects of their biographies. Any biographer who has not met his hero  face to face and is dependent solely on documents is crippled in his  undertaking. Moreover, such a biographer is always liable to be in a  manner superseded or at least supplemented by the appearance of still  more documents. However, Mr. Jenkins's excellent biography has the  advantage of many new documents from Mr. John Murray's archives and from  the Record Office Manuscripts. His work was the first to make use of the  letters of George Borrow to the Bible Society, which the Rev. T. H.  Darlow has published as a book under that title, a book to which I owe  him an acknowledgment for such use of it as I have made, as also for  permission to reproduce the title-page of Borrow's Basque version of St.  Luke's gospel. There only remains for me to say a word in praise of Mr.  Edward Thomas's fine critical study of Borrow which was published under  the title of _George Borrow: The Man and his Books_. Mr. Thomas makes no  claim to the possession of new documents. This brings me to such excuse  as I can make for perpetrating a fifth biography. When Mrs. MacOubrey,  Borrow's stepdaughter, the 'Hen.' of _Wild Wales_ and the affectionate  companion of his later years, sold her father's books and  manuscripts--and she always to her dying day declared that she had no  intention of parting with the manuscripts, which were, she said, taken  away under a misapprehension--she did not, of course, part with any of  his more private documents. All the more intimate letters of Borrow were  retained. At her death these passed to her executors, from whom I have  purchased all legal rights in the publication of Borrow's hitherto  unpublished manuscripts and letters. I trust that even to those who may  disapprove of the discursive method with which--solely for my own  pleasure--I have written this book, will at least find a certain  biographical value in the many new letters by and to George Borrow that  are to be found in its pages. The book has taken me ten years to write,  and has been a labour of love.

[2] William Ireland Knapp died in Paris in June 1908, aged seventy-four.  He was an American, and had held for many years the Chair of Modern  Languages at Vassar College. After eleven years in Spain he returned to  occupy the Chair of Modern Languages at Yale, and later held a  Professorship at Chicago. After his _Life of Borrow_ was published he  resided in Paris until his death.          CHAPTER I    CAPTAIN BORROW OF THE WEST NORFOLK MILITIA      George Henry Borrow was born at Dumpling Green near East Dereham,  Norfolk, on the 5th of July 1803. It pleased him to state on many an  occasion that he was born at East Dereham.         On an evening of July, in the year 18--, at East D----, a       beautiful little town in a certain district of East Anglia, I       first saw the light,    he writes in the opening lines of _Lavengro_, using almost the identical  phraseology that we find in the opening lines of Goethe's _Wahrheit und  Dichtung_. Here is a later memory of Dereham from _Lavengro_:         What it is at present I know not, for thirty years and more       have"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19769"],[0,"The Brochure Series of Architectural Illustration, Vol. 01, No. 08, August 1895 (#2)"],[1," to take the professional studies after completing the  usual course in the college proper. Especial stress is laid upon  educating the taste and discrimination of the student, and association  with cultivated men and familiarity with the best efforts of the past,  are the two most important influences to this end.          Personal.      Mr. C. D. Maginnis, recently returned from abroad, and who has for  several years been in the office of Mr. E. M. Wheelwright, city  architect, has opened an office at 27 School Street, Boston. He is  prepared to do all kinds of architectural drawing, in pen, pencil, or  water color, and will work up competition drawings and sketches.    Mr. W. H. Kilham, Mr. E. P. Dana, and several others have recently been  added to the working force of Messrs. Winslow & Wetherell, whose office  is now the largest in Boston.    Mr. W. T. Partridge, who has for several years been with Messrs. Eames &  Young, in St. Louis, has severed his connection with them and will  probably return to the East.          Club Notes.      The summer work of the Sketch Club of New York has been laid out to  include sketching trips in the outlying neighborhood of New York City.  On alternate Saturdays members of the Club meet at one of the piers and  take a small steam yacht to points along the East River and Long Island  Sound, spending the Sunday in sketching. On the intermediate Sundays,  rambles through West Chester occupy those who are disposed to join in  the excursions. These trips are laid out to include the time from July  13 to September 28.    The competition of the Chicago Architectural Club upon the subject  \"Picturesque Chicago,\" closes September 2, and the club begins its  regular year's work on that date with an exhibition of the sketches  submitted in this competition together with other work of the summer.

The descriptive article by  one of the members which is begun in this number will also give an  indication to those who are not already familiar with this organization,  of its character and purpose. That a combination of serious work and  relaxation can be reconciled without sacrificing the former, has been  demonstrated in this case, for the P. D.'s are the mainstay of the  Boston Architectural Club and have accomplished considerable in other  directions, having done very notable work in several of the Beaux-Arts  Society's competitions. Their motto and seal shown in the other  illustration is a remarkable example of impromptu decoration.           *       *       *       *       *    The August 22 issue of the _Journal of the Royal Institute of British  Architects_ contains a description of the School of Architecture and  Applied Arts of University College, Liverpool, and an address by Mr.  T. G. Jackson, the well-known English architect and author, delivered at  the inauguration of the school on May 10 last. Special provisions are  made for courses in Architecture, Sculpture and Modelling, Decorative  Painting, Wrought Iron Work, and Wood Carving, accompanying theoretical  instruction with actual work in the studios and shops.    Mr. Jackson's remarks are worthy careful attention and will be found as  valuable to American students as to those to whom they were addressed.  His opinions upon the study of architectural history are interesting in  connection with the views of the American writers to which we referred  last month. He says: \"The reverence with which we have been taught to  regard old work has misled us into a slavish worship of precedent, and  an abject craving for authority by which to shape our own work. Close  imitation of old work has been regarded as the only safe course,  deceptive imitation of it the highest measure of success.\"...    \"Above all it should be the student's object to discover the principles  of design by which the successive styles were governed, and in tracing  their history he should trace the influence of circumstance and  accident, which modify the current art of the day.... The history of  architecture, and the development of style out of style, should never be  taught without incessant reference to the constructional methods which  were employed, and which played the principal part in the changes  resulting from their employment.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Apropos of the perennial discussion of the question of professional  ethics which from time to time comes into prominence in the meetings of  the American Institute of Architects the following may be of interest.  It is appended to the card of a certain architect which is published as  an advertisement in a local paper and reads: \"Any kind of architectural  work promptly attended to and satisfaction guaranteed.\"    In the resolutions recently adopted by the Boston Society of Architects  concerning professional ethics it was maintained that architects should  not advertise. The advertisement above may savor somewhat of its  surroundings (above it a hair renewer is advertised and below it  penny-royal pills) and suggest too much the \"shoes tapped while you  wait\" order of advertising, but we fail to see why architects should be  restrained from advertising if there are any benefits to be derived  from it. And for our part we think that there are few architects whose  business or practice might not be improved by judicious advertising. It  is easy to lay down an arbitrary dictum and say that no professional man  shall advertise, but what argument can apply to architects in this  respect that does not equally apply to civil engineers and to landscape  architects? And no one objects to the advertisements of the latter. The  publication of architects' designs in the professional journals is in  many cases advertising, pure and simple, but is not on this account to  be condemned. The truth of the matter is that the exact point where  advertising begins and ends is impossible to determine. One kind of  advertising is considered allowable and dignified, another is not. In  consequence there is opportunity for many differences of opinion.          The \"P. D.'s.\"      If Chimmie Fadden were asked to translate the letters P. D., he would  undoubtedly answer, \"What 'ell?\" and it must be acknowledged that this  answer does credit to Chames's insight; but at the same time we feel  sure that Chames would not be offended if he were informed that his  favorite expression is not nearly such an appropriate definition of  P. D. as it is of the play of Madame Sans Gene, all rumors to the  contrary notwithstanding And if Chames could be induced to give up for  the while his everlasting search for a bull pup, we might proceed to  inform him to the best of our ability what it really does mean.    \"The Lord gives good meat but the devil sends cooks,\" but Chames  apparently lending a willing ear, we take his life in our hands, and  firstly:--    And that is, that P. D. is not an abbreviation for Poor Debtors, as some  would have it, but for Poor Draughtsmen; which is after all, perhaps, a  distinction without a difference.    Poor in this case has no reference to the quality of the draughtsmen's  work, for, as our song truly says,--        \"The P. D. is a man      Who does the best he can,      No matter what the problem it may be.      He can draw a quarter scale,      He can draw a full detail,      And draw his pay upon a Saturdee.\"    The club, for such it is, was at first overburdened with the name of The  Poor Draughtsmen's Saturday Night Club, but the member who wrote the  specification of the club, started in by writing the name and then  proceeded as follows: \"The name of the club shall be the above (it is  too long to write again).\" The hint was taken and it has since been  known as the P. D.'s.    The club resulted from the more or less accidental coming together of  men of congenial spirit, and the desire to cultivate each other's  acquaintance more intimately than was possible in the larger  Architectural Club of which they are all members, and over which are  their club rooms.    [Illustration: SEAL OF THE P. D.'S.]    The work of fitting up these rooms was done by the members themselves,  and an added interest is given them by the constantly changing  exhibitions on their walls. The bulletin board is also a never-ending  source of delight.    The club at present consists of thirteen members, all of whom on  entering it, as a sort of architectural baptism, receive new names, and,  ye gods, what names!    What more is to be desired when one may, when he dines or designs, touch  elbows with such choice spirits as Ictinus, Michael Angelo, Vitruvius,  Vignola, Piranesi, San Gallo, Bramante, Christopher Wren, Inigo Jones,  Charles Bulfinch, Viollet le Duc, Gamier Freres (N.B.--There is only  one of him), and Brian Boru.    [Illustration: A GALA NIGHT IN THE ROOMS OF THE \"P. D.'S.\"]    The one requirement for admission is good fellowship with the saving  clause, that this good fellowship, like Faith, must be accompanied by  good works.    Its organization is of the simplest character, there being no  constitution or rules of any kind, except the joke known as the  specification be regarded as such."]]]
