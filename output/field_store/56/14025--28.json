The desire for decoration is probably as old as the human race. Nature,  of course, is the source of beauty, and this natural beauty affects  something within us which has or is the faculty of reproducing the cause  of its emotion in a material form. Whether the reproduction be such as  to appeal to the eye or the ear depends on the cast of the faculty. In a  mild or elementary form, probably both casts of faculty exist in every  animated creature, and especially in the human being.    Art being the intelligent representation of that quality of beauty which  appeals to any particular observer, whoever exercises the faculty of  such representation is an artist.    Greatness or otherwise is simply the measure of the faculty, for in  Nature herself there is no restriction. There is always enough of beauty  in Nature to fill the mightiest capacity of human genius. Artists,  therefore, are measured by comparison with each other in reference to  the fraction of art which they attempt to reproduce.    The art of illumination does not aim at more than the gratification of  those who take pleasure in books. Its highest ambition is to make books  beautiful.    To some persons, perhaps, all ordinary books are ugly and distasteful.  Probably they are so to the average schoolboy. Hence the laudable  endeavour among publishers of school-books to make them attractive. The  desire that books should be made attractive is of great antiquity. How  far back in the world's history we should have to go to get in front of  it we cannot venture to reckon. The methods of making books attractive  are numerous and varied. That to which we shall confine our attention is  a rather special one. Both its processes and its results are peculiar.  Mere pictures or pretty ornamental letters in sweet colours and elegant  drawing do not constitute illumination, though they do form essential  contributions towards it; and, indeed, in the sixteenth century the  clever practitioners who wished, in bright colours, to awaken up the old  woodcuts used to call themselves illuminists, and the old German books  which taught how the work should be done were called _Illuminir bücher_.  Illuminists were not illuminators.    In the twelfth century when, as far as we know, the word illuminator was  first applied to one who practised the art of book decoration, it meant  one who \"lighted up\" the page of the book with bright colours and  burnished gold.    These processes suggest the definition of the art. _Perfect illumination  must contain both colours and metals_. To this extent it is in perfect  unison with the other mediæval art of heraldry; it might almost be  called a twin-sister.    As an art it is much older than its name. We find something very like it  even among the ancient Egyptians, for in the Louvre at Paris is a  papyrus containing paintings of funeral ceremonies, executed in bright  colours and touched in its high lights with pencilled gold. But after  this for many centuries there remains no record of the existence of any  such art until just before the Christian era. Then, indeed, we have  mention of a lady artist who painted a number of miniature portraits for  the great biographical work of the learned Varro. We must carefully  observe, however, that there is a distinction between illumination and  mere miniature painting. Sometimes it is true that miniatures--as _e.g._  those of the early Byzantine artists, and afterwards those of Western  Europe--were finished with touches of gold to represent the lights. This  brought them into the category of illuminations, for while miniatures  may be executed without the use of gold or silver, illuminations may  not. There are thousands of miniatures that are not illuminations.    At the period when illuminating was at its best the miniature, in its  modern sense of a little picture, was only just beginning to appear as a  noticeable feature, and the gold was as freely applied to it as to the  penmanship or the ornament. But such is not the case with miniature  painting generally.    Lala of Cyzicus, the lady artist just referred to, lived in the time of  Augustus Cæsar. She has the honour of being the first miniaturist on  record, and is said to have produced excellent portraits \"in little,\"  especially those of ladies, on both vellum and ivory. Her own portrait,  representing her engaged in painting a statuette, is still to be seen  among the precious frescoes preserved in the museum at Naples.    The term \"miniature,\" now applied to this class of work, has been  frequently explained. It is derived from the Latin word _minium_, or red  paint, two pigments being anciently known by this name--one the sulphide  of mercury, now known also as \"vermilion,\" the other a lead oxide, now  called \"red lead.\" It is the latter which is generally understood as the  _minium_ of the illuminators, though both were used in manuscript work.  The red paint was employed to mark the initial letters or sections of  the MS. Its connection with portraiture and other pictorial subjects on  a small scale is entirely owing to its accidental confusion by French  writers with their own word _mignon_, and so with the Latin _minus_. In  classical times, among the Romans, the \"miniator\" was simply a person  who applied the _minium_, and had nothing to do with pictures or  portraits at all, but with the writing. That the rubrication of titles,  however, was somewhat of a luxury may be gathered from the complaint of  Ovid when issuing the humble edition of his verses from his lonely exile  of Tomi:--             \"Parve (nec invideo) sine me liber ibis in urbem:            Hei mihi quo domino non licet ire tuo.            ...........................            Nec te purpureo velent vaccinia succo            Non est conveniens luctibus ille color.            _Nec titulus minio_, nec cedro carta notetur            Candida nec nigra cornua fronte geras.\"[1]                                       _Tristia_, Cl. 1, Eleg. 1.    [1] \"Go, little book, nor do I forbid,--go without me into that city  where, alas! I may enter never more.... Nor shall whortleberries adorn  thee with their crimson juice; that colour is not suitable for  lamentations. Nor shall thy title be marked with minium, nor thy leaf  scented with cedar-oil. Nor shalt thou bear horns of ivory or ebony upon  thy front.\"    There are many allusions in these pathetic lines which would bear  annotation, but space forbids. The one point is the use of minium.
