The American doughboys  grimly marched down the gangplanks and set their feet on the soil of  Russia, September 5th, 1918. The dark waters of the Dvina River were  beaten into fury by the opposing north wind and ocean tide. And the  lowering clouds of the Arctic sky added their dismal bit to this  introduction to the dreadful conflict which these American sons of  liberty were to wage with the Bolsheviki during the year's campaign.    In the rainy fall season by their dash and valor they were to expel the  Red Guards from the cities and villages of the state of Archangel,  pursuing the enemy vigorously up the Dvina, the Vaga, the Onega and the  Pinega Rivers, and up the Archangel-Vologda Railway and the  Kodish-Plesetskaya-Petrograd state highway. They were to plant their  entrenched outposts in a great irregular horseshoe line, one cork at  Chekuevo, the toe at Ust-Padenga, the other cork of the shoe at  Karpagorskaya. They were to run out from the city of Archangel long,  long lines of communication, spread wide like the fingers of a great  hand that sought seemingly to cover as much of North Russia as possible  with Allied military protection.    In the winter, in the long, long nights and black, howling forests and  frozen trenches, with ever-deepening snows and sinking thermometer, with  the rivers and the White Sea and the Arctic Ocean solid ice fifteen feet  thick, these same soldiers now seen disembarking from the troopships,  were to find their enemy greatly increasing his forces every month at  all points on the Allied line. Stern defense everywhere on that  far-flung trench and blockhouse and fortified-village battle line. They  were to feel the overwhelming pressure of superior artillery and  superior equipment and transportation controlled by the enemy and  especially the crushing odds of four to ten times the number of men on  the battle lines. And with it they were to feel the dogged sense of the  grim necessity of fighting for every verst of frozen ground. Their very  lives were to depend upon the stubbornness of their holding retreat.  There could be no retreating beyond Archangel, for the ships were frozen  in the harbor. Indeed a retreat to the city of Archangel itself was  dangerous. It might lead to revulsion of temper among the populace and  enable the Red Guards to secure aid from within the lines so as to carry  out Trotsky's threat of pushing the foreign bayonets all under the ice  of the White Sea. And in that remarkable winter defense these American  soldiers were to make history for American arms, exhibiting courage and  fortitude and heroism, the stories of which are to embellish the annals  of American martial exploits. They were destined, a handful of them  here, a handful there, to successfully baffle the Bolshevik hordes in  their savage drives.    In the spring the great ice crunching up in the rivers and the sea was  to behold those same veteran Yanks still fighting the Red Guard armies  and doing their bit to keep the state of Archangel, the North Russian  Republic, safe, and their own skins whole. The warming sun and bursting  green were to see the olive-drab uniform, tattered and torn as it was,  covering a wearied and hungry and homesick but nevertheless fearless and  valiant American soldier. With deadly effect they were to meet the  onrushing swarms of Bolos on all fronts and slaughter them on their wire  with rifle and machine gun fire and smash up their reserves with  artillery fire. With desperation they were to dispute the overwhelming  columns of infantry who were hurled by no less a renowned old Russian  General than Kuropatkin, and at Malo Bereznik and Bolsheozerki, in  particular, to send them reeling back in bloody disaster. They were to  fight the Bolshevik to a standstill so that they could make their  guarded getaway.    Summer was to see these Americans at last handing over the defenses to  Russian Northern Republic soldiers who had been trained during the  winter at Archangel and gradually during the spring broken in for duty  alongside the American and British troops and later were to hold the  lines in some places by themselves and in others to share the lines with  the new British troops coming in twenty thousand strong \"to finish the  bloody show.\" Gaily"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22542"],[0,"Jesus the Christ (#2)"],[1,"ia.--James and John reproved for revengeful  desire.--The Seventy charged and sent.--Their return.--A lawyer's  question.--Parable of Good Samaritan.--Martha and Mary.--Ask and  receive.--Parable of Friend at Midnight.--Criticism on Pharisees and  lawyers.--Parable of Foolish Rich Man.--The unrepentant to  perish.--Parable of Barren Fig Tree.--A woman healed on the  Sabbath.--Many or few to be saved?--Jesus warned of Herod's design    Chapter 27.

INTRODUCTION.      It is a matter of history that, at or near the beginning of what has  since come to be known as the Christian era, the Man Jesus, surnamed the  Christ, was born in Bethlehem of Judea.[1] The principal data as to His  birth, life, and death are so well attested as to be reasonably  indisputable; they are facts of record, and are accepted as essentially  authentic by the civilized world at large. True, there are diversities  of deduction based on alleged discrepancies in the records of the past  as to circumstantial details; but such differences are of strictly minor  importance, for none of them nor all taken together cast a shadow of  rational doubt upon the historicity of the earthly existence of the Man  known in literature as Jesus of Nazareth.    As to who and what He was there are dissensions of grave moment dividing  the opinions of men; and this divergence of conception and belief is  most pronounced upon those matters to which the greatest importance  attaches. The solemn testimonies of millions dead and of millions living  unite in proclaiming Him as divine, the Son of the Living God, the  Redeemer and Savior of the human race, the Eternal Judge of the souls of  men, the Chosen and Anointed of the Father--in short, the Christ. Others  there are who deny His Godhood while extolling the transcendent  qualities of His unparalleled and unapproachable Manhood.    To the student of history this Man among men stands first, foremost, and  alone, as a directing personality in the world's progression. Mankind  has never produced a leader to rank with Him. Regarded solely as a  historic personage He is unique. Judged by the standard of human  estimation, Jesus of Nazareth is supreme among men by reason of the  excellence of His personal character, the simplicity, beauty, and  genuine worth of His precepts, and the influence of His example and  doctrines in the advancement of the race. To these distinguishing  characteristics of surpassing greatness the devout Christian soul adds  an attribute that far exceeds the sum of all the others--the divinity of  Christ's origin and the eternal reality of His status as Lord and God.    Christian and unbeliever alike acknowledge His supremacy as a Man, and  respect the epoch-making significance of His birth. Christ was born in  the meridian of time;[2] and His life on earth marked at once the  culmination of the past and the inauguration of an era distinctive in  human hope, endeavor, and achievement. His advent determined a new order  in the reckoning of the years; and by common consent the centuries  antedating His birth have been counted backward from the pivotal event  and are designated accordingly. The rise and fall of dynasties, the  birth and dissolution of nations, all the cycles of history as to war  and peace, as to prosperity and adversity, as to health and pestilence,  seasons of plenty and of"]]]
