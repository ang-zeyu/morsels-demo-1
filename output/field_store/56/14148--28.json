I wish I was that little cloud,    By the gentle south wind driven;  Floating along, so free and bright,    Far, far up into heaven.    I'd rather be a cunning fox,    And hide me in a cave;  I'd rather be a savage wolf,    Than what I am--a slave.    My mother calls me her good boy,    My father calls me brave;  What wicked action have I done,    That I should be a slave.    I saw my little sister sold,    So will they do to me;  My Heavenly Father, let me die,    For then I shall be free.          THE BEREAVED FATHER.    Words by Miss Chandler. Music by G.W.C.      [Music]    Ye've gone from me, my gentle ones!    With all your shouts of mirth;  A silence is within my walls,    A darkness round my hearth,    A darkness round my hearth.    Woe to the hearts that heard, unmoved,    The mother's anguish'd shriek!  And mock'd, with taunting scorn, the tears    That bathed a father's cheek.    Woe to the hands that tore you hence,    My innocent and good!  Not e'en the tigress of the wild,    Thus tears her fellow's brood.    I list to hear your soft sweet tones,    Upon the morning air;  I gaze amidst the twilight's gloom,    As if to find you there.    But you no more come bounding forth    To meet me in your glee;  And when the evening shadows fall,    Ye are not at my knee.    Your forms are aye before my eyes,    Your voices on my ear,  And all things wear a thought of you,    But you no more are here.    You were the glory of my life,    My blessing and my pride!  I half forgot the name of slave,    When you were by my side!    Woe for your lot, ye doom'd ones! woe    A seal is on your fate!  And shame, and toil, and wretchedness,    On all your steps await!          SLAVE GIRL MOURNING HER FATHER.    Parodied from Mrs. Sigourney by G.W.C.      [Music]    They say I was but four years old    When father was sold away;  Yet I have never seen his face    Since that sad parting day.  He went where brighter flowrets grow    Beneath the Southern skies;  Oh who will show me on the map    Where that far country lies?    I begged him, \"father, do not go!    For, since my mother died,  I love no one so well as you;\"    And, clinging to his side,  The tears came gushing down my cheeks    Until my eyes were dim;  Some were in sorrow for the dead,    And _some_ in love for him.    He knelt and prayed of God above,    \"My little daughter spare,  And let us both here meet again,    O keep her in thy care.\"  He does not come!--I watch for him    At evening twilight grey,  Till every shadow wears his shape,    Along the grassy way.    I muse and listen all alone,    When stormy winds are high,  And think I hear his tender tone,    And call, but no reply;  And so I've done these four long years,    Without a friend or home,  Yet every dream of hope is vain,--    Why don't my father come?    Father--dear father, are you sick,    Upon a stranger shore?--  The people say it must be so--    O send to me once more,  And let your little daughter come,    To soothe your restless bed,  And hold the cordial to your lips,    And press your aching head.    Alas!--I fear me he is dead!--    Who will my trouble share?  Or tell me where his form is laid,    And let me travel there?  By mother's tomb I love to sit,    Where the green branches wave;  Good people! help a friendless child    To find her father's grave.          The Slave and her Babe.    WORDS BY CHARLOTTE ELIZABETH.    \"Can a woman forget her sucking child?\"    _Air--\"Slave Girl mourning her Father.\"_      O, massa, let me stay, to catch    My baby's sobbing breath;  His little glassy eye to watch,    And smooth his limbs in death,  And cover him with grass and leaf,    Beneath the plantain tree!  It is not sullenness, but grief--    O, massa, pity me!    God gave me babe--a precious boon,    To cheer my lonely heart,  But massa called to work too soon,    And I must needs depart.  The morn was chill--I spoke no word,    But feared my babe might die,  And heard all day, or thought I heard,    My little baby cry.    At noon--O, how I ran! and took    My baby to my breast!  I lingered--and the long lash broke    My sleeping infant's rest.  I worked till night--till darkest night,    In torture and disgrace;  Went home, and watched till morning light,    To see my baby's face.    The fulness from its cheek was gone,    The sparkle from its eye;  Now hot, like fire, now cold, like stone,    I _knew_ my babe must die.  I worked upon plantation ground,    Though faint with woe and dread,  Then ran, or flew, and here I found--    See massa, almost dead.    Then give me but one little hour--    O! do not lash me so!  One little hour--one little hour--    And gratefully I'll go.  Ah me! the whip has cut my boy,    I heard his feeble scream;  No more--farewell my only joy,    My life's first gladsome dream!    I lay thee on the lonely sod,    The heaven is bright above;  These Christians boast they have a God,    And say his name is Love:  O gentle, loving God, look down!    My dying baby see;  The mercy that from earth is flown,    Perhaps may dwell with THEE!          THE NEGRO'S APPEAL.    Words by Cowper. Tune--\"Isle of Beauty.\"      [Music]    Forced from home and all its pleasures,    Afric's coast I left forlorn;  To increase a stranger's treasures,    O'er the raging billows borne.  Christian people bought and sold me,    Paid my price in paltry gold:  But though slave they have enrolled me    _Minds_ are never to be sold.    Is there, as ye sometimes tell me,    Is there one who reigns on high?  Has he bid you buy and sell me,    Speaking from his throne--the sky?  Ask him, if your knotted scourges,    Matches, blood-extorting screws,  Are the means that duty urges    Agents of his will to use.    Hark! he answers--wild tornadoes,    Strewing yonder sea with wrecks,  Wasting towns, plantations, meadows,    Are the voice with which he speaks.  He, foreseeing what vexations    Afric's sons should undergo,  Fixed their tyrant's habitations,    Where his whirlwinds answer--No!    By our blood in Afric' wasted,    Ere our necks received the chain;  By the miseries that we tasted,    Crossing in your barks the main:  By our sufferings, since ye brought us    To the man-degrading mart,  All sustained by patience, taught us    Only by a broken heart--    Deem our nation brutes no longer,    Till some reason ye shall find,  Worthier of regard and stronger    Than the _color_ of our kind.  Slaves of gold! whose sordid dealings    Tarnish all your boasted powers;  Prove that you have human feelings,    Ere you proudly question ours.          NEGRO BOY SOLD FOR A WATCH.[1]    [Footnote 1: An African prince having arrived in England, and having  been asked what he had given for his watch, answered, \"What I will  never give again--I gave a fine boy for it.\"]    Words by Cowper. Arranged by G.W.C. from an old theme.      [Music]    When avarice enslaves the mind,    And selfish views alone bear sway  Man turns a savage to his kind,    And blood and rapine mark his way.  Alas! for this poor simple toy,    I sold the hapless Negro boy.    His father's hope, his mother's pride,    Though black, yet comely to the view  I tore him helpless from their side,    And gave him to a ruffian crew--  To fiends that Afric's coast annoy,    I sold the hapless Negro Boy.    From country, friends, and parents torn,    His tender limbs in chains confined,  I saw him o'er the billows borne,    And marked his agony of mind;  But still to gain this simple toy,    I gave the weeping Negro Boy.    In isles that deck the western wave    I doomed the hapless youth to dwell,  A poor, forlorn, insulted slave!    A BEAST THAT CHRISTIANS BUY AND SELL!  And in their cruel tasks employ    The much-enduring Negro Boy.    His wretched parents long shall mourn,    Shall long explore the distant main  In hope to see the youth return;    But all their hopes and sighs are vain:  They never shall the sight enjoy,    Of their lamented Negro Boy.    Beneath a tyrant's harsh command,    He wears away his youthful prime;  Far distant from his native land,    A stranger in a foreign clime.  No pleasing thoughts his mind employ,    A poor, dejected Negro Boy.    But He who walks upon the wind,    Whose voice in thunder's heard on high,  Who doth the raging tempest bind,    And hurl the lightning through the sky,  In his own time will sure destroy    The oppressor of the Negro Boy.          I AM MONARCH OF NOUGHT I SURVEY.    A Parody. Air \"Old Dr. Fleury.\"      I am monarch of nought I survey,    My wrongs there are none to dispute;  My master conveys me away,    His whims or caprices to suit.  O slavery, where are the charms    That \"patriarchs\" have seen in thy face;  I dwell in the midst of alarms,    And serve in a horrible place.    I am out of humanity's reach,    And must finish my life with a groan;  Never hear the sweet music of speech    That tells me my body's my own.  Society, friendship, and love,    Divinely bestowed upon some,  Are blessings I never can prove,    If slavery's my portion to come.    Religion! what treasures untold,    Reside in that heavenly word!  More precious than silver or gold,    Or all that this earth can afford.  But I am excluded the light    That leads to this heavenly grace;  The Bible is clos'd to my sight,    Its beauties I never can trace.    Ye winds, that have made me your sport,    Convey to this sorrowful land,  Some cordial endearing report,    Of freedom from tyranny's hand.  My friends, do they not often send,    A wish or a thought after me?  O, tell me I yet have a friend,    A friend I am anxious to see.    How fleet is a glance of the mind!    Compared with the speed of its flight;  The tempest itself lags behind,    And the swift-winged arrows of light.  When I think of Victoria's domain,    In a moment I seem to be there,  But the fear of being taken again,    Soon hurries me back to despair.    The wood-"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22096"],[0,"Stories the Iroquois Tell Their Children (#2)"],[1," adopted  her into the Snipe clan of their nation. She was called _Yeh sen noh  wehs_--\"One who carries and tells the stories.\"    Thus it was that the writer became one of the Red Children, _Yeh sen noh  wehs_--the Daughter of the Senecas.    The more _Yeh sen noh wehs_ learned of the Red Children, and their  simple stories, the more she loved them. One day, _Yeh sen noh wehs_  said she would be the story-teller not only of the Senecas, but of all  the tribes of the Iroquois. There are six great families of this people.  Each family is called a tribe or nation.    Once, the council fires of these six nations burned from the Hudson on  the east, to Lake Erie on the west, and they were a great and powerful  people.    It was at the time of the Berry Moon that _Yeh sen noh wehs_ hit the  story trail. Since then she has journeyed through all the lands of the  Senecas, the Onondagas, the Cayugas, the Oneidas, the Mohawks, and the  Tuscaroras.    Like the story-teller of old, _Yeh sen noh wehs_ wandered from lodge to  lodge of the Iroquois. \"_Hanio_,\" she would call, and as the Indians  gathered round, she would tell them one of the stories that other Indian  friends had told to her.    Sometimes this would remind the Red Children of another story, which  _Yeh sen noh wehs_ did not know, and they would tell it to her. It was  in this way that these stories have been gathered.    There were many days when _Yeh sen noh wehs_ told her stories, but none  were told in return. Few members of the tribes--these usually the  oldest--could remember the stories \"they used to tell.\"    Sometimes _Yeh sen noh wehs_ heard a story as she trudged along a  furrow, beside a ragged Indian who was plowing with a more  ragged-looking team. Or she would listen as she helped an Indian woman  prepare the evening meal, pick berries, or gather nuts.    [Illustration]    Sometimes, as _Yeh sen noh wehs_ sat by a fire down in the depths of a  beautiful wood, and watched the smoke of the sacred medicine rise, a  medicine man would tell her a story; or an Indian woman would drop a  word, as she sat at her door weaving baskets or making beadwork.    These stories _Yeh sen noh wehs_ has made into a story book, that they  might not be lost and forgotten; that all the Iroquois Red Children and  their children's children might know and tell them, and that Paleface  children might learn them as well.    The American children have no fairies of their own. They must borrow  their fairies from children of other nations. _Yeh sen noh wehs_ thought  it very sad, so she put a magic feather in her cap, and winged moccasins  on her feet. Then she went on the chase for real American wonder  stories, and for real American fairies.    [Illustration]    Had there not been a feather in the magic cap she wore, _Yeh sen noh  wehs_ would not have found them. But the feather pointed the way to the  Nature Wonder Trail, and there she caught a glimpse of the \"Little  People,\"--the only true American fairies.          THE LITTLE PEOPLE      All children who live close to Mother Earth come to know and to see the  fairies of the flowers, the woods, the rocks, and the waters.    These fairies the Iroquois call the _Jo gah oh_, or \"Little People,\"  because they are so small. The Little People can do wonderful things.  Whatever they wish, they can do. They can fly through the air. They can  dart under or through the water, into the earth and through the rocks,  as they please, for they wear invisible moccasins and travel in winged  canoes.    Their wee babies are carried on the little mothers' backs,--just like  the Indian's papoose. The little fathers have wonderful winged bows and  arrows, that can shoot any distance they wish.    [Illustration]    The Little People bring good luck to the Indians. Whatever Indian boys  and girls wish for,--if they wish hard enough, the _Jo gah oh_ will  bring to them.    It is said that there are three tribes of these Little People,--those  that live in the rocks beside streams and lakes, those that hover near  the flowers and plants, and those that guard the dark places under the  earth.    The rock Little People are very strong. They can uproot large trees and  can hurl great rocks. Sometimes they dare the Indians to a test of  strength with them. They also like to play ball with stones.    The Red Children fear the Stone Throwers, as they call them. But they  love the little folk that help the flowers to blossom, and the fruit and  grains to grow and ripen.    They remember these Little People in their Feasts of Thanksgiving, for  do the _Jo gah oh_ not help the sweet waters of the maple to flow? Do  they not whisper to the growing seeds and show the way to the light? Do  they not guide the runners of the strawberries, turn the blossoms to the  sun, and paint the berries red? They also tint the grains, and give to  the corn its good taste.    A third tribe of Little People dwell under the earth. They guard the  sacred white buffaloes, and keep the serpent monsters that live in the  darkness below from coming to the surface to the Red Children.    [Illustration]    There are trails that lead out to the sunlight, but the Little People  guard them close, although sometimes a great serpent will find the  trail of a spring, and will follow it and poison the waters.    Often, at night, these elves of the dark come to the upper world to  dance with the other Little People.    Wherever you find a tree in a deep, dark part of the wood, around which  no grass will grow, there you may be sure a dance ring has been formed.  There the Little People have danced till the moon dropped out of the  sky.    [Illustration: DANCE RATTLE]          STORY-TELLING TIME      The old-time Indians say that long, long ago, the Little People made a  law that stories must not be told in summer.    Summer is the time for work. Bees must store their honey. Squirrels must  gather their nuts. Men must grow their corn. Trees and plants must leaf,  and flower, and bear their fruit.    If stories were told, plants, birds, animals, and men would stop their  work to listen. This would mean poor crops and hungry people. Animals  would forget to grow their winter coats and lay by their winter stores.  Birds would fail to start in time for the South.    The old Indians say that the story-teller who disobeys this law of _Jo  gah oh_ will suffer some misfortune. Winter is the time to tell the  stories, for then the work of animals, plants, and men is done,--and the  Little People are fast asleep.    No, it is not safe to tell stories in summer. No one knows when a bird,  or a bee, or a butterfly may be listening, and may tell the chief of the  Little People. Should the chief of the Little People be offended, he  might cause something dreadful to happen to the story-teller.    Last summer, the writer of these stories came very near being changed  into an animal,--or something worse,--just for telling stories. So an  old Indian said. She does not know now how she escaped. She thinks it  must have been because she was a White Indian. This is how it happened.    It was at the time of the Harvest Moon. _Yeh sen noh wehs_ spoke for one  of the tribes at their council house, and she told some of these wonder  stories.    All went well until the middle of the night. Then a very old Indian  came to warn her of her danger. It seems that he had been at the council  in the evening, and had heard the stories told, many of which he knew.    He told _Yeh sen noh wehs_ he had expected to see her change into  something else right then and there. He said he would not dare to tell a  story. \"No, no, me 'fraid, evil come!\" he said.    Then he wanted to know if _Yeh sen noh wehs_ was a real Indian. He had  been told that she was a White Indian, but when he heard her tell the  stories, he said, he thought she was a real Indian.    When _Yeh sen noh wehs_ told him that she had not a drop of Indian blood  running in her veins, he looked very solemn. At last he spoke. He told  the interpreter to tell her,--for he spoke but a few words of  English,--that the Great Spirit made a snake, a snake; a fox, a fox; a  muskrat, a muskrat; a coon, a coon; a bear, a bear; an Indian, an  Indian; a White Indian, a White Indian. Each must be snake, fox, coon,  bear, Indian or White Indian, as long as he lived. Each must be himself.    Then the old man asked what disease _Yeh sen noh wehs_ had, that made  her go around with a feather in her hair, acting like a real Indian, if  she were a White Indian.    _Yeh sen noh wehs_ had no answer. And she does not know to this day,  what saved her from being changed into a rabbit, a katydid, or something  worse, by the chief of the Little People. She knows, however, that she  is very glad she is telling the stories to you, in the WINTER time.    [Illustration]          HOW THE IROQUOIS GIVE THANKS      The Iroquois Red Children are a grateful people. The true Iroquois never  rises after eating without saying, \"_Niaweh_,\" which means, \"I am  thankful.\" The others reply, \"_Niuh_,\"--\"It is well.\"    The Red Children never pick a flower without thinking how kind the Great  Spirit has been, to cause the flowers to grow. They like flowers, and no  matter how poor the Indian cabin, flowers are always to be found near.    When the Iroquois pick fruit, they give thanks to the Great Spirit. And  always do they leave some, for the \"little brothers of the wood.\"    They do not try to pick every cherry or berry, or nut or apple, for  themselves. Fruits grow for the birds and animals as well as for men,  and the little brothers of the wood must not be forgotten. Some of  everything that grows is left for them.    [Illustration: SAP BUCKET]    During the spring and summer, the Iroquois give several thanksgiving  feasts. The first is early in the spring, at maple-sugar time. As soon  as the sap begins to flow, the Maple Feast is called.    The Indians gather about a large maple tree. A fire is"]]]
