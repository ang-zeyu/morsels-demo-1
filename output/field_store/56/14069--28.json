In any case  this study is largely history written from the top down and is based  primarily on the written records left by the administrations of five  presidents and by civil rights leaders, service officials, and the  press.    Many of the attitudes and expressions voiced by the participants in  the story are now out of fashion. The reader must be constantly on  guard against viewing the beliefs and statements of many civilian and  military officials out of context of the times in which they were  expressed. Neither bigotry nor stupidity was the monopoly of some of  the people quoted; their statements are important for what they tell  us about certain attitudes of our society rather than for what they  reveal about any individual. If the methods or attitudes of some     (p. x)  of the black spokesmen appear excessively tame to those who have  lived through the 1960's, they too should be gauged in the context of  the times. If their statements and actions shunned what now seems the  more desirable, albeit radical, course, it should be given them that  the style they adopted appeared in those days to be the most promising  for racial progress.    The words _black_ and _Negro_ have been used interchangeably in the  book, with Negro generally as a noun and black as an adjective. Aware  of differing preferences in the black community for usage of these  words, the author was interested in comments from early readers of the  manuscript. Some of the participants in the story strongly objected to  one word or the other. \"Do me one favor in return for my help,\" Lt.  Comdr. Dennis D. Nelson said, \"never call me a black.\" Rear Adm.  Gerald E. Thomas, on the other hand, suggested that the use of the  term Negro might repel readers with much to learn about their recent  past. Still others thought that the historian should respect the usage  of the various periods covered in the story, a solution that would  have left the volume with the term _colored_ for most of the earlier  chapters and Negro for much of the rest. With rare exception, the term  black does not appear in twentieth century military records before the  late 1960's. Fashions in words change, and it is only for the time  being perhaps that black and Negro symbolize different attitudes. The  author has used the words as synonyms and trusts that the reader will  accept them as such. Professor John Hope Franklin, Mrs. Sara Jackson  of the National Archives, and the historians and officials that  constituted the review panel went along with this approach.    The second question of usage concerns the words _integration_ and  _desegregation_. In recent years many historians have come to  distinguish between these like-sounding words. Desegregation they see  as a direct action against segregation; that is, it signifies the act  of removing legal barriers to the equal treatment of black citizens as  guaranteed by the Constitution. The movement toward desegregation,  breaking down the nation's Jim Crow system, became increasingly  popular in the decade after World War II. Integration, on the other  hand, Professor Oscar Handlin maintains, implies several things not  yet necessarily accepted in all areas of American society. In one  sense it refers to the \"leveling of all barriers to association other  than those based on ability, taste, and personal preference\";[1] in  other words, providing equal opportunity. But in another sense  integration calls for the random distribution of a minority throughout  society. Here, according to Handlin, the emphasis is on racial balance  in areas of occupation, education, residency, and the like.                       [Footnote 1: Oscar Handlin, \"The Goals of Integration,\"                     _Daedalus 95_ (Winter 1966): 270.]    From the beginning the military establishment rightly understood that  the breakup of the all-black unit would in a closed society  necessarily mean more than mere desegregation. It constantly used the  terms integration and equal treatment and opportunity to describe its  racial goals. Rarely, if ever, does one find the word desegregation in  military files that include much correspondence from the various    (p. xi)  civil rights organizations. That the military made the right choice,  this study seems to demonstrate, for the racial goals of the Defense  Department, as they slowly took form over a quarter of a century,  fulfilled both of Professor Handlin's definitions of integration.    The mid-1960's saw the end of a long and important era in the racial  history of the armed forces. Although the services continued to  encounter racial problems, these problems differed radically in  several essentials from those of the integration period considered in  this volume. Yet there is a continuity to the story of race relations,  and one can hope that the story of how an earlier generation struggled  so that black men and women might serve their country in freedom  inspires those in the services who continue to fight discrimination.    This study benefited greatly from the assistance of a large number of  persons during its long years of preparation. Stetson Conn, chief  historian of the Army, proposed the book as an interservice project.  His successor, Maurice Matloff, forced to deal with the complexities  of an interservice project, successfully guided the manuscript through  to publication. The work was carried out under the general supervision  of Robert R. Smith, chief of the General History Branch. He and Robert  W. Coakley, deputy chief historian of the Army, were the primary  reviewers of the manuscript, and its final form owes much to their  advice and attention. The author also profited greatly from the advice  of the official review panel, which, under the chairmanship of Alfred  Goldberg, historian, Office of the Secretary of Defense, included  Martin Blumenson; General J. Lawton Collins (USA Ret.); Lt. Gen.  Benjamin O. Davis, Jr. (USAF Ret.); Roy K. Davenport, former Deputy  Assistant Secretary of the Army; Stanley L. Falk, chief historian of  the Air Force; Vice Adm. E. B. Hooper, Chief of Naval History;  Professor Benjamin Quarles; Paul J. Scheips, historian, Center of  Military History; Henry I. Shaw, chief historian of the U.S. Marine  Corps; Loretto C. Stevens, senior editor of the Center of Military  History; Robert J. Watson, chief historian of the Joint Chiefs of  Staff; and Adam Yarmolinsky, former assistant to the Secretary of  Defense.    Many of the participants in this story generously shared their  knowledge with me and kindly reviewed my efforts. My footnotes  acknowledge my debt to them. Nevertheless, two are singled out here  for special mention. James C. Evans, former counselor to the Secretary  of Defense for racial affairs, has been an endless source of  information on race relations in the military. If I sometimes  disagreed with his interpretations and assessments, I never doubted  his total dedication to the cause of the black serviceman. I owe a  similar debt to Lt. Comdr. Dennis D. Nelson (USN Ret.) for sharing his  intimate understanding of race relations in the Navy. A resourceful  man with a sure social touch, he must have been one hell of a sailor.    I want to note the special contribution of several historians. Martin  Blumenson was first assigned to this project, and before leaving the  Center of Military History he assembled research material that proved  most helpful. My former colleague John Bernard Corr prepared a study  on the National Guard upon which my account of the guard is based.  In addition, he patiently reviewed many pages of the draft         (p. xii)  manuscript. His keen insights and sensitive understanding were  invaluable to me. Professors Jack D. Foner and Marie Carolyn  Klinkhammer provided particularly helpful suggestions in conjunction  with their reviews of the manuscript. Samuel B. Warner, who before his  untimely death was a historian in the Joint Chiefs of Staff as well as  a colleague of Lee Nichols on some of that reporter's civil rights  investigations, also contributed generously of his talents and lent  his support in the early days of my work. Finally, I am grateful for  the advice of my colleague Ronald H. Spector at several key points in  the preparation of this history.    I have received much help from archivists and librarians, especially  the resourceful William H. Cunliffe and Lois Aldridge (now retired) of  the National Archives and Dean C. Allard of the Naval Historical  Center. Although the fruits of their scholarship appear often in my  footnotes, three fellow researchers in the field deserve special  mention: Maj. Alan M. Osur and Lt. Col. Alan L. Gropman of the U.S.  Air Force and Ralph W. Donnelly, former member of the U.S. Marine  Corps Historical Center. I have benefited from our exchange of ideas  and have had the advantage of their reviews of the manuscript.    I am especially grateful for the generous assistance of my editors,  Loretto C. Stevens and Barbara H. Gilbert. They have been both friends  and teachers. In the same vein, I wish to thank John Elsberg for his  editorial counsel. I also appreciate the help given by William G. Bell  in the selection of the illustrations, including the loan of two rare  items from his personal collection, and Arthur S. Hardyman for  preparing the pictures for publication. I would like to thank Mary Lee  Treadway and Wyvetra B. Yeldell for preparing the manuscript for panel  review and Terrence J. Gough for his helpful pre-publication review.    Finally, while no friend or relative was spared in the long years I  worked on this book, three colleagues especially bore with me through  days of doubts and frustrations and shared my small triumphs: Alfred  M. Beck, Ernest F. Fisher, Jr., and Paul J. Scheips. I also want"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2060"],[0,"The History of Caliph Vathek (#2)"],[1,"ses, the various gifts that Heaven had  bestowed on our globe.  In a word, Vathek omitted nothing in this palace  that might gratify the curiosity of those who resorted to it, although he  was not able to satisfy his own, for he was of all men the most curious.    \"The Palace of Perfumes,\" which was termed likewise \"The Incentive to  Pleasure,\" consisted of various halls, where the different perfumes which  the earth produces were kept perpetually burning in censers of gold.  Flambeaux and aromatic lamps were here lighted in open day.  But the too  powerful effects of this agreeable delirium might be avoided by  descending into an immense garden, where an assemblage of every fragrant  flower diffused through the air the purest odours.    The fifth palace, denominated \"The Retreat of Joy, or the Dangerous,\" was  frequented by troops of young females beautiful as the houris, and not  less seducing, who never failed to receive with caresses all whom the  Caliph allowed to approach them; for he was by no means disposed to be  jealous, as his own women were secluded within the palace he inhabited  himself.    Notwithstanding the sensuality in which Vathek indulged, he experienced  no abatement in the love of his people, who thought that a sovereign  immersed in pleasure was not less tolerable to his subjects than one that  employed himself in creating them foes.  But the unquiet and impetuous  disposition of the Caliph would not allow him to rest there; he had  studied so much for his amusement in the life-time of his father as to  acquire a great deal of knowledge, though not a sufficiency to satisfy  himself; for he wished to know everything, even sciences that did not  exist.  He was fond of engaging in disputes with the learned, but liked  them not to push their opposition with warmth; he stopped the mouths of  those with presents whose mouths could be stopped, whilst others, whom  his liberality was unable to subdue, he sent to prison to cool their  blood: a remedy that often succeeded.    Vathek discovered also a predilection for theological controversy, but it  was not with the orthodox that he usually held.  By this means he induced  the zealots to oppose him, and then persecuted them in return; for he  resolved at any rate to have reason on his side.    The great prophet Mahomet, whose vicars the caliphs are, beheld with  indignation from his abode in the seventh heaven the irreligious conduct  of such a vicegerent.  \"Let us leave him to himself,\" said he to the  genii, who are always ready to receive his commands; \"let us see to what  lengths his folly and impiety will carry him; if he run into excess we  shall know how to chastise him.  Assist him, therefore, to complete the  tower which, in imitation of Nimrod, he hath begun, not, like that great  warrior, to escape being drowned, but from the insolent curiosity of  penetrating the secrets of Heaven; he will not divine the fate that  awaits him.\"    The genii obeyed, and when the workmen had raised their structure a cubit  in the day-time, two cubits more were added in the night.  The expedition  with which the fabric arose was not a little flattering to the vanity of  Vathek.  He fancied that even insensible matter showed a forwardness to  subserve his designs, not considering that the successes of the foolish  and wicked form the first rod of their chastisement.    His pride arrived at its height when, having ascended for the first time  the eleven thousand stairs of his tower, he cast his eyes below, and  beheld men not larger than pismires, mountains than shells, and cities  than bee-hives.  The idea which such an elevation inspired of his own  grandeur completely bewildered him; he was almost ready to adore himself,  till, lifting his eyes upward, he saw the stars as high above him as they  appeared when he stood on the surface of the earth.  He consoled himself,  however, for this transient perception of his littleness with the thought  of being great in the eyes of others, and flattered himself that the  light of his mind would extend beyond the reach of his sight, and  transfer to the stars the decrees of his destiny.    With this view the inquisitive prince passed most of his nights on the  summit of his tower, till he became an adept in the mysteries of  astrology, and imagined that the planets had disclosed to him the most  marvellous adventures, which were to be accomplished by an extraordinary  personage from a country altogether unknown.  Prompted by motives of  curiosity, he had always been courteous to strangers, but from this  instant he redoubled his attention, and ordered it to be announced by  sound of trumpet, through all the streets of Samarah, that no one of his  subjects, on peril of displeasure, should either lodge or detain a  traveller, but forthwith bring him to the palace.    Not long after this proclamation there arrived in his metropolis a man so  hideous that the very guards who arrested him were forced to shut their  eyes as they led him along.  The Caliph himself appeared startled at so  horrible a visage, but joy succeeded to this emotion of terror when the  stranger displayed to his view such rarities as he had never before seen,  and of which he had no conception.    In reality, nothing was ever so extraordinary as the merchandise this  stranger produced; most of his curiosities, which were not less admirable  for their workmanship than splendour, had, besides, their several virtues  described on a parchment fastened to each.  There were slippers which  enabled the feet to walk; knives that cut without the motion of a hand;  sabres which dealt the blow at the person they were wished to strike; and  the whole enriched with gems that were hitherto unknown.    The sabres, whose blades emitted a dazzling radiance, fixed more than all  the Caliph's attention, who promised himself to decipher at his leisure  the uncouth characters engraven on their sides.  Without, therefore,  demanding their price, he ordered all the coined gold to be brought from  his treasury, and commanded the merchant to take what he pleased; the  stranger complied with modesty and silence.    Vathek, imagining that the merchant's taciturnity was occasioned by the  awe which his presence inspired, encouraged him to advance, and asked  him, with an air of condescension, \"Who he was? whence he came? and where  he obtained such beautiful commodities?\"  The man, or rather monster,  instead of making a reply, thrice rubbed his forehead, which, as well as  his body, was blacker than ebony, four times clapped his paunch, the  projection of which was enormous, opened wide his huge eyes, which glowed  like firebrands, began to laugh with a hideous noise, and discovered his  long amber-coloured teeth bestreaked with green.    The Caliph, though a little startled, renewed his inquiries, but without  being able to procure a reply; at which, beginning to be ruffled, he  exclaimed: \"Knowest thou, varlet, who I am? and at whom thou art aiming  thy gibes?\"  Then, addressing his guards, \"Have ye heard him speak? is he  dumb?\"    \"He hath spoken,\" they replied, \"though but little.\"    \"Let him speak again, then,\" said Vathek, \"and tell me who he is, from  whence he came, and where he procured these singular curiosities, or I  swear by the ass of Balaam that I will make him rue his pertinacity.\"    The menace was accompanied by the Caliph with one of his angry and  perilous glances, which the stranger sustained without the slightest  emotion, although his eyes were fixed on the terrible eye of the prince.    No words can describe the amazement of the courtiers when they beheld  this rude merchant withstand the encounter unshocked.  They all fell  prostrate with their faces on the ground to avoid the risk of their  lives, and continued in the same abject posture till the Caliph exclaimed  in a furious tone, \"Up, cowards! seize the miscreant! see that he be  committed to prison and guarded by the best of my soldiers!  Let him,  however, retain the money I gave him; it is not my intent to take from  him his property; I only want him to speak.\"    No sooner had he uttered these words than the stranger was surrounded,  pinioned with strong fetters, and hurried away to the prison of the great  tower, which was encompassed by seven empalements of iron bars, and armed  with spikes in every direction longer and sharper than spits.    The Caliph, nevertheless, remained in the most violent agitation; he sat  down indeed to eat, but of the three hundred covers that were daily  placed before him could taste of no more than thirty-two.  A diet to  which he had been so little accustomed was sufficient of itself to  prevent him from sleeping; what then must be its effect when joined to  the anxiety that preyed upon his spirits?  At the first glimpse of dawn  he hastened to the prison, again to importune this intractable stranger;  but the rage of Vathek exceeded all bounds on finding the prison empty,  the gates burst asunder, and his guards lying lifeless around him.  In  the paroxysm of his passion he fell furiously on the poor carcases, and  kicked them till evening without intermission.  His courtiers and vizirs  exerted their efforts to soothe his extravagance, but finding every  expedient ineffectual, they all united in one vociferation: \"The Caliph  is gone mad! the Caliph is out of his senses!\"    This outcry, which soon resounded through the streets of Samarah, at  length reaching the ears of Carathis, his mother, she flew in the utmost  consternation to try her ascendency on the mind of her son.  Her tears  and caresses called off his attention, and he was prevailed upon by her  entreaties to be brought back to the palace.    Carathis, apprehensive of leaving Vathek to himself, caused him to be put  to bed, and seating herself by him, endeavoured by her conversation to  heal and compose him.  Nor could any one have attempted it with better  success, for the Caliph not only"]]]
