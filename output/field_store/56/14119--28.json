As a wide sandy desert intervened between the shores of the  Mediterranean and the centre of Africa, it was naturally supposed that  the unknown region could be more easily reached from the west coast than  over that barren district, and, soon after the return of Lucas, Major  Haughton, a high-spirited, gallant officer who had lived some time in  Morocco, volunteered to make his way along the bank of the Gambia  eastward, under the belief that a journey by land was more likely to  succeed than one by water.  Some way up that river is the the town of  Pisania, where an English factory had been established, and a few  Europeans were settled, with a medical man, Dr Laidley.  Leaving this  place, he proceeded to Tisheet, a place in the Great Desert, hoping from  thence to reach Timbuctoo; but, robbed by a Moorish chief, of everything  he possessed, he wandered alone through the desert, till, exhausted by  hunger and thirst, he sat down under a tree and died.  The news of his  fate was brought to Dr Laidley soon afterwards by some negroes.    These expeditions threw no light on the interior of the continent.  A  fresh volunteer, however, Mungo Park, then unknown to fame, was soon to  commence those journeys which have immortalised his name, and which  contributed so greatly to solve one of the chief African problems--the  course of the Niger.

Mungo Park, who long ranked as the chief of African travellers, was born  on the 10th of September, 1771, at Fowlshiels, a farm occupied by his  father on the banks of the Yarrow, not far from the town of Selkirk, in  Scotland.    The elder Mr Park, also called Mungo, was a substantial yeoman of  Ettrick Forest, and was distinguished for his unremitting attention to  the education of his children, the greater number of whom he saw  respectably settled in life.  The young Mungo, after receiving with his  brothers a course of education at home under a private tutor, was sent  to the Grammar School at Selkirk, and at the age of fifteen was  apprenticed to Mr Thomas Anderson, a surgeon of that town.  Hence he  removed to the University of Edinburgh, and during his vacations made a  tour with his brother-in-law, Mr Dickson, a distinguished botanist.  On  going to London he was introduced by his relative to Sir Joseph Banks,  whose interest procured for him the appointment of assistant surgeon to  the \"Worcester,\" East Indiaman.  Returning from India, he offered his  services to the African Association, who, notwithstanding the failure of  the first expeditions they had sent out, still determined to persevere  in their efforts.    Possessed of unbounded courage and perseverance, he was admirably fitted  for the task he undertook, and his offer was gladly accepted.    Having received his final instructions from the African Association, he  sailed from Portsmouth on the 22nd of May, 1795, on board the  \"Endeavour,\" an African trader bound for the Gambia, where he arrived on  the 21st of the following month.    His directions were to make his way to the Niger, by Bambook or any  other route, to ascertain the course of that river, and to visit the  principal towns in its neighbourhood, particularly Timbuctoo and Houssa,  and afterwards to return by way of the Gambia or any other route he  might deem advisable.    Houssa is not a city, as was then supposed, but a kingdom or province.    The vessel anchored on the 21st of June at Jillifree, where he landed  and from thence proceeded up the Gambia to Pisania.  The only white  residents were Dr Laidley and two merchants of the name of Ainsley,  with their numerous black domestics.  It is in the dominions of the King  of Yany, who afforded them protection.    Assisted by Dr Laidley, Park here set to work to learn the Mandingo  tongue, and to collect information from certain black traders called  Seedees.  During his residence at Pisania he was confined for two months  by a severe fever, from which he recovered under the constant care of  his host.    A coffle, or caravan, being about to start for the interior of Africa,  Park, having purchased a hardy and spirited horse and two asses,  arranged to accompany it.  He obtained also the services of Johnson, a  negro who spoke both English and Mandingo.  Dr Laidley also provided  him with a negro boy named Demba, a sprightly youth who spoke, besides  Mandingo, the language of a large tribe in the interior.  His baggage  consisted only of a small stock of provisions, beads, amber and tobacco,  for the purchase of food on the road; a few changes of linen, an  umbrella, pocket compass, magnetic compass and thermometer, with a  fowling-piece, two pair of pistols and other small articles.  Four  Mahommedan blacks also offered their services as his attendants.  They  were going to travel on foot, driving their horses before them.  These  six attendants regarded him with great respect, and were taught to  consider that their safe return to the countries of the Gambia would  depend on his preservation.    Dr Laidley and the Mr Ainsleys accompanied him for the two first days,  secretly believing that they should never see him again.    Taxes are demanded from travellers at every town, by the chiefs.    Madina was the first town of any size he reached.  He was here received  by King Jatta, a venerable old man, who had treated Major Haughton with  great kindness.  He was seated on a mat before his hut, a number of men  and women ranged on either side, who were singing and clapping their  hands.  Park, saluting him respectfully, informed him of the purport of  his visit.  The king replied that he not only gave him leave to pass,  but would offer up his prayers for his safety.  He warned him, however,  of the dangers he would encounter, observing that the people in the east  differed greatly from those of his country, who were acquainted with  white men and respected them.    The king having provided a guide, Park took his departure, reaching  Konjowar the next night.  Here, having purchased a sheep, he found  Johnson and one of his negroes quarrelling about the horns.  It appeals  that these horns are highly valued as being easily converted into  sheaths for keeping secure certain charms, called _saphies_.  These  _saphies_ are sentences from the Koran, which the Mahommedan priests  write on scraps of paper and sell to the natives, who believe that they  possess extraordinary virtues.  They indeed consider the art of writing  as bordering on magic; and it is not in the doctrines of the Prophet,  but in the arts of the magician that their confidence is placed.    On the 8th, entering Koloa, a considerable town, he observed hanging on  a tree a masquerading habit, made of bark, which he was told belonged to  Mumbo Jumbo, a sort of wood demon, held greatly in awe, especially by  the female part of the community.  This strange bugbear is common to all  the Mandingo towns, and much employed by the pagan negroes in keeping  their women in subjection.  As the Kaffirs, or pagan Africans, are not  restricted in the number of their wives, every one marries as many as he  can conveniently maintain; and it frequently happens that the ladies  disagree among themselves, their quarrels sometimes reaching to such a  height that the authority of the husband can no longer preserve peace in  his household,--in such cases the interposition of Mumbo Jumbo is called  in and is always decisive.  This strange minister of justice, who is  supposed to be either the husband or some person instructed by him,  disguised in the dress which has just been mentioned, and armed with the  rod of public authority, announces his coming by loud and dismal screams  in the woods near the town.    He begins the pantomime at the approach of night, and as soon as it is  dark he enters the town and proceeds to the _bentang_, or public  meeting-house, at which all the inhabitants immediately assemble.  The  women do not especially relish this exhibition; for, as the person in  disguise is entirely unknown to them, every married female suspects that  the visit may possibly be intended for her; but they dare not refuse to  appear when summoned.    The ceremony commences with songs and dances, which continue till  midnight, about which time Mumbo fixes on the offender.  The unfortunate  victim being thereupon immediately seized, is stripped naked, tied to a  post, and receives a severe switching with Mumbo's rod, amidst the  derisive shouts of the whole assembly, the rest of the women being the  loudest in their exclamations against their unhappy sister.  Daylight  puts an end to the unmanly revel.    The desert was now to be passed, in which no water was to be procured.  The caravan therefore travelled rapidly till they arrived at Koojar, the  frontier town of Woolli, on the road to Bondou, from which it is  separated by another intervening wilderness of two days' journey.    While crossing the desert, they came to a tree, adorned with scraps of  cloth, probably at first hung up to inform other travellers that water  was to be found near it; but the custom has been so sanctioned by time  that nobody presumes to pass without hanging up something.  Park  followed the example and suspended a handsome piece of cloth on one of  the boughs.  Finding, however, a fire, which the negroes thought had  been made by banditti, they"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21400"],[0,"Style in Singing (#2)"],[1,"of his  compass, possibly of good quality and resonance, and gains a minor or  major third above the high G (sol) of a very poor, strained character.  The compass of the voice remains exactly the same. He has merely  exchanged several excellent tones below for some very poor ones above.  I repeat, one who aspires to be a lyric artist requires the best  possible teacher to guide his first steps; he may consult an inferior  or incompetent professor, when so firmly established in the right path  that he cannot possibly be led astray.    It is a common belief that singing-teachers of reputation do not care  to occupy themselves with voice-production, or are unable to teach it.  This is a serious error. A competent professor of singing is as  capable of imparting the principles of this most important branch, as  of directing the more aesthetic studies of Style and Repertoire. All  the really great and illustrious singing-masters of the past preferred  to \"form\" the voices of their pupils. To continue and finish a  predecessor's work, or to erect a handsome and solid structure on  defective foundations, is always a difficult task; sometimes an  impossible one.    Then, as regards the pupil, particularly one studying with a view to a  professional career, a defective preparatory training may eventually  mean serious material loss. The money and time spent on his vocal  education is, in his case, an investment, not an outlay; the  investment will be a poor one, should it be necessary later to devote  further time and expend more money to correct natural defects that  ought to have been corrected at the beginning of his studies, or to  eradicate faults acquired during their progress.    Furthermore, the purpose of some part of a singer's preliminary  education is to strengthen and fit the voice for the exacting demands  of a professional career. As the training of an athlete--rower,  runner, boxer, wrestler--not only perfects his technical skill, but  also, by a process of gradual development, enables him to endure the  exceptional strain he will eventually have to bear in a contest, so  some of a singer's early studies prepare his voice for the tax to  which hereafter it will be subjected. If those studies have been  insufficient, or ill-directed, failure awaits the debutant when he  presents himself before the public in a spacious theatre or  concert-hall and strives, ineffectually, to dominate the powerful  sonorities of the large orchestras which are a necessity for modern  scores. A sound and judiciously graduated preparatory training, in  fact, is essential if the singer would avoid disappointment or a  fiasco.    The vocal education of many students, however, is nowadays hurried  through with a haste that is equalled only by the celerity with which  such aspirants for lyric honours return to obscurity.          CHAPTER II    THE VALUE OF TECHNIQUE      Briefly defined, the singer's Technique may be said to consist  principally of the ability to govern the voice in its three phases of  Pitch, Colour, and Intensity. That is, he must be able to sing every  note throughout the compass of the voice (Pitch) in different  qualities or timbres (Colour), and with various degrees of power  (Intensity). And although the modern schools of composition for the  voice do not encourage the display of florid execution, a singer would  be ill-advised indeed to neglect this factor, on the plea that it has  no longer any practical application. No greater error is conceivable.  Should an instrumental virtuoso fail to acquire mastery of  transcendental difficulties, his performance of any piece would not be  perfect: the greater includes the less. A singer would be very  short-sighted who did not adopt an analogous line of reasoning.  Without an appreciable amount of _agilita_, the performance of modern  music is laboured and heavy; that of the classics, impossible. In  fact, virtuosity, if properly understood, is as indispensable to-day  as ever it was. As much vocal virtuosity is required to interpret  successfully the music of Falstaff, in Verdi's opera, as is necessary  for _Maometto Secondo_ or _Semiramide_ by Rossini. It is simply  another form of virtuosity; that is all. The lyric grace or dramatic  intensity of many pages of Wagner's music-dramas can be fully revealed  only through a voice that has been rendered supple by training, and  responsive to the slightest suggestion of an artistic temperament.    In short, virtuosity may have changed in form, but it is still one of  the cornerstones of the singer's art. An executive artist will spare  no pains to acquire perfect technical skill; for the _metier_, or  mechanical elements of any art, can be acquired, spontaneous though  the results may sometimes appear. Its primary use is, and should be,  to serve as a medium of interpretation. True, virtuosity is frequently  a vehicle for personal display, as, notably, in the operas of  Cimarosa, Bellini, Donizetti, and the earlier works of Rossini and  Verdi. At its worst, however, it is a practical demonstration of the  fact that the executant, vocal or instrumental, has completely  mastered the mechanical elements of his profession; that, to use the  _argot_ of the studios, \"_il connait son metier_\" (he knows his  trade).    Imperfect technique, indeed, is to be deprecated, if merely for the  reason that it may debar a singer from interpreting accurately the  composer's ideas. How seldom, if ever, even in the best lyric  theatres, is the following passage heard as the composer himself  indicated:    [Music: \"Plus blanche\"    Les Huguenots: Act I    Meyerbeer    Plus pure, plus pure qu'un jour de printemps]    or the concluding phrase of \"Celeste Aida\" (in _Aida_, Act I), as  Verdi wrote it and wished it to be sung:    [Music: un trono vicino al sol, un trono vicino al sol.]    At present the majority of operatic tenors, to whom are assigned the  strong tenor (_fort tenor_) roles, can sing the higher tones of their  compass only in _forte_, and with full voice. Thus an additional and  very charming effect is lost to them. Yet Adolphe Nourrit, who created  the role of Raoul in _Les Huguenots_, sang, it is said, the phrase as  written. The late Italo Campanini, Sims Reeves, and the famous Spanish  tenor Gayarre, were all able to sing the    [Music]    _mezza voce_, by a skilled use of the covered tones.    I do not ignore the fact that cases occur where artists, owing to some  physiological peculiarity or personal idiosyncrasy, are unable to  overcome certain special difficulties; where, indeed, the effort would  produce but meagre results. But such instances are the exception, not  the rule. The lyric artist who is gifted merely with a beautiful  voice, over which he has acquired but imperfect control, is at the  mercy of every slight indisposition that may temporarily affect the  quality and sonority of his instrument. But he who is a \"singer\" in  the real and artistic sense of the word, he who has acquired skill in  the use of the voice, is armed at all points against such accidents.  By his art, by clever devices of varied tone-colour and degrees of  intensity, he can so screen the momentary loss of brilliance, etc., as  to conceal that fact from his auditors, who imagine him to be in the  possession of his normal physical powers. The technical or mechanical  part of any art can be taught and learned, as I have said. It is only  a case of well-guided effort. Patience and unceasing perseverance will  in this, as in all other matters, achieve the desired result. Nature  gives only the ability and aptitude to acquire; it is persistent study  which enables their possessor to arrive at perfection. Serious and  lasting results are obtained only by constant practice. It is a  curious fact that many people more than usually gifted arrive only at  mediocrity. Certain things, such as the trill or scales, come  naturally easy to them. This being the case, they neglect to perfect  their _agilita_, which remains defective. Others, although but  moderately endowed, have arrived at eminence by sheer persistence and  rightly directed study. It is simply a musical version of the Hare and  the Tortoise.           *       *       *       *       *    But we must make a great distinction between the preliminary exercises  which put the singer in full possession of the purely mechanical  branch of his art (Technique), and the aesthetic studies in Taste and  the research for what dramatic authors call \"the Science of Effect,\"  or Style. The former must be thoroughly accomplished, otherwise the  latter cannot be undertaken satisfactorily. A good and reliable  technique is undoubtedly of primary necessity. But it is by no means  all. One may have a voice which is well-posed and of good resonance,  and also have sufficient flexibility to perform neatly all the rapid  passages with which the pages of the classic composers abound. But  this is not singing; nor is the possessor of these an artist. He has  simply the necessary and preliminary knowledge which should enable him  to become one, by further study of the aesthetic side of the art of  singing. He has, as it were, collected the materials necessary for the  erection of a splendid edifice, and has now to learn the effective  means of combining them. So, when the voice is \"formed,\" a frank and  easy emission obtained, a sufficiency of Technique acquired, the next  step in the singer's education is the practical study of the problem  of Style.          CHAPTER III    ANALYSIS OF STYLE      What is Style?    In reality the question is two-fold. One may have Style; and one may  have _a_ style. The former is general; the latter individual. The  former can be taught and learned, for it is based on certain  well-defined rules; the latter is personal--in other words, is not  universally applicable. Not infrequently it is a particular  application of those rules which gives the impress of originality."]]]
