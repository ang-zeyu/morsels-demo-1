Of all our enemies Cad Prog was the most truculent, and most  feared.  The sight of his red head coming round the corner was always  enough to strike panic into a score of youngsters, and even we bigger  boys always looked meek when Prog came out to defy us.    He was strolling guilelessly along, and didn't see us at first.  Then  suddenly he caught sight of us approaching, and next moment the blue  apron and red head disappeared with a bolt round the corner.    \"Come on!\" shouted Rasper, who led.    \"So we are!\" cried we, and hue and cry was made for Cad Prog forthwith.    We sighted him as we turned the corner.  He was making straight for the  market.  Perhaps to get an axe, I thought, or to hide, or to tell my  uncle!    \"Come on!\" was the shout.    It's wonderful how a short sharp chase warms up the blood even of a  small boy of twelve.  Before we were half down the street, even Bates  had no thought left of deserting, and we all four pressed on, each  determined not to be last.    The fugitive Prog kept his course to the market, but there doubled  suddenly and bolted down Side Street.  That was where he lived; he was  going to run into his hole then, like a rabbit.    We gained no end on him in the turn, and were nearly up to him as he  reached the door of his humble home.    He bolted in--so did we.  He bolted up stairs--so did we.  He plunged  headlong into a room where was a little girl rocking a cradle--so did  we.  Then began a wild scuffle.    \"Catch him!  Take his cap off!\" cried Bobbins.    \"He hasn't got a cap!\" cried Rasper--\"butcher-boys never have!\"    \"Then pull off his apron!\" was the cry.    In the scuffle the little girl was trodden on, and the cradle clean  upset.  A crowd collected in the street.  Cad Prog roared as loud as he  could, so did his little sister, so did the baby, so did Jimmy Bates, so  did Joe Bobbins, so did Harry Rasper, so did I.  _I_ did not care what  happened; I went for Cad Prog, and have a vague idea of my hand and his  nose being near together, and louder yells still.    Then all of a sudden there was a tramp of heavy footsteps on the stairs,  and all I can remember after that was receiving a heavy cuff on my head,  being dragged down into the street, where--so it seemed to me for the  moment--at least a million people must have been congregated; and,  finally, I know not how, I was standing in the middle of my uncle's  study floor, with my coat gone, my mouth bleeding, and my cap, after  all, clean vanished!    It was a queer plight to be in.  I heard a dinning in my ears of loud  voices, and when I looked at the bust on the top of the bookcase it  seemed to be toppling about anyhow.  Some people were talking in the  room, but the only voice I could recognise was my uncle's.  He was  saying something about \"not wanting to shield me,\" and \"locking-up,\" the  drift of which I afterwards slowly gathered, when the village  policeman--we only had one at Brownstroke--addressing my uncle as \"your  honour,\" said he would look in in the morning for further orders.    At this interesting juncture the bust began to wobble about again, and I  saw and heard no more till I woke next morning, and found Mrs Hudson  mopping my forehead with something, and saying, \"There now, Master  Freddy, lie quite still, there's a good boy.\"    \"What's the matter?\" said I, putting up my hand to the place she was  washing.    It was something like a bump!    \"It's only a bruise, Master Freddy--no bones broken, thank God!\" said  she, motioning me to be silent.    But I was in no mood to be silent.  Slowly the recollection of  yesterday's events dawned on me.    \"Did they get off Cad Prog's apron,\" I inquired, \"after all?\"    Of course, the good old soul thought this was sheer wandering of the  mind, and she looked very frightened, and implored me to lie still.    It was a long time before I perceived any connection between our chase  of the redoubtable Cad Prog up Side Street yesterday and my lying here  bruised and in a darkened room to-day.  At last I supposed Mr Prog must  have conquered me; whereat I fired up again, and said, \"Did the other  fellows finish him up?\"    \"Oh, dear me, yes,\" said the terrified nurse; \"all up, every bit--there  now--and asked for more!\"    This consoled me.  Presently a doctor came and looked at my forehead,  and left some powders, which I heard him say I was to take in jam three  times a day.  I felt still more consoled.    In fact, reader, as you will have judged, I was a little damaged by the  adventure in Side Street, and the noble exploit of my companions and  myself had not ended all in glory.    A day or two after, when I got better, I found out more about it, and  rather painfully too, because my uncle landed one day in my bedroom and  commenced strongly to arraign me before him.    He bade me tell him what had happened, which I did as well as I could.  At the end of it he said, \"I suppose you are not aware that for a day or  two it was uncertain whether you had not killed that child that was in  the room?\"    \"I?\"  I exclaimed.  \"I never touched her!  Indeed I didn't, uncle!\"    \"You knocked over the cradle,\" said my uncle, \"and that's much the same  thing.\"    I was silent.  My uncle proceeded.    \"And I suppose you are not aware that the barber who tried to take you  down the stairs is now in the hospital with an abscess on his leg, the  result of the kick you gave him?\"    \"Oh, I can't have done it, uncle--oh, uncle!\"    And here I was so overwhelmed with the vision of my enormities and their  possible consequences that I became hysterical, and Mrs Hudson was  summoned to the rescue.    The fact was, in the account of the fray I appear to have got credit for  all the terrible deeds that were there done; and I, Master Freddy  Batchelor, was, it appeared, notorious in the village as having been  guilty of a savage and felonious assault upon one C.  Prog, of having  also assaulted and almost \"manslaughtered\" Miss Prog the younger, and  further of having dealt with my feet against the shin of one Moppleton,  a barber, in such manner as to render him incapable of pursuing his  ordinary avocations, and being chargeable on the parish infirmary;  besides sundry and divers damage to carpets, crockery, glass, doorposts,  kerb-stones, and the jacket of the aforesaid C.  Prog.  On the whole,  when I arose from my bed and stepped once more into the outer world, I  found myself a very atrocious character indeed.    At home I was in disgrace, and abroad I was not allowed to wander beyond  my uncle's garden, except to church on Sunday under a heavy escort.  So  on the whole I had not a very good time of it.  My uncle was  terrifically glum, and appeared to think it most audacious if ever I  chanced to laugh or sing or express any sentiment but deep grief and  contrition in his presence.  Mrs Hudson read me long lectures about the  evil of slaying small children and laming barbers, and I was  occasionally moved to tears at the thought of my own iniquities.  But at  the age of twelve it is hard to take upon oneself the settled gloom of  an habitual criminal, and I was forced to let out at times and think of  other things besides my wicked ways.  I got let off school--that was one  alleviation to my woe--and being free of the garden I had plenty of  opportunity of letting off the steam.  But it was slow work, as I have  said; and I was really relieved when, a week or two afterwards, my uncle  made the announcement with which this chapter begins.    How I fared, first at Stonebridge House, and subsequently in the City  Life for which it was meant to train me, will be the theme of this  particular veracious history.        CHAPTER TWO.    HOW I MADE MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH STONEBRIDGE HOUSE.    The eventful Monday came at last, and with my little box corded up, with  Mrs Hudson as an escort, and a pair of brand-new knickerbockers upon my  manly person, I started off from my uncle's house in the coach for  Stonebridge, with all the world before me.    I had taken a rather gloomy farewell of my affectionate relative in his  study.  He had cautioned me as to my conduct, and given me to understand  that at Stonebridge House I should be a good deal more strictly looked  after than I had ever been with him.  Saying which he had bestowed on me  a threepenny-bit as \"pocket-money\" for the term, and wished me good-bye.  Under the circumstances I was not greatly overcome by this leave-  taking, and settled down to make myself comfortable for my long drive  with Mrs Hudson to Stonebridge.    Mrs Hudson had been my nurse ever since I could remember, and now the  poor old soul and I were to part for good.  For she was to see me safely  inside the doors of Stonebridge House, and then go back, not to my  uncle's (where she would no longer be needed), but to her own home.  Of  course she was very much depressed by the prospect, and so indeed was I.  For a good while we neither of us said much.  Then, by way of changing  the subject and beguiling the way, she began to address to me long and  solemn exhortations as to my conduct at the new school.  She knew as  much about \"schools for backward and troublesome boys\" as I did; but  that was no matter.    She made me promise, for one thing, that I would make a point of wearing  a clean collar three times a week; and, for another, of calling the  housekeeper's attention to the very first sign of a hole in my socks.  (As my socks, by the way, usually showed the daylight in upon six out of  the ten toes, and one out of the two heels every time I took off my  boots, I was promising a lot when I made this bargain!)  Further, I was  to see my Sunday clothes were always _hung_ on pegs, and not _laid_ in "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21059"],[0,"The Adventures of Dick Maitland: A Tale of Unknown Africa (#2)"],[1,"widow during her  lifetime, subject to the proper maintenance and education of their only  son, Dick; and upon the demise of Mrs Maitland the capital was to go to  Dick, to be employed by the latter as he might deem fit.  But a clause  in the will stipulated that at the close of his school career Dick was  to be put to such business or profession as the lad might choose, Mr  Maitland pithily remarking that he did not believe in drones.  But since  Mrs Maitland, although a most excellent woman in every respect, had no  head for business, her husband appointed honest old John Cuthbertson,  his own and his father's solicitor, sole executor of his will; and so  died happily, in the full conviction that he had done everything that  was humanly possible to assure the future welfare of his widow and  infant son.  And faithfully had John Cuthbertson discharged his trust,  until in the fullness of years he had laid down the burden of life, and  his son Jonas had come to reign in the office in his father's stead.  This event had occurred some three years previously, about the time when  Dick, having completed his school life, had elected to take up the study  of medicine and surgery.    This important step had involved many interviews between Mrs Maitland  and \"Mr Jonas\", as the clerks in his father's office had learned to  call him; for the said Mr Jonas had succeeded to the executorship of  many wills--Mr Maitland's among them--as well as the other portions of  his father's business; and so great had been the zeal and interest that  he had displayed during the necessary negotiations, that Mrs Maitland  had been most favourably impressed.  Indeed Jonas Cuthbertson had  honestly earned the very high opinion that Mrs Maitland had formed of  him, displaying not only interest and zeal but also a considerable  amount of acumen in the matter of Dick's placing.  For, when Mrs  Maitland, perhaps very naturally, expressed the wish that Dick should  begin his studies under the guidance of some eminent Harley Street  specialist, the solicitor strenuously opposed the idea, not only upon  the score of expense, but also because, as he argued, Dick would  certainly acquire a wider knowledge of diseases and their cure--and  acquire it much more quickly--under some hard-working practitioner among  the East-End poor of London; and that, as he very truly pointed out, was  the great desideratum in such a case as Dick's, far outweighing the  extra hard work and the sordid surroundings to which Mrs Maitland had  at first so strenuously objected.  Moreover, Dick agreed with the  solicitor; and in the end the maternal objections were overcome, careful  enquiries were instituted, and finally Dick found himself installed as a  pupil in the somewhat Bohemian establishment of Doctor Julian Humphreys,  M.D., M.R.C.P., M.R.C.S., and several other letters of the alphabet.  And, queer though the arrangement was in many respects, it proved  eminently satisfactory to Dick; for Dr Humphreys was not only an  extraordinarily able physician and surgeon, but also marvellously clever  and learned outside the bounds of his profession, gentle and tender-  hearted as a woman, and a thoroughly good fellow all round, in the best  and highest sense of the term.  As for Dick, he displayed from the  outset a quite exceptional aptitude for the noble profession which he  had chosen; study, instead of being irksome, was a pleasure--almost a  passion--with him; his nerves were steel, he never for a moment lost his  head even when assisting at the most sickening operation; his touch was  light and sure; and knowledge seemed to come to him intuitively.  No  wonder that Doctor Humphreys persistently predicted a brilliant and  successful career for his pupil.    Upon his arrival home Dick found his mother in such an acute state of  distress that for the first few moments of their interview she seemed to  be quite incapable of making any intelligible statement: she could do  nothing but weep copiously upon her stalwart son's shoulder and gasp  that they were ruined--utterly and irretrievably ruined!  At length,  however, the lad managed to extract from Mrs Maitland the statement  that she had seen, in the previous morning's papers, an account of the  suicide of Mr Jonas Cuthbertson, a solicitor; and, judging from the  name and other particulars given in the published account, that it must  be their Mr Cuthbertson, she had hurried up to town and called at  Cuthbertson's chambers, where her worst apprehensions had received  complete and terrible confirmation.  From the particulars supplied by  Mr Herbert, Cuthbertson's chief clerk, it appeared that \"Mr Jonas\",  after walking worthily in his father's footsteps for two years, had  become infected with the gambling craze, and, first losing all his own  money, had finally laid hands upon as much of his clients' property as  he could obtain access to, until, his ill luck still pursuing him, he  had lost that also, and then had sought to evade the consequences of his  misdeeds by blowing out his brains with two shots from a revolver.  This  final act of folly had been perpetrated two days before the account of  it in the papers had fallen under Mrs Maitland's notice, and in the  interim there had, of course, been time only to make a very cursory  examination into the affairs of the suicide, but that examination had  sufficed to reveal the appalling fact that every available security,  both of his own and of his clients, had disappeared, while sufficient  evidence had been discovered to show pretty clearly what had led to  their disappearance.    This was the sum and substance of Mrs Maitland's somewhat incoherently  told story, and when Dick had heard it through to the end he had no  reason to doubt its truth; but manifestly it was not at all the sort of  story to be taken upon trust, it must be fully and completely  investigated, if only for the purpose of ascertaining whether or not  anything, however small, was to be saved from the wreck; accordingly,  after partaking of a hasty lunch, young Maitland wended his way to the  City, and there had a most discouraging interview with Mr Herbert, who  was by this time busily engaged upon the preparation of a detailed  statement of the position of affairs, for the information of his late  employer's clients and creditors.  This, Mr Herbert explained, was  proving a task of much less difficulty than he had anticipated, since  Cuthbertson had apparently kept an accurate account of all his gambling  transactions--some of which had, latterly, been upon a gigantic scale--  with the evidently desperate resolution of recovering his former losses,  or ruining himself in the attempt, while he had not destroyed any of his  papers, as so many suicides do before perpetrating the final act of  folly.  The position of affairs, as outlined by Mr Herbert, was gloomy  enough, but he made it clear to Dick that for the moment he was speaking  with reserve, as it was impossible for him to say anything of an  absolutely definite character until the investigation--which was being  conducted with the aid of a firm of chartered accountants of high  standing--should be complete.    Having now ascertained all in connection with the deplorable business  that was for the moment possible, Dick returned to his mother and did  his best to comfort and encourage her; but, as might have been expected,  his efforts met with no very great measure of success, seeing that there  was practically nothing of a comforting or encouraging character in the  story told him by Jonas Cuthbertson's chief clerk.    The next morning Dick Maitland returned to Number 19 Paradise Street,  where he found his friend Humphreys as busily engaged as ever in his  work of healing the sick and comforting the sorrowing poor, and received  a welcome from the cheery, genial medico that seemed to ease his  shoulders of at least half their load of anxiety.  But it was not until  well on towards evening that the claims upon the Doctor's time and  attention slackened sufficiently to afford an opportunity for Dick to  tell his story, which, after all, was only an amplified edition of the  story originally told in Mrs Maitland's letter.    When at length the tale was fully told, and Humphreys had, by dint of  much cross-questioning, fully mastered all its miserable details, he sat  for half an hour or more, smoking diligently and silently as he  considered in what way he could best help his young friend.  At length,  however, an idea seemed to occur to him, for he looked up and said:    \"Well, Dick, my friend, it sounds about as bad as anything that I have  heard of for many a long day!  Why in the world did that fool of a  lawyer want to meddle with gambling?  Why could he not have been content  to devote his energies to the conduct of the business--a first-class  one, according to his chief clerk's account--which his father left him,  and which would have provided him with a very comfortable living all his  days and, probably, a snug competency to retire upon when he found  himself getting too old for work?  I tell you what it is, my boy: this  mad craving to get rich quickly is one of the great curses of these  latter days.  When it once gets a firm grip upon its victim it quickly  converts the honest, upright man into a conscienceless rogue, who soon  becomes the centre of a widespread circle of ruin and untold misery!  Look at this fellow Cuthbertson.  He had an honest and honourable  father; and, as I understand you, was, to start with, himself perfectly  honest and honourable; yet look at him now!  What is he?  Why, simply a  dishonoured corpse, hastily huddled away into a suicide's grave; a man  who, having utterly spoiled his life, has presumptuously and prematurely  hurried into the presence of his Maker, burdened not only with the heavy  load of his own sin but also with the responsibility for all the ruin  and misery which he has left behind "]]]
