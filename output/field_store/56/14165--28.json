[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22345"],[0,"Memoirs of the Private Life, Return, and Reign of Napoleon in 1815, Vol. I (#2)"],[1,"naturally led me, to conclude these Memoirs by a  philosophical examination of the Hundred Days, and a refutation of the  reproaches daily bestowed on the men of the 20th of March: but  considerations, easy to divine, held my pen. It was my duty, to  content myself with placing a statement of the facts before the eyes  of the grand jury, the public, and leave it to decide. I know, that  the question has been determined in the fields of Waterloo; but a  victory is not a judicial sentence.    Whatever opinion the impartial reader may form of this work, I can  protest beforehand, that I have not allowed myself to be influenced by  any private consideration, by any feeling of hatred, affection, or  gratitude. I have followed no impulse but that of my conscience, and I  may say with Montaigne: \"This is an honest book.\"    Too young to have participated in the errors or crimes of the  revolution, I began and ended my political career without blot, and  without reproach. The places, titles, and decorations, which the  Emperor deigned to bestow on me, were the reward of several acts of  great devotion to his service, and of twelve years of trials and  sacrifices. Never did I receive from him any favours or gifts: I  entered his service rich, I quitted it poor.    When Lyons opened to him its gates, I was free: I spontaneously  embraced his cause: it appeared to me, as to the immense number of  Frenchmen, that of liberty, honour, and our country. The laws of  Solon declared infamous those, who took no part in civil troubles. I  followed their maxims. If the misfortunes of the 20th of March must  fall on the heads of the guilty, these guilty, I repeat, will not be  in the eye of posterity, the Frenchmen who abandoned the royal  standard, to return to the ancient colours of their country; but those  imprudent and senseless men, who, by their threats, their acts of  injustice, and their outrages, compelled us to choose between  insurrection and slavery, between honour and infamy.    During the Hundred Days, there was no person to whom I did an ill  turn; frequently I had an opportunity of doing good, and seized it  with joy.    Since the return of the regal government, I have lived tranquil and  solitary; and, whether from forgetfulness, or from a sense of justice,  I escaped in 1815 the persecutions, which the partisans and servants  of Napoleon experienced.    This explanation, or this apology, appeared to me necessary: it is  right the reader should know, who it is that addresses him.    I could have wished, to abstain from speaking of the royal government  in the first part of this work: but it was impossible. It was  necessary for me, prominently to exhibit the errors and faults of the  king's ministers one by one, to render evident this truth, _that they  were the sole authors of the 20th of March_. When elsewhere, as here,  I say the government, I mean not to designate the King, but his  ministers. In a constitutional monarchy, in which the ministers are  responsible, we cannot, and ought not to confound them with the King.  \"It is from the King,\" said the keeper of the seals, when he proposed  to the deputies of the nation the project of a law on the  responsibility of ministers, \"that every act of equity, protection,  and clemency, and every regular employment of power, emanates: it is  to the ministers alone, that abuses, injustice, and misconduct, are to  be imputed.\"          MEMOIRS,    &c. &c.          Until the close of the Spanish war, Napoleon, whether as the First  Consul of the Republic, or as the Chief of the Empire, had never  ceased to be the object of the love, the pride, and the confidence of  the people. But the multitude neither judge, nor can judge of the  actions of their rulers but from appearances which often mislead them  in their judgment; and the loyalty of the nation then became  enfeebled. The conduct of Napoleon was stigmatized as a series of  hateful aggressions; the war, as an unjustifiable act of violence.  Disaffection increased. Napoleon was assailed by the anger of his  subjects, and, for the first time, they upbraided him with having  spilt their blood, and wasted their riches, in gratifying his vain and  culpable ambition.    At this juncture the public mind became absorbed in the contemplation  of the invasion of Russia, and the general discontent was withdrawn  from the events which had taken place in the peninsula.    Our arms were crowned with good fortune and glory at the commencement  of the Russian war; but that conflict was ended by a catastrophe which  has no parallel in the annals of the world.    The Emperor, who escaped almost alone from the perils of the campaign,  returned to the capital. His countenance was that of a hero who defies  adversity. But his firmness was deemed to be the result of heartless  insensibility. Instead of inspiring the people with hope, it  embittered their feelings. Louder murmurs broke forth; their  indignation expressed itself with greater emphasis. Yet such was the  enthusiasm which was even then inspired by the proud recollections of  the triumphs of Napoleon, that France, blushing for her disgrace,  implored him to win new victories. Armies formed themselves as if by  enchantment, and Napoleon stood again in the midst of Germany, more  terrible than ever.    After we had conquered at Lutzen, at Bautzen, and at Dresden, the  battle of Leipsic was fought[1]. Never before that day had we been  doomed to witness our national armies flying before the enemy. The  scattered wrecks of our battalions, which had been created by the last  hope, by the last effort of our country, at length reached our  frontiers. But our soldiers were no longer the vigorous and resolute  warriors of France; they were bowed down by want, toil, and  humiliation. Soon afterwards they were followed by wandering trains of  military carriages, loaded with diseased and wounded wretches, who  festered beneath the corpses amongst which they were heaped, and who  at once absorbed and diffused the germs of pestilence and contagion.  Even the firmest minds now yielded to despair; and the grief  occasioned by the havoc now made amongst our defenders renewed the  sorrows of the mothers and the wives of those who erewhile had  perished in Russia and in Spain. Curses upon Napoleon, the author of  all these evils, resounded from side to side of the empire.                       [Footnote 1: The misfortunes of that eventful day,                     and of the remainder of the campaign, were caused                     by the treachery of the Saxons and the defection of                     the Princes of the Confederation of the Rhine.]    As long as good fortune waited upon Napoleon, his most ambitious  attempts commanded the applauses of the nation. We boasted of his  profound political wisdom, we extolled his genius, we worshipped his  courage. When his fortune changed, then his political wisdom was  called treachery, his genius, ambition, and his courage,  fool-hardiness and infatuation.    Napoleon was not to be depressed by ingratitude or misfortune. He  re-assembled the feeble fragments of his armies, and proclaimed aloud  that he would conquer or die at the head of his soldiery. This  resolution only produced a momentary impression. The French, who so  lately believed that the happiness and salvation of France depended  only upon the life of Napoleon, now coolly considered that his death,  the fate which he was prepared to encounter, afforded the only means  of putting an end to the calamities of war, for peace otherwise  appeared unattainable.    Napoleon departed. He achieved prodigies, but to no effect. National  spirit no longer existed, and the nation had gradually sunk into that  state of insensibility so fatal to sovereigns, when the public mind  has no perception of their dangers, and abandons them to their  destiny.    France was thus affected when Napoleon consented to divest himself of  his crown[2]. The apathy of the nation drove him to this extremity;  for it deprived him of the means either of carrying on the war, or of  making peace.                       [Footnote 2: Napoleon, according to the common                     report, was frequently heard to repeat, after his                     abdication, \"I have been ruined by liberal ideas.\"                     I do not think that he ever expressed himself in                     this manner. I do not intend to doubt the                     irresistible force which liberal ideas have now                     acquired; but I do not think, that they contributed                     to effect the first downfal of the imperial throne.                     Nobody thought about liberal ideas at that period.                     France had been trained to the government of                     Napoleon, and his despotism gave rise to no                     complaints. She was not free in the manner                     according to which the nation now wishes to enjoy                     liberty. But the liberty which France then                     possessed was enough for the French. Napoleon would                     often exercise unlimited authority, but the country                     had only one master, and _he_ was the master of                     all. If it is true that the French abandoned                     Napoleon in 1814, it was not because we were tired                     of Napoleon or discontented with his government,                     but because the nation was exhausted, discouraged,                     and demoralized by an uninterrupted succession of                     calamitous wars. The people would still have been                     delighted to obey him, but they had neither                     strength nor soul.                       The real causes of the downfal of Napoleon are to                     be found in his hatred towards England, and in the

He is a typical American in the best sense of the word, and his life is  worthy of careful study. From it American boys of to-day, and in  generations to come, may gain lessons that will do them much good.    Theodore Roosevelt, the twenty-sixth President of our country, was born  in New York City, October 27, 1858. The place of his birth was the old  family mansion at 28 East Twentieth Street, in a neighborhood which, at  that time, was the abode of wealth and culture.
