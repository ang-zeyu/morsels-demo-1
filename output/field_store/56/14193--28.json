I.    THE SOUTH OF FRANCE.      If it is only by an effort that we appreciate the valour of Columbus in  the XV century, his secret doubts, his temerity, how much fainter is our  conception of the heroism of the early Mediterranean navigators. Steam  has destroyed for us the awful majesty of distance, and we can never  realise the immensity of this \"great Sea\" to the ancients. To Virgil the  adventures of the \"pious AEneas\" were truly heroic. The western shores of  the Mediterranean were then the \"end of the earth,\" and even during the  first centuries of our own era, he who ventured outside the Straits of  Gibraltar tempted either Providence or the Devil and was very properly  punished by falling over the edge of the earth into everlasting  destruction. \"Why,\" asks a mediaeval text-book of science, \"is the sun so  red in the evening?\" And this convincing answer follows, \"Because he  looks down upon Hell.\"    For centuries before the Christian era the South of France, with Spain,  lay in the unknown west end of the Sea. Along its eastern shores lay  civilisations hoary with age; Carthage, to the South, was moribund;  Greece was living on the prestige of her glorious past; while Rome was  becoming all-powerful. Legend tells that adventurous Phoenicians and  Greeks discovered the French coasts, that Nimes was founded by a Tyrian  Hercules, and Marseilles, about 600 B.C., by a Phoenician trader who  married a chief's daughter and settled at the mouth of the Rhone. But  these early settlements were merely isolated towns, which were not  interdependent;--scarcely more than trading posts. It was Rome who took  southern Gaul unto herself, and after Roman fashion, built cities and  towns and co-ordinated them into well-regulated provinces; and it is  with Roman rule that the connected history of Gaul begins.    From the outset we meet one basic fact, so difficult to realise when  France is considered as one country, the essential difference between  the North and the South. Caesar found in the South a partial Roman  civilisation ready for his organisation; and old, flourishing cities,  like Narbonne, Aix, and Marseilles. In the North he found the people  advanced no further than the tribal stage, and Paris--not even Paris in  name--was a collection of mud huts, which, from its strategic position,  he elevated into a camp. The two following centuries, the height of  Roman dominion in France, accentuated these differences. The North was  governed by the Romans, never assimilated nor civilised by them. The  South eagerly absorbed all the culture of the Imperial City; her  religions and her pleasures, her beautiful Temples and great  Amphitheatres, finally her morals and effeminacy, till in the II century  of our era, anyone living a life of luxurious gaiety was popularly said  to have \"set sail for Marseilles.\" To this day the South boasts that it  was a very part of Rome, and Rome was not slow to recognise the claim.  Gallic poets celebrated the glory of Augustus, a Gaul was the master  of Quintilian, and Antoninus Pius, although born in the Imperial City,  was by parentage a native of Nimes.    [Illustration: \"CARCASSONNE, THE INVULNERABLE.\"]    Not to the rude North, but to this society, so pagan, so  pleasure-loving, came the first missionaries of the new Christian faith,  to meet in the arenas of Gaul the fate of their fellow-believers in  Rome, to hide in subterranean caves and crypts, to endure, to persist,  and finally to conquer. In the III and IV centuries many of the great  Bishoprics were founded, Avignon, Narbonne, Lyons, Arles, and  Saint-Paul-trois Chateaux among others; but these same years brought  political changes which seemed to threaten both Church and State.    Roman power was waning. Tribes from across the Rhine were gathering,  massing in northern Gaul, and its spirit was antagonistic to the  contentment of the rich Mediterranean provinces. The tribes were  brave, ruthless, and barbarous. Peace was galling to their  uncontrollable restlessness. The Gallo-Romans were artistic, literary,  idle, and luxurious. They fell, first to milder but heretical foes;  then to the fierce but orthodox Frank; and the story of succeeding  years was a chronicle of wars. Like a great swarm of locusts, the  Saracens--conquerors from India to Spain--came upon the South. They  took Narbonne, Nimes, and even Carcassonne, the Invulnerable. They  besieged Toulouse, and almost destroyed Bordeaux.

There were however other factors of change. In his Autobiography{5} he  wrote:--\"During the voyage of the _Beagle_ I had been deeply impressed  by discovering in the Pampean formation great fossil animals covered  with armour like that on the existing armadillos; secondly, by the  manner in which closely allied animals replace one another in proceeding  southward over the Continent; and thirdly, by the South American  character of most of the productions of the Galapagos archipelago, and  more especially by the manner in which they differ slightly on each  island of the group; none of the islands appearing to be very ancient in  a geological sense. It was evident that such facts as these, as well as  many others, could only be explained on the supposition that species  gradually become modified; and the subject haunted me.\"         {5} _Life and Letters_, i. p. 82.    Again we have to ask: how soon did any of these influences produce an  effect on Darwin's mind? Different answers have been attempted.  Huxley{6} held that these facts could not have produced their essential  effect until the voyage had come to an end, and the \"relations of the  existing with the extinct species and of the species of the different  geographical areas with one another were determined with some  exactness.\" He does not therefore allow that any appreciable advance  towards evolution was made during the actual voyage of the _Beagle_.         {6} _Obituary Notice_, _loc. cit._    Professor Judd{7} takes a very different view. He holds that November  1832 may be given with some confidence as the \"date at which Darwin  commenced that long series of observations and reasonings which  eventually culminated in the preparation of the _Origin of Species_.\"         {7} _Darwin and Modern Science._    Though I think these words suggest a more direct and continuous march  than really existed between fossil-collecting in 1832 and writing the  _Origin of Species_ in 1859, yet I hold that it was during the voyage  that Darwin's mind began to be turned in the direction of Evolution, and  I am therefore in essential agreement with Prof. Judd, although I lay  more stress than he does on the latter part of the voyage.    Let us for a moment confine our attention to the passage, above quoted,  from the Autobiography and to what is said in the Introduction to the  _Origin_, Ed. i., viz. \"When on board H.M.S. 'Beagle,' as naturalist, I  was much struck with certain facts in the distribution of the  inhabitants of South America, and in the geological relations of the  present to the past inhabitants of that continent.\" These words,  occurring where they do, can only mean one thing,--namely that the facts  suggested an evolutionary interpretation. And this being so it must be  true that his thoughts _began to flow in the direction of Descent_ at  this early date.    I am inclined to think that the \"new light which was rising in his  mind{8}\" had not yet attained any effective degree of steadiness or  brightness. I think so because in his Pocket Book under the date 1837 he  wrote, \"In July opened first note-book on 'transmutation of species.'  Had been greatly struck _from about month of previous March_{9} on  character of South American fossils, and species on Galapagos  Archipelago. These facts origin (_especially latter_), of all my views.\"  But he did not visit the Galapagos till 1835 and I therefore find it  hard to believe that his evolutionary views attained any strength or  permanence until at any rate quite late in the voyage. The Galapagos  facts are strongly against Huxley's view, for Darwin's attention was  \"thoroughly aroused{10}\" by comparing the birds shot by himself and by  others on board. The case must have struck him at once,--without waiting  for accurate determinations,--as a microcosm of evolution.         {8} Huxley, _Obituary_, p. xi.         {9} In this citation the italics are mine.         {10} _Journal of Researches_, Ed. 1860, p. 394.    It is also to be noted, in regard to the remains of extinct animals,  that, in the above quotation from his Pocket Book, he speaks of March  1837 as the time at which he began to be \"greatly struck on character of  South American fossils,\" which suggests at least that the impression  made in 1832 required reinforcement before a really powerful effect was  produced.    We may therefore conclude, I think, that the evolutionary current in my  father's thoughts had continued to increase in force from 1832 onwards,  being especially reinforced at the Galapagos in 1835 and again in 1837  when he was overhauling the results, mental and material, of his  travels. And that when the above record in the Pocket Book was made he  unconsciously minimised the earlier beginnings of his theorisings, and  laid more stress on the recent thoughts which were naturally more vivid  to him. In his letter{11} to Otto Zacharias (1877) he wrote, \"On my  return home in the autumn of 1836, I immediately began to prepare my  Journal for publication, and then saw how many facts indicated the  common descent of species.\" This again is evidence in favour of the view  that the later growths of his theory were the essentially important  parts of its development.         {11} F. Darwin's _Life of Charles Darwin_ (in one volume), 1892, p.       166.    In the same letter to Zacharias he says, \"When I was on board the  _Beagle_ I believed in the permanence of species, but as far as I can  remember vague doubts occasionally flitted across my mind.\" Unless Prof.  Judd and I are altogether wrong in believing that late or early in the  voyage (it matters little which) a definite approach was made to the  evolutionary standpoint, we must suppose that in 40 years such advance  had shrunk in his recollection to the dimensions of \"vague doubts.\" The  letter to Zacharias shows I think some forgetting of the past where the  author says, \"But I did not become convinced that species were mutable  until, I think, two or three years had elapsed.\" It is impossible to  reconcile this with the contents of the evolutionary Note Book of 1837.  I have no doubt that in his retrospect he felt that he had not been  \"convinced that species were mutable\" until he had gained a clear  conception of the mechanism of natural selection, _i.e._ in 1838-9.    But even on this last date there is some room, not for doubt, but for  surprise. The passage in the Autobiography{12} is quite clear, namely  that in October 1838 he read Malthus's _Essay on the principle of  Population_ and \"being well prepared to appreciate the struggle for  existence ..., it at once struck me that under these circumstances  favourable variations would tend to be preserved, and unfavourable ones  to be destroyed. The result of this would be the formation of new  species. Here then I had at last got a theory by which to work.\"         {12} _Life and Letters_, i. p. 83.    It is surprising that Malthus should have been needed to give him the  clue, when in the Note Book of 1837 there should occur--however  obscurely expressed--the following forecast{13} of the importance of the  survival of the fittest. \"With respect to extinction, we can easily see  that a variety of the ostrich (Petise{14}), may not be well adapted, and  thus perish out; or on the other hand, like Orpheus{15}, being  favourable, many might be produced. This requires the principle that the  permanent variations produced by confined breeding and changing  circumstances are continued and produce<d> according to the adaptation of  such circumstances, and therefore that death of species is a consequence  (contrary to what would appear in America) of non-adaptation of  circumstances.\"         {13} _Life and Letters_, ii. p. 8.         {14} Avestruz Petise, _i.e. Rhea Darwini_.         {15} A bird.    I can hardly doubt, that with his knowledge of the interdependence of  organisms and the tyranny of conditions, his experience would have  crystallized out into \"a theory by which to work\" even without the aid  of Malthus.    In my father's Autobiography{16} he writes, \"In June 1842 I first  allowed myself the satisfaction of writing a very brief abstract of my  theory in pencil in 35 pages; and this was enlarged during the summer of  1844 into one of 230 pages{17}, which I had fairly copied out and still  possess.\" These two Essays, of 1842 and 1844, are now printed under the  title _The Foundations of the Origin of Species_.         {16} _Life and Letters_, i. p. 84.         {17} It contains as a fact 231 pp. It is a strongly bound folio,       interleaved with blank pages, as though for notes and additions.       His own MS. from which it was copied contains 189 pp.    It will be noted that in the above passage he does not mention the MS.  of 1842 as being in existence, and when I was at work on _Life and  Letters_ I had not seen it. It only came to light after my mother's  death in 1896 when the house at Down was vacated. The MS. was hidden in  a cupboard under the stairs which was not used for papers of any value,  but rather as an overflow for matter which he did not wish to destroy.    The statement in the Autobiography that the MS. was written in 1842  agrees with an entry in my fathers Diary:--    \"1842. May 18th went to Maer. June 15th to Shrewsbury, and on 18th to  Capel Curig.... During my stay at Maer and Shrewsbury (five years after  commencement) wrote pencil sketch of my species theory.\" Again in a  letter to Lyell (June 18, 1858) he speaks of his \"MS. sketch written out  in 1842{18}.\" In the _Origin of Species_, Ed. i. p. 1, he speaks of  beginning his speculations in 1837 and of allowing himself to draw up  some \"short notes\" after \"five years' work,\" _i.e._ in 1842. So far  there seems no doubt as to 1842 being the date of the first sketch; but  there is evidence in favour of an earlier date{19}. Thus across the  Table of Contents of the bound copy of"]]]
