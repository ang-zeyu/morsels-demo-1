These facts being made known to Columbus, served to strengthen his  opinion.  The success indeed of his undertaking depended greatly on two  happy errors: the imaginary extent of Asia to the east, and the supposed  smallness of the earth.  A deep religious sentiment mingled with his  meditations.  He looked upon himself as chosen by Heaven for the  accomplishment of its purposes, that the ends of the earth might be  brought together, and all nations and tongues united under the banner of  the Redeemer.    The enthusiastic nature of his conceptions gave an elevation to his  spirit, and dignity and eloquence to his whole demeanour.  He never  spoke in doubt or hesitation, but with as much certainty as if his eyes  had beheld the promised land.    No trial or disappointment could divert him from the steady pursuit of  his object.  That object, it is supposed, he meditated as early as the  year 1474, though as yet it lay crude and immatured in his mind.  Shortly afterwards, in the year 1477, he made a voyage to the north of  Europe, navigating one hundred leagues beyond Thule, when he reached an  island as large as England, generally supposed to have been Iceland.    In vain he had applied to Don John the Second, who ascended the throne  of Portugal in 1481.  That king was so deeply engaged in sending out  expeditions to explore the African coast that his counsellors advised  him to confine his efforts in that direction.  He would, however, have  given his consent had not Columbus demanded such high and honourable  rewards as were considered inadmissible.    To his eternal disgrace the Bishop of Ceuta advised that Columbus should  be kept in suspense while a vessel was secretly dispatched in the  direction he pointed out, to ascertain if there was any truth in his  story.  This was actually done, until the caravel meeting with stormy  weather, and an interminable waste of wild tumbling waves, the pilots  lost courage and returned.    Columbus, indignant at this attempt to defraud him, his wife having died  some time previously, resolved to abandon the country which had acted so  treacherously.  He first sent his brother Bartholomew to make proposals  to Henry the Seventh, King of England; but that sovereign rejected his  offers, and having again made a proposal to Genoa, which, from the  reverses she had lately received, she was unable to accept, he turned  his eyes to Spain.    The great Spanish Dukes of Medina Sidonia and Medina Coeli, were at  first inclined to support him, and the latter spoke of him to Queen  Isabella, who giving a favourable reply, Columbus set off for the  Spanish Court, then at Cordova.    The sovereigns of Castile and Arragon were, however, so actively engaged  in carrying on the fierce war with the Moors of Grenada, that they were  unable to give due attention to the scheme of the navigator, while their  counsellors generally derided his proposals.    The beautiful and enlightened Isabella treated him from the first with  respect, and other friends rose up who were ready to give him support.    Wearied and discouraged by long delays, however, he had again opened up  negotiations with the King of Portugal, and had been requested by that  monarch to return there.  He had also received a letter from Henry the  Seventh of England, inviting him to his Court, and holding out promises  of encouragement, when he was again summoned to attend the Castilian  Court, and a sum of money was sent him to defray his expenses, King  Ferdinand probably fearing that he would carry his proposals to a rival  monarch, and wishing to keep the matter in suspense until he had leisure  to examine it.    He accordingly repaired to the Court of Seville.  While he was there two  monks arrived with a message from the Grand Soldan of Egypt, threatening  to put to death all the Christians and to destroy the Holy Sepulchre if  the Spanish sovereigns did not desist from war against Grenada.    The menace had no effect in altering their purpose, but it aroused the  indignation of the Spanish cavaliers, and still more so that of  Columbus, and made them burn with ardent zeal once more to revive the  contest of faith on the sacred plains of Palestine.  Columbus had indeed  resolved, should his projected enterprise prove successful, to devote  the profits from his anticipated discoveries to a crusade for the rescue  of the Holy Sepulchre from the power of the infidels.    During the latter part of the year 1490 Ferdinand and Isabella were  engaged in celebrating the marriage of their eldest daughter, the  Princess Isabella, with Prince Don Alonzo, heir apparent of Portugal.  Bearing these long and vexatious delays as he had before done, Columbus  supported himself chiefly by making maps and charts, occasionally  assisted from the purse of his friend Diego de Deza.    The year was passing on.  Columbus was kept in a state of irritating  anxiety at Cordova, when he heard that the sovereigns were about to  commence that campaign which ended in the expulsion of the Moors from  Spain.  Aware that many months must pass before they would give their  minds to the subject if he allowed the present moment to slip by, he  pressed for a decisive reply to his proposals with an earnestness that  would admit of no evasion.    The learned men of the council were directed to express their opinion of  the enterprise.  The report of each was unfavourable, although the  worthy friar Diego de Deza, tutor to Prince John, and several others,  urged the sovereigns not to lose the opportunity of extending their  dominions and adding so greatly to their glory.    Again, however, Columbus was put off.  Having no longer confidence in  the vague promises which had hitherto been made, he turned his back on  Seville, resolved to offer to the King of France the honour of carrying  out his magnificent undertaking.    Leaving Seville, his means exhausted, he travelled on foot, leading his  young son Diego by the hand, to the sea-port of Palos de Moguer in  Andalusia.  Weary and exhausted, he stopped to ask for bread and water  at the gate of the ancient Franciscan convent of Santa Maria de Rabida.    The Prior, Juan Perez de Marchena, happening to come up, and remarking  the appearance of the stranger, entered into conversation with him.  The  Prior, a man of superior information, was struck with the grandeur of  his views, and when he found that the navigator was on the point of  abandoning Spain to seek patronage in the Court of France, and that so  important an enterprise was about to be lost for ever to the country,  his patriotism took the alarm.  He entertained Columbus as his guest,  and invited a scientific friend--a physician--Garcia Fernandez, to  converse with him.    Fernandez was soon captivated by his conversation.  Frequent conferences  took place, at which several of the veteran mariners of Palos were  present.  Among these was Martin Alonzo Pinzon, the head of a family of  wealthy and experienced navigators.  Facts were related by some of the  mariners in support of the theory of Columbus, and so convinced was  Pinzon of the feasibility of his project, that he offered to engage in  it with purse and person.  The Prior, who had once been confessor to the  Queen, was confirmed in his faith by the opinions expressed, and he  proposed writing to her immediately, and entreated Columbus to delay his  journey until an answer could be received.    It was decided to send Sebastian Rodriguez, a shrewd and clever pilot,  to Santa Fe, where the Queen then was.  Isabella had always been  favourable to Columbus, and the Prior received a reply desiring that he  himself should repair to Court.  He went, and, seconded by the  Marchioness of Moya and other old friends, so impressed the Queen with  the importance of the undertaking, that she desired Columbus might be  sent for, and ordered that seventy-two dollars, equal to two hundred and  sixteen of the present day, might be forwarded to him, to bear his  travelling expenses.    With his hopes raised to the highest pitch, Columbus again repaired to  Court; but so fully occupied was he with the grandeur of his enterprise,  that he stipulated that he should be invested with the title and  privilege of admiral, and viceroy over the countries he should discover,  with one-tenth of all gains, either by trade or conquest.  It must be  remembered the pious and patriotic way--according to his notions--in  which he intended to expend the wealth he hoped to acquire.    The courtiers were indignant, and sneeringly observed that his  arrangement was a secure one, that he was sure of a command, and had  nothing to lose.    On this he offered to furnish one-eighth of the cost, on condition of  enjoying one-eighth of the profit.  The King looked coldly on the  affair, and once more the sovereigns of Spain declined the offer.  Columbus was at length again about to set off on his journey to Palos,  when the generous spirit of Isabella was kindled by the remarks of the  Marchioness of Moya, supported by Louis de Saint Angel, Receiver of the  Ecclesiastical Revenues in Arragon.  She exclaimed, \"I undertake the  enterprise for my own crown of Castile, and will pledge my jewels to  raise the necessary funds!\"    This was the proudest moment in the life of Isabella, as it stamped her  as the patroness of the great discovery.    Saint Angel assured her there was no necessity for pledging her jewels,  and expressed his readiness to advance seventeen thousand florins.  A  messenger was dispatched to bring back the navigator, with the assurance  that all he desired would be granted; and so, turning the reins of his  mule, he hastened back with joyful alacrity to Santa Fe, confiding in  the noble probity"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23495"],[0,"The Story of the Greeks (#2)"],[1,"  270     CXII.

EARLY INHABITANTS OF GREECE.      Although Greece (or Hel'las) is only half as large as the State of New  York, it holds a very important place in the history of the world. It is  situated in the southern part of Europe, cut off from the rest of the  continent by a chain of high mountains which form a great wall on the  north. It is surrounded on nearly all sides by the blue waters of the  Med-it-er-ra'ne-an Sea, which stretch so far inland that it is said no  part of the country is forty miles from the sea, or ten miles from the  hills. Thus shut in by sea and mountains, it forms a little territory by  itself, and it was the home of a noted people.    The history of Greece goes back to the time when people did not know how  to write, and kept no record of what was happening around them. For a  long while the stories told by parents to their children were the only  information which could be had about the country and its former  inhabitants; and these stories, slightly changed by every new teller,  grew more and more extraordinary as time passed. At last they were so  changed that no one could tell where the truth ended and fancy began.    The beginning of Greek history is therefore like a fairy tale; and while  much of it cannot, of course, be true, it is the only information we  have about the early Greeks. It is these strange fireside stories, which  used to amuse Greek children so many years ago, that you are first going  to hear.    About two thousand years before the birth of Christ, in the days when  Isaac wanted to go down into Egypt, Greece was inhabited by a savage  race of men called the Pe-las'gi-ans. They lived in the forests, or in  caves hollowed out of the mountain side, and hunted wild beasts with  great clubs and stone-tipped arrows and spears. They were so rude and  wild that they ate nothing but raw meat, berries, and the roots which  they dug up with sharp stones or even with their hands.    For clothing, the Pelasgians used the skins of the beasts they had  killed; and to protect themselves against other savages, they gathered  together in families or tribes, each having a chief who led in war and  in the chase.    There were other far more civilized nations in those days. Among these  were the E-gyp'tians, who lived in Africa. They had long known the use  of fire, had good tools, and were much further advanced than the  Pelasgians. They had learned not only to build houses, but to erect the  most wonderful monuments in the world,--the Pyr'a-mids, of which you  have no doubt heard.    In Egypt there were at that time a number of learned men. They were  acquainted with many of the arts and sciences, and recorded all they  knew in a peculiar writing of their own invention. Their neighbors, the  Phoe-ni'-cians, whose land also bordered on the Mediterranean Sea,  were quite civilized too; and as both of these nations had ships, they  soon began to sail all around that great inland sea.    As they had no compass, the Egyptian and Phoenician sailors did not  venture out of sight of land. They first sailed along the shore, and  then to the islands which they could see far out on the blue waters.    When they had come to one island, they could see another still farther  on; for, as you will see on any map, the Mediterranean Sea, between  Greece and Asia, is dotted with islands, which look like stepping-stones  going from one coast to the other.    Advancing thus carefully, the Egyptians and Phoenicians finally came  to Greece, where they made settlements, and began to teach the  Pelasgians many useful and important things.          II. THE DELUGE OF OGYGES.      The first Egyptian who thus settled in Greece was a prince called  In'a-chus. Landing in that country, which has a most delightful climate,  he taught the Pelasgians how to make fire and how to cook their meat. He  also showed them how to build comfortable homes by piling up stones one  on top of another, much in the same way as the farmer makes the stone  walls around his fields.    The Pelasgians were intelligent, although so uncivilized; and they soon  learned to build these walls higher, in order to keep the wild beasts  away from their homes. Then, when they had learned the use of bronze and  iron tools, they cut the stones into huge blocks of regular shape.    These stone blocks were piled one upon another so cleverly that some of  the walls are still standing, although no mortar was used to hold the  stones together. Such was the strength of the Pelasgians, that they  raised huge blocks to great heights, and made walls which their  descendants declared must have been built by giants.    As the Greeks called their giants Cy'clops, which means \"round-eyed,\"  they soon called these walls Cy-clo-pe'an; and, in pointing them out to  their children, they told strange tales of the great giants who had  built them, and always added that these huge builders had but one eye,  which was in the middle of the forehead.    Some time after Inachus the Egyptian had thus taught the Pelasgians the  art of building, and had founded a city called Ar'gos, there came a  terrible earthquake. The ground under the people's feet heaved and  cracked, the mountains shook, the waters flooded the dry land, and the  people fled in terror to the hills.    In spite of the speed with which they ran, the waters soon overtook  them. Many of the Pelasgians were thus drowned, while their terrified  companions ran faster and faster up the mountain, nor stopped to rest  until they were quite safe.    Looking down upon the plains where they had once lived, they saw them  all covered with water. They were now forced to build new homes; but  when the waters little by little sank into the ground, or flowed back  into the sea, they were very glad to find that some of their thickest  walls had resisted the earthquake and flood, and were still standing  firm.    The memory of the earthquake and flood was very clear, however. The poor  Pelasgians could not forget their terror and the sudden death of so many  friends, and they often talked about that horrible time. As this flood  occurred in the days when Og'y-ges was king, it has generally been  linked to his name, and called the Deluge (or flood) of Ogyges.          III. THE FOUNDING OF MANY IMPORTANT CITIES.      Some time after Inachus had built Argos, another Egyptian prince came to  settle in Greece. His name was Ce'crops, and, as he came to Greece after  the Deluge of Ogyges, he found very few inhabitants left. He landed, and  decided to build a city on a promontory northeast of Argos. Then he  invited all the Pelasgians who had not been drowned in the flood to join  him.    The Pelasgians, glad to find such a wise leader, gathered around him,  and they soon learned to plow the fields and to sow wheat. Under  Cecrops' orders they also planted olive trees and vines, and learned how  to press the oil from the olives and the wine from the grapes. Cecrops  taught them how to harness their oxen; and before long the women began  to spin the wool of their sheep, and to weave it into rough woolen  garments, which were used for clothing, instead of the skins of wild  beasts.    After building several small towns in At'ti-ca, Cecrops founded a larger  one, which was at first called Ce-cro'pi-a in honor of himself. This  name, however, was soon changed to Ath'ens to please A-the'ne (or  Mi-ner'va), a goddess whom the people worshiped, and who was said to  watch over the welfare of this her favorite city.    [Illustration: Athene.]    When Cecrops died, he was followed by other princes, who continued  teaching the people many useful things, such as the training and  harnessing of horses, the building of carts, and the proper way of  harvesting grain. One prince even showed them how to make beehives, and  how to use the honey as an article of food.    As the mountain sides in Greece are covered with a carpet of wild,  sweet-smelling herbs and flowers, the Greek honey is very good; and  people say that the best honey in the world is made by the bees on Mount  Hy-met'tus, near Athens, where they gather their golden store all summer  long.    Shortly after the building of Athens, a Phoenician colony, led by  Cad'mus, settled a neighboring part of the country, called Boe-o'tia,  where they founded the city which was later known as Thebes. Cadmus also  taught the people many useful things, among others the art of trade (or  commerce) and that of navigation (the building and using of ships); but,  best of all, he brought the alphabet to Greece, and showed the people  how to express their thoughts in writing.    Almost at the same time that Cadmus founded Thebes, an Egyptian called  Dan'a-us came to Greece, and settled a colony on the same spot where  that of Inachus had once been. The new Argos rose on the same place as  the old; and the country around it, called Ar'go-lis, was separated from  Boeotia and Attica only by a long narrow strip of land, which was  known as the Isthmus of Cor'-inth.    Danaus not only showed the Pelasgians all the useful arts which Cadmus  and Cecrops had taught, but also helped them to build ships like that in  which he had come to Greece. He also founded religious festivals or  games in honor of the harvest goddess, De-me'ter. The women were invited  to these games, and they only were allowed to bear torches in the public  processions, where they sang hymns in honor of the goddess.    The descendants of Danaus long ruled over the land; and one member of  his family, Per'seus, built the town of My-ce'nae on a spot where many  of the Pelasgian"]]]
