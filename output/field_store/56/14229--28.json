The boys threw with a will and were vigorously answered by the defenders  of the fort, and for a time it was hard to see which side would win.  Finally, after the ammunition of the attacking force was used up,  Captain Reddy ordered a retreat back to their own fort.    \"I have a better plan this time,\" he announced after they were safely  inside. \"When we charge again, two of you fellows must keep running back  to our own fort so as to bring us supplies of snowballs. Then we can  keep up a much longer fight and when anyone gets tired throwing,\" he  added, \"he can change places with one of the fellows that have been  carrying the balls.\"    At this moment, Herbie, who had been on the lookout, suddenly cried:    \"They're coming to charge us.\"    \"Get ready to give it to them,\" ordered the Captain and each boy,  snatching up an armful of snowballs, prepared to repel the attack.    \"Fire!\" Reddy shouted, as the enemy drew near, and when they met that  rain of balls it didn't take them long to get back to the cover of their  own fort.    \"That was great!\" cried Herbie. \"Come on, let us charge this time before  they have a chance to get ready for us.\"    \"Hey, I'm the Captain,\" insisted Reddy. \"Nobody gives any orders but  me,\" and he pulled his woolen cap well down over his ears in preparation  for the coming attack.    \"Well, hurry up and give them, then!\" shouted Toad. \"I'm all loaded up.\"    \"Charge, charge on!\" shouted Reddy, starting out on the run with the  others close upon his heels, and after a few minutes of hard fighting  they had forced their way to the walls of the fort.    The balls were flying so thick and so fast, from both sides, that it  looked like a snow storm of enormous flakes shooting in all directions.    The boys carrying balls to supply the invaders were kept busy, but  before long it was noticed that there were fewer coming from inside the  fort.    \"They've used up all they have,\" shouted Toad. \"Let's get closer.\"    \"Close in,\" cried Captain Reddy, \"and aim well!\"    In another minute you could plainly tell that each of the enemy, after  throwing one snowball, had to stop long enough to make another one and  this was the time for which Captain Reddy had been waiting.    \"Charge the walls!\" he ordered, and with wild cries the boys dashed  forward.    Up over the walls they went and once inside the victory was easily won  for the boys inside the fort were empty handed and couldn't defend  themselves.    \"We win, we win!\" exclaimed Toad, throwing his hat into the air. \"Three  cheers for Captain Reddy!\"    \"Hurrah!\" shouted all the boys.          CHAPTER IV    CHUCK'S RUDE AWAKENING      The day before Christmas dawned bright and cold. Mother Brown, who had  been up early, made some wonderful Christmas pies and a pudding before  Toad and Chuck were awake.    It was eight o'clock before Toad opened one eye.    \"What's the use of getting up,\" he thought, \"I'm so warm and comfortable  here in bed. My, but something smells awfully good. Wonder if it's  breakfast.\"    Suddenly he sat up straight in bed.    \"Look at that lazy thing,\" he declared. \"Bet he'd sleep until noon if  I'd let him, and with all we have to do to-day.\"    Chuck continued to snore peacefully.    \"But I won't--I'll have some fun,\" thought Toad, as quietly, with as  little noise as possible, he crept from his bed to the basin in one  corner of the room. It took him only a few seconds to wet a large sponge  with cold water, then, creeping very carefully back to the foot of  Chuck's bed, he took careful aim.    The sponge flew through the air true to its mark and landed \"kersplash\"  on Chuck's tousled brown head.    \"W-w-w-what's the matter?\" spluttered Chuck, sitting up and blinking  his eyes. Then, as he felt the water trickling down his cheeks and  caught sight of Toad, doubled up with laughter, he jumped out of bed  and, running across the room, he pushed Toad flat on his back on the bed  and sat upon his chest.    \"Let me up,\" pleaded Toad. \"I couldn't help it, you looked so sweet.\"    \"What'll you give me if I do?\" laughed Chuck. \"You've got to pay for  that smart trick before I let you up.\"    \"Nothing!\" gasped Toad, trying very hard to free himself.    \"Oho!\" laughed Chuck. \"You won't, eh? Well,\" he added, \"I don't mind  sitting here all day. I'm real comfortable.\"    At this moment there came a knock at the door and before either of the  boys could answer Father Brown entered.    \"What's up?\" he inquired.    \"Toad hit me in the face with a wet sponge while I was asleep,\"  explained Chuck, \"and he's going to give me something for it.\"    \"Then why are you sitting on him?\" asked Father.    \"Because he says he won't,\" replied Chuck with a grin.    \"I suppose you'll have to pay up Thomas,\" laughed Father. \"Anyway, I  hope you'll both be down to breakfast soon,\" he added--\"before all the  cakes are gone. I've a terrible appetite this morning,\" and with these  words he left the room.    \"Do you give up now?\" asked Chuck.    \"No, sir,\" persisted Toad.    \"Remember what he said about the cakes. They'll be hot ones with lots of  maple syrup,\" teased Chuck.    \"Well, you're missing them, too,\" retorted Toad.    \"I guess I'll let you off this time,\" relented Chuck, \"but if you ever  do it again,\" he threatened, \"I'll hold you down for a week, cakes or no  cakes.\"    \"You'd starve to death in that time,\" argued Toad, with a laugh as he  commenced to hurry into his clothing.    The boys were seated at the table, a half hour later, and had just eaten  the last of the griddle cakes, when Reddy's whistle was heard. Toad,  jumping up from the table, ran over to the window and beckoned to Reddy  to come into the house.    \"What are you going to do this morning?\" was Reddy's first remark as he  entered the room.    \"We're going for Christmas greens and Dad's going to cut our tree from  away up on the hillside,\" Toad told him, \"and,\" he added, \"we're going  to take one of the horses with us to drag it home.\"    \"Oh, that's great!\" replied Reddy. \"Do you start soon?\"    \"Don't you want to go, too?\" asked Chuck. \"And maybe we can get Fat and  Herbie, too,\" he added.    \"If such a crowd goes, and everybody gathers greens,\" laughed Toad,  \"what will we ever do with all of them?\"    Mother Brown answered him from the doorway.    \"Why not take some of them to the church? I'm sure the ladies who are  trimming it will be glad to use all that you can give them.\"    \"That's a splendid idea,\" declared Father Brown, rising from his seat by  the fireplace. \"Come, boys, bundle up well, because it's going to be a  cold drive.\"    \"I'll run ahead to get the others,\" called Chuck as he hurried from the  room.          CHAPTER V    THE ADVENTURE IN THE SNOW      \"I'm glad we brought the sleigh,\" Father Brown remarked, as they were  driving along at a fair pace, a little later, \"as we never could have  gotten through with a wagon in this deep snow.\"    They were now starting up the hill and the horse's feet sank deeply into  the snow drifts, although his load was not heavy, as the boys took turns  walking, so that only two of them were riding at a time.    \"When we reach the first clearing,\" Father proposed, \"we'll cut the  greens and then leave them in a pile by the roadside, for it is likely  we shall have to go up still higher before we can find the tree we  want.\"    After going on a few yards more he shouted:    \"Here's the place; all hands to work!\" and the boys started in with a  will, bringing to the roadside great heaps of boughs and woodvines, some  of them covered with red berries and others with grey.    Within a short time they had gathered a large pile of the greens, so  they decided it was time to start out to find the tree.    \"The tree must be full and the top perfect,\" declared Father Brown, \"so  keep your eyes open for it.\"    \"What's the matter with that one?\" demanded Toad, pointing to a big fir  some distance away.    \"Nothing at all the matter with it,\" laughed Chuck, \"only the house is  too small to hold it.\"    \"There's a nice one,\" called out Herbie, pointing to the one he meant.    \"Yes, that's a beauty,\" agreed Father Brown, \"and easy to get at, too.\"    After clearing away the smaller branches near the ground, by chopping  them off with the axe, Father Brown then started to work on the trunk of  the tree.    \"Wouldn't it be nice,\" suggested Fat, \"if we didn't have to cut it down  at all,--just trim it outside? It would save so much time and trouble.\"    \"Oh, yes, that would be great,\" agreed Reddy. \"We'd just sit around on  the snow eating ice cream and look at the tree,\" and he gave a hearty  laugh in which all the others joined.    \"Well, I'll bet they do it in Greenland and Iceland,\" persisted Fat, \"so  why couldn't we?\"    \"Because we don't wear white Polar bear clothes,\" laughed Chuck.    \"There she comes,--she's falling!\" cried the boys.    \"Stay where you are until it's down,\" called Father Brown to the boys.    [Illustration: \"There she comes! She's falling!\" cried the boys.]    There was a sharp creak and a swish of branches as the tree came down,  and the boys now rushed over to help tie up the branches.    When that part of the work was finished, Reddy sang out:    \"All together! Lift her on the sled. One, two, three!\" and up it went.    \"Nobody gets a ride home,\" called out Chuck, \"because the greens have to  go on top of the tree.\"    \"Oh!\" wailed Fat, \"if I can't ride I'll roll down. I hate to walk.\"    By the time they had reached the fields the worst part of the trip was  over.    \"We'll cut over to the road that runs past the church,\" said Father  Brown, \"and leave some of the greens there,\" at which the horse was  headed in that direction.    As they came to the road they saw a short distance from them an object  in the snow and as they drew nearer"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23580"],[0,"The Children's Bible (#2)"],[1," PRAYER
