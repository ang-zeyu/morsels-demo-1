It  was a month after this that Sergeant Humphreys, returning to his  quarters, found his wife sitting by the side of the bed on which the two  infants were asleep.    \"They are as alike as two peas,\" he said as he looked at them. \"I am  sure I wonder, Jane, that you know which is which!\"    Mrs. Humphreys' answer did not seem to the point. \"Captain Clinton is a  rich man, is he not, John?\"    \"Yes; they say he came into a grand estate two years ago when his father  died, and that like enough he will leave the regiment when it goes home  next year.\"    \"Then one of those babies will be a rich man, and the other--\" and she  stopped.    \"The other will, I hope, be a non-commissioned officer in the 30th Foot  one of these days,\" the sergeant said. Jane looked up at her husband.  There was no touch of envy or discontent in his voice. She was about to  speak but checked herself.    \"Which is yours, John?\" she asked a moment later, returning to his first  remark.    \"I am sure I could not tell,\" he said with a laugh. \"Babies are mostly  pretty much alike, and as these two are just the same age, and just the  same size, and have both got gray eyes and light coloured hair--if you  can call it hair,--and no noses to speak of, I don't see a pin's point  of difference.\"    A month later a small party were assembled in Captain Clinton's  bungalow. Mrs. Humphreys was standing with a baby in each arm. Mrs.  Clinton was lying upon a sofa crying bitterly. Captain Clinton was  walking up and down the room, hot and angry. The surgeon of the regiment  was standing grave and sympathetic by Mrs. Clinton. Sergeant Humphreys  was in the attitude of attention by the door, with an anxious troubled  expression on his face.    \"What in the world is to be done, doctor?\" Captain Clinton asked. \"I  never heard of such a thing, it is a most serious business.\"    \"I can quite see that,\" the doctor replied. \"When Mrs. Humphreys came to  me and asked me to break the news to you, I told her at once that it was  a terrible business. I own that I do not see that she is altogether to  blame, but it is a most unfortunate occurrence. As I have just told you,  she had, when she put the children to bed, put your child in one of her  baby's night-gowns, as it happened there were none of your child's  clean. In the morning she took them out and laid them on a rug on the  ground before beginning to wash and dress them. She went out to the  canteen to get something for her husband's breakfast, and when she  returned she could not remember the order in which she had taken them  out of bed and laid them down, and could not distinguish her own child  from yours.\"    \"You must remember, Mrs. Humphreys,\" Captain Clinton broke in; \"think it  over, woman. You must remember how you laid them down.\"    \"Indeed, I do not, sir; I have been thinking all the morning. I had  nursed them two or three times during the night, and of course had  changed their position then. I never thought about their having the same  night-gowns on. If I had, of course I should have been more careful, for  I have said to my husband over and over again that it was only by their  clothes that I should know them apart, for if they had been twins they  could not be more alike.    \"This is downright maddening!\" Captain Clinton exclaimed, pacing up and  down the room. \"And is there no mark nor anything by which they can be  recognized? Why, bless me, woman, surely you as a mother ought to know  your own child!\"    Mrs. Humphreys shook her head. \"I have nursed them both, sir, and which  is mine and which is yours I could not say to save my life.\"    \"Well, put the children down on that sofa,\" Captain Clinton said, \"and  take yourself off for the present; you have done mischief enough for a  lifetime. I will let you know what we decide upon later on.\"    \"Well, doctor, what on earth is to be done?\" he asked after the door had  closed upon the sergeant and his wife. \"What do you think had best be  done, Lucy?\"    But Mrs. Clinton, who was but just recovering from her illness, was too  prostrated by this terrible blow to be able to offer any suggestion.    \"It is a terrible business indeed, Clinton,\" the doctor said, \"and I  feel for you most deeply. Of course the possibility of such a thing  never entered my mind when I recommended you to let Mrs. Humphreys act  as its foster-mother. It seemed at the time quite a providential  circumstance that she too should be just confined, and in a position to  take to your baby. The only possible suggestion I can offer is that you  should for a time bring up both boys as your own. At present they are  certainly wonderfully alike, but it is probable that as they grow up you  will see in one or other of them a likeness to yourself or your wife,  and that the other will take after its own parents. Of course these  likenesses do not always exist, but in nine cases out of ten some  resemblance can be traced between a boy and one or other of his  parents.\"    \"That certainly seems feasible,\" Captain Clinton said in a tone of  relief. \"What do you say, dear? It is only bringing up the two children  for a time till we are able to be certain which is our own. The other  will have had the advantage of a good education and so on, and of course  it will be our business to give him a good start in life.\"    \"It will be awful having the two children, and not knowing which is our  own.\"    \"It will be very unpleasant,\" Captain Clinton said soothingly; \"but, you  see, in time you will come to care for them both just as if they had  been twins.\"    \"That will be almost as bad,\" Mrs. Clinton cried feebly. \"And suppose  one gets to love the wrong one best?\"    \"We won't suppose that, dear; but if we love them both equally, we will,  when we find out which is ours, treat the other as an adopted child and  complete his education, and start him in life as if he were so.  Fortunately the expense will be nothing to us.\"    \"But this woman has a right to one of them.\"    \"She does not deserve to have one,\" Captain Clinton said angrily; \"but  of course we must make some arrangement with her. She is bound to do her  best to repair the terrible mischief her carelessness has caused. Well,  doctor, we will think it over for an hour or two, but certainly your  suggestion seems by far the best for us to adopt.\"    \"The hussy!\" the doctor said as he walked away to his quarters. \"I am  more than half inclined to believe that she has done it on purpose. I  never liked the jade before she married, though I own that she has  turned out better than I expected. But I always thought her a designing  and artful young woman, and gave her credit for plenty of brains, and  what could suit her purpose better than this change of children? She  would see that in the first place she would get her own boy well brought  up, and perhaps provided for, with all sorts of chances of making money  out of the affair. It may have been an accident, of course, but if so,  it was a wonderfully fortunate one for her.\"    Such was the opinion among the women of the regiment when the news  became known, and Jane Humphreys was speedily made aware of the fact by  the change in their manner towards her. They had, however, but small  opportunity for demonstrating their opinion, for Mrs. Humphreys remained  shut up as much as possible in her room, and the one or two women who  were inclined to take a favourable view of the matter and so called upon  her, reported that she was completely prostrated by the occurrence.  Among the officers and their families the greatest commiseration was  felt for Captain Clinton and his wife, and the matter was discussed at  tiffin that day with great animation.    \"Don't you think, doctor, that a woman must know her own child?\" a young  ensign asked.    \"Not at all, Arbuthnot; that is to say, not if you mean that she would  know it by any sort of maternal instinct. There is no such thing. She  has no more means of telling her own infant out of a dozen others of  similar complexion, age, and appearance, than she would have of picking  out her own pocket-handkerchief out of a dozen others of similar pattern  if they were all unmarked.\"    \"But a sheep can pick out his own lamb among a hundred, doctor, and I am  sure they are alike as so many peas. Surely that must be maternal  instinct?\"    \"Not in the smallest degree, Arbuthnot. The sheep and other animals  possess in a very high degree a sense which is comparatively rudimentary  in human beings. I mean, of course, the sense of smell. A sheep knows  her lamb, and a cow knows her calf, neither by the sense of hearing or  by that of sight. She recognizes it solely and wholly by her sense of  smell, just as a dog can track its master's footsteps out of a thousand  by the same sense. The two babies are as alike as twins; and I am not  surprised that, if they really got mixed, this woman should not be able  to detect one from the other.\"    \"It is an awful thing for Clinton,\" the major said. \"Here he has got a  splendid estate, and he will never be certain whether his own son or a  stranger is going to inherit it after him. It is enough to make a man go  out of his mind.\"    \"I don't see that that would be likely to mend matters,\" the doctor said  dryly; \"in fact it would lessen the one chance that exists of ever  setting the matter straight. As I have told him, though these children  are very much alike at present--and indeed most babies are--it is  probable that as they grow up there will no longer be any resemblance  whatever, and that his own child will develop a likeness either to him  or Mrs. Clinton, while the other child will resemble the sergeant or his  wife.\"    \"We must hope it will be so,\" the major said, \"though there are lots of  fellows who don't resemble in the least either of their parents.

NOTES.      HINEMOA, daughter of Umukaria and Hinemaru whose feat of swimming  across Lake Rotorua is the subject of the story.    MOKOIA, the large island in Rotorua Lake, celebrated in Maori song and  story, the home of Tutanekai. It was visited by Sir George Grey in the  month of December 1849. While sitting on the edge of Hinemoa's bath, a  Maori chief, descendant of Hinemoa, recited the story. It was written by  Mr. G. S. Cooper (Assistant Private Secretary to his Excellency) with  the assistance of Pirikawau Interpreter, and first published by  Williamson and Wilson at Auckland in 1851.    KAWANA, Maori spelling of Governor. Sir G. Grey.    RANGI URU, this and other names of persons shown in the genealogical  table at the end.    KAIWEKA, an elevated portion of Mokoia on the landward side of Hinemoa's  bath.    PUTORINO, Tutanekai's flute is now in the Auckland Museum in Captain  Mair's collection. It was made from the armbone of a Tohunga named Te  Murirangaranga who lived in the time of Whakaue. (From Tran. N.Z.  Institute Vol. xxviii page 39).    WAIKIMIHIA, the name of Hinemoa's bath.    WAIREREWAI, a place on the mainland near Owhata.    E NOHOIA NA E KOE, (_lit._ 'which is sat upon by you'), 'upon which you  sit.'    I NOHO AI, 'where sat.'    TANA TANE TUPU, 'her real husband.'    I MURI IHO, 'after.'    TANA TAMAITI TUPU AKE, 'his own son.'    KA TUPU, 'grew.'    KI REIRA KI, 'at.'    RAUA, an idiom common in Maori. KA HUIHUI RAUA KO TONA HOA KO TIKI, they  two and his friend Tiki assembled. _i.e._ He and his friend etc.    I AUA HUIHUINGA, 'at those gatherings.'    KUA RITE TAHI O MAUA NEI HIAHIA, 'we both desire alike.'    WHARE TAPERE, 'meeting house of sub-tribe.'    PA, 'to touch.' The Maori ladies had the privilege of declaring their  love by a squeeze of the hand.    RAURANGI occurs in the text of Sir G. Grey's Diary of his Overland  journey from Auckland to Taranaki. Again, in Sir G. Grey's Maori poems  and also in Polynesian Myth. 1st ed. But the 2nd. ed. of Poly. Myth. has  Tauarangi. The context requires a word or words similar in meaning to  Tauarangi. The meaning of Raurangi is not given in any Maori Dictionary  at present.    ANO TE RANGI, 'how sweet the sound'!    TAHA, calabash made from the hard outer skin of the Hue, a kind of  gourd.    TUMU, a stump or post used for fishing purposes.    KAI TOHU TOHU, 'guide.' A number of words are formed in Maori in this  way. _e.g._--mahi=work, kai mahi=worker; hanga=make, kai hanga=maker.    HE WIRI HOKI NONA I TE MAEKE, 'she was trembling with the cold.'    ANO HE REO TANE, 'like the voice of a man.'    KA WAHIA TE TAHA, 'the calabash was broken.' The usual method of  drinking was for the drinker to form a hollow with his hands and to  drink from one side while a slave poured water in at the other. The  meaning of the text further on, implies that Hinemoa took the calabash  and drank from it, a most unusual thing, and then broke it. If she drank  from the calabash itself it was in strict accordance with Maori custom  to break it afterwards. See amusing explanation in \"Old New Zealand.\"    KUA RIRO ATU ANO, 'it is again gone.'    I A WAI? 'by whom?'    KAHAKAHA, 'an inner garment.' Name does not occur in Hamilton's lists in  Maori Art.    TAWARU, 'an outer garment.' Not in Maori Art.    HO AKE, word only used in this way. 'Go up.'    ANO TE KIRI! 'how beautiful the skin!'    TAPU KORAKO, 'name of a rare bird.' Possibly an albino. Pirikawau's  translation has \"Wild White Hawk.\"    KOTUKU, 'the beautiful white heron.'        Till with his cloak around her thrown      He led her to his dwelling lone.      By _all the law_ the land supplied      So wedded and so made his bride.
