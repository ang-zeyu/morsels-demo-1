M. E. SADLER.        [Illustration: The College.]          RHYTHM AS A FACTOR IN EDUCATION    FROM THE FRENCH OF E. JAQUES-DALCROZE[1]        [1] First published in _Le Rhythme_ (Bale) of December, 1909.      It is barely a hundred years since music ceased to be an aristocratic  art cultivated by a few privileged individuals and became instead a  subject of instruction for almost everybody without regard to talent or  exceptional ability. Schools of Music, formerly frequented only by born  musicians, gifted from birth with unusual powers of perception for sound  and rhythm, to-day receive all who are fond of music, however little  Nature may have endowed them with the necessary capacity for musical  expression and realization. The number of solo players, both pianists  and violinists, is constantly increasing, instrumental technique is  being developed to an extraordinary degree, but everywhere, too, the  question is being asked whether the quality of instrumental players is  equal to their quantity, and whether the acquirement of extraordinary  technique is likely to help musical progress when this technique is not  joined to musical powers, if not of the first rank, at least normal.    Of ten certificated pianists of to-day, at the most one, if indeed one,  is capable of recognizing one key from another, of improvising four bars  with character or so as to give pleasure to the listener, of giving  expression to a composition without the help of the more or less  numerous annotations with which present day composers have to burden  their work, of experiencing any feeling whatever when they listen to, or  perform, the composition of another. The solo players of older days were  without exception complete musicians, able to improvise and compose,  artists driven irresistibly towards art by a noble thirst for aesthetic  expression, whereas most young people who devote themselves nowadays to  solo playing have the gifts neither of hearing nor of expression, are  content to imitate the composer's expression without the power of  feeling it, and have no other sensibility than that of the fingers, no  other motor faculty than an automatism painfully acquired. Solo playing  of the present day has specialized in a finger technique which takes no  account of the faculty of mental expression. It is no longer a means, it  has become an end.    As a rule, writing is only taught to children who have reached a  thinking age, and we do not think of initiating them into the art of  elocution until they have got something to say, until their powers of  comprehension, analysis and feeling begin to show themselves. All modern  educationalists are agreed that the first step in a child's education  should be to teach him to know himself, to accustom him to life and to  awaken in him sensations, feelings and emotions, before giving him the  power of describing them. Likewise, in modern methods of teaching to  draw, the pupil is taught to see objects before painting them. In music,  unfortunately, the same rule does not hold. Young people are taught to  play the compositions of Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Chopin and Liszt,  before their minds and ears can grasp these works, before they have  developed the faculty of being moved by them.    There are two physical agents by means of which we appreciate music.  These two agents are the ear as regards sound, and the whole nervous  system as regards rhythm. Experience has shown me that the training of  these two agents cannot easily be carried out simultaneously. A child  finds it difficult to appreciate at the same time a succession of notes  forming a melody and the rhythm which animates them.    Before teaching the relation which exists between sound and movement, it  is wise to undertake the independent study of each of these two  elements. Tone is evidently secondary, since it has not its origin and  model in ourselves, whereas movement is instinctive in man and therefore  primary. Therefore I begin the study of music by careful and  experimental teaching of movement. This is based in earliest childhood  on the automatic exercise of marching, for marching is the natural model  of time measure.    By means of various accentuations with the foot, I teach the different  time measures. Pauses (of varying lengths) in the marching teach the  children to distinguish durations of sound; movements to time with the  arms and the head preserve order in the succession of the time measures  and analyse the bars and pauses.    All this, no doubt, seems very simple, and so I thought when beginning  my experiments. Unfortunately, the latter have shown me that it is not  so simple as it seems, but on the contrary very complicated. And this  because most children have no instinct for time, for time values, for  accentuation, for physical balance; because the motor faculties are not  the same in all individuals, and because a number of obstacles impede  the exact and rapid physical realization of mental conceptions. One  child is always behind the beat when marching, another always ahead;  another takes unequal steps, another on the contrary lacks balance. All  these faults, if not corrected in the first years, will reappear later  in the musical technique of the individual.    Unsteady time when singing or playing, confusion in playing, inability  to follow when accompanying, accentuating too roughly or with lack of  precision, all these faults have their origin in the child's muscular  and nervous control, in lack of co-ordination between the mind which  conceives, the brain which orders, the nerve which transmits and the  muscle which executes. And still more, the power of phrasing and shading  music with feeling depends equally upon the training of the  nerve-centres, upon the co-ordination of the muscular system, upon rapid  communication between brain and limbs--in a word, upon the health of the  whole organism; and it is by trying to discover the individual cause of  each musical defect, and to find a means of correcting it, that I have  gradually built up my method of eurhythmics.    This method is entirely based upon experiments many times repeated, and  not one of the exercises has been adopted until it has been applied  under different forms and under different conditions and its usefulness  definitely proved. Many people have a completely false idea of my  system, and consider it is a simple variant on the methods of physical  training at present in fashion, whose inventors have undoubtedly  rendered great service to humanity.    I cannot help smiling when I read in certain papers, over names which  carry weight, articles in which my method is compared to other gymnastic  systems. The fact is, my book is simply a register of the different  exercises which I have invented, and says nothing of my ideas in  general, for it is written for those who have learnt to interpret my  meaning under my personal tuition at Geneva and Hellerau.    Quite naturally, half the critics who have done me the honour of  discussing the book, have only glanced through it and looked at the  photographs. Not one of them has undergone the special training upon  which I lay stress and without which I deny absolutely that any one has  the right to pass a definite judgment on my meaning; for one does not  learn to ride by reading a book on horsemanship, and eurhythmics are  above all a matter of personal experience.    The object of the method is, in the first instance, to create by the  help of rhythm a rapid and regular current of communication between  brain and body; and what differentiates my physical exercises from those  of present-day methods of muscular development is that each of them is  conceived in the form which can most quickly establish in the brain the  image of the movement studied.    It is a question of eliminating in every muscular movement, by the help  of will, the untimely intervention of muscles useless for the movement  in question, and thus developing attention, consciousness and  will-power. Next must be created an automatic technique for all those  muscular movements which do not need the help of the consciousness, so  that the latter may be reserved for those forms of expression which are  purely intelligent. Thanks to the co-ordination of the nerve-centres, to  the formation and development of the greatest possible number of motor  habits, my method assures the freest possible play to subconscious  expression. The creation in the organism of a rapid and easy means of  communication between thought and its means of expression by movements  allows the personality free play, giving it character, strength and life  to an extraordinary degree.    Neurasthenia is often nothing else than intellectual confusion produced  by the inability of the nervous system to obtain from the muscular  system regular obedience to the order from the brain. Training the nerve  centres, establishing order in the organism, is the only remedy for  intellectual perversion produced by lack of will power and by the  incomplete subjection of body to mind. Unable to obtain physical  realization of its ideas, the brain amuses itself in forming images  without hope of realizing them, drops the real for the unreal, and  substitutes vain and vague speculation for the free and healthy union of  mind and body.    The first result of a thorough rhythmic training is that the pupil sees  clearly in himself what he really is, and obtains from his powers all  the advantage possible. This result seems to me one which should attract  the attention of all educationalists and assure to education by and for  rhythm an important place in general culture.    But, as an artist, I wish to add, that the second result of this  education ought to be to put the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21654"],[0,"In and Around Berlin (#2)"],[1,"unpacks  her trunk in the Berlin apartment which, according to general custom,  is to serve her for sleeping-room, breakfast-room, study, and  reception-room. In a lengthened sojourn, in hotels, _pensions_, and  private residences, I never saw a closet opening from such an  apartment. Indeed, there were, in the houses I visited, no closets of  any kind; unless an unlighted, unventilated cubic space in the middle  of the house or near the kitchen--the upper half often devoted to  sleeping room for domestics, and the lower to a general rendezvous of  odds and ends--might be dignified with that name. A statement which I  once ventured in conversation, as to the closets opening from nearly  every room of an American house, was received with a look of  incredulity and wonder. Neither did I see a real bureau in Berlin. A  poor substitute was a portable piece of furniture, often quite  ornamental, which opened by doors, exposing all the shelves whenever  an article on any one of them was wanted. Here must be kept bonnets,  hats, gloves, ribbons, laces, underwear, and all the thousand  accumulations of the toilet; while a cramped \"wardrobe\" was the  receptacle of shoes, cloaks, and dresses, hung perhaps three or four  or five deep on the half-dozen wooden pegs within. Bathrooms were the  rare exceptions. As a rule, bathing must be done with a sponge and  cold water, in one's private apartment, where are no faucets, drains,  or set bowls, but the ordinary wash-bowl, pitcher, and jar. Evidently  German civilization does not rate the bath very high among the  comforts of life.    An essential part of the furniture in the kind of apartment I am  describing, is a screen to stand before each bed and wash-stand. The  beds are invariably single, two or more being placed in a room when  needed, the screens, by day, transforming the room into a parlor.  There are no carpets. On the oiled or painted wooden floors rugs are  placed before the beds, before the sofa, and under the table which  always stands before it. One luxury is seldom wanting,--a good  writing-desk, with pens and ink ready for use. It is no trouble to a  German hostess to increase or diminish the number of beds in a room,  the narrow bedsteads being carried with ease through the double doors,  from room to room, as convenience requires.    Pictures are on the walls,--not often remarkable as works of art, but  most frequently stimulants to love of country,--portraits of the  Kaiser and the Crown Prince, and battle scenes in which glory is  reflected on the Prussian arms. Every window is double; the two outer  vertical halves opening on hinges outward, and the inner opening in  the same manner into the room. Graceful lace drapery is the rule, over  plain cotton hangings or Venetian blinds.    The arrangement of the bedding is peculiar. Over a set of wire springs  is laid the mattress, in a closely fitting white case, buttoned, tied,  or laced together at one end. This case takes the place of an under  sheet. The feather pillow is in a plain slip of white cotton,  similarly fastened. Over the whole a blanket or comfortable is laid,  securely enfolded in another white case, which also serves instead of  an upper sheet. Over this is the feather bed, usually encased in  colored print, sometimes of bright colors. Under this one always  sleeps. Over the bed, from low head-board to foot-board, is stretched  by day the uppermost covering. Ours was of maroon cotton flannel,  bordered in front by a flounce intended to be ornamental. The custom  is to furnish clean cases and pillow-slips once a month, and it is  difficult to secure more frequent changes of bed-linen.    Ventilation is something of which the Germans are particularly afraid.  The impure air of schools, halls, churches, and other places of  assemblage is dreadful, and a draught is regarded as the messenger of  death. When our landlady found that we were in the habit of sleeping  with our windows open, most emphatic remonstrance was made, with the  assurance that this would never do in Berlin. However, like the  drinking of water, against which also warnings are customary, the  breathing of fresh air was to us followed by no harmful results.    These differences in habits and customs of household life, like the  sounds of a strange language, affect the traveller unpleasantly at  first. But differences in national customs are natural and inevitable,  and one gradually becomes accustomed to them, and enabled to live a  happy life in spite of them, as appreciation grows when acquaintance  has made one familiar with many interesting and excellent aspects of  existence here.            II.    FAMILY AND SOCIAL LIFE.      Holidays and birthdays are more scrupulously and formally observed in  Germany than with us. There are cakes and lighted candles and flowers  for the one whose birthday makes him for the time the most important  personage in the family, and who sits in holiday dress in the  reception-room, to receive the calls and congratulations of friends.  Those who cannot call send letters and presents, which are displayed,  with those received from the family, on a table devoted to the  purpose; and the array is often quite extensive. The presents are  seldom extravagant, consisting largely of the ornamental handiwork of  friends and of useful articles of clothing for common use.    A genuine German family festival on Christmas eve is a pleasant thing  to see. We accepted with pleasure the invitation of Frau B---- and her  family, to be present at theirs. In a large _salon_ adjoining that  where the table was laid for supper, was another long table spread  with a white cloth. Toward the farther end of the table stood a tall  Christmas-tree, decked with various simple ornaments; and the candles  on it were lighted with a little ceremony, the chubby granddaughter of  three years pointing her bare arm and uplifted forefinger to the tree,  and reciting a short poem appropriate to the occasion, as we entered  the room, about half-past seven o'clock. Then the beautiful and  winning child found her toys, her lovely wax doll and its cradle, and  another doll of rubber, small and homely, on which, after the fashion  of little mothers, she imprinted her most affectionate kisses.  Suddenly the room was radiant with a contagious happiness. \"The little  Fraeulein,\" daughter of the hostess, just engaged by cable to a  gentleman in America, had found his picture, wreathed with fresh and  fragrant rosebuds, among her presents; and the smiles and blushes  chased each other over her face, as the engagement was thus announced  by her mother to the assembled guests. She answered her  congratulations by more blushes and smiles, laying her hand on her  heart, and saying with true German frankness, \"Oh, I am so happy!\" No  presents hung on the tree, but those intended for each person were in  a group beside a plate of cakes and bonbons, with a card bearing the  name. Each of the company found his own, delicately assisted by the  hostess and her daughters. Then the servants were called in, to find  their presents on side tables, to receive and express good wishes and  thanks, and to join in the general joy of the household over the  engagement. After supper in the dining-room, we talked awhile, there  was music from the piano, then the married daughter and her family  withdrew with kind \"good-nights;\" and before a late hour all the other  guests had done the same, not, however, until the national airs of  America and of Scotland had been sung by all present, in honor of the  guests from these countries.    Private hospitality is kind and open, but so far as our observation  went, conducted within certain specified limits seldom overstepped.  Order of precedence is carefully observed, and more honor is shown to  age than with us. The best seat in the drawing-room is the sofa. A  single guest would never be offered any other place, and among a  number the eldest or the most honored would be invariably conducted  there. Hence no one would venture to take this place of honor  uninvited. Sometimes one is secretly glad of not being invited to  crowd behind the table which usually stands, covered with a spread,  inconveniently close before the sofa, and of having instead a chair,  with a better support for the back.    One is expected to bow to the hostess and to each guest on coming to  the table, and also on leaving it. Odd as this seems at first, it soon  becomes a habit rather pleasant than burdensome, and one grows  insensibly to admire the outward politeness of this German custom.  Greetings and farewells are more ceremonious, even between intimate  friends, than with us; and to omit a ceremonious leave-taking or to  substitute a light bow and \"good day\" would not make a pleasant  impression on a German hostess. Americans, especially young ladies,  are much criticised for their independence and lack of courtesy. A  German friend told me that a young American lady who had formerly  been an inmate of her family called to bid her good-by before leaving  Berlin. \"I was amazed,\" she said, \"at such politeness.\" It is not  alone in matters of courtesy that young American ladies shock the  Germans. Though a young lady has more freedom in Germany than in  France and Italy, she is expected to conform carefully to the custom  of going out in the evening or travelling only in company with a  relative if a gentleman, or with an older lady. It is true that  American girls are forgiven some liberties which no German girl would  think of taking, on the ground of American customs; and a careful,  well-bred young lady, from our side the water will seldom fall into  serious trouble if she observes the rule of not going out unattended.  But young ladies from America in Europe hold largely the honor of  their country in their hands, and they ought to recognize this  responsibility.    German politeness has also a reverse side.
