In walking among the ruins of religious buildings, we came to two vaults  over which had formerly stood the house of the sub-prior.  One of the  vaults was inhabited by an old woman, who claimed the right of abode  there, as the widow of a man whose ancestors had possessed the same  gloomy mansion for no less than four generations.  The right, however it  began, was considered as established by legal prescription, and the old  woman lives undisturbed.  She thinks however that she has a claim to  something more than sufferance; for as her husband's name was Bruce, she  is allied to royalty, and told Mr. Boswell that when there were persons  of quality in the place, she was distinguished by some notice; that  indeed she is now neglected, but she spins a thread, has the company of  her cat, and is troublesome to nobody.    Having now seen whatever this ancient city offered to our curiosity, we  left it with good wishes, having reason to be highly pleased with the  attention that was paid us.  But whoever surveys the world must see many  things that give him pain.  The kindness of the professors did not  contribute to abate the uneasy remembrance of an university declining, a  college alienated, and a church profaned and hastening to the ground.    St. Andrews indeed has formerly suffered more atrocious ravages and more  extensive destruction, but recent evils affect with greater force.  We  were reconciled to the sight of archiepiscopal ruins.  The distance of a  calamity from the present time seems to preclude the mind from contact or  sympathy.  Events long past are barely known; they are not considered.  We  read with as little emotion the violence of Knox and his followers, as  the irruptions of Alaric and the Goths.  Had the university been  destroyed two centuries ago, we should not have regretted it; but to see  it pining in decay and struggling for life, fills the mind with mournful  images and ineffectual wishes.          ABERBROTHICK      As we knew sorrow and wishes to be vain, it was now our business to mind  our way.  The roads of Scotland afford little diversion to the traveller,  who seldom sees himself either encountered or overtaken, and who has  nothing to contemplate but grounds that have no visible boundaries, or  are separated by walls of loose stone.  From the bank of the Tweed to St.  Andrews I had never seen a single tree, which I did not believe to have  grown up far within the present century.  Now and then about a  gentleman's house stands a small plantation, which in Scotch is called a  policy, but of these there are few, and those few all very young.  The  variety of sun and shade is here utterly unknown.  There is no tree for  either shelter or timber.  The oak and the thorn is equally a stranger,  and the whole country is extended in uniform nakedness, except that in  the road between Kirkaldy and Cowpar, I passed for a few yards between  two hedges.  A tree might be a show in Scotland as a horse in Venice.  At  St. Andrews Mr. Boswell found only one, and recommended it to my notice;  I told him that it was rough and low, or looked as if I thought so.  This,  said he, is nothing to another a few miles off.  I was still less  delighted to hear that another tree was not to be seen nearer.  Nay, said  a gentleman that stood by, I know but of this and that tree in the  county.    The Lowlands of Scotland had once undoubtedly an equal portion of woods  with other countries.  Forests are every where gradually diminished, as  architecture and cultivation prevail by the increase of people and the  introduction of arts.  But I believe few regions have been denuded like  this, where many centuries must have passed in waste without the least  thought of future supply.  Davies observes in his account of Ireland,  that no Irishman had ever planted an orchard.  For that negligence some  excuse might be drawn from an unsettled state of life, and the  instability of property; but in Scotland possession has long been secure,  and inheritance regular, yet it may be doubted whether before the Union  any man between Edinburgh and England had ever set a tree.    Of this improvidence no other account can be given than that it probably  began in times of tumult, and continued because it had begun.  Established  custom is not easily broken, till some great event shakes the whole  system of things, and life seems to recommence upon new principles.  That  before the Union the Scots had little trade and little money, is no valid  apology; for plantation is the least expensive of all methods of  improvement.  To drop a seed into the ground can cost nothing, and the  trouble is not great of protecting the young plant, till it is out of  danger; though it must be allowed to have some difficulty in places like  these, where they have neither wood for palisades, nor thorns for hedges.    Our way was over the Firth of Tay, where, though the water was not wide,  we paid four shillings for ferrying the chaise.  In Scotland the  necessaries of life are easily procured, but superfluities and elegancies  are of the same price at least as in England, and therefore may be  considered as much dearer.    We stopped a while at Dundee, where I remember nothing remarkable, and  mounting our chaise again, came about the close of the day to  Aberbrothick.    The monastery of Aberbrothick is of great renown in the history of  Scotland.  Its ruins afford ample testimony of its ancient magnificence:  Its extent might, I suppose, easily be found by following the walls among  the grass and weeds, and its height is known by some parts yet standing.  The arch of one of the gates is entire, and of another only so far  dilapidated as to diversify the appearance.  A square apartment of great  loftiness is yet standing; its use I could not conjecture, as its  elevation was very disproportionate to its area.  Two corner towers,  particularly attracted our attention.  Mr. Boswell, whose inquisitiveness  is seconded by great activity, scrambled in at a high window, but found  the stairs within broken, and could not reach the top.  Of the other  tower we were told that the inhabitants sometimes climbed it, but we did  not immediately discern the entrance, and as the night was gathering upon  us, thought proper to desist.  Men skilled in architecture might do what  we did not attempt: They might probably form an exact ground-plot of this  venerable edifice.  They may from some parts yet standing conjecture its  general form, and perhaps by comparing it with other buildings of the  same kind and the same age, attain an idea very near to truth.  I should  scarcely have regretted my journey, had it afforded nothing more than the  sight of Aberbrothick.          MONTROSE      Leaving these fragments of magnificence, we travelled on to Montrose,  which we surveyed in the morning, and found it well built, airy, and  clean.  The townhouse is a handsome fabrick with a portico.  We then went  to view the English chapel, and found a small church, clean to a degree  unknown in any other part of Scotland, with commodious galleries, and  what was yet less expected, with an organ.    At our inn we did not find a reception such as we thought proportionate  to the commercial opulence of the place; but Mr. Boswell desired me to  observe that the innkeeper was an Englishman, and I then defended him as  well as I could.    When I had proceeded thus far, I had opportunities of observing what I  had never heard, that there are many beggars in Scotland.  In Edinburgh  the proportion is, I think, not less than in London, and in the smaller  places it is far greater than in English towns of the same extent.  It  must, however, be allowed that they are not importunate, nor clamorous.  They solicit silently, or very modestly, and therefore though their  behaviour may strike with more force the heart of a stranger, they are  certainly in danger of missing the attention of their countrymen.  Novelty  has always some power, an unaccustomed mode of begging excites an  unaccustomed degree of pity.  But the force of novelty is by its own  nature soon at an end; the efficacy of outcry and perseverance is  permanent and certain.    The road from Montrose exhibited a continuation of the same appearances.  The country is still naked, the hedges are of stone, and the fields so  generally plowed that it is hard to imagine where grass is found for the  horses that till them.  The harvest, which was almost ripe, appeared very  plentiful.    Early in the afternoon Mr. Boswell observed that we were at no great  distance from the house of lord Monboddo.  The magnetism of his  conversation easily drew us out of our way, and the entertainment which  we received would have been a sufficient recompense for a much greater  deviation.    The roads beyond Edinburgh, as they are less frequented, must be expected  to grow gradually rougher; but they were hitherto by no means  incommodious.  We travelled on with the gentle pace of a Scotch driver,  who having no rivals in expedition, neither gives himself nor his horses  unnecessary trouble.  We did not affect the impatience we did not feel,  but were satisfied with the company of each other as well riding in the  chaise, as sitting at an inn.  The night and the day are equally solitary  and equally safe; for where there are so few travellers, why should there  be robbers.          ABERDEEN      We came somewhat late to Aberdeen, and found the inn so full, that we had  some difficulty in obtaining admission, till Mr. Boswell made himself  known: His name overpowered all objection, and we found a very good house  and civil treatment.    I received the next day a very kind letter from Sir Alexander Gordon,  whom I had formerly known in London, and after a cessation of all  intercourse for near twenty years met here professor of physic in the  King's College.  Such unexpected renewals of acquaintance may be numbered  among the most"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20656"],[0,"Old Christmas: from the Sketch Book of Washington Irving (#2)"],[1,"     _Old Song._            [Illustration: CHRISTMAS]      There is nothing in England that exercises a more delightful spell over  my imagination than the lingerings of the holiday customs and rural  games of former times. They recall the pictures my fancy used to draw in  the May morning of life, when as yet I only knew the world through  books, and believed it to be all that poets had painted it; and they  bring with them the flavour of those honest days of yore, in which,  perhaps with equal fallacy, I am apt to think the world was more  home-bred, social, and joyous than at present. I regret to say that they  are daily growing more and more faint, being gradually worn away by  time, but still more obliterated by modern fashion. They resemble those  picturesque morsels of Gothic architecture which we see crumbling in  various parts of the country, partly dilapidated by the waste of ages,  and partly lost in the additions and alterations of latter days. Poetry,  however, clings with cherishing fondness about the rural game and  holiday revel, from which it has derived so many of its themes--as the  ivy winds its rich foliage about the Gothic arch and mouldering tower,  gratefully repaying their support by clasping together their tottering  remains, and, as it were, embalming them in verdure.    [Illustration]    Of all the old festivals, however, that of Christmas awakens the  strongest and most heartfelt associations. There is a tone of solemn and  sacred feeling that blends with our conviviality, and lifts the spirit  to a state of hallowed and elevated enjoyment. The services of the  church about this season are extremely tender and inspiring. They dwell  on the beautiful story of the origin of our faith, and the pastoral  scenes that accompanied its announcement. They gradually increase in  fervour and pathos during the season of Advent, until they break forth  in full jubilee on the morning that brought peace and good-will to men.  I do not know a grander effect of music on the moral feelings than to  hear the full choir and the pealing organ performing a Christmas anthem  in a cathedral, and filling every part of the vast pile with triumphant  harmony.    [Illustration]    It is a beautiful arrangement, also, derived from days of yore, that  this festival, which commemorates the announcement of the religion of  peace and love, has been made the season for gathering together of  family connections, and drawing closer again those bands of kindred  hearts which the cares and pleasures and sorrows of the world are  continually operating to cast loose; of calling back the children of a  family who have launched forth in life, and wandered widely asunder,  once more to assemble about the paternal hearth, that rallying-place of  the affections, there to grow young and loving again among the endearing  mementoes of childhood.    [Illustration]    There is something in the very season of the year that gives a charm to  the festivity of Christmas. At other times we derive a great portion of  our pleasures from the mere beauties of nature. Our feelings sally  forth and dissipate themselves over the sunny landscape, and we \"live  abroad and everywhere.\" The song of the bird, the murmur of the stream,  the breathing fragrance of spring, the soft voluptuousness of summer,  the golden pomp of autumn; earth with its mantle of refreshing green,  and heaven with its deep delicious blue and its cloudy magnificence, all  fill us with mute but exquisite delight, and we revel in the luxury of  mere sensation. But in the depth of winter, when nature lies despoiled  of every charm, and wrapped in her shroud of sheeted snow, we turn for  our gratifications to moral sources. The dreariness and desolation of  the landscape, the short gloomy days and darksome nights, while they  circumscribe our wanderings, shut in our feelings also from rambling  abroad, and make us more keenly disposed for the pleasures of the social  circle. Our thoughts are more concentrated; our friendly sympathies more  aroused. We feel more sensibly the charm of each other's society, and  are brought more closely together by dependence on each other for  enjoyment. Heart calleth unto heart; and we draw our pleasures from the  deep wells of living kindness, which lie in the quiet recesses of our  bosoms; and which, when resorted to, furnish forth the pure element of  domestic felicity.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    The pitchy gloom without makes the heart dilate on entering the room  filled with the glow and warmth of the evening fire. The ruddy blaze  diffuses an artificial summer and sunshine through the room, and lights  up each countenance into a kindlier welcome. Where does the honest face  of hospitality expand into a broader and more cordial smile--where is  the shy glance of love more sweetly eloquent--than by the winter  fireside? and as the hollow blast of wintry wind rushes through the  hall, claps the distant door, whistles about the casement, and rumbles  down the chimney, what can be more grateful than that feeling of sober  and sheltered security with which we look round upon the comfortable  chamber and the scene of domestic hilarity?    [Illustration]    The English, from the great prevalence of rural habits throughout every  class of society, have always been fond of those festivals and holidays  which agreeably interrupt the stillness of country life; and they were,  in former days, particularly observant of the religious and social rites  of Christmas. It is inspiring to read even the dry details which some  antiquarians have given of the quaint humours, the burlesque pageants,  the complete abandonment to mirth and good-fellowship, with which this  festival was celebrated. It seemed to throw open every door, and unlock  every heart. It brought the peasant and the peer together, and blended  all ranks in one warm generous flow of joy and kindness. The old halls  of castles and manor-houses resounded with the harp and the Christmas  carol, and their ample boards groaned under the weight of hospitality.  Even the poorest cottage welcomed the festive season with green  decorations of bay and holly--the cheerful fire glanced its rays through  the lattice, inviting the passenger to raise the latch, and join the  gossip knot huddled round the hearth, beguiling the long evening with  legendary jokes and oft-told Christmas tales.    [Illustration]    One of the least pleasing effects of modern refinement is the havoc it  has made among the hearty old holiday customs. It has completely taken  off the sharp touchings and spirited reliefs of these embellishments of  life, and has worn down society into a more smooth and polished, but  certainly a less characteristic surface. Many of the games and  ceremonials of Christmas have entirely disappeared, and, like the  sherris sack of old Falstaff, are become matters of speculation and  dispute among commentators. They flourished in times full of spirit and  lustihood, when men enjoyed life roughly, but heartily and vigorously;  times wild and picturesque, which have furnished poetry with its richest  materials, and the drama with its most attractive variety of characters  and manners. The world has become more worldly. There is more of  dissipation, and less of enjoyment. Pleasure has expanded into a  broader, but a shallower stream, and has forsaken many of those deep and  quiet channels where it flowed sweetly through the calm bosom of  domestic life. Society has acquired a more enlightened and elegant tone;  but it has lost many of its strong local peculiarities, its home-bred  feelings, its honest fireside delights. The traditionary customs of  golden-hearted antiquity, its feudal hospitalities, and lordly  wassailings, have passed away with the baronial castles and stately  manor-houses in which they were celebrated. They comported with the  shadowy hall, the great oaken gallery, and the tapestried parlour, but  are unfitted to the light showy saloons and gay drawing-rooms of the  modern villa.    [Illustration]    Shorn, however, as it is, of its ancient and festive honours, Christmas  is still a period of delightful excitement in England. It is gratifying  to see that home-feeling completely aroused which seems to hold so  powerful a place in every English bosom. The preparations making on  every side for the social board that is again to unite friends and  kindred; the presents of good cheer passing and repassing, those tokens  of regard, and quickeners of kind feelings; the evergreens distributed  about houses and churches, emblems of peace and gladness; all these have  the most pleasing effect in producing fond associations, and kindling  benevolent sympathies. Even the sound of the waits, rude as may be their  minstrelsy, breaks upon the mid-watches of a winter night with the  effect of perfect harmony. As I have been awakened by them in that still  and solemn hour, \"when deep sleep falleth upon man,\" I have listened  with a hushed delight, and connecting them with the sacred and joyous  occasion, have almost fancied them into another celestial choir,  announcing peace and good-will to mankind.    [Illustration]    How delightfully the imagination, when wrought upon by these moral  influences, turns everything to melody and beauty: The very crowing of  the cock, who is sometimes heard in the profound repose of the country,  \"telling the night watches to his feathery dames,\" was thought by the  common people to announce the approach of this sacred festival:--              \"Some say that ever 'gainst that season comes             Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,             This bird of dawning singeth all night long:             And then, they say, no spirit dares stir abroad;             The nights are wholesome--then no planets strike,             No fairy takes, no witch hath power to charm,             So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.\"    Amidst the general"]]]
