A large flat-bottomed boat was slung on chains  which spanned the river, and could be worked slowly across the water by  means of a small windlass. Though it was perfectly possible, and often  even more convenient, to drive to the school direct from Llangarmon  Junction, so great was the popular feeling in favour of arrival by the  ferry that at the autumn and spring reunions the girls were allowed to  avail themselves of the branch railway and approach The Woodlands by way  of the river.    They now hurried on to the boat as if anticipating a pleasure-jaunt. The  capacities of the flat were designed to accommodate a flock of sheep or  a farm wagon and horses, so there was room and to spare even for  thirty-seven girls and their hand luggage. Evan Davis, the crusty old  ferryman, greeted them with his usual inarticulate grunt, a kind of \"Oh,  here you are again, are you!\" form of welcome which was more forceful  than gracious. He linked the protecting chains carefully across the end  of the boat, called out a remark in Welsh to his son, Griffith, and,  seizing the handle, began to work the windlass. Very slowly and  leisurely the flat swung out into the river. The tide was at the full  and the wide expanse of water seemed like a lake. The clanking chains  brought up bunches of seaweed and river grass which fell with an oozy  thud upon the deck. The mountain air, blowing straight from Penllwyd,  was tinged with ozone from the tide. The girls stood looking up the  reach of water towards the hills, and tasting the salt on their lips  with supreme gratification. It was not every school that assembled by  such a romantic means of conveyance as an ancient flat-bottomed  ferry-boat, and they rejoiced over their privileges.    \"I'm glad the tide's full; it makes the crossing so much wider,\"  murmured Helen Cooper, with an eye of admiration on the woods.    \"Don't suppose Evan shares your enthusiasm,\" laughed Marjorie Earnshaw.  \"He's paid the same, whatever the length of the journey.\"    \"Old Grumps gets half a crown for his job, so he needn't grumble,\" put  in Doris Deane.    \"Oh, trust him! He'd look sour at a pound note.\"    \"What makes him so cross?\"    \"Oh, he's old and lame, I suppose, and has a crotchety temper.\"    \"Here we are at last!\"    The boat was grating on the shore. Griffith was unfastening the movable  end, and in another moment the girls were springing out gingerly, one by  one, on to the decidedly muddy stepping-stones that formed a rough  causeway to the bank. A cart was waiting to convey the handbags (all  boxes had been sent as \"advance luggage\" two days before), so,  disencumbered of their numerous possessions, the girls started to walk  the steep uphill mile that led to The Woodlands.    Miss Bowes and Miss Teddington, the partners who owned the school, had  been exceptionally fortunate in their choice of a house. If, as runs the  modern theory, beautiful surroundings in our early youth are of the  utmost importance in training our perceptions and aiding the growth of  our higher selves, then surely nowhere in the British Isles could a more  suitable setting have been found for a home of education. The long  terrace commanded a view of the whole of the Craigwen Valley, an expanse  of about sixteen miles. The river, like a silver ribbon, wound through  woods and marshland till it widened into a broad tidal estuary as it  neared the sea. The mountains, which rose tier after tier from the level  green meadows, had their lower slopes thickly clothed with pines and  larches; but where they towered above the level of a thousand feet the  forest growth gave way to gorse and bracken, and their jagged summits,  bare of all vegetation save a few clumps of coarse grass, showed a  splintered, weather-worn outline against the sky. Penllwyd, Penglaslyn,  and Glyder Garmon, those lofty peaks like three strong Welsh giants,  seemed to guard the entrance to the enchanted valley, and to keep it a  place apart, a last fortress of nature, a sanctuary for birds and  flowers, a paradise of green shade and leaping waters, and a  breathing-space for body and soul.    The house, named \"The Woodlands\" by Miss Bowes in place of its older but  rather unpronounceable name of Llwyngwrydd (the green grove), took both  its Welsh and English appellations from a beautiful glade, planted with  oaks, which formed the southern boundary of the property. Through this  park-like dell flowed a mountain stream, tumbling in little white  cascades between the big boulders that formed its bed, and pouring in  quite a waterfall over a ledge of rock into a wide pool. Its steady  rippling murmur never stopped, and could be heard day and night through  the ever-open windows, gentle and subdued in dry weather, but rising to  a roar when rain in the hills brought the flood down in a turbulent  torrent.    Through lessons, play, or dreams this sound of many waters was ever  present; it gave an atmosphere to the school which, if passed unnoticed  through extreme familiarity, would have been instantly missed if it  could have stopped. To the girls this stream was a kind of guardian  deity, with the glade for its sacred grove. They loved every rock and  stone and cataract, almost every patch of brown moss upon its boulders.  Each morning of the summer term they bathed before breakfast in the pool  where a big oak-tree shaded the cataract. It was so close to the house  that they could run out in mackintoshes, and so retired that it  resembled a private swimming-bath. Here they enjoyed themselves like  water-nymphs, splashing in the shallows, plunging in the pool, swinging  from the boughs of the oak-tree, and scrambling over the lichened  boulders. It was a source of deep regret to the hardier spirits that  they were not allowed to take their morning dip in the stream all the  year round; but on that score mistresses were adamant, and with the  close of September the naiads perforce withdrew from their favourite  element till it was warmed again by the May sunshine.    The house itself had originally been an ancient Welsh dwelling of the  days of the Tudors, but had been largely added to in later times. The  straight front, with its rows of windows, classic doorway, and  stone-balustraded terrace, was certainly Georgian in type, and the  tower, an architectural eyesore, was plainly Victorian. The taste of the  early nineteenth century had not been faultless, and all the best part  of the building, from an artistic point of view, lay at the back. This  mainly consisted of kitchens and servants' quarters, but there still  remained a large hall, which was the chief glory of the establishment.  It was very lofty, for in common with other specimens of the period it  had no upper story, the roof being timbered like that of a church. The  walls were panelled with oak to a height of about eight feet, and above  that were decorated with elaborate designs in plaster relief,  representing lions, wild boars, stags, unicorns, and other heraldic  devices from the coat-of-arms of the original owner of the estate. A  narrow winding staircase led to a minstrels' gallery, from which was  suspended a wooden shield emblazoned with the Welsh dragon and the  national motto, \"Cymru am byth\" (\"Wales for ever\").    If the hall was the main picturesque asset of the building, it must be  admitted that the unromantic front portion was highly convenient, and  had been most readily adaptable for a school. The large light rooms of  the ground floor made excellent classrooms, and the upper story was so  lavishly provided with windows that it had been possible, by means of  wooden partitions, to turn the great bedrooms into rows of small  dormitories, each capable of accommodating two girls.    The bright airy house, the terrace with its glorious view of the valley,  the large old-fashioned garden, and, above all, the stream and the glade  made a very pleasant setting for the school life of the forty-eight  pupils at The Woodlands. The two principals worked together in perfect  harmony. Each had her own department. Miss Bowes, who was short, stout,  grey-haired, and motherly, looked after the housekeeping, the hygiene,  and the business side. She wrote letters to parents, kept the accounts,  interviewed tradespeople, superintended the mending, and was the final  referee in all matters pertaining to health and general conduct. \"Dear  Old Rainbow\", as the girls nicknamed her, was frankly popular, for she  was sympathetic and usually disposed to listen, in reason, to the  various plaints which were brought to the sanctum of her private  sitting-room. Her authority alone could excuse preparation, order  breakfast in bed, remit practising, dispense jujubes, allow special  festivities, and grant half-holidays. It was rumoured that she thought  of retiring and leaving the school to her partner, and such a report  always drew from parents the opinion that she would be greatly missed.    Miss Teddington, younger by many years, took a more active part in the  teaching, and superintended the games and outdoor sports. She was tall  and athletic, a good mathematician, and interested in archaeology and  nature study. She led the walks and rambles, taught the Sixth Form, and  represented the more scholastic and modern element. Her enterprise  initiated all fresh undertakings, and her enthusiasm carried them  forward with success. \"Hard-as-nails\" the girls sometimes called her,  for she coddled nobody and expected the utmost from each one's capacity.  If she was rather uncompromising, however, she was just, and a strong  vein of humour toned down much of the severity of her remarks. To be  chided by a person whose eye is capable of twinkling takes part of the  sting from the reprimand, and the general verdict of the school was to  the effect that \"Teddie was a keen old watch-dog, but her bark was worse  than her bite.\"    Of the other mistresses and girls we will"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20733"],[0,"Critical Miscellanies (Vol. 1 of 3), Essay 1: Robespierre (#2)"],[1,"is one  of the worst maladies that can afflict the human mind.' This bold  aphorism touches one of the roots of the judgments we pass both upon men  and events. It is because people so irrationally think fit to insist  upon perfection, that Robespierre's admirers would fain deny that he  ever had a fault, and the tacit adoption of the same impracticable  standard makes it easier for Robespierre's wholesale detractors to deny  that he had a single virtue or performed a single service. The point of  view is essentially unfit for history. The real subject of history is  the improvement of social arrangements, and no conspicuous actor in  public affairs since the world began saw the true direction of  improvement with an absolutely unerring eye from the beginning of his  career to the end. It is folly for the historian, as it is for the  statesman, to strain after the imaginative unity of the dramatic  creator. Social progress is an affair of many small pieces and slow  accretions, and the interest of historic study lies in tracing, amid the  immense turmoil of events and through the confusion of voices, the  devious course of the sacred torch, as it shifts from bearer to bearer.  And it is not the bearers who are most interesting, but the torch.           *       *       *       *       *    In the old Flemish town of Arras, known in the diplomatic history of the  fifteenth century by a couple of important treaties, and famous in the  industrial history of the Middle Ages for its pre-eminence in the  manufacture of the most splendid kind of tapestry hangings, Maximilian  Robespierre was born in May 1758. He was therefore no more than five and  thirty years old when he came to his ghastly end in 1794. His father was  a lawyer, and, though the surname of the family had the prefix of  nobility, they belonged to the middle class. When this decorative prefix  became dangerous, Maximilian Derobespierre dropped it. His great rival,  Danton, was less prudent or less fortunate, and one of the charges made  against him was that he had styled himself Monsieur D'Anton.    Robespierre's youth was embittered by sharp misfortune. His mother died  when he was only seven years old, and his father had so little courage  under the blow that he threw up his practice, deserted his children, and  died in purposeless wanderings through Germany. The burden that the weak  and selfish throw down, must be taken up by the brave. Friendly  kinsfolk charged themselves with the maintenance of the four orphans.  Maximilian was sent to the school of the town, whence he proceeded with  a sizarship to the college of Louis-le-Grand in Paris. He was an apt and  studious pupil, but austere, and disposed to that sombre cast of spirits  which is common enough where a lad of some sensibility and much  self-esteem finds himself stamped with a badge of social inferiority.  Robespierre's worshippers love to dwell on his fondness for birds: with  the universal passion of mankind for legends of the saints, they tell  how the untimely death of a favourite pigeon afflicted him with anguish  so poignant, that, even sixty long years after, it made his sister's  heart ache to look back upon the pain of that tragic moment. Always a  sentimentalist, Robespierre was from boyhood a devout enthusiast for the  great high priest of the sentimental tribe. Rousseau was then passing  the last squalid days of his life among the meadows and woods at  Ermenonville. Robespierre, who could not have been more than twenty at  the time, for Rousseau died in the summer of 1778, is said to have gone  on a reverential pilgrimage in search of an oracle from the lonely sage,  as Boswell and as Gibbon and a hundred others had gone before him.  Rousseau was wont to use his real adorers as ill as he used his  imaginary enemies. Robespierre may well have shared the discouragement  of the enthusiastic father who informed Rousseau that he was about to  bring up his son on the principles of _Emilius_. 'Then so much the  worse,' cried the perverse philosopher, 'both for you and your son.' If  he had been endowed with second sight, he would have thought at least as  rude a presage due to this last and most ill-starred of a whole  generation of neophytes.    In 1781 Robespierre returned to Arras, and amid the welcome of his  relatives and the good hopes of friends began the practice of an  advocate. For eight years he led an active and seemly life. He was not  wholly pure from that indiscretion of the young appetite, about which  the world is mute, but whose better ordering and governance would give a  diviner brightness to the earth. Still, if he did not escape the ordeal  of youth, Robespierre was frugal, laborious, and persevering. His  domestic amiability made him the delight of his sister, and his zealous  self-sacrifice for the education and advancement in life of his younger  brother was afterwards repaid by Augustin Robespierre's devotion through  all the fierce and horrible hours of Thermidor. Though cold in  temperament, extremely reserved in manners, and fond of industrious  seclusion, Robespierre did not disdain the social diversions of the  town. He was a member of a reunion of Rosati, who sang madrigals and  admired one another's bad verses. Those who love the ironical surprises  of fate, may picture the young man who was doomed to play so terrible a  part in terrible affairs, going through the harmless follies of a  ceremonial reception by the Rosati, taking three deep breaths over a  rose, solemnly fastening the emblem to his coat, emptying a glass of  rose-red wine at a draught to the good health of the company, and  finally reciting couplets that Voltaire would have found almost as  detestable as the Law of Prairial or the Festival of the Supreme Being.  More laudable efforts of ambition were prize essays, in which  Robespierre has the merit of taking the right side in important  questions. He protested against the inhumanity of laws that inflicted  civil infamy upon the innocent family of a convicted criminal. And he  protested against the still more horrid cruelty which reduced  unfortunate children born out of wedlock to something like the status of  the mediaeval serf. Robespierre's compositions at this time do not rise  above the ordinary level of declaiming mediocrity, but they promised a  manhood of benignity and enlightenment. To compose prize essays on  political reforms was better than to ignore or to oppose political  reform. But the course of events afterwards owed their least desirable  bias to the fact that such compositions were the nearest approach to  political training that so many of the revolutionary leaders underwent.  One is inclined to apply to practical politics Arthur Young's sensible  remark about the endeavour of the French to improve the quality of their  wool: 'A cultivator at the head of a sheep-farm of 3000 or 4000 acres,  would in a few years do more for their wools than all the academicians  and philosophers will effect in ten centuries.'    In his profession he distinguished himself in one or two causes of local  celebrity. An innovating citizen had been ordered by the authorities to  remove a lightning-conductor from his house within three days, as being  a mischievous practical paradox, as well as a danger and an annoyance to  his neighbours. Robespierre pleaded the innovator's case on appeal, and  won it. He defended a poor woman who had been wrongfully accused by a  monk belonging to the powerful corporation of a great neighbouring  abbey. The young advocate did not even shrink from manfully arguing a  case against the august Bishop of Arras himself. His independence did  him no harm. The Bishop afterwards appointed him to the post of judge or  legal assessor in the episcopal court. This tribunal was a remnant of  what had once been the sovereign authority and jurisdiction of the  Bishops of Arras. That a court with the power of life and death should  thus exist by the side of a proper corporation of civil magistrates, is  an illustration of the inextricable labyrinth of the French law and its  administration on the eve of the Revolution. Robespierre did not hold  his office long. Every one has heard the striking story, how the young  judge, whose name was within half a dozen years to take a place in the  popular mind of France and of Europe with the bloodiest monsters of myth  or history, resigned his post in a fit of remorse after condemning a  murderer to be executed. 'He is a criminal, no doubt,' Robespierre kept  groaning in reply to the consolations of his sister, for women are more  positive creatures than men: 'a criminal, no doubt; but to put a man to  death!' Many a man thus begins the great voyage with queasy  sensibilities, and ends it a cannibal.    Among Robespierre's associates in the festive mummeries of the Rosati  was a young officer of Engineers, who was destined to be his colleague  in the dread Committee of Public Safety, and to leave an important name  in French history. In the garrison of Arras, Carnot was quartered,--that  iron head, whose genius for the administrative organisation of war  achieved even greater things for the new republic than the genius of  Louvois had achieved for the old monarchy. Carnot surpassed not only  Louvois, but perhaps all other names save one in modern military  history, by uniting to the most powerful gifts for organisation, both  the strategic talent that planned the momentous campaign of 1794, and  the splendid personal energy and skill that prolonged the defence of  Antwerp against the allied army in 1814 Partisans dream of the  unrivalled future of peace, glory, and freedom that would have fallen to  the lot of France, if only the gods had brought about a hearty union  between the military genius of Carnot and the political genius of  Robespierre. So, no doubt, after the restoration of Charles II. in  England, there were good men who thought that all would have gone very"]]]
