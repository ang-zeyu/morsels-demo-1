The majority of the cuneiform documents,  on which he based his comparison, date from a period no earlier than the  seventh century B.C., and yet it was clear that the texts themselves,  in some form or other, must have descended from a remote antiquity. He  concluded his brief reference to the Creation and Deluge Tablets with  these words: \"The Babylonian narratives are both polytheistic, while  the corresponding biblical narratives (Gen. i and vi-xi) are made  the vehicle of a pure and exalted monotheism; but in spite of this  fundamental difference, and also variations in detail, the resemblances  are such as to leave no doubt that the Hebrew cosmogony and the Hebrew  story of the Deluge are both derived ultimately from the same original  as the Babylonian narratives, only transformed by the magic touch of  Israel's religion, and infused by it with a new spirit.\"(1) Among the  recently published documents from Nippur we have at last recovered one  at least of those primitive originals from which the Babylonian accounts  were derived, while others prove the existence of variant stories of the  world's origin and early history which have not survived in the later  cuneiform texts. In some of these early Sumerian records we may trace  a faint but remarkable parallel with the Hebrew traditions of man's  history between his Creation and the Flood. It will be our task, then,  to examine the relations which the Hebrew narratives bear both to the  early Sumerian and to the later Babylonian Versions, and to ascertain  how far the new discoveries support or modify current views with regard  to the contents of those early chapters of Genesis.         (1) Driver, _Modern Research as illustrating the Bible_ (The       Schweich Lectures, 1908), p. 23.    I need not remind you that Genesis is the book of Hebrew origins, and  that its contents mark it off to some extent from the other books of the  Hebrew Bible. The object of the Pentateuch and the Book of Joshua is to  describe in their origin the fundamental institutions of the national  faith and to trace from the earliest times the course of events which  led to the Hebrew settlement in Palestine. Of this national history  the Book of Genesis forms the introductory section. Four centuries of  complete silence lie between its close and the beginning of Exodus,  where we enter on the history of a nation as contrasted with that of  a family.(1) While Exodus and the succeeding books contain national  traditions, Genesis is largely made up of individual biography. Chapters  xii-l are concerned with the immediate ancestors of the Hebrew race,  beginning with Abram's migration into Canaan and closing with Joseph's  death in Egypt. But the aim of the book is not confined to recounting  the ancestry of Israel. It seeks also to show her relation to other  peoples in the world, and probing still deeper into the past it  describes how the earth itself was prepared for man's habitation.  Thus the patriarchal biographies are preceded, in chapters i-xi, by an  account of the original of the world, the beginnings of civilization,  and the distribution of the various races of mankind. It is, of course,  with certain parts of this first group of chapters that such striking  parallels have long been recognized in the cuneiform texts.         (1) Cf., e.g., Skinner, _A Critical and Exegetical       Commentary on Genesis_ (1912), p. ii f.; Driver, _The Book       of Genesis_, 10th ed. (1916), pp. 1 ff.; Ryle, _The Book of       Genesis_ (1914), pp. x ff.    In approaching this particular body of Hebrew traditions, the necessity  for some caution will be apparent. It is not as though we were dealing  with the reported beliefs of a Malayan or Central Australian tribe. In  such a case there would be no difficulty in applying a purely objective  criticism, without regard to ulterior consequences. But here our own  feelings are involved, having their roots deep in early associations.  The ground too is well trodden; and, had there been no new material to  discuss, I think I should have preferred a less contentious theme. The  new material is my justification for the choice of subject, and also the  fact that, whatever views we may hold, it will be necessary for us to  assimilate it to them. I shall have no hesitation in giving you my own  reading of the evidence; but at the same time it will be possible to  indicate solutions which will probably appeal to those who view the  subject from more conservative standpoints. That side of the discussion  may well be postponed until after the examination of the new evidence in  detail. And first of all it will be advisable to clear up some general  aspects of the problem, and to define the limits within which our  criticism may be applied.    It must be admitted that both Egypt and Babylon bear a bad name in  Hebrew tradition. Both are synonymous with captivity, the symbols of  suffering endured at the beginning and at the close of the national  life. And during the struggle against Assyrian aggression, the  disappointment at the failure of expected help is reflected in  prophecies of the period. These great crises in Hebrew history have  tended to obscure in the national memory the part which both Babylon  and Egypt may have played in moulding the civilization of the smaller  nations with whom they came in contact. To such influence the races of  Syria were, by geographical position, peculiarly subject. The country  has often been compared to a bridge between the two great continents of  Asia and Africa, flanked by the sea on one side and the desert on the  other, a narrow causeway of highland and coastal plain connecting the  valleys of the Nile and the Euphrates.(1) For, except on the frontier of  Egypt, desert and sea do not meet. Farther north the Arabian plateau is  separated from the Mediterranean by a double mountain chain, which runs  south from the Taurus at varying elevations, and encloses in its lower  course the remarkable depression of the Jordan Valley, the Dead Sea, and  the 'Arabah. The Judaean hills and the mountains of Moab are merely  the southward prolongation of the Lebanon and Anti-Lebanon, and their  neighbourhood to the sea endows this narrow tract of habitable country  with its moisture and fertility. It thus formed the natural channel of  intercourse between the two earliest centres of civilization, and was  later the battle-ground of their opposing empires.         (1) See G. A. Smith, _Historical Geography of the Holy       Land_, pp. 5 ff., 45 ff., and Myres, _Dawn of History_, pp.       137 ff.; and cf. Hogarth, _The Nearer East_, pp. 65 ff., and       Reclus, _Nouvelle Geographie universelle_, t. IX, pp. 685 ff.    The great trunk-roads of through communication run north and south,  across the eastern plateaus of the Hauran and Moab, and along the  coastal plains. The old highway from Egypt, which left the Delta at  Pelusium, at first follows the coast, then trends eastward across the  plain of Esdraelon, which breaks the coastal range, and passing under  Hermon runs northward through Damascus and reaches the Euphrates at its  most westerly point. Other through tracks in Palestine ran then as they  do to-day, by Beesheba and Hebron, or along the 'Arabah and west of the  Dead Sea, or through Edom and east of Jordan by the present Hajj route  to Damascus. But the great highway from Egypt, the most westerly of  the trunk-roads through Palestine, was that mainly followed, with some  variant sections, by both caravans and armies, and was known by the  Hebrews in its southern course as the \"Way of the Philistines\" and  farther north as the \"Way of the East\".    The plain of Esraelon, where the road first trends eastward, has been  the battle-ground for most invaders of Palestine from the north, and  though Egyptian armies often fought in the southern coastal plain, they  too have battled there when they held the southern country. Megiddo,  which commands the main pass into the plain through the low Samaritan  hills to the southeast of Carmel, was the site of Thothmes III's famous  battle against a Syrian confederation, and it inspired the writer of the  Apocalypse with his vision of an Armageddon of the future. But invading  armies always followed the beaten track of caravans, and movements  represented by the great campaigns were reflected in the daily passage  of international commerce.    With so much through traffic continually passing within her borders,  it may be matter for surprise that far more striking evidence of its  cultural effect should not have been revealed by archaeological research  in Palestine. Here again the explanation is mainly of a geographical  character. For though the plains and plateaus could be crossed by the  trunk-roads, the rest of the country is so broken up by mountain and  valley that it presented few facilities either to foreign penetration  or to external control. The physical barriers to local intercourse,  reinforced by striking differences in soil, altitude, and climate,  while they precluded Syria herself from attaining national unity, always  tended to protect her separate provinces, or \"kingdoms,\" from the  full effects of foreign aggression. One city-state could be traversed,  devastated, or annexed, without in the least degree affecting  neighbouring areas. It is true that the population of Syria has always  been predominantly Semitic, for she was on the fringe of the great  breeding-ground of the Semitic race and her landward boundary was open  to the Arabian nomad. Indeed, in the whole course of her history the  only race that bade fair at one time to oust the Semite in Syria was the  Greek. But the Greeks remained within the cities which they founded or  rebuilt, and, as Robertson Smith pointed out, the death-rate in Eastern  cities habitually exceeds the birth-rate; the urban population must be  reinforced from the country if it is to be maintained,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20300"],[0,"Henry VIII. (#2)"],[1,"of Henry's reign. It elucidates some  points hitherto obscure, but it raises a host of others never before  suggested. In ancient history we often accept statements written  hundreds of years after the event, simply because we know no better;  in modern history we frequently have half a dozen witnesses giving  inconsistent accounts of what they have seen with their own eyes.  Dogmatism is merely the result of ignorance; and no honest historian  will pretend to have mastered all the facts, accurately weighed all  the evidence, or pronounced a final judgment.    The present volume does not profess to do more than roughly sketch  Henry VIII.'s more prominent characteristics, outline the chief  features of his policy, and suggest some reasons for the measure of  success he attained. Episodes such as the divorce of Catherine of  Aragon, the dissolution of the monasteries, and the determination of  the relations between Church and State, would severally demand for  adequate treatment works of much greater bulk than the present. On the  divorce valuable light has recently been thrown by Dr. Stephan Ehses  in his _Roemische Dokumente_.[11] The dissolution of the monasteries  has been exhaustively treated from one point of view by Dr. Gasquet;[12]  but an adequate and impartial history of what is called the Reformation  still remains to be written. Here it is possible to deal with        (p. x)  these questions only in the briefest outline, and in so far as they  were affected by Henry's personal action. For my facts I have relied  entirely on contemporary records, and my deductions from these facts  are my own. I have depended as little as possible even on contemporary  historians,[13] and scarcely at all on later writers.[14] I have,  however, made frequent use of Dr. Gairdner's articles in the _Dictionary  of National Biography_, particularly of that on Henry VIII., the best  summary extant of his career; and I owe not a little to Bishop  Stubbs's two lectures on Henry VIII., which contain some fruitful  suggestions as to his character.[15]                                                    A.F.

(p. 001)    THE EARLY TUDORS.      In the whole range of English history there is no monarch whose  character has been more variously depicted by contemporaries or more  strenuously debated by posterity than the \"majestic lord who broke the  bonds of Rome\". To one historian an inhuman embodiment of cruelty and  vice, to another a superhuman incarnation of courage, wisdom and  strength of will, Henry VIII. has, by an almost universal consent,  been placed above or below the grade of humanity. So unique was his  personality, so singular his achievements, that he appears in the  light of a special dispensation sent like another Attila to be the  scourge of mankind, or like a second Hercules to cleanse, or at least  to demolish, Augean stables. The dictates of his will seemed as  inexorable as the decrees of fate, and the history of his reign is  strewn with records of the ruin of those who failed to placate his  wrath. Of the six queens he married, two he divorced, and two he  beheaded. Four English cardinals[16] lived in his reign; one perished  by the executioner's axe, one escaped it by absence, and a third   (p. 002)  by a timely but natural death. Of a similar number of dukes[17] half  were condemned by attainder; and the same method of speedy despatch  accounted for six or seven earls and viscounts and for scores of  lesser degree. He began his reign by executing the ministers of his  father,[18] he continued it by sending his own to the scaffold. The  Tower of London was both palace and prison, and statesmen passed  swiftly from one to the other; in silent obscurity alone lay  salvation. Religion and politics, rank and profession made little  difference; priest and layman, cardinal-archbishop and \"hammer of the  monks,\" men whom Henry had raised from the mire, and peers, over whose  heads they were placed, were joined in a common fate. Wolsey and More,  Cromwell and Norfolk, trod the same dizzy path to the same fatal end;  and the English people looked on powerless or unmoved. They sent their  burgesses and knights of the shire to Westminster without let or  hindrance, and Parliament met with a regularity that grew with the  rigour of Henry's rule; but it seemed to assemble only to register the  royal edicts and clothe with a legal cloak the naked violence of  Henry's acts. It remembered its privileges only to lay them at Henry's  feet, it cancelled his debts, endowed his proclamations with the force  of laws, and authorised him to repeal acts of attainder and dispose of  his crown at will. Secure of its support Henry turned and rent the  spiritual unity of Western Christendom, and settled at a blow that  perennial struggle between Church and State, in which kings and    (p. 003)  emperors had bitten the dust. With every epithet of contumely and  scorn he trampled under foot the jurisdiction of him who was believed  to hold the keys of heaven and hell. Borrowing in practice the old  maxim of Roman law, _cujus regio, ejus religio_,[19] he placed himself  in the seat of authority in religion and presumed to define the faith  of which Leo had styled him defender. Others have made themselves  despots by their mastery of many legions, through the agency of a  secret police, or by means of an organised bureaucracy. Yet Henry's  standing army consisted of a few gentlemen pensioners and yeomen of  the guard; he had neither secret police nor organised bureaucracy.  Even then Englishmen boasted that they were not slaves like the  French,[20] and foreigners pointed a finger of scorn at their turbulence.  Had they not permanently or temporarily deprived of power nearly half  their kings who had reigned since William the Conqueror? Yet Henry  VIII. not only left them their arms, but repeatedly urged them to keep  those arms ready for use.[21] He eschewed that air of mystery with  which tyrants have usually sought to impose on the mind of the people.  All his life he moved familiarly and almost unguarded in the midst of  his subjects, and he died in his bed, full of years, with the spell of  his power unbroken and the terror of his name unimpaired.                       [Footnote 16: Bainbridge, Wolsey, Fisher, Pole.                     Bainbridge was a cardinal after Julius II's own                     heart, and he received the red hat for military                     services rendered to that warlike Pope (_Ven.
