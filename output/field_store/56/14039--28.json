A big chair was drawn up in front of the window, and a  big book was open on a table in front of the chair. A great pack half  made up was on the floor, and Santa Claus stopped to add a few things  from his pocket. Then he went to the kitchen, and brought me a lunch of  milk and strawberries and cookies, for he said I must be tired after my  long walk.    \"After I had rested a little while, he said if I liked I might go with  him to the observatory. But just as we were starting a funny little  fellow stopped at the door with a wheelbarrow full of boxes of dishes.  After Santa Claus had taken the boxes out and put them in the pack he  said slowly,--    \"'Let me see!'    \"He laid his finger beside his nose as he said it, and looked at me  attentively, as if I were a sum in addition, and he was adding me up. I  guess I must have come out right, for he looked satisfied, and said I'd  better go to the mine first, and then join him in the observatory. Now I  am afraid he was not exactly polite not to go with me himself,\" added  Lill, gravely, \"but then he apologized by saying he had some work to do.  So I followed the little fellow with the wheelbarrow, and we soon came  to what looked like the entrance of a cave, but I suppose it was the  mine. I followed my guide to the interior without stopping to look at  the boxes and piles of dishes outside. Here I found other funny little  people, busily at work with picks and shovels, taking out wooden dishes  from the bottom of the cave, and china and glass from the top and sides,  for the dishes hung down just like stalactites in Mammoth Cave.\"    Here Lill opened the book she had been reading, and showed Effie a  picture of the stalactites.    \"It was so curious and so pretty that I should have remained longer,\"  said Lill, \"only I remembered the observatory and Santa Claus.    \"When I went outside I heard his voice calling out, 'Lilian! Lilian!' It  sounded a great way off, and yet somehow it seemed to fill the air just  as the wind does. I only had to look for a moment, for very near by was  a high tower. I wonder I did not see it before; but in these queer  countries you are sure to see something new every time you look about.  Santa Claus was standing up at a window near the top, and I ran to the  entrance and commenced climbing the stairs. It was a long journey, and I  was quite out of breath when I came to the end of it. But here there was  such a cozy, luxurious little room, full of stuffed chairs and lounges,  bird cages and flowers in the windows, and pictures on the wall, that it  was delightful to rest. There was a lady sitting by a golden desk,  writing in a large book, and Santa Claus was looking through a great  telescope, and every once in a while he stopped and put his ear to a  large speaking-tube. While I was resting he went on with his  observations.    \"Presently he said to the lady, 'Put down a good mark for Sarah  Buttermilk. I see she is trying to conquer her quick temper.'    \"'Two bad ones for Isaac Clappertongue; he'll drive his mother to the  insane asylum yet.'    \"'Bad ones all around for the Crossley children,--they quarrel too  much.'    \"'A good one for Harry and Alice Pleasure, they are quick to mind.'    \"'And give Ruth Olive ten, for she is a peacemaker.'\"    Just then he happened to look at me and saw I was rested, so he politely  asked what I thought of the country. I said it was magnificent. He said  he was sorry I didn't stop in the green-house, where he had wax dolls  and other delicate things growing. I was very sorry about that, and then  I said I thought he must be very happy to own so many delightful things.    \"'Of course I'm happy,' said Santa Claus, and then he sighed. 'But it is  an awful responsibility to reward so many children according to their  deserts. For I take these observations every day, and I know who is good  and who is bad.'    \"I was glad he told me about this, and now, if he would only tell me  what time of day he took the observations, I would have obtained really  valuable information. So I stood up and made my best courtesy and  said,--    \"'Please, sir, would you tell me what time of day you usually look?'    \"'O,' he answered, carelessly, 'any time from seven in the morning till  ten at night. I am not a bit particular about time. I often go without  my own meals in order to make a record of table manners. For instance:  last evening I saw you turn your spoon over in your mouth, and that's  very unmannerly for a girl nearly fourteen.'    \"'O, I didn't know _you_ were looking,' said I, very much ashamed; 'and  I'll never do it again,' I promised.    \"Then he said I might look through the telescope, and I looked right  down into our house. There was mother very busy and very tired, and all  of the children teasing. It was queer, for I was there, too, and the  _bad-est_ of any. Pretty soon I ran to a quiet corner with a book, and  in a few minutes mamma had to leave her work and call, 'Lilian,  Lilian, it's time for you to practise.'    \"'Yes, mamma,' I answered, 'I'll come right away.'    \"As soon as I said this Santa Claus whistled for 'Comet' and 'Cupid,'  and they came tearing up the tower. He put me in a tiny sleigh, and away  we went, over great snow-banks of clouds, and before I had time to think  I was landed in the big chair, and mamma was calling 'Lilian, Lilian,  it's time for you to practise,' just as she is doing now, and I must  go.\"    So Lill answered, \"Yes, mamma,\" and ran to the piano.    Effie sank back in the chair to think. She wished Lill had found out how  many black marks she had, and whether that lady was Mrs. Santa  Claus--and had, in fact, obtained more accurate information about many  things.    But when she asked about some of them afterwards, Lill said she didn't  know, for the next time she had traveled in that direction she found  Santa Claus Land had moved.          WHAT HAPPENED TO KATHIE AND LU.      It was a very great misfortune, and it must have been a sad affliction  to the friends of the two children, for both were once pretty and  charming.    It came about in this way.    Little Winnie Tennyson--she wasn't the daughter of Mr. Alfred Tennyson,  the poet-laureate of England, but _was_ as sweet as any one of that  gentleman's poems--had been to the city; and she had brought home so  many wondrous improvements that her two little bosom friends, Lu Medway  and Kathie Dysart, were almost struck dumb to behold and to hear what  Winnie said and what Winnie had.    For one thing, there were some wooden blocks, all fluted and grooved,  and Winnie could heat these blocks in the oven, and wet her hair, and  lay it between them, and O! how satin-smooth the waves would  be,--hair-pin-crimps and braid-crimps were nothing to this new and  scientific way.    Winnie also made it a matter of pride to display her overskirts. These  were arranged with ever so many tapes on the inside, and would readily  tie up into the most ravishing bunches and puffs--how Lu and Kathie,  wee-est mites of women though they were, did envy Winnie her tapes!  Their mammas didn't know how to loop a dress--witness their little  skirts pinned back into what Kathie called a \"wopse.\"    She also had brought some tiny parlor skates, and, withal, many airs and  graces which her two young-lady aunties had taught her, among others a  funny little new accent on some of her words,--the word \"pretty\" in  particular. And, last of all, she had been taught to dance!    \"And I can show _you_,\" Winnie said, eagerly, \"'cause it goes by  'steps,' and uncle says I take them as pr-i-tty as Cousin Lily.\"    Now, in Connaut, little girls don't dance--not _nice_ little girls, nor  nice big girls either, for that matter.    The dimpled mouths opened in astonishment. \"That is wicked, Winnie  Ten'son, don't you know?\"    \"O, but 'tisn't,\" said Winnie. \"My aunties dance, and their mamma, my  grandmamma, was at the party once.\"    \"We shall tell our mothers,\" said Lu. \"I'll bet you've come home a  proud, wicked girl, and you want us to be as bad as you are.\"    [Illustration: \"Winnie already had her class before her.\"]    Now Winnie was only six years old, about the same age as her virtuous  friends, and she didn't look very wicked. She had pink cheeks, and blue  eyes, and dimples. She stood gazing at her accusers, first at one and  then at the other.    \"Luie,\" said Kathie, gravely, \"we mustn't call Winnie wicked till we ask  our mothers if she is.\"    \"No, I don't think I would,\" said Mrs. Tennyson, looking up from her  sewing, her cheek flushing at the sight of tears in her little Winnie's  gentle eyes.    On the way home, they chanced to see their own minister walking along.  Lu stopped short. \"Kathie,\" said she, \"I know it's awful wicked now, or  else we never should have met the minister right here. I'm just going to  tell him about Winnie.\"    She went up to him, Kathie following shyly.    \"Mr. Goodhue, Winnie Ten'son is a nawful wicked girl!\"    \"She _is!_\" said Mr. Goodhue, stopping, and looking down into the little  eager face.    \"Yes, sir, she is. She wants us to dance!\"    \"She _does!_\"    \"Yes, sir, she does. She wanted us to learn the steps, right down in her  garden this afternoon. Would you dance, Mr. Goodhue?\"    \"Would I? Perhaps I might, were I as little and spry as you, and Winnie  would teach me steps, and it was down in the garden.\"    The little girls looked up into his face searchingly. He walked on  laughing, and they went on homeward, to ask further advice.    At home, too, everyone seemed to think it a matter for smiles, and  laughed at the two tender little consciences.    So they both ran back after dinner to Mrs. Tennyson's. But on the way  Kathie said, \"They let us, the minister and ev'ry body, but if it is  wicked _ever_, how isn't it wicked _now_?\"    \"I s'pose 'cause we're children,\" Lu said wisely.    The logical trouble thus laid, they tripped on.
