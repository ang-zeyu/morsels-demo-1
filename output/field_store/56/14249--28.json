[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2400"],[0,"Vikram and the Vampire: Classic Hindu Tales of Adventure, Magic, and Romance (#2)"],[1,"a-Sena is a quasi-historical personage, who lived in the century  preceding the Christian era. The story had, therefore, ample time to  reach the ears of the learned African Apuleius, who was born A.D. 130.    The Baital-Pachisi, or Twenty-five (tales of a) Baital[5]--a Vampire or  evil spirit which animates dead bodies--is an old and thoroughly Hindu  repertory. It is the rude beginning of that fictitious history which  ripened to the Arabian Nights' Entertainments, and which, fostered by  the genius of Boccaccio, produced the romance of the chivalrous days,  and its last development, the novel--that prose-epic of modern Europe.    Composed in Sanskrit, \"the language of the gods,\" alias the Latin of  India, it has been translated into all the Prakrit or vernacular and  modern dialects of the great peninsula. The reason why it has not found  favour with the Moslems is doubtless the highly polytheistic spirit  which pervades it; moreover, the Faithful had already a specimen of that  style of composition. This was the Hitopadesa, or Advice of a Friend,  which, as a line in its introduction informs us, was borrowed from an  older book, the Panchatantra, or Five Chapters. It is a collection of  apologues recited by a learned Brahman, Vishnu Sharma by name, for the  edification of his pupils, the sons of an Indian Raja. They have been  adapted to or translated into a number of languages, notably into Pehlvi  and Persian, Syriac and Turkish, Greek and Latin, Hebrew and Arabic. And  as the Fables of Pilpay,[6] are generally known, by name at least, to  European litterateurs.. Voltaire remarks,[7] \"Quand on fait reflexion  que presque toute la terre a ete infatuee de pareils comes, et qu'ils  ont fait l'education du genre humain, on trouve les fables de Pilpay,  Lokman, d'Esope bien raisonnables.\" These tales, detached, but strung  together by artificial means--pearls with a thread drawn through  them--are manifest precursors of the Decamerone, or Ten Days. A modern  Italian critic describes the now classical fiction as a collection of  one hundred of those novels which Boccaccio is believed to have read out  at the court of Queen Joanna of Naples, and which later in life were by  him assorted together by a most simple and ingenious contrivance. But  the great Florentine invented neither his stories nor his \"plot,\" if  we may so call it. He wrote in the middle of the fourteenth century  (1344-8) when the West had borrowed many things from the East, rhymes[8]  and romance, lutes and drums, alchemy and knight-errantry. Many of the  \"Novelle\" are, as Orientalists well know, to this day sung and recited  almost textually by the wandering tale-tellers, bards, and rhapsodists  of Persia and Central Asia.    The great kshatriya,(soldier) king Vikramaditya,[9] or Vikramarka,  meaning the \"Sun of Heroism,\" plays in India the part of King Arthur,  and of Harun al-Rashid further West. He is a semi-historical personage.  The son of Gandharba-Sena the donkey and the daughter of the King of  Dhara, he was promised by his father the strength of a thousand male  elephants. When his sire died, his grandfather, the deity Indra,  resolved that the babe should not be born, upon which his mother stabbed  herself. But the tragic event duly happening during the ninth month,  Vikram came into the world by himself, and was carried to Indra, who  pitied and adopted him, and gave him a good education.    The circumstances of his accession to the throne, as will presently  appear, are differently told. Once, however, made King of Malaya, the  modern Malwa, a province of Western Upper India, he so distinguished  himself that the Hindu fabulists, with their usual brave kind of  speaking, have made him \"bring the whole earth under the shadow of one  umbrella.\"    The last ruler of the race of Mayura, which reigned 318 years, was  Raja-pal. He reigned 25 years, but giving himself up to effeminacy, his  country was invaded by Shakaditya, a king from the highlands of Kumaon.  Vikramaditya, in the fourteenth year of his reign, pretended to espouse  the cause of Raja-pal, attacked and destroyed Shakaditya, and ascended  the throne of Delhi. His capital was Avanti, or Ujjayani, the modern  Ujjain. It was 13 kos (26 miles) long by 18 miles wide, an area of 468  square miles, but a trifle in Indian History. He obtained the title of  Shakari, \"foe of the Shakas,\" the Sacae or Scythians, by his victories  over that redoubtable race. In the Kali Yug, or Iron Age, he stands  highest amongst the Hindu kings as the patron of learning. Nine persons  under his patronage, popularly known as the \"Nine Gems of Science,\" hold  in India the honourable position of the Seven Wise Men of Greece.    These learned persons wrote works in the eighteen original dialects  from which, say the Hindus, all the languages of the earth have been  derived.[10] Dhanwantari enlightened the world upon the subjects of  medicine and of incantations. Kshapanaka treated the primary elements.  Amara-Singha compiled a Sanskrit dictionary and a philosophical  treatise. Shankubetalabhatta composed comments, and Ghatakarpara a  poetical work of no great merit. The books of Mihira are not mentioned.  Varaha produced two works on astrology and one on arithmetic. And  Bararuchi introduced certain improvements in grammar, commented upon the  incantations, and wrote a poem in praise of King Madhava.    But the most celebrated of all the patronized ones was Kalidasa. His two  dramas, Sakuntala,[11] and Vikram and Urvasi,[12] have descended to  our day; besides which he produced a poem on the seasons, a work on  astronomy, a poetical history of the gods, and many other books.[13]    Vikramaditya established the Sambat era, dating from A.C. 56. After  a long, happy, and glorious reign, he lost his life in a war with  Shalivahana, King of Pratisthana. That monarch also left behind him an  era called the \"Shaka,\" beginning with A.D. 78. It is employed, even  now, by the Hindus in recording their births, marriages, and similar  occasions.    King Vikramaditya was succeeded by his infant son Vikrama-Sena, and  father and son reigned over a period of 93 years. At last the latter was  supplanted by a devotee named Samudra-pala, who entered into his body  by miraculous means. The usurper reigned 24 years and 2 months, and the  throne of Delhi continued in the hands of his sixteen successors, who  reigned 641 years and 3 months. Vikrama-pala, the last, was slain in  battle by Tilaka-chandra, King of Vaharannah[14].    It is not pretended that the words of these Hindu tales are preserved  to the letter. The question about the metamorphosis of cats into tigers,  for instance, proceeded from a Gem of Learning in a university much  nearer home than Gaur. Similarly the learned and still living Mgr. Gaume  (Traite du Saint-Esprit, p.. 81) joins Camerarius in the belief that  serpents bite women rather than men. And he quotes (p.. 192) Cornelius a  Lapide, who informs us that the leopard is the produce of a lioness with  a hyena or a bard..    The merit of the old stories lies in their suggestiveness and in their  general applicability. I have ventured to remedy the conciseness of  their language, and to clothe the skeleton with flesh and blood.                    To My Uncle,           ROBERT BAGSHAW, OF DOVERCOURT,                    These Tales,      That Will Remind Him Of A Land Which               He Knows So Well,         Are Affectionately Inscribed.          INTRODUCTION    The sage Bhavabhuti--Eastern teller of these tales--after making his  initiatory and propitiatory conge to Ganesha, Lord of Incepts, informs  the reader that this book is a string of fine pearls to be hung round  the neck of human intelligence; a fragrant flower to be borne on the  turband of mental wisdom; a jewel of pure gold, which becomes the brow  of all supreme minds; and a handful of powdered rubies, whose tonic  effects will appear palpably upon the mental digestion of every patient.  Finally, that by aid of the lessons inculcated in the following pages,  man will pass happily through this world into the state of absorption,  where fables will be no longer required.    He then teaches us how Vikramaditya the Brave became King of Ujjayani.    Some nineteen centuries ago, the renowned city of Ujjayani witnessed the  birth of a prince to whom was given the gigantic name Vikramaditya.  Even the Sanskrit-speaking people, who are not usually pressed for time,  shortened it to \"Vikram\", and a little further West it would infallibly  have been docked down to \"Vik\".    Vikram was the second son of an old king Gandharba-Sena, concerning whom  little favourable has reached posterity, except that he became an ass,  married four queens, and had by them six sons, each of whom was more  learned and powerful than the other. It so happened that in course of  time the father died. Thereupon his eldest heir, who was known as Shank,  succeeded to the carpet of Rajaship, and was instantly murdered by  Vikram, his \"scorpion\", the hero of the following pages.[15]    By this act of vigour and manly decision, which all younger-brother  princes should devoutly imitate, Vikram having obtained the title of  Bir, or the Brave, made himself Raja. He began to rule well, and the  gods so favoured him that day by day his dominions increased. At  length he became lord of all India, and having firmly established his  government, he instituted an era--an uncommon feat for a mere monarch,  especially when hereditary.    The steps,[16] says the historian, which he took to arrive at that  pinnacle of grandeur, were these:    The old King calling his two grandsons Bhartari-hari and Vikramaditya,  gave them good counsel respecting their future learning. They were told  to master everything, a certain way not to succeed in anything. They  were diligently to learn grammar, the Scriptures, and all the  religious sciences. They were to become familiar with military  tactics, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24001"],[0,"The Physical Life of Woman: Advice to the Maiden, Wife and Mother (#2)"],[1," may desire to consult some of the original  authorities upon whom the author has drawn. And here he would ask from  his fellow-members of the medical profession their countenance and  assistance in his attempt to distribute sound information of this  character among the people. None but physicians can know what sad  consequences are constantly occurring from the want of it. * * *          BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH OF GEORGE HENRY NAPHEYS, M.D.      Were man's life measured by his deeds, as the poet suggests, how brief  would be the long years of many an octogenarian, and how extended the  short span which has been allotted to not a few of the world's famous  heroes!    This oft-repeated thought strikes us forcibly in considering the  biography of the subject of this sketch. Closing his life at an age when  most professional men are but beginning theirs, he had already studied  broadly, had traveled widely over two continents, had gained credit and  fame by the sword and the pen, and had amassed a fund of erudition and  experience which the more lethargic lives of most men fail to approach  after twice his length of days. It is eminently appropriate that a  record of his busy career should be attached to the works on which his  celebrity is chiefly bound, and in which he most conspicuously displays  that command of language and happy facility of imparting instruction  for which he was so remarkable.    GEORGE HENRY NAPHEYS (pronounced N[=a]'feez, the [=a] as in _fate_) was  born in the city of Philadelphia, March 5th, 1842. His parents died  while he was still at a tender age, and he was placed with some  relatives who resided in the city. From early years he was characterized  by quick perceptions and a retentive memory. In the Philadelphia High  School, from which he received the academic degree of Master of Arts, he  was considered the best scholar in his class, a marked distinction in  view of the large numbers which attend that institution. Besides  acquiring the usual studies of the High School, he gave considerable  time to phonography, in which he became so skilled that he could report  any ordinary speaker with entire accuracy. This subsequently proved a  great advantage to him in his medical career.    After his graduation he repaired to Hartford, Conn., where he was  offered and accepted the position of private secretary to a gentleman of  prominence in the literary and religious world.    Thus he was engaged when the civil war broke out. With his natural  warmth of feeling and strong emotions, he entered the fray among the  first, and went out as Lieutenant, and subsequently as Captain, Company  F, 10th Connecticut State Volunteers. The regiment was enlisted for nine  months, and was dispatched to Louisiana, General Banks then commanding  the Department. It participated in engagements near Baton Rouge and on  the Red River, in which Captain Napheys always acquitted himself with  bravery and credit.    At the time the regiment was disbanded, an early preference for medical  subjects led him to devote a year to the preliminary studies of that  profession, but not waiting the full period required for a degree, he  was appointed assistant medical officer on the U. S. steamer Mingo, of  the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron. On her he passed a number of  months, cruising off the coast of the Carolinas and Georgia, and  ascended the St. John river.    These active duties prevented him from receiving his degree of Doctor of  Medicine until after the close of the war, when, in 1866, his diploma  was conferred upon him by the Jefferson Medical College of Philadelphia,  one of the most renowned institutions of our country.    After graduation, he opened an office in Philadelphia, and connected  himself with the clinics which are held at the College for the purpose  of supplying medicine and medical advice to the poor gratuitously, as  well as for giving students an opportunity of witnessing various forms  of disease. The practical experience he gained in this manner was  considerable, and his natural ability soon recommended him to the  authorities of the institution, who appointed him Chief of Medical  Clinic of the College, a position he held for several years.    One of the advantages of this post was that it brought him into constant  communion with many eminent medical men, and rendered him practically  acquainted with their treatment of disease. His skill in phonography  enabled him to take abundant notes of their lectures, and this led to  his early connection with the periodical literature of the profession.  Most of the reports he drew up were published in the _Medical and  Surgical Reporter_, a weekly journal, devoted to medical science,  published in Philadelphia. The series of reports commenced in April,  1866, and continued, with slight interruptions, until June, 1870. They  are characterized by a clear and correct style, and a manifestly  thorough grasp of the numerous topics treated.    The success which these ephemeral writings obtained turned his thoughts  in the direction of authorship. His tastes and associations led him to  employ his powers in two directions: first, in preparing for the general  public a series of works which would acquaint them with anatomy,  physiology, hygiene, sanitary science, nursing, and the management of  disease, to the extent that intelligent general readers can and ought to  know about these subjects; and secondly, in writing for professional men  several treatises on the means of alleviating and curing diseases.    In the prosecution of the first mentioned of these plans, he was early  impressed with the utter absence of any treatise on the hygiene of the  sexual life in either sex, written in the proper spirit by a scientific  man. The field had been left to quacks or worse, who, to serve their  own base ends, scattered inflammatory and often indecent pamphlets over  the land; or else, had one or more of the points been handled by  reputable writers, it was in such a vague and imperfect manner that the  reader gained little benefit from the perusal. While all agreed that a  sound treatise on these topics was most desirable, it had been openly  averred that it could not be written in a proper style for the general  public.    Strong in the conviction that pure motives, literary tact, and the  requisite scientific knowledge qualified him to undertake this difficult  task, Dr. Napheys prepared, in the early months of 1869, his work on  \"The Physical Life of Woman.\" Proceeding with caution, he first  submitted the MSS. to some professional friends, and profited by their  suggestions. After the work was in type, and before publication, he sent  complete copies to a number of gentlemen, eminent as medical teachers,  clergymen, educators, and literateurs. Their replies left him in no  doubt but that he had succeeded even beyond his anticipations. Almost  unanimously the opinions were complimentary in the highest degree, and  evidently written after a close examination of the book. As many of  these have been printed to accompany the work, in the last and previous  editions, it is needless to do more in this connection than to say that  they were penned by such judges as Dr. W. A. Hammond, late  Surgeon-General U. S. Army; Dr. Harvey L. Byrd, Professor in the Medical  Department of Washington University, Md.; Dr. Edwin M. Snow, Health  Officer of the City of Providence, R. I.; Rev. Henry Ward Beecher, Rev.  Horace Bushnell, D.D., Rev. George A. Crooke, D.D., D.C.L., and others.    On its appearance, the work was received with enthusiasm by both the  medical press and the public. While a few journals and individuals were  inclined to condemn it and censure the author, the intelligent and the  pure-minded, on all sides, recognized in him the only writer who had yet  appeared able to treat these delicate subjects with the dignity of  science and the straightforwardness necessary for popular instruction.    Satisfied that he had chosen the proper exercise for his talents, he  composed and placed in the hands of his publisher, the following year,  his not less extraordinary work, \"The Transmission of Life,\" a treatise  addressed to the male, as his previous one had been to the female sex.  It was dedicated to the late Rev. John Todd, so well known for his  interest in young men, and his \"Student's Manual\" and other works  addressed to them. He accepted the dedication and addressed the author a  letter, in which occurs the following high compliment to his work: \"I am  surprised at the extent and accuracy of your reading; the judiciousness  of your positions and results; the clear, unequivocal, yet delicate and  appropriate language used; and the amount of valuable information  conveyed.\" Similar expressions poured in from many other distinguished  critics, as, for instance, Dr. Noah Porter, President of Yale College;  the Rev. Henry Clay Trumbull, the Rev. Abner Jackson, President of  Trinity College, Hartford, etc.    In the same year (1870) he brought out the first edition of his \"Modern  Therapeutics,\" a technical work, addressed to physicians. This was  enlarged in successive editions, until in its present form, as continued  by other hands in its latest editions, it comprises two parts of 600  pages each. Although the author claimed little other originality in this  work than the selection and arrangement of known facts, yet in these  respects he displayed the strongly practical and original turn of his  mind. As a student of the art of Therapeutics in large hospitals,  clinics, and dispensaries, he had convinced himself that it is not by  experiments on lower animals, nor yet on the human body in health, that  the physician can attain the glorious power of alleviating pain and  curing disease; it is only through the daily combat with sickness, by  the bedside and in the consulting room. Chemistry and physiology, he  believed, could teach but little in this branch;"]]]
