[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23533"],[0,"A War-time Journal, Germany 1914 and German Travel Notes (#2)"],[1,"the  notices: \"English spoken here\" have disappeared.    There is a mania about spies in Frankfort, we hear, and some Americans  yesterday were very roughly handled because their motor bore a French  maker's name. The Americans have returned to Altheim, and their motor  has been taken to fight for the Fatherland! Our situation is dreadful,  but we are keeping up brave hearts. Every day a fresh \"Bekanntmachung\"  (notice) appears; that of to-day was addressed to the children and  called upon them to gather in the harvest, the workers having gone as  soldiers and turned their \"pruning hooks\" into swords. My postcards  written in German have all come back. One cannot communicate with  anyone outside Altheim. What a position! God in His mercy help us! It  seems so strange to see German troops marching to the tune of \"God  Save the King,\" yet it is Germany's National Anthem too, and these are  the words they sing to it:--        \"Heil Dir im Sieger Kranz,      Herrscher des Vaterlands,      Heil Kaiser Dir!\" etc.    [Illustration: IN KANADA  (_Behold the German idea of a Canadian_)]    A \"Warnung\" has now been affixed to trees in the Avenue forbidding  Russians, English, French or Belgians to go within 100 metres of the  station. The Russians are being hardly used, but so far Germans are  quite nice to us. Mrs. N---- tells me a gruesome tale of a Russian  lady who left her hotel for Russia smiling, well dressed, and happy.  At Giessen all Russians were turned out of the train and put into a  waiting-room, and locked up there without any convenience of food,  drink, or beds for the night. The following morning they were told to  come out and soldiers marched them several miles into the country to a  farm-house. Some of the poor creatures were faint from want of food,  and others had heart disease, and fell exhausted in the road, the  soldiers prodding them with their bayonets to make them get up! After  several hours' detention there, they were brought back to Altheim,  where the poor lady arrived a pitiable wreck! What an experience! I  have been packed up for days!    _August 8th._--I went into the Park Strasse this morning to buy a  \"Frankfurter Zeitung.\" Outside the shop where I bought it some  American women stood gazing at a map of the war, and one said: \"I am  _disgusted_ with England, just disgusted. So degrading of her to help  a country like Russia, and side with assassins, just degrading! All we  Americans despise her now.\" I thought to myself: \"If I go to prison  for it, I will not allow anyone to call my country 'degraded and  disgusting.'\" So I said, trembling with wrath, \"There is nothing  'degrading' in being honourable, nor despicable in keeping true to  your word. England promised to protect Belgium's frontier, and she is  bound to do it.\"    Several Germans were gathered round the map, and they scowled at me  until I faced them calmly and said: \"Jeder man fuer sein Land\" (Every  man for his country), and they answered quite civilly: \"Gewiss!\"  (Certainly). The Americans in Altheim, I found afterwards, were  chiefly of German extraction, which accounted for the woman's  behaviour.    Early this morning three men arrived to search my room for weapons. I  was in bed, but they pushed past the maid Kaethchen, forced their way  in, pried into every corner, and departed. Emile the housemaid here  has _four_ brothers at the war. Dreadful rumours are flying about as  to our destination. One day we hear we are to go to Denmark, another  to Holland. Sometimes we are told that we shall not be allowed to  leave Germany until the war is over; again that we shall be sent away  at a moment's notice; that we shall be left at the frontier, and have  to walk for six hours, and carry our own luggage, etc.    The German papers are perfectly horrible in their violent abuse of  England, and we are so miserably anxious, not about ourselves, but  about our dear, dear country, and how she is faring. Kaethchen said  this morning, \"Die deutschen in Ausland sind sehr schlecht behandelt\"  (Germans abroad are very badly treated). \"See how well the foreigners  are treated _here_,\" by way of impressing upon me how thankful I ought  to be for my mercies.    _August 9th._--No papers! No news! No letters! No money! All of us are  more or less packed up ready to start. We are warned that no heavy  luggage can go with us, and are limited to two small \"hand Gepaeck,\"  which we can carry ourselves. I have presented my best hats to  Kaethchen, and it consoles me to think how comical she will look under  them!--but \"flying canvas\" is the order of the day.    _August 10th._--The \"Frankfurter Zeitung\" calls England \"ehrlos\"  (dishonourable), and the Belgian frontier question \"only an excuse,\"  and even kind, good Dr. G---- raged against England. One is sick with  longing to hear how the war gets on from the English point of view.  The papers here never allude to England's movements--only to her moral  delinquencies. I am so poverty-stricken now I wash my own  pocket-handkerchiefs, guimpes, and blouses!    The American part of our community have quite recovered their spirits  since money has come for them. The United States is making every  effort to rescue her people, and get them back in safety to America.  No one seems to concern themselves about us, and we can't get away  while mobilising is going on. All Germans show the greatest deference  to Americans, and call them \"our honoured guests.\" We, of course, are  the _dis_honoured ones, and in disgrace!    Altheim people so far are passably civil to us, but sometimes one has  a disagreeable person to deal with, as I had to-day at the Bad Haus.  The girl who stamps our tickets refused to pass mine until I could  show her my Kur Karte. I had none, and told her so, and asked her why  I should pay twenty marks for a card, when I could not get any of the  privileges to which it entitled me: the band, terrace, reading-room,  and so on. Her answer was a persistent dogged reiteration of \"Sie  muessen eine Kur Karte haben, sonst koennen Sie nicht baden,\" and not  having twenty marks in the world at present I had to come away without  my bath. Every day there are fresh appeals to the patriotism of the  people. They are pasted on walls, windows, and even trees.    _August 12th._--Such an amusing thing has happened. Mr. S---- said to  Dr. ----, \"We English have captured your Kronprinzessin Cecilie,\"  without saying that he meant the _ship_, and not the _lady_. As the  Government keeps all such disagreeable intelligence dark, it was news  to the doctor, and he stoutly contradicted it, and went round the town  afterwards telling people: \"Just think what liars the English are;  they say they have captured our Crown Princess!\" We learnt of this  prize-taking from the \"Corriere della Sera.\"    _August 13th._--The newspapers are full of German victories and abuse  of England. Also they declare that the most terrible atrocities have  taken place in Belgium, where women have despatched wounded Germans on  the field and shot doctors. The indignation is tremendous.    _August 14th._--Permission has at last been given for \"Fremden\"  (foreigners) to depart, and also the threats and restrictions as to  the railway station have been removed, but we must submit our  passports to the police, who send them to Berlin to be stamped by the  military authorities, and in about a week we shall be free. \"Gott sei  Dank!\"    _August 15th._--I went to the Polizei-Amt, a dreary little house, and  found both yard and staircase crammed with people. After waiting a  long time in the _queue_ I had to beat a retreat, the neighbourhood of  Polish Jews being too overpowering! In the afternoon I ventured again  with the same result. They say Holland is crammed with refugees, and  the hotels so full that people are sleeping on billiard tables even.  We are allowed to choose between Switzerland and Holland.    German papers express deepest disappointment that Italy has not been  \"ehrlich\" (honourable) to her \"Dreibund,\" and yet (extraordinary  people) the Germans blame us for being true to ours.    _August 16th._--I sent a telegram off to Ems this morning, of course  written in German, but the official behind the little window where I  handed it in refused to send it until I showed him my passport. As I  have not yet succeeded in getting through the crowds at the police  station I still had mine. We hear dreadful tales of hardships endured  by those who have managed to get away from other places. Some went by  the Rhine steamers, which are now running, but wherever they passed a  fortress they were made to go below. As the cabins were not enough for  all, preference was given to other nationalities, and English people  had to sit up all night on deck, even in pouring rain. The entire  absence of news is for us quite terrible. One feels so out of the  world, not knowing what is happening outside our prison doors. The  \"Frankfurter Zeitung\" is full of nothing but boasts and untruths. A  fresh \"Bekanntmachung\" has been posted up forbidding us to leave the  town, and ordering us to be indoors by nine o'clock.    _August 17th._--The Landsturm has been called out and leaves to-day  for the Front. These men are the last to be requisitioned, being  elderly.[1] After long waiting among Jews, Infidels, and Turks, I at  last got entrance to the Chief of Police's office, had my passport  taken, paid one mark fifty, and was told to come back on Thursday,  when it would be returned from Berlin. The Chief was a gruff,  disagreeable old man, who, to my amiable \"Guten Tag\" and \"Adieu\"  vouchsafed no reply.        [Footnote 1: This we were told at the time.]    _August 18th._--A dreadful blow! We English are forbidden to go to  Holland, and told that our destination is to be Denmark. Imagine  crossing that mined sea now! For reasons of their own German  authorities will not allow any of us to go by or near the Rhine.    _August 19th._--The German"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23545"],[0,"Songs of Childhood (#2)"],[1,"D,                                                 88  THE RAVEN'S TOMB,                                        90  THE CHRISTENING,                                         91  THE MOTHER BIRD,                                         93  THE CHILD IN THE STORY GOES TO BED,                      94  THE CHILD IN THE STORY AWAKES,                           96  THE LAMPLIGHTER,                                         98  CECIL,                                                  100  I MET AT EVE,                                           102  LULLABY                                                 104  ENVOY,                                                  106              THE GNOMIES          As I lay awake in the white moonlight,      I heard a sweet singing in the wood--            'Out of bed,            Sleepyhead,            Put your white foot now,            Here are we,            'Neath the tree,            Singing round the root now!'        I looked out of window in the white moonlight,      The trees were like snow in the wood--            'Come away            Child and play,            Light wi' the gnomies;            In a mound,            Green and round,            That's where their home is!            'Honey sweet,            Curds to eat,            Cream and frumenty,            Shells and beads,            Poppy seeds,            You shall have plenty.'        But soon as I stooped in the dim moonlight      To put on my stocking and my shoe,      The sweet, sweet singing died sadly away,      And the light of the morning peep'd through:      Then instead of the gnomies there came a red robin      To sing of the buttercups and dew.              BLUEBELLS          Where the bluebells and the wind are,      Fairies in a ring I spied,      And I heard a little linnet      Singing near beside.        Where the primrose and the dew are,      Soon were sped the fairies all:      Only now the green turf freshens,      And the linnets call.              LOVELOCKS          I watched the Lady Caroline      Bind up her dark and beauteous hair;      Her face was rosy in the glass,      And 'twixt the coils her hands would pass,          White in the candleshine.        Her bottles on the table lay,      Stoppered yet sweet of violet;      Her image in the mirror stooped      To view those locks as lightly looped          As cherry-boughs in May.        The snowy night lay dim without,      I heard the Waits their sweet song sing;      The window smouldered keen with frost;      Yet still she twisted, sleeked and tossed          Her beauteous hair about.              O DEAR ME!          Here are crocuses, white, gold, grey!        'O dear me!' says Marjorie May;      Flat as a platter the blackberry blows:        'O dear me!' says Madeleine Rose;      The leaves are fallen, the swallows flown:        'O dear me!' says Humphrey John;      Snow lies thick where all night it fell:        'O dear me!' says Emmanuel.              TARTARY          If I were Lord of Tartary,        Myself and me alone,      My bed should be of ivory,        Of beaten gold my throne;      And in my court should peacocks flaunt,      And in my forests tigers haunt,      And in my pools great fishes slant        Their fins athwart the sun.        If I were Lord of Tartary,        Trumpeters every day      To all my meals should summon me,        And in my courtyards bray;      And in the evenings lamps should shine,      Yellow as honey, red as wine,      While harp, and flute, and mandoline,        Made music sweet and gay.        If I were Lord of Tartary,        I'd wear a robe of beads,      White, and gold, and green they'd be--        And small, and thick as seeds;      And ere should wane the morning-star,      I'd don my robe and scimitar,      And zebras seven should draw my car        Through Tartary's dark glades.        Lord of the fruits of Tartary,        Her rivers silver-pale!      Lord of the hills of Tartary,        Glen, thicket, wood, and dale!      Her flashing stars, her scented breeze,      Her trembling lakes, like foamless seas,      Her bird-delighting citron-trees        In every purple vale!              THE BUCKLE          I had a silver buckle,      I sewed it on my shoe,      And 'neath a sprig of mistletoe      I danced the evening through!        I had a bunch of cowslips,      I hid 'em in a grot,      In case the elves should come by night      And me remember not.        I had a yellow riband,      I tied it in my hair,      That, walking in the garden,      The birds might see it there.        I had a secret laughter,      I laughed it near the wall:      Only the ivy and the wind      May tell of it at all.              THE HARE          In the black furrow of a field      I saw an old witch-hare this night;      And she cocked her lissome ear,      And she eyed the moon so bright,      And she nibbled o' the green;      And I whispered 'Whsst! witch-hare,'      Away like a ghostie o'er the field      She fled, and left the moonlight there.              BUNCHES OF GRAPES          'Bunches of grapes,' says Timothy;      'Pomegranates pink,' says Elaine;      'A junket of cream and a cranberry tart        For me,' says Jane.        'Love-in-a-mist,' says Timothy;      'Primroses pale,' says Elaine;      'A nosegay of pinks and mignonette        For me,' says Jane.        'Chariots of gold,' says Timothy;      'Silvery wings,' says Elaine;      'A bumpity ride in a wagon of hay        For me,' says Jane.              JOHN MOULDY          I spied John Mouldy in his cellar,      Deep down twenty steps of stone;      In the dusk he sat a-smiling,        Smiling there alone.        He read no book, he snuffed no candle;      The rats ran in, the rats ran out;      And far and near, the drip of water        Went whisp'ring about.        The dusk was still, with dew a-falling,      I saw the Dog-star bleak and grim,      I saw a slim brown rat of Norway        Creep over him.        I spied John Mouldy in his cellar,      Deep down twenty steps of stone;      In the dusk he sat a-smiling,        Smiling there alone.              THE FLY          How large unto the tiny fly        Must little things appear!--      A rosebud like a feather bed,        Its prickle like a spear;        A dewdrop like a looking-glass,        A hair like golden wire;      The smallest grain of mustard-seed        As fierce as coals of fire;        A loaf of bread, a lofty hill;        A wasp, a cruel leopard;      And specks of salt as bright to see        As lambkins to a shepherd.              SONG          O for a moon to light me home!        O for a lanthorn green!      For those sweet stars the Pleiades,      That glitter in the twilight trees;        O for a lovelorn taper! O        For a lanthorn green!        O for a frock of tartan!        O for clear, wild, grey eyes!      For fingers light as violets,      'Neath branches that the blackbird frets;        O for a thistly meadow! O        For clear, wild grey eyes!        O for a heart like almond boughs!        O for sweet thoughts like rain!      O for first-love like fields of grey,      Shut April-buds at break of day!        O for a sleep like music!        For still dreams like rain!              I SAW THREE WITCHES          I saw three witches      That bowed down like barley,      And took to their brooms 'neath a louring sky,      And, mounting a storm-cloud,      Aloft on its margin,      Stood black in the silver as up they did fly.        I saw three witches      That mocked the poor sparrows      They carried in cages of wicker along,      Till a hawk from his eyrie      Swooped down like an arrow,      And smote on the cages, and ended their song.        I saw three witches      That sailed in a shallop,      All turning their heads with a truculent smile,      Till a bank of green osiers      Concealed their grim faces,      Though I heard them lamenting for many a mile.        I saw three witches      Asleep in a valley,      Their heads in a row, like stones in a flood,      Till the moon, creeping upward,      Looked white through the valley,      And turned them to bushes in bright scarlet bud.              THE SILVER PENNY          'Sailorman, I'll give to you        My bright silver penny,      If out to sea you'll sail me        And my dear sister Jenny.'        'Get in, young sir, I'll sail ye        And your dear sister Jenny,      But pay she shall her golden locks        Instead of your penny.'        They sail away, they sail away,        O fierce the winds blew!      The foam flew in clouds,        And dark the night grew!        And all the wild sea-water        Climbed steep into the boat;      Back to the shore again        Sail they will not.        Drowned is the sailorman,        Drowned is sweet Jenny,      And drowned in the deep sea        A bright silver penny.              THE NIGHT-SWANS          'Tis silence on the enchanted lake,      And silence in the air serene,      Save for the beating of her heart,      The lovely-eyed Evangeline.        She sings across the waters clear      And dark with trees and stars between,      The notes her fairy godmother      Taught her, the child Evangeline.        As might the unrippled pool reply,      Faltering an answer far and sweet,      Three swans as white as mountain snow      Swim mantling to her feet.        And still upon the lake they stay,      Their eyes black stars in all their snow,      And softly, in the glassy pool,      Their feet beat darkly to and fro.        She rides upon her little boat,      Her swans swim through the starry sheen,      Rowing her into Fairyland--      The lovely-eyed Evangeline.        'Tis silence on the enchanted lake,      And silence in the air serene;      Voices shall call in vain again      On earth the child Evangeline.        'Evangeline! Evangeline!'      Upstairs, downstairs, all in vain.      Her room is dim; her flowers faded;      "]]]
