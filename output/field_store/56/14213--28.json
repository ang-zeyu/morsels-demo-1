I saw nothing but him, and him not always  distinctly. During the entire incident his shouts and curses were heard,  as if through an enveloping uproar of such sounds of rage and fury as I  had never heard from the throat of man or brute!    \"For a moment only I stood irresolute, then, throwing down my gun, I  ran forward to my friend's assistance. I had a vague belief that he was  suffering from a fit or some form of convulsion. Before I could reach  his side he was down and quiet. All sounds had ceased, but, with a  feeling of such terror as even these awful events had not inspired, I  now saw the same mysterious movement of the wild oats prolonging itself  from the trampled area about the prostrate man toward the edge of  a wood. It was only when it had reached the wood that I was able to  withdraw my eyes and look at my companion. He was dead.\"          III    The coroner rose from his seat and stood beside the dead man. Lifting  an edge of the sheet he pulled it away, exposing the entire body,  altogether naked and showing in the candle light a clay-like yellow. It  had, however, broad maculations of bluish-black, obviously caused by  extravasated blood from contusions. The chest and sides looked as if  they had been beaten with a bludgeon. There were dreadful lacerations;  the skin was torn in strips and shreds.    The coroner moved round to the end of the table and undid a silk  handkerchief, which had been passed under the chin and knotted on the  top of the head. When the handkerchief was drawn away it exposed what  had been the throat. Some of the jurors who had risen to get a better  view repented their curiosity, and turned away their faces. Witness  Harker went to the open window and leaned out across the sill, faint and  sick. Dropping the handkerchief upon the dead man's neck, the coroner  stepped to an angle of the room, and from a pile of clothing produced  one garment after another, each of which he held up a moment for  inspection. All were torn, and stiff with blood. The jurors did not  make a closer inspection. They seemed rather uninterested. They had, in  truth, seen all this before; the only thing that was new to them being  Harker's testimony.    \"Gentlemen,\" the coroner said, \"we have no more evidence, I think. Your  duty has been already explained to you; if there is nothing you wish to  ask you may go outside and consider your verdict.\"    The foreman rose--a tall, bearded man of sixty, coarsely clad.    \"I should like to ask one question, Mr. Coroner,\" he said. \"What asylum  did this yer last witness escape from?\"    \"Mr. Harker,\" said the coroner, gravely and tranquilly, \"from what  asylum did you last escape?\"    Harker flushed crimson again, but said nothing, and the seven jurors  rose and solemnly filed out of the cabin.    \"If you have done insulting me, sir,\" said Harker, as soon as he and the  officer were left alone with the dead man, \"I suppose I am at liberty to  go?\"    \"Yes.\"    Harker started to leave, but paused, with his hand on the door latch.  The habit of his profession was strong in him--stronger than his sense  of personal dignity. He turned about and said:    \"The book that you have there--I recognize it as Morgan's diary. You  seemed greatly interested in it; you read in it while I was testifying.  May I see it? The public would like--\"    \"The book will cut no figure in this matter,\" replied the official,  slipping it into his coat pocket; \"all the entries in it were made  before the writer's death.\"    As Harker passed out of the house the jury reentered and stood about the  table on which the now covered corpse showed under the sheet with sharp  definition. The foreman seated himself near the candle, produced  from his breast pocket a pencil and scrap of paper, and wrote rather  laboriously the following verdict, which with various degrees of effort  all signed:    \"We, the jury, do find that the remains come to their death at the hands  of a mountain lion, but some of us thinks, all the same, they had fits.\"          IV    In the diary of the late Hugh Morgan are certain interesting entries  having, possibly, a scientific value as suggestions. At the inquest upon  his body the book was not put in evidence; possibly the coroner thought  it not worth while to confuse the jury. The date of the first of the  entries mentioned can not be ascertained; the upper part of the leaf is  torn away; the part of the entry remaining is as follows:    \"... would run in a half circle, keeping his head turned always toward  the centre and again he would stand still, barking furiously. At last he  ran away into the brush as fast as he could go. I thought at first that  he had gone mad, but on returning to the house found no other alteration  in his manner than what was obviously due to fear of punishment.    \"Can a dog see with his nose? Do odors impress some olfactory centre  with images of the thing emitting them? . . .    \"Sept 2.--Looking at the stars last night as they rose above the  crest of the ridge east of the house, I observed them successively  disappear--from left to right. Each was eclipsed but an instant, and  only a few at the same time, but along the entire length of the ridge  all that were within a degree or two of the crest were blotted out. It  was as if something had passed along between me and them; but I could  not see it, and the stars were not thick enough to define its outline.  Ugh! I don't like this. . . .\"    Several weeks' entries are missing, three leaves being torn from the  book.    \"Sept. 27.--It has been about here again--I find evidences of its  presence every day. I watched again all of last night in the same cover,  gun in hand, double-charged with buckshot. In the morning the fresh  footprints were there, as before. Yet I would have sworn that I did not  sleep--indeed, I hardly sleep at all. It is terrible, insupportable! If  these amazing experiences are real I shall go mad; if they are fanciful  I am mad already.    \"Oct. 3.--I shall not go--it shall not drive me away. No, this is _my_  house, my land. God hates a coward....    \"Oct. 5.--I can stand it no longer; I have invited Harker to pass a few  weeks with me--he has a level head. I can judge from his manner if he  thinks me mad.    \"Oct. 7.--I have the solution of the problem; it came to me last  night--suddenly, as by revelation. How simple--how terribly simple!    \"There are sounds that we can not hear. At either end of the scale are  notes that stir no chord of that imperfect instrument, the human ear.  They are too high or too grave. I have observed a flock of blackbirds  occupying an entire treetop--the tops of several trees--and all in full  song. Suddenly--in a moment--at absolutely the same instant--all  spring into the air and fly away. How? They could not all see one  another--whole treetops intervened. At no point could a leader have been  visible to all. There must have been a signal of warning or command,  high and shrill above the din, but by me unheard. I have observed,  too, the same simultaneous flight when all were silent, among not only  blackbirds, but other birds--quail, for example, widely separated by  bushes--even on opposite sides of a hill.    \"It is known to seamen that a school of whales basking or sporting on  the surface of the ocean, miles apart, with the convexity of the earth  between them, will sometimes dive at the same instant--all gone out of  sight in a moment. The signal has been sounded--too grave for the ear  of the sailor at the masthead and his comrades on the deck--who  nevertheless feel its vibrations in the ship as the stones of a  cathedral are stirred by the bass of the organ.    \"As with sounds, so with colors. At each end of the solar spectrum the  chemist can detect the presence of what are known as 'actinic'  rays. They represent colors--integral colors in the composition of  light--which we are unable to discern. The human eye is an imperfect  instrument; its range is but a few octaves of the real 'chromatic scale'  I am not mad; there are colors that we can not see.    \"And, God help me! the Damned Thing is of such a color!\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23186"],[0,"The Handbook to English Heraldry (#2)"],[1,"Shield: its Parts, Points,    Divisions, Dividing Lines, Varieties of Form, and Heraldic    Treatment                                                           29      CHAPTER V      GRAMMAR OF HERALDRY: Section II.-- Tinctures: Metals, Colours,    Furs-- Varied Fields-- Law of Tinctures-- Counter-changing--    Diaper-- Disposition-- Blazoning-- Emblazoning in Tinctures         40      CHAPTER VI      GRAMMAR OF HERALDRY: Section III.-- The Ordinaries:-- Chief:    Fesse: Bar: Pale: Cross;
