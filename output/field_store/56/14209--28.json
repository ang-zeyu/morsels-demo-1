French literature, we have hinted, is comparatively poor in poetry. This  is due in part, no doubt, to the genius of the people; but it is also  due in part to the structure of the language. The language, which is  derived chiefly from Latin, is thence in such a way derived as to have  lost the regularity and stateliness of its ancient original, without  having compensated itself with any richness and sweetness of sound  peculiarly its own; like, for instance, that canorous vowel quality of  its sister derivative, the Italian. The French language, in short, is  far from being an ideal language for the poet.    In spite, however, of this fact, disputed by nobody, it is true of  French literature, as it is true of almost any national literature, that  it took its rise in verse instead of in prose. Anciently, there were two  languages subsisting together in France, which came to be distinguished  from each other in name by the word of affirmation--_oc_ or _oil_,  yes--severally peculiar to them, and thus to be known respectively as  _langue d'oc_, and _langue d'oil_. The future belonged to the latter of  the two forms of speech,--the one spoken in the northern part of the  country. This, the _langue d'oil_, became at length the French language.  But the _langue d'oc_, a soft and musical tongue, survived long enough  to become the vehicle of lyric strains, mostly on subjects of love and  gallantry, still familiar in mention, and famous as the songs of the  troubadours. The flourishing time of the troubadours was in the eleventh  and twelfth centuries. Provencal is an alternative name of the language.    Side by side with the southern _troubadours_, or a little later than  they, the _trouveres_ of the north sang, with more manly ambition, of  national themes, and, like Virgil, of arms and of heroes. Some  productions of the _trouveres_ may fairly be allowed an elevation of aim  and of treatment entitling them to be called epic in character.  _Chansons de geste_ (songs of exploit), or _romans_, is the native name  by which those primitive French poems are known. They exist in three  principal cycles, or groups, of productions,--one cycle composed of  those pertaining to Charlemagne; one, of those pertaining to British  Arthur; and a third, of those pertaining to ancient Greece and Rome,  notably to Alexander the Great. The cycle revolving around the majestic  legend of Charlemagne for its centre was Teutonic, rather than Celtic,  in spirit as well as in theme. It tended to the religious in tone. The  Arthurian cycle was properly Celtic. It dealt more with adventures of  love. The Alexandrian cycle, so named from one principal theme  celebrated,--namely, the deeds of Alexander the Great,--mixed  fantastically the traditions of ancient Greece and Rome with the then  prevailing ideas of chivalry, and with the figments of fairy lore. (The  metrical form employed in these poems gave its name to the Alexandrine  line later so predominant in French poetry.) The volume of this  quasi-epical verse, existing in its three groups, or cycles, is immense.  So is that of the satire and the allegory in metre that followed. From  this latter store of stock and example, Chaucer drew to supply his muse  with material. The _fabliaux_, so called,--fables, that is, or  stories,--were still another form of early French literature in verse.  It is only now, within the current decade of years, that a really ample  collection of _fabliaux_--hitherto, with the exception of a few printed  volumes of specimens, extant exclusively in manuscript--has been put  into course of publication. Rutebeuf, a _trouvere_ of the reign of St.  Louis (Louis IX., thirteenth century), is perhaps as conspicuous a  personal name as any that thus far emerges out of the sea of practically  anonymous early French authorship. A frankly sordid and mercenary  singer, Rutebeuf, always tending to mockery, was not seldom  licentious,--in both these respects anticipating, as probably also to  some extent by example conforming, the subsequent literary spirit of his  nation. The _fabliaux_ generally mingled with their narrative interest  that spice of raillery and satire constantly so dear to the French  literary appetite. Thibaud was, in a double sense, a royal singer of  songs; for he reigned over Navarre, as well as chanted sweetly in verse  his love and longing, so the disputed legend asserts, for Queen Blanche  of Castile. Thibaud bears the historic title of The Song-maker. He has  been styled the Beranger of the thirteenth century. To Thibaud is said  to be due the introduction of the feminine rhyme into French poetry,--a  metrical variation of capital importance. The songs of Abelard, in the  century preceding Thibaud, won a wide popularity.    Prose, meantime, had been making noteworthy approaches to form.  Villehardouin must be named as first in time among French writers of  history. His work is entitled, \"Conquest of Constantinople.\" It gives an  account of the Fourth Crusade. Joinville, a generation later, continues  the succession of chronicles with his admiring story of the life of  Saint Louis, whose personal friend he was. But Froissart of the  fourteenth century, and Comines of the fifteenth, are greater names.  Froissart, by his simplicity and his narrative art, was the Herodotus,  as Philip de Comines, for his political sagacity, has been styled the  Tacitus, of French historical literature. Up to the time of Froissart,  the literature which we have been treating as French was different  enough in form from the French of to-day to require what might be called  translation in order to become generally intelligible to the living  generation of Frenchmen. The text of Froissart is pretty archaic, but it  definitely bears the aspect of French.    With the name of Comines, who wrote of Louis XI. (compare Walter Scott's  \"Quentin Durward\"). we reach the fifteenth century, and are close upon  the great revival of learning which accompanied the religious  reformation under Luther and his peers. Now come Rabelais, boldly  declared by Coleridge one of the great creative minds of literature; and  Montaigne, with those Essays of his, still living, and, indeed, certain  always to live. John Calvin, meantime, writes his \"Institutes of the  Christian Religion\" in French as well as in Latin, showing once and for  all, that in the right hands his vernacular tongue was as capable of  gravity as many a writer before him had superfluously shown that it was  capable of levity. Amyot, the translator of Plutarch, is a French writer  of power, without whom the far greater Montaigne could hardly have been.  The influence of Amyot on French literary history is wider in reach and  longer in duration than we thus indicate; but Montaigne's indebtedness  to him is alone enough to prove that a mere translator had in this man  made a very important contribution to the forming prose literature of  France.    \"The Pleiades,\" so called, were a group of seven writers, who, about the  middle of the sixteenth century, banded themselves together in France,  with the express aim of supplying influential example to improve the  French language for literary purposes. Their peculiar appellation, \"The  Pleiades,\" was copied from that of a somewhat similar group of Greek  writers, that existed in the time of Ptolemy Philadelphus. Of course,  the implied allusion in it is to the constellation of the Pleiades. The  individual name by which the Pleiades of the sixteenth century may best  be remembered is that of Ronsard the poet, associated with the romantic  and pathetic memory of Mary, Queen of Scots. Never, perhaps, in the  history of letters was the fame of a poet in the poet's own lifetime  more universal and more splendid than was the fame of Ronsard. A high  court of literary judicature formally decreed to Ronsard the title of  The French Poet by eminence. This occurred in the youth of the poet. The  wine of success so brilliant turned the young fellow's head. He soon  began to play lord paramount of Parnassus, with every air of one born to  the purple. The kings of the earth vied with each other to do him honor.  Ronsard affected scholarship, and the foremost scholars of his time were  proud to place him with Homer and with Virgil on the roll of the poets.  Ronsard's peculiarity in style was the free use of words and  constructions not properly French. Boileau indicated whence he enriched  his vocabulary and his syntax, by satirically saying that Ronsard spoke  Greek and Latin in French. At his death, Ronsard was almost literally  buried under praises. Sainte-Beuve strikingly says that he seemed to go  forward into posterity as into a temple.    Sharp posthumous reprisals awaited the extravagant fame of Ronsard.  Malherbe, coming in the next generation, legislator of Parnassus,  laughed the literary pretensions of Ronsard to scorn. This stern critic  of form, such is the story, marked up his copy of Ronsard with notes of  censure so many, that a friend of his, seeing the annotated volume,  observed, \"What here is not marked, will be understood to have been  approved by you.\" Whereupon Malherbe, taking his pen, with one  indiscriminate stroke drew it abruptly through the whole volume. \"There  I Ronsardized,\" the contemptuous critic would exclaim, when in reading  his own verses to an acquaintance,--for Malherbe was poet himself,--he  happened to encounter a word that struck him as harsh or improper.  Malherbe, in short, sought to chasten and check the luxuriant overgrowth  to which the example and method of the Pleiades were tending to push the  language of poetry in French. The resultant effect of the two contrary  tendencies--that of literary wantonness on the one hand, and that of  literary prudery on the other--was at the same time to enrich and to "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23050"],[0,"Peter Biddulph: The Story of an Australian Settler (#2)"],[1," so I told him the truth, and he  believed me; though I believe, from the expression of some of the other  gentlemen's faces, that they fancied I was crying to gain their  compassion: at all events, they gave me no more money, and their  companions returning to the boat, they shoved off and continued their  course down the river.    As soon as they were gone I began to collect my thoughts, and to  consider my best chance of finding the lost ring.  As I heard Mr Wells  say that he would not have lost it for a hundred pounds, I believed that  was its value, and though I had no just conception of how much a hundred  pounds was, I knew that it must be a great deal of money.  I was  therefore very anxious to restore it to the kind gentleman.    Here I benefited by my good mother's instruction; and I believed her  spirit watched over me to keep me from evil; for it never occurred to  me, as I am sorry to say it did to some of the other boys who overheard  the gentleman's observation, that it would be easier if the ring was  found to sell it and secure its value, than to trust to the chance of  obtaining a small reward by returning it to its proper owner.    I fortunately overheard them plotting to secure the ring for themselves,  and I determined to counteract their plan.  Though the water was deep  where the ring had fallen there was no current, as it was in a little  bay in the bank of the river, and what was more, I remembered that the  ground was rather harder than that surrounding it, and that it rose  slightly outside.    These circumstances gave me hopes of finding the ring; so I sat down at  some little distance on the bank, pretending to be counting the money I  had received, but in reality watching narrowly the spot where I thought  it had fallen.    I do not mean to say that I was indifferent to my good fortune, but I  honestly believe I thought much more of the pleasure it would give the  poor people who had charitably taken care of me in my destitution, than  of the benefit I should myself derive from it.    The tide had only run off a very little when the ring was thrown in, so  that I had a considerable time to wait; but though I grew very hungry,  and felt that I might enjoy a plentiful meal, I would not quit my post;  indeed, I was accustomed to starve, so that did not incommode me much.    Slowly the tide receded, and one after one the other boys went away.  At  last the bank appeared, and the intervening space was left with very  little water over it.  I was in hopes that none of the other boys would  return to interrupt me in my search; but, to my annoyance, just as the  mud was left quite clear, two of them came back, and immediately tucking  up their trousers, hurried into the mud.        CHAPTER TWO.    NEW FRIENDS.    Now it so happened that I had carefully noted where the penny had  fallen, and if I had been alone, I could have gone straight to the  place.  But, wishing to mislead my rivals in the search, I waded into  the water at a considerable distance from the spot.  Glad of a clue, the  other mud-larks came over to me in a hurry, and began hunting about.  Leaving them there, I went to another place, and so on till I gradually  approached the spot where I thought the ring had fallen.  They again  followed me, and as I was stooping down I heard one of them cry out, and  I thought he had found the treasure, but it was only the penny Mr Wells  had thrown me.  \"Ho! ho!\"  I thought, \"the ring will not have reached as  far as that, but I must make haste and find it, or it will be too dark  to see anything.\"  The other boys thought the ring must be close to the  penny, and kept turning up the mud in every direction round it, while I  worked my way straight on to where the boat had been.  I had begun to  think that I must have passed it, when I saw something glitter in a  little pool of water just under a large stone.  I stooped down, and to  my joy I found that it was the gold ring.  My first impulse was to sing  out, but then it struck me that I might run some chance of being robbed  of my treasure, and that it would be a just punishment to the naughty  boys to keep them still hunting for it; so, instead of saying anything  about the matter, I pretended to be groping on as before, and at last,  on getting near the shore, I exclaimed that there was no chance of any  one finding it that night, and that I should go home.  On getting on  shore I ran as fast as my legs would carry me, eager to give my  charitable friends an account of my good fortune, but with regard to the  ring I said not a word.  The instinctive caution I possessed taught me  that it would be wiser to say nothing, even to them, about it.  I told  them, as was the case, that the money had been given to me by the  gentlemen for repeating poetry to them.    We had a capital supper that night, the best I had ever enjoyed; and  giving my wealth to my friends to keep for me, I set off the next  morning, my heart beating high with satisfaction, to restore the ring to  Mr Wells.    I found his house without much difficulty, although I had never been in  that part of London before, but my wits were not at fault on this  occasion more than on any other.  A domestic opened the door, whom I at  first took to be a very great lord, for I had seldom before seen a  livery servant; but when he told me that his master was not at home, and  he could not say when he would return, and without deigning any further  answer slammed the door in my face, I guessed who he was.  I accordingly  sat down on the steps to wait patiently for the return of Mr Wells.  As  I had been thinking all night long of my good fortune, I had not slept a  wink, and it was therefore not surprising that I fell very fast asleep  where I sat.  How long I thus remained dreaming of the events of the  previous day I do not know, when I was awaked by the sound of a kind  voice in my ear, and opening my eyes I saw Mr Wells standing before me.    \"Ah, my little poet!\" he exclaimed; \"you here already!\"    \"Yes, sir,\" I answered, jumping up; \"and I have found your ring, and  brought it to you too.\"    \"Have you indeed?  That is more than I expected,\" he replied.  \"But come  in, and you can then give me the ring, and tell me something about  yourself.\"    So I went into his house, and he was evidently pleased when he saw the  ring, which I had washed and wrapped up carefully in a bit of rag, and  it looked clean and bright.  He then took me into the parlour, where two  ladies were sitting at breakfast, where he made me join them, all untidy  as I was, at their meal; after which he desired me to give a full  account of myself, and to recite some more poetry, all of which I did,  apparently much to the satisfaction of the party present.    \"'Twere a pity for the child to grow up neglected and uncared for, as  will probably be his fate, till he becomes in no way superior to the  uncultivated, ignorant men among whom he will be doomed to live,\"  observed one of the ladies to Mr Wells, who was, I found, his wife.  \"Can you do anything for him?\"    \"I was thinking on the subject, my love,\" answered Mr Wells.  \"The  question in my mind is, `In what position shall he be placed?'\"    \"Oh, my dear, that is very easy,\" replied the lady, in an eager tone;  \"send him to a good school, and then make him one of your clerks.\"    \"That might not prove a real kindness after all,\" said her husband; \"he  has already, by his own exertions and good conduct, made one step up the  ladder, and I think it will be wiser to leave him to work his own way  upward.  He will then be less liable to slip down again.  I will keep an  eye on him, and give him advice when he requires it.\"    This I believe he said for my benefit, that I might not fancy that I had  nothing further to do than to wait for the coming of good luck, as is  the case too often with certain people, who then grumble and find fault  with the world because their luck never comes.  I do not mean to say  that opportunities do not occur to some men more frequently than to  others, but I believe that they visit most of us at some time or other  of our lives, and that it is our own fault if we do not take advantage  of them.    \"But I will learn what the boy himself has to say on the subject,\" said  Mr Wells.--\"What would you like to do, my lad?\"    \"I want to be a sailor, sir,\" I answered, promptly; for such had been  the earnest desire of my life; \"I wish to go to some of the places the  ships I see passing up and down the river visit.\"    \"You are too young yet to go to sea, but when you are old enough you  cannot perhaps do better.  The sea requires people of sense more than  any other, and yet some persons send the dunce of the family on board  ship, and then are surprised that he does not get on.  You shall now go  back to the friends who have taken care of you, and who seem good  people.  We must find somebody to whom you may go when you wish to get  some more learning, and I dare say you will find some means of earning  your bread till you are old enough to go to sea.    \"By-the-by, I must not forget the reward I promised you for finding my  ring.  I will bring it down to you to-morrow or next day, if you will in  the meantime trust me.\"    He said this smiling, and I felt sure he would not deceive me.  At the  same time I told him that he had paid me before handsomely, and that I  did not want any other reward.  He told me that must rest with him, and  that I was fairly entitled to it.  He then bade me good-bye.    With a joyful heart I returned home to record to my friends all that had  happened.    Mr Wells was as good as his word, and the following day I saw him on  horseback, inquiring his way to the street where I lived.  I went up to  him, and led him to the house.  He then dismounted, and giving his horse  to another boy to hold, he called me in, and told my friends that he had  spoken to the curate of the parish about me, and that I"]]]
