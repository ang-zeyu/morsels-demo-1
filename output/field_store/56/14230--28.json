The  heart and eye have enough to do in the streets of the city itself; they  are contented there; nay, they sometimes turn from the natural scenery,  as if too savage and solitary, to dwell with a deeper interest on the  palace walls that cast their shade upon the streets, and the crowd of  towers that rise out of that shadow into the depth of the sky.    [Illustration: Plate I. (Fig. 1., Fig. 3., Fig. 5.)]    2. _That_ is a city to be proud of, indeed; and it is this kind of  architectural dignity which you should aim at, in what you add to  Edinburgh or rebuild in it. For remember, you must either help your  scenery or destroy it; whatever you do has an effect of one kind or the  other; it is never indifferent. But, above all, remember that it is  chiefly by private, not by public, effort that your city must be  adorned. It does not matter how many beautiful public buildings you  possess, if they are not supported by, and in harmony with, the private  houses of the town. Neither the mind nor the eye will accept a new  college, or a new hospital, or a new institution, for a city. It is the  Canongate, and the Princes Street, and the High Street that are  Edinburgh. It is in your own private houses that the real majesty of  Edinburgh must consist; and, what is more, it must be by your own  personal interest that the style of the architecture which rises around  you must be principally guided. Do not think that you can have good  architecture merely by paying for it. It is not by subscribing liberally  for a large building once in forty years that you can call up architects  and inspiration. It is only by active and sympathetic attention to the  domestic and every-day work which is done for each of you, that you can  educate either yourselves to the feeling, or your builders to the doing,  of what is truly great.    3. Well, but, you will answer, you cannot feel interested in  architecture: you do not care about it, and _cannot_ care about it. I  know you cannot. About such architecture as is built nowadays, no mortal  ever did or could care. You do not feel interested in _hearing_ the same  thing over and over again;--why do you suppose you can feel interested  in _seeing_ the same thing over and over again, were that thing even the  best and most beautiful in the world? Now, you all know the kind of  window which you usually build in Edinburgh: here is an example of the  head of one (_fig._ 1), a massy lintel of a single stone, laid across  from side to side, with bold square-cut jambs--in fact, the simplest  form it is possible to build. It is by no means a bad form; on the  contrary, it is very manly and vigorous, and has a certain dignity in  its utter refusal of ornament. But I cannot say it is entertaining. How  many windows precisely of this form do you suppose there are in the New  Town of Edinburgh? I have not counted them all through the town, but I  counted them this morning along this very Queen Street, in which your  Hall is; and on the one side of that street, there are of these windows,  absolutely similar to this example, and altogether devoid of any relief  by decoration, six hundred and seventy-eight.[1] And your decorations  are just as monotonous as your simplicities. How many Corinthian and  Doric columns do you think there are in your banks, and post-offices,  institutions, and I know not what else, one exactly like another?--and  yet you expect to be interested! Nay, but, you will answer me again, we  see sunrises and sunsets, and violets and roses, over and over again,  and we do not tire of _them_. What! did you ever see one sunrise like  another? does not God vary His clouds for you every morning and every  night? though, indeed, there is enough in the disappearing and appearing  of the great orb above the rolling of the world, to interest all of us,  one would think, for as many times as we shall see it; and yet the  aspect of it is changed for us daily. You see violets and roses often,  and are not tired of them. True! but you did not often see two roses  alike, or, if you did, you took care not to put them beside each other  in the same nosegay, for fear your nosegay should be uninteresting; and  yet you think you can put 150,000 square windows side by side in the  same streets, and still be interested by them. Why, if I were to say the  same thing over and over again, for the single hour you are going to let  me talk to you, would you listen to me? and yet you let your architects  _do_ the same thing over and over again for three centuries, and expect  to be interested by their architecture; with a farther disadvantage on  the side of the builder, as compared with the speaker, that my wasted  words would cost you but little, but his wasted stones have cost you no  small part of your incomes.    [Footnote 1: Including York Place, and Picardy Place, but not counting  any window which has moldings.]    [Illustration: PLATE II. (Fig. 2)]    4. \"Well, but,\" you still think within yourselves, \"it is not _right_  that architecture should be interesting. It is a very grand thing, this  architecture, but essentially unentertaining. It is its duty to be dull,  it is monotonous by law: it cannot be correct and yet amusing.\"    Believe me, it is not so. All things that are worth doing in art, are  interesting and attractive when they are done. There is no law of right  which consecrates dullness. The proof of a thing's being right is, that  it has power over the heart; that it excites us, wins us, or helps us. I  do not say that it has influence over all, but it has over a large  class, one kind of art being fit for one class, and another for another;  and there is no goodness in art which is independent of the power of  pleasing. Yet, do not mistake me; I do not mean that there is no such  thing as neglect of the best art, or delight in the worst, just as many  men neglect nature, and feed upon what is artificial and base; but I  mean, that all good art has the _capacity of pleasing_, if people will  attend to it; that there is no law against its pleasing; but, on the  contrary, something wrong either in the spectator or the art, when it  ceases to please. Now, therefore, if you feel that your present school  of architecture is unattractive to you, I say there is something wrong,  either in the architecture or in you; and I trust you will not think I  mean to flatter you when I tell you, that the wrong is _not_ in you, but  in the architecture. Look at this for a moment (_fig._ 2); it is a  window actually existing--a window of an English domestic building[2]--a  window built six hundred years ago. You will not tell me you have no  pleasure in looking at this; or that you could not, by any possibility,  become interested in the art which produced it; or that, if every window  in your streets were of some such form, with perpetual change in their  ornaments, you would pass up and down the street with as much  indifference as now, when your windows are of _this_ form (_fig._ 1).  Can you for an instant suppose that the architect was a greater or  wiser man who built this, than he who built that? or that in the  arrangement of these dull and monotonous stones there is more wit and  sense than you can penetrate? Believe me, the wrong is not in you; you  would all like the best things best, if you only saw them. What is wrong  in you is your temper, not your taste; your patient and trustful temper,  which lives in houses whose architecture it takes for granted, and  subscribes to public edifices from which it derives no enjoyment.    [Footnote 2: Oakham Castle. I have enlarged this illustration from Mr.  Hudson Turner's admirable work on the domestic architecture of England.]    5. \"Well, but what are we to do?\" you will say to me; \"we cannot make  architects of ourselves.\" Pardon me, you can--and you ought.  Architecture is an art for all men to learn, because all are concerned  with it; and it is so simple, that there is no excuse for not being  acquainted with its primary rules, any more than for ignorance of  grammar or of spelling, which are both of them far more difficult  sciences. Far less trouble than is necessary to learn how to play chess,  or whist, or golf, tolerably,--far less than a school-boy takes to win  the meanest prize of the passing year, would acquaint you with all the  main principles of the construction of a Gothic cathedral, and I believe  you would hardly find the study less amusing. But be that as it may,  there are one or two broad principles which need only be stated to be  understood and accepted; and those I mean to lay before you, with your  permission, before you leave this room.    6. You must all, of course, have observed that the principal  distinctions between existing styles of architecture depend on their  methods of roofing any space, as a window or door for instance, or a  space between pillars; that is to say, that the character of Greek  architecture, and of all that is derived from it, depends on its roofing  a space with a single stone laid from side to side; the character of  Roman architecture, and of all derived from it, depends on its roofing  spaces with round arches; and the character of Gothic architecture  depends on its roofing spaces with pointed arches, or gables. I need  not, of course, in any way follow out for you the mode in which the  Greek system of architecture is derived from the horizontal lintel; but  I ought perhaps to explain, that by Roman architecture I do not mean  that spurious condition of temple form which was nothing more than a  luscious imitation of the Greek; but I mean that architecture in which  the Roman spirit truly manifested itself, the magnificent vaultings of  the aqueduct and the bath, and the colossal heaping of the rough stones  in the arches of the amphitheater; an architecture full of expression of  gigantic power and strength of will, and from"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/236"],[0,"The Jungle Book (#2)"],[1,"Demon for compliment's sake. Shere Khan  might have faced Father Wolf, but he could not stand up against Mother  Wolf, for he knew that where he was she had all the advantage of the  ground, and would fight to the death. So he backed out of the cave mouth  growling, and when he was clear he shouted:    \"Each dog barks in his own yard! We will see what the Pack will say to  this fostering of man-cubs. The cub is mine, and to my teeth he will  come in the end, O bush-tailed thieves!\"    Mother Wolf threw herself down panting among the cubs, and Father Wolf  said to her gravely:    \"Shere Khan speaks this much truth. The cub must be shown to the Pack.  Wilt thou still keep him, Mother?\"    \"Keep him!\" she gasped. \"He came naked, by night, alone and very hungry;  yet he was not afraid! Look, he has pushed one of my babes to one side  already. And that lame butcher would have killed him and would have run  off to the Waingunga while the villagers here hunted through all our  lairs in revenge! Keep him? Assuredly I will keep him. Lie still, little  frog. O thou Mowgli--for Mowgli the Frog I will call thee--the time will  come when thou wilt hunt Shere Khan as he has hunted thee.\"    \"But what will our Pack say?\" said Father Wolf.    The Law of the Jungle lays down very clearly that any wolf may, when he  marries, withdraw from the Pack he belongs to. But as soon as his cubs  are old enough to stand on their feet he must bring them to the Pack  Council, which is generally held once a month at full moon, in order  that the other wolves may identify them. After that inspection the cubs  are free to run where they please, and until they have killed their  first buck no excuse is accepted if a grown wolf of the Pack kills one  of them. The punishment is death where the murderer can be found; and if  you think for a minute you will see that this must be so.    Father Wolf waited till his cubs could run a little, and then on the  night of the Pack Meeting took them and Mowgli and Mother Wolf to the  Council Rock--a hilltop covered with stones and boulders where a hundred  wolves could hide. Akela, the great gray Lone Wolf, who led all the Pack  by strength and cunning, lay out at full length on his rock, and  below him sat forty or more wolves of every size and color, from  badger-colored veterans who could handle a buck alone to young black  three-year-olds who thought they could. The Lone Wolf had led them for a  year now. He had fallen twice into a wolf trap in his youth, and once he  had been beaten and left for dead; so he knew the manners and customs  of men. There was very little talking at the Rock. The cubs tumbled over  each other in the center of the circle where their mothers and fathers  sat, and now and again a senior wolf would go quietly up to a cub, look  at him carefully, and return to his place on noiseless feet. Sometimes a  mother would push her cub far out into the moonlight to be sure that  he had not been overlooked. Akela from his rock would cry: \"Ye know  the Law--ye know the Law. Look well, O Wolves!\" And the anxious mothers  would take up the call: \"Look--look well, O Wolves!\"    At last--and Mother Wolf's neck bristles lifted as the time came--Father  Wolf pushed \"Mowgli the Frog,\" as they called him, into the center,  where he sat laughing and playing with some pebbles that glistened in  the moonlight.    Akela never raised his head from his paws, but went on with the  monotonous cry: \"Look well!\" A muffled roar came up from behind the  rocks--the voice of Shere Khan crying: \"The cub is mine. Give him to  me. What have the Free People to do with a man's cub?\" Akela never even  twitched his ears. All he said was: \"Look well, O Wolves! What have  the Free People to do with the orders of any save the Free People? Look  well!\"    There was a chorus of deep growls, and a young wolf in his fourth year  flung back Shere Khan's question to Akela: \"What have the Free People to  do with a man's cub?\" Now, the Law of the Jungle lays down that if there  is any dispute as to the right of a cub to be accepted by the Pack, he  must be spoken for by at least two members of the Pack who are not his  father and mother.    \"Who speaks for this cub?\" said Akela. \"Among the Free People who  speaks?\" There was no answer and Mother Wolf got ready for what she knew  would be her last fight, if things came to fighting.    Then the only other creature who is allowed at the Pack Council--Baloo,  the sleepy brown bear who teaches the wolf cubs the Law of the Jungle:  old Baloo, who can come and go where he pleases because he eats only  nuts and roots and honey--rose upon his hind quarters and grunted.    \"The man's cub--the man's cub?\" he said. \"I speak for the man's cub.  There is no harm in a man's cub. I have no gift of words, but I speak  the truth. Let him run with the Pack, and be entered with the others. I  myself will teach him.\"    \"We need yet another,\" said Akela. \"Baloo has spoken, and he is our  teacher for the young cubs. Who speaks besides Baloo?\"    A black shadow dropped down into the circle. It was Bagheera the Black  Panther, inky black all over, but with the panther markings showing  up in certain lights like the pattern of watered silk. Everybody knew  Bagheera, and nobody cared to cross his path; for he was as cunning as  Tabaqui, as bold as the wild buffalo, and as reckless as the wounded  elephant. But he had a voice as soft as wild honey dripping from a tree,  and a skin softer than down.    \"O Akela, and ye the Free People,\" he purred, \"I have no right in your  assembly, but the Law of the Jungle says that if there is a doubt which  is not a killing matter in regard to a new cub, the life of that cub may  be bought at a price. And the Law does not say who may or may not pay  that price. Am I right?\"    \"Good! Good!\" said the young wolves, who are always hungry. \"Listen to  Bagheera. The cub can be bought for a price. It is the Law.\"    \"Knowing that I have no right to speak here, I ask your leave.\"    \"Speak then,\" cried twenty voices.    \"To kill a naked cub is shame. Besides, he may make better sport for you  when he is grown. Baloo has spoken in his behalf. Now to Baloo's word  I will add one bull, and a fat one, newly killed, not half a mile  from here, if ye will accept the man's cub according to the Law. Is it  difficult?\"    There was a clamor of scores of voices, saying: \"What matter? He will  die in the winter rains. He will scorch in the sun. What harm can  a naked frog do us? Let him run with the Pack. Where is the bull,  Bagheera? Let him be accepted.\" And then came Akela's deep bay, crying:  \"Look well--look well, O Wolves!\"    Mowgli was still deeply interested in the pebbles, and he did not notice  when the wolves came and looked at him one by one. At last they all went  down the hill for the dead bull, and only Akela, Bagheera, Baloo, and  Mowgli's own wolves were left. Shere Khan roared still in the night, for  he was very angry that Mowgli had not been handed over to him.    \"Ay, roar well,\" said Bagheera, under his whiskers, \"for the time will  come when this naked thing will make thee roar to another tune, or I  know nothing of man.\"    \"It was well done,\" said Akela. \"Men and their cubs are very wise. He  may be a help in time.\"    \"Truly, a help in time of need; for none can hope to lead the Pack  forever,\" said Bagheera.    Akela said nothing. He was thinking of the time that comes to every  leader of every pack when his strength goes from him and he gets feebler  and feebler, till at last he is killed by the wolves and a new leader  comes up--to be killed in his turn.    \"Take him away,\" he said to Father Wolf, \"and train him as befits one of  the Free People.\"    And that is how Mowgli was entered into the Seeonee Wolf Pack for the  price of a bull and on Baloo's good word.    Now you must be content to skip ten or eleven whole years, and only  guess at all the wonderful life that Mowgli led among the wolves,  because if it were written out it would fill ever so many books. He  grew up with the cubs, though they, of course, were grown wolves almost  before he was a child. And Father Wolf taught him his business, and the  meaning of things in the jungle, till every rustle in the grass, every  breath of the warm night air, every note of the owls above his head,  every scratch of a bat's claws as it roosted for a while in a tree, and  every splash of every little fish jumping in a pool meant just as much  to him as the work of his office means to a business man. When he was  not learning he sat out in the sun and slept, and ate and went to sleep  again. When he felt dirty or hot he swam in the forest pools; and  when he wanted honey (Baloo told him that honey and nuts were just as  pleasant to eat as raw meat) he climbed up for it, and that Bagheera  showed him how to do. Bagheera would lie out on a branch and call, \"Come  along, Little Brother,\" and at first Mowgli would cling like the sloth,  but afterward he would fling himself through the branches almost as  boldly as the gray ape. He took his place at the Council Rock, too,  when the Pack met, and there he discovered that if he stared hard at any  wolf, the wolf would be forced to drop his eyes, and so he used to stare  for fun. At other times he would pick the long thorns out of the pads  of his friends, for wolves suffer terribly from thorns and burs in their  coats. He would go down the hillside into the cultivated lands by night,  and look very curiously at the villagers in their huts, but he had a  mistrust of men because Bagheera showed him a square box with a drop  gate so cunningly hidden in the jungle that he nearly walked into it,  and told him that it was a trap. He loved better than anything else to  go with Bagheera into the dark warm heart of the forest, to sleep all  through the drowsy day, and at night see how Bagheera did his  killing. Bagheera killed right and left as he felt hungry, and so did"]]]
