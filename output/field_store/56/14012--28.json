The church was founded by Herbert de Losinga, the first bishop, as the  cathedral priory of the Benedictine monastery in Norwich (a sketch of  its constitution at this period will be found in the Notes on the  Diocese); the foundation-stone was laid in 1096 on a piece of land  called Cowholme,--meaning a pasture surrounded by water,--and the church  was dedicated to the Holy Trinity.    It may be of interest to the tourist and student to review briefly what  sort and manner of man Herbert the founder was; what had been his  environment prior to his appointment as the first bishop of Norwich; and  what the causes were which had as their effect the building of the  cathedral.    The characteristics of the cathedral are--its long nave, which is  typical of the Norman church; its glorious apsidal termination,  encircled by a procession path, which recalls the plan of a French  cathedral; and the form of this, with the remains of its old bishops'  chair centrally placed, and with the westward position, of the throne at  Torcello and other Italian churches, of the basilican type of plan.    Herbert, surnamed de Losinga, transferred the see from Thetford to  Norwich in 1094, and it is from this period that the history of the  cathedral may be said to commence.    Herbert was a prelate of a type that in the early days helped to build  up the Church and give her stability. His nature must have been  curiously complex; on the one hand, a man of action and with great  capability of administration, often justifying his means by the end he  had in view, and not being debarred from realising his schemes by any  delicate scruples, he yet, on the other hand, presents in his letters a  chastened spirituality that is not compatible with the methods he  pursued when thinking only of the temporal advantages which might accrue  on any certain line of action. But it may be said that his letters  appear to date from the later period of his life, and after he had  founded the cathedral as an expiation of that sin of simony he appears  to have so deeply repented.    Yet in the earlier period, which we shall note, he was emphatically the  man of action, the typical administrator, who, mixing freely in the  political life of the times, was strengthening the position of the  Church, and gradually leading her up to that position, which she  ultimately gained, of Arbitress of Kings and Empires.    He had also a morbid belief in the power of money--he probably would  have agreed that \"every man has his price,\" and his simoniacal dealings  with William Rufus, which procured his preferment to Norwich, afford  evidence of this weak trait in his character.    Herbert's birthplace is disputed, and, as Dean Goulburn remarked, this  is but natural: a man so justly celebrated would not, or, rather,  historians will not be content with one; so that though he cannot rival  Homer in that seven cities desired to be accredited each as his  birthplace, yet Herbert falls not far short, and this fact alone will  perhaps give some idea of his popularity during his life, and the  interest then aroused which has lasted down to our own times. From a  small pamphlet issued by the dean and chapter in 1896, and containing  extracts from the _Registrum Primum_, we learn that \"In primis Ecclesiam  prefatam fundavit piae memoriae Herbertus Episcopus, qui Normanniae in  pago Oximensi natus.\" First Herbert, the bishop, of pious memory, who  was born in Normandy, in the district of Oximin (or Exmes).    This seems very credible, and the old monkish chronicler who was  responsible for the _Registrum Primum_ and its rugged Latin, may have  had authentic proof of the truth of his assertion. The manuscript dates  from the thirteenth century, and no considerable period, historically  considered, had then passed since Herbert had been one of the prime  movers of the religious and political life of the day.    Blomefield, the antiquary, attributed to him a Suffolk extraction, and  then again spoke of his Norman descent: thus agreeing in some measure  with the _Registrum Primum_. And again, another idea is that he was born  in the hundred of Hoxne, where he possessed property, and his father  before him.    Herbert had, we know, received his education in Normandy, and had taken  his vows at, and ultimately had risen to be prior of, the Abbey of  Fecamp in Normandy; and it was while vigorously administering this  office that he received an invitation from William Rufus to come to  England, being offered as an inducement the appointment of Abbot of  Ramsey.    And no doubt from this period the spiritual side of his duties must of  necessity have been somewhat neglected. From the position of prior of  Fecamp, his circle of power limited to the neighbourhood of his priory,  and his duties rounded by the due observance of the rules of his order,  he was given at once the administration of what was one of the richest  abbeys in England, and attained at once the power of a great feudal  lord. He was Sewer to William Rufus as well, an office endowed with fees  and perquisites, and so to Herbert came the temptation of accumulating  wealth for his own ambitious ends. It was not, however, the sin of a  small man: he introduced no personal element into his greed, but rather  thought of his party and his Church, although, of necessity, an  environment so purely temporal told on the spiritual side of his  character. It might be best to connect the links of the East Anglian  bishoprics here, although in the notes on the diocese the matter is gone  into at more length.    Herbert de Losinga was the first bishop of Norwich, to which town the  see was transferred in compliance with a decree of Lanfranc's Synod,  held in 1075, that all sees should be fixed at the principal towns in  their dioceses.    Felix was the first bishop of East Anglia, and fixed his see at Dunwich  in 630.    The see was divided by Theodore, Archbishop of Canterbury, in 669 into  those of Elmham and Dunwich; and these again were united under Wildred  in 870, and the see fixed at Elmham, and where it remained till 1070,  when Herfast, a chaplain of William the Conqueror's, moved his see to  Thetford.    Now, about this time, when Herbert was abbot of Ramsey and Sewer to  William Rufus, the see of Thetford was vacant, and Herbert gave the king  to understand that if he was appointed to the vacant bishopric, and his  father made Abbot of Winchester, he was willing and able to pay for such  preferment a sum of L1900: a part of his accumulated savings, no doubt,  and a very large amount for that time.    William II. made these appointments, and the sum mentioned was paid into  the royal treasury; but the bishop found that he had attained his end at  a cost other than he had reckoned on; public opinion in those days was  quite as powerful a force as it is now, though the channels along which  its force could be felt and its strength find expression were limited.  Indignation was rife, and monkish versifiers and chroniclers protested  in lines more or less uncomplimentary, and more or less forcible, their  loathing of such sin of simony.    Now it is probable that, in expiation of this transgression, Herbert  came to build Norwich Cathedral. It is certain that he almost at once  repented. In after years, in his letters, he says, \"I entered on mine  office disgracefully, but by the help of God's grace I shall pass out of  it with credit.\"    In Dean Goulburn's admirable monograph on the cathedral many of  Herbert's letters are given, and these alone would go to stamp him as a  wonderful man. His conscience was awakened by the popular outcry against  his sin of simony, he plunged into his new duties at Thetford with  ardour in the vain hope of distraction, but failed to find that  consolation he had hoped to; and so about 1093 he determined on a visit  to Rome to tender his resignation and confess his sin to Pope Urban. He  journeyed to Rome and was kindly received, and the absolution he desired  readily granted. The Pope was glad to see an English bishop come to him  for advice, and in granting him absolution he strengthened considerably  his claim to be regarded as head of the English Church.    This lengthy preamble may seem somewhat unjustifiable, but if we are to  study any building aright, and if we are to interpret in any measure its  meaning and symbolism, it cannot wholly be done on any line of abstract  aestheticism or archaeological instinct, however intuitive it may be:  we must in some measure think of the builders of old times and of the  influences which with them produced its inception and have left it to  come down the ages to us.    It is interesting to note that Herbert's early French training  influenced him in the planning of the beautiful eastern termination to  his cathedral, and the grand sweep of the procession path. Similar  apsidal terminations, of slightly later date, once existed at Ely, and  still remain in a modified form at Peterborough.    The old tribunal arrangement of presbyters' seats with the central  bishop's throne facing west, which was part of Herbert's first plan, no  doubt may safely be accredited to the influence of his journey to Rome,  and where he may have become familiar with what was the usual basilican  arrangement.    Herbert returned to England, penitent and forgiven for his sin, and it  is probable that the Pope had laid on him, as a penance, an injunction  to build churches and found religious houses, and that with the  remainder of his wealth he determined to transfer the see from Thetford  to Norwich and to build in the latter place his cathedral church. It  would also have been in compliance with the decree of Lanfranc's Synod.  The see was transferred on the 9th of April 1094, and Herbert was  consecrated on the same day by Thomas, Archbishop of York.    Norwich was then an important town; in the Middle Ages it ranked as the  second city in the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19719"],[0,"The Art Of Writing & Speaking The English Language (#2)"],[1,"that it is a cheapjack concern.  In social life, well written letters,  like good conversational powers, bring friends and introduce the  writer into higher circles.  A command of language is the index  of culture, and the uneducated man or woman who has become wealthy  or has gained any special success is eager to put on this wedding  garment of refinement.  If he continues to regard a good command  of language as a wedding garment, he will probably fail in his effort;  but a few will discover the way to self-education and actively follow  it to its conclusion adding to their first success this new achievement.    But we may even go farther.  The right kind of language-teaching will also  give us power, a kind of eloquence, a skill in the use of words, which  will enable us to frame advertisements which will draw business, letters  which will win customers, and to speak in that elegant and forceful way so  effective in selling goods.  When all advertisements are couched in very  imperfect language, and all business letters are carelessly written, of  course no one has an advantage over another, and a good knowledge and  command of language would not be much of a recommendation to a business  man who wants a good assistant.  But when a few have come in and by their  superior command of language gained a distinct advantage over rivals, then  the power inherent in language comes into universal demand--the business  standard is raised.  There are many signs now that the business standard  in the use of language is being distinctly raised.  Already a stenographer  who does not make errors commands a salary from 25 per cent. to 50 per  cent. higher than the average, and is always in demand.  Advertisement  writers must have not only business instinct but language instinct,  and knowledge of correct, as well as forceful, expression{.}    Granted, then, that we are all eager to better our knowledge  of the English language, how shall we go about it?    There are literally thousands of published books devoted to the study  and teaching of our language.  In such a flood it would seem that we  should have no difficulty in obtaining good guides for our study.    But what do we find?  We find spelling-books filled with lists of words to  be memorized; we find grammars filled with names and definitions of all  the different forms which the language assumes; we find rhetorics filled  with the names of every device ever employed to give effectiveness to  language; we find books on literature filled with the names, dates of  birth and death, and lists of works, of every writer any one ever heard of:  and when we have learned all these names we are no better off than when we  started.  It is true that in many of these books we may find prefaces  which say, \"All other books err in clinging too closely to mere system,  to names; but we will break away and give you the real thing.\"  But they  don't do it; they can't afford to be too radical, and so they merely modify  in a few details the same old system, the system of names.  Yet it is a  great point gained when the necessity for a change is realized.    How, then, shall we go about our mastery of the English language?    Modern science has provided us a universal method by which we may study  and master any subject.  As applied to an art, this method has proved  highly successful in the case of music.  It has not been applied to  language because there was a well fixed method of language study in  existence long before modern science was even dreamed of, and that  ancient method has held on with wonderful tenacity.  The great fault  with it is that it was invented to apply to languages entirely different  from our own.  Latin grammar and Greek grammar were mechanical systems  of endings by which the relationships of words were indicated.  Of course the relationship of words was at bottom logical, but the  mechanical form was the chief thing to be learned.  Our language depends  wholly (or very nearly so) on arrangement of words, and the key is the  logical relationship.  A man who knows all the forms of the Latin or  Greek language can write it with substantial accuracy; but the man who  would master the English language must go deeper, he must master the  logic of sentence structure or word relations.  We must begin our study  at just the opposite end from the Latin or Greek; but our teachers of  language have balked at a complete reversal of method, the power of  custom and time has been too strong, and in the matter of grammar we are  still the slaves of the ancient world.  As for spelling, the  irregularities of our language seem to have driven us to one sole method,  memorizing: and to memorize every word in a language is an appalling  task.  Our rhetoric we have inherited from the middle ages, from  scholiasts, refiners, and theological logicians, a race of men who got  their living by inventing distinctions and splitting hairs.  The fact is,  prose has had a very low place in the literature of the world until  within a century; all that was worth saying was said in poetry, which the  rhetoricians were forced to leave severely alone, or in oratory, from  which all their rules were derived; and since written prose language  became a universal possession through the printing press and the  newspaper we have been too busy to invent a new rhetoric.    Now, language is just as much a natural growth as trees or rocks or human  bodies, and it can have no more irregularities, even in the matter of  spelling, than these have.  Science would laugh at the notion of  memorizing every individual form of rock.  It seeks the fundamental laws,  it classifies and groups, and even if the number of classes or groups is  large, still they have a limit and can be mastered.  Here we have a  solution of the spelling problem.  In grammar we find seven fundamental  logical relationships, and when we have mastered these and their chief  modifications and combinations, we have the essence of grammar as truly  as if we knew the name for every possible combination which our seven  fundamental relationships might have.  Since rhetoric is the art of  appealing to the emotions and intelligence of our hearers, we need to  know, not the names of all the different artifices which may be employed,  but the nature and laws of emotion and intelligence as they may be reached  through language; for if we know what we are hitting at, a little  practice will enable us to hit accurately; whereas if we knew the name of  every kind of blow, and yet were ignorant of the thing we were hitting at,  namely the intelligence and emotion of our fellow man, we would be forever  striking into the air,---striking cleverly perhaps, but ineffectively.    Having got our bearings, we find before us a purely practical problem,  that of leading the student through the maze of a new science and teaching  him the skill of an old art, exemplified in a long line of masters.    By way of preface we may say that the mastery of the English language  (or any language) is almost the task of a lifetime.  A few easy lessons  will have no effect.  We must form a habit of language study that will  grow upon us as we grow older, and little by little, but never by leaps,  shall we mount up to the full expression of all that is in us.      WORD-STUDY    INTRODUCTION    THE STUDY OF SPELLING.    The mastery of English spelling is a serious under-taking.  In the first  place, we must actually memorize from one to three thousand words which are  spelled in more or less irregular ways.  The best that can be done with  these words is to classify them as much as possible and suggest methods of  association which will aid the memory.  But after all, the drudgery of  memorizing must be gone through with.    Again, those words called homonyms, which are pronounced alike but spelled  differently, can be studied only in connection with their meaning, since  the meaning and grammatical use in the sentence is our only key to their  form.  So we have to go considerably beyond the mere mechanical association  of letters.    Besides the two or three thousand common irregular words, the dictionary  contains something over two hundred thousand other words.  Of course no one  of us can possibly have occasion to use all of those words; but at the same  time, every one of us may sooner or later have occasion to use any one of  them.  As we cannot tell before hand what ones we shall need, we should be  prepared to write any or all of them upon occasion.  Of course we may refer  to the dictionary; but this is not always, or indeed very often, possible.  It would obviously be of immense advantage to us if we could find a key to  the spelling of these numerous but infrequently used words.    The first duty of the instructor in spelling should be to provide such  a key.  We would suppose, off-hand, that the three hundred thousand  school-teachers in the United States would do this immediately and  without suggestion--certainly that the writers of school-books would.  But many things have stood in the way.  It is only within a few years,  comparatively speaking, that our language has become at all fixed in its  spelling.  Noah Webster did a great deal to establish principles, and  bring the spelling of as many words as possible to conform with these  principles and with such analogies as seemed fairly well established.  But other dictionary-makers have set up their ideas against his,  and we have a conflict of authorities.  If for any reason one finds  himself spelling a word differently from the world about him,  he begins to say, \"Well, that is the spelling given in Worcester,  or the Century, or the Standard, or the new Oxford.\"  So the word  \"authority\" looms big on the horizon; and we think so much about  authority, and about different authorities, that we forget  to look for principles, as Mr. Webster would have us do.    Another reason for neglecting rules and "]]]
