'It was a solid  Christian who dared to paint these,' I surmised.    'If you could only get Africans to believe what Christians  believed in the thirteenth century you might see signs and  wonders yet,' he said.    He has not been our way again since April, but I met him at the  Pro-Cathedral Pageant in January. It was organized by a Pageant  Master, our mutual friend the dignitary. Therein Asia, King  Solomon and Sheba's Queen, were represented. Africa was relegated  to her proper Cinderella and Plantation Chorus part. 'Poor  creatures!' Spenser said, with a grimace, and winked at me.    'Come, and I will show you a thing,' he said to me afterwards; 'a  thing I chanced on in the Christmas holidays. It's ten miles out.  I want to inspan at six sharp to-morrow.'    I was guilty of three omissions next day. I cut a clerical  meeting; I flouted the True Romance in the shape of the Pageant's  second performance; I also missed the bazaar of St. Uriel's  Native Church that was held on the Pageant ground. St. Uriel's  structure had been put out to European contract; it was a very  didactic building, so the Pageant-Master told us. We passed it on  our way out to the kopje country.    'About as sensuously lovely as a Pills' advertisement,' was  Spenser's comment. 'A good pity and terror purge.'    I sighed indulgently.    'It's very popular, I've heard, among the town boys. It's so very  European to native eyes, so extra corrugated and angular.'    We came up at last to that which we sought a huge ellipse and  dome of stones and earth, rising and broadening under our very  eyes. It was on a farm among the granite hills, many miles from  Rosebery. 'It's only a glorified stone cattle-byre, and an  intensified stone Kaffir hut,' Spenser commented. 'It's not even  built the old Mabgwe way. These are only blocks of granite; a few  of them broken, but not one of them dressed. And there's lots of  mud to eke them out.'    'Yet there's hope in the thing. It's not an artistic dead-end  like Saint Uriel's,' I pleaded.    One or two Europeans, very unskilled ones I could see, had  planned this bit of work, and taken part in it. They had made  themselves at charges for it, though African gifts had not been  wanting. They had, so to speak, coaxed their African pack on to  try an old scent. Now the moving European spirit was gone home  for months to England. Before he went the former rains had ruined  some of the work. He had been too ambitious, too scornful of  delay. Forewarned by Africans, he had pressed to a midsummer  disaster. Now he had left Africans in charge. He had trusted them  to go on. One Christian, in particular, he had trusted his fellow  and his master in building. The boy had built at a colonial's  cattle-kraal once. His skill had multiplied as he built on at the  great church, and now he was a master craftsman. Doggedly he was  building up again the rain-ruined bastions. The work was going  with a swing, if a slow one. The scent was no longer a cold one.  The pack were belling and chiming over it, and they were running  with their huntsman out of sight.    'I don't understand this bit of work properly,' Spenser said.  'What's made the dry bones live?'    'Inspiration,' I said reverently. 'Looked at in one way it's Art.  Looked at all ways it's Religion. It's the same sort of thing as  went on, I suppose, when the faith of sun and moon was a power.  Now the faith of Christ is gathering force in the land. The land  isn't an Italy, and our twentieth century isn't that old  thirteenth century; yet look out for the signs and wonders you  spoke of. Likely enough they're to be expected.'    We went to the Pageant Master's lecture on the Mabgwe Ruins that  night, when we had driven back to Rosebery. It was more  interesting to me as a subjective study than an objective display  of learning.    'Poor creatures!' the lecturer said of the natives. 'Don't put  them in a false light. Whatever claims they may have to equable  treatment, they have no claim to be considered romantic. The  ancient romance of this country is the romance of a nobler race  the romance of the Tyrian trader, Tyrian or Sabaean. Allow me but  a trifling emendation, and Matthew Arnold's lines will serve to  indicate that romance.' Substituting 'Zambesians' for 'Iberians,'  he gave us the last lines of 'The Scholar Gipsy.' 'In that era of  Tyre's trade,' he concluded, 'I place the golden age of our  country a golden age which under our own Imperial rule begins  anew.'    'H'm,' said Spenser. 'That live Mashona building-boy's worth many  dead Phoenicians to me, at any rate. As to defining romance, we'd  better agree to differ. 'Do well unto thyself, and all men will  speak well of thee,' he went on, with a tang of bitterness.  'Jew-boys and Arabs mopped up trade when they were living, now they  jump other men's kudos, being dead.'    'Never mind.' I said. 'Art for Art's sake, aspiration for  aspiration's, faith for faith's! And some there be which have no  memorial; who are perished as though they had never been; and are  become as though they had never been born; and their children  after them.'    'Never mind,' it was his turn to say. 'That granite kopje church  is rising, and Magbwe Ruins stand the quick and the dead. These  shall both come up for judgment and get justice. Yes, if they  have to wait for it till the Supreme Court of Alt holds session.'        NEW LIGHT ON AN OLD CHAMPION        We were going on an expedition long before the morning light  came. Our ship was an armed steamer a converted cargo boat. We  had reinforced our naval guns' crews and our Indian ship's guard  by taking officers and native soldiers (askaris) aboard at a  certain bay. We had reinforced our artillery by borrowing a Maxim  from the shore. I had a guest on board that night, a cheerful  padre. How he seemed to relish his craft, and how able I esteemed  him. I was very raw at the work, and he helped me to understand  what my defects were both in nature and grace. He had the  sort of smile, I thought the real, right sort to warm a naval  parishioner's heart. He was very keen on the new sort of thrills  and experiences that he had sought for himself by coming aboard.    We reclined on camp beds high up on the bridge-deck, but we did  not drop asleep when the electric light failed and faded. We  asked each other's ages, and discussed parts of England as we had  known them in more peaceful days; then we assured one another  that we wanted to rise early. We were to steam off on our sudden  raid in the dark. Coffee had been ordered about 5:30; action  might be expected to begin not much later than 6 a.m. We speculated  as to whether it were true that our ship would have to face an  old field gun's fire on the morrow, as well as a Maxim's. I was  eloquent as I told how our four-inch gun might be expected to  shake the ship. After that, in the dimness we talked shop; we had  neither of us possibly had many easy openings for that ravishing  employment lately.    Was it right to pray for our own side's success? I was steadfast  in my scruples as to praying thus, my new-found friend was  inclined to be a little scornful of them. 'Is there a God of the  Germans fighting the English tribal God?' I asked rather  irreverently, and my friend showed that he was shocked. I  apologized. 'Let's leave the Supreme Power out,' I said. 'Let's  consider the action of the saints in this war. Are they supposed  to be scrapping like the gods in Homer English Saint George  against German Saint Michael and so on?' But my friend did not  seem very keen about either Homer or hagiology. He explained that  he was a C.M.S. man, and not a medievalist. The discussion  languished, ere he murmured 'Good night.'    I slept rather fitfully. I was awake long before the ship moved  away on her fierce errand. At last, when she had been steaming  some while, I stole down in the dark to the bathroom. When I came  out of it the grey twilight was beginning. I crept aft and looked  over the bulwark, wondering how far we were away now. The shore  Maxim was in place there with plenty of sand bags about it, but  the officer in charge of it was still stretched abed. His friend  the Intelligence Officer, who had messed with us last night, was  snoring on another bed beside him. I stood looking at a dusky  island in the moonlight, and began praying a favorite prayer of  mine for those times, asking God to let Saint Michael cover our  heads in the day of battle. I muttered the prayer very low, but  it appeared that somebody heard. A slim figure, seemingly in  khaki, that I had not noticed, rose up from a seal; on the sand  bags.    'Are you praying something about battles?' it asked. I started,  and assented clumsily.    'How does one pray about battles nowadays?' the investigator  proceeded. He spoke in the friendliest way, and managed to set  even me at ease. So I told him what I had prayed for.    'It sounds a fair sort of prayer; better than some I've heard,'  he allowed, as he sat down again. 'Some people seem to forget the  last lot of the Books in the Bible when they pray nowadays.' I  heartily agreed.    'I don't believe for one,' he went on, 'that Saint Michael is  passionately interested in wiping out either English or askaris  or Germans. It's surely better to pray about him like you prayed.  I should think the negative work appeals to him more than the  positive, the salvage more than the blotting.'    His voice was clear, and evidently carried. The Maxim's warden  grumbled, and began to sit up in bed.    'Possibly,' this disturber of slumber went on quite  unconcernedly, 'Saint Michael has a clearer notion as to the real  enemy than some clients who invoke him.'    Then the officer in pyjamas accosted me, and the thread of the  other's talk was lost. When I moved off to dress he had already  left his perch among the sand bags. I climbed the ladder, and had  my coffee.

And if he any where seem to sleight his Adversaries  Tenents and Arguments, he is willing to have it look'd upon as what he  was induc'd to, not so much by his Opinion of them, as the Examples  of_ Themistius _and_ Philoponus, _and the custom of such kind of  Disputes._    _Next, In case that some of his Arguments shall not be thought of the  most Cogent sort that may be, he hopes it will be consider'd that it  ought not to be Expected, that they should be So. For, his Part being  chiefly but to propose Doubts and Scruples, he does enough, if he  shews that his Adversaries Arguments are not strongly Concluding,  though his own be not so neither. And if there should appear any  disagreement betwixt the things he delivers in divers passages, he  hopes it will be consider'd, that it is not necessary that all the  things a Sceptick Proposes, should be consonant; since it being his  work to Suggest doubts against the Opinion he questions, it is  allowable for him to propose two or more severall_ Hypotheses _about  the same thing: And to say that it may be accounted for this way, or  that way, or the other Way, though these wayes be perhaps inconsistent  among Themselves. Because it is enough for him, if either of the  proposed_ Hypotheses _be but as probable as that he calls a question.  And if he proposes many that are Each of them probable, he does the  more satisfie his doubts, by making it appear the more difficult to be  sure, that that which they alwayes differ from is the true. And our_  Carneades _by holding the Negative, he has this Advantage, that if  among all the Instances he brings to invalidate all the Vulgar  Doctrine of those he Disputes with, any one be Irrefragable, that  alone is sufficient to overthrow a Doctrine which Universally asserts  what he opposes. For, it cannot be true, that all Bodies whatsoever  that are reckon'd among the Perfectly mixt Ones, are Compounded of  such a Determinate Number of such or such Ingredients, in case any one  such Body can be produc'd, that is not so compounded; and he hopes  too, that Accurateness will be the less expected from him, because his  undertaking obliges him to maintain such Opinions in Chymistry, and  that chiefly by Chymical Arguments, as are Contrary to the very  Principles of the Chymists; From whose writings it is not Therefore  like he should receive any intentionall Assistance, except from some  Passages of the Bold and Ingenious_ Helmont, _with whom he yet  disagrees in many things (which reduce him to explicate Divers  Chymical_ Phaenomena, _according to other Notions;) And of whose  Ratiocinations, not only some seem very Extravagant, but even the Rest  are not wont to be as considerable as his Experiments. And though it  be True indeed, that some_ Aristotelians _have occasionally written  against the Chymical Doctrine he Oppugnes, yet since they have done it  according to their Principles, And since our_ Carneades _must as well  oppose their_ Hypothesis _as that of the Spagyrist, he was fain to  fight his Adversaries with their own Weapons, Those of the  Peripatetick being Improper, if not hurtfull for a Person of his  Tenents; besides that those_ Aristotelians, _(at Least, those he met  with,) that have written against the Chymists, seem to have had so  little Experimental Knowledge in Chymical Matters, that by their  frequent Mistakes and unskilfull Way of Oppugning, they have too often  expos'd Themselves to the Derision of their Adversaries, for writing  so Confidently against what they appear so little to understand._    _And Lastly_, Carneades _hopes, he shall doe the Ingenious this Piece  of service, that by having Thus drawn the Chymists Doctrine out of  their Dark and Smoakie Laboratories, and both brought it into the open  light, and shewn the weakness of their Proofs, that have hitherto  been wont to be brought for it, either Judicious Men shall henceforth  be allowed calmly and after due information to disbelieve it, or those  abler Chymists, that are zealous for the reputation of it, will be  oblig'd to speak plainer then hitherto has been done, and maintain it  by better Experiments and Arguments then Those_ Carneades _hath  examin'd: so That he hopes, the Curious will one Way or other Derive  either satisfaction or instruction from his endeavours. And as he is  ready to make good the profession he makes in the close of his  Discourse, he being ready to be better inform'd, so he expects either  to be indeed inform'd, or to be let alone. For Though if any Truly  knowing Chymists shall Think fit in a civil and rational way to shew  him any truth touching the matter in Dispute That he yet discernes  not,_ Carneades _will not refuse either to admit, or to own a  Conviction: yet if any impertinent Person shall, either to get Himself  a Name, or for what other end soever, wilfully or carelesly mistake  the State of the Controversie, or the sence of his Arguments, or shall  rail instead of arguing, as hath been done of Late in Print by divers  Chymists;_[1] _or lastly, shall write against them in a canting way; I  mean, shall express himself in ambiguous or obscure termes, or argue  from experiments not intelligibly enough Deliver'd_, Carneades  _professes, That he values his time so much, as not to think the  answering such Trifles worth the loss of it._    [Footnote 1: G. and F. and H. and others, in their books against one  another.]    _And now having said thus much for_ Carneades, _I hope the Reader will  give me leave to say something too for my self._    _And first, if some morose Readers shall find fault with my having  made the Interlocutors upon occasion complement with one another, and  that I have almost all along written these Dialogues in a stile more  Fashionable then That of meer scholars is wont to be, I hope I shall  be excus'd by them that shall consider, that to keep a due_ decorum  _in the Discourses, it was fit that in a book written by a Gentleman,  and wherein only Gentlemen are introduc'd as speakers, the Language  should be more smooth, and the Expressions more civil than is usual in  the more Scholastick way of writing. And indeed, I am not sorry to  have this Opportunity of giving an example how to manage even Disputes  with Civility; whence perhaps some Readers will be assisted to discern  a Difference betwixt Bluntness of speech and Strength of reason, and  find that a man may be a Champion for Truth, without being an Enemy to  Civility; and may confute an Opinion without railing at Them that hold  it; To whom he that desires to convince and not to provoke them, must  make some amends by his Civility to their Persons, for his severity  to their mistakes; and must say as little else as he can, to displease  them, when he says that they are in an error._    _But perhaps other Readers will be less apt to find fault with the  Civility of my Disputants, than the Chymists will be, upon the reading  of some Passages of the following Dialogue, to accuse_ Carneades _of  Asperity. But if I have made my Sceptick sometimes speak sleightingly  of the Opinions he opposes, I hope it will not be found that I have  done any more, than became the Part he was to act of an Opponent:  Especially, if what I have made him say be compar'd with what the  Prince of the Romane Orators himself makes both great Persons and  Friends say of one anothers Opinions, in his excellent Dialogues,_ De  Natura Deorum: _And I shall scarce be suspected of Partiality, in the  case, by them that take Notice that there is full as much (if not far  more) liberty of sleighting their Adversaries Tenents to be met with  in the Discourses of those with whom_ Carneades _disputes. Nor needed  I make the Interlocutors speak otherwise then freely in a Dialogue,  wherein it was sufficiently intimated, that I meant not to declare my  own Opinion of the Arguments propos'd, much lesse of the whole  Controversy it self otherwise than as it may by an attentive Reader be  guess'd at by some Passages of_ Carneades: _(I say, some Passages,  because I make not all that he says, especially in the heat of  Disputation, mine,) partly in this Discourse, and partly in some other  Dialogues betwixt the same speakers (though they treat not immediately  of the Elements) which have long layn by me, and expect the  Entertainment that these present Discourses will meet with. And indeed  they will much mistake me, that shall conclude from what I now  publish, that I am at Defyance with Chymistry, or would make my  Readers so. I hope the_ Specimina _I have lately publish'd of an  attempt to shew the usefulness of Chymical Experiments to  Contemplative Philosophers, will give those that shall read them other  thoughts of me: & I had a design (but wanted opportunity) to publish  with these Papers an Essay I have lying by me, the greater part of  which is Apologetical for one sort of Chymists. And at least, as for  those that know me, I hope the pain I have taken in the fire will both  convince them, that I am far from being an Enemy to the Chymists Art,  (though I am no friend to many that disgrace it by professing it,) and  perswade them to believe me when I declare that I distinguish betwixt  those Chymists that are either Cheats, or but Laborants, and the true_  Adepti; _By whom, could I enjoy their Conversation, I would both  willingly and thankfully be instructed; especially concerning the  Nature and Generation of Metals: And possibly, those that know how  little I have remitted of my former addictedness to make Chymical  Experiments, will easily believe, that one of the chief Designes of  this Sceptical Discourse was, not so much to discredit Chymistry, as  to give an occasion and a kind of necessity to the more knowing  Artists to lay aside a little of their over-great Reservedness, &  either"]]]
