[Illustration: Photograph of Commissioners Taken on Train Leaving Paris  for Limoges.]    This roster is taken from the previously mentioned booklet, \"The  Commission Industrielle Americaine en France.\" The object of the  Commission is carefully set forth in the opening, in French, and for the  benefit of readers who speak English only, a translation follows:    The American Industrial Commission in France, organized under the  auspices of the American Manufacturers' Export Association, with  the cordial approval of France and of the United States,  principally for a sympathetic study of industrial and commercial  conditions in France.    At the time of the visit to America by the French Commercial  Commission in the winter of 1915-1916, the idea was proposed to  different American industrial and commercial associations, to  organize a similar mission for the purpose of returning this visit  to France.    This idea was taken up by the American Manufacturers' Export  Association, which, incorporated in 1911, numbers among its  membership more than five hundred organizations of great importance  in the American industrial world. This organization is co-operative  in character, with the general idea of developing and maintaining  commercial relations between the United States and foreign  countries.    The importance of the proposed mission becomes more apparent  through a detailed analysis of its program, which comprises a study  of the most practical means of utilizing the resources and  experience of America for the reconstruction which France desires  to make of its communities and of its industries, during and after  the war.    The Association has succeeded in organizing a commission made up of  men well qualified to render the service desired.    The American Industrial Commission in France will strive to  establish an active co-operation with its French associates, with a  view of developing the commercial and industrial relation already  existing between the two nations and to make them more cordial and  more satisfactory on both sides.    The Association hopes to succeed through the work of the Commission  in contributing in some measure to this happy result, and at the  same time strengthen the friendship and sympathy which has existed  between these two nations for more than a century.    A circular issued by The American Manufacturers' Export Association is  of interest in this connection and was sent to members under  consideration and to manufacturers, soliciting subscriptions for the  expenses of the Commission. This circular is herein reproduced.    * * *    AMERICAN INDUSTRIAL COMMISSION TO FRANCE    August-September, 1916    OBJECTS    Primarily, to make a thorough and technical investigation of  present conditions in France looking to the reconstruction and  re-organization of her communities and industries which will take  place during and after the war to an extent unparalleled in  history, and further, to determine the best and most complete  manner in which the United States may contribute from her resources  to accomplish these results; to arrange for largely increased  purchases of French products and fully reciprocal commercial  relations.    In the cause of a thorough neutrality, it should be distinctly  understood that this undertaking is based upon cordial proposals  which came to us unsolicited, and that we stand ready to do  likewise in all other directions under similar conditions.    METHODS    Commissioners of known technical experience--members of the  American Manufacturers' Export Association and others--will be  chosen to investigate the present industrial situation in France in  order to aid by American brains, energies and facilities the  rehabilitation of a structure seriously damaged, and in many  instances destroyed, by the ravages of war.    Extraordinary and unprecedented facilities have been granted by the  French Government to aid the Commission in its endeavors, affording  every assurance of a successful outcome.    An official account of the Commission's visit, with a summary of  conclusions regarding each phase of its investigation, will later  be reported and published for general distribution under the  authority of the American Manufacturers' Export Association.    REPRESENTATION    It is intended to include all the industries of the United States  concerned in French trade under the following classifications:    I. Prime Movers:    (Steam, Gas and Oil Engines; Pumping Engines, Steam and Hydraulic,  Turbines, Condensers, Generators and all other adjuncts.)    Heavy Machinery: (Rolling Mills, Iron and Steel Products, etc.)    II. Machine-Tools, Wire, Transmission and Textile Machinery.    III. Milling Machinery:    (Flour and Saw Mills; Cement, Milling, Smelting, Agricultural and  Road Machinery.)    IV. Electrical Apparatus.    V. Transportation:    (Locomotives, Cars, Naval Vessels, etc.)    VI. Importers:    (Textile, including Laces; Dry-Goods of all kinds; Porcelains,  Groceries and Wines; Toys.)    VII. Synthetic Products based on chemical processes; Chemicals,  Explosives, etc.    VIII. Bankers.    IX. Factory Architects, Engineers and Contractors.    PERSONNEL    Commissioners of broad experience in their respective lines will be  chosen--men of national reputation who will lend dignity and  standing to the enterprise and guarantee a result both conclusive  and effective.    ITINERARY    With the co-operation of the French authorities an itinerary has  been tentatively prepared covering the principal industrial cities  and sections of France and consuming, together with ocean passages  approximately 60 days. A definite program is being arranged with  the cordial aid of French chambers of commerce and the great  economical associations in the localities to be visited, and this  work is now proceeding with the authority and full approval of the  French Government. Railway and other transportation throughout  France will be provided for the American Commission by the  Government. The proposed visit has aroused intense interest on  every side, and extensive plans have been made for the reception  and instructive entertainment of the American delegation.    MANAGEMENT    One of the commissioners will be appointed to take general charge of the  Commission on behalf of the American Export Association and it will be  the duty of this representative to collaborate with the French  authorities, appointed for this purpose, in the consummation of plans;  to assume executive charge of the work of the Commission; and to  organize the details necessary to the preparation of the official report  to be issued for the full benefit of American industry.    To insure absolute regularity and efficiency of progress the  Commission as a body, will be subject to this Commissioner General.    * * *    My connection as a member of the Commission came about through the  suggestion made to Mr. E. M. Herr, by Mr. James A. Farrell, President of  the United States Steel Corporation, Mr. E. A. S. Clarke, President of  the Lackawanna Steel Company, and Mr. Willis Larimer King,  Vice-president of The Jones & Laughlin Steel Company.    I was not the first choice, however, as a number of gentlemen had been  previously considered and had either declined the honor or had been  eliminated from the list of candidates. The pressure upon me from  numerous friends in the steel business to accept the task was persistent  and continuous, and upon receipt of a telegram from Mr. Farrell, telling  me, within a week of the proposed sailing of the Commission, that if I  did not accept, the great iron and steel industries of the United States  would be unrepresented, the matter was settled and I decided that it was  due to my fellow manufacturers, many of whom had been kind to me over a  long period of time and who had helped me in many ways, that I should  accept the position. I notified Mr. Herr to that effect just one week  prior to the date of sailing.    [Illustration: The Author's Passport.]    I had intended to take an active part in the political campaign pending  and such a trip involved keen disappointment in this connection, as I  felt that a change of the administration was necessary for the best  interests of the country. I had voted for every Republican president  from Lincoln to Taft and wanted very much to be somewhat instrumental in  the election of Mr. Hughes.    The McKinley Birthplace Memorial needed my attention, as well as other  matters of a public nature, to say nothing about the various business  enterprises in which I am still active.    All these obligations were temporarily abandoned and hurried  preparations were made for the long and, as thought by many, dangerous  journey.          II.    CROSSING THE ATLANTIC      The French Line was selected by the sponsor for the trip as being the  safest route and somewhat as a compliment to the French nation. Passage  was engaged for the entire party on the Lafayette, booked to sail from  New York, August 26th, 1916, at 3 P. M., destination, the French Port  Bordeaux.    I reached New York Friday morning, August 25th, and immediately set  about getting my passport properly vised by the French Consul. This was  accomplished with less difficulty than one would imagine and the  precious document finally made ready.    A luncheon was given the Commission at the Hotel Biltmore at noon by Mr.  E. M. Herr, which gave the members their first opportunity "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20467"],[0,"Handbook of the Trees of New England (#2)"],[1,"                                  Mulberry    A E H  Pointed or bristle-tipped lobes                 Black oaks    A E H  Coarse-toothed or pinnate-lobed, short lobes            ending in sharp point                            Sycamore    B      Outline entire, ovate, veins prominent   Flowering dogwood    B      Outline serrate, apex often tapering           Sheep berry    B      Outline lobed                                       Maples          II.
