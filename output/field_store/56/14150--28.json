Such a man will realize that he cannot  afford to spend his time and strength in regretting his past mistakes.  There is too much in the future. What he does in the future, not what he  has failed to do in the past, will determine the quality of his life. He  knows this, and the knowledge sends him into that future with courage  and with strength. Finally, in some indefinable way, character will  become more important to him than physical health even. Illness is half  compensated when a man realizes that it is not what he accomplishes in  the world, but what he _is_ that really counts, which puts him in touch  with the creative forces of God and raises him out of the aimless and  ordinary into a life of inspiration and joy.          II    RELIGIO MEDICI          At all events, it is certain that if any medical man had come to      Middlemarch with the reputation of having definite religious      views, of being given to prayer and of otherwise showing an      active piety, there would have been a general presumption      against his medical skill.                  GEORGE ELIOT.    When a medically educated man talks and writes of religion and of God,  he is rightly enough questioned by his brothers--who are too busy with  the hard work of practice to be concerned with anything but material  problems. To me the word \"God\" is symbolic of the power which created  and which maintains the universe. The sunrise and the stars of heaven  give me some idea of his majesty, the warmth and tenderness of human  love give me some idea of his divine love. That is all I know, but it is  enough to make life glow; it is enough to inspire the most intense  devotion to any good cause; it is enough to make me bear suffering with  some degree of patience; and it is enough, finally, to give me some  confidence and courage even in the face of the great mystery of death.  Why this or another conception of God should produce such a profound  result upon any one, I do not know, except that in some obscure way it  connects the individual with the divine plan, and does not leave him  outside in despair and loneliness. However that may be, it will be  conceded that a religious conception of some kind does much toward  justifying life, toward making it strong and livable, and so has  directly to do with certain important problems of illness and health.  The most practical medical man will admit that any illness is made  lighter and more likely to recover in the presence of hope and serenity  in the mind of the patient.    Naturally the great bulk of medical practice calls for no handling other  than that of the straight medical sort. A man comes in with a crushed  finger, a girl with anaemia--the way is clear. It is only in deeper, more  intricate departments of medicine that we altogether fail. The  bacteriologist and the pathologist have no use for mental treatment, in  their departments. But when we come to the case of the nervously  broken-down school teacher, or the worn-out telegrapher, that is another  matter. Years may elapse before work can be resumed--years of dependence  and anxiety. Here, a new view of life is often more useful than drugs, a  view that accepts the situation reasonably after a while, that does not  grope blindly and impatiently for a cure, but finds in life an  inspiration that makes it good in spite of necessary suffering and  limitations. Often enough we cannot promise a cure, but we must be  prepared to give something better.    A great deal of the fatigue and unhappiness of the world is due to the  fact that we do not go deep enough in our justification for work or  play, or for any experience, happy or sad. There is a good deal of a  void after we have said, \"Art for art's sake,\" or \"Play for the joy of  playing,\" or even after we have said, \"I am working for the sake of my  family, or for some one who needs my help.\" That is not enough; and  whether we realize it or not, the lack of deeper justification is at the  bottom of a restlessness and uncertainty which we might not be willing  to acknowledge, but which nevertheless is very real.    I am not satisfied when some moralist says, \"Be good and you will be  happy.\" The kind of happiness that comes from a perfunctory goodness is  a thing which I cannot understand, and which I certainly do not want. If  I work and play and serve and employ, making up the fabric of a busy  life, if I attain a very real happiness, I am tormented by the desire to  know why I am doing it, and I am not satisfied with the answer I  usually get. The patient may not be cured when he is relieved of his  anaemia, or when his emaciation has given place to the plumpness and  suppleness and physical strength that we call health. The man whom we  look upon as well, and who has never known physical illness, is not well  in the larger sense until he knows why he is working, why he is living,  why he is filling his life with activity. In spite of the elasticity and  spring of the world's interests, there must come often, and with a kind  of fatal insistence, the deep demand for a cause, for a justification.  If there is not an adequate significance behind it, life, with all its  courage and accomplishment, seems but a sorry thing, so full of pathos,  even in its brightest moments, so shadowed with a sense of loss and of  finality that the bravest heart may well fail and the truest courage  relax, supported only by the assurance that this way lies happiness or  that right is right.    What is this knowledge that the world is seeking, but can never find?  What is this final justification? If we seek it in its completeness, we  are doomed always to be ill and unsatisfied. If we are willing to look  only a little way into the great question, if we are willing to accept a  little for the whole, content because it is manifestly part of the final  knowledge, and because we know that final knowledge rests with God  alone, we shall understand enough to save us from much sorrow and  painful incompleteness.    There is, in the infinitely varied and beautiful world of nature, and in  the hearts of men, so much of beauty and truth that it is a wonder we do  not all realize that these things of common life may be in us and for us  the daily and hourly expression of the infinite being we call God. We do  not see God, but we do feel and know so much that we may fairly believe  to be of God that we do not need to see Him face to face. It is  something more than imagination to feel that it is the life of God in  our lives, so often unrecognized or ignored, that prompts us to all the  greatness and the inspiration and the accomplishment of the world. If we  could know more clearly the joy of such a conception, we should dry up  at its source much of the unhappiness which is, in a deep and subtle  way, at the bottom of many a nervous illness and many a wretched  existence.    The happiness which is found in the recognition of kinship with God,  through the common things of life, in the experiences which are so  significant that they could not spring from a lesser source, the  happiness which is not sought, but which is the inevitable result of  such recognition--this experience goes a long way toward making life  worth living.    If we do have this conception of life, then some of the old, old  questions that have vexed so many dwellers upon the earth will no longer  be a source of unhappiness or of illness of mind or body. The question  of immortality, for instance, which has made us afraid to die, will no  longer be a question--we shall not need to answer it, in the presence of  God, in our lives and in the world about us. We shall be content finally  to accept whatever is in store for us--so it be the will of God. We may  even look for something better than mere immortality, something more  divine than our gross conception of eternal life.    This is a religion that I believe medical men may teach without  hesitation whenever the need shall arise. I know well enough that many a  blunt if kindly man cannot bring himself to say these words, even if he  believes them, but I do think that in some measure they point the way to  what may wisely be taught.    There is a practice of medicine--the common practice--that is concerned  with the body only, and with its chemical and mechanical reactions. We  can have nothing but respect and admiration for the men who go on year  after year in the eager pursuit of this calling. We know that such a  work is necessary, that it is just as important as the educational  practice of which I write. We know that without the physical side  medicine would fail of its usefulness and that disease and death would  reap far richer harvests: I only wish the two naturally related aspects  of our dealing with patients might not be so completely separated that  they lose sight of each other. As a matter of fact, both elements are  necessary to our human welfare. If medicine devotes itself altogether to  the cure and prevention of physical disease, it will miss half of its  possibilities. It is equally true that if we forget the physical  necessities in our zeal for spiritual hygiene, we shall get and deserve  complete and humiliating failure. Many men will say, \"Why mix the two?  Why not let the preachers and the philosophers preach and the doctors  follow their own ways?\" For the most part this may have to be the  arrangement, but the doctor who can see and treat the spiritual needs of  his patient will always be more likely to cure in the best sense than  the doctor who sees only half of the picture. On the other hand, the  philosopher is likely to be a comparatively poor doctor, because he  knows nothing of medicine, and so can see only the other half of the  picture. There is much to be said for the religion of medicine if it can  be kept free from cant, if it can be simple and rational enough to be  available for the whole world.          III    THOUGHT"]]]
