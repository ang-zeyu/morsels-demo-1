[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/202"],[0,"My Bondage and My Freedom (#2)"],[1,"life of Frederick Douglass, recorded in the pages which follow,  is not merely an example of self-elevation under the most adverse  circumstances; it is, moreover, a noble vindication of the highest aims  of the American anti-slavery movement. The real object of that movement  is not only to disenthrall, it is, also, to bestow upon the Negro the  exercise of all those rights, from the possession of which he has been  so long debarred.    But this full recognition of the colored man to the right, and the  entire admission of the same to the full privileges, political,  religious and social, of manhood, requires powerful effort on the part  of the enthralled, as well as on the part of those who would disenthrall  them. The people at large must feel the conviction, as well as admit the  abstract logic, of human equality;{5} the Negro, for the first time in  the world's history, brought in full contact with high civilization,  must prove his title first to all that is demanded for him; in the teeth  of unequal chances, he must prove himself equal to the mass of those who  oppress him--therefore, absolutely superior to his apparent fate, and  to their relative ability. And it is most cheering to the friends of  freedom, today, that evidence of this equality is rapidly accumulating,  not from the ranks of the half-freed colored people of the free states,  but from the very depths of slavery itself; the indestructible equality  of man to man is demonstrated by the ease with which black men, scarce  one remove from barbarism--if slavery can be honored with such a  distinction--vault into the high places of the most advanced and  painfully acquired civilization. Ward and Garnett, Wells Brown and  Pennington, Loguen and Douglass, are banners on the outer wall, under  which abolition is fighting its most successful battles, because  they are living exemplars of the practicability of the most radical  abolitionism; for, they were all of them born to the doom of slavery,  some of them remained slaves until adult age, yet they all have not  only won equality to their white fellow citizens, in civil, religious,  political and social rank, but they have also illustrated and adorned  our common country by their genius, learning and eloquence.    The characteristics whereby Mr. Douglass has won first rank among these  remarkable men, and is still rising toward highest rank among living  Americans, are abundantly laid bare in the book before us. Like the  autobiography of Hugh Miller, it carries us so far back into early  childhood, as to throw light upon the question, \"when positive and  persistent memory begins in the human being.\" And, like Hugh Miller, he  must have been a shy old-fashioned child, occasionally oppressed by what  he could not well account for, peering and poking about among the layers  of right and wrong, of tyrant and thrall, and the wonderfulness of that  hopeless tide of things which brought power to one race, and unrequited  toil to another, until, finally, he stumbled upon{6} his \"first-found  Ammonite,\" hidden away down in the depths of his own nature, and which  revealed to him the fact that liberty and right, for all men, were  anterior to slavery and wrong. When his knowledge of the world was  bounded by the visible horizon on Col. Lloyd's plantation, and while  every thing around him bore a fixed, iron stamp, as if it had always  been so, this was, for one so young, a notable discovery.    To his uncommon memory, then, we must add a keen and accurate insight  into men and things; an original breadth of common sense which enabled  him to see, and weigh, and compare whatever passed before him, and  which kindled a desire to search out and define their relations to other  things not so patent, but which never succumbed to the marvelous nor the  supernatural; a sacred thirst for liberty and for learning, first as a  means of attaining liberty, then as an end in itself most desirable; a  will; an unfaltering energy and determination to obtain what his soul  pronounced desirable; a majestic self-hood; determined courage; a deep  and agonizing sympathy with his embruted, crushed and bleeding fellow  slaves, and an extraordinary depth of passion, together with that rare  alliance between passion and intellect, which enables the former, when  deeply roused, to excite, develop and sustain the latter.    With these original gifts in view, let us look at his schooling; the  fearful discipline through which it pleased God to prepare him for the  high calling on which he has since entered--the advocacy of emancipation  by the people who are not slaves. And for this special mission, his  plantation education was better than any he could have acquired in any  lettered school. What he needed, was facts and experiences, welded to  acutely wrought up sympathies, and these he could not elsewhere have  obtained, in a manner so peculiarly adapted to his nature. His physical  being was well trained, also, running wild until advanced into boyhood;  hard work and light diet, thereafter, and a skill in handicraft in  youth.{7}    For his special mission, then, this was, considered in connection with  his natural gifts, a good schooling; and, for his special mission,  he doubtless \"left school\" just at the proper moment. Had he remained  longer in slavery--had he fretted under bonds until the ripening of  manhood and its passions, until the drear agony of slave-wife and  slave-children had been piled upon his already bitter experiences--then,  not only would his own history have had another termination, but the  drama of American slavery would have been essentially varied; for I  cannot resist the belief, that the boy who learned to read and write as  he did, who taught his fellow slaves these precious acquirements as he  did, who plotted for their mutual escape as he did, would, when a man  at bay, strike a blow which would make slavery reel and stagger.  Furthermore, blows and insults he bore, at the moment, without  resentment; deep but suppressed emotion rendered him insensible to  their sting; but it was afterward, when the memory of them went  seething through his brain, breeding a fiery indignation at his injured  self-hood, that the resolve came to resist, and the time fixed when  to resist, and the plot laid, how to resist; and he always kept his  self-pledged word. In what he undertook, in this line, he looked fate  in the face, and had a cool, keen look at the relation of means to ends.  Henry Bibb, to avoid chastisement, strewed his master's bed with charmed  leaves and _was whipped_. Frederick Douglass quietly pocketed a like  _fetiche_, compared his muscles with those of Covey--and _whipped him_.    In the history of his life in bondage, we find, well developed, that  inherent and continuous energy of character which will ever render him  distinguished. What his hand found to do, he did with his might; even  while conscious that he was wronged out of his daily earnings, he  worked, and worked hard. At his daily labor he went with a will; with  keen, well set eye, brawny chest, lithe figure, and fair sweep of arm,  he would have been king among calkers, had that been his mission.    It must not be overlooked, in this glance at his education, that{8} Mr.  Douglass lacked one aid to which so many men of mark have been deeply  indebted--he had neither a mother's care, nor a mother's culture, save  that which slavery grudgingly meted out to him. Bitter nurse! may not  even her features relax with human feeling, when she gazes at  such offspring! How susceptible he was to the kindly influences of  mother-culture, may be gathered from his own words, on page 57: \"It  has been a life-long standing grief to me, that I know so little of my  mother, and that I was so early separated from her. The counsels of  her love must have been beneficial to me. The side view of her face is  imaged on my memory, and I take few steps in life, without feeling her  presence; but the image is mute, and I have no striking words of hers  treasured up.\"    From the depths of chattel slavery in Maryland, our author escaped into  the caste-slavery of the north, in New Bedford, Massachusetts. Here he  found oppression assuming another, and hardly less bitter, form; of  that very handicraft which the greed of slavery had taught him, his  half-freedom denied him the exercise for an honest living; he found  himself one of a class--free colored men--whose position he has  described in the following words:    \"Aliens are we in our native land. The fundamental principles of  the republic, to which the humblest white man, whether born here or  elsewhere, may appeal with confidence, in the hope of awakening a  favorable response, are held to be inapplicable to us. The glorious  doctrines of your revolutionary fathers, and the more glorious teachings  of the Son of God, are construed and applied against us. We are  literally scourged beyond the beneficent range of both authorities,  human and divine. * * * * American humanity hates us, scorns us, disowns  and denies, in a thousand ways, our very personality. The outspread wing  of American christianity, apparently broad enough to give shelter to a  perishing world, refuses to cover us. To us, its bones are brass, and  its features iron. In running thither for shelter and{9} succor, we  have only fled from the hungry blood-hound to the devouring wolf--from  a corrupt and selfish world, to a hollow and hypocritical  church.\"--_Speech before American and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society,  May_, 1854.    Four years or more, from 1837 to 1841, he struggled on, in New Bedford,  sawing wood, rolling casks, or doing what labor he might, to support  himself and young family; four years he brooded over the scars which  slavery and semi-slavery had inflicted upon his body and soul; and then,  with his wounds yet unhealed, he fell among the Garrisonians--a glorious  waif to those most ardent reformers. It happened"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2020"],[0,"Tarzan the Terrible (#2)"],[1," that she must  be sought. But this unknown, untraversed wild was of vast extent; grim,  forbidding mountains blocked his way, torrents tumbling from rocky  fastnesses impeded his progress, and at every turn he was forced to  match wits and muscles with the great carnivora that he might procure  sustenance.    Time and again Tarzan and Numa stalked the same quarry and now one, now  the other bore off the prize. Seldom however did the ape-man go hungry  for the country was rich in game animals and birds and fish, in fruit  and the countless other forms of vegetable life upon which the  jungle-bred man may subsist.    Tarzan often wondered why in so rich a country he found no evidences of  man and had at last come to the conclusion that the parched,  thorn-covered steppe and the hideous morasses had formed a sufficient  barrier to protect this country effectively from the inroads of mankind.    After days of searching he had succeeded finally in discovering a pass  through the mountains and, coming down upon the opposite side, had  found himself in a country practically identical with that which he had  left. The hunting was good and at a water hole in the mouth of a canyon  where it debouched upon a tree-covered plain Bara, the deer, fell an  easy victim to the ape-man's cunning.    It was just at dusk. The voices of great four-footed hunters rose now  and again from various directions, and as the canyon afforded among its  trees no comfortable retreat the ape-man shouldered the carcass of the  deer and started downward onto the plain. At its opposite side rose  lofty trees--a great forest which suggested to his practiced eye a  mighty jungle. Toward this the ape-man bent his step, but when midway  of the plain he discovered standing alone such a tree as best suited  him for a night's abode, swung lightly to its branches and, presently,  a comfortable resting place.    Here he ate the flesh of Bara and when satisfied carried the balance of  the carcass to the opposite side of the tree where he deposited it far  above the ground in a secure place. Returning to his crotch he settled  himself for sleep and in another moment the roars of the lions and the  howlings of the lesser cats fell upon deaf ears.    The usual noises of the jungle composed rather than disturbed the  ape-man but an unusual sound, however imperceptible to the awakened ear  of civilized man, seldom failed to impinge upon the consciousness of  Tarzan, however deep his slumber, and so it was that when the moon was  high a sudden rush of feet across the grassy carpet in the vicinity of  his tree brought him to alert and ready activity. Tarzan does not  awaken as you and I with the weight of slumber still upon his eyes and  brain, for did the creatures of the wild awaken thus, their awakenings  would be few.  As his eyes snapped open, clear and bright, so, clear  and bright upon the nerve centers of his brain, were registered the  various perceptions of all his senses.    Almost beneath him, racing toward his tree was what at first glance  appeared to be an almost naked white man, yet even at the first instant  of discovery the long, white tail projecting rearward did not escape  the ape-man. Behind the fleeing figure, escaping, came Numa, the lion,  in full charge. Voiceless the prey, voiceless the killer; as two  spirits in a dead world the two moved in silent swiftness toward the  culminating tragedy of this grim race.    Even as his eyes opened and took in the scene beneath him--even in that  brief instant of perception, followed reason, judgment, and decision,  so rapidly one upon the heels of the other that almost simultaneously  the ape-man was in mid-air, for he had seen a white-skinned creature  cast in a mold similar to his own, pursued by Tarzan's hereditary  enemy. So close was the lion to the fleeing man-thing that Tarzan had  no time carefully to choose the method of his attack. As a diver leaps  from the springboard headforemost into the waters beneath, so Tarzan of  the Apes dove straight for Numa, the lion; naked in his right hand the  blade of his father that so many times before had tasted the blood of  lions.    A raking talon caught Tarzan on the side, inflicting a long, deep wound  and then the ape-man was on Numa's back and the blade was sinking again  and again into the savage side. Nor was the man-thing either longer  fleeing, or idle. He too, creature of the wild, had sensed on the  instant the truth of the miracle of his saving, and turning in his  tracks, had leaped forward with raised bludgeon to Tarzan's assistance  and Numa's undoing. A single terrific blow upon the flattened skull of  the beast laid him insensible and then as Tarzan's knife found the wild  heart a few convulsive shudders and a sudden relaxation marked the  passing of the carnivore.    Leaping to his feet the ape-man placed his foot upon the carcass of his  kill and, raising his face to Goro, the moon, voiced the savage victory  cry that had so often awakened the echoes of his native jungle.    As the hideous scream burst from the ape-man's lips the man-thing  stepped quickly back as in sudden awe, but when Tarzan returned his  hunting knife to its sheath and turned toward him the other saw in the  quiet dignity of his demeanor no cause for apprehension.    For a moment the two stood appraising each other, and then the  man-thing spoke. Tarzan realized that the creature before him was  uttering articulate sounds which expressed in speech, though in a  language with which Tarzan was unfamiliar, the thoughts of a man  possessing to a greater or less extent the same powers of reason that  he possessed. In other words, that though the creature before him had  the tail and thumbs and great toes of a monkey, it was, in all other  respects, quite evidently a man.    The blood, which was now flowing down Tarzan's side, caught the  creature's attention. From the pocket-pouch at his side he took a small  bag and approaching Tarzan indicated by signs that he wished the  ape-man to lie down that he might treat the wound, whereupon, spreading  the edges of the cut apart, he sprinkled the raw flesh with powder from  the little bag. The pain of the wound was as nothing to the exquisite  torture of the remedy but, accustomed to physical suffering, the  ape-man withstood it stoically and in a few moments not only had the  bleeding ceased but the pain as well.    In reply to the soft and far from unpleasant modulations of the other's  voice, Tarzan spoke in various tribal dialects of the interior as well  as in the language of the great apes, but it was evident that the man  understood none of these. Seeing that they could not make each other  understood, the pithecanthropus advanced toward Tarzan and placing his  left hand over his own heart laid the palm of his right hand over the  heart of the ape-man. To the latter the action appeared as a form of  friendly greeting and, being versed in the ways of uncivilized races,  he responded in kind as he realized it was doubtless intended that he  should. His action seemed to satisfy and please his new-found  acquaintance, who immediately fell to talking again and finally, with  his head tipped back, sniffed the air in the direction of the tree  above them and then suddenly pointing toward the carcass of Bara, the  deer, he touched his stomach in a sign language which even the densest  might interpret. With a wave of his hand Tarzan invited his guest to  partake of the remains of his savage repast, and the other, leaping  nimbly as a little monkey to the lower branches of the tree, made his  way quickly to the flesh, assisted always by his long, strong sinuous  tail.    The pithecanthropus ate in silence, cutting small strips from the  deer's loin with his keen knife. From his crotch in the tree Tarzan  watched his companion, noting the preponderance of human attributes  which were doubtless accentuated by the paradoxical thumbs, great toes,  and tail.    He wondered if this creature was representative of some strange race or  if, what seemed more likely, but an atavism. Either supposition would  have seemed preposterous enough did he not have before him the evidence  of the creature's existence. There he was, however, a tailed man with  distinctly arboreal hands and feet. His trappings, gold encrusted and  jewel studded, could have been wrought only by skilled artisans; but  whether they were the work of this individual or of others like him, or  of an entirely different race, Tarzan could not, of course, determine.    His meal finished, the guest wiped his fingers and lips with leaves  broken from a nearby branch, looked up at Tarzan with a pleasant smile  that revealed a row of strong white teeth, the canines of which were no  longer than Tarzan's own, spoke a few words which Tarzan judged were a  polite expression of thanks and then sought a comfortable place in the  tree for the night.    The earth was shadowed in the darkness which precedes the dawn when  Tarzan was awakened by a violent shaking of the tree in which he had  found shelter. As he opened his eyes he saw that his companion was also  astir, and glancing around quickly to apprehend the cause of the  disturbance, the ape-man was astounded at the sight which met his eyes.    The dim shadow of a colossal form reared close beside the tree and he  saw that it was the scraping of the giant body against the branches  that had awakened him. That such a tremendous creature could have  approached so closely without disturbing him filled Tarzan with both  wonderment and chagrin. In the gloom the ape-man at first conceived the  intruder to be an elephant; yet, if so, one of greater proportions than  any he had ever before seen, but as the dim outlines became less  indistinct he saw on a line with his eyes and twenty feet above the  ground the dim silhouette of a grotesquely serrated back that gave the  impression of a creature whose each and every spinal vertebra grew "]]]
