'The misfortune,' said Philip breathlessly. 'Oh, Helen, I'm not a baby.  Do tell me! Have we lost our money in a burst bank? Or is the landlord  going to put bailiffs into our furniture? Or are we going to be falsely  accused about forgery, or being burglars?'    All the books Philip had ever read worked together in his mind to  produce these melancholy suggestions. Helen laughed, and instantly felt  a stiffening withdrawal of her brother from her arm.    'No, no, my Pippin, dear,' she made haste to say. 'Nothing horrid like  that has happened.'    'Then what is it?' he asked, with a growing impatience that felt like a  wolf gnawing inside him.    'I didn't want to tell you all in a hurry like this,' she said  anxiously; 'but don't you worry, my boy of boys. It's something that  makes me very happy. I hope it will you, too.'    He swung round in the circling of her arm and looked at her with sudden  ecstasy.    'Oh, Helen, dear--I know! Some one has left you a hundred thousand  pounds a year--some one you once opened a railway-carriage door for--and  now I can have a pony of my very own to ride. Can't I?'    'Yes,' said Helen slowly, 'you can have a pony; but nobody's left me  anything. Look here, my Pippin,' she added, very quickly, 'don't ask any  more questions. I'll tell you. When I was quite little like you I had a  dear friend I used to play with all day long, and when we grew up we  were friends still. He lived quite near us. And then he married some one  else. And then the some one died. And now he wants me to marry him. And  he's got lots of horses and a beautiful house and park,' she added.    'And where shall I be?' he asked.    'With me, of course, wherever I am.'    'It won't be just us two any more, though,' said Philip, 'and you said  it should be, for ever and ever.'    'But I didn't know then, Pip, dear. He's been wanting me so long----'    'Don't _I_ want you?' said Pip to himself.    'And he's got a little girl that you'll like so to play with,' she went  on. 'Her name's Lucy, and she's just a year younger than you. And  you'll be the greatest friends with her. And you'll both have ponies to  ride, and----'    'I hate her,' cried Philip, very loud, 'and I hate him, and I hate their  beastly ponies. And I hate _you_!' And with these dreadful words he  flung off her arm and rushed out of the room, banging the door after  him--on purpose.    Well, she found him in the boot-cupboard, among the gaiters and goloshes  and cricket-stumps and old rackets, and they kissed and cried and hugged  each other, and he said he was sorry he had been naughty. But in his  heart that was the only thing he was sorry for. He was sorry that he had  made Helen unhappy. He still hated 'that man,' and most of all he hated  Lucy.    He had to be polite to that man. His sister was very fond of that man,  and this made Philip hate him still more, while at the same time it made  him careful not to show how he hated him. Also it made him feel that  hating that man was not quite fair to his sister, whom he loved. But  there were no feelings of that kind to come in the way of the  detestation he felt for Lucy. Helen had told him that Lucy had fair hair  and wore it in two plaits; and he pictured her to himself as a fat,  stumpy little girl, exactly like the little girl in the story of 'The  Sugar Bread' in the old oblong 'Shock-Headed Peter' book that had  belonged to Helen when she was little.    Helen was quite happy. She divided her love between the boy she loved  and the man she was going to marry, and she believed that they were both  as happy as she was. The man, whose name was Peter Graham, was happy  enough; the boy, who was Philip, was amused--for she kept him so--but  under the amusement he was miserable.    And the wedding-day came and went. And Philip travelled on a very hot  afternoon by strange trains and a strange carriage to a strange house,  where he was welcomed by a strange nurse and--Lucy.    'You won't mind going to stay at Peter's beautiful house without me,  will you, dear?' Helen had asked. 'Every one will be kind to you, and  you'll have Lucy to play with.'    And Philip said he didn't mind. What else could he say, without being  naughty and making Helen cry again?    Lucy was not a bit like the Sugar-Bread child. She had fair hair, it is  true, and it was plaited in two braids, but they were very long and  straight; she herself was long and lean and had a freckled face and  bright, jolly eyes.    'I'm so glad you've come,' she said, meeting him on the steps of the  most beautiful house he had ever seen; 'we can play all sort of things  now that you can't play when you're only one. I'm an only child,' she  added, with a sort of melancholy pride. Then she laughed. '\"Only\" rhymes  with \"lonely,\" doesn't it?' she said.    'I don't know,' said Philip, with deliberate falseness, for he knew  quite well.    He said no more.    Lucy tried two or three other beginnings of conversation, but Philip  contradicted everything she said.    'I'm afraid he's very very stupid,' she said to her nurse, an extremely  trained nurse, who firmly agreed with her. And when her aunt came to see  her next day, Lucy said that the little new boy was stupid, and  disagreeable as well as stupid, and Philip confirmed this opinion of his  behaviour to such a degree that the aunt, who was young and  affectionate, had Lucy's clothes packed at once and carried her off for  a few days' visit.    So Philip and the nurse were left at the Grange. There was nobody else  in the house but servants. And now Philip began to know what loneliness  meant. The letters and the picture post-cards which his sister sent  every day from the odd towns on the continent of Europe, which she  visited on her honeymoon, did not cheer the boy. They merely  exasperated him, reminding him of the time when she was all his own, and  was too near to him to need to send him post-cards and letters.    The extremely trained nurse, who wore a grey uniform and white cap and  apron, disapproved of Philip to the depths of her well-disciplined  nature. 'Cantankerous little pig,' she called him to herself.    To the housekeeper she said, 'He is an unusually difficult and  disagreeable child. I should imagine that his education has been much  neglected. He wants a tight hand.'    She did not use a tight hand to him, however. She treated him with an  indifference more annoying than tyranny. He had immense liberty of a  desolate, empty sort. The great house was his to go to and fro in. But  he was not allowed to touch anything in it. The garden was his--to  wander through, but he must not pluck flowers or fruit. He had no  lessons, it is true; but, then, he had no games either. There was a  nursery, but he was not imprisoned in it--was not even encouraged to  spend his time there. He was sent out for walks, and alone, for the park  was large and safe. And the nursery was the room of all that great house  that attracted him most, for it was full of toys of the most fascinating  kind. A rocking-horse as big as a pony, the finest dolls' house you  ever saw, boxes of tea-things, boxes of bricks--both the wooden and the  terra-cotta sorts--puzzle maps, dominoes, chessmen, draughts, every kind  of toy or game that you have ever had or ever wished to have.    And Pip was not allowed to play with any of them.    'You mustn't touch anything, if you please,' the nurse said, with that  icy politeness which goes with a uniform. 'The toys are Miss Lucy's. No;  I couldn't be responsible for giving you permission to play with them.  No; I couldn't think of troubling Miss Lucy by writing to ask her if you  may play with them. No; I couldn't take upon myself to give you Miss  Lucy's address.'    For Philip's boredom and his desire had humbled him even to the asking  for this.    For two whole days he lived at the Grange, hating it and every one in  it; for the servants took their cue from the nurse, and the child felt  that in the whole house he had not a friend. Somehow he had got the idea  firmly in his head that this was a time when Helen was not to be  bothered about anything; so he wrote to her that he was quite well,  thank you, and the park was very pretty and Lucy had lots of nice toys.  He felt very brave and noble, and like a martyr. And he set his teeth  to bear it all. It was like spending a few days at the dentist's.    And then suddenly everything changed. The nurse got a telegram. A  brother who had been thought to be drowned at sea had abruptly come  home. She must go to see him. 'If it costs me the situation,' she said  to the housekeeper, who answered:    'Oh, well--go, then. I'll be responsible for the boy--sulky little  brat.'    And the nurse went. In a happy bustle she packed her boxes and went. At  the last moment Philip, on the doorstep watching her climb into the  dog-cart, suddenly sprang forward.    'Oh, Nurse!' he cried, blundering against the almost moving wheel, and  it was the first time he had called her by any name. 'Nurse, do--do say  I may take Lucy's toys to play with; it _is_ so lonely here. I may,  mayn't I? I may take them?'    Perhaps the nurse's heart was softened by her own happiness and the  thought of the brother who was not drowned. Perhaps she was only in such  a hurry that she did not know what she was saying. At any rate, when  Philip said for the third time, 'May I take them?' she hastily  answered:    'Bless the child! Take anything you like. Mind the wheel, for goodness'  sake. Good-bye, everybody!' waved her hand to the servants assembled at  the top of the wide steps, and was whirled off to joyous reunion with  the undrowned brother.    Philip drew a deep breath of satisfaction, went straight up to the  nursery, took out all the toys, and examined every single one of them.  It took him all the afternoon.

The best use he made of changing circumstances was to become  engaged to Saskia van Uylenborch, the cousin of his great friend  Hendrick van Uylenborch, the art dealer of Amsterdam. Saskia, who was  destined to live for centuries, through the genius of her husband, seems  to have been born in 1612, and to have become engaged to Rembrandt when  she was twenty. The engagement followed very closely upon the patronage  of Rembrandt by Prince Frederic Henry, the Stadtholder, who instructed  the artist to paint three pictures. There seemed no longer any need to  hesitate, and only domestic troubles seem to have delayed the marriage  until 1634. Saskia is enshrined in many pictures. She is seen first as a  young girl, then as a woman. As a bride, in the picture now at Dresden,  she sits upon her husband's knee, while he raises a big glass with his  outstretched arm. Her expression here is rather shy, as if she  deprecated the situation and realised that it might be misconstrued.  This picture gave offence to Rembrandt's critics, who declared that it  revealed the painter's taste for strong drink and riotous living--they  could see nothing more in canvas than a story. Several portraits of  Saskia remained to be painted. She would seem to have aged rapidly, for  after marriage her days were not long in the land. She was only thirty  when she died, and looked considerably older.    [Illustration: PLATE III.--SYNDICS OF THE CLOTH MERCHANTS' GUILD    This fine work, of which so much has been written, is to be seen to-day  in the Royal Museum at Amsterdam. It is one of the finest examples of  the master's portrait groups, and was painted in 1661.]    In the first years of his married life Rembrandt moved to the Nieuwe  Doelstraat. For the time he had more commissions than he knew how to  execute, few troubles save those that his fiery temperament provoked,  and one great sorrow, arising out of the death of his first-born. There  can be no doubt at all that he spent far too much money in these years;  he would attend the sales of works of art and pay extravagant sums for  any that took his fancy. If he ever paused to question himself, he would  be content to explain that he paid big prices in order to show how great  was his respect for art and artists. He came to acquire a picture by  Rubens, a book of drawings by Lucas van Leyden, and the splendid pearls  that may be seen in the later portraits of Saskia. Very soon his rash  and reckless methods became known to the dealers, who would push the  prices up with the certain knowledge that Rembrandt would rush in where  wiser buyers feared to tread. The making of an art collection, the  purchase of rich jewels for his wife, together with good and open-handed  living, soon began to play havoc with Rembrandt's estate. The artist's  temperament offended many of the sober Dutchmen who could not understand  it at all, his independence and insistence upon the finality of his own  judgment were more offensive still, and after 1636 there were fewer  applications for portraits.    In 1638 we find Rembrandt taking an action against one Albert van Loo,  who had dared to call Saskia extravagant. It was, of course, still more  extravagant of Rembrandt to waste his money on lawyers on account of a  case he could not hope to win, but this thought does not seem to have  troubled him. He did not reflect that it would set the gossips talking  more cruelly than ever. Still full of enthusiasm for life and art, he  was equally full of affection for Saskia, whose hope of raising children  seemed doomed to disappointment, for in addition to losing the little  Rombertus, two daughters, each named Cornelia, had died soon after  birth. In 1640 Rembrandt's mother died. Her picture remains on record  with that of her husband, painted ten years before, and even the  biographers of the artist do not suggest that Rembrandt was anything but  a good son. A year later the well-beloved Saskia gave birth to the one  child who survived the early years, the boy Titus. Then her health  failed, and in 1642 she died, after eight years of married life that  would seem to have been happy. In this year Rembrandt painted the famous  \"Night Watch,\" a picture representing the company of Francis Banning  Cocq, and incidentally a day scene in spite of its popular name. The  work succeeded in arousing a storm of indignation, for every sitter  wanted to have equal prominence in the canvas. They had subscribed  equally to the cost, and Rembrandt had dared to compose the picture!    It may be said that after his wife's death, and the exhibition of this  fine work, Rembrandt's pleasant years came to an end. He was then  somewhere between thirty-six and thirty-eight years old, he had made his  mark, and enjoyed a very large measure of recognition, but henceforward,  his career was destined to be a very troubled one, full of  disappointment, pain, and care. Perhaps it would have been no bad thing  for him if he could have gone with Saskia into the outer darkness. The  world would have been poorer, but the man himself would have been spared  many years that perhaps even the devoted labours of his studio could not  redeem.    Saskia's estate, which seems to have been a considerable one, was left  to Rembrandt absolutely, in trust for the sole surviving child Titus,  but Rembrandt, after his usual free and easy fashion, did not trouble  about the legal side of the question. He did not even make an inventory  of the property belonging to his wife, and this carelessness led to  endless trouble in future years, and to the distribution of a great part  of the property into the hands of gentlemen learned in the law. Perhaps  the painter had other matters to think about, he could no longer  disguise from himself the fact that public patronage was falling off. It  may be that the war with Spain was beginning to make people in  comfortable circumstances retrench, but it is more than likely that the  artist's name was not known favourably to his fellow-citizens. His  passionate temperament and his quick eye for truly artistic effects  could not be tolerated by the sober, stodgy men and women who were the  rank and file of Amsterdam's comfortable classes. To be sure, the  Stadtholder continued his patronage; he ordered the famous  \"Circumcision\" and the \"Adoration of the Shepherds.\" Pupils continued to  arrive, too, in large numbers, many of them coming from beyond Holland;  but the public stayed away.    Rembrandt was not without friends, who helped him as far as they could,  and advised him as much as they dared; but he seems to have been a man  who could not be assisted, because in matters of art he allowed no  outside interference, and he was naturally impulsive. Money ran through  his hands like water through a sieve, though it is only fair to point  out that he was very generous, and could not lend a deaf ear to any tale  of distress.    Between 1642, when Saskia died, and 1649, it is not easy to follow the  progress of his life; we can only state with certainty that his  difficulties increased almost as quickly as his work ripened. His  connection with Hendrickje Stoffels would seem to have started about  1649, and this woman with whom he lived until her death some thirteen  years later, has been abused by many biographers because she was the  painter's mistress. Some have endeavoured to prove, without any  evidence, that he married her, but this concession to Mrs. Grundy seems  a little beside the mark. The relations between the pair were a matter  for their own consideration, and it is clear that Hendrickje came to the  painter in the time of his greatest trouble, to serve him lovingly and  faithfully until she passed away at the comparatively early age of  thirty-six.    She bore him two children, who seem to have died young, and, curiously  enough, her position in the house was accepted by young Titus Rembrandt,  who, when he was nearing man's estate, started, in partnership with her,  to deal in pictures and works of art--a not very successful attempt to  support the establishment in comfort.    In the year when Hendrickje joined Rembrandt, he could no longer pay  instalments on the house he had bought for himself in the Joden  Breestraat. About the following year he began to sell property, hoping  against hope that he would be able to tide over the bad times. Three  years later he started borrowing on a very extensive scale. In 1656 a  fresh guardian was appointed for Titus, to whom his father transferred  some property, and in that year the painter was adjudged bankrupt. The  year 1657 saw much of his private property sold, but his collection of  pictures and engravings found comparatively few bidders, and realised no  more than 5000 florins. A year later his store of pictures came under  the hammer, and in 1660, Hendrickje and Titus started their plucky  attempt to establish a little business, in order that they might restore  some small part of the family fortune.    [Illustration: PLATE IV.--PORTRAIT OF AN OLD MAN    Rembrandt painted very many portraits of men and women whose identity  cannot be traced, and it is probable that the original of this striking  portrait in the Pitti Palace at Florence was unknown to many of the  painter's contemporaries. This is one of Rembrandt's late works, and is  said to have been painted about 1658.]    For a little time the keen edge of trouble seems to have been turned.  One of Rembrandt's friends secured him the commission to paint the  \"Syndics of the Drapers' Guild,\" and this is one of the last works of  importance in the artist's life, because his sight was beginning to  fail. To understand why this fresh trouble fell upon him, it is  necessary to turn for a moment to consider the marvellous etchings he  produced between 1628 and 1661. The drawings may be disregarded in this  connection, though there are about a thousand undisputed ones in  existence, but the making of the etchings,"]]]
