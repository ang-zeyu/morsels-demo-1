There are but few among those inhabitants of Fairy-land of whom  \"Popular Tales\" tell, who are better known to the outer world than  Cinderella--the despised and flouted younger sister, who long sits  unnoticed beside the hearth, then furtively visits the glittering  halls of the great and gay, and at last is transferred from her  obscure nook to the place of honor justly due to her tardily  acknowledged merits. Somewhat like the fortunes of Cinderella have  been those of the popular tale itself. Long did it dwell beside the  hearths of the common people, utterly ignored by their superiors in  social rank. Then came a period during which the cultured world  recognized its existence, but accorded to it no higher rank than that  allotted to \"nursery stories\" and \"old wives' tales\"--except, indeed,  on those rare occasions when the charity of a condescending scholar  had invested it with such a garb as was supposed to enable it to make  a respectable appearance in polite society. At length there arrived  the season of its final change, when, transferred from the dusk of the  peasant's hut into the full light of the outer day, and freed from the  unbecoming garments by which it had been disfigured, it was recognized  as the scion of a family so truly royal that some of its members  deduce their origin from the olden gods themselves.    In our days the folk-tale, instead of being left to the careless  guardianship of youth and ignorance, is sedulously tended and held in  high honor by the ripest of scholars. Their views with regard to its  origin may differ widely. But whether it be considered in one of its  phases as a distorted \"nature-myth,\" or in another as a demoralized  apologue or parable--whether it be regarded at one time as a relic of  primeval wisdom, or at another as a blurred transcript of a page of  mediaeval history--its critics agree in declaring it to be no mere  creation of the popular fancy, no chance expression of the uncultured  thought of the rude tiller of this or that soil. Rather is it believed  of most folk-tales that they, in their original forms, were framed  centuries upon centuries ago; while of some of them it is supposed  that they may be traced back through successive ages to those myths in  which, during a prehistoric period, the oldest of philosophers  expressed their ideas relative to the material or the spiritual world.    But it is not every popular tale which can boast of so noble a  lineage, and one of the great difficulties which beset the mythologist  who attempts to discover the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22379"],[0,"Masters of Water-Colour Painting (#2)"],[1,"  to foreign countries and with Governors to Colonial possessions.  Photography had not yet been invented, and the drawings by these artists  were the only means by which the majority of inhabitants of this island  were able to obtain some idea of places beyond the sea. Hearne went to  the Leeward Isles, as draughtsman to the Governor, and produced records  of the scenery there. Afterwards he executed a number of drawings in  this country, some of which were engraved in \"Antiquities of Great  Britain.\" _View of Gloucester_ (Plate IV) is an example of his accurate  drawing, though somewhat weak in colouring. Joseph Farington, R.A.,  received instruction in drawing from Wilson, and his paintings show  slight evidence of it, as may be seen from the _Scotch Landscape_ (Plate  V), but he simply copied Nature without enduing his work with any of his  master's poetic reeling. Thomas Malton, Junr., was noted for the  accuracy with which he drew architectural views, many of them being  street scenes in London, and they are of considerable value as records.  _Old Palace Yard, Westminster_ (Plate VI) is interesting as showing  buildings on the north side of Henry VII's Chapel of the Abbey, which  have long since been demolished. He published works aquatinted by  himself, including _Westminster_, which appeared in 1792. He held  classes at which Girtin and Turner attended. The latter used to say, \"My  early master was Tom Malton.\" Edward Dayes was a versatile artist; he  painted architectural subjects, into which he frequently introduced  figures, such as _Furness Abbey_ (Plate VII), executed miniatures and  engraved in mezzotint. He also wrote several works on art. _Buckingham  House, St. James's Park_, in which a number of the _beau monde_ are seen  promenading in the park, is one of his best paintings. An engraving of  it by F. D. Soiron, produced in 1793, under the title of _Promenade in  St. James's Park_, was very popular.    Francis Wheatley, R.A., was a topographical artist, but is better known  as a painter of _genre_ subjects, especially by the engravings after  \"The Cries of London.\" _Preparing for Market_ (Plate VIII) is a good  example of his latter work, which was somewhat insipid.    The reputation of Thomas Rowlandson, who could paint landscapes with  great ability, rests upon his caricatures, which were usually drawn in  outline and tinted. He lived a somewhat dissipated life, and possessed  an abundant sense of humour, as displayed in the _Entrance to Vauxhall  Gardens_ (Plate IX), the noted place of amusement and rendezvous of the  fashionable set in the early part of the last century.    John Robert Cozens, the son of Alexander Cozens, was the first artist  at this period \"to break away from the trammels of topography, and to  raise landscape painting in water colours to a branch of fine art.\" He  travelled abroad and studied principally in Italy and Switzerland. The  lake of Nemi, situated in the Campagna, some sixteen miles west of Rome,  and reached by the famous Via Appia, has always been a favourite subject  with both poets and artists. Near the north rim of the worn-out crater,  in which the lake is situated, is the village of Nemi, surmounted by a  fine old castle, which passed through the hands of many noble families.  Pope, Byron, and others have sung the praises of the lake. Turner has  left at least five drawings of it, one of which is engraved in  Hakewell's \"Italy.\" William Pars, Richard Wilson and other artists of  the early landscape school also painted the scene. Cozens made many  drawings of Nemi and the vicinity. Two are in the Victoria and Albert  Museum and another is in the Whitworth Institute, Manchester. The  painting (Plate X), belonging to Mr. R. W. Lloyd, shows the lake with  Palazzo Cesarini on a height by its side, and the Campagna in the  distance. It is a fine example of Cozens' work treated in his poetic  manner, and into which more colour than usual has been introduced.  Cozens' last visit to Italy was made in 1782 in company with the noted  William Beckford, the author of \"Vathek.\" On his return he gradually  lost his reason. It is pathetic to think such was the sad end of a man  inspired with such artistic talents. As it has already been stated, he  was the pioneer in exalting water-colour painting to a fine art. His  footsteps were quickly followed by Girtin and Turner. The history of  these two artists, how during their early struggles they were befriended  by that art patron, Dr. Thomas Monro, a capable water-colour painter  himself, and well qualified to give advice, is too well known to need  repetition.    Girtin, during his short career, had no selfish ideas of keeping his  knowledge of painting to himself. It was mainly due to his initiation  that a club was started amongst a small body of young artists for the  study of landscape painting. They met at each other's houses in  rotation. One of its prominent members was Sir Robert Ker Porter,  a painter, traveller and author, who afterwards married a Russian  princess. He was living, at the time, at 16, Great Newport Street, which  had formerly been a residence of Sir Joshua Reynolds, and subsequently  that of Dr. Samuel Johnson. It was in this house that the first meeting  of the club was held \"for the purpose of establishing by practice a  School of Historic Landscape, the subjects being designs from poetick  passages.\" Writing in _The Somerset House Gazette_, in 1823, W. H. Pyne,  under the pseudonym of Ephraim Hardcastle, states \"this artist (Girtin)  prepared his drawings on the same principle which had hitherto been  confined to painting in oil, namely, with local colour, and shadowing  the same with the individual tint of its own shadow. Previous to the  practice of Turner and Girtin, drawings were shadowed first entirely  throughout, whatever their component parts--houses, castles, trees,  mountains, fore-grounds, middle-grounds, and distances, all with black  or grey, and these objects were afterwards stained or tinted, enriched  and finished, as is now the custom to colour prints. It was this new  practice, introduced by these distinguished artists, that acquired for  designs in water colour upon paper the title of paintings: a designation  which many works of the existing school decidedly merit, as we lately  beheld in the Exhibition of the Painters in Water Colours, where  pictures of this class were displayed in gorgeous frames, bearing out in  effect against the mass of glittering gold as powerfully as pictures in  oil.\" Girtin had a partiality for painting in a low tone of colour and  frequently on rough cartridge paper, which assisted in giving a  largeness of manner to his work. The _Landscape_ (Plate XI) is, however,  rendered in a brighter key than his usual practice.    As limitation of space will not admit of giving any account of the life  of Turner, already well known, it may be sufficient to say that  _Lucerne: Moonlight_ (Plate XII) was painted in 1843, and was originally  in the collection of Mr. H. A. J. Munro of Novar. Ruskin, who calls it a  noble drawing in his \"Notes on his Drawings by the late J. M. W.  Turner,\" makes a mistake in the title and describes it as _Zurich by  Moonlight_. John Sell Cotman, a member of the Norwich School, was  another pioneer who did much for the advancement of water-colour  painting. Unfortunately, his work was not appreciated during his career.  If he had lived in the twentieth century he would have had no cause for  the fits of depression to which he was subject during the greater part  of life. It can be well recognised that in the first half of last  century the public, who were mainly accustomed to carefully drawn  topographical scenes, failed to appreciate such paintings as the  _Classical Scene_ (Plate XIII), executed with such freedom and vigour.  It was recently exhibited at the Special Exhibition of Cotman's  Paintings at the Tate Gallery, when five other classical landscape  compositions were also shown. Cotman's work was not understood. His  paintings, both in oil and water colour, often only realised less than a  pound apiece. He was compelled to resort to teaching in order to support  his family. Eventually, through the influence of his friend, Lady  Palgrave, and the strong support of Turner, he obtained the post of  drawing-master at King's College School, London. His position then  became more secure. Still, teaching boys in the underground rooms of  Somerset House could not have been inspiriting to one who yearned to  seek Nature in the open air. He could not exclaim, like \"Old\" Crome,  when he with his pupils was once met on the banks of the Yare, \"This is  our academy.\" He died of a broken heart. At the beginning of the  nineteenth century there was a feeling amongst the artists who worked  solely in water colours that they were not being fairly treated by the  Royal Academy. They were ineligible to be elected members of that body,  and they were of opinion that their works were never placed in a  prominent position on the walls of the galleries. William Frederick  Wells, a friend of Turner and said to have suggested to him the idea of  producing his \"Liber Studiorum,\" proposed to his fellow artists that  they should form a separate society for the promotion of water-colour  painting. After considerable negotiations, ten artists met together in  November, 1804, and founded the Society of Painters in Water Colours.  The first exhibition was held in the Spring of the following year at  rooms in Lower Brook Street. After various vicissitudes and many changes  of abode this society, known in later years as the \"Old\" Society,  eventually obtained a lease of the premises in Pall Mall East. Thus,  after much roving for seventeen years, a permanent home was secured, and  the centenary of the occupation of these galleries has just been  completed. Varley and Glover were two of the original members. De Wint,  Copley Fielding, David Cox and"]]]
