(M1)    The wealth and importance of the City of London are due to a variety of  causes, of which its geographical position must certainly be esteemed not  the least. The value of such a noble river as the Thames was scarcely  over-estimated by the citizens when, as the story goes, they expressed to  King James their comparative indifference to his threatened removal of  himself, his court and parliament, from London, if only their river  remained to them. The mouth of the Thames is the most convenient port on  the westernmost boundary of the European seaboard, and ships would often  run in to replenish their tanks with the sweet water for which it was once  famous.(1)    After the fall of the Western Empire (A.D. 476), commercial enterprise  sprang up among the free towns of Italy. The carrying trade of the world's  merchandise became centred for a time in Venice, and that town led the way  in spreading the principles of commerce along the shores of the  Mediterranean, being closely followed by Genoa, Florence, and Pisa. The  tide, which then set westward, and continued its course beyond the Pillars  of Hercules, was met in later years by another stream of commerce from the  shores of the Baltic.(2) Small wonder, then, if the City of London was  quick to profit by the continuous stream of traffic passing and repassing  its very door, and vindicated its title to be called--as the Venerable Bede  had in very early days called it the Emporium of the World.(3)    But if London's prosperity were solely due to its geographical position,  we should look for the same unrivalled pre-eminence in commerce in towns  like Liverpool or Bristol, which possess similar local advantages; whilst,  if royal favour or court gaieties could make cities great, we should have  surely expected Winchester, Warwick, York, or Stafford to have outstripped  London in political and commercial greatness, for these were the  residences of the rulers of Mercia, Northumbria, and Wessex, and the  scenes of witena-gemots long before London could boast of similar favours.  Yet none of these equals London in extent, population, wealth, or  political importance.    (M2)    We must therefore look for other causes of London's pre-eminence, and  among these, we may reckon the fact that the City has never been subject  to any over-lord except the king. It never formed a portion of the king's  demesne (_dominium_), but has ever been held by its burgesses as tenants  _in capite_ by burgage (free socage) tenure. Other towns like Bristol,  Plymouth, Beverley, or Durham, were subject to over-lords, ecclesiastical  or lay, in the person of archbishop, bishop, abbot, baron or peer of the  realm, who kept in their own hands many of the privileges which in the  more favoured City of London were enjoyed by the municipal authorities.    In the early part of the twelfth century, the town of Leicester, for  instance, was divided into four parts, one of which was in the king's  demesne, whilst the rest were held by three distinct over-lords. In course  of time, the whole of the shares fell into the hands of Count Robert of  Meulan, who left the town in demesne to the Earls of Leicester and his  descendants; and to this day the borough bears on its shield the arms of  the Bellomonts.(4) The town of Birmingham is said, in like manner, to bear  the arms of the barons of that name; the town of Cardiff, those of the De  Clares; and Manchester, those of the Byrons. Instances might be  multiplied. But the arms of the City of London and of free boroughs, like  Winchester, Oxford, and Exeter, are referable to no over-lord, although  the borough of "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19805"],[0,"The Tale of Mr. Tod (#2)"],[1,"rocks to the other side of the house. It  was damp and smelly, and overgrown with thorns and briars.    The rabbits shivered in their shoes.    \"Oh my poor rabbit babies! What a dreadful place; I shall never see them  again!\" sighed Benjamin.    They crept up to the bedroom window. It was closed and bolted like the  kitchen. But there were signs that this window had been recently open;  the cobwebs were disturbed, and there were fresh dirty footmarks upon  the window-sill.    The room inside was so dark, that at first they could make out nothing;  but they could hear a noise--a slow deep regular snoring grunt. And as  their eyes became accustomed to the darkness, they perceived that  somebody was asleep on Mr. Tod's bed, curled up under the blanket.--\"He  has gone to bed in his boots,\" whispered Peter.    [Illustration]    Benjamin, who was all of a twitter, pulled Peter off the window-sill.    Tommy Brock's snores continued, grunty and regular from Mr. Tod's bed.  Nothing could be seen of the young family.    The sun had set; an owl began to hoot in the wood. There were many  unpleasant things lying about, that had much better have been buried;  rabbit bones and skulls, and chickens' legs and other horrors. It was a  shocking place, and very dark.    They went back to the front of the house, and tried in every way to move  the bolt of the kitchen window. They tried to push up a rusty nail  between the window sashes; but it was of no use, especially without a  light.    [Illustration]    They sat side by side outside the window, whispering and listening.    In half an hour the moon rose over the wood. It shone full and clear and  cold, upon the house amongst the rocks, and in at the kitchen window.  But alas, no little rabbit babies were to be seen!    The moonbeams twinkled on the carving knife and the pie dish, and made a  path of brightness across the dirty floor.    The light showed a little door in a wall beside the kitchen  fireplace--a little iron door belonging to a brick oven, of that  old-fashioned sort that used to be heated with faggots of wood.    And presently at the same moment Peter and Benjamin noticed that  whenever they shook the window--the little door opposite shook in  answer. The young family were alive; shut up in the oven!    [Illustration]    Benjamin was so excited that it was a mercy he did not awake Tommy  Brock, whose snores continued solemnly in Mr. Tod's bed.    But there really was not very much comfort in the discovery. They could  not open the window; and although the young family was alive--the little  rabbits were quite incapable of letting themselves out; they were not  old enough to crawl.    After much whispering, Peter and Benjamin decided to dig a tunnel. They  began to burrow a yard or two lower down the bank. They hoped that they  might be able to work between the large stones under the house; the  kitchen floor was so dirty that it was impossible to say whether it was  made of earth or flags.    [Illustration]    They dug and dug for hours. They could not tunnel straight on account of  stones; but by the end of the night they were under the kitchen floor.  Benjamin was on his back, scratching upwards. Peter's claws were worn  down; he was outside the tunnel, shuffling sand away. He called out that  it was morning--sunrise; and that the jays were making a noise down  below in the woods.    Benjamin Bunny came out of the dark tunnel, shaking the sand from his  ears; he cleaned his face with his paws. Every minute the sun shone  warmer on the top of the hill. In the valley there was a sea of white  mist, with golden tops of trees showing through.    Again from the fields down below in the mist there came the angry cry of  a jay--followed by the sharp yelping bark of a fox!    Then those two rabbits lost their heads completely. They did the most  foolish thing that they could have done. They rushed into their short  new tunnel, and hid themselves at the top end of it, under Mr. Tod's  kitchen floor.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    Mr. Tod was coming up Bull Banks, and he was in the very worst of  tempers. First he had been upset by breaking the plate. It was his own  fault; but it was a china plate, the last of the dinner service that had  belonged to his grandmother, old Vixen Tod. Then the midges had been  very bad. And he had failed to catch a hen pheasant on her nest; and it  had contained only five eggs, two of them addled. Mr. Tod had had an  unsatisfactory night.    [Illustration]    As usual, when out of humour, he determined to move house. First he  tried the pollard willow, but it was damp; and the otters had left a  dead fish near it. Mr. Tod likes nobody's leavings but his own.    He made his way up the hill; his temper was not improved by noticing  unmistakable marks of badger. No one else grubs up the moss so wantonly  as Tommy Brock.    [Illustration]    Mr. Tod slapped his stick upon the earth and fumed; he guessed where  Tommy Brock had gone to. He was further annoyed by the jay bird which  followed him persistently. It flew from tree to tree and scolded,  warning every rabbit within hearing that either a cat or a fox was  coming up the plantation. Once when it flew screaming over his head--Mr.  Tod snapped at it, and barked.    He approached his house very carefully, with a large rusty key. He  sniffed and his whiskers bristled. The house was locked up, but Mr. Tod  had his doubts whether it was empty. He turned the rusty key in the  lock; the rabbits below could hear it. Mr. Tod opened the door  cautiously and went in.    [Illustration]    The sight that met Mr. Tod's eyes in Mr. Tod's kitchen made Mr. Tod  furious. There was Mr. Tod's chair, and Mr. Tod's pie dish, and his  knife and fork and mustard and salt cellar and his table-cloth that he  had left folded up in the dresser--all set out for supper (or  breakfast)--without doubt for that odious Tommy Brock.    There was a smell of fresh earth and dirty badger, which fortunately  overpowered all smell of rabbit.    But what absorbed Mr. Tod's attention was a noise--a deep slow regular  snoring grunting noise, coming from his own bed.    He peeped through the hinges of the half-open bedroom door. Then he  turned and came out of the house in a hurry. His whiskers bristled and  his coat-collar stood on end with rage.    [Illustration]    For the next twenty minutes Mr. Tod kept creeping cautiously into the  house, and retreating hurriedly out again. By degrees he ventured  further in--right into the bedroom. When he was outside the house, he  scratched up the earth with fury. But when he was inside--he did not  like the look of Tommy Brock's teeth.    He was lying on his back with his mouth open, grinning from ear to ear.  He snored peacefully and regularly; but one eye was not perfectly shut.    Mr. Tod came in and out of the bedroom. Twice he brought in his  walking-stick, and once he brought in the coal-scuttle. But he thought  better of it, and took them away.    [Illustration]    When he came back after removing the coal-scuttle, Tommy Brock was lying  a little more sideways; but he seemed even sounder asleep. He was an  incurably indolent person; he was not in the least afraid of Mr. Tod; he  was simply too lazy and comfortable to move.    Mr. Tod came back yet again into the bedroom with a clothes line. He  stood a minute watching Tommy Brock and listening attentively to the  snores. They were very loud indeed, but seemed quite natural.    Mr. Tod turned his back towards the bed, and undid the window. It  creaked; he turned round with a jump. Tommy Brock, who had opened one  eye--shut it hastily. The snores continued.    [Illustration]    Mr. Tod's proceedings were peculiar, and rather uneasy, (because the bed  was between the window and the door of the bedroom). He opened the  window a little way, and pushed out the greater part of the clothes line  on to the window sill. The rest of the line, with a hook at the end,  remained in his hand.    Tommy Brock snored conscientiously. Mr. Tod stood and looked at him for  a minute; then he left the room again.    Tommy Brock opened both eyes, and looked at the rope and grinned. There  was a noise outside the window. Tommy Brock shut his eyes in a hurry.    Mr. Tod had gone out at the front door, and round to the back of the  house. On the way, he stumbled over the rabbit burrow. If he had had any  idea who was inside it, he would have pulled them out quickly.    [Illustration]    His foot went through the tunnel nearly upon the top of Peter Rabbit and  Benjamin, but fortunately he thought that it was some more of Tommy  Brock's work.    He took up the coil of line from the sill, listened for a moment, and  then tied the rope to a tree.    Tommy Brock watched him with one eye, through the window. He was  puzzled.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    Mr. Tod fetched a large heavy pailful of water from the spring, and  staggered with it through the kitchen into his bedroom.    Tommy Brock snored industriously, with rather a snort.    Mr. Tod put down the pail beside the bed, took up the end of rope with  the hook--hesitated, and looked at Tommy Brock. The snores were almost  apoplectic; but the grin was not quite so big.    Mr. Tod gingerly mounted a chair by the head of the bedstead. His legs  were dangerously near to Tommy Brock's teeth.    He reached up and put the end of rope, with the hook, over the head of  the tester bed, where the curtains ought to hang.    (Mr. Tod's curtains were folded up, and put away, owing to the house  being unoccupied. So was the counterpane. Tommy Brock was covered with a  blanket only.) Mr. Tod standing on the unsteady chair looked down upon  him attentively; he really was a first prize sound sleeper!    It seemed as though nothing would waken him--not even the flapping rope  across the bed.    Mr. Tod descended safely from the chair, and endeavoured to get up again  with the pail of water. He intended to "]]]
