The municipality has issued a number of ordinances fixing the prices  of all necessary commodities, and the Government, after the first  panic, declared that no further requisitions are to be made. At the  same time the authorities took special pains in order to induce the  various merchants to import goods from abroad, thus relieving the  extremely strained situation of the market; but it is doubtful whether  such measures will have any calming effect on the scared population.    Immediately after war was declared between Germany and Russia the  Porte ordered the Bosphorus and the Dardanelles closed to every kind  of shipping, at the same time barring the entrances of these channels  with rows of mines. The first boat to suffer from this measure was a  British merchantman, which was sunk outside the Bosphorus, while  another had a narrow escape in the Dardanelles. A large number of  steamers of every nationality are waiting outside the straits for the  special pilot boats of the Turkish Government, in order to pass in  safety through the dangerous mine field. This measure of closing the  straits was suggested to Turkey by Austria and Germany, and was  primarily intended against Russia, as it was feared that her Black Sea  fleet might force its way into the Sea of Marmora and the Aegean.      TURKISH PARLIAMENT PROROGUED.    _On Sunday, Aug. 2, the Medjlissi-Meboussan, or Parliament of Turkey,  was urgently called together, and the Speaker of the House addressed  the members as follows:_    Dear Colleagues: The imperial proclamation ordering the last elections  has produced some uneasiness both within and without the empire. It  was said at that time that the Chamber was to be convened only to give  vent to partisan feeling and to disturb the quiet of the country. The  elections, however, proceeded in as orderly a way as possible, and the  Chamber performed its duty with great order and solicitude, having  voted the budget and many other laws. The country accordingly is  convinced that the Chamber has fulfilled its duty with relative calm,  in view of the circumstances. We part today in order to meet again in  November. The war between Austria-Hungary and Servia has a tremendous  importance in the general European situation. While until yesterday  Europe was kept in a state of watchful waiting, now we are informed  that war has been declared between Germany and Russia. In face of such  an international situation, it behooves all us Ottomans to rally in a  spirit of harmony around the imperial throne, and to act with the  moderation characteristic of our race for the preservation of our  country.    Hoping that the great example given by Parliament to the nation as  regards the working in a spirit of harmony and order will have its due  influence on the country at large, I salute you and bid you farewell.      THE MOBILIZATION.    _One of the first schemes of the German General, Liman von Sanders,  for the reorganization of the Turkish Army was to provide a system  whereby a speedier mobilization of the forces could be made possible.  According to this scheme, as far back as the first days of May, 1914,  every Mayor and village President of the empire was provided with a  sealed envelope, under orders to open it only on telegraphic notice  from the Central Administration. These envelopes were opened on Aug.  3, and were found to contain the papers constituting the order of  general mobilization, including a large poster in colors, bearing,  under the imperial monogram, or \"Tougrah,\" two crossed green Turkish  flags, with crossed sword and rifle, and underneath a gun and its  carriage, and lastly the imperial edict in large letters, reading as  follows:_    A general mobilization was ordered to  start on ........................           (To be dated on notice.)    Those liable for duty must report at  their respective headquarters. First day  of mobilization is on ........................                        (To be dated on notice.)      DIPLOMATIC SITUATION AND PRESS OPINIONS.    _While Turkey in this way was preparing for war, Talaat Bey, the  Turkish Minister of the Interior, and Halil Bey, President of the  Chamber, were leaving Constantinople for Bucharest, where they  intended meeting the representatives of the Greek Government, in order  to find a way of settling the outstanding Greco-Turkish differences  regarding the Aegean Islands and the question of refugees. The object  of this political move was twofold. First, Turkey was bent on giving  to Europe a proof of her pacific intentions, and, second, she was  trying to convince the Hellenic Government of her willingness to reach  an understanding regarding their mutual differences, and begin anew  the friendly relations of yore. The following extract is from an  editorial article published in the Ikdam of Constantinople on Aug.  17:_    From today the regeneration of our fleet begins. From today Ottoman  hearts must again rejoice. We must work hard now for the strengthening  of our navy. We must know that our fleet, which till yesterday was  lifeless, is no longer in incompetent hands and under the leadership  of lazy minds. New Turkey has intrusted her navy to iron hands. At the  head of our fleet is Djemal Pasha, whose naval successes it is  unnecessary to mention. The commander of the fleet is the Chief of the  Naval Staff, Arif Bey, and in command of the light flotilla is Capt.  Muzzafer Bey. Likewise the commanders and the other officers of the  two new battleships are chosen among the fittest. This is the  beginning of a new era for our navy. In addition to this we must say  that we are expecting good results from our political activity. Talaat  Bey and Halil Bey have left for Bucharest, where they will try to find  a solution of outstanding serious questions. At the same time they  will have an opportunity to exchange views with Rumanian statesmen. It  is unnecessary, in our belief, to exalt the significance of this  mission. We think, however, that a wise and moderate policy,  strengthened by a good army and navy, will go far in bringing good  results.    _On Sept. 10 an official announcement from the Sublime Porte was  handed to the representatives of the powers in Constantinople, and  communicated to the press. This declaration ran as follows:_    As an expression of the sentiments of hospitality and friendship on  the part of the Ottoman Government toward the European populations of  the empire, there were instituted long ago certain regulations to  which Europeans coming to the Levant for commerce would be subjected,  these same regulations having been duly communicated to the respective  Governments of those Europeans.    These regulations, adopted by the Porte on its own initiative, and  considered entirely as privileges, and having been strengthened and  made more general through certain acts, have continued to be in force  up to this time under the name \"Old Treaties,\" (in Turkish \"Ouhout-i  Atikah.\") These privileges, however, are wholly incompatible with the  legal status of recent years, and especially with the principle of  national sovereignty. In the first place, they became a hindrance to  the progress and development of the Imperial Government, while in the  second, by creating misunderstandings in its relations with the  foreign Governments, they formed a barrier preventing these relations  from becoming more harmonious and more sincere.    The Ottoman Empire continues to advance in the path of regeneration  and of reforms, overleaping many obstacles, and in order to acquire  the position due to it in the civilized family of Europe, it adopted  modern principles of government, and has not deviated from its  programme of having the State conducted on these principles.    The founding of the constitutional form of government is in itself a  proof that the efforts of the Ottoman Empire for its regeneration have  been fully crowned with success. Certain exceptions, however, based on  the capitulations, such as the participation of foreigners in the  administration of justice, which is an all-important prerogative of  national sovereignty, the limitations imposed on the legislative  rights of the State, based on the argument that certain laws cannot be  applied to foreigners, the injustice inflicted on common right from  the impossibility of convicting a delinquent who disturbs the safety  of the country merely because he happens to be a foreigner, or because  the prosecution against him must be subjected to certain limitations  and particular conditions; and likewise the difference in the  competency of the various courts dealing with cases where the  capitulations are involved; all these constitute impregnable barriers  against every effort of the country toward progress in the  administration of justice.    From another point of view, the fact that foreigners living in the  Ottoman Empire are exempt from taxation, in accordance with the  capitulations, makes it impossible for the Sublime Porte to procure  the indispensable means for the carrying out, not only of the reforms  but of its everyday needs.    The impossibility of increasing the indirect taxation is bringing  about the increase of direct taxes, and therefore makes the burden on  the Ottoman tax-payers all the heavier. The fact that foreigners who  enjoy in the Ottoman Empire every protection and every privilege as  well as freedom in their business transactions are exempt from  taxation constitutes in itself an intolerable injustice and creates at  the same time a situation detrimental to the independence and prestige  of the Government.    While the Imperial Government was firm in its resolution to continue  its efforts regarding the reforms, the general war broke and increased  the financial difficulties of the country in such"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20523"],[0,"Religion and Art in Ancient Greece (#2)"],[1,"as gratifying to the deity  worshipped under their form, when they were definitely affiliated to the  service of an anthropomorphic god; but in a more primitive stage of  belief the indwelling power probably was not associated with any such  generalisation as is implied in the change from \"animism\" or  \"polydaemonism\" to polytheism. We are here concerned not with this  growth of religious feeling, but rather with its influence upon the  sacred things that were objects of worship and with the question how far  their sanctity encouraged their artistic decoration.    It is perhaps easier to realise the feeling of a primitive people about  this matter in the case of a sacred building than in that of the actual  image of a god. A temple does not, indeed--in Greece, at least--belong  to the earliest phase of cult; for it is the dwelling of the god, and  its form, based on that of a human dwelling-house, implies an  anthropomorphic imagination. We find, however, in Homer that the gods  are actually thought of as inhabiting their temples and preferring one  to another, Athena going to Athens and Aphrodite to Paphos as her chosen  abode. It was clearly desirable for every city to gain this special  favour; and an obvious way to do this was to make the dwelling-place  attractive in itself to the deity. This might be done not merely by the  abundance of sacrifices, but also by the architectural beauty of the  building itself, and by the richness of the offerings it contained. Here  was, therefore, a very practical reason for making the dwelling of the  god as sumptuous and beautiful as possible, in order that he might be  attracted to live in it and to give his favour and protection to those  that dwelt around it. Doubtless, as religious ideas advanced and the  conception of the nature of the gods became higher, there came the  notion that they did not dwell in houses made with hands; yet a Greek  temple, just like a mediaeval cathedral, might be made beautiful as a  pleasing service and an honour to the deity to whom it was dedicated;  and there was a continuous tradition in practice from the lower  conception to the higher, nor is it easy to draw the line at any  particular stage between the two.    If we turn now to the sacred image of the deity we find the same process  going on. The rude stock or stone was sometimes itself the actual  recipient of material offerings; or it might be painted with some bright  and pleasing colour, or wrapped in costly draperies. In most of these  customs an assumption is implied that the object of worship is pleased  by the same things as please its worshippers; and here we find the germ  of the anthropomorphic idea. It was probably the desire to make the  offerings and prayers of the worshippers perceptible to the power within  that first led to the addition of human features to the shapeless block.  Just as the early Greeks painted eyes upon the prows of their ships, to  enable them to find their way through the water, so they carved a head,  with eyes and ears, out of the sacred stone or stock, or perhaps added a  head to the original shapeless mass. We find many primitive idols in  this form--a cone or column with a head and perhaps arms and feet added  to it; and the tradition survives in the herm, or in the mask of  Dionysus attached to a post, round which we still see the Maenads  dancing on fifth-century vases. The notion that such carved eyes or ears  actually served to transmit impressions to the god is well illustrated  by Professor Petrie's discovery at Memphis of a number of votive ears of  the god, intended to facilitate or to symbolise his reception of the  prayers of his votaries. In fact, the taunt of the psalmist against the  images of the heathen--\"Eyes have they, but they see not; they have  ears, and yet they hear not\"--is not a merely rhetorical one, as it  seems to us, but real and practical, if spoken to men who gave their  gods ears and eyes that they might hear and see.    An imagination so entirely materialistic may belong to a more primitive  stage than any we can find among the Greeks. As soon as religion has  reached the polytheistic stage the gods are regarded as travelling from  image to image, just as they travel from temple to temple. Even in  AEschylus' _Eumenides_ it will be remembered that when Orestes, by the  advice of Apollo, clasps as a suppliant the ancient image of Athena at  Athens, the goddess comes flying from far away in the Troad when she  hears the sound of his calling. The exact relation of the goddess to the  image is not, in all probability, very clearly realised; but, so far as  one can trace it from the ritual procedure, what appears to be implied  is that a suppliant will have a better chance of reaching the deity he  addresses if he approaches one of the images preferred by that deity as  the abode of his power; often there is one such image preferred to all  others, as this early one of Athena at Athens. The deity was not,  therefore, regarded as immanent in any image--at least, in classical  times; the gods lived in Olympus, or possibly visited from time to time  the people whom they favoured, or went to the great festivals that were  held in their honour. But the various images of them, especially the  most ancient ones, that were set up in their temples in the various  cities of Greece were regarded as a means of communication between gods  and men. The prayer of a worshipper addressing such an image will be  transmitted to the deity whom he addresses, and the deity may even come  in person to hear him, if special aid is required. A close parallel may  be found even in modern days. I have known of a child, brought up in the  Roman Catholic religion, who had a particular veneration or affection  for a certain statue of the Virgin, and used often to address it or, as  she said, converse with it. And she said she had an impression that, if  only she could slip in unawares, she might see the Virgin Mary herself  approaching or leaving the statue, whether to be transformed into it or  merely to dwell in it for a time. On Greek vases we see the same notion  expressed as in the _Eumenides_, when a god or goddess is represented as  actually present beside the statue to which a sacrifice or prayer is  being offered.    In such a stage of religious belief or imagination it is clearly of high  importance that the image of any deity should be pleasing to that deity,  and thereby attract his presence and serve as a ready channel of  communication with him. From the point of view of art, it would seem at  first sight that the result would be a desire to make the image as  beautiful as possible, and as worthy an embodiment of the deity as the  sculptor could devise. This doubtless was the result in the finest  period of art in Greece, and it involved, as we shall see, a great deal  of reciprocal influence on the part of religion and art. But in earlier  times the case is not so simple; and even in statues of the fifth  century it is not easy to understand the conditions under which the  sculptor worked without some reference to the historical development  that lay behind him.    Before the rise of sculpture in Greece, images of the gods, some of them  only rudely anthropomorphic, had long been objects of worship; and it  was by no means safe in religious matters to depart too rashly from the  forms consecrated by tradition. This was partly owing to the feeling  that when a certain form had been accepted, and a certain means of  communication had worked for a long time satisfactorily, it was a  dangerous thing to make a change which might not be agreeable to the  powers concerned, and which might, so to speak, break the established  connection. But while hieratic conservatism tended to preserve forms and  formulae almost for what we may call magic reasons, there was also a  sentiment about the matter which gave popular support to the tendency.  Thus Pausanias probably expresses a common feeling when he says that the  images made by Daedalus, \"though somewhat strange in aspect, yet seem to  be distinguished by something in them of the divine.\"    It is true that these early images attributed to Daedalus showed already  a considerable advance on the shapeless or roughly shaped stocks or  stones that had served as the most primitive objects of worship; but it  was their resemblance to these rather than their difference from them  that impressed the imagination of Pausanias. He appreciated them not so  much as examples of an art that promised much for the future, but rather  as linked with the past by the tradition of an immemorial sanctity. We  find, in fact, that the rude early images remained the centres of state  cult and official worship, as well as of popular veneration, long after  the art of sculpture had become capable of providing their worshippers  with more adequate embodiments of the gods they represented. It was the  early image of Athena, not the Athena Parthenos by Phidias, that was  annually washed in the sea, and for which the peplos was woven by the  chosen women of Athens. The connection between art and religion is, in  such a case, reduced to narrow limits; but, on the other hand, we hear  of many instances where new statues of the gods were made as temple  statues, to be the chief objects of worship and centres of cult. And  this was sometimes done with the official sanction of the gods  themselves, as expressed through the oracle of Delphi.    The sanctity of the old image was sometimes transferred to the new one;  a striking example of this is seen in the case of Artemis Brauronia on  the Athenian Acropolis. It had been the custom for the garments  presented to the goddess by her worshippers to be placed upon her  primitive statue; and when a new and worthier representation of the  goddess was placed in the temple in the fourth century, we are informed  by inscriptions that dedicated garments were sometimes hung"]]]
