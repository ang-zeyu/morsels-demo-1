The interval was only ten minutes,  and she wished both to break the news to her old classmates and to  fetch some necessary books from her former desk before the bell rang.    The other members of the Fifth lingered behind in perturbed  consultation. They considered they had a just and most pressing  grievance. In all the annals of the school such a case had never  occurred before. It had been hitherto an inviolable though unwritten  law that no one under the age of fifteen should be admitted to the  Fifth Form, a law which they had believed as strict as that of the  Medes and Persians, and here was the headmistress actually breaking  it, and in favour of a girl only fourteen and a quarter. If Miss  Roscoe had not brought her herself into the room they would not have  credited it.    \"It's abominably unfair!\" broke out Rachel Hunter, a tall girl of  sixteen. \"Because my birthday comes on October 4th I had to stop a  whole year longer in the Lower School. Yes--though my mother came and  begged Miss Roscoe to let me go up!\"    \"Well, you couldn't get moved up on your work, at any rate, Rachel!\"  chirped Joan Masters. \"It would have had to be favour in your case.\"    \"That's not the point! It's a different question. If Miss Roscoe makes  a rule she ought to stick to it. Why, half the girls in the Form might  have come up sooner if it hadn't been for the age limit.\"    \"You're right, and I can't see why Gwen Gascoyne should be so  specially noticed.\"    \"She's supposed to be clever, I believe.\"    \"She doesn't look it! Besides, what do we care whether she's clever or  not? It's the injustice of the thing that makes me angry. A kid like  her amongst us seniors! The idea!\"    \"Miss Roscoe may send Gwen up,\" declared Louise Mawson, \"but she can't  make us accept her as one of ourselves. I vote we send her to  Coventry.\"    \"We will! She's nothing but a Lower School girl, and we won't tolerate  her being imposed upon us!\"    \"She'll be so conceited at finding herself a Senior!\"    \"We'll soon take her pride down, then!\"    \"She'll meet with a few snubs here, I'll undertake to say!\"    \"If Miss Roscoe is going to bring up all the rank and file like that  there's no credit in being in the Fifth!\"    \"It's a positive insult to the rest of us!\"    So decided Gwen's new classmates, jealous for the prestige of their  Form, and annoyed at the indignity which they considered they were  made to suffer in admitting a younger girl among their number. To Gwen  or her feelings they gave not a thought. If she met with an unpleasant  experience all the better; it might deter Miss Roscoe from repeating  the experiment. That the remove was not Gwen's fault, and therefore  that it was scarcely fair to visit the headmistress's act upon her  innocent head, did not enter into their calculations. Where they  consider their rights are concerned schoolgirls rarely hold mercy  before justice.    Meantime Gwen, who had gone to break the important tidings to the  Upper Fourth, did not find her old friends as responsive as she had  expected. They received her communication with marked coldness.    \"Why should you have been moved up, Gwen Gascoyne, and not Daisy, or  Aileen, or I?\" enquired Alma Richardson, with a distinctly aggrieved  note in her voice.    \"Miss Roscoe always favoured Gwen!\" said Eve Dawkins enviously.    \"You're six months younger than Viola Sutton, so it seems absurd you  should be put above her.\"    \"You'll be so grand now, I suppose you won't care to know us!\"    \"It's not fair to the rest of the Form!\"    \"Oh dear! I'm between two fires,\" thought Gwen, as she hastily cleared  her possessions from her old desk. \"The Fifth don't want me, and the  Fourth are horribly jealous. You're going to have a bad time, Gwen  Gascoyne, I'm afraid! I see breakers ahead! Never mind. It's a great  honour to be moved up, and Father'll be glad and sympathize, if nobody  else does. The work will be pretty stiff: I expect it'll be all I can  do to manage it. But I mean to have a jolly good try. I'll show those  girls I can do something, though I am the youngest! Oh, I say! I've  only just remembered that Winnie'll be the under-mistress. I'll have  to call her 'Miss Gascoyne' whenever I speak to her. How perfectly  idiotic! I'm sure I shall laugh. I wonder if Miss Roscoe's told her  yet? What a surprise it would be for her to come into the room and  find me there!\"    \"I wish you'd be quick, Gwen Gascoyne,\" said Eve Dawkins; \"I'm to have  your desk as soon as you've moved out. It's a nicer seat than mine.\"    \"Right-o!\" answered Gwen, piling her books on top of her big atlas.  \"You're welcome to it, I'm sure. I think you might all have seemed a  trifle more sorry to lose me! I don't see any display of pocket  handkerchiefs. No, I can't say I'm shedding tears myself unless  they're crocodile ones. Please to recollect in future, my dears, when  you speak to me, that you're addressing a member of the Upper School!  You're only little Junior girls! Ta-ta!\" and with a mock curtsy, in  process of which she nearly dropped her pile of books, Gwen retired  laughing from the Fourth Form to take her place and try her luck among  the Seniors.          CHAPTER II    The Gascoyne Girls      At fourteen and a quarter Gwen Gascoyne was at a particularly  difficult and hobbledehoy stage of her development. She was tall for  her age, and rather awkward in her manners, apt at present to be  slapdash and independent, and decidedly lacking in \"that repose which  stamps the caste of Vere de Vere\". Gwen could never keep still for  five seconds, her restless hands were always fidgeting or her feet  shuffling, or she was twisting in her chair, or shaking back a loose  untidy lock that had escaped from her ribbon. Gwen often did her hair  without the aid of a looking-glass, but when she happened to use one  the reflection of her own face gave her little cause for satisfaction.    \"I'm plain, and there's no blinking the fact,\" she confessed to  herself. \"Winnie says I'm variable, and I can look nice when I smile,  but I'm afraid no one would trouble to look at me twice. If only I  were Lesbia now, or even Beatrice! People talk about the flower of a  family--well, I expect I'm the weed, as far as appearances go! I  haven't had my fair share in the way of good looks.\"    It certainly seemed hard that Nature, which had been kind to the  Gascoynes in that respect, should have dowered her brothers and  sisters so liberally, and have left poor Gwen out in the cold. Her  bright little face had an attraction all of its own, of which she was  quite unconscious, but she was entirely accustomed to stand aside  while strangers noticed and admired her younger sister Lesbia. To do  Gwen justice, though she might lament her own plainness, it never  struck her to be jealous of the others. She was intensely proud of the  family reputation for beauty, and even if she could not include  herself among \"the handsome Gascoynes\", it certainly gave her a  reflected satisfaction to be aware of the epithet.    \"I'm like Daddy,\" she said sometimes; \"nobody ever calls him handsome,  but he's a dear all the same--the dearest dear in the world!\"    The Reverend Maurice Gascoyne was curate-in-charge of the church of  St. John the Baptist in the little fishing village of Skelwick Bay, on  the coast of the North Sea. He was rich in the possession of seven  children, but there his luck ended, for his income, as is often the  case, was in exactly inverse ratio to the size of his family.    \"The fact is, we're as poor as church mice,\" said Beatrice one day.  \"Indeed, I think we're poorer, because the mouse we saw in church last  Sunday, that scared Winnie so, was very fat and sleek and prosperous  looking, and didn't bear out the old saying at all.\"    For the last four years, ever since pretty Mrs. Maurice Gascoyne had  gently laid down the burden that had grown too heavy for her,  Beatrice had been the clever, energetic \"mother\" of the establishment.  She managed the house, and the children, and the one maid, and the  parish, and her father, all included, with a business-like capacity  far in advance of her twenty years. She was a fine-looking girl, tall  and straight-limbed and ample, with blue eyes and dark brows, and a  clear creamy skin, and that air of noble strength about her which the  Greek sculptors gave to their statues of Artemis. Though she did her  best both for home and hamlet, Beatrice often chafed against the  narrowness of her limits. It was a sore point that she had been  obliged to leave school at sixteen, and devote herself to domestic  pursuits, and while not regretting the sacrifice, she often lamented  the two years lopped off her education.    \"I'm so behind, I never could go in even for the matric. now,\" she  sighed sometimes. \"If I could have realized my ambition, I'd have  studied for a lady doctor.\"    Since the profession of medicine was utterly and entirely out of the  question, Beatrice often consoled herself by planning that when the  children were old enough to do without her, she would go as a nurse to  a big London hospital, and rise to be a ward sister, or perhaps--who  knew?--even a matron. In the meanwhile her talent for administration  had to confine itself within the bounds of the Parsonage and the  parish, where it was apt to become just a trifle dictatorial and  overbearing. It is so hard for a young, keen, ardent nature, anxious  to set the world right, to remember that infinite patience must go  hand in hand with our best endeavours, and that the time of sowing is  an utterly different season from that of harvest.    Between Gwen and Beatrice there was often friction.

There is no record so authentic as that  which is built in stone. There is none so sacred as that which attests  and illustrates the religion of our forefathers. Much of that record has  perished: enough remains to engage our reverent study and our dutiful  care. Foreign war and rapine have wasted and destroyed our heritage of  sacred places. Kelso, Jedburgh, Melrose, and Haddington fell before the  English invader. Iona was ravaged by the Dane, while yet the island  formed part of a Scandinavian diocese. Internal lawlessness and tribal  fury have wrought like disasters. Elgin, once \"the fair glory of the  land,\" stands a forlorn monument of the savagery of a Highland chief.  St. Andrews, Lindores, Perth, Paisley, and many others bear witness to  the reckless outrage which cloaked its violence under the guise of  religious zeal. Of all our spoilers this has been the most destructive.  The pretence (for it often was nothing else) of \"cleansing the  sanctuary\" not only robbed the Church of many a priceless possession,  but begat, in the popular mind, a ruthless disregard of the sacred  associations of places where generation after generation had worshipped  God, and a coarse indifference to the solemnity of His ordinances,  which made it easy for those who should have been the guardians of the  churches to let them fall, unheeded, into decay.    It is not uncommon, even yet, to find people who ought to know, and  perhaps do know, better, blaming Knox and his co-reformers for the  dilapidation and desecration of our ancient fanes. The blame belongs to  the \"rascal multitude,\" and to the rapacious laymen who were served  heirs to the properties of the despoiled Church. What is the Church the  better for their enrichment? What has religion gained by it? The  Reformed Faith could have flourished none the less graciously if its  purified doctrine had been preached, and its reasonable worship offered,  under the same roofs that had protected priest and people in the days of  Romanist error. Is the cause of pure and undefiled religion stronger in  the land because Melrose and Crossraguel and Pluscarden are desolate;  St. Andrews a roofless ruin; Iona as yet open to the Atlantic winds? Is  the voice of praise and prayer sweeter in the North because Mortlach is  effaced and Fortrose shattered, and the bells are silent which men on  the mainland used to hear when the north wind blew from Kirkwall?  Granted that ignorant superstition may have tainted the veneration in  which our fathers' holy and beautiful houses were held 400 years ago,  the iconoclasm which devastated them was not the remedy for it. The  revived interest in our old churches, which has asserted its influence  in such restorations as those of St. Giles, Dunblane, Linlithgow, St.  Vigeans, and Arbuthnott, is no revival of superstition. It is the  outcome of a more reverent spirit; of a deeper sense of the honour due  to God; of the conviction that we owe Him, in all that pertains to His  worship, the offering of our very best; and of a deeper consciousness  also of the supreme value of the Church's national position and  character, and of the duty of piously conserving whatever helps to  illustrate the historical continuity which binds its present to its  past. As regards this, nothing is so full of helpful stimulus as an  intelligent study of our ecclesiastical architecture. In it we can read  the lessons of the gradual growth of the Scottish nation from the  loosely connected tribal conditions of the ninth and tenth centuries  onwards to its consolidation under a settled monarchy; the development  of its commercial and industrial progress; its expanding relations to  the peoples of the Continent; and the vital changes in its political  life, and its religious system and belief, thence resulting. All these  have left their mark in those records which neither time nor revolution,  neglect nor violence, have been able wholly to destroy--the architecture  of our cathedrals, abbeys, and monasteries.    The primitive buildings of the early Celtic period of the Church have  long since disappeared. Their clay and wattles could not withstand the  wear and tear of time; only in a distant glen or lonely island can we  discover scattered traces of the beehive cell or simple shrine of the  anchorite or missionary. Few relics of the more substantial structures  of that time survive.    The Roman era of Church organisation superseded the Celtic; and with the  Roman dominance came the"]]]
