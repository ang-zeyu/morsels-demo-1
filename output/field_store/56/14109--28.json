I shall be glad indeed if they supply any useful information, or  lead others to the more careful study of the common every-day things  around them with a view to more kindness being shown to all living  creatures, and tender consideration for them. I trust I may feel that  this little book will then have attained its purpose. May it especially  tend to lead the young to see how this beautiful world is full of  wonders of every kind, full of evidences of the Great Creator's wisdom  and skill in adapting each created thing to its special purpose, and  from the whole realm of nature may they be taught lessons in parables,  and their hearts be led upward to God Himself, who made all things to  reflect His own perfection and glory.        \"Gem, flower, and fish, the bird, the brute,         Of every kind occult or known      (Each exquisitely form'd to suit         Its humble lot, and that alone),      Through ocean, earth, and air fulfil      Unconsciously their Maker's will.\"                                      ELIZA BRIGHTWEN.    [Illustration]        [Illustration]          REARING BIRDS FROM THE NEST.      The most delightful of all pets are the birds one has taken the pains to  rear from the nest; they never miss the freedom of outdoor life, they  hardly know what fear is, they become devotedly attached to the one who  feeds and educates them, and all their winsome ways seem developed by  the love and care which is given to them.    I strongly deprecate a whole nest being taken; one would not willingly  give the happy little parent birds the distress of finding an empty  home. After all their trouble in building, laying, sitting, and  hatching, surely they deserve the reward of bringing up their little  babes.    Too often when boys thus take a nest they simply let the young birds  starve to death from ignorance as to their proper food and not rising  early enough to feed them.    It is a different matter if, out of a family of six, one takes two to  bring up by hand--the labour of the old birds is lightened, and four  fledglings will sufficiently reward their toil.    The birds should be taken before they are really feathered, just when  the young quills begin to show, as at that stage they will not notice  the change in their diet and manner of feeding. They need to be  carefully protected from cold, kept at first in a covered basket in  flannel, and if the weather is cold they should be near a fire, as they  miss the warmth of the mother bird, especially at night.    I confess it involves a good deal of trouble to undertake the care of  these helpless little creatures. They should be fed every half-hour,  from four in the morning until late in the evening, and that for many  weeks until they are able to feed themselves.    The kind of food varies according to the bird we desire to bring up, and  it requires care to make sure that it is not too dry or too moist, and  that it has not become sour, or it will soon prove fatal, for young  birds have not the sense of older ones--they take blindly whatever is  given them.    [Illustration]          [Illustration: STARLINGS.]    DICK THE STARLING.      Few people would think a cat could possibly be a tender nurse to young  birds! but such was really the case with a very interesting bird I  possessed some years ago.    A young starling was brought up from the nest by the kind care of our  cook and the cat! Both were equally sympathetic, and pitied the little  unfledged creature, who was by some accident left motherless in his  early youth. Cook used to get up at some unheard-of hour in the morning  to feed her clamorous pet, and then would bring him down with her at  breakfast-time and consign him to pussy's care; she, receiving him with  a gentle purr of delight, would let him nestle into her soft fur for  warmth.    As Dick became feathered, he was allowed the run of the house and  garden, and used to spend an hour or so on the lawn, digging his beak  into the turf, seeking for worms and grubs, and when tired he would fly  in at the open window and career about until he could perch on my  shoulder, or go in search of his two foster-mothers in the kitchen.    His education was carried on with such success that he could soon speak  a few words very clearly. Strangers used to be rather startled by a  weird-looking bird flying in from the garden, and saying, \"Beauty dear,  puss, puss, miaow!\" But it was still more strange to see Dick sitting on  the cat's back and addressing his endearments to her in the above words.  Pussy would allow him to investigate her fur with exemplary patience,  only objecting to his inquisitive beak being applied to her eyelids to  prize them open when she was enjoying her afternoon nap. Dick's love of  water led him to bathe in most inconvenient places. One morning, when I  returned to the dining-room after a few minutes' absence, I found him  taking headers into a glass filter and scattering the contents on the  sideboard. After dinner, too, he would dive into the finger-glasses with  the same intention, and when hindered in that design would visit the  dessert dishes in succession, stopping with an emphatic \"Beauty dear!\"  at the sight of some coveted dainty, to which he would forthwith help  himself liberally.    In summer Dick had to resist considerable temptation from wild birds of  his own kind, who evidently made matrimonial overtures to him, but  though he \"camped out\" for a few nights now and then, he never seemed to  find a mate to his mind, and elected to remain a bachelor and enjoy our  society instead of that of his own kith and kin.    Dick was certainly a pattern of industrious activity, never still for  two minutes. He seemed haunted by the idea that caterpillars and grubs  existed all over the house, and his search for them was carried on under  all possible circumstances--every plait of one's dress, every  button-hole, would be inquired into by his prying little beak in case  some choice morsel might chance to be lurking there. Dick lived for a  few happy years, and then his bathing propensities most unhappily led to  his untimely death. One severely cold day in winter he was missed and  searched for everywhere, and after some hours his poor little body was  found stiff and cold in a water-tank in the stable-yard, where the ice  had been broken. He had as usual plunged in for a bath, and we can only  suppose the intense cold had caused an attack of cramp, so that he could  not get out again, and thus was drowned. Many tears were shed for the  loss of the cheery little bird, who seemed like a bright ubiquitous  sunbeam about the house, and our only consolation was the thought that,  as far as we knew, he had never had a sorrow in his life, and we can  only hope that if there are \"happy hunting-grounds\" for birds our Dick  may be there, bright and happy still.          [Illustration: FLYING STARLINGS]    RICHARD THE SECOND.      On a wet stormy day in May a young unfledged bird was blown out of its  nest and was picked up in a paved yard where, somehow, it had fallen  unhurt.    There he was found by my kind-hearted butler, who appeared with the  little shivering thing in his hand to see if I would adopt it. The  butler pleaded for it, and it squawked its own petition piteously  enough, but I was far from strong, and I knew at what very early hours  these young feathered people required to be fed. I therefore felt I  ought hardly to give up the time which sometimes brought me the precious  boon of sleep after a wakeful night. Very reluctantly I refused the  gift, and felt wretchedly hard-hearted in doing so. I will confide to my  readers that in my secret heart I thought the poor orphan was a  blackbird or thrush, and they are birds I feel ought never to be caged;  they pine and look so sadly longing for liberty; even their song has a  minor key of plaintiveness when it comes through prison bars, and this  feeling helped my decision.    A few days after I heard that the birdie was adopted in the pantry, and  was being fed \"in the intervals of business.\" When a few days later I  was definitely informed that the birdie waif was a starling, then I  confess I did begin to long for another little friend such as my former  \"Dick\" had been, and it ended in my receiving Richard the Second, as we  called him for distinction, into my own care and keeping, and month  after month I was his much-enduring mother. Most fledglings are much the  same at first; whenever I came in sight the gaping beak was ever ready  for food, and the capacity for receiving it was wonderful. Richard grew  very fast; little quills appeared and opened out into feathers; his  walking powers increased till he could make a tottering run upon the  carpet; and then he began to object to his basket and would have a perch  like a grown-up bird, practised going to sleep on one leg, which for a  long time was a downright failure and ended in constant tumbles.    He was always out of his cage whilst I was dressing, and was full of fun  and play, scheming to get his bath before I did, and running off with  anything he could carry. When he was about two months old I had to go to  Buxton for a month's visit and decided that I could not leave Richard  behind, as he needed constant feeding with little pieces of raw meat and  was just old enough to miss my training and care. He was therefore to  make his first start as a traveller, in a small cage, papered round the  sides, the top being left open for light and air. He was wonderfully  brave and good, very observant of everything, and if scared a word from  me would reassure him, until at last even an express train dashing past  did not make him start. It was very amusing to see the attention  bestowed upon him at the various stations where we"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21137"],[0,"Parkhurst Boys, and Other Stories of School Life (#2)"],[1,"as the exigencies of the scrimmage  demanded.  Thus our wedge, embodying a concentrated pressure in the  direction of the ball, the farther it advanced the farther it scattered  asunder the foe, who fell off from its gradually widening sides without  hope of getting again within reach of the ball except by retreating to  the rear and beginning the struggle over afresh.  When this manoeuvre  was well executed, it was almost certain to carry the ball through the  scrimmage, and when that happened, then was the time for us half and  quarter-backs to look out for our chance.    Our men went at it with their customary vigour and address, and  presently the ball emerged on the far side of the scrimmage.  In an  instant it was caught up by one of the Craven quarter-backs, and in an  instant our men were upon him again before he could get a start for a  run.  Scrimmage after scrimmage ensued, the ball was constantly in  Chancery, but each crush brought us a yard or so nearer the enemy's goal  than we had been before.    All this time I was little better than a spectator, for the ball never  once came within reach of my fingers, and I was beginning to think that,  after all, a big match was not so exciting a thing as one is apt to  imagine.    At last, however, after one scrimmage more desperate than any that had  gone before, the ball flew out suddenly, and bounded off one of the  Craven men into my grasp.  Now was my chance.  \"If only I could--\"    The next thing I was conscious of was that about twenty people had  fallen to the ground all of a heap, and that I and the ball were at the  bottom.    \"Down!\"  I cried.    \"Pack up there, Parkhurst!\" sang out Wright.    I extricated myself as quickly as I could, and got back to my place in  the rear, thinking to myself, after all, there _was_ some little  excitement in football.    At last the ball got well away from the scrimmage, and who should secure  it but the redoubtable Slider!  I felt a passing tremor of deep despair,  as I saw that hero spring like the wind towards our goal.    \"Look out, Adams!\" shouted Wright.    Sure enough he was coming in my direction!  With the desperation of a  doomed man I strode out to meet him.  He rushed furiously on--swerving  slightly to avoid my reach, and stretching out his arm to ward off my  grasp.  I flung myself wildly in his path.  There was a heavy thud, and  the earth seemed to jump up and strike me.  The next moment I was  sprawling on my back on the grass.  I don't pretend to know how it all  happened, but somehow or other I had succeeded in checking the onward  career of the victorious Slider; for though I had fallen half stunned  before the force of his charge, he had recoiled for an instant from the  same shock, and that instant gave time for Wright to get hold of him,  and so put an end for the time to his progress.    \"Well played!\" said some one, as I picked myself up.  So I was  comforted, and began to think that, after all, football was rather a  fine game.    Time would fail me to tell of all the events of that afternoon--how  Wright carried the ball within a dozen yards of our opponents' goal; how  their forwards passed the ball one to another, and got a \"touch-down\"  behind our line, but missed the kick; how Naylor ran twenty yards with  one of our men hanging on his back; how our quarter-back sent the ball  nearly over their goal with as neat a drop-kick as ever it has been my  lot to witness.    The afternoon was wearing.  I heard the time-keeper call out, \"Five  minutes more!\"  The partisans of either side were getting frantic with  excitement.  Unless we could secure an advantage now, we should be as  good as defeated, for the Craven had scored a \"touch-down\" to our  nothing.  Was this desperate fight to end so?  Was victory, after all,  to escape us?  But I had no time for reflection then.    \"Now, Parkhurst,\" sang out Wright, \"pull yourselves together for once!\"    A Craven man is standing to throw the ball out of \"touch,\" and either  side stands in confronting rows, impatient for the fray.  Wright is at  the end of the line, face to face with Naylor, and I am a little behind  Wright.    \"Keep close!\" exclaims the latter to me, as the ball flies towards us.    Wright has it, but in an instant Naylor's long arms are round him,  bearing him down.    \"Adams!\" ejaculates out captain, and in a trice he passes the ball into  my hands, and I am off like the wind.  So suddenly has it all been done  that I have already a yard or two start before my flight is discovered.  There is a yelling and a rush behind me; there is a roar from the crowds  on either side; there is a clear \"Follow up, Parkhurst!\" from Wright in  the rear; there is a loud \"Collar him!\" from the Craven captain ahead.  I am steering straight for their goal; three men only are between me and  it--one, their captain, right back, and Slider and another man in front  of him.    I see at a glance that my only hope is to keep as I am going and waste  no time in dodging, or assuredly the pursuing host will be upon me.  Slider and his companion are closing in right across my path, almost  close together.  With a bound I dash between them.  Have they got me, or  have I escaped them?  A shout louder than ever and a \"Bravo!\" from  Wright tell me I am clear of that danger, and have now but their last  defence to pass.  He is a tall, broad fellow, and a formidable foe to  encounter, and waits for me close under their goal.  The pace, I feel,  is telling on me; the shouting behind sounds nearer, only a few yards  divides us now.  Shall I double, shall I venture a kick, or shall I  charge straight at him?    \"Charge at him!\" sounds Wright's voice, as if in answer to my thought.  I gather up all my remaining force, and charge.  There is a flash across  my eyes, and a dull shock against my chest.  I reel and stagger, and  forget where I am.  I am being swept along in a torrent; the waters with  a roar rush past me and over me.  Every moment I get nearer and nearer  the fatal edge--I am at it--I hang a moment on the brink, and then--    \"Down!\" shouts a voice close at my ear, and there is such a noise of  cheering and rejoicing that I sit up and rub my eyes like one waking  bewildered from a strange dream.    Then I find out what has happened.  When I charged at the Craven captain  the shock sent me back staggering into the very arms of Wright and our  forwards, who were close at my heels, and who then, in a splendid and  irresistible rush, carried me and the ball and the half of the other  side along with them right behind the enemy's goal-line, where we fall  _en masse_ to the earth--I, with the ball under me, being at the bottom.    Even if I had been hurt--which I was not--there was no time to be wasted  on condolences or congratulations.  The time-keeper held his watch in  his hand, and our goal must be kicked at once, if it was to be kicked at  all.  So the fifteen paces out were measured, the \"nick\" for the ball  was carefully made, the enemy stood along their goal-line ready to  spring the moment the ball should touch the earth.  Wright, cool and  self-possessed, placed himself in readiness a yard or two behind the  ball, which one of our side held an inch off the ground.  An anxious  moment of expectation followed; then came a sharp \"Now!\" from our  captain.  The ball was placed cunningly in the nick, the Craven forwards  rushed out on it in a body, but long before they could reach it,  Wright's practised foot had sent it flying straight as an arrow over the  bar, and my first football match had ended in a glorious victory for the  Old School.    ------------------------------------------------------------------------    The terms used here describe the Rugby game as it used to be played  prior to 1880.        CHAPTER TWO.    THE PARKHURST PAPER-CHASE.    \"The meet is to be at one o'clock, sharp, in the Dean's Warren--don't  forget!\"    So said Forwood, the \"whipper-in\" of the Parkhurst Hare and Hounds Club,  to me, one March morning in the year 18--.  I had no need to be reminded  of the appointment; for this was the day of the \"great hunt\" of the  year, always held by the running set at Parkhurst School to yield in  interest to no other fixture of the athletic calendar.    In fine weather, and over good country, a paper-chase is one of the  grandest sports ever indulged in--at least, so we thought when we were  boys--and the \"great hunt\" was, of course, the grandest run of the year,  and looked forward to, consequently, with the utmost eagerness by all  lovers of running in our school.    This year, too, I had a special interest in the event, for it was my  turn to run \"hare\"--in other words, to be, with another fellow, the  object of the united pursuit of some twenty or thirty of my  schoolfellows, who would glory in running me down not a whit less than I  should glory in escaping them.    For some weeks previously we had been taking short trial runs, to test  our pace and powers of endurance; and Birch (my fellow-\"hare\") and I had  more than once surveyed the course we proposed to take on the occasion  of the \"great hunt,\" making ourselves, as far as possible, acquainted  with the bearings of several streams, ploughed fields, and high walls to  be avoided, and the whereabouts of certain gaps, woods, and hollows to  be desired.  We were glad afterwards that we had taken this precaution,  as the reader will see.    I can't say if the Parkhurst method of conducting our \"hunts\" was the  orthodox one; I know _we_ considered it was, as our rules were our own  making, or rather a legacy left to us by a former generation of runners  at the school.    We were to take, in all, a twelve miles' course, of nearly an oval  shape, six miles out and six miles home.  Any amount of dodging or  doubling was to be allowed to us hares, except crossing our own path.  We were to get five minutes' clear start, and, of course, were expected  to drop our paper \"scent\""]]]
