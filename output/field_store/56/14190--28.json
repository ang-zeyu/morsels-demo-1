The mother of Rembrandt was Neeltje Willems Van Zuitbroek, whose  portrait he has etched. As he was an only child, his parents were  anxious to give him a good education, and therefore sent him to the  Latin school at Leyden, in order to bring him up to the profession of  the law; but, like our own inimitable Shakspere, he picked up \"small  Latin and less Greek.\" Having shown an early inclination for painting,  they placed him under the tuition of Jacob Van Zwaanenburg, a painter  unmentioned by any biographer; he afterwards entered the studio of Peter  Lastman, and finally received instruction from Jacob Pinas. The two  last had visited Rome, but, notwithstanding, could have given little  instruction to Rembrandt, as their works show no proof of their having  studied the Italian school to much purpose. After receiving a knowledge  of a few rules, such as they could communicate, he returned home, and  commenced painting from nature, when he laid the foundation of a style  in art unapproached either before his time or since. In 1627 he is said,  by Houbraken, to have visited the Hague, when, by the price he received  for one of his pictures, he discovered his value as an artist. The  neighbourhood of the Rhine was now given up for the city of Amsterdam,  where he set up his easel in the year 1628, under the patronage of the  Burgomaster Six, and other wealthy admirers of the fine arts.    Rembrandt's first works, like all the early works of eminent artists,  were carefully finished; the work that raised him to the greatest  notice, in the first instance, is Professor Tulpius giving an Anatomical  Lecture on a dead Body,[1] and is dated 1632. Reynolds, in his Tour  through Flanders, speaking of this picture, says:--\"The Professor  Tulpius dissecting a corpse which lies on the table, by Rembrandt. To  avoid making it an object disagreeable to look at, the figure is just  cut at the wrist. There are seven other portraits, coloured like nature  itself; fresh, and highly finished. One of the figures behind has a  paper in his hand, on which are written the names of the rest. Rembrandt  has also added his own name, with the date 1632. The dead body is  perfectly well drawn, (a little foreshortened,) and seems to have been  just washed; nothing can be more truly the colour of dead flesh. The  legs and feet, which are nearest the eye, are in shadow; the principal  light, which is on the body, is by that means preserved of a compact  form; all these figures are dressed in black.\" He further adds--\"Above  stairs is another Rembrandt, of the same kind of subject: Professor  Nieman, standing by a dead body, which is so much foreshortened that the  hands and feet almost touch each other; the dead man lies on his back,  with his feet towards the spectator. There is something sublime in the  character of the head, which reminds one of Michael Angelo; the whole is  finely painted,--the colouring much like Titian.\"    Simeon in the Temple, in the Museum of the Hague, painted in 1631, is in  his first manner; as are The Salutation, in the Gallery of the Marquis  of Westminster, painted in 1640; and The Woman taken in Adultery, in the  National Gallery, painted in 1644, all on panel, and finished with the  care and minuteness of Gerhard Dow. His most successful career may be  taken from 1630 to 1656. About the year 1645 he married Miss Saskia Van  Uylenburg, by whom he had an only son, named Titus, the inheritor of the  little wealth left after his father's embarrassments, but, though bred  to the arts, inheriting little of his father's genius. In what part of  Amsterdam he resided at this time we have no record, nor is the house  now shown as Rembrandt's, and which was the subject of a mortgage,  sufficiently authenticated to prove its identity; he may have lived in  it, but it could not at any time have been sufficiently capacious to  contain all the effects given in the catalogue extracted from the  register by Mr. Nieuwenhuys.    The late Sir David Wilkie, in a letter to his sister, says:--\"At the  Hague we were delayed with rain, which continued nearly the whole of our  way through Leyden, Haarlem, and Amsterdam. Wherever we went, our great  subject of interest was seeing the native places of the great Dutch  painters, and the models and materials which they have immortalized.  At Amsterdam we sallied forth in the evening, in search of the house  of Rembrandt; it is in what is now the Jews' quarter, and is, in short,  a Jew's old china shop; it is well built, four stories high, but it  greatly disappointed me. The shop is high in the ceiling, but all the  other rooms are low and little, and, compared with the houses of Titian  at Venice, of Claude at Rome, and of Rubens at Antwerp, is quite  unworthy the house of the great master of the school of Holland. Even if  stuffed, as it is now, with every description of the pottery of Canton,  it could not have held even a sixth part of the inventory Nieuwenhuys  found, as the distrained effects of Rembrandt, and the only solution is,  that he may have once lived there; but as his will, still extant, is  dated in another street, and as several of the pictures he painted could  not be contained in the rooms we were in, we must conclude that, like  the shell which encloses the caterpillar, it was only a temporary abode  for the winged genius to whom art owes so much of its brilliancy.\"    As the place of his residence is veiled in obscurity, so is the place of  his demise, which is supposed to have taken place in 1664, as Mr. Smith,  in a note to his Life of Rembrandt, says--\"that no picture is recorded  bearing a later date than 1664, and the balance of his property was paid  over to his son in 1665.\"    Mr. Woodburn, in a Catalogue of his Drawings, says:--\"It is uncertain  what became of him after his bankruptcy, or where he died; a search has  been made among the burials at Amsterdam, until the year 1674, but his  name does not occur; probably Baldinucci is correct in stating that he  died at Stockholm, in 1670;\" others have mentioned Hull, and some give  a credence to his having fled to Yarmouth, during his troubles, and  mention two pictures, a lawyer and his wife, said to have been painted  there; they are whole lengths, and certainly in his later manner, but  I could not gather any authentic account to build conjecture upon, as  the intercourse between Amsterdam and Yarmouth has been kept up from  olden time, and a Dutch fair held every three years on the shore. The  ancestors of the family in whose possession they still are, may have  visited Holland; but, amongst such conflicting opinions, it is useless  to attempt elucidation of the truth of this. We may rest certain that  his works will be appreciated in proportion as a knowledge of their  excellence is extended.

Soon it arrives at the more  far-reaching inquiries--\"Why is this so?\" \"How did this happen?\" And  as the child's mental growth continues, the painstaking and  conscientious parent or guardian is many times faced by questions  which lack of knowledge, or a sensitive honesty, prevents him from  answering either with assurance or with ingenuity.    As with the child, so it has ever been with the human race. Man has  always come into the world asking \"How?\" \"Why?\" \"What?\" and so the  Hebrew, the Greek, the Maori, the Australian blackfellow, the  Norseman--in a word, each race of mankind--has formed for itself an  explanation of existence, an answer to the questions of the groping  child-mind--\"Who made the world?\" \"What is God?\" \"What made a God  think of fire and air and water?\" \"Why am I, _I_?\"    Into the explanation of creation and existence given by the Greeks  come the stories of Prometheus and of Pandora. The world, as first it  was, to the Greeks was such a world as the one of which we read in the  Book of Genesis--\"without form, and void.\" It was a sunless world in  which land, air, and sea were mixed up together, and over which  reigned a deity called Chaos. With him ruled the goddess of Night and  their son was Erebus, god of Darkness. When the two beautiful children  of Erebus, Light and Day, had flooded formless space with their  radiance, Eros, the god of Love, was born, and Light and Day and Love,  working together, turned discord into harmony and made the earth, the  sea, and the sky into one perfect whole. A giant race, a race of  Titans, in time populated this newly-made earth, and of these one of  the mightiest was Prometheus. To him, and to his brother Epimethus,  was entrusted by Eros the distribution of the gifts of faculties and  of instincts to all the living creatures in the world, and the task of  making a creature lower than the gods, something less great than the  Titans, yet in knowledge and in understanding infinitely higher than  the beasts and birds and fishes. At the hands of the Titan brothers,  birds, beasts, and fishes had fared handsomely. They were Titanic in  their generosity, and so prodigal had they been in their gifts that  when they would fain have carried out the commands of Eros they found  that nothing was left for the equipment of this being, to be called  Man. Yet, nothing daunted, Prometheus took some clay from the ground  at his feet, moistened it with water, and fashioned it into an image,  in form like the gods. Into its nostrils Eros breathed the spirit of  life, Pallas Athene endowed it with a soul, and the first man looked  wonderingly round on the earth that was to be his heritage.  Prometheus, proud of the beautiful thing of his own creation, would  fain have given Man a worthy gift, but no gift remained for him. He  was naked, unprotected, more helpless than any of the beasts of the  field, more to be pitied than any of them in that he had a soul to  suffer.    Surely Zeus, the All Powerful, ruler of Olympus, would have compassion  on Man? But Prometheus looked to Zeus in vain; compassion he had none.  Then, in infinite pity, Prometheus bethought himself of a power  belonging to the gods alone and unshared by any living creature on the  earth.    \"We shall give Fire to the Man whom we have made,\" he said to  Epimethus. To Epimethus this seemed an impossibility, but to  Prometheus nothing was impossible. He bided his time and, unseen by  the gods, he made his way into Olympus, lighted a hollow torch with a  spark from the chariot of the Sun and hastened back to earth with this  royal gift to Man. Assuredly no other gift could have brought him more  completely the empire that has since been his. No longer did he  tremble and cower in the darkness of caves when Zeus hurled his  lightnings across the sky. No more did he dread the animals that  hunted him and drove him in terror before them.    Armed with fire, the beasts became his vassals. With fire he forged  weapons, defied the frost and cold, coined money, made implements for  tillage, introduced the arts, and was able to destroy as well as to  create.    From his throne on Olympus, Zeus looked down on the earth and saw,  with wonder, airy columns of blue-grey smoke that curled upwards to  the sky. He watched more closely, and realised with terrible wrath  that the moving flowers of red and gold that he saw in that land that  the Titans shared with men, came from fire, that had hitherto been the  gods' own sacred power. Speedily he assembled a council of the gods to  mete out to Prometheus a punishment fit for the blasphemous daring of  his crime. This council decided at length to create a thing that  should for evermore charm the souls and hearts of men, and yet, for  evermore, be man's undoing.    To Vulcan, god of fire, whose province Prometheus had insulted, was  given the work of fashioning out of clay and water the creature by  which the honour of the gods was to be avenged. \"The lame Vulcan,\"  says Hesiod, poet of Greek mythology, \"formed out of the earth an  image resembling a chaste virgin. Pallas Athene, of the blue eyes,  hastened to ornament her and to robe her in a white tunic. She dressed  on the crown of her head a long veil, skilfully fashioned and  admirable to see; she crowned her forehead with graceful garlands of  newly-opened flowers and a golden diadem that the lame Vulcan, the  illustrious god, had made with his own hands to please the puissant  Jove. On this crown Vulcan had chiselled the innumerable animals that  the continents and the sea nourish in their bosoms, all endowed with a  marvellous grace and apparently alive. When he had finally completed,  instead of some useful work, this illustrious masterpiece, he brought  into the assembly this virgin, proud of the ornaments with which she  had been decked by the blue-eyed goddess, daughter of a powerful  sire.\" To this beautiful creature, destined by the gods to be man's  destroyer, each of them gave a gift. From Aphrodite she got beauty,  from Apollo music, from Hermes the gift of a winning tongue. And when  all that great company in Olympus had bestowed their gifts, they named  the woman Pandora--\"Gifted by all the Gods.\" Thus equipped for  victory, Pandora was led by Hermes to the world that was thenceforward  to be her home. As a gift from the gods she was presented to  Prometheus.    But Prometheus, gazing in wonder at the violet blue eyes bestowed by  Aphrodite, that looked wonderingly back into his own as if they were  indeed as innocent as two violets wet with the morning dew, hardened  his great heart, and would have none of her.
