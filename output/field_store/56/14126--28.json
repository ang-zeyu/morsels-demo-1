DEAR MOLLY,    Heaving this importunity, I send, my love to you and Saul, being in good  health, and hoping to hear the same from you; and that you and Saul will  take my poor kitten to bed with you this cold weather. We have been all  in, a sad taking here at Glostar--Miss Liddy had like to have run away  with a player-man, and young master and he would adone themselves a  mischief; but the squire applied to the mare, and they were, bound  over.--Mistress bid me not speak a word of the matter to any Christian  soul--no more I shall; for, we servints should see all and say nothing--  But what was worse than all this, Chowder has had the misfortune to be  worried by a butcher's dog, and came home in a terrible pickle--Mistress  was taken with the asterisks, but they soon went off. The doctor was  sent for to Chowder, and he subscribed a repository which did him great  service--thank God he's now in a fair way to do well--pray take care  of my box and the pillyber and put them under your own bed; for, I do  suppose madam, Gwyllim will be a prying into my secrets, now my back is  turned. John Thomas is in good health, but sulky. The squire gave away  an ould coat to a poor man; and John says as, how 'tis robbing him of  his perquisites.--I told him, by his agreement he was to receive  no vails; but he says as how there's a difference betwixt vails and  perquisites; and so there is for sartain. We are all going to the Hot  Well, where I shall drink your health in a glass of water, being,    Dear Molly, Your humble servant to command, W. JENKINS GLOSTAR, April  2nd.          To Sir WATKIN PHILLIPS, Bart. of Jesus college, Oxon.    DEAR PHILLIPS,    As I have nothing more at heart than to convince you I am incapable of  forgetting, or neglecting the friendship I made at college, now begin  that correspondence by letters, which you and I agreed, at parting, to  cultivate. I begin it sooner than I intended, that you may have it in  your power to refute any idle reports which may be circulated to my  prejudice at Oxford, touching a foolish quarrel, in which I have been  involved on account of my sister, who had been some time settled here  in a boarding-school. When I came hither with my uncle and aunt (who  are our guardians) to fetch her away, I found her a fine tall girl, of  seventeen, with an agreeable person; but remarkably simple, and quite  ignorant of the world. This disposition, and want of experience, had  exposed her to the addresses of a person--I know not what to call  him, who had seen her at a play; and, with a confidence and dexterity  peculiar to himself, found means to be recommended to her acquaintance.  It was by the greatest accident I intercepted one of his letters; as  it was my duty to stifle this correspondence in its birth, I made it my  business to find him out, and tell him very freely my sentiments of  the matter. The spark did not like the stile I used, and behaved with  abundance of mettle. Though his rank in life (which, by the bye, I am  ashamed to declare) did not entitle him to much deference; yet as his  behaviour was remarkably spirited, I admitted him to the privilege of  a gentleman, and something might have happened, had not we been  prevented.--In short, the business took air, I know not how, and made  abundance of noise--recourse was had to justice--I was obliged to give  my word and honour, &c. and to-morrow morning we set out for Bristol  Wells, where I expect to hear from you by the return of the post.--I  have got into a family of originals, whom I may one day attempt to  describe for your amusement. My aunt, Mrs Tabitha Bramble, is a maiden  of forty-five, exceedingly starched, vain, and ridiculous.--My uncle is  an odd kind of humorist, always on the fret, and so unpleasant in his  manner, that rather than be obliged to keep him company, I'd resign all  claim to the inheritance of his estate. Indeed his being tortured by the  gout may have soured his temper, and, perhaps, I may like him better on  further acquaintance; certain it is, all his servants and neighbours in  the country are fond of him, even to a degree of enthusiasm, the reason  of which I cannot as yet comprehend. Remember me to Griffy Price, Gwyn,  Mansel, Basset, and all the rest of my old Cambrian companions.--Salute  the bedmaker in my name--give my service to the cook, and pray take care  of poor Ponto, for the sake of his old master, who is, and ever will be,    Dear Phillips, Your affectionate friend, and humble servant, JER.  MELFORD GLOUCESTER, April 2.          To Mrs JERMYN at her house in Gloucester.    DEAR MADAM,    Having no mother of my own, I hope you will give me leave to disburden  my poor heart to you, who have always acted the part of a kind parent to  me, ever since I was put under your care. Indeed, and indeed, my worthy  governess may believe me, when I assure her, that I never harboured  a thought that was otherwise than virtuous; and, if God will give me  grace, I shall never behave so as to cast a reflection on the care you  have taken in my education. I confess I have given just cause of offence  by my want of prudence and experience. I ought not to have listened to  what the young man said; and it was my duty to have told you all that  passed, but I was ashamed to mention it; and then he behaved so modest  and respectful, and seemed to be so melancholy and timorous, that  I could not find in my heart to do any thing that should make him  miserable and desperate. As for familiarities, I do declare, I never  once allowed him the favour of a: salute; and as to the few letters that  passed between us, they are all in my uncle's hands, and I hope they  contain nothing contrary to innocence and honour.--I am still persuaded  that he is not what he appears to be: but time will discover--mean while  I will endeavour to forget a connexion, which is so displeasing to my  family. I have cried without ceasing, and have not tasted any thing but  tea, since I was hurried away from you; nor did I once close my eyes for  three nights running.--My aunt continues to chide me severely when we  are by ourselves; but I hope to soften her in time, by humility  and submission.--My uncle, who was so dreadfully passionate in the  beginning, has been moved by my tears and distress; and is now all  tenderness and compassion; and my brother is reconciled to me on my  promise to break off all correspondence with that unfortunate youth;  but, notwithstanding all their indulgence, I shall have no peace of mind  till I know my dear and ever honoured governess has forgiven her poor,  disconsolate, forlorn,    Affectionate humble servant, till death, LYDIA MELFORD CLIFTON, April 6.          To Miss LAETITIA WILLIS, at Gloucester.    MY DEAREST LETTY,    I am in such a fright, lest this should not come safe to hand by the  conveyance of Jarvis the carrier, that I beg you will write me, on the  receipt of it, directing to me, under cover, to Mrs Winifred Jenkins,  my aunt's maid, who is a good girl, and has been so kind to me in my  affliction, that I have made her my confidant; as for Jarvis, he was  very shy of taking charge of my letter and the little parcel, because  his sister Sally had like to have lost her place on my account: indeed  I cannot blame the man for his caution; but I have made it worth his  while.--My dear companion and bed-fellow, it is a grievous addition to  my other misfortunes, that I am deprived of your agreeable company and  conversation, at a time when I need so much the comfort of your good  humour and good sense; but, I hope, the friendship we contracted at  boarding-school, will last for life--I doubt not but on my side it will  daily increase and improve, as I gain experience, and learn to know the  value of a true friend. O, my dear Letty! what shall I say about poor  Mr Wilson? I have promised to break off all correspondence, and, if  possible, to forget him: but, alas! I begin to perceive that will not be  in my power. As it is by no means proper that the picture should remain  in my hands, lest it should be the occasion of more mischief, I have  sent it to you by this opportunity, begging you will either keep it safe  till better times, or return it to Mr Wilson himself, who, I suppose,  will make it his business to see you at the usual place. If he should be  low-spirited at my sending back his picture, you may tell him I have no  occasion for a picture, while the original continues engraved on my--But  no; I would not have you tell him that neither; because there must be an  end of our correspondence--I wish he may forget me, for the sake of  his own peace; and yet if he should, he must be a barbarous--But it is  impossible--poor Wilson cannot be false and inconstant: I beseech  him not to write to me, nor attempt to see me for some time; for,  considering the resentment and passionate temper of my brother Jery,  such an attempt might be attended with consequences which would make  us all miserable for life--let us trust to time and the chapter of  accidents; or rather to that Providence which will not fail, sooner or  later, to reward those that walk in the paths of honour and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21614"],[0,"For the Temple: A Tale of the Fall of Jerusalem (#2)"],[1,"eat figs, and get yourself cool, all at  the same time. The sun will be down in another half hour, and then  I shall be free to amuse you.\"    \"Amuse me, indeed!\" the girl said indignantly, as she sat down on  the bank to which John had pointed. \"You mean that I shall amuse  you; that is what it generally comes to. If it wasn't for me I am  sure, very often, there would not be a word said when we are out  together.\"    \"Perhaps that is true,\" John agreed; \"but you see, there is so much  to think about.\"    \"And so you choose the time when you are with me to think! Thank  you, John! You had better think, at present,\" and, rising from the  seat she had just taken, she walked back to the house again,  regardless of John's explanations and shouts.    Old Isaac chuckled, on his tree close by.    \"They are ever too sharp for us, in words, John. The damsel is  younger than you, by full two years; and yet she can always put you  in the wrong, with her tongue.\"    \"She puts meanings to my words which I never thought of,\" John  said, \"and is angered, or pretends to be--for I never know which it  is--at things which she has coined out of her own mind, for they  had no place in mine.\"    \"Boys' wits are always slower than girls',\" the old man said. \"A  girl has more fancy, in her little finger, than a boy in his whole  body. Your cousin laughs at you, because she sees that you take it  all seriously; and wonders, in her mind, how it is her thoughts run  ahead of yours. But I love the damsel, and so do all in the house  for, if she be a little wayward at times, she is bright and loving,  and has cheered the house since she came here.    \"Your father is not a man of many words; and Martha, as becomes her  age, is staid and quiet, though she is no enemy of mirth and  cheerfulness; but the loss of all her children, save you, has  saddened her, and I think she must often have pined that she had  not a girl; and she has brightened much since the damsel came here,  three years ago.    \"But the sun is sinking, and my basket is full. There will be  enough for the maids to go on with, in the morning, until we can  supply them with more.\"    John's basket was not full, but he was well content to stop and,  descending their ladders, the three returned to the house.    Simon of Gadez--for that was the name of his farm, and the little  fishing village close by, on the shore--was a prosperous and  well-to-do man. His land, like that of all around him, had come  down from father to son, through long generations; for the law by  which all mortgages were cleared off, every seven years, prevented  those who might be disposed to idleness and extravagance from  ruining themselves, and their children. Every man dwelt upon the  land which, as eldest son, he had inherited; while the younger  sons, taking their smaller share, would settle in the towns or  villages and become traders, or fishermen, according to their bent  and means.    There were poor in Palestine--for there will be poor, everywhere,  so long as human nature remains as it is; and some men are idle and  self indulgent, while others are industrious and thrifty--but,  taking it as a whole there were, thanks to the wise provisions of  their laws, no people on the face of the earth so generally  comfortable, and well to do. They grumbled, of course, over the  exactions of the tax collectors--exactions due, not to the  contribution which was paid by the province to imperial Rome, but  to the luxury and extravagance of their kings, and to the greed and  corruption of the officials. But in spite of this, the people of  rich and prosperous Galilee could have lived in contentment, and  happiness, had it not been for the factions in their midst.    On reaching the house, John found that his father had just returned  from Hippos, whither he had gone on business. He nodded when the  lad entered, with his basket.    \"I have hired eight men in the market, today, to come out tomorrow  to aid in gathering in the figs,\" he said; \"and your mother has  just sent down, to get some of the fishermen's maidens to come in  to help her. It is time that we had done with them, and we will  then set about the vintage. Let us reap while we can, there is no  saying what the morrow will bring forth.    \"Wife, add something to the evening meal, for the Rabbi Solomon Ben  Manasseh will sup with us, and sleep here tonight.\"    John saw that his father looked graver than usual, but he knew his  duty as a son too well to think of asking any questions; and he  busied himself, for a time, in laying out the figs on trays--knowing  that, otherwise, their own weight would crush the soft fruit before  the morning, and bruise the tender skins.    A quarter of an hour later, the quick footsteps of a donkey were  heard approaching. John ran out and, having saluted the rabbi, held  the animal while his father assisted him to alight and, welcoming  him to his house, led him within. The meal was soon served. It  consisted of fish from the lake, kid's flesh seethed in milk, and  fruit.    Only the men sat down; the rabbi sitting upon Simon's right hand,  John on his left, and Isaac and his son at the other end of the  table. Martha's maids waited upon them, for it was not the custom  for the women to sit down with the men and, although in the country  this usage was not strictly observed, and Martha and little Mary  generally took their meals with Simon and John, they did not do so  if any guest was present.    In honor of the visitor, a white cloth had been laid on the table.  All ate with their fingers; two dishes of each kind being placed on  the table--one at each end. But few words were said during the  meal. After it was concluded, Isaac and his son withdrew and,  presently, Martha and Mary, having taken their meal in the women's  apartments, came into the room. Mary made a little face at John, to  signify her disapproval of the visitor, whose coming would compel  her to keep silent all the evening. But though John smiled, he made  no sign of sympathy for, indeed, he was anxious to hear the news  from without; and doubted not that he should learn much, from the  rabbi.    Solomon Ben Manasseh was a man of considerable influence in  Galilee. He was a tall, stern-looking old man, with bushy black  eyebrows, deep-set eyes, and a long beard of black hair, streaked  with gray. He was said to have acquired much of the learning of the  Gentiles, among whom, at Antioch, he had dwelt for some years; but  it was to his powers as a speaker that he owed his influence. It  was the tongue, in those days, that ruled men; and there were few  who could lash a crowd to fury, or still their wrath when excited,  better than Solomon Ben Manasseh.    For some time they talked upon different subjects: on the corn  harvest and vintage, the probable amount of taxation, the marriage  feast which was to take place, in the following week, at the house  of one of the principal citizens of Hippos, and other matters. But  at last Simon broached the subject which was uppermost in all their  thoughts.    \"And the news from Tiberias, you say, is bad, rabbi?\"    \"The news from Tiberias is always bad, friend Simon. In all the  land there is not a city which will compare with it, in the  wrongheadedness of its people and the violence of its seditions;  and little can be hoped, as far as I can see, so long as our good  governor, Josephus, continues to treat the malefactors so  leniently. A score of times they have conspired against his life  and, as often, has he eluded them; for the Lord has been ever with  him. But each time, instead of punishing those who have brought  about these disorders, he lets them go free; trusting always that  they will repent them of their ways, although he sees that his  kindness is thrown away, and that they grow even bolder and more  bitter against him after each failure.    \"All Galilee is with him. Whenever he gives the word, every man  takes up his arms and follows him and, did he but give the order,  they would level those proud towns Tiberias and Sepphoris to the  ground, and tear down stone by stone the stronghold of John of  Gischala. But he will suffer them to do nothing--not a hair of  these traitors' heads is to be touched; nor their property, to the  value of a penny, be interfered with.    \"I call such lenity culpable. The law ordains punishment for those  who disturb the people. We know what befell those who rebelled  against Moses. Josephus has the valor and the wisdom of King David;  but it were well if he had, like our great king, a Joab by his  side, who would smite down traitors and spare not.\"    \"It is his only fault,\" Simon said. \"What a change has taken place,  since he was sent hither from Jerusalem to take up our government!  All abuses have been repressed, extortion has been put down, taxes  have been lightened. We eat our bread in peace and comfort, and  each man's property is his own. Never was there such a change as he  has wrought and, were it not for John of Gischala, Justus the son  of Piscus, and Jesus the son of Sapphias, all would go quietly and  well; but these men are continually stirring up the people--who, in  their folly, listen to them--and conspiring to murder Josephus, and  seize upon his government.\"    \"Already he has had, more than once, to reduce to submission  Tiberias and Sepphoris; happily without bloodshed for, when the  people of these cities saw that all Galilee was with Josephus, they  opened their gates and submitted themselves to his mercy. Truly, in  Leviticus it is said:    \"'Thou shalt not avenge, nor bear any grudge against the children  of thy people; but thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.'    \"But Josephus carries this beyond reason. Seeing that his  adversaries by no means observe this law, he should remember that  it is also said that 'He that taketh the sword shall fall by the  sword,' and that the law lays down punishments for the transgressors.
