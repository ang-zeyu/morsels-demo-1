The intercourse was hostile and  left traces of blood; and to this may be attributed the absence of the  natives when Furneaux appeared on the coast.    [1777.] The descriptions of Cook are founded on his own observations,  and are, on the whole, favorable to the natives. The English, while  wooding and watering, were surprised by the visit of eight men and a  boy. They were unarmed, except that one of them carried a stick, pointed  at the end. They were of middling stature, slender, and naked. On  different parts of their bodies were ridges, both straight and curved,  raised in the skin: the hair of the head and beard was smeared with red  ointment. They were indifferent to presents; they rejected bread, and  the flesh of the sea elephant, but accepted some birds, which they  signified their intention to eat. Cook prevailed on a native to throw  the stick at a mark thirty yards distant, but he failed after repeated  trial. The Otaheitian, Omai,[1] to exhibit his skill, fired off a  musket: at the report they fled, and so great was their fear, that they  dropped the axe and knives they had received.    A dead calm retarded the departure of the vessels next day, and the  parties sent ashore, were accompanied by Cook. About twenty natives soon  joined them: one, who was conspicuously deformed, amused them by the  drollery of his gestures, and the seeming humour of his speeches. Some,  wore three or four folds round the neck, made of fur; and round the  ancles a slip of the skin of kangaroo. Captain Cook returned to the  vessel, leaving Lieutenant King in charge: soon after, the women and  children arrived: they were introduced by the men to the English. The  children were thought pretty; of the beauty of the women the account was  not equally favorable. They rejected with disdain the presents and  freedoms of the officers, and were ordered by an elderly man to  retire--a command, to which they submitted with reluctance.    Dr. Anderson, the surgeon of the _Resolution_, describes the natives as  a mild, cheerful race, with an appearance less wild than is common to  savages. He considered them devoid of activity, genius, and  intelligence; their countenance, he delineates as plump and pleasing.    [1792.] But though later on the spot, assisted by the remarks of  previous observers, Labillardiere, of all, was the most assiduous and  exact. The naturalist of D'Entrecasteaux's expedition, he saw mankind  with the eye of a philosopher. He was pleased to examine the passions of  a race, least of all indebted to art; yet the prevailing notions of  Citizen Frenchmen, perhaps, gave him a bias, when estimating an  uncivilised people. He left Europe when the dreams of Rousseau were the  toys of the speculative, and before they became the phantoms of the  populace. His observations were, doubtlessly, correct; but his grouping  is artistic, and not without illusion. In his work, the Tasmanian blacks  appear in the most charming simplicity, harmless and content; an  extraordinary remnant of primitive innocence. At first they fled from  the French: an old woman they chased, took a leap which, if credible,  was terrific; she dashed over a precipice forty feet high, and was lost  among the rocks!    Labillardiere having landed, with several companions, proceeded towards  a lake; hearing human voices, they followed the direction of the sound;  the sudden cry of the natives induced them to return for their arms.  Then proceeding towards the woods, they met the tribe--the men and boys  in a semicircle, with the women and children behind. Labillardiere  offered a piece of biscuit, and held out his hand, which a savage chief  accepted, and smiling drew back one foot, and bowed with admirable  grace. He gave to the French a necklace, which he called _cantaride_,  formed of wilk shells, in exchange for articles of dress, a poll-axe,  and knives.    The proportions are worth remarking: in a party of forty, there were  eight men and seven women; of forty-eight, there were ten men and  fourteen women. Thus the females were most numerous, and the rising  generation nearly one-third more than the adults. They were generally  healthy; one only suffered from cutaneous disease, one from a defect of  vision, and several from slight wounds. It will be told, that a sad  reverse was afterwards their fate. The French, supposing they subsisted  on fish, expected to find leprosy, and concluded, not that other food  was procured, but that the doctors were mistaken. The women and girls  were the fishers: they plunged amidst sea weed, and raised the shell  fish from rocks by the spatula. They killed the cray fish before  landing. They could endure the water twice as long as Europeans. In the  intervals of diving they roasted their spoil, and warmed themselves  between two fires; sometimes feeding their children, or themselves. Thus  they continued alternately fishing and cooking, until all were  satisfied.    The men seemed indolent; nothing could persuade them to dive: they  sauntered about, with the right hand passed behind, and holding the left  fore-arm in its grasp. As the elders moved with gravity on the beach,  the girls romped and raced with the seamen--repelling, without  resenting, their rudeness. They were sprightly and voluble, and chatted  on without intermission. On one occasion they were missed, when, turning  to a tree, they were seen perched naked in the branches, about nine feet  from the ground: an interesting group, remarks the naturalist.    In the incidents of their social life, he saw their character. The  children cried! their mothers soothed them with those maternal caresses,  which art has not improved. They held them to be decorated by the  French, and placed them in their arms. A father corrected a little boy  for the ancient diversion of throwing stones at another, and the culprit  wept! A lad concealed a basket from a seaman, to amuse by his perplexity  and its dexterous replacement! The clothes given by the French they hung  on the bushes, but they valued the tin ware, the axes and saws. The  liberality of their visitors induced them to take more than was given;  but they seemed unconscious of offence, and whatever was required they  restored without reluctance. A girl, refusing the French a skin they  desired to possess, retreated to the woods: her friends were distressed  at her ill-nature. She, at last, complied. A pair of trousers were given  in exchange; she stood between two Frenchmen, leaning on the shoulder of  each, while they guided her errant legs into these novelties of Europe.    Their refusal of food, for themselves and children, was from distaste  rather than distrust; and they only discovered suspicion, when the  French penetrated the country. They posted a guard, to give notice of  any movement, and when an attempt was made, it was interrupted by the  loud screams of the women, and the entreaties of the men. They resisted  the intrusion with displeasure, and even menace.    On other occasions, they tended on the French with great kindness,  removing fallen branches from their path; and when the ground was  sloping and slippery, they walked beside them, and held them up.[2] They  rested every half mile, saying _medi_, \"sit down;\" then rising again,  after a few minutes' rest.    They themselves first saw the French: who, having travelled several  miles, lay down for the night near a brook: their fires betrayed them. A  native, next morning, pointed to their resting place: laid his head on  his hand, and closed his eyes. The good-nature of these people never  languished: twice, when the French lost their way, they directed them to  their ships. They welcomed their visits by raising their hands over  their heads, shouting and stamping on the ground. They greeted them as  often as their wanderings brought them in sight of the vessels, and with  the same friendly sounds bade them adieu.    [1798.] We owe to Captain Flinders and Dr. Bass the next description of  the natives. They were saluted by voices from the hills which border the  Derwent; one of these they ascended and saw a man, and two women, who,  catching up their baskets, scampered away. The man met them with  confidence: they tried, in vain, to converse with him in the dialects of  New Holland. They desired him to lead them to his hut; but he hesitated,  and moved slowly in the direction to which he had pointed. Consulting  his apparent feelings they desisted, and parted in friendship. This was  the first man they had seen in the island. His countenance, they  describe as unusually benignant; his features less negro-like than  common, and his manners frank and open. He exhibited neither curiosity  nor fear, nor did he seem attracted by any part of their dress, except  their cravats!    Mr. Bass made several expeditions into the country, attended only by his  dogs, and meeting no inhabitants he concluded that their numbers were  inconsiderable.    The accounts descriptive of native customs, by these authorities, are  full of errors; but they are the errors of inference, not of  observation: it is useless to repeat, in order to correct them. The  colonists have possessed better opportunities, and their acquaintance  with aboriginal habits supplies more accurate information, than could be  expected in the volumes of navigators.    Such as we have given, is their testimony to the social aspect of the  native character: nothing unfavorable is omitted. In a people so gentle  and affable, it is difficult to recognise the race afterwards covered  with sores, wasted by want and vice, or animated with revenge; and who  filled the colony with disgust and terror.

Then we have Agni the Fire-god, and Soma  the spirit of the intoxicating juice of the soma-plant, which is used  to inspire the pious to drunken raptures in certain ceremonies; both  of these have acquired a peculiar importance through their association  with priestly worship, especially Agni, because he, as bearing to the  gods the sacrifices cast into his flames, has become the ideal Priest  and divine Paraclete of Heaven. Nevertheless all this hieratic  importance has not made them gods in the deeper sense, reigning in the  hearts of men. Then we find powers of doubtful origin, Mitra and  Varuna and Vishnu and Rudra, and figures of heroic legend, like the  warrior Indra and the twin charioteers called Asvinaa and Nasatya. All  these, with many others, have their worship in the Rig-veda: the  priests sing their praises lustily, and often speak now of one deity,  now of another, as being the highest divinity, without the least  consistency.    Some savage races believe in a highest god or first divine Being in  whom they feel little personal interest. They seldom speak of him, and  hardly ever worship him. So it seems to be with Dyaush-pita. The  priests speak of him and to him, but only in connexion with other  gods; he has not a single whole hymn in his honour, and the only  definite attribute that attaches to him is that of fatherhood. Yet he  has become a great god among other races akin in speech to the Aryans  of India: Dyaush-pita is phonetically the same as the Greek [Greek:  Zeus pater] and the Latin _Iuppiter_. How comes it then that he is  not, and apparently never was, a god in the true sense among the  Indian Aryans? Because, I think, his name has always betrayed him. To  call a deity \"Sky-father\" is to label him as a mere abstraction. No  mystery, no possibility of human personality, can gather round those  two plain prose words. So long as a deity is known by the name of the  physical agency that he represents, so long will he be unable to grow  into a personal God in India. The priests may sing vociferous psalms  to Vayu the Wind-spirit and Surya the Sun-spirit, and even to their  beloved Agni the Fire-god; but sing as much as they will, they never  can make the people in general take them to their hearts.    Observe what a different history is that of Zeus among the  Greeks--Zeus, Father of Gods and Men, the ideal of kingly majesty and  wisdom and goodness. The reason is patent. Ages and ages before the  days when the Homeric poets sang, the Greeks had forgotten that Zeus  originally meant \"sky\": it had become to them a personal name of a  great spiritual power, which they were free to invest with the noblest  ideal of personality. But very likely there is also another reason: I  believe that the Olympian Zeus, as modelled by Homer and accepted by  following generations, was not the original [Greek: _Zeus pater_] at  all, but a usurper who had robbed the old Sky-father of his throne and  of his title as well, that he was at the outset a hero-king who some  time after his death was raised to the seat and dignity of the old  Sky-father and received likewise his name. This theory explains the  old hero-sagas which are connected with Zeus and the strange fact that  the Cretans pointed to a spot in their island where they believed Zeus  was buried. It explains why legends persistently averred that Zeus  expelled his father Kronos from the throne and suppressed the Titan  dynasty: on my view, Kronos was the original Father Zeus, and his name  of Zeus and rank as chief god were appropriated by a deified hero.  How natural such a process was in those days may be seen from the  liturgy of Unas on the pyramids at Sakkarah in Egypt.[2] Here Unas  is described as rising in heaven after his death as a supreme god,  devouring his fathers and mothers, slaughtering the gods, eating their  \"magical powers,\" and swallowing their \"spirit-souls,\" so that he thus  becomes \"the first-born of the first-born gods,\" omniscient,  omnipotent, and eternal, identified with the Osiris, the highest god.  Now this Unas was a real historical man; he was the last king of the  Fifth Dynasty, and was deified after death, just like any other king  of Egypt. The early Egyptians, like many savage tribes, regarded all  their kings as gods on earth and paid them formal worship after their  death; the later Egyptians, going a step further, worshipped them even  in their lifetime as embodiments of the gods.[3] What is said in the  liturgy for the deification of Unas is much the same as was said of  other kings. The dead king in early Egypt becomes a god, even the  greatest of the gods, and he assumes the name of that god[4]; he  overcomes the other gods by brute force, he kills and devours them.  This is very like what I think was the case with Zeus; the main  difference is that in Egypt the _character_ of the deified king was  merged in that of the old god, and men continued to regard the latter  in exactly the same light as before; but among the forefathers of the  Greeks the reverse happened in at least one case, that of Zeus, where  the character of a hero who had peculiarly fascinated popular  imagination partly eclipsed that of the old god whose name and rank he  usurped. The reason for this, I suppose, is that even the early  Egyptians had already a conservative religion with fixed traditions  and a priesthood that forgot nothing,[5] whereas among the forefathers  of the Greeks, who were wandering savages, social order and religion  were in a very fluid state. However that may be, a deified hero might  oust an older god and reign under his name; and this theory explains  many difficulties in the legends of Zeus.    [Footnote 2: Sir E. A. W. Budge, _Literature of the Ancient  Egyptians_, p. 21 ff., and _Gods of the Egyptians_, i, pp. 32 f., 43.]    [Footnote 3: Erman, _Handbook of Egyptian Religion_, p. 37 f.]    [Footnote 4: Budge, _Lit. of the Egyptians_, p. 21; Erman, _ut supra_,  p. 37 f.]    [Footnote 5: It is even possible that in one case, that of Osiris, a  hero in Egypt may have eclipsed by his personality the god whom he  ousted. See Sir J. W. Frazer's _Adonis, Attis, Osiris_, ii, p. 200,  and Sir W. Ridgeway's _Dramas and Dramatic Dances, etc._, p. 94 ff.]    As to the Roman Iuppiter, I need not say much about him. Like all the  genuine gods of Latium, he never was much more than an abstraction  until the Greeks came with their literature and dressed him in the  wardrobe of their Zeus.    Coming now to Ushas, the Lady of the Dawn, and looking at her name  from the standpoint of comparative philosophy, we see that the word  _ushas_ is closely connected with the Greek [Greek: heos] and the  Latin _aurora_. But when we read the literature, we are astonished to  find that while the Greek Dawn-lady has remained almost always a mere  abstraction, the Indian spirit is a lovely, living woman instinct with  the richest sensuous charms of the East. Some twenty hymns are  addressed to her, and for the most part they are alive with real  poetry, with a sense of beauty and gladness and sometimes withal an  under-note of sadness for the brief joys of life. But when we look  carefully into it we notice a curious thing: all this hymn-singing to  Ushas is purely literary and artistic, and there is practically no  religion at all at the back of it. A few stories are told of her, but  they seem to convince no one, and she certainly has no ritual worship  apart from these hymns, which are really poetical essays more than  anything else. The priestly poets are thrilled with sincere emotion at  the sight of the dawn, and are inspired by it to stately and lively  descriptions of its beauties and to touching reflections upon the  passing of time and mortal life; but in this scene Ushas herself is  hardly more than a model from an artist's studio, in a very Bohemian  quarter. More than once on account of her free display of her charms  she is compared to a dancing girl, or even a common harlot! Here the  imagination is at work which in course of time will populate the Hindu  Paradise with a celestial _corps de ballet_, the fair and frail  Apsarasas. Our Vedic Ushas is a forerunner of that gay company. A  charming person, indeed; but certainly no genuine goddess.    As his name shows, Surya is the spirit of the sun. We hear a good deal  about him in the Rig-veda, but the whole of it is merely description  of the power of the sun in the order of nature, partly allegorical,  and partly literal. He is only a nature-power, not a personal god. The  case is not quite so clear with Savita, whose name seems to mean  literally \"stimulator,\" \"one who stirs up.\" On the whole it seems most  likely that he represents the sun, as the vivifying power in nature,  though some[6] think that he was originally an abstraction of the  vivifying forces in the world and later became connected with the sun.  However this may be, Savita is and remains an impersonal spirit with  no human element in his character.    [Footnote 6: See Oldenberg, _Religion des Veda_, p. 64 f.]    Still more perplexing are the two deities Mitra and Varuna, who are  very often associated with one another, and apparently are related.  Mitra certainly is an old god: if we go over the mountains to the west  and north-west of the country of our Indian Aryans, we shall find  their kinsmen in Persia and Bactria worshipping him as a power that  maintains the laws of righteousness and guards the sanctity of oaths  and engagements, who by means of his watchmen keeps mankind under his  observation and with his terrible weapons crushes evil powers. The  Indian Aryans tell almost exactly the same tale of their Mitra and his  companion Varuna, who perhaps is simply a doublet of Mitra with a  different name, which perhaps is due to a variety of worship. But they  have more to say of Varuna than of Mitra. In Varuna we have the  highest ideal of"]]]
