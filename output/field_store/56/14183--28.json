Photogravures, for instance, may be put at the end of the book, or they  may be covered with a piece of opaque tissue paper, so that either their  page or the facing type-page will be seen alone. We cannot do without  illustrations. All mankind love a picture as they love a lover. But let  the pictures belong to the book and not merely be thrust into it.    The binding is to the book what the book is to its subject-matter, a  clothing and protection. In the middle ages, when books were so few as  to be a distinction, they were displayed sidewise, not edgewise, on the  shelves, and their covers were often richly decorated, sometimes with  costly gems. Even the wooden cover of the pre-Columbian Mexican book had  gems set in its corners. Modern ornamentation is confined to tooling,  blind and gilt, and inlaying. But some booklovers question whether any  decoration really adds to the beauty of the finest leather. It should be  remembered that the binding is not all on the outside. The visible cover  is only the jacket of the real cover on which the integrity of the book  depends. The sewing is the first element in time and importance. To be  well bound a book should lie open well, otherwise it is bound not for  the reader but only for the collector.    It cannot be too often repeated that properly made books are not  extremely costly. A modern book offered at a fancy price means either a  very small edition, an extravagant binding, or what is more likely, a  gullible public. But most books that appeal to the booklover are not  excessive in price. Never before was so much money spent in making books  attractive--for the publisher always has half an eye on the  booklover--and while much of this money is wasted, not all is laid out  in vain. Our age is producing its quota of good books, and these the  booklover makes it his business to discover.    In order to appreciate, the booklover must first know. He must be a  book-kenner, a critic, but one who is looking for excellencies rather  than faults, and this knowledge there are many books to teach him. But  there is no guide that can impart the love of books; he must learn to  love them as one learns to love sunsets, mountains, and the ocean, by  seeing them. So let him who would know the joys and rewards of the  booklover associate with well-made books. Let him begin with the  ancients of printing, the great Germans, Italians, Dutchmen. He can  still buy their books if he is well-to-do, or see them in libraries and  museums if he belongs to the majority. Working down to the moderns, he  will find himself discriminating and rejecting, but he will be attracted  by certain printers and certain periods in the last four hundred years,  and he will be rejoiced to find that the last thirty years, though  following a decline, hold their own--not by their mean but by their  best--with any former period short of the great first half-century,  1450-1500.    Finally, if his book-love develops the missionary spirit in him, let him  lend his support to the printers and publishers of to-day who are  producing books worthy of the booklover's regard, for in no other way  can he so effectually speed the day when all books shall justify the  emotion which more than five hundred years ago Richard de Bury, Bishop  of Durham, expressed in the title of his famous and still cherished  work, the _Philobiblon_.          FITNESS IN BOOK DESIGN      \"A woman's fitness comes by fits,\" said slanderous Cloten; but to say as  much of fitness in book design would be on the whole a compliment.  Fitness as applied to book design means, of course, that the material  form of the book shall correspond to its spiritual substance, shall be  no finer and no meaner, and shall produce a like, even if a slighter,  esthetic impression. At the outset we have to surrender to commercialism  more than half our territory. All agree that our kings should be clothed  in purple and our commoners in broadcloth; but how about the  intellectual riffraff that makes up the majority of our books? Are our  publishers willing that these should be clothed according to their  station? Hardly; for then would much of their own occupation be gone. It  is recognized that for a large proportion of our publications the  design--the outward appearance--is in great measure counted on to sell  the book; and printers and publishers will not consent to send the  paupers of literature forth upon the world in their native rags, for so  they would find no one to welcome them. It will be useless to quarrel  with the fact that the design of many books is meant as a bait and not  as a simple interpretation of their meaning and worth. Design of this  character, however, is relatively easy; it is really not design at all,  but millinery. It is when his work becomes genuinely interpretative that  the designer's difficulties begin.    The first business of the designer, therefore, is to understand the book  he is treating. Here, of course, his judgment, however sincere, may be  mistaken or misled. A classical instance of this is found in connection  with one of the most famous books in the history of modern  printing,--Barlow's \"Columbiad.\" This work, which first appeared in 1787  under a different title, was enlarged to epic proportions during the  next twenty years, and was finally given to the world in 1807 in the  belief on the part of its author and in the hope at least on the part of  its publisher that it would take rank and be honored for all time as the  great American epic. Under this misconception the book was clothed in a  form that might worthily have enshrined \"Paradise Lost.\" Its stately  quarto pages were set in a type specially designed for the work and  taking from it the name of Columbian. The volume was embellished with  full-page engravings after paintings in the heroic manner by Smirke; in  short, it was the most pretentious book issued in America up to that  time, and it still ranks, in the words of Professor Barrett Wendell,  \"among the most impressive books to look at in the world.\" But alas for  the vanity of human aspirations! \"The Columbiad\" is now remembered as a  contribution to typography rather than literature. The designer overshot  his author.    We have tacitly assumed that a book has but one interpretation and  therefore but one most appropriate design. This, however, is far from  the truth. When, after various more or less successful editions of  Irving's \"Knickerbocker\" had appeared, Mr. Updike brought out some  twenty years ago his comic edition, with the whole make-up of the book  expressive of the clumsy and stupid Dutchmen depicted in Irving's  mock-heroic, we felt at the moment that here was the one ideal  \"Knickerbocker.\" Yet, much as we still admire it, does it wholly  satisfy us? Is there not as much room as ever for an edition that shall  express primarily not the absurdity of its subject-matter, but the  delicate playfulness of Irving's humor and the lightness and grace of  his exuberant style? Has there ever been a final \"Don Quixote\"?  Certainly not in the recent monumental editions with their quagmire of  footnotes. Moreover, if _we_ had a final edition of the great romance it  would not remain final for our children's children. Every age will make  its own interpretations of the classics and will demand that they be  embodied in contemporary design. Thus every age in its book design  mirrors itself for future admiration or contempt.    Obviously, in giving form to a single work a designer is freer than in  handling a series by one or by various authors. In such cases he must  seize upon more general and therefore less salient characteristics. The  designer of \"Hiawatha\" or \"Evangeline\" has a fairly clear task before  him, with a chance of distinct success or failure; but the designer of  an appropriate form for the whole series of Longfellow's works, both  prose and poetry, has a less individualized problem, and must think of  the elements that run through all,--sweetness, grace, gentleness,  dignity, learning. Yet, though general, these qualities in a series may  be far from vague. We have only to consider the absurdity of a  handy-volume Gibbon or a folio Lamb. On looking at the bulky,  large-type, black-covered volumes of the Forman edition of Shelley and  Keats one instinctively asks, \"What crime did these poets commit that  they should be so impounded?\" The original edition of the life of  Tennyson by his son, in two lumbering, royal octavo volumes, comes near  to what Thackeray called the Farnese Hercules, \"a hulking abortion.\"  Contrast with it the dignity linked with charm of the original edition  of Longfellow's life by his brother. But of all monstrosities of book  design the British three-volume novel mania is responsible for some of  the worst. Henry Ward Beecher's one novel, \"Norwood,\" which appeared in  America becomingly clad in a single volume, received in England the  regulation three-volume dress, in which it looks as ridiculously  inflated as did a slender miss of that period in the crinoline then in  vogue. There is one abomination in book design for which I owe a  personal grudge to commercialism, and that is the dropsical book form  given to Locker-Lampson's \"My Confidences.\" If ever there was a winsome  bit of writing it is this, and it should have made a book to take to  one's heart, something not larger than a \"Golden Treasury\" volume, but  of individual design. My comfort is that this will yet be done, and my  belief is that art will justify itself better in the market than  commercialism did. A more modern instance of expansion for commercial  reasons defeating fitness in design is furnished by Waters' translation  of \"The Journal of Montaigne's Travels.\" Here we have three small  volumes outwardly attractive, but printed on paper thick enough for  catalogue cards, and therefore too"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22607"],[0,"The Book-Hunter in London (#2)"],[1,"ISTIE, BOOK-COLLECTOR                   303      THE LATE FREDERICK LOCKER-LAMPSON                        312      PORTRAIT BOOKPLATE OF MR.

Completeness, moreover, would  be an impossibility, even in a volume devoted entirely to modern men._    _The greatest possible care has been taken to prevent inaccuracy of any  kind, but whilst freedom from error is a consummation which every author  desires, it is also one of which few can boast. The reader will be doing  the author a favour by informing him of any mistake which may be  detected in the following pages. An omission in the account of Stewart,  the founder of Puttick's, may be here made good: he had the privilege of  selling David Garrick's choice library in 1823.

The author has freely availed himself of the  information in the works of Dibdin, Nichols, and other writers on the  subject, but their statements have been verified whenever possible, and  acknowledgements have been made in the proper places to the authorities  laid under contribution._                                                         _W. R._    86, GROSVENOR ROAD, S.W.          INTRODUCTION.      IT would be quite as great a fallacy to assume that a rich man is also a  wise one, as to take for granted that he who has accumulated a large  library is necessarily a learned man. It is a very curious fact, but  none the less a fact, that just as the greatest men have the shortest  biographies, so have they been content with the smallest libraries.  Shakespeare, Voltaire, Humboldt, Comte, Goethe had no collection of  books to which the term library could fairly be applied. But though each  preferred to find in Nature and in Nature's handiworks the mental  exercise which less gifted men obtain from books, that did not prevent  them from being ardent book-lovers. Shakespeare--to mention one  only--must have possessed a Plutarch, a Stowe, a Montaigne, and a Bible,  and probably half a dozen other books of less moment. And yet, with this  poor show, he was as genuine a book-lover as Ben Jonson or my Lord  Verulam. Lord Burleigh, Grotius, and Bonaparte are said to have carried  their libraries in their pockets, and doubtless Shakespeare could have  carried his under his arm.    If all great men have not been book-collectors in the manner which is  generally understood by the phrase, it is certain that they have,  perhaps without a single exception, been book-lovers. They appear, for  the most part, to have made a constant companion of some particularly  favourite book; for instance, St. Jerome slept with a copy of Aristotle  under his pillow; Lord Clarendon had a couple of favourites, Livy and  Tacitus; Lord Chatham had a good classical library, with an especial  fondness for Barrow; Leibnitz died in a chair with the 'Argenis' of  Barclay in his hand; Kant, who never left his birthplace, Koenigsburg,  had a weakness in the direction of books of travel. 'Were I to sell my  library,' wrote Diderot, 'I would keep back Homer, Moses, and  Richardson.' Sir W. Jones, like many other distinguished men, loved his  Caesar. Chesterfield, agreeing with Callimachus, that 'a great book is a  great evil,' and with La Fontaine--         'Les longs ouvrages me font peur        Loin j'epuiser une matiere        Il faut n'en prendre que la fleur'--    hated ponderous, prosy, pedantic tomes. Garrick had an extensive  collection on the history of the stage, but Shakespeare was his only  constant friend. Gibbon was a book-collector more in the sense of a man  who collects books as literary tools than as a bibliophile. But it is  scarcely necessary just now to enter more fully into the subject of  great men who were also book-lovers. Sufficient it is, perhaps, to know  that they have all felt the blessedness of books, for, as Washington  Irving in one of his most lofty sentences has so well put it, 'When all  that is worldly turns to dross around us, these [the comforts of a  well-stored library] only retain their steady value; when friends grow  cold, and the converse of intimates languishes into vapid civility and  commonplace, _these_ only continue the unaltered countenance of happier  days, and cheer us with that true friendship which never deceived hope  nor deserted sorrow.'    It is infinitely easier to name those who have collected books in this  vast and unwieldy London of ours, than it is to classify them. To adopt  botanical phraseology, the _genus_ is defined in a word or two, but the  species, the varieties, the hybrids, and the seedlings, how varied and  impossible their classification! Most men have bought books, some have  read a few, and others many; but beyond this rough grouping together we  shall not attempt anything. One thing, however, the majority of  book-collectors agree in, and that is in regarding their own generation  as a revolution--they have, as Butler has described it in his picture of  an antiquary, 'a great value for that which is past and gone, like the  madman that fell in love with Cleopatra.'    Differing in many, and often material, points as one book-collector does  from another, the entire passion for collecting may be said to focus  itself into two well-defined grooves. A man either collects books for  his own intellectual profit, or out of pure ostentatious vanity. In the  ensuing pages there will be found ample and material facts in regard to  the former, so that we may say here all that we have to say regarding  the latter. The second type of book-enthusiast has two of the most  powerful factors in his apparently reckless career--his own book-greed,  and the bookseller who supplies and profits by him.    'What do you think of my library?' the King of Spain once asked Bautru,  the French wit, as he showed him the collection at the Escurial, at that  time in the charge of a notoriously ignorant librarian.    'Your Majesty's library is very fine,' answered Bautru, bowing low; 'but  your Majesty ought to make the man who has charge of it an officer of  the Treasury.'    'And why?' queried the King.    'Because,' replied Bautru, 'the librarian of your Majesty seems to be a  man who never touches that which is confided to him.'    There are many varieties of the ignorant collector type. The most  fruitful source is the _nouveau riche_. Book-collecting is greatly a  matter of fashion; and most of us will remember what Benjamin Franklin  said of this prevailing vice: 'There are numbers that, perhaps, fear  less the being in hell, than out of the fashion.' The enterprising  individual who, on receipt of a catalogue of medical books, wired to the  bookseller, 'What will you take for the lot?' and on a price being  quoted, again telegraphed, 'Send them along,' was clearly a person who  wished to be fashionable. Another characteristically amusing  illustration of this type of book-collector is related by an  old-established second-hand bookseller, who had bought at a country sale  some two or three hundred volumes in a fair condition. But they were  principally old sermons, or, what is worse, theology and political  economy. He placed a sample lot outside his shop, leaving the bulk of  the stock untouched. The little parcel attracted the attention of a  stylishly dressed man, who entered the shop and said, 'I'll take these  books, and, say, have you any more of this kind with this shield onto  them?' pointing to the bookplate attached, which bore the arms and name  of a good old county family. 'That box, sir, is full of books from the  same house, and probably every book has the same bookplate, but I have  not yet had time to examine them.' 'What's yer figger for them, any way?  See here, I start back to Chicago to-morrow, and I mean to"]]]
