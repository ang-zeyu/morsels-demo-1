PROVIDENTIAL PREPARATIONS FOR THE DISCOVERY OF AMERICA--SPIRITUAL  REVIVAL THROUGHOUT CHRISTENDOM, AND ESPECIALLY IN THE CHURCH OF SPAIN.      The heroic discovery of America, at the close of the fifteenth century  after Christ, has compelled the generous and just admiration of the  world; but the grandeur of human enterprise and achievement in the  discovery of the western hemisphere has a less claim on our admiration  than that divine wisdom and controlling providence which, for reasons  now manifested, kept the secret hidden through so many millenniums, in  spite of continual chances of disclosure, until the fullness of time.    How near, to \"speak as a fool,\" the plans of God came to being defeated  by human enterprise is illustrated by unquestioned facts. The fact of  medieval exploration, colonization, and even evangelization in North  America seems now to have emerged from the region of fanciful conjecture  into that of history. That for four centuries, ending with the  fifteenth, the church of Iceland maintained its bishops and other  missionaries and built its churches and monasteries on the frozen coast  of Greenland is abundantly proved by documents and monuments. Dim but  seemingly unmistakable traces are now discovered of enterprises, not  only of exploration and trade, but also of evangelization, reaching  along the mainland southward to the shores of New England. There are  vague indications that these beginnings of Christian civilization were  extinguished, as in so many later instances, by savage massacre. With  impressive coincidence, the latest vestige of this primeval American  Christianity fades out in the very year of the discovery of America by  Columbus.[2:1]    By a prodigy of divine providence, the secret of the ages had been kept  from premature disclosure during the centuries in which, without knowing  it, the Old World was actually in communication with the New. That was  high strategy in the warfare for the advancement of the kingdom of God  in the earth. What possibilities, even yet only beginning to be  accomplished, were thus saved to both hemispheres! If the discovery of  America had been achieved four centuries or even a single century  earlier, the Christianity to be transplanted to the western world would  have been that of the church of Europe at its lowest stage of decadence.  The period closing with the fifteenth century was that of the dense  darkness that goes before the dawn. It was a period in which the  lingering life of the church was chiefly manifested in feverish  complaints of the widespread corruption and outcries for \"reformation of  the church in head and members.\" The degeneracy of the clergy was  nowhere more manifest than in the monastic orders, that had been  originally established for the express purpose of reviving and purifying  the church. That ancient word was fulfilled, \"Like people, like priest.\"  But it was especially in the person of the foremost official  representative of the religion of Jesus Christ that that religion was  most dishonored. The fifteenth century was the era of the infamous  popes. By another coincidence which arrests the attention of the reader  of history, that same year of the discovery by Columbus witnessed the  accession of the most infamous of the series, the Borgia, Alexander VI.,  to his short and shameful pontificate.    Let it not be thought, as some of us might be prone to think, that the  timeliness of the discovery of the western hemisphere, in its relation  to church history, is summed up in this, that it coincided with the  Protestant Reformation, so that the New World might be planted with a  Protestant Christianity. For a hundred years the colonization and  evangelization of America were, in the narrowest sense of that large  word, Catholic, not Protestant. But the Catholicism brought hither was  that of the sixteenth century, not of the fifteenth. It is a most  one-sided reading of the history of that illustrious age which fails to  recognize that the great Reformation was a reformation _of_ the church  as well as a reformation _from_ the church. It was in Spain itself, in  which the corruption of the church had been foulest, but from which all  symptoms of \"heretical pravity\" were purged away with the fiercest zeal  as fast as they appeared,--in Spain under the reign of Ferdinand and  Isabella the Catholic,--that the demand for a Catholic reformation made  itself earliest and most effectually felt. The highest ecclesiastical  dignitary of the realm, Ximenes, confessor to the queen, Archbishop of  Toledo, and cardinal, was himself the leader of reform. No changes in  the rest of Christendom were destined for many years to have so great  an influence on the course of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2017"],[0,"Dhammapada, a Collection of Verses; Being One of the Canonical Books of the (#2)"],[1," travels even against the wind; a good man pervades every place.    55. Sandal-wood or Tagara, a lotus-flower, or a Vassiki, among these  sorts of perfumes, the perfume of virtue is unsurpassed.    56. Mean is the scent that comes from Tagara and sandal-wood;--the  perfume of those who possess virtue rises up to the gods as the highest.    57. Of the people who possess these virtues, who live without  thoughtlessness, and who are emancipated through true knowledge, Mara,  the tempter, never finds the way.    58, 59. As on a heap of rubbish cast upon the highway the lily will  grow full of sweet perfume and delight, thus the disciple of the truly  enlightened Buddha shines forth by his knowledge among those who are  like rubbish, among the people that walk in darkness.          Chapter V. The Fool    60. Long is the night to him who is awake; long is a mile to him who is  tired; long is life to the foolish who do not know the true law.    61. If a traveller does not meet with one who is his better, or  his equal, let him firmly keep to his solitary journey; there is no  companionship with a fool.    62. \"These sons belong to me, and this wealth belongs to me,\" with such  thoughts a fool is tormented. He himself does not belong to himself; how  much less sons and wealth?    63. The fool who knows his foolishness, is wise at least so far. But a  fool who thinks himself wise, he is called a fool indeed.    64. If a fool be associated with a wise man even all his life, he will  perceive the truth as little as a spoon perceives the taste of soup.    65. If an intelligent man be associated for one minute only with a wise  man, he will soon perceive the truth, as the tongue perceives the taste  of soup.    66. Fools of little understanding have themselves for their greatest  enemies, for they do evil deeds which must bear bitter fruits.    67. That deed is not well done of which a man must repent, and the  reward of which he receives crying and with a tearful face.    68. No, that deed is well done of which a man does not repent, and the  reward of which he receives gladly and cheerfully.    69. As long as the evil deed done does not bear fruit, the fool thinks  it is like honey; but when it ripens, then the fool suffers grief.    70. Let a fool month after month eat his food (like an ascetic) with the  tip of a blade of Kusa grass, yet he is not worth the sixteenth particle  of those who have well weighed the law.    71. An evil deed, like newly-drawn milk, does not turn (suddenly);  smouldering, like fire covered by ashes, it follows the fool.    72. And when the evil deed, after it has become known, brings sorrow to  the fool, then it destroys his bright lot, nay, it cleaves his head.    73. Let the fool wish for a false reputation, for precedence among the  Bhikshus, for lordship in the convents, for worship among other people!    74. \"May both the layman and he who has left the world think that this  is done by me; may they be subject to me in everything which is to be  done or is not to be done,\" thus is the mind of the fool, and his desire  and pride increase.    75. \"One is the road that leads to wealth, another the road that leads  to Nirvana;\" if the Bhikshu, the disciple of Buddha, has learnt this,  he will not yearn for honour, he will strive after separation from the  world.          Chapter VI. The Wise Man (Pandita)    76. If you see an intelligent man who tells you where true treasures are  to be found, who shows what is to be avoided, and administers reproofs,  follow that wise man; it will be better, not worse, for those who follow  him.    77. Let him admonish, let him teach, let him forbid what is  improper!--he will be beloved of the good, by the bad he will be hated.    78. Do not have evil-doers for friends, do not have low people for  friends: have virtuous people for friends, have for friends the best of  men.    79. He who drinks in the law lives happily with a serene mind: the sage  rejoices always in the law, as preached by the elect (Ariyas).    80. Well-makers lead the water (wherever they like); fletchers bend the  arrow; carpenters bend a log of wood; wise people fashion themselves.    81. As a solid rock is not shaken by the wind, wise people falter not  amidst blame and praise.    82. Wise people, after they have listened to the laws, become serene,  like a deep, smooth, and still lake.    83. Good people walk on whatever befall, the good do not prattle,  longing for pleasure; whether touched by happiness or sorrow wise people  never appear elated or depressed.    84. If, whether for his own sake, or for the sake of others, a man  wishes neither for a son, nor for wealth, nor for lordship, and if he  does not wish for his own success by unfair means, then he is good,  wise, and virtuous.    85. Few are there among men who arrive at the other shore (become  Arhats); the other people here run up and down the shore.    86. But those who, when the law has been well preached to them, follow  the law, will pass across the dominion of death, however difficult to  overcome.    87, 88. A wise man should leave the dark state (of ordinary life), and  follow the bright state (of the Bhikshu). After going from his home to  a homeless state, he should in his retirement look for enjoyment where  there seemed to be no enjoyment. Leaving all pleasures behind, and  calling nothing his own, the wise man should purge himself from all the  troubles of the mind.    89. Those whose mind is well grounded in the (seven) elements of  knowledge, who without clinging to anything, rejoice in freedom from  attachment, whose appetites have been conquered, and who are full of  light, are free (even) in this world.          Chapter VII. The Venerable (Arhat).    90. There is no suffering for him who has finished his journey, and  abandoned grief, who has freed himself on all sides, and thrown off all  fetters.    91. They depart with their thoughts well-collected, they are not happy  in their abode; like swans who have left their lake, they leave their  house and home.    92. Men who have no riches, who live on recognised food, who have  perceived void and unconditioned freedom (Nirvana), their path is  difficult to understand, like that of birds in the air.    93. He whose appetites are stilled, who is not absorbed in enjoyment,  who has perceived void and unconditioned freedom (Nirvana), his path is  difficult to understand, like that of birds in the air.    94. The gods even envy him whose senses, like horses well broken in by  the driver, have been subdued, who is free from pride, and free from  appetites.    95. Such a one who does his duty is tolerant like the earth, like  Indra's bolt; he is like a lake without mud; no new births are in store  for him.    96. His thought is quiet, quiet are his word and deed, when he has  obtained freedom by true knowledge, when he has thus become a quiet man.    97. The man who is free from credulity, but knows the uncreated, who has  cut all ties, removed all temptations, renounced all desires, he is the  greatest of men.    98. In a hamlet or in a forest, in the deep water or on the dry land,  wherever venerable persons (Arhanta) dwell, that place is delightful.    99. Forests are delightful; where the world finds no delight, there the  passionless will find delight, for they look not for pleasures.          Chapter VIII. The Thousands    100. Even though a speech be a thousand (of words), but made up of  senseless words, one word of sense is better, which if a man hears, he  becomes quiet.    101. Even though a Gatha (poem) be a thousand (of words), but made up of  senseless words, one word of a Gatha is better, which if a man hears, he  becomes quiet.    102. Though a man recite a hundred Gathas made up of senseless words,  one word of the law is better, which if a man hears, he becomes quiet.    103. If one man conquer in battle a thousand times thousand men, and if  another conquer himself, he is the greatest of conquerors.    104, 105. One's own self conquered is better than all other people; not  even a god, a Gandharva, not Mara with Brahman could change into defeat  the victory of a man who has vanquished himself, and always lives under  restraint.    106. If a man for a hundred years sacrifice month after month with a  thousand, and if he but for one moment pay homage to a man whose soul is  grounded (in true knowledge), better is that homage than sacrifice for a  hundred years.    107. If a man for a hundred years worship Agni (fire) in the forest, and  if he but for one moment pay homage to a man whose soul is grounded  (in true knowledge), better is that homage than sacrifice for a hundred  years.    108. Whatever a man sacrifice in this world as an offering or as an  oblation for a whole year in order to gain merit, the whole of it is  not worth a quarter (a farthing); reverence shown to the righteous is  better.    109. He who always greets and constantly reveres the aged, four things  will increase to him, viz. life, beauty, happiness, power.    110. But he who lives a hundred years, vicious and unrestrained, a life  of one day is better if a man is virtuous and reflecting.    111. And he who lives a hundred years, ignorant and unrestrained, a life  of one day is better if a man is wise and reflecting.    112. And he who lives a hundred years, idle and weak, a life of one day  is better if a man has attained firm strength.    113. And he who lives a hundred years, not seeing beginning and end, a  life of one day is better if a man sees beginning and end.    114. And he who lives a hundred years, not seeing the immortal place, a  life of one day is better if a man sees the immortal place.    115. And he who lives a hundred years, not seeing the highest law, a  life of one day is better if a man sees the highest law.          Chapter IX. Evil    116. If a man would hasten towards the good, he should keep his thought  away from evil; if a man does what is good "]]]
