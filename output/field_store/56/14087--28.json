Under Louis XV the drama had been transformed into parades--parades  which were of as much importance to the people as to those who took  part in them. The spectators, hitherto silent, now began to hiss and be  moved. The scene of the comedy was changed, and the play was continued  among the spectators. The old theatre became an ante-chamber or a  dressing-room, and was no longer important except in connection with the  Cardinal de Bernis and the Duc de Richelieu, or Madame de Pompadour and  Madame du Barry.    The monarchy had still a step to take towards its downfall. It had  already created the _Pare aux Cerfs_ (Louis XV's seraglio), but had  not yet descended to the Parisian house of prostitution. It made this  descent leaning on the arm of Madame du Barry. Madame du Barry was a  moral sister to Manon Lescaut, but instead of taking herself off to  Louisiana to repent, she plunged into the golden whirlpool at Versailles  as a finish to her career. Could the coaches of a King mean more than  the ordinary carriage of an abandoned girl?    Jeanne Vaubernier--known in the bagnios by the name of Mademoiselle  Lange--was born at Vaucouleurs, as was Jeanne d'Arc. Better still, this  later Jeanne said openly at Versailles--dared she say otherwise?--  that she was descended in a straight line from the illustrious, the  venerated, the august, sacred, national maid, Jeanne.* \"Why did Du Barry  come to Paris?'\" says Leon Gozlan in that account of the Chateau de  Lucienne which makes a brilliant and learned chapter in the history of  France. \"Does one ever know precisely why things are done? She obeyed  the magnet which attracts to Paris all who in themselves have a title to  glory, to celebrity, or to misfortune. Du Barry had a pretty, provincial  face, bright and charming, a face astonished at everything, hair soft  and ash-colored, blue eyes, veiled and half open, and a skin fair with  rose tints. She was a child of destiny. Who could have said, when she  crossed the great town in her basket cart, which rolled lazily along  on its massive, creaking wheels, that some day she would have equipages  more beautiful than any of those which covered her with mud in passing,  and on her arms more laces and diamonds than any of these ladies  attended by footmen in liveries?\"         *A claim which blithely ignored the fact that Jeanne d'Arc       had no children.--Transcriber    When Jeanne left the provinces to come to Paris, she found her native  country. She was granted the freedom of the city, and expanded in  her joy like a delicate plant transplanted into a hothouse. She found  herself at home for the first time; and felt that she could rule as a  despot over all frequenters of the streets. She learned fashion and  love at one and the same time. Gourdan had a hat made for her, and, as  a reward, initiated her into the customs. But she was called to other  destinies.    One day, when she was walking in the Tuileries, a lunatic--and lunatics  have second sight--asked her favor when she should become queen. Du  Barry said to herself: \"This man is mad.\" But then she thought of the  Pompadour, blushed--it was the only time--and turned her eyes towards  Versailles.    But Versailles was an unhoped-for shore to such a girl as this, a girl  known to all Paris. Would the King care to be the lover of one who had  ruled all his courtesans? Who could say? The King often wearied of what  he had. Had not a poet already been found who compared her to Venus:         O Jeanne, thy beauty seduces       And charms the whole world;       In vain does the duchess redden       And the princess growl;       They know that Venus rides proudly       The foam of the wave.    The poet, while not Voltaire, was no less a man than Bouffiers.    While the King was seeking a mistress--a nocturnal reverse of Diogenes,  fleeing from the lanterns of the wise--he found Jeanne Vaubernier. He  thought he could love her for one evening. \"Not enough,\" said she, \"you  must love me until broad daylight.\" So he loved her for a whole day.  What should one eat in order to be loved by royalty? Was it necessary to  have a coat of arms? She had them in number, because "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20839"],[0,"The Mountain Chant, A Navajo Ceremony (#2)"],[1,"es, I will, out of  deference to a national prejudice, frequently refer to the ceremony as a  dance.    3. Sometimes the collective rites and amusements of the last night are  spoken of as ilnasjÃ­ngo qaÃ§Ã l, or chant in the dark circle of branches,  from _il_, branches of a tree; _nas_, surrounding, encircling; _jin_,  dark; and _go_, in. The name alludes to the great fence of piÃ±on  branches, erected after sunset on the last night, to receive the guests  and performers. I shall often refer to this inclosure as the corral.  Some white men call the rites I describe the \"corral dance,\" but more  usually they call them the \"hoshkÃ wn dance,\" from one of the minor  performances of the last night, the hackÃ n-inÃ§Ã¡`, or act of the _Yucca  baccata_, a rite or drama which seems to particularly excite the  Caucasian interest. To such minor acts the terms inÃ§Ã¡` and alÃ¬li are  applied; these may be translated dance, show, act, or exhibition.    4. The purposes of the ceremony are various. Its ostensible reason for  existence is to cure disease; but it is made the occasion for invoking  the unseen powers in behalf of the people at large for various purposes,  particularly for good crops and abundant rains. It would appear that it  is also designed to perpetuate their religious symbolism. Some of the  shows of the last night are undoubtedly intended to be dramatic and  entertaining as well as religious, while the merely social element of  the whole affair is obvious. It is an occasion when the people gather to  have a jolly time. The patient pays the expenses and, probably in  addition to the favor and help of the gods and the praise of the  priesthood, hopes to obtain social distinction for his liberality.    5. This, like other great rites of the Navajo, is of nine days'  duration. Some of these rites may take place in the summer; but the  great majority of them, including this dsilyÃ­dje qaÃ§Ã l, may be  celebrated only in the winter, in the season when the thunder is silent  and the rattlesnakes are hibernating. Were they to tell of their chief  gods or relate their myths of the ancient days at any other time, death  from lightning or snake-bite would, they believe, be their early fate.    6. While in New Mexico I sometimes employed a very liberal minded  Navajo, named Juan, as a guide and informant. He had spent many years  among Americans, Mormons, and Mexicans, and was, I imagined, almost  perfectly emancipated from his \"early bias.\" He spoke both English and  Spanish fairly. On one occasion, during the month of August, in the  height of the rainy season, I had him in my study conversing with him.  In an unguarded moment, on his part, I led him into a discussion about  the gods of his people, and neither of us had noticed a heavy storm  coming over the crest of the ZuÃ±i Mountains, close by. We were just  talking of EstsÃ¡natlehi, the goddess of the west, when the house was  shaken by a terrific peal of thunder. He rose at once, pale and  evidently agitated, and, whispering hoarsely, \"Wait till Christmas; they  are angry,\" he hurried away. I have seen many such evidences of the deep  influence of this superstition on them.    7. When the man (or the woman) who gives the entertainment concludes he  is sick and that he can afford to call a shaman, it is not the latter  who decides what particular rites are best suited to cure the malady. It  is the patient and his friends who determine this. Then they send for a  man who is known to be skilled in performing the desired rites, and it  is his province merely to do the work required of him.    8. Before beginning to describe the ceremonies it will be well to relate  the myth accounting for their origin.          MYTH OF THE ORIGIN OF DSILYÃDJE QAÃÃL.      9. Many years ago, in the neighborhood of Dsilyi`-qojÃ²ni, in the Carrizo  Mountains, dwelt a family of six: the father, the mother, two sons, and  two daughters. They did not live all the time in one locality, but moved  from place to place in the neighborhood. The young men hunted rabbits  and wood rats, for it was on such small animals that they all subsisted.  The girls spent their time gathering various wild edible seeds.    10. After a time they went to a place called Tse`-biÃ§Ã Ã¯ (the Wings of  the Rock or Winged Rock), which lies to the east of the Carrizo  Mountains, on a plain. When they first encamped there was no water in  the vicinity and the elder brother went out to see if he could find  some. He observed from the camp a little sandy hillock, covered with  some vegetation, and he determined to see what sort of plants grew  there. Arrived there, he noticed a spot where the ground was moist. He  got his digging stick and proceeded to make a hole in the ground. He had  not dug long when the water suddenly burst forth in great abundance and  soon filled the excavation he had made. He hastened back to the camp and  announced his success. When they left the Carrizo Mountains it was their  intention to go to [Â¢]epÃ©ntsa, the La Plata Mountains, to hunt for food,  and their halt at Tse`-biÃ§Ã Ã¯ was designed to be temporary only; but, now  that they had found abundance of water, the elder brother counseled them  not to hasten on, but to remain where they were for a while. The spring  he developed still exists and is known to the Navajo as ÃobinÃ kis, or  the One-Eyed Water.    11. The spring was some distance from the camp, and they had but one  wicker water bottle; so the woman, to lighten her labor, proposed that  they should move their goods to the vicinity of the spring, as it was  her task to draw the water. But the old man counseled that they should  remain where they were, as materials for building were close at hand and  it was his duty to erect the hut. They argued long about it; but at  length the woman prevailed, and they carried all their property down  close to the spring. The elder son suggested that it would be well to  dig into the soft sandy soil, in order to have a good shelter; so the  old man selected a sandy hillock, overgrown with grease-wood, and  excavated it near one edge, digging straight down, so as to have a wall  on one side.    12. They had a stone ax-head, with a groove in it. Around this they bent  a flexible twig of oak and tied it with the fibers of the yucca, and  thus they made a handle. The first day after the spring was found the  young men went out and chopped all day, and in the evening brought home  four poles, and while they were gone the old man dug in the hillock. The  next day the young men chopped all day, and at night returned with four  more poles, while their father continued his digging. They worked thus  for four days, and the lodge was finished. They made mats of hay to lie  on and a mat of the same material to hang in the doorway. They made mats  of fine cedar bark with which to cover themselves in bed, for in those  days the Navajo did not weave blankets such as they make now. The soles  of their moccasins were made of hay and the uppers of yucca fibers. The  young men were obliged to go hunting every day; it was only with great  labor they could keep the house supplied with meat; for, as has been  said, they lived mostly on small animals, such as could be caught in  fall traps. These traps they set at night near the burrows, and they  slept close to the traps when the latter were set far from home. They  hunted thus for four days after the house was finished, while their  sisters scoured all the country round in search of seeds.    13. With all their work they found it hard to make a living in this  place. The land was barren; even rats and prairie dogs were scarce, and  the seed bearing plants were few. At the end of the fourth day they held  a consultation, and the old man said they would do better to move on to  the San Juan River, where food was more abundant, and they could trap  and gather seeds as they traveled. They determined to leave, and next  morning broke camp. They journeyed on till they reached the banks of the  San Juan. Here they found abundance of tciltcin (fruit of _Rhus  aromatica_) and of grass seeds, and they encamped beside the river at  night.    14. Next day they traveled up the stream to a place called Tse`Ã§qÃ ka,  and here again they halted for the night. This place is noted for its  deposits of native salt. The travelers cut some out from under a great  rock and filled with it their bags, made out of the skins of the  squirrels and other small animals which they had captured. Thence they  followed up the river to Tse`Â¢ezÃ¡` (Rock Sticking Up), and thence to  ÃisyÃ -qojÃ²ni (Beautiful Under the Cottonwoods), where they remained a  day and killed two rabbits. These they skinned, disemboweled, crushed  between two stones, bones and all, so that nothing might be lost, put  them into an earthen pot to boil, and when they were sufficiently cooked  they added some powdered seeds to make a thick soup; of all this they  made a hearty meal. The Navajo then had neither horses nor asses; they  could not carry stone metates when they traveled, as they do now; they  ground their seeds with such stones as they could find anywhere. The old  man advised that they should cross the river at this point and he  directed his sons to go to the river and look for a ford. After a time  they returned and related that they had found a place where the stream  was mostly knee deep, and where, in the deepest part, it did not come  above their hips, and they thought all would be able to cross there. The  father named the hour of bihilÃ§Ã²higi (when it gets warm, i.e., about 10  a.m.), on the morrow, as the time they should ford the San Juan; so  next morning at the appointed time they crossed. They traveled up the  north bank until they came to a small affluent whose source was in  [Â¢]epÃ©ntsa. Here they left the main river and followed the branch until  night approached, when they made camp.    15. They moved on next day and came close to [Â¢"]]]
