These yards, especially those of carriers' inns, were admirably suited  to dramatic representations, consisting as they did of a large open  court surrounded by two or more galleries. Many examples of such  inn-yards are still to be seen in various parts of England; a picture  of the famous White Hart, in Southwark, is given opposite page 4 by  way of illustration. In the yard a temporary platform--a few boards,  it may be, set on barrel-heads[1]--could be erected for a stage; in  the adjacent stables a dressing-room could be provided for the actors;  the rabble--always the larger and more enthusiastic part of the  audience--could be accommodated with standing-room about the stage;  while the more aristocratic members of the audience could be  comfortably seated in the galleries overhead. Thus a ready-made and  very serviceable theatre was always at the command of the players; and  it seems to have been frequently made use of from the very beginning  of professionalism in acting.    [Footnote 1: \"Thou shalt not need to travel with thy pumps full of  gravel any more, after a blind jade and a hamper, and stalk upon  boards and barrel-heads.\" (_Poetaster_, III, i.)]    One of the earliest extant moralities, _Mankind_, acted by strollers  in the latter half of the fifteenth century, gives us an interesting  glimpse of an inn-yard performance. The opening speech makes distinct  reference to the two classes of the audience described above as  occupying the galleries and the yard:         O ye sovereigns that sit, and ye brothers that stand right       up.    The \"brothers,\" indeed, seem to have stood up so closely about the  stage that the actors had great difficulty in passing to and from  their dressing-room. Thus, Nowadays leaves the stage with the request:         Make space, sirs, let me go out!    New Gyse enters with the threat:         Out of my way, sirs, for dread of a beating!    While Nought, with even less respect, shouts:         Avaunt, knaves! Let me go by!    Language such as this would hardly be appropriate if addressed to the  \"sovereigns\" who sat in the galleries above; but, as addressed to the  \"brothers,\" it probably served to create a general feeling of good  nature. And a feeling of good nature was desirable, for the actors  were facing the difficult problem of inducing the audience to pay for  its entertainment.    This problem they met by taking advantage of the most thrilling moment  of the plot. The Vice and his wicked though jolly companions, having  wholly failed to overcome the hero, Mankind, decide to call to their  assistance no less a person than the great Devil himself; and  accordingly they summon him with a \"Walsingham wystyle.\" Immediately  he roars in the dressing-room, and shouts:         I come, with my legs under me!    There is a flash of powder, and an explosion of fireworks, while the  eager spectators crane their necks to view the entrance of this  \"abhomynabull\" personage. But nothing appears; and in the expectant  silence that follows the actors calmly announce a collection of money,  facetiously making the appearance of the Devil dependent on the  liberality of the audience:         _New Gyse._ Now ghostly to our purpose, worshipful sovereigns,       We intend to gather money, if it please your negligence.       For a man with a head that of great omnipotence--         _Nowadays_ [_interrupting_]. Keep your tale, in goodness, I       pray you, good brother!         [_Addressing the audience, and pointing towards the       dressing-room, where the Devil roars again._]         He is a worshipful man, sirs, saving your reverence.       He loveth no groats, nor pence, or two-pence;       Give us red royals, if ye will see his abominable presence.         _New Gyse._ Not so! Ye that may not pay the one, pay the other.    And with such phrases as \"God bless you, master,\" \"Ye will not say  nay,\" \"Let us go by,\" \"Do them all pay,\" \"Well mote ye fare,\" they  pass through the audience gathering their groats, pence, and twopence;  after which they remount the stage, fetch in the Devil, and continue  their play without further interruption.    [Illustration: AN INN-YARD    The famous White Hart, in Southwark. The ground-plan shows the  arrangement of a carriers' inn with the stabling below; the guest  rooms were on the upper floors.]    In the smaller towns the itinerant players might, through a letter of  recommendation from their noble patron, or through the good-will of  some local dignitary, secure the use of the town-hall, of the  schoolhouse, or even of the village church. In such buildings, of  course, they could give their performances more advantageously, for  they could place money-takers at the doors, and exact adequate payment  from all who entered. In the great city of London, however, the  players were necessarily forced to make use almost entirely of public  inn-yards--an arrangement which, we may well believe, they found far  from satisfactory. Not being masters of the inns, they were merely  tolerated; they had to content themselves with hastily provided and  inadequate stage facilities; and, worst of all, for their recompense  they had to trust to a hat collection, at best a poor means of  securing money. Often too, no doubt, they could not get the use of a  given inn-yard when they most needed it, as on holidays and festive  occasions; and at all times they had to leave the public in  uncertainty as to where or when plays were to be seen. Their street  parade, with the noise of trumpets and drums, might gather a motley  crowd for the yard, but in so large a place as London it was  inadequate for advertisement among the better classes. And as the  troupes of the city increased in wealth and dignity, and as the  playgoing public grew in size and importance, the old makeshift  arrangement became more and more unsatisfactory.    At last the unsatisfactory situation was relieved by the specific  dedication of certain large inns to dramatic purposes; that is, the  proprietors of certain inns found it to their advantage to subordinate  their ordinary business to the urgent demands of the actors and the  playgoing public. Accordingly they erected in their yards permanent  stages adequately equipped for dramatic representations, constructed  in their galleries wooden benches to accommodate as many spectators as  possible, and were ready to let the use of their buildings to the  actors on an agreement by which the proprietor shared with the troupe  in the \"takings\" at the door. Thus there came into existence a number  of inn-playhouses, where the actors, as masters of the place, could  make themselves quite at home, and where the public without special  notification could be sure of always finding dramatic entertainment.    Richard Flecknoe, in his _Discourse of the English Stage_ (1664), goes  so far as to dignify these reconstructed inns with the name  \"theatres.\" At first, says he, the players acted \"without any certain  theatres or set companions, till about the beginning of Queen  Elizabeth's reign they began here to assemble into companies, and set  up theatres, first in the city (as in the inn-yards of the Cross Keys  and Bull in Grace and Bishop's Gate Street at this day to be seen),  till that fanatic spirit [i.e., Puritanism], which then began with the  stage and after ended with the throne, banished them thence into the  suburbs\"--that is, into Shoreditch and the Bankside, where, outside  the jurisdiction of the puritanical city fathers, they erected their  first regular playhouses.    The \"banishment\" referred to by Flecknoe was the Order of the Common  Council issued on December 6, 1574. This famous document described  public acting as then taking place \"in great inns, having chambers and  secret places adjoining to their open stages and galleries\"; and it  ordered that henceforth \"no inn-keeper, tavern-keeper, nor other  person whatsoever within the liberties of this city shall openly  show, or play, nor cause or suffer to be openly showed or played  within the house yard or any other place within the liberties of this  city, any play,\" etc.    How many inns were let on special occasions for dramatic purposes we  cannot say; but there were five \"great inns,\" more"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22409"],[0,"A Woman who went to Alaska (#2)"],[1,"the line into Canadian territory.  Here we presented an interesting and animated scene. Probably one  hundred and fifty persons crowded the small station and baggage room,  each one pushing his way as far as possible toward the officials, who  with muttered curses hustled the tags upon each box and trunk as it was  hastily unlocked and examined. Ropes and straps were flung about the  floor, bags thrown with bunches of keys promiscuously, while transfer  men perspiring from every pore tumbled great mountains of luggage hither  and thither.    [Illustration: CITY HALL AT SKAGWAY.]    Two ponderous Germans there were, who, in checked steamer caps enveloped  in cigar smoke of the best brand, protested vigorously at the opening of  their trunks by the officers, but their protests seemed only the more to  whet the appetites of these dignitaries. The big Germans had their  revenge, however. In the box of one of these men was found with other  things a lot of Limburger cheese, the pungent odor of which drove the  women screaming to the doors, and men protesting indignantly after them;  while those unable to reach the air prayed earnestly for a good stiff  breeze off Lynn Canal to revive them. The Germans laughed till tears ran  down their cheeks, and cheerfully paid the duty imposed.    Skagway was interesting chiefly from its historical associations as a  port where so many struggling men had landed, suffered and passed on  over that trail of hardship and blood two years before.    Our little narrow gauge coaches were crowded to their utmost, men  standing in aisles and on platforms, and sitting upon wood boxes and  hand luggage near the doors.    It was July, and the sight of fresh fruit in the hands of those lunching  in the next seat almost brought tears to my eyes, for we were now going  far beyond the land of fruits and all other delicacies.    \"Pick it up, old man, pick it up and eat it,\" said one rough fellow of  evident experience in Alaska to one who had dropped a cherry upon the  floor, \"for you won't get another while you stay in this country, if it  is four years!\"    \"But,\" said another, \"he can eat 'Alaska strawberries' to his heart's  content, summer and winter, and I'll be bound when he gets home to the  States he won't thank anyone for puttin' a plate of beans in front of  him, he'll be that sick of 'em! I et beans or 'Alaska strawberries' for  nine months one season, day in and day out, and I'm a peaceable man, but  at the end of that time I'd have put a bullet through the man who  offered me beans to eat, now you can bet your life on that! Don't never  insult an old timer by puttin' beans before him, is my advice if you do  try to sugar-coat 'em by calling 'em strawberries!\" and the man thumped  his old cob pipe with force enough upon the wood box to empty the ashes  from its bowl and to break it into fragments had it not been well  seasoned.    Upon the summit of White Pass we alighted from the train and boarded  another. This time it was the open flat cars, and the Germans came near  being left. As the conductor shouted \"all aboard\" they both scrambled,  with great puffing and blowing owing to their avoirdupois, to the rear  end of the last car, and with faces purple from exertion plumped  themselves down almost in the laps of some women who were laughing at  them.    [Illustration: PORCUPINE CANYON, WHITE PASS.]    We had now a dizzy descent to make to Lake Bennett. Conductor and  brakeman were on the alert. With their hands upon the brakes these men  stood with nerves and muscles tense. All talking ceased. Some of us  thought of home and loved ones, but none flinched. Slowly at first, then  faster and faster the train rolled over the rails until lakes, hills and  mountains fairly flew past us as we descended. At last the train's speed  was slackened, and we moved more leisurely along the foot of the  mountains. We were in the beautiful green \"Meadows\" where pretty and  fragrant wild flowers nodded in clusters among the tall grass.    At Bennett our trunks were again opened, and we left the train. We were  to take a small steamer down the lakes and river for Dawson. We were no  longer crowded, as passengers scattered to different boats, some going  east to Atlin. With little trouble I secured a lodging for one night  with the stewardess of the small steamer which would carry us as far as  Miles Canyon or the Camp, Canyon City. From there we were obliged to  walk five miles over the trail. It was midsummer, and the woods through  which we passed were green. Wild flowers, grasses and moss carpeted our  path which lay along the eastern bank of the great gorge called Miles  Canyon, only at times winding away too far for the roar of its rushing  waters to reach our ears. No sound of civilization came to us, and no  life was to be seen unless a crow chanced to fly overhead in search of  some morsel of food. Large forest trees there were none. Tall, straight  saplings of poplar, spruce and pine pointed their slender fingers  heavenward, and seemed proudly to say:    \"See what fortitude we have to plant ourselves in this lonely Northland  with our roots and sap ice-bound most of the year. Do you not admire  us?\" And we did admire wonderingly. Then, again, nearing the banks of  Miles Canyon we forged our way on up hill and down, across wet spots,  over boulders and logs, listening to the roar of the mighty torrent  dashing between towering, many-colored walls of rock, where the volume  of water one hundred feet in width with a current of fifteen miles an  hour, and a distance of five-eighths of a mile rushes insistently  onward, as it has, no doubt, done for ages past. Then at last widening,  this torrent is no longer confined by precipitous cliffs but between  sparsely wooded banks, and now passes under the name of \"White Horse  Rapids,\" from so strangely resembling white horses as the waters are  dashed over and about the huge boulders in mid-stream. Here many of the  earlier argonauts found watery graves as they journeyed in small boats  or rafts down the streams to the Klondyke in their mad haste to reach  the newly discovered gold fields.    After leaving White Horse Rapids we traveled for days down the river. My  little stateroom next the galley or kitchen of the steamer was  frequently like an oven, so great was the heat from the big cooking  range. The room contained nothing but two berths, made up with blankets  and upon wire springs, and the door did not boast of a lock of any  description. Upon application to the purser for a chair I received a  camp stool. Luckily I had brushes, combs, soap and towels in my bag, for  none of these things were furnished with the stateroom. In the stern of  the boat there was a small room where tin wash basins and roller towels  awaited the pleasure of the women passengers, the water for their  ablutions being kept in a barrel, upon which hung an old dipper. To  clean one's teeth over the deck rail might seem to some an unusual  undertaking, but I soon learned to do this with complacency, it being  something of gain not to lose sight of passing scenery while performing  the operation.    [Illustration: MILES CANYON.]    At Lake La Barge we enjoyed a magnificent panorama. Bathed in the rosy  glow of a departing sunset, this beautiful body of water sparkled like  diamonds on all sides of us. Around us on every hand lay the green and  quiet hills. Near the waters' edge they appeared a deep green, but grew  lighter in the distance. Long bars of crimson, grey and gold streaked  the western horizon, while higher up tints of purple and pink blended  harmoniously with the soft blue sky. As the sun slowly settled the  colors deepened. Darker and darker they grew. The warm soft glow had  departed, and all was purple and black, including the waters beneath us;  and as we passed through the northern end or outlet of the lake into  Thirty Mile River we seemed to be entering a gate, so narrow did the  entrance to the river appear between the hills.    At night our steamer was frequently tied up to a wood pile along the  banks of the river. No signs of civilization met our eyes, except,  perhaps, a rude log hut or cabin among the trees, where at night, his  solitary candle twinkling in his window and his dogs baying at the moon,  some lonely settler had established himself.    The Semenow Hills country is a lonely one. Range upon range of rolling,  partly wooded, hills meet the eye of the traveler until it grows weary  and seeks relief in sleep.    Five Finger Rapids was the next point of interest on our route, and I am  here reminded of a short story which is not altogether one of fiction,  and which is entitled: Midnight on a Yukon Steamer.          CHAPTER II.    MIDNIGHT ON A YUKON STEAMER.      The bright and yellow full moon drifted slowly upward. The sun had just  set at nine in the evening, casting a warm and beautiful glow over all  the lonely landscape, for it was the most dreary spot in all the dreary  wilderness through which the mighty Yukon passes.    The steamer had tied up for wood, and now the brawny stevedores with  blackened hands and arms were pitching it to the deck.    To the passengers, of whom there were a goodly number, time hung  heavily, and the younger ones had proposed a dance. Musical instruments  were not numerous, but such as there were, were brought out, and two  non-professionals with an accordion and a banjo, were doing their very  best.    A small number of sober ones were to be seen on deck pacing restlessly  back and forth, for the ruthless mosquito was distinctly on evidence,  and threatened to outgeneral the quiet ones, if not the orchestra and  the hilarious dancers.    On the upper deck, a lady, clad in warm cloak and thick veil, walked  tirelessly to and fro. A big stump-tailed dog of the Malemute tribe at  times followed at her heels, but when she had patted his head and  spoken kindly to him he appeared satisfied, and lay"]]]
