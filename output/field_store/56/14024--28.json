He came down by the London coach. I saw his trunk,  in the first place, addressed to you, and supposed him to be the young  gentleman who attained to some rather undesirable notoriety last year.\"    \"How so?\" asked the doctor.    \"Oh! he very ungenerously and artfully endeavored to retain for  himself the honor of writing a clever little essay, really the work  of his brother, and actually obtained a prize from his grandfather  for it.\"    \"How came that about?\" asked Dr. Wilkinson.    \"Oh! there was some mistake in the first instance, I believe, and the  mean little fellow took advantage of it.\"    Mr. Percy then gave a detailed account of Louis' birthday at Heronhurst,  and concluded by saying--    \"I was not present, but I heard it from a spectator; I should be afraid  that you will not have a little trouble with such a character.\"    \"It is extraordinary,\" said the doctor; \"his brother is the most frank,  candid fellow possible.\"    \"I hear he is a nice boy,\" said Mr. Percy. \"There is frequently great  dissimilarity among members of the same family; but of course, this  goes no further. It is as well you should know it,--but I should not  talk of it to every one.\"    Dr. Wilkinson bowed slightly, and remained silent, without exhibiting  any peculiar gratification at having been made the depository of the  secret. Mr. Percy presently rose and took his leave; and Dr. Wilkinson  was turning towards the staircase, when a servant informed him that a  young gentleman waited to see him in the dining-room.    \"Oh!\" said the doctor to himself, \"my dilatory pupil, I presume.\"    He seemed lost in thought for a minute, and then slowly crossing  the hall, entered the dining-room.    Louis had been very anxious for the appearance of his master, yet  almost afraid to see him; and when the door opened, and this gentleman  stood before him, he was seized with such a palpitation as scarcely to  have the power of speech.    Dr. Wilkinson was certainly a person calculated to inspire a school-boy  with awe. He was a tall, dignified man, between fifty and sixty years  of age, with a magnificent forehead and good countenance: the latter  was not, however, generally pleasing, the usual expression being stern  and unyielding. When he smiled, that expression vanished; but to a  new-comer there was something rather terrible in the compressed lips  and overhanging eyebrows, from under which a pair of the keenest black  eyes seemed to look him through.    Louis rose and bowed on his master's entrance.    \"How do you do, Mortimer?\" said the doctor, shaking hands with him.  \"I dare say you are tired of waiting. You have not seen your brother,  I suppose?\"    \"No, sir,\" replied Louis, looking in the stern face with something  of his customary simple confidence. Doctor Wilkinson smiled, and  added, \"You are very like your father,--exceedingly like what he  was at your age.\"    \"Did you know him then, sir?\" asked Louis, timidly.    \"Yes, as well as I hope to know you in a short time. What is your name?\"    \"Louis Francis, sir.\"    \"What! your father's name--that is just what it should be. Well, I hope,  Louis, you will now endeavor to give him the utmost satisfaction. With  such a father, and such a home, you have great privileges to account  for; and it is your place to show to your parents of what use their  care and instruction have been. In a large school you will find many  things so different from home, that, unless you are constantly on your  guard, you will often be likely to do things which may afterwards cause  you hours of pain. Remember that you are a responsible creature sent  into the world to act a part assigned to you by your Maker; and to Him  must the account of every talent be rendered, whether it be used, or  buried in the earth. As a Christian gentleman, see, Louis, that you  strive to do your part with all your might.\"    Dr. Wilkinson watched the attention and ready sympathy with his  admonition displayed by Louis; and in spite of the warning he had  so lately received, felt very kindly and favorably disposed towards  his new pupil.    \"Come with me,\" he said, \"I will introduce you to your school-fellows;  I have no doubt you will find your brother among them somewhere.\"    Louis followed Dr. Wilkinson through a door at the further end of the  hall, leading into a smaller hall which was tapestried with great-coats,  cloaks, and hats; and here an increasing murmur announced the fact of  his near approach to a party of noisy boys. As the doctor threw open  the folding-doors leading into the noble school-room, Louis felt  almost stupefied by the noise and novelty. A glass door leading into  the play-ground was wide open, and, as school was just over, there  was a great rush into the open air. Some were clambering in great  haste over desks and forms; and the shouting, singing, and whistling,  together with the occasional overthrow of a form, and the almost  incessant banging of desk-lids, from those who were putting away  slates and books, formed a scene perfectly new and bewildering to  our hero.    The entrance of Dr. Wilkinson stilled the tumult in a slight degree,  and in half a minute after, the room was nearly cleared, and a passage  was left for the new-comers towards the upper end. Here was a knot of  great boys (or, rather, craving their pardon, I should say _young men_),  all engaged in eager and merry confabulation. So intent were they that  their master's approach was wholly unnoticed by them. One of these young  gentlemen was sitting tailor fashion on the top of a desk, apparently  holding forth for the edification of his more discreet companions,  to whom he seemed to afford considerable amusement, if the peals of  laughter with which his sallies were received might be considered any  proof. A little aloof from this party, but within hearing, stood a  youth of about seventeen, of whom nothing was remarkable, but that his  countenance wore a very sedate and determined expression. He seemed  struggling with a determination not to indulge a strong propensity  to laugh; but, though pretending to be occupied with a book, his  features at length gave way at some irresistible sally, and throwing  his volume at the orator, he exclaimed--    \"How can you be such an ass, Frank!\"    \"There now,\" said Frank, perfectly unmoved, \"the centre of gravity is  disturbed,--well, as I was saying,--Here's the doctor!\" and the young  gentleman, who was no other than Frank Digby, brother of Louis' cousin  Vernon, dismounted from his rostrum in the same instant that his auditors  turned round, thereby acknowledging the presence of their master.    \"I have brought you a new school-fellow, gentlemen,\" said the doctor;  \"where is Mortimer?\"    \"Here, sir,\" cried Reginald, popping up from behind a desk, where he  had been pinned down by a short thick-set boy, who rose as if by magic  with him.    \"Here is your brother.\"    Louis and Reginald scrambled over all obstacles, and stood before  the doctor, in two or three seconds.    In spite of Louis' valiant protestations the preceding mid-summer  at Heronhurst, he did not dare, in the presence of only a quarter  of the hundred and twenty eyes, to embrace his brother, but contented  himself with a most energetic squeeze, and a look that said volumes;  and, indeed, it must be confessed, that Reginald was not an inviting  figure for an embrace; for, independently of a rough head, and  dust-bedecked garments, his malicious adversary had decorated his  face with multitudinous ink-spots, a spectacle which greatly provoked  the mirth of his laughter-loving school-fellows.    Dr. Wilkinson made some remark on the singularity of his pupil's  appearance, and then, commending Louis to the kind offices of  the assembled party, left the room.    He had scarcely closed the door behind him, when several loiterers  from the lower part of the room came up; and Reginald and his brother  were immediately assailed with a number of questions, aimed with such  rapidity as to be unanswerable.    \"When did you come?\" \"Who's that, Mortimer?\" \"Is that your brother?\"  \"What's his name?\" \"Shall you be in our class?\" \"Why didn't you stay  longer in Bristol?--If I had been you I would!\"    Louis was amused though puzzled, and turned first one way, and then  another, in his futile attempts to see and reply to his interrogators.    \"Make way!\" at last exclaimed Frank Digby; \"you are quite embarrassing  to her ladyship. Will the lady Louisa take my arm? Allow me, madam, to  interpose my powerful authority.\" And he offered his arm to Louis with  a smirk and low bow, which set all the spectators off laughing; for  Frank was one of those privileged persons, who, having attained a  celebrity for being _very funny_, can excite a laugh with very little  trouble.    \"Don't, Frank!\" said Reginald.    \"_Don't!_ really, Mr. Mortimer, if you have no respect for your  sister's feelings, it is time that I interposed. Here you allow this  herd of _I don't know what to call them_, to incommode her with their  senseless clamor. I protest, she is nearly fainting; she has been  gasping for breath the last five minutes. Be off, ye fussy, curious,  prying, peeping, pressing-round fellows; or, I promise you, you shall  be visited with his majesty's heaviest displeasure.\"    \"How do you do, lady Louisa? I hope your ladyship's in good health!\"  \"Don't press on her!\" was now echoed mischievously in various tones  around Louis, whose color was considerably heightened by this  unexpected attack.    \"Now do allow me,\" persisted Frank, dragging Louis' hand in his"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19856"],[0,"A Study of Pueblo Architecture: Tusayan and Cibola (#2)"],[1,"                        80       XXXVI.
