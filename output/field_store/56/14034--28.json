On the north  side of the fjord is Norre Sundby, connected with Aalborg  by a pontoon and also by an iron railway bridge, one of the  finest engineering works in the kingdom.  Aabborgt received  town privileges in 1342 and the bishopric dates from 1554.    AALEN, a town of Germany, in the kingdom of Wurttemberg,  pleasantly situated on the Kocher, at the foot of the Swabian  Alps, about 50 m.  E. of Stuttgart, and with direct railway  communication with Ulm and Cannstatt.  Pop. 10,000.  Woollen  and linen goods are manufactured, and there are ribbon  looms and tanneries in the town, and large iron works in the  neighbourhood.  There are several schools and churches, and a  statue of the poet Christian Schubart.  Aalen was a free imperial  city from 1360 to 1802, when it was annexed to Wurttemberg.    AALESUND, a seaport of Norway, in Romsdal amt (county), 145  m.  N. by E. from Bergen.  Pop. (1900) 11,672.  It occupies  two of the outer islands of the west coast, Aspo and  Norvo, which enclose the picturesque harbour.  Founded  in 1824, it is the principal shipping-place of Sondmore  district, and one of the chief stations of the herring  fishery.  Aalesund is adjacent to the Jorund and Geiranger  fjords, frequented by tourists.  From Oje at the head of  Jorund a driving-route strikes south to the Nordfjord, and  from Merck on Geiranger another strikes inland to Otta, on  the railway to Liilehammer and Christiania.  Aalesund is a  port of call for steamers between Bergen, Hull, Newcastle  and Hamburg, and Trondhjem.  A little to the south of the  town are the ruins of the reputed castle of Rollo, the  founder, in the 9th century, of the dynasty of the dukes of  Normandy.  On the 23rd of January 1904, Aalesund was the  scene of one of the most terrible of the many conflagrations  to which Norwegian towns, built largely of wood, have been  subject.  Practically the whole town was destroyed, a gale aiding  the flames, and the population had to leave the place in the  night at the notice of a few minutes.  Hardly any lives were  lost, but the sufferings of the people were so terrible that  assistance was sent from all parts of the kingdom, and by the  German government, while the British government also offered it.    AALI, MEHEMET, Pasha (1815-1871), Turkish statesman, was born  at Constantinople in 1815, the son of a government official.  Entering the diplomatic service of his country soon after reaching  manhood, he became successively secretary of the Embassy in  Vienna, minister in London, and foreign minister under Reshid  Pasha.  In 1852 he was promoted to the post of grand vizier,  but after a short time retired into private life.  During the  Crimean War he was recalled in order to take the portfolio  of foreign affairs for a second time under Reshid Pasha,  and in this capacity took part in 1855 in the conference of  Vienna.  Again becoming in that year grand vizier, an office  he filled no less than five times, he represented Turkey  at the congress of Paris in 1856.  In 1867 he was appointed  regent of Turkey during the sultan's visit to the Paris  Exhibition.  Aali Pasha was one of the most zealous advocates  of the introduction of Western reforms under the sultans Abdul  Mejid and Abdul Aziz.  A scholar and a linguist, he was a  match for the diplomats of the Christian powers, against whom  he successfully defended the interests of his country.  He  died at Erenkeni in Asia Minor on the 6th of September 1871.    AAR, or AARE, the most considerable river which both  rises and ends entirely within Switzerland.  Its total  length (including all bends) from its source to its junction  with the Rhine is about 181 m., during which distance it  descends 5135 ft., while its drainage area is 6804 sq.  m.  It rises in the great Aar glaciers, in the canton of  Bern, and W. of the Grimsel Pass.  It runs E. to the Grimsel  Hospice, and then N.W. through the Hasli valley, forming on the  way the magnificent waterfall of the Handegg (151 ft.), past  Guttannen, and pierces the limestone barrier of the Kirchet  by a grand gorge, before reaching Meiringen, situated in a  plain.  A little beyond, near Brienz, the river expands  into the lake of Brienz, where it becomes navigable.  Near  the west end of that lake it receives its first important  affluent, the Lutschine (left), and then runs across the  swampy plain of the Bodoli, between Interlaken (left) and  Unterseen (right), before again expanding in order to form  the Lake of Thun.  Near the west end of that lake it receives  on the left the Kander, which has just before been joined  by the Simme; on flowing out of the lake it passes Thun, and  then circles the lofty bluff on which the town of Bern is  built.  It soon changes its north-westerly for a due westerly  direction, but after receiving the Saane or Sarine (left)  turns N. till near Aarberg its stream is diverted W. by the  Hagneck Canal into the Lake of Bienne, from the upper end of  which it issues through the Nidau Canal and then runs E. to  Buren.  Henceforth its course is N.E. for a long distance,  past Soleure (below which the Grosse Emme flows in on the  right), Aarburg (where it is joined by the Wigger, right),  Olten, Aarau, near which is the junction with the Suhr on the  right, and Wildegg, where the Hallwiler Aa falls in on the  right.  A short way beyond, below Brugg, it receives first the  Reuss (right), and very shortly afterwards the Limmat or Linth  (right).  It now turns due N., and soon becomes itself an  affluent of the Rhine (left), which it surpasses in volume  when they unite at Coblenz, opposite Waldshut. (W. A. B. C.)    AARAU, the capital of the Swiss canton of Aargau.  In 1900  it had 7831 inhabitants, mostly German-speaking, and mainly  Protestants.  It is situated in the valley of the Aar, on the  right bank of that river, and at the southern foot of the range  of the Jura.  It is about 50 m. by rail N.E. of Bern, and 31  m.  N.W. of Zurich.  It is a well-built modern town, with  no remarkable features about it.  In the Industrial Museum  there is (besides collections of various kinds) some good  painted glass of the 16th century, taken from the neighbouring  Benedictine monastery of Muri (founded 1027, suppressed  1841---the monks are now quartered at Gries, near Botzen, in  Tirol).  The cantonal library contains many works relating to  Swiss history and many MSS. coming from the suppressed Argovian  monasteries.  There are many industries in the town, especially  silk-ribbon weaving, foundries, and factories for the manufacture  of cutlery and scientific instruments.  The popular novelist  and historian, Heinrich Zschokke (1771-1848), spent most of  his life here, and a bronze statue has been erected to his  memory.  Aarau is an important military centre.  The slopes  of the Jura are covered with vineyards.  Aarau, an ancient  fortress, was taken by the Bernese in 1415, and in 1798 became  for a time the capital of the Helvetic republic.  Eight miles  by rail N.E. are the famous sulphur baths of Schinznach,  just above which is the ruined castle of Habsburg, the  original home of that great historical house. (W. A. B. C.)    AARD-VARK (meaning ``earth pig''), the Dutch name for  the mammals of genus Orycteropus, confined to Africa (see  EDEN-TATAI. Several species have been named.  Among them  is the typical form, O. capensis, or Cape ant-bear from  South Africa, and the northern aard-vark (O. aethiopicus)  of north-eastern Africa, extending into Egypt.  In form  these animals are somewhat pig-like; the body is stout,  with arched back; the limbs are short and stout, armed with  strong, blunt claws; the ears disproportionately long; and  the tail very thick at the base and tapering gradually.  The  greatly elongated head is set on a short thick neck, and at  the extremity of the snout is a disk in which the nostrils  open.  The mouth is small and tubular, furnished with a long  extensile tongue.  The measurements of a female taken in the  flesh, were head and body 4 ft., tail 17 1/2 in.; but a large  individual measured 6 ft. 8 in. over all.  In colour the  Cape aard-vark is pale sandy or yellow, the hair being scanty  and allowing the skin to show; the northern aard-vark has  a still thinner coat, and is further distinguished by the  shorter tail and longer head and ears.  These animals are of  nocturnal and burrowing habits, and generally to be found near  ant-hills.  The strong claws make a hole in the side of the  ant-hill, and the insects are collected on the extensile  tongue.  Aard-varks are hunted for their skins; but the  flesh is valued for food, and often salted and smoked.    AARD-WOLF (earth-wolf), a South and East African carnivorous  mammal (Proteles cristatus), in general appearance like a  small striped hyena, but with a more pointed muzzle, sharpe  ears, and a long erectile mane down the middle line of the  neck and back.  It is of nocturnal and burrowing habits, and  feeds on decomposed animal substances, larvae and termites.    AARGAU (Fr. Argovie), one of the more northerly Swiss  cantons, comprising the lower course of the river Aar (q.v.),  whence its name.  Its total area is 541.9 sq. m., of which  517.9 sq. m. are classed as ``productive'' (forests covering  172 sq. m. and vineyards 8.2 sq. m.).  It is one of the least  mountainous Swiss cantons, forming part of a great table-land,  to the north of the Alps and the east of the Jura, above which  rise low hills.  The surface of the country is beautifully  diversified, undulating tracts and well-wooded hills alternating  with fertile valleys watered mainly by the Aar and its  tributaries.  It contains the famous hot sulphur springs of  Baden (q.v.) and Schinznach, while at Rheinfelden there are  very extensive saline springs.  Just below Brugg the Reuss  and the Limmat join the Aar, while around Brugg are the ruined "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20014"],[0,"Canada and the Canadians, Vol. 1 (#2)"],[1,"the ague, or the milk-fever, which so debilitates his frame, that,  during the remainder of his wretched existence, he can expect but little  enjoyment of the manorial rights appendant to a hundred acres of wild  land.    Let no emigrant embark for the United States unless he has a kind friend  to guide and receive him there, and to point out to him the good and the  evil; for the native race look upon all foreigners with a jealous eye,  and particularly upon the Irish.    The Germans make the best settlers in that country, perhaps because, not  speaking English, they cannot be so easily imposed upon by the crimps,  and also because they seldom emigrate before they have arranged with  their friends in America respecting the lands which they are to occupy.    A society of British philanthropists has been established at New York to  direct British emigrants in their ultimate views; but it may well be  imagined that these gentlemen, who are chiefly engaged in trade, cannot  descend to understand fully, or are constant witnesses of, the low  tricks which are practised to seduce the unwary ones.    The emigrant to Canada is somewhat differently situated.    The Irish come out in shiploads every season, and generally very  indifferently provided and without any definite object; nay, to such an  extent is this carried, that hundreds of young females venture out every  year by themselves, to better their condition, which betterment usually  ends in their reaching as far inland as Toronto, where, or at other  ports on the lakes, they engage themselves as domestics.    When we consider that nearly 25,000 emigrants leave the Mother Country  every year for Canada alone, how important is it that they should be  informed of every particular likely to increase their comforts and to  conduce to their well-being! This kind of service can be but partially  rendered by the present publication, which, being intended for the  general reader, cannot be given in a form likely to reach the class of  emigrants who usually proceed to America otherwise than through the  advice which the reader may, whenever it is in his power, kindly bestow  upon them. But it will, I am persuaded, be extensively useful in that  way, and also to the settler with a small capital who can afford to  consult it.    Learned dissertations upon colonization are useful only to the  politician, and so much venality has prevailed among those who have  thrust themselves forward in the cause of Canadian settlement, that the  public become a little alarmed when they hear of a work expressly  designed for the emigrant.    The very best informed at home, and the _haute noblesse_, have been  repeatedly taken in. Dinnerings and lionizing have been the order of the  day for persons, who, in the colony, cut a very inferior figure. But  this is natural, and in the end usually does no harm. It is natural that  the colonist, who is a _rara avis_ in England, should be considered a  very extraordinary personage among men who seek for novelty in any  shape; because those who lavish favours upon him at one time and eschew  his presence afterwards are usually ignorant of the very history of  which he is the type. It is like the standing joke of sending out  water-casks for the men-of-war built on the fresh-water seas of Canada,  for there are plenty of rich folks at home who want only to be filled.    The different sorts of people who emigrate from _home_ to the United  States or Canada, may be classed under several heads, like the  travellers of Sterne.    First, the inquisitive and restless, who leave a goodly inheritance or  occupation behind them, because they have heard that Tom Smith or Mister  Mac Grogan, very ordinary folks anywhere, have made a rapid fortune,  which is indeed sometimes the case in the United States, though rather  rare there for old countrymen, and is still more rare and unlikely in  Canada, where large fortunes may be said to be unknown quantities.    Settlers of this class usually fall to the ground very soon--if they  settle in Canada, they become Radicals; if they return from the States,  they become Tories.    The next class are your would-be aristocratic settlers, younger sons of  younger sons, cousins of cousins, Union Barons, nephews' nephews of a  Lord Mayor, or unprovided heirs in posse.    These fancy they confer a sort of honour by selecting the colony as  their final resting-place, and that a governor and his ministers have  nothing in the world to think about but how they can provide for such  important units. Hence they frequently end by placing themselves in  direct opposition to the powers that be, or take very unwillingly to the  labours of a farmer's life. Many of them, when they find that pretension  is laughed at, particularly if no talents accompany it, which is rarely  or ever the case, for talent is modest and retiring in its essential  nature, turn out violent Republicans or Radicals of the most furious  calibre; but the more modest portion work heartily at their farms, and  frequently succeed.    Another class is your private gentlemen's sons and decent young farmers  from England, Ireland, or Scotland, who think before they leap, have  connexions already established in Canada, and small capitals to  commence with. These are the really valuable settlers: they go to  Canada for land and living; and eschew the land and liberty system of  the neighbouring nation. Wherever they settle, the country flourishes  and becomes a second Britain in appearance, as may be observed in the  London and western districts.    It does not require a very lengthened acquaintance with Canada to form  observations upon the characters of the _immigrants_, as the Webster  style of Dr. Johnson will have the word to be.    The English franklin and the English peasant who come here usually weigh  their allegiance a little before they make up their minds; but, if they  have been persuaded that Queen Victoria's reign is a \"_baneful  domination_,\" they either go to the United States at once, or to those  portions of Canada where sympathy with the Stars and Stripes is the  order of the day.[2]    [Footnote 2: That is, to those portions of the London and western  district where American settlers abound, who have so generously repaid  the fostering care which Governor Simcoe originally extended to them.  One of those rabid folks indebted to the British government, who kept an  inn, padlocked his pumps lately when a regiment was marching through  Woodstock in hot dusty weather, that the soldiers might not slake their  thirst.]    If they be Scotch Radicals, the most uncompromising and the most bitter  of all politicians, they seek Canada only with the ultimate hope of  revolutionizing it.    But the latter are more than balanced by the respectable Scotch, who  emigrate occasionally upon the same principles which actuate the  respectable portion of the English emigrants, and by the hardy  Highlanders already settled in various parts of the colony, whose  proverbial loyalty is proof against the arts of the demagogue.    The great mass of emigrants may however be said to come from Ireland,  and to consist of mechanics of the most inferior class, and of  labourers. These are all impressed with the most absurd notions of the  riches of America, and on landing at Quebec often refuse high wages with  contempt, to seek the Cathay of their excited imaginations westward.    If they be Orangemen, they defy the Pope and the devil as heartily in  Canada as in Londonderry, and are loyal to the backbone.    If they are Repealers, they come here sure of immediate wealth, to kick  up a deuce of a row, for two shillings and sixpence currency is paid for  a day's labour, which two shillings and sixpence was a hopeless week's  fortune in Ireland; and yet the Catholic Irish who have been long  settled in the country are by no means the worst subjects in this  Trans-Atlantic realm, as I can personally testify, having had the  command of large bodies of them during the border troubles of 1837-8.  They are all loyal and true.    In the event of a war, the Catholic Irish, to a man--and what a  formidable body it is in Canada and the United States!--will be on the  side of England. O'Connell has prophesied rightly there, for it is not  in human nature to forget the wrongs which the Catholics have suffered  for the past ten years in a country professing universal freedom and  toleration.    The Americans of the better classes with whom I have conversed admit  this, but their dislike of the Irish is rooted and general among all the  native race; and they fear as well as mistrust them, because, in many of  the largest cities, New York for one, the Irish predominate.    The Americans say, and so do the Canadians, that, for some years back,  since the repeal agitation at home, a few very ignorant and very  turbulent priests, of the lowest grade, have found their way across the  Atlantic. I have travelled all over Canada, and lived many years in the  country, and have been thrown among all classes, from my having been  connected with the militia. I never saw but one specimen of Irish  hedge-priest, and therefore do not credit the assertion; this one came  out last year, and a more furious bigot or a more republican ultra I  never met with, at the same time that he was as ignorant as could be  conceived.    Such has not hitherto been the case with the Catholic priesthood of the  Canadas. The French Canadian clergy are a body of pious, exemplary men,  not perhaps shining in the galaxy of science, but unobtrusive,  gentlemanly, and an honour to the _soutane_ and _chasuble_.    The priests from Ireland are not numerous, for the Irish chapels were,  till very lately, generally presided over by Scotch missionaries; and I  can safely say that, whether Irish or Scotch, the Catholic priesthood of  Western Canada will not yield the palm to their Franco-Canadian brethren  of the cross, and that"]]]
