She was certainly massive, but probably fell short a hundred and  fifty pounds of these elephantine proportions.    Kit and Dan paused to look at this singular trio.    \"I wonder how much pay they get?\" said Dan, turning to Kit.    \"I saw in some paper that the fat woman gets fifty dollars a week.\"    \"That's pretty good pay for being fat, Kit.\"    \"Would you be willing to be as fat for that money?\"    \"I think not,\" said Dan, \"though it's a good deal more than I get now.\"    They were standing near the bench on which the three were seated.  Achilles, who looked good-natured, as most big men are, addressed the  boys.    \"Well, boys, are you coming to see the show?\"    \"Yes,\" answered both.    \"I used to like to myself when I was a boy. I didn't expect then I  should ever travel with one.\"    \"Were you very large as a boy?\" asked Dan, with curiosity.    \"When I was twelve years old I was six feet high, and people generally  thought then that I was eighteen. I thought perhaps I shouldn't grow any  more, but I kept on. When I was sixteen I was seven feet tall, and by  twenty I had reached my present height.\"    \"Are you eight feet three inches tall, Mr. Henderson?\"    \"Is that what the bills say?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Then it must be so,\" he said with a smile.    \"How long have you been traveling with the circus?\"    \"Five years.\"    \"How do you like it?\"    \"It's a good deal easier than working on a farm, especially in Vermont,  where I was born and bred.\"    \"But they call you the Scotch giant.\"    \"It sounds well, doesn't it? My father was born in Scotland, but my  mother was a Vermont Yankee. You know Americans are more willing to pay  for a foreign curiosity than for one home born. That's why my _great_  friend here\"--emphasizing the word great--\"calls herself Madame  Celestina Morella.\"    The fat lady smiled.    \"People think I am French or Italian,\" she said, \"but I never was out of  the United States in my life.\"    \"Where were you born, Madame Morella?\"    \"In the western part of New York State. I know what you are going to ask  me. Was I always fat? No, when I was sixteen I only weighed one hundred  and twenty. Then I had a fit of sickness and nearly died. After  recovering, I began to gain flesh, till I became a monster, as you see.\"    As she said this, she laughed, and her fat sides shook with merriment.  Evidently she did not let her size weigh upon her mind.    \"I suppose your real name isn't Celestina Morella?\" said Kit.    \"My real name is Betsey Hatch. That is what they called me in my  girlhood, but I should hardly know who was meant if I was called so  now.\"    \"Have you been long in the show business?\"    \"About seven years.\"    \"Do you like it?\"    \"I didn't at first, but now I've got used to moving about. Now when the  spring opens I have the regular circus fever. But I have my troubles.\"    \"What are they?\" asked Kit, seeing that the fat woman liked to talk.    \"Well, I find it very difficult to secure at the hotels a bed large  enough and strong enough to hold me. I suppose you won't be surprised to  hear that.\"    \"Not much.\"    \"At Akron, Ohio, where the hotel was full, I was put in a cot bed,  though I protested against it. As soon as I got in, the whole thing  collapsed, and I was landed on the floor.\"    She laughed heartily at the remembrance.    \"I remember that very well,\" said the giant, \"for I slept in the room  below. Half an hour after getting into bed, I heard a fearful noise in  the room above, and thought at first the hotel had been struck by  lightning, and a piercing shriek that echoed through the house led me to  fear that my esteemed Italian friend was a victim. But my mind was soon  relieved when I learned the truth.\"    \"I suppose, major, you never broke down a bed,\" said the giant, turning  to the dwarf.    \"No,\" answered the major, in a shrill piping voice, \"I never lie awake  thinking of that.\"    \"I believe you served in the civil war, major?\"    \"Yes, I was in the infantry.\"    It was a stale joke, but all four laughed at it.    \"How much do you weigh, major?\" Kit ventured to ask.    \"Twenty-one pounds and a half,\" answered the dwarf. \"I have with me some  of my photographs, if you would like to buy,\" and the little man  produced half a dozen cards from his tiny pocket.    \"How much are they?\"    \"Ten cents.\"    \"I'll take one,\" said Kit, and he produced the necessary coin.    \"If you go into the tent you can see some of the performers rehearsing,\"  suggested Achilles.    \"Let us go in, Dan.\"    The two boys reached the portals and went into the big tent.          CHAPTER III.    KIT ASTONISHES TWO ACROBATS.      The circus tent was nearly ready for the regular performance. Kit and  Dan regarded the sawdust arena with the interest which it always  inspires in boys of sixteen. Already it was invested with fascination  for them. Two acrobats who performed what is called the \"brothers' act\"  were rehearsing. They were placarded as the Vincenti brothers, though  one was a French Canadian and the other an Irishman, and there was no  relationship between them. At the time the boys entered, one had climbed  upon the other's shoulders, and was standing erect with folded arms.  This was, of course, easy, but the next act was more difficult. By a  quick movement he lowered his head, and grasping the uplifted hands of  the lower acrobat, raised his feet and poised himself aloft, with his  feet up in the air, sustained by the muscular arms of his associate.    \"That must take strength, Kit,\" said Dan.    \"So it does.\"    \"No one but a circus man could do it, I suppose?\"    \"I can do it,\" said Kit quietly.    Dan regarded him with undisguised astonishment.    \"You are joking,\" he said.    \"No, I am not.\"    \"Where did you learn to do such a thing?\" asked Dan, incredulous, though  he knew Kit to be a boy of truth.    \"I will tell you. In the town where I attended boarding school there is  a large gymnasium, under the superintendence of a man who traveled for  years with a circus. He used to give lessons to the boys, but most  contented themselves with a few common exercises. I suppose I should  also, but there was an English boy in the school, very supple and  muscular, who was proud of his strength, and ambitious to make himself a  thorough gymnast. He persuaded me to take lessons in the most difficult  acrobatic feats with him, as two had to work together.\"    \"Did you pay the professor extra to instruct you?\" asked Dan.    \"He charged nothing. He was only too glad to teach us all he knew. It  seems he was at one time connected with Barnum's circus, and prepared  performers for the arena. He told us it made him think of his old circus  days to teach us. At the close of last term we gave him five dollars  apiece as an acknowledgment of his services. He assured us then that we  were competent to perform in any circus.\"    \"Could you really do what the Vincenti brothers are doing?\"    \"Yes; and more.\"    \"I wish I could see you do it.\"    The boys were seated near the sawdust arena, and the last part of their  conversation had been heard by the acrobats. It was taken as an  illustration of boyish braggadocio, and as circus men are always ready  for practical jokes, particularly at the expense of greenhorns, they  resolved that there was a good chance for a little fun.    One tipped the wink to the other, and turning to Kit, said: \"What's that  you're saying, kid?\"    \"How does he know your name?\" said Dan, mistaking kid, the circus name  for boy, for his friend's nickname.    \"He said kid, not Kit,\" answered our hero.    \"Do you think you can do our act?\" continued the acrobat.    \"I think I can,\" replied Kit.    This elicited a broad grin from the acrobat.    \"Look here, kid,\" he said, \"do you know how long it took me to learn the  business?\"    \"I don't know, but I should like to know.\"    \"Three years.\"    \"No doubt you can do a great deal more than I.\"    \"Oh, no, certainly not!\" said the acrobat, ironically.    \"I see you don't believe me,\" said Kit.    \"I'll tell you what you remind me of, kid. There was a fellow came to  our circus last summer, and wanted to get an engagement as rider. He  said he'd been a cowboy out in New Mexico, and had been employed to  break horses. So we gave the fellow a trial. We brought out a wild  mustang, and told him to show what he could do. The mustang let him get  on, as was his custom, but after he was fairly on, he gave a jump, and  Mr. Cowboy measured his length on the sawdust.\"    Kit and Dan both smiled at this story.    \"I am not a cowboy, and don't profess to ride bucking mustangs,\" he  said, \"though my friend Dan may.\"    \"I'd rather be excused,\" put in Dan.    \"I'll tell you what, kid, if you'll go through the performance you've  just seen I'll give you five dollars.\"    The fellow expected Kit would make some hasty excuse, but he was  mistaken. Our hero rose from his seat, removed his coat and vest, and  bounded into the arena.    \"I am ready,\" he said, \"but I am not strong enough to be the under man.  I'll do the other.\"    \"All right! Go ahead!\"    The speaker put himself in position. Kit gave a spring, and in an  instant was upon his shoulders.    There was an exclamation of surprise from the second acrobat.    \"Christopher!\" he exclaimed. \"The boy's got something in him, after  all.\"    \"Now what shall I do?\" asked Kit, as with folded arms he stood on the  acrobat's shoulders.    \"Keep your place while I walk round the arena.\"    Kit maintained his position while the acrobat ran round the circle,  increasing his pace on purpose to dislodge his young associate. But Kit  was too well used to this act to be embarrassed. He held himself erect,  and never swerved for an instant.    \"Pretty good, kid!\" said the acrobat. \"Now reverse yourself and stand on  my hands with your feet in the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22522"],[0,"Artists' Wives (#2)"],[1,"    THE POET.    _That is all very well! You talk at your ease of solitude. Presently,  when I am gone, if some idea occurs to you, you will gently follow it  by the side of your dying embers, without feeling around you that  atmosphere of isolation, so vast, so empty, that in it inspiration  evaporates and disperses. And one may yet fear to be alone in the hours  of work; but there are moments of discouragement and weariness, when  one doubts oneself ones art even. That is the moment when it must be  happiness to find a faithful and loving heart, ever ready to sympathize  with one's depression, to which one may appeal without fearing to  disconcert a confidence and enthusiasm that are, in fact, unalterable.  And then the child. That sweet unconscious baby smile, is not that the  best moral rejuvenescence one can have? Ah! I have often thought over  that. For us artists, vain as all must be who live by success, by that  superficial esteem, capricious and fleeting, that we call the vogue; for  us, above all others, children are indispensable. They alone can console  us for growing old. All that we lose, the child gains. The success we  have missed, we think: \"He will have it\" and in proportion as our hair  grows thin, we have the joy of seeing it grow again, curly, golden, full  of life, on a little fair head at our side._      THE PAINTER.    _Ah, poet! poet! have you thought also of all the mouthfuls by which  with the end of pen or brush we must nourish a brood?_      THE POET.    _Well! say what you like, the artist is made for family life, and  that is so true, that those among us who do not marry, take refuge in  temporary companionships, like travellers who, tired of being always  home-less, end by settling in a room in some hotel, and pass their lives  under the hackneyed notice of the signboard: \"Apartments by the month or  night?\"_      THE PAINTER.    _Such are all in the wrong. They accept the worries of wedlock and will  never know its joys._      THE POET.    _\"You acknowledge then that there are some joys?\"_      _Here the painter, instead of replying, rose, searched out from among  drawings and sketches a much-thumbed manuscript, and returning to his  companion:_    _\"We might argue like this,\" said he, \"for ever so long without either  convincing the other. But since, notwithstanding my observations, you  seem determined to try marriage, here is a little work I beg you to  read. It is written--I would have you note--by a married man, much in  love with his wife, very happy in his home, an observer who, spending  his life among artists, amused himself by sketching one or two such  households as I spoke of just now. From the first to the last line of  this book, all is true, so true that the author would never publish it.  Read it, and come to me when you have read it. I think you will have  changed your mind.\"_    _The poet took the manuscript and carried it home with him; but he did  not keep the little book with all the needful care, for I have been able  to detach a few leaves from it and boldly offer them to the public._    [Illustration: p023-034]          MADAME HEURTEBISE.    She was certainly not intended for an artist's wife, above all for  such an artist as this outrageous fellow, impassioned, uproarious and  exuberant, who, with his nose in the air and bristling moustaches,  rushed through life defiantly flaunting the eccentric and whirlwind-like  name of Heurtebise,* like a challenge thrown down to all the absurd  conventionalities and prejudices of the _bourgeois_ class. How, and by  what strange charm had the little woman, brought up in a jeweller's  shop, behind rows of watch chains and strings of rings, found the means  of captivating this poet?    * Hit the blast (literally).    Picture to yourself the affected graces of a shopwoman with  insignificant features, cold and ever-smiling eyes, complacent and  placid physiognomy, devoid of real elegance, but having a certain love  for glitter and tinsel, no doubt caught at her father's shopwindow,  making her take pleasure in many-coloured satin bows, sashes and  buckles; and her hair glossy with cosmetic, stiffly arranged by the  hairdresser over a small, obstinate, narrow forehead, where the total  absence of wrinkles told less of youth than of complete lack of thought.  Such as she was, however, Heurtebise loved and wooed her, and as he  happened to possess a small income, found no difficulty in winning her.    What pleased her in this marriage was the idea of wedding an author,  a well-known man, who would take her to the theatre as often as she  wished. As for him, I verily believe that her sham elegance born of the  shop, her pretentious manners, pursed up mouth, and affectedly uplifted  little finger, fascinated him and appeared to him the height, of  Parisian refinement; for he was born a peasant and in spite of his  intelligence remained one to the end of his days.    [Illustration: p025-036]    Tempted by a quiet happiness and the family life of which he had been so  long deprived, Heurtebise spent two years far from his friends, buried  in the country, or in out-of-way suburban nooks, within easy distance  of that great city Paris, which overexcited him even while he yet sought  its attenuated atmosphere, just like those invalids who are recommended  sea air, but who, too delicate to bear it in all its strength, are  compelled to inhale it from a distance of some miles. From time to time,  his name appeared in a newspaper or magazine at the end of an article;  but already the freshness of style, the bursts of eloquence, were  lacking by which he had been formerly known. We thought: \"He is too  happy! his happiness has spoilt him.\"    However, one day he returned amongst us, and we immediately saw that he  was not happy. His pallid countenance, drawn features contracted by a  perpetual irritability, the violent manners degenerated into a nervous  rage, the hollow sound of his once fine ringing laugh, all showed that  he was an altered man. Too proud to admit that he had made a mistake,  he would, not complain, but the old friends who gathered round him  were soon convinced that he had made a most foolish marriage, and that  henceforth his life must prove a failure. On the other hand, Madame  Heurtebise appeared to us, after two years of married life, exactly the  same as we had beheld her in the vestry on her wedding day. She wore  the same calm and simpering smile, she had as much as ever the air of  a shopwoman in her Sunday clothes, only she had gained self-possession.  She talked now. In the midst of artistic discussions into which  Heurtebise passionately threw himself, with arbitrary assertions, brutal  contempt, or blind enthusiasm, the false and honeyed voice of his  wife would suddenly make irruption, forcing him to listen to some idle  reasoning or foolish observation invariably outside of the subject  of discussion. Embarrassed and worried, he would cast us an imploring  glance, and strive to resume the interrupted conversation. Then at last,  wearied out by her familiar and constant contradiction, by the silliness  of her birdlike brain, inflated and empty as any cracknel, he held his  tongue, and silently resigned himself to let her go on to the bitter  end. But this determined silence exasperated Madame, seemed to her  more insulting, more disdainful than anything. Her sharp voice became  discordant, and growing higher and shriller, stung and buzzed, like  the ceaseless teasing of a fly, till at last her enraged husband in his  turn, burst out brutal and terrific.    She emerged from these incessant quarrels, which always ended in tears,  rested and refreshed, as a lawn after a watering, but he remained  broken, fevered, incapable of work, Little by little his very violence  was worn out One evening when I was present at one of these odious  scenes, as Madame Heurtebise triumphantly left the table, I saw on her  husband's face bent downwards during the quarrel and now upraised, an  expression of scorn and anger that no words could any longer express.  The little woman went off shutting the door with a sharp snap, and he,  flushed, with his eyes full of tears, and his mouth distorted by an  ironical and despairing smile, made like any school-boy behind his  master's back, an atrocious gesture of mingled rage and pain. After a  few moments, I heard him murmur, in a voice strangled by emotion: \"Ah,  if it were not for the child, how I would be off at once!\"    For they had a child, a poor little fellow, handsome and dirty, who  crawled all over the place, played with dogs bigger than himself, with  the spiders in the garden, and made mud-pies. His mother only noticed  him to declare him \"disgusting\" and that she had not put him out to  nurse.    [Illustration: p029-040]    She clung in fact to all the little shopkeeper traditions of her youth,  and the untidy home in which she went about from early morn in elaborate  costumes and astonishingly dressed hair, recalled the back-shops so dear  to her heart, rooms black with filth and want of air, where in the  short intervals of rest from commercial life, badly cooked meals were  hurriedly eaten, at a bare wooden table, listening all the while for the  tinkle of the shop-bell. With this class, nothing has importance but  the street, the street with its passing purchasers and idlers, and its  overflowing holiday crowd, that on Sundays throng the side walks and  pavements. And how bored she was, wretched creature, in the country, how  she regretted the Paris life! Heurtebise, on the contrary, required  the country for his mental health. Paris still bewildered him like some  countrified boor on his first visit. His wife could not understand it,  and bitterly complained of her exile. By way of diversion she invited  her old acquaintances, and when her husband was absent they amused  themselves by turning over his papers, his memoranda, and the work he  was engaged upon."]]]
