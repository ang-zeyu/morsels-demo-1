Haedui,  cum se suaque ab iis defendere non possent, legatos ad Caesarem mittunt  rogatum auxilium: ita se omni tempore de populo Romano meritos esse ut  paene in conspectu exercitus nostri agri vastari, liberi [eorum] in  servitutem abduci, oppida expugnari non debuerint. Eodem tempore [quo]  Haedui Ambarri, necessarii et consanguinei Haeduorum, Caesarem certiorem  faciunt sese depopulatis agris non facile ab oppidis vim hostium  prohibere. Item Allobroges, qui trans Rhodanum vicos possessionesque  habebant, fuga se ad Caesarem recipiunt et demonstrant sibi praeter agri  solum nihil esse reliqui. Quibus rebus adductus Caesar non expectandum  sibi statuit dum, omnibus, fortunis sociorum consumptis, in Santonos  Helvetii pervenirent.      Flumen est Arar, quod per fines Haeduorum et Sequanorum in Rhodanum  influit, incredibili lenitate, ita ut oculis in utram partem fluat  iudicari non possit. Id Helvetii ratibus ac lintribus iunctis transibant.  Ubi per exploratores Caesar certior factus est tres iam partes copiarum  Helvetios id flumen traduxisse, quartam vero partem citra flumen Ararim  reliquam esse, de tertia vigilia cum legionibus tribus e castris profectus  ad eam partem pervenit quae nondum flumen transierat. Eos impeditos et  inopinantes adgressus magnam partem eorum concidit; reliqui sese fugae  mandarunt atque in proximas silvas abdiderunt. Is pagus appellabatur  Tigurinus; nam omnis civitas Helvetia in quattuor pagos divisa est. Hic  pagus unus, cum domo exisset, patrum nostrorum memoria L. Cassium consulem  interfecerat et eius exercitum sub iugum miserat. Ita sive casu sive  consilio deorum immortalium quae pars civitatis Helvetiae insignem  calamitatem populo Romano intulerat, ea princeps poenam persolvit. Qua in  re Caesar non solum publicas, sed etiam privatas iniurias ultus est, quod  eius soceri L. Pisonis avum, L. Pisonem legatum, Tigurini eodem proelio  quo Cassium interfecerant.      Hoc proelio facto, reliquas copias Helvetiorum ut consequi posset,  pontem in Arari faciendum curat atque ita exercitum traducit. Helvetii  repentino eius adventu commoti cum id quod ipsi diebus XX aegerrime  confecerant, ut flumen transirent, illum uno die fecisse intellegerent,  legatos ad eum mittunt; cuius legationis Divico princeps fuit, qui bello  Cassiano dux Helvetiorum fuerat. Is ita cum Caesare egit: si pacem  populus Romanus cum Helvetiis faceret, in eam partem ituros atque ibi  futuros Helvetios ubi eos Caesar constituisset atque esse voluisset; sin  bello persequi perseveraret, reminisceretur et veteris incommodi populi  Romani et pristinae virtutis Helvetiorum. Quod improviso unum pagum  adortus esset, cum ii qui flumen transissent suis auxilium ferre non  possent, ne ob eam rem aut suae magnopere virtuti tribueret aut ipsos  despiceret. Se ita a patribus maioribusque suis didicisse, ut magis  virtute contenderent quam dolo aut insidiis niterentur. Quare ne  committeret ut is locus ubi constitissent ex calamitate populi Romani et  internecione exercitus nomen caperet aut memoriam proderet.      His Caesar ita respondit: eo sibi minus dubitationis dari, quod eas  res quas legati Helvetii commemorassent memoria teneret, atque eo gravius  ferre quo minus merito populi Romani accidissent; qui si alicuius iniuriae  sibi conscius fuisset, non fuisse difficile cavere; sed eo deceptum, quod  neque commissum a se intellegeret quare timeret neque sine causa timendum  putaret. Quod si veteris contumeliae oblivisci vellet, num etiam  recentium iniuriarum, quod eo invito iter per provinciam per vim  temptassent, quod Haeduos, quod Ambarros, quod Allobrogas vexassent,  memoriam deponere posse? Quod sua victoria tam insolenter gloriarentur  quodque tam diu se impune iniurias tulisse admirarentur, eodem pertinere.    Consuesse enim deos immortales, quo gravius homines ex commutatione rerum  doleant, quos pro scelere eorum ulcisci velint, his secundiores interdum  res et diuturniorem impunitatem concedere. Cum ea ita sint, tamen, si  obsides ab iis sibi dentur, uti ea quae polliceantur facturos intellegat,  et si Haeduis de iniuriis quas ipsis sociisque eorum intulerint, item si  Allobrogibus satis faciunt, sese cum iis pacem esse facturum. Divico  respondit: ita Helvetios a maioribus suis institutos esse uti obsides  accipere, non dare, consuerint; eius rem populum Romanum esse testem. Hoc  responso dato discessit.      Postero die castra ex eo loco movent. Idem facit Caesar equitatumque  omnem, ad numerum quattuor milium, quem ex omni provincia et Haeduis atque  eorum sociis coactum habebat, praemittit, qui videant quas in partes  hostes iter faciant. Qui cupidius novissimum agmen insecuti alieno loco  cum equitatu Helvetiorum proelium committunt; et pauci de nostris cadunt.    Quo proelio sublati Helvetii, quod quingentis equitibus tantam  multitudinem equitum propulerant, audacius subsistere non numquam et  novissimo agmine proelio nostros lacessere coeperunt. Caesar suos a  proelio continebat, ac satis habebat in praesentia hostem rapinis,  pabulationibus populationibusque prohibere. Ita dies circiter XV iter  fecerunt uti inter novissimum hostium agmen et nostrum primum non amplius  quinis aut senis milibus passuum interesset.      Interim cotidie Caesar Haeduos frumentum, quod essent publice  polliciti, flagitare. Nam propter frigora [quod Gallia sub  septentrionibus, ut ante dictum est, posita est,] non modo frumenta in  agris matura non erant, sed ne pabuli quidem satis magna copia suppetebat;  eo autem frumento quod flumine Arari navibus subvexerat propterea uti  minus poterat quod iter ab Arari Helvetii averterant, a quibus discedere  nolebat. Diem ex die ducere Haedui: conferri, comportari, adesse dicere.  Ubi se diutius duci intellexit et diem instare quo die frumentum  militibus metiri oporteret, convocatis eorum principibus, quorum magnam  copiam in castris habebat, in his Diviciaco et Lisco, qui summo  magistratui praeerat, quem vergobretum appellant Haedui, qui creatur  annuus et vitae necisque in suos habet potestatem, graviter eos accusat,  quod, cum neque emi neque ex agris sumi possit, tam necessario tempore,  tam propinquis hostibus ab iis non sublevetur, praesertim cum magna ex  parte eorum precibus adductus bellum susceperit[; multo etiam gravius quod  sit destitutus queritur].      Tum demum Liscus oratione Caesaris adductus quod antea tacuerat  proponit: esse non nullos, quorum auctoritas apud plebem plurimum valeat,  qui privatim plus possint quam ipsi magistratus. Hos seditiosa atque  improba oratione multitudinem deterrere, ne frumentum conferant quod  debeant: praestare, si iam principatum Galliae obtinere non possint,  Gallorum quam Romanorum imperia perferre, neque dubitare [debeant] quin,  si Helvetios superaverint Romani, una cum reliqua Gallia Haeduis  libertatem sint erepturi. Ab isdem nostra consilia quaeque in castris  gerantur hostibus enuntiari; hos a se coerceri non posse. Quin etiam,  quod necessariam rem coactus Caesari enuntiarit, intellegere sese quanto  id cum periculo fecerit, et ob eam causam quam diu potuerit tacuisse.      Caesar hac oratione Lisci Dumnorigem, Diviciaci fratrem, designari  sentiebat, sed, quod pluribus praesentibus eas res iactari nolebat,  celeriter concilium dimittit, Liscum retinet. Quaerit ex solo ea quae in  conventu dixerat. Dicit liberius atque audacius. Eadem secreto ab aliis  quaerit; reperit esse vera: ipsum esse Dumnorigem, summa audacia, magna  apud plebem propter liberalitatem gratia, cupidum rerum novarum.    Complures annos portoria reliquaque omnia Haeduorum vectigalia parvo  pretio redempta habere, propterea quod illo licente contra liceri audeat  nemo. His rebus et suam rem familiarem auxisse et facultates ad  largiendum magnas comparasse; magnum umerum equitatus suo sumptu semper  alere et circum se habere, neque solum domi, sed etiam apud finitimas  civitates largiter posse, atque huius potentiae causa matrem in  Biturigibus homini illic nobilissimo ac potentissimo conlocasse; ipsum ex  Helvetiis uxorem habere, sororum ex matre et propinquas suas nuptum in  alias civitates conlocasse. Favere et cupere Helvetiis propter eam  adfinitatem, odisse etiam suo nomine Caesarem et Romanos, quod eorum  adventu potentia eius deminuta et Diviciacus frater in antiquum locum  gratiae atque honoris sit restitutus. Si quid accidat Romanis, summam in  spem per Helvetios regni obtinendi venire; imperio populi Romani non modo  de regno, sed etiam de ea quam habeat gratia desperare. Reperiebat etiam  in quaerendo Caesar, quod proelium equestre adversum paucis ante diebus  esset factum, initium eius fugae factum a Dumnorige atque eius equitibus  (nam equitatui, quem auxilio Caesari Haedui miserant, Dumnorix praeerat):    eorum fuga reliquum esse equitatum perterritum.      Quibus rebus cognitis, cum ad has suspiciones certissimae res  accederent, quod per fines Sequanorum Helvetios traduxisset, quod obsides  inter eos dandos curasset, quod ea omnia non modo iniussu suo et civitatis  sed etiam inscientibus ipsis fecisset, quod a magistratu Haeduorum  accusaretur, satis esse causae arbitrabatur quare in eum aut ipse  animadverteret aut civitatem animadvertere iuberet. His omnibus rebus  unum repugnabat, quod Diviciaci fratris summum in populum Romanum studium,  summum in se voluntatem, egregiam fidem, iustitiam, temperantiam  cognoverat; nam ne eius supplicio Diviciaci animum offenderet verebatur.    Itaque prius quam quicquam conaretur, Diviciacum ad se vocari iubet et,  cotidianis interpretibus remotis, per C. Valerium Troucillum, principem  Galliae provinciae, familiarem suum, cui summam omnium rerum fidem  habebat, cum eo conloquitur; simul commonefacit quae ipso praesente in  concilio [Gallorum] de Dumnorige sint dicta, et ostendit quae separatim  quisque de eo apud se dixerit. Petit atque hortatur ut sine eius  offensione animi vel ipse de eo causa cognita statuat vel civitatem  statuere iubeat.      Diviciacus multis cum"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21823"],[0,"The Butterfly's Ball and the Grasshopper's Feast (#2)"],[1,"id, as the Mole appeared,  dusting the earth off his coat and white hat.    The Mole answered that he had been very busy all morning making a new  tunnel between his bed-room and drawing-room.  He then took his friend's  arm, and away they went over the green meadows, where the cowslips and  buttercups grew, making the grass look as if it were dotted all over  with gold.  Sometimes the two friends stopped by the way to rest under a  buttercup, and sip a little morning dew; but seeing every one hastening  past them, while they wasted their time, the Dormouse jumped up again,  and cast a sly look at his blind friend as he asked him what he thought  of the fine view.    \"Don't make jokes about my being blind,\" said the Mole, pretending to be  angry.    Just at that moment they both ran into a Spider's web.    \"Oh! how stupid of me,\" cried the Dormouse; \"I wasn't looking before me  at the time.\"    \"You might as well be without eyes, if you don't use them,\" said the  Mole, as they cleared away the threads of the net, and, making a low bow  to the Spider, went on their way.    Now, all this time the Snail had been slowly creeping over the stones  and winding round the blades of grass and flowers that strewed her path  to the place of meeting.  But she was so long of getting there that the  guests began to be impatient, and said that perhaps she was not coming  at all.  She lived under the next tree, and had only about four feet to  walk, but she was so very slow that she took a long, long time to it;  and at last the Grasshopper whispered to the Butterfly that she should  go and meet her.  Away went the Butterfly on her gaudy wings, and,  alighting by the Snail's side, began to urge her to make haste.  During  the Butterfly's absence, the Wasp, who was always making spiteful  remarks, said that it was shameful in the Snail to keep them waiting;  but the Humble-bee, who was walking up and down conversing with a Midge,  turned round and said, \"Remember, you Wasp, that you have not brought  your sting with you to-day, so pray do not give way to your spiteful  nature.  The poor Snail has to carry her house on her back, so we should  not be angry at her slowness.\"  Some of the other insects said that this  was no excuse for the Snail, because she knew that she walked very  slowly, and should therefore have set out sooner.    \"Come, come,\" cried a young Frog, jumping forward, \"no fighting to-day,  ladies and gentlemen.  We have come here to be happy; and here comes the  Snail at last.\"    As he spoke, the Butterfly flew towards them, and the Snail crawled in,  took off her bonnet, put on her spectacles, and sat down; while the  waiters bustled about, placed stools for the guests, and brought in the  repast.    ------------------------------------------------------------------------      A Mushroom the table, and on it was spread    A Water-dock leaf, which their table-cloth made;    The viands were various, to each of their taste,    And the Bee brought the honey to sweeten the feast.    It was, perhaps, the strangest dinner-party that ever was seen.  There  were such a multitude of odd creatures, of all shapes and sizes and  colours; some of whom were by nature bitter enemies, and would have  fought and killed each other had they met in the woods while taking a  walk, but were quite civil and polite to one another, now that they met  as guests in Mrs Butterfly's bower.  Indeed, many of them wished that  they could be such good friends at all times as they were then.    All the party had now arrived, and there was a great deal of talking,  and buzzing, and humming, and jesting, as they sat round the table and  feasted on the good things placed before them.  The table was a  mushroom, covered with a table-cloth of water-dock leaf, and on it were  placed all the delicious dishes of the woods.  The Dormouse brought a  good deal of wheat, oats, and barley.  The Squirrel brought a bagful of  nuts.  The Humble-bee brought a quantity of fine honey in the comb,  which was declared to be most excellent.  In short, every one brought  something or other; so that, when all was spread out beside the good  things supplied by Mrs Butterfly and Mr Grasshopper, it seemed the  grandest feast that ever was heard of.  Such fun there was, to be sure!  And such a multitude of voices talking all at once.    \"My dear,\" cried the Butterfly across the table to the Grasshopper, \"I  hope you are attending to your friends there.  See that you give them  enough to eat, and plenty of mountain-dew to drink.\"    \"Yes, yes, my love,\" replied the Grasshopper as well as he could for  laughing at the jokes of a bloated old Spider that sat beside him.  Then  the Grasshopper called to the Butterfly to send him a slice of wheat;  but, as the noise prevented his being heard, he jumped over the table at  one bound, helped himself, and bounded back again.  Two or three young  Crickets and five or six Midges sat at a little side mushroom.  They  made more noise than all the grownup people put together; and the lady  Butterfly looked round at them with a smile once or twice, quite  delighted to see them so happy, and to hear their merry voices ringing  through the woods.    ------------------------------------------------------------------------      With steps more majestic the Snail did advance,    And he promised the gazers a minuet dance;    But they all laughed so loudly, he pulled in his head,    And went, in his own little chamber, to bed.    After dinner the ball began, and it was the strangest ball that ever was  seen.  The trumpeter Gadfly and a number of his relations, besides  several Grasshoppers and Bees, were the chief musicians.  They wanted a  bass very much at first, but the Bull-frog offered his services,  although he confessed that he was accustomed to sing alone.  Then the  gentlemen drew on their gloves, flattened their wings, pulled up their  collars, and coiled away their tails; while the ladies tightened their  garters, ruffled their feathers, and put out their feelers.  Oh how they  did dance! reels were nothing to it.  The greatest difficulty was to  keep the Grasshoppers in order.  They became so excited that they sprang  quite out of sight every moment, and so lost their partners, and ran  against everybody in searching for them.  Then the Bull-frog, who sang  bass, got a little too much of the dew, and sang so loudly, that he  quite drowned all the other players.  So Mrs Butterfly put her claws in  her ears, and running up to him, said, \"Oh! dear Mr Bull-frog, pray do  not sing quite so loudly.\"  The poor Bull-frog was almost weeping with  joy at the merry scene before him, but he blushed very green on hearing  this, and said he had forgotten what he was doing, but would try to be  more careful.  However, in five minutes more he was worse than ever, so  they sent a few hundred bees to sing treble beside him, and try to keep  him in order.  In the middle of all this there was a sudden stop, and a  Snail, stepping forward, offered to dance a minuet.  This was received  with such a roar of laughter that the poor snail, half frightened, half  angry, drew in his horns and went to bed on the spot, and the dance was  begun anew.  By this time the Gnats and Midges, and some of the other  flies, had left the ground and retired to enjoy a cool dance in the air.  Two or three Spiders mounted up into the oak, and fastened threads to  some of the branches, by which they dropped suddenly down among the  dancers, and, seizing their partners round the waist, carried them  screaming in among the leaves.  So the fun and the noise became louder  and louder.  On the ground, under the bushes, among the branches of the  trees, and in the air, the dancers bounded, skipped, laughed, sang,  shouted, and flew in a way that had never been seen or heard of before.  The merry old Bull-frog became quite absurd.  He sang and roared like a  lion; took up all the young insects in his arms and hugged them; tumbled  over the other musicians, and, in short, did so many wild things that  they were at length obliged to tie him to a paddock-stool, where they  left him to enjoy himself.    ------------------------------------------------------------------------      Then, as evening gave way to the shadows of night,    Their watchman, the Glow-worm, came out with his light;    So home let us hasten, while yet we can see,    For no watchman is waiting for you or for me.    The sun went down at last, but still the dancers continued their sport  under the old oak-tree, when suddenly a clear, beautiful light streamed  across the turf.  It was the Glow-worm's light.    \"How charming!\" exclaimed the Butterfly.  \"It is such a sweet, subdued  light.\"    \"Rather too much subdued,\" growled the blundering Black Beetle, as he  tripped over a twig and pulled his partner, a humble-bee, down with him;  \"couldn't you shine a little brighter--eh?\"    The Glow-worm shook his head.  \"Couldn't give you another ray to save my  life,\" he said; \"but if you send for a few of my friends, they will be  happy to come and help me, no doubt.\"    \"A good suggestion,\" said the Black Beetle, assisting his partner to  rise.    \"Oh, my poor frock,\" cried the Humble-bee, gazing sadly at a long rent  in the skirt.    \"Never mind, let's have at it again,\" cried the Beetle, seizing her  round the waist, and blundering on again in a furious gallop of his own  invention.    \"Whom shall I send for the Glow-worm's relations?\" muttered the  Butterfly to herself.    \"Send the Snail,\" said a lively young Cricket, who had devoted himself  to doing mischief during the whole evening.    \"Peace, little goose,\" replied the Butterfly, tapping the Cricket on the  nose with her fan, and hastening towards the Grasshopper, who was still  enthralled and convulsed by the bloated old Spider.    \"Whom should we send, my dear!\" said the Grasshopper, in reply to the  Butterfly's question; \"the Fly footman, to be sure; and pray tell"]]]
