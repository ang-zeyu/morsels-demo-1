At that time, he seemed hardly to appreciate  their full value and importance. To my colleague, Professor G.L.  Kittredge, probably the most eminent authority on folk-song in  America, this value and importance appeared as indubitable as it  appeared to me. We heartily joined in encouraging the work, as a real  contribution both to literature and to learning. The present volume is  the first published result of these efforts.    The value and importance of the work seems to me double. One phase of  it is perhaps too highly special ever to be popular. Whoever has begun  the inexhaustibly fascinating study of popular song and literature--of  the nameless poetry which vigorously lives through the centuries--must  be perplexed by the necessarily conjectural opinions concerning its  origin and development held by various and disputing scholars. When  songs were made in times and terms which for centuries have been not  living facts but facts of remote history or tradition, it is impossible  to be sure quite how they begun, and by quite what means they sifted  through the centuries into the forms at last securely theirs,  in the final rigidity of print. In this collection of American  ballads, almost if not quite uniquely, it is possible to trace the  precise manner in which songs and cycles of song--obviously analogous  to those surviving from older and antique times--have come into being.  The facts which are still available concerning the ballads of our own  Southwest are such as should go far to prove, or to disprove, many of  the theories advanced concerning the laws of literature as evinced in  the ballads of the old world.    Such learned matter as this, however, is not so surely within my  province, who have made no technical study of literary origins, as is  the other consideration which made me feel, from my first knowledge of  these ballads, that they are beyond dispute valuable and important. In  the ballads of the old world, it is not historical or philological  considerations which most readers care for. It is the wonderful,  robust vividness of their artless yet supremely true utterance; it is  the natural vigor of their surgent, unsophisticated human rhythm. It  is the sense, derived one can hardly explain how, that here is  expression straight from the heart of humanity; that here is something  like the sturdy root from which the finer, though not always more  lovely, flowers of polite literature have sprung. At times when we  yearn for polite grace, ballads may seem rude; at times when polite  grace seems tedious, sophisticated, corrupt, or mendacious, their very  rudeness refreshes us with a new sense of brimming life. To  compare the songs collected by Professor Lomax with the immortalities  of olden time is doubtless like comparing the literature of America  with that of all Europe together. Neither he nor any of us would  pretend these verses to be of supreme power and beauty. None the less,  they seem to me, and to many who have had a glimpse of them,  sufficiently powerful, and near enough beauty, to give us some such  wholesome and enduring pleasure as comes from work of this kind proved  and acknowledged to be masterly.    What I mean may best be implied, perhaps, by a brief statement of  fact. Four or five years ago, Professor Lomax, at my request, read  some of these ballads to one of my classes at Harvard, then engaged in  studying the literary history of America. From that hour to the  present, the men who heard these verses, during the cheerless progress  of a course of study, have constantly spoken of them and written of  them, as of something sure to linger happily in memory. As such I  commend them to all who care for the native poetry of America.                                                 BARRETT WENDELL.  Nahant, Massachusetts,  July 11, 1910.          COLLECTOR'S NOTE      Out in the wild, far-away places of the big and still unpeopled  west,--in the canons along the Rocky Mountains, among the mining camps  of Nevada and Montana, and on the remote cattle ranches of Texas, New  Mexico, and Arizona,--yet survives the Anglo-Saxon ballad spirit that  was active in secluded districts in England and Scotland even after  the coming of Tennyson and Browning. This spirit is manifested both in  the preservation of the English ballad and in the creation of local  songs. Illiterate people, and people cut off from newspapers and  books, isolated and lonely,--thrown back on primal resources for  entertainment and for the expression of emotion,--utter themselves  through somewhat the same character of songs as did their forefathers  of perhaps a thousand years ago. In some such way have been made and  preserved the cowboy songs and other frontier ballads contained in  this volume. The songs represent the operation of instinct and  tradition. They are chiefly interesting to the present generation,  however, because of the light they throw on the conditions of pioneer  life, and more particularly because of the information they contain  concerning that unique and romantic figure in modern civilization, the  American cowboy.    The profession of cow-punching, not yet a lost art in a group  of big western states, reached its greatest prominence during the  first two decades succeeding the Civil War. In Texas, for example,  immense tracts of open range, covered with luxuriant grass, encouraged  the raising of cattle. One person in many instances owned thousands.  To care for the cattle during the winter season, to round them up in  the spring and mark and brand the yearlings, and later to drive from  Texas to Fort Dodge, Kansas, those ready for market, required large  forces of men. The drive from Texas to Kansas came to be known as  \"going up the trail,\" for the cattle really made permanent, deep-cut  trails across the otherwise trackless hills and plains of the long  way. It also became the custom to take large herds of young steers  from Texas as far north as Montana, where grass at certain seasons  grew more luxuriant than in the south. Texas was the best breeding  ground, while the climate and grass of Montana developed young cattle  for the market.    A trip up the trail made a distinct break in the monotonous life of  the big ranches, often situated hundreds of miles from where the  conventions of society were observed. The ranch community consisted  usually of the boss, the straw-boss, the cowboys proper, the horse  wrangler, and the cook--often a negro. These men lived on terms of  practical equality. Except in the case of the boss, there was little  difference in the amounts paid each for his services. Society,  then, was here reduced to its lowest terms. The work of the men, their  daily experiences, their thoughts, their interests, were all in  common. Such a community had necessarily to turn to itself for  entertainment. Songs sprang up naturally, some of them tender and  familiar lays of childhood, others original compositions, all genuine,  however crude and unpolished. Whatever the most gifted man could  produce must bear the criticism of the entire camp, and agree with the  ideas of "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2131"],[0,"An Account of Egypt (#2)"],[1,"land. Then secondly, as to Egypt itself, the  extent of it along the sea is sixty _schoines_, according to our  definition of Egypt as extending from the Gulf of Plinthine to the  Serbonian lake, along which stretches Mount Casion; from this lake then  the sixty _schoines_ are reckoned: for those of men who are poor in  land have their country measured by fathoms, those who are less poor by  furlongs, those who have much land by parasangs, and those who have  land in very great abundance by _schoines_: now the parasang is equal  to thirty furlongs, and each _schoine_, which is an Egyptian measure, is  equal to sixty furlongs. So there would be an extent of three thousand  six hundred furlongs for the coast-land of Egypt. From thence and as  far as Heliopolis inland Egypt is broad, and the land is all flat and  without springs of water and formed of mud: and the road as one goes  inland from the sea to Heliopolis is about the same in length as that  which leads from the altar of the twelve gods at Athens to Pisa and the  temple of Olympian Zeus: reckoning up you would find the difference  very small by which these roads fail of being equal in length, not more  indeed than fifteen furlongs; for the road from Athens to Pisa wants  fifteen furlongs of being fifteen hundred, while the road to Heliopolis  from the sea reaches that number completely. From Heliopolis however,  as you go up, Egypt is narrow; for on the one side a mountain-range  belonging to Arabia stretches along by the side of it, going in a  direction from the North towards the midday and the South Wind, tending  upwards without a break to that which is called the Erythraian Sea, in  which range are the stone-quarries which were used in cutting stone for  the pyramids at Memphis. On this side then the mountain ends where I  have said, and then takes a turn back; and where it is widest, as I was  informed, it is a journey of two months across from East to West;  and the borders of it which turn towards the East are said to produce  frankincense. Such then is the nature of this mountain-range; and on the  side of Egypt towards Libya another range extends, rocky and enveloped  in sand: in this are the pyramids, and it runs in the same direction  as those parts of the Arabian mountains which go towards the midday. So  then, I say, from Heliopolis the land has no longer a great extent so  far as it belongs to Egypt, and for about four days' sail up the  river Egypt properly so called is narrow: and the space between the  mountain-ranges which have been mentioned is plain-land, but where it is  narrowest it did not seem to me to exceed two hundred furlongs from the  Arabian mountains to those which are called the Libyan. After this again  Egypt is broad. Such is the nature of this land: and from Heliopolis to  Thebes is a voyage up the river of nine days, and the distance of the  journey in furlongs is four thousand eight hundred and sixty, the number  of _schoines_ being eighty-one. If these measures of Egypt in furlongs  be put together, the result is as follows:--I have already before this  shown that the distance along the sea amounts to three thousand six  hundred furlongs, and I will now declare what the distance is inland  from the sea to Thebes, namely six thousand one hundred and twenty  furlongs: and again the distance from Thebes to the city called  Elephantine is one thousand eight hundred furlongs.    Of this land then, concerning which I have spoken, it seemed to myself  also, according as the priests said, that the greater part had been won  as an addition by the Egyptians; for it was evident to me that the  space between the aforesaid mountain-ranges, which lie above the city  of Memphis, once was a gulf of the sea, like the regions about Ilion and  Teuthrania and Ephesos and the plain of the Maiander, if it be permitted  to compare small things with great; and small these are in comparison,  for of the rivers which heaped up the soil in those regions none is  worthy to be compared in volume with a single one of the mouths of the  Nile, which has five mouths. Moreover there are other rivers also, not  in size at all equal to the Nile, which have performed great feats; of  which I can mention the names of several, and especially the Acheloos,  which flowing through Acarnania and so issuing out into the sea has  already made half of the Echinades from islands into mainland. Now there  is in the land of Arabia, not far from Egypt, a gulf of the sea running  in from that which is called the Erythraian Sea, very long and narrow,  as I am about to tell. With respect to the length of the voyage along  it, one who set out from the innermost point to sail out through it into  the open sea, would spend forty days upon the voyage, using oars; and  with respect to breadth, where the gulf is broadest it is half a day's  sail across: and there is in it an ebb and flow of tide every day. Just  such another gulf I suppose that Egypt was, and that the one ran in  towards Ethiopia from the Northern Sea, and the other, the Arabian,  of which I am about to speak, tended from the South towards Syria,  the gulfs boring in so as almost to meet at their extreme points, and  passing by one another with but a small space left between. If then the  stream of the Nile should turn aside into this Arabian gulf, what would  hinder that gulf from being filled up with silt as the river continued  to flow, at all events within a period of twenty thousand years? indeed  for my part I am of the opinion that it would be filled up even within  ten thousand years. How, then, in all the time that has elapsed before I  came into being should not a gulf be filled up even of much greater size  than this by a river so great and so active? As regards Egypt then, I  both believe those who say that things are so, and for myself also I am  strongly of opinion that they are so; because I have observed that Egypt  runs out into the sea further than the adjoining land, and that shells  are found upon the mountains of it, and an efflorescence of salt forms  upon the surface, so that even the pyramids are being eaten away by it,  and moreover that of all the mountains of Egypt, the range which lies  above Memphis is the only one which has sand: besides which I notice  that Egypt resembles neither the land of Arabia, which borders upon it,  nor Libya, nor yet Syria (for they are Syrians who dwell in the parts  of Arabia lying along the sea), but that it has soil which is black and  easily breaks up, seeing that it is in truth mud and silt brought down  from Ethiopia by the river: but the soil of Libya, we know, is reddish  in colour and rather sandy, while that of Arabia and Syria is somewhat  clayey and rocky. The priests also gave me a strong proof concerning  this land as follows, namely that in the reign of king Moiris, whenever  the river reached a height of at least eight cubits it watered Egypt  below Memphis; and not yet nine hundred years had gone by since the  death of Moiris, when I heard these things from the priests: now  however, unless the river rises to sixteen cubits, or fifteen at the  least, it does not go over the land. I think too that those Egyptians  who dwell below the lake of Moiris and especially in that region which  is called the Delta, if that land continues to grow in height according  to this proportion and to increase similarly in extent, will suffer for  all remaining time, from the Nile not overflowing their land, that same  thing which they themselves said that the Hellenes would at some time  suffer: for hearing that the whole land of the Hellenes has rain and is  not watered by rivers as theirs is, they said that the Hellenes would at  some time be disappointed of a great hope and would suffer the ills of  famine. This saying means that if the god shall not send them rain, but  shall allow drought to prevail for a long time, the Hellenes will be  destroyed by hunger; for they have in fact no other supply of water  to save them except from Zeus alone. This has been rightly said by  the Egyptians with reference to the Hellenes: but now let me tell  how matters are with the Egyptians themselves in their turn. If, in  accordance with what I before said, their land below Memphis (for  this is that which is increasing) shall continue to increase in height  according to the same proportion as in the past time, assuredly those  Egyptians who dwell here will suffer famine, if their land shall not  have rain nor the river be able to go over their fields. It is certain  however that now they gather in fruit from the earth with less labour  than any other men and also with less than the other Egyptians; for they  have no labour in breaking up furrows with a plough nor in hoeing nor in  any other of those labours which other men have about a crop; but when  the river has come up of itself and watered their fields and after  watering has left them again, then each man sows his own field and turns  into it swine, and when he has trodden the seed into the ground by  means of the swine, after that he waits for the harvest, and when he has  threshed the corn by means of the swine, then he gathers it in.    If we desire to follow the opinions of the Ionians as regards Egypt, who  say that the Delta alone is Egypt, reckoning its sea-coast to be from  the watch-tower called of Perseus to the fish-curing houses of Pelusion,  a distance of forty _schoines_, and counting it to extend inland as far  as the city of Kercasoros, where the Nile divides and runs to Pelusion  and Canobos, while as for the rest of Egypt, they assign it partly to  Libya and partly to Arabia,--if, I say, we should follow this account,  we should thereby declare that in former times the Egyptians had no land  to live in; for, as we have seen, their Delta at any rate is alluvial,  and has appeared (so to speak) lately, as the Egyptians themselves say  and as my opinion is. If then at the first there was no "]]]
