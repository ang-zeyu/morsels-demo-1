But it was too far away for him, and  it struck slantingly on one of the back posts, rolling off toward the  grandstand.    \"Line it out, Jack! Don't be fooling with fouls!\" yelled Fred Rover.    \"Show 'em where the river is!\" added Randy Rover.    The next ball to come in was a wide out-curve, and again Jack let it  pass him.    \"Ball two!\" shouted the umpire.    \"That's the way to do it, Jack! Make 'em give you what you want!\"    With two balls against him, the noted pitcher for the high school  exercised a little more care in his next delivery. He sent in a  straight, swift one, directly over the outer point of the plate. It  was not exactly what Jack desired, but it was good enough, and he  swung at it with all his strength. Crack! And the ball went sailing  directly over the head of the shortstop and into the field beyond.    \"Run, Jack! Run! It's good for a two-bagger!\"    \"Leg it, Dan! Leg it for home!\"    \"Send the ball in, Wiffles! Don't let 'em get home!\"    These and a hundred other cries rang out as nearly every spectator  sprang to his or her feet in the excitement. Dan Soppinger, half way  to third when Jack made the hit, had now touched that bag and was  tearing for the home plate.    In the meantime Jack, running like a deer, had passed first and was  making for second. The shortstop had made a high but ineffectual jump  for the ball, and now he and the fielder behind him were both after  the sphere. There was a short mix-up, and then the fielder sent the  ball with unerring aim toward the catcher at the home plate.    \"Slide, Dan, slide!\"    And then Dan Soppinger, running as he had never run before, dropped  down and slid to the plate amid a whirl of dust, followed instantly by  the ball, which landed with a thud in the catcher's mitt.    \"He's safe! He's safe!\"    \"And look! Jack Rover is going to make third!\"    Realizing that it was too late to catch the man at the plate, the  catcher threw the ball down to second. But Jack Rover had already  started for third, and now he streaked along with all his might,  arriving at that bag just an instant before the ball followed him.    \"That's the way to do it, boy! Keep it up!\"    \"Oh, he made three bases!\" cried one of the girls in the grandstand.  \"Isn't that just lovely?\"    \"I told you he'd do it, Ruth,\" said another of the girls.    \"I wish my cousin Dick was coming up,\" remarked one of the girls. \"I'm  sure he would be able to help them out.\"    \"Never mind, May. He'll be coming up pretty soon,\" answered Ruth  Stevenson.    The next cadet to the bat was Walt Baxter. Walt was a good all-around  player, but just at present he was not in the best of condition,  having suffered from a touch of the grippe early in the season.    \"Bang out a homer, Walt!\" sang out Andy Rover.    \"Never mind that, Walt. Make a safe hit and bring Jack in,\" said Gif  Garrison.    \"I'll do my best,\" answered Walt Baxter. But it was plainly to be seen  that his recent illness had rendered him somewhat nervous. He had a  ball and a strike called on him, and then got another strike through a  little foul that passed over one of the coaches' heads. Then Dink  Wilsey passed him a slow, tantalizing ball. Walt connected with it but  sent up only a pop fly, which the third baseman gathered in with ease.    \"Hurrah! that's the way to hold 'em down,\" came the cry from one of  the high-school boys.    \"Gee, old man, it's too bad you didn't have a chance to bring that run  in,\" remarked Gif Garrison to Jack Rover, as the latter walked in from  third base.    \"Well, anyway, I brought Dan in,\" returned Jack, as cheerfully as he  could.    \"Yes; but if you had got in that would have tied the score,\" went on  the manager. \"However, the game isn't over yet.\"    \"Over! Why, we've just begun to play!\" returned Jack, with a grin.    \"That's the talk!\" cried Andy Rover. \"Colby Hall forever! Now then,  boys, all together!\" he yelled, turning to the grandstand. And a  moment later there boomed out this refrain:        \"Who are we?       Can't you see?       Colby Hall!       Dum! Dum! Dum, dum, dum!       Here we come with fife and drum!       Colby! Colby! Colby Hall!\"    And then followed a great yelling and tooting of horns and sounding of  rattles.    \"My gracious! if they keep on I'll surely become deaf,\" said Martha  Rover.    \"I think I had better retire from this game,\" remarked Walt Baxter, as  he faced the manager. \"I told you I didn't feel like going in, and  now I am sure I should have kept out of it.\"    \"All right, Walt. I'll be sorry to lose you,\" answered Gif. And then  he told Andy Rover to get ready to get into the game.    With a score still 4 to 3 in their favor, Hixley High opened the  seventh inning with vigor. They managed to get a man on first, and  then on a sacrifice advanced him to second. Then came a two-bagger,  and the play made by Colby Hall in the ending of the sixth inning was  repeated by their opponents, thus making the score 5 to 3.    On their part Colby Hall tried its best to score during the seventh,  but was doomed to disappointment.    Then came the eighth inning with a goose egg placed on the board for  each nine.    \"Say, this begins to look bad for us,\" remarked Will Hendry, the  fattest boy at Colby Hall. \"It looks as if Hixley High was going to  have a sweet revenge.\"    In the Hixley High half of the ninth inning Dink Wilsey showed what a  very good all-around player he was. The noted pitcher cracked out a  home run, making the tally with ease. Fortunately this was at a time  when there was no one on base, so that only one run was scored. Two  men were out, and the next player knocked a fly to short, which was  gathered in by Frank Newberry with ease.    \"Hurrah! Score another for Hixley High!\"    \"That makes the score six to three!\"    \"I guess this game is as good as won!\"    So the cries ran on among the high-school scholars and their friends.  The Colby Hall contingent was, of course, much downcast, but they  refused to show it, and once more the slogan of the military academy  boomed forth.    \"Now, boys, pull yourselves together and go at 'em hammer and tongs,\"  cried Gif Garrison. \"Watch the pitcher. Don't let Dink put anything  over you.\"    Fred Rover was at the bat, and he managed to make a safe hit. He was  followed by a player who made another safe hit, thus advancing Fred to  second. Then came two outs, but in the mix-up Fred managed to steal to  third, while the player on first got down to second. Jack Rover was  now once more to the bat, and all of his friends were yelling at the  top of their lungs for him to \"Knock the hide off the ball!\" \"Send it  over the back fence!\" \"Show 'em where the other side of the river is!\"  and to \"Wipe up the field with Hixley High!\"    One ball was called, and then a strike. Then came another strike, and  things began to look gloomy for Colby Hall. But then Jack got a ball  exactly where he wanted it, and he swung at it with every ounce of  muscle he could command. Crack! went the bat, and the sphere went  sailing far down in left field.    \"That's the way to do it! Run, boys, run!\"    \"Come on home, Jack!\"    Fred, on third, was already streaking for home, and close behind him  came the player who had been on second. In the meanwhile, Jack raced  to first and around to second, and then came plowing up to third.    \"Hold it, Rover! Hold it!\"    \"Come on in--don't wait! Come on in!\"    Jack looked down into the field and saw that the fielder was just in  the act of picking up the ball. With a great bound, he started for the  home plate, and when ten feet from that place dropped to the ground  and slid in with the rapidity of lightning.    \"He's safe! A home run!\"    \"That ties the score!\"    \"Now then, boys, go in and finish 'em up!\"    The din and excitement was now tremendous. The score was indeed a tie.  Which club would win?          CHAPTER II    ABOUT THE ROVER BOYS      \"Now then, fellows, don't forget to bring in the winning run!\"    \"Show Hixley High what we can do!\"    And then came a rousing cheer from the Colby Hall cadets, and once  more they gave the well-known military academy refrain.    Any ordinary pitcher might have been nervous over the prospect ahead  of him; but Dink Wilsey was not one of that caliber, and he faced the  next batsman as coolly as he had all of the others. Two balls were  called, and then two strikes, and then two more balls, and the batsman  walked to first base.    \"Hurrah! he's afraid to give him the kind we chew up.\"    \"Maybe he'll let the next man walk, too!\" cried another.    But this was not to be. The next cadet up went out on a foul, and the  inning came to a sudden end.    \"A tie! A tie! The game is a tie!\"    \"Now for the winning run! Hixley High!\"    \"That's the stuff! Larsen to the bat! And, my, won't he wallop that  ball!\"    Larsen was the Hixley High center fielder--a tall, sturdy youth with  blue eyes and light hair, of Norwegian descent. He came to the plate  with a \"do-or-die\" look on his face. He allowed two balls to pass him,  only one of which, however, was called a strike. Then he made a sweep  for the next ball, sending it out in a red-hot liner toward Jack.    Many a young ball player would have stepped out of the way with such a  red-hot variety of baseball coming his way. But not so Jack Rover.  Like a flash his hands went out and he caught the ball firmly,  although the impact of the sphere whirled him half way around.    \"Gee, look at that!\"    \"I wouldn't have caught that ball for a thousand dollars!\"    A great shout of approval rang out, and during this Gif hurried over  to Jack's side.    \"How about it--did it hurt you any?\" he questioned quickly.    \"It stung me a little, that's all,\" was Jack's reply. His hands burnt  like fire, but he did not intend to let anybody know it.    \"One down!

Chinese Terms for God.--Before passing to the firmer ground,  historically speaking, of the Chou dynasty, it may be as well to state  here that there are two terms in ancient Chinese literature which seem  to be used indiscriminately for God. One is _T'ien_, which has come  to include the material heavens, the sky; and the other is _Shang Ti_,  which has come to include the spirits of deceased Emperors. These two  terms appear simultaneously, so to speak, in the earliest documents  which have come down to us, dating back to something like the twentieth  century before Christ. Priority, however, belongs beyond all doubt to  _T'ien_, which it would have been more natural to find meaning, first  the visible heavens, and secondly the Deity, whose existence beyond the  sky would be inferred from such phenomena as lightning, thunder, wind,  and rain. But the process appears to have been the other way, so far at  any rate as the written language is concerned. The Chinese script, when  it first came into existence, was purely pictorial, and confined to  visible objects which were comparatively easy to depict. There does not  seem to have been any attempt to draw a picture of the sky. On the other  hand, the character _T'ien_ was just such a representation of a human  being as would be expected from the hand of a prehistoric artist;  and under this unmistakable shape the character appears on bells and  tripods, as seen in collections of inscriptions, so late as the sixth  and seventh centuries B.C., after which the head is flattered to a line,  and the arms are raised until they form another line parallel to that of  the head.    Distinction between T'ien and Shang Ti.--The term _Shang Ti_ means  literally Supreme Ruler. It is not quite so vague as _T'ien_, which  seems to be more of an abstraction, while _Shang Ti_ is a genuinely  personal God. Reference to _T'ien_ is usually associated with fate or  destiny, calamities, blessings, prayers for help, etc. The commandments  of _T'ien_ are hard to obey; He is compassionate, to be feared, unjust,  and cruel. _Shang Ti_ lives in heaven, walks, leaves tracks on the  ground, enjoys the sweet savour of sacrifice, approves or disapproves  of conduct, deals with rewards and punishments in a more particular way,  and comes more actually into touch with the human race.    Thus _Shang Ti_ would be the God who walked in the garden in the cool of  the day, the God who smelled the sweet savour of Noah's sacrifice, and  the God who allowed Moses to see His back. _T'ien_ would be the God of  Gods of the Psalms, whose mercy endureth for ever; the everlasting God  of Isaiah, who fainteth not, neither is weary.    Roman Catholic Dissensions.--These two, in fact, were the very terms  favoured by the early Jesuit missionaries to China, though not with the  limitations above suggested, as fit the proper renderings for God; and  of the two terms the great Manchu Emperor K'ang Hsi chose _T'ien_. It  has been thought that the conversion of China to Christianity under the  guiding influence of the Jesuits would soon have become an accomplished  fact, but for the ignorant opposition to the use of these terms by the  Franciscans and Dominicans, who referred this question, among others, to  the Pope. In 1704 Clement XI published a bull declaring that the Chinese  equivalent for God was _T'ien Chu_=Lord of Heaven; and such it has  continued to be ever since, so far as the Roman Catholic church is  concerned, in spite of the fact that _T'ien Chu_ was a name given at the  close of the third century B.C. to one of the Eight Spirits.    The two Terms are One.--That the two terms refer in Chinese thought to  one and the same Being, though possibly with differing attributes, even  down to modern times, may be seen from the account of a dream by the  Emperor Yung Lo, A.D. 1403-1425, in which His Majesty relates that an  angel appeared to him, with a message from _Shang Ti_; upon which the  Emperor remarked, \"Is not this a command from _T'ien_?\" A comparison  might perhaps be instituted with the use of \"God\" and \"Jehovah\" in  the Bible. At the same time it must be noted that this view was not  suggested by the Emperor K'ang Hsi, who fixed upon _T'ien_ as the  appropriate term. It is probable that, vigorous Confucianist as he was,  he was anxious to appear on the side rather of an abstract than of  a personal Deity, and that he was repelled by the overwrought  anthropomorphism of the Christian God. His conversion was said to have  been very near at times; we read, however, that, when hard pressed by  the missionaries to accept baptism, \"he always excused himself by saying  that he worshipped the same God as the Christians.\"    God in the \"Odes.\"--The Chou dynasty lasted from B.C. 1122 to B.C.  255. It was China's feudal age, when the empire, then included between  latitude 34-40 and longitude 109-118, was split up into a number of  vassal States, which owned allegiance to a suzerain State. And it is to  the earlier centuries of the Chou dynasty that must be attributed the  composition of a large number of ballads of various kinds, ultimately  collected and edited by Confucius, and now known as the _Odes_. From  these _Odes_ it is abundantly clear that the Chinese people continued  to hold, more clearly and more firmly than ever, a deep-seated belief in  the existence of an anthropomorphic and personal God, whose one care was  the welfare of the human race:--         There is Almighty God;       Does He hate any one?    He reigns in glory.--The soul of King Wen, father of the King Wu below,  and posthumously raised by his son to royal rank, is represented as  enjoying happiness in a state beyond the grave:--         King Wen is on high,       In glory in heaven.       His comings and his goings       Are to and from the presence of God.    He is a Spirit.--Sometimes in the _Odes_ there is a hint that God, in  spite of His anthropomorphic semblance, is a spirit:--         The doings of God       Have neither sound nor smell.    Spiritual Beings.--Spirits were certainly supposed to move freely among  mortals:--         Do not say, This place is not public;       No one can see me here.       The approaches of spiritual Beings       Cannot be calculated beforehand;       But on no account should they be ignored.    The God of Battle.--In the hour of battle the God of ancient China was  as much a participator in the fight as the God of Israel in the Old  Testament:--         God is on your side!    was the cry which stimulated King Wu to break down the opposing ranks  of Shang. To King Wu's father, and others, direct communications had  previously been made from heaven, with a view to the regeneration of the  empire:--         The dynasties of Hsia and Shang       Had not satisfied God with their government;       So throughout the various States       He sought and considered       For a State on which He might confer the rule.         God said to King Wen,       I am pleased with your conspicuous virtue,       Without noise and without display,       Without heat and without change,       Without consciousness of effort,       Following the pattern of God.         God said to King Wen,       Take measures against hostile States,       Along with your brethren,       Get ready your grappling-irons,       And your engines of assault,       To attack the walls of Ts'ung.    God sends Famine.--The _Ode_ from which the following extract is taken  carries us back to the ninth century B.C., at the time of a prolonged  and disastrous drought:--         Glorious was the Milky Way,       Revolving brightly in the sky,       When the king said, Alas!       What crime have my people committed now,       That God sends down death and disorder,       And famine comes upon us again?       There is no spirit to whom I have not sacrificed;       There is no victim that I have grudged;       Our sacrificial symbols are all used up;--       How is it that I am not heard?    The Confucian Criterion.--The keystone of the Confucian philosophy, that  man is born good, will be found in the following lines:--         How mighty is God!       How clothed in majesty is God,       And how unsearchable are His judgments!       God gives birth to the people,       But their natures are not constant;       All have the same beginning,       But few have the same end.    God, however, is not held responsible for the sufferings of mankind.  King Wen, in an address to the last tyrant of the House of Shang, says  plainly,         It is not God who has caused this evil time,       But it is you who have strayed from the old paths.    The Associate of God.--Worshipped on certain occasions as the Associate  of God, and often summoned to aid in hours of distress or danger, was a  personage known as Hou Chi, said to have been the original ancestor  of the House of Chou. His story, sufficiently told in the _Odes_, is  curious for several reasons, and especially for an instance in Chinese  literature, which, in the absence of any known husband, comes near  suggesting the much-vexed question of parthenogenesis:--         She who first gave birth to our people       Was the lady Chiang Yuan.       How did she give birth to them?       She offered up a sacrifice       That she might not be childless;       Then she trod in a footprint of God's, and conceived,       The great and blessed one,       Pregnant with a new birth to be,       And brought forth and nourished       Him who was Hou Chi.         When she had fulfilled her months,       Her firstborn came forth like a lamb.       There was no bursting, no rending,       No injury, no hurt,       In order to emphasise his divinity.       Did not God give her comfort?       Had He not accepted her sacrifice,       So that thus easily she brought forth her son?         He was exposed in"]]]
