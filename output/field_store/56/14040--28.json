The  other divinities also which appear in the Vedas are personified powers  of nature,--the twin brothers Aswins (equites), or the first rays of the  sun, Ushas the maiden, or the rosy dawn, Surya, Savitri, the god of the  sun. Great significance is given in the Indian mythology to Agni, the  god of fire, who burns the sacrifice in honor of the gods, who conveys  the offerings and prayers of men to gods and their gifts to men, who  gladdens the domestic hearth, lights up the darkness of night, drives  away the evil spirits, the Ashuras and Rakshas, and purges of evil the  souls of men. Religion, still wholly patriarchal in form, and free from  hierarchical constraint and from the later dogmatic narrowness, bore in  this earlier stage of its development the character of the still free  and warlike life of a nomadic people living in the midst of a sublime  nature, where everything, the clear sky, sunshine, and boisterous storm,  mountains and rivers, disposed to worship. As yet the Indian knew no  close priestly caste. Worship consisted in prayers and offerings,  especially in the Soma-offering, which was offered as food to the gods.  No fear of future torment after death as yet embittered the enjoyment of  life and made dying fearful. Yama was the friendly guide of the souls of  heroes to the heaven of Indra or Varuna, and not yet the inexorable  prince of hell who tormented the souls of the ungodly in the kingdom of  the dead. Of later barbarous usages also, such as the widow's  sacrificing herself on the funeral pile of her departed husband, there  was as yet no trace; and in the heroic poetry, as yet not disfigured by  later Brahminical alterations and additions, the heroes Krishna and Rama  appear as types of courage and self-sacrifice, and not, as later, as  avatars, or human incarnations, of the deity.      _b. Brahminism._    When the nomadic and warlike life of the nations of India in the land of  the seven rivers, in connection with their removal to the conquered land  of the Ganges (1300 B.C.), gave place to a more ordered social  constitution, a priestly class formed itself, which began to represent  the people before the deity, and from its chief function, _Brahma_, or  prayer, took the name of _Brahmins_, i.e., the praying. This Brahma,  before whose power even the gods must yield, was gradually exalted by  the Brahmins to the highest deity, to whom, under the name of Brahma,  the old Veda divinities were subordinated. Brahma is no god of the  people, but a god of the priests; not the lord of nature, but the  abstract and impersonal _Being_, out of whom nature and her phenomena  emanate. From Brahma the priest derives his authority; and the system of  caste, by which the priesthood is raised to the first rank, its origin.  The worship of Brahma consists in doing penance and in abstinence. Yama,  once a celestial divinity, now becomes the god of the lower world, where  he who disobeys Brahma is tormented after death. Immortality consists in  returning to Brahma; but is the portion only of the perfectly godly  Brahmin, while the rest of mankind can rise to this perfect state only  after many painful new births. The Brahmin, in the exclusive possession  of religious knowledge, reads and expounds the Vedas (knowledge),  exalted to infallible scripture, and on them constructs his doctrine.    Thus the once vigorous, natural life of the Indians gave place to a  conception of the world which repressed the soul, and annihilated man's  personality. The many-sidedness of the earlier theology resolved itself  into the abstract unity of an impersonal All, and thus the glory of  nature passed by unmarked, as nought or non-existent, and lost its  charm. At the same time, the old heroic sagas were displaced by legends  of saints, and the heroic spirit of the olden epic by an asceticism  which repressed the human, and before whose power even the gods stood in  awe. With Brahminism the religion lost its original and natural  character, and became characterized by a slavish submission to a  priesthood, which abrogated the truly human.      _c. The Speculative Systems._    The doctrine of the Brahmins occasioned the rise of various theological  and philosophical systems. To these belong, first, the \"Vedanta,\" (end  of the Veda) or the dogmatic-apologetic exposition of the Veda. This  contains (1) the establishment of the authority of the Veda as holy  scripture revealed by Brahma, and also of the relation in which it  stands to tradition; (2) the proof that everything in the Veda has  reference to Brahma; (3) the ascetic system, or the discipline. To  explain contradictory statements in the older and later parts of the  Veda, Brahminical learning makes use of the subtleties of an  harmonistical method of interpretation. Second, the \"Mimansa\" (inquiry),  devoted to the solution of the problem, How can the material world  spring from Brahma, or the immaterial? According to this system, there  is only one Supreme Being, Paramatma, a name by which Brahma himself had  been already distinguished in Manu's book of law. Outside of this  highest _Being_, there is nothing real. The world of sense, or nature,  (Maya, the female side of Brahma), is mere seeming and illusion of the  senses. The human spirit is a part of Brahma, but perverted, misled by  this same illusion to the conceit that he is individual. This illusion  is done away with by a deeper insight, by means of which the dualism  vanishes from the wise man's view, and the conceit gives place to the  true knowledge that Brahma alone really exists, that nature, on the  contrary, is nought, and the human spirit nothing else than Brahma  himself. Third, the \"Sankya\" (criticism) originating with Kapila, in  which, in opposition to the \"Mimansa,\" the individual being and the real  existence of nature, in opposition to spirit, is laid down as the  starting-point, and the result reached is the doctrine of two original  forces, spirit and nature, from whose reciprocal action and reaction  upon each other the union of soul and body is to be explained. Is this  union unnatural, then the effort of the wise man should be to free  himself, through the perception that the soul is not bound to the body,  from the dominion of matter. In this system, there is no room for an  infinite being, for, if a material world exist, then must God be limited  by its existence, and therefore cease to be infinite, that is God. The  Sankya philosophy here came in conflict with the orthodox doctrine of  the Brahmins, and prepared the way for Buddhism.      _d. Buddhism._    Against Brahminism Buddhism arose as a reaction. Siddharta, son of  Suddhodana, the King of Kapilavastu, of the family of the Sakya, (about  450 B.C.) moved by the misery of his fellow-countrymen, determined to  examine into the causes of it, and, if possible, to find means of  remedying it. Initiated into the wisdom of the Brahmins, but not  satisfied with that, after years of solitary retirement and quiet  meditation, penetrated with the principles of the Sankya, he traversed  the land as pilgrim (Sakya-muni, Sramana, Gautama) and opened to the  people of India a new religious epoch. The tendency of the new doctrine  was to break up the system of caste, and free the people from the  galling yoke of the Brahminical hierarchy and dogmas. While in  Brahminism man was deprived of his individuality, and regarded only as  an effluence from Brahma, and tormented by the fear of hell, and by the  thought of a ceaseless process of countless new births awaiting him  after death, whence the necessity of the most painful penances and  chastisements, Sakya-muni began with man as an individual, and in morals  put purity, abstinence, patience, brotherly love, and repentance for  sins committed above sacrifice and bodily mortification, and opened to  his followers the prospect, after this weary life, no more to be exposed  to the ever-recurring pains of new birth, but released from all  suffering to return to Nirvana, or nothingness. While Brahminism drew a  distinction between man and man, and with hierarchical pride took no  thought of the Sudra or lower class of the people, and limited wisdom to  the priestly caste, Sakya-muni preached the equality of all men, came  forward as a preacher to the people, used the people's language, and  chose his followers out of all classes, even from among women. Both of  these opposed systems are one-sided. In Brahminism, God is all, and man,  as personal being, nothing; in Buddhism, man is recognized as an  individual, but apart from God, while in both systems, the highest  endeavor is to be delivered from, according to Brahminism a seeming,  according to Sakya-muni a really existing individuality, the source of  all human woe, and to lose one's self either in Brahma or in the  Nirvana.    Less on account of his doctrine, in which there is found neither a God  nor a personal immortality, than on account of the universal character  of his words and of his life, Sakya-muni continued in honor after his  death, as the benefactor of the people and as the Buddha, the wise,  pre-eminently; and afterwards was deified, and took his place in the  ranks of the recognized gods as their superior. Thus there arose in  Buddhism, by a departure from the doctrine of the master, a new  polytheism. This was afterwards, through the influence of the  Brahminical priestly caste, suppressed in India, but spread over other  parts of Asia, to the islands of the Indian Archipelago, and also to  China.      _e. Later modification of Brahminism in connection with the worship of  Siva and Vishnu._    While Brahminism saw itself menaced by the steadily increasing influence  of Buddhism, the former nature-religion, dispossessed by the Brahmins,  asserted its rights in the worship of Siva in the valleys of the  Himalaya Mountains, and in that of Vishnu on the banks of the Ganges.
