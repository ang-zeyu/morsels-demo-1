It is at least partly because we instinctively imitate  the mental state or the emotional attitude of the pianist or the  vocalist that we are capable of being thrilled or calmed by musical  performances, and it is largely for this reason that an audience  always insists upon _seeing_ the artist as well as hearing him. In the  same way the musicians in a chorus or orchestra must see the conductor  and catch from him by instinctive imitation his attitude toward the  music being performed. This point will be more fully discussed in a  later chapter, when we take up interpretation in conducting.    [Sidenote: CONDUCTING A COMBINATION OF SCIENCE AND ART]    In setting out to become a conductor it will be well for the young  musician to recognize at the outset that by far the larger part of the  conductor's work rests upon an art basis, and that only a  comparatively small portion of it is science; hence he must not expect  to find complete information concerning his future work in any  treatise upon the subject. It is one thing to state that there are  three primary colors, or that orange is the result of mixing red and  yellow, but it is a very different matter to give directions for  painting an effective landscape, or a true-to-life portrait. One thing  involves _science_ only, but the other is concerned primarily with  _art_, and it is always dangerous to dogmatize concerning matters  artistic. To carry the illustration one step farther, we may say that  it is comparatively easy to teach a pupil to strike certain piano keys  in such a way as to produce the correct melody, harmony, and rhythm of  a certain composition; but who would venture, even in these days of  frenzied advertising, to promise that in so many lessons he could  teach a pupil to play it as a Hofmann or a Paderewski would? Here  again we see clearly the contrast between science and art, matters of  science being always susceptible of organization into a body of  principles and laws _which will work in every case_, while art is  intangible, subtle, and ever-varying.    The application of our illustration to conducting should now be clear.  We may teach a beginner how to wield a baton according to conventional  practice, how to secure firm attacks and prompt releases, and possibly  a few other definitely established facts about conducting; but unless  our would-be leader has musical feeling within him and musicianship  back of him, it will be utterly futile for him to peruse these pages  further, or to make any other kind of an attempt to learn to conduct;  for, as stated above, only a very small part of conducting can be  codified into rules, directions, and formulae, by far the larger part  of our task being based upon each individual's own innate musical  feeling, and upon the general musical training that he has undergone.  All this may be discouraging, but on the other hand, granting a fair  degree of native musical ability, coupled with a large amount of solid  music study, any one possessing a sense of leadership can, after a  reasonable amount of intelligent practice, learn to handle a chorus or  even an orchestra in a fairly satisfactory manner. It is our purpose  in general to treat the scientific rather than the artistic side of  conducting, and we are taking for granted, therefore, that the reader  is endowed with musical feeling at least in a fair degree, and has  acquired the rudiments of musical scholarship as the result of an  extensive study of piano, organ, singing, ear-training, music history,  harmony, _et cetera_, and especially by attentive listening to a very  large amount of good music with score in hand. As a result of  combining such musical ability with a careful reading of these pages  and with a large amount of practice in actually wielding the baton, it  is hoped that the beginner will arrive at his goal somewhat earlier  than he would if he depended entirely upon what the psychologist calls  the \"trial-and-error\" method of learning.    [Sidenote: IMPORTANCE OF MUSICAL SCHOLARSHIP]    The musical amateur who is ambitious to conduct should therefore study  music in all its phases, and if in doubt as to his talent, he should  submit to a vocational test in order to determine whether his native  musical endowment is sufficient to make it worth his while to study  the art seriously. If the result of the test is encouraging, showing a  good ear, a strong rhythmic reaction, and a considerable amount of  what might be termed native musical taste, let him practise his piano  energetically and intelligently, and especially let him learn to read  three and four voices on separate staffs (as in a vocal score) in  order to prepare himself for future reading of full scores. Let him  study harmony, counterpoint, form, and, if possible, composition and  orchestration. Let him work indefatigably at ear-training, and  particularly at harmonic ear training, so that notes and tones may  become closely associated in his mind, the printed page then giving  him auditory rather than merely visual imagery; in other words, let  him school himself to make the printed page convey to his mind the  actual sounds of the music. Let him study the history of music, not  only as a record of the work of individual composers, but as an  account of what has transpired in the various periods or epochs of  musical art, so that he may become intelligent concerning the ideals,  the styles, and the forms of these various periods. And finally, let  him hear all the good music he possibly can, listening to it from the  threefold standpoint of sense, emotion, and intellect, and noting  particularly those matters connected with expression and  interpretation in these renditions. In as many cases as possible let  him study the scores of the compositions beforehand, comparing then  his own ideas of interpretation with those of the performer or  conductor, and formulating reasons for any differences of opinion that  may become manifest.    Let the young musician also form the habit of reading widely, not  only along all musical lines (history, biography, theory, esthetics,  _et cetera_), but upon a wide variety of topics, such as painting and  the other arts, history, literature, sociology, pedagogy, _et cetera_.  As the result of such study and such reading, a type of musical  scholarship will be attained which will give the conductor an  authority in his interpretations and criticisms that cannot possibly  be achieved in any other way. Let us hasten to admit at once that the  acquiring of this sort of scholarship will take a long time, and that  it cannot all be done before beginning to conduct. But in the course  of several years of broad and intelligent study a beginning at least  can be made, and later on, as the result of continuous growth while at  work, a fine, solid, comprehensive scholarship may finally eventuate.          CHAPTER II    PERSONAL TRAITS NECESSARY IN CONDUCTING      [Sidenote: IMPORTANCE OF PERSONALITY]    In the introductory chapter it was noted that the conductor must build  upon a foundation of musical scholarship if he is to be really  successful; that he must possess musical feeling; and that he must go  through extensive musical training, if he is to conduct with taste and  authority. But in addition to these purely _musical_ requirements,  experience and observation have demonstrated that the would-be  conductor must be possessed of certain definitely established personal  characteristics, and that many a musician who has been amply able to  pass muster from a musical standpoint, has failed as a conductor  because he lacked these other traits.    It is not my purpose to give at this point an exhaustive list of  qualities that must form the personal equipment of the conductor. In  general it will be sufficient to state that he must possess in a fair  degree those personal traits that are advantageous in any profession.  But of these desirable qualities three or four seem to be so  indispensable that it has been thought best to devote a brief chapter  to a discussion of them. These qualities are:         1. A sense of humor.       2. A creative imagination.       3. A sense of leadership combined with organizing ability.    [Sidenote: A SENSE OF HUMOR]    The first of these traits, a sense of humor, may perhaps upon first  thought seem a peculiar quality to include in a category of virtues  for the professional man of any type, and especially for the musician.  But upon reflection it will be admitted that the ability to see  things in a humorous light (which very frequently means merely seeing  them in true perspective) has helped many a man to avoid wasting  nervous energy upon insignificant occurrences, while the lack of this  ability has caused more trouble among all sorts of people (and  particularly, it seems to me, among musicians) than any other single  thing.    [Sidenote: ILLUSTRATIONS OF HUMOR IN THE REHEARSAL]    Some player or singer is either over-arduous or a bit sleepy during  the first stages of rehearsing a new composition, and makes a wrong  entrance, perhaps during a pause just before the climacteric point.  The occurrence is really funny and the other performers are inclined  to smile or snicker, but our serious conductor quells the outbreak  with a scowl. The humorous leader, on the other hand, sees the  occurrence as the performers do, joins in the laugh that is raised at  the expense of the offender, and the rehearsal goes on with renewed  spirit.    An instrumental performer makes a bad tone, and the conductor laughs  at him, saying it sounds like a wolf"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22396"],[0,"King Arthur's Knights (#2)"],[1,"from thy kin, who shall drive out  the loathsome pagan and shall conquer far and wide, and his fame shall  go into all lands and for all time.'    'I thank thee, Merlin, for thy comfort,' sighed the wearied king. 'I  have feared me these last years that the pagan will at the last drive  my people into the western sea, and that the name of Christ shall die  out of this fair land, and the foul pagan possess it. But thy words  give me great heart.'    'Nay, sir,' said Merlin, 'take comfort. Great power will come to this  people in a near time, and they shall conquer all their enemies.'    Anon the king slept, and lay thus for three further days, neither  speaking nor moving. Many great lords and barons came craving to speak  with Merlin, asking if the king were not better. But, looking into  their crafty eyes, and seeing there the pride and ambitions of their  hearts, Merlin knew that they wished the king were already dead; for  all thought that King Uther had no son to take the kingdom after him,  and each great baron, strong in men, plotted to win the overlordship  when the king should be gone.    'If he dieth and sayeth not which he shall name to succeed him,' some  asked, 'say, Merlin, what's to be done?'    'I shall tell you,' said Merlin. 'Come ye all into this chamber  to-morrow's morn, and, if God so wills, I will make the king speak.'    Next morn, therefore, came all the great barons and lords into the high  hall of the palace, and many were the proud and haughty glances passing  among them. There was King Lot of Orkney, small and slim, with his dark  narrow face and crafty eyes under pent eyebrows; King Uriens of Reged,  tall and well-seeming, with grim eyes war-wise, fresh from the long  harrying of the fleeing pagans; King Mark of Tintagel, burly of form,  crafty and mean of look; King Nentres of Garlot, ruddy of face,  blusterous of manner, who tried to hide cunning under a guise of  honesty; and many others, as Duke Cambenet of Loidis, King Brandegoris  of Stranggore, King Morkant of Strathclyde, King Clariance of  Northumberland, King Kador of Cornwall, and King Idres of Silura.    Now, when all these were assembled about the bed of Uther, Merlin went  to the side of the sleeping king, and looked long and earnestly upon  his closed eyes. Anon he passed his hands above the face of the king,  and Uther instantly awoke, and looked about him as if startled.    'Lord,' said Merlin, 'God's hand is drawing you to Him, and these your  lords desire you to name your successor ere you pass from life. Is it  not your desire that your son Arthur shall take the kingdom after you,  with your blessing?'    Those who craned towards the bed started and looked darkly at Merlin  and then at each other; for none had heard of the son whom the wizard  named Arthur. Then in the deep silence the dying king raised his hand  in the sign of blessing, and in a hollow whisper said:    'Such is my desire. With God's blessing I wish my son Arthur to take  this kingdom after me, and all that love me must follow him.'    His eyes closed, a shiver passed down the tall frame as it lay beneath  the clothes, and with a sigh the soul of Uther sped.    In a few days the king was buried in all solemnity with the dead of his  kindred in the Roman temple that had been made a church, where now  stands St. Paul's. Thereafter men waited and wondered, for the land was  without a king, and none knew who was rightfully heir to the throne.    As the days went by, men gathered in groups in the market-place of  London, whispering the rumours that mysteriously began to fly from  mouth to mouth,--how King Lot of Orkney and Lothian was gathering his  knights and men-at-arms; and King Uriens and Duke Cambenet of Loidis  had got together a great host, although the remnant of the pagans had  fled the country. The faces of the citizens went gloomy as they thought  of the griefs of civil war, of the terrors of the sack of cities, the  ruin of homes, the death of dear ones, and the loss of riches.  Nevertheless, some were already wagering which of the great lords would  conquer the others, and take to himself the crown of Britain and the  title of Pendragon.    As it neared the feast of Christmas, men heard that the Archbishop of  London, who was then chief ruler of the Church, had sent his letters to  each and all the great nobles, bidding them come to a great council to  be holden at the church of St. Paul at Christmas.    When men heard that this was done by the advice of Merlin, faces  lightened and looked more joyful.    'Now shall things go right,' said they, 'for the old, old Merlin hath  the deepest wisdom of all the earth.'    On Christmas Eve the city throbbed with the clank of arms and the tramp  of the great retinues of princes, kings and powerful lords who had come  at the archbishop's summons, and by day and night the narrow ways were  crowded with armed men. Long ere the dawn of Christmas Day, the lords  and the common people betook themselves along the wide road which led  across to the church, which then stood in a wide space amid fields, and  all knelt therein to mass.    While it was yet dark a great strange cry rang out in the churchyard.  Some ran forth, and there by the wall behind the high altar they saw a  vast stone, four-square, that had not been there before, and in the  middle thereof was stuck a great wedge of steel, and sticking therefrom  by the point was a rich sword. On the blade were written words in  Latin, which a clerk read forth, which said, 'Whoso pulleth this sword  out of this stone and wedge of steel is rightwise born King of all  Britain.'    The clerk ran into the church and told the archbishop, and men were all  amazed and would have gone instantly to see this marvel, but the  archbishop bade them stay.    'Finish your prayers to God,' he said, 'for no man may touch this  strange thing till high mass be done.'    When mass was finished, all poured forth from the church and thronged  about the stone, and marvelled at the words on the sword. First King  Lot, with a light laugh, took hold of the handle and essayed to pull  out the point of the sword, but he could not, and his face went hot and  angry. Then King Nentres of Garlot took his place with a jest, but  though he heaved at the sword with all his burly strength, till it  seemed like to snap, he could not move it, and so let go at last with  an angry oath. All the others essayed in like manner, but by none was  it moved a jot, and all stood about discomfited, looking with black  looks at one another and the stone.    'He that is rightwise born ruler of Britain is not here,' said the  archbishop at length, 'but doubt not he shall come in God's good time.  Meanwhile, let a tent be raised over the stone, and do ye lords appoint  ten of your number to watch over it, and we will essay the sword again  after New Year's Day.'    So that the kings and lords should be kept together, the archbishop  appointed a great tournament to be held on New Year's Day on the waste  land north of the city, which men now call Smithfield.    Now when the day was come, a certain lord, Sir Ector de Morven, who had  great lands about the isle of Thorney, rode towards the jousts with his  son, Sir Kay, and young Arthur, who was Sir Kay's foster-brother. When  they had got nearly to the place, suddenly Sir Kay bethought him that  he had left his sword at home.    'Do you ride back, young Arthur,' he said, 'and fetch me my sword, for  if I do not have it I may not fight.'    Willingly Arthur turned his horse and rode back swiftly. But when he  had arrived at the house, he found it shut up and none was within, for  all had gone to the jousts. Then was he a little wroth, and rode back  wondering how he should obtain a sword for his foster-brother.    Suddenly, as he saw the tower of St. Paul's church through the trees,  he bethought him of the sword in the stone, about which many men had  spoken in his hearing.    'I will ride thither,' said he, 'and see if I may get that sword for my  brother, for he shall not be without a sword this day.'    When he came to the churchyard, he tied his horse to the stile, and  went through the grave-mounds to the tent wherein was the sword. He  found the place unwatched, and the flashing sword was sticking by the  point in the stone.    Lightly he grasped the handle of the sword with one hand, and it came  forth straightway!    Then, glad that his brother should not be without a sword, he swiftly  gat upon his horse and rode on, and delivered the sword to Sir Kay, and  thought no more of aught but the splendid knights and richly garbed  lords that were at the jousts.    But Sir Kay looked at the sword, and the writing, and knew it was the  sword of the stone, and marvelled how young Arthur had possessed  himself thereof; and being of a covetous and sour mind he thought how  he might make advantage for himself. He went to his father, Sir Ector,  and said:    'Lo, father, this is the sword of the stone, and surely am I rightful  king.'    Sir Ector knew the sword and marvelled, but his look was stern as he  gazed into the crafty eyes of his son.    'Come ye with me,' he said, and all three rode to the church, and alit  from their horses and went in.    Sir Ector strode up the aisle to the altar, and turning to his son,  said sternly:    'Now, swear on God's book and the holy relics how thou didst get this  sword.'    Sir Kay's heart went weak, and he stammered out the truth.    'How gat you this sword?' asked Sir Ector of Arthur.    'Sir, I will tell you,' said Arthur, and so told him all as it had  happened.    Sir Ector marvelled what this should mean; for Arthur had been given to  him to nourish and rear as a week-old child by Merlin, but the wizard  had only told him that the babe was a son of a dead lady, whose lord  had been slain by the pagans.    Then Sir Ector went to the stone and bade Arthur put back the sword  into the wedge of steel, which"]]]
