His face was covered with a white cloth, and under       his head there lay a large, thick book, every leaf of which       was a whole sheet of gray paper, and, between each, lay       withered flowers, deposited and forgotten,--a whole       herbarium, gathered in different places. He himself had       requested that it should be laid in the grave with him. A       chapter of his life was blended with every flower! 'Who is       that dead man?' we asked, and the answer was, 'The old       student from Upsala. They say he was once very clever; he       knew the learned languages, could sing and write verses too;       but then there was something that went wrong, and so he gave       both his thoughts and himself up to drinking spirits, and,       as his health suffered by it, he came out here into the       country, where they paid for his board and lodging. He was       as gentle as a child when the dark humor did not come over       him, for then he was strong, and ran about in the forest       like a hunted deer; but when we got him home, we persuaded       him to look into the book with the dry plants. Then he would       sit the whole day, and look at one plant, and then at       another, and many a time the tears ran down his cheeks. God       knows what he then thought! But he begged that he might have       the book with him in his coffin; and now it lies there, and       the lid will soon be fastened down, and then he will take       his peaceful rest in the grave!'         \"They raised the winding sheet. There was peace in the face       of the dead. A sunbeam fell on it; a swallow, in its       arrow-flight, darted into the new-made arbor, and in its       flight circled twittering over the dead man's head.         \"How strange it is!--we all assuredly know it--to take out       old letters from the days of one's youth, and read them: a       whole life, as it were, then rises up, with all its hopes       and all its troubles. How many of those with whom we, in       their time, lived so devotedly, are now even as the dead to       us, and yet they still live! But we have not thought of them       for many years--them whom we once thought we should always       cling to, and share our mutual joys and sorrows with!         \"The withered oak-leaf in the book here, is a memorial of       the friend--the friend of his school days--the friend for       life. He fixed this leaf on the student's cap, in the       greenwood, when the vow of friendship was concluded for the       whole life. Where does he now live? The leaf is preserved;       friendship forgotten. Here is a foreign conservatory plant,       too fine for the gardens of the North. It looks as if there       still were fragrance in it. _She_ gave it to him--she, the       lady of that noble garden!         \"Here is the marsh-lotus, which, he himself has plucked and       watered with salt tears--the marsh-lotus from the fresh       waters! And here is a nettle; what do its leaves say! What       did he think on plucking it?--on preserving it? Here are       lilies of the valley, from the woodland solitudes; here are       honeysuckles from the village ale-house flower-pot; and here       the bare, sharp blade of grass. The flowering lilac bends       its fresh, fragrant clusters over the dead man's head; the       swallow again flies past--'qui-vit! qui-vit!' Now the men       come with nails and hammer; the lid is placed over the       corpse, whose head rests on the 'Mute       Book'--preserved--forgotten!\"    The book, to those who are not repelled by a certain quaintness of  manner from the enjoyment of a work of true genius, will form a  permanent and delightful addition to those pictures of many lands  which the enterprise and accomplishment of modern travellers is  creating for the delight of those whose range of locomotion is bounded  by the limits of their own country, or by the four walls of a sick  chamber.    Andersen has grown old in years, and with age he has increase of art,  but he was never younger in spirit, and his genius never blossomed  with more freshness and beauty.          VERSES    WRITTEN FOR THE INTERNATIONAL MAGAZINE,    BY R. H. STODDARD.          My desk is heaped with niceties        From tropic lands divine,      But this is braver far than all--        A flask of Chian wine!        Brim up my golden drinking-cup,        And reach a dish of fruit,      And then unlock my cabinet,        And hand me out my lute;        For when these luxuries have fed        And filled my brain with light,      I must compose a nuptial song,        To suit my bridal night!          A CHAPTER OF PARODIES.      Parodies have been much in vogue in almost every age; among the  Greeks, Latins, Germans, French, and English, it has been among the  commonest of literary pleasantries to turn verses into ridicule by  applying them to a purpose never dreamed of by their authors, or to  burlesque serious pieces by affecting to observe the same rhymes,  words, and cadences. The wicked arts of Charles the Second's time thus  made fun of the hymns of the Roundheads, and pious people have since  turned the tables by adapting to good uses the profane airs and  sensual songs of the opera house. Of the class of puns, parodies have  in the scale of art a much higher rank, and occasionally they furnish  specimens of genuine poetry. Among the best we have ever seen are a  considerable number attributed to Miss Phebe Carey, of Ohio; they are  rich in quaint and natural humor, and as a London critic describes  them, \"wonderfully American.\" In its way, we have seen nothing better  than this reflex of Bayard Taylor's poem of \"Manuela.\"      MARTHA HOPKINS.    A BALLAD OF INDIANA.        From the kitchen, Martha Hopkins, as she stood there making pies,      Southward looks along the turnpike, with her hand above her eyes;      Where along the distant hill-side, her yearling heifer feeds,      And a little grass is growing in a mighty sight of weeds.        All the air is full of noises, for there isn't any school,      And boys, with turned-up pantaloons, are wading in the pool;      Blithely frisk, unnumbered chickens cackling for they cannot laugh,      Where the airy summits brighten, nimbly leaps the little calf.        Gentle eyes of Martha Hopkins! tell me wherefore do ye gaze      On the ground that's being furrowed for the planting of the maize?      Tell me wherefore down the valley, ye have traced the turnpike's way,      Far beyond the cattle pasture, and the brick-yard with its clay?        Ah! the dog-wood tree may blossom, and the door-yard grass may shine,      With the tears of amber dropping from the washing on the line;      And the morning's breath of balsam, lightly brush her freckled cheek,--      Little recketh Martha Hopkins of the tales of spring they speak.        When the summer's burning solstice on the scanty harvest glowed,      She had watched a man on horseback riding down the turnpike road;      Many times she saw him turning, looking backward quite forlorn,      Till amid her tears she lost him, in the shadow of the barn.        Ere supper-time was over, he had passed the kiln of brick,      Crossed the rushing Yellow River and had forded quite a creek,      And his flat-boat load was taken, at the time for pork and beans,      With the traders of the Wabash, to the wharf at New Orleans.        Therefore watches Martha Hopkins--holding in her hands the pans,      When the sound of distant footsteps seems exactly like a man's;      Not a wind the stove-pipe rattles, nor a door behind her jars,      But she seems to hear the rattle of his letting down the bars.        Often sees she men on horseback, coming down the turnpike rough,      But they come not as John Jackson, she can see it well enough;      Well she knows the sober trotting of the sorrel horse he keeps,      As he jogs along at leisure with his head down like a sheep's.        She would know him 'mid a thousand, by his home-made coat and vest;      By his socks, which were blue woollen, such as farmers wear out west;      By the color of his trousers, and his saddle, which was spread      By a blanket which was taken for that purpose from the bed.        None like he the yoke of hickory, on the unbroke ox can throw,      None amid his father's corn-fields use like him the spade and hoe;      And at all the apple-cuttings, few indeed the men are seen,      That can dance with him the polka, touch with him the violin.        He has said to Martha Hopkins, and she thinks she hears him now,      For she knows as well as can be, that he meant to keep his vow,      When the buck-eye tree has blossomed, and your uncle plants his corn,      Shall the bells of Indiana usher in the wedding morn.        He has pictured his relations, each in Sunday hat and gown,      And he thinks he'll get a carriage, and they'll spend a day in town;      That their love will newly kindle, and what comfort it will give,      To sit down to the first breakfast, in the cabin where they'll live.        Tender eyes of Martha Hopkins! what has got you in such scrape,      'Tis a tear that falls to glitter on the ruffle of her cape,      Ah! the eye of love may brighten, to be certain what it sees,      One man looks much like another, when half hidden by the trees.        But her eager eyes rekindle, she forgets the pies and bread,      As she sees a man on horseback, round the corner of the shed.      Now tie on another apron, get the comb and smooth your hair,      'Tis the sorrel horse that gallops, 'tis John Jackson's self that's there!    Here is one scarcely less happy upon Mr. Willis's \"Better Moments:\"      WORSER MOMENTS.        That fellow's voice! how often steals        Its cadence o'er my lonely days!      Like something sent on wagon wheels,        Or packed in an unconscious chaise.

This, however, has been to some  extent already overcome, both on the continent of India and in Ceylon,  as is evident from the facts of the establishment of native presses in  Hindostan, and of the success of a missionary newspaper in Ceylon for  the last seven years, which has now more than seven hundred  subscribers, of whom five-sixths are Tamils. The Church Missionary  Society have also a press amongst the Tamils; the Wesleyans  established theirs in the Singhalese districts, and the Baptists have  one at work in Kandy. One of the greatest, among the many triumphs of  the missionaries in Ceylon, has been in the education of girls. The  position of woman in that island, as in most parts of the East, was  one of inferiority and toil. She was not permitted to sit at table  with the males, or even to eat in the presence of her husband. Her  education was so wholly neglected that, amongst the Tamils, no woman  knew her alphabet, except such as rather gave the accomplishment a bad  name--the dancing girls and prostitutes attached to the temples, who  learned to read and write that they might copy songs and the legends  of their gods. It was, however, plain that no extensive good would be  effected without the education of women. The male converts could not  get suitable wives, and the children would be in the hands of  idolaters. In addition to their natural influence in a family, the  women of the Tamils, where this new attempt in education was first  made, had rights of property, which, notwithstanding the inferiority  of their social position, gave them peculiar influence.         \"'It is, we are told, a paramount object of ambition with       Tamil parents to secure an eligible alliance for their       daughters by the assignment of extravagant marriage       portions. These consist either of land, or of money secured       upon land; and as the law of Ceylon recognizes the absolute       control of the lady over the property thus conveyed to her       sole and separate use, the prevalence of the practice has,       by degrees, thrown an extraordinary extent of the landed       property of the country into the hands of the females, and       invested them with a corresponding proportion of authority       in its management.'\"    Impressed with the urgency of the object, the missionaries attempted  the establishment of female schools, and especially of boarding  schools, where Hindoo girls might be trained, and separated from evil  influences until they could be settled with the approbation of the  guardians. They had at first great difficulty in getting pupils, and  only enticed them by presents of dress, or some such cogent bribe, or  by engagements to give fortunes of five or six pounds to all who  remained in their institutions until suitably married. Even with these  allurements their early efforts promised no success. Parents were  inveighed against for allowing their daughters to be instructed, and  so strong was native prejudice that the children, when learning to  read, blushed with shame. These and other obstacles have been  surmounted, and, as the following extract shows, the missionaries have  no longer to allure, but must select their scholars. The Americans  made the first experiment at Oodooville, a few miles distant from the  fort of Jaffna:--         \"'The hamlet of Oodooville is in the centre of a tract of       very rich land, and the buildings occupied by the Americans       were originally erected by the Portuguese for a Roman       Catholic church, and the residence of a friar of the order       of St. Francis. It is a beautiful spot, embowered in trees,       and all its grounds and gardens are kept in becoming order,       with the nicest care and attention.         \"'The institution opened in 1824, with about thirty pupils,       between the ages of five and eleven; and this, after eight       years of previous exertion and entreaty, was the utmost       number of female scholars who could be prevailed on to       attend from the whole extent of the province. This       difficulty has been long since overcome. Instead of       solicitations and promises, to allure scholars, the       missionaries have long since been obliged to limit their       admissions to one hundred, the utmost that their buildings       can accommodate; and now, so eager are the natives to secure       education for their daughters, that a short time before my       visit, on the occasion of filling up some vacancies, upwards       of sixty candidates were in anxious attendance, of whom only       seventeen could be selected, there being room for no more.       The earliest inmates of the institution were of low castes       and poor; whereas the pupils and candidates now are, many of       them, of most respectable families, and the daughters of       persons of property and influence in the district.         \"'The course of instruction is in all particulars adapted to       suit the social circumstances of the community; along with a       thorough knowledge of the Scriptures and the principles of       the Christian religion, it embraces all the ordinary       branches of female education, which are communicated both in       Tamil and in English; and combined with this intellectual       culture, the girls are carefully trained, conformably to the       usages of their country, in all the discipline and       acquirements essential to economy and domestic enjoyments at       home. Of two hundred and fifty females who have been thus       brought up at Oodooville, more than half have been since       married to Christians, and are now communicating to their       children the same training and advantages of which they have       so strongly felt the benefit themselves.'\"    \"The consequence of these proceedings is, that the number of  households is fast increasing, where the mother, trained in the habits  of civilized life, and instructed in the principles of Christianity,  is anxious to give to her children the like advantages.\"          A PAPER OF ... TOBACCO.      We find a lively passage on tobacco in the pleasant new book by  Alphonse Karr. It must be borne in mind that, in France, tobacco is a  monopoly--and a very productive one--in the hands of government:--         \"There is a family of poisonous plants, amongst which we may       notice the henbane, the datura stramonium, and the tobacco       plant. The tobacco plant is perhaps a little less poisonous       than the datura, but it is more so than the henbane, which       is a violent poison. Here is a tobacco plant--as fine a       plant as you can wish to see. It grows to the height of six       feet; and from the centre of a tuft of leaves, of a       beautiful green, shoot out elegant and graceful clusters of       pink flowers.         \"For a long while the tobacco plant grew unknown and       solitary in the wilds of America. The savage to whom we had       given brandy gave us in exchange tobacco, with the smoke of       which they used to intoxicate themselves on grand occasions.       The intercourse between the two worlds began by this amiable       interchange of poisons.         \"Those who first thought of putting tobacco dust up their       noses were first laughed at, and then persecuted more or       less. James I., of England, wrote against snuff-takers a       book entitled _Misocapnos_. Some years later, Pope Urban       VIII. excommunicated all persons who took snuff in churches.       The Empress Elizabeth thought it necessary to add something       to the penalty of excommunication pronounced against those       who used the black dust during divine service, and       authorised the beadles to confiscate the snuff-boxes to       their own use. Amurath IV. forbade the use of snuff under       pain of having the nose cut of.         \"No useful plant could have withstood such attacks. If       before this invention a man had been found to say, Let us       seek the means of filling the coffers of the state by a       voluntary tax; let us set about selling something which       every body will like to do without. In America there is a       plant essentially poisonous; if from its leaves you extract       an empyreumatic oil, a single drop of it will cause an       animal to die in horrible convulsions. Suppose we offer this       plant for sale chopped up or reduced to a powder. We will       sell it very dear, and tell people to stuff the powder up       their noses.         \"'That is to say, I suppose, you will force them to do so by       law?'         \"'Not a bit of it. I spoke of a voluntary tax. As to the       portion we chop up, we will tell them to inhale it, and       swallow a little of the smoke from it besides.'         \"'But it will kill them.'         \"'No; they will become rather pale, perhaps feel giddy, spit       blood, and suffer from colics, or have pains in the       chest--that's all. Besides, you know, although it has been       often said that habit is second nature, people are not yet       aware how completely man resembles the knife, of which the       blade first and then the handle had been changed two or       three times. In man there is no nature left--nothing but       habit remains. People will become like Mithridates, who had       learnt to live on poisons.         \"'The first time that a man will smoke he will feel       sickness, nausea, giddiness, and colics; but that will go       off by degrees, and in time he will get so accustomed to it,       that he will only feel such symptoms now and then--when he       smokes tobacco that is bad, or too strong--or when he is not       well, and in five or six other cases. Those who take it in       powder will sneeze, have a disagreeable smell, lose the       sense of smelling, and establish in their nose a sort of       perpetual blister.'         \"'Then, I suppose it smells very nice.'         \"'Quite the reverse.
