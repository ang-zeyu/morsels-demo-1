[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25502"],[0,"Hero-Myths & Legends of the British Race (#12)"],[1,"\" has  preserved for us an alternative legend of the cause of Constantine's  conversion, which forms a good illustration of the virtue of pity in  the \"Confessio Amantis.\" Whence this later legend sprang we have no  knowledge, for nothing in the known history of Constantine warrants  our regarding him as a disciple of mercy, but its existence shows that  the mediaeval mind was busied with his personality. Another most  interesting proof of his importance to Britain is given in the  following legend of \"The Dream of Maxen Wledig,\" preserved in the  \"Mabinogion.\" This belongs to the Welsh patriotic legends, and tends  to glorify the marriage of the British Princess Helena with the Roman  emperor, by representing it as preordained by Fate. The fact that the  hero of the Welsh saga is the Emperor Maxentius instead of  Constantius detracts little from the interest of the legend, which is  only one instance of the well-known theme of the lover led by dream,  or vision, or magic glass to the home and heart of the beloved.      The Emperor Maxen Wledig    The Emperor Maxen Wledig was the most powerful occupant of the throne  of the Caesars who had ever ruled Europe from the City of the Seven  Hills. He was the most handsome man in his dominions, tall and strong  and skilled in all manly exercises; withal he was gracious and  friendly to all his vassals and tributary kings, so that he was  universally beloved. One day he announced his wish to go hunting, and  was accompanied on his expedition down the Tiber valley by thirty-two  vassal kings, with whom he enjoyed the sport heartily. At noon the  heat was intense, they were far from Rome, and all were weary. The  emperor proposed a halt, and they dismounted to take rest. Maxen lay  down to sleep with his head on a shield, and soldiers and attendants  stood around making a shelter for him from the sun's rays by a roof of  shields hung on their spears. Thus he fell into a sleep so deep that  none dared to awake him. Hours passed by, and still he slumbered, and  still his whole retinue waited impatiently for his awakening. At  length, when the evening shadows began to lie long and black on the  ground, their impatience found vent in little restless movements of  hounds chafing in their leashes, of spears clashing, of shields  dropping from the weariness of their holders, and horses neighing and  prancing; and then Maxen Wledig awoke suddenly with a start. \"Ah, why  did you arouse me?\" he asked sadly. \"Lord, your dinner hour is long  past--did you not know?\" they said. He shook his head mournfully, but  said no word, and, mounting his horse, turned it and rode in unbroken  silence back to Rome, with his head sunk on his breast. Behind him  rode in dismay his retinue of kings and tributaries, who knew nothing  of the cause of his sorrowful mood.      The Emperor's Malady    From that day the emperor was changed, changed utterly. He rode no  more, he hunted no more, he paid no heed to the business of the  empire, but remained in seclusion in his own apartments and slept. The  court banquets continued without him, music and song he refused to  hear, and though in his sleep he smiled and was happy, when he awoke  his melancholy could not be cheered or his gloom lightened. When this  condition of things had continued for more than a week it was  determined that the emperor must be aroused from this dreadful state  of apathy, and his groom of the chamber, a noble Roman of very high  rank--indeed, a king, under the emperor--resolved to make the  endeavour.    \"My lord,\" said he, \"I have evil tidings for you. The people of Rome  are beginning to murmur against you, because of the change that has  come over you. They say that you are bewitched, that they can get no  answers or decisions from you, and all the affairs of the empire go to  wrack and ruin while you sleep and take no heed. You have ceased to be  their emperor, they say, and they will cease to be loyal to you.\"      The Dream of the Emperor    Then Maxen Wledig roused himself and said to the noble: \"Call hither  my wisest senators and councillors, and I will explain the cause of my  melancholy, and perhaps they will be able to give me relief.\"  Accordingly the senators came together, and the emperor ascended his  throne, looking so mournful that the whole Senate grieved for him, and  feared lest death should speedily overtake him. He began to address  them thus:    \"Senators and Sages of Rome, I have heard that my people murmur  against me, and will rebel if I do not arouse myself. A terrible fate  has fallen upon me, and I see no way of escape from my misery, unless  ye can find one. It is now more than a week since I went hunting with  my court, and when I was wearied I dismounted and slept. In my sleep I  dreamt, and a vision cast its spell upon me, so that I feel no  happiness unless I am sleeping, and seem to live only in my dreams. I  thought I was hunting along the Tiber valley, lost my courtiers, and  rode to the head of the valley alone. There the river flowed forth  from a great mountain, which looked to me the highest in the world;  but I ascended it, and found beyond fair and fertile plains, far  vaster than any in our Italy, with mighty rivers flowing through the  lovely country to the sea. I followed the course of the greatest  river, and reached its mouth, where a noble port stood on the shores  of a sea unknown to me. In the harbour lay a fleet of well-appointed  ships, and one of these was most beautifully adorned, its planks  covered with gold or silver, and its sails of silk. As a gangway of  carved ivory led to the deck, I crossed it and entered the vessel,  which immediately sailed out of the harbour into the ocean. The voyage  was not of long duration, for we soon came to land in a wondrously  beautiful island, with scenery of varied loveliness. This island I  traversed, led by some secret guidance, till I reached its farthest  shore, broken by cliffs and precipices and mountain ranges, while  between the mountains and the sea I saw a fair and fruitful land  traversed by a silvery, winding river, with a castle at its mouth. My  longing drew me to the castle, and when I came to the gate I entered,  for the dwelling stood open to every man, and such a hall as was  therein I have never seen for splendour, even in Imperial Rome. The  walls were covered with gold, set with precious gems, the seats were  of gold and the tables of silver, and two fair youths, whom I saw  playing chess, used pieces of gold on a board of silver. Their attire  was of black satin embroidered with gold, and golden circlets were on  their brows. I gazed at the youths for a moment, and next became aware  of an aged man sitting near them. His carved ivory seat was adorned  with golden eagles, the token of Imperial Rome; his ornaments on arms  and hands and neck were of bright gold, and he was carving fresh  chessmen from a rod of solid gold. Beside him sat, on a golden chair,  a maiden (the loveliest in the whole world she seemed, and still  seems, to me). White was her inner dress under a golden overdress, her  crown of gold adorned with rubies and pearls, and a golden girdle  encircled her slender waist. The beauty of her face won my love in  that moment, and I knelt and said: 'Hail, Empress of Rome!' but as she  bent forward from her seat to greet me I awoke. Now I have no peace  and no joy except in sleep, for in dreams I always see my lady, and in  dreams we love each other and are happy; therefore in dreams will I  live, unless ye can find some way to satisfy my longing while I wake.\"    [Illustration: The dream of the Emperor]      The Quest for the Maiden    The senators were at first greatly amazed, and then one of them said:  \"My lord, will you not send out messengers to seek throughout all your  lands for the maiden in the castle? Let each group of messengers  search for one year, and return at the end of the year with  tidings. So shall you live in good hope of success from year to year.\"  The messengers were sent out accordingly, with wands in their hands  and a sleeve tied on each cap, in token of peace and of an embassy;  but though they searched with all diligence, after three years three  separate embassies had brought back no news of the mysterious land and  the beauteous maiden.    Then the groom of the chamber said to Maxen Wledig: \"My lord, will you  not go forth to hunt, as on the day when you dreamt this enthralling  dream?\" To this the emperor agreed, and rode to the place in the  valley where he had slept. \"Here,\" he said, \"my dream began, and I  seemed to follow the river to its source.\" Then the groom of the  chamber said: \"Will you not send messengers to the river's source, my  lord, and bid them follow the track of your dream?\" Accordingly  thirteen messengers were sent, who followed the river up until it  issued from the highest mountain they had ever seen. \"Behold our  emperor's dream!\" they exclaimed, and they ascended the mountain, and  descended the other side into a most beautiful and fertile plain, as  Maxen Wledig had seen in his dream. Following the greatest river of  all (probably the Rhine), the ambassadors reached the great seaport on  the North Sea, and found the fleet waiting with one vessel larger than  all the others; and they entered the ship and were carried to the fair  island of Britain. Here they journeyed westward, and came to the  mountainous land of Snowdon, whence they could see the sacred isle of  Mona (Anglesey) and the fertile land of Arvon lying between the  mountains and the sea. \"This,\" said the messengers, \"is the land of  our master's dream, and in yon fair castle we shall find the maiden  whom our emperor loves.\"      The Finding of the Maiden    So they went through the lovely land of Arvon to the castle of  Caernarvon, and in that lordly fortress was the great hall, with the  two youths playing chess, the venerable man carving chessmen, and the  maiden in her chair"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25550"],[0,"The Defiant Agents (#12)"],[1,"whose nature they had never been able to deduce. Were they  the degenerate dregs of a once intelligent species? Or were they  animals, akin to man, but still animals?    The ape-things had controlled the night of the desert world. And they  had been met again--also in the dark--in the ruins of the city which had  been the final goal of the ship's taped voyage. So they were a part of  the vanished civilization. And Travis' own vague surmise concerning  Topaz was proven correct. This had not been an empty world for the  long-gone space people. This planet had a purpose and a use, or else  this beast would not have been here.    \"Devil!\" Kaydessa made a face of disgust.    \"You know it?\" Tsoay asked Travis. \"What is it?\"    \"That I do not know, but it is a thing left over from the star people's  time. And I have seen it on two other of their worlds.\"    \"A man?\" Tsoay surveyed the body critically. \"It wears no clothes, has  no weapons, but it walks erect. It looks like an ape, a very big ape. It  is not a good thing, I think.\"    \"If it runs with a pack--as they do elsewhere--this could be a very bad  thing.\" Travis, remembering how these creatures had attacked in force on  the other worlds, looked about him apprehensively. Even with the coyotes  on guard, they could not stand up to such a pack closing in through the  dark. They had better hole up in some defendable place and wait out the  rest of the night.    Naginlta brought them to a cliff overhang where they could set their  backs to the hard rock of the mountain, face outward to a space they  could cover with arrow flight if the need arose. And the coyotes, lying  before them with their noses resting on paws, would, Travis knew, alert  them long before the enemy could close in.    They huddled against the rock, Kaydessa between them, alert at first to  every sound of the night, their hearts beating faster at a small scrape  of gravel, the rustle of a bush. Slowly, they began to relax.    \"It is well that two sleep while one guards,\" Travis observed. \"By  morning we must push on, out of this country.\"    So the two Apaches shared the watch in turn, the Tatar girl at first  protesting, and then falling exhausted into a slumber which left her  breathing heavily.    Travis, on the dawn watch, began to speculate about the ape-thing they  had killed. The two previous times he had met this creature it had been  in ruins of the old empire. Were there ruins somewhere here? He wanted  to make sure about that. On the other hand, there was the problem of the  Tatar-Mongol settlement controlled by the Reds. There was no doubt in  his mind that, were the Reds to suspect the existence of the Apache  camp, they would make every attempt to hunt down and kill or capture the  survivors from the American ship. A warning must be carried to the  rancheria as quickly as they could make the return trip.    Beside him the girl stirred, raising her head. Travis glanced at her and  then watched with attention. She was looking straight ahead, her eyes as  fixed as if she were in a trance. Now she inched forward from the  mountain wall, wriggling out of its shelter.    \"What--?\" Tsoay had awakened again. But Travis was already moving. He  pushed on, rushing up to stand beside her, shoulder to shoulder.    \"What is it? Where do you go?\" he asked.    She made no answer, did not even seem aware of his voice. He caught at  her arm and she pulled to free herself. When he tightened his grip she  did not fight him actively as during their first encounter, but merely  pulled and twisted as if she were being compelled to go ahead.    Compulsion! He remembered her plea the night before, asking his help  against recapture by the machine. Now he deliberately tripped her,  twisted her hands behind her back. She swayed in his hold, trying to win  to her feet, paying no attention to him save as a hindrance against her  answering that demanding call he could not hear.          7      \"What happened?\" Tsoay took a swift stride, stood over the writhing girl  whose strength was now such that Travis had to exert all his efforts to  control her.    \"I think that the machine she spoke about is holding her. She is being  drawn to it out of hiding as one draws a calf on a rope.\"    Both coyotes had arisen and were watching the struggle with interest,  but there was no warning from them. Whatever called Kaydessa into such  mindless and will-less answer did not touch the animals. And neither  Apache felt it. So perhaps only Kaydessa's people were subject to it, as  she had thought. How far away was that machine? Not too near, for  otherwise the coyotes would have traced the man or men operating it.    \"We cannot move her,\" Tsoay brought the problem into the open--\"unless  we bind and carry her. She is one of their kind. Why not let her go to  them, unless you fear she will talk.\" His hand went to the knife in his  belt, and Travis knew what primitive impulse moved in the younger man.    In the old days a captive who was likely to give trouble was  efficiently eliminated. In Tsoay that memory was awake now. Travis shook  his head.    \"She has said that others of her kin are in these hills. We must not set  two wolf packs hunting us,\" Travis said, giving the more practical  reason which might better appeal to that savage instinct for  self-preservation. \"But you are right, since she has tried to answer  this summons, we cannot force her with us. Therefore, do you take the  back trail. Tell Buck what we have discovered and have him make the  necessary precautions against either these Mongol outlaws or a Red  thrust over the mountains.\"    \"And you?\"    \"I stay to discover where the outlaws hide and learn all I can of this  settlement. We may have reason to need friends----\"    \"Friends!\" Tsoay spat. \"The People need no friends! If we have warning,  we can hold our own country! As the Pinda-lick-o-yi have discovered  before.\"    \"Bows and arrows against guns and machines?\" Travis inquired bitingly.  \"We must know more before we make any warrior boasts for the future.  Tell Buck what we have discovered. Also say I will join you before,\"  Travis calculated--\"ten suns. If I do not, send no search party; the  clan is too small to risk more lives for one.\"    \"And if these Reds take you--?\"    Travis grinned, not pleasantly. \"They shall learn nothing! Can their  machines sort out the thoughts of a dead man?\" He did not intend his  future to end as abruptly as that, but also he would not be easy meat  for any Red hunting party.    Tsoay took a share of their rations and refused the company of the  coyotes. Travis realized that for all his seeming ease with the animals,  the younger scout had little more liking for them than Deklay and the  others back at the rancheria. Tsoay went at dawn, aiming at the pass.    Travis sat down beside Kaydessa. They had bound her to a small tree, and  she strove incessantly to free herself, turning her head at an acute and  painful angle, only to face the same direction in which she had been  tied. There was no breaking the spell which held her. And she would soon  wear herself out with that struggling. Then he struck an expert blow.    The girl sagged limply, and he untied her. It all depended now on the  range of the beam or broadcast of that diabolical machine. From the  attitude of the coyotes, he assumed that those using the machine had not  made any attempt to come close. They might not even know where their  quarry was; they would simply sit and wait in the foothills for the  caller to reel in a helpless captive.    Travis thought that if he moved Kaydessa farther away from that point,  sooner or later they would be out of range and she would awake from the  knockout, free again. Although she was not light, he could manage to  carry her for a while. So burdened, Travis started on, with the coyotes  scouting ahead.    He speedily discovered that he had set himself an ambitious task. The  going was rough, and carrying the girl reduced his advance to a  snail-paced crawl. But it gave him time to make careful plans.    As long as the Reds held the balance of power on this side of the  mountain range, the rancheria was in danger. Bows and knives against  modern armament was no contest at all. And it would only be a matter of  time before exploration on the part of the northern settlement--or some  tracking down of Tatar fugitives--would bring the enemy across the pass.    The Apaches could move farther south into the unknown continent below  the wrecked ship, thus prolonging the time before they were discovered.  But that would only postpone the inevitable showdown. Whether Travis  could make his clan believe that, was also a matter of concern.    On the other hand, if the Red overlords could be met in some practical  way.... Travis' mind fastened on that more attractive idea, worrying it  as Naginlta worried a prey, tearing out and devouring the more delicate  portions. Every bit of sense and prudence argued against such an  approach, whose success could rest only between improbability and  impossibility; yet that was the direction in which he longed to move.    Across his shoulder Kaydessa stirred and moaned. The Apache doubled his  efforts to reach the outcrop of rock he could see ahead, chiseled into  high relief by the winds. In its lee they would have protection from any  sighting from below. Panting, he made it, lowering the girl into the  guarded cup of space, and waited.    She moaned again, lifted one hand to her head. Her eyes were half open,  and still he could not be sure whether they focused on him and her  surroundings intelligently or not.    \"Kaydessa!\"    Her heavy eyelids lifted, and he had no doubt she could see him. But  there was no recognition of his identity in her gaze, only surprise and  fear--the same expression she had worn during their first meeting in the  foothills.    \"Daughter of the Wolf,\" he spoke slowly. \"Remember!\" Travis made that an  order, an"]]]
