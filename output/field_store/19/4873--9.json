Anywhere else in the world, of course, such a pose would not  have been convincing. But your Brazilian not only adopts _fazenda  fita_ as his own avocation, but also suspects it to be everybody  else's too. And a young Brazilian of the leisure class would be  horribly annoyed at being forced to so plebeian an exhibition in  public.    He moved restlessly about the room, staring at the picture. Presently  he blinked uncertainly and gazed about less definitely. He went rather  uncertainly to the chair he had first occupied and sat down. He  poured--or seemed to pour--another drink. Again he sneered, and looked  mortified. He put down the glass with an air of finality. But he  looked puzzledly about him. Then he sank back in his chair and  gradually seemed to sink into a sort of apathetic indifference.           *       *       *       *       *    He looked, then, like a very bored young man on the verge of dozing  off. But actually he was very much alert indeed. He had the feeling of  eyes upon him for a while. Then that sensation ceased and he settled  himself to wait. And meantime he felt a particular, peculiar gratitude  to the late American consul at Puerto Pachecho for his interest in  medicinal plants.    That gentleman had gone into the subject with the passionate  enthusiasm of the amateur. He had described _icus_, _uirari_ and  _timbo_. He had particularized upon _makaka-nimbi_ and _hervamoura_.  And he had gone into a wealth of detail concerning _yague_, on account  of its probable value if used in criminology. As consul at Puerto  Pachecho he was not altogether a success in some ways, but he had  invented an entirely original method of experimentation upon those  drugs and poisons which did not require to be introduced into the  blood-stream. His method was simplicity itself. An alcoholic solution  \"carried\" a minute quantity of the drug in its vapor, just as an  alcoholic solution carries a minute quantity of perfuming essential  oil. He inhaled the odor of the alcoholic solution. The effect was  immediately, strictly temporary, and not dangerous. He was enabled to  describe the odors, in some cases the tastes, and in a few instances  the effects of the substances he listed, from personal experience.           *       *       *       *       *    And Bell had used his method as an unpromising but possible test for a  drug in the drink that had been brought him. He inhaled the strangling  odor of the spilled liquor on his handkerchief. And there was a drug  involved. For an instant he was dizzy, and for an instant he saw the  room through a vivid blue haze. And something clicked in his brain and  said \"It's _yague_.\" And the relief of dealing with something which he  knew--if only at second-hand--was so enormous that he felt almost  weak.    _Yague_, you see, is an extract from the leaves of a plant which is  not yet included in materia medica. It has nearly the effect of  scopolamine--once famous in connection with twilight sleep--and  produces a daze of blue light, an intolerable sleepiness, and  practically all the effects of hypnotism. A person under _yague_, as  under scopolamine or hypnosis, will seem to slumber and yet will obey  any order, by whomever given. He will answer any question without  reserve or any concealment. And on awakening he will remember nothing  done under the influence of the potion. The effects are not  particularly harmful.    Bell then, sat in an apparent half-daze, half-slumber, in the salon in  which he waited for Ribiera to appear. He knew exactly what he was  expected to do. Ribiera wanted to find out what he knew or suspected  about Ortiz's death. Ribiera wanted to know many things, and he would  believe what Bell told him because he thought Bell had taken enough  _yague_ to be practically an hypnotic subject. Let Ribiera believe  what he was told!    When he came into the room, bland and smiling, Bell did not stir. He  was literally crawling, inside, with an unspeakable repulsion to the  man and the things for which he stood. But he seemed dazed and dull,  and when Ribiera began to ask questions he babbled his answers in a  toneless, flat voice. He babbled very satisfactorily, in Ribiera's  view.           *       *       *       *       *    When Ribiera shook him roughly by the shoulder he started, and let his  eyes clear. Ribiera was laughing heartily.    \"Senhor! Senhor!\" said Ribiera jovially. \"My hospitality is at fault!  You come to be my guest and I allow you to be so bored that you drop  off to sleep! I was detained for five minutes and came in to find you  slumbering!\"    Bell stared ruefully about him and rubbed his eyes.    \"I did, for a fact,\" he admitted apologetically. \"I'm sorry. Up late  last night, and I was tired. I dropped in to see those planes you  suggested I'd be interested in. But I daresay it's late, now.\"    Ribiera chuckled again. He was in his late and corpulent forties and  was something of a dandy. If one were captious, one might object to  the thickness of his lips. They suggested sensuality. And there was a  shade--a bare shade--more of pigment in his skin than the American  passes altogether unquestioned. And his hair was wavy.... But he could  be a charming host.    \"We'll have a drink,\" he said bluntly, \"while the car's coming around  to the door, and then go out to the flying field.\"    \"No drink,\" said Bell, lifting his hand. \"I feel squeamish now. I say!  Haven't you changed the lamps, or something? Everything looks  blue....\"    That was a lie. Things looked entirely normal to Bell. But he looked  about him as if vaguely puzzled. If he had drunk the liquor Ribiera  had sent him, things would have had a bluish tinge for some time  after. But as it was....    Ribiera chaffed him jovially on the way to the flying field. And  introducing him to fliers and officials of the field, he told with  gusto of Bell's falling asleep while waiting for him. A very jolly  companion, Ribiera.    But Bell saw two or three men looking at him very queerly. Almost  sympathetically. And he noticed, a little later, that a surprising  number of fliers and officials of the airport seemed to be concealing  an abject terror of Ribiera. One or two of them seemed to hate him as  well.      CHAPTER IV    Bell stepped out of a tall French window to a terrace, and from the  terrace to the ground. There was a dull muttering in the sky to the  east, and a speck appeared, drew nearer swiftly, grew larger, and  became a small army biplane. It descended steeply to earth behind a  tall planting of trees. Bell lighted a cigarette and moved  purposelessly down an elaborately formalized garden.    \"More victims,\" he observed grimly to himself, of the plane.    Ribiera lifted a pigmented hand to wave languidly from a shaded chair.  There were women about him, three of them, and it sickened Bell to see  the frightened assiduity with which they flattered him. Bell had met  them, of course. Madame the wife of the State President of Bahia--in  the United States of Brazil the states have presidents instead of  governors--preferred the title of \"Madame\" because it was more foreign  and consequently more aristocratic than Senhora. And Madame the wife  of the General--    \"Senhor,\" called Ribiera blandly, \"I have news for you.\"    Bell turned and went toward him with an air of pleased expectancy. He  noticed for the first time the third of the women. Young, in the first  flush of youthful maturity, but with an expression of stark terror  lingering behind a palpably assumed animation.    \"An acquaintance of yours, Senhor,\" said Ribiera, \"is to be my  guests.\"    Bell steeled himself.    \"The Senhor Canalejas,\" said Ribiera, beaming, \"and his daughter.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Bell seemed to frown, and then seemed to remember.    \"Oh, yes,\" he said carelessly, \"I met her in Washington. She was on  the _Almirante Gomez_, coming down.\"    The next instant he saw Ribiera's expression, and cursed himself for a  fool. Ribiera's eyes had narrowed sharply. Then they half-closed, and  he smiled.    \"She is charming,\" said Ribiera in drowsy contentment, \"and I had  thought you would be glad to improve her acquaintance. Especially  since, as my friend, you may congratulate me. A contract of marriage  is under discussion.\"    Bell felt every muscle grow taut. The fat, pigmented man before  him....    \"Indeed,\" said Bell politely, \"I do congratulate you.\"    Ribiera looked at him with an expression in which a sardonic  admiration mingled with something else less pleasant.    \"You are clever, Senhor Bell,\" he said heavily, seeming to sink more  deeply into his chair. \"Very clever.\" He shifted his eyes to the women  who stood about him. \"You may go,\" he said indifferently. His tone was  exactly that of a despot dismissing his slaves. Two of them colored  with instinctive resentment. His eyes lingered an instant on the  third. Her face had showed only a passionate relief. \"You, Senhora,\"  he said heavily, \"may wait nearby.\"    The terror returned to her features, but she moved submissively to a  spot a little out of earshot. Bell found his jaws clenched. There is a  certain racial taint widespread in Brazil which leads to an  intolerable arrogance when there is the slightest opportunity for its  exercise. Ribiera had the taint, and Bell felt a sickening wrath at  the terrified submission of the women.    \"_Si_,\" said Ribiera, suddenly adverting to insolence. \"You are  clever, Senhor Bell. Where did you learn of _yague_?\"           *       *       *       *       *    Bell inhaled leisurely. His muscles were tense, but he gave no outward  sign. Instead, he sat down comfortably upon the arm of a chair facing  Ribiera's. The only way to meet insolence is with equal insolence and  a greater calm.    \"Ah!\" said Bell pleasantly. \"So you found out it didn't work, after  all!\"  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29816"],[0,"The Industries of Animals (#12)"],[1,"practised on it. The swoon sometimes  actually takes place before the animal has been touched, and even when  the exciting cause is at a considerable distance.\"[43]       [43] W. H. Hudson, _Naturalist in La Plata_, p. 203.    It is probably a measure of prudence which impels certain birds to  imitate successively the cries of neighbouring animals, in order to  persuade their enemies that all the beasts in creation are brought  together in this spot except themselves. It is perhaps going a little  too far to suppose so reflective and diplomatic a motive, but it is  not doubtful that in certain cases this custom can be very useful to  them by putting their enemies on the wrong scent. In North America  nearly all the species of the Cassique family have this custom. If  they wish to deceive the ears of the great Falcons who watch them--or  is it simple amusement?--they interrupt their own song to introduce  the most varied melodies. If a sheep bleats, the bird immediately  replies to the bleating; the clucking of a turkey, the cackling of a  goose, the cry of the toucan are noted and faithfully reproduced. Then  the Cassique returns to his own special refrain, to abandon it anew on  the first opportunity.[44]       [44] Waterton, _Wanderings in South America_ (First Journey), ch. iii.    Not only do animals thus feign death in order to secure their own  safety, but the female sometimes endeavours to attract an enemy's  attention and feigns to be wounded in order to decoy him away from her  young. This trick is adopted especially by birds. In illustration of  this it will be sufficient to quote from Bendire's _Life Histories of  North American Birds_ some observations by Mr. Ernest Thompson of  Toronto, regarding the Canadian Ruffled Grouse (_Bonasa umbellus  togata_), commonly called the Partridge by Canadians:--\"Every field  man must be acquainted with the simulation of lameness, by which many  birds decoy or try to decoy intruders from their nests. This is an  invariable device of the Partridge, and I have no doubt that it is  quite successful with the natural foes of the bird; indeed it is often  so with Man. A dog, as I have often seen, is certain to be misled and  duped, and there is little doubt that a mink, skunk, racoon, fox,  coyote, or wolf would fare no better. Imagine the effects of the  bird's tactics on a prowling fox: he has scented her as she sits; he  is almost upon her, but she has been watching him, and suddenly, with  a loud 'whirr,' she springs up and tumbles a few yards before him. The  suddenness and noise with which the bird appears cause the fox to be  totally carried away; he forgets all his former experience, he never  thinks of the eggs, his mind is filled with the thought of the wounded  bird almost within his reach; a few more bounds and his meal will be  secured. So he springs and springs, and very nearly catches her, and  in his excitement he is led on, and away, till finally the bird flies  off, leaving him a quarter of a mile or more from the nest.    \"If instead of eggs the Partridge has chicks, she does not await the  coming of the enemy, but runs to meet and mislead him ere yet he is in  the neighbourhood of the brood; she then leads him far away, and  returning by a circuitous route, gathers her young together again by  her clucking. When surprised she utters a well-known danger-signal, a  peculiar whine, whereupon the young ones hide under logs and among  grass. Many persons say they will each seize a leaf in their beaks and  then turn over on their backs. I have never found any support for this  idea, although I have often seen one of the little creatures crawl  under a dead leaf.\"[45]       [45] Bendire, _Life Histories of North American Birds_          (_Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge_, vol. xxviii.),          1892, p. 64.    _Resistance in common by social animals._--If neither flight nor feint  has saved an animal from the hunter, he naturally fights as long as he  can, but this struggle _in extremis_ is rarely crowned with success.  Certain species, especially those which live in society, are able  nevertheless, by uniting their efforts, to resist enemies who would  easily triumph over them if they were isolated.    Among tribes of Apes mutual assistance, as described by Brehm, is  common. When by chance a bird of prey, such as an eagle, has thrown  himself on a young ape who is amusing himself far from the maternal  eye, the little one does not let himself be taken without resistance;  he clings to the branches and utters shrill and despairing cries. His  appeals are heard, and in an instant a dozen agile males arrive to  save him; they throw themselves on the imprudent ravisher and seize  him, one by the claw, another by the neck, another by a wing, pulling  him about and harassing him. The bird struggles as well as he can,  distributing around him blows from talons and beak. But he is often  strangled, and when his temerity does not receive this extreme  punishment, the feathers which fall from him when he flies away bear  witness that he has not emerged unscathed from the scuffle.    Animals like Buffaloes resist by a common defence the most terrible  Carnivora. Even the Tiger is their victim, although if one of them met  that wild beast alone he would surely become its prey. Being very  agile, the tiger can reach by one leap the back of the ruminant, whose  brutal and massive force cannot thus be exercised; but the feline who  falls into the midst of a troop fares very badly. One buffalo falls on  him with lowered horns, and with a robust blow of the head throws him  into the air. The tiger cannot regain his senses, for as soon as he  reaches the ground, and often even before, he is again seized and  thrown towards other horns. Thus thrown from one to another like a  ball, he is promptly put to death.    The less terrible Carnivora give Buffaloes no trouble. Wolves do not  dare to attack them when they are united; they await in ambush the  passage of some strayed calf, and rapidly gain possession of it before  the rest of the flock are aware, or they would dearly pay for their  attack.    The Bisons of North America, near relatives of the Buffaloes, also  repulse Wolves in common; and if Man succeeds better against them it  is owing to the skill which he shows in hiding himself and not  attracting their attention. Every one knows how Indians hunt the Bison  with arrows, and his pursuit is very risky to the hunter, for he must  not be discovered by the game, as he would then be trodden underfoot  or disembowelled. In the immense prairies where these ruminants feed,  a few Indians covered by bisons' skins advance on all fours, so that  nothing betrays their presence. The victims fall one by one beneath  silent blows, and their companions, who can see nothing suspicious in  the neighbourhood, are not disturbed, supposing them, no doubt, to be  peacefully resting.    It is not only against other animals that these great mammals have to  defend themselves; they are much afraid of heat, and they are  accustomed, especially in the south of Persia, to ruminate while lying  in the water during the hot hours of the day. They only allow the end  of the snout, or at most the head, to appear. It is a curious  spectacle when fording a river to see emerge from the reeds the great  heads and calm eyes of the Buffaloes, who follow with astonishment all  the movements of the horsemen, although nothing will disturb their  sweet and fresh siesta.    But let us return to defences arranged in common. Horses are extremely  sociable, and in the immense pampas of South America those who become  wild again live in large troops. In difficult circumstances they help  one another. If a great danger threatens them all the colts and mares  assemble together, and the stallions form a circle round the group,  ready to drive back the assailant. But they do not accomplish this  manoeuvre in the presence of an enemy of small importance. When a wolf  appears on the plain all the males run after him, seeking to strike  him with their feet and kill him, unless prompt flight delivers him  from their blows.    The sociable humour of these horses makes them compassionate towards  their fellows who are enslaved by man, and if a harnessed cart meets  on its road a free band, it is a serious matter to the owner. They run  up and surround the enslaved horse, saluting him with their cries and  gambols, having the air of inviting him to throw his harness to the  winds and follow them on the plain, where grass grows for all without  work. Naturally the driver endeavours to preserve his noble conquest,  and distributes blows with the whip to those who wish to debauch it.  Then the wild horses become furious, and throw themselves on the  vehicle; they break it with their feet and cut their comrade's traces  with their teeth to enable him to share their own free life. The  enterprise satisfactorily concluded, they gallop away neighing in  triumph.    It is owing to their union in large bands that Crows have so little to  fear from diurnal birds of prey; if one approaches, they do not  hesitate to throw themselves on him altogether. The Great Horn Owl,  however, causes many ravages among them; for when asleep at night the  Crow is without defence against the ravisher, for whom, on the  contrary, obscurity is propitious. Thus they recognise him as a  hereditary enemy, and never allow an opportunity of revenge to pass  without profiting by it. If by chance an owl appears by day and one of  them perceives him, immediately a clamour arises--a veritable cry of  war; all those who are in the neighbourhood fly to the spot, and  business ceases; the nocturnal bird of prey is assaulted, riddled with  blows from beaks, stunned, his feathers torn out, and, notwithstanding  his defence, he succumbs to numbers.    In all the preceding examples the social species unite for the common  security the forces and"]]]
