In fact, the man who shall attempt to treat  the diseases of the dog, will have no little annoyance to surmount. He  will soon discover that science unfortunately can afford him but partial  help, while prejudice on every side increases the difficulties with which  he will have to contend.    Happily, however, the majority of pretended cures are harmless. A roll of  sulphur in the animal's water may be permitted, since it amuses the  proprietor while it does not injure his dog. Some of these domestic  recipes, nevertheless, are far from harmless, and they are the more to be  deprecated, because those which most people would imagine to be safe are  the very ones which are attended with the greatest danger. Common salt is  a poison to the dog; tobacco is the source of many a death in the kennel;  castor oil often does the ill which months of care are needed to efface,  even if the life be not destroyed. In the majority of cases vomits are far  from beneficial; bleeding is very seldom required, and the warm bath has  sealed the doom of innumerable animals.    The foregoing observations will have informed the reader of the reasons  that prompt the publication of the present work, which is put forth only  as a step towards the point the author does not yet pretend to have fully  attained. The study of years will be required to perfect that which is now  commenced, and further experience will probably demand the retraction of  many of the opinions herein advanced. The reader will understand, the  author in the present work asserts only that which he now believes. It  must not be imagined, however positive may read the language in which his  sentiments are expressed, that the writer is pledged to uphold any of the  conclusions at which he may have arrived; knowledge is in its nature  progressive, and canine pathology is not yet clearly made out. The  advantages which accompany the study of anatomy, physiology, and  therapeutics have yet to be more largely applied to the diseases of the  dog, and until this has been accomplished, science, not reposing upon  truth, will be constantly subjected to change. The present work,  therefore, will be accepted only as a contribution to veterinary  literature, and its contents will be viewed as doing nothing more than  declaring the temporary convictions of one, who, desirous of truth, does  not conceal that his mind is oppressed by many doubts.    In the following pages advantage will be freely taken of the labours of  those authors who have written upon the subject; nor must it be supposed,  because the writer may feel himself obliged to dissent from, he therefore  undervalues the genius of Blaine or Youatt. Before Blaine collected and  arranged the knowledge which existed concerning the diseases of the dog,  canine pathology, as a separate or distinct branch of veterinary science,  hardly existed. The task he accomplished; but if after the lapse of years  some of his opinions are found to be unsound, and some of his statements  discovered to require correction, these circumstances may be regarded as  the natural consequences of progression, while they in no way deteriorate  from the honor due to his name. Youatt enlarged and softened the teaching  of his master, and by the liberality of his communications, and the  gentleness of his example, improved and adorned the science to which he  was attached. To others than these two great men I have no obligations to  acknowledge. For their memories I take the opportunity of expressing the  highest respect, and confess that to their instruction is fairly due any  novelty which the present pages may contain; since but for those  advantages their teaching afforded, it is more than doubtful if I had  perceived the facts herein made known.    Before any mention is made of the diseases of the dog, it will be proper  to take some notice of the temperament of the animal, as without regarding  this the best selected medicines, or the most assiduous attention, may be  of no avail. Any one who will observe the animal will soon be made aware  of its excessive irritability. The nervous system in this creature is  largely developed, and, exerting an influence over all its actions, gives  character to the beast. The brain of the dog is seldom in repose, for even  when asleep the twitching of the legs and the suppressed sounds which it  emits inform us that it is dreaming. No animal is more actuated by the  power of imagination. Who is there that has not seen the dog mistake  objects during the dusk of the evening? Delirium usually precedes its  death, and nervous excitability is the common accompaniment of most of its  disorders. To diseases of a cerebral or spinal character it is more liable  than is any other domesticated animal. Its very bark is symbolical of its  temperament, and its mode of attack energetically declares the  excitability of its nature. The most fearful of all the diseases to which  it is exposed (rabies), is essentially of a nervous character, and there  are few of its disorders which do not terminate with symptoms indicative  of cranial disturbance. This tendency to cerebral affections will, if  properly considered, suggest those casual and appropriate acts which the  dog in affliction may require, and which it would be impossible for any  author fully to describe. Gentleness should at all times be practised; but  to be truly gentle the reader must understand it is imperative to be firm.  Hesitation, to an irritable being, is, or soon becomes, positive torture.    He who would attend upon the dog must be able to command his feeling, and,  whatever fear he may be conscious of, he must have power to conceal his  emotion. The hand slowly and cautiously advanced, to be hastily retracted,  is nearly certain to be bitten. Whatever therefore is attempted should be  done with at least the appearance of confidence, and the determination of  the man will, in the generality of cases, check the disposition of the  beast. There should be no wrestling or fighting. The practitioner should  so prepare his acts as to prevent the dog in the first instance from  effectually resisting, and the animal mastered at the commencement is  usually afterwards submissive. If, however, from any cause, the primary  attempt should not be effective, the attendant, rather than provoke a  contest which can be productive of no beneficial result, should for a  brief period retire, and after a little time he may with better success  renew his purpose.    Strange dogs are not easily examined in their own homes, especially if  they be favorites and their indulgent owners are present. Like spoiled  children, the beasts seem to be aware of all the advantages which the  affections of their master give to their humors. They will assume so much,  and play such antics, as renders it impossible to arrive at any just  conclusion as to the actual state of their health. Dogs in fact are great  impostors, and he who has had much to do with them soon learns how  cunningly the pampered \"toy\" of the drawing-room can \"sham.\" For  deception, consequently, it is necessary to be prepared, and practice  quickly teaches us to distinguish between what is real and that which is  assumed. The exertion, however, required to feign disturbs the system, and  the struggle which always accompanies the act renders it frequently  impossible to make the necessary observation with requisite nicety. Petted  dogs are, therefore, best examined away from their homes, and in the  absence of any one who has been in the habit of caressing them.  Frequently I have found it of no avail to attempt the examination of these  creatures at the residences of their owners; but the same animals brought  to my surgery have, without a struggle, allowed me to take what liberties  I pleased. I usually carry such dogs into a room by myself, and commence  by quickly but gently lifting them off their legs and throwing them upon  their backs. This appears to take the creatures by surprise, and a little  assurance soon allays any fear which the action may have excited. The dog  seldom after resists, but permits itself to be freely handled. Should,  however, any disposition to bite be exhibited, the hand ought immediately  to grasp the throat, nor should the hold be relinquished until the  creature is fully convinced of the inutility of its malice, and thoroughly  assured that no injury is intended towards it. A few kind words, and the  absence of anything approaching to severity, will generally accomplish the  latter object in a short period, and confidence being gained, the brute  seldom violates the contract.    Dogs are intelligent and honorable creatures, and no man will have reason  to regret who teaches himself to trust in their better qualities. I have  hitherto, in a great measure, escaped their teeth, and being slow and  infirm, my good fortune certainly cannot be attributed to my activity.  Kindness and consideration work upon animals; nor do I believe there are  many of the lower creatures that will not appreciate such appeals. It is  better, therefore, to work upon the sympathetic nature of the brute, than  to compete with it in strength, or endeavor to outvie it in agility.  Manual dexterity will often fail, and is seldom employed save when danger  is present. Mental supremacy appealing to the source of action ensures  safety, by subduing, not the resistance, but the desire to resist.    It is easy to ascertain when the dog has regained that tranquillity which  would allow of its being trusted with security. The eye need alone be  consulted, and a little observation will speedily instruct any one to read  its meaning correctly. When the creature is irritated, the pupil  invariably dilates, and by singly marking this circumstance, the temper of  the beast may be correctly ascertained. Nor should caution be discarded  until the contracted circle"]]]
