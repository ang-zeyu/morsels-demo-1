This was the  experience with nearly all the other plates--one of the many annoying  problems of war.  However, the new plates were doubled and bolted.  Then they were covered with sandbags and erected so as not to be too  obvious on the parapet.  This scheme defied the sniper and the Maxim,  and, in this way, the Turks' fire was subdued.  This was important.  In  trench warfare the enemy must be terrorised.  Not a head must be  allowed to bob up, not a rifle and eye seen.  Snipers must be hunted to  death and given such a hefty and quick dispatch as to intimidate their  successors.  Water parties and ration parties have to be set on the  run; reinforcements spotted and scattered; officers, too, must be kept  in their place--below the parapet, if not below the sod.  All of this  means that the enemy gets demoralised and sickened.  And when he has  had a month or two of this gentle treatment he is easily dealt with  when the time comes for an offensive and bayonet charge.    Of course, the Turks did not let the Australasians have it entirely  their own way.  When sniping and rifle fire became too dangerous, they  resorted to the bomb.  The bomb isn't a respectable thing.  It  sometimes takes your head off, and frequently punctures the system in  rather an ugly manner.  When a bomb hits, you know it.  It is something  like a railway engine striking a match-box.  These Turkish  bomb-throwers had some idea of making a sort of Irish slew out of their  opponents' bodies.  They bombed _and_ bombed _and_ bombed.  Now, this  wasn't at all polite, and it was most uncomfortable, especially when  sitting down to a stolen Maconochie--an appetising dish.  These bombs  burst the parapets, ripped up the sandbags, and knocked men's brains  into other men's eyes.  Most annoying!  One morning a bomb just missed  Bill's head.    \"What the--who the--why the----  These blamed ole Turks think my head's  a coconut,\" said Bill.    \"I hope they'll never hit your head,\" remarked Claud.    \"Why?\"    \"It's too full----\"    \"Of water,\" interjected Paddy.    \"Yes, there _would_ be a flood,\" concluded Claud, as he lit his pipe.  Just then an order was sent down to pass all empty jam tins to the rear.    \"Wot's the jam tins for?\"    \"Fly traps,\" said Paddy.    \"'Spect we'll have to dig the lead out of the dead men's bodies next,\"  groused Bill, as he went down the trenches to collect the fly-covered  jam tins.  These were sent down to the beach in bags, causing many a  grouse on the way.  Rumour had it that some Jew had made a contract for  the empty tins, another yarn was that they were for growing flowers  round the General's dug-out.  But mysterious and resourceful are the  ways of the General Staff!  These jam tins were redelivered to The  Kangaroo Marines next day in the shape of bombs.    \"Well I'm jiggered!\" said Bill.  \"First they puts jam in tins, next  they puts bombs in them.\"    \"And then they'll shove you in them,\" interjected Claud.    \"What for?\"    \"Prime Australian beef, fresh tinned, straight from the Dardanelles.  That would look well on a label.\"    \"Yis couldn't do that with Bill,\" said Paddy.    \"Why?\"    \"He's a bit high----\"    Bang! came a Turkish bomb at that moment, scattering the group into  their shelters below the parapets.    \"Ye dirty, mouldy-faced sons of dog-eatin', blue-nosed spalpeens--Oi'll  bomb yis,\" roared Paddy, gripping a jam tin and lighting the fuse.    Bang! it went.  Bang!  Bang!  Bang! went more.    \"_Some_ jam,\" said Bill, as he watched through the periscope.  And then  they heard moaning, shrieks, and shouts of \"Allah, Allah.\"    \"More jam,\" ordered Bill.  And more jam they received.  It wasn't  sweet, and certainly unpalatable.  And it didn't stick.  Tins labelled  \"Apricot,\" \"Marmalade,\" \"Black Currant,\" and \"Raspberry,\" went hurtling  through the air, then burst in a very nasty way above the poor old  Turks' trenches.  This battle of jam bombs made the Turks much more  respectful for a time.  Indeed, one of the officers, who must have been  a sportsman, flung over a note, on which was written:      \"DEAR AUSTRALIANS,--We like jam--in fact, we could do with a tin of it,  but not that dam--jam--jammy stuff you were putting over last  night.--Yours fraternally,    \"YUSSEF BEY.\"      \"By Jove!  He's a sport--let's chuck him a tin,\" said Claud.  And over  it went.  The Turks scattered and waited, but there was no explosion.  With a smile the Turkish officer picked up the tin.  Unfastening a note  tied round it, he read:      \"DEAR YUSSEF,--This is the _real_ stuff.  By the way, you were at Rugby  with me.  Shall be sorry to kill you.--Yours, etc.,    \"CLAUD DUFAIR.\"      Plunk! came a stone into the Australian lines; round it was fixed a  note:      \"DEAR CLAUD,--Many thanks--it was a god-send.  Fancy you being here.  I  thought you would have been guarding the Marys and Mauds of London from  the Zepps.  Congrats!  Of course, I shall be sorry to kill  _you_.--Yours, etc.,    \"YUSSEF BEY.    \"_P.S._--There will be no firing to-day--go to bed.\"      And there was no firing.  This Turkish officer, like every other  Turkish soldier, was a gentleman.    It is remarkable how circumstances produce the inventor.  At Hell-Fire  Post the men found that the ordinary square periscope was almost  useless.  Every time one went up, bang went a Turk's rifle, and the  periscope was blown to smithereens.  Indeed, The Kangaroos lost nearly  all their periscopes in the first few days.  Now this was awkward.  Periscopes are life-savers, for the periscope prevents a man pushing  his head above the parapet to see if Johnny Turk is coming over to say  \"Good morning.\"  Something had to be done, so the famous quartette  began to cudgel their brains.    \"I've got it,\" said Claud, picking up a walking-stick.    \"Got what,\" inquired Bill.    \"An idea--you watch.\"  Taking a penknife out of his pocket, he deftly  and quickly cut away the inner portion of the stick.  This kept him  busy for a couple of hours.  When finished, he took a little pocket  mirror out of his haversack.    \"Too big,\" said Bill.    \"No, it isn't,\" answered Claud, slipping a diamond ring off his finger.  He scratched the mirror, then cut two pieces out of it.  These he fixed  into the walking-stick.  \"There you are now--a brand new periscope.\"  And it proved just the thing.  The field of vision was quite good.  Being small it did not attract attention.  The result of this discovery  was that every officer's stick was immediately commandeered, and with  the aid of Claud's ring and other people's mirrors, a good supply of  periscopes were made.    \"You think you're smart fellers, I suppose,\" said Bill, his envy roused  by this success.   \"But I'll show you fellers something in a day or  two.\"    \"What is it?\"    \"'Wait and see,' as old Asquith says.\"  For the next few days Bill was  seen in close communion with a fellow Australian.   They went about the  trenches picking up bits of wood, nails, mirrors, and other odds and  ends.  These were carried into the little hole of the inventive genius,  and there all gradually saw the growth of a wonderful invention.  It  wasn't Bill's idea exactly.  He was simply the managing director, who  stimulated curiosity, and fetched the mysterious genius the necessary  supplies of material.  Anyone who ventured too near the sacred sanctum  was told to \"hop it.\"    \"What's that ould rascal doin'?\" Paddy remarked one day.    \"A bomb-thrower,\" said Sandy.    \"Barbed wire burster,\" suggested Claud.    \"No, it ain't,\" interjected Bill, who happened to come along at the  time.    \"What is it, then?\"    \"It's a man-killer.  You can sit down in yer bed and kill all the ole  Turks in front.  They can't see who's killin' them.\"    \"When do you try it?\"    \"To-day.\"  And he did.  That afternoon the inventor allowed Bill to  have the trial shot.  The instrument, in brief, was a periscope rifle.  With the aid of an ordinary rifle, mirrors and wood fixed up in a  rough, but ingenious way, there had been produced a killing instrument,  which allowed the user to see and to kill without being seen.  This was  a godsend, for many of the casualties at this post were due to men  aiming through the loopholes or over the parapet.    \"Here goes,\" said Bill, fixing the rifle in position.    \"See anything?\"    \"Yes, a big feller.  I'll get him in his ole fat head.\"  Slowly and  steadily he took aim, then bang went his rifle.    \"Got him!  Got him!  Right in his coconut,\" shouted Bill with a grim  delight.    The invention was hailed as a great success, and the inventor  complimented all round.  His orders were many, and his instrument soon  became general throughout the whole line.  Indeed, it was owing to this  wonderful invention that the rifle fire of the Turks was again subdued  to a remarkable extent.    Other remarkable things were invented by these resourceful fellows.  The General Staff also supplied them with new machines of war.  One of  the finest was the Japanese bomb-thrower, an instrument which threw a  great, big bomb like a well-filled melon.  This went tumbling over and  over, like an acrobat doing a somersault, then burst in the most  startling way.  The explosion was terrific and destruction amazing.  Parapets, trenches, men and Maxims were all destroyed if near the point  of contact.  \"_Some_ bomb!\" as the boys said.    In this sort of warfare it is always the progressive and alert man who  wins.  It is useless sitting down and grousing.  Every means, every  trick is justifiable so long as the methods are fair and according to  the rules of war.  When the history of this war is written special  attention ought to be devoted to the many devices which have been  employed by the soldier.  For example, the Turks opposite to The  Kangaroos were always sapping towards the Australasian lines.  This was  a nuisance.  The constant pick! pick! pick! upset everybody.  Night  after night these Turkish "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2546"],[0,"Hopalong Cassidy's Rustler Round-Up; Or, Bar-20 (#12)"],[1," heard a soft footfall, and swerving in his saddle  he turned and struck with all his might in the face of a man who leaped  at him, at the same time grasping the uplifted wrist with his other  hand. A curse and the tinkle of thin steel on the pavement accompanied  the fall of his opponent. Bending down from his saddle he picked up the  weapon and the next minute the enraged assassin was staring into the  unwavering and, to him, growing muzzle of a Colt's .45.    \"Yu shore had a bum teacher. Don't yu know better'n to push it in? An'  me a cowpuncher, too! I'm most grieved at yore conduct--it shows you  don't appreciate cow-wrastlers. This is safer,\" he remarked, throwing  the stiletto through the air and into a door, where it rang out angrily  and quivered. \"I don't know as I wants to ventilate yu; we mostly  poisons coyotes up my way,\" he added. Then a thought struck him. \"Yu  must be that dear Manuel I've been hearin' so much about?\"    A snarl was the only reply and Hopalong grinned.    \"Yu shore ain't got no call to go loco that way, none whatever. I don't  want yore Carmencita. I only called to say hulloo,\" responded Hopalong,  his sympathies being aroused for the wounded man before him from his  vivid recollection of the woman who had opened the door.    \"Yah!\" snarled Manuel. \"You wants to poison my little bird. You with  your fair hair and your cursed swagger!\"    The six-shooter tentatively expanded and stopped six inches from the  Mexican's nose. \"Yu wants to ride easy, hombre. I ain't no angel, but I  don't poison no woman; an' don't yu amble off with th' idea in yore head  that she wants to be poisoned. Why, she near stuck a knife in me!\" he  lied.    The Mexican's face brightened somewhat, but it would take more than that  to wipe out the insult of the blow. The horse became restless, and when  Hopalong had effectively quieted it he spoke again.    \"Did yu ever hear of Tamale Jose?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Well, I'm th' fellow that stopped him in th' 'dobe hut by th' arroyo.  I'm tellin' yu this so yu won't do nothin' rash an' leave Carmencita a  widow. Sabe?\"    The hate on the Mexican's face redoubled and he took a short step  forward, but stopped when the muzzle of the Colt kissed his nose. He was  the brother of Tamale Jose. As he backed away from the cool touch of  the weapon he thought out swiftly his revenge. Some of his brother's  old companions were at that moment drinking mescal in a saloon down the  street, and they would be glad to see this Americano die. He glanced  past his house at the saloon and Hopalong misconstrued his thoughts.    \"Shore, go home. I'll just circulate around some for exercise. No hard  feelings, only yu better throw it next time,\" he said as he backed away  and rode off. Manuel went down the street and then ran into the saloon,  where he caused an uproar.    Hopalong rode to the end of the plaza and tried to sing, but it was a  dismal failure. Then he felt thirsty and wondered why he hadn't thought  of it before. Turning his horse and seeing the saloon he rode up to it  and in, lying flat on the animal's neck to avoid being swept off by the  door frame. His entrance scared white some half a dozen loungers, who  immediately sprang up in a decidedly hostile manner. Hopalong's Colts  peeped over the ears of his horse and he backed into a corner near the  bar.    \"One, two, three--now, altogether, breathe! Yu acts like yu never saw a  real puncher afore. All th' same,\" he remarked, nodding at several  of the crowd, \"I've seen yu afore. Yu are th' gents with th' hot-foot  get-a-way that vamoosed when we got Tamale.\"    Curses were flung at him and only the humorous mood he was in saved  trouble. One, bolder than the rest, spoke up: \"The senor will not see  any 'hot-foot get-a-way,' as he calls it, now! The senor was not wise to  go so far away from his friends!\"'    Hopalong looked at the speaker and a quizzical grin slowly spread over  his face. \"They'll shore feel glad when I tells them yu was askin' for  'em. But didn't yu see too much of 'em once, or was yu poundin' leather  in the other direction? Yu don't want to worry none about me--an' if yu  don't get yore hands closter to yore neck they'll be heck to pay! There,  that's more like home,\" he remarked, nodding assurance.    Reaching over he grasped a bottle and poured out a drink, his Colt  slipping from his hand and dangling from his wrist by a thong. As the  weapon started to fall several of the audience involuntarily moved as if  to pick it up. Hopalong noticed this and paused with the glass half  way to his lips. \"Don't bother yoreselves none; I can git it again,\" he  said, tossing off the liquor.    \"Wow! Holy smoke!\" he yelled. \"This ain't drink! Sufferin' coyotes,  nobody can accuse yu of sellin' liquor! Did yu make this all by  yoreself?\" He asked incredulously of the proprietor, who didn't know  whether to run or to pray. Then he noticed that the crowd was spreading  out and his Colts again became the center of interest.    \"Yu with th' lovely face, sit down!\" he ordered as the person addressed  was gliding toward the door. \"I ain't a-goin' to let yu pot me from th'  street. Th' first man who tries to get scarce will stop somethin' hot.  An' yu all better sit down,\" he suggested, sweeping them with his guns.  One man, more obdurate than the rest, was slow in complying and Hopalong  sent a bullet through the top of his high sombrero, which had a most  gratifying effect.    \"You'll regret this!\" hissed a man in the rear, and a murmur of  assent arose. Some one stirred slightly in searching for a weapon and  immediately a blazing Colt froze him into a statue.    \"Yu shore looks funny; eeny, meeny, miny, mo,\" counted off the daring  horseman; \"move a bit an' off yu go,\" he finished. Then his face broke  out in another grin as he thought of more enjoyment.    \"That there gent on th' left,\" he said, pointing out with a gun the man  he meant. \"Yu sing us a song. Sing a nice little song.\"    As the object of his remarks remained mute he let his thumb  ostentatiously slide back with the hammer of the gun under it. \"Sing!  Quick!\" The man sang.    As Hopalong leaned forward to say something a stiletto flashed past his  neck and crashed into the bottle beside him. The echo of the crash was  merged into a report as Hopalong fired from his waist. Then he backed  out into the Street and, wheeling, galloped across the plaza and again  faced the saloon. A flash split the darkness and a bullet hummed over  his head and thudded into an adobe wall at his back. Another shot and he  replied, aiming at the flash.    From down the Street came the sound of a window opening and he promptly  caused it to close again. Several more windows opened and hastily  closed, and he rode slowly toward the far end of the plaza. As he faced  the saloon once more he heard a command to throw up his hands and saw  the glint of a gun, held by a man who wore the insignia of sheriff.  Hopalong complied, but as his hands went up two spurts of fire shot  forth and the sheriff dropped his weapon, reeled and sat down. Hopalong  rode over to him and swinging down, picked up the gun and looked the  officer over.        \"Shoo, yu'll be all right soon--yore only plugged in th' arms,\" he  remarked as he glanced up the street. Shadowy forms were gliding from  cover to cover and he immediately caused consternation among them by  his accuracy. \"Ain't it sad?\" He complained to the wounded man. \"I never  starts out but what somebody makes me shoot 'em. Came down here to see  a girl an' find she's married. Then when I moves on peaceable--like her  husband makes me hit him. Then I wants a drink an' he goes an' fans a  knife at me, an' me just teachin' him how! Then yu has to come along an'  make more trouble\".    \"Now look at them fools over there,\" he said, pointing at a dark shadow  some fifty paces off. \"They're pattin' their backs because I don't  see 'em, an' if I hurts them they'll git mad. Guess I'll make 'em dust  along,\" he added, shooting into the spot. A howl went up and two men ran  away at top speed.    The sheriff nodded his sympathy and spoke. \"I reckons you had better  give up. You can't get away. Every house, every corner and shadow holds  a man. You are a brave man, but, as you say, unfortunate. Better help me  up and come with me--they'll tear you to pieces.\"    \"Shore I'll help yu up--I ain't got no grudge against nobody. But my  friends know where I am an' they'll come down here an' raise a ruction  if I don't show up. So, if it's all th' same to you, I'll be ambling  right along,\" he said as he helped the sheriff to his feet.    \"Have you any objections to telling me your name?\" Asked the sheriff as  he looked himself over.    \"None whatever,\" answered Hopalong heartily. \"I'm Hopalong Cassidy of  th' Bar 20, Texas.\"    \"You don't surprise me--I've heard of you,\" replied the sheriff wearily.  \"You are the man who killed Tamale Jose, whom I hunted for unceasingly.  I found him when you had left and I got the reward. Come again some  time and I'll divide with you; two hundred and fifty dollars,\" he added  craftily.    \"I shore will, but I don't want no money,\" replied Hopalong as he turned  away. \"Adios, senor,\" he called back.    \"Adios,\" replied the sheriff as he kicked a nearby door for assistance.    The cow-pony tied itself up in knots as it pounded down the street  toward the trail, and although he was fired on he swung into the dusty  trail with a song on his lips. Several hours later he stood dripping wet  on the American side of the Rio Grande and shouted advice to a score of  Mexican cavalrymen on the opposite bank. Then he slowly picked his way  toward El Paso for a game at Faro Dan's.    The sheriff sat in his easy chair one night some three weeks later,  gravely engaged in rolling a cigarette. His arms were practically well,  the wounds being in the fleshy parts. He was a philosopher and was  disposed to take things easy, which accounted"]]]
