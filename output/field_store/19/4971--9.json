Nor was the Don himself less melancholy; for he felt himself so  bruised and battered that he could hardly sit on the ass; and now and  then he breathed such grievous sighs, as seemed to pierce the very  skies, which moved his compassionate neighbour once more to entreat  him to declare to him the cause of his grief: so he bethought himself  of the Moor Abindaraez, whom Rodrigo de Narvaez, Alcade of Antequera,  took and carried prisoner to his castle; so that when the husbandman  asked him how he did and what ailed him, he answered word for word as  the prisoner Abindaraez replied to Rodrigo de Narvaez, in the Diana of  George di Montemayor, where that adventure is related; applying it so  properly to his purpose, that the countryman wished himself any where  than within the hearing of such strange nonsense; and being now fully  convinced that his neighbour's brains were turned, he made all the  haste he could to the village, to be rid of him. Don Quixote in the  mean time thus went on: \"You must know, Don Rodrigo de Narvaez, that  this beautiful Xerifa, of whom I gave you an account, is at present  the most lovely Dulcinea del Toboso, for whose sake I have done, still  do, and will achieve the most famous deeds of chivalry that ever were,  are, or ever shall be seen in the universe.\" \"Good sir,\" replied the  husbandman, \"I am not Don Rodrigo de Narvaez, nor the Marquis of  Mantua, but Pedro Alonzo by name, your worship's neighbour; nor are  you Baldwin, nor Abindaraez, but only that worthy gentleman Senior  Quixada.\" \"I know very well who I am,\" answered Don Quixote; \"and  what's more, I know, that I may not only be the persons I have named,  but also the twelve peers of France, nay and the nine worthies all in  one; since my achievements will out-rival not only the famous exploits  which made any of them singly illustrious, but all their mighty deeds  accumulated together.\"    Thus discoursing, they at last got near their village about sunset;  but the countryman stayed at some distance till it was dark, that the  distressed gentleman might not be seen so scurvily mounted, and then  he led him home to his own house, which he found in great confusion.  The curate and the barber of the village, both of them Don Quixote's  intimate acquaintances, happened to be there at that juncture, as also  the housekeeper, who was arguing with them: \"What do you think, pray,  good Doctor Perez,\" said she, (for this was the curate's name) \"what  do you think of my master's mischance? neither he, nor his horse, nor  his target, lance, nor armour, have been seen these six days. What  shall I do, wretch that I am? I dare lay my life, and it is as sure as  I am a living creature, that those cursed books of errantry, which he  used to be always poring upon, have set him beside his senses; for now  I remember I have heard him often mutter to himself that he had a mind  to turn knight-errant, and ramble up and down the world to find out  adventures.\" His niece added, addressing herself to the barber; \"You  must know, Mr. Nicholas, that many times my uncle would read you those  unconscionable books of disventures for eight-and-forty hours  together; then away he would throw his book, and drawing his sword, he  would fall a fencing against the walls; and when he had tired himself  with cutting and slashing, he would cry he had killed four giants as  big as any steeples; and the sweat which he put himself into, he would  say was the blood of the wounds he had received in the fight: then  would he swallow a huge jug of cold water, and presently he would be  as quiet and as well as ever he was in his life; and he said that this  same water was a sort of precious drink brought him by the sage  Esquife, a great magician and his special friend. Now, it is I who am  the cause of all this mischief, for not giving you timely notice of my  uncle's raving, that you might have put a stop to it, ere it was too  late, and have burnt all these excommunicated books; for there are I  do not know how many of them that deserve as much to be burnt as those  of the rankest heretics.\" \"I am of your mind,\" said the curate; \"and  verily to-morrow shall not pass over before I have fairly brought them  to a trial, and condemned them to the flames, that they may not  minister occasion to such as would read them, to be perverted after  the example of my good friend.\"    The countryman, who, with Don Quixote, stood without, listening to all  this discourse, now perfectly understood the cause of his neighbour's  disorder; and, without any more ado, he called out, \"Open the gates  there, for the Lord Baldwin, and the Lord Marquis of Mantua, who is  coming sadly wounded; and for the Moorish Lord Abindaraez, whom the  valorous Don Rodrigo de Narvaez, Alcade of Antequera, brings  prisoner.\" At which words they all got out of doors; and the one  finding it to be her uncle, and the other to be her master, and the  rest their friend, who had not yet alighted from the ass, because  indeed he was not able, they all ran to embrace him; to whom Don  Quixote: \"Forbear,\" said he, \"for I am sorely hurt, by reason that my  horse failed me; carry me to bed, and, if it be possible, let the  enchantress Urganda be sent for to cure my wounds.\" \"Now,\" quoth the  housekeeper, \"see whether I did not guess right, on which foot my  master halted!--Come, get to bed, I beseech you; and, my life for  yours, we will take care to cure you without sending for that same  Urganda. A hearty curse, I say, light upon those books of chivalry  that have put you in this pickle!\" Whereupon they carried him to his  bed, and searched for his wounds, but could find none; and then he  told them he was only bruised, having had a dreadful fall from his  horse Rozinante while he was fighting ten giants, the most outrageous  and audacious upon the face of the earth. \"Ho, ho!\" cried the curate,  \"are there giants too in the dance? nay, then, we will have them all  burnt by to-morrow night.\" Then they asked the Don a thousand  questions, but to every one he made no other answer, but that they  should give him something to eat, and then leave him to his repose.  They complied with his desires; and then the curate informed himself  at large in what condition the countryman had found him; and having  had a full account of every particular, as also of the knight's  extravagant talk, both when the fellow found him, and as he brought  him home, this increased the curate's desire of effecting what he had  resolved to do next morning: at which time he called upon his friend,  Mr. Nicholas the barber, and went with him to Don Quixote's house.          CHAPTER VI.    _Of the pleasant and curious scrutiny which the Curate and the Barber  made of the library of our ingenious gentleman._      The knight was yet asleep, when the curate came, attended by the  barber, and desired his niece to let him have the key of the room  where her uncle kept his books, the author of his woes: she readily  consented; and so in they went, and the housekeeper with them. There  they found above an hundred large volumes neatly bound, and a good  number of small ones. As soon as the housekeeper had spied them out,  she ran out of the study, and returned immediately with a holy-water  pot and a sprinkler: \"Here, doctor,\" cried she, \"pray sprinkle every  cranny and corner in the room, lest there should lurk in it some one  of the many sorcerers these books swarm with, who might chance to  bewitch us, for the ill-will we bear them, in going about to send them  out of the world.\" The curate could not forbear smiling at the good  woman's simplicity; and desired the barber to reach him the books one  by one, that he might peruse the title-pages, for perhaps he might  find some among them that might not deserve this fate. \"Oh, by no  means,\" cried the niece; \"spare none of them; they all help, somehow  or other, to crack my uncle's brain. I fancy we had best throw them  all out at the window in the yard, and lay them together in a heap,  and then set them on fire, or else carry them into the back-yard, and  there make a pile of them, and burn them, and so the smoke will offend  nobody.\" The housekeeper joined with her, so eagerly bent were both  upon the destruction of those poor innocents; but the curate would not  condescend to those irregular proceedings, and resolved first to read  at least the title-page of every book.    The first that Mr. Nicholas put into his hands was Amadis de Gaul, in  four volumes. \"There seems to be some mystery in this book's being the  first taken down,\" cried the curate, as soon as he had looked upon it;  \"for I have heard it is the first book of knight-errantry that ever  was printed in Spain, and the model of all the rest; and therefore I  am of opinion, that, as the first teacher and author of so pernicious  a sect, it ought to be condemned to the fire without mercy.\" \"I beg a  reprieve for him,\" cried the barber; \"for I have been told 'tis the  best book that has been written in that kind; and therefore, as the  only good thing of that sort, it may deserve a pardon.\" \"Well then,\"  replied the curate, \"for this time let him have it. Let's see that  other, which lies next to him.\" \"These,\" said the barber, \"are the  exploits of Esplandian, the son of Amadis de Gaul.\" \"Verily,\" said the  curate, \"the father's goodness shall not"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/360"],[0,"What is Property? An Inquiry into the Principle of Right and of Government (#12)"],[1," of thought. But having made God in his own image, man wished  to appropriate him still farther; not satisfied with disfiguring the  Almighty, he treated him as his patrimony, his goods, his possessions.  God, pictured in monstrous forms, became throughout the world the  property of man and of the State. Such was the origin of the corruption  of morals by religion, and the source of pious feuds and holy wars.  Thank Heaven! we have learned to allow every one his own beliefs; we  seek for moral laws outside the pale of religion. Instead of legislating  as to the nature and attributes of God, the dogmas of theology, and  the destiny of our souls, we wisely wait for science to tell us what to  reject and what to accept. God, soul, religion,--eternal objects of  our unwearied thought and our most fatal aberrations, terrible  problems whose solution, for ever attempted, for ever remains  unaccomplished,--concerning all these questions we may still be  mistaken, but at least our error is harmless. With liberty in religion,  and the separation of the spiritual from the temporal power, the  influence of religious ideas upon the progress of society is purely  negative; no law, no political or civil institution being founded on  religion. Neglect of duties imposed by religion may increase the general  corruption, but it is not the primary cause; it is only an auxiliary or  result. It is universally admitted, and especially in the matter  which now engages our attention, that the cause of the inequality  of conditions among men--of pauperism, of universal misery, and of  governmental embarrassments--can no longer be traced to religion: we  must go farther back, and dig still deeper.    But what is there in man older and deeper than the religious sentiment?    There is man himself; that is, volition and conscience, free-will and  law, eternally antagonistic. Man is at war with himself: why?    \"Man,\" say the theologians, \"transgressed in the beginning; our race  is guilty of an ancient offence. For this transgression humanity has  fallen; error and ignorance have become its sustenance. Read history,  you will find universal proof of this necessity for evil in the  permanent misery of nations. Man suffers and always will suffer; his  disease is hereditary and constitutional. Use palliatives, employ  emollients; there is no remedy.\"    Nor is this argument peculiar to the theologians; we find it  expressed in equivalent language in the philosophical writings of the  materialists, believers in infinite perfectibility. Destutt de Tracy  teaches formally that poverty, crime, and war are the inevitable  conditions of our social state; necessary evils, against which it would  be folly to revolt. So, call it NECESSITY OF EVIL or ORIGINAL DEPRAVITY,  it is at bottom the same philosophy.    \"The first man transgressed.\" If the votaries of the Bible interpreted  it faithfully, they would say: MAN ORIGINALLY TRANSGRESSED, that is,  made a mistake; for TO TRANSGRESS, TO FAIL, TO MAKE A MISTAKE, all mean  the same thing.    \"The consequences of Adam's transgression are inherited by the race;  the first is ignorance.\" Truly, the race, like the individual, is born  ignorant; but, in regard to a multitude of questions, even in the moral  and political spheres, this ignorance of the race has been dispelled:  who says that it will not depart altogether? Mankind makes continual  progress toward truth, and light ever triumphs over darkness. Our  disease is not, then, absolutely incurable, and the theory of the  theologians is worse than inadequate; it is ridiculous, since it is  reducible to this tautology: \"Man errs, because he errs.\" While the true  statement is this: \"Man errs, because he learns.\"    Now, if man arrives at a knowledge of all that he needs to know, it is  reasonable to believe that, ceasing to err, he will cease to suffer.    But if we question the doctors as to this law, said to be engraved upon  the heart of man, we shall immediately see that they dispute about a  matter of which they know nothing; that, concerning the most important  questions, there are almost as many opinions as authors; that we find  no two agreeing as to the best form of government, the principle of  authority, and the nature of right; that all sail hap-hazard upon a  shoreless and bottomless sea, abandoned to the guidance of their private  opinions which they modestly take to be right reason. And, in view  of this medley of contradictory opinions, we say: \"The object of our  investigations is the law, the determination of the social principle.  Now, the politicians, that is, the social scientists, do not understand  each other; then the error lies in themselves; and, as every error has  a reality for its object, we must look in their books to find the truth  which they have unconsciously deposited there.\"    Now, of what do the lawyers and the publicists treat? Of JUSTICE,  EQUITY, LIBERTY, NATURAL LAW, CIVIL LAWS, &c. But what is justice?  What is its principle, its character, its formula? To this question our  doctors evidently have no reply; for otherwise their science, starting  with a principle clear and well defined, would quit the region of  probabilities, and all disputes would end.    What is justice? The theologians answer: \"All justice comes from God.\"  That is true; but we know no more than before.    The philosophers ought to be better informed: they have argued so much  about justice and injustice! Unhappily, an examination proves that their  knowledge amounts to nothing, and that with them--as with the savages  whose every prayer to the sun is simply _O! O!_--it is a cry of  admiration, love, and enthusiasm; but who does not know that the sun  attaches little meaning to the interjection O! That is exactly our  position toward the philosophers in regard to justice. Justice, they  say, is a DAUGHTER OF HEAVEN; A LIGHT WHICH ILLUMINES EVERY MAN THAT  COMES INTO THE WORLD; THE MOST BEAUTIFUL PREROGATIVE OF OUR NATURE;  THAT WHICH DISTINGUISHES US FROM THE BEASTS AND LIKENS US TO GOD--and  a thousand other similar things. What, I ask, does this pious litany  amount to? To the prayer of the savages: O!    All the most reasonable teachings of human wisdom concerning justice are  summed up in that famous adage: DO UNTO OTHERS THAT WHICH YOU WOULD THAT  OTHERS SHOULD DO UNTO YOU; DO NOT UNTO OTHERS THAT WHICH YOU WOULD  NOT THAT OTHERS SHOULD DO UNTO YOU. But this rule of moral practice is  unscientific: what have I a right to wish that others should do or not  do to me? It is of no use to tell me that my duty is equal to my right,  unless I am told at the same time what my right is.    Let us try to arrive at something more precise and positive.    Justice is the central star which governs societies, the pole around  which the political world revolves, the principle and the regulator of  all transactions. Nothing takes place between men save in the name of  RIGHT; nothing without the invocation of justice. Justice is not the  work of the law: on the contrary, the law is only a declaration and  application of JUSTICE in all circumstances where men are liable to come  in contact. If, then, the idea that we form of justice and right were  ill-defined, if it were imperfect or even false, it is clear that all  our legislative applications would be wrong, our institutions vicious,  our politics erroneous: consequently there would be disorder and social  chaos.    This hypothesis of the perversion of justice in our minds, and, as a  necessary result, in our acts, becomes a demonstrated fact when it is  shown that the opinions of men have not borne a constant relation to the  notion of justice and its applications; that at different periods they  have undergone modifications: in a word, that there has been progress  in ideas. Now, that is what history proves by the most overwhelming  testimony.    Eighteen Hundred years ago, the world, under the rule of the Caesars,  exhausted itself in slavery, superstition, and voluptuousness. The  people--intoxicated and, as it were, stupefied by their long-continued  orgies--had lost the very notion of right and duty: war and dissipation  by turns swept them away; usury and the labor of machines (that is of  slaves), by depriving them of the means of subsistence, hindered them  from continuing the species. Barbarism sprang up again, in a hideous  form, from this mass of corruption, and spread like a devouring leprosy  over the depopulated provinces. The wise foresaw the downfall of the  empire, but could devise no remedy. What could they think indeed? To  save this old society it would have been necessary to change the objects  of public esteem and veneration, and to abolish the rights affirmed by  a justice purely secular; they said: \"Rome has conquered through her  politics and her gods; any change in theology and public opinion would  be folly and sacrilege. Rome, merciful toward conquered nations, though  binding them in chains, spared their lives; slaves are the most fertile  source of her wealth; freedom of the nations would be the negation of  her rights and the ruin of her finances. Rome, in fact, enveloped in the  pleasures and gorged with the spoils of the universe, is kept alive by  victory and government; her luxury and her pleasures are the price of  her conquests: she can neither abdicate nor dispossess herself.\"  Thus Rome had the facts and the law on her side. Her pretensions were  justified by universal custom and the law of nations. Her institutions  were based upon idolatry in religion, slavery in the State, and  epicurism in private life; to touch those was to shake society to its  foundations, and, to use our modern expression, to open the abyss of  revolutions. So the idea occurred to no one; and yet humanity was dying  in blood and luxury.    All at once a man appeared, calling himself The Word of God. It is not  known to this day who he was, whence he came, nor what suggested to  him his "]]]
