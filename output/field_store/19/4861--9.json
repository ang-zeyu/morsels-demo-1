Now, an experienced breeder, Mr. J. Beasley, of      Northamptonshire,[92] crossed some carefully selected West Highland      cows with purely-bred shorthorn bulls. The bulls were red, red and      white, or dark roan; and the Highland cows were all of a red colour,      inclining to a light or yellow shade. But a considerable number of the      offspring--and Mr. Beasley calls attention to this as a remarkable      fact--were white, or white with red ears. Bearing in mind that none of      the parents were white, and that they were purely-bred animals, it is      highly probable that here the offspring reverted, in consequence of the      cross, to the colour either of the aboriginal parent-species or of some      ancient and half-wild parent-breed. The following case, perhaps, comes      under the same head: cows in their natural state have their udders but      little developed, and do not yield nearly so much milk as our      domesticated animals. Now there is some reason to believe[93] that      cross-bred animals between two kinds, both of which are good milkers,      such as Alderneys and Shorthorns, often turn out worthless in this      respect.        In the chapter on the Horse reasons were assigned for believing that      the primitive stock was striped and dun-coloured; and details were      given, showing that in all parts of the world stripes of a dark colour      frequently appear along the spine, across the legs, and on the      shoulders, where they are occasionally double or treble, and even      sometimes on the face and body of horses of all breeds and of all      colours. But the stripes appear most frequently on the various kinds of      duns. They may sometimes plainly be seen on foals, and subsequently      disappear. The dun-colour and the stripes are strongly transmitted when      a horse thus characterised is crossed with any other; but I was not      able to prove that striped duns are generally produced from the      crossing of two distinct breeds, neither of which are duns, though this      does sometimes occur.        The legs of the ass are often striped, and this may be considered as a      reversion to the wild parent-form, the _Asinus taeniopus_ of      Abyssinia,[94] which is thus striped. In the domestic animal the      stripes on the shoulder are occasionally double, or forked at the      extremity, as in certain zebrine {42} species. There is reason to      believe that the foal is frequently more plainly striped on the legs      than the adult animal. As with the horse, I have not acquired any      distinct evidence that the crossing of differently-coloured varieties      of the ass brings out the stripes.        But now let us turn to the result of crossing the horse and ass.      Although mules are not nearly so numerous in England as asses, I have      seen a much greater number with striped legs, and with the stripes far      more conspicuous than in either parent-form. Such mules are generally      light-coloured, and might be called fallow-duns. The shoulder-stripe in      one instance was deeply forked at the extremity, and in another      instance was double, though united in the middle. Mr. Martin gives a      figure of a Spanish mule with strong zebra-like marks on its legs,[95]      and remarks, that mules are particularly liable to be thus striped on      their legs. In South America, according to Roulin,[96] such stripes are      more frequent and conspicuous in the mule than in the ass. In the      United States, Mr. Gosse,[97] speaking of these animals, says, \"that in      a great number, perhaps in nine out of every ten, the legs are banded      with transverse dark stripes.\"        Many years ago I saw in the Zoological Gardens a curious triple hybrid,      from a bay mare, by a hybrid from a male ass and female zebra. This      animal when old had hardly any stripes; but I was assured by the      superintendent, that when young it had shoulder-stripes, and faint      stripes on its flanks and legs. I mention this case more especially as      an instance of the stripes being much plainer during youth than in old      age.        As the zebra has such conspicuously striped legs, it might have been      expected that the hybrids from this animal and the common ass would      have had their legs in some degree striped; but it appears from the      figures given in Dr. Gray's 'Knowsley Gleanings,' and still more      plainly from that given by Geoffroy and F. Cuvier,[98] that the legs      are much more conspicuously striped than the rest of the body; and this      fact is intelligible only on the belief that the ass aids in giving,      through the power of reversion, this character to its hybrid offspring.        The quagga is banded over the whole front part of its body like a      zebra, but has no stripes on its legs, or mere traces of them. But in      the famous hybrid bred by Lord Morton,[99] from a chesnut, nearly      purely-bred, Arabian mare, by a male quagga, the stripes were \"more      strongly defined and darker than those on the legs of the quagga.\" The      mare was subsequently put to a black Arabian horse, and bore two colts,      both of which, as formerly stated, were plainly striped on the legs,      and one of them likewise had stripes on the neck and body.        The _Asinus Indicus_[100] is characterised by a spinal stripe, without      shoulder {43} or leg stripes; but traces of these latter stripes may      occasionally be seen even in the adult;[101] and Colonel S. Poole, who      has had ample opportunities for observation, informs me that in the      foal, when first born, the head and legs are often striped, but the      shoulder-stripe is not so distinct as in the domestic ass; all these      stripes, excepting that along the spine, soon disappear. Now a hybrid,      raised at Knowsley[102] from a female of this species by a male      domestic ass, had all four legs transversely and conspicuously striped,      had three short stripes on each shoulder, and had even some zebra-like      stripes on its face! Dr. Gray informs me that he has seen a second      hybrid of the same parentage similarly striped.    From these facts we see that the crossing of the several equine species  tends in a marked manner to cause stripes to appear on various parts of the  body, especially on the legs. As we do not know whether the primordial  parent of the genus was striped, the appearance of the stripes can only  hypothetically be attributed to reversion. But most persons, after  considering the many undoubted cases of variously coloured marks  reappearing by reversion in crossed pigeons, fowls, ducks, &c., will come  to the same conclusion with respect to the horse-genus; and in this case we  must admit that the progenitor of the group was striped on the legs,  shoulders, face, and probably over the whole body, like a zebra. If we  reject this view, the frequent and almost regular appearance of stripes in  the several foregoing hybrids is left without any explanation.           *       *       *       *       *    It would appear that with crossed animals a similar tendency to the  recovery of lost characters holds good even with instincts. There are some  breeds of fowls which are called \"everlasting layers,\" because they have  lost the instinct of incubation; and so rare is it for them to incubate  that I have seen notices published in works on poultry, when hens of such  breeds have taken to sit.[103] Yet the aboriginal species was of course a  good incubator; for with birds in a state of nature hardly any {44}  instinct is so strong as this. Now, so many cases have been recorded of the  crossed offspring from two races, neither of which are incubators, becoming  first-rate sitters, that the reappearance of this instinct must be  attributed to reversion from crossing. One author goes so far as to say,  \"that a cross between two non-sitting varieties almost invariably produces  a mongrel that becomes broody, and sits with remarkable steadiness.\"[104]  Another author, after giving a striking example, remarks that the fact can  be explained only on the principle that \"two negatives make a positive.\" It  cannot, however, be maintained that hens produced from a cross between two  non-sitting breeds invariably recover their lost instinct, any more than  that crossed fowls or pigeons invariably recover the red or blue plumage of  their prototypes. I raised several chickens from a Polish hen by a Spanish  cock,--breeds which do not incubate,--and none of the young hens at first  recovered their instinct, and this appeared to afford a well-marked  exception to the foregoing rule; but one of these hens, the only one which  was preserved, in the third year sat well on her eggs and reared a brood of  chickens. So that here we have the appearance with advancing age of a  primitive instinct, in the same manner as we have seen that the red plumage  of the _Gallus bankiva_ is sometimes reacquired by crossed and purely-bred  fowls of various kinds as they grow old.    The parents of all our domesticated animals were of course aboriginally  wild in disposition; and when a domesticated species is crossed with a  distinct species, whether this is a domesticated or only tamed animal, the  hybrids are often wild {45} to such a degree, that the fact is intelligible  only on the principle that the cross has caused a partial return to the  primitive disposition.    The Earl of Powis formerly imported some thoroughly domesticated humped  cattle from India, and crossed them with English breeds, which belong to a  distinct species; and his agent remarked to me, without any question having  been"]]]
