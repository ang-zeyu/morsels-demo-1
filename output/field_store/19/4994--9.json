Retention of scutes in terrestrial emyids and in  testudinids is one of many specializations for existence on land.  Retention of scutes protects the shell of terrestrial chelonians  against wear. Some box turtles were observed to have several scutes of  the carapace in the process of exfoliation but no exfoliation was  observed on the plastron. Exfoliation ordinarily occurred on the  scutes of the carapace that were the least worn; the exfoliating  portion included the areola and the three or four oldest (first  formed) layers of the scute. The layer of scute exposed was smooth and  had yellow markings that were only slightly less distinct than those  on the portion that was exfoliating.    Wear on the shell of a box turtle reduces the thickness of scutes, as  does the shedding of scutes in the aquatic emyids mentioned. It is  noteworthy that any of the layers in the scute of a box turtle can  form the cornified surface of the scute when the layers above it wear  away or are shed.    It is uncertain whether turtles that have ceased to grow at a  measurable rate continue to elaborate a new layer of epidermis at the  beginning of each season. Greatly worn shells of ornate box turtles,  particularly those of the subspecies _luteola_, have only a thin layer  of epidermis through which the bones of the shell and the sutures  between the bones are visible. I suspect that, in these old  individuals, the germinal layer of the epidermis does not become  active each year but retains the capacity to elaborate new epidermis  if the shell becomes worn thin enough to expose and endanger the bone  beneath it. The germinal layer of old turtles loses the capacity to  produce color.    Major growth-rings constitute a valuable and accurate history of  growth that can be studied at any time in the life of the turtle if  they have not been obliterated. They are accurate indicators of age  only as long as regular growth continues but may be used to study  early years of growth even in turtles that are no longer growing.  Minor growth-rings, if properly interpreted, provide additional  information on growing conditions in the course of each growing  season.    Nichols (1939a: 16-17) found that the number of growth-rings formed in  marked individuals of _T. carolina_ did not correspond to the number  of growing seasons elapsed; he concluded that growth-rings were  unreliable as indicators of age and that box turtles frequently  skipped seasons of growth. Woodbury and Hardy (1948:166-167) and  Miller (1955:114) came to approximately the same conclusion concerning  _Gopherus agassizi_. It is significant that these workers were  studying turtles of all sizes and ages, some of which were past the  age of regular, annual growth. Cagle's review of the literature  concerning growth-rings in turtles (1946) suggests that, in most of  the species studied, growth-rings are formed regularly in individuals  that have not attained sexual maturity but are formed irregularly  after puberty.    Cagle's (_op. cit._) careful studies of free-living populations of  _Pseudemys scripta_ showed that growth-rings, once formed, did not  change in size, that the area between any two major growth-rings  represented one season of growth, and that growth-rings were reliable  indicators of age as long as the impression of the areola remained on  the scutes studied. Cagle noted decreasing distinctness of  growth-rings after each molt.    The relative lengths of the abdominal lamina and the plastron remain  approximately the same throughout life in _T. ornata_. Measurements  were made of the plastron, carapace, and abdominal lamina in 103  specimens of _T. o. ornata_ from Kansas and neighboring states. The  series of specimens was divided into five nearly equal groups  according to length of carapace. Table 3 summarizes the relationship  of abdominal length to plastral length, and of carapace length to  plastral length. The mathematical mean of the ratio, abdominal  length/plastral length, in each of the four groups of larger-sized  turtles, was not significantly different from the same ratio in the  hatchling group. The relative lengths of carapace and plastron are not  so constant; the carapace is usually longer than the plastron in  hatchlings and juveniles, but shorter than the plastron in adults,  especially adult females.

The Relative Lengths of      Abdominal Scute and Plastron are not Significantly Different in      the Five Groups. The Plastron Tends to be Longer than the      Carapace in Specimens of Adult or Nearly Adult Size.   ===============+=========+===========================+==================                  |         |   Length of abdominal     |Individuals having                  |         |   as a percentage of      | plastron longer     LENGTH       | Number  |   length of plastron      |  than carapace   OF CARAPACE    |   of    |                           |                  |specimens|----------------+----------+------+-----------                  |         |Mean A+-[sigma]m  | Extremes |Number|Percentage   ---------------+---------+----------------+----------+------+-----------   Less than      |         |                |          |      |     50 mm.       |   23    |  18.3A+-.498     |13.7-20.3 |   7  |   38.5    (Juveniles)   |         |                |          |      |   ---------------+---------+----------------+----------+------+-----------   50 to 69 mm.   |   20    |  17.8A+-.303     |15.2-20.2 |   8  |   40.0    (Juveniles)   |         |                |          |      |   ---------------+---------+----------------+----------+------+-----------   70 to 100 mm.  |   20    |  17.9A+-.445     |14.3-20.6 |  15  |   75.0    (Subadults)   |         |                |          |      |   ---------------+---------+----------------+----------+------+-----------   More than      |         |                |          |      |     100 mm.      |   20    |  17.8A+-.236     |16.4-20.6 |  13  |   65.0    (Adult males) |         |                |          |      |   ---------------+---------+----------------+----------+------+-----------   More than      |         |                |          |      |     100 mm.      |   20    |  18.8A+-.510     |15.1-25.7 |  19  |   95.0   (Adult females)|         |                |          |      |   ---------------+---------+----------------+----------+------+-----------      The length of any growth-ring on the abdominal lamina can be used to  determine the approximate length of the plastron at the time the  growth-ring was formed. Actual and relative increases in length of the  plastron can be determined in a like manner. For example, a  seven-year-old juvenile (KU 3283) with a plastron 74.0 millimeters  long had abdominal growth-rings (beginning with areola and ending with  the actual length of the abdominal) 5.9, 7.8, 9.5, 10.7, 12.0, 12.5,  14.3, and 14.9 millimeters long. Using the                [AB   ABA¹]  proportion, [-- = -- ], where AB is the abdominal length, PL the              [PL    X ]    plastral length, ABA¹ the length of any given growth-ring, and X the  plastral length at the time growth-ring ABA¹ was formed, the plastral  length of this individual was 29.3 millimeters at hatching, 38.8 at  the end of the first full season of growth, and 47.2, 53.2, 59.6,  62.1, and 71.0 millimeters at the end of the first, second, third,  fourth, fifth, and sixth seasons of growth, respectively. The present  length of the abdominal (14.9 mm.) indicates an increment of three  millimeters in plastral length in the seventh season, up to the time  the turtle was killed (June 25). This method of studying growth in  turtles was first used by Sergeev (1937) and later more extensively  used by Cagle (1946 and 1948) in his researches on _Pseudemys  scripta_. Because the plastron is curved, no straight-line measurement  of it or its parts can express true length. Cagle (1946 and 1948)  minimized error by expressing plastral length as the sum of the  laminal (or growth-ring) lengths. This method was not possible in the  present study because growth-rings on parts of one or more laminae  (chiefly the gulars and anals) were usually obliterated by wear, even  in young specimens. It was necessary to express plastral length as the  sum of the lengths of forelobe and hind lobe.    The abdominal lamina was selected for study because of its length  (second longest lamina of plastron), greater symmetry, and flattened  form. Although the abdominal is probably subject to greater, over-all  wear than any other lamina of the shell, wear is even, not localized  as it is on the gulars and anals.    In instances where some of the growth-rings on an abdominal lamina  were worn but other rings remained distinct, reference to other, less  worn lamina permitted a correct interpretation of indistinct rings.    Abdominal laminae were measured at the interlaminal seam; since the  laminae frequently did not meet perfectly along the midline (and were  of unequal length), the right abdominal was measured in all specimens.  Growth-rings on the abdominal laminae were measured in the manner  shown in Plate 22.    Data were obtained for an aggregate of 1272 seasons of growth in 154  specimens (67 females, 48 males, and 39 of undetermined sex, chiefly  juveniles). Averages of calculated plastral length were computed in  each year of growth for specimens of known sex (Figs. 9 and 10) and  again for all specimens examined. Annual increment in plastral length  was expressed as a percentage of plastral length at the end of the  previous growing season (Fig."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37595"],[0,"Ecological Studies of the Timber Wolf in Northeastern Minnesota (#12)"],[1,"does  not significantly distort the age composition of the [deer] kill in  relation to that of the corresponding wild population, except possibly  for buck seasons of only 1 or 2 days duration.... A reliable appraisal  of the age composition of the kill by hunting may be obtained through  the operation of roadside checking stations.\" However, in critically  reviewing the present paper Severinghaus stated that in States such as  Minnesota, with fewer hunters and higher hunter success rates, age  compositions of deer from checking stations may not be the same as  those of wild populations. Reviewers Peek and Downing also made similar  comments.    Nevertheless, for our comparison with wolf-killed deer it is not  necessary that the hunter-kill age structure be exactly representative  of the age structure of the actual deer population. All that is  required is that there be reasonable agreement between the two. The  hunting regulations in our study area allow a 9-day period of taking  deer of any age or sex, and a single hunter may legally shoot as many  deer as he and his party or associates have permits for. Thus there is  no reason for selective hunting, and we feel confident that the age  structure of the hunter-kill in our study area does basically represent  that of the deer herd at large.    Two laboratory techniques were used for determining the ages of deer  from the lower jaws or mandibles--a tooth replacement and wear  technique (Severinghaus 1949) and an incisor-sectioning method (Gilbert  1966). The tooth-wear technique requires only the molariform teeth but  it is more subjective and inaccurate, particularly in older deer (Ryel  _et al._ 1961). Incisor sectioning requires only incisors and appears  to be much more accurate.    However, because the incisors had been lost from many of the  wolf-kills, and because the tooth-wear technique was used at checking  stations, both methods were applied in the laboratory. Mr. David W.  Kuehn (1970) sectioned and aged the incisors. Fortunately there was a  sufficiently large sample of mandibles with molariform teeth and  incisors from both wolf-killed and hunter-killed deer to enable us to  devise a table showing the actual ages (based on incisor-sectioning) of  each of the jaws assigned to various tooth-wear classes. This table was  then used to distribute the ages of specimens that contained only  molariform teeth. For example, because it was found that 37 percent of  the jaws aged 4-1/2 years old by tooth wear were actually 5-1/2 years  old, we assigned 37 percent of the incisorless jaws aged 4-1/2 by tooth  wear to the 5-1/2-year category. Similarly, another conversion chart  comparing field age determinations of hunter-killed deer with ages  based on incisor sectioning of the same jaws was employed to distribute  the ages of field-aged, hunter-killed deer for which jaws or incisors  could not be collected.      RESULTS    We flew a total of 480 hours during this and related research, mainly  during January through March 1967 and December 1968 through March 1969;  about one-third of this time was devoted primarily to searching for  kills. Jaws were examined from 93 wolf-kills and 49 probable  wolf-kills.    [Illustration: _Figure 6.--All hunter-killed deer examined were checked  for age. (Photo courtesy of L. D. Frenzel.)_]    Hunter-check stations yielded information from 335 deer (fig. 6), and  data on 98 additional hunter-killed deer were contributed by other  hunters. Incisors were collected from 82 of 214 hunter-killed deer  checked that were older than yearlings; comparisons were then made  between ages of the deer based on incisor sectioning and those based on  field checks using the wear method. Similarly, incisors were sectioned  from 195 wolf-killed and hunter-killed deer older than yearlings that  had been aged by the tooth-wear method in the laboratory, so that these  two methods could be compared (Kuehn 1970). (Note: incisor-sectioning  is unnecessary for fawns and yearlings because animals of these ages  can be aged objectively by the progress of tooth replacement.)    Because age or sex distributions might differ in the various subsamples  of deer examined during this study, these parameters were compared in  subsamples of both wolf-kills and hunter-kills (table 1). No  significant differences were found in the age or sex structures between  the known wolf-kills and \"probable\" wolf-kills, so these subsamples  were pooled and considered wolf-kills for all subsequent comparisons.    Three significant differences in sex ratio were found among the  subsamples of wolf-kills: (1) wolves killed more female fawns than male  fawns, but more male adults than female adults (table 2); (2) more of  the adults killed in the hunted area were females, while in the  wilderness more males were taken (table 3); and (3) after January 1969,  when snow was unusually deep, 57 percent of the deer killed were  females, compared with only 38 percent before this date.      _Table 1.--Results of statistical comparisons between various samples  of deer kills from northeastern Minnesota_    %: _percent_    ------:-----------:--:------:------------:--------------------:------------        :           :  :      :            :      Results of    :        :           :  :      :            :     comparisons:   :  Sample:           :  :Sample:            :--------------------: Direction  size  :Sample     :VS: size :Sample      : [20]Age  :[21]Sex  :    of        :description:  :      :description :structures:  ratios : difference  ------:-----------:--:------:------------:----------:---------:------------        Wolf-kills:[22]       Wolf-kills:[22]     93     Known          49    Probable      Nonsig.[23] Nonsig.     --     42     Jan.-Mar.      83    Dec. 1968-    Nonsig.
