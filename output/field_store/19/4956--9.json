[Illustration: Plate XVIII.--        (_a_) Brocade Bodice. 1770-85.      (_b_) Flowered Silk Dress. 1750-70.      (_c_) Silk Brocade Bodice. 1780-95.]    [Illustration: FIG. 79.--Period 1688-1702.]    Long round capes were still worn, without sleeves, and a collar turned  down about 4 inches.    Shoes of a similar shape to those of the later Charles II type were in  use, but the heels became larger and the toes not so long; the top of  the front was sometimes shaped and turned down. Heavy boots to the knee,  with large curved tops, were also in favour, as in the illustration  (Fig. 71).      SEVENTEENTH CENTURY. WILLIAM AND MARY. FEMALE.    The hair was now mounted high on top and the front parted with two  curls, the rest of the hair being bound on top, or a curl was arranged  on either shoulder. A goffered frill head-dress, set on a cap, rose very  high, and a long fall of lace, or lappets, came down on either side from  the cap, or was gathered in like a small hood at the back. Bare  shoulders now began to disappear, the bodice shape coming over the  shoulder to a =V= shape enclosing a stomacher, which was sometimes tabbed  or shaped at the point. Many dresses were made in one length, caught  together at the waist with a band; the fronts of these skirts were  looped back high up, creating a pannier-like fullness at the hips, and  narrow hoops came in to set out the skirts, many of which were heavily  embroidered with gold. The Watteau-back dress started in this reign; a  very early specimen, at the Victoria and Albert Museum, is most probably  of this time (Fig. 85, A). The sleeves worn to the elbow increased in  width from the shoulder, and were set with large narrow cuffs gathered  with a jewel or bow on the front of the arm. Hoods and cloaks of the  same character as described for the last reign continued, and light  sticks were carried by the ladies. Very pointed shoes were worn, with  large high heels, the top of the front flap in some being shaped into  points. Black masks were frequently used, some having long lace falls.  Rather small muffs were still the fashion, and beautifully decorated  short aprons became a feature with the dress.    [Illustration: FIG. 80.--1688-1698.]      SEVENTEENTH CENTURY. WILLIAM AND MARY. MALE.    Wigs of the same long character continued, and were parted in the centre  with a raised effect, and variously shaped caps, with turned-up fold or  brim, were worn when the wig was taken off.    The beaver or felt hat, turned up three-cornerwise, was now in general  use. It is often seen with the brims loose, or sometimes down,  especially amongst the lower classes. Both small shapes and large were  worn.    [Illustration: Plate XIX.--        (_a_) Silk Brocade Dress. 1775-85.      (_b_) Embroidered Silk Jacket. 1775-90.            _Pattern, see p. 326._      (_c_) Brocade Jacket. 1780-95.            _Cap pattern, see p. 331._            _Coat pattern, see p. 348._]    [Illustration: FIG. 81.--Period 1680-1690.]    Black ties across formal lace cravats, and long lawn cravats, edged with  lace, one end of which was sometimes caught up loosely through the  large buttonhole of the coat were worn. Waistcoats were left open well  down to the waist; some of these were nearly of the same length as the  coat, the skirt being often edged with deep gold fringe.    The coats were of much the same character as in the time of James II,  with buttons all down the front, but now it was the mode to button coats  just at the waist, allowing the waistcoat to be shown. The sleeves were  generally longer, to the middle of the forearm, and the turned-back  cuffs became very large and deep, often towards the end of the reign  taking a curved shape. The seams, fronts, and pockets were frequently  braided as before. A long square waistcoat of rich brocade or  embroidered material, about four inches shorter than the coat, was worn;  some of these had tight sleeves, which came to the wrist beneath the  outer coat-sleeve; otherwise a gathered lawn sleeve with ruffle was  worn.    Shoes and boots were practically the same as in the previous reign, with  larger high heels and a high square front, with latchets buckled or  stiffly tied, and very square toes. Top-boots of the same heavy  character continued as in Plate II (see p. 42). Stockings continued to  be worn frequently above the knee outside the breeches, with a garter  beneath, and beautifully embroidered clocks to the calf. Muffs were  carried by many men, and the gauntlets of gloves had a very angular  shape. Patches and make-up were used by the dandies, and the sword was  now carried through the side pleats on a waist-belt sometimes worn  outside the waistcoat.          CHAPTER VII    THE CHARACTER OF DECORATION AND TRIMMINGS OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY.      In the early part to the middle of this century the trimmings were  chiefly of gold or silver lace, real lace, and purfled silk, mostly of  the same material as the dress: a bow was often worn on the breast, and  also in the front of the sleeve cuff. Purfled or ruched trimming  generally ran down the front of the dress from the neck to the hem of  the skirt in the Second Georgian dress, and gathered borders or  decorations of curved forms were in use. The skirts usually had only one  flounce till the reign of George III, when the trimmings became more  elaborate, and gauze and imitation flowers were festooned upon the  skirts, with ribbons and tassels and padded designs standing out in  strong relief; some charming gimp trimmings are also seen.    The lace ruffles of a fan shape which finished the earlier sleeves till  about 1745 were sometimes of lace, interwoven with gold, silver, and  coloured silk needlework, and this was no doubt the forerunner of the  use of the more solid material itself. The setting of the sleeve finish  is interesting to note all through this period, for it was beautifully  treated in balancing the effect of the dress. The square cuff with the  deep lace fall was big in style, and the later closely-fitted elbow  piece, richly gathered, was happily conceived, but no finer setting  could have been applied to the sack-back dress than the large fan or  double fan with its lace fall. The edges of the early fan-finished  sleeves were of curved and scalloped forms, the latter shaping often  being seen in the later sleeves.    With George III we notice designs in straw work, decorations of  imitation flowers in ribbon-work and various materials, and much taste  in the choice of colour schemes, while the tassels of this period were  delightful creations. The designs of stuffs at the early part of the  century were generally of fine strong colour blends, but in the middle  period there was much questionable taste displayed in the heavy massing  of patterns, but this soon improved with the striped character crossed  by running flowers which was quite ideal in type for costume keeping,  grace, and lightness, with a beautiful interchange of colour.    The quilted silk and satin petticoats are a special feature to note in  these times; many simple and effective designs were in use, and they  added much glitter to the scheme. Aprons were also beautiful examples of  needlework, and were worn with the best of dresses to the middle of the  century; the earlier ones generally had a scalloped edging, and many had  pockets; gold lace edging or fringe was often used in the time of George  II, and they were all finely decorated with needlework in gold, silver,  or coloured silks. The white aprons were also of consummate needlecraft,  and hanging pockets worn at the sides were also a decorated feature, but  these only showed when the dress was worn tucked up. The later style of  dress became much simpler, consisting chiefly of gathered flounce  settings, fichus, and large mob caps; these were often daintily  embroidered with tambour work and large bow and sash settings, making  delightful costumes.    Bags, muffs, gloves, and shoes were all chosen for the display of  needlecraft, while artists and jewellers used all their skill on the  fans, patch-boxes, and etuis, and even the dress materials were often  painted by hand, while many painted Chinese silks were also utilised.      EIGHTEENTH CENTURY. ANNE. FEMALE.    The hair was dressed in a simple manner, with two curls parted from the  centre of the forehead, and curved inwards on the brow. A loose ringlet  or two were brought on to the left shoulder, the rest being gathered  into a back-knot. Feathers or flowers were arranged on top, generally  with a pair of lace lappets falling to the back; these also adorned the  cap, which still bore the front goffered frills set out as in the last  reign, but these were diminished in size and were mostly of one row. We  note probably the last stage of this style appearing in a print of  Hogarth's, dated 1740.    [Illustration: FIG. 82.--Bodice types. Period 1690-1720.]    [Illustration: FIG. 83.--Costume type. 1695-1710.]    Hoods and capes or cloaks, and long black fichus or wraps, were the  chief coverings, as the head-dress did not allow of hats being worn, but  with the small frilled caps a little straw hat, or a low-crowned felt  with a largish brim, are seen, and a small lace frill round the neck  began to appear. Bodices with a low curved neck often had a short skirt  or shaped pieces, as well as a shaped short sleeve over a gathered lawn  one, while many wore long sleeves to the wrist, and a waistbelt is  sometimes noted. There was also the sleeve spreading in width to the  elbow, with a turned-up square cuff. The front of the bodice may be  remarked with bands fastening across, and this became a feature in many  dresses later in this century, otherwise it set closely over the  shoulders to a =V= shape at the waist, and was filled with a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34984"],[0,"A Guide for the Study of Animals (#12)"],[1,"aspect.    b. An earthworm, ventral aspect.    c. An outline diagram of a cross section, to show the location of the  setae, the blood vessels and the alimentary canal.      Internal Morphology or Anatomy          _Materials._    (1) Preserved earthworms, as large as you can obtain. (2) Cross  sections of earthworms. (3) Longitudinal sections of earthworms.          _Definitions._    _Body cavity_, the space between the body wall and the alimentary  canal.    _Septa_ (singular, _septum_), the thin walls between somites, seen  when the worm is opened.    _Pharynx_, the hard-walled, rather bulbous, anterior portion of the  alimentary canal.    _Esophagus_, the portion of the alimentary canal extending back from  the pharynx with thinner walls and smaller diameter.    _Crop_, the short, wide portion of the canal back of the esophagus.    _Gizzard_, the hard-walled, short region, just back of the crop.    _Stomach-intestine_, the portion of the canal reaching from the  gizzard to the anus.    _Ventral nerve cord_, a light-colored thread lying against the inner  surface of the ventral body wall.    _Nerve ganglia_ (singular, _ganglion_), slight swellings on the  ventral nerve cord.    _Nerve ring_ or _collar_, a pair of nerves extending from the ventral  nerve cord around the pharynx to a pair of ganglia (often called the  \"brain\") in the dorsal region of the anterior end.    _Kidney tubes_ or _nephridia_, the excretory organs of the earthworm,  occurring as slender, paired tubes in nearly every somite.          _Directions._    Select a large worm and cut carefully through the body wall along one  side, midway between the dorsal and ventral surfaces, from the  anterior end to the posterior. Lay the worm on any convenient fairly  soft surface (a piece of pine, cork, peat, paraffin), preferably  under water, and pin out the walls so that you can see into the  interior.    Identify the structures defined above, as well as the dorsal and  ventral blood vessels and the \"hearts.\"    The nephridia are not easily distinguished, though they are very  numerous. They are long, slender, coiled tubes, two in each somite,  lying in the body cavity, one on each side of the alimentary canal.  If possible, identify them.    Notice that most of the internal organs are free from the body wall,  lying free in the body cavity.          _Questions._    1. What is the extent of the body cavity, anteriorly and posteriorly?  What is its shape?    2. What, in general, is the shape of the food canal? How many  external openings has it?    3. Into what regions is the food canal differentiated? Suggest one  advantage of having these specialized regions.    4. How is the alimentary canal of the worm kept away from the body  walls? Why have it thus supported?    5. What is a septum? How many septa are there? What vessels and tubes  pass through a septum?    6. Locate the nerve cord. How long is it? How frequently do the  ganglia occur on it? Which end of the living worm is the more  sensitive. Suggest the connection between this fact and the location  of ganglia.          _Suggested drawings._    a. Earthworm, showing structures mentioned in this study.      Details of Structure--Microscopic Anatomy          _Materials._    Sections of earthworms, preferably both cross sections and  dorso-ventral, longitudinal ones.          _Directions._    In a section under a simple lens, identify the dorsal and ventral  surfaces, the body wall, the body cavity, the alimentary canal, and,  if possible, the dorsal and ventral blood vessels and the ventral  nerve cord.    Under a microscope identify the same structures. Notice that the body  wall consists of three layers of cells: an outer single layer, the  _epidermis_; a middle layer, the _circular muscles_; and an inner  one, the _longitudinal muscles_.    The nephridia show as loosely scattered fragments in the body cavity,  at the right and left of the alimentary canal.    If you happen to have a section which shows one or more setae,  identify the muscles which operate it, and the group of glandular  cells at its inner end, which are known as _setigerous_ (from _seta_)  cells.          _Questions._    1. Describe the epidermal cells. What is their probable function?  Among them notice larger cells, clear and rounded. These are the  _mucous_ (slime) cells.      What is the use of mucus to the worm?    2. Describe the muscle cells. In which direction do the muscle fibers  extend? What is their function? Which layer of muscle cells is  thicker, the circular or the longitudinal? Why should it be?    3. Notice the cells in the walls of the alimentary canal. What layers  do you find? How are they arranged?    4. If the section you are studying is a cross section from the region  back of the gizzard, the alimentary canal will look horseshoe shaped,  indented from the dorsal surface. What is the effect of this  indentation upon the amount of surface in the alimentary canal?    5. Study the cells of the nerve cord. How do they compare in size and  shape with the muscle cells?          _Suggested drawings._    a. A diagram of a cross section, showing the relation of the organs.    b. A diagram of a longitudinal section, at least through the body wall,  to show the arrangement of muscle fibers.    c. A drawing of a portion of the body wall, to show details.

Comparative Study of Worms          _Materials._    As many different kinds of worms as you can get, living or dead.          _Directions._    Identify your specimens. Then study as many as your time will allow,  using these general questions for each:--          _Questions._    1. How large is the specimen and what is its shape?    2. Can you distinguish a head or a head end? If so, by what  peculiarities?    3. State whether the body is segmented or not, and, if it is, whether  the segments are alike in form and appearance, _i.e._ whether the  segments are uniform.    4. State whether the animal is bilaterally symmetrical, radially  symmetrical, or without symmetry.    5. Compare this worm with the earthworm as to sense organs.    6. What organs for respiration has it?    7. What special protective devices has it?    8. If possible, find out and state where this worm lives. What can  you see in the structure of this worm which enables it to live where  it does?      Summary of the Comparative Study of Worms      1. Name the different worms you have studied. What characteristics  have they in common?    2. What different methods of obtaining food do they show?    3. What variations do they show in senses? in sense organs?    4.

How great is their  effect estimated to be?    5. Give a brief sketch of the life of Charles Darwin, noting  especially the work he did with earthworms.      Why is Darwin's work on earthworms noteworthy: because it is such    a large proportion of the work he did, or because it is so much    of the work which has been done on earthworms?    6. How are earthworms protected against the cold of our winters? What  limits the northern range of earthworms?    7. Where are earthworms found geographically? Why are they so widely  distributed? By what means are they extended from one locality to  another?    8. How do earthworms reproduce? What care do they take of their  young?    9. What tissues or organs of earthworms correspond in function with  the ectoderm of hydra; with the endoderm? Why does an earthworm need  a system of blood circulation more than a hydra does?    10.

Contrast a cross section of hydra with one of earthworm as to the  number of cavities. Which seems to you the better plan? Why?    12. Why does a nereis need more respiratory surface than an earthworm  does?    13. Comparing earthworm and nereis, in what respects is the earthworm  degenerate? How does it manage to succeed so well with such a  degenerate body?    14. What is a parasite? How many hosts does a typical parasite  require for its development? Which host is known as the intermediate  one?    15. Trace the history of a tapeworm from the egg to the adult. At  what stage are they most likely to be destroyed? What provision is  there for this? What advantages are there to the host in the fact  that a tapeworm's egg cannot develop in the original host? What  advantages to the parasite?    16. What organs has a parasite lost, if it ever had them? How does it  succeed without them? What connection is there between parasitism and  degeneration?
