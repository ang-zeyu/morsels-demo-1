Congratulations, there's hope for the planet yet.\"    Meta glanced back and forth between them. \"I don't understand. I can't  believe it. I mean a new department--why?\"    \"I'm sorry,\" Kerk said. \"I didn't mean to be cruel. I thought perhaps  you might feel more at ease. What I said was true. Jason has a way--or  may have a way--to be of immense value to Pyrrus. Will you help him?\"    Meta had her composure back. And a little anger. \"Do I have to? Is that  an order? You know I have work to do. I'm sure you will realize it is  more important than something a person from _off-planet_ might imagine.  He can't really understand--\"    \"Yes. It's an order.\" The snap was back in Kerk's voice. Meta flushed at  the tone.    \"Perhaps I can explain,\" Jason broke in. \"After all the whole thing is  my idea. But first I would like your co-operation. Will you take the  clip out of your gun and give it to Kerk?\"    Meta looked frightened, but Kerk nodded in solemn agreement. \"Just for a  few minutes, Meta. I have my gun so you will be safe here. I think I  know what Jason has in mind, and from personal experience I'm afraid he  is right.\"    Reluctantly Meta passed over the clip and cleared the charge in the  gun's chamber. Only then did Jason explain.    \"I have a theory about life on Pyrrus, and I'm afraid I'll have to  shatter some illusions when I explain. To begin with, the fact must be  admitted that your people are slowly losing the war here and will  eventually be destroyed--\"    Before he was half through the sentence, Meta's gun was directed between  his eyes and she was wildly snapping the trigger. There was only hatred  and revulsion in her expression. Kerk took her by the shoulders and sat  her in his chair, before anything worse happened. It took a while before  she could calm down enough to listen to Jason's words. It is not easy to  have the carefully built-up falsehoods of a lifetime shattered. Only the  fact that she had seen something of other worlds enabled her to listen  at all.    The light of unreason was still in her eyes when he had finished,  telling her the things he and Kerk had discussed. She sat tensely,  pushed forward against Kerk's hands, as if they were the only things  that stopped her from leaping at Jason.    \"Maybe that is too much to assimilate at one sitting,\" Jason said. \"So  let's put it in simpler terms. I believe we can find a reason for this  unrelenting hatred of humans. Perhaps we don't smell right. Maybe I'll  find an essence of crushed Pyrran bugs that will render us immune when  we rub it in. I don't know yet. But whatever the results, we _must_ make  the investigation. Kerk agrees with me on that.\"    Meta looked at Kerk and he nodded agreement. Her shoulders slumped in  sudden defeat. She whispered the words.    \"I ... can't say I agree, or even understand all that you said. But I'll  help you. If Kerk thinks that it is the right thing.\"    \"I do,\" he said. \"Now, do you want the clip back for your gun? Not  planning to take any more shots at Jason?\"    \"That was foolish of me,\" she said coldly while she reloaded the gun. \"I  don't need a gun. If I had to kill him, I could do it with my bare  hands.\"    \"I love you, too,\" Jason smiled at her. \"Are you ready to go now?\"    \"Of course.\" She brushed a fluffy curl of hair into place. \"First we'll  find a place where you can stay. I'll take care of that. After that the  work of the new department is up to you.\"          X.      There were empty rooms in one of the computer buildings. These were  completely sealed to keep stray animal life out of the delicate  machinery. While Meta checked a bed-roll out of stores, Jason painfully  dragged a desk, table and chairs in from a nearby empty office. When she  returned with a pneumatic bed he instantly dropped on it with a grateful  sigh. Her lip curled a bit at his obvious weakness.    \"Get used to the sight,\" he said. \"I intend to do as much of my work as  I can, while maintaining a horizontal position. You will be my strong  right arm. And right now, Right Arm, I wish you could scare me up  something to eat. I also intend to do most of my eating in the  previously mentioned prone condition.\"    Snorting with disgust, Meta stamped out. While she was gone, Jason  chewed the end of a stylus thoughtfully, then made some careful notes.    After they had finished the almost-tasteless meal he began the search.    \"Meta, where can I find historical records of Pyrrus?\"    \"I've never heard of any ... I really don't know.\"    \"But there has to be something--_somewhere_,\" he insisted. \"Even if your  present-day culture devotes all of its time and energies to survival,  you can be sure it wasn't always that way. All the time it was  developing, people were keeping records, making notes. Now where do we  look? Do you have a library here?\"    \"Of course,\" she said. \"We have an excellent technical library. But I'm  sure there wouldn't be any of _that_ sort of thing there.\"    Trying not to groan, Jason stood up. \"Let me be the judge of that. Just  lead the way.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Operation of the library was completely automatic. A projected index  gave the call number for any text that had to be consulted. The tape  was delivered to the charge desk thirty seconds after the number had  been punched. Returned tapes were dropped through a hopper and refiled  automatically. The mechanism worked smoothly.    \"Wonderful,\" Jason said, pushing away from the index. \"A tribute to  technological ingenuity. Only it contains nothing of any value to us.  Just reams of textbooks.\"    \"What _else_ should be in a library?\" Meta sounded sincerely puzzled.    Jason started to explain, then changed his mind. \"Later we will go into  that,\" he said. \"Much later. Now we have to find a lead. Is it possible  that there are any tapes--or even printed books--that aren't filed  through this machine?\"    \"It seems unlikely, but we could ask Poli. He lives here somewhere and  is in charge of the library--filing new books and tending the  machinery.\"    The single door into the rear of the building was locked, and no amount  of pounding could rouse the caretaker.    \"If he's alive, this should do it,\" Jason said. He pressed the  out-of-order button on the control panel. It had the desired affect.  Within five minutes the door opened and Poli dragged himself through it.    Death usually came swiftly on Pyrrus. If wounds slowed a man down, the  ever-ready forces of destruction quickly finished the job. Poli was the  exception to this rule. Whatever had attacked him originally had done an  efficient job. Most of the lower part of his face was gone. His left arm  was curled and useless. The damage to his body and legs had left him  with the bare capability to stumble from one spot to the next.    Yet he still had one good arm as well as his eyesight. He could work in  the library and relieve a fully fit man. How long he had been dragging  the useless husk of a body around the building, no one knew. In spite of  the pain that filled his red-rimmed, moist eyes, he had stayed alive.  Growing old, older than any other Pyrran as far as Jason had seen. He  tottered forward and turned off the alarm that had called him.    When Jason started to explain the old man took no notice. Only after the  librarian had rummaged a hearing aid out of his clothes, did Jason  realize he was deaf as well. Jason explained again what he searched for.  Poli nodded and printed his answer on a tablet.    _there are many old books--in the storerooms below_    Most of the building was taken up by the robot filing and sorting  apparatus. They moved slowly through the banks of machinery, following  the crippled librarian to a barred door in the rear. He pointed to it.  While Jason and Meta fought to open the age-incrusted bars, he wrote  another note on his tablet.    _not opened for many years, rats_    Jason's and Meta's guns appeared reflexively in their hands as they read  the message. Jason finished opening the door by himself. The two native  Pyrrans stood facing the opening gap. It was well they did. Jason could  never have handled what came through that door.    He didn't even open it for himself. Their sounds at the door must have  attracted all the vermin in the lower part of the building. Jason had  thrown the last bolt and started to pull on the handle--when the door  was _pushed_ open from the other side.           *       *       *       *       *    Open the gateway to hell and see what comes out. Meta and Poli stood  shoulder to shoulder firing into the mass of loathsomeness that boiled  through the door. Jason jumped to one side and picked off the occasional  animal that came his way. The destruction seemed to go on forever.    Long minutes passed before the last clawed beast made its death rush.  Meta and Poli waited expectantly for more, they were happily excited by  this chance to deal destruction. Jason felt a little sick after the  silent ferocious attack. A ferocity that the Pyrrans reflected. He saw a  scratch on Meta's face where one of the beasts had caught her. She  seemed oblivious to it.    Pulling out his medikit, Jason circled the piled bodies. Something  stirred in their midst and a crashing shot ploughed into it. Then he  reached the girl and pushed the analyzer probes against the scratch. The  machine clicked and Meta jumped as the antitoxin needle stabbed down.  She realized for the first time what Jason was doing.    \"Thank you,\" she said.    Poli had a powerful battery lamp and, by unspoken agreement, Jason  carried it. Crippled though he was, the old man was still a Pyrran when  it came to handling a gun. They slowly made their way down the  refuse-laden stairs.    \"What a stench,\" Jason grimaced.    At the foot of the stairs they looked around. There _had_ been books and  records there at one time. They had been systematically chewed, eaten  and destroyed for decades.    \""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28402"],[0,"The Sexual Life of the Child (#12)"],[1,"became confirmed,  until finally they became inborn. Others, however, assume that the  psychical characteristics by which the sexes are differentiated result  solely from individual differences in education. Stern believes that in  the case of one differential character, at least, he can prove that for  many centuries there has been no difference between the sexes in the  matter of education; this character is the capacity for drawing.  Kerschensteiner has studied the development of this gift, and considers  that his results have established beyond dispute that girls are greatly  inferior in this respect to boys of like age. Stern[17] points out that  there can be no question here of cultivation leading to a sexual  differentiation of faculty, since there is no attempt at a general and  systematic teaching of draughtsmanship to the members of one sex to the  exclusion of members of the other.    Without further discussing the question, to what extent in earlier  generations there has been any cultivation of psychical differences, I  believe that we are justified in asserting that at the present time the  sexual differentiation manifested in respect of quite a number of  psychical qualities is the result of direct inheritance. It would be  quite wrong to assume that all these differences arise in each  individual in consequence of education. It does, indeed, appear to me to  be true that inherited tendencies may be increased or diminished by  individual education; and further, that when the inherited tendency is  not a very powerful one, it may in this way even be suppressed.  Observations on animals which exhibit sexual differentiation very early  in life, also support the notion of the inherited character of certain  tendencies; for instance, the movements of male animals often differ  from those of the females of the same species.    We must not forget the frequent intimate association between structure  and function. This well-proved connexion would lead us _a priori_, from  the more powerful muscular development of boys, to infer the different  inclinations of the two sexes. Rough outdoor games and wrestling thus  correspond to the physical constitution of the boy. So, also, it is by  no means improbable that the little girl, whose pelvis and hips have  already begun to indicate by their development their adaptation for the  supreme functions of the sexually mature woman, should experience  obscurely a certain impulsion towards her predestined maternal  occupation, and that her inclinations and amusements should in this way  be determined. Many, indeed, and above all the extreme advocates of  women's rights, prefer to maintain that such sexually differentiated  inclinations result solely from differences in individual education: if  the boy has no enduring taste for dolls and cooking, this is because his  mother and others have told him, perhaps with mockery, that such  amusements are unsuited to a boy; whilst in a similar way the girl is  dissuaded from the rough sports of boyhood. Such an assumption is the  expression of that general psychological and educational tendency, which  ascribes to the activity of the will an overwhelmingly powerful  influence upon the development of the organs subserving the intellect,  and secondarily also upon that of the other organs of the body. By the  influence of the will, it is supposed by this school, certain  association-tracts in the brain are developed; or at least certain  tracts hitherto functionally inactive are rendered functionally active.  We cannot dispute the fact that in such a way the activity of the will  may, within certain limits, be effective, especially in cases in which  the inherited tendency thus counteracted is comparatively weak; but only  within certain limits. Thus we can understand how it is that in some  cases, by means of education, a child is impressed with characteristics  normally foreign to its sex; qualities and tendencies are thus developed  which ordinarily appear only in a child of the opposite sex. But even  though we must admit that the activity of the individual may operate in  this way, none the less are we compelled to assume that certain  tendencies are inborn. The failure of innumerable attempts to  counteract such inborn tendencies by means of education throws a strong  light upon the limitations of the activity of the individual will; and  the same must be said of a large number of other experiences.    It is, moreover, established beyond dispute that in certain cases, in  consequence of an inborn predisposition, contrary sexual inclinations  make their appearance, and that these represent a divergency from the  proper sexual characters. It is with these mental sexual differential  characters just as it is with the physical secondary sexual characters,  any of which may, on occasion, make their appearance in the wrong sex,  or may be wanting in the right one. We know that there exist women with  beards, masculine larynges, and a masculine type of thorax; and, on the  other hand, men with feminine mammae, feminine larynges, and a feminine  type of pelvis. Because we meet with such atypical instances, we are not  therefore justified in inferring that it is by a mere arbitrary sport of  nature that in the woman a great mammary development is normally  associated with the development of the ovaries, and that in man the  growth of the beard is associated with the development of the testicles.  But just as in these respects there are certain exceptions, whose origin  we are not always in a position to explain, so also are there  exceptional sexual associations in respect of the secondary psychical  sexual characters. Thus it comes to pass that many women exhibit  masculine tendencies, and many men exhibit feminine tendencies.  Unquestionably, the fact that psychical qualities, just as much as  physical characters, may occasionally make their appearance in the wrong  sex, does not invalidate the general truth of the statement that  sexually differentiated psychical tendencies are inborn.    Occasionally, indeed, even in late childhood, this psychical  differentiation is still but little marked. We must also bear in mind  the fact that in many instances the bodily development of the  girl--apart, of course, from the actual reproductive organs--differs but  little, even during the second period of childhood, from that of the  boy; and that in such cases the specific differentiation makes its first  appearance later than is usual. We find boys also who have entered upon  the period of youth (see p. 1) without exhibiting any trace of downy  growth upon the upper lip or the chin; in some, the first definite  growth of hair on the face may not occur until several years later. I  remember also that I have seen boys in whom during the period of puberal  development an enlargement of the mammae took place, going so far that it  was possible by pressure on the glands to expel fluid from the  mammillary ducts; at a more advanced age, however, this mammary growth  was arrested, and subsequently atrophy ensued.    But all these observations notwithstanding, the fact remains well  established that even in childhood notable sexual differences make their  appearance. Other observations, too, confirm this notion of sexual  differentiation--for example, pathological experiences.    There are some diseases to which women are especially liable, others  which occur by preference in men. To some extent, indeed, this is  explained by the special exposure of one sex or the other to certain  noxious influences. The neuroses that appear as the sequelae of injuries  are especially common in the male sex, because the occupations of men  expose them more than women to injuries of all kinds. Of such cases, of  course, we do not speak here. But there are some unquestionably  hereditary morbid tendencies which manifest themselves by preference in  one sex or the other, and such sexual predisposition shows itself even  in childhood. I propose to give instances of this; some quoted from  Moebius,[18] some from other authors, and some taken from my own personal  experience.    Chlorosis is a disease of feminine youth, but very often makes its  appearance in childhood, especially towards the end of the second period  of childhood, at this earlier age, also, attacking girls in preference  to boys. Haemophilia, on the other hand, and also certain hereditary  forms of muscular atrophy, occur chiefly in males, and this in early  childhood. Diabetes is principally a disease of adults, but occasionally  it is met with in children also; among adults, there is a considerable  preponderance of males affected with this disease when diabetes occurs  in childhood, the disease also exhibits a preference for the male sex,  although at this time the peculiar sex-incidence is less marked than in  later life. Congenital defects of the heart are commoner in boys, the  proportion obtained from a very large number of cases of this kind being  61.6 boys: 38.4 girls. Chorea (St. Vitus's dance) affects girls more  often than boys, the ratio in this case being 2.5 girls: 1 boy. In the  case of whooping cough, we find that two girls suffer for every one boy.  As regards circumscribed facial atrophy, which usually begins during  childhood, a preponderance of the disease in the female sex is also  noticeable. Hysteria was formerly regarded as a typically feminine  disease, and although this view has now been shown to be erroneous, the  fact remains that girls and women are far more often affected than boys  and men. As regards hysteria in childhood, Bruns[19] states that the  ratio of girls affected is to boys affected as 2:1. It is interesting to  note that in the earlier years of childhood, prior, that is to say, to  the age of nine years or thereabouts, no marked difference exists in the  sex incidence of hysteria, the cases being distributed in the  proportion, 55 per cent."]]]
