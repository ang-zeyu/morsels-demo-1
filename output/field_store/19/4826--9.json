The poor, bewildered family had hardly  time to think, before delirium and, perhaps, death stared them in the  face.    When Polly first heard it, by Phronsie's pattering downstairs and  screaming: \"Oh, Polly, Joey's dre-ad-ful sick, he is!\" she jumped right  up, and tore off the bandage.    \"Now, I will help mother! I will, so there!\" and in another minute she  would have been up in the sick room. But the first thing she knew, a  gentle but firm hand was laid upon hers; and she found herself back  again in the old rocking-chair, and listening to the Doctor's words  which were quite stern and decisive.    \"Now, I tell you,\" he said, \"you must not take off that bandage again;  do you know the consequences? You will be blind! and then you will be a  care to your mother all your life!\"    \"I shall be blind, anyway,\" said Polly, despairingly; \"so 'twon't make  any difference.\"    \"No; your eyes will come out of it all right, only I did hope,\" and the  good doctor's face fell--\"that the other two boys would escape; but,\"  and he brightened up at sight of Polly's forlorn visage--\"see you do  your part by keeping still.\"    But there came a day soon when everything was still around the once  happy little brown house--when only whispers were heard from white lips;  and thoughts were fearfully left unuttered.    On the morning of one of these days, when Mrs. Pepper felt she could not  exist an hour longer without sleep, kind Mrs. Beebe came to stay until  things were either better or worse.    Still the cloud hovered, dark and forbidding. At last, one afternoon,  when Polly was all alone, she could endure it no longer. She flung  herself down by the side of the old bed, and buried her face in the gay  patched bed-quilt.    \"Dear God,\" she said, \"make me willing to have anything,\" she  hesitated--\"yes, anything happen; to be blind forever, and to have Joey  sick, only make me good.\"    How long she staid there she never knew; for she fell asleep--the first  sleep she had had since Joey was taken sick. And little Mrs. Beebe  coming in found her thus.    \"Polly,\" the good woman said, leaning over her, \"you poor, pretty  creeter, you; I'm goin' to tell you somethin'--there, there, just to  think! Joel's goin' to get well!\"    \"Oh, Mrs. Beebe!\" cried Polly, tumbling over in a heap on the floor, her  face, as much as could be seen under the bandage, in a perfect glow, \"Is  he, really?\"    \"Yes, to be sure; the danger's all over now,\" said the little old lady,  inwardly thinking--\"If I hadn't a-come!\"    \"Well, then, the Lord wants him to,\" cried Polly, in rapture; \"don't he,  Mrs. Beebe?\"    \"To be sure--to be sure,\" repeated the kind friend, only half  understanding.    \"Well, I don't care about my eyes, then,\" cried Polly; and to Mrs.  Beebe's intense astonishment and dismay, she spun round and round in the  middle of the floor.    \"Oh, Polly, Polly!\" the little old lady cried, running up to her, \"do  stop! the doctor wouldn't let you! he wouldn't really, you know! it'll  all go to your eyes.\"    \"I don't care,\" repeated Polly, in the middle of a spin; but she  stopped obediently; \"seems as if I just as soon be blind as not; it's so  beautiful Joey's going to get well!\"          SUNSHINE AGAIN      But as Joel was smitten down suddenly, so he came up quickly, and his  hearty nature asserted itself by rapid strides toward returning health;  and one morning he astonished them all by turning over suddenly and  exclaiming:    \"I want something to eat!\"    \"Bless the Lord!\" cried Mrs. Pepper, \"now he's going to live!\"    \"But he mustn't eat,\" protested Mrs. Beebe, in great alarm, trotting for  the cup of gruel. \"Here, you pretty creeter you, here's something nice.\"  And she temptingly held the spoon over Joel's mouth; but with a grimace  he turned away.    \"Oh, I want something to eat! some gingerbread or some bread and  butter.\"    \"Dear me!\" ejaculated Mrs. Beebe. \"Gingerbread!\" Poor Mrs. Pepper saw  the hardest part of her trouble now before her, as she realized that the  returning appetite must be fed only on strengthening food; for where it  was to come from she couldn't tell.    \"The Lord only knows where we'll get it,\" she groaned within herself.    Yes, He knew. A rap at the door, and little David ran down to find the  cause.    \"Oh, mammy,\" he said, \"Mrs. Henderson sent it--see! see!\" And in the  greatest excitement he placed in her lap a basket that smelt savory and  nice even before it was opened. When it was opened, there lay a little  bird delicately roasted, and folded in a clean napkin; also a glass of  jelly, crimson and clear.    \"Oh, Joey,\" cried Mrs. Pepper, almost overwhelmed with joy, \"see what  Mrs. Henderson sent you! now you can eat fit for a king!\"    That little bird certainly performed its mission in life; for as Mrs.  Beebe said, \"It just touched the spot!\" and from that very moment Joel  improved so rapidly they could hardly believe their eyes.    \"Hoh! I haven't been sick!\" he cried on the third day, true to his  nature. \"Mammy, I want to get up.\"    \"Oh, dear, no! you mustn't, Joel,\" cried Mrs. Pepper in a fright,  running up to him as he was preparing to give the bedclothes a lusty  kick; \"you'll send 'em in.\"    \"Send what in?\" asked Joel, looking up at his mother in terror, as the  dreadful thought made him pause.    \"Why, the measles, Joey; they'll all go in if you get out.\"    \"How they goin' to get in again, I'd like to know?\" asked Joel, looking  at the little red spots on his hands in incredulity; say, ma!    \"Well, they will,\" said his mother, \"as you'll find to your sorrow if  you get out of bed.\"    \"Oh, dear,\" said Joel, beginning to whimper, as he drew into bed again,  \"when can I get up, mammy!\"    \"Oh, in a day or two,\" responded Mrs. Pepper, cheerfully; \"you're  getting on so finely you'll be as smart as a cricket! Shouldn't you  say he might get up in a day or two, Mrs. Beebe?\" she appealed to that  individual who was knitting away cheerily in the corner.    \"Well, if he keeps on as he's begun, I shouldn't know what to think,\"  replied Mrs. Beebe. \"It beats all how quick he's picked up. I never see  anything like it, I'm sure!\"    And as Mrs. Beebe was a great authority in sickness, the old, sunny  cheeriness began to creep into the brown house once more, and to bubble  over as of yore.    \"Seems as if 'twas just good to live,\" said Mrs. Pepper, thankfully  once, when her thoughts were too much for her. \"I don't believe I shall  ever care how poor we are,\" she continued, \"as long as we're together.\"    \"And that's just what the Lord meant, maybe,\" replied good Mrs. Beebe,  who was preparing to go home.    Joel kept the house in a perfect uproar all through his getting well.  Mrs. Pepper observed one day, when he had been more turbulent than  usual, that she was \"almost worn to a thread.\"    \"Twasn't anything to take care of you, Joe,\" she added, \"when you were  real sick, because then I knew where you were; but--well, you won't ever  have the measles again, I s'pose, and that's some comfort!\"    Little David, who had been nearly stunned by the sickness that had laid  aside his almost constant companion, could express his satisfaction and  joy in no other way than by running every third minute and begging to do  something for him. And Joel, who loved dearly to be waited on, improved  every opportunity that offered; which Mrs. Pepper observing, soon put a  stop to.    \"You'll run his legs off, Joel,\" at last she said, when he sent David  the third time down to the wood-pile for a stick of just the exact  thickness, and which the little messenger declared wasn't to be found.  \"Haven't you any mercy? You've kept him going all day, too,\" she added,  glancing at David's pale face.    \"Oh, mammy,\" panted David, \"don't; I love to go. Here Joe, is the best I  could find,\" handing him a nice smooth stick.    \"I know you do,\" said his mother; \"but Joe's getting better now, and he  must learn to spare you.\"    \"I don't want to spare folks,\" grumbled Joel, whittling away with  energy; \"I've been sick--real sick,\" he added, lifting his chubby face  to his mother to impress the fact.    \"I know you have,\" she cried, running to kiss her boy; \"but now, Joe,  you're most well. To-morrow I'm going to let you go down-stairs; what do  you think of that!\"    \"Hooray!\" screamed Joel, throwing away the stick and clapping his hands,  forgetting all about his serious illness, \"that'll be prime!\"    \"Aren't you too sick to go, Joey?\" asked Mrs. Pepper, mischievously.    \"No, I'm not sick,\" cried Joel, in the greatest alarm, fearful his  mother meant to take back the promise; \"I've never been sick. Oh, mammy!  you know you'll let me go, won't your?\"    \"I guess so,\" laughed his mother.    \"Come on, Phron,\" cried Joel, giving her a whirl.    David, who was too tired for active sport, sat on the floor and watched  them frolic in great delight.    \"Mammy,\" said he, edging up to her side as the sport went on, \"do you  know, I think it's just good--it's--oh, it's so frisky since Joe got  well, isn't it, mammy?\"    \"Yes, indeed,\" said Mrs. Pepper, giving him a radiant look in return for  his; \"and when Polly's around again with her two eyes all right--well, I  don't know what we shall do, I declare!\"    \"Boo!\" cried a voice, next morning, close to Polly's elbow, unmistakably  Joel's.    \"Oh, Joel Pepper!\" she cried, whirling around, \"is that really you!\"    \"Yes,\" cried that individual, confidently, \"it's I; oh, I say, Polly,  I've had fun up-stairs, I tell you what!\"    \"Poor boy!\" said Polly, compassionately.    \"I wasn't a poor boy,\" cried Joel, indignantly; \"I had splendid things  to eat; oh, my!\" and he closed one eye and smacked his lips in the  delightful memory.    \"I know it,\" said Polly, \"and I'm so glad, Joel.\"    \"I don't suppose I'll ever get so many again,\" observed Joel,  reflectively, after a minute's pause, as one and another of the wondrous  delicacies rose before"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27713"],[0,"The Elements of Bacteriological Technique (#12)"],[1,"rod, but  such a handle is vastly inferior to aluminium and is not to be  recommended.]    8. Two pairs of sharp-pointed spring forceps (10 cm. long), one of which  must be kept perfectly clean and reserved for handling clean  cover-slips, the other being for use during staining operations.    9. A box of clean 3 by 1 glass slips.    10. A glass capsule with tightly fitting (ground on) glass lid,  containing clean cover-slips in absolute alcohol.    11. One of Faber's \"grease pencils\" (yellow, red, or blue) for writing  on glass.    12. A wooden rack (Fig. 65) with twelve drop-bottles (Fig. 66) each 60  c.c. capacity, containing        Aniline water.        Gentian violet, saturated alcoholic solution.

[Illustration: FIG. 65.--Staining rack, rubber change mat and lysol  pot.]    [Illustration: FIG. 66.--Drop bottle.]    [Illustration: FIG. 67.--Canada balsam pot.]    And two pots with air-tight glass caps (Fig. 67), each provided with a  piece of glass rod and filled respectively with Canada balsam dissolved  in xylol, and sterile vaseline.      METHODS OF EXAMINATION.    Bacteria, etc., are examined microscopically.        1. In the living state, unstained, or stained.      2. In the \"fixed\" condition (i. e., fixed, killed,         and stained by suitable methods).    The preparation of a specimen from a tube cultivation for examination by  these methods may be described as follows:    ~1. Living, Unstained.~--(a) _\"Fresh\" Preparation._--    1. Clean and dry a 3 by 1 glass slip and place it on one of the squares  of filter paper. Deposit a drop of water (preferably distilled) or a  drop of 1 per cent. solution of caustic potash, on the centre of the  slip, by means of the platinum loop.    [Illustration: FIG. 68.--Holding tubes for removing bacterial growth, as  seen from the front.]         TECHNIQUE OF OPENING AND CLOSING A CULTURE TUBE.         2. Remove the tube cultivation from its rack or jar with the       left hand and ignite the cotton-wool plug by holding it to       the flame of the Bunsen burner. Extinguish the flame by       blowing on the plug, whilst rotating the tube on its long       axis, its mouth directed vertically upward, between the       thumb and fingers. (This operation is termed \"flaming the       plug,\" and is intended to destroy any micro-organisms that       may have become entangled in the loose fibres of the       cotton-wool, and which, if not thus destroyed, might fall       into the tube when the plug is removed and so accidentally       contaminate the cultivation.)         3. Hold the tube at or near its centre between the ends of       the thumb and first two fingers of the left hand, and allow       the sealed end to rest upon the back of the hand between the       thumb and forefinger, the plug pointing to the right. Keep       the tube as nearly in the horizontal position as is       consistent with safety, to diminish the risk of the       accidental entry of organisms (Fig. 68).         4. Take the handle of the loop between the thumb and       forefinger of the right hand, holding the instrument in a       position similar to that occupied by a pen or a paint-brush,       and sterilise the platinum portion by holding it in the       flame of a Bunsen burner until it is red hot. Sterilise the       adjacent portion of the aluminium handle by passing it       rapidly twice or thrice through the flame. After sterilising       it, the loop must not be allowed to leave the hand or to       touch against anything but the material it is intended to       examine, until it is finished with and has been again       sterilised.         5. Grasp the cotton-wool plug of the test-tube between the       little finger and the palm of the right hand (whilst still       holding the loop as directed in step 4), and remove it from       the mouth of the tube by a \"screwing\" motion of the right       hand.         6. Introduce the platinum loop into the tube and hold it in       this position until satisfied that it is quite cool. (The       cooling may be hastened by touching the loop on one of the       drops of moisture which are usually to be found condensed on       the interior of the glass tube, or by dipping it into the       condensation water at the bottom; at the same time care must       be taken in the case of cultures on solid media to avoid       touching either the medium or the growth.)         7. Remove a small portion of the growth by taking up a drop       of liquid, in the case of a fluid culture, in the loop; or       by touching the loop on the surface of the growth when the       culture is on solid medium; and withdraw the loop from the       tube without again touching the medium or the glass sides of       the tube.         8. Replace the cotton-wool plug in the mouth of the tube.    9. Replace the tube cultivation in its rack or jar.    10. Mix the contents of the loop thoroughly with the drop of water on  the 3 by 1 slide.    11. Again sterilise the loop as directed in step 4, and replace it in  its stand.    12. Remove a cover-slip from the glass capsule by means of the  cover-slip forceps, rest it for a moment on its edge, on a piece of  filter paper to remove the excess of alcohol, then pass it through the  flame of the Bunsen burner. This burns off the remainder of the alcohol,  and the cover-slip so \"flamed\" is now clean, dry, and sterile.    13. Lower the cover-slip, still held in the forceps, on to the surface  of the drop of fluid on the 3 by 1 slip, carefully and gently, to avoid  the inclusion of air bubbles.    14. Examine microscopically (_vide infra_).    During the microscopical examination, stains and other reagents may be  run in under a cover-slip by the simple method of placing a drop of the  reagent in contact with one edge of the cover-glass and applying the  torn edge of a piece of blotting paper to the opposite side. The reagent  may then be observed to flow across the field and come into contact with  such of the micro-organisms as lie in its path.    The non-toxic basic dyes most generally employed for the intra-vitam  staining of bacteria are        Neutral red,    }      Quinoleine blue }      Methylene green }  in 0.5 per cent. aqueous solutions.      Vesuvin,        }    _Negative Stain_ (Burri).--By this method of demonstration the  appearances presented by dark ground illumination (by means of a  paraboloid condenser) are closely simulated, since minute particles,  bacteria, blood or pus cells etc. stand out as brilliantly white or  colourless bodies on a dark grey-brown background.    _Reagent required:_    Any one of the liquid waterproof black drawing inks (Chin-chin, Pelican,  etc.). This is prepared for use as follows:    Measure out and mix:        Liquid black ink,       25 c.c.      Tincture of iodine       1 c.c.    Allow the mixture to stand 24 hours, centrifugalise thoroughly, pipette  off the supernatant liquid to a clean bottle and then add a crystal of  thymol or one drop of formalin as a preservative.    METHOD.--    1. With the sterilised loop deposit one drop of the liquid ink close to  one end of a 3 by 1 slide.    2. With the sterilised loop deposit a drop of the fluid culture (or of  an emulsion from a solid culture) by the side of the drop of ink (Fig.  69, a); mix the two drops thoroughly by the aid of the loop.    3. Sterilise the loop.    4. Hold the slide firmly on the bench with the thumb and forefinger of  the left hand applied to the end nearest the drop of fluid.    5. Take another clean 3 by 1 slide in the right hand and lower its short  end obliquely (at an angle of about 60 deg.) transversely on to the mixed  ink and culture on the first slide, and allow the fluid to spread across  the slide and fill the angle of incidence.    6. Maintaining the original angle, draw the second slide firmly and  evenly along the first toward the end farthest from the left hand (Fig.  69, b).    7. Throw the second slide into a pot of disinfectant; allow the first  slide to dry in the air.    [Illustration: FIG. 69.--Spreading negative film.]    8. Place a drop of immersion oil on the centre of the film, lower the  1/12-inch objective into the oil and examine microscopically without the  intervention of a cover-slip.    (The film of ink may be covered with a long cover-glass and xylol balsam  as a permanent preparation.)    (<b) _Hanging-drop Preparation._--    1. Smear a layer of sterile vaseline on the upper surface of the ring  cell of a hanging-drop slide by means of the glass rod provided with the  vaseline bottle, and place the slide on a piece of filter paper.    2. \"Flame\" a cover-slip and place it on the filter paper by the side of  the hanging-drop slide.    3. Place a drop of water on the centre of the cover-slip by means of the  platinum loop.    4. Obtain a small quantity of the material it is desired to examine, in  the manner detailed above (pages 74-76, steps 2 to 11 must be followed  in their entirety and with the strictest exactitude whenever tube  contents are being handled), and mix it with the drop of water on the  cover-slip.    5. Raise the cover-slip in the points of the forceps and rapidly invert  it on to the ring cell of the hanging-drop slide, so that the drop of  fluid occupies the centre of the ring. (Carefully avoid contact between  the drop of fluid and either the ring cell or the layer of vaseline.  Should this happen, the now _infected_ hanging-drop slide and its  cover-slip must be dropped into the pot of lysol and a new preparation  made.)    6. Press the cover-slip firmly down into the vaseline on "]]]
