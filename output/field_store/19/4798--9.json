The world being what it was, it is to be doubted whether Israel  would have preserved intact the pure ore of religion, which the prophets  had extracted for the use of mankind as well as for their nation, had  not the leaders of the nation been zealous, even to death, for the dross  of the law in which it was embedded. The struggle of the Jews, under the  Maccabean house, against the Seleucidae was as important for mankind as  that of the Greeks against the Persians. And, of all the strange ironies  of history, perhaps the strangest is that \"Pharisee\" is current, as  a term of reproach, among the theological descendants of that sect of  Nazarenes who, without the martyr spirit of those primitive Puritans,  would never have come into existence. They, like their historical  successors, our own Puritans, have shared the general fate of the poor  wise men who save cities.    A criticism of theology from the side of science is not thought of  by the prophets, and is at most indicated in the books of Job and  Ecclesiastes, in both of which the problem of vindicating the ways of  God to man is given up, though on different grounds, as a hopeless one.  But with the extensive introduction of Greek thought among the Jews,  which took place, not only during the domination of the Seleucidae in  Palestine, but in the great Judaic colony which flourished in Egypt  under the Ptolemies, criticism, on both ethical and scientific grounds,  took a new departure.    In the hands of the Alexandrian Jews, as represented by Philo, the  fundamental axiom of later Jewish, as of Christian monotheism, that the  Deity is infinitely perfect and infinitely good, worked itself out into  its logical consequence--agnostic theism. Philo will allow of no point  of contact between God and a world in which evil exists. For him God has  no relation to space or to time, and, as infinite, suffers no predicate  beyond that of existence. It is therefore absurd to ascribe to Him  mental faculties and affections comparable in the remotest degree to  those of men; He is in no way an object of cognition; He is [Greek] and  [Greek] [33]--without quality and incomprehensible. That is to say the  Alexandrian Jew of the first century had anticipated the reasonings  of Hamilton and Mansell in the nineteenth, and, for him, God is the  Unknowable in the sense in which that term is used by Mr. Herbert  Spencer. Moreover, Philo's definition of the Supreme Being would not be  inconsistent with that \"substantia constans infinitis attributis, quorum  unumquodque aeternam et infinitam essentiam exprimit,\" given by another  great Israelite, were it not that Spinoza's doctrine of the immanence of  the Deity in the world puts him, at any rate formally, at the antipodes  of theological speculation. But the conception of the essential  incognoscibility of the Deity is the same in each case. However, Philo  was too thorough an Israelite and too much the child of his time to be  content with this agnostic position. With the help of the Platonic  and Stoic philosophy, he constructed an apprehensible, if not  comprehensible, quasi-deity out of the Logos; while other more or less  personified divine powers, or attributes, bridged over the interval  between God and man; between the sacred existence, too pure to be called  by any name which implied a conceivable quality, and the gross and evil  world of matter. In order to get over the ethical difficulties presented  by the naive naturalism of many parts of those Scriptures, in the divine  authority of which he firmly believed, Philo borrowed from the Stoics  (who had been in like straits in respect of Greek mythology), that  great Excalibur which they had forged with infinite pains and skill--the  method of allegorical interpretation. This mighty \"two-handed engine at  the door\" of the theologian is warranted to make a speedy end of any  and every moral or intellectual difficulty, by showing that, taken  allegorically or, as it is otherwise said, \"poetically\" or, \"in a  spiritual sense,\" the plainest words mean whatever a pious interpreter  desires they should mean. In Biblical phrase, Zeno (who probably had  a strain of Semitic blood in him) was the \"father of all such as  reconcile.\" No doubt Philo and his followers were eminently religious  men; but they did endless injury to the cause of religion by laying the  foundations of a new theology, while equipping the defenders of it  with the subtlest of all weapons of offence and defence, and with an  inexhaustible store of sophistical arguments of the most plausible  aspect.    The question of the real bearing upon theology of the influence exerted  by the teaching of Philo's contemporary, Jesus of Nazareth, is one upon  which it is not germane to my present purpose to enter. I take it simply  as an unquestionable fact that his immediate disciples, known to their  countrymen as \"Nazarenes,\" were regarded as, and considered themselves  to be, perfectly orthodox Jews, belonging to the puritanic or pharisaic  section of their people, and differing from the rest only in their  belief that the Messiah had already come. Christianity, it is said,  first became clearly differentiated at Antioch, and it separated  itself from orthodox Judaism by denying the obligation of the rite  of circumcision and of the food prohibitions, prescribed by the law.  Henceforward theology became relatively stationary among the Jews, [34]  and the history of its rapid progress in a new course of evolution is  the history of the Christian Churches, orthodox and heterodox. The  steps in this evolution are obvious. The first is the birth of a new  theological scheme arising out of the union of elements derived from  Greek philosophy with elements derived from Israelitic theology. In  the fourth Gospel, the Logos, raised to a somewhat higher degree of  personification than in the Alexandrian theosophy, is identified with  Jesus of Nazareth. In the Epistles, especially the later of those  attributed to Paul, the Israelitic ideas of the Messiah and of  sacrificial atonement coalesce with one another and with the embodiment  of the Logos in Jesus, until the apotheosis of the Son of man is almost,  or quite, effected. The history of Christian dogma, from Justin to  Athanasius, is a record of continual progress in the same direction,  until the fair body of religion, revealed in almost naked purity by the  prophets, is once more hidden under a new accumulation of dogmas and of  ritual practices of which the primitive Nazarene knew nothing; and which  he would probably have regarded as blasphemous if he could have been  made to understand them.    As, century after century, the ages roll on, polytheism comes back under  the disguise of Mariolatry and the adoration of saints; image-worship  becomes as rampant as in old Egypt; adoration of relics takes the place  of the old fetish-worship; the virtues of the ephod pale before those of  holy coats and handkerchiefs; shrines and calvaries make up for the  loss of the ark and of the high places; and even the lustral fluid of  paganism is replaced by holy water at the porches of the temples. A  touching ceremony--the common meal originally eaten in pious memory of  a loved teacher--becomes metamorphosed into a flesh-and-blood sacrifice,  supposed to possess exactly that redeeming virtue which the prophets  denied to the flesh-and-blood sacrifices of their day; while the minute  observance of ritual is raised to a degree of punctilious refinement  which Levitical legislators might envy. And with the growth of this  theology, grew its inevitable concomitant, the belief in evil spirits,  in possession, in sorcery, in charms and omens, until the Christians of  the twelfth century after our era were sunk in more debased and brutal  superstitions than are recorded of the Israelites in the twelfth century  before it.    The greatest men of the Middle Ages are unable to escape the infection.  Dante's \"Inferno\" would be revolting if it were not so often sublime, so  often exquisitely tender. The hideous pictures which cover a vast space  on the south wall of the Campo Santo of Pisa convey information, as  terrible as it is indisputable, of the theological conceptions of  Dante's countrymen in the fourteenth century, whose eyes were addressed  by the painters of those disgusting scenes, and whose approbation they  knew how to win. A candid Mexican of the time of Cortez, could he  have seen this Christian burial-place, would have taken it for an  appropriately adorned Teocalli. The professed disciple of the God  of justice and of mercy might there gloat over the sufferings of his  fellowmen depicted as undergoing every extremity of atrocious and  sanguinary torture to all eternity, for theological errors no less than  for moral delinquencies; while, in the central figure of Satan, [35]  occupied in champing up souls in his capacious and well-toothed jaws, to  void them again for the purpose of undergoing fresh suffering, we have  the counterpart of the strange Polynesian and Egyptian dogma that there  were certain gods who employed themselves in devouring the ghostly flesh  of the Spirits of the dead. But in justice to the Polynesians, it must  be recollected that, after three such operations, they thought the soul  was purified and happy. In the view of the Christian theologian the  operation was only a preparation for new tortures continued for ever and  aye.    With the growth of civilisation in Europe, and with the revival of  letters and of science in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26346"],[0,"Our Bird Comrades (#12)"],[1," shift for  himself, he deserts his little parents and nurses and seeks  companionship among his own blood kindred, who doubtless bring him up  in the way all cowbirds should go.    It is surprising how many species are imposed on successfully by the  cowbird.  The number, so far as has been observed, is ninety, with  probably more to be added.  Among the birds most frequently victimized  are the phoebes, the song sparrows, the indigo birds, the bush  sparrows, and the yellow-breasted chats.  Even the nests of the  red-headed woodpecker and the rock wrens are not exempt.  Some species,  notably the summer warblers, detect the imposture and set about  defeating the purposes of the interloper by building another story to  their little cottage, leaving the obtruded eggs in the cellar, where  they do not receive enough warmth to develop the embryo.    While it is surprising that acute birds should allow themselves to be  imposed on in this way, perhaps, after all, they look upon the cowbird  as a kind of blessing in disguise; at least, he may not be an unmixed  evil.  They may act on the principle of reciprocity--that \"one good  turn deserves another.\"  What I mean is this: In my rambles I have  often found the cowbirds the first to give warning of the approach of a  supposed danger.  Having no domestic duties of their own, they can well  secrete themselves in a tall tree overlooking the entire premises, and  thus play the useful role of sentinel.  This, I am disposed to believe,  is one of the compensating uses of this parasite, and may furnish the  reason for his being tolerated in birdland.  And he is tolerated.  Has  any one ever seen other birds driving the cowbird away from their  breeding precincts, or charging him with desperate courage, as they do  the blue jays, the hawks, the owls, and other predatory species?  He  evidently subserves some useful purpose in the avian community, or he  would not be treated with so much consideration.    A young cowbird that I purloined from the nest and tried to rear by  hand did not prove a pleasant pet.  He was placed in a large cage with  several other kinds of young birds.  At first he was quite docile,  taking his food from my hand and even allowing some of his feathered  companions to feed him; but in a few weeks he grew so wild and  manifested such a fierce desire for the outdoor world that I was glad  to carry him out to the woods and give him his freedom.  A young  red-winged blackbird and a pair of meadowlarks developed a different  disposition.    The dwarf cow-bird (_Molothrus ater obscurus_) is similar to his  relative just described, except that he is smaller and his geographical  range is more restricted.  He is a resident of Mexico, southern Texas,  southwestern Arizona, and southern California.  His habits resemble  those of the common cowbird.  Another bunting having almost the same  range, although a little more southerly, is the red-eyed cowbird, which  is larger and darker than our common cowbird and has the same  parasitical habits.    In South America three species have been studied by Mr. W. H. Hudson,  who, in collaboration with Mr. P. L. Sclater, has published a most  valuable work on Argentine ornithology.  One of these is called the  Argentine cowbird (_Molothrus bonariensis_).  It is a blue-blooded  parasite, and has been seen striking its beak into the eggs of other  birds and flying away with them.  The males, it is said, show little  discrimination in pecking the eggs, for they are just as likely to  puncture the cowbird eggs as those of other birds.  Every egg in a nest  is frequently perforated in this way.  These buntings lay a large  number of eggs, often dropping them on the ground, laying them in  abandoned nests, or depositing them in nests in which incubation has  already begun, in which case all of them are lost.  However, in spite  of this wastefulness the birds thrive, thousands of them being seen in  flocks during the season of migration.    And, by the way, a description of their habits by Mr. Hudson has thrown  interesting light on the subject of migration in the southern  hemisphere.  South of the equator the recurrence of the seasons is the  exact reverse of their recurrence north of the equator, and therefore  the breeding season of the birds is in the autumn instead of the  spring; the flight from winter cold occurs in the spring instead of in  the autumn, and is toward the north instead of toward the south.  Thus,  in February and March the Argentine cowbirds are seen flying in vast  battalions in the direction of the equatorial regions--that is,  northward--in whose salubrious clime they spend the winter.  As our  northern autumn draws near and the southern spring approaches these  winged migrants take the air line for their breeding haunts in the  Argentine Republic and Patagonia.  At the same time the migrants of the  northern hemisphere are pressing southward before the blustering north  wind.  It all seems wonderful and solemn, this world-wide processional  of the seasons and the birds.    Naturally one would expect to find some other eccentricities in this  aberrant family besides that of parasitism, and in this expectation one  is not disappointed.  There are two other species of cowbirds in the  Argentine country--the screaming cowbird (_Molothrus rufoaxillaris_)  and the bay-winged cowbird (_Molothrus badius_).  The latter is only  partly a trencher on the rights of other birds--only half a parasite.  Indeed, it sometimes builds its own nest, which is quite a respectable  affair; but, as if to prove that it still has some remnants of cowbird  depravity in its nature, it frequently drives other birds from their  rightful possessions, appropriates the quarters thus acquired, lays its  eggs into them, and proceeds to the performance of its domestic duties  like its respectable neighbors.  Its virtue is that it never imposes  the work of incubation and brood rearing on any of its feathered  associates, even though it does sometimes eject them from their  premises.    But what is to be said of the screaming cowbird?  Instead of inflicting  its eggs on its more distant avian relatives, it watches its chance and  slyly drops them into the domicile of its bay-winged cousins, and  actually makes them hatch and rear its offspring!  This seems to be  carrying imposture to the extreme of refinement, or possibly developing  it into a fine art, and reminds one of those human good-for-naughts who  \"sponge\" off their relatives rather than go among strangers.    Before closing this chapter I must call attention to one of the most  surprising discoveries ever made by an American observer of bird ways.  It was reported some time after my article on the cowbird was first  published in Appleton's \"Popular Science Monthly.\"  The observer was  Joseph F. Honecker, whose statement was printed in \"American  Ornithology\" for June, 1902, and runs as follows:    \"As ornithologists and all bird students think and believe that the  cowbird will build no nest, but always lays in the nests of other  birds, I am glad to give the results of my experiments.  In order to  get the desired results, in the spring of 1899 I secured a pair of  cowbirds and placed them in a large cage, cared well for them, and  supplied them with plenty of nesting material.  To my surprise, the  female built a nest, laid four eggs, hatched them, and reared the  young, and on July twenty-eighth, young and old were given their  freedom.  This will show that the cowbird will build a nest and care  for its young in captivity, while in its wild life it has never been  known to do so.\"    A BLUE CANNIBAL*    *Reprinted by permission from \"The Evening Post,\" New York.      In his coat of light blue, trimmed with white and black, bearing his  crest jauntily atop of his head, the blue jay presents an attractive  picture.  And, indeed, although I myself feel that the Baltimore  oriole, the scarlet tanager, the ruby-throated hummingbird, and many of  the wood warblers carry off the palm for brilliancy of plumage, there  are persons who declare that the jay is the most handsomely colored  bird in our temperate regions.    While the jay dons an engaging attire, not much can be said in the way  of eulogy for his vocal talents or acquirements.  Many of his calls are  harsh, penetrating, and even raucous.  Frequently, too, he indulges in  a great to-do over nothing, fairly splitting your ears with his noisy  cries.  I have said it is a to-do over nothing, though Mr. Jay may  think he has the best reason in the world for making a fuss.  Often  espying some coveted prize on the ground in my back yard, instead of  quietly dropping down and taking it, he and his companions would dash  about in the trees, swing their bodies sidewise and up and down in an  excited way, and scream at the top of their voices, sometimes drawing  me out of the house to see what had gone wrong in Jaydom.  They seemed  to be determined to attract the attention of every person on the  premises to the fact that they wanted that morsel on the ground, but  were afraid to venture down after it.  Perhaps they meant by their  objurgations to test their human neighbors, to ascertain whether any of  them were prowling about with a gun or a sling, ready to do them harm.  If there should be any such prowlers, probably the jays meant to induce  them to come out of their ambush, to show themselves in the open, and  give their jayships a chance to escape.  Bird psychology, as you will  have occasion to note more than once, is a good deal of an enigma.  How  often we would give a handsome bonus to a bird if he would let us know  precisely what he was thinking about!    [Illustration: Blue Jay]    Although no musician, the jay has quite an extensive vocal repertory.  Besides his loud, challenging call, he frequently utters a series of  calls that have a pensive quality and that fill the mind with an  indefinable foreboding,"]]]
