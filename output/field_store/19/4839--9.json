The children, too, with their boisterous merriment and  constant talk about the holidays, seemed determined to bear it in mind,  and the great dinner--the one dinner of the year--in the preparation of  which Aunt Tibby had exercised all her skill; this, in itself, seemed to  proclaim that it was Christmas.    \"Oh, Miss Fanny,\" said little Joy, \"don't you wish Christmas lasted the  whole year round?\"    The short December day was fast drawing to a close, as a party of four  rode leisurely along the road crossing La Belle Prairie. The ladies,  though scarcely recognizable in their close hoods, long blue cotton  riding skirts, and thick gloves, were none other than Miss Nancy Catlett  and our friend Fanny, while their attendants were Mr. Chester, the town  gentleman, and Massa Dave Catlett, who had come over from his new home  in Kansas, on purpose to enjoy the Christmas festivities on the prairie.  One of those night parties, of which Nanny had talked so much, was to  come off at Col. Turner's, and this was the place of their destination.  In accordance with the customs of society in these parts, they were to  remain until the next day, and, accordingly, black Viny rode a little in  the rear, mounted upon old \"Poke Neck,\" and bearing sundry carpet-bags  and valises, containing the ladies' party-dresses.    Just at dusk, our party reached their journey's end, and dismounting one  by one from the horse-block in front of the house, they walked up the  road, and were met in the porch by Miss Bell Turner, Nanny's particular  friend. This young lady, with long curls and a very slender waist,  performed the duties of hostess in a free and easy manner, ushering the  gentlemen into the parlor, where a fire was blazing on the hearth, while  the ladies, with their attendants, were conducted up-stairs to the  dressing-room.    Here a dozen or more were engaged in the mysteries of the toilet,  braiding, twisting, and curling, while as many servants were flying  about, stumbling over each other, and creating the most dire confusion  in their efforts to supply the wants of their respective mistresses. The  beds and chairs were covered with dresses, capes, ribbons,  curling-irons, flowers, combs, and brushes, and all the paraphernalia of  the toilet, while the ladies themselves kept up a continual stream of  conversation with each other and their attendants.    Into this scene Nanny entered with great spirit. Shaking hands all  round, and introducing Fanny, she hastily threw off her bonnet and  shawl, and bidding Viny unpack the things, she set about dressing in  good earnest.    \"How nice to get here so early,\" she said. \"Now we can have a chance at  the glass, and plenty of room to move about in.\"    Fanny wondered what she called plenty of room, but had yet to learn the  signification of the term when applied to the dressing-room of a western  party. Thicker and faster came the arrivals, and it being necessary that  each lady should undergo a thorough transformation in dress, before  making her appearance down-stairs, the labor and confusion necessary to  bring this about can be imagined. Such hurryings to and fro, such  knockings down and pickings up, such scolding and laughing, in short  such a Babel of sounds as filled the room for an hour or two, Fanny had  never heard before. Completing her own toilet as soon as possible, she  seated herself upon one of the beds, and watched the proceedings with  great interest.    \"You Suke, bring me some more pins, directly.\" \"O please, Miss Ellen,  mind my wreath!\" \"Jule, how much longer are you goin' to keep the  wash-bowl?\" \"Dar now, Miss Eveline done get her coat all wet.\" \"Did you  know Tom Walton was here? I see him in the passage.\" \"Miss Belle, that's  _my_ starch-bag.\" \"There, now! don't them slippers fit beautiful?\" \"Why  don't that girl come back?\" \"O, Liza, just fasten up my dress, that's a  dear girl!\" \"Come, girls, do hurry, we shan't be dressed to-night.\"    How it was all brought about, Fanny could not tell, but at last the  ladies were dressed, the last sash pinned, and the last curl adjusted.  Dresses of thin material, cut low in the neck, with short sleeves,  seemed to be the order of the night, which with wreaths, and bunches of  artificial flowers in the hair, gave the ladies a handsome appearance.  With Miss Belle at the head, they all descended to the parlor, and found  the gentlemen strolling about, employing themselves as they could, till  the night's amusements commenced; and, indeed, both ladies and gentlemen  manifested such eagerness to adjourn to the play-room, that the signal  was soon given, and they proceeded forthwith to a log building in the  yard, formerly used as a school-room.    Games soon commenced, and were carried on with great vigor, the young  people making up in activity what was lacking in gracefulness of motion.  Game after game was made out, the ladies vying with each other to see  who should laugh the most, while those who were left chatted gayly  together in groups, or tried their powers of fascination upon some  long-limbed specimen of humanity.    \"What calls the gentlemen up-stairs so frequently?\" inquired Fanny,  innocently, as groups of two and three disappeared up the steps leading  to the room above.    \"You are not aware, then, what a formidable rival the ladies have up in  the loft?\" said Mr. Chester, gravely, though there was a comical  expression about the corners of his mouth.    \"No, indeed.\"    \"Well, I only hope you may not witness the overpowering influence  sometimes exerted by this same rival,\" said Mr. Chester; \"but honestly,  Miss Hunter, there is serious danger that some of these light-footed  young gentlemen may, ere long, be obliged to relinquish their places in  our party, all through the attractions presented to them up yonder.\"    \"I don't in the least know what you mean.\"    \"In plain words, then, they are talking about horses up there; men are  crazy over horses you know.\"    \"Are you in earnest, Mr. Chester?\"    \"Certainly I am. It would not answer, I suppose, for ladies to intrude  upon their modest retirement, or I could convince you in a moment.\"    \"How can you joke about it, Mr. Chester? I think it is perfectly  scandalous.\"    \"Well, it is bad enough,\" said her companion, more gravely. \"One living  at the west becomes accustomed to such things.\"    \"_I_ never will,\" said Fanny. \"If I had known these Christmas parties  countenanced such impoliteness, I would have stayed at home.\"    \"A set supper,\" Nanny had several times expressed a hope that Mrs.  Turner would provide, and she was not disappointed. The long table was  bountifully spread with the substantials of this life, and though not in  the style of an entertainment in Fifth Avenue, it was admirably suited  to the guests who partook of it. A roasted \"shoat\" graced each end of  the board, a side of bacon the centre, while salted beef, cut in thin  slices, with pickles and cheese, constituted the side-dishes. Hot  coffee, corn bread and biscuit were passed to each guest, and a piece of  pound-cake and a little preserved fruit for dessert.    There was plenty of laughter and hearty joking at the table, and the  flushed faces and increased volubility of the gentlemen gave too certain  evidence of the truth of Mr. Chester's assertions.    \"The langest day maun hae an end,\" says the old Scotch proverb, audit  was with a sigh of relief that Fanny at last saw Uncle Jake lay down the  tortured fiddle, and the guests with lingering steps and wishful eyes  retire to seek the few hours of repose that were left of the night.  \"Confusion worse confounded\" reigned for a time in the apartment  appropriated to the ladies' use, and the numerous couches spread upon  the floor increased the difficulty of navigation. At last, when quiet  seemed restored, and Fanny was sinking into a peaceful sleep, she was  aroused by her neighbors in an adjoining bed, three young ladies who  declared that they were \"all but starved, and must have something to eat  before they could go to sleep.\" One of the black women was despatched to  the store-room for some slices of cold bacon, and sitting up in bed,  with the candle before them, they made a hearty repast.    \"Of course, you can't eat half as much as you want at table,\" said one  of the young ladies, apologetically; \"one always wants to appear  delicate-like before the gentlemen.\"    \"What in goodness' name, Nan, made breakfast so late?\" said Dave the  next morning, or rather noon, as they were returning home; \"I thought  one while we wasn't goin' to get any.\" \"Why, you see, they hadn't any  wheat flour in the house for the biscuit,\" said Nanny, \"and they had to  send three miles over the prairie to Mr. John Turner's to borrow some.\"    \"Twenty people invited to stay over night, and no flour in the house?\"  said Fanny, in amazement.    \"It rather shocks your Yankee ideas of looking out ahead, Miss Hunter,\"  said Mr. Chester, laughing. \"We are used to such things out this way.\"    \"Oh! Miss Fanny, people can't remember everything, you know,\" said  Nanny; \"Belle says they never thought a word about it till this  morning.\"          JOE'S SEARCH FOR SANTA CLAUS.    BY IRVING BACHELLER           A story, my child? Well, there's none that I know       As good as the story about little Joe.       He lived with his mother, just under the eaves       Of a tenement high, where the telegraph weaves       Its highway of wire, that everywhere goes,       And makes the night musical when the wind blows.       Their home had no father--the two were bereft       Of all but their appetites--those never left!       Joe's grew with his thought; a day never passed       He spent not in hunger to make the food last;       And days when his mother silently went "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28216"],[0,"Respiration Calorimeters for Studying the Respiratory Exchange and Energy (#12)"],[1,"device called a creeper, consisting  of a piece of brass carefully fitted to a threaded steel rod some 30  centimeters long. The movement of this bar along this threaded rod  accomplishes two things. The bar is in contact with the slide-wire J  and therefore varies the position of the point _q_ and it also carries  with it a stylographic pen. The movements of this bar to the right or  the left are produced by an auxiliary electric current, the contact of  which is made by a plunger-plate forcing the pointer P against either  S_{1} or S_{2}. P makes the contact between Pl and either S_{1} or S_{2}  and sends a current through solenoids at either the right or the left of  the creeper. At intervals of every 2 seconds the plunger rises and  forces the pointer P against either S_{1}, _i_, or S_{2} above. The  movement of this plunger is controlled by a current from a 110-volt  circuit, the connections of which are shown in fig. 22. If the contact  is made at T, the current passes through 2,600 ohms, directly across the  110-volt circuit, and consequently there is no effective current flowing  through the plunger Pl. When the contact T is open, the current flows  through the plunger in series with 2,600 ohms resistance. T is opened  automatically at intervals of 2 seconds by the clock.    [Illustration: FIG. 21.--Diagram of wiring of circuits actuating plunger  and creeper.]    [Illustration: FIG. 22.--Diagram of wiring of complete 110-volt  circuit.]    The movement of the contact arm along the threaded rod is produced by  the action of either one of two solenoids, each of which has a core  attached to a rack and pinion at either end of the rod. If the current  is passed through the contact S_{1}, a current passes through the  left-hand solenoid, the core moves down, the rack on the core moves the  pinion on the rod through a definite fraction of a complete revolution  and this movement forces the creeper in one direction. Conversely, the  passing of the current through the solenoid at the other end of the  threaded rod moves the creeper in the other direction. The distance  which the iron rack on the end of the core is moved is determined  carefully, so that the threaded rod is turned for each contact exactly  the same fraction of a revolution. For actuating these solenoids, the  110-volt circuit is again used. The wire connections are shown in part  in fig. 21, in which it is seen that the current passes through the  plunger-contact and through the pointer P to the silver plate S_{1} and  then along the line G_{1} through 350 ohms wound about the left-hand  solenoid back through a 600-ohm resistance to the main line. The use of  the 110-volt current under such circumstances would normally produce a  notable sparking effect on the pointer P, and to reduce this to a  minimum there is a high resistance, amounting to 10,000 ohms on each  side, shunted between the main line and the creeper connections. This  shunt is shown in diagram in fig. 22. Thus there is never a complete  open circuit and sparking is prevented.      THE CLOCK.    The clock requires winding every week and is so geared as to move the  paper forward at a rate of 3 inches per hour. The contact-point for  opening the circuit T on fig. 22 is likewise connected with one of the  smaller wheels of the clock. This contact is made by tripping a little  lever by means of a toothed wheel of phosphor-bronze.      INSTALLATION OF THE APPARATUS.    [Illustration: FIG. 23    Temperature recorder.

A curve representing the temperature  difference between the ingoing and outgoing water is directly drawn on  the coordinate paper. Above are three resistance boxes, and the switches  for electrical connections are at the right. On the top shelf is the  galvanometer, and immediately beneath, the plug resistance box for  altering the value of certain shunts.]    [Illustration: FIG. 24.--Detailed wiring diagram showing all parts of  recording apparatus, together with wiring to thermometers complete,  including all previous figures.]    The whole apparatus is permanently and substantially installed on the  north wall of the calorimeter laboratory. A photograph showing the  various parts and their installation is given in fig. 23. On the top  shelf is seen the galvanometer and on the lower shelf the recorder with  its glass door in front and the coordinate paper dropping into the box  below. The curve drawn on the coordinate paper is clearly shown. Above  the recorder are the resistance-boxes, three in number, the lower one at  the left being the resistance S_{1}, the upper one at the left being the  resistance S', and the upper one at the right being the resistance  Z_{1}. Immediately above the resistance-box Z_{1} is shown the plug  resistance-box which controls on the one hand the resistance _r_ and on  the other hand the resistance S, both of which are substantially altered  when changing the apparatus to register from the 0 deg. to 4 deg. scale to  the 0 deg. to 8 deg. scale. A detailed wiring diagram is given in fig. 24.      TEMPERATURE CONTROL OF THE INGOING AIR.    [Illustration: FIG. 25.--Section of calorimeter walls and part of  ventilating air-circuit, showing part of pipes for ingoing air and  outgoing air. On the ingoing air-pipe at the right is the lamp for  heating the ingoing air. Just above it, H is the quick-throw valve for  shutting off the tension equalizer IJ. I is the copper portion of the  tension equalizer, while J is the rubber diaphragm; K, the pet-cock for  admitting oxygen; F, E, G, the lead pipe conducting the cold water for  the ingoing air; and C, the hair-felt insulation. N, N are brass ferules  soldered into the copper and zinc walls through which air-pipes pass; M,  a rubber stopper for insulating the air-pipe from the calorimeter; O,  the thermal junctions for indicating differences of temperature of  ingoing and outgoing air and U, the connection to the outside; QQ, exits  for the air-pipes from the box in which thermal junctions are placed; P,  the dividing plate separating the ingoing and outgoing air; R, the  section of piping conducting the air inside the calorimeter; S, a  section of piping through which the air passes from the calorimeter; A,  a section of the copper wall; Y, a bolt fastening the copper wall to the  2-1/2 inch angle W; B, a portion of zinc wall; C, hair-felt lining of  asbestos wall D; T-J, a thermal junction in the walls.]    In passing the current of air through the calorimeter, temperature  conditions may easily be such that the air entering is warmer than the  outcoming air, in which case heat will be imparted to the calorimeter,  or the reverse conditions may obtain and then heat will be brought away.  To avoid this difficulty, arrangements are made for arbitrarily  controlling the temperature of the air as it enters the calorimeter.  This temperature control is based upon the fact that the air leaving the  chamber is caused to pass over the ends of a series of thermal junctions  shown as O in fig. 25. These thermal junctions have one terminal in the  outgoing air and the other in the ingoing air, and consequently any  difference in the temperature of the two air-currents is instantly  detected by connecting the circuit with the galvanometer. Formerly the  temperature control was made a varying one, by providing for either  cooling or heating the ingoing air as the situation called for. The  heating was done by passing the current through an electric lamp placed  in the cross immediately below the tension equalizer J. Cooling was  effected by means of a current of water through the lead pipe E closely  wrapped around the air-pipe, water entering at F and leaving at G. This  lead pipe is insulated by hair-felt pipe-covering, C. More recently, we  have adopted the procedure of passing a continuous current of water,  usually at a very slow rate, through the lead pipe E and always heating  the air somewhat by means of the lamp, the exact temperature control  being obtained by varying the heating effect of the lamp itself. This  has been found much more satisfactory than by alternating from the  cooling system to the heating system. In the case of the air-current,  however, it is unnecessary to have the drop-sight feed-valve as used for  the wall control, shown in fig. 13.      THE HEAT OF VAPORIZATION OF WATER.    During experiments with man not all the heat leaves the body by  radiation and conduction, since a part is required to vaporize the water  from the skin and lungs. An accurate measurement of the heat production  by man therefore required a knowledge of the amount of heat thus  vaporized. One of the great difficulties in the numerous forms of  calorimeters that have been used heretofore with man is that only that  portion of heat measured by direct radiation or conduction has been  measured and the difficulties attending the determination of water  vaporized have vitiated correspondingly the estimates of the heat  production. Fortunately, with this apparatus the determinations of water  are very exact, and since the amount of water vaporized inside the  chamber is known it is possible to compute the heat required to vaporize  this water by knowing the heat of vaporization of water.    Since the earlier reports describing the first form of calorimeters were  written, there has appeared a research by one of our former associates,  Dr. A. W. Smith[11] who, recognizing the importance of knowing exactly  the heat of vaporization of water at 20 deg., has made this a special  object of investigation. When connected with our laboratory a number of  experiments were made by Doctors Smith and Benedict in an attempt to  determine the heat of vaporization of water directly in a large  calorimeter; but for lack of time and pressure of other experimental  work it was impossible to complete the investigation. Subsequently Dr.  Smith has "]]]
