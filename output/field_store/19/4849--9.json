Think of this,  Lygia. I know too that thy doctrine does not permit thee to be what  I was, and that to you as to the Stoics,--of whom Epictetus has told  me,--when it comes to a choice between shame and death, it is permitted  to choose only death. But canst thou say that death awaits thee and not  shame too? Hast thou heard of the daughter of Sejanus, a young maiden,  who at command of Tiberius had to pass through shame before her death,  so as to respect a law which prohibits the punishment of virgins with  death? Lygia, Lygia, do not irritate Caesar. If the decisive moment comes  when thou must choose between disgrace and death, thou wilt act as thy  faith commands; but seek not destruction thyself, and do not irritate  for a trivial cause an earthly and at the same time a cruel divinity.\"    Acte spoke with great compassion, and even with enthusiasm; and being  a little short-sighted, she pushed her sweet face up to Lygia's as if  wishing to see surely the effect of her words.    But Lygia threw her arms around Acte's neck with childish trustfulness  and said,--\"Thou art kind, Acte.\"    Acte, pleased by the praise and confidence, pressed her to her heart;  and then disengaging herself from the arms of the maiden, answered,--\"My  happiness has passed and my joy is gone, but I am not wicked.\" Then she  began to walk with quick steps through the room and to speak to herself,  as if in despair.    \"No! And he was not wicked. He thought himself good at that time, and he  wished to be good. I know that best. All his change came later, when he  ceased to love. Others made him what he is--yes, others--and Poppaea.\"    Here her eyelids filled with tears. Lygia followed her for some time  with her blue eyes, and asked at last,--\"Art thou sorry for him, Acte?\"    \"I am sorry for him!\" answered the Grecian, with a low voice. And  again she began to walk, her hands clinched as if in pain, and her face  without hope.    \"Dost thou love him yet, Acte?\" asked Lygia, timidly.    \"I love him.\"    And after a while she added,--\"No one loves him but me.\"    Silence followed, during which Acte strove to recover her calmness,  disturbed by memories; and when at length her face resumed its usual  look of calm sorrow, she said,--    \"Let us speak of thee, Lygia. Do not even think of opposing Caesar; that  would be madness. And be calm. I know this house well, and I judge that  on Caesar's part nothing threatens thee. If Nero had given command  to take thee away for himself, he would not have brought thee to the  Palatine. Here Poppaea rules; and Nero, since she bore him a daughter, is  more than ever under her influence. No, Nero gave command, it is true,  that thou shouldst be at the feast, but he has not seen thee yet; he  has not inquired about thee, hence he does not care about thee. Maybe he  took thee from Aulus and Pomponia only through anger at them. Petronius  wrote me to have care of thee; and since Pomponia too wrote, as thou  knowest, maybe they had an understanding. Maybe he did that at her  request. If this be true, if he at the request of Pomponia will occupy  himself with thee, nothing threatens thee; and who knows if Nero may not  send thee back to Aulus at his persuasion? I know not whether Nero loves  him over much, but I know that rarely has he the courage to be of an  opinion opposite to his.\"    \"Ah, Acte!\" answered Lygia; \"Petronius was with us before they took  me, and my mother was convinced that Nero demanded my surrender at his  instigation.\"    \"That would be bad,\" said Acte. But she stopped for a while, and then  said,--\"Perhaps Petronius only said, in Nero's presence at some supper,  that he saw a hostage of the Lygians at Aulus's, and Nero, who is  jealous of his own power, demanded thee only because hostages belong to  Caesar. But he does not like Aulus and Pomponia. No! it does not seem to  me that if Petronius wished to take thee from Aulus he would use such a  method. I do not know whether Petronius is better than others of Caesar's  court, but he is different. Maybe too thou wilt find some one else who  would be willing to intercede for thee. Hast thou not seen at Aulus's  some one who is near Caesar?\"    \"I have seen Vespasian and Titus.\"    \"Caesar does not like them.\"    \"And Seneca.\"    \"If Seneca advised something, that would be enough to make Nero act  otherwise.\"    The bright face of Lygia was covered with a blush. \"And Vinicius-\"    \"I do not know him.\"    \"He is a relative of Petronius, and returned not long since from  Armenia.\"    \"Dost thou think that Nero likes him?\"    \"All like Vinicius.\"    \"And would he intercede for thee?\"    \"He would.\"    Acte smiled tenderly, and said, \"Then thou wilt see him surely at the  feast. Thou must be there, first, because thou must,--only such a child  as thou could think otherwise. Second, if thou wish to return to  the house of Aulus, thou wilt find means of beseeching Petronius and  Vinicius to gain for thee by their influence the right to return. If  they were here, both would tell thee as I do, that it would be madness  and ruin to try resistance. Caesar might not notice thy absence, it is  true; but if he noticed it and thought that thou hadst the daring to  oppose his will, here would be no salvation for thee. Go, Lygia! Dost  thou hear the noise in the palace? The sun is near setting; guests will  begin to arrive soon.\"    \"Thou art right,\" answered Lygia, \"and I will follow thy advice.\"    How much desire to see Vinicius and Petronius there was in this resolve,  how much of woman's curiosity there was to see such a feast once in  life, and to see at it Caesar, the court, the renowned Poppaea and other  beauties, and all that unheard-of splendor, of which wonders were  narrated in Rome, Lygia could not give account to herself of a  certainty. But Acte was right, and Lygia felt this distinctly. There was  need to go; therefore, when necessity and simple reason supported the  hidden temptation, she ceased to hesitate.    Acte conducted her to her own unctorium to anoint and dress her; and  though there was no lack of slave women in Caesar's house, and Acte had  enough of them for her personal service, still, through sympathy for the  maiden whose beauty and innocence had caught her heart, she resolved to  dress her herself. It became clear at once that in the young Grecian, in  spite of her sadness and her perusal of the letters of Paul of Tarsus,  there was yet much of the ancient Hellenic spirit, to which physical  beauty spoke with more eloquence than aught else on earth. When she  had undressed Lygia, she could not restrain an exclamation of wonder at  sight of her form, at once slender and full, created, as it were, from  pearl and roses; and stepping back a few paces, she looked with delight  on that matchless, spring-like form.    \"Lygia,\" exclaimed she at last, \"thou art a hundred times more beautiful  than Poppaea!\"    But, reared in the strict house of Pomponia, where modesty was observed,  even when women were by themselves, the maiden, wonderful as a wonderful  dream, harmonious as a work of Praxiteles or as a song, stood alarmed,  blushing from modesty, with knees pressed together, with her hands on  her bosom, and downcast eyes. At last, raising her arms with sudden  movement, she removed the pins which held her hair, and in one moment,  with one shake of her head, she covered herself with it as with a  mantle.    Acte, approaching her and touching her dark tresses, said,--    \"Oh, what hair thou hast! I will not sprinkle golden powder on it; it  gleams of itself in one place and another with gold, where it waves.  I will add, perhaps, barely a sprinkle here and there; but lightly,  lightly, as if a sun ray had freshened it. Wonderful must thy Lygian  country be where such maidens are born!    \"I do not remember it,\" answered Lygia; \"but Ursus has told me that with  us it is forests, forests, and forests.\"    \"But flowers bloom in those forests,\" said Acte, dipping her hand in a  vase filled with verbena, and moistening Lygia's hair with it. When she  had finished this work, Acte anointed her body lightly with odoriferous  oils from Arabia, and then dressed her in a soft gold-colored tunic  without sleeves, over which was to be put a snow-white peplus. But since  she had to dress Lygia's hair first, she put on her meanwhile a kind of  roomy dress called synthesis, and, seating her in an armchair, gave her  for a time into the hands of slave women, so as to stand at a distance  herself and follow the hairdressing. Two other slave women put on  Lygia's feet white sandals, embroidered with purple, fastening them to  her alabaster ankles with golden lacings drawn crosswise. When at  last the hair-dressing was finished, they put a peplus on her in very  beautiful, light folds; then Acte fastened pearls to her neck, and  touching her hair at the folds with gold dust, gave command to the women  to dress her, following Lygia with delighted eyes meanwhile.    But she was ready soon; and when the first litters began to appear  before the main gate, both entered the side portico from which were  visible the chief entrance, the interior galleries, and the courtyard  surrounded by a colonnade of Numidian marble.    Gradually people passed in greater and greater numbers under the lofty  arch of the entrance, over which the splendid quadrigae of Lysias seemed  to bear Apollo and Diana into space. Lygia's eyes were struck by that  magnificence, of which the modest house of Aulus could not have given  her the slightest idea. It was sunset; the last rays were falling on the  yellow Numidian marble of the columns, which shone like gold in those  gleams and changed into rose"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28536"],[0,"The Astronomy of the Bible (#12)"],[1,"the darkness: and God saw that it was good. And the       evening and the morning were the fourth day.\"      A double purpose for the two great heavenly bodies is indicated  here,--first, the obvious one of giving light; next, that of time  measurement. These, from the human and practical point of view, are the  two main services which the sun and moon render to us, and naturally  sufficed for the object that the writer had before him. There is no  evidence that he had any idea that the moon simply shone by reflecting  the light of the sun; still less that the sun was a light for worlds  other than our own; but if he had known these facts we can hardly  suppose that he would have mentioned them; there would have been no  purpose to be served by so doing.    But it is remarkable that no reference is made either to the  incalculable benefits conferred by the action of the sun in ripening the  fruits of the earth, or to the services of the moon as a time-measurer,  in dividing off the months. Both these actions are clearly indicated  later on in the Scriptures, where Moses, in the blessing which he  pronounced upon the tribe of Joseph, prayed that his land might be  blessed \"for the precious things of the fruits of the sun,\" so that we  may take their omission here, together with the omission of all mention  of the planets, and the slight parenthetical reference to the stars, as  indicating that this chapter was composed at an exceedingly early date.    The chief purpose of the sun is to give light; it \"rules\" or regulates  the day and \"divides the light from the darkness.\" As such it is the  appropriate emblem of God Himself, Who \"is Light, and in Him is no  darkness at all.\" These images are frequently repeated in the  Scriptures, and it is only possible to give a few instances. David  sings, \"The Lord is my light and my salvation.\" \"The Lord shall be unto  thee an everlasting light,\" is the promise made to Zion. St. John  expressly uses the term of the Son of God, our Lord: \"That was the true  Light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.\" Whilst the  more concrete emblem is used as often. In the eighty-fourth psalm, the  psalm of pilgrimage, we read, \"The Lord God is a sun and shield;\"  Malachi predicts that \"the Sun of Righteousness shall arise with  healing in His wings,\" and St James, with the same thought of the sun in  his mind, speaks of God as \"the Father of lights.\"    But in none of these or the other parallel passages is there the  remotest approach to any deification of the sun, or even of that most  ethereal of influences, light itself. Both are creatures, both are made  by God; they are things and things only, and are not even the shrines of  a deity. They may be used as emblems of God in some of His attributes;  they do not even furnish any indication of His special presence, for He  is equally present where sun and light are not. \"The darkness hideth not  from Thee; but the night shineth as the day: the darkness and the light  are both alike to Thee.\"    The worship of the sun and of other heavenly bodies is one of the sins  most unsparingly denounced in Scripture. It was one of the first  warnings of the Book of Deuteronomy that Israel as a people were to take  heed \"lest thou lift up thine eyes unto heaven, and when thou seest the  sun, and the moon, and the stars, even all the host of heaven, shouldest  be driven to worship them and serve them,\" and the utter overthrow of  the nation was foretold should they break this law. And as for the  nation, so for the individual, any \"man or woman that hath wrought  wickedness in the sight of the Lord thy God, in transgressing His  covenant and hath gone and served other gods, and worshipped them,  either the sun, or moon, or any of the host of heaven\" was when  convicted of working \"such abomination\" unsparingly to be put to death.    Yet with all this, sun-worship prevailed in Israel again and again. Two  of the reforming kings of Judah, Asa and Josiah, found it necessary to  take away \"the sun-images;\" indeed, the latter king found that the  horses and chariots which his predecessors, Manasseh and Amon, had  dedicated to sun worship were kept at the very entrance to the temple.  In spite of his reformation, however, the evil spread until the final  corruption of Jerusalem was shown in vision to Ezekiel, \"Seventy men of  the ancients\"--that is the complete Sanhedrim--offered incense to  creeping things and abominable beasts; the women wept for Tammuz,  probably the sun-god in his decline to winter death; and deepest  apostasy of all, five and twenty men, the high-priest, and the chief  priests of the twenty-four courses, \"with their backs toward the temple  of the Lord, and their faces toward the east; and they worshipped the  sun toward the east.\" The entire nation, as represented in its chief  members in State, Society, and Church, was apostate, and its ruin  followed. Five years more and the temple was burned and Jerusalem  destroyed, and in captivity and exile the nation learned to abhor the  idolatry that had brought about its overthrow.    Four words are translated \"sun\" in our Authorized Version. Of these one,  used Job xxxi. 26, should really be \"light,\" as in the margin--\"If I  beheld the light when it shined,\"--though the sun is obviously meant.  The second word is one used in poetry chiefly in conjunction with a  poetical word for the moon, and refers to the sun's warmth, as the other  does to the whiteness of the moon. Thus the Bride in the Song of Solomon  is described as \"fair as the moon, clear as the sun.\" The third word  has given use to some ambiguity. In the eighth chapter of Judges in the  Authorized Version, it is stated that \"Gideon, the son of Joash,  returned from the battle before the sun was up,\" but in the Revised  Version that he \"returned from the battle from the ascent of Heres.\"  There was a mount [H.]eres, a mount of the sun, in the portion of the  Danites held by the Amorites, but that cannot have been the [H.]eres of  Gideon. Still the probability is that a mount sacred to the sun is meant  here as well as in the reference to the Danites; though _[h.]eres_ as  meaning the sun itself occurs in the story of Samson's riddle, for the  men of the city gave him the answer to it which they had extorted from  his wife, \"before the sun (_[h.]eres_) went down.\" _Shemesh_, the  _Samas_ of the Babylonians, is the usual word for the sun; and we find  it in Beth-shemesh, the \"house of the sun,\" a Levitical city within the  tribe of Judah, the scene of the return of the ark after its captivity  amongst the Philistines. There was another Beth-shemesh in Naphtali on  the borders of Issachar, and Jeremiah prophesies that Nebuchadnezzar  \"shall break also the images of Beth-shemesh, that is in the land of  Egypt,\" probably the obelisks of the sun in On, or Heliopolis. It was  from this city that Joseph, when vizier of Egypt, took his wife, the  daughter of the high priest there. The images of the sun, and of Baal as  the sun-god, seem to have been obelisks or pillars of stone, and hence  had to be \"broken down\"; whilst the Asherah, the \"groves\" of the  Authorized Version, the images of Ashtoreth as the moon-goddess, were  wooden pillars, to be \"cut\" or \"hewn down.\"    Another \"city of the sun\" in the land of Egypt is also mentioned by  Isaiah, in his prophecy of the conversion and restoration of the  Egyptians. \"Five cities in the land of Egypt shall speak the language of  Canaan, and swear to the Lord of hosts; one shall be called The city of  destruction;\" lit. of _[H.]eres_, or of the sun. It was upon the  strength of this text that Onias, the son of Onias the high priest,  appealed to Ptolemy Philometer to be allowed to build a temple to  Jehovah in the prefecture of Heliopolis (the city of the sun), and  obtained his permission to do so, B.C. 149.[68:1]    The epithet applied to the sun in Cant. vi. already quoted, \"Clear as  the sun,\" may be taken as equivalent to \"spotless.\" That is its ordinary  appearance to the naked eye, though from time to time--far more  frequently than most persons have any idea--there are spots upon the sun  sufficiently large to be seen without any optical assistance. Thus in  the twenty years from 1882 to 1901 inclusive, such a phenomenon occurred  on the average once in each week. No reference to the existence of  sun-spots occurs in Scripture. Nor is this surprising, for it would not  have fallen within the purpose of Scripture to record such a fact. But  it is surprising that whilst the Chinese detected their occasional  appearance, there is no distinct account of such an observation given  either on Babylonian tablets or by classical or mediaeval writers.    The achievement of the Chinese in this direction is very notable, for  the difficulty of looking directly at the sun, under ordinary  circumstances is so great, and the very largest sunspots are so small as  compared with the entire disc, that it argues great perseverance in  watching such appearances on the part of the Chinese, for them to have  assured themselves that they were not due to very small distant clouds  in our own atmosphere.    It has often been the subject of comment that light is mentioned in Gen.  i. as having been created on the first day, but the sun not until the  fourth. The order is entirely appropriate from an astronomical point of  view, for we know that our sun is not the only source of light, since it  is but one out of millions of stars, many of which greatly exceed it in  splendour. Further, most astronomers consider that our solar system  existed as a luminous nebula long ages before the sun was formed as a  central condensation.    But the true explanation of the creation of light being put first is  probably this--that there might be no imagining that, though gross solid  bodies, like earth and sea, sun and moon might require a Creator, yet  something so ethereal and all-pervading as light was"]]]
