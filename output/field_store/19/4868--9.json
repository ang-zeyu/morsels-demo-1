With Brighteye's curiosity was  mingled not a little wonderment, for the shrew's furry coat presented a  strange contrast of black above and white beneath, and, immediately  after the shrew had dived, a hundred little bubbles, adhering to the  ends of his hair, caused him to appear like a silvery grey phantom,  gliding gracefully, though erratically, from stone to stone, from patch  to patch of water-weed, from ripple to ripple near the surface of the  stream. The young brown trout, hovering harmlessly above the rocky  shelves and in the sandy shallows, far from being a source of terror to  Brighteye, fled at his approach, and seldom returned to their haunts  till he had reached the far side of the current. Emboldened by the  example of the shrew, that sometimes made a raid among the minnows, and  desirous of keeping all intruders away from the lower entrance to his  burrow, Brighteye habitually chased the trout if they ventured within  the little bay before his home. But there was one trout, old and lean,  whose haunt was behind a weed-covered stone at the throat of the pool,  and of this hook-beaked, carnivorous creature, by which he had once been  chased and bitten, Brighteye went in such constant fear that he avoided  the rapid, and, directly he caught a glimpse of the long, dark form  roving through the gloomy depths, paddled with utmost haste to his  nearest landing place.    Since, under the care of his mother, he made his earliest visit to the  reed-bed, Brighteye had seen hundreds of giant salmon; the restless  fish, however, did not stay long in the pool, but after a brief sojourn  passed upward. Often at dusk the salmon would leap clear into the air  just as Brighteye came to the surface after his first dive, and once so  near was a sportive fish that the vole became confused for the moment by  the sudden turmoil of the \"rise,\" and rocked on the swell of the  back-wash like a boat on the waves of a tossing sea. During the summer  Brighteye had suffered nothing, beyond this one sudden fright, from the  visits of the great silvery fish to the neighbourhood of his home; and,  notwithstanding his experience, he was accustomed to dive boldly into  the depths of the \"hovers,\" and even to regard without fear the approach  of an unusually inquisitive salmon. Late in the autumn, however,  Brighteye noticed, with unaccountable misgiving, a distinct change in  the appearance of these passing visitors. The silvery sheen had died  away from their scales, and had been succeeded by a dark, dull red; and  the fish were sluggish and ill-tempered. Besides, they were so numerous,  especially after a heavy rainfall, that the stream seemed barely able  to afford them room in their favourite \"hovers,\" and the old trout,  previously an easy master of the situation, found it almost beyond his  powers to keep trespassers from his particular haunt in mid-current at  the throat of the pool. So occupied was he with this duty that he seldom  roamed into the little bays beneath the alder-fringes; and Brighteye, so  long as he avoided the rapid, was fairly safe from his attack. The  reed-bed, though partly submerged, still yielded the vole sufficient  food; and to reach it straight from his home he had to pass through the  shallows, which extended for a considerable distance up-stream and  down-stream from the gravelly stretch immediately outside the reeds.    About the beginning of winter, when the migration of the salmon had  become intermittent, and the sea-trout had all passed upward beyond the  pool, two of the big, ugly \"red fish,\" late arrivals at the \"hover\"  nearest the burrow, made a close inspection of the pool; then, instead  of following their kindred to the further reaches, they fell back toward  the tail of the stream and there remained. After the first week of  their stay, Brighteye found them so ill-tempered that he dared not  venture anywhere near the tail of the stream; and, as the big trout at  the top of the pool showed irritation at the least disturbance, the vole  was forced to wander down the bank, to a spot below the salmon, before  crossing the river on his periodical journeys to the reed-bed. His  kindred, still living in the burrow where he had been born, were  similarly daunted; while the shrew became the object of such frequent  attack--especially from the bigger of the two salmon, an old male with a  sinister, pig-like countenance and a formidable array of teeth--that  escape from disaster was little short of miraculous.    Having calculated to a nicety his chances of escape, and having decided  to avoid at all times the haunts of the pugnacious fish, Brighteye was  seldom inconvenienced, except that he had to pass further than hitherto  along the bank before taking to the water, and thus had to risk attack  from weasels and owls. But soon, to his dismay, he discovered that the  salmon had shifted their quarters to the shallow close by the reeds. He  was swimming one night as usual into the quiet water by the reed-bed,  and, indeed, had entered a narrow, lane-like opening among the stems,  when he felt a quick, powerful movement in the water, and saw a  mysterious form turn in pursuit of him, and glide swiftly away with a  mighty effort that caused a wave to ripple through the reeds, while the  outer stalks bent and recoiled as if from the force of a powerful blow.  On the following night he was chased almost to the end of the opening  among the reeds, and barely escaped; but this time he recognised his  pursuer. Afterwards, having unexpectedly met the shrew, he crept with  his companion along by the water's edge as far as the ford, and spent  the dark hours in a strange place, till at dawn he crossed the rough  water, and sought his home by a path the further part of which he had  not previously explored.          IV.    SAVED BY AN ENEMY.      The days were dim and the nights long, and thick, drenching mists hung  over the gloomy river. The salmon's family affairs had reached an  important stage; and the \"redd,\" furrowed in the gravel by the mated  fish, contained thousands of newly deposited eggs. And, as many of the  river-folk, from the big trout to the little water-shrew, continually  threatened a raid on the spawn, the salmon guarded each approach to the  shallows with unremitting vigilance.    It happened, unfortunately for Brighteye, that, while the construction  of the \"redd\" was in progress, some of the eggs--unfertilised and  therefore not heavy enough to sink to the bottom of the water--were  borne slowly by the current to the ford below the pool, just as the  shrew was occupied there in vain attempts to teach the vole how to hunt  for insects among the pebbles.    If Brighteye had been at all inclined to vary his diet, he would at that  moment have yielded to temptation. Everywhere around him the trout were  exhibiting great eagerness, snapping up the delicacies as they drew  near, and then moving forward on the scent in the direction of the  \"redd.\" The shrew joined in the quest; and Brighteye, full of curiosity,  swam beside his playmate in the wake of the hungry trout. The vole found  quite a shoal of fish collected near the reeds; and for a few moments he  frolicked about the edge of the shallow. He could see nothing of the old  male salmon, though he caught a glimpse of the female busy with her  maternal duties at the top of the \"redd.\"    After diving up-stream and along by the line of the eager trout, he rose  to breathe at the surface, when, suddenly, the river seemed alive with  trout scattering in every direction, a great upheaval seemed to part the  water, and he himself was gripped by one of his hind-feet and dragged  violently down and across to the deep \"hover\" near his home. The salmon  had at last outwitted the vole. The current was strong, and beneath its  weight Brighteye's body was bent backwards till his fore-paws rested on  the salmon's head. Mad with rage and fright, he clawed and bit at the  neck of his captor. Gradually his strength was giving way, and for want  of air he was losing consciousness, when, like a living bolt, Lutra, the  otter, to save unwittingly a life that she had erstwhile threatened,  shot from the darkness of the river-bed, and fixed her teeth in the neck  of the salmon scarcely more than an inch from the spot to which the vole  held fast in desperation. In the struggle that ensued, and ended only  when Lutra had carried her prey to shore, Brighteye, half suffocated and  but faintly apprehending what had taken place, was released. Like a cork  he rose to the surface, where he lay outstretched and gasping, while the  current carried him swiftly to the ford, and thence to the pool beneath  the village gardens. Having recovered sufficiently to paddle feebly  ashore, he sat for a time in the safe shelter of a rocky ledge,  unnoticed by the brown rats as they wandered through the tall, withered  grass-clumps high above his hiding place. At last he got the better of  his sickness and fright; and, notwithstanding the continued pain of his  scarred limbs, he brushed his furry coat and limped homeward just as the  dawn was silvering the grey, silent pool where the lonely salmon guarded  the \"redd\" and waited in vain for the return of her absent mate.    Brighteye took to heart his own escape from death, and for several  nights moped and pined, ate little, and frequented only a part of the  river-bank in proximity to his burrow. As soon, however, as the tiny  scars on his leg were healed, he ventured again to the river; and for a  period danger seldom threatened him. While he was unceasingly vigilant,  and always ready to seek with utmost haste the safety of his home, a new  desire to take precautions against the probability of attack possessed  him. When, at dusk, he stole out from the upper entrance of his  dwelling, he crouched "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29362"],[0,"The Goat-gland Transplantation (#12)"],[1,"ted. As a wife or companion for the home the woman  was worse than useless. Her life was so miserable that all who came in  contact with her were made miserable, also. She was unsexed, and one of  the \"sparks of life\" had been taken away. She assumed characteristics of  the male. If the testes of a man are removed he will assume the  characteristics of a woman. Many changes will take place. His mind is no  longer clear, he tires easily, cannot concentrate upon any subject, and  has marked loss of memory and of physical well being. The things that  once appealed to him are now undesirable. The opposite sex are repulsive  and he shuns their society. A man or woman who suffers the premature  loss of their glands of regeneration will become more or less defective  mentally and their life will be materially shortened.    At one time a favorite expression was, \"A man is as old as his  arteries.\" We know better than this now. A man is just as old as he  feels, when said feeling is directed to his sex organs. The first sign  of old age is impotency, and more men are reaching a premature impotency  than ever before in the history of the world. Their glands are burning  up, as it were. After impotency is well on its way arterio-sclerosis or  hardening of the arteries is noticed, then the mental inefficiency, as  well as physical weakness. Right on the heels of impotency comes  prostatitis. I was taught in medical school that nearly all men suffered  from an enlarged prostate and prostatitis: that it was one of the  diseases of \"old age\"; that we were heir to it and might expect it to  show up after the age of 45. I was also taught that arterio-sclerosis  was another disease of old age, and all men were heir to it. However, we  are beginning to awaken to a few things. We are approaching the dawn of  a new day. We are beginning to understand the whys and wherefores. While  I have been criticized and called everything under the sun, except an  angel, I expected as much, and I am ready to face the world with my  facts; not theories. I have a long and hard fight before me yet.    [Illustration: THE TOGGENBURG GOATS]    The cures that I have effected by gland transplantation up to the  present time are enough to justify me for all of my work and efforts  along this new line of science. Should I never operate again, I feel  justly repaid and know that I have started something that will go on and  on and live forever. Gland transplantation for the cure of disease  within the next ten years will be as common as the removal of a diseased  appendix is now. You can hardly pick up a daily paper without reading an  account of some surgeon performing a wonderful operation of  transplanting bone or tissue from some animal to replace that which was  diseased in the human. Why not borrow what we need from the animal? We  use their flesh for food. We also use their gland substances in the  fresh or dried form to supply our bodies with whatever we may not  possess.    My first efforts in gland transplantation were directed towards the cure  of sterility. A man came to me who had been impotent for sixteen years.  Every known means had been used in his case. My experiments in the use  of glands from animal to animal, led me to believe that if the gland  from a goat could be transplanted into the human body this impotency and  sterility could be overcome. This man was willing to try anything as he  was 46 and his wife was 42. They were very anxious for a male child.  Twelve months after the transplantation I delivered his wife of a  10-pound baby boy, who is alive and well today. In appreciation of what  the goat glands had done for them they named the baby \"Billy.\" He lives  within four miles of me now. This first case being a wonderful success  encouraged me to experiment with humans on a larger scale. Willing  subjects were not easy to obtain. After obtaining, it was difficult to  operate. The operation or experiment could not be performed in any of  the general hospitals. Ethics as well as country and little town gossip  forbid such work. It was necessary for me to build a hospital of my own  so that my experiments could be carried on without the public or  profession knowing anything about them. If good results were obtained I  could announce to the world; if none were obtained the matter could be  dropped. After four male children had been born, due directly to gland  transplantation, the news leaked out, and has swept the world like  wildfire. While I was transplanting glands for sterility, other  beneficial effects were noted by me as well as my patients. Now, since I  have transplanted glands into more than 600 men and women it is an easy  matter to give some comprehensive statistics. A complete record is kept  of each case and follow-up letters are used so that we are in a pretty  fair way to estimate just what we are doing. Five cases of insanity have  been cured to date. The great difficulty in obtaining insane people for  operation is, they are confined in a state institution, and the  authorities will not permit their removal, especially when their loved  ones tell the \"higher ups\" they wish Dr. Brinkley, \"the gland man,\" to  transplant goat glands. \"Oh, no, it's all rot and will never do!\"  However, we have operated upon five cases and have cured five cases.  After awhile we will break down this great wall of prejudice, and insane  people will be ordered out for this operation. At present when habeas  corpus proceedings are all that will obtain the release, and gland  transplantation is the object, not much of a chance exists. I am going  to mention one of our very interesting cases, as the man lives only  about 15 or 20 miles from me in Dickinson County, Kansas. His name is  Lon Jones, and his case is known far and wide within the state of  Kansas. My writing about Mr. Jones will not be the betrayal of a  professional secret. He is anxious for the world to know about it. Some  six weeks or two months before I was called to see him he was stricken  suddenly, insane. He had mounted his horse and was driving his cattle  home for the night when it was noticed by others that he acted \"queer.\"  He began to whip and fight his steed as well as the cattle unmercifully.  He dismounted or fell off his horse and at first was thought  unconscious. A physician was called, another, and another, and his case  was diagnosed as Dementia Praecox. Violent in character. He wanted to  kill his doctor, or commit some rash act. One of the first acts was to  try and give away all of his land and stock as well as corn and feed.    It was unsafe for his wife and children to be near him. Men remained  with him, day and night. Finally his guards had to tie him in bed. His  arms and feet were securely fastened, as well as his body, to a heavy  iron bed. Application for his entry into the state institution had been  made when I was called. With the assistance of neighbor men he was  conducted into my hospital here. Immediate gland transplantation was  performed, and three days after said operation he asked me to remove his  irons so that he could rest comfortably. He informed me that he was in  his right mind and we need have no further fear of him. Soon afterwards  he was permitted to roam around the building and over town. He went home  more than a year ago and is transacting his business as a sane man  should. No evidence of his former trouble has occurred. He did not know  until the day that we discharged him what my line of treatment had been.  Another notable case was that of a man who had spent 11 years of his  life in three state institutions for the insane in New York. He left  here entirely cured and is now holding an important position in New York  City. Another case was that of a young man who became insane suddenly.  His first act was to try and murder his father and mother, his greatest  bitterness being directed towards his mother. He attempted to kill me  when I approached him, and it was necessary to open a bottle of  chloroform and stand at a safe distance and throw the anesthetic in his  face and eyes. Less than a week after the operation he was in his right  mind, and has been so since. Another case of a young man who became  insane and was violent. He secured a number of rifles and shotguns and  barricaded himself in a corn field. When he learned I had been sent for  he was worse than ever, and if it had not been for his mother I would  have been killed. I operated upon him immediately, and for one week  after the operation I could not visit him. However, he soon was in his  right mind, and when it was told to him what he had done he went to  Indianapolis, Ind., and secured a position. His shame was so great that  he could not remain where he was known. After two years he returned home  and resumed work where he had left off. The fifth case was just as  interesting as the above.    I have operated upon and cured 5 cases of locomotor-ataxia. It is almost  impossible for me to get cases of locomotor-ataxia. When a man writes me  he also asks his family physician, who very quickly informs him \"there  is nothing to it; it's all bunk!\"    My cases have ranged in age from 18 to 75 years. My patients that are  from 60 to 75 years of age write me they feel as they did when they were  boys 18 years of age. I have transplanted glands for almost every  conceivable disease and have received splendid results in almost every  case. All cannot be cured, but all of them can be greatly benefited. At  this writing I have with me as a patient a noted United States Senator  from Washington, D.C. He has been treated by Dr. Cary T. Grayson, the  president's personal physician, as well as taking 3 years of treatment  at Johns Hopkins Hospital. He is depressed and discouraged. He speaks of  suicide. He has been operated on only two days and I venture to say that  before his week is passed he will be a different man.    My greatest number of men come for"]]]
