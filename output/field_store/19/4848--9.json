In Mecklenburg, this same goddess is known as Frau Gode, or Wode, the  female form of Wuotan or Odin, and her appearance is always considered  the harbinger of great prosperity. She is also supposed to be a great  huntress, and to lead the Wild Hunt, mounted upon a white horse,  her attendants being changed into hounds and all manner of wild beasts.    In Holland she was called Vrou-elde, and from her the Milky Way is  known by the Dutch as Vrou-elden-straat; while in parts of Northern  Germany she was called Nerthus (Mother Earth). Her sacred car was  kept on an island, presumably Ruegen, where the priests guarded it  carefully until she appeared to take a yearly journey throughout  her realm to bless the land. The goddess, her face completely hidden  by a thick veil, then sat in this car, which was drawn by two cows,  and she was respectfully escorted by her priests. When she passed,  the people did homage by ceasing all warfare, and laying aside their  weapons. They donned festive attire, and began no quarrel until  the goddess had again retired to her sanctuary. Then both car and  goddess were bathed in a secret lake (the Schwartze See, in Ruegen),  which swallowed up the slaves who had assisted at the bathing, and  once more the priests resumed their watch over the sanctuary and  grove of Nerthus or Hlodyn, to await her next appearance.    In Scandinavia, this goddess was also known as Huldra, and boasted of  a train of attendant wood-nymphs, who sometimes sought the society of  mortals, to enjoy a dance upon the village green. They could always  be detected, however, by the tip of a cow's tail which trailed from  beneath their long snow-white garments. These Huldra folk were the  special protectors of the cattle on the mountain-sides, and were said  to surprise the lonely traveller, at times, by the marvellous beauty  of the melodies they sang to beguile the hours at their tasks.              CHAPTER IV: THOR      The Thunderer    According to some mythologists, Thor, or Donar, is the son of Joerd  (Erda) and of Odin, but others state that his mother was Frigga,  queen of the gods. This child was very remarkable for his great size  and strength, and very soon after his birth amazed the assembled  gods by playfully lifting and throwing about ten great bales of bear  skins. Although generally good-tempered, Thor would occasionally fly  into a terrible rage, and as he was very dangerous at these times, his  mother, unable to control him, sent him away from home and entrusted  him to the care of Vingnir (the winged), and of Hlora (heat). These  foster-parents, who are also considered as the personification of  sheet-lightning, soon managed to control their troublesome charge, and  brought him up so wisely, that the gods entertained a very grateful  recollection of their kind offices. Thor himself, recognising all he  owed them, assumed the names of Vingthor and Hlorridi, by which he  is also known.                                  \"Cry on, Vingi-Thor,      With the dancing of the ring-mail and the smitten shields of war.\"                Sigurd the Volsung (William Morris).      Having attained his full growth and the age of reason, Thor was  admitted to Asgard among the other gods, where he occupied one of the  twelve seats in the great judgment hall. He was also given the realm  of Thrud-vang or Thrud-heim, where he built a wonderful palace called  Bilskirnir (lightning), the most spacious in all Asgard. It contained  five hundred and forty halls for the accommodation of the thralls,  who after death were welcomed to his home, where they received equal  treatment with their masters in Valhalla, for Thor was the patron  god of the peasants and lower classes.          \"Five hundred halls      And forty more,      Methinketh, hath      Bowed Bilskirnir.      Of houses roofed      There's none I know      My son's surpassing.\"                Saemund's Edda (Percy's tr.).      As he was god of thunder, Thor alone was never allowed to pass over  the wonderful bridge Bifroest, lest he should set it aflame by the  heat of his presence; and when he wished to join his fellow gods by  the Urdar fountain, under the shade of the sacred tree Yggdrasil, he  was forced to make his way thither on foot, wading through the rivers  Kormt and Ormt, and the two streams Kerlaug, to the trysting place.    Thor, who was honoured as the highest god in Norway, came second in  the trilogy of all the other countries, and was called \"old Thor,\"  because he is supposed by some mythologists to have belonged to an  older dynasty of gods, and not on account of his actual age, for he  was represented and described as a man in his prime, tall and well  formed, with muscular limbs and bristling red hair and beard, from  which, in moments of anger, the sparks flew in showers.          \"First, Thor with the bent brow,        In red beard muttering low,        Darting fierce lightnings from eyeballs that glow,      Comes, while each chariot wheel      Echoes in thunder peal,        As his dread hammer shock        Makes Earth and Heaven rock,      Clouds rifting above, while Earth quakes below.\"                Valhalla (J. C. Jones).      The Northern races further adorned him with a crown, on each point  of which was either a glittering star, or a steadily burning flame,  so that his head was ever surrounded by a kind of halo of fire,  his own element.        Thor's Hammer    Thor was the proud possessor of a magic hammer called Mioelnir  (the crusher) which he hurled at his enemies, the frost-giants,  with destructive power, and which possessed the wonderful property  of always returning to his hand, however far away he might hurl it.          \"I am the Thunderer!      Here in my Northland,      My fastness and fortress,      Reign I forever!        \"Here amid icebergs      Rule I the nations;      This is my hammer,      Mioelnir the mighty;      Giants and sorcerers      Cannot withstand it!\"                Saga of King Olaf (Longfellow).      As this huge hammer, the emblem of the thunderbolts, was generally  red-hot, the god had an iron gauntlet called Iarn-greiper, which  enabled him to grasp it firmly. He could hurl Mioelnir a great distance,  and his strength, which was always remarkable, was doubled when he  wore his magic belt called Megin-gioerd.          \"This is my girdle:      Whenever I brace it,      Strength is redoubled!\"                Saga of King Olaf (Longfellow).      Thor's hammer was considered so very sacred by the ancient Northern  people, that they were wont to make the sign of the hammer, as the  Christians later taught them to make the sign of the cross, to ward  off all evil influences, and to secure blessings. The same sign  was also made over the newly born infant when water was poured over  its head and a name given. The hammer was used to drive in boundary  stakes, which it was considered sacrilegious to remove, to hallow  the threshold of a new house, to solemnise a marriage, and, lastly,  it played a part in the consecration of the funeral pyre upon which  the bodies of heroes, together with their weapons and steeds, and,  in some cases, with their wives and dependents, were burned.    In Sweden, Thor, like Odin, was supposed to wear a broad-brimmed hat,  and hence the storm-clouds in that country are known as Thor's hat, a  name also given to one of the principal mountains in Norway. The rumble  and roar of the thunder were said to be the roll of his chariot, for  he alone among the gods never rode on horseback, but walked, or drove  in a brazen chariot drawn by two goats, Tanngniostr (tooth-cracker),  and Tanngrisnr (tooth-gnasher), from whose teeth and hoofs the sparks  constantly flew.          \"Thou camest near the next, O warrior Thor!      Shouldering thy hammer, in thy chariot drawn,      Swaying the long-hair'd goats with silver'd rein.\"                Balder Dead (Matthew Arnold).      When the god thus drove from place to place, he was called Aku-thor,  or Thor the charioteer, and in Southern Germany the people, fancying  a brazen chariot alone inadequate to furnish all the noise they heard,  declared it was loaded with copper kettles, which rattled and clashed,  and therefore often called him, with disrespectful familiarity,  the kettle-vendor.        Thor's Family    Thor was twice married; first to the giantess Iarnsaxa (iron stone),  who bore him two sons, Magni (strength) and Modi (courage), both  destined to survive their father and the twilight of the gods,  and rule over the new world which was to rise like a phoenix from  the ashes of the first. His second wife was Sif, the golden-haired,  who also bore him two children, Lorride, and a daughter named Thrud,  a young giantess renowned for her size and strength. True to the  well-known affinity of contrast, Thrud was wooed by the dwarf Alvis,  whom she rather favoured; and one evening, when this suitor, who,  being a dwarf, could not face the light of day, presented himself in  Asgard to sue for her hand, the assembled gods did not refuse their  consent. They had scarcely signified their approbation, however, when  Thor, who had been absent, suddenly appeared, and casting a glance of  contempt upon the puny lover, declared he would have to prove that his  knowledge atoned for his small stature, before he could win his bride.    To test Alvis's mental powers, Thor then questioned him in the  language of the gods, Vanas, elves, and dwarfs, artfully prolonging  his examination until sunrise, when the first beam of light, falling  upon the unhappy dwarf, petrified him. There he stood, an enduring  example of the gods' power, to serve as a warning to all other dwarfs  who might dare to test it.          \"Ne'er in human bosom      Have I found so many      Words of the old time.      Thee with subtlest cunning      Have I yet befooled.      Above ground standeth thou, dwarf      By day art overtaken, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2850"],[0,"The Wars of the Jews; Or, The History of the Destruction of Jerusalem (#12)"],[1,"people  of that country had revolted, and were in arms, who came very cunningly  to their leader, and besought him to conceal his treacherous intentions  by an obliging behavior to them; accordingly, he at first made them  presents; and afterward, as they went away, laid ambushes for them; and  when they were come to one of the maritime cities called Ecdippon, they  perceived that a plot was laid for them; for they were there informed  of the promise of a thousand talents, and how Antigonus had devoted the  greatest number of the women that were there with them, among the five  hundred, to the Parthians; they also perceived that an ambush was always  laid for them by the barbarians in the night time; they had also been  seized on before this, unless they had waited for the seizure of Herod  first at Jerusalem, because if he were once informed of this treachery  of theirs, he would take care of himself; nor was this a mere report,  but they saw the guards already not far off them.    5. Nor would Phasaelus think of forsaking Hyrcanus and flying away,  although Ophellius earnestly persuaded him to it; for this man had  learned the whole scheme of the plot from Saramalla, the richest of  all the Syrians. But Phasaelus went up to the Parfilian governor, and  reproached him to his face for laying this treacherous plot against  them, and chiefly because he had done it for money; and he promised him  that he would give him more money for their preservation, than Antigonus  had promised to give for the kingdom. But the sly Parthian endeavored to  remove all this suspicion by apologies and by oaths, and then went [to  the other] Pacorus; immediately after which those Parthians who were  left, and had it in charge, seized upon Phasaelus and Hyrcanus, who  could do no more than curse their perfidiousness and their perjury.    6. In the mean time, the cup-bearer was sent [back], and laid a plot how  to seize upon Herod, by deluding him, and getting him out of the city,  as he was commanded to do. But Herod suspected the barbarians from the  beginning; and having then received intelligence that a messenger,  who was to bring him the letters that informed him of the treachery  intended, had fallen among the enemy, he would not go out of the city;  though Pacorus said very positively that he ought to go out, and meet  the messengers that brought the letters, for that the enemy had not  taken them, and that the contents of them were not accounts of any plots  upon them, but of what Phasaelus had done; yet had he heard from others  that his brother was seized; and Alexandra 20 the shrewdest woman in the  world, Hyrcanus's daughter, begged of him that he would not go out, nor  trust himself to those barbarians, who now were come to make an attempt  upon him openly.    7. Now as Pacorus and his friends were considering how they might bring  their plot to bear privately, because it was not possible to circumvent  a man of so great prudence by openly attacking him, Herod prevented  them, and went off with the persons that were the most nearly related to  him by night, and this without their enemies being apprized of it. But  as soon as the Parthians perceived it, they pursued after them; and as  he gave orders for his mother, and sister, and the young woman who was  betrothed to him, with her mother, and his youngest brother, to make the  best of their way, he himself, with his servants, took all the care they  could to keep off the barbarians; and when at every assault he had slain  a great many of them, he came to the strong hold of Masada.    8. Nay, he found by experience that the Jews fell more heavily upon him  than did the Parthians, and created him troubles perpetually, and this  ever since he was gotten sixty furlongs from the city; these sometimes  brought it to a sort of a regular battle. Now in the place where Herod  beat them, and killed a great number of them, there he afterward built  a citadel, in memory of the great actions he did there, and adorned it  with the most costly palaces, and erected very strong fortifications,  and called it, from his own name, Herodium. Now as they were in their  flight, many joined themselves to him every day; and at a place called  Thressa of Idumea his brother Joseph met him, and advised him to ease  himself of a great number of his followers, because Masada would not  contain so great a multitude, which were above nine thousand. Herod  complied with this advice, and sent away the most cumbersome part of his  retinue, that they might go into Idumea, and gave them provisions  for their journey; but he got safe to the fortress with his nearest  relations, and retained with him only the stoutest of his followers; and  there it was that he left eight hundred of his men as a guard for the  women, and provisions sufficient for a siege; but he made haste himself  to Petra of Arabia.    9. As for the Parthians in Jerusalem, they betook themselves to  plundering, and fell upon the houses of those that were fled, and upon  the king's palace, and spared nothing but Hyrcanus's money, which was  not above three hundred talents. They lighted on other men's money also,  but not so much as they hoped for; for Herod having a long while had  a suspicion of the perfidiousness of the barbarians, had taken care to  have what was most splendid among his treasures conveyed into Idumea,  as every one belonging to him had in like manner done also. But the  Parthians proceeded to that degree of injustice, as to fill all the  country with war without denouncing it, and to demolish the city  Marissa, and not only to set up Antigonus for king, but to deliver  Phasaelus and Hyrcanus bound into his hands, in order to their being  tormented by him. Antigonus himself also bit off Hyrcanus's ears with  his own teeth, as he fell down upon his knees to him, that so he might  never be able upon any mutation of affairs to take the high priesthood  again, for the high priests that officiated were to be complete, and  without blemish.    10. However, he failed in his purpose of abusing Phasaelus, by reason of  his courage; for though he neither had the command of his sword nor of  his hands, he prevented all abuses by dashing his head against a stone;  so he demonstrated himself to be Herod's own brother, and Hyrcanus a  most degenerate relation, and died with great bravery, and made the end  of his life agreeable to the actions of it. There is also another  report about his end, viz. that he recovered of that stroke, and that  a surgeon, who was sent by Antigonus to heal him, filled the wound with  poisonous ingredients, and so killed him; whichsoever of these deaths  he came to, the beginning of it was glorious. It is also reported that  before he expired he was informed by a certain poor woman how Herod had  escaped out of their hands, and that he said thereupon, \"I now die with  comfort, since I leave behind me one alive that will avenge me of mine  enemies.\"    11. This was the death of Phasaelus; but the Parthians, although they  had failed of the women they chiefly desired, yet did they put the  government of Jerusalem into the hands of Antigonus, and took away  Hyrcanus, and bound him, and carried him to Parthia.              CHAPTER 14.           When Herod Is Rejected In Arabia, He Makes Haste To Rome       Where Antony And Caesar Join Their Interest To Make Him King   .    1. Now Herod did the more zealously pursue his journey into Arabia, as  making haste to get money of the king, while his brother was yet alive;  by which money alone it was that he hoped to prevail upon the covetous  temper of the barbarians to spare Phasaelus; for he reasoned thus with  himself:--that if the Arabian king was too forgetful of his father's  friendship with him, and was too covetous to make him a free gift, he  would however borrow of him as much as might redeem his brother, and  put into his hands, as a pledge, the son of him that was to be redeemed.  Accordingly he led his brother's son along with him, who was of the age  of seven years. Now he was ready to give three hundred talents for his  brother, and intended to desire the intercession of the Tyrians, to get  them accepted; however, fate had been too quick for his diligence;  and since Phasaelus was dead, Herod's brotherly love was now in vain.  Moreover, he was not able to find any lasting friendship among the  Arabians; for their king, Malichus, sent to him immediately, and  commanded him to return back out of his country, and used the name of  the Parthians as a pretense for so doing, as though these had denounced  to him by their ambassadors to cast Herod out of Arabia; while in  reality they had a mind to keep back what they owed to Antipater, and  not be obliged to make requitals to his sons for the free gifts the  father had made them. He also took the impudent advice of those who,  equally with himself, were willing to deprive Herod of what Antipater  had deposited among them; and these men were the most potent of all whom  he had in his kingdom.    2. So when Herod had found that the Arabians were his enemies, and this  for those very reasons whence he hoped they would have been the most  friendly, and had given them such an answer as his passion suggested,  he returned back, and went for Egypt. Now he lodged the first evening at  one of the temples of that country, in order to meet with those whom he  left behind; but on the next day word was brought him, as he was going  to Rhinocurura, that his brother was dead, and how he came by his death;  and when he had lamented him as much as his present circumstances could  bear, he soon laid aside such cares, and proceeded on his journey. But  now, after some time, the king of Arabia repented of what he had done,  and sent presently away messengers to call him back: Herod had prevented  them, and was come to Pelusium, where he could not obtain a passage from  those that lay with the fleet, so he besought their"]]]
