I might have been--God knows what, now!\"    Even as the three men looked, the cloud closed in upon the land.  Strangely enough, it shunned the surface of the water. The travellers  cast their eyes upon the sullen bosom of the Gopher lake. This body of  water glittered like the scales of a leaden serpent. It looked from that  great height poisonous and discontented. Swift gazed upon it intently.    \"Why? Wouldn't they have you?\" inquired Mr. Ticks, absent-mindedly of  the professor. \"See! Haven't we struck another current?\"    As he spoke the huge _High Tariff_ swayed. A breath of chilly air smote  them. Then gently the balloon swung toward the Gopher lake--toward the  fateful city.    \"Well, you see, the balloon was too old-fashioned for them,\" answered  the professor, still bent upon his grievance. \"Now, if it had gone by  electricity that 'ud been another thing.\"    \"How so?\" asked Mr. Ticks, with polite interest.    \"Well! Everything in that gol-darned town went by electricity. They had  electric cars, electric lights, electric shampooing, electric cigars,  electric sewing machines, electric elevators, electric table service in  the hotel; worst was, they had electric cabs. They kept quiet about some  of their notions. Folks did say they had their reasons. I didn't hear  nothing about all this electric tomfoolery till I struck the city.\"    \"Ah!\" interrupted Mr. Ticks, pricking up his ears. \"I have heard about  those cabs, but I have had no reliable information that they were a  success.\"    \"They ain't!\" answered the professor, rubbing his right arm with a wince  of memory. \"Like a darn jack I took one for a spin. They go on three  wheels; one in front, two behind. The driver, he sits in front and  steers the shebang with the forward wheel. I hadn't gone two blocks when  I leaned out of the window and the current struck me in the arm like a  shot. You bet I yelled bloody murder and got out of that trap in two  shakes of a colt's tail.\"    \"How does all that electrical system work otherwise?\" asked Mr. Ticks  slowly, after some thought.    \"Everybody perfectly wild over it. They won't allow a horse in town, nor  even a ton of coal. Electricity is the big thing of the future. They  fight electrical duels. Feller that stands the greatest number of  alternating volts gets the apology. I saw a dog-fight in the street  stopped by the Humane Society. A man would drop a wet sponge on the  dog's head, another on his back, and turn on the circuit. They generally  both dropped and never knew what struck 'em. Two dead dogs better than  one fight. But they kept it all dark enough. These were jest  experiments, they said. When they were done that they were going to have  an electrical exhibition and invite the hull world. Why, I heard they  were fool enough to put in a bill in the Legislature to have the name of  Russell changed to Electra. As if Russell wasn't good enough for them!\"    Mr. Ticks mused over these facts. Why was it that his acquisitive mind  had not roamed over this field before? Perhaps because it was  acquisitive, not imaginative. _He_ could only account for the  unpardonable omission on the ground that there were so many new  competing Western cities, each with its peculiar advantages: and that  there were so many strange electrical inventions new each day, that he  had overlooked Russell and its progressive hobby. Besides, was he not on  the staff of a Democratic paper, which would, perhaps, on the whole,  prefer to ignore the new Republican State and its flourishing capital.    \"How was all this power produced if coal was excluded?\" asked Mr. Ticks.    \"Oh, windmills did that. A half a dozen huge windmills, with wings, each  as big as the _High Tariff_, were the first things you saw. They were  nearly three hundred feet high----\"    \"Good Heavens! Look, man! Look down there! Don't you see something in  the middle of the lake!\" Swift pulled the professor over to his side of  the car, and pointed directly below the balloon.    They had now struck a dead calm and the _High Tariff_ floated motionless  two thousand feet above the lake. Directly below them was something  resting upon the waters. It looked fixed and dead. A log? A wreck? A  raft? Slowly the outline took to itself the form of a boat.    \"Have you a pair of glasses here?\" asked Swift, all of a quiver.    The professor shoved one of Steward's field-glasses in his hand.    \"There's a body in that boat!\" cried Swift, after a prolonged  examination. \"No--Great God! It's alive! It moves! It's a _woman_!\"    The professor took a long look.    \"I guess you're right. She's a female!\"    \"But she must be saved,\" insisted Swift. \"We must save her.\"    \"Yes, Professor Ariel,\" said Mr. Statis Ticks, sententiously and with  trembling dignity; \"being a woman, she demands our attention, and,  besides, as a survivor she can give us the information and suggest the  figures we need.\"    \"I'll do my best, gentlemen,\" said the professor, shaking, his head,  \"but it's mighty ticklish business. Supposing we drift into the deadly  air. I don't know what that vapor means, but it evidently means the  'Sweet By and By.' Even the _High Tariff_ wouldn't save us then!\"    \"Look here, professor,\" jerked out Swift, peremptorily, \"it's got to be  done. Now dry up!\"    \"All right, it's a go. I can stand it if you can.\"    So the valve was opened cautiously, and the balloon with majestic  slowness, obedient to its master's hand, descended toward the Great  Gopher lake, and hovered over the cockle-shell upon its malignant  bosom.    As the _High Tariff_ approached the little boat, Mr. Ticks looked at it  eagerly.    \"She's alive and unmarried,\" said the oracle, slowly.    \"Why unmarried?\" asked Swift, with a vague flutter of the heart. He had  watched the figure of the woman attentively with the spyglass. It was  rounded and supple. Masses of dark-brown hair hid her shoulders and  face.    \"Because,\" answered Mr. Ticks, \"she is under eighteen. The statistics of  this section of the West show that no female over eighteen years of age  remains single.\"    The balloon had now descended to within three hundred feet of the boat.  The girl in it did not stir. She lay with her head propped in the bow,  so stiffly and so still that to all appearance she was a dead woman. But  the three men agreed they had seen her move. Had her rescuers arrived  too late?    \"Let down the ladder!\" cried Swift. \"I'll go down and pick her up!\"  Ignorant how hard it is even for an experienced hand to climb up and  down a rope ladder swinging in space, he clambered over the side of the  car.    \"Hold, young fellow!\" Professor Ariel spoke sharply. By this time they  were within two hundred feet of the water.    \"Hold, I say!\" yelled the professor in a rage, letting go the rope to  the safety-valve and at the same time, grabbing a sand-bag. \"If you stir  out of this car I'll pitch ballast out and you'll never see your gal  again!\"    Swift stopped short. The rope-ladder swayed like a double snake beneath  them. Its end was fifty feet above the boat, but, O horrors! It was also  nearly fifty feet to one side of the boat--no human power could reach  the lady from the ladder. A breath might blow the _High Tariff_ even  farther away.    At the same time the girl, doubtless aroused from her stupor by the  professor's loud call, opened her eyes slowly. Above her loomed a  gigantic monster. Was it a dream? Was this apparition a final terror  added to her awful experience, sent to crush out the last remnant of her  buoyant life and magnificent courage? She stared at the thing above her;  then opened her mouth and gave a scream, such as can only be the result  of full Western tracheal development.    \"Oh! don't be frightened!\" cried Swift quickly, \"Don't! We've come to  save you!\" He could not think of anything more to say; and it occurred  to him that he was a donkey to say anything.    But the professor, who had few delicate scruples, waved his hat and  shouted:    \"What's the matter with the _High Tariff_? She's all right!\"    This yell, so frequently heard on Eastern land and sea, had penetrated  even to the Great Gopher lake, and it reassured the girl more than  anything else could have done.    She sat up weakly enough in the boat, and, after waving her hand, with  feminine instinct tried to coil her hair and otherwise prepare herself  as best she could to receive these angels from the clouds.    \"Can you catch?\" yelled the professor.    \"Try me!\" came back a voice undaunted, though enfeebled by long  suffering.    The professor coiled a stout, light rope on his arm, shot out a few  thundering orders about safety-valves and ballast, and cautiously, but  with gymnastic quickness, descended the yielding rounds of the long  ladder.    To the lady in the boat, to the passengers in the car it seemed hours  before the professor reached the last of the two hundred rounds. It  might have been forty seconds.    Swift called out to the young lady encouragingly:    \"Hold out a little while longer and you'll be safe!\"    \"I'm all right now, since you have come.\" The young woman's trembling  voice seemed to lay an actual emphasis on \"you\" that Swift was selfish  enough to take to himself.    \"How long have you been there?\"    \"Five days. I am nearly dead!\"    \"Poor, poor thing!\" said Swift to himself. Tears of sympathy came into  his eyes. Even Mr. Ticks blinked.    \"She's office editor on some Russell daily,\" said Mr. Ticks after  another long look through the field glasses.    \"How do you know?\" asked Swift in displeasure.    \"She's got a stylograph behind her right ear and a yellow pad in her  lap; besides, there are some clippings at the bottom of the boat.\"    By this time Professor Ariel had reached the lower end of his ladder.    \"Now, catch!\" he cried, hurling the light rope with sure skill. It  whistled through the air and the end fell across the boat.    \"Make fast to "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33687"],[0,"Illustrative Anecdotes of the Animal Kingdom (#12)"],[1,"and of a yellowish tinge above. Besides the difference in  external appearance, there is a remarkable distinction between the  brown and the polar bears; for the former prefers, as his abode, the  wooded summits of alpine regions, feeding principally on roots and  vegetables; while the latter fixes his residence on the sea-coast, or  on an iceberg, and seems to delight in the stormy and inhospitable  precincts of the arctic circle, where vegetation is scarcely known to  exist, feeding entirely on animal matter. But it cannot be regarded as  a predatory quadruped, for it seems to prefer dead to living animal  food, its principal subsistence being the floating carcasses of whales.  It also preys upon seals, which it catches with much keenness and  certainty, as they ascend to the surface of the ocean to breathe; and  sometimes fish are caught by them, when they enter shoals or gulfs.  They move with great dexterity in the water, and capture their prey  with apparent ease. It is only when these bears quit their winter  quarters, and especially when the female has to protect her young, that  they manifest great ferocity.    While the Carcass, one of the ships of Captain Phipps's voyage of  discovery to the north pole, was locked in the ice, early one morning  the man at the mast-head gave notice that three bears were making their  way very fast over the Frozen Ocean, and were directing their course  towards the ship. They had no doubt been invited by the scent of some  blubber of a sea-horse, which the crew had killed a few days before,  and which, having been set on fire, was burning on the ice at the time  of their approach. They proved to be a she-bear and her two cubs; but  the cubs were nearly as large as the dam. They ran eagerly to the fire,  and drew out from the flames part of the flesh of the sea-horse that  remained unconsumed, and ate it voraciously.    The crew of the ship threw great lumps of the flesh they had still left  upon the ice, which the old bear fetched away singly, laying every  piece before the cubs as she brought it, and, dividing it, gave each a  share, reserving but a small portion to herself. As she was fetching  away the last piece, they levelled their muskets at the cubs, and shot  them both dead, at the same time wounding the dam in her retreat, but  not mortally. It would have drawn tears of pity from any but the most  unfeeling, to have marked the affectionate concern expressed by this  poor animal, in the dying moments of her expiring young. Though she was  sorely wounded, and could but just crawl to the place where they lay,  she carried the lump of flesh she had just fetched away, as she had  done the others, tore it in pieces, and laid it down before them. When  she saw they refused to eat, she laid her paws first upon the one, then  upon the other, and endeavored to raise them up, making, at the same  time, the most pitiable moans.    Finding she could not stir them, she went off, and, when she had got to  some distance, looked back, and moaned; and that not availing to entice  them away, she returned, and, smelling round them, began to lick their  wounds. She went off a second time, as before, and having crawled a few  paces, looked again behind her, and for some time stood moaning. But  still her cubs not rising to follow, she returned to them anew, and,  with signs of inexpressible fondness, went round, pawing them  successively. Finding, at last, that they were cold and lifeless, she  raised her head towards the ship, and growled a curse upon the  destroyers, which they returned with a volley of musket-balls. She fell  between her cubs, and died licking their wounds.    The polar bears are remarkably sagacious, as the following instances  may prove. Those in Kamtschatka are said to have recourse to a singular  stratagem, in order to catch the _bareins_, which are much too swift  of foot for them. These animals keep together in large herds; they  frequent mostly the low grounds, and love to browse at the base of  rocks and precipices. The bear hunts them by scent, till he comes in  sight, when he advances warily, keeping above them, and concealing  himself among the rocks, as he makes his approach, till he gets  immediately over them, and near enough for his purpose. He then begins  to push down, with his paws, pieces of rock among the herd below. This  manoeuvre is not followed by any attempt to pursue, until he finds he  has maimed one of the flock, upon which a course immediately ensues,  that proves successful, or otherwise, according to the hurt the barein  has received.    The captain of a Greenland whaler, being anxious to procure a bear  without injuring the skin, made trial of a stratagem of laying the  noose of a rope in the snow, and placing a piece of kreng within it. A  bear, ranging the neighboring ice, was soon enticed to the spot by the  smell of burning meat. He perceived the bait, approached, and seized it  in his mouth; but his foot, at the same time, by a jerk of the rope,  being entangled in the noose, he pushed it off with his paw, and  deliberately retired. After having eaten the piece he had carried away  with him, he returned. The noose, with another piece of kreng, having  been replaced, he pushed the rope aside, and again walked triumphantly  off with the bait. A third time the noose was laid; but, excited to  caution by the evident observations of the bear, the sailors buried the  rope beneath the snow, and laid the bait in a deep hole dug in the  centre. The animal once more approached, and the sailors were assured  of their success. But bruin, more sagacious than they expected, after  snuffing about the place for a few moments, scraped the snow away with  his paw, threw the rope aside, and again escaped unhurt with his prize.    A Greenland bear, with two cubs under her protection, was pursued  across a field of ice by a party of armed sailors. At first, she seemed  to urge the young ones to an increase of speed, by running before them,  turning round, and manifesting, by a peculiar action and voice, her  anxiety for their progress; but, finding her pursuers gaining upon  them, she carried, or pushed, or pitched them alternately forward,  until she effected their escape. In throwing them before her, the  little creatures are said to have placed themselves across her path to  receive the impulse, and, when projected some yards in advance, they  ran onwards, until she overtook them, when they alternately adjusted  themselves for another throw.    In the month of June, 1812, a female bear, with two cubs, approached  near a whale ship, and was shot. The cubs, not attempting to escape,  were taken alive. These animals, though at first very unhappy, became,  at length, in some measure reconciled to their situation, and, being  tolerably tame, were allowed occasionally to go at large about the  deck. While the ship was moored to a floe, a few days after they were  taken, one of them, having a rope fastened round his neck, was thrown  overboard. It immediately swam to the ice, got upon it, and attempted  to escape. Finding itself, however, detained by the rope, it endeavored  to disengage itself in the following ingenious way: Near the edge of  the floe was a crack in the ice, of considerable length, but only  eighteen inches or two feet wide, and three or four feet deep. To this  spot the bear turned, and when, on crossing the chasm, the bight of the  rope fell into it, he placed himself across the opening; then,  suspending himself by his hind feet, with a leg on each side, he  dropped his head and most part of his body into the chasm, and, with a  foot applied to each side of the neck, attempted, for some minutes, to  push the rope over his head. Finding this scheme ineffectual, he  removed to the main ice, and, running with great impetuosity from the  ship, gave a remarkable pull on the rope; then, going backwards a few  steps, he repeated the jerk. At length, after repeated attempts to  escape this way, every failure of which he announced by a significant  growl, he yielded himself to hard necessity, and lay down on the ice in  angry and sullen silence.    Like the brown and black bear, polar bears are animals capable of great  fierceness. Brentz, in his voyage in search of the north-east passage  to China, had horrid proofs of their ferocity in the Island of Nova  Zembla, where they attacked his seamen, seizing them in their mouth,  carrying them off with the utmost ease, and devouring them even in  sight of their comrades.    About twenty years ago, the crew of a boat belonging to a ship in the  whale fishery, shot at a bear some little distance off, and wounded  him. The animal immediately set up a dreadful howl, and scampered along  the ice towards the boat. Before he reached it, he had received a  second wound. This increased his fury, and he presently plunged into  the water, and swam to the boat; and, in his attempt to board it, he  placed one of his fore paws upon the gunwale, and would have gained his  point, had not one of the sailors seized a hatchet and cut it off. Even  this had not the effect of damping his courage; for he followed the  boat till it reached the ship, from whence several shots were fired at  him, which hit, but did not mortally wound him: he approached the  vessel, and ascended the deck, where, from his dreadful fury, he spread  such consternation, that all the crew fled to the shrouds, and he was  in the act of pursuing them thither, when an effective shot laid him  dead on the deck.      THE RACCOON.    This animal is peculiar to America. He resembles the bear, but is much  smaller and more elegantly formed. He is an active and lively animal;  an excellent climber of trees, in which the sharpness of his claws  greatly aids him; and he will even venture to the extremity of slender  branches. He is a good-tempered animal, and, consequently, easily  tamed; but his habit of prying into every thing renders"]]]
