He  then put an arm into one of the sleeves of that in dispute, and made an  apparently ineffectual endeavour to reach the other, following it round  amidst roars of laughter from all parts of the Court. It was a common  jury, and I was told that there was a tailor upon it, upon which I  suggested that there was a gentleman of the same profession as the  plaintiff in Court who might assist Sir Edwin. This was acceded to, and  out hopped a little Hebrew slop-seller from the Minories, to whom the  defendant submitted his body. With difficulty he got into the coat, and  then stood as if spitted, his back one mass of wrinkles. The tableau was  truly amusing; the indignant plaintiff looking at the performance with  mingled horror and disgust; Sir Edwin, as if he were choking; whilst the  juryman, with the air of a connoisseur, was examining him and the coat  with profound gravity. At last the judge, when able to stifle his  laughter, addressing the little Hebrew, said, 'Well, Mr. Moses, what do  you say?'--'Oh,' cried he, holding up a pair of hands not over clean,  and very different from those encased in lavender gloves which graced  the plaintiff, 'it ish poshitively shocking, my lord; I should have been  ashamed to turn out such a thing from my establishment.' The rest of the  jury accepted his view, and Sir Edwin, apparently relieved from  suffocation, entered his own coat with a look of relief, which again  convulsed the Court, bowed, and departed.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Financial prosecutions are as a rule very dreary, and any little joke  perpetrated by counsel during the course of them is a relief. One was  being heard, in which Mr. Muir was counsel, and to many of his  statements the junior counsel for the prosecution shook his head  vehemently, although he said nothing. This continual dumb contradiction  at length got on the customary patience of Mr. Muir, who blurted out: \"I  do not know why my friend keeps shaking his head, whether it is that he  has palsy, or that there's nothing in it!\"    Mr. Baldwin was the counsel employed to oppose a person justifying bail  in the Court of King's Bench. After some common questions, a waggish  counsel sitting near suggested that the witness should be asked as to  his having been a prisoner in Gloucester gaol. Mr. Baldwin thereon  boldly asked: \"When, sir, were you last in Gloucester gaol?\" The  witness, a respectable tradesman, with astonishment declared that he  never was in a gaol in his life. Mr. Baldwin being foiled after putting  the question in various ways, turned round to his friendly prompter, and  asked for what the man had been imprisoned. He was told that it was for  suicide. Thereupon Mr. Baldwin, with great gravity and solemnity  addressed the witness: \"Now, sir, I ask you upon your oath, and remember  that I shall have your words taken down, were you not imprisoned in  Gloucester gaol for suicide?\"    A young lawyer who had just \"taken the coif,\" once said to Samuel  Warren, the author of _Ten Thousand a Year_: \"Hah! Warren, I never could  manage to get quite through that novel of yours. What did you do with  Oily Gammon?\"--\"Oh,\" replied Warren, \"I made a serjeant of him, and of  course he never was heard of afterwards.\"    [Illustration: SAMUEL WARREN, Q.C., MASTER IN LUNACY.]           *       *       *       *       *    Warner Sleigh, a great thieves' counsel, was not debarred by etiquette  from taking instructions direct from his clients. One day, following a  rap on the door of his chambers in Middle Temple Lane, a thick-set man,  with cropped poll of unmistakably Newgate cut, slunk into the room, when  the following colloquy took place.    \"Mornin', sir,\" said the man, touching his forelock. \"Morning,\" replied  counsel. \"What do you want?\"--\"Well, sir, I'm sorry to say, sir, our  little Ben, sir, has 'ad a misfortin'; fust offence, sir, only a  'wipe'--\"--\"Well, well!\" interrupted counsel. \"Get on.\"--\"So, sir, we  thought as you've 'ad all the family business we'd like you to defend  'im, sir.\"--\"All right,\" said counsel; \"see my clerk--.\"--\"Yessir,\"  continued the thief; \"but I thought I'd like to make sure you'd attend  yourself, sir; we're anxious, 'cos it's little Ben, our youngest  kid.\"--\"Oh! that will be all right. Give Simmons the fee.\"--\"Well, sir,\"  continued the man, shifting about uneasily, \"I was going to arst you,  sir, to take a little less. You see, sir (wheedlingly), it's little  Ben--his first misfortin'.\"--\"No, no,\" said the counsel impatiently.  \"Clear out!\"--\"But, sir, you've 'ad all our business. Well, sir, if you  won't, you won't, so I'll pay you now, sir.\" And as he doled out the  guineas: \"I may as well tell you, sir, you wouldn't 'a' got the  'couties' if I 'adn't 'ad a little bit o' luck on the way.\"    The gravity of the Court of Appeal was once seriously disturbed by  Edward Bullen reading to them the following paragraph from a pleading in  an action for seduction: \"The defendant denies that he is the father of  the said twins, _or of either of them_.\" This he apologetically  explained was due to an accident in his pupil-room, but everyone  recognised the style of the master-hand.           *       *       *       *       *    Serjeant Adams, who acted as assistant judge at the sessions, had a very  pleasant wit, and knew how to deal with any counsel who took to  \"high-falutin.\" On one occasion, after an altercation with the judge,  the counsel for the prisoner in his address to the jury reminded them  that \"they were the great palladium of British Liberty--that it was  _their_ province to deal with the facts, the _judge_ with the law--that  they formed one of the great institutions of their country, and that  they came in with William the Conqueror.\" Adams at the end of his  summing up said: \"Gentlemen, you will want to retire to consider your  verdict, and as it seems you came in with the Conqueror you can now go  out with the beadle.\"    There was always a mystery how Edwin James, who at the Bar was earning  an income of at least L10,000 a year, was continually in monetary  difficulties. Like Sir Thomas Lawrence, he must have had some private  drain on his resources which was never disclosed. Among others who  suffered was the landlord of his chambers, whose rent was very much in  arrear. In the end the landlord hit upon a plan to discover which would  be the best method of recovering his rent, and one day asked James to  advise him on a legal matter in which he was interested, and thereupon  drew up a statement of his grievance against his own tenant. The paper  was duly returned to the landlord next day with the following sentence  subjoined: \"In my opinion this is a case which admits of only one  remedy--patience. Edwin James.\"    In a case before Lord Campbell, James took a line with a witness which  his lordship considered quite inadmissible, and stopped him. When  summing up to the jury Lord Campbell thought to soften his interruption  by saying: \"You will have observed, gentlemen, that I felt it my duty to  stop Mr. Edwin James in a certain line which he sought to adopt in the  cross-examination of one of the witnesses; but at the same time I had no  intention to cast any reflection on the learned counsel who I am sure is  known to you all as a most able--\" but before his lordship could proceed  any further James interposed, and in a contemptuous voice exclaimed: \"My  lord, I have borne your lordship's censure, spare me your lordship's  praise.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Mr. W. G. Thorpe, F.S.A., in his entertaining volume of _Middle Temple  Table Talk_, relates a curious story of a judge taking an extremely  personal interest in a case which was brought before him. A milk company  had sold off a lot of old stock to a cake-maker, and the cake-maker had  declined to pay because the milk had turned out to be poisonous. As the  case went on the judge became more and more exercised. \"What do they do  with this stuff?\" he asked, pointing to a mass of horrible mixture. \"Oh,  my lord, they make cakes of it; it doesn't taste in the cakes.\"--\"Where  do they sell these cakes?\" was the judge's next question, and the reply  was, \"They are used for certain railway stations, school-treats, and  excursions.\" Then the defendant specified one of the places. \"Bless me!\"  said the judge, turning an olive-green, \"I had some there myself,\" and  with a shudder he retired to his private room, returning in a few  minutes wiping his mouth.    There is another story of a counsel defending a woman on a charge of  causing the death of her husband by administering a poisoned cake to  him. \"I'll eat some of the cake myself,\" he said in Court, and took a  bite. Just at this moment a telegram was brought to him to say that his  wife was seriously ill, and he obtained permission to leave in order to  answer the message. He returned, finished his speech, and obtained the  acquittal of his client. It transpired afterwards that the telegram  business was arranged in order that counsel could obtain an emetic  after swallowing the cake.           *       *       *       *       *    Mr. Montagu Williams tells a story, in his interesting _Leaves of a  Life_, of two members of the Bar, one of whom had made a large fortune  by his practice, but worked too hard to enjoy his gains, while the  other, who only made a decent living, liked to enjoy life. They met on  one occasion at the end of a long vacation, and the rich man asked his  less fortunate brother what he had been doing. \"I have been on the  Continent,\" the other replied, \"and I enjoyed my holiday very much. What  have you been doing?\"--\"I have been working,\" said the rich Q.C., \"and  have not been out of town; I had lots of work to do.\"--\"What is the use  of it?\" queried the other; \"you can't"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3003"],[0,"Wild Flowers (#12)"],[1,"so on through a long list of  popular names for the most part testifying to the plant's virtue  as a love-philter, bridal token, and general cure-all, has now  become naturalized from the Old World on the Atlantic and Pacific  Slopes; and is rapidly appropriating waste arid cultivated ground  until, in many places, it is truly troublesome. In general habit  like the blue vervain, its flowers are more purplish than blue,  and are scattered, not crowded, along the spikes. The leaves are  deeply, but less acutely, cut.    Ages before Christians ascribed healing virtues to the vervain -  found growing on Mount Calvary, and therefore possessing every  sort of miraculous power, according to the logic of simple  peasant folk - the Druids had counted it among their sacred  plants. \"When the dog-star arose from unsunned spots\" the priests  gathered it. Did not Shakespeare's witches learn some of their  uncanny rites from these reverend men of old? One is impressed  with the striking similarity of many customs recorded of both.  Two of the most frequently used ingredients in witches' cauldrons  were the vervain and the rue. \"The former probably derived its  notoriety from the fact of its being sacred to Thor, an honor  which marked it out, like other lightning plants, as peculiarly  adapted for occult uses,\" says Mr. Thiselton Dyer in his  \"Folk-lore of Plants.\" \"Although vervain, therefore, as the  enchanter's plant, was gathered by witches to do mischief in  their incantations, yet, as Aubrey says, it 'hinders witches from  their will,' a circumstance to which Drayton further refers when  he speaks of the vervain as ''gainst witchcraft much avayling.'\"  Now we understand why the children of Shakespeare's time hung  vervain and dill with a horseshoe over the door.    In his eighth Eclogue, Virgil refers to vervain as a charm to  recover lost love. Doubtless this was the verbena, the herba  sacra employed in ancient Roman sacrifices, according to Pliny.  In his day the bridal wreath was of verbena, gathered by the  bride herself.    NARROW-LEAVED VERVAIN (V. angustifolia), like the blue vervain,  has a densely crowded spike of tiny purple or blue flowers that  quickly give place to seeds, but usually there is only one spike  at the end of a branch. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped,  acute, saw-edged, rough. From Massachusetts and Florida westward  to Minnesota and Arkansas one finds the plant blooming in dry  fields from June to August, after the parsimonious manner of the  vervain tribe.    It is curious that the vervain, or verbena, employed by brides  for centuries as the emblem of chastity, should be one of the  notorious botanical examples of a willful hybrid. Generally, the  individuals of distinct species do not interbreed; but verbenas  are often difficult to name correctly in every case because of  their susceptibility to each other's pollen - the reason why the  garden verbena may so easily be made to blossom forth into  whatever hue the gardener wills. His plants have been obtained,  for the most part, from the large-flowered verbena, the beautiful  purple, blue, or white species of our Western States (V.  Canadensis) crossed with brilliant-hued species imported from  South America.      MAD-DOG SKULLCAP or HELMET-FLOWER; MAD-WEED; HOODWORT    (Scutellaria lateriflora)  Mint family    Flowers - Blue, varying to whitish; several or many, 1/4 in.  long, growing in axils of upper leaves or in 1-sided spike-like  racemes. Calyx 2-lipped, the upper lip with a helmet-like  protuberance; corolla 2-lipped; the lower, 3-lobed lip spreading;  the middle lobe larger than the side ones. Stamens, 4, in pairs,  under the upper lip; upper pair the shorter; one pistil, the  style unequally cleft in two. Stem: Square, smooth, leafy,  branched, 8 in. to 2 ft. high. Leaves: Opposite, oblong to  lance-shaped, thin, toothed, on slender pedicles, 1 to 3 in.  long, growing gradually smaller toward top of stem. Fruit: 4  nutlets.  Preferred Habitat - Wet, shady ground.  Flowering Season - July-September.  Distribution - Uneven throughout United States and the British  Possessions.    By the helmet-like appendage on the upper lip of the calyx, which  to the imaginative mind of Linnaeus suggested Scutellum (a little  dish), which children delight to spring open for a view of the  four tiny seeds attached at the base when in fruit, one knows  this to be a member of the skullcap tribe, a widely scattered  genus of blue and violet two-lipped flowers, some small to the  point of insignificance, like the present species, others showy  enough for the garden, but all rich in nectar, and eagerly sought  by bees. The wide middle lobe of the lower lip forms a convenient  platform on which to alight; the stamens in the roof of a newly  opened blossom dust the back of the visitor as he explores the  nectary; and as the stamens of an older flower wither when they  have shed their pollen, and the style then rises to occupy their  position, it follows that, in flying from the top of one spike of  flowers to the bottom of another, where the older ones are, the  visitor, for whom the whole scheme of color, form, and  arrangement was planned, deposits on the sticky top of the style  some of the pollen he has brought with him and so  cross-fertilizes the flower. When the seeds begin to form and the  now useless corolla drops off, the helmet-like appendage on the  top of the calyx enlarges and meets the lower lip, so enclosing  and protecting the tiny nutlets. After their maturity, either the  mouth gapes from dryness, or the appendage drops off altogether,  from the same cause, to release the seeds. Old herb doctors, who  professed to cure hydrophobia with this species, are responsible  for its English misnomer.    Perhaps the most beautiful member of the genus is the SHOWY  SKULLCAP (S. serrata), whose blue corolla, an inch long, has its  narrow upper lip shorter than the spreading lower one. The  flowers are set opposite each other at the end of the smooth  stem, which rises from one to two feet high in the woods  throughout a southerly and westerly range. As several other  skullcaps have distinctly saw-edged leaves, this plant might have  been given a more distinctive adjective, thinks one who did not  have the naming of 200,000 species!    Above dry, sandy soil from New York and Michigan southward the  HAIRY SKULLCAP (S. pilosa) lifts short racemes of blue flowers  that are only half an inch long, and whose lower lip and lobes at  either side are shorter than the arched upper lip. Most parts of  the plant are covered with down, the lower stem being especially  hairy; and this fact determines the species when connected with  its rather distant pairs of indented, veiny leaves, ranging from  oblong to egg-shaped, and furnished with petioles which grow  gradually shorter toward the top, where pairs of bracts, seated  on the stem, part to let the flowers spring from their axils.    The LARGER or HYSSOP SKULLCAP (S. integrifolia) rarely has a dent  in its rounded oblong leaves ,which, like the stem, are covered  with fine down. Its lovely, bright blue flowers, an inch long,  the lips of about equal length, are grouped opposite each other  at the top of a stem that never lifts them higher than two feet;  and so their beauty is often concealed in the tall grass of  roadsides and meadows and the undergrowth of woods and thickets,  where they bloom from May to August, from southern New England to  the Gulf of Mexico, westward to Texas.    This tribe of plants is almost exclusively North American, but  the hardy MARSH SKULLCAP or HOODED WILLOW-HERB (S. galericulata),  at least, roams over Europe, and Asia also, with the help of  runners, as well as seeds that, sinking into the soft earth of  swamps and the borders of brooks, find growth easy. The blue  flowers which grow singly in the axils of the upper leaves are  quite as long as those of the larger and the showy skullcaps; the  oblong, lance-shaped leaves, which are mostly seated on the  branching stem, opposite each other, have low teeth. Why do  leaves vary as they do, especially in closely allied species?  \"The causes which have led to the different forms of leaves have  been, so far as I know,\" says Sir John Lubbock, \"explained in  very few cases: those of the shapes and structure of seeds are  tolerably obvious in some species, but in the majority they are  still entirely unexplained; and, even as regards the blossoms  themselves, in spite of the numerous and conscientious labors of  so many eminent naturalists, there is as yet no single species  thoroughly known to us.\"      GROUND IVY or JOY; GILL-OVER-THE-GROUND; FIELD BALM; CREEPING  CHARLIE    (Glecoma hederacea; Nepeta Glechoma of Gray)  Mint family    Flowers - Light bluish purple, dotted with small specks of  reddish violet; growing singly or in clusters along stem, seated  in leaf axils; calyx hairy, with 5 sharp teeth; corolla tubular,  over 1/2 in. long, 2-lipped, the upper lip 2-lobed, lower lip  with 3 spreading lobes, middle one largest; 4 stamens in pairs  under upper lip; the anther sacs spreading; pistil with 2-lobed  style. Stem: Trailing, rooting at intervals, sometimes 18 in.  long, leafy, the branches ascending. Leaves: From 1/2 to 1 1/2  in. across; smooth, rounded, kidney-shaped, scallop-edged.  Preferred Habitat - Waste places, shady ground.  Flowering Season - March-May.  Distribution - Eastern half of Canada and the United States, from  Georgia and Kansas northward.    Besides the larger flowers, containing both stamens and pistils,  borne on this little immigrant, smaller female flowers,  containing a pistil only, occur just as they do in thyme, mint,  marjoram, and doubtless other members of the great family to  which all belong. Muller attempted to prove that these small  flowers, being the least showy, are the last to be visited by  insects, which, having previously dusted themselves with pollen  from the stamens of "]]]
