She had taxed herself to the uttermost, beyond nature's  power to recuperate. In November she returned to Washington, and  enjoyed the sweet presence and tender care of her daughters until she  passed away on Feb. 18, 1872.      THE LADIES' NATIONAL COVENANT.    After the war was fairly inaugurated, the manufactories of the country  largely turned their attention to the production of material required  by the army, which, combined with the immense number of volunteers  from such avocations, and the rise in prices of all home manufactures,  created an immense import of foreign goods, which, pouring into our  country when gold was at the highest, brought to our doors a danger no  less formidable than that of the Rebellion. It was shown from official  returns, in 1863, that during a period of nine months, the imports, at  the port of New York alone, amounted to $160,000,000 in gold; equal,  including exchange, freight, insurance, etc., to twice that sum, while  our exports amounted to only $120,000,000 in paper.    This ruinous state of our trade brought on us the taunts of foreign  enemies, and roused the attention of the country to devise some method  of meeting the new danger; Congress temporarily raised duties fifty  per cent. in hopes of stemming the tide of importation. The patriotic  women of the nation, ever on the alert for methods of aiding the  country, early in 1864 called a meeting of the loyal women of  Washington, at which time an association, pledging women to the use of  home manufactures, was formed under the name of \"The Ladies' National  Covenant,\" with offices in every State and Territory within the  national lines. Mrs. General Jas. Taylor was elected President; Mrs.  Stephen A. Douglas, Vice-President; Mrs. Rebecca Gillis and Miss  Virginia Smith, Recording Secretaries; with ten Corresponding  Secretaries, of whom Mrs. H. C. Ingersoll was the most active.    This association, formed for the purpose of encouraging domestic  manufactures, was composed at its first meeting of the wives of  members of the Cabinet and of Senators and Representatives, women of  fashion, popular authoresses, mothers who had lost their sons, and  wives who had lost their husbands. An Advisory and Organizing  Committee was appointed, consisting of women from each State and  Territory within the national line. An ADDRESS TO THE WOMEN OF AMERICA  was issued, and a constitution consisting of eleven sections, together  with the following pledge, was adopted:                                    THE PLEDGE.         For three years, or during the war, we pledge ourselves to each       other and the country, to purchase no imported goods where those       of American manufacture can be obtained, such as \"dress goods of       velvet, silks, grenadines, India crape, and imported organdies,       India lace and broche shawls, fine wrought laces and       embroideries, watches and precious stones, hair ornaments, fans,       artificial flowers and feathers, carpets, furniture, silks and       velvets, painted china, ormolu, bronze, marble, ornaments, and       mirrors.\"    The emblem of this Covenant was a black or gilt bee, worn as a pin  fastening the national colors, upon the hair, arm, or bosom, as a  public recognition of membership. In August of the same year the  Secretary stated that orders for the emblem, the badge of the  Covenant, were received by the manufacturer of the pin from all parts  of the Union. A meeting was held in New York, rooms opened in Great  Jones Street, and the Covenant was in a fair way to assume large  proportions. When Lee's capitulation was announced the necessity for  the Covenant ended, and with peace, trade was allowed to drift into  its natural channels.      ANNA ELIZABETH DICKINSON.    Foremost among the women who understood the political significance of  the great conflict, was Miss Dickinson, a young girl of Quaker  ancestry, who possessed remarkable oratorical power, a keen sense of  justice, and an intense earnestness of purpose. In the heated  discussions of Anti-Slavery Conventions, she had acquired a clear  comprehension of the province of laws and constitutions; of the  fundamental principles of governments, and the rights of man. Like a  meteor, she appeared suddenly in the political horizon, as if born for  the eventful times in which she lived, and inspired by the dangers  that threatened the life of the republic.    At the very beginning of the war her radical utterances were heard at  different points in her native State.[31] Her admirable speech on the  higher law, first made at Kennett Square, and the discussion that  followed, in which Miss Dickinson maintained her position with  remarkable clearness and coolness for one of her years, were a  surprise to all who listened. The flattering reports of this meeting  in several of the Philadelphia journals introduced her at once to the  public.    On the evening of February 27, 1861, she addressed eight hundred  people in Concert Hall, Philadelphia. This was her first appearance  before so large an assembly, and the first time she had the sole  responsibility of entertaining an audience for an entire evening. She  spoke two full hours extemporaneously, and the lecture was pronounced  a success, not only by the press, but by the many notables and  professional men present. Although it was considered a marvelous  performance for a young girl, Miss Dickinson herself was mortified, as  she said, with the length of her speech and its lack of point, order,  and arrangement.    Soon after, she entered the United States Mint, to labor from seven  o'clock in the morning to six at night. Although she was ever faithful  to her duties and skillful in everything she undertook, soon becoming  the most rapid adjuster in the Mint, her radical criticisms on the war  and its leaders cost her the loss of the place. At a meeting just  after the battle of Ball's Bluff, in summing up the record, after  exonerating Stone and Baker, she said, \"Future history will show that  this battle was lost not through ignorance and incompetence, but  through the treason of the commanding general, George B. McClellan,  and time will vindicate the truth of my assertion.\" She was hissed all  over the house, though some cried, \"Go on!\" \"Go on!\" She repeated this  startling assertion three times, and each time was hissed.    When Gen. McClellan was running against Lincoln in 1864, after she had  achieved a world-wide reputation, she was sent by the Republican  Committee of Pennsylvania to this same town, to speak to the same  people, in the same hall. In again summing up the incidents of the  war, when she came to Ball's Bluff, she said, \"I say now, as I said  three years ago, history will record that this battle was lost, not  through ignorance or incompetence, but through the treason of the  commanding general, George B. McClellan.\" \"And time has vindicated  your assertion,\" was shouted all over the house.    It was the speech made in 1861, that cost her her place in the mint,  for while laboring there daily with her hands, her mind was not  inactive nor indifferent to the momentous events transpiring about  her. She kept a close watch of the progress of the war, and the policy  of the Republican leaders. When ex-Governor Pollock dismissed her, he  admitted that his reason was that Westchester speech, for at that time  McClellan was the idol of the nation.[32]    With remarkable prescience all through the war, and the period of  reconstruction, Miss Dickinson took the advance position. Wendell  Phillips used to say that \"she was the young elephant sent forward to  try the bridges to see if they were safe for older ones to cross.\"  When wily politicians found that her criticisms were applauded by  immense audiences, they gained courage to follow her lead. As popular  thought was centering everywhere on national questions, Miss Dickinson  thought less of the special wrongs of women and negroes and more of  the causes of revolutions and the true basis of government; hence she  spoke chiefly on the political aspects of the war, and thus made  herself available in party politics at once.    In the intervals of public speaking, she made frequent visits to the  Government hospitals, and became a most welcome guest among our  soldiers. In long conversations with them, she learned their  individual histories, experiences, hardships, and sufferings; the  motives that prompted them to go into the army; what they saw there;  what they thought of war in their hours of solitude, away from the  camp and the battle-field. Thus she acquired an insight into the  soldier's life and feelings, and from these narratives drew her  materials for that deeply interesting lecture on hospital life, which  she delivered in many parts of the country.    This lecture, given in Concord, New Hampshire, in the autumn of 1862,  was the turning-point of her fortunes. In this speech she proved  slavery to be the cause of the war, that its continuance would result  in prolonged suffering to our soldiers, defeat to our armies, and the  downfall of the Republic. She related many touching incidents of her  experiences in hospital life, and drew such vivid pictures of the  horrors of both war and slavery, that by her pathos and logic, she  melted her audience to tears, and forced the most prejudiced minds to  accept her conclusions.    It was on this occasion that the Secretary of the State Central  Committee heard her for the first time. He remarked to a friend at the  close of the lecture, \"If we can get this girl to make that speech all  through New Hampshire we can carry the Republican ticket in the coming  election.\" Fully appreciating her magnetic power over an audience, he  resolved at once, that if the State Committee refused to invite her,  he should do so on his own responsibility. But through his influence  she was invited by the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28056"],[0,"Music and Some Highly Musical People (#12)"],[1,"     Mendelssohn dull, and Beethoven pretty, without knowing why       she likes or dislikes any thing. She yawns at an oratorio,       is bored at a concert, and only enjoys opera because she       knows everybody that sits in the boxes.\"    Besides, I think a mistake is made in compelling girls to learn to  play only the piano-forte. There are other instruments, for  performance upon which many of them have talents. Nor need such  performance detract from a graceful, ladylike appearance. I mention,  for example, the harp, the violin, and, indeed, all the stringed  instruments, and even others. But on this point another says,--         \"A recent number of the London 'Queen' contains an article       recommending the violin as an instrument peculiarly       appropriate for the use of ladies. It protests against the       custom of teaching girls to play the piano-forte only,       arguing that they should have a larger field in music. There       is certainly no reason why girls may not gracefully handle       the bow; and it is stated in the article referred to, that       they 'can learn the violin in half the time that boys       can,'--a statement which indicates that a goodly number of       girls somewhere have had the opportunity of learning. In       this age of progress, girls may certainly have a choice of       instruments, and an opportunity to pursue the delightful art       of music in whatever way they choose. If taste or fancy       incline them to wind-instruments, why should they not try       them?\"    Mr. Dwight, in his \"Journal of Music,\" very justly and considerately  discourses of the utility of violin accomplishment, and the  adaptability of the instrument to womanly practice. He says,         \"We have always wondered, that in a community where so much       attention is paid to music, and where almost every girl and       boy is taught to thrum the piano, so few acquire, or even       seek to acquire, the art of playing on the violin. The       piano, to be sure, is a more representative instrument,       enabling one pair of hands to grasp the whole harmony of a       composition, or a compendium thereof; but the violin, with       the other members of its family, viola, 'cello, &c., is the       more social instrument, bringing together groups of kindred       spirits who can play in parts, and read together the       quartets, &c., of the greatest masters, or play sonata duos,       trios, &c., with the piano-forte. And the string-instruments       are infinitely the most expressive: their tones lie nearer       to the soul, spring more directly from the human breast.       They are the heart of the whole orchestra, the most       essential part of music, next to the human voice. It is a       graceful, manly, healthy exercise, to play the violin. If it       be very difficult to play it like an artist, so much the       worthier of a manly aspiration. If it is often only vulgar       _fiddling_, it is, on the other hand, with those truly       schooled, the most gentlemanly of instruments. And we       maintain that it is equally the most womanly. We have many       times expressed our interest in female violinists. Who that       has seen and heard Camilla Urso, or Teresa Liebe, or Mr.       Eichberg's accomplished pupil, Persis Bell, could fail to       feel that the violin seemed peculiarly fitted to the female       constitution and capacity? How graceful the attitude and       motions of a young woman skilfully handling the bow! Her       finer sense of touch, her delicate tact, her instinctive       feeling-out of the pure truth of tone, give woman a great       advantage in this art; and the several examples we have had       from time to time in the concerts of the Boston Conservatory       of Music have shown that this was no mere dream.\"    But the limits of this book will not permit me to go much farther into  this alluring subject. I shall therefore close this chapter by a brief  reference to those who occupy the really noble positions of teachers  of the sublime art of music.    He whose own mind has been illumined and whose own soul has been  especially cheered and enlarged by the various contemplations, the  studies and conceptions, of art, will not, in fact can not, hide his  light for his own selfish enjoyment, but will seek to brighten the way  of such as wish to learn its beauty, power, and uses. And how  honorable, how enviable, is the mission of such a one as he who  imparts to his fellows a knowledge of the beautiful science of music,  leading them, through all the delighting, soul-filling forms of  melody, into the region of a very fairy-land!    And finally, as giving fitting expression to the estimation in which  the true musician is held by all intelligent people, I append this  elegant tribute by Dr. Burgh:--    \"The physician who heals diseases, and alleviates the anguish of the  body, certainly merits a more conspicuous and honorable place; but the  musician who eminently soothes our sorrows, and innocently diverts the  mind in health, renders his memory deservedly dear to the grateful and  refined part of mankind in every civilized nation.\"          V.    ELIZABETH TAYLOR GREENFIELD,    THE FAMOUS SONGSTRESS;    OFTEN CALLED    THE \"BLACK SWAN.\"         \"A damsel with a dulcimer         In a vision once I saw:       It was an Abyssinian maid;       And on her dulcimer she played,         Singing of Mount Abora.\"         COLERIDGE.         \"Hovering swans....         Carol sounds harmonious.\"         CALLIMACHUS' _Hymn to Apollo_.      In giving a brief sketch of the life of the celebrated cantatrice,  Miss Greenfield, the writer is somewhat embarrassed by the amount and  richness of the materials at his command. For it would require far too  much space to give all, or even a considerable portion, of the many  press notices, criticisms, incidents, and the various items of  interest, that are connected with her remarkable career; while to  judiciously select from among the same a few, so that, while justice  is done the subject, the interest of the reader may not be  lessened, is far from being an easy task, albeit it is a pleasant one.  I find, indeed, that the pages of the public journals fairly teemed  with praises of the great prima donna, as she was frequently called by  them. The musical world was startled, intensely delighted,  electrified, by her notes of sweetest melody. Her magnificent voice,  in its great range in both the upper and lower registers, was regarded  as nothing short of wonderful. Those who at first were incredulous  soon became convinced of this, and were fairly taken captive; while  the always friendly ones, especially those with whom Miss Greenfield  was most closely identified, felt the keenest pleasure and most  unbounded pride in her great triumphs.    [Illustration: ELIZABETH TAYLOR GREENFIELD.]    All this was chronicled by the press, and formed the theme of constant  conversation and correspondence. Many testimonials from persons in  this country skilled in music and of fine general culture, as well as  others from the Queen of England and several of the English nobility,  were among her rich possessions, and were so great in number and so  flattering in character as to have made hers almost, if indeed not  altogether, an exceptional case.    These strong evidences of approval did not, however, make Miss  Greenfield vain. The natural simplicity of her character remained  unchanged. All the many exhibitions of great public and private  admiration, and the praises that her performances constantly evoked,  while of course affording her much pleasure, served mainly as impulses  to newer and higher efforts in her chosen and beloved profession. Nor  was her disposition less tried by the many difficulties that often  formed in her pathway. Of these I need not speak here. But amidst  them all this noble lady and artist was ever brave, patient, hopeful,  ambitious in a certain sense, yet modest.    Fully aware of the magnificent quality of her voice, and of its  phenomenal character; singing a higher and a lower note than either of  her great contemporaries,--Parodi, Kate Hayes, and Jenny Lind,--she  yet did not rest content, as most persons under the same circumstances  would have done, with the enthusiastic plaudits elicited by her  performances, but diligently applied herself to a scientific  cultivation of a voice in natural power well-nigh marvellous, as well  as to acquiring a scholarly knowledge of the principles of general  music. In this commendable course she met with remarkable success,  considering the circumstances by which she was surrounded.    And now, quoting at times largely from her \"Biography,\" I proceed to  give the following sketch of the career of this remarkable queen of  song.    Elizabeth Taylor Greenfield, better known perhaps by her musical  sobriquet, the \"Black Swan,\" was born in Natchez, Miss., in the year  1809. When but a year old she was brought to Philadelphia by an  exemplary Quaker lady, by whom she was carefully reared. Between these  two persons there ever existed the warm affection that is felt by  mother and daughter. In the year 1844 this good lady died. In her will  the subject of this sketch was remembered by a substantial legacy. The  will, however, formed the subject of a long legal contest; and I  believe Miss Greenfield never received the bequest.    Her family name was Taylor; but, in honor of her guardian, she took  the latter's name,--Greenfield.         \"Previous to the death of this lady, Elizabeth had become       distinguished in the limited circle in which she was known       for her remarkable powers of voice. Its tender, thrilling       tones often lightened the weight of age in one who was by       her beloved as a mother.         \"By indomitable perseverance she surmounted difficulties       almost invincible. At first she taught herself crude       accompaniments to"]]]
