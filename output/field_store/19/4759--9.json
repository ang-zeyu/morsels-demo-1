He looked into Frigga's eyes, and he  told her that he would strive to learn how he might fight the battle for  the Gods.    The two went into the boat and they rowed away. They came near to King  Hrauding's realm. They saw the castle overlooking the sea. Then Geirrod  did a terrible thing. He turned the boat back toward the sea, and he  cast the oars away. Then, for he was well fit to swim the roughest sea  and climb the highest cliffs, he plunged into the water and struck out  toward the shore. And Agnar, left without oars, went drifting out to  sea.    Geirrod climbed the high cliffs and came to his father's castle.    King Hrauding, who had given up both of his sons for lost, was rejoiced  to see him. Geirrod told of Agnar that he had fallen out of the boat on  their way back and that he had been drowned. King Hrauding, who had  thought both of his sons were gone from him, was glad enough that one  had come safe. He put Geirrod beside him on the throne, and when he died  Geirrod was made King over the people.    And now Odin, having drunk from Mimir's Well, went through the kingdoms  of men, judging Kings and simple people according to the wisdom he had  gained. He came at last to the kingdom that Geirrod ruled over. Odin  thought that of all the Kings he had judged to be noble, Geirrod would  assuredly be the noblest.    He went to the King's house as a Wanderer, blind of one eye, wearing a  cloak of dark blue and with a wanderer's staff in his hands. As he drew  near the King's house men on dark horses came riding behind him. The  first of the men did not turn his horse as he came near the Wanderer,  but rode on, nearly trampling him to the ground.    As they came before the King's house the men on the dark horses shouted  for servants. Only one servant was in the stable. He came out and took  the horse of the first man. Then the others called upon the Wanderer to  tend their horses. He had to hold the stirrups for some of them to  dismount.    Odin knew who the first man was. He was Geirrod the King. And he knew  who the man who served in the stable was. He was Agnar, Geirrod's  brother. By the wisdom he had gained he knew that Agnar had come back to  his father's kingdom in the guise of a servant, and he knew that  Geirrod did not know who this servant was.    They went into the stable together. Agnar took bread and broke it and  gave some to the Wanderer. He gave him, too, straw to seat himself on.  But in a while Odin said, \"I would seat myself at the fire in the King's  hall and eat my supper of meat.\"    \"Nay, stay here,\" Agnar said. \"I will give you more bread and a wrap to  cover yourself with. Do not go to the door of the King's house, for the  King is angry today and he might repulse you.\"    \"How?\" said Odin. \"A King turn away a Wanderer who comes to his door! It  cannot be that he would do it!\"    \"Today he is angry,\" Agnar said. Again he begged him not to go to the  door of the King's house. But Odin rose up from the straw on which he  was seated and went to the door.    A porter, hunchbacked and with long arms, stood at the door. \"I am a  Wanderer, and I would have rest and food in the King's hall,\" Odin said.    \"Not in this King's hall,\" said the hunchbacked porter. He would have  barred the door to Odin, but the voice of the King called him away. Odin  then strode into the hall and saw the King at table with his friends,  all dark-bearded, and cruel-looking men. And when Odin looked on them he  knew that the boy whom he had trained in nobility had become a King over  robbers.    \"Since you have come into the hall where we eat, sing to us, Wanderer,\"  shouted one of the dark men. \"Aye, I will sing to you,\" said Odin. Then  he stood between two of the stone pillars in the hall and he sang a song  reproaching the King for having fallen into an evil way of life, and  denouncing all for following the cruel ways of robbers.    \"Seize him,\" said the King, when Odin's song was finished. The dark men  threw themselves upon Odin and put chains around him and bound him  between the stone pillars of the hall. \"He came into this hall for  warmth, and warmth he shall have,\" said Geirrod. He called upon his  servants to heap up wood around him. They did this. Then the King, with  his own hand, put a blazing torch to the wood and the fagots blazed up  around the Wanderer.    The fagots burned round and round him. But the fire did not burn the  flesh of Odin All-Father. The King and the King's friends stood round,  watching with delight the fires blaze round a living man. The fagots all  burned away, and Odin was left standing there with his terrible gaze  fixed upon the men who were so hard and cruel.    They went to sleep, leaving him chained to the pillars of the hall. Odin  could have broken the chains and pulled down the pillars, but he wanted  to see what else would happen in this King's house. The servants were  ordered not to bring food or drink to him, but at dawn, when there was  no one near, Agnar came to him with a horn of ale and gave it to him to  drink.    The next evening when the King came back from his robberies, and when he  and his friends, sitting down at the tables, had eaten like wolves, he  ordered the fagots to be placed around Odin. And again they stood  around, watching in delight the fire playing around a living man. And  as before Odin stood there, unhurt by the fire, and his steady and  terrible gaze made the King hate him more and more. And all day he was  kept in chains, and the servants were forbidden to bring him food or  drink. None knew that a horn of ale was brought to him at dawn.    And night after night, for eight nights, this went on. Then, on the  ninth night, when the fires around him had been lighted, Odin lifted up  his voice and began to sing a song.    His song became louder and louder, and the King and the King's friends  and the servants of the thing's house had to stand still and harken to  it. Odin sang about Geirrod, the King; how the Gods had protected him,  giving him strength and skill, and how instead of making a noble use of  that strength and skill he had made himself like one of the wild beasts.  Then he sang of how the vengeance of the Gods was about to fall on this  ignoble King.    The flames died down and Geirrod and his friends saw before them, not a  friendless Wanderer, but one who looked more kingly than any King of the  earth. The chains fell down from his body and he advanced toward the  evil company. Then Geirrod rushed upon him with his sword in hand to  kill him. The sword struck him, but Odin remained unhurt.         Thy life runs out,       The Gods they are wroth with thee;       Draw near if thou canst;       Odin thou shalt see.    So Odin sang, and, in fear of his terrible gaze, Geirrod and his company  shrank away. And as they shrank away they were changed into beasts, into  the wolves that range the forests.    And Agnar came forward, and him Odin declared to be King. All the folk  were glad when Agnar came to rule over them, for they had been oppressed  by Geirrod in his cruel reign. And Agnar was not only kind, but he was  strong and victorious in his rule.          [Illustration]    ODIN WINS FOR MEN THE MAGIC MEAD      It was the Dwarfs who brewed the Magic Mead, and it was the Giants who  hid it away. But it was Odin who brought it from the place where it was  hidden and gave it to the sons of men. Those who drank of the Magic Mead  became very wise, and not only that but they could put their wisdom into  such beautiful words that every one who heard would love and remember  it.    The Dwarfs brewed the Magic Mead through cruelty and villainy. They made  it out of the blood of a man. The man was Kvasir the Poet. He had  wisdom, and he had such beautiful words with it, that what he said was  loved and remembered by all. The Dwarfs brought Kvasir down into their  caverns and they killed him there. \"Now,\" they said, \"we have Kvasir's  blood and Kvasir's wisdom. No one else will have his wisdom but us.\"  They poured the blood into three jars and they mixed it with honey, and  from it they brewed the Magic Mead.    Having killed a man the Dwarfs became more and more bold. They came out  of their caverns and went up and down through Midgard, the World of Men.  They went into Joetunheim, and began to play their evil tricks on the  most harmless of the Giants.    They came upon one Giant who was very simple. Gilling was his name. They  persuaded Gilling to row them out to sea in a boat. Then the two most  cunning of the Dwarfs, Galar and Fialar, steered the boat on to a rock.  The boat split. Gilling, who could not swim, was drowned. The Dwarfs  clambered up on pieces of the boat and came safely ashore. They were so  delighted with their evil tricks that they wanted to play some more of  them.    Galar and Fialar then thought of a new piece of mischief they might do.  They led their band of Dwarfs to Gilling's house and screamed out to his  wife that Gilling was dead. The Giant's wife began to weep and lament.  At last she rushed out of the house weeping and clapping her hands. Now  Galar and Fialar had clambered up on the lintel of the house, and as she  came running out they cast a millstone on her head. It struck her and  Gilling's wife fell down dead. More and more the Dwarfs were delighted  at the destruction they were making.    They were so insolent now that they made up songs and sang them, songs  that were all a boast of how they had killed Kvasir the Poet, and  Gilling the Giant, and Gilling's wife. They stayed around Joetunheim,  tormenting all whom they were able to torment, and flattering themselves  that they were great and strong. They stayed too long, however. Suttung,  Gilling's brother, tracked them down and captured them.    Suttung was not harmless and simple like Gilling, his brother. He was  cunning and he was covetous.

After the goods  were purchased, they were placed in a machine that wrapped and tied them  ready for delivery.    A dining-room was always a part of every store. I desired to be shown  this, and found it as tasteful and elegant in its appointments as a  private one would be. Silver and china and fine damask made it inviting  to the eye, and I had no doubt the cooking corresponded as well with the  taste.    The streets of Mizora were all paved, even the roads through the  villages were furnished an artificial cover, durable, smooth and  elastic. For this purpose a variety of materials were used. Some had  artificial stone, in the manufacture of which Mizora could surpass  nature's production. Artificial wood they also made and used for  pavements, as well as cement made of fine sand. The latter was the least  durable, but possessed considerable elasticity and made a very fine  driving park. They were experimenting when I came away on sanded glass  for road beds. The difficulty was to overcome its susceptibility to  attrition. After business hours every street was swept by a machine. The  streets and sidewalks, in dry weather, were as free from soil as the  floor of a private-house would be.    Animals and domestic fowls had long been extinct in Mizora. This was one  cause of the weird silence that so impressed me on my first view of  their capital city. Invention had superceded the usefulness of animals  in all departments: in the field and the chemistry of food. Artificial  power was utilized for all vehicles.    The vehicle most popular with the Mizora ladies for shopping and culling  purposes, was a very low carriage, sometimes with two seats, sometimes  with one. They were upholstered with the richest fabrics, were  exceedingly light and graceful in shape, and not above three feet from  the ground. They were strong and durable, though frequently not  exceeding fifty pounds in weight. The wheel was the curious and  ingenious part of the structure, for in its peculiar construction lay  the delight of its motion. The spokes were flat bands of steel, curved  outward to the tire. The carriage had no spring other than these spokes,  yet it moved like a boat gliding down stream with the current. I was  fortunate enough to preserve a drawing of this wheel, which I hope some  day to introduce in my own land. The carriages were propelled by  compressed air or electricity; and sometimes with a mechanism that was  simply pressed with the foot. I liked the compressed air best. It was  most easily managed by me. The Mizora ladies preferred electricity, of  which I was always afraid. They were experimenting with a new propelling  power during my stay that was to be acted upon by light, but it had not  come into general use, although I saw some vehicles that were propelled  by it. They moved with incredible speed, so rapid indeed, that the  upper part of the carriage had to be constructed of glass, and securely  closed while in motion, to protect the occupant. It was destined, I  heard some of their scientists say, to become universal, as it was the  most economical power yet discovered. They patiently tried to explain it  to me, but my faculties were not receptive to such advanced philosophy,  and I had to abandon the hope of ever introducing it into my own  country.    There was another article manufactured in Mizora that excited my wonder  and admiration. It was elastic glass. I have frequently mentioned the  unique uses that they made of it, and I must now explain why. They had  discovered a process to render it as pliable as rubber. It was more  useful than rubber could be, for it was almost indestructible. It had  superceded iron in many ways. All cooking utensils were made of it. It  entered largely into the construction and decoration of houses. All  cisterns and cellars had an inner lining of it. All underground pipes  were made of it, and many things that are the necessities and luxuries  of life.    They spun it into threads as fine and delicate as a spider's gossamer,  and wove it into a network of clear or variegated colors that dazzled  the eye to behold. Innumerable were the lovely fabrics made of it. The  frailest lace, in the most intricate and aerial patterns, that had the  advantage of never soiling, never tearing, and never wearing out.  Curtains for drawing-room arches were frequently made of it. Some of  them looked like woven dew drops.    One set of curtains that I greatly admired, and was a long time ignorant  of what they were made of, were so unique, I must do myself the pleasure  to describe them. They hung across the arch that led to the glass  conservatory attached to my friend's handsome dwelling. Three very thin  sheets of glass were woven separately and then joined at the edges so  ingeniously as to defy detection. The inside curtain was one solid  color: crimson. Over this was a curtain of snow flakes, delicate as  those aerial nothings of the sky, and more durable than any fabric  known. Hung across the arched entrance to a conservatory, with a great  globe of white fire shining through it, it was lovely as the blush of  Aphrodite when she rose from the sea, veiled in its fleecy foam.    They also possessed the art of making glass highly refractive. Their  table-ware surpassed in beauty all that I had ever previously seen. I  saw tea cups as frail looking as soap bubbles, possessing the delicate  iridescence of opals. Many other exquisite designs were the product of  its flexibility and transparency. The first article that attracted my  attention was the dress of an actress on the stage. It was lace, made of  gossamer threads of amber in the design of lilies and leaves, and was  worn over black velvet.    The wonderful water scene that I beheld at the theatre was produced by  waves made of glass and edged with foam, a milky glass spun into tiny  bubbles. They were agitated by machinery that caused them to roll with a  terribly natural look. The blinding flashes of lightning had been the  display of genuine electricity.    Nothing in the way of artistic effect could call forth admiration or  favorable comment unless it was so exact an imitation of nature as to  not be distinguished from the real without the closest scrutiny. In  private life no one assumed a part. All the acting I ever saw in Mizora  was done upon the stage.    I could not appreciate their mental pleasures, any more than a savage  could delight in a nocturne of Chopin. Yet one was the intellectual  ecstasy of a sublime intelligence, and the other the harmonious rapture  of a divinely melodious soul. I must here mention that the processes of  chemical experiment in Mizora differed materially from those I had  known. I had once seen and tasted a preparation called artificial cream  that had been prepared by a friend of my fathers, an eminent English  chemist. It was simply a combination of the known properties of cream  united in the presence of gentle heat. But in Mizora they took certain  chemicals and converted them into milk, and cream, and cheese, and  butter, and every variety of meat, in a vessel that admitted neither air  nor light. They claimed that the elements of air and light exercised a  material influence upon the chemical production of foods, that they  could not be made successfully by artificial processes when exposed to  those two agents. Their earliest efforts had been unsuccessful of exact  imitation, and a perfect result had only been obtained by closely  counterfeiting the processes of nature.    The cream prepared artificially that I had tasted in London, was the  same color and consistency as natural cream, but it lacked its relish.  The cream manufactured in Mizora was a perfect imitation of the finest  dairy product.    It was the same with meats; they combined the elements, and the article  produced possessed no detrimental flavor. It was a more economical way  of obtaining meat than by fattening animals.    They were equally fortunate in the manufacture of clothing. Every  mountain was a cultivated forest, from which they obtained every variety  of fabric; silks, satins, velvets, laces, woolen goods, and the richest  articles of beauty and luxury, in which to array themselves, were put  upon the market at a trifling cost, compared to what they were  manufactured at in my own country. Pallid and haggard women and  children, working incessantly for a pittance that barely sustained  existence, was the ultimatum that the search after the cause of cheap  prices arrived at in my world, but here it traveled from one bevy of  beautiful workwoman to another until it ended at the Laboratory where  Science sat throned, the grand, majestic, humane Queen of this thrice  happy land.          CHAPTER IX.      Whenever I inquired:    \"From whence comes the heat that is so evenly distributed throughout the  dwellings and public buildings of Mizora?\" they invariably pointed to  the river. I asked in astonishment:    \"From water comes fire?\"    And they answered: \"Yes.\"    I had long before this time discovered that Mizora was a nation of very  wonderful people, individually and collectively; and as every revelation  of their genius occurred, I would feel as though I could not be  surprised at any marvelous thing that they should claim to do, but I was  really not prepared to believe that they could set the river on fire.  Yet I found that such was, scientifically, the fact. It was one of their  most curious and, at the same time, useful appliances of a philosophical  discovery.    They separated water into its two gases, and then, with their ingenious  chemical skill, converted it into an economical fuel.    Their coal mines had long been exhausted, as had many other of nature's  resources for producing artificial heat. The dense population made it  impracticable to cultivate forests for fuel. Its rapid increase demanded "]]]
