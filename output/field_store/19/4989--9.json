Palermo of course is better.    Ah--the Neapolitan women--he says, a propos or not. They do their hair  so fine, so neat and beautiful--but underneath--sotto--sotto--they are  dirty. This being received in cold silence, he continues: _Noi giriamo  il mondo! Noi, chi giriamo, conosciamo il mondo._ _We_ travel about,  and _we_ know the world. Who _we_ are, I do not know: his highness the  Palermitan carpenter lout, no doubt. But _we_, who travel, know the  world. He is preparing his shot. The Neapolitan women, and the English  women, in this are equal: that they are dirty underneath. Underneath,  they are dirty. The women of London--    But it is getting too much for me.    \"You who look for dirty women,\" say I, \"find dirty women everywhere.\"    He stops short and watches me.    \"No! No! You have not understood me. No! I don't mean that. I mean that  the Neapolitan women and the English women have dirty underclothing--\"    To which he gets no answer but a cold look and a cold cheek. Whereupon  he turns to the q-b, and proceeds to be _simpatica_. And after a few  moments he turns again to me:    \"Il signore is offended! He is offended with me.\"    But I turn the other way. And at last he clears out: in triumph, I must  admit: like a mosquito that has bitten one in the neck. As a matter of  fact one should _never_ let these fellows get into conversation  nowadays. They are no longer human beings. They hate one's Englishness,  and leave out the individual.           *       *       *       *       *    We walk forward, towards the fore-deck, where the captain's lookout  cabin is. The captain is an elderly man, silent and crushed: with the  look of a gentleman. But he looks beaten down. Another, still another  member of the tray-carrying department is just creeping up his ladder  with a cup of black coffee. Returning, we peep down the sky-light into  the kitchen. And there we see roast chicken and sausages--roast chicken  and sausages! Ah, this is where the sides of kid and the chickens and  the good things go: all down the throats of the crew. There is no more  food for us, until we land.           *       *       *       *       *    We have passed the cape--and the white thing is a lighthouse. And the  fattish, handsome professor has come up carrying the little girl-child,  while the femalish elder brother leads the rabbit-fluffy small boy by  the hand. So _en famille_: so terribly _en famille_. They deposit  themselves near us, and it threatens another conversation. But not for  anything, my dears!    The sailors--not sailors, some of the street-corner loafers, are  hoisting the flag, the red-white-and-green Italian tricolor. It floats  at the mast-head, and the femalish brother, in a fine burst of feeling,  takes off his funny hat with a flourish and cries:    \"Ecco la bandiera italiana!\"    Ach, the hateful sentimentalism of these days.    The land passes slowly, very slowly. It is hilly, but barren looking,  with few trees. And it is not spikey and rather splendid, like Sicily.  Sicily has style. We keep along the east side of the bay--away in the  west is Cape Spartivento. And still no sight of Cagliari.    \"Two hours yet!\" cries the Cagliari girl. \"Two hours before we eat. Ah,  when I get on land, what a good meal I shall eat.\"    The men haul in the automatic log. The sky is clouding over with that  icy curd which comes after midday when the bitter north wind is blowing.  It is no longer warm.           *       *       *       *       *    Slowly, slowly we creep along the formless shore. An hour passes. We see  a little fort ahead, done in enormous black-and-white checks, like a  fragment of gigantic chess-board. It stands at the end of a long spit of  land--a long, barish peninsula that has no houses and looks as if it  might be golf-links. But it is not golf-links.    And suddenly there is Cagliari: a naked town rising steep, steep,  golden-looking, piled naked to the sky from the plain at the head of the  formless hollow bay. It is strange and rather wonderful, not a bit like  Italy. The city piles up lofty and almost miniature, and makes me think  of Jerusalem: without trees, without cover, rising rather bare and  proud, remote as if back in history, like a town in a monkish,  illuminated missal. One wonders how it ever got there. And it seems like  Spain--or Malta: not Italy. It is a steep and lonely city, treeless, as  in some old illumination. Yet withal rather jewel-like: like a sudden  rose-cut amber jewel naked at the depth of the vast indenture. The air  is cold, blowing bleak and bitter, the sky is all curd. And that is  Cagliari. It has that curious look, as if it could be seen, but not  entered. It is like some vision, some memory, something that has passed  away. Impossible that one can actually _walk_ in that city: set foot  there and eat and laugh there. Ah, no! Yet the ship drifts nearer,  nearer, and we are looking for the actual harbour.           *       *       *       *       *    The usual sea-front with dark trees for a promenade and palatial  buildings behind, but here not so pink and gay, more reticent, more  sombre of yellow stone. The harbour itself a little basin of water, into  which we are slipping carefully, while three salt-barges laden with salt  as white as snow creep round from the left, drawn by an infinitesimal  tug. There are only two other forlorn ships in the basin. It is cold on  deck. The ship turns slowly round, and is being hauled to the quay side.  I go down for the knapsack, and a fat blue-bottle pounces at me.    \"You pay nine francs fifty.\"    I pay them, and we get off that ship.          III.    CAGLIARI.      There is a very little crowd waiting on the quay: mostly men with their  hands in their pockets. But, thank Heaven, they have a certain aloofness  and reserve. They are not like the tourist-parasites of these post-war  days, who move to the attack with a terrifying cold vindictiveness the  moment one emerges from any vehicle. And some of these men look really  poor. There are no poor Italians any more: at least, loafers.    Strange the feeling round the harbour: as if everybody had gone away.  Yet there are people about. It is \"festa\" however, Epiphany. But it is  so different from Sicily: none of the suave Greek-Italian charms, none  of the airs and graces, none of the glamour. Rather bare, rather stark,  rather cold and yellow--somehow like Malta, without Malta's foreign  liveliness. Thank Goodness no one wants to carry my knapsack. Thank  Goodness no one has a fit at the sight of it. Thank Heaven no one takes  any notice. They stand cold and aloof, and don't move.    We make our way through the Customs: then through the Dazio, the City  Customs-house. Then we are free. We set off up a steep, new, broad road,  with little trees on either side. But stone, arid, new, wide stone,  yellowish under the cold sky--and abandoned-seeming. Though, of course,  there are people about. The north wind blows bitingly.    We climb a broad flight of steps, always upwards, up the wide,  precipitous, dreary boulevard with sprouts of trees. Looking for the  Hotel, and dying with hunger.           *       *       *       *       *    At last we find it, the Scala di Ferro: through a courtyard with green  plants. And at last a little man with lank, black hair, like an esquimo,  comes smiling. He is one brand of Sardinian--esquimo looking. There is  no room with two beds: only single rooms. And thus we are led off, if  you please, to the \"bagnio\": the bathing-establishment wing, on the dank  ground floor. Cubicles on either side a stone passage, and in every  cubicle a dark stone bath, and a little bed. We can have each a little  bath cubicle. If there's nothing else for it, there isn't: but it seems  dank and cold and horrid, underground. And one thinks of all the  unsavory \"assignations\" at these old bagnio places. True, at the end of  the passage are seated two carabinieri. But whether to ensure  respectibility or not, Heaven knows. We are in the baths, that's all.    [Illustration: ISILI]    The esquimo returns after five minutes, however. There _is_ a bedroom in  the house. He is pleased, because he didn't like putting us into the  bagnio. Where he found the bedroom I don't know. But there it was,  large, sombre, cold, and over the kitchen fumes of a small inner court  like a well. But perfectly clean and all right. And the people seemed  warm and good-natured, like human beings. One has got so used to the  non-human ancient-souled Sicilians, who are suave and so completely  callous.           *       *       *       *       *    After a really good meal we went out to see the town. It was after three  o'clock and everywhere was shut up like an English Sunday. Cold, stony  Cagliari: in summer you must be sizzling hot, Cagliari, like a kiln. The  men stood about in groups, but without the intimate Italian watchfulness  that never leaves a passer-by alone.    Strange, stony Cagliari. We climbed up a street like a corkscrew  stairway. And we saw announcements of a children's fancy-dress ball.  Cagliari is very steep. Half-way up there is a strange place called the  bastions, a large, level space like a drill-ground with trees,  curiously suspended over the town, and sending off a long shoot like a  wide viaduct, across above the corkscrew street that comes climbing up.  Above this bastion place the town still rises steeply to the Cathedral  and the fort. What is so curious is that this terrace or bastion is so  large, like some big recreation ground, that it is almost dreary, and  one cannot understand its being suspended in mid-air. Down below is the  little circle of the harbour. To the left a low, malarial-looking sea  plain, with tufts of palm trees and Arab-looking houses. From this runs  out the long spit of land towards that black-and-white watch-fort, the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3721"],[0,"France and England in North America, Part I: Pioneers of France in the New World (#12)"],[1,"band,  they were assailed by a wild and warlike race, inhabitants of an island  called Sarrope, in the midst of a lake, who put the warriors to flight,  bore the maidens captive to their watery fastness, espoused them all,  and, we are assured, \"loved them above all measure.\" [15]    Outina, taught by Arlac the efficacy of the French fire-arms, begged  for ten arquebusiers to aid him on a new raid among the villages of  Potanou,--again alluring his greedy allies by the assurance, that, thus  reinforced, he would conquer for them a free access to the phantom gold  mines of Appalache. Ottigny set forth on this fool's errand with thrice  the force demanded. Three hundred Thirnagoas and thirty Frenchmen took  up their march through the pine barrens. Outina's conjurer was of the  number, and had wellnigh ruined the enterprise. Kneeling on Ottigny's  shield, that he might not touch the earth, with hideous grimaces,  howlings, and contortions, he wrought himself into a prophetic frenzy,  and proclaimed to the astounded warriors that to advance farther would  be destruction. [16] Outina was for instant retreat, but Ottigny's  sarcasms shamed him into a show of courage. Again they moved forward,  and soon encountered Potanou with all his host. [17] The arquebuse did  its work,--panic, slaughter, and a plentiful harvest of scalps. But no  persuasion could induce Outina to follow up his victory. He went home  to dance round his trophies, and the French returned disgusted to Fort  Caroline.    And now, in ample measure, the French began to reap the harvest of their  folly. Conquest, gold, and military occupation had alone been their  aims. Not a rod of ground had been stirred with the spade. Their stores  were consumed, and the expected supplies had not come. The Indians, too,  were hostile. Satouriona hated them as allies of his enemies; and his  tribesmen, robbed and maltreated by the lawless soldiers, exulted in  their miseries. Yet in these, their dark and subtle neighbors, was their  only hope.    May-day came, the third anniversary of the day when Ribaut and his  companions, full of delighted anticipation, had first explored the  flowery borders of the St. John's. The contrast was deplorable; for  within the precinct of Fort Caroline a homesick, squalid band, dejected  and worn, dragged their shrunken limbs about the sun-scorched area, or  lay stretched in listless wretchedness under the shade of the barracks.  Some were digging roots in the forest, or gathering a kind of sorrel  upon the meadows. If they had had any skill in hunting and fishing, the  river and the woods would have supplied their needs; but in this point,  as in others, they were lamentably unfit for the work they had taken in  hand. \"Our miserie,\" says Laudonniere, \"was so great that one was found  that gathered up all the fish-bones that he could finde, which he dried  and beate into powder to make bread thereof. The effects of this hideous  famine appeared incontinently among us, for our bones eftsoones beganne  to cleave so neere unto the skinne, that the most part of the souldiers  had their skinnes pierced thorow with them in many partes of their  bodies.\" Yet, giddy with weakness, they dragged themselves in turn to  the top of St. John's Bluff, straining their eyes across the sea to  descry the anxiously expected sail.    Had Coligny left them to perish? Or had some new tempest of calamity,  let loose upon France, drowned the memory of their exile? In vain the  watchman on the hill surveyed the solitude of waters. A deep dejection  fell upon them,--a dejection that would have sunk to despair could their  eyes have pierced the future.    The Indians had left the neighborhood, but from time to time brought  in meagre supplies of fish, which they sold to the famished soldiers at  exorbitant prices. Lest they should pay the penalty of their extortion,  they would not enter the fort, but lay in their canoes in the river,  beyond gunshot, waiting for their customers to come out to them.  \"Oftentimes,\" says Laudonniere, \"our poor soldiers were constrained to  give away the very shirts from their backs to get one fish. If at any  time they shewed unto the savages the excessive price which they tooke,  these villaines would answere them roughly and churlishly: If thou make  so great account of thy marchandise, eat it, and we will eat our fish:  then fell they out a laughing, and mocked us with open throat.\"    The spring wore away, and no relief appeared. One thought now engrossed  the colonists, that of return to France. Vasseur's ship, the \"Breton,\"  still remained in the river, and they had also the Spanish brigantine  brought by the mutineers. But these vessels were insufficient, and they  prepared to build a new one. The energy of reviving hope lent new life  to their exhausted frames. Some gathered pitch in the pine forests; some  made charcoal; some cut and sawed timber. The maize began to ripen, and  this brought some relief; but the Indians, exasperated and greedy,  sold it with reluctance, and murdered two half-famished Frenchmen who  gathered a handful in the fields.    The colonists applied to Outina, who owed them two victories. The result  was a churlish message and a niggardly supply of corn, coupled with  an invitation to aid him against an insurgent chief, one Astina, the  plunder of whose villages would yield an ample supply. The offer was  accepted. Ottigny and Vasseur set out, but were grossly deceived, led  against a different enemy, and sent back empty-handed and half-starved.    They returned to the fort, in the words of Laudonniere, \"angry and  pricked deepely to the quicke for being so mocked,\" and, joined by all  their comrades, fiercely demanded to be led against Outina, to seize  him, punish his insolence, and extort from his fears the supplies which  could not be looked for from his gratitude. The commandant was forced  to comply. Those who could bear the weight of their armor put it on,  embarked, to the number of fifty, in two barges, and sailed up the river  under Laudonniere himself. Having reached Outina's landing, they marched  inland, entered his village, surrounded his mud-plastered palace, seized  him amid the yells and howlings of his subjects, and led him prisoner  to their boats. Here, anchored in mid-stream, they demanded a supply of  corn and beans as the price of his ransom.    The alarm spread. Excited warriors, bedaubed with red, came thronging  from all his villages. The forest along the shore was full of them; and  the wife of the chief, followed by all the women of the place, uttered  moans and outcries from the strand. Yet no ransom was offered, since,  reasoning from their own instincts, they never doubted that, after the  price was paid, the captive would be put to death.    Laudonniere waited two days, and then descended the river with his  prisoner. In a rude chamber of Fort Caroline the sentinel stood his  guard, pike in hand, while before him crouched the captive chief, mute,  impassive, and brooding on his woes. His old enemy, Satouriona, keen  as a hound on the scent of prey, tried, by great offers, to bribe  Laudonniere to give Outina into his hands; but the French captain  refused, treated his prisoner kindly, and assured him of immediate  freedom on payment of the ransom.    Meanwhile his captivity was bringing grievous affliction on his  tribesmen; for, despairing of his return, they mustered for the election  of a new chief. Party strife ran high. Some were for a boy, his son, and  some for an ambitious kinsman. Outina chafed in his prison on learning  these dissentions; and, eager to convince his over-hasty subjects that  their chief still lived, he was so profuse of promises that he was again  embarked and carried up the river.    At no great distance from Lake George, a small affluent of the St.  John's gave access by water to a point within six French leagues of  Outina's principal town. The two barges, crowded with soldiers, and  bearing also the captive Outina, rowed up this little stream. Indians  awaited them at the landing, with gifts of bread, beans, and fish, and  piteous prayers for their chief, upon whose liberation they promised an  ample supply of corn. As they were deaf to all other terms, Laudonniere  yielded, released his prisoner, and received in his place two hostages,  who were fast bound in the boats. Ottigny and Arlac, with a strong  detachment of arquebusiers, went to receive the promised supplies, for  which, from the first, full payment in merchandise had been offered. On  their arrival at the village, they filed into the great central lodge,  within whose dusky precincts were gathered the magnates of the tribe.  Council-chamber, forum, banquet-hall, and dancing-hall all in one, the  spacious structure could hold half the population. Here the French made  their abode. With armor buckled, and arquebuse matches lighted, they  watched with anxious eyes the strange, dim scene, half revealed by the  daylight that streamed down through the hole at the apex of the roof.  Tall, dark forms stalked to and fro, with quivers at their backs, and  bows and arrows in their hands, while groups, crouched in the shadow  beyond, eyed the hated guests with inscrutable visages, and malignant,  sidelong eyes. Corn came in slowly, but warriors mustered fast. The  village without was full of them. The French officers grew anxious, and  urged the chiefs to greater alacrity in collecting the promised ransom.  The answer boded no good: \"Our women are afraid when they see the  matches of your guns burning. Put them out, and they will bring the corn  faster.\"    Outina was nowhere to be seen. At length they learned that he was in  one of the small huts adjacent. Several of the officers went to him,  complaining of the slow payment of his ransom. The kindness of his  captors at Fort Caroline seemed to have won his heart. He replied, that  such was the rage of his subjects that he could no"]]]
