[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26978"],[0,"Salem Witchcraft and Cotton Mather: A Reply (#12)"],[1,"68. My work was published in 1867. The Reviewer, and  certain journals that have committed themselves to his support, charge  me with great negligence in not having consulted those papers, _not then  in print_. Upon inquiry, while making my researches, I was informed, by  those having them in hand preparatory to their going to press, that they  contained nothing at all essential to my work; and the information was  correct. Upon examining the printed volume, I cannot find a single item  that would require an alteration, addition, or omission to be made in my  work. But they are quite serviceable in the discussion to which the  article in the _North American Review_ compels me.    To return to the issue framed by the Reviewer. He makes a certain  absolute assertion, repeats it in various forms, and confidently assumes  it, all the way through, as in these passages: \"Stoughton admitted  spectral evidence; Mather, in his writings on the subject, denounced it,  as illegal, uncharitable, and cruel.\" \"He ever testified against it,  both publicly and privately; and, particularly in his Letter to the  Judges, he besought them that they would by no means admit it; and when  a considerable assembly of Ministers gave in their _Advice_ about the  matter, he not only concurred with the advice, but he drew it up.\" \"The  _Advice_ was very specific in excluding spectral testimony.\"    He relies, in the first place, and I may say chiefly, in maintaining  this position--namely, that Mather denounced the _admission_ of spectral  testimony and demanded its _exclusion_--upon a sentence in a letter from  Cotton Mather to John Richards, called by the Reviewer \"his Letter to  the Judges,\" among the _Mather Papers_, p. 891.    Hutchinson informs us that Richards came into the country in low  circumstances, but became an opulent merchant, in Boston. He was a  member of Mather's Church, and one of the Special Court to try the  witches. Its Session was to commence in the first week, probably on  Thursday, the second day of June. The letter, dated on Tuesday, the  thirty-first of May, is addressed to John Richards alone; and commences  with a strong expression of regret that quite a severe indisposition  will prevent his accompanying him to the trials. \"Excuse me,\" he says,  \"from waiting upon you, with the utmost of my little skill and care, to  assist the noble service, whereto you are called of God this week, the  service of encountering the wicked spirits in the high places of our  air, and of detecting and confounding of their confederates.\" He hopes,  before the Court \"gets far into the mysterious affair,\" to be able to  \"attend the desires\" of Richards, which, to him \"always are commands.\"  He writes the letter, \"for the strengthening of your honorable hands in  that work of God whereto, (I thank him) he hath so well fitted you.\"  After some other complimentary language, and assurances that God's  \"people have been fasting and praying before him for your direction,\" he  proceeds to urge upon him his favorite Swedish case, wherein the  \"endeavours of the Judges to discover and extirpate the authors of that  execrable witchcraft,\" were \"immediately followed with a remarkable  smile of God.\" Then comes the paragraph, which the Reviewer defiantly  cites, to prove that Cotton Mather agreed with him, in the opinion that  spectre evidence ought not to be \"admitted.\"    Before quoting the paragraph, I desire the reader to note the manner in  which the affair in Sweden is brought to the attention of Richards, in  the clauses just cited, in connection with what I have said in this  article, page 16. Cotton Mather was in possession of a book on this  subject. \"It comes to speak English,\" he says, \"by the acute pen of the  excellent and renowned Dr. Horneck.\" Who so likely as Mather to have  brought the case to the notice of Phips, pp. 14. It was urged upon  Richards at about the same time that it was upon Phips; and as an  argument in favor of \"_extirpating_\" witches, by the _action of a Court  of Oyer and Terminer_.    The paragraph is as follows: \"And yet I must most humbly beg you that in  the management of the affair in your most worthy hands, you do not lay  more stress upon pure Spectre testimony than it will bear. When you are  satisfied, and have good plain legal evidence, that the Demons which  molest our poor neighbors do indeed represent such and such people to  the sufferers, though this be a presumption, yet I suppose you will not  reckon it a conviction that the people so represented are witches to be  immediately exterminated. It is very certain that the Devils have  sometimes represented the Shapes of persons not only innocent, but also  very virtuous. Though I believe that the just God then ordinarily  provides a way for the speedy vindication of the persons thus abused.  Moreover, I do suspect that persons, who have too much indulged  themselves in malignant, envious, malicious ebullitions of their souls,  may unhappily expose themselves to the judgment of being represented by  Devils, of whom they never had any vision, and with whom they have, much  less, written any covenant. I would say this; if upon the bare supposal  of a poor creature being represented by a spectre, too great a progress  be made by the authority in ruining a poor neighbor so represented, it  may be that a door may be thereby opened for the Devils to obtain from  the Courts in the invisible world a license to proceed unto most hideous  desolations upon the repute and repose of such as have yet been kept  from the great transgression. If mankind have thus far once consented  unto the credit of diabolical representations, the door is opened!  Perhaps there are wise and good men, that may be ready to style him that  shall advance this caution, a Witch-advocate, but in the winding up,  this caution will certainly be wished for.\"    This passage, strikingly illustrative, as it is, of Mather's  characteristic style of appearing, to a cursory, careless reader, to say  one thing, when he is really aiming to enforce another, while it has  deceived the Reviewer, and led him to his quixotic attempt to  revolutionize history, cannot be so misunderstood by a critical  interpreter.    In its general drift, it appears, at first sight, to disparage spectral  evidence. The question is: Does it forbid, denounce, or dissuade, its  introduction? By no means. It supposes and allows its introduction, but  says, _lay not more stress upon it than it will bear_. Further, it  affirms that it may afford \"presumption\" of guilt, though not sufficient  for conviction, and removes objection to its introduction, by holding  out the idea that, if admitted by the Court and it bears against  innocent persons, \"the just God, then, ordinarily provides a way for  their speedy vindication.\" It is plain that the paragraph refers, not to  the _admission_ of \"diabolical representations,\" but to the _manner_ in  which they are to be received, in the \"management\" of the trials, as  will more fully appear, as we proceed.    The suggestion, to reconcile Richards to the use of spectral evidence,  that something would \"ordinarily\" providentially turn up to rescue  innocent persons, against whom it was borne, was altogether delusive. It  was an opinion of the day, that one of the most signal marks of the  Devil's descent with power, would be the seduction, to his service, of  persons of the most eminent character, even, if possible, of the very  elect; and, hence, no amount of virtue or holiness of life or  conversation, could be urged in defence of any one. The records of the  world present no more conspicuous instances of Christian and saintlike  excellence than were exhibited by Rebecca Nurse and Elizabeth How; but  spectral testimony was allowed to destroy them. Indeed, it was  impossible for a Court to put any restrictions on this kind of evidence,  if once received. If the accusing girls exclaimed--all of them  concurring, at the moment, in the declaration and in its details--that  they saw, at that very instant, in the Court-room, before Judges and  Jury, the spectre of the Prisoner assailing one of their number, and  that one showing signs of suffering, what could be done to rebut their  testimony? The character of the accused was of no avail. An _alibi_  could not touch the case. The distance from the Prisoner to the party  professing to be tormented, was of no account. The whole proceeding was  on the assumption that, however remote the body of the Prisoner, his or  her spectre was committing the assault. No limitation of space or time  could be imposed on the spectral presence. \"Good, plain, legal evidence\"  was out of the question, where the Judges assumed, as Mather did, that  \"the molestations\" then suffered by the people of the neighbourhood,  were the work of Demons, and fully believed that the tortures and  convulsions of the accusers, before their eyes, were, as alleged, caused  by the spectres of the accused.    To cut the matter short. The considerations Mather presents of the  \"inconvenience,\" as he calls it, of the spectral testimony, it might be  supposed, would have led him to counsel--not as he did, against making  \"too great a progress\" in its use--but its abandonment altogether. Why  did he not, as the Reviewer says ought always have been done, protest  utterly against its admission at all? The truth is, that neither in this  letter, nor in any way, at any time, did he ever recommend caution  _against_ its use, but _in_ its use.    It may be asked, what did he mean by \"not laying more stress upon  spectre testimony than it will bear,\" and the general strain of the  paragraph? A solution of this last question may be reached as we  continue the scrutiny of his language and actions.    In this same letter, Mather says: \"I look upon wounds that have been  given unto spectres, and received by witches, as intimations, broad  enough, in concurrence with other things, to bring out "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26981"],[0,"Pan-Islam (#12)"],[1," widening the gap between civilised and  uncivilised Moslems, but it also tends to disintegrate cultured Moslem  communities, for the older men are apt to regard it with suspicion or  downright condemnation. I once asked an eminent and learned Moslem  whether he thought modern European dress impeded regular observance of  prayers and ablutions. He replied, \"Perhaps so, but those Moslems who  wear such clothes indicate by so doing that the observances of Islam  have little hold upon them.\"    All these defects, however, are mere cracks in the inner walls of the  pan-Islamic structure and can be repaired from within, but the Turkish  Government, which represented the Caliphate, and should have considered  the integrity of Islam as a sacred trust, has managed to split the outer  wall and divide the house against itself, just as the unity of  Christendom (such as it was) has been rent asunder by one of its most  prominent exponents. Pan-Islam has received the more serious damage  because the wreckers still hold the Caliphate and the prestige attached  thereto; it is for Moslems (and Moslems only) to decide what action to  take; but in any case, the breach is a serious one and has been much  widened by the action of Turkish troops at the Holy Places. They  actually shelled the Caaba at Mecca (luckily without doing material  damage), and their action in storing high explosives close to the  Prophet's tomb at Medina may have saved them bombardment, but has  certainly not improved their reputation as Moslems. Even before the War  I often heard Yamen Arabs talking of \"Turks and Moslems\"--a distinctly  damning discrimination--and the situation has not been improved by  Ottoman slackness in religious observances and their inconsistent  national movement.    At the same time, their rule in Arabia will be awkward to replace at  first. I described the Turks in the final chapter of a book[B] published  early in the War as pre-eminently fitted to govern Moslems by  birthright, creed, and temperament, summing them up as individually  gifted but collectively hopeless as administrators because they lacked a  stable and consistent central Government. They have proved the  indictment up to the hilt, but that does not dower any of us Christians  with their inherent qualifications as rulers in Islam. If any of us are  called upon to face fresh responsibilities in this direction, it would  take us all our time to make up for these qualities by tact, sound  administration, and strict observance of local religious prejudice. Even  then there is a Mussulman proverb to this effect: \"A Moslem ruler though  he oppress me and not a _kafir_ though he work me weal\"--it explains  much apparent ingratitude for benefits conferred.    The lesson we have to learn from pan-Islamic activities of the last  decade or two is that countries which are mainly Moslem should have  Moslem rulers, and that Christian rule, however enlightened and  benevolent, is only permissible where Islam is outnumbered by other  creeds. At the same time, in countries where Christian methods of  civilisation and European capital have been invited we have a right to  control and advise the Moslem ruler sufficiently to ensure the fair  treatment of our nationals and their interests. But with purely Moslem  countries which have expressed no readiness to assimilate the methods of  modern civilisation or to invite outside capital we have no right to  interfere beyond the following limit: if the local authorities allow  foreign traders to operate at their ports their interests should be  safeguarded, if important enough, by consular representation on the  spot, or, if not, by occasional visits of a man-of-war to keep nationals  in touch with their own Government, presuming that the place is too  small to justify any mail-carrying vessel calling there except at very  long intervals.    There should always be a definite understanding as to foreigners  proceeding or residing up-country for any purpose. If the local ruler  discourages but permits such procedure, all we should expect him to do  in case of untoward incidents is to take reasonable action to  investigate and punish, but if he has guaranteed the security of foreign  nationals concerned, he must redeem his pledge in an adequate manner or  take the consequences. There should seldom be occasion for an inland  punitive expedition; in these days, when many articles of seaborne trade  have become, from mere luxuries, almost indispensable adjuncts of native  life in the remotest regions, a maritime blockade strictly enforced  should soon exact the necessary satisfaction.    Such rulers should bear in mind that if they accept an enterprise of  foreign capital they must protect its legitimate operations, just as a  school which has accepted a Government grant has to conform to  stipulated conditions.    Where no such penetration has occurred, all we should concern ourselves  with is that internal trouble in such regions shall not slop over into  territory protected or occupied by us, and this is where our most  serious difficulties will occur in erstwhile Turkish Arabia.    The Turk, with all his faults, could grapple with a difficult situation  in native affairs by drastic methods which might be indefensible in  themselves, but were calculated to obtain definite results. At any rate,  we had a responsible central Government to deal with and one that we  could get at. Now we shall have to handle such situations ourselves or  rely on the local authorities doing so. The former method is costly and  dangerous, yielding the minimum of result to the maximum of effort and  expense, while involving possibilities of trouble which might compromise  our democratic yearnings considerably: the latter alternative  presupposes that we have succeeded in evolving out of the present  imbroglio responsible rulers who are well-disposed to us and prepared to  take adequate action on our representations.    In Syria and Mesopotamia, where communications are good and European  penetration an established fact, there should not be much difficulty,  but in Arabia proper the problem is a very prickly one.    Beginning with Arabia Felix, which includes Yamen, the Aden  protectorate, and the vague, sprawling province of Hadhramaut, we may be  permitted to hope that nothing worse can happen in the Aden protectorate  than has happened already; the remoter Hadhramaut has always looked  after its own affairs and can continue to do so; but Yamen bristles with  political problems which will have to be solved, and solved correctly,  if she is going to be a safe neighbour or a reliable customer to have  business dealings with. Hitherto none of her local rulers have inspired  any confidence in their capacity for initiative or independent action.  During the War the Idrisi, who had long been in revolt against the Turks  in northern Yamen, kept making half-hearted and abortive dabs at  Loheia--like a nervous child playing snapdragon--but his only success  (and temporary at that) was when he occupied the town after the Red Sea  Patrol had shelled the Turks out of it. As for the Imam, he has been  sitting on a very thorny fence ever since the Turks came into the War.  We have been in touch with him for a long time, but all he has done up  to date is to wobble on a precarious tripod supported by the opposing  strains of Turks, tribesmen, and British. Now one leg of the tripod has  been knocked away he has yet to show if he can maintain stability on his  own base, and, if so, over what area. The undeniable fighting qualities  of the Yamen Arab, which might be a useful factor in a stable  government, will merely prove a nuisance and a menace under a weak  _regime_, and tribal trouble will always be slopping over into our Aden  sphere of influence. Then the question will arise, What are we going to  do about it? We cannot bring the Yamenis to book by blockading their  coast and cutting off caravan traffic with Aden, because, in view of our  trade relations with the country by sea and land, we should only be  cutting our nose off to spite our face. Moreover, the punishment would  fall chiefly on the respectable community, traders, the cultured  classes, etc., to whom seaborne trade is essential, while it would  hardly affect the wild tribesmen, except as regards ammunition, and to  prevent them getting what they wanted through the Hejaz is outside the  sphere of practical politics.    In the Hejaz itself we can at least claim that authority is suitably  represented and accessible to us. Before the War we kept a British  consul at Jeddah with an Indian Moslem vice-consul who went up to Mecca  in the pilgrim season. A responsible consular agent (Moslem of course)  to reside at Medina, also another to understudy the Jeddah vice-consul  when he went to Mecca and to look after the Yenbo pilgrim traffic, would  safeguard the interests of our nationals, who enormously outnumber the  pilgrims of any other nation. Further interference with the Hejaz,  unless invited, would be unjustifiable.    Trouble for us does not lie in the Hejaz itself, but in its possible  expansion beyond its powers of absorption, or, in homely metaphor, if it  bites off more than it can chew. There is a certain tendency just now to  overrate Hejazi prowess in war and policy; in fact, King Husein is often  alluded to vaguely as the \"King of Arabia,\" and there is a sporadic crop  of ill-informed articles on this and other Arabian affairs in the  English Press. One of the features of the War as regards this part of  the world is the extraordinary and fungus-like growth of \"Arabian  experts\" it has produced, most of whom have never set foot in Arabia  itself, while the few now living who have acquired real first-hand  knowledge of any part of the Arabian peninsula before the War may be  counted on the fingers of one hand. Yet the number of people who rush  into print with their opinions on the most complex"]]]
