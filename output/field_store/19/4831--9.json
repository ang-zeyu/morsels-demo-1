So I travelled round among the toy shops, but everything large cost too  much and I was thinking I should have to give it up, when I met Uncle  Teddy. As soon as he knew what I was about, he said he wanted to help,  and insisted on buying the biggest toy stove we could find. I scolded,  but he only laughed, and teased me about my cooking when we were young,  and said I must teach Bess as well as you, and went on buying all sorts  of nice little things for my 'cooking class' as he called it.\"    \"I'm so glad you met him!\" said Daisy, as Mrs. Jo stopped to laugh at  the memory of the funny time she had with Uncle Teddy.    \"You must study hard and learn to make all kinds of things, for he says  he shall come out to tea very often, and expects something uncommonly  nice.\"    \"It's the sweetest, dearest kitchen in the world, and I'd rather  study with it than do anything else. Can't I learn pies, and cake, and  macaroni, and everything?\" cried Daisy, dancing round the room with a  new saucepan in one hand and the tiny poker in the other.    \"All in good time. This is to be a useful play, I am to help you, and  you are to be my cook, so I shall tell you what to do, and show you how.  Then we shall have things fit to eat, and you will be really learning  how to cook on a small scale. I'll call you Sally, and say you are a new  girl just come,\" added Mrs. Jo, settling down to work, while Teddy sat  on the floor sucking his thumb, and staring at the stove as if it was a  live thing, whose appearance deeply interested him.    \"That will be so lovely! What shall I do first?\" asked Sally, with such  a happy face and willing air that Aunt Jo wished all new cooks were half  as pretty and pleasant.    \"First of all, put on this clean cap and apron. I am rather  old-fashioned, and I like my cook to be very tidy.\"    Sally tucked her curly hair into the round cap, and put on the apron  without a murmur, though usually she rebelled against bibs.    \"Now, you can put things in order, and wash up the new china. The old  set needs washing also, for my last girl was apt to leave it in a sad  state after a party.\"    Aunt Jo spoke quite soberly, but Sally laughed, for she knew who the  untidy girl was who had left the cups sticky. Then she turned up her  cuffs, and with a sigh of satisfaction began to stir about her kitchen,  having little raptures now and then over the \"sweet rolling pin,\" the  \"darling dish-tub,\" or the \"cunning pepper-pot.\"    \"Now, Sally, take your basket and go to market; here is the list of  things I want for dinner,\" said Mrs. Jo, giving her a bit of paper when  the dishes were all in order.    \"Where is the market?\" asked Daisy, thinking that the new play got more  and more interesting every minute.    \"Asia is the market.\"    Away went Sally, causing another stir in the schoolroom as she passed  the door in her new costume, and whispered to Demi, with a face full of  delight, \"It's a perfectly splendid play!\"    Old Asia enjoyed the joke as much as Daisy, and laughed jollily as the  little girl came flying into the room with her cap all on one side, the  lids of her basket rattling like castanets and looking like a very crazy  little cook.    \"Mrs. Aunt Jo wants these things, and I must have them right away,\" said  Daisy, importantly.    \"Let's see, honey; here's two pounds of steak, potatoes, squash, apples,  bread, and butter. The meat ain't come yet; when it does I'll send it  up. The other things are all handy.\"    Then Asia packed one potato, one apple, a bit of squash, a little pat  of butter, and a roll, into the basket, telling Sally to be on the watch  for the butcher's boy, because he sometimes played tricks.    \"Who is he?\" and Daisy hoped it would be Demi.    \"You'll see,\" was all Asia would say; and Sally went off in great  spirits, singing a verse from dear Mary Howitt's sweet story in rhyme:         \"Away went little Mabel,       With the wheaten cake so fine,       The new-made pot of butter,       And the little flask of wine.\"    \"Put everything but the apple into the store-closet for the present,\"  said Mrs. Jo, when the cook got home.    There was a cupboard under the middle shelf, and on opening the door  fresh delights appeared. One half was evidently the cellar, for wood,  coal, and kindlings were piled there. The other half was full of little  jars, boxes, and all sorts of droll contrivances for holding small  quantities of flour, meal, sugar, salt, and other household stores. A  pot of jam was there, a little tin box of gingerbread, a cologne bottle  full of currant wine, and a tiny canister of tea. But the crowning charm  was two doll's pans of new milk, with cream actually rising on it, and  a wee skimmer all ready to skim it with. Daisy clasped her hands at  this delicious spectacle, and wanted to skim it immediately. But Aunt Jo  said:    \"Not yet; you will want the cream to eat on your apple pie at dinner,  and must not disturb it till then.\"    \"Am I going to have pie?\" cried Daisy, hardly believing that such bliss  could be in store for her.    \"Yes; if your oven does well we will have two pies, one apple and one  strawberry,\" said Mrs. Jo, who was nearly as much interested in the new  play as Daisy herself.    \"Oh, what next?\" asked Sally, all impatience to begin.    \"Shut the lower draught of the stove, so that the oven may heat.  Then wash your hands and get out the flour, sugar, salt, butter, and  cinnamon. See if the pie-board is clean, and pare your apple ready to  put in.\"    Daisy got things together with as little noise and spilling as could be  expected, from so young a cook.    \"I really don't know how to measure for such tiny pies; I must guess  at it, and if these don't succeed, we must try again,\" said Mrs. Jo,  looking rather perplexed, and very much amused with the small concern  before her. \"Take that little pan full of flour, put in a pinch of salt,  and then rub in as much butter as will go on that plate. Always remember  to put your dry things together first, and then the wet. It mixes better  so.\"    \"I know how; I saw Asia do it. Don't I butter the pie plates too? She  did, the first thing,\" said Daisy, whisking the flour about at a great  rate.    \"Quite right! I do believe you have a gift for cooking, you take to it  so cleverly,\" said Aunt Jo, approvingly. \"Now a dash of cold water,  just enough to wet it; then scatter some flour on the board, work in  a little, and roll the paste out; yes, that's the way. Now put dabs of  butter all over it, and roll it out again. We won't have our pastry very  rich, or the dolls will get dyspeptic.\"    Daisy laughed at the idea, and scattered the dabs with a liberal hand.  Then she rolled and rolled with her delightful little pin, and having  got her paste ready proceeded to cover the plates with it. Next the  apple was sliced in, sugar and cinnamon lavishly sprinkled over it, and  then the top crust put on with breathless care.    \"I always wanted to cut them round, and Asia never would let me. How  nice it is to do it all my ownty donty self!\" said Daisy, as the little  knife went clipping round the doll's plate poised on her hand.    All cooks, even the best, meet with mishaps sometimes, and Sally's first  one occurred then, for the knife went so fast that the plate slipped,  turned a somersault in the air, and landed the dear little pie upside  down on the floor. Sally screamed, Mrs. Jo laughed, Teddy scrambled to  get it, and for a moment confusion reigned in the new kitchen.    \"It didn't spill or break, because I pinched the edges together so hard;  it isn't hurt a bit, so I'll prick holes in it, and then it will be  ready,\" said Sally, picking up the capsized treasure and putting it into  shape with a child-like disregard of the dust it had gathered in its  fall.    \"My new cook has a good temper, I see, and that is such a comfort,\" said  Mrs. Jo. \"Now open the jar of strawberry jam, fill the uncovered pie,  and put some strips of paste over the top as Asia does.\"    \"I'll make a D in the middle, and have zigzags all round, that will be  so interesting when I come to eat it,\" said Sally, loading the pie with  quirls and flourishes that would have driven a real pastry cook wild.  \"Now I put them in!\" she exclaimed; when the last grimy knob had been  carefully planted in the red field of jam, and with an air of triumph  she shut them into the little oven.    \"Clear up your things; a good cook never lets her utensils collect. Then  pare your squash and potatoes.\"    \"There is only one potato,\" giggled Sally.    \"Cut it in four pieces, so it will go into the little kettle, and put  the bits into cold water till it is time to cook them.\"    \"Do I soak the squash too?\"    \"No, indeed! Just pare it and cut it up, and put in into the steamer  over the pot. It is drier so, though it takes longer to cook.\"    Here a scratching at the door caused Sally to run and open it, when Kit  appeared with a covered basket in his mouth.    \"Here's the butcher boy!\" cried Daisy, much tickled at the idea, as she  relieved him of his load, whereat he licked his lips and began to beg,  evidently thinking that it was his own dinner, for he often carried it  to his master in that way. Being undeceived, he departed in great wrath  and barked all the way downstairs, to ease his wounded feelings.    In the basket were two bits of steak (doll's pounds), a baked pear, a  small cake, and paper with them on which Asia had scrawled, \"For Missy's  lunch, if her cookin' don't turn out well.\"    \"I don't want any of her old pears and things; my cooking will turn out  well, and I'll have a splendid dinner; see if I don't!\" cried Daisy,  indignantly.    \"We may like them if company should"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27887"],[0,"Wild Animals at Home (#12)"],[1," in spite of good protection,  continue to go down. They do not flourish when confined even in a large  area, and we have reason to fear that one of the obscure inexorable laws  of nature is working now to shelve the Antelope with the creatures that  have passed away. A small band is yet to be seen wintering on the  prairie near Gardiner.      THE RESCUED BIGHORN    At one time the Bighorn abounded along all the rivers where there was  rough land as far east as the western edge of the Dakotas, westerly to  the Cascades, and in the mountains from Mexico and Southern California  to Alaska.    In one form or another the Mountain Sheep covered this large region, and  it is safe to say that in the United States alone their numbers were  millions. But the dreadful age of the repeating rifle and lawless  skin-hunter came on, till the end of the last century saw the Bighorn in  the United States reduced to a few hundreds; they were well along the  sunset trail.    But the New York Zooelogical Society, the Camp Fire Club, and other  societies of naturalists and sportsmen, bestirred themselves mightily.  They aroused all thinking men to the threatening danger of extinction;  good laws were passed and then enforced. The danger having been  realized, the calamity was averted, and now the Sheep are on the  increase in many parts of the West.    During the epoch of remorseless destruction the few survivors were the  wildest of wild things; they would not permit the approach of a man  within a mile. But our new way of looking at the Bighorn has taught them  a new way of looking at us, as every traveller in Colorado or the  protected parts of Wyoming will testify.    In 1897 I spent several months rambling on the upper ranges of the  Yellowstone Park, and I saw not a single Sheep, although it was  estimated that there were nearly a hundred of the scared fugitives  hiding and flying among the rocks.    [Illustration]    In 1912 it was believed that in spite of poachers, Cougars, snow slides,  and scab contracted from domestic sheep, the Bighorn in the Yellowstone  Park had increased to considerably over two hundred, and the traveller  can find them with fair certainty if he will devote a few days to the  quest around Mt. Evarts, Washburn, or the well-known ranges.    [Illustration]    In September, 1912, I left Gardiner with Tom Newcomb's outfit. I was  riding at the end of the procession watching in all directions, when far  up on the slide rock I caught sight of a Sheep. A brief climb brought me  within plain though not near view, to learn that there were half a dozen  at least, and I took a few shots with my camera. I think there were many  more hidden in the tall sage behind, but I avoided alarming them, so did  not find out.    There were neither rams nor lambs with this herd of ewes. The rams keep  their own company all summer and live, doubtless, far higher in the  mountains.    On Mt. Washburn a week later I had the luck to find a dozen ewes with  their lambs; but the sky was dark with leaden clouds and the light so  poor that I got no good results.    In winter, as I learn from Colonel Brett, the Sheep are found in small  bands between the Mammoth Hot Springs and Gardiner, for there is good  feed there, and far less snow than in the upper ranges. I have just  heard that this winter four great rams are seen there every day with  about forty other Sheep; and they are so tame that one can get pictures  within ten feet if desired. Alas! that I have to be so far away with  such thrilling opportunities going to waste.      FOOTNOTES:    [Footnote B: See \"Life Histories of Northern Animals,\" by E. T. Seton.]                 *       *       *       *       *    V    Bats in the Devil's Kitchen           *       *       *       *       *          V    Bats in the Devil's Kitchen      It is unfortunate that the average person has a deep prejudice against  the Bat. Without looking or thinking for himself, he accepts a lot of  absurd tales about the winged one, and passes them on and on, never  caring for the injustice he does or the pleasure he loses. I have loved  the Bat ever since I came to know him; that is, all my mature life. He  is the climax of creation in many things, highly developed in brain,  marvellously keen in senses, clad in exquisite fur and equipped, above  all, with the crowning glory of flight. He is the prototype and the  realization of the Fairy of the Wood we loved so much as children, and  so hated to be robbed of by grown-ups, who should have known better.    I would give a good deal to have a Bat colony where I could see it  daily, and would go a long way to meet some new kind of Bat.    [Illustration]    I never took much interest in caverns, or geysers, or in any of the  abominable cavities of the earth that nature so plainly meant to keep  hidden from our eyes. I shall not forget the unpleasant sensations I had  when first, in 1897, I visited the Yellowstone Wonderland and stood  gazing at that abominable Mud Geyser, which is even worse to-day. The  entry in my journal of the time runs thus:    \"The Mud Geyser is unlike anything that can be seen elsewhere. One hears  about the bowels of the earth; this surely is the end of one of them.  They talk of the mouth of hell; this is the mouth with a severe fit of  vomiting. The filthy muck is spewed from an unseen gullet at one side  into a huge upright mouth with sounds of oozing, retching and belching.  Then as quickly reswallowed with noises expressive of loathing on its  own part, while noxious steam spreads disgusting, unpleasant odours all  around. The whole process is quickly repeated, and goes on and on, and  has gone on for ages, and will go. And yet one feels that this is merely  the steam vent outside of the huge factory where all the actual work is  being done. One does not really see the thing at all, but only stands  outside the building where it is going on. One never wishes to see it a  second time. All are disgusted by it, but all are fascinated.\"           *       *       *       *       *    No, I like them not. I have a natural antipathy to the internal  arrangements of Mother Earth. I might almost say a delicacy about gazing  on such exposure. Anyhow, we shall all get underground soon enough; and  I usually drop off when our party prepares to explore dark, horrible,  smelly underground places that have no possible claim (I hold) for the  normal being of healthy instincts.    But near the Mammoth Hot Springs is a hellhole that did attract me. It  is nothing else than the stuffy, blind alley known as the Devil's  Kitchen. There is no cooking going on at present, probably because it is  not heated up enough, but there is a peculiarly hot, close feeling  suggestive of the Monkey house in an old-time zoo. I went down this, not  that I was interested in the Satanic cuisine, but because my ancient  antipathy was routed by my later predilection--I was told that Bats  \"occurred\" in the kitchen. Sure enough, I found them, half a dozen, so  far as one could tell in the gloom, and thanks to the Park  Superintendent, Colonel L. M. Brett, I secured a specimen which, to my  great surprise, turned out to be the long-eared Bat, a Southern species  never before discovered north of Colorado. It will be interesting to  know whether they winter here or go south, as do many of their kin. They  would have to go a long way before they would find another bedroom so  warm and safe. Even if they go as far as the equator, with its warmth  and its pests, they would probably have reason to believe that the  happiest nights of their lives were those spent in the Devil's Kitchen.    [Illustration]                 *       *       *       *       *    VI    The Well-meaning Skunk           *       *       *       *       *          VI    The Well-meaning Skunk    [Illustration]      I have a profound admiration for the Skunk. Indeed, I once maintained  that this animal was the proper emblem of America. It is, first of all,  peculiar to this continent. It has stars on its head and stripes on its  body. It is an ideal citizen; minds its own business, harms no one, and  is habitually inoffensive, as long as it is left alone; but it will face  any one or any number when aroused. It has a wonderful natural ability  to take the offensive; and no man ever yet came to grips with a Skunk  without being sadly sorry for it afterward.    Nevertheless, in spite of all this, and the fact that several other  countries have prior claims on the Eagle, I could not secure, for my  view, sufficient popular support to change the national emblem.    From Atlantic to Pacific and from Mexico far north into the wilds of  Canada the Skunk is found, varying with climate in size and colour  indeed, but everywhere the same in character and in mode of defense.    It abounds in the broken country that lies between forest and prairie,  but seems to avoid the thicker woods as well as the higher peaks.    In Yellowstone Park it is not common, but is found occasionally about  Mammoth Hot Springs and Yancey's, at which latter place I had much  pleasant acquaintance with its kind.      HIS SMELL-GUN    Every one knows that the animal can make a horrible smell in defending  itself, but most persons do not realize what the smell is, or how it is  made. First of all, and this should be in capitals, it has nothing at  all to do with the kidneys or with the sex organs. It is simply a highly  specialized musk secreted by a gland, or rather, a pair of them, located  under the tail. It is used for defense when the Skunk is in peril of his  life, or thinks he is. But a Skunk may pass his whole life without using  it.    [Illustration]    He can throw it to a distance of seven to ten feet according to his  power or the wind. If it reaches the eyes of his assailant it blinds him  temporarily. If it enters his mouth it sets up a frightful nausea. If  the vapour gets into his lungs, it chokes as well as nauseates."]]]
