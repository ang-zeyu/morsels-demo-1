Everyone who has been on a  Mariposa excursion knows all about that.    Nor can I describe the day itself and the picnic under the trees. 'There  were speeches afterwards, and Judge Pepperleigh gave such offence  by bringing in Conservative politics that a man called Patriotus  Canadiensis wrote and asked for some of the invaluable space of the  Mariposa Times-Herald and exposed it.    I should say that there were races too, on the grass on the open side  of the island, graded mostly according to ages, races for boys under  thirteen and girls over nineteen and all that sort of thing. Sports  are generally conducted on that plan in Mariposa. It is realized that a  woman of sixty has an unfair advantage over a mere child.    Dean Drone managed the races and decided the ages and gave out the  prizes; the Wesleyan minister helped, and he and the young student, who  was relieving in the Presbyterian Church, held the string at the winning  point.    They had to get mostly clergymen for the races because all the men had  wandered off, somehow, to where they were drinking lager beer out of two  kegs stuck on pine logs among the trees.    But if you've ever been on a Mariposa excursion you know all about these  details anyway.    So the day wore on and presently the sun came through the trees on a  slant and the steamer whistle blew with a great puff of white steam and  all the people came straggling down to the wharf and pretty soon the  Mariposa Belle had floated out on to the lake again and headed for the  town, twenty miles away.      I suppose you have often noticed the contrast there is between an  excursion on its way out in the morning and what it looks like on the  way home.    In the morning everybody is so restless and animated and moves to  and fro all over the boat and asks questions. But coming home, as the  afternoon gets later and the sun sinks beyond the hills, all the people  seem to get so still and quiet and drowsy.    So it was with the people on the Mariposa Belle. They sat there on the  benches and the deck chairs in little clusters, and listened to the  regular beat of the propeller and almost dozed off asleep as they sat.  Then when the sun set and the dusk drew on, it grew almost dark on the  deck and so still that you could hardly tell there was anyone on board.    And if you had looked at the steamer from the shore or from one of  the islands, you'd have seen the row of lights from the cabin windows  shining on the water and the red glare of the burning hemlock from the  funnel, and you'd have heard the soft thud of the propeller miles away  over the lake.    Now and then, too, you could have heard them singing on the  steamer,--the voices of the girls and the men blended into unison  by the distance, rising and falling in long-drawn melody:  \"O--Can-a-da--O--Can-a-da.\"    You may talk as you will about the intoning choirs of your European  cathedrals, but the sound of \"O--Can-a-da,\" borne across the waters of a  silent lake at evening is good enough for those of us who know Mariposa.    I think that it was just as they were singing like this: \"O--Can-a-da,\"  that word went round that the boat was sinking.    If you have ever been in any sudden emergency on the water, you will  understand the strange psychology of it,--the way in which what is  happening seems to become known all in a moment without a word being  said. The news is transmitted from one to the other by some mysterious  process.    At any rate, on the Mariposa Belle first one and then the other heard  that the steamer was sinking. As far as I could ever learn the first  of it was that George Duff, the bank manager, came very quietly to Dr.  Gallagher and asked him if he thought that the boat was sinking. The  doctor said no, that he had thought so earlier in the day but that he  didn't now think that she was.    After that Duff, according to his own account, had said to Macartney,  the lawyer, that the boat was sinking, and Macartney said that he  doubted it very much.    Then somebody came to Judge Pepperleigh and woke him up and said that  there was six inches of water in the steamer and that she was sinking.  And Pepperleigh said it was perfect scandal and passed the news on to  his wife and she said that they had no business to allow it and that if  the steamer sank that was the last excursion she'd go on.    So the news went all round the boat and everywhere the people gathered  in groups and talked about it in the angry and excited way that people  have when a steamer is sinking on one of the lakes like Lake Wissanotti.    Dean Drone, of course, and some others were quieter about it, and said  that one must make allowances and that naturally there were two sides to  everything. But most of them wouldn't listen to reason at all. I think,  perhaps, that some of them were frightened. You see the last time but  one that the steamer had sunk, there had been a man drowned and it made  them nervous.    What? Hadn't I explained about the depth of Lake Wissanotti? I had  taken it for granted that you knew; and in any case parts of it are deep  enough, though I don't suppose in this stretch of it from the big reed  beds up to within a mile of the town wharf, you could find six feet of  water in it if you tried. Oh, pshaw! I was not talking about a steamer  sinking in the ocean and carrying down its screaming crowds of people  into the hideous depths of green water. Oh, dear me no! That kind of  thing never happens on Lake Wissanotti.    But what does happen is that the Mariposa Belle sinks every now and  then, and sticks there on the bottom till they get things straightened  up.    On the lakes round Mariposa, if a person arrives late anywhere and  explains that the steamer sank, everybody understands the situation.    You see when Harland and Wolff built the Mariposa Belle, they left some  cracks in between the timbers that you fill up with cotton waste every  Sunday. If this is not attended to, the boat sinks. In fact, it is part  of the law of the province that all the steamers like the Mariposa Belle  must be properly corked,--I think that is the word,--every season. There  are inspectors who visit all the hotels in the province to see that it  is done.    So you can imagine now that I've explained it a little straighter, the  indignation of the people when they knew that the boat had come uncorked  and that they might be stuck out there on a shoal or a mud-bank half the  night.    I don't say either that there wasn't any danger; anyway, it doesn't feel  very safe when you realize that the boat is settling down with every  hundred yards that she goes, and you look over the side and see only the  black water in the gathering night.    Safe! I'm not sure now that I come to think of it that it isn't worse  than sinking in the Atlantic. After all, in the Atlantic there is  wireless telegraphy, and a lot of trained sailors and stewards. But out  on Lake Wissanotti,--far out, so that you can only just see the lights  of the town away off to the south,--when the propeller comes to a  stop,--and you can hear the hiss of steam as they start to rake out the  engine fires to prevent an explosion,--and when you turn from the red  glare that comes from the furnace doors as they open them, to the  black dark that is gathering over the lake,--and there's a night wind  beginning to run among the rushes,--and you see the men going forward  to the roof of the pilot house to send up the rockets to rouse the town,  safe? Safe yourself, if you like; as for me, let me once get back into  Mariposa again, under the night shadow of the maple trees, and this  shall be the last, last time I'll go on Lake Wissanotti.    Safe! Oh yes! Isn't it strange how safe other people's adventures seem  after they happen? But you'd have been scared, too, if you'd been there  just before the steamer sank, and seen them bringing up all the women on  to the top deck.    I don't see how some of the people took it so calmly; how Mr. Smith, for  instance, could have gone on smoking and telling how he'd had a steamer  \"sink on him\" on Lake Nipissing and a still bigger one, a side-wheeler,  sink on him in Lake Abbitibbi.    Then, quite suddenly, with a quiver, down she went. You could feel the  boat sink, sink,--down, down,--would it never get to the bottom? The  water came flush up to the lower deck, and then,--thank heaven,--the  sinking stopped and there was the Mariposa Belle safe and tight on a  reed bank.    Really, it made one positively laugh! It seemed so queer and, anyway,  if a man has a sort of natural courage, danger makes him laugh. Danger!  pshaw! fiddlesticks! everybody scouted the idea. Why, it is just the  little things like this that give zest to a day on the water.    Within half a minute they were all running round looking for sandwiches  and cracking jokes and talking of making coffee over the remains of the  engine fires.      I don't need to tell at length how it all happened after that.    I suppose the people on the Mariposa Belle would have had to settle down  there all night or till help came from the town, but some of the men  who had gone forward and were peering out into the dark said that it  couldn't be more than a mile across the water to Miller's Point. You  could almost see it over there to the left,--some of them, I think, said  \"off on the port bow,\" because you know when you get mixed up in these  marine disasters, you soon catch the atmosphere of the thing.    So pretty soon they had the davits swung out over the side and were  lowering the old lifeboat from the top deck into the water.    There were men leaning out over the rail of the Mariposa Belle with  lanterns that threw the light as they let her down, and the glare fell  on the water and the reeds. But when they got the boat lowered, it  looked "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35333"],[0,"Life of Heber C. Kimball, an Apostle (#12)"],[1,"othing, and to  reinstate them upon their own lands; that we had no intentions to  molest or injure any people, but only to administer to the wants of  our afflicted brethren; and that the evil reports which were  circulated about us were false, and were circulated by our enemies to  get us destroyed.    \"After he had finished speaking, the power of which melted them into  compassion, they arose and offered him their hands, and said they  would use their influence to allay the excitement which everywhere  prevailed against us. They accordingly went forth and rode day and  night to pacify the people. They wept because they saw we were an  afflicted people, and that our intentions were pure.    \"The next day the sheriff of that county, named Neil Gilliam, came to  deliver a short address to us. We formed into companies and marched  into a grove a little distance from the camp, and there formed  ourselves into a circle, and sat down upon the ground. Previous to Mr.  Gilliam's address he (Gilliam) said, I have heard much concerning  Joseph Smith, and I have been informed that he is in your camp; if he  is here I would like to see him.' Brother Joseph arose and said 'I am  the man.' This was the first time he was made known during the journey  of one thousand miles. Mr. Gilliam then arose and gave us some  instructions concerning the manners and customs of the people, their  disposition, etc., and what course we should take in order to gain  their favor and protection.    \"On the Sabbath day while we were in this place, being in want of  salt, I took it upon me to go to some of the inhabitants and get some.  Brother Cyrus Smalling took his rifle and went along with me. After  passing through a path enclosed by hazel bushes, about two miles from  the camp, I discovered a deer a little distance ahead of us standing  across the path. I made motions to Brother Smalling, and he, drawing  up his rifle over my shoulder, which served for a rest, fired and hit  the deer just behind the shoulder. It ran a few rods and fell. We cut  a pole and fastening the deer on it, got it on our shoulders and  carried it along to camp, when we dressed it and divided it among the  different companies, and had an excellent feast.    \"Here Brothers Ezra Thayer and Thomas Hayes were taken sick with the  cholera. We left them there, and also brother Joseph Hancock, who had  been taken with the cholera during the storm, and who was the first  person attacked with it. Brother Joseph called the camp together, and  told us that in consequence of the disobedience of some who had not  been willing to listen to his words, but had been rebellious, God had  decreed that sickness should come upon us, and we should die like  sheep with the rot; and said he, 'I am sorry, but I cannot help it.'  When he spake these things it pierced me like a dart, having a  testimony that so it would be.\"          CHAPTER IX.    THE FISHING RIVER REVELATION--WHY ZION WAS NOT REDEEMED--THE CHOLERA  IN CAMP--THE TEST OF FAITH COMPLETE--THE SHADOW OF A COMING EVENT.      Here, while the Camp rested on Fishing River, the Lord made further  known His will concerning the redemption of Zion. The revelation was  given on the 22nd of June, the same day that the Prophet repeated his  warning in relation to the coming scourge. The points most pertinent  to our narrative are here given:        \"Behold I say unto you, were it not for the transgressions of my      people, speaking concerning the church and not individuals, they      might have been redeemed even now;        \"But behold, they have not learned to be obedient to the things      which I required at their hands, but are full of all manner of      evil, and do not impart of their substance, as becometh saints, to      the poor and afflicted among them,        \"And are not united according to the union required by the law of      the celestial kingdom;        \"And Zion cannot be built up unless it is by the principles of the      law of the celestial kingdom, otherwise I cannot receive her unto      myself.        \"And my people must needs be chastened until they learn obedience,      if it must needs be, by the things which they suffer. * * * * * *        \"Therefore, in consequence of the transgression of my people, it      is expedient in me that mine elders should wait for a little      season for the redemption of Zion. * *        \"But inasmuch as there are those who have hearkened unto my words,      I have prepared a blessing and an endowment for them, if they      continue faithful. * * *        \"I have heard their prayers, and will accept their offering; and      it is expedient in me, that they should be brought thus far for a      trial of their faith.\"    Those who had families in the east were then told that they might  return, while the rest were required to remain in Missouri. The Saints  were instructed to observe wisdom and humility, and \"lift up an ensign  of peace\" to their enemies and to all the world, while awaiting the  day of God's power and of Zion's redemption.    The real purpose of the Almighty in relation to this important event  was foreshadowed in a revelation given February 24th, 1834, the one  calling for the organization of Zion's Camp. Therein the Lord says:        \"Behold I say unto you, the redemption of Zion must needs come by      power;        \"Therefore, I will raise up unto my people a man, who shall lead      them like as Moses led the children of Israel,        \"For ye are the children of Israel, and of the seed of Abraham,      and ye must needs be led out of bondage by power, and with a      stretched out arm:        \"And as your fathers were led at the first, even so shall the      redemption of Zion be.\"    While there is no doubt that, had the Lord's people been prepared,  they might have been redeemed according to His word, it is also  evident that the times were not then ripe for that event. This will be  shown more plainly as we proceed.    Continuing his narrative, Heber says;    \"On Monday, June 23rd, a council of high priests met, according to  revelation, to choose some of the first Elders to receive their  endowments; being appointed by the voice of the spirit, through Joseph  Smith the Prophet. Edward Partridge was called and chosen to go to  Kirtland and receive his endowments, with power from on high, and to  also stand in his office as a bishop to purchase land in Missouri.  Also W. W. Phelps, Isaac Morley, John Whitmer, David Whitmer, Algernon  S. Gilbert, Peter Whitmer, Simeon Carter, Newel Knight, Thomas B.  Marsh, Lyman Wight, Parley P. Pratt, Christian Whitmer, and Solomon  Hancock were severally called and chosen to receive their endowments  in Kirtland with power from on high.    \"On the morning of the 24th we started for Liberty, Clay County, where  our brethren were residing who had been driven from Jackson County,  taking our course round the head of Fishing River, in consequence of  high water. When we got within five or six miles of Liberty, General  Atchison and several other gentlemen met us, desiring that we would  not go to Liberty, as the feelings of the people in that place were  much enraged against us. Changing our course and bearing to the left,  we pursued our way across a prairie; then passing through a wood we  came to Brother Sidney Gilbert's where we camped on the bottom of Rush  Creek, in a field belonging to Brother Burgett.    \"The destroyer came upon us as we had been warned by the servant of  God. About 12 o'clock at night we began to hear the cries of those who  had been seized. Even those on guard fell with their guns in their  hands, and we had to exert ourselves considerably to attend to the  sick, for they were stricken down on every hand. Thus it continued  until morning when the camp was separated into several little bands,  and dispersed among the brethren.    \"I was left at the Camp in company with Joseph B. Noble, John D.  Parker, Luke Johnson and Warren Ingalls, in care of those who were  sick. We stayed with, and prayed for them, hoping they would recover,  but all hope was lost, for about six o'clock in the morning John S.  Carter expired. When the cholera first broke out he was the first who  came forward to rebuke it; when he was immediately seized by it, and  was the first to die. In about thirty minutes after Seth Hitchcock  died, and it seemed as though we must all sink under the power of the  destroyer.    \"We were not able to obtain lumber to make them coffins, but were  under the necessity of rolling them up in their blankets and burying  them in that manner. We placed them on a sled, which was drawn by a  horse about half a mile, and buried them in a little bluff by the side  of a small branch of Rush Creek. This was accomplished by dark. Our  hopes were that no more would die, but while we were uniting in prayer  with uplifted hands to God, we looked at our beloved brother, Eber  Wilcox, who was gasping his last. At this scene my feelings were  beyond expression. Those only who witnessed it can realize anything of  the extent of our sufferings; and I felt to weep and pray to the Lord,  that he would spare my life that I might behold my dear family again.  I felt to covenant with my brethren and my God never to commit another  sin while I lived. We felt to sit and weep over our brethren, and so  great was our grief that we could have washed them with our tears. To  realize that they had traveled a thousand miles through so much  fatigue to lay down their lives for their brethren, increased our love  for them.    \"Brothers Brigham and Joseph Young came from Liberty and assisted us  to bury Brother Wilcox. Their presence gave us much consolation. About  12 o'clock at night we placed Brother Wilcox on a small sled which we  drew to the place of interment with one hand on the rope and the other  bearing our firelocks for defense. While two were digging the grave  the others stood with their arms to defend them.    \"Whi"]]]
