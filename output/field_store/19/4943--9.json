Most of those on the Reservation are near the  central part of the southwestern one-fourth. Concentrated about the  site of an old homestead, occupied in the eighteen-seventies, within a  few acres, there are dozens of mature trees, up to 22 inches in trunk  diameter, and hundreds of saplings. Elsewhere on the Reservation the  species is scarce and is represented by isolated trees and scattered  clumps at a few places.      #Cornus Drummondi.#--This dogwood is the most abundant tree on the  area. However, it scarcely reaches the size of a tree. Most mature  examples are 1-1/2 to 3-1/2 inches in trunk diameter, and rarely more  than twelve feet high. Dogwood grows in greatest abundance on dry  rocky slopes where other trees are scarce. In small areas it may be  the dominant tree, often closely associated with chinquapin oak and  red elm. In parts of the woodland where there are larger trees,  dogwood may form an understory, its development depending largely on  the amount of light passing through the upper leaf canopy. Where the  canopy is dense and nearly continuous, dogwood tends to be eliminated  by shading. In some situations where forest has recently closed in,  most of the dogwoods are dead or dying. Especially on formerly  cut-over north slopes, where oak and hickory have sprung up in a dense  stand 20 feet high, with a thick canopy, most of the dogwoods have  been eliminated.    On the remaining hillside prairie near the northwest corner of the  Reservation, dogwood is the most prominent of the trees and shrubs  encroaching onto the area since it has been protected from fire--a  period of approximately 20 years. There are dense thickets of dogwood  along the borders of the prairie and the woodland edge.    The white-eyed vireo and Bell vireo both forage and nest in thickets  of dogwood and other shrubs.      #Fraxinus americana.#--White ash is localized on the Reservation and  most of the mature trees are within an area of perhaps three acres on  a steep slope of northwest exposure. Several of the largest trees,  well over a foot in trunk diameter, grow at the lower limestone  outcrop. Ash is most abundant at this level and at the terrace just  below it. On the one slope where it is concentrated, ash is one of the  most common trees, growing in association with American elm, chestnut  oak, black oak, and shagbark hickory. This area is one of the most  mesic on the Reservation. The soil is usually damp, with thick leaf  litter and rich humus. In hilltop fields, formerly cultivated or  pastured, saplings of white ash are among the most prominent invaders.    The leaves of this tree and especially its saplings, are favorite  foraging places for the tree frog. The groves of this tree provide  favorable habitat for the opossum, short-tailed shrew, gray squirrel,  and white-footed mouse. Birds that frequent the same habitat include  the black-capped chickadee, tufted titmouse, blue jay, rose-breasted  grosbeak (_Pheucticus ludovicianus_), yellow-billed cuckoo, red-eyed  vireo, gnatcatcher, hairy woodpecker, Kentucky warbler, and crested  flycatcher (_Myiarchus crinitus_).

Fitch.]          Summary and Conclusions      The University of Kansas Natural History Reservation, in the  northeastern corner of Douglas County, Kansas, is situated in an area  that originally supported two types of climax vegetation, tall grass  prairie, and hardwood forest. These associations were distinct and  sharply defined. The present distribution of the different species of  trees on the area, supplemented by the data from snails, indicates the  approximate distribution of the two original climaxes. The principal  climax trees of the original forest were mossy-cup oak (mainly in  bottomlands), black walnut, shagbark hickory, hackberry, red oak,  black oak (mainly on hillsides and hilltop edges), chestnut oak  (mainly on rocky upper slopes). Subclimax trees characteristic of  marginal situations include: American elm, red elm, white ash, honey  locust, osage orange, coffee-tree, red haw, dogwood, redbud, cherry,  wild plum and crab-apple. Others characteristic of hydroseral  situations include sycamore, willow (of four species), and cottonwood.    In the Kansas River flood plain and small tributary valleys, rich  mesophytic forest of predominantly oak-hickory type was present. In  somewhat stunted form, and with partial replacement of its species by  those of more xeric habit, it extended up onto hillsides sloping  north, east or west, and onto the adjacent hilltop edges. Slopes  having poor shallow soil and exposures mainly to the south supported  chiefly tall grass prairie, but also had compact clumps of blackjack  oak and post oak, usually more or less isolated from other parts of  the woodland. Hilltops were mostly treeless (except near their edges)  and supported a tall-grass prairie vegetation. Shrubs and various  kinds of small trees must have been a much less conspicuous part of  the woodland flora than they are at present, and occurred in small  ravines where shelter was inadequate for the larger forest trees, and  also along the extensive line of contact between forest and open land.    One of the earliest changes was the destruction of the bottomland  forest. With the rapid settlement of the region in the sixties and  seventies, lumber was in demand and the supply was limited. The  cleared land was productive as pasture. Heavy grazing combined with  drought, gradually altered the original tall grass prairie; the  bluestems and other perennial grasses were replaced by the introduced  blue grass and by various weedy forbs. Prolonged protection from fire  permitted encroachment of trees and shrubs into situations where they  had not grown previously. Heavy grazing however, tended to hold in  check the spread of the woody vegetation.    When the bottomlands had been cut over, lumbering operations were  extended onto those hillsides where the better stands of trees were  located. The cutting of large, mature oaks, walnuts, and hickories  opened up the woodland and permitted large scale encroachment by  subclimax species. American elm, especially, sprang up in thickets.  Ash, honey locust, cherry, red haw, crab-apple, dogwood, and the  introduced osage orange, thrived and spread in the situations to which  they were especially adapted. These species largely replaced the  original climax. Some of the trees cut, the oaks, sycamores, and  hickories, usually produced fast-growing stump sprouts and competed  vigorously with the invaders. At each successive cutting, however, the  climax species lost ground. American elm, being tremendously prolific  of seed, and only a little less tolerant of shading than its climax  competitors, soon became the dominant tree of the woodlands.

So it was not a very difficult matter, among many thousands of birds, to  pick out some that would pass for Buff Plymouth Rocks and some that  would pass for Buff Wyandottes. These varieties were also made in other  ways, mostly by various crosses with the Buff Cochin, but for some years  breeders continued to draw on the Rhode Island supply.    [Illustration: Fig. 53. Columbian Wyandottes. (Photograph from R. G.  Richardson, Lowell, Massachusetts)]    Some people in the Rhode Island district thought that a breed which  could thus furnish the foundation for varieties of two other breeds  ought to win popularity on its own merits. So they began to exhibit and  advertise Rhode Island Reds. At first they made little progress, but as  the breed improved, many more people became interested in it, and soon  it was one of the most popular breeds in the country. The modern  exhibition Rhode Island Red is of a dark brownish red in color.    =The American idea in England; the Orpington.= At the time that the  Chinese fowls were attracting wide attention in America and England some  were taken to other countries of Europe. In almost every country they  had some influence upon the native stock, but as each of the old  countries had one or more improved races that suited most of those  giving special attention to poultry culture, the influence of the  Asiatics was less marked than in our country.    When the Plymouth Rock and the Wyandotte became popular in America, they  were taken to England, where, in spite of the preference for white skin  and flesh-colored legs, they were soon in such favor that a shrewd  English breeder saw the advantage of making another breed of the same  general type but with skin and legs of the colors preferred in England.  He called his new breed the Orpington, giving it the name of the town in  which he lived. The first Orpingtons were black and were made by  crossing the black progeny of Plymouth Rocks (which in America had been  used to make the Black Java), Black Minorcas, and Black Langshans. Then  the originator of the Orpingtons put out a buff variety, which he  claimed was made by another particular combination of crosses, but which  others said was only an improvement of a local breed known as the  Lincolnshire Buff. Later White Orpingtons and Spangled Orpingtons  appeared.    =Present distribution of improved races.= Having briefly traced the  distribution of the fowl in ancient times, and the movements which in  modern times brought long-separated branches of the species together,  let us look at the present situation.    The Plymouth Rocks, Wyandottes, Rhode Island Reds, and Orpingtons, which  are essentially one type, the differences between them being  superficial, constitute the greater part of the improved fowls of  America and England and are favorites with progressive poultry keepers  in many other lands. In many parts of this country one rarely sees a  fowl that is not of this type, either of one of the breeds named or a  grade of the same type. After the general-purpose type, the laying type,  which includes the Italian, Spanish, German, and Dutch races, is the  most popular, but in this type popularity is limited in most places to  the Leghorns and to a few breeds which, though classed as distinct  breeds, are essentially the same. The Ancona is really a Leghorn, and  the Andalusian, although it comes from Spain, is, like other races in  that land, distinctly of the same type as the fowls of Italy.    [Illustration: Fig. 54. Single-Combed Buff Orpington cock. (Photograph  from Miss Henrietta E. Hooker, South Hadley, Massachusetts)]    With the growth of a general-purpose class, interest in the Asiatic  fowls rapidly declined. They are now kept principally by fanciers and by  market poultry growers who produce extra large fowls for the table.    =Deformed and dwarf races.= Although some of the races of fowls that  have been considered have odd characters which, when greatly  exaggerated, are detrimental and bring the race to decay, such  characters as large combs, crests, feathered legs, and the peculiar  development of the face in the Black Spanish fowl, when moderately  developed, do not seriously affect the usefulness of fowls possessing  them. With a little extra care they usually do as well as fowls of  corresponding plain types. Poultry keepers who admire such decorations  and keep only a few birds do not find the extra care that they require  burdensome, and consequently all these races have become well  established and at times popular. It is notable that in all fowls of  this class the odd character is added to the others or is an  exaggeration of a regular character. There are two other classes of odd  types of fowls. The first of these is made up of a small group of  varieties defective in one character; the second comprises the dwarf  varieties, most of which are miniatures of larger varieties.    =Silky fowls.= In all races of fowls individuals sometimes appear in  which the web of the feathers is of a peculiar formation, resembling  hair. Such fowls are called silkies. They are occasionally exhibited as  curiosities but are not often bred to reproduce this character. There is  one distinct race of white fowls, so small that it is usually classed as  a bantam, having feathers of this kind.    [Illustration: Fig. 55. Single-Combed White Orpington hen. (Photograph  from Bureau of Animal Industry, United States Department of  Agriculture)]    =Frizzled fowls.= The feathers of a fowl are sometimes curled at the  tips, like the short curls in the feathers which indicate the sex of a  drake. Such birds are called frizzles or frizzled fowls. True frizzles,  like true silkies from races having normal plumage, are very rare. Many  of the fowls exhibited at poultry shows as Frizzles are ordinary birds  the feathers of which have been curled artificially.    =Rumpless fowls.= The tail feathers of a fowl are borne on a fleshy  protuberance at the lower end of the spine. It sometimes happens that  one or more of the lower vertebrae are missing. In that case the fowl has  no tail and the feathers on the back, which in a normal fowl divide and  hang down at each side, fall smoothly all around. True rumpless fowls  are rare. Many of the specimens exhibited are birds from which the rump  was removed when they were very young.    =Bantams.= Dwarf, or bantam, fowls, on account of their diminutive size  and pert ways, are especially attractive to children. Breeding them to  secure the minimum size, the desired type, and fine quality in plumage  color has the same fascination for a fancier as the breeding of large  fowls, and as the small birds are better adapted to small spaces,  fanciers who have little room often devote themselves to the breeding of  bantams. The larger and hardier varieties of bantams are good for eggs  and poultry for home use, but are not often kept primarily for these  products. Most people who keep bantams keep only a few for pleasure, and  the eggs and poultry they furnish are but a small part of what the  family consumes. Bantam keepers who have a surplus of such products can  usually find customers in their own neighborhood. The very small bantams  and the very rare varieties are usually delicate and so hard to rear  that amateurs who try them soon become discouraged and either give up  bantams or take one of the hardy kinds. It is better to begin with one  of the popular varieties, which are as interesting as any and, on the  whole, are the most satisfactory.    [Illustration: Fig. 56. White Cochin Bantam cockerel]    =Origin of bantams.= After the explanation of the origin of varieties  given in Chapter III, and the description of the evolution of the  different races of fowls in the present chapter, it is perhaps not  really necessary to tell how dwarf races of fowls originated; but the  belief that such races were unknown until brought to Europe from the  city of Bantam, in the Island of Java, is so widespread that it can do  no harm to give the facts which disprove this and in doing so to show  again how easily artificial varieties are made by skillful poultry  fanciers.    [Illustration: Fig. 57. Bantams make good pets]    As has been stated, people who do not understand the close relations of  the different races of fowls, and do not know how quickly new types may  be established by careful breeding, attach a great deal of importance to  purity of breed. Hence, unscrupulous promoters of new breeds have often  claimed that they received their original stock direct from some remote  place or from some one who had long bred it pure. The idea of assigning  the town of Bantam as the home of a true species of dwarf domestic fowl  seems to have occurred to some one in England more than a hundred years  ago, and to have been suggested because of the resemblance of the name  of this Asiatic city to the English word \"banty,\" the popular name for a  dwarf fowl. It seems strange that such a fiction should be accepted as  accounting for dwarf varieties of European races, but it was published  by some of the early writers, used by lexicographers, and, having found  a place in the dictionaries, was accepted as authoritative by the  majority of later writers on poultry, even after some of the highest  authorities had shown conclusively that this view of the origin of dwarf  races was erroneous.    [Illustration: Fig. 58. Black-Tailed White Japanese Bantams. (Photograph  from Frederick W. Otte, Peekskill, New York)]    [Illustration: Fig. 59. White Polish Bantam hen]    [Illustration: Fig. 60. White Polish Bantam cock]    No evidence of the existence of a dwarf race of fowls in Java has ever  been produced. The Chinese and Japanese bantams did not come to Europe  and America until long after the name \"bantam\" came into use."]]]
