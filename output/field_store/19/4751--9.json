If thou  wouldst live another night, bestir thyself!\"    Just as the robbers were leading my brother from the tent, they met  three of their companions, who were also pushing a captive before  them. They entered with him. \"Here bring we the Bashaw, as thou hast  commanded,\" said they, conducting the prisoner before the cushion of  the Mighty. While they were so doing, my brother had an opportunity of  examining him, and was struck with surprise at the remarkable  resemblance which this man bore to himself; the only difference being,  that he was of more gloomy aspect, and had a black beard. The Mighty  seemed much astonished at the resemblance of the two captives.    \"Which of you is the right one?\" he asked, looking alternately at  Mustapha and the other.    \"If thou meanest the Bashaw of Sulieika,\" answered the latter in a  haughty tone, \"I am he!\"    The Mighty regarded him for a long time with his grave, terrible eye,  and then silently motioned to them to lead him off. This having been  done, he approached my brother, severed his bonds with his dagger, and  invited him by signs to sit upon the cushion beside him. \"It grieves  me, stranger,\" he said, \"that I took you for this villain. It has  happened, however, by some mysterious interposition of Providence,  which placed you in the hands of my companions, at the very hour in  which the destruction of this wretch was ordained.\"    Mustapha, thereupon, entreated him only for permission to pursue his  journey immediately, for this delay might cost him much. The Mighty  asked what business it could be that required such haste, and, when  Mustapha had told him all, he persuaded him to spend that night in his  tent, and allow his horse some rest; and promised the next morning to  show him a route which would bring him to Balsora in a day and a half.  My brother consented, was sumptuously entertained, and slept soundly  till morning in the robber's tent.    Upon awaking, he found himself all alone in the tent, but, before the  entrance, heard several voices in conversation, which seemed to belong  to the swarthy little man and the bandit-chief. He listened awhile,  and to his horror heard the little man eagerly urging the other to  slay the stranger, since, if he were let go, he could betray them all.  Mustapha immediately perceived that the little man hated him, for  having been the cause of his rough treatment the day before. The  Mighty seemed to be reflecting a moment.    \"No,\" said he; \"he is my guest, and the laws of hospitality are with  me sacred: moreover, he does not look like one that would betray us.\"    Having thus spoken, he threw back the tent-cover, and walked in.  \"Peace be with thee, Mustapha!\" he said: \"let us taste the  morning-drink, and then prepare thyself for thy journey.\" He offered  my brother a cup of sherbet, and after they had drunk, they saddled  their horses, and Mustapha mounted, with a lighter heart, indeed, than  when he entered the vale. They had soon turned their backs upon the  tents, and took a broad path, which led into the forest. The Mighty  informed my brother, that this Bashaw whom they had captured in the  chase, had promised them that they should remain undisturbed within  his jurisdiction; but some weeks before, he had taken one of their  bravest men, and had him hung, after the most terrible tortures. He  had waited for him a long time, and to-day he must die. Mustapha  ventured not to say a word in opposition, for he was glad to have  escaped himself with a whole skin.    At the entrance of the forest, the Mighty checked his horse, showed  Mustapha the way, and gave him his hand with these words: \"Mustapha,  thou becamest in a strange way the guest of the robber Orbasan. I will  not ask thee not to betray what thou hast seen and heard. Thou hast  unjustly endured the pains of death, and I owe thee a recompense. Take  this dagger as a remembrance, and when thou hast need of help, send it  to me, and I will hasten to thy assistance. This purse thou wilt  perhaps need upon thy journey.\"    My brother thanked him for his generosity; he took the dagger, but  refused the purse. Orbasan, however, pressed once again his hand, let  the money fall to the ground, and galloped with the speed of the wind  into the forest. Mustapha, seeing that he could not overtake him,  dismounted to secure the purse, and was astonished at the great  magnanimity of his host, for it contained a large sum of gold. He  thanked Allah for his deliverance, commended the generous robber to  his mercy, and again started, with fresh courage, upon the route to  Balsora.           *       *       *       *       *    Lezah paused, and looked inquiringly at Achmet, the old merchant.    \"No! if it be so,\" said the latter, \"then will I gladly correct my  opinion of Orbasan; for indeed he acted nobly towards thy brother.\"    \"He behaved like a brave Mussulman,\" exclaimed Muley; \"but I hope thou  hast not here finished thy story, for, as it seems to me, we are all  eager to hear still further, how it went with thy brother, and whether  he succeeded in rescuing thy sister and the fair Zoraida.\"    \"I will willingly proceed,\" rejoined Lezah, \"if it be not tiresome to  you; for my brother's history is, throughout, full of the most  wonderful adventures.\"           *       *       *       *       *    About the middle of the seventh day after his departure, Mustapha  entered the gate of Balsora. As soon as he had arrived at a  caravansery, he inquired whether the slave-market, which was held here  every year, had opened; but received the startling answer, that he had  come two days too late. His informer deplored his tardiness, telling  him that on the last day of the market, two female slaves had arrived,  of such great beauty as to attract to themselves the eyes of all the  merchants.    He inquired more particularly as to their appearance, and there was no  doubt in his mind, that they were the unfortunate ones of whom he was  in search. Moreover, he learned that the man who had purchased them  both, was called Thiuli-Kos, and lived forty leagues from Balsora, an  illustrious and wealthy, but quite old man, who had been in his early  years Capudan-Bashaw of the Sultan, but had now settled down into  private life with the riches he had acquired.    Mustapha was, at first, on the point of remounting his horse with all  possible speed, in order to overtake Thiuli-Kos, who could scarcely  have had a day's start; but when he reflected that, as a single man,  he could not prevail against the powerful traveller, could still less  rescue from him his prey, he set about reflecting for another plan,  and soon hit upon one. His resemblance to the Bashaw of Sulieika,  which had almost been fatal to him, suggested to him the thought of  going to the house of Thiuli-Kos under this name, and, in that way,  making an attempt for the deliverance of the two unfortunate maidens.  Accordingly he hired attendants and horses, in which the money of  Orbasan opportunely came to his assistance, furnished himself and his  servants with splendid garments, and set out in the direction of  Thiuli's castle. After five days he arrived in its vicinity. It was  situated in a beautiful plain, and was surrounded on all sides by  lofty walls, which were but slightly overtopped by the structure  itself. When Mustapha had arrived quite near, he dyed his hair and  beard black, and stained his face with the juice of a plant, which  gave it a brownish color, exactly similar to that of the Bashaw. From  this place he sent forward one of his attendants to the castle, and  bade him ask a night's lodging, in the name of the Bashaw of  Sulieika. The servant soon returned in company with four  finely-attired slaves, who took Mustapha's horse by the bridle, and  led him into the court-yard. There they assisted him to dismount, and  four others escorted him up a wide marble staircase, into the presence  of Thiuli.    The latter personage, an old, robust man, received my brother  respectfully, and had set before him the best that his castle could  afford. After the meal, Mustapha gradually turned the conversation  upon the new slaves; whereupon, Thiuli praised their beauty, but  expressed regret because they were so sorrowful; nevertheless he  believed that would go over after a time. My brother was much  delighted at his reception, and, with hope beating high in his bosom,  lay down to rest.    He might, perhaps, have been sleeping an hour, when he was awakened by  the rays of a lamp, which fell dazzlingly upon his eyes. When he had  raised himself up, he believed himself dreaming, for there before him  stood the very same little, swarthy fellow of Orbasan's tent, a lamp  in his hand, his wide mouth distended with a disgusting laugh.  Mustapha pinched himself in the arm, and pulled his nose, in order to  see if he were really awake, but the figure remained as before.    \"What wishest thou by my bed?\" exclaimed Mustapha, recovering from his  amazement.    \"Do not disquiet yourself so much, my friend,\" answered the little  man. \"I made a good guess as to the motive that brought you hither.  Although your worthy countenance was still well remembered by me,  nevertheless, had I not with my own hand assisted to hang the Bashaw,  you might, perhaps, have deceived even me. Now, however, I am here"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24598"],[0,"A Modern History, From the Time of Luther to the Fall of Napoleon (#12)"],[1,"had rendered the reformation necessary. It lasted  twenty-two years, at different intervals, during the pontificate of  five popes. The Jesuits, just rising into notice, had considerable  influence in the council, in consequence of the learning and ability  of their representatives, and especially of Laynez, the general of the  order. The Dominicans and Franciscans manifested their accustomed  animosities and rivalries, and questions were continually proposed and  agitated, which divided the assembly. The French bishops, headed by  the Cardinal of Lorraine, were opposed to the high pretensions of the  Italians, especially of Cardinal Morone, the papal legate; but, by  artifice and management, the more strenuous adherents of the pope  attained their ends.    About the time the council assembled, died three distinguished  persons--Henry VIII. of England, Francis I., and Luther. Charles V.  was freed from his great rival, and from the only private person in  his dominions he had reason to fear. He now, in good earnest, turned  his attention to the internal state of his empire, and resolved to  crush the Reformation, and, by force, if it were necessary. He  commenced by endeavoring to amuse and deceive the Protestants, and  evinced that profound dissimulation, which was one of his  characteristics. He formed a strict alliance with the pope, made a  truce with Solyman, and won over to his side Maurice and other German  princes. His military preparations and his intrigues alarmed the  Protestants, and they prepared themselves for resistance. Religious  zeal seconded their military ardor. One of the largest armies, which  had been raised in Europe for a century, took the field, and Charles,  shut up in Ratisbon, was in no condition to fight. Unfortunately for  the Protestants, they negotiated instead of acting. The emperor was in  their power, but he was one of those few persons who remained haughty  and inflexible in the midst of calamities. He pronounced the ban of  the empire against the Protestant princes, who were no match for a man  who had spent his life in the field: they acted without concert, and  committed many errors. Their forces decreased, while those of the  emperor increased by large additions from Italy and Flanders. Instead  of decisive action, the Protestants dallied and procrastinated,  unwilling to make peace, and unwilling to face their sovereign. Their  army melted away, and nothing of importance was effected.    [Sidenote: Treachery of Maurice.]    Maurice, cousin to the Elector of Saxony, with a baseness to which  history scarcely affords a parallel, deserted his allies, and joined  the emperor, purely from ambitious motives, and invaded the  territories of his kinsman with twelve thousand men. The confederates  made overtures of peace, which being rejected, they separated, and  most of them submitted to the emperor. He treated them with  haughtiness and rigor, imposed on them most humiliating terms, forced  them to renounce the league of Smalcalde, to give up their military  stores, to admit garrisons into their cities, and to pay large  contributions in money.    The Elector of Saxony and the Landgrave of Hesse, however held out;  and such was the condition of the emperor, that he could not  immediately attack them. But the death of Francis gave him leisure to  invade Saxony, and the elector was defeated at the battle of  Muhlhausen, (1547,) and taken prisoner. The captive prince approached  the victor without sullenness or pride. \"The fortune of war,\" said he,  \"has made me your prisoner, most gracious emperor, and I hope to be  treated ----\" Here Charles interrupted him--\"And am I, at last,  acknowledged to be emperor? Charles of Ghent was the only title you  lately allowed me. You shall be treated as you deserve.\" At these  words he turned his back upon him with a haughty air.    [Sidenote: Captivity of the Landgrave of Hesse.]    The unfortunate prince was closely guarded by Spanish soldiers, and  brought to a trial before a court martial, at which presided the  infamous Duke of Alva, afterwards celebrated for his cruelties in  Holland. He was convicted of treason and rebellion, and sentenced to  death--a sentence which no court martial had a right to inflict on the  first prince of the empire. He was treated with ignominious harshness,  which he bore with great magnanimity, but finally made a treaty with  the emperor, by which, for the preservation of his life, he  relinquished his kingdom to Maurice.    The landgrave was not strong enough to resist the power of Charles,  after all his enemies were subdued, and he made his submission, though  Charles extorted the most rigorous conditions, he being required to  surrender his person, abandon the league of Smalcalde, implore pardon  on his knees, demolish his fortifications, and pay an enormous fine.  In short, it was an unconditional submission. Beside infinite  mortifications, he was detained a prisoner, which, on Charles's part,  was but injury added to insult--an act of fraud and injustice which  inspired the prince, and the Protestants, generally, with unbounded  indignation. The Elector of Brandenburg and Maurice in vain solicited  for his liberty, and showed the infamy to which he would be exposed if  he detained the landgrave a prisoner. But the emperor listened to  their remonstrances with the most provoking coolness, and showed very  plainly that he was resolved to crush all rebellion, suppress  Protestantism, and raise up an absolute throne in Germany, to the  subversion of its ancient constitution.    To all appearances, his triumph was complete. His great rival was  dead; his enemies were subdued and humiliated; Luther's voice was  hushed; and immense contributions filled the imperial treasury. He now  began to realize the dreams of his life. He was unquestionably, at  that time, the most absolute and powerful prince Europe has ever seen  since Charlemagne, with the exception of Napoleon.    But what an impressive moral does the history of human greatness  convey! The hour of triumph is often but the harbinger of defeat and  shame. \"Pride goeth before destruction.\" Charles V., with all his  policy and experience, overreached himself. The failure of his  ambitious projects and the restoration of Protestantism, were brought  about by instruments the least anticipated.    [Sidenote: Heroism of Maurice..]    [Sidenote: Misfortunes of Charles..]    The cause of Protestantism and the liberties of Germany were  endangered by the treachery of Maurice, who received, as his reward,  the great electorate of Saxony. He had climbed to the summit of glory  and power. Who would suppose that this traitor prince would desert the  emperor, who had so splendidly rewarded his services, and return to  the rescue of those princes whom he had so basely betrayed? But who  can thread the labyrinth of an intriguing and selfish heart? Who can  calculate the movements of an unprincipled and restless politician?  Maurice, at length, awoke to the perception of the real condition of  his country. He saw its liberties being overturned by the most  ambitious man whom ten centuries had produced. He saw the cause, which  his convictions told him was the true one, in danger of being wrecked.  He was, moreover, wounded by the pride, coldness, and undisguised  selfishness of the emperor. He was indignant that the landgrave, his  father-in-law, should be retained a prisoner, against all the laws of  honor and of justice. He resolved to come to the rescue of his  country. He formed his plans with the greatest coolness, and exercised  a power of dissimulation that has no parallel in history. But his  address was even greater than his hypocrisy. He gained the confidence  of the Protestants, without losing that of the emperor. He even  obtained the command of an army which Charles sent to reduce the  rebellious city of Magdeburg, and, while he was besieging the city, he  was negotiating with the generals who defended it for a general union  against the emperor. Magdeburg surrendered in 1551. Its chieftains  were secretly assured that the terms of capitulation should not be  observed. His next point was, to keep the army together until his  schemes were ripened, and then to arrest the emperor, whose thoughts  now centred on the council of Trent. So he proposed sending Protestant  divines to the council, but delayed their departure by endless  negotiations about the terms of a safe conduct. He, moreover, formed a  secret treaty with Henry II., the successor of Francis, whose  animosity against Charles was as intense as was that of his father.  When his preparations were completed, he joined his army in Thuringia,  and took the field against the emperor, who had no suspicion of his  designs, and who blindly trusted to him, deeming it impossible that a  man, whom he had so honored and rewarded, could turn against him.  March 18, 1552, Maurice published his manifesto, justifying his  conduct; and his reasons were, to secure the Protestant religion, to  maintain the constitution of the empire, and deliver the Landgrave of  Hesse from bondage. He was powerfully supported by the French king,  and, with a rapidly increasing army, marched towards Innspruck, where  the emperor was quartered. The emperor was thunderstruck when he heard  the tidings of his desertion, and was in no condition to resist him.  He endeavored to gain time by negotiations, but these were without  effect. Maurice, at the head of a large army, advanced rapidly into  Upper Germany. Castles and cities surrendered as he advanced, and so  rapid was his progress, that he came near taking the emperor captive.  Charles was obliged to fly, in the middle of the night, and to travel  on a litter by torchlight, amid the passes of the Alps. He scarcely  left Innspruck before Maurice entered it--but too late to gain the  prize he sought. The emperor rallied his armies, and a vigorous war  was carried on between the "]]]
