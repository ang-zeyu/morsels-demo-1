I think it must be admitted as  probable that the immediate objects of sense depend for their existence  upon physiological conditions in ourselves, and that, for example, the  coloured surfaces which we see cease to exist when we shut our eyes. But  it would be a mistake to infer that they are dependent upon mind, not  real while we see them, or not the sole basis for our knowledge of the  external world. This line of argument will be developed in the present  lecture.    The discrepancy between the world of physics and the world of sense,  which we shall consider in our fourth lecture, will be found to be more  apparent than real, and it will be shown that whatever there is reason  to believe in physics can probably be interpreted in terms of sense.    The instrument of discovery throughout is modern logic, a very different  science from the logic of the text-books and also from the logic of  idealism. Our second lecture has given a short account of modern logic  and of its points of divergence from the various traditional kinds of  logic.    In our last lecture, after a discussion of causality and free will, we  shall try to reach a general account of the logical-analytic method of  scientific philosophy, and a tentative estimate of the hopes of  philosophical progress which it allows us to entertain.    In this lecture, I wish to apply the logical-analytic method to one of  the oldest problems of philosophy, namely, the problem of our knowledge  of the external world. What I have to say on this problem does not  amount to an answer of a definite and dogmatic kind; it amounts only to  an analysis and statement of the questions involved, with an indication  of the directions in which evidence may be sought. But although not yet  a definite solution, what can be said at present seems to me to throw a  completely new light on the problem, and to be indispensable, not only  in seeking the answer, but also in the preliminary question as to what  parts of our problem may possibly have an ascertainable answer.    In every philosophical problem, our investigation starts from what may  be called \"data,\" by which I mean matters of common knowledge, vague,  complex, inexact, as common knowledge always is, but yet somehow  commanding our assent as on the whole and in some interpretation pretty  certainly true. In the case of our present problem, the common knowledge  involved is of various kinds. There is first our acquaintance with  particular objects of daily life--furniture, houses, towns, other  people, and so on. Then there is the extension of such particular  knowledge to particular things outside our personal experience, through  history and geography, newspapers, etc. And lastly, there is the  systematisation of all this knowledge of particulars by means of  physical science, which derives immense persuasive force from its  astonishing power of foretelling the future. We are quite willing to  admit that there may be errors of detail in this knowledge, but we  believe them to be discoverable and corrigible by the methods which have  given rise to our beliefs, and we do not, as practical men, entertain  for a moment the hypothesis that the whole edifice may be built on  insecure foundations. In the main, therefore, and without absolute  dogmatism as to this or that special portion, we may accept this mass of  common knowledge as affording data for our philosophical analysis.    It may be said--and this is an objection which must be met at the  outset--that it is the duty of the philosopher to call in question the  admittedly fallible beliefs of daily life, and to replace them by  something more solid and irrefragable. In a sense this is true, and in a  sense it is effected in the course of analysis. But in another sense,  and a very important one, it is quite impossible. While admitting that  doubt is possible with regard to all our common knowledge, we must  nevertheless accept that knowledge in the main if philosophy is to be  possible at all. There is not any superfine brand of knowledge,  obtainable by the philosopher, which can give us a standpoint from which  to criticise the whole of the knowledge of daily life. The most that can  be done is to examine and purify our common knowledge by an internal  scrutiny, assuming the canons by which it has been obtained, and  applying them with more care and with more precision. Philosophy cannot  boast of having achieved such a degree of certainty that it can have  authority to condemn the facts of experience and the laws of science.  The philosophic scrutiny, therefore, though sceptical in regard to every  detail, is not sceptical as regards the whole. That is to say, its  criticism of details will only be based upon their relation to other  details, not upon some external criterion which can be applied to all  the details equally. The reason for this abstention from a universal  criticism is not any dogmatic confidence, but its exact opposite; it is  not that common knowledge _must_ be true, but that we possess no  radically different kind of knowledge derived from some other source.  Universal scepticism, though logically irrefutable, is practically  barren; it can only, therefore, give a certain flavour of hesitancy to  our beliefs, and cannot be used to substitute other beliefs for them.    Although data can only be criticised by other data, not by an outside  standard, yet we may distinguish different grades of certainty in the  different kinds of common knowledge which we enumerated just now. What  does not go beyond our own personal sensible acquaintance must be for us  the most certain: the \"evidence of the senses\" is proverbially the least  open to question. What depends on testimony, like the facts of history  and geography which are learnt from books, has varying degrees of  certainty according to the nature and extent of the testimony. Doubts as  to the existence of Napoleon can only be maintained for a joke, whereas  the historicity of Agamemnon is a legitimate subject of debate. In  science, again, we find all grades of certainty short of the highest.  The law of gravitation, at least as an approximate truth, has acquired  by this time the same kind of certainty as the existence of Napoleon,  whereas the latest speculations concerning the constitution of matter  would be universally acknowledged to have as yet only a rather slight  probability in their favour. These varying degrees of certainty  attaching to different data may be regarded as themselves forming part  of our data; they, along with the other data, lie within the vague,  complex, inexact body of knowledge which it is the business of the  philosopher to analyse.    The first thing that appears when we begin to analyse our common  knowledge is that some of it is derivative, while some is primitive;  that is to say, there is some that we only believe because of something  else from which it has been inferred in some sense, though not  necessarily in a strict logical sense, while other parts are believed on  their own account, without the support of any outside evidence. It is  obvious that the senses give knowledge of the latter kind: the immediate  facts perceived by sight or touch or hearing do not need to be proved by  argument, but are completely self-evident. Psychologists, however, have  made us aware that what is actually given in sense is much less than  most people would naturally suppose, and that much of what at first  sight seems to be given is really inferred. This applies especially in  regard to our space-perceptions. For instance, we instinctively infer  the \"real\" size and shape of a visible object from its apparent size and  shape, according to its distance and our point of view. When we hear a  person speaking, our actual sensations usually miss a great deal of what  he says, and we supply its place by unconscious inference; in a foreign  language, where this process is more difficult, we find ourselves  apparently grown deaf, requiring, for example, to be much nearer the  stage at a theatre than would be necessary in our own country. Thus the  first step in the analysis of data, namely, the discovery of what is  really given in sense, is full of difficulty. We will, however, not  linger on this point; so long as its existence is realised, the exact  outcome does not make any very great difference in our main problem.    The next step in our analysis must be the consideration of how the  derivative parts of our common knowledge arise. Here we become involved  in a somewhat puzzling entanglement of logic and psychology.  Psychologically, a belief may be called derivative whenever it is caused  by one or more other beliefs, or by some fact of sense which is not  simply what the belief asserts. Derivative beliefs in this sense  constantly arise without any process of logical inference, merely by  association of ideas or some equally extra-logical process. From the  expression of a man's face we judge as to what he is feeling: we say we  _see_ that he is angry, when in fact we only see a frown. We do not  judge as to his state of mind by any logical process: the judgment grows  up, often without our being able to say what physical mark of emotion we  actually saw. In such a case, the knowledge is derivative  psychologically; but logically it is in a sense primitive, since it is  not the result of any logical deduction. There may or may not be a  possible deduction leading to the same result, but whether there is or  not, we certainly do not employ it. If we call a belief \"logically  primitive\" when it is not actually arrived at by a logical inference,  then innumerable beliefs are logically primitive which psychologically  are derivative. The separation of these two kinds of primitiveness is  vitally important to our present discussion.    When we reflect upon the beliefs which are logically but not  psychologically primitive, we find that, unless they can on reflection"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37122"],[0,"Hunting in Many Lands: The Book of the Boone and Crockett Club (#12)"],[1," was very near and came steadily  forward, stopping now and then to listen. We could hear him plainly as  his horns broke the twigs at every step--once or twice he lashed the  bushes with them. He repeated his grunts, ungh! ungh! every few steps.  He was so evidently reckless that, to take no chance, I allowed Chabot  to answer only once--with the short call. I say short call, in  distinction to the long modulated call which is used to good purpose in  Maine and New Brunswick, but which I have never known to succeed in this  part of Canada. The moose paused for a moment in the alders that formed  a close thicket at the water's edge, and I feared he had seen or scented  us; then suddenly and noiselessly he stepped out from a cove a short  hundred yards away. He had taken less than ten minutes from the first  call to his appearance.    At the first alarm we had pushed off and were floating quietly just by  the shore. The water was so shallow that the birch made, to my ears at  least, a frightful scraping as it pushed over the dead sticks that lay  in the water, and the wind was unfavorable. I never shall forget the  appearance that bull made as he stepped fiercely and proudly out, with  his head up, swinging a splendid set of antlers as lightly as straws. He  did not see us, but strode about ten yards into the shallow lake, where  the water scarcely covered his hoofs, and, first glancing away for a  second, turned like a flash and faced us full, looking down on us in  surprised disgust. He was greatly excited and the mane on his hump was  erect, increasing his natural height, and there was nothing timid or  deer-like in his appearance. I have seen in the arena a bull step out  from the darkened stall into the glare of sunlight, and gaze for a  moment at the picadors with a sort of indignant surprise; so this great  bull moose looked.    We gazed motionless at each other, I knowing that it was one of the  grandest and rarest sights on the American continent, and he thinking,  no doubt, what a disgraceful imitation of a cow the motionless canoe  made. Chabot's breath was coming hard behind me, and I felt the birch  bark quiver.    As I raised my rifle, I realized that it had suddenly grown very dark  under this western bank, and the bull precisely resembled in color the  background, and, large as he was, made a very poor mark. The tall grass,  which I had looked over in watching him, now sticking up in front of the  sights, bothered me. I fired at the root of his neck, and the rifle gave  a suppressed roar in the heavy air and the smoke hung like a pall. The  bull ran straight forward, hesitated as though about to charge, then  turned and made wonderful speed along the lake shore. The moment I could  see him I fired again. In the dim twilight he was almost out of sight.  When the smoke cleared he was gone.    Neither of us moved. It was too frightful to miss such an immense  creature at that range. We heard him crash up the hillside and then stop  a short distance back in the wood. Then I knew he either was down or had  turned, unless he had found an open lumber road, where his horns would  make no sound; for a moose can go in the most mysterious manner when he  chooses to be quiet--but there was nothing quiet about this bull.    Chabot declared that he had heard him cough, but I did not believe it. I  pointed to the spot where he had entered the bush, and a moment later  the canoe grated on the beach. There were the huge tracks with the hoofs  wide spread, and the trail entering an old lumber road.    All this took less time to happen than to read, and yet it was now dark,  so quickly had night fallen. By straining my eyes I saw it was 7  o'clock--just two hours after the first bull was killed. Chabot wanted  to go back to camp, which was the proper thing to do, especially as I  had now just one cartridge left. I had only taken a handful with me that  morning.    We entered the forest foot by foot, Chabot following the trail where I  could scarcely see to step. A few yards in and the track turned from the  old road into the thick bush, and we knew the moose was near. A little  further, and we scarcely moved--stepping like cats from tree to tree,  expecting every second to hear an angry grunt and have the bull emerge  from the impenetrable veil of night that hung around us.    At last we came to a windfall, and we were for some time at a loss to  find whether he had gone across or around it. In lighting a match with  extreme caution, the light fell on a tall moose wood stem about as large  as one's finger. Four feet from the ground it was dripping with bright  red blood. The coughing Chabot had heard was now, we thought, explained,  and the game hard hit. We decided to go back to camp; for, as my guide  put it very clearly, the wounded bull would either fight or run. I  wasn't anxious for the first alternative in the dark and tangled wood,  with one cartridge; and the second meant a long chase on the morrow. If  we left him until the morning, he would be either dead or too stiff from  his wound to go far.    So back we went to camp, amply repaid by the events of two hours for  weeks of hardship and exposure. Just at daylight the next morning, as we  were leaving camp, prepared to take and keep the trail of that bull if  it led to Hudson Bay, my brother appeared with Jocko. He had had no  breakfast, and had come a long distance through a frightful bush in  order to be in at the death, as he had heard the firing, and shrewdly  suspected that in the dusk a wounded moose was the result.    \"From the tracks at my lake,\" said he, as he strode up to the fire,  \"there are two bull moose around here--a large and a small one; which  did you get?\"    \"Both,\" replied Chabot.    We took the trail at the water's edge, and found it smeared with blood.  The bull could not have gone far. A short walk brought us to the  windfall where we had turned back the night before, and which had seemed  so deep in the woods.    A hundred yards beyond it lay the bull on his right side. The second  shot had struck him in the center of the left ham and ranged through  him. The meat was spoiled, as was the hide--that is, the hair came out  so badly that it was not worth while to prepare it; but the neck and  scalp were perfect, except a bad scar on the forehead, received in  fighting.    He was a grand sight as he lay dead in that silent autumn forest--for I  never can get over the impression that somehow or other the moose is a  survival of a long past order of nature, a fit comrade for the mammoth  and the cave bear. He was short and thickset, with immense chest  power--probably a swamp moose. The neck was short and stout, and he had  a Jewish cast of nose. No bell--merely the common dewlap. He measured at  the shoulder 6 feet 6 inches; 9 feet 8-1/2 inches from nose to tip of  tail; girth at shoulders, 6 feet 2-1/2 inches. We skinned and  decapitated the moose, one after the other. The meat of both was  completely spoiled, and it seemed wicked to leave those two huge  carcasses to the bears and wolves; but there was no help for it, so we  started for Mattawa. I doubt if we could have carried out any of the  meat if we had tried, for we had to throw away everything not absolutely  necessary on the long portages that followed. At last we reached  Rosiceau's, on Snake Lake, and, with the welcome the old man gave us,  felt quite at home once more. Then passing by the scenes of a former  hunt, we reached Fort Eddy, an old Hudson Bay post, and then the Ottawa  River. We ran the Cave rapids, and at sundown on a beautiful day the  town of Mattawa swung in sight, and the hunt was over.    The country we had traversed contained little except bears and moose. We  saw a few caribou tracks, and brought home with us a curious caribou  antler, which we found in the woods.    The fur animals have, within the last five years, been exterminated, and  the very few beaver that survive have abandoned their old habits, and  live in holes in the banks of the larger streams. We found traces of one  of these bank beaver, but he was probably traveling and we could not  catch him. A few mink were shot, but the country is completely stripped  of everything else of value. If the present law, prohibiting the  trapping of otter and beaver, can be enforced, perhaps the land may be  restocked, but it will take years. It is fit for nothing except fur and  timber, and, with efficient game wardens, could be made to produce a  large return from these sources. Partridges and loons abounded, but  ducks were seldom seen.    The lakes form a complete system of communication by means of easy  portages, but there are no streams that contain trout and no springs to  supply drinking water. This lack of fresh water caused us considerable  suffering, as the lake water is supposed to be dangerous, and a pail of  spring water, which we got at the start, was carried for days over  portages as our most precious baggage. We did not see a sign of a brook  trout during the entire trip, and I do not believe that there were any  in the waters we traversed. There may have been lake trout, but our  trolling produced only pike and pickerel.    This absence of small game and fish makes the country very  uninteresting, and the long monotony between most exciting events is the  greatest drawback to hunting on the Upper Ottawa.    _Madison Grant._          A Hunting Trip in India      Early in 1881 I landed at Bombay, intending to get as many varieties of  big game shooting as possible during the course of the year.
