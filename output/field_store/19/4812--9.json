I hoped  that my cold and distant attitude would check a possible existing  affection for me.    RITA: Possible existing affection! Fie! Now you are beginning to lie!  (_She jumps up and walks nervously through the room._) As though you had  not positively known that! (_Stepping in front of him_) Or what did you  take me for when I kissed you?    FRIEDRICH (_very much frightened, also rises_): O, Erna, I always----    RITA (_laughs_): You are delightful! Delightful! Still the same bashful  boy--who does not dare--(_she laughs and sits down again_.) Delightful.    FRIEDRICH (_after a silence, hesitatingly_): Well, are you going to  allow me to call you Erna again, as of yore?    RITA: As of yore. (_She sighs, then gaily_) If you care to.    FRIEDRICH (_happy_): Yes? May I?    RITA (_heartily_): O, yes, Fritz. That's better, isn't it? It sounds  more natural, eh?    FRIEDRICH (_presses her hand and sighs_): Yes, really. You take a heavy  load from me. Everything that I want to say to you can be done so much  better in the familiar tone.    RITA: Oh! Have you still so much to say to me?    FRIEDRICH: Well--but now tell me first: how was it possible for you to  undertake such a step. What prompted you to leave so suddenly? Erna,  Erna, how could you do that?    RITA (_proudly_): How I could? Can you ask me that? Do you really not  know it?    FRIEDRICH (_softly_): Oh, yes; I do know it, but--it takes so much to do  that.    RITA: Not more than was in me.    FRIEDRICH: One thing I must confess to you, although it was really bad  of me. But I knew no way out of it. I felt relieved after you had gone.    RITA: Well, then, that was _your_ heroism.    FRIEDRICH: Do not misunderstand me. I knew my father had----    RITA: Yes, yes--but do not talk about it any more.    FRIEDRICH: You are right. It was boyish of me. It did not last long, and  then I mourned for you--not less than your parents. Oh, Erna! If you  would see your parents now. They have aged terribly. Your father has  lost his humor altogether, and is giving full vent to his old passion  for red wine. Your mother is always ailing, hardly ever leaves the  house, and both, even though they never lose a word about it, cannot  reconcile themselves to the thought that their only child left them.    RITA (_after a pause, awakens from her meditation, harshly_): Perhaps  you were sent by my father?    FRIEDRICH: No--why?    RITA: Then I would show you the door.    FRIEDRICH: Erna!    RITA: A man, who ventured to pay his debts with me----    FRIEDRICH: How so; what do you mean?    RITA: Oh--let's drop that. Times were bad. But to-day the house of  Hattenbach enjoys its good old standing, as you say, and has overcome  the crisis. Then your father must have had some consideration--without  me. Well, then.----And Rudolstadt still stands--on the old spot. That's  the main thing. But now let us talk about something else, I beg of you.    FRIEDRICH: No, no, Erna. What you allude to, that----do you really  believe my father had----    RITA: Your father had grown used to buy and attain everything in life  through money. Why not buy me also? And he had already received the  promise--not from me, but from my father. But I am free! I ran away and  am my own mistress! (_With haughtiness._) A young girl, all alone! Down  with the gang!    (_Friedrich is silent and holds his head._)    RITA (_steps up to him and touches his shoulder, in a friendly manner_):  Don't be sad. At that time your father was the stronger, and----Life is  not otherwise. After all, one must assert oneself.    FRIEDRICH: But he robbed you of your happiness.    RITA (_jovially_): Who knows? It is just as well.    FRIEDRICH (_surprised_): Is that possible? Do you call that happiness,  this being alone?    RITA: Yes. That is MY happiness--my freedom, and I love it with  jealousy, for I fought for it myself.    FRIEDRICH (_bitterly_): A great happiness! Outside of family ties,  outside the ranks of respectable society.    RITA (_laughs aloud, but without bitterness_): Respectable society! Yes.  I fled from that--thank Heaven. (_harshly_) But if you do not come in  the name of my father, what do you want here? Why do you come? For what  purpose? What do you want of me?    FRIEDRICH: Erna, you ask that in a strange manner.    RITA: Well, yes. I have a suspicion that you--begrudge me my liberty.  How did you find me, anyway?    FRIEDRICH: Yes, that was hard enough.    RITA: Rita Revera is not so unknown.    FRIEDRICH: Rita Revera! Oh, no! How often I have read that name these  last years--in the newspapers in Berlin, on various placards, in large  letters. But how could I ever have thought that you were meant by it?    RITA (_laughs_): Why did you not go to the \"Winter Garden\" when you were  in Berlin?    FRIEDRICH: I never frequent such places.    RITA: Pardon me! Oh, I always forget the old customs.    FRIEDRICH: Oh, please, please, dear Erna; not in this tone of voice!    RITA: Which tone?    FRIEDRICH: Erna! Do not make matters so difficult for me. See, after I  had finally discovered, through an agency in Berlin, and after hunting a  long time, that you were the famous Revera, I was terribly shocked at  first, terribly sad, and, for a moment, I thought of giving up  everything. My worst fears were over. I had the assurance that you lived  in good, and as I now see, in comfortable circumstances. But, on the  other hand, I had to be prepared that you might have grown estranged to  the world in which I live--that we could hardly understand each other.    RITA: Hm! Shall I tell you what was your ideal--how you would have liked  to find me again? As a poor seamstress, in an attic room, who, during  the four years, had lived in hunger and need--but respectably, that is  the main point. Then you would have stretched forth your kind arms, and  the poor, pale little dove would have gratefully embraced you. Will you  deny that you have imagined it thus and even wished for it?    FRIEDRICH (_looks at her calmly_): Well, is there anything wrong about  it?    RITA: But how did it happen that, regardless of this, of this  disappointment, you, nevertheless, continued to search for me?    FRIEDRICH: Thank goodness, at the right moment I recollected your clear,  silvery, childlike laughter. Right in the midst of my petty scruples it  resounded in my ears, as at the time when you ridiculed my gravity. Do  you still remember that time, Erna?    (_Rita is silent._)    BERTHA (_enters with an enormous bouquet of dark red roses_): My  lady--from the Count.    RITA (_jumps up, nervously excited_): Roses! My dark roses! Give them to  me! Ah! (_She holds them toward Friedrich and asks_) Did he say  anything?    BERTHA: No, said nothing, but----    FRIEDRICH (_shoves the bouquet, which she holds up closely to his face,  aside_): I thank you.    RITA (_without noticing him, to Bertha_): Well?    BERTHA (_pointing to the bouquet_): The Count has written something on a  card.    RITA: His card? Where? (_She searches among the flowers_) Oh, here!  (_She reads; then softly to Bertha_) It is all right.    (_Bertha leaves_.)    RITA (_reads again_): \"Pour prendre conge.\" (_With an easy sigh_) Yes,  yes.    FRIEDRICH: What is the matter?    RITA: Sad! His education was hardly half finished and he already  forsakes me.    FRIEDRICH: What do you mean? I do not understand you at all.    RITA (_her mind is occupied_): Too bad. Now he'll grow entirely stupid.    FRIEDRICH (_rises importantly_): Erna, answer me. What relationship  existed between you and the Count?    RITA (_laughs_): What business is that of yours?    FRIEDRICH (_solemnly_): Erna! Whatever it might have been, this will not  do any longer.    RITA (_gaily_): No, no; you see it is already ended.    FRIEDRICH: No, Erna, that must all be ended. You must get out of all  this--entirely--and forever.    RITA (_looks at him surprised and inquiringly_): Hm! Strange person.    FRIEDRICH (_grows more eager and walks up and down in the room_): Such a  life is immoral. You must recognize it. Yes, and I forbid you to live on  in this fashion. I have the right to demand it of you.    RITA (_interrupts him sharply_): Demand? You demand something of me?    FRIEDRICH: Yes, indeed, demand! Not for me--no--in the name of morals.  That which I ask of you is simply a moral demand, do you understand, a  moral demand, which must be expected of every woman.    RITA: \"Must!\" And why?    FRIEDRICH: Because--because--because--well, dear me--because--otherwise  everything will stop!    RITA: What will stop? Life?    FRIEDRICH: No, but morals.    RITA: Ah, I thank you. Now I understand you. One must be moral  because--otherwise morality will stop.    FRIEDRICH: Why, yes. That is very simple.    RITA: Yes--now, please, what would I have to do in order to fulfill your  demand? I am curious like a child now, and shall listen obediently.  (_She sits down again._)    FRIEDRICH (_also sits down and grasps her hand, warmly_): Well, see, my  dear Erna, everything can still be undone. In Rudolstadt everybody  believes you are in England with relatives. Even if you have never been  there----    RITA: Often enough. My best engagements.    FRIEDRICH: So much the better. Then you certainly speak English?    RITA: Of course.    FRIEDRICH: And you are acquainted with English customs. Excellent. Oh,  Erna. Your father will be pleased, he once confessed to me, when he had  a little too much wine. You know him: he grows sentimental then.    RITA (_to herself_): They are all that way.    FRIEDRICH: How?    RITA: Oh, nothing. Please continue. Well--I could come back?    FRIEDRICH: Certainly! Fortunately, during these last years, since you  have grown so famous, nobody has----    RITA: I have grown notorious only within a year.    FRIEDRICH: Well, most likely nobody in Rudolstadt has ever seen you on  the boards. In one word, you _must_ return. "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27250"],[0,"What I Saw in America (#12)"],[1," scaffolding  away, and leave us nothing but a mere building. If they would only take  the building away and leave us a beautiful scaffolding, it would in most  cases be a gain to the loveliness of earth. If I could analyse what it  is that lifts the heart about the lightness and clarity of such a white  and wooden skeleton, I could explain what it is that is really charming  about New York; in spite of its suffering from the curse of  cosmopolitanism and even the provincial superstition of progress. It is  partly that all this destruction and reconstruction is an unexhausted  artistic energy; but it is partly also that it is an artistic energy  that does not take itself too seriously. It is first because man is here  a carpenter; and secondly because he is a stage carpenter. Indeed there  is about the whole scene the spirit of scene-shifting. It therefore  touches whatever nerve in us has since childhood thrilled at all  theatrical things. But the picture will be imperfect unless we realise  something which gives it unity and marks its chief difference from the  climate and colours of Western Europe. We may say that the back-scene  remains the same. The sky remained, and in the depths of winter it  seemed to be blue with summer; and so clear that I almost flattered  myself that clouds were English products like primroses. An American  would probably retort on my charge of scene-shifting by saying that at  least he only shifted the towers and domes of the earth; and that in  England it is the heavens that are shifty. And indeed we have changes  from day to day that would seem to him as distinct as different  magic-lantern slides; one view showing the Bay of Naples and the next  the North Pole. I do not mean, of course, that there are no changes in  American weather; but as a matter of proportion it is true that the most  unstable part of our scenery is the most stable part of theirs. Indeed  we might almost be pardoned the boast that Britain alone really  possesses the noble thing called weather; most other countries having to  be content with climate. It must be confessed, however, that they often  are content with it. And the beauty of New York, which is considerable,  is very largely due to the clarity that brings out the colours of varied  buildings against the equal colour of the sky. Strangely enough I found  myself repeating about this vista of the West two vivid lines in which  Mr. W. B. Yeats has called up a vision of the East:--           And coloured like the eastern birds       At evening in their rainless skies.      To invoke a somewhat less poetic parallel, even the untravelled  Englishman has probably seen American posters and trade advertisements  of a patchy and gaudy kind, in which a white house or a yellow motor-car  are cut out as in cardboard against a sky like blue marble. I used to  think it was only New Art, but I found that it is really New York.    It is not for nothing that the very nature of local character has gained  the nickname of local colour. Colour runs through all our experience;  and we all know that our childhood found talismanic gems in the very  paints in the paint-box, or even in their very names. And just as the  very name of 'crimson lake' really suggested to me some sanguine and  mysterious mere, dark yet red as blood, so the very name of 'burnt  sienna' became afterwards tangled up in my mind with the notion of  something traditional and tragic; as if some such golden Italian city  had really been darkened by many conflagrations in the wars of mediaeval  democracy. Now if one had the caprice of conceiving some city exactly  contrary to one thus seared and seasoned by fire, its colour might be  called up to a childish fancy by the mere name of 'raw umber'; and such  a city is New York. I used to be puzzled by the name of 'raw umber,'  being unable to imagine the effect of fried umber or stewed umber. But  the colours of New York are exactly in that key; and might be adumbrated  by phrases like raw pink or raw yellow. It is really in a sense like  something uncooked; or something which the satiric would call  half-baked. And yet the effect is not only beautiful, it is even  delicate. I had no name for this nuance; until I saw that somebody had  written of 'the pastel-tinted towers of New York'; and I knew that the  name had been found. There are no paints dry enough to describe all that  dry light; and it is not a box of colours but of crayons. If the  Englishman returning to England is moved at the sight of a block of  white chalk, the American sees rather a bundle of chalks. Nor can I  imagine anything more moving. Fairy tales are told to children about a  country where the trees are like sugar-sticks and the lakes like  treacle, but most children would feel almost as greedy for a fairyland  where the trees were like brushes of green paint and the hills were of  coloured chalks.    But here what accentuates this arid freshness is the fragmentary look of  the continual reconstruction and change. The strong daylight finds  everywhere the broken edges of things, and the sort of hues we see in  newly-turned earth or the white sections of trees. And it is in this  respect that the local colour can literally be taken as local character.  For New York considered in itself is primarily a place of unrest, and  those who sincerely love it, as many do, love it for the romance of its  restlessness. A man almost looks at a building as he passes to wonder  whether it will be there when he comes back from his walk; and the doubt  is part of an indescribable notion, as of a white nightmare of daylight,  which is increased by the very numbering of the streets, with its tangle  of numerals which at first makes an English head reel. The detail is  merely a symbol; and when he is used to it he can see that it is, like  the most humdrum human customs, both worse and better than his own. '271  West 52nd Street' is the easiest of all addresses to find, but the  hardest of all addresses to remember. He who is, like myself, so  constituted as necessarily to lose any piece of paper he has particular  reason to preserve, will find himself wishing the place were called  'Pine Crest' or 'Heather Crag' like any unobtrusive villa in Streatham.  But his sense of some sort of incalculable calculations, as of the  vision of a mad mathematician, is rooted in a more real impression. His  first feeling that his head is turning round is due to something really  dizzy in the movement of a life that turns dizzily like a wheel. If  there be in the modern mind something paradoxical that can find peace in  change, it is here that it has indeed built its habitation or rather is  still building and unbuilding it. One might fancy that it changes in  everything and that nothing endures but its invisible name; and even its  name, as I have said, seems to make a boast of novelty.    That is something like a sincere first impression of the atmosphere of  New York. Those who think that is the atmosphere of America have never  got any farther than New York. We might almost say that they have never  entered America, any more than if they had been detained like  undesirable aliens at Ellis Island. And indeed there are a good many  undesirable aliens detained in Manhattan Island too. But of that I will  not speak, being myself an alien with no particular pretensions to be  desirable. Anyhow, such is New York; but such is not the New World. The  great American Republic contains very considerable varieties, and of  these varieties I necessarily saw far too little to allow me to  generalise. But from the little I did see, I should venture on the  generalisation that the great part of America is singularly and even  strikingly unlike New York. It goes without saying that New York is very  unlike the vast agricultural plains and small agricultural towns of the  Middle West, which I did see. It may be conjectured with some confidence  that it is very unlike what is called the Wild and sometimes the Woolly  West, which I did not see. But I am here comparing New York, not with  the newer states of the prairie or the mountains, but with the other  older cities of the Atlantic coast. And New York, as it seems to me, is  quite vitally different from the other historic cities of America. It is  so different that it shows them all for the moment in a false light, as  a long white searchlight will throw a light that is fantastic and  theatrical upon ancient and quiet villages folded in the everlasting  hills. Philadelphia and Boston and Baltimore are more like those quiet  villages than they are like New York.    If I were to call this book 'The Antiquities of America,' I should give  rise to misunderstanding and possibly to annoyance. And yet the double  sense in such words is an undeserved misfortune for them. We talk of  Plato or the Parthenon or the Greek passion for beauty as parts of the  antique, but hardly of the antiquated. When we call them ancient it is  not because they have perished, but rather because they have survived.  In the same way I heard some New Yorkers refer to Philadelphia or  Baltimore as 'dead towns.' They mean by a dead town a town that has had  the impudence not to die. Such people are astonished to find an ancient  thing alive, just as they are now astonished, and will be increasingly  astonished, to find Poland or the Papacy or the French nation still  alive. And what I mean by Philadelphia and Baltimore being alive is  precisely what these people mean by their being dead; it is continuity;  it is the presence of the life first breathed into them and of the  purpose of their being; it is the benediction of the founders of the  colonies and the fathers of the republic. This tradition is truly to be  called life; for life alone can link the past and the future. It merely  means that as what was done yesterday makes some difference to-day, so  what is done to-day will make some difference to-morrow. In"]]]
