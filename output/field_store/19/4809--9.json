X. noted the hobbies of his victims which, by the way, did not always  coincide with the innocent occupations set against their names in the  more pretentious volume. Their follies and their weaknesses found a  place and were recorded at a length (as it might seem to the uninformed  observer) beyond the limit which charity allowed.    Lady Mary Bartholomew's name appeared not once, but many times, in the  erratic records which T. X. kept. There was a plain matter-of-fact and  wholly unobjectionable statement that she was born in 1874, that she was  the seventh daughter of the Earl of Balmorey, that she had one daughter  who rejoiced in the somewhat unpromising name of Belinda Mary, and such  further information as a man might get without going to a great deal of  trouble.    T. X., refreshing his memory from the little red book, wondered what  unexpected tragedy had sent Lady Bartholomew out of London in the middle  of the season. The information was that the lady was fairly well off at  this moment, and this fact made matters all the more puzzling and  almost induced him to believe that, after all, the story was true, and a  nervous breakdown really was the cause of her sudden departure. He sent  for Mansus.    \"You saw Lady Bartholomew off at Charing Cross, I suppose?\"    Mansus nodded.    \"She went alone?\"    \"She took her maid, but otherwise she was alone. I thought she looked  ill.\"    \"She has been looking ill for months past,\" said T. X., without any  visible expression of sympathy.    \"Did she take Belinda Mary?\"    Mansus was puzzled. \"Belinda Mary?\" he repeated slowly. \"Oh, you mean  the daughter. No, she's at a school somewhere in France.\"    T. X. whistled a snatch of a popular song, closed the little red book  with a snap and replaced it in his desk.    \"I wonder where on earth people dig up names like Belinda Mary?\" he  mused. \"Belinda Mary must be rather a weird little animal--the Lord  forgive me for speaking so about my betters! If heredity counts for  anything she ought to be something between a head waiter and a pack of  cards. Have you lost anything'?\"    Mansus was searching his pockets.    \"I made a few notes, some questions I wanted to ask you about and  Lady Bartholomew was the subject of one of them. I have had her under  observation for six months; do you want it kept up?\"    T. X. thought awhile, then shook his head.    \"I am only interested in Lady Bartholomew in so far as Kara is  interested in her. There is a criminal for you, my friend!\" he added,  admiringly.    Mansus busily engaged in going through the bundles of letters, slips  of paper and little notebooks he had taken from his pocket, sniffed  audibly.    \"Have you a cold?\" asked T. X. politely.    \"No, sir,\" was the reply, \"only I haven't much opinion of Kara as a  criminal. Besides, what has he got to be a criminal about? He has all  that he requires in the money department, he's one of the most popular  people in London, and certainly one of the best-looking men I've ever  seen in my life. He needs nothing.\"    T. X. regarded him scornfully.    \"You're a poor blind brute,\" he said, shaking his head; don't you know  that great criminals are never influenced by material desires, or by  the prospect of concrete gains? The man, who robs his employer's till  in order to give the girl of his heart the 25-pearl and ruby brooch her  soul desires, gains nothing but the glow of satisfaction which comes to  the man who is thought well of. The majority of crimes in the world are  committed by people for the same reason--they want to be thought well  of. Here is Doctor X. who murdered his wife because she was a drunkard  and a slut, and he dared not leave her for fear the neighbours would  have doubts as to his respectability. Here is another gentleman who  murders his wives in their baths in order that he should keep up some  sort of position and earn the respect of his friends and his associates.  Nothing roused him more quickly to a frenzy of passion than the  suggestion that he was not respectable. Here is the great financier, who  has embezzled a million and a quarter, not because he needed money,  but because people looked up to him. Therefore, he must build  great mansions, submarine pleasure courts and must lay out huge  estates--because he wished that he should be thought well of.    Mansus sniffed again.    \"What about the man who half murders his wife, does he do that to be  well thought of?\" he asked, with a tinge of sarcasm.    T. X. looked at him pityingly.    \"The low-brow who beats his wife, my poor Mansus,\" he said, \"does so  because she doesn't think well of him. That is our ruling passion,  our national characteristic, the primary cause of most crimes, big or  little. That is why Kara is a bad criminal and will, as I say, end his  life very violently.\"    He took down his glossy silk hat from the peg and slipped into his  overcoat.    \"I am going down to see my friend Kara,\" he said. \"I have a feeling that  I should like to talk with him. He might tell me something.\"    His acquaintance with Kara's menage had been mere hearsay. He had  interviewed the Greek once after his return, but since all his efforts  to secure information concerning the whereabouts of John Lexman and  his wife--the main reason for his visit--had been in vain, he had not  repeated his visit.    The house in Cadogan Square was a large one, occupying a corner site. It  was peculiarly English in appearance with its window boxes, its discreet  curtains, its polished brass and enamelled doorway. It had been the  town house of Lord Henry Gratham, that eccentric connoisseur of wine and  follower of witless pleasure. It had been built by him \"round a  bottle of port,\" as his friends said, meaning thereby that his first  consideration had been the cellarage of the house, and that when those  cellars had been built and provision made for the safe storage of his  priceless wines, the house had been built without the architect's being  greatly troubled by his lordship. The double cellars of Gratham House  had, in their time, been one of the sights of London. When Henry Gratham  lay under eight feet of Congo earth (he was killed by an elephant  whilst on a hunting trip) his executors had been singularly fortunate  in finding an immediate purchaser. Rumour had it that Kara, who was  no lover of wine, had bricked up the cellars, and their very existence  passed into domestic legendary.    The door was opened by a well-dressed and deferential man-servant and  T. X. was ushered into the hall. A fire burnt cheerily in a bronze grate  and T. X. had a glimpse of a big oil painting of Kara above the marble  mantle-piece.    \"Mr. Kara is very busy, sir,\" said the man.    \"Just take in my card,\" said T. X. \"I think he may care to see me.\"    The man bowed, produced from some mysterious corner a silver salver  and glided upstairs in that manner which well-trained servants have,  a manner which seems to call for no bodily effort. In a minute he  returned.    \"Will you come this way, sir,\" he said, and led the way up a broad  flight of stairs.    At the head of the stairs was a corridor which ran to the left and to  the right. From this there gave four rooms. One at the extreme end of  the passage on the right, one on the left, and two at fairly regular  intervals in the centre.    When the man's hand was on one of the doors, T. X. asked quietly, \"I  think I have seen you before somewhere, my friend.\"    The man smiled.    \"It is very possible, sir. I was a waiter at the Constitutional for some  time.\"    T. X. nodded.    \"That is where it must have been,\" he said.    The man opened the door and announced the visitor.    T. X. found himself in a large room, very handsomely furnished, but just  lacking that sense of cosiness and comfort which is the feature of the  Englishman's home.    Kara rose from behind a big writing table, and came with a smile and a  quick step to greet the visitor.    \"This is a most unexpected pleasure,\" he said, and shook hands warmly.    T. X. had not seen him for a year and found very little change in this  strange young man. He could not be more confident than he had been, nor  bear himself with a more graceful carriage. Whatever social success he  had achieved, it had not spoiled him, for his manner was as genial and  easy as ever.    \"I think that will do, Miss Holland,\" he said, turning to the girl who,  with notebook in hand, stood by the desk.    \"Evidently,\" thought T. X., \"our Hellenic friend has a pretty taste in  secretaries.\"    In that one glance he took her all in--from the bronze-brown of her hair  to her neat foot.    T. X. was not readily attracted by members of the opposite sex. He was  self-confessed a predestined bachelor, finding life and its incidence  too absorbing to give his whole mind to the serious problem of marriage,  or to contract responsibilities and interests which might divert his  attention from what he believed was the greater game. Yet he must be a  man of stone to resist the freshness, the beauty and the youth of this  straight, slender girl; the pink-and-whiteness of her, the aliveness  and buoyancy and the thrilling sense of vitality she carried in her very  presence.    \"What is the weirdest name you have ever heard?\" asked Kara laughingly.  \"I ask you, because Miss Holland and I have been discussing a begging  letter addressed to us by a Maggie Goomer.\"    The girl smiled slightly and in that smile was paradise, thought T. X.    \"The weirdest name?\" he repeated, \"why I think the worst I have heard  for a long time is Belinda Mary.\"    \"That has a familiar ring,\" said Kara.    T. X. was looking at the girl.    She was staring at him with a certain languid insolence which made him  curl up inside. Then with a glance at her employer she swept from the  room.    \"I ought to have introduced you,\" said Kara. \"That was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26908"],[0,"Conversations on Chemistry, V. 1-2 (#12)"],[1,"other part of its body. Besides, the breasts of aquatic birds  are exposed to cold not only from the temperature of the water, but also  from the velocity with which the breast of the bird strikes against it;  and likewise from the rapid evaporation occasioned in that part by the  air against which it strikes, after it has been moistened by dipping  from time to time into the water.    If you hold a finger of one hand motionless in a glass of water, and at  the same time move a finger of the other hand swiftly through water of  the same temperature, a different sensation will be soon perceived in  the different fingers.    Most animal substances, especially those which Providence has assigned  as a covering for animals, such as fur, wool, hair, skin, &c. are bad  conductors of heat, and are, on that account, such excellent  preservatives against the inclemency of winter, that our warmest apparel  is made of these materials.    EMILY.    Wood is, I dare say, not so good a conductor as metal, and it is for  that reason, no doubt, that silver teapots have always wooden handles.    MRS. B.    Yes; and it is the facility with which metals conduct caloric that made  you suppose that a silver pot radiated more caloric than an earthen one.  The silver pot is in fact hotter to the hand when in contact with it;  but it is because its conducting power more than counterbalances its  deficiency in regard to radiation.    We have observed that the most dense bodies are in general the best  conductors; and metals, you know, are of that class. Porous bodies, such  as the earths and wood, are worse conductors, chiefly, I believe, on  account of their pores being filled with air; for air is a remarkably  bad conductor.    CAROLINE.    It is a very fortunate circumstance that air should be a bad conductor,  as it tends to preserve the heat of the body when exposed to cold  weather.    MRS. B.    It is one of the many benevolent dispensations of Providence, in order  to soften the inclemency of the seasons, and to render almost all  climates habitable to man.    In fluids of different densities, the power of conducting heat varies no  less remarkably; if you dip your hand into this vessel full of mercury,  you will scarcely conceive that its temperature is not lower than that  of the atmosphere.    CAROLINE.    Indeed I know not how to believe it, it feels so extremely cold. --But  we may easily ascertain its true temperature by the thermometer. --It is  really not colder than the air;--the apparent difference then is  produced merely by the difference of the conducting power in mercury and  in air.    MRS. B.    Yes; hence you may judge how little the sense of feeling is to be relied  on as a test of the temperature of bodies, and how necessary a  thermometer is for that purpose.    It has indeed been doubted whether fluids have the power of conducting  caloric in the same manner as solid bodies. Count Rumford, a very few  years since, attempted to prove, by a variety of experiments, that  fluids, when at rest, were not at all endowed with this property.    CAROLINE.    How is that possible, since they are capable of imparting cold or heat  to us; for if they did not conduct heat, they would neither take it  from, nor give it to us?    MRS. B.    Count Rumford did not mean to say that fluids would not communicate  their heat to solid bodies; but only that heat does not pervade fluids,  that is to say, is not transmitted from one particle of a fluid to  another, in the same manner as in solid bodies.    EMILY.    But when you heat a vessel of water over the fire, if the particles of  water do not communicate heat to each other, how does the water become  hot throughout?    MRS. B.    By constant agitation. Water, as you have seen, expands by heat in the  same manner as solid bodies; the heated particles of water, therefore,  at the bottom of the vessel, become specifically lighter than the rest  of the liquid, and consequently ascend to the surface, where, parting  with some of their heat to the colder atmosphere, they are condensed,  and give way to a fresh succession of heated particles ascending from  the bottom, which having thrown off their heat at the surface, are in  their turn displaced. Thus every particle is successively heated at the  bottom, and cooled at the surface of the liquid; but as the fire  communicates heat more rapidly than the atmosphere cools the succession  of surfaces, the whole of the liquid in time becomes heated.    CAROLINE.    This accounts most ingeniously for the propagation of heat upwards. But  suppose you were to heat the upper surface of a liquid, the particles  being specifically lighter than those below, could not descend: how  therefore would the heat be communicated downwards?    MRS. B.    If there were no agitation to force the heated surface downwards, Count  Rumford assures us that the heat would not descend. In proof of this he  succeeded in making the upper surface of a vessel of water boil and  evaporate, while a cake of ice remained frozen at the bottom.    CAROLINE.    That is very extraordinary indeed!    MRS. B.    It appears so, because we are not accustomed to heat liquids by their  upper surface; but you will understand this theory better if I show you  the internal motion that takes place in liquids when they experience a  change of temperature. The motion of the liquid itself is indeed  invisible from the extreme minuteness of its particles; but if you mix  with it any coloured dust, or powder, of nearly the same specific  gravity as the liquid, you may judge of the internal motion of the  latter by that of the coloured dust it contains. --Do you see the small  pieces of amber moving about in the liquid contained in this phial?    CAROLINE.    Yes, perfectly.    MRS. B.    We shall now immerse the phial in a glass of hot water, and the motion  of the liquid will be shown, by that which it communicates to the amber.    EMILY.    I see two currents, the one rising along the sides of the phial, the  other descending in the centre: but I do not understand the reason of  this.    MRS. B.    The hot water communicates its caloric, through the medium of the phial,  to the particles of the fluid nearest to the glass; these dilate and  ascend laterally to the surface, where, in parting with their heat, they  are condensed, and in descending, form the central current.    CAROLINE.    This is indeed a very clear and satisfactory experiment; but how much  slower the currents now move than they did at first?    MRS. B.    It is because the circulation of particles has nearly produced an  equilibrium of temperature between the liquid in the glass and that in  the phial.    CAROLINE.    But these communicate laterally, and I thought that heat in liquids  could be propagated only upwards.    MRS. B.    You do not take notice that the heat is imparted from one liquid to the  other, through the medium of the phial itself, the external surface of  which receives the heat from the water in the glass, whilst its internal  surface transmits it to the liquid it contains. Now take the phial out  of the hot water, and observe the effect of its cooling.    EMILY.    The currents are reversed; the external current now descends, and the  internal one rises. --I guess the reason of this change:-- the phial  being in contact with cold air instead of hot water, the external  particles are cooled instead of being heated; they therefore descend and  force up the central particles, which, being warmer, are consequently  lighter.    MRS. B.    It is just so. Count Rumford hence infers that no alteration of  temperature can take place in a fluid, without an internal motion of its  particles, and as this motion is produced only by the comparative levity  of the heated particles, heat cannot be propagated downwards.    But though I believe that Count Rumford's theory as to heat being  incapable of pervading fluids is not strictly correct, yet there is, no  doubt, much truth in his observation, that the communication is  materially promoted by a motion of the parts; and this accounts for the  cold that is found to prevail at the bottom of the lakes in Switzerland,  which are fed by rivers issuing from the snowy Alps. The water of these  rivers being colder, and therefore more dense than that of the lakes,  subsides to the bottom, where it cannot be affected by the warmer  temperature of the surface; the motion of the waves may communicate this  temperature to some little depth, but it can descend no further than the  agitation extends.    EMILY.    But when the atmosphere is colder than the lake, the colder surface of  the water will descend, for the very reason that the warmer will not.    MRS. B.    Certainly: and it is on this account that neither a lake, nor any body  of water whatever, can be frozen until every particle of the water has  risen to the surface to give off its caloric to the colder atmosphere;  therefore the deeper a body of water is, the longer will be the time it  requires to be frozen.    EMILY.    But if the temperature of the whole body of water be brought down to the  freezing point, why is only the surface frozen?    MRS. B.    The temperature of the whole body is lowered, but not to the freezing  point. The diminution of heat, as you know, produces a contraction in  the bulk of fluids, as well as of solids. This effect, however, does not  take place in water below the temperature of 40 degrees, which is 8  degrees above the freezing point. At that temperature, therefore, the  internal motion, occasioned by the increased specific gravity of the  condensed particles, ceases; for when the water at the surface no longer  condenses, it will no longer descend, and leave a fresh surface exposed  to the atmosphere: this surface alone, therefore, will be further  exposed to its severity, and will soon be brought down to the freezing  point, when it becomes ice, which being a bad conductor"]]]
