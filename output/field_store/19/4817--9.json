Besides, am I not almost a Churchman myself?\" And  when one of them asked whether he was not going out of life in a spirit  of hatred, he returned, \"Why, good heavens! have I ever felt any?\"    An increasing noise was audible from the street, and Sand said again  that he was at their disposal and that he was ready. At this moment the  executioner came in with his two assistants; he was dressed in a long  wadded black coat, beneath which he hid his sword. Sand offered him his  hand affectionately; and as Mr. Widemann, embarrassed by the sword which  he wished to keep Sand from seeing, did not venture to come forward,  Sand said to him, \"Come along and show me your sword; I have never seen  one of the kind, and am curious to know what it is like.\"    Mr. Widemann, pale and trembling, presented the weapon to him; Sand  examined it attentively, and tried the edge with his finger.    \"Come,\" said he, \"the blade is good; do not tremble, and all will go  well.\" Then, turning to Mr. G----, who was weeping, he said to him, \"You  will be good enough, will you not, to do me the service of leading me to  the scaffold?\"    Mr. G----made a sign of assent with his head, for he could not answer.  Sand took his arm, and spoke for the third time, saying once more,  \"Well, what are you waiting for, gentlemen? I am ready.\"    When they reached the courtyard, Sand saw all the prisoners weeping at  their windows. Although he had never seen them, they were old friends of  his; for every time they passed his door, knowing that the student who  had killed Kotzebue lay within, they used to lift their chain, that he  might not be disturbed by the noise.    All Mannheim was in the streets that led to the place of execution, and  many patrols were passing up and down. On the day when the sentence was  announced the whole town had been sought through for a chaise in which  to convey Sand to the scaffold, but no one, not even the coach-builders,  would either let one out or sell one; and it had been necessary,  therefore, to buy one at Heidelberg without saying for what purpose.    Sand found this chaise in the courtyard, and got into it with Mr. G----.  Turning to him, he whispered in his ear, \"Sir, if you see me turn pale,  speak my name to me, my name only, do you hear? That will be enough.\"    The prison gate was opened, and Sand was seen; then every voice cried  with one impulse, \"Farewell, Sand, farewell!\"    And at the same time flowers, some of which fell into the carriage, were  thrown by the crowd that thronged the street, and from the windows. At  these friendly cries and at this spectacle, Sand, who until then had  shown no moment of weakness, felt tears rising in spite of himself, and  while he returned the greetings made to him on all sides, he murmured in  a low voice, \"O my God, give me courage!\"    This first outburst over, the procession set out amid deep silence; only  now and again same single voice would call out, \"Farewell, Sand!\" and a  handkerchief waved by some hand that rose out of the crowd would show  from what paint the last call came. On each side of the chaise walked  two of the prison officials, and behind the chaise came a second  conveyance with the municipal authorities.    The air was very cold: it had rained all night, and the dark and cloudy  sky seemed to share in the general sadness. Sand, too weak to remain  sitting up, was half lying upon the shoulder of Mr. G-----, his  companion; his face was gentle, calm and full of pain; his brow free and  open, his features, interesting though without regular beauty, seemed to  have aged by several years during the fourteen months of suffering that  had just elapsed. The chaise at last reached the place of execution,  which was surrounded by a battalion of infantry; Sand lowered his eyes  from heaven to earth and saw the scaffold. At this sight he smiled  gently, and as he left the carriage he said, \"Well, God has given me  strength so far.\"    The governor of the prison and the chief officials lifted him that he  might go up the steps. During that short ascent pain kept him bowed, but  when he had reached the top he stood erect again, saying, \"Here then is  the place where I am to die!\"    Then before he came to the chair on which he was to be seated for the  execution, he turned his eyes towards Mannheim, and his gaze travelled  over all the throng that surrounded him; at that moment a ray of  sunshine broke through the clouds. Sand greeted it with a smile and sat  down.    Then, as, according to the orders given, his sentence was to be read to  him a second time, he was asked whether he felt strong enough to hear it  standing. Sand answered that he would try, and that if his physical  strength failed him, his moral strength would uphold him. He rose  immediately from the fatal chair, begging Mr. G----to stand near enough  to support him if he should chance to stagger. The precaution was  unnecessary, Sand did not stagger.    After the judgment had been read, he sat down again and said in a laud  voice, \"I die trusting in God.\"    But at these words Mr. G------interrupted him.    \"Sand,\" said he, \"what did you promise?\"    \"True,\" he answered; \"I had forgotten.\" He was silent, therefore, to the  crowd; but, raising his right hand and extending it solemnly in the air,  he said in a low voice, so that he might be heard only by those who were  around him, \"I take God to witness that I die for the freedom of  Germany.\"    Then, with these words, he did as Conradin did with his glove; he threw  his rolled-up handkerchief over the line of soldiers around him, into  the midst of the people.    Then the executioner came to cut off his hair; but Sand at first  objected.    \"It is for your mother,\" said Mr. Widemann.    \"On your honour, sir?\" asked Sand.    \"On my honour.\"    \"Then do it,\" said Sand, offering his hair to the executioner.    Only a few curls were cut off, those only which fell at the back, the  others were tied with a ribbon on the top of the head. The executioner  then tied his hands on his breast, but as that position was oppressive  to him and compelled him an account of his wound to bend his head, his  hands were laid flat on his thighs and fixed in that position with  ropes. Then, when his eyes were about to be bound, he begged Mr.  Widemann to place the bandage in such a manner that he could see the  light to his last moment. His wish was fulfilled.    Then a profound and mortal stillness hovered over the whole crowd and  surrounded the scaffold. The executioner drew his sword, which flashed  like lightning and fell. Instantly a terrible cry rose at once from  twenty thousand bosoms; the head had not fallen, and though it had sunk  towards the breast still held to the neck. The executioner struck a  second time, and struck off at the same blow the head and a part of the  hand.    In the same moment, notwithstanding the efforts of the soldiers, their  line was broken through; men and women rushed upon the scaffold, the  blood was wiped up to the last drop with handkerchiefs; the chair upon  which Sand had sat was broken and divided into pieces, and those who  could not obtain one, cut fragments of bloodstained wood from the  scaffold itself.    The head and body were placed in a coffin draped with black, and carried  back, with a large military escort, to the prison. At midnight the body  was borne silently, without torches or lights, to the Protestant  cemetery, in which Kotzebue had been buried fourteen months previously.  A grave had been mysteriously dug; the coffin was lowered into it, and  those who were present at the burial were sworn upon the New Testament  not to reveal the spot where Sand was buried until such time as they  were freed from their oath. Then the grave was covered again with the  turf, that had been skilfully taken off, and that was relaid on the same  spat, so that no new grave could be perceived; then the nocturnal  gravediggers departed, leaving guards at the entrance.    There, twenty paces apart, Sand and Kotzebue rest: Kotzebue opposite the  gate in the most conspicuous spot of the cemetery, and beneath a tomb  upon which is engraved this inscription:    \"The world persecuted him without pity, Calumny was his sad portion, He  found no happiness save in the arms of his wife, And no repose save in  the bosom of death. Envy dogged him to cover his path with thorns, Love  bade his roses blossom; May Heaven pardon him As he pardons earth!\"    In contrast with this tall and showy monument, standing, as we have  said, in the most conspicuous spot of the cemetery, Sand's grave must be  looked far in the corner to the extreme left of the entrance gate; and a  wild plum tree, some leaves of which every passing traveller carries  away, rises alone upon the grave, which is devoid of any inscription.    As far the meadow in which Sand was executed, it is still called by the  people \"Sand's Himmelsfartsweise,\" which signifies \"The manner of Sand's  ascension.\"    Toward the end of September, 1838, we were at Mannheim, where I had  stayed three days in order to collect all the details I could find about  the life and death of Karl-Ludwig Sand. But at the end of these three  days, in spite of my active investigations, these details still remained  extremely incomplete, either because I applied in the wrong quarters, or  because, being a foreigner, I inspired same distrust in those to whom I  applied. I was leaving Mannheim, therefore, somewhat disappointed, and  after having visited the little Protestant cemetery where Sand and  Kotzebue are buried at twenty paces from each other, I had ordered my  driver to take the road to Heidelberg, when, after going a few yards,  he, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2746"],[0,"Urbain Grandier (#12)"],[1,"26th having made increased  precautions necessary, they considered it would be well to apply to the  bishop for a new commission, wherein he should appoint certain  ecclesiastics to represent him during the exorcisms to come. Barre  himself went to Poitiers to make this request. It was immediately  granted, and the bishop appointed Bazile, senior-canon of Champigny, and  Demorans, senior canon of Thouars, both of whom were related to some of  Grandier's adversaries. The following is a copy of the new commission:    \"Henri-Louis le Chataignier de la Rochepezai, by the divine will Bishop  of Poitiers, to the senior canons of the Chatelet de Saint-Pierre de  Thouars et de Champigny-sur-Vese, greeting:    \"We by these presents command you to repair to the town of Loudun, to  the convent of the nuns of Sainte-Ursule, to be present at the exorcisms  which will be undertaken by Sieur Barre upon some nuns of the said  convent who are tormented by evil spirits, we having thereto authorised  the said Barre. You are also to draw up a report of all that takes  place, and for this purpose are to take any clerk you may choose with  you.    \"Given and done at Poitiers, November 28th, 1632.    \"(Signed) HENRI LOUIS, Bishop of Poitiers. \"(Countersigned) By order of  the said Lord Bishop, \"MICHELET\"    These two commissioners having been notified beforehand, went to Loudun,  where Marescot, one of the queen's chaplains, arrived at the same time;  for the pious queen, Anne of Austria, had heard so many conflicting  accounts of the possession of the Ursuline nuns, that she desired, for  her own edification, to get to the bottom of the affair. We can judge  what importance the case was beginning to assume by its being already  discussed at court.    In spite of the notice which had been sent them that the nuns would not  receive them, the bailiff and the civil lieutenant fearing that the  royal envoy would allow himself to be imposed on, and would draw up an  account which would cast doubt on the facts contained in their reports,  betook themselves to the convent on December 1st, the day on which the  exorcisms were to recommence, in the presence of the new commissioners.  They were accompanied by their assessor, by the provost's lieutenant,  and a clerk. They had to knock repeatedly before anyone seemed to hear  them, but at length a nun opened the door and told them they could not  enter, being suspected of bad faith, as they had publicly declared that  the possession was a fraud and an imposture. The bailiff, without  wasting his time arguing with the sister, asked to see Barre, who soon  appeared arrayed in his priestly vestments, and surrounded by several  persons, among whom was the queen's chaplain. The bailiff complained  that admittance had been refused to him and those with him, although he  had been authorised to visit the convent by the Bishop of Poitiers.  Barre' replied that he would not hinder their coming in, as far as it  concerned him.    \"We are here with the intention of entering,\" said the bailiff, \"and  also for the purpose of requesting you to put one or two questions to  the demon which we have drawn up in terms which are in accordance with  what is prescribed in the ritual. I am sure you will not refuse,\" he  added, turning with a bow to Marescot, \"to make this experiment in the  presence of the queen's chaplain, since by that means all those  suspicions of imposture can be removed which are unfortunately so rife  concerning this business.\"    \"In that respect I shall do as I please, and not as you order me,\" was  the insolent reply of the exorcist.    \"It is, however, your duty to follow legal methods in your procedure,\"  returned the bailiff, \"if you sincerely desire the truth; for it would  be an affront to God to perform a spurious miracle in His honour, and a  wrong to the Catholic faith, whose power is in its truth, to attempt to  give adventitious lustre to its doctrines by the aid of fraud and  deception.\"    \"Sir,\" said Barre, \"I am a man of honour, I know my duty and I shall  discharge it; but as to yourself, I must recall to your recollection  that the last time you were here you left the chapel in anger and  excitement, which is an attitude of mind most unbecoming in one whose  duty it is to administer justice.\"    Seeing that these recriminations would have no practical result, the  magistrates cut them short by reiterating their demand for admittance;  and on this being refused, they reminded the exorcists that they were  expressly prohibited from asking any questions tending to cast a slur on  the character of any person or persons whatever, under pain of being  treated as disturbers of the public peace. At this warning Barre, saying  that he did not acknowledge the bailiff's jurisdiction, shut the door in  the faces of the two magistrates.    As there was no time to lose if the machinations of his enemies were to  be brought to nought, the bailiff and the civil lieutenant advised  Grandier to write to the Archbishop of Bordeaux, who had once already  extricated him from imminent danger, setting forth at length his present  predicament; this letter; accompanied by the reports drawn up by the  bailiff and the civil lieutenant, were sent off at once by a trusty  messenger to His Grace of Escoubleau de Sourdis. As soon as he received  the despatches, the worthy prelate seeing how grave was the crisis, and  that the slightest delay might be fatal to Grandier, set out at once for  his abbey of Saint-Jouinles-Marmes, the place in which he had already  vindicated in so striking a manner the upright character of the poor  persecuted priest by a fearless act of justice.    It is not difficult to realise what a blow his arrival was to those who  held a brief for the evil spirits in possession; hardly had he reached  Saint-Jouin than he sent his own physician to the convent with orders to  see the afflicted nuns and to test their condition, in order to judge if  the convulsions were real or simulated. The physician arrived, armed  with a letter from the archbishop, ordering Mignon to permit the bearer  to make a thorough examination into the position of affairs. Mignon  received the physician with all the respect due to him who sent him, but  expressed great regret that he had not come a little sooner, as, thanks  to his (Mignon's) exertions and those of Barre, the devils had been  exorcised the preceding day. He nevertheless introduced the archbishop's  envoy to the presence of the superior and Sister Claire, whose demeanour  was as calm as if they had never been disturbed by any agitating'  experiences. Mignon's statement being thus confirmed, the doctor  returned to Saint-Jouin, the only thing to which he could bear testimony  being the tranquillity which reigned at the moment in the convent.    The imposture being now laid so completely bare, the archbishop was  convinced that the infamous persecutions to which it had led would cease  at once and for ever; but Grandier, better acquainted with the character  of his adversaries, arrived on the 27th of December at the abbey and  laid a petition at the archbishop's feet. In this document he set forth  that his enemies having formerly brought false and slanderous  accusations, against him of which, through the justice of the  archbishop, he had been able to clear himself, had employed themselves  during the last three months in inventing and publishing as a fact that  the petitioner had sent evil spirits into the bodies of nuns in the  Ursuline convent of Loudun, although he had never spoken to any of the  sisterhood there; that the guardianship of the sisters who, it was  alleged, were possessed, and the task of exorcism, had been entrusted to  Jean Mignon and Pierre Barre, who had in the most unmistakable manner  shown themselves to be the mortal enemies of the petitioner; that in the  reports drawn up by the said Jean Mignon and Pierre Barre, which  differed so widely from those made by the bailiff and the civil  lieutenant, it was boastfully alleged that three or four times devils  had been driven out, but that they had succeeded in returning and taking  possession of their victims again and again, in virtue of successive  pacts entered into between the prince of darkness and the petitioner;  that the aim of these reports and allegations was to destroy the  reputation of the petitioner and excite public opinion against him; that  although the demons had been put to flight by the arrival of His Grace,  yet it was too probable that as soon as he was gone they would return to  the charge; that if, such being the case, the powerful support of the  archbishop were not available, the innocence of the petitioner, no  matter how strongly established, would by the cunning tactics of his  inveterate foes be obscured and denied: he, the petitioner, therefore  prayed that, should the foregoing reasons prove on examination to be  cogent, the archbishop would be pleased to prohibit Barre, Mignon, and  their partisans, whether among the secular or the regular clergy, from  taking part in any future exorcisms, should such be necessary, or in the  control of any persons alleged to be possessed; furthermore, petitioner  prayed that His Grace would be pleased to appoint as a precautionary  measure such other clerics and lay persons as seemed to him suitable, to  superintend the administration of food and medicine and the rite of  exorcism to those alleged to be possessed, and that all the treatment  should be carried out in the presence of magistrates.    The archbishop accepted the petition, and wrote below it:    \"The present petition having been seen by us and the opinion of our  attorney having been taken in the matter, we have sent the petitioner in  advance of our said attorney back to Poitiers, that justice may be done  him, and in the meantime we have appointed Sieur Barre, Pere l'Escaye, a  Jesuit residing in Poitiers, Pere Gaut of the Oratory,"]]]
