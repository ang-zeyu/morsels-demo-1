[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2897"],[0,"The Sequel of Appomattox: A Chronicle of the Reunion of the States (#12)"],[1,"were enacted by the state governments set up by President  Johnson. The views of the dominant North may be discerned in part in  the organization and administration of the Freedmen's Bureau. The two  sections saw the same problem from different angles, and their proposed  solutions were of necessity opposed in principle and in practice.    The South desired to fit the emancipated Negro race into the new social  order by frankly recognizing his inferiority to the whites. In some  things racial separation was unavoidable. New legislation consequently  must be enacted, because the slave codes were obsolete; because the  old laws made for the small free Negro class did not meet present  conditions; and because the emancipated blacks could not be brought  conveniently and at once under laws originally devised for a white  population. The new laws must meet many needs; family life, morals, and  conduct must be regulated; the former slave must be given a status in  court in order that he might be protected in person and property; the  old, the infirm, and the orphans must be cared for; the white race must  be protected from lawless blacks and the blacks from unscrupulous and  violent whites; the Negro must have an opportunity for education; and  the roving blacks must be forced to get homes, settle down, and go to  work.    Pending such legislation the affairs of the Negro remained in control  of the unpopular Freedmen's Bureau--a \"system of espionage,\" as Judge  Clayton of Alabama called it, and, according to Governor Humphreys of  Mississippi, \"a hideous curse\" under which white men were persecuted and  pillaged. Judge Memminger of South Carolina, in a letter to President  Johnson, emphasized the fact that the whites of England and the United  States gained civil and political rights through centuries of slow  advancement and that they were far ahead of the people of European  states. Consequently, it would be a mistake to give the freedmen a  status equal to that of the most advanced whites. Rather, let the United  States profit by the experience of the British in their emancipation  policies and arrange a system of apprenticeship for a period of  transition. When the Negro should be fit, let him be advanced to  citizenship.    Most Southern leaders agreed that the removal of the master's protection  was a real loss to the Negro which must be made good to some extent by  giving the Negro a status in court and by accepting Negro testimony in  all cases in which blacks were concerned. The North Carolina committee  on laws for freedmen agreed with objectors that \"there are comparatively  few of the slaves lately freed who are honest\" and truthful, but  maintained that the Negroes were capable of improvement. The chief  executives of Mississippi and Florida declared that there was no danger  to the whites in admitting the more or less unreliable Negro testimony,  for the courts and juries would in every case arrive at a proper  valuation of it. Governors Marvin of Florida and Humphreys of  Mississippi advocated practical civil equality, while in North Carolina  and several other States there was a disposition to admit Negro  testimony only in cases in which Negroes were concerned. The North  Carolina committee recommended the abolition of whipping as a punishment  unfit for free people, and most States accepted this principle. Even in  1865, the general disposition was to make uniform laws for both races,  except in regard to violation of contracts, immoral conduct, vagrancy,  marriage, schools, and forms of punishment. In some of these matters the  whites were to be more strictly regulated; in others, the Negroes.    There was further general agreement that in economic relations both  races must be protected, each from the other; but it is plain that the  leaders believed that the Negro had less at stake than the white. The  Negro was disposed to be indolent; he knew little of the obligations  of contracts; he was not honest; and he would leave his job at will.  Consequently Memminger recommended apprenticeship for all Negroes;  Governor Marvin suggested it for children alone; and others wished it  provided for orphans only. Further, the laws enacted must force the  Negroes to settle down, to work, and to hold to contracts. Memminger  showed that, without legislation to enforce contracts and to secure  eviction of those who refused to work, the white planter in the South  was wholly at the mercy of the Negro. The plantations were scattered,  the laborers' houses were already occupied, and there was no labor  market to which a planter could go if the laborers deserted his fields.    What would the Negro become if these leaders of reconstruction were  to have their way? Something better than a serf, something less than a  citizen--a second degree citizen, perhaps, with legal rights about equal  to those of white women and children. Governor Marvin hoped to make of  the race a good agricultural peasantry; his successor was anxious that  the blacks should be preferred to European immigrants; others agreed  with Memminger that after training and education he might be advanced to  full citizenship.    These opinions are representative of those held by the men who,  Memminger excepted, were placed in charge of affairs by President  Johnson and who were not especially in sympathy with the Negroes or  with the planters but rather with the average white. All believed that  emancipation was a mistake, but all agreed that \"it is not the Negro's  fault\" and gave no evidence of a disposition to perpetuate slavery under  another name.    The legislation finally framed showed in its discriminatory features the  combined influence of the old laws for free Negroes, the vagrancy laws  of North and South for whites, the customs of slavery times, the British  West Indies legislation for ex-slaves, and the regulations of the United  States War and Treasury Departments and of the Freedmen's Bureau--all  modified and elaborated by the Southern whites. In only two states,  Mississippi and South Carolina, did the legislation bulk large in  quantity; in other states discriminating laws were few; in still other  states none were passed except those defining race and prohibiting  intermarriage.    In all of the state laws there were certain common characteristics,  among which were the following: the descendant of a Negro was to be  classed as a Negro through the third generation,* even though one parent  in each generation was white; intermarriage of the races was prohibited;  existing slave marriages were declared valid and for the future marriage  was generally made easier for the blacks than for the whites. In all  states the Negro was given his day in court, and in cases relating to  Negroes his testimony was accepted; in six states he might testify  in any case. When provision was made for schooling, the rule of race  separation was enforced. In Mississippi the \"Jim Crow car,\" or separate  car for Negroes, was invented. In several states the Negro had to have  a license to carry weapons, to preach, or to engage in trade. In  Mississippi, a Negro could own land only in town; in other states he  could purchase land only in the country. Why the difference? No one  knows and probably few knew at the time. Some of the legislation was  undoubtedly hasty and ill-considered.         * Fourth in Tennessee.      But the laws relating to apprenticeship, vagrancy, and enforced punitive  employment turned out to be of greater practical importance. On these  subjects the legislation of Mississippi and South Carolina was the most  extreme. In Mississippi orphans were to be bound out, preferably to a  former master, if \"he or she shall be a suitable person.\" The master  was given the usual control over apprentices and was bound by the usual  duties, including that of teaching the apprentice. But the penalties for  \"enticing away\" apprentices were severe. The South Carolina statute was  not essentially different. The vagrancy laws of these two states were in  the main the same for both races, but in Mississippi the definition  of vagrancy was enlarged to include Negroes not at work, those \"found  unlawfully assembling themselves together,\" and \"all white persons  assembling themselves with freedmen.\" It is to be noted that nearly all  punishment for petty offenses took the form of hiring out, preferably  to the former master or employer. The principal petty offenses were, it  would seem, vagrancy and \"enticing away\" laborers or apprentices. The  South Carolina statute contains some other interesting provisions. A  Negro, man or woman, who had enjoyed the companionship of two or more  spouses, must by April 1, 1866, select one of them as a permanent  partner; a farm laborer must \"rise at dawn,\" feed the animals, care for  the property, be quiet and orderly, and \"retire at reasonable hours;\"  on Sunday the servants must take turns in doing the necessary work, and  they must be respectful and civil to the \"master and his family, guests,  and agents;\" to engage in skilled labor the Negro must obtain a license.  Whipping and the pillory were permitted in Florida for certain offenses,  and in South Carolina the master might \"moderately correct\" servants  under eighteen years of age. Other punishments were generally the same  for both races, except the hiring out for petty offenses.    From the Southern point of view none of this legislation was regarded  as a restriction of Negro rights but as a wide extension to the Negro of  rights never before possessed, an adaptation of the white man's laws  to his peculiar case. It is doubtful whether in some of the states  the authorities believed that there were any discriminatory laws; they  probably overlooked some of the free Negro legislation already on the  statute books. In Alabama, for example, General Wager Swayne, the head  of the Freedmen's Bureau, reported that all such laws had either been  dropped by the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2898"],[0,"Pioneers of the Old South: A Chronicle of English Colonial Beginnings (#12)"],[1,"minister, made the solemn opening prayer.  The political divisions of this Virginia were Cities, Plantations,  and Hundreds, the English population numbering now at least a thousand  souls. Boroughs sending burgesses were James City, Charles City, the  City of Henricus, Kecoughtan, Smith's Hundred, Flowerdieu Hundred,  Martin's Hundred, Martin Brandon, Ward's Plantation, Lawne's Plantation,  and Argall's Gift. This first Assembly attended to Indian questions,  agriculture, and religion.    Most notable is this year 1619, a year wrought of gold and iron. John  Rolfe, back in Virginia, though without his Indian princess, who now  lies in English earth, jots down and makes no comment upon what he has  written: \"About the last of August came in a Dutch man of warre that  sold us twenty Negars.\"    No European state of that day, few individuals, disapproved of the  African slave trade. That dark continent made a general hunting-ground.  England, Spain, France, the Netherlands, captured, bought, and sold  slaves. Englishmen in Virginia bought without qualm, as Englishmen  in England bought without qualm. The cargo of the Dutch ship was a  commonplace. The only novelty was that it was the first shipload of  Africans brought to English-America. Here, by the same waters, were the  beginnings of popular government and the young upas-tree of slavery. A  contradiction in terms was set to resolve itself, a riddle for unborn  generations of Americans.    Presently there happened another importation. Virginia, under the new  management, had strongly revived. Ships bringing colonists were coming  in; hamlets were building; fields were being planted; up and down were  to be found churches; a college at Henricus was projected so that Indian  children might be taught and converted from \"heathennesse.\" Yet was the  population almost wholly a doublet--and--breeches--wearing population.  The children for whom the school was building were Indian children.  The men sailing to Virginia dreamed of a few years there and gathered  wealth, and then return to England.    Apparently it was the new Treasurer, Sir Edwyn Sandys, who first grasped  the essential principle of successful colonization: Virginia must be  HOME to those we send! Wife and children made home. Sandys gathered  ninety women, poor maidens and widows, \"young, handsome, and chaste,\"  who were willing to emigrate and in Virginia become wives of settlers.  They sailed; their passage money was paid by the men of their choice;  they married--and home life began in Virginia. In due course of time  appeared fair-haired children, blue or gray of eye, with all England  behind them, yet native-born, Virginians from the cradle.    Colonists in number sailed now from England. Most ranks of society  and most professions were represented. Many brought education, means,  independent position. Other honest men, chiefly young men with little  in the purse, came over under indentures, bound for a specified term of  years to settlers of larger means. These indentured men are numerous;  and when they have worked out their indebtedness they will take up land  of their own.    An old suggestion of Dale's now for the first time bore fruit. Over the  protest of the \"country party\" in the Company, there began to be sent  each year out of the King's gaols a number, though not at any time a  large number, of men under conviction for various crimes. This practice  continued, or at intervals was resumed, for years, but its consequences  were not so dire, perhaps, as we might imagine. The penal laws were  execrably brutal, and in the drag-net of the law might be found many  merely unfortunate, many perhaps finer than the law.    Virginia thus was founded and established. An English people moved  through her forests, crossed in boats her shining waters, trod the  lanes of hamlets builded of wood but after English fashions.  Climate, surrounding nature, differed from old England, and these and  circumstance would work for variation. But the stock was Middlesex,  Surrey, Devon, and all the other shires of England. Scotchmen came also,  Welshmen, and, perhaps as early as this, a few Irish. And there were De  La Warr's handful of Poles and Germans, and several French vinedressers.    Political and economic life was taking form. That huge, luxurious,  thick-leafed, yellow-flowered crop, alike comforting and extravagant,  that tobacco that was in much to mould manners and customs and ways  of looking at things, was beginning to grow abundantly. In 1620, forty  thousand pounds of tobacco went from Virginia to England; two years  later went sixty thousand pounds. The best sold at two shillings the  pound, the inferior for eighteen pence. The Virginians dropped all  thought of sassafras and clapboard. Tobacco only had any flavor of  Golconda.    At this time the rich soil, composed of layer on layer of the decay of  forests that had lived from old time, was incredibly fertile. As fast as  trees could be felled and dragged away, in went the tobacco. Fields must  have laborers, nor did these need to be especially intelligent. Bring in  indentured men to work. Presently dream that ships, English as well as  Dutch, might oftener load in Africa and sell in Virginia, to furnish the  dark fields with dark workers! In Dale's time had begun the making over  of land in fee simple; in Yeardley's time every \"ancient\" colonist--that  is every man who had come to Virginia before 1616--was given a goodly  number of acres subject to a quit-rent. Men of means and influence  obtained great holdings; ownership, rental, sale, and purchase of the  land began in Virginia much as in older times it had begun in England.  Only here, in America, where it seemed that the land could never be  exhausted, individual holdings were often of great acreage. Thus arose  the Virginia Planter.    In Yeardley's time John Berkeley established at Falling Creek the first  iron works ever set up in English-America. There were by this time in  Virginia, glass works, a windmill, iron works. To till the soil remained  the chief industry, but the tobacco culture grew until it overshadowed  the maize and wheat, the pease and beans. There were cattle and swine,  not a few horses, poultry, pigeons, and peacocks.    In 1621 Yeardley, desiring to be relieved, was succeeded by Sir Francis  Wyatt. In October the new Governor came from England in the George, and  with him a goodly company. Among others is found George Sandys, brother  of Sir Edwyn. This gentleman and scholar, beneath Virginia skies  and with Virginia trees and blossoms about him, translated the  \"Metamorphoses\" of Ovid and the First Book of the \"Aeneid\", both of  which were published in London in 1626. He stands as the first purely  literary man of the English New World. But vigorous enough literature,  though the writers thereof regarded it as information only, had, from  the first years, emanated from Virginia. Smith's \"True Relation\",  George Percy's \"Discourse\", Strachey's \"True Repertory of the Wracke  and Redemption of Sir Thomas Gates\", and his \"Historie of Travaile  into Virginia Brittannia\", Hamor's \"True Discourse\", Whitaker's \"Good  News\"--other letters and reports--had already flowered, all with  something of the strength and fragrance of Elizabethan and early  Jacobean work.    For some years there had seemed peace with the Indians. Doubtless  members of the one race may have marauded, and members of the other  showed themselves highhanded, impatient, and unjust, but the majority  on each side appeared to have settled into a kind of amity. Indians came  singly or in parties from their villages to the white men's settlements,  where they traded corn and venison and what not for the magic things  the white man owned. A number had obtained the white man's firearms,  unwisely sold or given. The red seemed reconciled to the white's  presence in the land; the Indian village and the Indian tribal economy  rested beside the English settlement, church, and laws. Doubtless a  fragment of the population of England and a fragment of the English in  Virginia saw in a pearly dream the red man baptized, clothed, become  Christian and English. At the least, it seemed that friendliness and  peace might continue.    In the spring of 1622 a concerted Indian attack and massacre fell like  a bolt from the blue. Up and down the James and upon the Chesapeake,  everywhere on the same day, Indians, bursting from the dark forest that  was so close behind every cluster of log houses, attacked the colonists.  Three hundred and forty-seven English men, women, and children were  slain. But Jamestown and the plantations in its neighborhood were warned  in time. The English rallied, gathered force, turned upon and beat back  to the forest the Indian, who was now and for a long time to come their  open foe.    There followed upon this horror not a day or a month but years of  organized retaliation and systematic harrying. In the end the great  majority of the Indians either fell or were pushed back toward the upper  Pamunkey, the Rappahannock, the Potomac, and westward upon the great  shelf or terrace of the earth that climbed to the fabled mountains. And  with this westward move there passed away that old vision of wholesale  Christianizing.        CHAPTER VIII. ROYAL GOVERNMENT    In November, 1620, there sailed into a quiet harbor on the coast of what  is now Massachusetts a ship named the Mayflower, having on board one  hundred and two English Non-conformists, men and women and with them  a few children. These latest colonists held a patent from the Virginia  Company and have left in writing a statement of their object: \"We...  having undertaken, for the glory of God and advancement of the Christian  faith, and honor of our King and Country, a voyage to plant the first  colony in the northern parts of Virginia--\". The mental reservation is,  of course, \"where perchance we may serve God as we will!\" In England"]]]
