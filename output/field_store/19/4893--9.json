XIV, L) we  can see right down to the bottom of it, where we observe that it bulges  out a little. Extending from either side of the lid to the pyramids are  two folds of mucous membrane, in the hinder part of either of which are  to be observed two little elevations representing the cartilages of  Santorini (pl. XIV, S S), and the upper points of the wedges, called  the cartilages of Wrisberg (pl. XIV, W W). Looking down the kind of tube  which is formed by the parts just enumerated, we next notice two  horizontal projections running from front to back, which are the pocket  ligaments (pl. XIV, P P). Everything we have seen so far is of a pinkish  colour. Below the pocket ligaments, right at the bottom of the tube  described above, we see the main object of our investigation, namely,  the vocal ligaments (pl. XIV, V V). These, being almost of a pearly  white, form a strong contrast to all their surroundings, and it is quite  impossible to mistake them.           *       *       *       *       *    In quiet breathing the vocal chink is of a triangular shape, of which,  however, we can only see the hinder part, the front part being hidden by  the lid (pl. XIII). In exaggerated efforts at breathing this space gets  considerably larger, so that, with a well-directed light, we can see  into the windpipe, of which the rings are plainly noticeable. It is even  possible to see the lowest part of the windpipe, where it is divided  into the two branches entering the lungs.           *       *       *       *       *    For the purpose of studying the movements of the vocal ligaments in the  act of singing, the vowel A, as in \"sad\" will be found the most  favourable, because the formation of the mouth, and the position of the  tongue which it necessitates, enable us to get a complete view of the  interior of the voicebox, which during the emission of other vowel  sounds is more or less hidden.         Mr. Lunn objects that all investigations with the laryngoscope are       valueless on account of the supposed necessity of holding the tip       of the protruding tongue. He says, in a letter to the \"Orchestra\"       (January, 1880): \"One of our most promising singers told me he       could not rightly produce his voice when under laryngoscopic       investigation. It is a moral impossibility for all!\" (A physical       impossibility would be more to the purpose.) \"Let the reader pull       his tongue out with a napkin as far as he can, and sing, and he       will get some notion of the tone producible.\" There is no       foundation for this objection, because if a singer has his tongue       under proper control there is not the slightest occasion to put it       out and to hold it. As to pulling it out as far as one can, that       should not be done under any circumstances, and no man having the       slightest knowledge of laryngoscopy would suggest such a ridiculous       proceeding. In my own case the vocal ligaments can be seen from one       end to the other while I keep my tongue in its natural position,       and I am willing to demonstrate this fact to any one who has any       doubt in the matter.    As soon as we produce a tone, the pyramids, and with them the vocal  ligaments, meet, so as to touch each other more or less closely, while  there still remains a large space between the pocket ligaments above.  Every time we take breath, the pyramids with the vocal ligaments recede,  to meet again as before, every time we strike a new tone. The vocal  ligaments, thrown into vibrations by the stream of air passing between  them, cut, as it were, this stream of air into regular waves, and thus  (as more fully explained on p. 38) tone is produced.    We notice here that this tone-production may be originated in three  different ways:--(1) The vocal ligaments may meet _after_ the air has  commenced to pass between them. Of this an aspirate is the result. (2)  The vocal ligaments may meet _before_ the air has commenced to pass  between them. This causes a check or a click at the beginning of the  tone. (3) The vocal ligaments may meet just at the very moment when the  air passes between them. In this case the tone is properly struck. There  is nothing to make it indefinite as in case No. 1, and nothing to impede  it as in case No. 2. Production as in case No. 3 causes the tone to  travel much farther than production as in cases Nos. I and 2, and it is  this way of striking a tone which is known under the name of \"Coup de  Glotte\" or \"Shock of the Glottis.\"         \"But it is not a shock of the glottis at all,\" says Mr. Lunn, on       page 68 of the book quoted before. \"It is an audible result arising       from the false cords [pocket ligaments] releasing condensed air       imprisoned below them, which air in its release explodes.\" I beg       leave to observe that condensed imprisoned air thus released could       produce a puff, but not a musical tone. The matter is, moreover,       capable of being demonstrated to the eye. The process takes place       as described above, and I am ready at any moment to show that the       pocket ligaments _never_ meet in singing. There can, therefore, be       no possibility of condensed air being imprisoned below them, and we       need not enter into any further argument on the subject.    [Illustration: PLATE XIII.

A very Babel  of confusion exists on this important subject, and we are not only  perplexed by a multiplicity of terms, but also by the various and often  contradictory meanings attached to them. Thus people talk of chest,  medium, mixed, throat, falsetto, and head registers, and these terms  being utterly unscientific--_i.e._, being based upon sensations and  fancies instead of physiological facts--no one can give a clear and  satisfactory definition of any one of them. To bring order into such  chaos is an almost hopeless undertaking, and the first step in this  direction is obviously to ask ourselves, What is the meaning of the word  \"Register?\" My reply is this: _A register consists of a series of tones  which are produced by the same mechanism_. Then comes the question, Can  any such registers be demonstrated in the vocal apparatus; and if so,  what are the mechanisms by which they are produced? The answer supplied  by the laryngoscope is, Yes. There are, broadly speaking, three  registers in the human voice, and the mechanisms are plainly visible, as  follows:--(1) During the lowest series of tones the vocal ligaments  vibrate in their entire thickness (pl. XIV). (2) During the next series  of tones the vocal ligaments vibrate only with their thin inner edges  (pl. XV). (3) During the highest series of tones a portion of the vocal  chink is firmly closed, and only a small part of the vocal ligaments  vibrates (pl. XVI).    In accordance with these physiological facts, Mr. Curwen, in his  admirable book \"The Teacher's Manual,\" calls the registers _the Thick_,  _the Thin_, and _the Small_. These names have a scientific basis, and  their meaning cannot be misunderstood. They are already familiar to  thousands who study music by Mr. Curwen's method, and I have myself made  use of them in my lectures at University College and at other places. I  shall, therefore, also adopt them in this little work, and hope they  will soon find general acceptance among teachers and learners, as  thereby a great many misunderstandings will be avoided.           *       *       *       *       *    Our next business will be to ascertain how these registers are divided  among various voices, and the result as revealed by the laryngoscope is  rather startling. It consists in this, that the break between the Thick  and Thin occurs _in both sexes_ at about [Illustration: musical  notation] In order to realize the full meaning of this, the reader must  bear in mind that music for tenors is generally written an octave higher  than it is sung, so that the tones we are now speaking about would, as a  rule, in a tenor part be expressed by [Illustration: musical notation].  My assertion, therefore, amounts to this, that everything below  [Illustration: musical notation] whether sung by soprano, contralto,  tenor, or bass, is produced by one mechanism--that is to say, by the  vocal ligaments vibrating in their entire thickness; and that the series  of tones above [Illustration: musical notation] whether sung by bass,  tenor, contralto, or soprano, is again produced by one mechanism  (although a different one from the last), that is to say, by the vocal  ligaments vibrating only with their thin inner edges. Then there remains  the small register, which belongs almost exclusively to sopranos, and  which represents the series of tones above [Illustration: musical  notation].    I thus maintain, not only that the great break between the thick and the  thin occurs (individual differences apart) at the same place in both  sexes, but that (leaving for the moment sub-divisions out of  consideration) the male voice has but two registers--_i.e._, the Thick  and the Thin,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3095"],[0,"The Lady of the Shroud (#12)"],[1,"them in all-in-all, and is a leader      recognized.  But if you can win them they are loyal to death.  If you      are ambitious--and I know you are--there may be a field for you in      such a country.  With your qualifications, fortified by the fortune      which I am happy enough to be able to leave you, you may dare much      and go far.  Should I be alive when you return from your exploration      in Northern South America, I may have the happiness of helping you to      this or any other ambition, and I shall deem it a privilege to share      it with you; but time is going on.  I am in my seventy-second year .      . . the years of man are three-score and ten--I suppose you      understand; I do . . . Let me point out this: For ambitious projects      the great nationalities are impossible to a stranger--and in our own      we are limited by loyalty (and common-sense).  It is only in a small      nation that great ambitions can be achieved.  If you share my own      views and wishes, the Blue Mountains is your ground.  I hoped at one      time that I might yet become a Voivode--even a great one.  But age      has dulled my personal ambitions as it has cramped my powers.  I no      longer dream of such honour for myself, though I do look on it as a      possibility for you if you care for it.  Through my Will you will      have a great position and a great estate, and though you may have to      yield up the latter in accordance with my wish, as already expressed      in this letter, the very doing so will give you an even greater hold      than this possession in the hearts of the mountaineers, should they      ever come to know it.  Should it be that at the time you inherit from      me the Voivode Vissarion should not be alive, it may serve or aid you      to know that in such case you would be absolved from any conditions      of mine, though I trust you would in that, as in all other matters,      hold obligation enforced by your own honour as to my wishes.      Therefore the matter stands thus: If Vissarion lives, you will      relinquish the estates.  Should such not be the case, you will act as      you believe that I would wish you to.  In either case the      mountaineers should not know from you in any way of the secret      contracts between Vissarion and myself.  Enlightenment of the many      should (if ever) come from others than yourself.  And unless such      take place, you would leave the estates without any _quid pro quo_      whatever.  This you need not mind, for the fortune you will inherit      will leave you free and able to purchase other estates in the Blue      Mountains or elsewhere that you may select in the world.        If others attack, attack them, and quicker and harder than they can,      if such be a possibility.  Should it ever be that you inherit the      Castle of Vissarion on the Spear of Ivan, remember that I had it      secretly fortified and armed against attack.  There are not only      massive grilles, but doors of chilled bronze where such be needed.      My adherent Rooke, who has faithfully served me for nearly forty      years, and has gone on my behalf on many perilous expeditions, will,      I trust, serve you in the same way.  Treat him well for my sake, if      not for your own.  I have left him provision for a life of ease; but      he would rather take a part in dangerous enterprises.  He is silent      as the grave and as bold as a lion.  He knows every detail of the      fortification and of the secret means of defence.  A word in your      ear--he was once a pirate.  He was then in his extreme youth, and      long since changed his ways in this respect; but from this fact you      can understand his nature.  You will find him useful should occasion      ever arise.  Should you accept the conditions of my letter, you are      to make the Blue Mountains--in part, at least--your home, living      there a part of the year, if only for a week, as in England men of      many estates share the time amongst them.  To this you are not bound,      and no one shall have power to compel you or interfere with you.  I      only express a hope.  But one thing I do more than hope--I desire, if      you will honour my wishes, that, come what may, you are to keep your      British nationality, unless by special arrangement with and consent      of the Privy Council.  Such arrangement to be formally made by my      friend, Edward Bingham Trent, or whomsoever he may appoint by deed or      will to act in the matter, and made in such a way that no act save      that alone of Parliament in all its estates, and endorsed by the      King, may or can prevail against it.        My last word to you is, Be bold and honest, and fear not.  Most      things--even kingship--_somewhere_ may now and again be won by the      sword.  A brave heart and a strong arm may go far.  But whatever is      so won cannot be held merely by the sword.  Justice alone can hold in      the long run.  Where men trust they will follow, and the rank and      file of people want to follow, not to lead.  If it be your fortune to      lead, be bold.  Be wary, if you will; exercise any other faculties      that may aid or guard.  Shrink from nothing.  Avoid nothing that is      honourable in itself.  Take responsibility when such presents itself.      What others shrink from, accept.  That is to be great in what world,      little or big, you move.  Fear nothing, no matter of what kind danger      may be or whence it come.  The only real way to meet danger is to      despise it--except with your brains.  Meet it in the gate, not the      hall.        My kinsman, the name of my race and your own, worthily mingled in      your own person, now rests with you!    _Letter from Rupert Sent Leger_, 32 _Bodmin Street_, _Victoria_, _S.W._,  _to Miss Janet MacKelpie_, _Croom_, _Ross-shire_.                                                            _January_ 3, 1907.        MY DEAREST AUNT JANET,        You will, I know, be rejoiced to hear of the great good-fortune which      has come to me through the Will of Uncle Roger.  Perhaps Sir Colin      will have written to you, as he is one of the executors, and there is      a bequest to you, so I must not spoil his pleasure of telling you of      that part himself.  Unfortunately, I am not free to speak fully of my      own legacy yet, but I want you to know that at worst I am to receive      an amount many times more than I ever dreamt of possessing through      any possible stroke of fortune.  So soon as I can leave      London--where, of course, I must remain until things are settled--I      am coming up to Croom to see you, and I hope I shall by then be able      to let you know so much that you will be able to guess at the      extraordinary change that has come to my circumstances.  It is all      like an impossible dream: there is nothing like it in the \"Arabian      Nights.\"  However, the details must wait, I am pledged to secrecy for      the present.  And you must be pledged too.  You won't mind, dear,      will you?  What I want to do at present is merely to tell you of my      own good-fortune, and that I shall be going presently to live for a      while at Vissarion.  Won't you come with me, Aunt Janet?  We shall      talk more of this when I come to Croom; but I want you to keep the      subject in your mind.                                                                   Your loving                                                                     RUPERT.    _From Rupert Sent Leger's Journal_.                                                            _January_ 4, 1907.        Things have been humming about me so fast that I have had hardly time      to think.  But some of the things have been so important, and have so      changed my entire outlook on life, that it may be well to keep some      personal record of them.  I may some day want to remember some      detail--perhaps the sequence of events, or something like that--and      it may be useful.  It ought to be, if there is any justice in things,      for it will be an awful swot to write it when I have so many things      to think of now.  Aunt Janet, I suppose, will like to keep it locked      up for me, as she does with all my journals and papers.  That is one      good thing about Aunt Janet amongst many: she has no curiosity, or      else she has some other quality which keeps her from prying as other      women would.  It would seem that she has not so much as opened the      cover of one of my journals ever in her life, and that she would not      without my permission.  So this can in time go to her also.        I dined last night with Mr. Trent, by his special desire.  The dinner      was in his own rooms.  Dinner sent in from the hotel.  He would not      have any waiters at all, but made them send in the dinner all at      once, and we helped ourselves.  As we were quite alone, we could talk      freely, and we got over a lot of ground while we were dining.  He      began to tell me about Uncle Roger.  I was glad of that, for, of      course, I wanted to know all I could of him, and the fact was I had      seen very little of him.  Of course, when I was a small kid he was      often in our house, for he was very fond of mother, and she of him.      But I fancy that a small boy was rather a nuisance to him.  And then      I was at school, and he was away in the East.  And then poor mother      died while he was living in the Blue Mountains, and I never saw him      again.  When I wrote to him about Aunt Janet he answered me very      kindly but he was so very just in the matter that I got afraid of      him.  And after that I ran away, and have been roaming ever since; so      there was never a chance of our meeting.  But that letter of his has      opened my eyes.  To think of him following me that way all over the      world, waiting to hold out a helping hand if I should"]]]
