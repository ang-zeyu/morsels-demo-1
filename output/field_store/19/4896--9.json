May Heaven       continue to her such health and such happiness!\"          THE HAPPINESS OF OYSTERS.      The last _Westminster Review_ contains a pleasant scientific article  under the title of \"Shell Fish, their Ways and Works,\" in which the  subject so much debated lately, whether the lower orders of animals are  capable of reason, has some new and amusing illustrations. Generous and  honestly disposed lovers of good dinners will be gratified with the  notion that _oysters_ receive as well as communicate a degree of  happiness. The reviewer treats the subject in the following luminous  manner:         \"And then the oyster itself--the soul and body of the shell--is       there no philosophy in him or her? For now we know that oysters       are really he and she, and that Bishop Sprat, when he gravely       proposed the study of oyster-beds as a pursuit worthy of the       sages who, under the guidance of his co-Bishop, Wilkins, and       Sir Christopher Wren, were laying the foundation stones of the       Royal Society, was not so far wrong when he discriminated       between lady and gentleman oysters. The worthy suggester, it is       true, knew no better than to separate them according to the       color of their beards; as great a fallacy, as if, in these days       of Bloomerism, we should propose to distinguish between males       and females by the fashion of their waistcoats or color of       their pantaloons; or, before this last great innovation of       dress, to, diagnose between a dignitary episcopal and an       ancient dame by the comparative length of their respective       aprons. In that soft and gelatinous body lies a whole world of       vitality and quiet enjoyment. Somebody has styled fossiliferous       rocks 'monuments of the felicity of past ages.' An undisturbed       oyster-bed is a concentration of happiness in the present.       Dormant though the several creatures there congregated seem,       each individual is leading the beatified existence of an       epicurean god. The world without--its cares and joys, its       storms and calms, its passions, evil and good--all are       indifferent to the unheeding oyster. Unobservant even of what       passes in its immediate vicinity, its whole soul is       concentrated in itself; yet not sluggishly and apathetically,       for its body is throbbing with life and enjoyment. The mighty       ocean is subservient to its pleasures. The rolling waves waft       fresh and choice food within its reach, and the flow of the       current feeds it without requiring an effort. Each atom of       water that comes in contact with its delicate gills involves       its imprisoned air to freshen and invigorate the creature's       pellucid blood. Invisible to human eye, unless aided by the       wonderful inventions of human science, countless millions of       vibrating cilia are moving incessantly with synchronic beat on       every fibre of each fringing leaflet. Well might old       Leeuwenhoek exclaim, when he looked through his microscope at       the beard of a shell-fish, 'The motion I saw in the small       component parts of it was so incredibly great, that I could not       be satisfied with the spectacle; and it is not in the mind of       conceive all the motions which I beheld within the compass of a       grain of sand.' And yet the Dutch naturalist, unaided by the       finer instruments of our time, beheld but a dim and misty       indication of the exquisite cilliary apparatus by which these       motions are effected. How strange to reflect that all this       elaborate and inimitable contrivance has been devised for the       well-being of a despised shell-fish? Nor is it merely in the       working members of the creature that we find its wonders       comprised. There are portions of its frame which seem to serve       no essential purpose in its economy: which might be omitted       without disturbing the course of its daily duties, and yet so       constant in their presence and position, that we cannot doubt       their having had their places in the original plan according to       which the organization of the mollusk was first put together.       These are symbols of organs to be developed in creatures higher       in the scale of being; antitypes, it may be, of limbs, and       anticipations of undeveloped senses. These are the first       draughts of parts to be made out in their details elsewhere;       serving, however, an end by their presence, for they are badges       of relationship and affinity between one creature and another.       In them the oyster-eater and the oyster may find some common       bond of sympathy and distant cousinhood.         \"Had the disputatious and needle-witted schoolmen known of       these most curious mysteries of vitality, how vainly subtle       would have been their speculations concerning the solution of       such enigmas?\"          THE RECLAIMING OF THE ANGEL.    WRITTEN FOR THE INTERNATIONAL MONTHLY MAGAZINE.    BY ALICE CAREY.          Oh smiling land of the sunset,        How my heart to thy beauty thrills--      Veiled dimly to-day with the shadow        Of the greenest of all thy hills!      Where daisies lean to the sunshine,        And the winds a plowing go,      And break into shining furrows        The mists in the vale below;      Where the willows hang out their tassels,        With the dews, all white and cold,      Strung over their wands so limber,        Like pearls upon chords of gold;      Where in milky hedges of hawthorn        The red-winged thrushes sing,      And the wild vine, bright and flaunting,        Twines many a scarlet ring;      Where, under the ripened billows        Of the silver-flowing rye,      We ran in and out with the zephyrs--        My sunny-haired brother and I.        Oh, when the green kirtle of May time,        Again o'er the hill-tops is blown,      I shall walk the wild paths of the forest,        And climb the steep headlands alone--      Pausing not where the slopes of the meadows        Are yellow with cowslip beds,      Nor where, by the wall of the garden,        The hollyhocks lift their bright heads.      In hollows that dimple the hill-sides,        Our feet till the sunset had been,      Where pinks with their spikes of red blossoms,        Hedged beds of blue violets in,      While to the warm lip of the sunbeam        The check of the blush rose inclined,      And the pansy's white bosom was flushed with        The murmurous love of the wind.        But when 'neath the heavy tresses        That swept o'er the dying day,      The star of the eve like a lover        Was hiding his blushes away,      As we came to a mournful river        That flowed to a lovely shore,      \"Oh, sister,\" he said, \"I am weary--        I cannot go back any more!\"      And seeing that round about him        The wings of the angels shone--      I parted the locks from his forehead        And kissed him and left him alone.      But a shadow comes over my spirit        Whenever I think of the hours      I trusted his feet to the pathway        That winds through eternity's flowers.          THE ENEMY OF VIRGINIA.    WRITTEN FOR THE INTERNATIONAL MAGAZINE BY ASA SMITH, M. D.      The London _Examiner_, in reviewing Mr. McCulloch's new work on Wages,  etc., seems to be displeased that the author should have expressed  himself against the cultivation and use of tobacco, using the following  language in its defence: \"We quarrel,\" says the _Examiner_, \"with Mr.  McCulloch, for bestowing offensive epithets on tobacco, which he is  pleased to call 'this filthy and offensive stimulant.' Why it should be  more filthy to take a pinch of snuff or a whiff of tobacco smoke, than  to swallow a quart of port wine, is not to us intelligible. Of all the  stimulants that men have had recourse to, tea and coffee excepted,  tobacco is the least pernicious. For the life of you, you cannot get  drunk on it, however well disposed, and no man or woman has ever been  charged with committing a crime under its influence--save only the  factitious crime created by an irrational and excessive duty. For the  best part of three centuries, all the nations of the earth have been  using tobacco--saint, savage, and sage, being among the consumers.\"    The _Examiner_ may quarrel with Mr. McCulloch for abusing the \"weed,\" if  it pleases, but it is a weak argument, if argument it can be called, to  say that because taking a pinch of snuff, or a whiff of tobacco, is no  worse than taking a quart of port wine, therefore the use of tobacco is  good; or because tobacco is the least pernicious of all the stimulants,  therefore it is not objectionable; or because one cannot get drunk on  it, (which, by the way, is a great mistake,) or because for the best  part of three centuries all the nations of the earth have been using  tobacco--saint, savage and sage--therefore it is not a \"filthy and  offensive stimulant.\" The real object of the _Examiner_, however, in  defending the cultivation and use of tobacco, will appear by reading a  little further. \"Of all people,\" says the reviewer, \"we ourselves are  the most moderate consumers; yet the 'filthy and offensive stimulant'  _puts four millions and a half a year into our exchequer_. An old  financier, like Mr. McCulloch, ought, _on this account alone_, to have  treated the weed with more respect.\" Here then is the true reason why  the London _Examiner_ is disposed to quarrel with that author. Nor can  it be a \"filthy and offensive stimulant,\" because, forsooth, it puts  four millions and a half a year into England's exchequer!

For days he and Miss  Charlottie, his wife, raved, begged and pleaded, but Tempie just said  she loved Squire. 'Why will you act so?' Miss Charlottie was crying.  'Haven't we done everything for you and given you everything you  wanted?'    \"Tempie shook her head and said: 'You haven't given me Squire. He's all  I do want.'    \"Then it was that in the dark of the night Mr. James sent Squire away;  he sent him to another state and sold him.    \"But Tempie found it out. She took what money she could find and ran  away. She went to the owner of Squire and bought him, then she set him  free and changed his name to Walden Squire Walden. But then it was  against the law for a white woman to marry a Negro unless they had a  strain of Negro blood, so Tempie cut Squire's finger and drained out  some blood. She mixed this with some whiskey and drank it, then she got  on the stand and swore she had Negro blood in her, so they were  married. She never went back home and her people disowned her.    \"Tempie James Walden, my mother, was a beautiful woman. She was tall  and fair with long light hair. She had fifteen children, seven boys and  eight girls, and all of them lived to be old enough to see their  great-grandchildren. I am the youngest and only one living now. Most of  us came back to North Carolina. Two of my sisters married and came back  to Rich Square to live. They lived not far from the James plantation on  Roanoke River. Once when we were children my sister and I were visiting  in Rich Square. One day we went out to pick huckleberries. A woman came  riding down the road on a horse. She was a tall woman in a long grey  riding habit. She had grey hair and grey eyes. She stopped and looked  at us. 'My,' she said, 'whose pretty little girls are you?'    \"'We're Squire Walden's children,' I said.    \"She looked at me so long and hard that I thought she was going to hit  me with her whip, but she didn't, she hit the horse. He jumped and ran  so fast I thought she was going to fall off, but she went around the  curve and I never saw her again.

He had 'bout a dozen slaves. We  had little cabins to live in, but marster had a big house to live in  that set in a grove. De food I got wus good because I was a pet in de  family.

Dey tole us to call marster an' missus Johnny Rebs, that we wus  free an' had no marsters. Dat wus a day for me. Some of de Yankees wus  ridin', some walkin', an' some runnin'. Dey took de feather beds in  marsters house to de windows, cut dem open an' let de feathers blow  away. It wus a sad time to me 'cause dey destroyed so much of marster's  stuff.    \"After de Yankees left we stayed right on with marster a long time, den  we moved away to other members of de family.
