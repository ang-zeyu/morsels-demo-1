Red Gum= (_Liquidamber styraciflua_) (Sweet Gum, Hazel Pine, Satin  Walnut, Liquidamber, Bilsted). The wood is about as stiff and as  strong as chestnut, rather heavy, it splits easily and is quite brash,  commonly cross-grained, of fine texture, and has a large proportion of  whitish sapwood, which decays rapidly when exposed to the weather; but  the reddish brown heartwood is quite durable, even in the ground. The  external appearance of the wood is of fine grain and smooth, close  texture, but when broken the lines of fracture do not run with  apparent direction of the growth; possibly it is this unevenness of  grain which renders the wood so difficult to dry without twisting and  warping. It has little resiliency; can be easily bent when steamed,  and when properly dried will hold its shape. The annual rings are not  distinctly marked, medullary rays fine and numerous. The green wood  contains much water, and consequently is heavy and difficult to float,  but when dry it is as light as basswood. The great amount of water in  the green wood, particularly in the sap, makes it difficult to season  by ordinary methods without warping and twisting. It does not check  badly, is tasteless and odorless, and when once seasoned, swells and  shrinks but little unless exposed to the weather. Used for boat  finish, veneers, cabinet work, furniture, fixtures, interior  decoration, shingles, paving blocks, woodenware, cooperage, machinery  frames, refrigerators, and trunk slats.                                 Range of Red Gum    Red gum is distributed from Fairfield County, Conn., to southeastern  Missouri, through Arkansas and Oklahoma to the valley of the Trinity  River in Texas, and eastward to the Atlantic coast. Its commercial  range is restricted, however, to the moist lands of the lower Ohio and  Mississippi basins and of the Southeastern coast. It is one of the  commonest timber trees in the hardwood bottoms and drier swamps of the  South. It grows in mixture with ash, cottonwood and oak (see Fig. 12).  It is also found to a considerable extent on the lower ridges and  slopes of the southern Appalachians, but there it does not reach  merchantable value and is of little importance. Considerable  difference is found between the growth in the upper Mississippi  bottoms and that along the rivers on the Atlantic coast and on the  Gulf. In the latter regions the bottoms are lower, and consequently  more subject to floods and to continued overflows (see Fig. 11). The  alluvial deposit is also greater, and the trees grow considerably  faster. Trees of the same diameter show a larger percentage of sapwood  there than in the upper portions of the Mississippi Valley. The  Mississippi Valley hardwood trees are for the most part considerably  older, and reach larger dimensions than the timber along the coast.                                Form of the Red Gum    In the best situations red gum reaches a height of 150 feet, and a  diameter of 5 feet. These dimensions, however are unusual. The stem is  straight and cylindrical, with dark, deeply-furrowed bark, and  branches often winged with corky ridges. In youth, while growing  vigorously under normal conditions, it assumes a long, regular,  conical crown, much resembling the form of a conifer (see Fig. 12).  After the tree has attained its height growth, however, the crown  becomes rounded, spreading and rather ovate in shape. When growing in  the forest the tree prunes itself readily at an early period, and  forms a good length of clear stem, but it branches strongly after  making most of its height growth. The mature tree is usually forked,  and the place where the forking commences determines the number of  logs in the tree or its merchantable length, by preventing cutting to  a small diameter in the top. On large trees the stem is often not less  than eighteen inches in diameter where the branching begins. The  over-mature tree is usually broken and dry topped, with a very  spreading crown, in consequence of new branches being sent out.                               Tolerance of Red Gum    Throughout its entire life red gum is intolerant in shade, there are  practically no red seedlings under the dense forest cover of the  bottom land, and while a good many may come up under the pine forest  on the drier uplands, they seldom develop into large trees. As a rule  seedlings appear only in clearings or in open spots in the forest. It  is seldom that an over-topped tree is found, for the gum dies quickly  if suppressed, and is consequently nearly always a dominant or  intermediate tree. In a hardwood bottom forest the timber trees are  all of nearly the same age over considerable areas, and there is  little young growth to be found in the older stands. The reason for  this is the intolerance of most of the swamp species. A scale of  intolerance containing the important species, and beginning with the  most light-demanding, would run as follows: Cottonwood, sycamore, red  gum, white elm, white ash, and red maple.                          Demands upon Soil and Moisture    While the red gum grows in various situations, it prefers the deep,  rich soil of the hardwood bottoms, and there reaches its best  development (see Fig. 10). It requires considerable soil moisture,  though it does not grow in the wetter swamps, and does not thrive on  dry pine land. Seedlings, however, are often found in large numbers on  the edges of the uplands and even on the sandy pine land, but they  seldom live beyond the pole stage. When they do, they form small,  scrubby trees that are of little value. Where the soil is dry the tree  has a long tap root. In the swamps, where the roots can obtain water  easily, the development of the tap root is poor, and it is only  moderate on the glade bottom lands, where there is considerable  moisture throughout the year, but no standing water in the summer  months.                              Reproduction of Red Gum        [Illustration: Fig. 12. Second Growth Red Gum, Ash,      Cottonwood, and Sycamore.]    Red gum reproduces both by seed and by sprouts (see Fig. 12). It  produces seed fairly abundantly every year, but about once in three  years there is an extremely heavy production. The tree begins to bear  seed when twenty-five to thirty years old, and seeds vigorously up to  an age of one hundred and fifty years, when its productive power  begins to diminish. A great part of the seed, however, is abortive.  Red gum is not fastidious in regard to its germinating bed; it comes  up readily on sod in old fields and meadows, on decomposing humus in  the forest, or on bare clay-loam or loamy sand soil. It requires a  considerable degree of light, however, and prefers a moist seed bed.  The natural distribution of the seed takes place for several hundred  feet from the seed trees, the dissemination depending almost entirely  on the wind. A great part of the seed falls on the hardwood bottom  when the land is flooded, and is either washed away or, if already in  the ground and germinating, is destroyed by the long-continued  overflow. After germinating, the red gum seedling demands, above  everything else, abundant light for its survival and development. It  is for this reason that there is very little growth of red gum, either  in the unculled forest or on culled land, where, as is usually the  case, a dense undergrowth of cane, briers, and rattan is present.  Under the dense underbrush of cane and briers throughout much of the  virgin forest, reproduction of any of the merchantable species is of  course impossible. And even where the land has been logged over, the  forest is seldom open enough to allow reproduction of cottonwood and  red gum. Where, however, seed trees are contiguous to pastures or  cleared land, scattered seedlings are found springing up in the open,  and where openings occur in the forest, there are often large numbers  of red gum seedlings, the reproduction generally occurring in groups.  But over the greater part of the Southern hardwood bottom land forest  reproduction is very poor. The growth of red gum during the early part  of its life, and up to the time it reaches a diameter of eight inches  breast-high, is extremely rapid, and, like most of the intolerant  species, it attains its height growth at an early period. Gum sprouts  readily from the stump, and the sprouts surpass the seedlings in rate  of height growth for the first few years, but they seldom form large  timber trees. Those over fifty years of age seldom sprout. For this  reason sprout reproduction is of little importance in the forest. The  principal requirements of red gum, then, are a moist, fairly rich soil  and good exposure to light. Without these it will not reach its best  development.        [Illustration: Fig. 13. A Cypress Slough in the Dry Season.]                               Second-Growth Red Gum    Second-growth red gum occurs to any considerable extent only on land  which has been thoroughly cleared. Throughout the South there is a  great deal of land which was in cultivation before the Civil War, but  which during the subsequent period of industrial depression was  abandoned and allowed to revert to forest. These old fields now mostly  covered with second-growth forest, of which red gum forms an  important part (see Fig. 12). Frequently over fifty per cent of the  stand consists of this species, but more often, and especially on the  Atlantic coast, the greater part is of cottonwood or ash. These stands  are very dense, and the growth is extremely rapid. Small stands of  young growth are also often found along the edges of cultivated  fields. In the Mississippi Valley the abandoned fields on which young  stands have sprung up are for the most"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26600"],[0,"Mother Earth, Vol. 1 No. 1, March 1906 (#12)"],[1,"udices,  a necessity which has prevented the development of many of those  stupidities which have caused other nations great efforts to overcome.  Repeated persecution has put the stamp of sorrow on the Jews; they have  grown big in their endurance, in their comprehension of human suffering,  and in their sympathy with the struggles and longings of the human soul.    Driven from country to country, they avenged themselves by producing  great thinkers, able theoreticians, heroic leaders of progress. All  governments lament the fact that the Jewish people have contributed the  bravest fighters to the armies for every liberating war of mankind.    Owing to the lack of a country of their own, they developed,  crystallized and idealized their cosmopolitan reasoning faculty. True,  they have not their own empire, but many of them are working for the  great moment when the earth will become the home for all, without  distinction of ancestry or race. That is certainly a greater, nobler and  sounder ideal to strive for than a petty nationality.    It is this ideal that is daily attracting larger numbers of Jews, as  well as Gentiles; and all attempts to hinder the realization thereof,  like the present nationalistic movement, will be swept away by the storm  that precedes the birth of the new era--mankind clasped in universal  brotherhood.    [Illustration]          Mine Owners' Revenge    BY M. B.      +Charles H. Moyer+, President of the Western Federation of Miners, William  D. Haywood, Secretary of that organization, and G. A. Pettibone, former  member of the same, were arrested in Denver, February 17th.    They are accused of having participated in the murder of the ex-Governor  of Idaho, Mr. Steunenberg. Various other arrests have taken place in  Cripple Creek and Haines, Oregon.    The events during and after the arrest leave no doubt that the  authorities of Colorado and Idaho are in the most beautiful accord in  their attempt to kill the Miners' Union. This accord and harmony is so  apparent that thoughtful citizens cannot fail to see that the  governments of Colorado and Idaho are aiding in the conspiracy of the  mine owners against the miners.    Requisition papers and a special train seem to have been prepared in  advance, for immediately after the arrest they were expelled and taken  to Boise City, Idaho, and within a few moments the whole matter was  settled by the authorities of Colorado, not even pretending to show the  slightest fairness. Nor did they display the least desire to investigate  the grounds upon which requisition papers were granted. This process  usually takes several days. In the case of Moyer, Haywood and Pettibone  a few moments sufficed to close the whole proceedings.    Since the papers were issued before the arrest, it is not at all  unlikely that the death sentence has already been decided upon.  Optimists in the labor movement maintain that a repetition of the legal  murder of 1887, that has caused shame and horror even in the ranks of  the upper ten thousand, is impossible--that the authorities would shrink  from such an outrage, such an awful crime. That which has happened in  Colorado and Idaho warrants no such hope.    The evidence against the leaders of the Western Federation of Miners  consists largely of one individual, who is supposed to have known and  witnessed everything. The gentleman seems to fairly long for the moment  when he can take the witness stand and furnish the material that the  District Attorney needs to prove the guilt of the accused. An expert  perjurer, it seems.    The Governor of Idaho, Mr. Gooding, has already given him a good  character. The man acknowledged his firm belief in the existence of a  Supreme Being, which touched the governor's heart deeply. Does he not  know that it has ever been the mission of the Supreme Being to serve as  Impresario to Falsehood and Wretchedness?    The accusation against the three prisoners is the best affidavit of the  miner magnates of the courageous stand of the Western Federation of  Miners during the reign of terror of the money powers. For years  everything was done to disrupt them, but without results. The latest  outrage is a renewed and desperate attack on that labor organization.  Are the working people of America going to look on coolly at a  repetition of the Black Friday in Chicago? Perhaps there will also be a  labor leader, a la Powderly, who will be willing to carry faggots to the  stake? Or are they going to awaken from their lethargy, ere America  becomes thoroughly Russified?          INTERNATIONAL REVIEW      +A painting+ from the \"good old times\" represents two peasants wrangling  about a cow. One holds on to the horns of the animal, the other tightly  clutches its tail, a third figure is in a crouched position underneath.  It is the lawyer milking the cow, while the other two are quarreling.  Here we have the beauty of the representative system. While groups are  bargaining about their rights, their official advisers and lawmakers are  skimming the cream off the milk. Not justice, but social injustice is  the incentive of these worthy gentlemen.    Human justice, and legal representation thereof, are two different  things. One who seeks for a representation places his rights in the  hands of another. He does not struggle for them himself, he must wait  for a decision thereupon from such quarters as are never inspired by  love for justice, but by personal gain and profit.    The working people are beginning to recognize this. It is also beginning  to dawn upon them that they will have to be their own liberators. They  have the power to refuse their material support to a society that  degrades them into a state of slavery. This power was already recognized  in 1789, when, at the French National Convention, Mirabeau thundered:  \"Look out! Do not enrage the common people, who produce everything, who  only need to fold their arms to terrify you!\"    The General Strike is still at the beginning of its activity. It has  gone through the fire in Russia. In Spain and Italy it has helped to  demolish the belief in the sovereignity of Property and the State.    Altogether the General Strike idea, though relatively young, has made a  deeper impression on friend and foe than several million votes of the  working people could have achieved. Indeed, it is no joke for the  pillars of society. What, if the workers, conscious of their economic  power, cease to store up great wealth in the warehouses of the  privileged? It was not difficult to get along with the would-be labor  leaders in the legislative bodies, these worthy ones, experienced  through the practice of manufacturing laws to maintain law and disorder,  rapidly develop into good supporters of the existing conditions.    Now, however, the workingmen have entered upon the battlefield  themselves, refusing their labor, which has always been the foundation  of the golden existence of the haute volee. They demand the possibility  to so organize production and distribution as to make it impossible for  the minority to accumulate outrageous wealth, and to guarantee to each  economic well-being.    The expropriateurs are in danger of expropriation. Capitalism has  expropriated the human race, the General Strike aims to expropriate  capitalism.    A new and invigorating breath of life is also felt in this country,  through the formation of the \"Industrial Workers of the World.\" It  awakens the hope of a transformation of the present trade-union methods.  In their present form they serve the money powers more than the working  class.           *       *       *       *       *    +Robert Koch+, the world-renowned scientist, who was awarded the Nobel  prize in recognition of his work in the direction of exterminating  tuberculosis, delivered a lecture at Stockholm at the time of receiving  the mark of distinction. In the course of his speech he said: \"We may  not conceal the fact, that the struggle against tuberculosis requires  considerable sums of money. It is really only a question of money. The  greater the number of free places for consumptives in well-equipped and  well-conducted hospitals, the better the families of these are  supported, so that the sick are not prevented from going to these  hospitals on account of the care of their relations; and the oftener  such places are established, the more rapidly tuberculosis will cease to  be a common disease.\"    Where are the governments which are supposed to serve as benefactors of  suffering mankind? They have milliards at their disposal, but use most  of it for the maintenance of armies, bureaucracies, police forces. With  these vast sums, which they extort from the people, they increase  instead of diminish suffering.           *       *       *       *       *    +On the 27th of January+ it was 150 years since Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart  was born. A grandmaster of music, a magician who leads the soul from the  depths of life to its sunary heights. Mozart transposed life into music,  Wagner and his pupils transposed problems of life. Wagner questions and  receives no answer. Mozart affirms life. His \"Don Juan\" liberates,  \"Tannhaeuser\" leads into the labyrinth of bothersome renunciation.    The study of Mozart's biography may be recommended to those who believe  that the artistic individuality has freer scope to-day than it would  have with communism. Mozart was always forced to look about for patrons  of his art, for he lacked the means to put his works before the public.    A biographer says of him: \"Mozart's life makes us feel the tragedy of an  artist's life most painfully. In his youth he was fondled and idealized  as a wonder child, but his circumstances deteriorated as he matured in  his art and the more accomplished the works of his fantasy grew. When he  died he left a wife and children behind in great poverty. There was not  enough money on hand to bury him. The corpse was placed in the potters'  "]]]
