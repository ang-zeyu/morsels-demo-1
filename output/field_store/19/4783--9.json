But do not worry  yourself, she still sleeps, and none can arouse her but you, and this  you must do by touching her with the dwarf's beard. Go now, and be  happy.\"    The brave steed disappeared in a whirlwind, and Prince Dobrotek  proceeded on his way. On drawing near the capital he saw it surrounded  by a large foreign army; part of it was already taken, and the  inhabitants seemed to be begging for mercy. The prince put on his  invisible cap, and began to strike right and left with the sharp  smiting sword. With such fury did he attack the enemy that they fell  dead on all sides, like felled trees. When he had thus destroyed the  whole army he went, still invisible, into the palace, where he heard  the king express the utmost astonishment that the enemy had retired  without fighting.    \"Where then is the brave warrior who has saved us?\" said his majesty  aloud.    Every one was silent, when Dobrotek took off his magic cap, and  falling on his knees before the monarch, said: \"It is I, my king and  father, who have routed and destroyed the enemy. It is I who saved the  princess, my bride. While on my way back with her I was treacherously  killed by my rival, who has represented himself to you as her rescuer,  but he has deceived you. Lead me to the princess, that I may awaken  her.\"    On hearing these words the impostor ran away as quickly as possible,  and Dobrotek approached the sleeping maiden. He just touched her brow  with the dwarf's beard, upon which she opened her eyes, smiled, and  seemed to ask where she was.    The king, overcome with joy, kissed her fondly, and the same evening  she was married to the devoted Prince Dobrotek. The king himself led  her to the altar, and to his son-in-law he gave half his kingdom. So  splendid was the wedding banquet, that eye has never seen, nor ear  ever heard of its equal.          THE FLYING CARPET, THE INVISIBLE CAP, THE GOLD-GIVING RING, AND THE  SMITING CLUB          [Illustration]    THE FLYING CARPET, THE INVISIBLE CAP, THE GOLD-GIVING RING, AND THE  SMITING CLUB      In a cottage near the high-road, and close to the shores of a large  lake, there once lived a widow, poor and old. She was very very poor,  but her mother's heart was rich in pride in her son, who was the joy  of her life. He was a handsome lad with an honest soul. He earned his  living by fishing in the lake, and succeeded so well that neither he  nor his mother were ever in want of their daily bread. Every one  called him \"the fisherman.\"    One evening at dusk he went down to the lake to throw in his nets, and  standing on the shore with a new bucket in his hand, waited to put  into it whatever fish it might please God to send him. In about a  quarter of an hour or so he drew in his nets and took out two bream.  These he threw into the bucket, and humming a merry song turned to go  home. At that moment a traveller, poorly clad, with hair and beard  white as the wings of a dove, spoke to him, saying, \"Have pity on a  feeble old man, obliged to lean on his stick, hungry and ragged. I beg  you, in Heaven's name, to give me either money or bread. The sun will  soon set, and I who have eaten nothing to-day shall have to pass the  night fasting, with the bare earth for a bed.\"    \"My good old friend, I am sorry I have nothing about me to give you,  but you see the black smoke curling up in the distance? That is our  cottage, where my old mother is waiting for me to bring her some fish  to cook for our supper. Now take these two bream to her, meanwhile I  will return to the lake and throw in my nets again to see if I can  catch something more. Thus, with God's help, we shall all three have  enough for supper to-night and breakfast to-morrow morning.\"    While speaking the fisherman handed the fish to the old man, when,  marvel of marvels! he melted into the rays of the setting sun and  vanished, both he and the fish.    The fisherman, much astonished, rubbed his eyes and looked about on  all sides. For a moment he felt afraid, but when he had crossed  himself all terror left him and he went to draw in his nets by the  light of the moon. And what do you think he found in them? It was  neither a pike nor a trout, but a small fish with eyes of diamonds,  fins of rainbow colour, and golden scales that shone and flashed like  lightning.    When he had spread his nets on the beach the fish began to talk to him  in the language of men.    \"Do not kill me, young fisherman,\" it said, \"but accept in exchange  for my life this golden ring. Every time you put it on your finger  repeat these words:      'I conjure thee, O ring, who gold can give,    In the name of the little fishling of gold,    For the good of man, that man may live,    And the honour of heaven, send, new or old,    Little or much, as may be my need,    Coins of the realm, let them fall like seed.'    After uttering each of these words, a shower of gold pieces will  fall.\"    The fisherman gladly accepted the ring, and freeing the miraculous  fish from the net he threw it back into the water. As it fell, it  shone in the air like a shooting star and then disappeared beneath the  waves.    On his way back he said to himself, \"My mother and I will go to bed  hungry to-night, without our fried fish, but to-morrow, when I have  made the golden coins gleam in our humble cottage, all sorts of good  things will find their way there, and we shall live like lords.\"    But things turned out very differently, for the first thing he saw on  opening the door was the table covered with a white cloth, and upon it  a china soup-tureen in which lay the two bream freshly cooked.    \"Where did you get those fish from, dear mother?\"    \"I do not know myself,\" replied she, \"for I have neither cleaned them  nor cooked them. Our table spread itself, the fish placed themselves  upon it, and although they have been there an hour they do not get  cold; any one might think they had just been taken off the fire. Come,  let us eat them.\"    The widow and her son sat down, said grace, and after eating as much  as they wanted went to bed.    Next morning, at breakfast time, the fisherman made the sign of the  cross, and then put on the gold ring, at the same time repeating the  words the fish had taught him:      \"I conjure thee, O ring, who gold can give,    In the name of the little fishling of gold,    For the good of man, that man may live,    And the honour of heaven, send, new or old,    Little or much, as may be my need,    Coins of the realm, let them fall like seed.\"    When he had ceased speaking the room was filled with a blast of wind  followed by flashes of lightning, then a hailstorm of gold pieces  showered down and quite covered the table.    The chink of the money aroused his mother, who sat up in bed perfectly  amazed.    \"What is the meaning of this, my son? Am I awake or dreaming? or is it  the work of the Evil One? Where did all that money come from?\"    [Illustration]    \"Fear not, mother, I wear a cross that charms away evil spirits. I  have my work, so that you shall never want, and I have your heart,  where for me there will ever be love to sweeten the disappointments  and troubles of life. This gold that you see will drive poverty far  away, and enable us to help others. Take these pieces, lock them up  safely, and use them when in need. As for me, kiss me, and wish me  good luck on my journey.\"    \"What! Is it possible that you want to leave me already? Why? and  whither are you going?\"    \"I want to go, mother mine, to see the great city. When there, I mean  to enrol myself in the national army. Thus the fisherman turned  soldier will become the defender of his king, for the glory of his  country and his mother.\"    \"Of a truth, my son, I have heard some talk about the king being in  danger, and that our enemies are trying to take his crown from him.  But why should you go? Stay at home rather, for alone and unnoticed  among so many troops you will neither be able to help nor to hinder.\"    \"You are right, one man alone is a small thing, but by adding one  grain to another the measure overflows. If all those who are capable  of bearing arms will help the king, there is no doubt that he will  soon overcome his enemies.\"    \"But a harmless fisherman like you! Of what use can you be in a  battle?\"    \"The fisherman has, doubtless, a peaceable disposition, and he never  boasts of his strength. But when the right moment comes he knows how  to handle a sword, and how to water the land with the enemy's blood.  And the victorious king will, perhaps, reward me for my bravery by  giving me some splendid castle, or a few acres of forest land, a suit  of armour and a horse, or even the hand of his daughter in marriage.\"    \"If you feel like this,\" answered she, \"go, and may God bless you. May  He cover you, dear child, with His grace as with a buckler, so that  neither guns nor sabres shall do you harm. May He take you under His  protection, so that you may return safe and sound to be a comfort to  me; and at the end of my days may I rejoice in your happiness, and  live near you as long as God in His wisdom shall allow.\"    Then she gave him her blessing and kissed him tenderly, making the  sign of the cross in the direction he was about to take.    So he departed, and after a few days' march reached the capital,  thinking within himself how he might help the king most effectually.    The town was surrounded by a countless host who threatened to utterly  destroy it unless the king would agree to pay a very large ransom.    The people crowded into the square, and stood before the palace gates  listening to the herald's proclamation.    \"Hear the king'"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25568"],[0,"Domesticated Animals (#12)"],[1,"fear to their hearts. To such folk the combination appears as  a single terrible being. The ease with which the Spaniards conquered  Mexico and Peru can, to a great extent, be attributed to the awe  carried into the ranks of the savage footmen by their mail-clad  horses. The Greeks, who were wont to represent the forces of nature  and the accomplishments of man by skilfully constructed myths, have  left a record showing their appreciation of the strength derived from  the union of horse and man, in their fable of the Centaur, which  possibly grew up in a time before their people had won the use of the  animal, and when they only knew the creature by chance encounters  with enemies who were mounted upon them. Although the naturalist of  to-day perceives the impossibility of there ever having been on this  earth a form uniting the trunk and fore-limbs of a quadruped to the  upper part of a man's body, such scientific conceptions are a part of  our modern, recently acquired store of knowledge. To the Greeks of  the myth-making age the creature, half man, half horse, added but one  more wonder to the vast store the world already contained. The  currency of this fable shows us very clearly how great was the  impression which the horse made upon primitive peoples.    To perceive the value of the horse in those ancient contests which  opened the paths of civilization, we must note the fact that, until  the invention of gunpowder, success in breaking the ranks of an  enemy depended mainly on the charge. With a large body of vigorous  horsemen it was generally possible to overwhelm an enemy's line of  battle, either by direct assault or by an attack on its flank or  rear. If the reader is curious to see the value of horsemen in  ancient warfare, he should read the story of the campaigns of  Hannibal against the Romans in Italy. The first successes of that  great commander--victories which came near changing the history of  the western world--were almost altogether due to the strength lying  in his admirable Numidian cavalry. The Romans were already good  soldiers, their footmen more trustworthy than those which the  Carthagenian general could set against them; but with his horsemen,  as at Cannae, he could wrap in the Roman line and reduce the most  valiant legions to the confused herd which awaited the butcher.    [Illustration: Cavalry Horse]    Although the invention of firearms has somewhat changed the  conditions under which cavalry may be used, making indeed the direct  charge more costly to the assailant than the assailed, it has in no  wise diminished, but rather increased, the value of horses in  military campaigns. In the line of battle horses have become  necessary for the conveyance of field officers and messengers, and  the right arm of battle, the artillery, could not possibly be managed  except by horse-power. The swift marches of modern armies, by  hastening the issue of contests, have spared the world half the woes  of its great campaigns, and are made possible by the ready movement  of supply trains, which could not be effected except by the help of  these creatures. The result is that a large part of the military  strength of any state rests not only in the valor and training of its  fighting men, but in the supply of horses that its fields may afford.  In this connection it is instructive to compare the military  strength of a country like China, where the horse is not a common  element in the life of the people, with that of any of the western  folk who may hereafter have to wrestle with that populous empire.  Some writers, in their efforts to forecast the large politics of the  future, have imagined that when the hardy and obedient Chinaman came  to receive the European training in the military art, the armies of  that country might prove from their numbers a menace to our own  civilization. Such an issue seems in a high degree improbable, for  the reason that the eastern realm could not provide the horses which  would be necessary for the use of invading armies; nor is it at all  likely that the rigid framework of their society will ever be so  altered as to provide an abundance of these animals.    [Illustration: Plough Horses, France]    Although in the first instance the horse served mainly, if not  altogether, as an ally of man in his contests with his neighbors, its  most substantial use has been in the peaceful arts. As pack animal and  drawer of the plough, the ox appears in general to have come into use  before its swifter companion. The displacement of horned cattle has  been due to the fact that their structure and habits make them much  less fit for arduous and long-continued labor than the horse has been  found to be. The cloven foot, because of its division, is weak. It  cannot sustain a heavy burden. Even with the unincumbered weight of  the body of the animal, the feet are apt to become sore in marches  which the heavily mounted horse endures unharmed. Centuries of  experience have shown that while the ox is an excellent animal for  drawing a plough in a stubborn soil, and is well adapted to pulling  carriages where the burden is heavy and the speed is not a matter of  importance and the distance not great, the creature is too slow for  the greater part of the work which the farmer needs to do. The pace  which they can be made to take in walking is not more than half as  great as that of a quick-footed horse moving in the same gait; and the  ox is practically incapable, because of its weak feet, of keeping up a  trot on any ordinary road. But for the fact that an aged ox may be  used for beef, they would doubtless long since have ceased to serve us  as draught animals. As it is, with the growing money value of the  laborer's time, this slow-moving creature is steadily and rather  rapidly disappearing from our farms. This change, indeed, is one of  the most indicative of all those now occurring in our agriculture. It  is an excellent example of the operations which the increase in the  workman's pay is bringing into our civilization.    The natural advantages of the horse for the use of man consisted in  its size, strength, and endurance to burden; form of the body, which  enabled a skilful rider to maintain his position astride the trunk; and  the peculiar shape of the mouth and disposition of the teeth which made  it possible to use the bit. With these direct physical advantages there  were others of a physiological and psychic sort, of equal value. The  creature breeds as well under domestication as in the wilderness; the  young are fit for some service in the third year of their life, and  are, at least in the less elaborated breeds, in a mature condition when  they are five years old. Experience shows that the animal can subsist  on a great variety of diet, being in this regard surpassed only by its  humbler kinsman the donkey, and by the goats. There are few fields so  lean that they will not maintain serviceable horses. They do well alike  in mountain pastures and amid the herbage of the moistest plainland.    The mental peculiarities of the horse are much less characteristic than  its physical. It is indeed the common opinion, among those who do not  know the animal well, that it is endowed with much sagacity, but no  experienced and careful observer is likely to maintain this opinion.  All such students find the intelligence of the horse to be very  limited. It requires but little observation to show that the creature  observes quickly, and in some way classifies the objects with which it  comes in contact. The fear aroused in it by unknown things makes this  feature of attention to the surrounding world very evident. Almost all  these animals retain a tolerably distinct memory of the roads which  they have traversed, even if they have passed over them but a few  times. The studies which I have made on this point show me that the  average horse will be able to return on a road which it has traversed  a few hours before, with less risk of blundering than an ordinary  driver. Some well-endowed animals can remember as many as a dozen  turnings in a path over which they have journeyed three or four times.  It seems almost certain that their guidance in these movements is not  at all effected by the sense of smell, but is due to a distinct memory  of the detailed features of the country.    [Illustration: Belgian Fisherman's Horse]    Good as is the horse's memory, it is difficult to organize its actions  on that basis. Only in rare cases and with much labor can he be taught  to execute movements that are at all complicated. Fire-engine horses  may be trained of their own will to step into the position where they  are to be attached to the carriage. Some artillery horses will, as I  have noticed, associate the sound of the bugle with the resulting  movements of the guns and take the appropriate positions, where they  may be out of danger in the rapid swinging of the teams and  carriages. It is partly because of this training received by  disciplined artillery horses, that it seems to many experienced  officers not worth while to have militia companies in this arm, who  have to manoeuvre with animals untrained for the service. Although  some part of this mental defect in the horse, causing its actions to  be widely contrasted with those of the dog, may be due to a lack of  deliberate training and to breeding with reference to intellectual  accomplishment, we see by comparing the creature with the elephant,  which practically has never been bred in captivity, that the equine  mind is, from the point of view of rationality, very feeble.    The emotional side of the horse's nature seems little more developed  than its rational. Although they have a certain affection for the hand  which feeds them, and in a mild way are disposed to form friendships  with other animals, they are not really affectionate, and never, so  far as I have been able to find, show any distinct signs of"]]]
