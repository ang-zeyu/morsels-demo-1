Martial d'Auvergne (_c_. 1433-1508), chronicling events in his  _Vigiles de Charles VII._, a poem written according to the scheme of  the liturgical Vigils, is eloquent in his expression of the wrongs of  the poor, and in his condemnation of the abuses of power and station.  If the _Amant rendu Cordelier_ be his, he too appears among those who  jest at the follies and extravagance of love. His prose _Arrets  d'Amour_ are discussions and decisions of the imaginary court which  determines questions of gallantry.    Amid such mockery of life and love, the horror of death was ever  present to the mind of a generation from which hope and faith seemed  to fail; it was the time of the _Danse Macabre_; the skeleton became  a grim humourist satirising human existence, and verses written for  the dance of women were ascribed in the manuscript which preserves  them to Martial d'Auvergne.    Passion and the idea of death mingle with a power at once realistic  and romantic in the poetry of FRANCOIS VILLON. He was born in poverty,  an obscure child of the capital, in 1430 or 1431; he adopted the name  of his early protector, Villon; obtained as a poor scholar his  bachelor's degree in 1449, and three years later became a _maitre  es arts_; but already he was a master of arts less creditable than  those of the University. In 1455 Villon--or should we call him  Monterbier, Montcorbier, Corbueil, Desloges, Mouton (aliases  convenient for vagabondage)?--quarrelled with a priest, and killed  his adversary; he was condemned to death, and cheered his spirits  with the piteous ballade for those about to swing to the kites and  the crows; but the capital punishment was commuted to banishment.  Next winter, stung by the infidelity and insults of a woman to whom  he had abandoned himself, he fled, perhaps to Angers, bidding his  friends a jesting farewell in the bequests of his _Petit Testament_.  Betrayed by one who claimed him as an associate in robbery, Villon  is lost to view for three years; and when we rediscover him in 1461,  it is as a prisoner, whose six months' fare has been bread and water  in his cell at Meun-sur-Loire. The entry of Louis XI., recently  consecrated king, freed the unhappy captive. Before the year closed  he had composed his capital work, the _Grand Testament_, and proved  himself the most original poet of his century. And then Villon  disappears; whether he died soon after, whether he lived for half  a score of years, we do not know.    While he handles with masterly ease certain of the fifteenth-century  forms of verse--in particular the ballade--Villon is a modern in his  abandonment of the traditional machinery of the imagination, its  convention of allegories and abstractions, and those half-realised  moralisings which were repeated from writer to writer; he is modern  in the intensity of a personal quality which is impressed upon his  work, in the complexity of his feelings, passing from mirth to despair,  from beauty to horror, from cynical grossness to gracious memories  or aspirations; he is modern in his passion for the real, and in those  gleams of ideal light which are suddenly dashed across the vulgar  surroundings of his sorry existence. While he flings out his scorn  and indignation against those whom he regarded as his ill-users, or  cries against the injuries of fortune, or laments his miserable past,  he yet is a passionate lover of life; and shadowing beauty and youth  and love and life, he is constantly aware of the imminent and  inexorable tyranny of death. The ideas which he expresses are few  and simple--ideas common to all men; but they take a special colour  from his own feelings and experiences, and he renders them with a  poignancy which is his own, with a melancholy gaiety and a desperate  imaginative sincerity. His figure is so interesting in itself--that  of the _enfant perdu_ of genius--and so typical of a class, that the  temptation to create a Villon legend is great; but to magnify his  proportions to those of the highest poets is to do him wrong. His  passionate intensity within a limited range is unsurpassed; but  Villon wanted sanity, and he wanted breadth.    In his direct inspiration from life, co-operating with an admirable  skill and science in literary form, Villon stands alone. For  others--Georges Chastelain, Meschinot, Molinet, Cretin--poetry was  a cumbrous form of rhetoric, regulated by the rules of those arts  of poetry which during the fifteenth century appeared at not  infrequent intervals. The _grands rhetoriqueurs_ with their  complicated measures, their pedantic diction, their effete allegory,  their points and puerilities, testify to the exhaustion of the Middle  Ages, and to the need of new creative forces for the birth of a living  literature.    There is life, however, in the work of one remarkable prose-writer  of the time--ANTOINE DE LA SALLE. His residence in Rome (1422) had  made him acquainted with the tales of the Italian _novellieri_; he  was a friend of the learned and witty Poggio; Rene of Anjou entrusted  to him the education of his son; when advanced in years he became  the author certainly of one masterpiece, probably of three. If he  was the writer of the _Quinze Joies de Mariage_, he knew how to mask  a rare power of cynical observation under a smiling face: the Church  had celebrated the fifteen joys of the Blessed Virgin; he would  ironically depict the fifteen afflictions of wedded life, in scenes  finely studied from the domestic interior. How far the _Cent Nouvelles  nouvelles_ are to be ascribed to him is doubtful; it is certain that  these licentious tales reproduce, with a new skill in narrative prose,  the spirit of indecorous mirth in their Italian models. The _Petit  Jehan de Saintre_ is certainly the work of Antoine de la Salle; the  irony of a realist, endowed with subtlety and grace, conducts the  reader through chivalric exaltations to vulgar disillusion. The  writer was not insensible to the charm of the ideals of the past,  but he presents them only in the end to cover them with disgrace.  The anonymous farce of _Pathelin_, and the _Chronique de petit Jehan  de Saintre_, are perhaps the most instructive documents which we  possess with respect to the moral temper of the close of the Middle  Ages; and there have been critics who have ventured to ascribe both  works to the same hand.      II  THE DRAMA    The mediaeval drama in France, though of early origin, attained its  full development only when the Middle Ages were approaching their  term; its popularity continued during the first half of the sixteenth  century. It waited for a public; with the growth of industry, the  uprising of the middle classes, it secured its audience, and in some  measure filled the blank created by the disappearance of the _chansons  de geste_. The survivals of the drama of the twelfth and thirteenth  centuries are few; the stream, as we know, was flowing, but it ran  underground.    The religious drama had its origin in the liturgical offices of the  Church. At Christmas and at Easter the birth and resurrection of the  Saviour were dramatically recited to the people by the clergy, within  the consecrated building, in Latin paraphrases of the sacred text;  but, as yet, neither Jesus nor His mother appeared as actors in the  drama. By degrees the vernacular encroached upon the Latin and  displaced it; the scene passed from the church to the public place  or street; the action developed; and the actors were priests supported  by lay-folk, or were lay-folk alone.    The oldest surviving drama written in French (but with interspersed  liturgical sentences of Latin) is of the twelfth century--the  _Representation d'Adam_: the fall of man, and the first great crime  which followed--the death of Abel--are succeeded by the procession  of Messianic prophets. It was enacted outside the church, and the  spectators were alarmed or diverted by demons who darted to and fro  amidst the crowd. Of the thirteenth century, only two religious pieces  remain. Jean Bodel, of Arras, was the author of _Saint Nicholas_.  The poet, himself about to assume the cross, exhibits a handful of  Crusaders in combat with the Mussulmans; all but one, a supplicant  of the saint, die gloriously, with angelic applause and pity;  whereupon the feelings of the audience are relieved by the mirth and  quarrels of drinkers in a tavern, who would rob St. Nicholas of the  treasure entrusted to his safeguard; miracles, and general  conversion of the infidels, conclude the drama. The miracle of  _Theophile_, the ambitious priest who pawned his soul to Satan, and  through our Lady's intercession recovered his written compact, is  by the trouvere Rutebeuf. These are scanty relics of a hundred years;  yet their literary value outweighs that of the forty-two _Miracles  de Notre Dame_ of the century which followed--rude pieces, often  trivial, often absurd in their incidents, with mystic extravagance  sanctifying their vulgar realism. They formed, with two exceptions,  the dramatic repertory of some mediaeval _puy_, an association  half-literary, half-religious, devoted to the Virgin's honour; their  rhymed octosyllabic verse--the special dramatic form--at times  borders upon prose. One drama, and only one, of the fourteenth century,  chooses another heroine than our Lady--the _Histoire de Griselidis_,  which presents, with pathos and intermingling mirth, those marvels  of wifely patience celebrated for other lands by Boccaccio, by  Petrarch, and by Chaucer.    The fifteenth-century Mystery exhibits the culmination of the  mediaeval sacred drama. The word _mystere_,[2] first appropriated  to tableaux vivants, is applied to dramatic performances in the royal  privilege which in 1402 conferred upon the association known as the  _Confrerie de la Passion_ the right of performing the plays of our  Redemption.

CHAPTER V.    HYGIENE.          HYGIENE.      It is proposed in this chapter to outline, very briefly, a few simple  rules of hygiene, the observance of which will tend to bring the young  man into the highest possible state of physical development. Assuming  that he wishes to lead a continent life, the observance of these rules  will make that much desired condition more easily attainable.      1. DIET.    a. =Choice of Food.=--The young man who is boarding at a restaurant or  in a boarding club can modify his diet only within the range of the  menu provided. Fortunately, the young man can observe the most  important rule of diet, i.e., _to eat abstemiously_. Wherever one is  boarding he can eat temperately; he can avoid highly spiced foods, tea  and coffee. The observance of these simple rules will go a long way  towards simplifying his sexual problem. It has been discovered by the  study of the influence of diet upon sexual appetite, that the heavy  eating of rich and highly spiced foods, indulgence in stimulants and  narcotics, all tend to excite the sexual desires.    The author presents a menu that would be looked upon as a temperate  one for a student:    Breakfast.    Fruit  Well cooked cereal breakfast food with cream or a slice of bacon, an  egg, with bread and butter  Glass of milk, cocoa or cereal coffee    Dinner.    Soup  Meat, potatoes and gravy  One vegetable  Dessert:  (Custards, tapioca pudding, rice pudding, gelatin pudding or bread  pudding)  Water    Supper.    Creamed potatoes  Salmon or sardines  Bread and butter  Canned or stewed fruit  Cocoa or milk    If lunch is served at noon and dinner at night, the supper and dinner  as given above would correspond with lunch and dinner when dinner is  served at night.    If the young man is training heavily for foot ball or other heavy  athletics in which a training table is provided, he may eat a much  heavier diet than the one above outlined, having either eggs or meat  three times a day instead of once or twice and larger portions of each  food. However, even the man in athletic training needs less food than  is customary for men in training to take. If the foot ball teams would  eat somewhat less than they do and a smaller proportion of meat, they  would be much less likely to \"train stale.\"    b. =Stimulants and Narcotics.=--It will be noted that no provision is  made for coffee or tea in the above menu. The general conditions of  life in a student community serve as a sufficient stimulation. Tea and  coffee are stimulants, and on general principles, it is not wise to  use stimulants unless one needs them. The college student does not  need any other stimulant than is afforded by the conditions in a  college community.    It may be fairly said that stimulants never benefit anybody who does  not need them. On the other hand, they may easily injure a person who  does not need them. Coffee for example, or tea, not only does not  assist digestion but actually retards it. All stimulants produce a  quickening of brain activity which is uniformly followed by a reaction  in which the brain activity is either slowed or confused. The coffee  drinker is almost certain to experience within an hour after a cup of  strong coffee an exhilaration, with heightened brain activity. If one  could experience this stimulation without any reaction, it might be  advisable, especially for those who need just such stimulation at  just such a time. However, when one considers that he cannot  experience stimulation without experiencing a compensatory depression,  he will see that it certainly does not pay to get the one at the  expense of the other, except under unusual conditions.    Now the question may naturally arise: What occasion would justify the  drinking of a strong cup of coffee? Suppose that one were due in an  examination and that he had only one examination in a day; suppose it  came at 8 o'clock. Let the student retire early the night before, rise  early, take a walk before breakfast and eat a very light breakfast. He  may take a cup of strong unsweetened black coffee with the breakfast.  He will find that this coffee proves a strong stimulant, particularly  if he has not been using it regularly, and that it produces the  stimulation just when he wants it. He will find that he is better able  to marshal his thoughts and to recall the various facts that he may  need to use in formulating his answers to the examination questions.  Under such conditions the author believes that it is justifiable for a  student to use coffee. But we must not forget that the coffee is a  drug; used for its drug action; used to produce a physiological effect  at a definite time. Having produced that effect, one may expect the  depression to follow after the examination.    Now the natural tendency, and a tendency which causes many people to  pass step by step into an excessive use of this stimulation, is to  relieve the depression which follows the first cup of coffee by taking  another cup and so on, taking coffee at each meal and perhaps  occasionally between meals. While some people of phlegmatic  temperament can stand such a drug habit for years without being very  seriously injured, it is certainly a habit to be strongly discouraged.  A person who does not use coffee or tea regularly, but wishes on rare  occasions to get a stimulation, can resort to it to produce that  effect, but after having gotten the effect let him get over the  depression as best he can, and not relieve it by taking a second cup.    If he has a week of examinations, it might be permissible to follow  such a regime as suggested above throughout the week. On the whole,  however, the use of these stimulants is to be discouraged.    =Narcotics= are those drugs which cause narcosis or a dulling of the  senses and a decreased activity of both the muscular and nervous  system.    One of the most common and typical narcotics is opium. Derived from  opium is morphine. Cocaine belongs also to the narcotics as do the  anaesthetics, such as chloroform, ether and common alcohol.    It is hardly necessary to say anything about the use of alcohol to  intelligent college men. Very seldom do college and university  students resort to alcoholic drinks, either for their drug effect or  in a spirit of conviviality.    The intelligent people of the country realize the dangers that follow  the use of alcoholic beverages. It is very rare that educated people  use any alcohol and when used it is only in most moderate quantities,  and usually, on special occasions.    It is only comparatively recently that the absolute truth of the Bible  dictum that, \"Wine is a mocker\" has been realized.    Brandy and whiskey were taken for generations to make one warm on a  cold day because it gave one temporarily a flush of warm blood to the  skin, only to cool down the temperature of the body later, so that  instead of raising the temperature of the body, alcohol actually  lowers the temperature of the body.    Many people took alcohol when excessively hot to cool the body, but if  the temperature of the outside air is higher than the temperature of  the body, as is the case on excessively hot days in summer, the rush  of blood to the surface would only have the effect desired in the  first few minutes of the action of the alcohol. The skin would tend to  become dry, the temperature of the blood to rise, subject to the  influence of the hot air. This heated blood striking the vital organs  accounts for the fact that on those excessively hot days, when there  are many sunstrokes, most of them are among men who not only  habitually take alcohol, but who are under the influence of alcohol at  the time.    Many people have taken alcohol to improve digestion, but scientific  observations on digestion under the influence of alcohol have shown  that the digestion is actually retarded.    Many people have taken alcohol to make their muscles strong, and one  does actually imagine that he is stronger after a moderate dose of  alcohol, but many careful experiments on the part of numerous  observers have shown that the muscles are really less strong and can  do progressively less work the larger the dose of alcohol.    Many thought that alcohol would stimulate the action of the brain and  have taken it for that purpose; but experiments have shown that while  there is temporarily a greater activity of the brain, this activity is  less under control of the higher brain centers. The after dinner  champagne may loosen the tongue of the post-prandial speaker but he  may say many things which the judgment would not commend.    So, in all those applications that men have made of alcohol through  the ages, we find on careful examination, that in every case the  alcohol actually has an effect opposite to that which has been  attributed to it. How true then are the words of the Bible: \"Wine is  a mocker.\"    If an alcoholic beverage actually helped the muscles, the brain or the  glands, one would find it seriously commended by athletic trainers and  coaches for preparation in athletic contests; one would find it  commended by the trainers of prize fighters to help them in their  preparation and in the final encounter; one would find it recommended  by mountain climbers and by Arctic explorers, to stimulate the muscles  for the exhausting ordeal of mountain climbing or to protect the  system from the penetrating cold of the northern latitudes; alcoholic  beverages are, however, not only not advised by these men for these  purposes, but on the other hand, all participants in these activities  are positively forbidden to use any alcoholic beverages, even in the  smallest quantities.    So the young man who would develop a clear thinking brain and a sound  body must leave alcoholic beverages alone. Further, the young man who  would have absolute control of his"]]]
