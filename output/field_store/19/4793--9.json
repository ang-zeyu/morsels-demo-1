[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26059"],[0,"The Ascent of Denali (Mount McKinley) (#12)"],[1,"United States, the top of the Browne Tower probably on a  level with the top of Mount Blanc, it is yet not so high as to induce  the acute breathlessness from which the writer suffered, later, upon any  exertion. The climbing of the tower, the traversing to the other side of  it, the climbing of the ridge, would afford pleasant excursions, while  the opportunity for careful though difficult photography would be  unrivalled. Even in thick weather the clouds are mostly below; and their  rapid movement, the kaleidoscopic changes which their coming and going,  their thickening and thinning, their rising and falling produce, are a  never-failing source of interest and pleasure. The changes of light and  shade, the gradations of color, were sometimes wonderfully delicate and  charming. Seen through rapidly attenuating mist, the bold crags of the  icy ridge between the glacier arms in the foreground would give a soft  French gray that became a luminous mauve before it sprang into dazzling  black and white in the sunshine. In the sunshine, indeed, the whole  landscape was hard and brilliant, and lacked half-tones, as in the main  it lacked color; but when the vapor drew the gauze of its veil over it  there came rich, soft, elusive tints that were no more than hinted ere  they were gone.    [Illustration: Above all the range except Denali and Denali's Wife.]    [Sidenote: The Himalayas]    Here, with nothing but rock and ice and snow around, nine thousand feet  above any sort of vegetation even in the summer, it was of interest to  remember that at the same altitude in the Himalayas good crops of barley  and millet are raised and apples are grown, while at a thousand feet or  so lower the apricot is ripened on the terrace-gardens.    Karstens and Walter had brought up a load each on their reconnoissance  trip; four heavy loads had been brought the day before. There were yet  two loads to be carried up from the cache below the cleavage, and Tatum  and Walter, always ready to take the brunt of it, volunteered to bring  them. So down that dreadful ridge once more the boys went, while  Karstens and the writer prospected ahead for a route into the Grand  Basin.    The storms and snows of ten or a dozen winters may make a \"steep but  practicable snow slope\" of the Northeast Ridge again. One winter only  had passed since the convulsion that disrupted it, and already the snow  was beginning to build up its gaps and chasms. All the summer through,  for many hours on clear days, the sun will melt those snows and the  frost at night will glaze them into ice. The more conformable ice-blocks  will gradually be cemented together, while the fierce winds that beat  upon the ridge will wear away the supports of the more egregious and  unstable blocks, and one by one they will topple into the abyss on this  side or on that. It will probably never again be the smooth, homogeneous  slope it has been; \"the gable\" will probably always present a wide  cleft, but the slopes beyond it, stripped now of their accumulated ice  so as to be unclimbable, may build up again and give access to the  ridge.    The point about one thousand five hundred feet above the gable, where  the earthquake cleavage took place, will perhaps remain the crux of the  climb. The ice-wall rises forty or fifty feet sheer, and the broken  masses below it are especially difficult and precipitous, but with care  and time and pains it can be surmounted even as we surmounted it. And  wind and sun and storm may mollify the forbidding abruptness of even  this break in the course of time.    [Sidenote: The Denali Problem]    With the exception of this ridge, Denali is not a mountain that presents  special mountaineering difficulties of a technical kind. Its  difficulties lie in its remoteness, its size, the great distances of  snow and ice its climbing must include the passage of, the burdens that  must be carried over those distances. We estimated that it was twenty  miles of actual linear distance from the pass by which we reached the  Muldrow Glacier to the summit. In the height of summer its snow-line  will not be higher than seven thousand feet, while at the best season  for climbing it, the spring, the snow-line is much lower. Its climbing  is, like nearly all Alaskan problems, essentially one of transportation.  But the Northeast Ridge, in its present condition, adds all the spice of  sensation and danger that any man could desire.    FOOTNOTE:    [3] See illustration facing p. 40.          CHAPTER IV    THE GRAND BASIN      The reader will perhaps be able to sympathize with the feeling of  elation and confidence which came to us when we had surmounted the  difficulties of the ridge and had arrived at the entrance to the Grand  Basin. We realized that the greater and more arduous part of our task  was done and that the way now lay open before us. For so long a time  this point had been the actual goal of our efforts, for so long a time  we had gazed upward at it with hope deferred, that its final attainment  was accompanied with no small sense of triumph and gratification and  with a great accession of faith that we should reach the top of the  mountain.    [Sidenote: Heat and Cold]    The ice of the glacier that fills the basin was hundreds of feet beneath  us at the pass, but it rises so rapidly that by a short traverse under  the cliffs of the ridge we were able to reach its surface and select a  camping site thereon at about sixteen thousand feet. It was bitterly  cold, with a keen wind that descended in gusts from the heights, and the  slow movement of step-cutting gave the man in the rear no opportunity of  warming up. Toes and fingers grew numb despite multiple socks within  mammoth moccasins and thick gloves within fur mittens.    From this time, during our stay in the Grand Basin and until we had left  it and descended again, the weather progressively cleared and brightened  until all clouds were dispersed. From time to time there were fresh  descents of vapor, and even short snow-storms, but there was no general  enveloping of the mountain again. Cold it was, at times even in the  sunshine, with \"a nipping and an eager air,\" but when the wind ceased it  would grow intensely hot. On the 4th June, at 3 P. M., the thermometer  in the full sunshine rose to 50 deg. F.--the highest temperature recorded  on the whole excursion--and the fatigue of packing in that thin atmosphere  with the sun's rays reflected from ice and snow everywhere was most  exhausting. We were burned as brown as Indians; lips and noses split and  peeled in spite of continual applications of lanoline, but, thanks to  those most beneficent amber snow-glasses, no one of the party had the  slightest trouble with his eyes. At night it was always cold, 10 deg.  below zero being the highest minimum during our stay in the Grand Basin,  and 21 deg. below zero the lowest. But we always slept warm; with  sheep-skins and caribou-skins under us, and down quilts and camel's-hair  blankets and a wolf-robe for bedding, the four of us lay in that  six-by-seven tent, in one bed, snug and comfortable. It was disgraceful  overcrowding, but it was warm. The fierce little primus stove, pumped up  to its limit and perfectly consuming its kerosene fuel, shot out its  corona of beautiful blue flame and warmed the tight, tiny tent. The  primus stove, burning seven hours on a quart of coal-oil, is a little  giant for heat generation. If we had had two, so that one could have  served for cooking and one for heating, we should not have suffered from  the cold at all, but as it was, whenever the stew-pot went on the stove,  or a pot full of ice to melt, the heat was immediately absorbed by the  vessel and not distributed through the tent. But another primus stove  would have been another five or six pounds to pack, and we were \"heavy\"  all the time as it was.    [Illustration: Traverse under the cliffs of the Northeast Ridge to enter  the Grand Basin.]    [Sidenote: The Labor of Packing]    Something has already been said about the fatigue of packing, and one  would not weary the reader with continual reference thereto; yet it is  certain that those who have carried a pack only on the lower levels  cannot conceive how enormously greater the labor is at these heights. As  one rises and the density of the air is diminished, so, it would seem,  the weight of the pack or the effect of the weight of the pack is in the  same ratio increased. We probably moved from three hundred to two  hundred and fifty pounds, decreasing somewhat as food and fuel were  consumed, each time camp was advanced in the Grand Basin. We could have  done with a good deal less as it fell out, but this we did not know, and  we were resolved not to be defeated in our purpose by lack of supplies.  But the packing of these loads, relaying them forward, and all the time  steeply rising, was labor of the most exhausting and fatiguing kind, and  there is no possible way in which it may be avoided in the ascent of  this mountain. To roam over glaciers and scramble up peaks free and  untrammelled is mountaineering in the Alps. Put a forty-pound pack on a  man's back, with the knowledge that to-morrow he must go down for  another, and you have mountaineering in Alaska. In the ascent of this  twenty-thousand-foot mountain every member of the party climbed at least  sixty thousand feet. It is this going down and doing it all over again  that is the heart-breaking part of climbing.    [Illustration: First camp in the Grand Basin--16,000 feet, looking up.]    It was in the Grand Basin that the writer began to be seriously affected  by the altitude, to be disturbed by a shortness of breath that with each  advance grew more distressingly acute. While at rest he was not  troubled; mere existence imposed no unusual burden, but even a slight  exertion would be followed by a spell of panting, and climbing with a  pack was interrupted at every dozen or score of steps by the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2607"],[0,"Psmith, Journalist (#12)"],[1," the building is Seventh Avenue, quiet,  dark, and dull. To the left is Broadway, the Great White Way, the  longest, straightest, brightest, wickedest street in the world.    Psmith and Billy, having left the Astor, started to walk down  Broadway to Billy's lodgings in Fourteenth Street. The usual crowd  was drifting slowly up and down in the glare of the white lights.    They had reached Herald Square, when a voice behind them exclaimed,  \"Why, it's Mr. Windsor!\"    They wheeled round. A flashily dressed man was standing with  outstetched hand.    \"I saw you come out of the Astor,\" he said cheerily. \"I said to  myself, 'I know that man.' Darned if I could put a name to you,  though. So I just followed you along, and right here it came to  me.\"    \"It did, did it?\" said Billy politely.    \"It did, sir. I've never set eyes on you before, but I've seen so  many photographs of you that I reckon we're old friends. I know  your father very well, Mr. Windsor. He showed me the photographs.  You may have heard him speak of me--Jack Lake? How is the old man?  Seen him lately?\"    \"Not for some time. He was well when he last wrote.\"    \"Good for him. He would be. Tough as a plank, old Joe Windsor. We  always called him Joe.\"    \"You'd have known him down in Missouri, of course?\" said Billy.    \"That's right. In Missouri. We were side-partners for years. Now,  see here, Mr. Windsor, it's early yet. Won't you and your friend  come along with me and have a smoke and a chat? I live right here  in Thirty-Third Street. I'd be right glad for you to come.\"    \"I don't doubt it,\" said Billy, \"but I'm afraid you'll have to  excuse us.\"    \"In a hurry, are you?\"    \"Not in the least.\"    \"Then come right along.\"    \"No, thanks.\"    \"Say, why not? It's only a step.\"    \"Because we don't want to. Good night.\"    He turned, and started to walk away. The other stood for a moment,  staring; then crossed the road.    Psmith broke the silence.    \"Correct me if I am wrong, Comrade Windsor,\" he said tentatively,  \"but were you not a trifle--shall we say abrupt?--with the old  family friend?\"    Billy Windsor laughed.    \"If my father's name was Joseph,\" he said, \"instead of being  William, the same as mine, and if he'd ever been in Missouri in his  life, which he hasn't, and if I'd been photographed since I was a  kid, which I haven't been, I might have gone along. As it was, I  thought it better not to.\"    \"These are deep waters, Comrade Windsor. Do you mean to intimate--?\"    \"If they can't do any better than that, we shan't have much to  worry us. What do they take us for, I wonder? Farmers? Playing off  a comic-supplement bluff like that on us!\"    There was honest indignation in Billy's voice.    \"You think, then, that if we had accepted Comrade Lake's  invitation, and gone along for a smoke and a chat, the chat would  not have been of the pleasantest nature?\"    \"We should have been put out of business.\"    \"I have heard so much,\" said Psmith, thoughtfully, \"of the lavish  hospitality of the American.\"    \"Taxi, sir?\"    A red taximeter cab was crawling down the road at their side. Billy  shook his head.    \"Not that a taxi would be an unsound scheme,\" said Psmith.    \"Not that particular one, if you don't mind.\"    \"Something about it that offends your aesthetic taste?\" queried  Psmith sympathetically.    \"Something about it makes my aesthetic taste kick like a mule,\"  said Billy.    \"Ah, we highly strung literary men do have these curious  prejudices. We cannot help it. We are the slaves of our  temperaments. Let us walk, then. After all, the night is fine, and  we are young and strong.\"    They had reached Twenty-Third Street when Billy stopped. \"I don't  know about walking,\" he said. \"Suppose we take the Elevated?\"    \"Anything you wish, Comrade Windsor. I am in your hands.\"    They cut across into Sixth Avenue, and walked up the stairs to the  station of the Elevated Railway. A train was just coming in.    \"Has it escaped your notice, Comrade Windsor,\" said Psmith after a  pause, \"that, so far from speeding to your lodgings, we are going  in precisely the opposite direction? We are in an up-town train.\"    \"I noticed it,\" said Billy briefly.    \"Are we going anywhere in particular?\"    \"This train goes as far as Hundred and Tenth Street. We'll go up to  there.\"    \"And then?\"    \"And then we'll come back.\"    \"And after that, I suppose, we'll make a trip to Philadelphia, or  Chicago, or somewhere? Well, well, I am in your hands, Comrade  Windsor. The night is yet young. Take me where you will. It is  only five cents a go, and we have money in our purses. We are two  young men out for reckless dissipation. By all means let us have  it.\"    At Hundred and Tenth Street they left the train, went down the  stairs, and crossed the street. Half-way across Billy stopped.    \"What now, Comrade Windsor?\" inquired Psmith patiently. \"Have you  thought of some new form of entertainment?\"    Billy was making for a spot some few yards down the road. Looking  in that direction, Psmith saw his objective. In the shadow of the  Elevated there was standing a taximeter cab.    \"Taxi, sir?\" said the driver, as they approached.    \"We are giving you a great deal of trouble,\" said Billy. \"You must  be losing money over this job. All this while you might be getting  fares down-town.\"    \"These meetings, however,\" urged Psmith, \"are very pleasant.\"    \"I can save you worrying,\" said Billy. \"My address is 84 East  Fourteenth Street. We are going back there now.\"    \"Search me,\" said the driver, \"I don't know what you're talking  about.\"    \"I thought perhaps you did,\" replied Billy. \"Good night.\"    \"These things are very disturbing,\" said Psmith, when they were in  the train. \"Dignity is impossible when one is compelled to be the  Hunted Fawn. When did you begin to suspect that yonder merchant was  doing the sleuth-hound act?\"    \"When I saw him in Broadway having a heart-to-heart talk with our  friend from Missouri.\"    \"He must be something of an expert at the game to have kept on our  track.\"    \"Not on your life. It's as easy as falling off a log. There are  only certain places where you can get off an Elevated train. All  he'd got to do was to get there before the train, and wait. I  didn't expect to dodge him by taking the Elevated. I just wanted to  make certain of his game.\"    The train pulled up at the Fourteenth Street station. In the  roadway at the foot of the opposite staircase was a red taximeter  cab.        CHAPTER XIII    REVIEWING THE SITUATION      Arriving at the bed-sitting-room, Billy proceeded to occupy the  rocking-chair, and, as was his wont, began to rock himself  rhythmically to and fro. Psmith seated himself gracefully on the  couch-bed. There was a silence.    The events of the evening had been a revelation to Psmith. He had  not realised before the extent of the ramifications of New York's  underworld. That members of the gangs should crop up in the Astor  roof-garden and in gorgeous raiment in the middle of Broadway was a  surprise. When Billy Windsor had mentioned the gangs, he had formed  a mental picture of low-browed hooligans, keeping carefully to  their own quarter of the town. This picture had been correct, as  far as it went, but it had not gone far enough. The bulk of the  gangs of New York are of the hooligan class, and are rarely met  with outside their natural boundaries. But each gang has its more  prosperous members; gentlemen, who, like the man of the Astor  roof-garden, support life by more delicate and genteel methods than  the rest. The main body rely for their incomes, except at  election-time, on such primitive feats as robbing intoxicated  pedestrians. The aristocracy of the gangs soar higher.    It was a considerable time before Billy spoke.    \"Say,\" he said, \"this thing wants talking over.\"    \"By all means, Comrade Windsor.\"    \"It's this way. There's no doubt now that we're up against a mighty  big proposition.\"    \"Something of the sort would seem to be the case.\"    \"It's like this. I'm going to see this through. It isn't only that  I want to do a bit of good to the poor cusses in those tenements,  though I'd do it for that alone. But, as far as I'm concerned,  there's something to it besides that. If we win out, I'm going to  get a job out of one of the big dailies. It'll give me just the  chance I need. See what I mean? Well, it's different with you. I  don't see that it's up to you to run the risk of getting yourself  put out of business with a black-jack, and maybe shot. Once you get  mixed up with the gangs there's no saying what's going to be doing.  Well, I don't see why you shouldn't quit. All this has got nothing  to do with you. You're over here on a vacation. You haven't got to  make a living this side. You want to go about and have a good time,  instead of getting mixed up with--\"    He broke off.    \"Well, that's what I wanted to say, anyway,\" he concluded.    Psmith looked at him reproachfully.    \"Are you trying to _sack_ me, Comrade Windsor?\"    \"How's that?\"    \"In various treatises on 'How to Succeed in Literature,'\" said  Psmith sadly, \"which I have read from time to time, I have always  found it stated that what the novice chiefly needed was an editor  who believed in him. In you, Comrade Windsor, I fancied that I had  found such an editor.\"    \"What's all this about?\" demanded Billy. \"I'm making no kick about  your work.\"    \"I gathered from your remarks that you were anxious to receive my  resignation.\"    \"Well, I told you why. I didn't want you be black-jacked.\"    \"Was that the only reason?\"    \"Sure.\"    \"Then all is well,\" said Psmith, relieved. \"For the moment I  fancied that my literary talents had been weighed in the balance  and adjudged below par. If that is all--why, these are the mere  everyday risks of the young journalist's life. Without them we  should be dull and dissatisfied. Our work would lose its fire. Men  such as ourselves, Comrade Windsor, need a"]]]
