But being accustomed to  the over-ornamented and wholly mechanical, we do not resent their  presence. For what, indeed, is habit not responsible? Even such innocent  objects as pictures hang on our walls until they are scarcely noticed by  us. Why not change them to suit our moods? Why not, indeed? There are so  many of them, in the first place--and one remembers the time and  trouble, even the family dissension which it took to hang them. But no  one cares much, no one is alive enough to care much--the economic  struggle which deadens our other senses is responsible for this also.    No unit of the social body can disentangle itself from existing  conditions. Each is affected by all its influences. Some are more, some  less, some are so much a part that they are not conscious. These last  also suffer, but without knowing why. Vital education would show them.  But the factory system pervades the school and art school as well as the  factory.    What if the underlying force of education were spontaneous expression,  instead of the limited method or system? The cry of the teacher is  always, \"It is very well to be spontaneous, but we must deal with the  child _en masse_.\" The remedy for that is simple, because there is no  real necessity to deal with children _en masse_. It is so much easier to  apply the same system to each varied unit of a mass than to discover and  help the individual expression of each. The basis of vital art, of vital  education, is self-expression; from it and through it comes  self-control. Self-repression is as socially uneconomic as jails and  standing armies. If, instead of building prisons where human life is  entombed, libraries where literature moulds, museums where art becomes  archaic, why not establish centers of education, where spontaneous  expression is encouraged, and where the soul, mind, and hand are  simultaneously developed.    Think of a state where each individual working out from its own  standpoint, truly without hypocrisy, would contribute his quota of  individual life to the life of the whole. Pleasing himself in his work  without fear. Then would come the true democracy, possible only under  just economic conditions, where each has equal opportunity for  self-expression. Then can the higher emotional life develop necessary to  all human growth.    [Illustration]          KRISTOFER HANSTEEN.    By VOLTAIRINE DE CLEYRE.      \"OF the earth, unearthly--\"    The sentence remained unfinished as I had written it two years and a  half ago when Disease laid its hand on me, and all my MSS. ended in a  dash. It was a description of Kristofer Hansteen, an explanation of his  work in Norway. And now that I am ready to pick up the thread of life  again, I read that he is dead--of the earth no more, he who hardly ever  belonged to it. At this moment the most insistent memory I have of that  delicate, half-aerial personality are the words: \"When the doctors told  me that I might perhaps not live longer than spring, I thought: 'If I  die, what will become of Anarchism in Norway?'\" He had no other idea of  his meaning in life than this.    Somewhere fluctuant in my memory runs broken music--you have heard  it?--\"an ineffectual angel, beating his luminous wings within the  void,\"--something like that,--words descriptive of Shelley--they haunt  me whenever I would recall Kristofer Hansteen. Perhaps to those who had  known him in his youth, before his body was consumed like a half-spent  taper, he might have seemed less spirit-like; but when I met him, three  years ago this coming August, his eyes were already burning with  ethereal fires, the pallor of waste was on the high, fine forehead, the  cough racked him constantly, and there was upon the whole being the  unnameable evanescence of the autumn leaf; only--his autumn came in  summer.    The utter incapacity of the man before the common, practical  requirements of life would have been irritating to ordinary individuals.  The getting of a meal or the clothing of the body with reference to the  weather, were things that he thought of vaguely, uncomfortably, only  with forced attention. What he saw clearly, entranced by the vision, was  the future--the free future. He had been touched by the wan wizard of  Olive Schreiner's Dream of Wild Bees, and \"the ideal was real to him.\"  The things about him, other people's realities, were shadows--oppressive  shadows, indeed, but they did not concern him deeply. It was the great  currents of life he saw as real things, and among all the confusion of  world-movements he could trace the shining stream that ran towards  liberty; and with his hectic face and burning eyes he followed it, torn  by the cough and parched by the fever.    The Hansteens are a well-known family in Norway, clever and often  eccentric, Kristofer's aunt, Aosta Hansteen, at the time of my visit an  old lady over eighty, having fought many a battle for the equality of  woman both in Norway and America. Artist, linguist, and literary woman  of marked ability, but, after the manner of her cotemporaries, rather  outlandish and even outrageous in her attacks on masculine prerogative,  she is a target for satirists and wits, few of whom, however, approach  her virility of intellect. Her father, Kristofer's grandfather, was an  astronomer and mathematician. In his youth Kristofer had gone afoot  through the \"dals\" of Norway, and when he took me through the art  galleries of Kristiania he was a most interesting guide, through his  actual acquaintance with the scenes and the characters of the dalesmen  depicted. He knew the lights upon the snow and rocks, just what time of  the year shone on the leaves, where the wood-paths wound, the dim  glories of the mist upon the fjords, the mountain stairways in their  craggy walls, and the veiled colors of the summer midnight. And he knew  the development of Norwegian art life and literary life, as one who  wanders always in those paths, mysteriously lit.    Our hours of fraternization were few but memorable. He was a frequent  visitor at the house of Olav Kringen, the editor of the daily Social  Democrat, a big, kindly Norseman, who had remembered me from America,  and who had defended me in his paper against the ridiculous charge in  the ordinary press that I had come there to assassinate Kaiser Wilhelm.  Through the efforts of Hansteen and the kindliness and largemindedness  of Kringen and his Socialistic comrades, I spoke before the Socialistic  League of Youth in their hall in Kristiania. The hall was crowded, over  eight hundred being present, and there was some little money in excess  of expenses, which was given to me. I shared it with Hansteen, and he  looked up with a bright flash in his dark eyes: \"Now,\" said he, \"'Til  Frihet' will come out one month sooner.\" \"Til Frihet\" (Towards Freedom)  was his paper; and would you know how it came out? He set it up in his  free moments, he did the mechanical work; and then, being too poor to  pay for its delivery through the post, except the few copies that were  sent abroad, he took it from house to house himself, over the hills of  Kristiania!--he, a consumptive, the cough rending him!    There was a driving rain the night I left the city; he wore no rubbers  or gum-coat. I was in hopes that he might think the propaganda deserved  that its one active worker should get a pair of rubbers, since he must  carry papers through the rain. I reminded him that he should keep his  feet dry; he only glanced at them as if they were no concern of his,  and--\"'Til Frihet' will come out one month sooner.\"    It was in \"Til Frihet\" that he had been guilty of high treason. It  happened once that King Oscar, in temporary retirement from public  king-business, had left over to the Crown Prince the execution of  certain matters, which according to the \"Ground Law\" of Norway could not  be so left; whereupon Comrade Hansteen printed an editorial saying,  \"Oscar has broken the ground-law, and there is no more a King in  Norway.\" For this he was charged with high treason, and to escape  imprisonment he went to England, where he remained about a year among  the London comrades. On his return, there was some threat of carrying  out the prosecution, but, probably to avoid wider publication of the  king's \"treason,\" the matter was dropped. Previous to that Comrade  Hansteen had had experience of prison life. In a May-day procession,  ostensibly to include all labor reform or revolutionary parties, he,  declaring that Anarchists should be given place too, marched, carrying a  red flag. The chief of police directed a subordinate to take the flag  away from him. Easily enough done, but not, as an evidence of unwilling  submission, before he had struck the official in the face with his hand.  That little hand, weak and delicate as a woman's! An ordinary man would  have pushed it aside like a feather and thought no more of it; but the  official paid tribute to the big will behind the puny flesh by  sentencing him to seven months in prison.    My ignorance of Norwegian prevents my giving any adequate idea of his  work. I know he was the author of a little pamphlet, \"Det frie samfund\"  (Free Society), and that he had translated and published one of  Krapotkin's works (whether \"The State\" or \"The Conquest of Bread,\" I do  not now remember), which he had issued in a series of instalments,  intended ultimately to be bound together. As I recall the deep  earnestness of his face in speaking of the difficulties he had had in  getting it out, and the unsolved difficulties still facing its  completion, I find myself wanting to pray that he saw that precious  labor finished. It was so much to him. And I prophecy that the time will  come when young Norwegians will treasure up those sacrificial fragments  as dearer than any richer and fuller literature. They are the heart's  blood of a dying "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27341"],[0,"Mother Earth, Vol. 1 No. 4, June 1906 (#12)"],[1,"ods. We  instill respect for law, wealth and morality. We withdraw the land and  other natural resources from general use. With a show of generous  sentiment, we allow the lambs we have shorn to assist us in the  shearing of other lambs.    Every morning and every evening we see a long procession of men and  women going or coming from the work, at which they have given up their  life force for the sake of a mere pittance. Look at these men and women!  There they go, evidently free! No shackles are on their hands or feet,  no overseer keeps them in check by club or gun. There they go  voluntarily to their prison factories, offices, stores, in the morning;  and in the evening, when the glorious sun is hidden from sight, they  come out again, haggard and worn, to creep to their prison homes.    When the savage desires to rob you, he may attempt to strangle and maim  you. But the civilized man scorns such crude methods. He builds cheap  tenements in which you may gradually and surely choke to death; and not  satisfied with that, he, with a great show of kindness, prepares your  foods for you, that they may slowly, very slowly, but surely, hasten  your deliverance. Babies are not frankly murdered any more, but they are  served with nice, adulterated milk, which accomplishes the same purpose  in a quieter way.    Under the name of law many atrocious crimes are committed. Imprisonment,  capital punishment and war are yet crude in their methods. They are  still susceptible of more refining. Here cruelty has rather a thin  garment on and needs to be covered up a little more.    Even in our every-day relations with each other, we use many and varied  forms of refined cruelty. When displeased, we no longer beat each other,  but we use the subtler forces of sarcasm, irony, slander, neglect. We  regard directness a rudeness, when in reality it is the greatest  kindness imaginable. Instead of being positive and direct in our  dealings with each other, we constantly exercise a passive cruelty, in  other words, the cruelty of refinement. We are evasive, delusive,  subdued, falsified. But we deceive with dignity, tell falsehoods  fluently, use words and cold behavior as daggers.    To-day we do not turn away an unwelcome visitor, but we announce that we  are not at home; or we slander him behind his back. When we love we  pretend to be modest and indifferent, while, in an indirect way, we  attempt to build walls around the person we love. There is nothing free  in the expression of our emotions, for we are subdued, crushed; we are  civilized!    Everything is sham and hypocrisy, and hidden daggers are everywhere, in  one form or another. These daggers are concealed under kindness,  charity, benevolence, morality, law, and are, therefore, difficult to  deal with. The blades are thrust into the back; you can feel them, but  you cannot grapple with them.    Our inherent cruelty is best illustrated in the treatment we give those  who are absolutely in our power--little children and the dumb animals.  With what authority do we elicit respect and obedience from our little  people! With rod in hand and with venomous tongues we begin the process  of subjugating and civilizing our little free, emotional people. In the  name of \"their highest good\" do we mould them to be actors, that they  may properly enact the tragedy of life as we had enacted it before them!    The dumb animals receive the cream of our refined cruelty. In order to  appear civilized, we drive in carriages pulled by horses whose spinal  columns have been docked, whose necks are held stiff by tight check  reins, whose eyes are blinded by \"fashionable\" devices.    There used to be cannibalism and human sacrifices; there used to be  religious prostitution and the murder of weak children and of girls;  there used to be bloody revenge and the slaughter of whole populations,  judicial tortures, quarterings, burnings at the stake, the lash, and  slavery, which have disappeared. But if we have outlived these dreadful  customs and institutions, this does not prove that there do not exist  institutions and customs amongst us which have become as abhorrent to  enlightened reason and conscience as those which have in their time been  abolished and have become for us only a dreadful remembrance. The way of  human perfecting is endless, and at every moment of historical life  there are superstitions, deceits, pernicious and evil institutions  already outlived by men and belonging to the past; there are others  which appear to us in the far mists of the future; and there are some  which we are now living through and whose over-living forms the object  of our life. Such in our time is capital punishment and all punishment  in general. Such is prostitution, such is the work of militarism, war,  and such is the nearest and most obvious evil, private property in land.    [Illustration]          \"THE JUNGLE.\"    A Recension by VERITAS.      \"THE JUNGLE,\" a recent story by Upton Sinclair, is a nightmare of  horrors, of which the worst horror is that it is not a phantom of the  night, but claims to be true history of one phase of our  twentieth-century civilization. Nothing but the book itself could  represent its own tragic power. In my opinion it is the most terrible  book ever written.    It is for the most part a tale of the abattoirs, those unspeakable  survivals in our Christendom in which man reeks his savage and sensual  will on the lesser animals; and indirectly it is a story of the moral  abattoirs of politics, economics, society, religion and the home, where  the victims are of the species human, and where man's inhumanity to man  is as selfish and relentless as his age-long cruelty to his brothers and  sisters just behind him in the great procession.    Possibly the title is inappropriate. There is a \"law of the pack,\" which  is observed in the genuine jungle, but these human beasts appear to have  all of the jungle's vices and few of its virtues. The author might have  called his history, \"The Slaughter House,\" or, perhaps, plain \"Hell.\"    It is a common saying about a packing house, \"We use all of the hog  except the squeal.\" This author uses the squeal, or, rather, the wild  death shrieks of agony of the ten millions of living creatures tortured  to death every year in Chicago and the other tens of millions elsewhere,  to pander to the old brutal, inhuman thirst of humanity for a diet of  blood. The billions of the slain have found a voice at last, and if I  mistake not this cry of anguish from the \"killing-beds\" shall not sound  on until men, whose ancestors once were cannibals, shall cease to devour  even the corpses of their murdered animal relatives. But while \"The  Jungle\" will undoubtedly make more vegetarians, it would take more than  the practice of universal vegetarianism to cause the book to fulfil its  mission; for this is a story of Civilization's Inferno and of the crisis  of the world, a recital of conditions for which, when once comprehended,  there can be no remedy but the revolution of revolutions, the event  toward which the ages ran, the establishment of a genuine political,  industrial and social democracy.[2]    If the story be dramatized and Mrs. Fiske take the part of Ona, her  presentation will make Tess seem like a pastoral idyll in comparison.    The book is great even from a political standpoint.    But more than this, it is a great moral appeal. Not in Victor Hugo or  Charles Dickens does the moral passion burn with purer or intenser light  than in these pages.    I should not advise children or very delicately constituted women to  read it.    I have said it is a book of horrors. I started to mark the passages of  peculiar tragedy and found that I was marking every page, and yet it is  a justifiable book and a necessary book.    The author tells as facts the story of \"diseased meat,\" and worse, the  preparation in the night time of the bodies of the cattle which have  died from known and unknown causes before reaching the slaughter pens,  and the distribution of the effects, with the rest of the intentional  killing of the day; he describes the preparation of \"embalmed beef\" from  cattle covered with boils; he even narrates the story of \"men who fell  into the vats,\" and \"sometimes they would be overlooked for days till  all but the bones of them had gone out to the world as Durham's Pure  Leaf Lard\"; he writes of the making of smoked sausage out of waste  potatoes by the use of chemicals and out of spoiled meat as well; and he  further speaks of rats which were \"nuisances, and the packers would put  poisoned bread out for them; they would die, and then rats, bread and  meat would go into the hoppers together. This is no fairy story and no  joke; the meat would be shovelled into carts and the man who did the  shovelling would not trouble to lift out a rat even when he saw  one--there were things which went into the sausage in comparison with  which a poisoned rat was a tidbit.\"    But the worst of the story is a tale of the condition of the workers at  Packingtown and elsewhere. It is the story of strong men who justly  hated their work; of men, for no fault of their own, cast out in middle  life to die; of weeping children driven with whips to their ignoble  toil; of disease-producing conditions in winter, only surpassed by the  deadly summer; of people working with their feet upon the ice and their  heads enveloped in hot steam; of the perpetual stench which infests  their nostrils, the sores which universally covered their bodies; of the  terrible pace set by the continual \"speeding up\" of the pace makers,  goaded to a pitch of frenzy; of accidents commonplace in every family;  of the garbage pile of refuse from the tables of more fortunate  citizens, from which many were forced to satisfy their hunger; of the  terrors of the black list, the shut-down, the strike and the lockout;  and of the universal swindle, whether a man bought a house,"]]]
