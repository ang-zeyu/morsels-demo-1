Therefore, I beg you,  Gentlemen, look well to yourselves, for in all probability you may live  some Months longer.    _Matt._ We are heartily sorry, Captain, for your Misfortune. --But 'tis  what we must all come to.    _Macheath._ _Peachum_ and _Lockit_, you know, are infamous Scoundrels.  Their Lives are as much in your Power, as yours are in theirs.  --Remember your dying Friend! --'Tis my last Request. --Bring those  Villains to the Gallows before you, and I am satisfied.    _Matt._ We'll do't.    _Jailor._ Miss _Polly_ and Miss _Lucy_ intreat a Word with you.    _Macheath._ Gentlemen, adieu.

The  Catastrophe is manifestly wrong, for an Opera must end happily.    _Beggar._ Your Objection, Sir, is very just, and is easily remov'd. For  you must allow, that in this kind of Drama, 'tis no matter how absurdly  things are brought about-- So-- you Rabble there-- run and cry,  A Reprieve! --let the Prisoner be brought back to his Wives in Triumph.    _Player._ All this we must do, to comply with the Taste of the Town.    _Beggar._ Through the whole Piece you may observe such a Similitude of  Manners in high and low Life, that it is difficult to determine whether  (in the fashionable Vices) the fine Gentlemen imitate the Gentlemen of  the Road, or the Gentlemen of the Road the fine Gentlemen. --Had the  Play remained, as I at first intended, it would have carried a most  excellent Moral. 'Twould have shewn that the lower Sort of People have  their Vices in a degree as well as the Rich: And that they are punish'd  for them.    _To them, _Macheath_ with _Rabble_, &c._    _Macheath._ So, it seems, I am not left to my Choice, but must have a  Wife at last. --Look ye, my Dears, we will have no Controversy now. Let  us give this Day to Mirth, and I am sure she who thinks herself my Wife  will testify her Joy by a Dance.    _All._ Come, a Dance-- a Dance.    _Macheath._ Ladies, I hope you will give me leave to present a Partner  to each of you. And (if I may without Offence) for this time, I take  _Polly_ for mine. --And for Life, you Slut,-- for we were really  marry'd. --As for the rest. --But at present keep your own Secret.

The music in the printed book appears to be a hand-written copy of the  1765 original, retaining or adding assorted minor errors. In particular,  the use of double bar lines or repeats seems to be almost entirely  arbitrary. In the PDF and MIDI files, obvious errors such as missing  dots after notes have been corrected, and a few ties have been added.  Repeats are used only when required by the lyrics as printed.    All music files, including the PDF images, are in the \"Music\" directory.  In addition to individual Airs, there are PDF files containing the  collected songs for each scene that has more than one song. Air LXVIII  (the final song) has been omitted because it takes up a complete page by  itself.      _Changing the Tempo_    If you want to change the tempo of a MIDI file, do this:    --Install the lilypond program (free from lilypond.org)    --Open the file you want to edit (named in the form \"air_N.ly\" using the  same Roman numerals as in the text) and scroll down to the bottom. The  \"make-moment\" line works just like a metronome setting. Leave the second  number alone--usually a 4 for quarter-note--and make the first number  larger or smaller.    --Select \"Run\" or \"Typeset File\" from the Compile menu. This will create  three files in the same location as the original .ly file: an updated  MIDI, a new PDF, and a Postscript (.ps) file. You may keep the  Postscript file or delete it; they are automatically generated, but were  omitted from this Project Gutenberg text because they are very large and  are easy to make on your own computer."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2520"],[0,"The Man (#12)"],[1,"the  ground at a terrific pace.  Harold was not given to alarms, but here  might be serious danger.  Three spirited horses in a light cart made for  pace, all bolting in fright, might end any moment in calamity.  Never in  his life did he ride faster than on the road to Norling Parva.  Far ahead  of him he could see at the turn, now and again, a figure running.  Something had happened.  His heart grew cold: he knew as well as though  he had seen it, the high cart swaying on one wheel round the corner as  the maddened horses tore on their way; the one jerk too much, and the  momentary reaction in the crash! . . .    With beating heart and eyes aflame in his white face he dashed on.    It was all too true.  By the side of the roadway on the inner curve lay  the cart on its side with broken shafts.  The horses were prancing and  stamping about along the roadway not recovered from their fright.  Each  was held by several men.    And on the grass two figures were still lying where they had been thrown  out.  Rowly, who had of course been on the off-side, had been thrown  furthest.  His head had struck the milestone that stood back on the waste  ground before the ditch.  There was no need for any one to tell that his  neck had been broken.  The way his head lay on one side, and the twisted,  inert limbs, all told their story plainly enough.    Squire Norman lay on his back stretched out.  Some one had raised him to  a sitting posture and then lowered him again, straightening his limbs.  He  did not therefore look so dreadful as Rowly, but there were signs of  coming death in the stertorous breathing, the ooze of blood from nostrils  and ears as well as mouth.  Harold knelt down by him at once and examined  him.  Those who were round all knew him and stood back.  He felt the ribs  and limbs; so far as he could ascertain by touch no bone was broken.    Just then the local doctor, for whom some one had run, arrived in his  gig.  He, too, knelt beside the injured man, a quick glance having  satisfied him that there was only one patient requiring his care.  Harold  stood up and waited.  The doctor looked up, shaking his head.  Harold  could hardly suppress the groan which was rising in his throat.  He  asked:    'Is it immediate?  Should his daughter be brought here?'    'How long would it take her to arrive?'    'Perhaps half an hour; she would not lose an instant.'    'Then you had better send for her.'    'I shall go at once!' answered Harold, turning to jump on his horse,  which was held on the road.    'No, no!' said the doctor, 'send some one else.  You had better stay here  yourself.  He may become conscious just before the end; and he may want  to say something!'  It seemed to Harold that a great bell was sounding in  his ears.--'Before the end!  Good God!  Poor Stephen!' . . . But this was  no time for sorrow, or for thinking of it.  That would come later.  All  that was possible must be done; and to do it required a cool head.  He  called to one of the lads he knew could ride and said to him:    'Get on my horse and ride as fast as you can to Normanstand.  Send at  once to Miss Norman and tell her that she is wanted instantly.  Tell her  that there has been an accident; that her father is alive, but that she  must come at once without a moment's delay.  She had better ride my horse  back as it will save time.  She will understand from that the importance  of time.  Quick!'    The lad sprang to the saddle, and was off in a flash.  Whilst Harold was  speaking, the doctor had told the men, who, accustomed to hunting  accidents, had taken a gate from its hinges and held it in readiness, to  bring it closer.  Then under his direction the Squire was placed on the  gate.  The nearest house was only about a hundred yards away; and thither  they bore him.  He was lifted on a bed, and then the doctor made fuller  examination.  When he stood up he looked very grave and said to Harold:    'I greatly fear she cannot arrive in time.  That bleeding from the ears  means rupture of the brain.  It is relieving the pressure, however, and  he may recover consciousness before he dies.  You had better be close to  him.  There is at present nothing that can be done.  If he becomes  conscious at all it will be suddenly.  He will relapse and probably die  as quickly.'    All at once Norman opened his eyes, and seeing him said quietly, as he  looked around:    'What place is this, Harold?'    'Martin's--James Martin's, sir.  You were brought here after the  accident.'    'Yes, I remember!  Am I badly hurt?  I can feel nothing!'    'I fear so, sir!  I have sent for Stephen.'    'Sent for Stephen!  Am I about to die?'  His voice, though feeble, was  grave and even.    'Alas! sir, I fear so!'  He sank on his knees as he spoke and took him,  his second father, in his arms.    'Is it close?'    'Yes.'    'Then listen to me!  If I don't see Stephen, give her my love and  blessing!  Say that with my last breath I prayed God to keep her and make  her happy!  You will tell her this?'    'I will!  I will!'  He could hardly speak for the emotion which was  choking him.  Then the voice went on, but slower and weaker:    'And Harold, my dear boy, you will look after her, will you not?  Guard  her and cherish her, as if you were indeed my son and she your sister!'    'I will.  So help me God!'  There was a pause of a few seconds which  seemed an interminable time.  Then in a feebler voice Squire Norman spoke  again:    'And Harold--bend down--I must whisper!  If it should be that in time you  and Stephen should find that there is another affection between you,  remember that I sanction it--with my dying breath.  But give her time!  I  trust that to you!  She is young, and the world is all before her.  Let  her choose . . . and be loyal to her if it is another!  It may be a hard  task, but I trust you, Harold.  God bless you, my other son!'  He rose  slightly and listened.  Harold's heart leaped.  The swift hoof-strokes of  a galloping horse were heard . . . The father spoke joyously:    'There she is!  That is my brave girl!  God grant that she may be in  time.  I know what it will mean to her hereafter!'    The horse stopped suddenly.    A quick patter of feet along the passage and then Stephen half dressed  with a peignoir thrown over her, swept into the room.  With the soft  agility of a leopard she threw herself on her knees beside her father and  put her arms round him.  The dying man motioned to Harold to raise him.  When this had been done he laid his hand tenderly on his daughter's head,  saying:    'Let now, O Lord, Thy servant depart in peace!  God bless and keep you,  my dear child!  You have been all your life a joy and a delight to me!  I  shall tell your mother when I meet her all that you have been to me!  Harold, be good to her!  Good-bye--Stephen! . . . Margaret! . . . '    His head fell over, and Harold, laying him gently down, knelt beside  Stephen.  He put his arm round her; and she, turning to him, laid her  hand on his breast and sobbed as though her heart would break.    * * * * *    The bodies of the two squires were brought to Normanstand.  Rowly had  long ago said that if he died unmarried he would like to lie beside his  half-sister, and that it was fitting that, as Stephen would be the new  Squire of Norwood, her dust should in time lie by his.  When the terrible  news of her nephew's and of Norman's death came to Norwood, Miss Laetitia  hurried off to Normanstand as fast as the horses could bring her.    Her coming was an inexpressible comfort to Stephen.  After the first  overwhelming burst of grief she had settled into an acute despair.  Of  course she had been helped by the fact that Harold had been with her, and  she was grateful for that too.  But it did not live in her memory of  gratitude in the same way.  Of course Harold was with her in trouble!  He  had always been; would always be.    But the comfort which Aunt Laetitia could give was of a more positive  kind.    From that hour Miss Rowly stayed at Normanstand.  Stephen wanted her; and  she wanted to be with Stephen.    After the funeral Harold, with an instinctive delicacy of feeling, had  gone to live in his own house; but he came to Normanstand every day.  Stephen had so long been accustomed to consulting him about everything  that there was no perceptible change in their relations.  Even necessary  business to be done did not come as a new thing.    And so things went on outwardly at Normanstand very much as they had done  before the coming of the tragedy.  But for a long time Stephen had  occasional bursts of grief which to witness was positive anguish to those  who loved her.    Then her duty towards her neighbours became a sort of passion.  She did  not spare herself by day or by night.  With swift intuition she grasped  the needs of any ill case which came before her, and with swift movement  she took the remedy in hand.    Her aunt saw and approved.  Stephen, she felt, was in this way truly  fulfilling her duty as a woman.  The old lady began to secretly hope, and  almost to believe, that she had laid aside those theories whose carrying  into action she so dreaded.    But theories do not die so easily.  It is from theory that practice takes  its real strength, as well as its direction.  And did the older woman  whose life had been bound under more orderly restraint but know, Stephen  was following out her theories, remorselessly and to the end.          CHAPTER IX--IN THE SPRING      The months since her father's death spread into the second year before  Stephen began to realise the loneliness of her life.  She had no  companion now but her aunt; and though the old lady adored her, and she  returned her love in full, the mere years between them made impossible  the companionship that youth craves.  Miss Rowly's life was in the past.  Stephen's was in the future.  And loneliness is a feeling which comes  unbidden to a heart.    Stephen felt"]]]
