Her apparatus was more simple than  that in the preceding figures, but closely allied to them; in fact the  same, with the exception of the calabash or basket, for which a more ready  substitute, one always ready, was adopted. \"A woman was seated on the  ground under the shade of one of the cotton-sheds; her left leg was tucked  under her, and her foot was turned sole upwards; between her big toe and  the next was a spindle about eighteen inches long, with a single fly of  four or six inches; now and then she gave it a twist in a dexterous manner,  and at its end was drawn a coarse cotton thread. Such was their spinning  jenny.\" This application of the toes is like that practised by the wives  and daughters of the Hindoo weavers: the axles of their light cane reels  are thus held when winding off the thread. The foot however is in front of  its owner, and in a natural position, nor does the stick grasped by the  toes revolve.    The Pimos and Maricopas are in their habits, agriculture, religion, and  manufactures, the same.    [Illustration: Indians Spinning Coarse Thread.]    A process of undoubted antiquity, and occasionally followed by modern  Indians, is shown in the above engraving. The spinner holds in the left  hand, horizontally, a short piece of hollow reed or cane, within which the  spindle is twirled by the fingers and thumb of the right hand. Sometimes a  cross stick or handle is attached, as represented in the figure. A second  person performs the part of a distaff, which, as the thread lengthens,  recedes from the spinner, or the spinner from it. A section of this  primitive apparatus is separately portrayed.    Mr. Van--a delegate now in Washington from the Cherokee nation, to obtain a  settlement of claims on the United States for their lands in Georgia,  Alabama, &c.--states that the large old spinning-wheel has, to his  knowledge, been in the possession of the Cherokees nearly fifty years. His  mother, a Creek, and over a hundred years of age, he believes, used to spin  with it in her youth. Mr. Van has seen Indians twist coarse thread with  apparatus like that here represented, and which in all probability formed  one of the contrivances that slowly led to the whirling spindle, in both  hemispheres.    For the next two illustrations of spinning, by the Navajoes, Camanches, and  other tribes of New Mexico, the Patent Office is indebted to Judge Peters,  of Santa Fe, New Mexico.    We have here another instance in which the thread-making idea has  manifested itself among the red race, and a very interesting one. The  spinner has a small stick, which she holds horizontally in one hand, and on  it winds the thread, as on a spindle, as fast as it is spun. The bunch of  cotton is itself twirled round by means of a short and small rod, passed  through the lower part, with its ends projecting. A pebble is commonly  fastened to the middle of this stick (_d_), and serves as a fly to keep up  the motion, and assist, by its weight, in drawing out the thread. To keep  the stone and stick in their places, a piece of yarn is wound loosely round  the bunch. The length of thread is seldom over six or eight inches, before  it is wound on the stick. In this singular process, the classical mode is  completely reversed--the spindle, or that which corresponds to it, is held  at rest, and the distaff put in motion, in which respect the operation is  unique. The idea of increasing the momentum of the whirling mass by the  introduction of a weight into its centre is here realized.    [Illustration: A Comanche Spinning.]    [Illustration: Navajoes Spinning.]    In the case illustrated below, two pieces of board or shingle are pinned to  opposite sides of the fork of a small tree or stump. A spindle (a smooth  rod ten or twelve inches in length) is passed through, and made to turn in  them, as in two journals. See the section S, where _a_, _a_ is the spindle  and _b_, _b_, the boards, and _c_ a pin to keep the spindle in its place.  To whirl the spindle, a cross stick, _d_, is tied to the large end.  Sometimes a stone is folded in a piece of cloth, and fastened to each end  of the cross stick, which answers the purpose of a rude flywheel. When a  suitable stick, having a branch at right angles, can be procured, the cross  stick and spindle are of one piece, as at S. A notch is made at the small  end of the spindle, where the thread unites to it, and thus, while one girl  turns the spindle, another, with a bunch of loose cotton, supplies it, and,  as the thread lengthens, gradually recedes from it. As soon as a full  length is twisted, it is wound round the spindle, another length is added,  and so on, till the spindle is fully charged. The thread is then wound off  into a hank, and the spindle set again for working.    These illustrations of primitive art possess a deeper and a more extensive  interest than that of their relation to a few Indian tribes; they are types  of thought, more or less common to the species, to barbarous and  semi-civilized people of all times; such as we ourselves would adopt, were  we thrown on our own resources, without any knowledge or recollection on  the subject.    [Illustration: Aztec Girl Weaving. From Mendoza's Collection.]    It is difficult to determine from this figure whether the shuttle was  developed in ancient Mexico. It is not represented, and appears not to have  existed any more than the distaff. The loom is like those now used by  American Indians. Colonel Emory, after speaking of the Pimos spinning,  says, \"Led on by this primitive display, I asked for their loom, by  pointing to the thread and then to the blanket girded about the woman's  loins. A fellow stretched in the dust, sunning himself, rose up leisurely,  and untied a bundle, which I had supposed to be a bow and arrow. This  little package with four stakes in the ground, was his loom, and he  stretched his cloth and commenced the process of weaving. He had no  shuttle, the warp being passed across the woof, a thread at a time, by a  long wooden needle. One of the rods in the preceding figure is doubtless  designed to represent a needle, and was used in the same way.\" If the  figures here introduced truly indicate the progress made by the Aztecs in  spinning and weaving, their advance was very moderate; and though very  creditable work might be made with this weaving apparatus, by individual  skill and patience, it would seem that few or no attempts had been made to  render it more facile and efficient. The same remark is, however,  applicable to the looms of Asia and Africa. It is worth noting, that the  dress of females, pictured above, indicates a decided improvement on that  of less civilized tribes. Aztec women and girls wore pantalettes, and a  species of tunic, with short sleeves and ornamental borders, not unlike the  Chinese female costume, except in the shortness of the sleeves. Amulets or  keepsakes, suspended over the neck and resting on the bosom, seem also to  have been common.    Modern Peruvian Indians spin without the distaff, and their loom is  precisely like the ancient one just represented--the shuttle, or what  answers the purpose of one, being a long thorn needle, which is passed  through the woof, thread by thread. Every piece is woven of the precise  width wanted, whether for garments, cocoa-bags, or any thing else, with no  waste by cutting. Ancient specimens of cloth, of excellent execution, have  been found in their tombs. The length of the needles varies with the width  of the piece to be woven.    That very fine fabrics were produced in Old Mexico, and by implements  little if at all better than those here figured, is doubtless true. The  highly colored accounts by the conquerors are believed to have been fully  warranted by the fineness of the goods which they saw. Indeed, some of the  richest of modern shawls and dresses, turned out of the looms of Persia,  Egypt, and Hindostan, are but a degree superior to those of the Aztecs.  Personal tact and skill are every thing with semi-civilized artisans. The  ancient spindle and loom of the East, singularly enough, are still  preserved and used for special purposes in modern Rome, just as they were  thirty or forty centuries ago. A recent writer on the Pallium (an  ecclesiastical robe of lamb's wool) says, there stands about a mile outside  the Porta Pia, on the road to Tivoli, an old convent of nuns, attached to  the still more ancient church of St. Agnes; that these nuns are poor, and  rarely receive any of Rome's high-born damsels to their lonely and  neglected cloister; but that they have a small paddock appendant to the  monastery, and therein keep a couple of sacred lambs, (not necessarily of  the Merino breed,) and are proud and happy ministrants of their wool for  the texture of this noble decoration, spinning it, not by any new-fangled  jennies, but on the old patriarchal spindle, and weaving it in a loom of  which the pattern might date from the days of Penelope.    In conclusion, we may remark, of this subject, that to the substitution of  circular for straight motions, and of continuous for alternating ones, may  be attributed nearly all the conveniences and elegances of civilized life.  It is not too much to assert that the present advanced state of science and  the arts is due to revolving mechanism. We may speak of the wonders  effected by steam and other motive agents, but of what value would they  have been without this means of their employment? The applications of  rotary in place of other movements are conspicuous in modern history, from  those which propel steamships through the water and locomotives over land,  to those which are employed in the manufacture of pins and the pointing of  needles.

The mahout leaned forward and gently bent it  down. Now, all was clear. The tiger's eyes were like green glass. The  elephant for a moment stood like stone. I touched the trigger.    There was no response to the loud report of 6 drams of powder from the  '577 rifle, no splash in the unbroken surface of the water. The tiger's  head was still there, but in a different attitude, one-half below the  surface, and only one cheek, and one large eye still glittering like an  emerald, above.    \"Run in quick,\"---and the order was instantly obeyed, as Nielmonne  splashed through the pool towards the silent body of the tiger. There  was not a movement of a muscle. I whistled loud, then looked at my  watch---on the stroke of 1 P.M. From 8.30 till that hour we had worked  up that tiger, and although there was no stirring incident connected  with him, I felt very satisfied with the result.    In a short time the elephants arrived, having heard the shot, followed  by my well-known whistle. Moota Gutche was the first to approach; and  upon observing the large bright eye of the tiger above water, he  concluded that it was still alive; he accordingly made a desperate  charge, and taking the body on his tusks, he sent it flying some yards  ahead; not content with this display of triumph, he followed it up, and  gave it a football-kick that lifted it clean out of the water. This  would have quickly ended in a war-dance upon the prostrate body, that  would have crushed it and destroyed the skin, had not the mahout, with  the iron driving-hook, bestowed some warning taps upon the crown of  Moota Gutche's head that recalled him to a calmer frame of mind. A rope  was soon made fast to the tiger's neck, and Moota Gutche hauled it upon  dry ground, where it was washed as well as possible, and well  scrutinized for a bullet-hole.    There was no hole whatever in that tiger. The bullet having entered the  nostril, broken the neck, and run along the body, the animal  consequently had never moved. The first shot, when obscured in thick  jungle, had probably deflected from the interposing reeds---at all  events it missed. This tiger, when laid out straight, but without being  pulled to increase its length, measured exactly 9 feet 8 inches from  nose to tail.        CHAPTER III    THE ELEPHANT (continued)    The foregoing chapter is sufficient to explain the ferocity of the male  elephant at certain seasons which periodically affect the nervous  system. It would be easy to multiply examples of this cerebral  excitement, but such repetitions are unnecessary. The fact remains that  the sexes differ materially in character, and that for general purposes  the female is preferred in a domesticated state, although the male  tusker is far more powerful, and when thoroughly trustworthy is capable  of self-defence against attack, and of energy in work that would render  it superior to the gentler but inferior female.  (The female differs  from other quadrupeds in the position of her teats, which are situated  upon the breast between the fore legs. She is in the habit of caressing  her calf with her trunk during the operation of suckling.)    It may be inferred that a grand specimen of a male elephant is of rare  occurrence. A creature that combines perfection of form with a firm but  amiable disposition, and is free from the timidity which unfortunately  distinguishes the race, may be quite invaluable to any resident in  India. The actual monetary value of an elephant must of necessity be  impossible to decide, as it must depend upon the requirements of the  purchaser and the depth of his pocket. Elephants differ in price as much  as horses, and the princes of India exhibit profuse liberality in paying  large sums for animals that approach their standard of perfection.    The handsomest elephant that I have ever seen in India belongs to the  Rajah of Nandgaon, in the district bordering upon Reipore. I saw this  splendid specimen among twenty others at the Durbar of the Chief  Commissioner of the Central Provinces in December 1887, and it  completely eclipsed all others both in size and perfection of points.  The word \"points\" is inappropriate when applied to the distinguishing  features of an elephant, as anything approaching the angular would be  considered a blemish. An Indian elephant to be perfect should be 9 feet  6 inches in perpendicular height at the shoulder. The head should be  majestic in general character, as large as possible,--especially broad  across the forehead, and well rounded. The boss or prominence above the  trunk should be solid and decided, mottled with flesh-coloured spots;  these ought to continue upon the cheeks, and for about three feet down  the trunk. This should be immensely massive; and when the elephant  stands at ease, the trunk ought to touch the ground when the tip is  slightly curled. The skin of the face should be soft to the touch, and  there must be no indentations or bony hollows, which are generally the  sign of age. The ears should be large, the edges free from inequalities  or rents, and above all they ought to be smooth, as though they had been  carefully ironed. When an elephant is old, the top of the ear curls, and  this symptom increases with advancing years. The eyes should be large  and clear, the favourite colour a bright hazel. The tusks ought to be as  thick as possible, free from cracks, gracefully curved, very slightly to  the right and left, and projecting not less than three feet from the  lips. The body should be well rounded, without a sign of any rib. The  shoulders must be massive with projecting muscular development; the back  very slightly arched, and not sloping too suddenly towards the tail,  which should be set up tolerably high. This ought to be thick and long,  the end well furnished with a double fringe of very long thick hairs or  whalebone-looking bristles. The legs should be short in proportion to  the height of the animal, but immensely thick, and the upper- portion  above the knee ought to exhibit enormous muscle. The knees should be  well rounded, and the feet be exactly equal to half the perpendicular  height of the elephant when measured in their circumference, the weight  pressing upon them whilst standing.    The skin generally ought to be soft and pliable, by no means tight or  strained, but lying easily upon the limbs and body.    An elephant which possesses this physical development should be equal in  the various points of character that are necessary to a highly-trained  animal.    When ordered to kneel, it should obey instantly, and remain patiently  upon the ground until permitted to rise from this uneasy posture. In  reality the elephant does not actually kneel upon its fore knees, but  only upon those of the hinder legs, while it pushes its fore legs  forward and rests its tusks upon the ground. This is a most unnatural  position, and is exceedingly irksome. Some elephants are very impatient,  and they will rise suddenly without orders while the ladder is placed  against their side for mounting. Upon one occasion a badly-trained  animal jumped up so suddenly that Lady Baker, who had already mounted,  was thrown off on one side, while I, who was just on the top of the  ladder, was thrown down violently upon the other. A badly-tutored  elephant is exceedingly dangerous, as such vagaries are upon so large a  scale that a fall is serious, especially should the ground be stony.    A calm and placid nature free from all timidity is essential. Elephants  are apt to take sudden fright at peculiar sounds and sights. In  travelling through a jungle path it is impossible to foretell what  animals may be encountered on the route. Some elephants will turn  suddenly round and bolt, upon the unexpected crash of a wild animal  startled in the forest. The scent or, still worse, the roar of a bear  within 50 yards of the road will scare some elephants to an extent that  will make them most difficult of control. The danger may be imagined  should an elephant absolutely run away with his rider in a dense forest;  if the unfortunate person should be in a howdah he would probably be  swept off and killed by the intervening branches, or torn to shreds by  the tangled thorns, many of which are armed with steel-like hooks.    It is impossible to train all elephants alike, and very few can be  rendered thoroughly trustworthy; the character must be born in them if  they are to approach perfection.    Our present perfect example should be quite impassive, and should take  no apparent notice of anything, but obey his mahout with the regularity  of a machine. No noise should disturb the nerves, no sight terrify, no  attack for one moment shake the courage; even the crackling of fire  should be unheeded, although the sound of high grass blazing and  exploding before the advancing line of fire tries the nerves of  elephants more than any other danger.    An elephant should march with an easy swinging pace at the rate of 5  miles an hour, or even 6 miles within that time upon a good flat road.  As a rule, the females have an easier pace than the large males. When  the order to stop is given, instead of hesitating, the elephant should  instantly obey, remaining rigidly still without swinging the head or  flapping the ears, which is its inveterate and annoying habit. The  well-trained animal should then move backward or forward, either one or  several paces, at a sign from the mahout, and then at once become as  rigid as a rock.    Should the elephant be near a tiger, it will generally know the position  of the enemy by its keen sense of smell. If the tiger should suddenly  charge from some dense covert with the usual short but loud roars, the  elephant ought to remain absolutely still to receive the onset, and to  permit a steady aim from the person in the howdah. This is a very rare  qualification, but"]]]
