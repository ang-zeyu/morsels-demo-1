Long, slow trots along the Sussex highways and by-ways, behind the  bicycle of the Master or the Mistress, hardened Finn's round feet  without overstraining his young legs, for the reason that the pace  was always set with special reference to his capabilities in this  direction. Even in the winter nine-tenths of his waking hours were  spent in the open; yet so wise and constant was the supervision of  his life that he never knew what chill meant, and never lay on damp  ground, never missed a meal, and never suffered from the penalties  which attend overtaxed canine digestion, as surely as they attend  the same state in human beings.    [Illustration]    On the morning of his first birthday, Finn, with his sister  Kathleen and Tara and the Master, walked down to the little local  railway station and was weighed. He weighed 119 lbs., exactly 26  1/2 lbs. more than his sister, and thirteen pounds less than his  mother. With the standard pressed down upon his shoulder-bones he  stood within an eighth of an inch of thirty-five inches in height.  (The height of Wolfhounds is measured from the shoulder to the  ground, not from the head.) It must be remembered that although  some dogs reach their full development in one year from birth,  Irish Wolfhounds are not really fully developed before the end of  the second year, though they may be said to attain their full  height, and probably their full length, in about eighteen months.  After that, however, comes a good deal of what breeders call  \"furnishing,\" which means filling out, general development of flesh  and muscle and coat, and an all-round hardening and \"setting.\"  Chest and loin deepen and widen a good deal in the second year;  ribs, legs, jaws, tail, and neck all develop and strengthen greatly  during this period, under such favourable conditions as Finn  enjoyed. But he was a noble-looking young hound, even on this day  which, technically, saw the end of his whelphood.    And then came three more months of Sussex downland summer, the  hunting of innumerable rabbits, out-of-door days which were fifteen  hours long, and a steadily increasing amount of slow-road exercise,  for which Finn was still fortified by three good meals a day, and  those of the best that care and science could devise. In early  October the Master devised a new game, tolerably amusing in its  way, but rather lacking in point and excitement, Finn thought. A  ring was marked out in the orchard by means of a few faggots being  stuck into the ground at intervals, and in the centre of this ring  the Mistress of the Kennels would take up her stand as a sort of  director of ceremonies. Then, sometimes with the assistance of the  maidservant and the gardener, and sometimes a couple of village  lads, Tara and Kathleen and Finn would be led gravely round and  round, and to and fro, by the Master, while all their movements  were closely watched from the centre of the ring. At first Finn  found this a good deal of a nuisance, because he disliked having a  lead attached to his collar; his inclination was to pull against it  sideways. Before him always, however, he had the gracious example  of his beautiful mother, who never did more than keep the lead  nicely tight while she marched round, with her head well up, her  tail hanging in a graceful sweeping curve, and her whole body  radiantly expressive of alertness. Gradually it was borne in upon  Finn that these were matters which touched his reputation, his  pride, his belief in himself; that he, Finn, was being observed and  judged with regard to his appearance and deportment. Once possessed  of this idea, who so stately proud in all the Wolfhound world as  Finn? At the end of a week he could march as sedately as Tara  herself, or bound forward with the springy elasticity of a tiger-cat  at a touch on his flank from the Master's hand; stand erect on  his hind-feet, with one fore-paw on the Master's forefinger raised  shoulder high; or fall to attention with hind-quarters well set  out, fore-feet even and forward, head up, and tail correctly  curved, in the position of a thoroughbred hackney at rest. It was  great fun to find how easily commendation could be earned from the  Master in this simple manner, for Finn never realized that quite a  number of hours of patient instruction and practice had been  devoted to the attainment of this end.    Then there came a mid-October morning when, in place of the early  scamper on the Downs, Finn and Kathleen were given a light  breakfast a little before daylight arrived, and after that were  treated to an unusually elaborate grooming. Finn had an exciting  sense of impending change and adventure, and even Tara seemed moved  to a stately kind of restlessness which kept her pacing the den as  though performing a minuet, instead of sitting or lying at her  ease. Tara seemed to be a good deal moved and excited when two  bright nickel chains, with queer little tin medals attached to  them, were produced, and fitted on two new green collars for Finn  and Kathleen. She nosed these chains with great interest, for they  roused all kinds of vague memories in her, and anticipations, too,  which she could not define to herself. (Finn and Kathleen had never  seen dog chains before, and paid very little heed to them now.  Their necks and shoulders had never tasted the irk of the state  which is called being \"tied up.\") The Master drew the attention of  the Mistress of the Kennels to Tara's interest in the chains, and  then he stroked the great bitch's head as he said--    \"Never any more, old lady. You have done your share, and shall  never be hustled about at shows again; so just lie down and go to  sleep. The Missis will be home to see you again this evening. Be a  good girl, and wish your son and daughter luck!\"    Tara watched them wistfully as they all filed out of the stable-yard  gateway to the road, and then, with the philosophy born of  honoured age and matronhood, returned to the den and lay down with  her muzzle on the Master's slippers.    Finn was weighed on the station platform that morning, and turned  the scale at 139 lbs., with nine months still before him for  \"furnishing.\"    \"Of course, one has to remember that not a single chance has been  missed with Finn,\" said the Master. \"His development is probably  some months ahead of the average hound of his age, but it is pretty  good at that; yes, I think it is pretty good.\"    And then a train came roaring into the station, and Finn and  Kathleen, who up till now had only occasionally seen trains from a  distance, lowered their tails, and pulled back a little on their  chains. The Master had a pleasant way with people like railway  guards, and this particular train had not very many people in it.  Accordingly the two young hounds presently found themselves in a  passenger compartment, the door of which was locked. So chains were  removed, and while Finn stood with his nose against the glass of  one window, Kathleen, facing the other way, had her nose against  the opposite window. When the train started, with a jerk, Finn had  his first abrupt sensation of travel, and he did not like it at  all. It seemed to him that the ground was suddenly snatched from  under him, and then he saw trees and posts and houses flying bodily  past him. He barked loudly at one little flying house, which seemed  almost to brush the window against which his nose rested, and the  Mistress of the Kennels laughed at him as she placed a hand  caressingly on his neck. Now Finn detested being laughed at. He did  not know what it meant, and when the Master laughed _with_ him,  during a frolic of any kind, he liked the sound very much. But  being laughed at always made the hair stir uncomfortably on his  shoulder-blades.  As the culprit in this case was the Mistress of  the Kennels, he did not even look at her angrily; but when Tara  laughed at him, as she often had done in the past, he always  protested with a sort of throaty beginning of a growl, which was  not so much really a growl as an equivalent for the sound humans  make and describe as \"Tut, tut!\" or \"Tsh, tsh!\" Finn did not again  bark at a flying house or tree; but, though the whole experience  interested him very much, he was greatly puzzled by some of the  phenomena connected with this railway journey.    In due course, but not before Finn had become comparatively blase  as a traveller, and more than a little weary of the whole thing,  the chains were put on again, and the hounds were led out from the  train into the midst of a crowd of strange people. Finn had no idea  that there were anything like so many people in the world as he  found pressing about him now, and many of them were leading dogs on  chains. Finn's attitude towards these strange dogs was one of  considerable reserve. He was very self-conscious; rather like a  young man from the country who suddenly and unexpectedly found  himself in the midst of some fashionable crush in London; an  exceedingly well-bred young man, of remarkably fine figure; a  sportsman of some prowess, too; but one who felt that he had not  been introduced to any of the members of the noisy, bustling  throng, and fancied that every one else was conscious of the fact.    New experiences were crowding thick and fast upon Finn and Kathleen  just now. After rubbing shoulders with this astonishing crowd for  some minutes, they found themselves face to face for the first time  in their lives with a flight of steps. True, they each felt a  soothing hand on their shoulders, a hand they knew and loved, but  the thing was disconcerting none the less. At first glance these  steps obviously called for small leaps and bounds as a mode of  progression. And yet, when one took ever so small a leap, one's  nose inevitably came into sharp contact with the legs of strange"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30560"],[0,"Music: An Art and a Language (#12)"],[1," the cadence is called perfect or  final, and may be compared to a period in punctuation, _e.g._    [Music] [Music: CESAR FRANCK]    [Footnote 54: In listening to a clock it is impossible to think of the  ticks singly, or otherwise than in groups of two: an accented beat and  an unaccented; although the beats are of equal strength and duration.  This principle of dual balance is derived from the rhythmic pulsation  of the human heart and, as we shall see, runs through all music.]    [Footnote 55: Whenever this book is used in class, the teacher can  easily explain, on the pianoforte and by charts, the different  cadential effects. For those who have sufficient harmonic insight  Chapter XIV in Foote and Spalding's _Modern Harmony_ is worth  consulting.]    A reversal of this order produces what is called the half-cadence,  akin to the semicolon, _e.g._    [Music]    The union of the subdominant and tonic chords is known as the Plagal  Cadence, _e.g._,    [Music]    and always gives a feeling of religious dignity and impressiveness.  Magnificent examples may be found in the closing measures of Wagner's  Overture to the _Mastersingers_ and of Brahms' _First Symphony in C  minor_. In the final cadence of Debussy's humorous piece for  pianoforte, _Minstrels_, the effect is burlesqued, _e.g._    [Music]    When dominant harmony is followed by some unexpected chord we have the  so-called Deceptive Cadence, which is not unlike the mark of  interrogation (?) or even exclamation (!) _e.g._    [Music: WAGNER: _Overture to the Mastersingers_]    [Music: TCHAIKOWSKY: _5th Symphony_]    This last cadence gives an effect of dramatic surprise--certainly an  exclamation of great force. One of the glories of modern music is the  daring novelty of cadential effect which has been achieved by such  composers as Franck, Debussy and Ravel; the student should try to  become more and more familiar with such harmonic combinations. A  beautiful example[56] is cited from Cesar Franck's _Sonata for Violin  and Pianoforte_.    [Footnote 56: See also the strikingly original cadences in Debussy's  _L'Isle joyeuse_.]    [Music]    The two endings for phrases are classified as Masculine and Feminine  and they correspond exactly to the same effects in the metre of a  poetic stanza. When the second chord of the cadence, whatever it may  be, coincides with a _strong_ beat, _i.e._, the first beat of the  measure, the ending is Masculine, _e.g._    [Music]    When the chord is carried over to a weak beat of the measure the  ending is Feminine, _e.g._    [Music]    We now give two more examples of the eight measure Sentence which  clearly exemplify the principles just stated, _e.g._    [Music: BEETHOVEN: 3rd Sonata]    In this vigorous and clear-cut sentence we find in the 4th measure an  effect of surprise and suspense; for the chord on the first beat is an  inverted position of the dominant chord in the dominant key. Both the  endings are masculine, _i.e._, the chords which end the phrases  coincide with the strong beats.    [Music: BEETHOVEN: 1st Sonata]    This graceful sentence is noteworthy for the clear division of the  first phrase into two contrasting sections; whereas, in the second  phrase, a climactic effect is gained by having no marked subdivision.  In the fourth measure occurs a good example of a half-cadence. All the  endings are feminine, _i.e._, the cadential chord occurs on a _weak_  beat of the measure.[57]    [Footnote 57: Another interesting eight-measure sentence may be found  at the beginning of the slow movement of Beethoven's Eighth Sonata, in  which every section differs from any one of the others; in the opening  sentence of the first movement of the Tenth Sonata--noticeable for the  indefiniteness of the cadences until the final close is reached in  measure 8, and in the first sentence of the Allegretto of the Sixth  Sonata which is one long sweep, with only the faintest indications of  subdivision.]    Music, however, would be very rigid and would seem measured off with a  yard-stick if the sentences were equally of eight measures. The  \"sing-song\" effect of much so-called popular music is due to the  stereotyped metrical pattern. You can always tell just where and how  you are coming out. In order to gain a free and elastic phraseology,  composers early began to combine three four-measure phrases into a  _twelve_ measure sentence. It is obvious that with three phrases there  can be more subtle effects of contrast and balance than with two, as  the following chart makes plain:     ____________  /            \\  A  Contrast   B   Contrast   C                 \\____________/  (4 measures)  (4 measures)   (4 measures)                balance  \\______________________________________/    [Music: BEETHOVEN: 6th Sonata]    In this sentence it is evident that we cannot stop at the 8th measure  and that our first definite conclusion is in measure 12. Let the  student observe the varied melodic outline in the three phrases, and  question himself as to the types of cadence and ending.      MINUETTO OF BEETHOVEN'S FIRST SONATA.[58]    [Footnote 58: Lack of space will prevent hereafter the citation in  actual notes of the examples from Beethoven. His works are readily  accessible, and it may even be assumed that every music-lover owns the  Pianoforte Sonatas.]    In this beautifully constructed twelve-measure sentence we have the  main motive of the entire movement set forth in measures 1 and 2;  then a contrasting secondary motive in measures 3 and 4. The second  four-measure phrase, _i.e._, measures 5, 6, 7 and 8, repeats the  material exactly, but with a modulation into the relative major. In  measures 9 and 10 we find the secondary motive appearing in the alto  voice (which should be brought out in performance), and in measures 11  and 12 a free ending in the relative major. The closing measures, 13  and 14, give an echo-like effect, which will be explained when we come  to extended sentences. Such a sentence is not to be considered as one  of 14 measures, although the literal counting gives that number; for  the first complete cadence occurs in the 12th measure at the end of  the third four-measure phrase; the remaining measures being  supplementary.[59]    [Footnote 59: Another excellent example of a 12 measure sentence with  an extended cadence may be found at the beginning of the first  movement of the Third Beethoven Sonata.]    The last type of simple, normal sentence is that of 16 measures,  divided into 4 phrases of 4 measures each. A clear distinction must be  drawn between two successive sentences of 8 measures and the long  sweep of a genuine 16 measure sentence. In the latter case there is no  complete and satisfactory stop until we reach the cadence in the 16th  measure.      FIRST SENTENCE OF THE FIRST MOVEMENT OF THE TWELFTH SONATA.    No difficulty will be found in following the cadences and endings of  this sentence, the long-drawn out lines of which give an impression of  repose and tranquillity. Two more excellent examples of 16 measure  sentences may be found in the Adagio of the Fifth Sonata, and in the  Scherzo of the Third; the latter movement is remarkable for the  polyphonic treatment of the opening motive.    Although the three types of sentence just studied, _i.e._, of 8, 12  and 16 measures are the normal ones, and would include a majority of  all sentences--especially in smaller works--in large compositions  there would be an unendurable monotony and rigidity were there  invariably to be cadential pauses at every 4th measure. We all know  the deadening effect of poetry which has too great uniformity of  metric pattern; and verses of \"The boy stood on the burning-deck\" type  are considered thoroughly \"sing-song.\" It is obvious that elasticity  may be gained, without disturbing the normal balance, by expanding a  sentence through the addition of extra measures, or contracting it by  the logical omission of certain measures or by the overlapping of  phrases.    The simplest and most common means of enlarging a sentence is by the  extension, or repetition, of the final cadence--that effect which is  so frequent in the chamber and symphonic music of Haydn, and which has  its comic manifestation in the so-called \"crescendo\" of the Rossini  Operatic Overture.[60]    [Footnote 60: For a burlesque of this practise see the closing  measures of the Scherzando movement of Beethoven's Eighth Symphony.]    [Music: HAYDN: _Quartet, op. 74, No. 2_]    As Haydn was an important pioneer in freeing instrumental structure  from dependence on the metre of words, his periods are always clearly  organized; the closing measures of this example seem, as it were, to  display a flag, telling the listener that the first breathing-place is  reached. Very often both the fore-phrase and the after-phrase have  cadential prolongations, an example of which may be found in Haydn's  Quartet, op. 71, No. 3. The two following illustrations (the first  movement of Beethoven's Fifth Sonata and the third movement of the  Fourth) furnish remarkable examples of extended 16 measure sentences;  each sentence being normal and symmetrical at the outset and then, as  the fancy of the composer catches fire, expanding in a most dramatic  fashion. Sometimes the additional measures, in an extended sentence,  are found at the start; a clear example of this is the first sentence  (with its repeated opening measure) of the Largo of the Seventh  Sonata. Sentences are also often expanded by the insertion of one or  more measures in the middle of the phrase, _e.g._, the beginning of  the first movement of the Seventh Sonata and the corresponding place  in the Fourth. In the former sentence the first phrase is perfectly  regular, but as we reach our final cadence only in the tenth measure,  we must account for some additional measures. The polyphonic imitation  of the descending motive of measure 5 makes clear that this measure  has two repetitions. In the"]]]
