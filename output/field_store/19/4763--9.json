[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24852"],[0,"The Wonders of the Jungle, Book One (#12)"],[1,"of the Wonders of Nature_    Now I am coming to one of the nicest kinds of deer in the world, and I  am sure you will just love him! He lives in India, and is called the  _barking deer_; only, he is not exactly a deer, but an antelope. You  remember what I have told you before, about an antelope having a  different kind of horns? Still we must call him the barking deer, as  people have already given him that name.    He is very small, about the size of a goat. If there is any danger  from an enemy, the barking deer is small enough to hide in any little  bush or behind a fallen tree or log; or else he can run away very  quietly through the under bushes. And he runs so quickly that his  enemy soon loses sight of him.    He is called the barking deer, because he can bark or yap almost like  a dog. But, you may ask, why does he want to bark at all, if he is  afraid of some enemy? Will not the enemy hear him, and then catch him?    Yes, that is quite true. And yet the fact that he does bark is one of  the most wonderful things in the jungle. It is so wonderful that in  another book I shall tell you more about it. But now I shall tell you  just this:    There are some animals which are so deadly that they could kill off  many, many other animals. So, as the only way to save the other  animals from being all killed, _God has made some special animals to  fight those deadly animals_.    There is the _cobra_, which is a snake, and which has such a deadly  poison that it could kill almost all other animals in the jungle by  just biting them. So, to save the other animals from being killed by  the cobra, God made the _mongoose_. He is a plucky little creature,  about the size of a cat. And he will fight and kill every cobra he  sees! But really he is such a wonderful animal that I must keep him  for another book, when you are old enough to know him better and to  love him.    But sometimes the deadly animal is too strong to be killed himself.  There is the tiger. He can kill and eat many kinds of animals. But who  can kill _him_? No animal! At least, the elephant and the buffalo  could kill the tiger if the tiger should let them _catch_ him and  trample on him. But the tiger does not let any animal catch him. Then  how can the other animals be saved from the tiger?    God made two special animals to save the others from the tiger. The  first is the buffalo, of which I have already told you, and which is  the Knight of the Jungle. The second animal is the barking deer. How  the barking deer saves the other animals from the tiger, I shall now  tell you:    When the tiger is prowling about, all other kinds of deer and antelope  just run away, and are glad enough if they escape being eaten. But  not the plucky little barking deer! He too runs away, but as soon as  he gets a little ahead of the tiger, he stops under a bush and lets  out that bark or yap--then runs on at once to another bush.    The tiger is furious, and jumps on the bush where he heard the  bark--but the deer is not there now! The deer barks from that second  bush--and runs to another one. In this way the barking deer leads the  tiger on and on through the jungle from bush to bush.    And why does he bark like that? To tell the other animals in good time  that the tiger is coming, and then to tell them exactly _where_ the  tiger is.    \"Look out, here's a tiger!\" That is the meaning of his first bark.    \"Here he is! He is coming after me--this way!\" That is what he means  by the next bark.    \"He is chasing me this way! You run the other way!\" And that is what  the barking deer keeps on saying, as he runs from bush to bush, so  that all the other animals know exactly where the tiger is at each  minute.    In this way the barking deer runs through the jungle, _warning all the  other animals_, and so spoiling the tiger's dinner all the way.          CHAPTER X    Deer and Antelope: Their Special Gifts      You have learned by this time that _every animal has some special  gift_, that is, he can do one thing better than most other animals.  The deer and the antelope have their special gifts.    First, there is their gift of _hearing_. I have already told you that  the wild buffaloes can hear a long way; but the deer and the antelope  can hear still farther.    Let us suppose that a tiger is trying to creep up to a deer through  the jungle, as quietly as he can. The tiger is still a long way off,  and quite hidden by the bushes, so the deer cannot _see_ him at all.  But the deer can _hear_ him coming, even if the tiger takes each step  very lightly. Why? Because the deer's ears are so sharp that he can  hear even a leaf rustling under the tiger's foot, a long way off. So  the deer can run away in good time.    To make him hear still better, the deer can turn or bend his ears to  the side from which the sound is coming. You have seen an ordinary  cow prick up her ears when she heard somebody coming; and many other  animals--even a dog--can do the same.    But the deer can do that best. The shape of his ear is like that of a  funnel, so as to _pour_ the sound into his ear, as it were. Then even  if there is only a single drop of sound, it gets right into his ear.    And by turning or bending his ear, the deer knows which way the sound  is coming. You also can tell which way a sound is coming, if it is  loud enough; but the deer can do that even when the sound is very  faint. That is very useful to him, as he then knows exactly _which  way_ a sneaking tiger is coming, and can run the _other way_.    I must now tell you that the tiger himself, tries to come so quietly  that the deer may not hear him at all; and to help him to do so, his  feet are padded with muscles, just like cushions. So it is a kind of  trial between the tiger and the deer as to which is the more clever.  If the tiger can come so quietly that the deer cannot hear him, then  the tiger is more clever than the deer. But if the deer can hear the  tiger, even if the tiger comes most quietly, then the deer is more  clever than the tiger.    That kind of trial between two different animals as to which is the  more clever, goes on in the jungle all the time: and _the more clever  one wins every time_. If the tiger is more clever than the deer, the  tiger eats the deer; but if the deer is more clever than the tiger,  the deer escapes being eaten. And that is true of all other animals.  In fact, one of the great wonders of the jungle is that the animal  which is _the fittest wins the oftenest_; and so he goes on living,  whatever may happen to the others.[1]    [Footnote 1: _To the Teacher._--Please give the class other examples  of the \"Survival of the Fittest\" among other creatures--birds,  insects, fish, etc.]    Now I come to the second special gift of the deer and the antelope. If  by any chance a deer cannot hear a sneaking tiger, he can still  _smell_ the tiger.    Most animals can smell their enemy a long way off, even if they do not  hear him or see him; but _the deer and the antelope can smell the  farthest_. Even if a sneaking tiger is so cunning that he stops in a  thicket and stands quite still for a minute, so that he does not make  any sound at all,--and so the deer cannot hear him,--even then the  deer can smell him when he is still a long way off.    I must tell you now that the tiger himself can smell the deer. But he  cannot do that very far off,--so the deer always smells him _first_!    Also, the tiger can hear the deer, if the deer happens to be moving.  But the tiger cannot hear quite so far as the deer can. So the deer  always hears him _first_!    But in one thing the tiger is better off than the deer: _the tiger can  see farther than the deer_. In the night most animals can see a  little, but the tiger can see a little better and farther than the  others. And in the daytime, if a deer were feeding in a very big level  field, and a tiger came to the field from the other side, the tiger  would see the deer before the deer could see him. Then the tiger would  come round to the nearest thicket, and try to creep up to the deer  from thicket to thicket.      _Each Animal has the Gift he Needs Most_    So, you understand, the deer can _hear_ farther and _smell_ farther;  but the tiger can _see_ farther.    And that is so because it is a wonderful rule in the jungle that _each  animal has the gift that he needs most_.    But can you think why the tiger _needs_ to see farther, and why the  deer _needs_ to hear farther and smell farther? I shall tell you.    The tiger is the catcher, and the deer is the one that is caught. So  the tiger tries to get to the deer, and the deer tries to run _from_  the tiger.    But to get to the deer, it would be no use to the tiger if he could  only smell or hear the deer, for then he would only know that the deer  was _somewhere_ near, but could not find the exact spot; and to catch  the deer the tiger must know exactly where the deer is. So the best  way for him to know that is to _see_ the deer.    But for the deer himself, all that he needs to know is that a tiger is  somewhere near. So it is quite enough for him to know from which side  the tiger is coming, by just smelling him or hearing him. Then the  deer can run the other way at once. He does not want to see the tiger  at all!    So, you understand, the tiger's best gift is to be able to see the  deer; and the deer's best gift is to be able to smell and hear the  tiger.    But then, you may ask, if the deer can always run away long before the  tiger can get at him, does a tiger never catch a deer?    Yes, a tiger does catch a deer once in a while, if the deer happens  to make a mistake! And the deer can make only one mistake like that in  his life, because after the first he gets eaten!    So, you may be sure, the deer tries very hard never to make even that  one mistake.    And what is that one mistake? It is to run straight into the jaws of  the tiger! It may just happen that when the deer"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24855"],[0,"Concrete Construction: Methods and Costs (#12)"],[1,"el, hence 1.05 bbls.  would weigh 380 × 1.05 = 399 lbs. Sand weighs 2,700 lbs. per cu. yd.,  hence 0.44 cu. yd. of sand would weigh 2,700 × 0.44 = 1,188 lbs. The  combined weight of the cement and sand would thus be 399 + 1,188 = 1,587  lbs. and 12 per cent. of 1.587 lbs. is 190 lbs. of water. Water weighs  8.355 lbs. per gallon, hence 190 × 8.355 = 23 gallons of water per cubic  yard of 1-3-6 concrete.    ~METHODS OF MEASURING AND WEIGHING.~--The cement, sand and aggregate for  concrete mixtures are usually measured by hand, the measuring being done  either in the charging buckets or in the barrows or other receptacles  used to handle the material to the charging buckets. The process is  simple in either case when once the units of measurement are definitely  stated. This is not always the case. Some engineers require the  contractor to measure the sand and stone in the same sized barrel that  the cement comes in, in which case 1 part of sand or aggregate usually  means 3.5 cu. ft. Other engineers permit both heads of the barrel to be  knocked out for convenience in measuring the sand and stone, in which  case a barrel means 3.75 cu. ft. Still other engineers permit the cement  to be measured loose in a box, then a barrel usually means from 4 to 4.5  cu. ft. Cement is shipped either in barrels or in bags and the engineer  should specify definitely the volume at which he will allow the original  package to be counted, and also, if cement barrels are to be used in  measuring the sand and stone, he should specify what a \"barrel\" is to  be. When the concrete is to be mixed by hand the better practice is to  measure the sand and stone in bottomless boxes of the general type shown  by Fig. 10 and of known volume, and then specify that a bag of cement  shall be called 1 cu. ft., 0.6 cu. ft., or such other fraction of a  cubic foot as the engineer may choose. The contractor then has a  definite basis on which to estimate the quantity of cement required for  any specified mixture. The same is true if the measuring of the sand and  stone be done in barrows or in the charging bucket. The volume of the  bag or barrel of cement being specified the contractor has a definite  and simple problem to solve in measuring his materials.    [Illustration: Fig. 10.--Bottomless Box for Measuring Materials in  Proportioning Concrete.]    To avoid uncertainty and labor in measuring the cement, sand and stone  or gravel various automatic measuring devices have been designed. A  continuous mixer with automatic measuring and charging mechanism is  described in Chapter XIV. Figure 11 shows the Trump automatic measuring  device. It consists of a series of revolving cylinders, each opening  onto a \"table,\" which revolves with the cylinders, and of a set of fixed  \"knives,\" which, as the \"tables\" revolve, scrape off portions of the  material discharged from each cylinder onto its \"table.\" The  illustration shows a set of two cylinders; for concrete work a third  cylinder is added. The three tables are set one above the other, each  with its storage cylinder, and being attached to the same spindle all  revolve together. For each table there is a knife with its own  adjusting mechanism. These knives may be adjusted at will to vary the  percentage of material scraped off.    [Illustration: Fig. 11.--Sketch Showing Trump Automatic Measuring Device  for Materials in Proportioning Concrete.]    Automatic measuring devices are most used in connection with continuous  mixers, but they may be easily adapted to batch mixers if desired. One  point to be observed is that all of these automatic devices measure the  cement loose and this must be allowed for in proportioning the mixture.          CHAPTER III.    METHODS AND COST OF MAKING AND PLACING CONCRETE BY HAND.      The making and placing of concrete by hand is divided into the following  operations: (1) Loading the barrows, buckets, carts or cars used to  transport the cement, sand and stone to the mixing board; (2)  Transporting and dumping the material; (3) Mixing the material by  turning with shovels and hoes; (4) Loading the concrete by shovels into  barrows, buckets, carts or cars; (5) Transporting the concrete to place;  (6) Dumping and spreading; (7) Ramming.    ~LOADING INTO STOCK PILES.~--Stock piles should always be provided unless  there is some very good reason to the contrary. They prevent stoppage of  work through irregularities in the delivery of the material, and they  save foreman's time in watching that the material is delivered as  promptly as needed for the work immediately in hand. The location of the  stock piles should be as close to the work as possible without being in  the way of construction; forethought both in locating the piles and in  proportioning their size to the work will save the contractor money.    The stone and sand will ordinarily be delivered in wagons or cars. If  delivered in cars, effort should be made to secure delivery in flat cars  when the unloading is to be done by shoveling; this is more particularly  necessary for the broken stone. Stone can be shoveled from hopper bottom  cars only with difficulty as compared with shoveling from flat bottom  cars; the ratio is about 14 cu. yds. per day per man from hopper bottom  cars as compared with 20 cu. yds. per day per man from flat bottom cars.  When the cars can be unloaded through a trestle, hopper bottom cars  should by all means be secured for delivering the stone. If the amount  of work will justify the expense, a trestle may be built; often there is  a railway embankment which can be dug away for a short distance and the  track carried on stringers to make a dumping place, from which the stone  can be shoveled.    Sand can be dumped directly on the ground, but broken stone unless it is  very small, ¾-in. or less, should always be dumped on a well made plank  floor. A good floor is made of 2-in. plank, nailed to 4×6-in. mud sills,  spaced 3 ft. apart, and well bedded in the ground. Loose plank laid  directly on the ground settle unevenly and thus the smooth shoveling  surface which is sought is not obtained; the object of the floor is to  provide an even surface, along which a square pointed shovel can be  pushed; it is very difficult to force such a shovel into broken stone  unless it is very fine. A spading fork is a better tool than a shovel,  with which to load broken stone from piles. A man can load from 18 to 20  cu. yds. of broken stone into wheelbarrows or carts in 10 hours when  shoveling from a good floor, but he can load only 12 to 14 cu. yds. per  day when shoveling from a pile without such a floor. It is a common  thing to see stone unloaded from cars directly onto the sloping side of  a railway embankment. This makes very difficult shoveling and results in  a waste of stone. Stone can usually be delivered by a steel lined chute  directly to a flooring located at the foot of the embankment; coarse  broken stone if given a start when cast from a shovel will slide on an  iron chute having a slope as flat as 3 or 4 to 1; sand will not slide on  a slope of 1½ to 1. When chuting is not practicable it will pay often to  shovel the stone into buckets handled by a stiff-leg derrick rather than  to unload it onto the bank. Stock piles of ample storage capacity are  essential when delivery is by rail, because of the uncertainty of rail  shipments. When the contractor is taking the sand and stone direct from  pit and quarry by wagon it is not necessary to have large stock piles.    ~LOADING FROM STOCK PILES.~--In loading sand into wheelbarrows or carts  with shovels a man will load 20 cu. yds. per 10-hour day if he is  energetic and is working under a good foreman. Under opposite conditions  15 cu. yds. per man per day is all that it is safe to count on. A man  shoveling from a good floor will load 20 cu. yds. of stone per 10-hour  day; this is reduced to 15 cu. yds. per day if the stone is shoveled off  the ground and to 12 cu. yds. per day if in addition the management is  poor. There are ordinarily in a cubic yard of concrete about 1 cu. yd.  of stone and 0.4 cu. yd. of sand, so that the cost of loading the  materials into barrows or carts, with wages at 15 cts. per hour and  assuming 15 cu. yds. to be a day's work, would be:    1   cu. yd. stone loaded for        10 cts.  0.4 cu. yd. sand loaded for          4 cts.                                      -------      Total                           14 cts.    To this is to be added the cost of loading the cement. This will cost  not over 2 cts. per cu. yd. of concrete; the total cost of loading  concrete materials into barrows or carts, therefore, does not often  exceed 16 cts. per cu. yd. of concrete.    ~TRANSPORTING MATERIALS TO MIXING BOARDS~--Carrying the sand and stone  from stock piles to mixing board in shovels should never be practiced.  It takes from 100 to 150 shovelfuls of stone to make 1 cu. yd.; it,  therefore, costs 50 cts. per cu. yd. to carry it 100 ft. and return  empty handed, for in walking short distances the men travel very  slowly--about 150 ft. per minute. It costs more to walk a half dozen  paces with stone carried in shovels than to wheel it in barrows.    The most common method of transporting materials from stock piles to  mixing boards is in wheelbarrows. The usual wheelbarrow load on a level  plank runway is 3 bags of cement (300 lbs) or 3 cu. ft. of sand or  stone. If a steep rise must be overcome to reach the mixing platform the  load will be reduced to 2 bags (200 lbs.) of cement or 2 cu. ft. of sand  or stone. A man wheeling a barrow travels at a rate of 200 ft. per  minute, going and coming, and loses ¾ minute each trip dumping the load,  fixing run planks, etc. An active man will do 20 to 25 per cent. more  work than this, while a very lazy man may do 20 per cent. less. With  wages at 15 cts. per hour, the cost of wheeling materials for 1 cu. yd.  of concrete may be obtained by the following rule:    _To a fixed "]]]
