So Francis Cabot Lowell, scion of  the New England family of that name, an importing merchant of Boston,  conceived the idea of establishing weaving mills in Massachusetts. On a  visit to Great Britain in 1811, Lowell met at Edinburgh Nathan Appleton,  a fellow merchant of Boston, to whom he disclosed his plans and  announced his intention of going to Manchester to gain all possible  information concerning the new industry. Two years afterwards, according  to Appleton's account, Lowell and his brother-in-law, Patrick T.  Jackson, conferred with Appleton at the Stock Exchange in Boston.  They had decided, they said, to set up a cotton factory at Waltham and  invited Appleton to join them in the adventure, to which he readily  consented. Lowell had not been able to obtain either drawings or model  in Great Britain, but he had nevertheless designed a loom and had  completed a model which seemed to work.    The partners took in with them Paul Moody of Amesbury, an expert  machinist, and by the autumn of 1814 looms were built and set up at  Waltham. Carding, drawing, and roving machines were also built and  installed in the mill, these machines gaining greatly, at Moody's expert  hands, over their American rivals. This was the first mill in the United  States, and one of the first in the world, to combine under one roof all  the operations necessary to convert raw fiber into cloth, and it proved  a success. Lowell, says his partner Appleton, \"is entitled to the credit  for having introduced the new system in the cotton manufacture.\"  Jackson and Moody \"were men of unsurpassed talent,\" but Lowell \"was the  informing soul, which gave direction and form to the whole proceeding.\"    The new enterprise was needed, for the War of 1812 had cut off imports.  The beginnings of the protective principle in the United States tariff  are now to be observed. When the peace came and Great Britain began to  dump goods in the United States, Congress, in 1816, laid a minimum duty  of six and a quarter cents a yard on imported cottons; the rate was  raised in 1824 and again in 1828. It is said that Lowell was influential  in winning the support of John C. Calhoun for the impost of 1816.    Lowell died in 1817, at the early age of forty-two, but his work did  not die with him. The mills he had founded at Waltham grew exceedingly  prosperous under the management of Jackson; and it was not long  before Jackson and his partners Appleton and Moody were seeking wider  opportunities. By 1820 they were looking for a suitable site on which  to build new mills, and their attention was directed to the Pawtucket  Falls, on the Merrimac River. The land about this great water power was  owned by the Pawtucket Canal Company, whose canal, built to improve the  navigation of the Merrimac, was not paying satisfactory profits. The  partners proceeded to acquire the stock of this company and with it the  land necessary for their purpose, and in December, 1821, they executed  Articles of Association for the Merrimac Manufacturing Company,  admitting some additional partners, among them Kirk Boott who was to act  as resident agent and manager of the new enterprise, since Jackson could  not leave his duties at Waltham.    The story of the enterprise thus begun forms one of the brightest pages  in the industrial history of America; for these partners had the wisdom  and foresight to make provision at the outset for the comfort and  well-being of their operatives. Their mill hands were to be chiefly  girls drawn from the rural population of New England, strong and  intelligent young women, of whom there were at that time great numbers  seeking employment, since household manufactures had come to be largely  superseded by factory goods. And one of the first questions which the  partners considered was whether the change from farm to factory life  would effect for the worse the character of these girls. This, says  Appleton, \"was a matter of deep interest. The operatives in the  manufacturing cities of Europe were notoriously of the lowest character  for intelligence and morals. The question therefore arose, and was  deeply considered, whether this degradation was the result of the  peculiar occupation or of other and distinct causes. We could not  perceive why this peculiar description of labor should vary in its  effects upon character from all other occupations.\" And so we find the  partners voting money, not only for factory buildings and machinery, but  for comfortable boardinghouses for the girls, and planning that these  boardinghouses should have \"the most efficient guards,\" that they should  be in \"charge of respectable women, with every provision for religious  worship.\" They voted nine thousand dollars for a church building and  further sums later for a library and a hospital.    The wheels of the first mill were started in September, 1823. Next  year the partners petitioned the Legislature to have their part of the  township set off to form a new town. One year later still they erected  three new mills; and in another year (1826) the town of Lowell was  incorporated.    The year 1829 found the Lowell mills in straits for lack of capital,  from which, however, they were promptly relieved by two great merchants  of Boston, Amos and Abbott Lawrence, who now became partners in the  business and who afterwards founded the city named for them farther down  on the Merrimac River.    The story of the Lowell cotton factories, for twenty years, more  or less, until the American girls operating the machines came to be  supplanted by French Canadians and Irish, is appropriately summed up in  the title of a book which describes the factory life in Lowell during  those years. The title of this book is \"An Idyl of Work\" and it was  written by Lucy Larcom, who was herself one of the operatives and whose  mother kept one of the corporation boarding-houses. And Lucy Larcom was  not the only one of the Lowell \"factory girls\" who took to writing and  lecturing. There were many others, notably, Harriet Hanson (later Mrs.  W. S. Robinson), Harriot Curtis (\"Mina Myrtle\"), and Harriet Farley;  and many of the \"factory girls\" married men who became prominent in the  world. There was no thought among them that there was anything degrading  in factory work. Most of the girls came from the surrounding farms, to  earn money for a trousseau, to send a brother through college, to raise  a mortgage, or to enjoy the society of their fellow workers, and have a  good time in a quiet, serious way, discussing the sermons and lectures  they heard and the books they read in their leisure hours. They had  numerous \"improvement circles\" at which contributions of the members in  both prose and verse were read and discussed. And for several years they  printed a magazine, \"The Lowell Offering\", which was entirely written  and edited by girls in the mills.    Charles Dickens visited Lowell in the winter of 1842 and recorded his  impressions of what he saw there in the fourth chapter of his \"American  Notes\". He says that he went over several of the factories, \"examined  them in every part; and saw them in their ordinary working aspect, with  no preparation of any kind, or departure from their ordinary every-day  proceedings\"; that the girls \"were all well dressed: and that phrase  necessarily includes extreme cleanliness. They had serviceable bonnets,  good warm cloaks, and shawls.... Moreover, there were places in the mill  in which they could deposit these things without injury; and there were  conveniences for washing. They were healthy in appearance, many of them  remarkably so, and had the manners and deportment of young women; not of  degraded brutes of burden.\" Dickens continues: \"The rooms in which they  worked were as well ordered as themselves. In the windows of some there  were green plants, which were trained to shade the glass; in all, there  was as much fresh air, cleanliness, and comfort as the nature of the  occupation would possibly admit of.\" Again: \"They reside in various  boarding-houses near at hand. The owners of the mills are particularly  careful to allow no persons to enter upon the possession of these  houses, whose characters have not undergone the most searching and  thorough enquiry.\" Finally, the author announces that he will state  three facts which he thinks will startle his English readers: \"Firstly,  there is a joint-stock piano in a great many of the boarding-houses.  Secondly, nearly all these young ladies subscribe to circulating  libraries. Thirdly, they have got up among themselves a periodical  called 'The Lowell Offering'... whereof I brought away from Lowell four  hundred good solid pages, which I have read from beginning to end.\" And:  \"Of the merits of the 'Lowell Offering' as a literary production, I will  only observe, putting entirely out of sight the fact of the articles  having been written by these girls after the arduous labors of the day,  that it will compare advantageously with a great many English Annuals.\"    The efficiency of the New England mills was extraordinary. James  Montgomery, an English cotton manufacturer, visited the Lowell mills two  years before Dickens and wrote after his inspection of them that they  produced \"a greater quantity of yarn and cloth from each spindle and  loom (in a given time) than was produced by any other factories, without  exception in the world.\" Long before that time, of course, the basic  type of loom had changed from that originally introduced, and many  New England inventors had been busy devising improved"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29031"],[0,"Sir William Herschel: His Life and Works (#12)"],[1,"gnifiers, he is quite over any irritation,  and treats the subject almost with playfulness:        \"Soon after my first essay of using high powers with the Newtonian      telescope, I began to doubt whether an opinion which has been      entertained by several eminent authors, 'that vision will grow      indistinct when the optic pencils are less than the fiftieth part of      an inch,' would hold good in all cases. I perceived that according      to this criterion I was not entitled to see distinctly with a power      of much more than about 320 in a seven-foot telescope of an aperture      of six and four-tenths inches, whereas in many experiments I found      myself very well pleased with magnifiers which far exceeded such      narrow limits. This induced me, as it were, by way of apology to      myself for seeing well where I ought to have seen less distinctly,      to make a few experiments.\"    It is needless to say that these experiments proved that from the point  of view taken by HERSCHEL, he was quite right, and that his high powers  had numerous valuable applications. He goes on to say:        \"Had it not been for a late conversation with some of my highly      esteemed and learned friends, I might probably have left the papers      on which these experiments were recorded, among the rest of those      that are laid aside, when they have afforded me the information I      want.\"    The last sentence seems to be a kind of notice to his learned friends  that there is yet more unsaid. As a warning to those to whose criticisms  he had replied, he gives them this picture of the kind of assiduity  which will be required, if some of his observations on double stars are  to be repeated:        \"It is in vain to look for these stars if every circumstance is not      favorable. The observer as well as the instrument must have been      long enough out in the open air to acquire the same temperature. In      very cold weather an hour at least will be required.\" (1782.)    We may gain some further insight into his character from the following  chance extracts from his writings:        \"I have all along had truth and reality in view as the sole object      of my endeavors.\" (1782.)        \"Not being satisfied when I thought it possible to obtain more      accurate measures, I employed [a more delicate apparatus].\" (1783.)        \"To this end I have already begun a series of observations upon      several zones of double stars, and should the result of them be      against these conjectures, I shall be the first to point out their      fallacy.\" (1783.)        \"There is a great probability of succeeding still farther in this      laborious but delightful research, so as to be able at last to say      not only how much the annual parallax _is not_, but how much it      really _is_.\" (1782.)    The nature of his philosophizing, and the limits which he set to  himself, may be more clearly seen in further extracts:        \"By taking more time [before printing these observations] I should      undoubtedly be enabled to speak more confidently of the _interior_      _construction of the heavens_, and of its various _nebulous_ and      sidereal strata. As an apology for this prematurity it may be said      that, the end of all discoveries being communication, we can never      be too ready in giving facts and observations, whatever we may be in      reasoning upon them.\" (1785.)        \"In an investigation of this delicate nature we ought to avoid two      opposite extremes. If we indulge a fanciful imagination, and build      worlds of our own, we must not wonder at our going wide from the      path of truth and nature. On the other hand, if we add observation      to observation without attempting to draw not only certain      conclusions but also conjectural views from them, we offend against      the very end for which only observations ought to be made. I will      endeavor to keep a proper medium, but if I should deviate from that,      I could wish not to fall into the latter error.\" (1785.)        \"As observations carefully made should always take the lead of      theories, I shall not be concerned if what I have to say contradicts      what has been said in my last paper on this subject.\" (1790.)    No course of reasoning could be more simple, more exact, more profound,  and more beautiful than this which follows:        \"As it has been shown that the spherical figure of a cluster is      owing to the action of central powers, it follows that those      clusters which, _caeteris paribus_, are the most complete in this      figure, must have been the longest exposed to the action of these      causes. Thus the maturity of a sidereal system may be judged from      the disposition of the component parts.        \"Hence planetary nebulae may be looked on as very aged. Though we      cannot see any individual nebula pass through all its stages of      life, we can select particular ones in each peculiar stage.\" (1789.)    There is something almost grandiose and majestic in his statement of  the ultimate destiny of the Galaxy:                      \"To him the fates were known               Of orbs dim hovering on the skirts of space.\"        \"--Since the stars of the Milky Way are permanently exposed to the      action of a power whereby they are irresistibly drawn into groups,      we may be certain that from mere clustering stars they will be      gradually compressed, through successive stages of accumulation,      till they come up to what may be called the ripening period of the      globular form, and total insulation; from which it is evident that      the Milky Way must be finally broken up and cease to be a stratum of      scattered stars.        \"The state into which the incessant action of the clustering power      has brought it at present, is a kind of chronometer that may be used      to measure the time of its past and future existence; and although      we do not know the rate of going of this mysterious chronometer, it      is nevertheless certain that since the breaking up of the Milky Way      affords a proof that it cannot last forever, it equally bears      witness that its past duration cannot be admitted to be infinite.\"      (1814.)    HERSCHEL'S relations with his cotemporaries were usually of the most  pleasant character, though seldom intimate. This peace was broken but by  one unpleasant occurrence. In the _Philosophical Transactions_ for 1792,  SCHROETER had communicated a series of observations made with one of  HERSCHEL'S own telescopes on the atmospheres of _Venus_, the Moon, etc.  It was not only an account of phenomena which had been seen; it was  accompanied by measures, and the computations based on these led to  heights and dimensions for mountains on _Venus_ which were, to say the  least, extravagant. The adjective will not seem too strong when we say  that the very existence of the mountains themselves is to-day more than  doubtful.    The appearances seen by SCHROETER were described by him in perfectly  good faith, and similar ones have been since recorded. His reasoning  upon them was defective, and the measures which he made were practically  valueless. This paper, printed in the _Transactions_ of the Royal  Society, to which SCHROETER had not before contributed, appears to have  irritated HERSCHEL.    No doubt there were not wanting members of his own society who hinted  that on the Continent, too, there were to be found great observers, and  that here, at least, HERSCHEL had been anticipated even in his own  field. I have always thought that the memoir of HERSCHEL which appeared  in the next volume of the _Transactions_ (1793), _Observations on the  Planet Venus_, was a rejoinder intended far more for the detractors at  home than for the astronomer abroad. The review is conceived in a severe  spirit. The first idea seems to be to crush an opposition which he  feels. The truth is established, but its establishment is hardly the  _first_ object.    It seems as if HERSCHEL had almost allowed himself to be forced into a  position of arrogance, which his whole life shows was entirely foreign  to his nature. All through the review he does not once mention  SCHROETER'S name. He says:        \"A series of observations on _Venus_, begun by me in April, 1777,      has been continued down to the present time. . . . The result of my      observations would have been communicated long ago if I had not      flattered myself with the hope of some better success concerning the      diurnal motion of _Venus_, which has still eluded my constant      attention as far as concerns its period and direction. . . . Even at      this present time I should hesitate to give the following extracts      if it did not seem incumbent on me to examine by what accident I      came to overlook mountains in this planet of such enormous height as      to exceed four, five, or even six times the perpendicular height of      Chimboraco, the highest of our mountains. . . . The same paper contains      other particulars concerning _Venus_ and _Saturn_. All of which      being things of which I have never taken any notice, it will not be      amiss to show, by what follows, that neither want of attention, nor      a deficiency of instruments, would occasion my not perceiving these      mountains of more than twenty-three miles in height, this jagged      border of _Venus_, and these flat, spherical forms on _Saturn_.\"    The reply of SCHROETER (1795) is temperate and just. It does him honor,  and he generously gives full justice to his critic.    It would hardly be worth while to mention this slight incident if it  were not that during these years there certainly existed a feeling  that HERSCHEL undervalued the labors of his cotemporaries.    This impression was fostered no doubt by his general habit of not  quoting previous authorities in the fields which he was working.    A careful reading of his papers will, I"]]]
