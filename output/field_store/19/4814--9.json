Satellite link - a radio connection between a satellite and an earth  station permitting communication between them, either one-way (down  link from satellite to earth station - television receive-only  transmission) or two-way (telephone channels).    SHF - super high frequency; any radio frequency in the 3,000- to  30,000-MHz range.    Shortwave - radio frequencies (from 1.605 to 30 MHz) that fall above  the commercial broadcast band and are used for communication over long  distances.    Solidaridad - geosynchronous satellites in Mexico's system of  international telecommunications in the Western Hemisphere.    Statsionar - Russia's geostationary system for satellite  telecommunications.    Submarine cable - a cable designed for service under water.    TAT - Trans-Atlantic Telephone; any of a number of high-capacity  submarine coaxial telephone cables linking Europe with North America.    Telefax - facsimile service between subscriber stations via the public  switched telephone network or the international Datel network.    Telegraph - a telecommunications system designed for unmodulated  electric impulse transmission.    Telex - a communication service involving teletypewriters connected by  wire through automatic exchanges.    Tropospheric scatter - a form of microwave radio transmission in which  the troposphere is used to scatter and reflect a fraction of the  incident radio waves back to earth; powerful, highly directional  antennas are used to transmit and receive the microwave signals;  reliable over-the-horizon communications are realized for distances up  to 600 miles in a single hop; additional hops can extend the range of  this system for very long distances.    Trunk network - a network of switching centers, connected by  multichannel trunk lines.    UHF - ultra high frequency; any radio frequency in the 300- to 3,000-  MHz range.    VHF - very high frequency; any radio frequency in the 30- to 300-MHz  range.      Telephones - main lines in use:  This entry gives the total number of  main telephone lines in use.    Telephones - mobile cellular:  This entry gives the total number of  mobile cellular telephone subscribers.    Television broadcast stations:  This entry gives the total number of  separate broadcast stations plus any repeater stations.    Terminology:  Due to the highly structured nature of the Factbook  database, some collective generic terms have to be used. For example,  the word Country in the Country name entry refers to a wide variety of  dependencies, areas of special sovereignty, uninhabited islands, and  other entities in addition to the traditional countries or independent  states. Military is also used as an umbrella term for various civil  defense, security, and defense activities in many entries. The  Independence entry includes the usual colonial independence dates and  former ruling states as well as other significant nationhood dates such  as the traditional founding date or the date of unification,  federation, confederation, establishment, or state succession that are  not strictly independence dates. Dependent areas have the nature of  their dependency status noted in this same entry.    Terrain:  This entry contains a brief description of the topography.    Time Difference:  This entry is expressed in The World Factbook in two  ways. First, it is stated as the difference in hours between the  capital of an entity and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) during  Standard Time. Additionally, the difference in time between the capital  of an entity and that observed in Washington, D.C. is also provided.  Note that the time difference assumes both locations are simultaneously  observing Standard Time or Daylight Saving Time.    Time zones:  Ten countries (Australia, Brazil, Canada, Indonesia,  Kazakhstan, Mexico, New Zealand, Russia, Spain, and the United States)  and the island of Greenland observe more than one official time  depending on the number of designated time zones within their  boundaries. An illustration of time zones throughout the world and  within countries can be seen in the Standard Time Zones of the World  map included in the Reference Maps section of The World Factbook.    Total fertility rate:  This entry gives a figure for the average number  of children that would be born per woman if all women lived to the end  of their childbearing years and bore children according to a given  fertility rate at each age. The total fertility rate (TFR) is a more  direct measure of the level of fertility than the crude birth rate,  since it refers to births per woman. This indicator shows the potential  for population change in the country. A rate of two children per woman  is considered the replacement rate for a population, resulting in  relative stability in terms of total numbers. Rates above two children  indicate populations growing in size and whose median age is declining.  Higher rates may also indicate difficulties for families, in some  situations, to feed and educate their children and for women to enter  the labor force. Rates below two children indicate populations  decreasing in size and growing older. Global fertility rates are in  general decline and this trend is most pronounced in industrialized  countries, especially Western Europe, where populations are projected  to decline dramatically over the next 50 years.    Trafficking in persons:  Trafficking in persons is modern-day slavery,  involving victims who are forced, defrauded, or coerced into labor or  sexual exploitation. The International Labor Organization (ILO), the UN  agency charged with addressing labor standards, employment, and social  protection issues, estimates that 12.3 million people worldwide are  enslaved in forced labor, bonded labor, forced child labor, sexual  servitude, and involuntary servitude at any given time. Human  trafficking is a multi-dimensional threat, depriving people of their  human rights and freedoms, risking global health, promoting social  breakdown, inhibiting development by depriving countries of their human  capital, and helping fuel the growth of organized crime. In 2000, the  US Congress passed the Trafficking Victims Protection Act (TVPA),  reauthorized in 2003 and 2005, which provides tools for the US to  combat trafficking in persons, both domestically and abroad. One of the  law's key components is the creation of the US Department of State's  annual Trafficking in Persons Report, which assesses the government  response in some 150 countries with a significant number of victims  trafficked across their borders who are recruited, harbored,  transported, provided, or obtained for forced labor or sexual  exploitation. Countries in the annual report are rated in three tiers,  based on government efforts to combat trafficking. The countries  identified in this entry are those listed in the 2006 Trafficking in  Persons Report as Tier 2 Watch List or Tier 3 based on the following  definitions:    Tier 2 Watch List countries do not fully comply with the minimum  standards for the elimination of trafficking but are making significant  efforts to do so, and meet one of the following criteria:    1. they display a high or significantly increasing number victims,    2. they have failed to provide evidence of increasing efforts to combat  trafficking in persons, or,    3. they have committed to take action over the next year.    Tier 3 countries neither satisfy the minimum standards for the  elimination of trafficking nor demonstrate a significant effort to do  so. Countries in this tier are subject to potential non-humanitarian  and non-trade sanctions.    Transnational issues:  This category includes four entries - Disputes -  international, Refugees and internally displaced persons, Trafficking  in persons, and Illicit drugs - that deal with current issues going  beyond national boundaries.    Transportation:  This category includes the entries dealing with the  means for movement of people and goods.    Transportation - note:  This entry includes miscellaneous  transportation information of significance not included elsewhere.    UTC (Coordinated Universal Time):  See entry for Coordinated Universal  Time.    Unemployment rate:  This entry contains the percent of the labor force  that is without jobs. Substantial underemployment might be noted.    Waterways:  This entry gives the total length of navigable rivers,  canals, and other inland bodies of water.    Weights and Measures:  This information is presented in Appendix G:  Weights and Measures and includes mathematical notations (mathematical  powers and names), metric interrelationships (prefix; symbol; length,  weight, or capacity; area; volume), and standard conversion factors.    Years:  All year references are for the calendar year (CY) unless  indicated as fiscal year (FY). The calendar year is an accounting  period of 12 months from 1 January to 31 December. The fiscal year is  an accounting period of 12 months other than 1 January to 31 December.

The tower was now disused and partly dilapidated, but many wonderful  tales existed among the neighboring habitans of a secret passage that  communicated with the vaults of the Chateau; but no one had ever seen  the passage--still less been bold enough to explore it had they found  it, for it was guarded by a loup-garou that was the terror of children,  old and young, as they crowded close together round the blazing fire  on winter nights, and repeated old legends of Brittany and Normandy,  altered to fit the wild scenes of the New World.    Colonel Philibert and Master Pothier rode up the broad avenue that led  to the Chateau, and halted at the main gate--set in a lofty hedge  of evergreens cut into fantastic shapes, after the fashion of the  Luxembourg. Within the gate a vast and glowing garden was seen--all  squares, circles, and polygons. The beds were laden with flowers  shedding delicious odors on the morning air as it floated by, while the  ear was soothed by the hum of bees and the songs of birds revelling in  the bright sunshine.    Above the hedge appeared the tops of heavily-laden fruit-trees brought  from France and planted by Talon--cherries red as the lips of Breton  maidens, plums of Gascony, Norman apples, with pears from the glorious  valleys of the Rhone. The bending branches were just transmuting their  green unripeness into scarlet, gold, and purple--the imperial colors of  Nature when crowned for the festival of autumn.    A lofty dove-cote, surmounted by a glittering vane, turning and flashing  with every shift of the wind, stood near the Chateau. It was the home of  a whole colony of snow-white pigeons, which fluttered in and out of it,  wheeled in circles round the tall chimney-stacks, or strutted, cooing  and bowing together, on the high roof of the Chateau, a picture of  innocence and happiness.    But neither happiness nor innocence was suggested by the look of the  Chateau itself, as it stood bathed in bright sunshine. Its great doors  were close-shut in the face of all the beauty of the world without.  Its mullioned windows, that should have stood wide open to let in the  radiance and freshness of morning, were closely blinded, like eyes  wickedly shut against God's light that beat upon them, vainly seeking  entrance.    Outside all was still: the song of birds and the rustle of leaves alone  met the ear. Neither man nor beast was stirring to challenge Colonel  Philibert's approach, but long ere he reached the door of the Chateau,  a din of voices within, a wild medley of shouts, song, and laughter,  a clatter of wine-cups, and pealing notes of violins struck him with  amazement and disgust. He distinguished drunken voices singing snatches  of bacchanalian songs, while now and then stentorian mouths called for  fresh brimmers, and new toasts were drunk with uproarious applause.    The Chateau seemed a very pandemonium of riot and revelry, that  prolonged the night into the day, and defied the very order of nature by  its audacious disregard of all decency of time, place, and circumstance.    \"In God's name, what means all this, Master Pothier?\" exclaimed  Philibert, as they hastily dismounted and, tying their horses to a tree,  entered the broad walk that led to the terrace.    \"That concert going on, your Honor?\"--Master Pothier shook his head  to express disapproval, and smiled to express his inborn sympathy with  feasting and good-fellowship--\"that, your Honor, is the heel of the  hunt, the hanging up of the antlers of the stag by the gay chasseurs who  are visiting the Intendant!\"    \"A hunting party, you mean? To think that men could stand such  brutishness, even to please the Intendant!\"    \"Stand! your Honor. I wager my gown that most of the chasseurs are lying  under the table by this time, although by the noise they make it must be  allowed there are some burly fellows upon their legs yet, who keep the  wine flowing like the cow of Montmorency.\"    \"'Tis horrible! 'tis damnable!\" Philibert grew pale with passion  and struck his thigh with his palm, as was his wont when very angry.  \"Rioting in drunkenness when the Colony demands the cool head, the  strong arm, and the true heart of every man among us! Oh, my country! my  dear country! what fate is thine to expect when men like these are thy  rulers?\"    \"Your Honor must be a stranger in New France or you would not express  such hasty, honest sentiments upon the Intendant's hospitality. It is  not the fashion, except among plain-spoken habitans, who always  talk downright Norman.\" Master Pothier looked approvingly at Colonel  Philibert, who, listening with indignant ears, scarcely heeded his  guide.    \"That is a jolly song, your Honor,\" continued Pothier, waving one hand  in cadence to a ditty in praise of wine, which a loud voice was heard  singing in the Chateau, accompanied by a rousing chorus which startled  the very pigeons on the roof and chimney-stacks. Colonel Philibert  recognized the song as one he had heard in the Quartier Latin, during  his student life in Paris--he fancied he recognized the voice also:           \"'Pour des vins de prix         Vendons tous nos livres!         C'est pen d'etre gris,         Amis, soyons ivres!                      Bon.         La Faridondaine!                      Gai.         La Faridonde!'\"      A roar of voices and a clash of glasses followed the refrain. Master  Pothier's eyes winked and blinked in sympathy. The old notary stood  on tiptoe, with outspread palms, as with ore rotundo he threw in a few  notes of his own to fill up the chorus.    Philibert cast upon his guide a look of scorn, biting his lip angrily.  \"Go,\" said he, \"knock at the door--it needs God's thunder to break in  upon that infamous orgie. Say that Colonel Philibert brings orders from  His Excellency the Governor to the Chevalier Intendant.\"    \"And be served with a writ of ejectment! Pardon me! Be not angry, sir,\"  pleaded Pothier supplicatingly, \"I dare not knock at the door when they  are at the devil's mass inside. The valets! I know them all! They would  duck me in the brook, or drag me into the hall to make sport for the  Philistines. And I am not much of a Samson, your Honor. I could not pull  the Chateau down upon their heads--I wish I could!\"    Master Pothier's fears did not appear ill-grounded to Philibert as a  fresh burst of drunken uproar assailed his ears. \"Wait my return,\" said  he, \"I will knock on the door myself.\" He left his guide, ran up the  broad stone steps, and knocked loudly upon the door again and again! He  tried it at last, and to his surprise found it unlatched; he pushed it  open, no servitor appearing to admit him. Colonel Philibert went boldly  in. A blaze of light almost dazzled his eyes. The Chateau was lit up  with lamps and candelabra in every part. The bright rays of the sun beat  in vain for admittance upon the closed doors and blinded windows,  but the splendor of midnight oil pervaded the interior of the stately  mansion, making an artificial night that prolonged the wild orgies of  the Intendant into the hours of day.        CHAPTER VII. THE INTENDANT BIGOT.      The Chateau of Beaumanoir had, since the advent of the Intendant Bigot,  been the scene of many a festive revelry that matched, in bacchanalian  frenzy, the wild orgies of the Regency and the present debaucheries  of Croisy and the petits appartements of Versailles. Its splendor, its  luxury, its riotous feasts lasting without intermission sometimes for  days, were the themes of wonder and disgust to the unsophisticated  people of New France, and of endless comparison between the extravagance  of the Royal Intendant and the simple manners and inflexible morals of  the Governor-General.    The great hall of the Chateau, the scene of the gorgeous feasts of the  Intendant, was brilliantly illuminated with silver lamps, glowing like  globes of sunlight as they hung from the lofty ceiling, upon which  was painted a fresco of the apotheosis of Louis XIV., where the Grand  Monarque was surrounded by a cloud of Condes, Orleanois, and Bourbons,  of near and more remote consanguinity. At the head of the room hung a  full-length portrait of Marquise de Pompadour, the mistress of Louis  XV., and the friend and patroness of the Intendant Bigot; her bold,  voluptuous beauty seemed well fitted to be the presiding genius of his  house. The walls bore many other paintings of artistic and historic  value. The King and Queen; the dark-eyed Montespan; the crafty  Maintenon; and the pensive beauty of Louise de la Valliere, the only  mistress of Louis XIV. who loved him for his own sake, and whose  portrait, copied from this picture, may still be seen in the chapel of  the Ursulines of Quebec, where the fair Louise is represented as St.  Thais kneeling at prayer among the nuns.    The table in the great hall, a masterpiece of workmanship, was made of  a dark Canadian wood then newly introduced, and stretched the length of  the hall. A massive gold epergne of choicest Italian art, the gift of  La Pompadour, stood on the centre of the table. It represented Bacchus  enthroned on a tun of wine, presenting flowing cups to a dance of fauns  and satyrs.    Silver cups of Venetian sculpture and goblets of Bohemian manufacture  sparkled like stars upon the brilliant table, brimming over with the  gold and ruby vintages of France and Spain; or lay overturned amid pools  of wine that ran down upon the velvet carpet. Dishes of Parmesan cheese,  caviare, and other provocatives to thirst stood upon the table, amid  vases of flowers and baskets of the choicest fruits of the Antilles.    Round this magnificent table sat a score or more of revellers--in the  garb of gentlemen, but all in disorder and soiled with wine; their  countenances were inflamed, their eyes red and fiery, their tongues  loose and loquacious. Here and there a vacant or overturned chair showed  where a guest had fallen in"]]]
