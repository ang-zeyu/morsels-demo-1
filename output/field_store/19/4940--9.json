A cork or sorghum-pith partition would not fulfil the same  purpose: the insect would perforate it and the register of births would  be muddled by changes of position. Any reader wishing to undertake  similar investigations will excuse these practical details, which may  facilitate his work.    We do not often come upon complete series, comprising the whole laying,  from the first-born to the youngest. As a rule, we find part of a  laying, in which the number of cocoons varies greatly, sometimes falling  as low as two, or even one. The mother has not deemed it advisable to  confide her whole family to a single bramble-stump; in order to make the  exit less toilsome, or else for reasons which escape me, she has left  the first home and elected to make a second home, perhaps a third or  more.    We also find series with breaks in them. Sometimes, in cells distributed  at random, the egg has not developed and the provisions have remained  untouched, but mildewed; sometimes, the larva has died before spinning  its cocoon, or after spinning it. Lastly, there are parasites, such  as the Unarmed Zonitis (Zonitis mutica, one of the  Oil-beetles.--Translator's Note.) and the Spotted Sapyga (A  Digger-wasp.--Translator's Note.), who interrupt the series by  substituting themselves for the original occupant. All these disturbing  factors make it necessary to examine a large number of nests of the  Three-pronged Osmia, if we would obtain a definite result.    I have been studying the bramble-dwellers for seven or eight years and I  could not say how many strings of cocoons have passed through my hands.  During a recent winter, in view particularly of the distribution of the  sexes, I collected some forty of this Osmia's nests, transferred their  contents into glass tubes and made a careful summary of the sexes.  I give some of my results. The figures start in their order from the  bottom of the tunnel dug in the bramble and proceed upwards to the  orifice. The figure 1 therefore denotes the first-born of the series,  the oldest in date; the highest figure denotes the last-born. The letter  M, placed under the corresponding figure, represents the male and the  letter F the female sex.    1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 F F M F M F M M F F F F M F M    This is the longest series that I have ever been able to procure. It is  also complete, inasmuch as it comprises the entire laying of the Osmia.  My statement requires explaining, otherwise it would seem impossible to  know whether a mother whose acts one has not watched, nay more, whom  one has never seen, has or has not finished laying her eggs. The  bramble-stump under consideration leaves a free space of nearly four  inches above the continuous string of cocoons. Beyond it, at the actual  orifice, is the terminal stopper, the thick plug which closes the  entrance to the gallery. In this empty portion of the tunnel there is  ample accommodation for numerous cocoons. The fact that the mother has  not made use of it proves that her ovaries were exhausted; for it is  exceedingly unlikely that she has abandoned first-rate lodgings to  go laboriously digging a new gallery elsewhere and there continue her  laying.    You may say that, if the unoccupied space marks the end of the laying,  nothing tells us that the beginning is actually at the bottom of the  cul-de-sac, at the other end of the tunnel. You may also say that the  laying is done in shifts, separated by intervals of rest. The space left  empty in the channel would mean that one of these shifts was finished  and not that there were no more eggs ripe for hatching. In answer  to these very plausible explanations, I will say that, the sum of my  observations--and they have been extremely numerous--is that the total  number of eggs laid not only by the Osmiae but by a host of other Bees  fluctuates round about fifteen.    Besides, when we consider that the active life of these insects lasts  hardly a month; when we remember that this period of activity is  disturbed by dark, rainy or very windy days, during which all work is  suspended; when lastly we ascertain, as I have done ad nauseam in the  case of the Three-horned Osmia, the time required for building and  victualling a cell, it becomes obvious that the total laying must be  kept within narrow bounds and that the mother has no time to lose if she  wishes to get fifteen cells satisfactorily built in three or four weeks  interrupted by compulsory rests. I shall give some facts later which  will dispel your doubts, if any remain.    I assume, therefore, that a number of eggs bordering on fifteen  represents the entire family of an Osmia, as it does of many other Bees.    Let us consult some other complete series. Here are two:    1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 F F M F M F M F F F F M F F M F F F M F F  M F M    In both cases, the laying is taken as complete, for the same reasons as  above.    We will end with some series that appear to me incomplete, in view of  the small number of cells and the absence of any free space above the  pile of cocoons:    1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 M M F M M M M M M M F M F M M M F M F F M M M M M F M F  F F F M M M F M    These examples are more than sufficient. It is quite evident that the  distribution of the sexes is not governed by any rule. All that I can  say on consulting the whole of my notes, which contain a good many  instances of complete layings--most of them, unfortunately, spoilt  through gaps caused by parasites, the death of the larva, the failure of  the egg to hatch and other accidents--all that I can say in general is  that the complete series begins with females and nearly always ends with  males. The incomplete series can teach us nothing in this respect,  for they are only fragments starting we know not whence; and it is  impossible to tell whether they should be ascribed to the beginning, to  the end, or to an intermediate period of the laying. To sum up: in the  laying of the Three-pronged Osmia, no order governs the succession of  the sexes; only, the series has a marked tendency to begin with females  and to finish with males.    The brambles, in my district, harbour two other Osmiae, both of much  smaller size: O. detrita, PEREZ, and O. parvula, DUF. The first is very  common, the second very rare; and until now I have found only one of  her nests, placed above a nest of O. detrita, in the same bramble. Here,  instead of the lack of order in the distribution of the sexes which we  find with O. tridentata, we have an order remarkable for consistency  and simplicity. I have before me the list of the series of O. detrita  collected last winter. Here are some of them:    1. A series of twelve: seven females, beginning with the bottom of the  tunnel, and then five males.    2. A series of nine: three females first, then six males.    3. A series of eight: five females followed by three males.    4. A series of eight: seven females followed by one male.    5. A series of eight: one female followed by seven males.    6. A series of seven: six females followed by one male.    The first series might very well be complete. The second and fifth  appear to be the end of layings, of which the beginning has taken place  elsewhere, in another bramble-stump. The males predominate and finish  off the series. Nos. 3, 4 and 6, on the other hand, look like the  beginnings of layings: the females predominate and are at the head of  the series. Even if these interpretations should be open to doubt, one  result at least is certain: with O. detrita, the laying is divided into  two groups, with no intermingling of the sexes; the first group laid  yields nothing but females, the second, or more recent, yields nothing  but males.    What was only a sort of attempt with the Three-pronged Osmia--who, it is  true, begins with females and ends with males, but muddles up the order  and mixes the two sexes anyhow between the extreme points--becomes a  regular law with her kinswoman. The mother occupies herself at the start  with the stronger sex, the more necessary, the better-gifted, the female  sex, to which she devotes the first flush of her laying and the fullness  of her vigour; later, when she is perhaps already at the end of her  strength, she bestows what remains of her maternal solicitude upon the  weaker sex, the less-gifted, almost negligible male sex.    O. parvula, of whom I unfortunately possess but one series, repeats  what the previous witness has just shown us. This series, one of nine  cocoons, comprises five females followed by four males, without any  mixing of the sexes.    Next to these disgorgers of honey and gleaners of pollen-dust, it would  be well to consult other Hymenoptera, Wasps who devote themselves to the  chase and pile their cells one after the other, in a row, showing  the relative age of the cocoons. The brambles house several of these:  Solenius vagus, who stores up Flies; Psen atratus, who provides her  grubs with a heap of Plant-lice; Trypoxylon figulus, who feeds them with  Spiders.    Solenius vagus digs her gallery in a bramble-stick that is lopped short,  but still fresh and green. The house of this Fly-huntress, therefore,  suffers from damp, as the sap enters, especially on the lower floors.  This seems to me rather insanitary. To avoid the humidity, or for other  reasons which escape me, the Solenius does not dig very far into her  bramble-stump and consequently can stack but a small number of cells in  it. A series of five cocoons gives me first four females and then one  male; another series, also of five, contains first three females, with  two males following. These are the most complete that I have for the  moment.    I reckoned on the Black Psen, or Psen atratus, whose series are pretty  long; it is a pity that they are nearly always greatly interfered with  by a parasite"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34211"],[0,"A Treatise on Physiology and Hygiene (#12)"],[1,"and Thirst--Amount of  Food--Renovation of the Body--Mixed  Diet--Milk--Eggs--Meat--Cooking--Vegetable Food--Bread--The  Potato--Fruits--Purity of Water--Action of Water upon Lead--Coffee, Tea,  and Chocolate--Effects of Alcohol._    [Sidenote: 1. What follow activity? Examples? Necessity for food?]    1. NECESSITY FOR FOOD.--Activity is everywhere followed by waste. The  engine uses up coal and water to produce motion, the stream wears away its  bank, the growing corn-blade draws tribute from the soil. When the human  body acts, and it is always in action during life, some of its particles  are worn out and thrown off. This waste must constantly be repaired, or the  body suffers. In this fact is seen the necessity for food. The particles,  thus worn out, being henceforth useless, are removed from the body. Our  _food_ and _drink_ are rapidly transformed into a new supply of living,  useful material, to be in turn used up and replaced by a fresher supply.    [Sidenote: 2. Give the theory in relation to waste and repair.]    2. WASTE AND REPAIR.--In this way the healthful body, though always  wasting, is always building up, and does not greatly change in size, form,  or weight. At two periods of life the processes of waste and repair are not  exactly balanced. In early life the process of building up is more active,  and in consequence the form is plump, and the stature increases. Repair now  exceeds waste. On the other hand, when old age comes on, the wasting  process is more active, the flesh and weight diminish, the skin falls in  wrinkles, and the senses become dull. Only during the prime of life--from  about twenty to sixty years of age--is the balance exact between loss and  gain. {65}    [Sidenote: 3. System deprived of food? Warning? What is the pain? How  proved?]    3. HUNGER AND THIRST.--When the system is deprived of its supply of solid  food during a longer time than usual, nature gives warning by the sensation  of hunger, to repair the losses that have taken place. This sensation or  pain appears to be located in the stomach, but it is really a distress of  the system at large. Let a sufficient quantity of nourishment be introduced  into the system in any other way than by the mouth, and it will appease  hunger just as certainly as when taken in the usual manner.    [Sidenote: 4. Feeling of thirst? Seat of the pain? How proved? Time a  person can exist without food?]    4. The feeling of thirst, in like manner, is evidence that the system is  suffering from the want of water. The apparent seat of the distress of  thirst is in the throat; but the injection of water into the blood-vessels  is found to quench thirst, and by the immersion of the body in water, the  skin will absorb sufficient to satisfy the demands of the system. The  length of time that man can exist without food or drink is estimated to be  about seven days. If water alone be supplied, life will last much longer;  there being cases recorded where men have lived twenty days and over,  without taking any solid food.    [Sidenote: 5. Amount of food required? The young and others? Those living  in hot and cold climates? Habits?]    5. QUANTITY OF FOOD.--The quantity of food required varies greatly,  according to the individual and his mode of life. The young, and others who  lead active lives, or who live in the open air, require more food than the  old, the inactive, or the sedentary. Those who live in cold regions require  more than the inhabitants of hot climates. Habit, also, has much to do with  the quantity of food required. Some habitually eat and drink more than they  actually need, while a few eat less than they should.    [Sidenote: 6. Quantity of food daily? How divided? Compare with the weight  of the body?]    6. The average daily quantity of food and drink for a healthy man of active  habits is estimated at six pounds. This amount may be divided in about the  following {66} proportions: the mineral kingdom furnishes three and  one-half pounds, including water and salt; the vegetable kingdom, one and  one-half pounds, including bread, vegetables, and fruits; the animal  kingdom, one pound, comprising meat, eggs, butter, and the like. This  quantity is about one twenty-fourth the weight of the body, as it is  generally computed; the average weight of an adult man being placed at 140  pounds. A man, therefore, consumes an amount of solid and liquid nutriment  every twenty-four days equal in weight to that of his body, a corresponding  amount being _excreted_, or removed from the system in the same time.    [Sidenote: 7. How often then might the body be renewed? Why is it not?  Opinion? How correct? What further is stated?]    7. RENOVATION OF THE BODY.--By this process, so far as weight is concerned,  the body might be renewed every twenty-four days; but these pounds of food  are not all real nutriment. A considerable portion of that which we eat is  innutritious, and though useful in various ways, is not destined to repair  the losses of the system. An opinion has prevailed that the body is renewed  throughout once in seven years; how correct this may be it is not easy to  decide, but probably the renovation of the body takes place in a much  shorter period. Some parts are very frequently renewed, the nutritive  fluids changing more or less completely, several times during the day. The  muscles, and other parts in frequent exercise, change often during a year;  the bones not so often, and the enamel of the teeth probably never changes  after being once fully formed.    [Sidenote: 8. Habits of nations? Give the different cases.]    8. MIXED DIET.--The habits of different nations in respect to diet exhibit  the widest and strangest diversity. The civilized, cook their food, while  savages often eat it in a raw state. Some prefer it when fresh, others  allow it to remain until it has become tainted with decay. Those dwelling  in the far north subsist almost wholly on {67} animal food, while those  living in hot climates have bountiful supplies of delicious fruits with  which to satisfy all their bodily wants. One race subsists upon the banana,  another upon the blubber of seals. In temperate climates, a diet composed  partly of vegetable and partly of animal food is preferred.    [Sidenote: 9. The point to consider? Vegetable diet? Louis Cornaro? John  the Baptist?]    9. The important point to consider is, however, not one of origin, but  whether the chemical principles (mentioned in the last chapter) enter into  the composition of the diet. A purely vegetable diet may be selected which  would contain all the principles necessary to sustain life. It is recorded  of Louis Cornaro, a Venetian noble, that he supported himself comfortably  for fifty-eight years on a daily allowance of twelve ounces of vegetable  food, and about a pint of light wine. On the other hand, the food of John  the Baptist, consisting of \"locusts and wild honey,\" is an example of the  sustaining power of a diet chiefly animal in its origin.    [Sidenote: 10. What has been found in our climate? Exclusive vegetable  diet?]    10. In our climate, those who lead active lives crave an allowance of  animal food; and it has been found by experience that with it they can  accomplish more work and are less subject to fatigue, than without it.  Among nations where an exclusively vegetable diet is employed, indigestion  is a disorder especially prevalent.    [Sidenote: 11. Necessity for change in diet? Continuous use of the same  diet? Exception? Why? Too rich diet? Horses?]    11. The necessity for occasionally changing or varying the diet, is seen in  the fact that no single article comprises all the necessary principles of  food, and that the continuous use of any one diet, whether salt or fresh,  is followed by defective nutrition and disease. There is one exception to  this rule: in infancy, milk alone is best calculated to support life; for  then the digestive powers are incompletely developed, and the food must be  presented in the simplest form possible. It should also be remembered {68}  that too rich diet is injurious, just as truly as one that is inadequate.  When the food of horses is too nutritious, instinct leads them to gnaw the  wood-work of their mangers.    [Sidenote: 12. Milk as a model food? Cow's milk? The constituents when  separated?]    12. DIFFERENT ARTICLES OF DIET--MILK.--Milk is the earliest nutriment of  the human race, and in the selection and arrangement of its constituents,  may be regarded as a model food, no other single article being capable of  sustaining life so long. Cow's milk holds casein, one of the albuminoids,  about five parts in one hundred; a fatty principle, when separated, known  as butter, about four parts; sugar of milk four parts; water and salts  eighty-seven parts. The casein and fatty substance are far more digestible  in milk, than after they have been separated from it in the form of cheese  and butter.    [Sidenote: 13. Milk as a beverage? Milk sold in cities? How to detect the  cheat?]    13. Since milk, in itself, is so rich an article of food, the use of it as  a beverage is unwise, unless the quantity of the other articles consumed be  reduced at the same time. The milk sold in cities is apt to be diluted with  water. The way to detect the cheat is by testing the specific gravity of  the article. Good milk is about 1030; skimmed milk 1035; but milk diluted  one-fifth is 1024. An instrument called the lactometer is also used, by  which the amount of cream present is ascertained.    [Sidenote: 14. Composition of eggs? Yolk? How should eggs be eaten? Why?  How boiled? Why?]    14. EGGS.--The egg is about two-thirds water, the balance is pure albumen  and fat in nearly equal proportions. The fat is in the yolk, and gives it  its yellow color. Eggs contain none of the sugar-principles, and should be  eaten with bread or vegetables that contain them. Soft-boiled eggs are more  wholesome than those which"]]]
