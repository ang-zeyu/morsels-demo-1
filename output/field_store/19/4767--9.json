When the time came for Mark to want to make up--as  come I knew it would--how could he do it if I were seven hundred miles  away?    Nevertheless, I went to Prince Edward Island. In all my eighteen years  I had never once disobeyed Father. He is a very hard man to disobey. I  knew I should have to make a beginning some time if I wanted to marry  Mark, so I saved all my little courage up for that and didn't waste  any of it opposing the visit to Aunt Philippa.    I couldn't understand Father's point of view. Of course, he hated old  John Fenwick, who had once sued him for libel and won the case. Father  had written an indiscreet editorial in the excitement of a red-hot  political contest--and was made to understand that there are some  things you can't say of another man even at election time. But then,  he need not have hated Mark because of that; Mark was not even born  when it happened.    Old John Fenwick was not much better pleased about Mark and me than  Father was, though he didn't go to the length of forbidding it; he  just acted grumpily and disagreeably. Things were unpleasant enough  all round without a quarrel between Mark and me; yet quarrel we  did--and over next to nothing, too, you understand. And now I had to  set out for Prince Edward Island without even seeing him, for he was  away in Toronto on business.           *       *       *       *       *    When my train reached Copely the next afternoon, Aunt Philippa was  waiting for me. There was nobody else in sight, but I would have known  her had there been a thousand. Nobody but Aunt Philippa could have  that determined mouth, those piercing grey eyes, and that pronounced,  unmistakable Goodwin nose. And certainly nobody but Aunt Philippa  would have come to meet me arrayed in a wrapper of chocolate print  with huge yellow roses scattered over it, and a striped blue-and-white  apron!    She welcomed me kindly but absent-mindedly, her thoughts evidently  being concentrated on the problem of getting my trunk home. I had only  the one, and in Montreal it had seemed to be of moderate size; but on  the platform of Copely station, sized up by Aunt Philippa's merciless  eye, it certainly looked huge.    \"I thought we could a-took it along tied on the back of the buggy,\"  she said disapprovingly, \"but I guess we'll have to leave it, and I'll  send the hired boy over for it tonight. You can get along without it  till then, I s'pose?\"    There was a fine irony in her tone. I hastened to assure her meekly  that I could, and that it did not matter if my trunk could not be  taken up till next day.    \"Oh, Jerry can come for it tonight as well as not,\" said Aunt  Philippa, as we climbed into her buggy. \"I'd a good notion to send him  to meet you, for he isn't doing much today, and I wanted to go to Mrs.  Roderick MacAllister's funeral. But my head was aching me so bad I  thought I wouldn't enjoy the funeral if I did go. My head is better  now, so I kind of wish I had gone. She was a hundred and four years  old and I'd always promised myself that I'd go to her funeral.\"    Aunt Philippa's tone was melancholy. She did not recover her good  spirits until we were out on the pretty, grassy, elm-shaded country  road, garlanded with its ribbon of buttercups. Then she suddenly  turned around and looked me over scrutinizingly.    \"You're not as good-looking as I expected from your picture, but them  photographs always flatter. That's the reason I never had any took.  You're rather thin and brown. But you've good eyes and you look  clever. Your father writ me you hadn't much sense, though. He wants me  to teach you some, but it's a thankless business. People would rather  be fools.\"    Aunt Philippa struck her steed smartly with the whip and controlled  his resultant friskiness with admirable skill.    \"Well, you know it's pleasanter,\" I said, wickedly. \"Just think what a  doleful world it would be if everybody were sensible.\"    Aunt Philippa looked at me out of the corner of her eye and disdained  any skirmish of flippant epigram.    \"So you want to get married?\" she said. \"You'd better wait till you're  grown up.\"    \"How old must a person be before she is grown up?\" I asked gravely.    \"Humph! That depends. Some are grown up when they're born, and others  ain't grown up when they're eighty. That same Mrs. Roderick I was  speaking of never grew up. She was as foolish when she was a hundred  as when she was ten.\"    \"Perhaps that's why she lived so long,\" I suggested. All thought of  seeking sympathy in Aunt Philippa had vanished. I resolved I would not  even mention Mark's name.    \"Mebbe 'twas,\" admitted Aunt Philippa with a grim smile. \"_I'd_ rather  live fifty sensible years than a hundred foolish ones.\"    Much to my relief, she made no further reference to my affairs. As we  rounded a curve in the road where two great over-arching elms met, a  buggy wheeled by us, occupied by a young man in clerical costume. He  had a pleasant boyish face, and he touched his hat courteously. Aunt  Philippa nodded very frostily and gave her horse a quite undeserved  cut.    \"There's a man you don't want to have much to do with,\" she said  portentously. \"He's a Methodist minister.\"    \"Why, Auntie, the Methodists are a very nice denomination,\" I  protested. \"My stepmother is a Methodist, you know.\"    \"No, I didn't know, but I'd believe anything of a stepmother. I've no  use for Methodists or their ministers. This fellow just came last  spring, and it's _my_ opinion he smokes. And he thinks every girl who  looks at him falls in love with him--as if a Methodist minister was  any prize! Don't you take much notice of him, Ursula.\"    \"I'll not be likely to have the chance,\" I said, with an amused smile.    \"Oh, you'll see enough of him. He boards at Mrs. John Callman's, just  across the road from us, and he's always out sunning himself on her  verandah. Never studies, of course. Last Sunday they say he preached  on the iron that floated. If he'd confine himself to the Bible and  leave sensational subjects alone it would be better for him and his  poor congregation, and so I told Mrs. John Callman to her face. I  should think _she_ would have had enough of his sex by this time. She  married John Callman against her father's will, and he had delirious  trembles for years. That's the men for you.\"    \"They're not _all_ like that, Aunt Philippa,\" I protested.    \"Most of 'em are. See that house over there? Mrs. Jane Harrison lives  there. Her husband took tantrums every few days or so and wouldn't get  out of bed. She had to do all the barn work till he'd got over his  spell. That's men for you. When he died, people writ her letters of  condolence but _I_ just sot down and writ her one of congratulation.  There's the Presbyterian manse in the hollow. Mr. Bentwell's our  minister. He's a good man and he'd be a rather nice one if he didn't  think it was his duty to be a little miserable all the time. He won't  let his wife wear a fashionable hat, and his daughter can't fix her  hair the way she wants to. Even being a minister can't prevent a man  from being a crank. Here's Ebenezer Milgrave coming. You take a good  look at him. He used to be insane for years. He believed he was dead  and used to rage at his wife because she wouldn't bury him. _I'd_  a-done it.\"    Aunt Philippa looked so determinedly grim that I could almost see her  with a spade in her hand. I laughed aloud at the picture summoned up.    \"Yes, it's funny, but I guess his poor wife didn't find it very  humorsome. He's been pretty sane for some years now, but you never can  tell when he'll break out again. He's got a brother, Albert Milgrave,  who's been married twice. They say he was courting his second wife  while his first was dying. Let that be as it may, he used his first  wife's wedding ring to marry the second. That's the men for you.\"    \"Don't you know _any_ good husbands, Aunt Philippa?\" I asked  desperately.    \"Oh, yes, lots of 'em--over there,\" said Aunt Philippa sardonically,  waving her whip in the direction of a little country graveyard on a  distant hill.    \"Yes, but _living_--walking about in the flesh?\"    \"Precious few. Now and again you'll come across a man whose wife won't  put up with any nonsense and he _has_ to be respectable. But the most  of 'em are poor bargains--poor bargains.\"    \"And are all the wives saints?\" I persisted.    \"Laws, no, but they're too good for the men,\" retorted Aunt Philippa,  as she turned in at her own gate. Her house was close to the road and  was painted such a vivid green that the landscape looked faded by  contrast. Across the gable end of it was the legend, \"Philippa's  Farm,\" emblazoned in huge black letters two feet long. All its  surroundings were very neat. On the kitchen doorstep a patchwork cat  was making a grave toilet. The groundwork of the cat was white, and  its spots were black, yellow, grey, and brown.    \"There's Joseph,\" said Aunt Philippa. \"I call him that because his  coat is of many colours. But I ain't no lover of cats. They're too  much like the men to suit me.\"    \"Cats have always been supposed to be peculiarly feminine,\" I said,  descending.    \"'Twas a man that supposed it, then,\" retorted Aunt Philippa,  beckoning to her hired boy. \"Here, Jerry, put Prince away. Jerry's a  good sort of boy,\" she confided to me as we went into the house. \"I  had Jim Spencer last summer and the only good thing about _him_ was  his appetite. I put up with him till harvest was in, and then one day  my patience give out. He upsot a churnful of cream in the back  yard--and was just as cool as a cowcumber over it--laughed and said it  was good for the land. I told him I wasn't in the habit of fertilizing  my back yard with cream. But that's the men for you. Come in. I'll  have tea ready in no time. I sot the table before I left. There's  lemon pie.

Most of the roads of  western Europe are of this character. They are laid out with easy  grades, and a thick foundation of heavy stone is covered with smaller  pieces of broken rock, the whole being finished off with a top-dressing  of fine material. Once built, the expense of keeping them in good order  is less than that of keeping a dirt road in bad order.    Most of the country highways of the United States are dirt roads that  are deep with dust in dry weather and almost impassable at the breaking  of winter. Roads of this character are such a detriment that grain  farming will not pay when the farm is distant twenty miles or more from  the nearest railway. Many a farmer pays more to haul his grain to the  nearest railway station than from the railway station to London.    Since it has become apparent that the commercial development of many  agricultural regions depends quite as much on good wagon roads as upon  railways and expensive farming machinery, there has been a disposition  to grade and rock-surface all roads that are important highways.  Intercommunication becomes vastly easier; the cost of transportation is  lessened by more than one-half; and the wear and destruction of vehicles  is reduced to a minimum. In every case the improvement of the road is  designed to increase traffic by making a given power do more work in  less time.      QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION    What have been the effects of Bessemer steel on the carrying power of  railways?--on cheapening freight rates?    What would be some of the effects first apparent were a large city like  London or New York suddenly cut off from railway communication?    What is meant by a tubular boiler?--by a forced draught?--by a  switch?--by an automatic coupler?    Ascertain from a railway official the various danger-signals as  indicated by lights, flags, and whistle-blasts.    Why should not crated furniture and coal have the same freight rate?    What is meant by a pool?--by long haul and short haul?--by rebate?    If the rate on a given weight of merchandise is one dollar and fifty  cents for five miles, should it be three hundred dollars for one  thousand miles?

[Illustration: DISTRIBUTION OF VEGETATION]          CHAPTER VII    FACTORS IN THE LOCATION OF CITIES AND TOWNS      The population of the world is very unevenly distributed. Not far from  nine-tenths live in lowland plains, below an altitude of 1,200 feet, in  regions where food-stuffs grow. The remainder live mainly in the  grass-producing regions of the great plateaus, the mining regions or the  flood-plains and grassy slopes of the higher montane regions.    =Communal Life.=--In each of these regions, also, there is a very unequal  massing of population. In part, the various families live isolated from  one another; in part, they gather into cities and villages. In other  words the population of a habitable region may be classed as _rural_ and  _urban_. In the United States and western Europe, agricultural pursuits  encourage rural life, each family living on its own estate. In Russia,  the agricultural population usually cluster in villages.    The farmer or freeholder who owns or controls his estate, exemplifies  the most advanced condition of personal and political liberty. Only a  few centuries have elapsed since not only the land but also the life of  a subject was the property of the king or the feudal lord, and in those  days about the only people living in isolation were outlaws. In most  cases the communal system, best exemplified in Russia, marks an  intermediate stage between a low and a high state of civilization; in  other instances it is necessary in order to insure safety. German  farmers in Siberia usually adopt the village plan for this reason.    For the greater part, the non-agricultural population of the civilized  world is massed in villages and cities for reasons that have nothing to  do with either civilization or self-defence. The causes that bring about  the massing of urban population are many and their operation is complex.  In general, however, it is to facilitate one or more of several things,  namely--the receiving, distribution, and transportation of commodities,  the manufacture of products, the existence of good harbors, and the  existence of minerals and metals necessary in the various industries.    =The Beginnings of Towns and Cities.=--The \"country town\" of agricultural  regions in many ways is the best type of the centre of population  engaged in receiving and disbursing commodities. The farmers living in  their vicinity send their crops to it for transportation or final  disposition. The country store is a sort of clearing-house, exchanging  household and other commodities, such as sugar, tea, coffee, spices,  drugs, silks, woollens, cotton goods, farming machinery, and furniture  for farm products. A railway station, grain elevator, and one or more  banks form the rest of its business equipment.    Usually the town has resulted from a position of easy access. It may be  the crossing of two highways, a good landing-place on a river, the  existence of a fording-place, a bridge, a ferry, a toll gate, or a point  that formed a convenient resting-place for a day's journey. The towns  and villages along the \"buffalo\" roads are examples almost without  number.    The \"siding\" or track where freight cars may be held for unloading, has  formed the beginning of many a town. The siding was located at the  convenience of the railway company; the village resulting could have  grown equally well almost anywhere else along the line.    [Illustration: THE EFFECT OF POSITION--BUFFALO IS AT THE FOOT OF LAKE  ERIE AND THE HEAD OF ERIE CANAL; AN EXCELLENT HARBOR FACILITATES ITS  COMMERCE]    In the early history of nearly every country, military posts formed the  beginnings of many centres that have grown to be large cities. Thus,  Rome, Paris, London, the various \"chesters\"[22] of England, Milan,  Turin, Paris, Chicago, Pittsburg, and Albany were established first as  military outposts. The trading post was most conveniently established  under the protection of the military camp, and the subsequent growth  depended partly on an accessible position, and partly on the  intelligence of the men who controlled the trade of the surrounding  regions.    =Harbors as Factors in the Growth of Cities.=--A good harbor draws trade  from a great distance. Thus, with a rate of 14-1/2 cents on a bushel of  wheat from Chicago, New York City draws a trade from a region having a  radius of more than one thousand miles. In its trade with Chinese ports,  Seattle, the chief port of Puget Sound, reaches as far eastward as  London and Hamburg.    =Water-Power as a Factor.=--The presence of water-power has brought about  the establishment of many centres that have grown into populous cities.  The water-power of the New England plateau had much to do with the rapid  growth of the New England States. At the time of the various embargo and  non-intercourse acts preceding the war of 1812, a great amount of  capital was thrown into idleness. The water-power was made available  because, during this time, the people were compelled to manufacture for  themselves the commodities that before had been imported.    The manufacturing industry at first was prosecuted in the southern  Appalachians as well as in the New England plateau. It survived in the  latter, partly because of the capital available, and partly owing to the  business experience of the people. In the meantime villages sprang up in  pretty nearly every locality in which there was available water-power.    Since the use of coal and the advent of cheap railway transportation,  steam has largely supplanted water-power, unless the latter is unlimited  in supply. As a result, there is a marked growth of the smaller centres  of population along the various water-fronts. In such cases the  advantages of a water-front offset the loss of water-power.    =The Effects of Metals on the Growth of Cities.=--The character of the  industry of a region has much to do with the character of its  manufactures. Thus, coal is absolutely essential to the manufacture of  iron and steel; and, inasmuch as from two to eight tons of the former  are necessary to manufacture a ton of steel, it is cheaper to ship the  ore to a place to which coal can be cheaply brought.    The coal-fields are responsible for the greater part of Pittsburg's  population, and almost wholly for that of Scranton, Wilkesbarre, and  many other Pennsylvania towns. Iron and coal are responsible, also, for  many cities and towns in the vicinity of the Great Lakes. Birmingham,  Salford, and Cardiff in Great Britain, Dortmund and Essen in Germany,  and St. Etienne in France have resulted from the presence of coal and  iron.    In many instances man is a great factor in the establishment of a centre  of population. Chicago would have been quite as well off in two or three  other locations; its present location is the result of man's energy and  is not likely to be changed. St. Louis might have been built at a dozen  different places and would have fared just as well; the same is true of  St. Paul, or of Indianapolis.    Leavenworth at one time was a more promising city than Kansas City, but  the building of an iron bridge over the Missouri River at the latter  place gave it a start, and wide-awake men kept it in the lead. It has  grown at the expense of Leavenworth and St. Joseph, neither one of which  has become a commercial centre. Cairo, at the junction of the  Mississippi and Ohio Rivers, has the geographical position for a great  city; it waits for the man who can concentrate the commerce there.    =Adjustment to Environment.=--San Francisco was wisely located at first,  but its grain trade was more economically carried on at Karquinez"]]]
