Did Murphy understand? According to Job Nutt, the shepherd, who was a  philosopher in his way, \"of course he did--he know'd he did: his'n did;  for why not your'n?\" In the face of such definite assertion there was no  room for doubt.    Nutt had had his lambing-pens, that year, down in the hollow where there  was \"burra\" from the winds. It was snowing when the hurdles and the straw  were carted out, and all hands had set to work building the sides of the  great square, with their thick, straw walls, their straw roofs, the snug  divisions into which the sides were divided, the whole sloping to the  south to catch what might be of the pale, wintry sun. Every one knew that  sheep lambed quicker and earlier when the snow fell. There had been no  time to lose therefore. The first lambs would be heard a fortnight before  Christmas. And, as a matter of fact, by mid January, Job Nutt's family  already numbered sixty-three. That was of course nothing. Why, one  January, his father had had one hundred and fifty-one lambs born between  a Saturday morning at light and Monday, no fewer than forty-two being  doubles--and snow falling all the time. Ay, and when he moved his  hurdles--that is, those that were straw-wattled--they were caked so hard  with snow that they stood upright of themselves. His father \"had had to  work _some_ that day and them two night.\" And Job always grinned a merry  grin when he told the story.    But now, to-day, when the two who were always together dropped down from  the hill to pay a visit to this shepherd, it was the last week of  February, when the mornings are as brilliant and full of hope as any in  the year. The rooks were busy building in the great elms by the river;  the wattles just below the lambing-pens were already turning red. Spring  was coming: the colour of the sky, the voices of the larks, the bleat of  the lambs, all told the same story. Of course winter would return: it  always did. But, for the moment, there was a passing exhibition of  beauties in store, a reflection of things that should be. By the  afternoon the grey blinds would be down again. But that did not matter in  the least: this glimpse had been permitted, and in the brilliant sunlight  and the stillness the happiness of full confidence had welled up, and  seemed to fill the whole world.    Murphy certainly appeared to feel it. As he and his master sunk the hill,  he stretched himself out as he ran; he jumped into the air for joy. His  doings, in some mysterious way, frequently reflected the colour of the  day; and his spirits varied with those of his master. The sympathy of  dogs is no modern discovery, but as old as their comradeship with man;  and thus this one varied his ways according as times were good or bad, or  trials, mental or bodily, chanced to be the same. On this brilliant  morning man and dog had caught the light of the sun and the gladness  thereof, and the young dog played with his master's hand as he swung  along, and barked and jumped for very love of life.    He was often like this now when they were alone together, though, with  others, he would sometimes lapse again into uncertainty and hesitation.  Nevertheless, there was no longer doubt that he was on the right road:  happiness had in a large measure returned; confidence was following. The  man and the dog were drawing very close to one another, and in more ways  than one.    The pens were only tenanted now by some thirty ewes, still to lamb, and  by those \"in hospital,\" as Job spoke of them. Four hundred tegs, ewes,  and lambs were in fold on the hill, on a clover stubble, or what remained  of it, being given crushed swedes and other things, for keep was scarce  so early in the year. The shepherd's boy and his dog were up there with  them: only Job and Scot were in the pens. Murphy knew this last, savage  though he was; and had duly delivered to him, on many a previous  occasion, that strange message of his that compelled the most savage to  let him pass free.    \"Oh! he can come: I likes that dog o' your'n,\" called Job, ordering Scot  to his place beneath the bleached and weather-worn hut on wheels, in  which all the miscellaneous articles of a shepherd's craft lay stored. \"I  be just about to find that mother yonder a new child,\" he added, with his  usual grin. He was busy tying the skin of a dead lamb on to the back of  another--dressing him up, in fact, in another suit, even as Rebecca once  did Jacob.    \"When a yo do lose her lamb, we's careful to leave the dead un next its  mother, for they've got hearts same as we. If us was to go for to take  the lamb, they 'ould pine. 'Tis nat'ral, ain't it? Well, you see, 'tis  like this. After a bit we takes a lamb from a yo as has a double, like  this un here; skins the dead lamb; and ties the skin round t'other's  neck, same as this--see? She'll let this un suck then; but she 'ouldn't  afore--no fear! They do know their own childern, same as we; just as they  knows them as tends 'em. By-and-by I'll cut this skin away, bit by bit,  when I judges this un has got to smell same as her own child: it'll be  all right then. Ah! 'tis like this with sheep--there's something to be  learnt about they every time in the day as one comes nigh 'em.\"    So the two men rested against the hurdles in the sun, and Murphy sat  solemnly between them: he had become very particular in his manners when  with sheep. The disguised lamb was already sucking the ewe; and Job lit  his short clay pipe and smiled: he had been up all night.    \"I'd never have a lamb killed, if it was my way; no'r I wouldn't. Do you  minds last season, when you and yer dog was along? I wus a-going across  the Dene with a bottle o' warm milk, with a bit of a tube stuck in it, if  you minds. 'Twas warm milk I'd taken from the cow. Ah, well, 'twas for a  lamb as had lost its mother: udder wrong; I could find of it when the  master brought the lot in. And I goes for to say as any un as 'ud serve a  yo that way should be crucified. Well, 'tis that very lamb as was as is  now the yo a-suckling the one we dressed up. See how things do work  round, don't 'em?\"    But the talk was not always about sheep, when the folds or the pens were  visited, or \"Him and his dog\" walked with Nutt and other shepherds over  the open lands, in the wind and the weather.    One day Job had been busy sheepwashing, and the talk turned on dogs, as  it often did.    \"'Tis wonderful what they knows. What don't 'em know? I says. See that  Scot I had--the one afore this un. Well, I was down a-sheepwashing, same  as I've been just. One o' the full-mouthed sheep as we had then broke  away, and went straight over river, and it ain't very narrow there, as  you minds. She got up on the further bank and stud. And Scot, he looks at  me, and across at the sheep, and then at me again. I know'd, right  enough, what he wanted. He wanted to go over and fetch that sheep back.  But I 'ouldn't let un, for a bit. And he kept a-looking and a-looking,  same as any one might speak. So I just moved my head, like; there was no  call to do no more. And off he set in the water, and swam river, ketched  the sheep by the throat--oh, no, he didn't hurt un, no fear!--dragged un  to the bank, and brought un over, right enough: he did, though.\"    \"Well, 'twas like this,\" he continued, after a laugh. \"A gen'leman was  a-rowing by in a boat at the time. And he comes across to our side, when  he sees what Scot 'a' done, and he says, 'Shepherd,' he says, 'I'll have  that dog off you, if you've a mind.' And with that he puts three golden  sovereigns on the bank at my feet, where we was busy a-sheepwashing. So I  looks at the sovereigns, and then at he, and says to un, with a laugh--I  says, '_No Sir_.' Lord, how he did pray me to let un have that dog!    \"Then it come about this way. That evening we was a-coming down through  the village, and passed 'The Crown'--that was, Scot and me--and there  stood the same gen'leman at the door. So he comes across the road, seeing  me, and he says, 'Well, shepherd,' he says, 'will you part with the dog  now, for, if so be as you will, I'll make it five instead of three?' he  says. And that's truth. And I just looked he between the eyes, like, and  says, 'Part with my dog, Sir?' I says. 'Why, Sir, if I wus to part with  he, I'll tell ye what he'd do--he'd pine and die--he'd just pine away and  die.' And with that I passed on, and left un. Dogs--well, sheep, if you  do please to understand, is sheep; but dogs is dogs, and God Almighty do  know as they be wonderful.\"    \"It's not all dogs, though, that are as shepherds' dogs, Nutt--or capable  of being.\"    Nutt shook his head. The two men and their dogs were on the hillside,  with two hundred and fifty tegs moving before them. The sheep were  walking with a wide front, but in single files, following those parallel  tracks that had marked this steep hillside for centuries, to puzzle  strangers.    \"You can't make a shepherd's dog out of every dog, can you?\"    \"Perhaps not, in your meaning. But I do know I could train a'most any  dog, if as I'd be so minded.\"    Scot was on ahead, where he should be. Murphy was close to heel.    \"Do you mean to say you could train this one to fold sheep?\"    Job Nutt took a deep draw at his pipe, and turned and looked down at  Murphy, now just over three years old.    \"I likes that dog; well, I've allus liked un. Train un to sheep? I  believe as I could, were I to be so minded: I do believe as I could.\"    The two had to part then. It was dusk, and looked like wet; moreover,  some wether sheep in the fold, far down in the valley, were \"howling\" for  rain: they were true weather-prophets always.    So he might be trained to sheep. Job Nutt's words kept repeating  themselves in the mind--\"I believe as I could; I do believe as I could.\"  What the shepherd had said was a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25823"],[0,"The Story of Leather (#12)"],[1,"!\"    \"I'm afraid you can't quite understand, sir. You see Peter Coddington  would like to go back, but Peter Strong won't let him. Peter Strong must  stay at the tannery, Father. He can't leave. There are reasons why it  isn't possible,\" Peter blurted out incoherently.    \"What reasons?\" demanded his father. \"You've not been getting into  trouble, Peter?\"    \"No, sir.\"    Mr. Coddington looked baffled--baffled, and displeased.    Poor Peter! He longed to explain, but a strange reticence held him back.  He had never mentioned at home either Strong's affairs or his friends  and it now seemed well-nigh impossible to make any one--even his own  father--understand how much he cared for Nat, and what this disaster had  meant to them both; besides, it was too much like blowing his own  trumpet to sit up and tell his father how he had played fairy godmother  to the Jacksons. It would sound as if he wanted praise, and Peter, who  was naturally a modest lad, shrank from anything of the sort.  Accordingly he said never a word.    Mr. Coddington wandered to the window and drummed nervously on the pane.    \"You have no more explanations to make to me, Peter?\" he asked at last,  turning and facing his son.    \"I--I'm afraid not, sir. You see it is hard to explain things. No one  would understand,\" faltered the boy.    Chagrined as he was, Mr. Coddington strove to be patient.    \"Come now, Peter,\" he urged, \"no matter what you've done let's out with  it. Maybe I've made a mistake in not allowing you to talk more freely  here at home about your affairs at the tannery. It certainly seems to  have resulted in making you less frank with me than you used to be. Let  us put all that behind us now. Just what sort of trouble have you got  into down there?\"    Words trembled on Peter's lips. Would it be loyal to tell his father--to  tell any one, all the Jacksons' affairs? Nat had told them in confidence  and had not expected they would be passed on to anybody else. No, he  must keep that trust sacred. He must tell no one.    \"I can't tell you, Father,\" he said. \"I'll come out all right, though.  Don't worry about me. I've just got to keep on working at the tannery as  hard as I can.\"    \"Are you trying to pay up something?\" inquired his father, an  inspiration seizing him.    \"Yes, sir.\"    Mr. Coddington realized that further attempts to get at the truth were  useless, and not a little perturbed he left the room.    All the next day Peter was haunted by reproaches. It took no very keen  vision to detect that his father was worried, and this worry the boy  felt he must relieve. His course lay clearly outlined before him; he  would go to the hospital and ask Nat's permission to tell the entire  story. Much as Peter disliked to speak of what he had done to help the  Jacksons it was far preferable to having his father suffer the present  anxiety.    Accordingly when Saturday afternoon came Peter set forth to make his  appeal to Nat. It was not until he almost reached the hospital that a  new and disconcerting thought complicated the action which but a few  moments before had appeared so simple. How was he to explain to Nat this  intimacy with Mr. Coddington? The president of the company, Nat knew as  well as he, had not been near Peter since he entered the tannery. Why  should young Strong suddenly be venturing to approach this august  personage with his petty troubles? Of course Nat wouldn't  understand--no, nor anybody else for that matter who was unacquainted  with the true situation. Here was a fresh obstacle in Peter's path. What  should he do?    When he entered the ward he struggled bravely to bring his usual  buoyancy to his command; but if the attempt was a sad failure it passed  unnoticed, for the instant he came within sight Nat beckoned to him  excitedly.    \"Guess who's been to see me!\" cried he, his eyes shining with the wonder  of his tidings. \"Guess, Peter! Oh, you never can guess--Mr. Coddington,  the boss himself! Yes, he did,\" he repeated as he observed Peter's  amazement. \"He came this morning and he sat right in that chair--that  very chair where you are sitting now. He wanted to know everything about  the accident, and about you; I had to tell him about Mother and the  rent, and how you were taking my place at home and paying for things  while I was sick. He screwed it all out of me! He inquired just how much  we paid for our rooms, and what I earned, and how long I had been in the  beamhouse. Then he asked what Father's name was, and what Mother's  family name was before she was married; and strangest of all, he wanted  to know if we came from Orinville, Tennessee. That was my mother's old  home, but I don't see how Mr. Coddington knew it, do you? Goodness,  Peter! He shot off questions as if they were coming out of a gun. Then  he began to ask about you and where you lived, and who your people were.  Doesn't it seem funny, Pete--well as I know you I couldn't tell him one  of those things? So I just said that I didn't know, but that Peter  Strong was the finest fellow in the world, and he seemed to agree with  me. Afterward he went away. What ever do you suppose made him come?\"    \"I don't know,\" Peter replied thoughtfully.    All the way home Peter pondered on the marvel. How had his father found  out about his friendship for Nat? It must have been Bryant who had told;  nobody else knew. Bryant had overheard Nat's conversation the day he had  been taken to the hospital, and Bryant must have acquainted Mr.  Coddington with the whole affair. Well, it was better so. His father now  had the facts, and had them direct from Nat himself. Peter would be  divulging no confidence if he mentioned them.    During the next few days many a surprise awaited Peter Strong. When he  went to pay Mrs. Jackson's weekly rent he was told by the landlord that  the account had already been settled, and the rent paid three months in  advance. A gentleman had paid it. No, the landlord did not know who it  was. In addition to this good fortune Mrs. Jackson astonished the boy  still further by dangling before his gaze a substantial check which she  said had come from the Coddington Company with a kind note of sympathy.  The check was to be used for defraying expenses during the illness of  her son.    Peter had no difficulty in guessing the source of this generosity.    Nor was this all. Nat scrawled him an incoherent note that bubbled with  delight; he had been promoted to the finishing department, and  henceforth was to receive a much larger salary!    That night Peter went home a very happy boy. It seemed as if there was  not room for any more good things to be packed into a single day; but  when at evening a crate came marked with his name, and on investigation  it proved to contain the long-coveted motorcycle, Peter's joy knew no  bounds.    \"Do you suppose now that your chum Strong could let Peter Coddington  return to school?\" was his father's unexpected question.    Peter stopped short.    It was a long time before he spoke; then he said slowly:    \"Father, I don't think there is a Peter Coddington any more. There's  only Peter Strong, and he is so interested in his work and in doing  real things that you couldn't coax him to go to school if you  tried--especially since he has just been given a new motorcycle!\"    Mr. Coddington rubbed his hands together as he always did when he was  pleased.    \"You must not decide hastily, Peter,\" urged he. \"Take a week to think  carefully about it and then tell me your decision.\"    \"But I know now!\" cried Peter. \"A little while ago I thought the tannery  the most awful place in the world; I hated the smell of it and the very  sight of the leather. But somehow I do not feel that way now. I did not  realize this until you spoke the other day of my leaving and going back  to school; then I was surprised to discover that, when I thought it all  over, I did not want to go back. Work can be fun--even hard work--if all  the time you know that you are doing something real--something that is  needed and that helps. If you don't mind, Father, I'd rather stay in the  tannery and aid Peter Strong to work up.\"    \"Do you still insist on Peter Strong's doing the climbing? Why not give  Peter Coddington a chance?\"    \"I'd rather not, sir. It was Peter Strong who began at the foot of the  ladder, and I want him to be the one to reach the top if he can; it is  only fair. Please don't spoil it now by crowding Peter Coddington into  his place.\"    \"Well, well! You may do your own way, Peter, but it is on one condition.  Nat Jackson needs a trip away. The doctors say he is tired out and won't  get well as fast as he should unless he has a change of some sort. I am  going to arrange with his mother to take him for a month to the  seashore, and I know he will be much happier if Peter Strong goes with  him. What do you say?\"    Peter looked intently at his father, a tiny cloud darkening his face.    \"You need not have any compunctions about going, Peter,\" explained Mr.  Coddington, reading the trouble in his eyes. \"Both the boys have worked  faithfully and need a vacation. Their positions will be held for them  until they return and their pay will go on during their absence.\"    \"Oh, Father! How good of you to do so much, not only for me but for Nat  and his mother!\"    Mr. Coddington did not reply at once. After a pause he said gently:    \"Peter, anything I can do for the Jackson family is but a small part of  what I owe them. All my life I have tried to trace them. I have searched  from Tennessee to Cape Cod. And now, here in my own tannery, I find the  clue for which I have been hunting. Your friend Nat and his mother are  proud people, and would never accept all that I wish I might offer them;  but at least I have this opportunity to furnish help in a purely  business way. To provide this trip is a great pleasure to me. Some time  you shall know the whole story and then you will understand. I want you  to know, "]]]
