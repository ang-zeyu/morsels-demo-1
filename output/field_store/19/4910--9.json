I always give each \"syce\" a fly whisk to keep flies off the horse while at  exercise, or when he is holding him anywhere. They are very cheap, last a  long time, and if not provided, the \"syce\" will arm himself with a dirty  duster or rag of some sort for the purpose. I may, perhaps, be too  sensitive on this point, but to see a dirty rag flourished about an  otherwise well-turned-out animal is to me a great eyesore.      Cleaning Horse Clothing, and Storing it in the Summer.    It never enters the head of a \"syce\" that clothing requires to be cleaned.  It should be frequently hung out in the sun and well beaten with a stick,  like a carpet is, and then well brushed on both sides with a stiff  clothes-brush. If necessary, it should be laid out flat and scrubbed with  a brush and soap and water, rinsed out with cold water, as hot will make  it shrink, and then, when dry again, beaten and brushed. The straps on  pieced rugs should have some dubbing (momrogan) now and again rubbed into  them, to prevent their getting hard and the leather perishing. Summer  clothing should be sent to the washerman (dhobie) to be washed. During the  summer months woollen clothing should be first cleaned, and then folded up  and put away, some camphor, pepper, and leaves of the \"neem\" tree, that  grows in every garden in Northern India, being placed between the folds to  keep off the moths. They should be folded away on the top of a box, board,  or table, or somewhere raised off the ground, to be out of the way of the  white ants, and once a week be unfolded and hung out in the sun to air for  a few hours, folded up, and stored away again. There is no occasion to  waste the spices that are with them; if they are carefully unfolded over  some newspapers, the whole can be collected and used again.      Numdahs.    If used at all, felt numdahs should have a plain edge, and not be bound  with coloured tape, as they so often are; particularly the cheaper ones,  that are sold by native saddlers. I have frequently seen sore backs  caused by this tape binding, as well as the hair in white horses  discoloured by the edge. When put on, the numdah should be well pulled up  into the arch of the saddle, particularly in front. The common practice is  to put the numdah flat on the back, and then the saddle on the top of it,  so that when the weight comes on it, the numdah gets tight and is  stretched, and is a common cause of sore backs and galled withers. When  taken off the horse's back, the numdah should be spread out in the sun to  dry; it should then be beaten with a stick and brushed with a hard brush  to get the dry caked perspiration out of it, and to bring the nap of the  felt up again. If this is not done it will get as hard as a board, and  neglected numdahs are certain to give sore backs. If the saddle is  properly stuffed and fitted to the horse's back, a numdah is not required,  the only use of it being to save the lining of the saddle, and for this  purpose I prefer a leather one.      Grooming (_malish_).    Grooming is an art that native grooms excel in. They have infinite  patience, and their long supple fingers are peculiarly adapted for the  work. They, furthermore, are used to it, for every Oriental is an adept  at shampooing or massage, constantly doing it to their own limbs and those  of their friends. When the horse comes in from work the bridle should be  taken off him, hung up on a peg, and a watering bridle put into his mouth,  the stirrup irons run up to the top of the leathers, and the girths  slackened. If there is a breast-plate it can be taken off, but the saddle  should not be removed till the back gets cool. According to the season of  the year, a light or warm rug should be thrown over the quarters, and the  horse walked about till he gets cool. If there is much mud sticking on  him, it can be rubbed off with a wisp of straw before the brush is used.  Horses should not be washed, or, if they are, only under very exceptional  circumstances, when specially ordered. It is, however, a favourite  practice among \"syces,\" as it saves a good deal of trouble; and it is much  easier to wash off mud and dirt than to remove it with the brush, as ought  to be done; they are also very apt to use the curry-comb for this purpose.  When the horse is cool he should be gone over with the brush, to remove  what dirt is remaining, and when this is finished the process should be  repeated with the hands, the palm and bend of the wrist being used for  this purpose. If it is the hot weather, the grooming had best be done  out-of-doors; but in winter it is best to do it in the stable, as in  Northern India there is a cold wind blowing even in the middle of the day,  and if exposed to it horses are liable to catch cold. As soon as the  grooming is finished, which with a clipped horse can be done in about half  an hour, the clothing and bandages should be put on, and, if it is  evening, the bed put down. Even if not worked, this process of grooming  should take place twice a day--before the morning and evening feed.      Wisps and Grooming Pads.    Straw wisps or leather pads are particularly useful in developing the  muscle of a thin animal, or bringing the skin into order when it has been  neglected. The wisps are made by twisting some of the bedding straw  together into a rope about three feet long. This is then doubled in the  middle and again twisted, so as to form a flat pad. Two of these wisps are  used, one in each hand, and they are alternately brought down with a  slight slap and drawing motion in the direction of the hair, the whole  body being massaged with them. It is sometimes a good plan, if there is  much dirt in the coat, to cover the pad with a damp duster; the dirt  seems to stick to it. This is particularly useful when horses are changing  their coats; the hair sticks to the damp cloth, and the old coat is  brought out quicker than it otherwise would be. The grooming pads are used  in the same way. They are two circles of leather about four or five inches  in diameter, joined together with a strip of chamois leather about three  inches wide, so as to form a pad or cushion, that is stuffed with tow. On  one side a piece of leather or webbing is stitched at each end,  sufficiently loose to allow the hand to be slipped under it in the same  way as the horse brush. Two of these pads are used, and the skin beaten or  massaged by each hand alternately. Although, perhaps, at first horses are  fidgety, when they get used to it they appear to enjoy it; and it has the  advantage of letting the owner know, if he is not in sight, that the  \"syce\" is working by the noise he makes.      Hand-rubbing.    If horses are inclined to get filled on swollen legs, the tendons should  be well hand-rubbed for five minutes at each grooming hour. This  hand-rubbing should commence from the lower portion of the limb and be  continued upwards, not in the reverse direction, which is the usual  practice. The limb should be lifted up, and the fingers worked with a  kneading motion behind the tendons.      Washing.    The feet, mane and tail are the only parts that should ever be washed,  unless specially ordered, and then as seldom as possible. When the feet  are washed, great care should be taken that they are carefully dried  afterwards, and bandages put on, as leaving the legs wet is one of the  chief causes of cracked heels, more especially in the winter months, if  there is a dry cold wind blowing. If soap is used, it should be soft-soap;  or, better still, the soap nut, or \"reita.\" This is a berry, the shell or  outer covering of which, when soaked in water, swells up into a sticky  mass, that lathers like soap, and by natives of India is used for washing  purposes.      Uneven Manes.    When the mane gets ragged and uneven, it should be carefully brushed down  four or five times a day with a damp water brush, to make it lie flat. The  long hairs on the under side next the neck should be pulled out, so that  the mane is thinned, and the lower part lies in a perfect curve along the  neck. Some horses object, and are a little troublesome during this  process; but, if it is done gradually, it can be easily accomplished. The  long hairs in the mane should never be cut, unless it is intended to clip  it off altogether, and make it into a \"hogged\" mane. If the mane will not  lie down flat with an even sweep, it can be covered with a cake of mud for  four or five days, when it should be removed, and renewed if necessary.  Being dry, it will crack, and the pieces can be easily knocked off, and  the dust brushed out. The mud cake generally has the desired effect after  having been applied four or five times.      Hogged Manes.    The manes of polo ponies and cobs it is the fashion to \"hog,\" or cut off  close to the neck. It is best to leave the forelock, as it gives a certain  protection against the flies and glare of the sun; also, to leave a lock  of hair on the wither, to grasp with the hand when mounting. The best  implement to hog a mane with is a pair of ordinary horse-clippers, but  don't use a new pair, or they will get spoiled; old ones that are no use  for the rest of the body, do well enough. It is best to sit on the  animal's back when the mane is being hogged, and to cut forwards; the  hair will be cut much smoother, and a neater job made of it than when  standing on the ground at the side.      Ragged Legs.    If the horse is not clipped, the long hairs at the back of the legs look  very unsightly. They should be pulled out, not cut off. If a little  powdered resin is rubbed on the finger and thumb, the hair will stick to  it, and come out much more easily, and the legs will have a smooth, even  appearance, which can never be attained if they are cut off with scissors,  no matter how carefully this is done; there will always be jagged ridges  left. The long hairs under the jowl can be singed off by passing a lighted"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32426"],[0,"A Synopsis of the North American Lagomorpha (#12)"],[1," cunicularius cunicularius_    4. _Sylvilagus graysoni_ ]      =Sylvilagus cunicularius=    Mexican Cottontail    Total length, 485-515; tail, 54-68; hind foot, 108-111; ear from notch  (dry), 60-63.

Upper parts grayish, brownish or black; interparietal  bone fused to surrounding bones; cervical vertabrae long, 2nd and 3rd  being longer than wide; transverse processes of lumbar vertabrae long,  the longest one equal to the length of the centrum to which it is  attached plus half of the length of the preceding centrum; free  extremity of transverse process of lumbar vertebra considerably  expanded; distance from anterior edge of acetabulum to extreme anterior  point of ilium less than distance from former point to most distant  point of ischium; ulna reduced in size along middle part of shaft, and,  excepting the lower extremity, placed almost entirely behind radius.    All members of the genus _Lepus_ are technically hares, as these are  defined in the account of the family Leporidae. The largest members of  the order Lagomorpha are members of the genus _Lepus_. No domestic  strains have been developed but effort in this direction might be  profitable, in as much as the so-called Belgian hares of the related  genus, _Oryctolagus_, have done well in captivity.    In the past it has been customary to recognize two or more subgenera of  the genus _Lepus_. The species are a less diverse lot than those in  some other genera, however, and it seems that no useful purpose is  served by recognizing subgenera. Accordingly, the several names proposed  for this purpose are arranged here as synonyms of the generic name  _Lepus_ Linnaeus.    The introduction of the European Hare (_Lepus europaeus_) into the  eastern part of the North American Continent has been successful in the  sense that the animal is multiplying. If it continues to increase, the  increase almost certainly will be at the expense of some native species  of rabbit. This circumstance and the unfortunate consequences of the  introduction of the European rabbit (_Oryctolagus cuniculus_) in New  Zealand (see Wodzicki, 1950:107-141) and Australia (see Stead,  1925:355-358) give basis for effort to exterminate the alien species  before it spreads more widely.
