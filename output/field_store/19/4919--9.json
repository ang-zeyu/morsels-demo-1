There fix thy dwelling, trust there  whatsoever thou hast thence, O my soul, at least now thou art tired out  with vanities. Entrust Truth, whatsoever thou hast from the Truth, and  thou shalt lose nothing; and thy decay shall bloom again, and all thy  diseases be healed, and thy mortal parts be reformed and renewed, and  bound around thee: nor shall they lay thee whither themselves descend;  but they shall stand fast with thee, and abide for ever before God, Who  abideth and standeth fast for ever.    Why then be perverted and follow thy flesh? Be it converted and follow  thee. Whatever by her thou hast sense of, is in part; and the whole,  whereof these are parts, thou knowest not; and yet they delight thee.  But had the sense of thy flesh a capacity for comprehending the whole,  and not itself also, for thy punishment, been justly restricted to  a part of the whole, thou wouldest, that whatsoever existeth at this  present, should pass away, that so the whole might better please thee.  For what we speak also, by the same sense of the flesh thou hearest; yet  wouldest not thou have the syllables stay, but fly away, that others may  come, and thou hear the whole. And so ever, when any one thing is made  up of many, all of which do not exist together, all collectively would  please more than they do severally, could all be perceived collectively.  But far better than these is He who made all; and He is our God, nor  doth He pass away, for neither doth aught succeed Him.    If bodies please thee, praise God on occasion of them, and turn back  thy love upon their Maker; lest in these things which please thee, thou  displease. If souls please thee, be they loved in God: for they too are  mutable, but in Him are they firmly stablished; else would they pass,  and pass away. In Him then be they beloved; and carry unto Him along  with thee what souls thou canst, and say to them, \"Him let us love, Him  let us love: He made these, nor is He far off. For He did not make them,  and so depart, but they are of Him, and in Him. See there He is, where  truth is loved. He is within the very heart, yet hath the heart strayed  from Him. Go back into your heart, ye transgressors, and cleave fast to  Him that made you. Stand with Him, and ye shall stand fast. Rest in Him,  and ye shall be at rest. Whither go ye in rough ways? Whither go ye?  The good that you love is from Him; but it is good and pleasant through  reference to Him, and justly shall it be embittered, because unjustly is  any thing loved which is from Him, if He be forsaken for it. To what end  then would ye still and still walk these difficult and toilsome ways?  There is no rest, where ye seek it. Seek what ye seek; but it is not  there where ye seek. Ye seek a blessed life in the land of death; it is  not there. For how should there be a blessed life where life itself is  not?    \"But our true Life came down hither, and bore our death, and slew him,  out of the abundance of His own life: and He thundered, calling aloud to  us to return hence to Him into that secret place, whence He came forth  to us, first into the Virgin's womb, wherein He espoused the human  creation, our mortal flesh, that it might not be for ever mortal, and  thence like a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, rejoicing as a giant  to run his course. For He lingered not, but ran, calling aloud by words,  deeds, death, life, descent, ascension; crying aloud to us to return  unto Him. And He departed from our eyes, that we might return into our  heart, and there find Him. For He departed, and lo, He is here. He would  not be long with us, yet left us not; for He departed thither, whence  He never parted, because the world was made by Him. And in this world  He was, and into this world He came to save sinners, unto whom my soul  confesseth, and He healeth it, for it hath sinned against Him. O ye sons  of men, how long so slow of heart? Even now, after the descent of Life  to you, will ye not ascend and live? But whither ascend ye, when ye are  on high, and set your mouth against the heavens? Descend, that ye may  ascend, and ascend to God. For ye have fallen, by ascending against  Him.\" Tell them this, that they may weep in the valley of tears, and  so carry them up with thee unto God; because out of His spirit thou  speakest thus unto them, if thou speakest, burning with the fire of  charity.    These things I then knew not, and I loved these lower beauties, and I  was sinking to the very depths, and to my friends I said, \"Do we love  any thing but the beautiful? What then is the beautiful? and what is  beauty? What is it that attracts and wins us to the things we love? for  unless there were in them a grace and beauty, they could by no  means draw us unto them.\" And I marked and perceived that in bodies  themselves, there was a beauty, from their forming a sort of whole, and  again, another from apt and mutual correspondence, as of a part of  the body with its whole, or a shoe with a foot, and the like. And this  consideration sprang up in my mind, out of my inmost heart, and I wrote  \"on the fair and fit,\" I think, two or three books. Thou knowest, O  Lord, for it is gone from me; for I have them not, but they are strayed  from me, I know not how.    But what moved me, O Lord my God, to dedicate these books unto Hierius,  an orator of Rome, whom I knew not by face, but loved for the fame  of his learning which was eminent in him, and some words of his I had  heard, which pleased me? But more did he please me, for that he pleased  others, who highly extolled him, amazed that out of a Syrian, first  instructed in Greek eloquence, should afterwards be formed a wonderful  Latin orator, and one most learned in things pertaining unto philosophy.  One is commended, and, unseen, he is loved: doth this love enter the  heart of the hearer from the mouth of the commender? Not so. But by one  who loveth is another kindled. For hence he is loved who is commended,  when the commender is believed to extol him with an unfeigned heart;  that is, when one that loves him, praises him.    For so did I then love men, upon the judgment of men, not Thine, O my  God, in Whom no man is deceived. But yet why not for qualities, like  those of a famous charioteer, or fighter with beasts in the theatre,  known far and wide by a vulgar popularity, but far otherwise, and  earnestly, and so as I would be myself commended? For I would not be  commended or loved, as actors are (though I myself did commend and love  them), but had rather be unknown, than so known; and even hated, than  so loved. Where now are the impulses to such various and divers kinds of  loves laid up in one soul? Why, since we are equally men, do I love  in another what, if I did not hate, I should not spurn and cast from  myself? For it holds not, that as a good horse is loved by him, who  would not, though he might, be that horse, therefore the same may be  said of an actor, who shares our nature. Do I then love in a man, what I  hate to be, who am a man? Man himself is a great deep, whose very hairs  Thou numberest, O Lord, and they fall not to the ground without Thee.  And yet are the hairs of his head easier to be numbered than his  feelings, and the beatings of his heart.    But that orator was of that sort whom I loved, as wishing to be myself  such; and I erred through a swelling pride, and was tossed about with  every wind, but yet was steered by Thee, though very secretly. And  whence do I know, and whence do I confidently confess unto Thee, that  I had loved him more for the love of his commenders, than for the very  things for which he was commended? Because, had he been unpraised, and  these self-same men had dispraised him, and with dispraise and contempt  told the very same things of him, I had never been so kindled and  excited to love him. And yet the things had not been other, nor he  himself other; but only the feelings of the relators. See where the  impotent soul lies along, that is not yet stayed up by the solidity  of truth! Just as the gales of tongues blow from the breast of the  opinionative, so is it carried this way and that, driven forward and  backward, and the light is overclouded to it, and the truth unseen. And  lo, it is before us. And it was to me a great matter, that my discourse  and labours should be known to that man: which should he approve, I were  the more kindled; but if he disapproved, my empty heart, void of Thy  solidity, had been wounded. And yet the \"fair and fit,\" whereon I wrote  to him, I dwelt on with pleasure, and surveyed it, and admired it,  though none joined therein.    But I saw not yet, whereon this weighty matter turned in Thy wisdom,  O Thou Omnipotent, who only doest wonders; and my mind ranged through  corporeal forms; and \"fair,\" I defined and distinguished what is so  in itself, and \"fit,\" whose beauty is in correspondence to some other  thing: and this I supported by corporeal examples. And I turned to  the nature of the mind, but the false notion which I had of spiritual  things, let me not see the truth. Yet the force of truth did of itself  flash into mine eyes, and I turned away my panting soul from incorporeal  substance to lineaments, and colours, and bulky magnitudes. And not  being able to see these in the mind, I thought I could not see my mind.  And whereas in virtue I loved peace, and in viciousness I abhorred  discord; in the first I observed a unity, but in the other, a sort  of division. And in that unity I conceived the rational soul, and the  nature of truth and of the chief good to consist; but in this division  I miserably imagined there to be some unknown substance of irrational  life, and the nature of the chief evil, which should not only be a  substance, but real life also, and yet not derived from Thee, O my God,  of whom are all things.
