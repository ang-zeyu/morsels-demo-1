Thus Saladin  was connected with Maimonides and with Richard the Lion-Hearted,  and, similarly, Rashi with Godfrey of Bouillon.    The story goes that Godfrey, having heard rumors of the knowledge  and wisdom of the rabbi of Troyes, summoned Rashi to his presence  to consult with him upon the issue of his undertaking.  Rashi  refused to appear.  Annoyed, Godfrey accompanied by his cavaliers  went to the rabbi's school.  He found the door open, but the  great building empty.  By the strength of his magic Rashi had  made himself invisible, but he himself could see everything.  \"Where art thou, Solomon?\" cried the cavalier.  \"Here I am,\" a  voice answered; \"what does my lord demand?\"  Godfrey not seeing a  living soul repeated his question, and always received the same  answer.  But not a man to be seen!  Utterly confounded, he left  the building and met a disciple of Rashi's.  \"Go tell thy  master,\" he said, \"that he should appear; I swear he has nothing  to fear from me.\"  The rabbi then revealed himself.[28]  \"I see,\"  Godfrey said to him, \"that thy wisdom is great.  I should like to  know whether I shall return from my expedition victorious, or  whether I shall succumb.  Speak without fear.\"    \"Thou wilt take the Holy City,\" Rashi replied, \"and thou wilt  reign over Jerusalem three days, but on the fourth day the Moslem  will put thee to flight, and when thou returnest only three  horses will be left to thee.\"    \"It may be,\" replied Godfrey, irritated and disillusioned in  seeing his future pictured in colors so sombre.  \"But if I return  with only one more horse than thou sayest, I shall wreak  frightful vengeance upon thee.  I shall throw thy body to the  dogs, and I shall put to death all the Jews of France.\"    After several years of fighting Godfrey of Bouillon, ephemeral  king of Jerusalem, took his homeward road back to France,  accompanied by three cavaliers, in all, 'then, four horses, one  more than Rashi had predicted.  Godfrey remembered the rabbi's  prophecy, and determined to carry out his threat.  But when he  entered the city of Troyes, a large rock, loosened from the gate,  fell upon one of the riders, killing him and his horse.  Amazed at  the miracle, the duke perforce had to recognize that Rashi had  not been wrong, and he wanted to go to the seer to render him  homage, but he learned that Rashi had died meanwhile.  This  grieved him greatly.    This legend was further embellished by the addition of details.  Some placed the scene at Worms; others asserted that the duke  asked Rashi to accompany him to Lorraine; but Rashi nobly  refused, as Maimonides did later.  All forgot that Godfrey of  Bouillon after he left for the Crusades never saw his fatherland  again, but died at Jerusalem, five years before Rashi.    Rashi's life offers no more noteworthy events.  He passed the  balance of his days in study, in guiding the community, and in  composing his works.  Without doubt, our lack of information  concerning his last years is due to this very fact-to the peace  and calm in which that time was spent.    A naive legend has it that he wanted to know who would be his  companion in Paradise.  He learned in a dream that the man lived  at Barcelona, and was called Abraham the Just.  In order to  become acquainted with him while still on earth, Rashi, despite  his great age, started forth on a journey to Barcelona.  There he  found a very rich man, but, as was alleged, he was also very  impious.  However, Rashi was not long in discovering that for all  his life of luxury he was just and generous of spirit.  Rashi  even composed a work in his honor entitled \"The Amphitryon,\" in  Hebrew, <I>Ha-Parnes.</I>  Do you think the work was lost?  Not a  bit of it.  It still exists, but it is called <I>Ha-Pardes.</I>  The legend is based upon a copyist's mistake.  However, it is  found in different forms in other literatures.    Beyond a doubt Rashi died and was buried in his birthplace.  Nevertheless the story is told, that as he was about to return to  France with his young wife, the daughter of his host at Prague,  after his long trip of study and exploration, which I have  already described, an unknown man entered his dwelling and struck  him a mortal blow.  But the people could not resign themselves to  accept so miserable an end for so illustrious a man, and the  legend received an addition.  At the very moment Rashi was to be  buried, his wife ran up and brought him back to life by means of  a philtre.  His father-in-law, in order not to excite the envy of  his enemies, kept the happy event a secret, and ordered the  funeral to be held.  The coffin was carried with great pomp to  the grave, which became an object of veneration for the Jews of  Prague.  In fact, a tomb is pointed out as being that of the  celebrated rabbi, and, as the inscription is effaced, the  assertion can safely be made that Rashi died in the capital of  Bohemia.    Rashi's death was less touching and less tragic.  We learn from a  manuscript dated Thursday, the twenty-ninth of Tammuz, in the  year 4865 of the Creation (July 13, 1105), that Rashi died at  Troyes.  He was then sixty-five years of age.    It is as though the echo of the regrets caused by Rashi's death  resounded in the following note in an old manuscript: \"As the  owner of a fig-tree knows when it is time to cull the figs, so  God knew the appointed time of Rashi, and carried him away in his  hour to let him enter heaven.  Alas! he is no more, for God has  taken him.\"  These few lines, without doubt the note of some  copyist, show with what deep respect the memory of Rashi came to  be cherished but shortly after his death.  Like Rabbeun Gershom he  was awarded after his death the title of \"Light of the  Captivity.\"  But later the title was applied only to Gershom, as  though Rashi had no need of it to distinguish him.    Rashi died \"full of days,\" having led a life of few incidents,  because it was uniformly devoted to study and labor.  He was like  a patriarch who is surrounded by the affection of his children  and by the respect of his contemporaries.  To future generations  he bequeathed the memory of his virtues and the greatness of his  work.  And his memory has survived the neglect of time and the  ingratitude of man.  Posterity has enveloped his brow with a halo  of glory, and after the lapse of eight centuries the radiance of  his personality remains undiminished.                               CHAPTER IV                     CHARACTER AND LEARNING OF RASHI    Not only is there little information concerning the incidents of  Rashi's life, but also there are only a few sources from which we  can learn about his mental makeup and introduce ourselves, so to  speak, into the circle of his thoughts and ideas.  Generally one  must seek the man in his work.  But into writings so objective as  those of a commentator who does not even exert himself to set  forth his method and principles in a preface, a man is not apt to  put much of his own personality.  Moreover, Rashi was disposed to  speak of himself as little as possible.  From time to time,  however, he lets a confidence escape, and we treasure it the more  carefully because of its rarity.    Fortunately we can get to know him a little better through his  letters, that is, through the Responsa addressed by him to those  who consulted him upon questions of religious law.  Another  source, no less precious, is afforded by the works of his pupils,  who noted with pious care the least acts or expressions of their  master that were concerned with points of law.    I shall endeavor to sum up all this information, so that we may  get a picture of the man and trace his features in as distinct  lines as possible.                                    I    Needless to say, Rashi's conduct was always honorable and his  manners irreproachable.  To be virtuous was not to possess some  special merit; it was the strict fulfilment [fulfillment sic] of  the Law.  We have seen that Rashi's life was pure; and his life  and more particularly his work reveal a firm, controlled nature,  a simple, frank character, clear judgment, upright intentions,  penetrating intelligence, and profound good sense.  The Talmudic  maxim might be applied to him: \"Study demands a mind as serene as  a sky without clouds.\" His was a questioning spirit, ever alert.  He had the special gift of viewing the outer world intelligently  and fixing his attention upon the particular object or the particular  circumstance that might throw light upon a fact or a text.  For instance, although he did not know Arabic, he remembered  certain groups of related words in the language, which had  either been called to his attention or which he had met with in  reading.  He noticed of his own accord that \"Arabic words begin  with 'al'.\" To give another example of this discernment: he  explains a passage of the Talmud by recalling that he saw Jews  from Palestine beating time to mark the melody when they were  reading the Pentateuch.    The clearness and poise ef Rashi's intellect-qualities which he  possessed in common with other French rabbis, though in a higher  degree-stand in favorable contrast with the sickly symbolism, the  unwholesome search for mystery, which tormented the souls of  ecclesiastics, from the monk Raoul Glaber up to the great Saint  Bernard, that man, said Michelet, \"diseased by the love of God.\"    Yet the Jews of Northern France were not, as one might suppose  from their literature, cold and dry of temperament.  They were  sensitive and tender-hearted.  They did not forever lead the  austere life of scholarly seclusion; they did not ignore the  affections nor the cares of family; they knew how to look upon  life and its daily come and go.    But they did not go to the other extreme and become philosophers.  Traditional religion was to them the entire truth.

When amusement outside of home is sought  let it be, as far as possible, of a nature that both may enjoy it  equally.    Husband and Wife! He, being of larger mould in every particular, in  head, chest, and all the vital organs, is the provider, the protector,  the guardian of his home; he, the masculine, or representative of the  Truth, is to lead the way in conducting home or business affairs. She,  the feminine, or representative of the Good, inclines to the good way  continually; and, as married partners, Good and Truth should be married  in them. There cannot be a true evil way nor a good false way; there can  only be a true good way and a good true way. So the wife, the good, must  conjoin herself to her husband, the truth, in order that every truth may  result in good; and the husband, the truth, should seek to be conjoined  to the wife, the good, that every good may become true. In this there is  much wisdom: if the husband be truly wise he will always be sure that  all his projects are tempered with good; while if the wife be truly  good, all her doings will be enlightened by truth. As hand in hand they  thus go through life's planning and doing, the husband will always be  assisted by his good, the wife; and the wife will be led on in good by  her truth, the husband. By taking this high and holy ground, there will  be experienced pleasure and happiness by the married couple, far  transcending all other modes of life in existence. Then will each and  every organ in the body be seen to have a fitness, a place, and a use  which could not possibly be dispensed with, because, each and all these  organs have an originating cause in the mental and spiritual parts of  mankind, from which they proceed and from which they exist. Thus we see  how wrong, how frightfully wrong it is to abuse, or pervert the use of,  _any_ of these physical organs which are so sacred and so important to  the welfare of the human family. \"Dishonor the body, the temple of the  soul, and you dishonor the soul.\" \"If any man defile the temple of God,  him will God destroy.\"--I. Cor. 3:17.    When married, the battle for one united and harmonious life really  begins. The wife's great and supreme love for her husband personally,  will allow many privileges which under other circumstances her timidity  and chastity would refuse. Tenderly and with great consideration should  these privileges be accepted. For, contrary to the opinion of many men,  there is no sexual passion on the part of the bride that induces her to  grant such liberties. Then how exquisitely gentle and how forbearing  should be the bridegroom's deportment on such occasions! Sometimes such  a shock is administered to her sensibilities that she does not recover  from it for years; and in consequence of this shock, rudely or  thoughtlessly administered, she forms a deeply rooted antipathy against  the very act which is the bond and seal of a truly happy married life.  These sexual unions serve to bring the married pair into a perfectly  harmonious relation to each other. And just as tenderly, lovingly and  harmoniously should they join in each and all the daily uses of life  which they are called upon to perform. The sexual relation is among the  most important uses of married life; it vivifies the affections for each  other, as nothing else in this world can, and is a powerful reminder of  their mutual obligations to one another and to the community in which  they live. Indulgence, however, should not be too frequent, lest it  debilitate the pair and undermine their health. The bridegroom and  husband should carefully watch over his bride and wife to see that she  is not a sufferer and should govern himself accordingly. It is better  that these renewed obligations should be made at stated periods, as man  is governed so much by habit. As a rule, once or twice a week, or in  some cases once in two weeks, is sufficient; but once a week will  suffice in many cases for healthful purposes. During the menstrual flow  there should be an entire cessation of the conjugal act. When pregnancy  occurs it is in most cases, more healthful and better for the expectant  mother to allow intercourse at regular times, very gently, throughout  her gestation.    The object of marriage is the ultimation of that love which brings the  two together and binds them together, in the procreation and rearing of  children for Heaven. This is the only true aim and sole object about  which every earthly desire, interest and plan of the married pair should  cluster.    _As to the question of child-bearing._ No greater crime in the sight  of Heaven exists to-day than that of perverting the natural uses of  marriage. This is done in a great variety of ways, every one of which  is criminal, in whatever form practised; and none will escape the  penalty--no, not one. Nature's laws are inexorable; every transgression  thereof is surely punished, even at the _climacteric period_, if not  before. The questions of failing health, of physical inability, or too  frequent conceptions are matters for the investigation, advice and  decision of an experienced, judicious and upright physician. They should  never be taken in hand and judged upon by the parties themselves. And  to the objection \"can't afford to have children; they cost too much,\" I  have faith enough to reply, \"Our Heavenly Father never sends more mouths  than he can feed.\" Let each one do his and her duty in life and this  cavil falls to the ground like water--which, when spilled, cannot be  gathered up.    Good people everywhere rejoice when they behold a married couple living  together in an orderly manner and rearing a large family of children.  How often is Queen Victoria held up as a pattern of excellence in this  respect: she accepted and acknowledged Prince Albert as her husband and  gave herself to him as his wife; and so indeed she was in every sense of  the term. Although a Queen, sitting on the pinnacle of power, she did  not seek to avoid the pangs, the dangers or inconveniences of  child-bearing. By her own personal strength her twelve children were  brought forth and her own sensitive fibres and tissues felt the  suffering. She nursed, caressed and loved them like a good mother and  she was a _royal mother_! Other kings and queens have done likewise;  other husbands and wives, high in power, wealth and fashion have done  and are still doing the same. And how much the less should we, in the  humbler walks of life, obey the Divine command \"Be fruitful and  multiply.\"    If a husband truly loves his wife and if she truly loves him, they will  live for each other and in each other, and they will be one; and they  will seek to do right in every particular of their marital relation.  To apply to life the truths advanced above and to realize them, will  require great effort by the parties in question. This manner of life  will not come of itself; it is too good to come without working for.  Mutual concessions must be made daily, and several times a day; one's  own way must frequently be given up, and always when discovered to  be a selfish way, because the mutual good is always to be consulted.  Questions of importance should be discussed freely and dispassionately,  and a good reason be established before adopting actions that may not  lead to proper results. In the marriage co-partnership the interest  in the right and the wrong, the loss and the gain, the lights and the  shadows, the pleasures and the pains, should be equally shared; because  they concern one just as much as the other, and should be equally  enjoyed, and equally borne by both.    A start is made with loving hearts and this state of affairs must never  be allowed to diminish. The husband should ever be glad to see his wife,  and the wife should ever be glad to see her husband. How many husbands  never know what reception they will meet with on returning home after  their anxious and exhausting business hours are over for the day; it may  be a happy or a very unhappy one. How much it consoles, encourages,  lifts up, and rests a man to return to his home after the trying scenes  of a day busily spent in providing for the support of his family are  over, to find his wife affectionate and serene, and all about the house  brilliant with contentment. Such a wife if she has troubles, and of  course she has just as many troubles as the husband, though of a  different kind, and wishes to call the attention of her husband to them,  will do it at a proper time, when she knows it will annoy him the least,  and when he will be able to give her the most assistance. She will never  try to annoy him; but endeavoring to be a true help-meet will seek in a  proper and loving way to get him to be the same to her. The wife will  gain and command the respect of her husband only through kind and  loving ways. By her love constantly and judiciously administered she  will lead him onward and upward to higher aspirations and better  circumstances in life, throughout their days of united existence. A  scolding, fretting, worrying and selfish wife has ruined for life many  a husband.    All the \"self-denial\" however, as it is called by some, is not on the  wife's side; the husband too must be forbearing; he must remember on his  way home at night that his faithful wife, who has been at home all day,  has had trials and disappointments in her domestic affairs; and he must  not be disappointed to find domestic arrangements a little disordered,  and his wife somewhat chagrined that, under the circumstances, she  really could give him no better a reception than he may experience. He  must always try to make the best of it and be satisfied. He must not  find fault with the cooking, for instance, but must be"]]]
