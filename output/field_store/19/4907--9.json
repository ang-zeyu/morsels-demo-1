Twenty boys is the full number, but  only twelve of these are full choristers, the others being nominally on  probation, a plan which serves to keep up the discipline.      LINCOLN'S INN CHAPEL.    There are twelve boys here. They come, with a fair knowledge of music,  at about nine years of age, and receive from Dr. Steggall, or his  assistants, three lessons of about two hours each every week. On Sunday,  at the close of the morning service, there is a rehearsal with the men  of the music for the afternoon, and for the morning of the following  Sunday. The boys' practices are held in the choir-room, where Dr.  Steggall, seated at a venerable Broadwood grand, coaches his little men,  with care and neatness. On Saturdays, when half their lesson is done,  the boys walk across to the chapel, and go through the Sunday's music  with the organ. A pupil mounts to the instrument, while Dr. Steggall,  book in hand, paces the aisle, or retires towards the communion table,  constantly interrupting the singing to correct faults, or improve  delivery. Meanwhile, the organ is played quite softly, that the voices  may stand out clearly. Constant care is taken to prevent clipping of  words in the most familiar parts of the service.      THE TEMPLE CHURCH.    Dr. E. J. Hopkins, himself an ex-choir-boy of the Chapel Royal, realises  here his ideal of \"quality, not quantity.\" He lays stress on the fact  that he takes his boys at eight years of age. For a year or more,  however, they are probationers. They do not wear surplices, although  they sit close to the choir. They undergo daily drill in musical theory  and voice-training, but in church they have no responsibility, and do  little more than listen. When, however, the voice of one of the elder  boys breaks, a probationer takes his place, and is much better for the  training. The practices occupy an hour-and-a-half every afternoon. They  are held in the little choir vestry, near the organ, where there is a  cottage pianoforte, flanked by a couple of long music desks, at which  the boys stand as they sing. They are taught in groups, according to the  stage they have reached, and spend the lesson time in practising scales,  voice exercises, pieces of music, and studying notation. The voices are  practised up to A. On Saturdays there is a rehearsal in the church,  with the organ and the men of the choir.      LINCOLN CATHEDRAL.    The choir here, directed by the venerable organist, Mr. J. W. M. Young,  is noted for its chanting, which all choirmasters ought to hear. Mr.  Young has made a special study of the Psalms, and changes speed and  force frequently with the change of attitude in the psalmist. The  recitation is delivered at the pace of ordinary speech, with  elocutionary pauses as needed; it is sung neither faster nor slower than  the cadence. Hence the whole effect is reverent and impressive. Mr.  Young's published Psalter and Chants (Novello) should be studied, but  the great excellence of his work can only be appreciated by a visit to  Lincoln. All compilers of Psalters make rules, but Mr. Young carries  them out. Mr. Young, who was a choir-boy at Durham more than fifty years  ago, under Henshaw, tells me that it was no uncommon thing in his day  for the boys to have three practices--8.30 to 10, 11 to 12, and 6 to 8.  This in addition to the two daily services. The elder boys had to attend  all; the younger were excused the evening practice. As far as I know, we  have no such severe training now. Mr. Young likes to get his boys at  eight; for two years, although they wear surplices, they do not sing.  The sixteen boys receive free education, and board, pocket-money, and a  present of L10 when their voices break. The younger boys are called  \"choristers,\" and wear surplices. The four senior boys are called  \"Burgersh-chanters,\" and wear black cassocks of a peculiar shape. In the  town they are familiarly known as \"black boys.\" The choristers attend a  day-school with other boys who speak the Lincolnshire dialect; in this  they suffer, for, as Mr. Young says, purity of vowels and beauty of tone  go together. One of his maxims is, \"use the lips as little as possible  in singing; do all you can with the tongue. If you use the lips, then  use them rapidly.\" The boys practise an hour-and-a-half each day. Mr.  Young puts a high finish on all his work. Mozart's \"Ave Verum\" was  sung on the day of my visit with infinite refinement. At one point the  boys took a portamento--a grace which very few choirmasters would  attempt with boys.    [Illustration: A \"BLACK BOY\" AT LINCOLN CATHEDRAL.    _Photographed by Mr. George Hadley, Lincoln._]      CHRIST CHURCH, OXFORD.    The boys rehearse in a small but lofty room. There is a double row of  desks and seats down each side, facing each other. Dr. C. H. Lloyd sits  at a small pianoforte, placed across one end of the seats, thus  commanding all the boys with his eye. The \"tuning-up\" exercises lasted  ten minutes, and began with this exercise to \"ah\":--    [Illustration: KEY C. {|d1:t.l|s.f:m.r|d:r.m|f.s:l.t|d1:-|-:-||]    This exercise, begun in C, was carried up gradually to B[b] above. It  was sung first with a _dim._ going down, and a _cres._ going up, and  then the opposite. Then came an ascending, followed by a descending  scale, similarly varied in key and expression. The next exercise was--    [Illustration: KEY C. {|d.m:r.m |d.m:r.m |d.m:r.m |d:--||]    which was transposed gradually upwards, being sung to \"ah.\" Next a  triplet exercise--    [Illustration: KEY F. d t_1 d r d r to d1 r1 d1 t d1 t]    At the higher part the second trebles sang a third below. Then followed  the chromatic scale, up and down. Dr. Lloyd is not troubled much with  flattening; when it occurs the men are more likely to cause it than the  boys. They habitually sing the Litany, which lasts fifteen minutes,  unaccompanied, and if they flatten at all, it is not more than a  semitone. There is an unaccompanied service once a week. I noticed that  breathing-places were marked in the anthems, and notes likely to give  trouble were marked with a circle. Dr. Lloyd was by no means tied to the  pianoforte during rehearsal, and frequently left his seat, and paced up  and down, beating time while the singing went on. Theoretical questions  on the pieces in hand were addressed to individual boys. These boys are  the sons of professional men, and come from all parts of the country.  There are now three undergraduates at Christ Church, who have been  choir-boys. In the choir, on the day of my visit, was a boy of  seventeen, who had sung for nine years; his voice had not yet begun to  go. The curious custom is observed here of dividing the Psalms (between  Decani and Cantoris) at the colon, instead of at the verse. It requires  great readiness, and for those Psalms which are written in parallelisms,  it is most effective.      CANTERBURY CATHEDRAL.    The boys here are divided into ten choristers and fourteen probationers.  The choristers are on the foundation, and receive a stipend; the  probationers get their schooling only. The choristers wear trencher caps  and gowns; the probationers flannel caps, bearing the arms of the  cathedral. The boys are nearly all from the city; there is no  boarding-school. The lower floor of the choir-school is used for the  ordinary instruction, which is conducted by Mr. Plant, an alto in the  cathedral choir, and the upper floor is used as a music-room. Here the  boys receive four or five lessons a week from Dr. Longhurst, and the  probationers have also a lesson by themselves. All the choristers learn  the violin; this has been the practice for many years. When, at  festivals, there is a band in the cathedral, the strings are made up  largely from old choristers, most of whom go into business in the city.  A system of rotation is adopted; thus, although there are twenty-four  boys, not more than fourteen sing at any one service, the rest are at  work at their ordinary lessons. A considerable drainage of boys takes  place to the King's School, the leading grammar school in Canterbury.  The choristers often leave to enter this school when their voices are in  their prime.    Dr. Longhurst takes the boys very young; as soon after seven as  possible. In choosing a boy, he requires both voice and ear to be good.  Sometimes a boy excels in the one direction and not in the other; he can  sing sweetly, but cannot imitate notes struck at random on the  pianoforte, or else he has a poor voice and a good ear. But both  endowments are necessary for a chorister. Dr. Longhurst, who was himself  a boy at Canterbury, had a compass at that time of two-and-a-half  octaves. As his voice changed he passed from first to second treble,  then sang alto for seven years, and at last settled to tenor. He does  not regard boy altos as desirable in cathedrals, but in parish churches,  where no adult male altos are to be had, they are, no doubt, in place.  Dr. Longhurst tells me that as a result of forty-eight years'  experience, he can tell by the look of a boy whether he will make a  chorister. There is something about the brows and eyes, and general  contour of the face which guides him. He is never mistaken. Some time  since a clergyman with whom Dr. Longhurst happened to be staying,  ridiculed the idea that the musical capability of boys can be judged by  their looks. He took Dr. Longhurst into the village school, and invited  him to pick out the boys of the choir as they sat among others at their  lessons. This Dr. Longhurst did quite correctly. He has no knowledge of  phrenology, and the faculty has come to him simply as the result of long  experience.    On the day of my visit I heard the boys practise in their lofty  music-room. Dr. Longhurst sat at the grand pianoforte, and the boys were  grouped in fours or fives round four music-stands, on which the large  folio voice parts, in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3226"],[0,"Records of Journeys to Venice and the Low Countries (#12)"],[1," ells. I have  also bought four black  Spanish skins, which cost 3 stivers  each, and they come to 34, that makes 10 florins, 2 stivers;  I paid the skinner [furrier] 1 florin to make them up, then  there were two ells of velvet for trimming, 5 florins; also  for silk cord and thread, 34 stivers; then the tailor's  wage, 30 stivers; the camlet which is in the cloak cost 14  1/2 florins, and the boy 5 stivers for a tip.    Cross Sunday after Easter; from this I start a fresh  account. Again paid the doctor 6 stivers; I have gained 53  stivers for works of art, and have taken them for expenses.  On Sunday before Holy Cross Week, Master Joachim [Patinir],  the good landscape painter, asked me to his wedding, and  showed me all honour; there I saw two beautiful plays, the  first was especially pious and devout. I again paid the  doctor 6 stivers, and have changed 1 florin for expenses.    On Sunday after Our Lord's Ascension, Master Dietrich, the  glass painter of Antwerp, invited me and asked many other  people to meet me, and especially among them Alexander, the  goldsmith, a rich, stately man, and we had a splendid  dinner, and they did me great honour. I have done in  charcoal the portrait of Master Marx, the goldsmith, who  lives at Bruges. I bought a broad cap for 36 stivers. I paid  Paul Geiger 1 florin to take my little chest to Nuremberg,  and 4 stivers for the letter. I have taken the portrait of  Ambrosius Hochstatter in charcoal, and I dined with him: I  have dined at least six times with Tomasin. I bought some  wooden dishes and platters for 3 stivers. I have given the  apothecary 12 stivers. I have given two books of the \"Life  of Our Lady,\" one to the foreign surgeon, the other to  Marx's house servant; I also paid the doctor 8 stivers, and  gave 4 stivers for cleaning an old cap. Lost 4 stivers at  play; have given 2 florins for a new cap. I have changed the  old cap because it was clumsy, and have given 6 stivers more  for another.    Painted a portrait of the duke in oils: have made a very  fine and careful portrait in oils of the treasurer, Lorenz  Sterk; it was worth 25 florins. I presented it to him, and  in return he gave me 20 florins, and to Susanna 1 florin for  a tip. Likewise I painted the portrait of Jobst, my host,  very well and carefully in oils; he has now given me [the  portrait I did of him before?] and I have done his wife  again and painted her portrait in oils.    On the Friday before Whitsuntide, 1521, tidings came to me  at Antwerp that Martin Luther had been so treacherously  taken prisoner, for he trusted the Emperor Charles's herald,  who had been granted to him with the Imperial safe conduct,  but as soon as the herald had brought him near Eisenach, to  an unfriendly place, he said that he would not need him any  more and rode away. Immediately there appeared ten knights,  who treacherously carried off the pious man, who had been  betrayed; a man enlightened by the Holy Ghost, a follower of  Christ and of the true Christian faith, and whether he lives  yet or whether they have put him to death, I know not. If he  has suffered, it is for the sake of Christian truth and  because he has fought with the un-Christlike papacy, which  strives with its heavy load of human laws against the  redemption of Christ; and if so, it is that we may be again  robbed and stripped of the fruit of our blood and sweat,  that the same may be shamelessly and scandalously squandered  while poor and sick men must therefore die of hunger. And  this is above all most grievous to me, that God perhaps will  let us remain yet under their false, blind doctrine,  invented and set forth by the men whom they call \"Fathers,\"  through whom the Word of God is in many places falsely  expounded or not taught at all.    [Editor's note: This form of abduction was the usual idea at  the time.  But Luther was really taken by the order of  Frederick the Wise in order to protect him].    O God of Heaven, have pity on us, O Lord Jesus Christ, pray  for Thy people. Deliver us in due time, uphold in us the  right and true Christian Faith. Gather together Thy far  scattered sheep by Thy voice, in the Scripture called Thy  godly Word. Help us that we may know this Thy voice and may  follow no other deceiving call of human error, that we may  not, Lord Jesus Christ, fall away from Thee. Call together  again the sheep of Thy pasture, who are still in part found  in the Roman Church, and with them, too, the Indians,  Muscovites, Russians, and Greeks, who have been thus cut off  by the oppression and pride of the pope and by false  appearance of holiness.    O God, redeem thy poor folk constrained by heavy ban and  edict which it no wise willingly obeys, whereby it is bound  continually to sin against its conscience if it disobeys  them. O God, never hast Thou so heavily burdened a people  under human laws as us poor ones beneath the Roman chair,  who daily long to be free Christians ransomed by Thy blood.    O Highest Heavenly Father, pour into our hearts through Thy  Son Jesus Christ such a light, that we may know thereby  which messenger we are to obey, so that with good conscience  we may lay aside the burdens of others, and may serve Thee,  Eternal Heavenly Father, with free and joyful heart.    And if we lose this man, who has written more clearly than  anyone in a hundred and forty years, and to whom Thou hast  given such an evangelic spirit, we pray Thee, O Heavenly  Father, that Thou give again Thy spirit to another, that he  may gather together anew from all parts the holy Christian  Church, that we may all live again in a pure and Christian  manner, so that from our good works all unbelievers, with  Turks, heathens, and Calicuts, may turn themselves to us and  embrace the Christian faith.    But, Lord, Thou willest, ere Thou judgest, that as Thy Son  Jesus Christ was constrained to die by the hands of the  priests and rise from the dead and after to ascend to  heaven, that so too, in like manner, it should be with Thy  follower, Martin Luther, whose life the pope compasses, with  money, treacherously towards God, him, Thou wilt quicken  again. And as Thou, Lord, ordainedst that Jerusalem should  be destroyed, so wilt Thou also destroy this self-assumed  authority of the Roman chair. O lord, give us thereafter the  new beautified Jerusalem, which descends from heaven,  whereof the Apocalypse writes, the holy pure gospel which is  not darkened by human doctrine.    Whoever reads Martin Luther's books may see how clear and  transparent his doctrine is, for he teaches the Holy Gospel.  Wherefore his writings are to be held in the greatest  honour, and not to be burned; unless, indeed, his opponents,  who always fight against the truth, were also cast into the  fire with all their opinions, they who would make gods out  of men, but then only if there were printed new Lutheran  books.    \"O God, if Luther be dead, who will henceforth expound the  Holy Gospel so clearly to us! Ah, God, what might he not  have written for us in the next ten or twenty years!\" Oh,  all ye pious Christian men, help me to lament this God-  inspired man and pray to Him that He will send us another  enlightened man.    Oh, Erasmus of Rotterdam, where wilt thou stay? Dost thou  see how the unjust tyranny of worldly power and the might of  darkness prevail? Hear, thou knight of Christ, ride on  beside the Lord Jesus; guard the truth, win the martyr's  crown! Thou art already only a little old man, and I have  heard thee say that thou givest thyself but two years more  in which thou mayest avail to accomplish something. Lay out  the same now well for the gospel and the true Christian  Faith and make thyself heard, so shall the gates of hell,  the Roman Chair, as Christ says, in no wise prevail against  thee: and if here, like thy Master Christ, thou were to  suffer shame at the hands of the liars of this time and  therefore were to die a little sooner, the sooner wouldst  thou come from death into life and be glorified through  Christ. For if thou drinkest out of the cup whereof He  drank, with Him thou shalt reign, and judge with justice  those who have dealt unrighteously.    Oh, Erasmus, hold to this, that God may be thy praise, even  as it is written of David, for verily thou mayest overthrow  Goliath. For God stands by the Holy Christian Church, as He  only upholds the Romish Church according to His Godly will  [text here corrupt]. May He help us to everlasting  happiness, Who is God the Father, the Son, and the Holy  Ghost, one God, Amen.    Oh, ye Christian men, pray God for help, for His judgment  draws near and His justice shall appear. Then shall we  behold the innocent blood which the pope, priests, bishops,  and monks have shed, judged and condemned.    Apocalypse: \"These are the slain who lie beneath the altar  of God and cry for vengeance, to whom the voice of God  answers, Await the full number of the innocent slain, then  will I judge.\"    Again changed 1 florin for expenses, and gave the doctor 8  stivers; dined twice with Rodrigo; dined with the rich  canon; changed 1 florin for expenses. I had Master Conrad,  the sculptor of Mechlin, as a guest on Whitsunday; paid 18  stivers for Italian prints: again 6 stivers to the doctor.  For Master Joachim I have drawn four \"St. Christophers\" on  gray paper, heightened with white.    On the last day of Whitsuntide I was at Antwerp at the great  yearly horsefair; there I saw a great number of beautiful  stallions ridden, and two stallions in particular were sold  for 700 florins. I have taken 1 florin, 3 ort, for prints  and used the money for expenses; 4 stivers to the doctor, 3  stivers for two little books. I have dined thrice with  Tomasin. I have designed three dagger grips for him, and he  gave me a small alabaster bowl. I have taken the portrait in  charcoal of an English nobleman, who gave me 1 florin which  I changed for expenses.
