St. Aubert began to look out for the little town he had been directed to  by the people of Beaujeu, and where he meant to pass the night; but no  habitation yet appeared. Of its distance Valancourt could not assist him  to judge, for he had never been so far along this chain of Alps before.  There was, however, a road to guide them; and there could be little  doubt that it was the right one; for, since they had left Beaujeu, there  had been no variety of tracks to perplex or mislead.    The sun now gave his last light, and St. Aubert bade the muleteer  proceed with all possible dispatch. He found, indeed, the lassitude of  illness return upon him, after a day of uncommon fatigue, both of body  and mind, and he longed for repose. His anxiety was not soothed by  observing a numerous train, consisting of men, horses, and loaded  mules, winding down the steeps of an opposite mountain, appearing and  disappearing at intervals among the woods, so that its numbers could not  be judged of. Something bright, like arms, glanced in the setting ray,  and the military dress was distinguishable upon the men who were in the  van, and on others scattered among the troop that followed. As these  wound into the vale, the rear of the party emerged from the woods, and  exhibited a band of soldiers. St. Aubert's apprehensions now subsided;  he had no doubt that the train before him consisted of smugglers, who,  in conveying prohibited goods over the Pyrenees, had been encountered,  and conquered by a party of troops.    The travellers had lingered so long among the sublimer scenes of  these mountains, that they found themselves entirely mistaken in their  calculation that they could reach Montigny at sun-set; but, as they  wound along the valley, the saw, on a rude Alpine bridge, that united  two lofty crags of the glen, a group of mountaineer-children, amusing  themselves with dropping pebbles into a torrent below, and watching the  stones plunge into the water, that threw up its white spray high in the  air as it received them, and returned a sullen sound, which the echoes  of the mountains prolonged. Under the bridge was seen a perspective of  the valley, with its cataract descending among the rocks, and a cottage  on a cliff, overshadowed with pines. It appeared, that they could not  be far from some small town. St. Aubert bade the muleteer stop, and  then called to the children to enquire if he was near Montigny; but the  distance, and the roaring of the waters, would not suffer his voice to  be heard; and the crags, adjoining the bridge, were of such tremendous  height and steepness, that to have climbed either would have been  scarcely practicable to a person unacquainted with the ascent. St.  Aubert, therefore, did not waste more moments in delay. They continued  to travel long after twilight had obscured the road, which was so  broken, that, now thinking it safer to walk than to ride, they all  alighted. The moon was rising, but her light was yet too feeble to  assist them. While they stepped carefully on, they heard the vesper-bell  of a convent. The twilight would not permit them to distinguish anything  like a building, but the sounds seemed to come from some woods, that  overhung an acclivity to the right. Valancourt proposed to go in  search of this convent. 'If they will not accommodate us with a night's  lodging,' said he, 'they may certainly inform us how far we are from  Montigny, and direct us towards it.' He was bounding forward, without  waiting St. Aubert's reply, when the latter stopped him. 'I am very  weary,' said St. Aubert, 'and wish for nothing so much as for immediate  rest. We will all go to the convent; your good looks would defeat our  purpose; but when they see mine and Emily's exhausted countenances, they  will scarcely deny us repose.'    As he said this, he took Emily's arm within his, and, telling Michael to  wait awhile in the road with the carriage, they began to ascend towards  the woods, guided by the bell of the convent. His steps were feeble, and  Valancourt offered him his arm, which he accepted. The moon now threw  a faint light over their path, and, soon after, enabled them to  distinguish some towers rising above the tops of the woods. Still  following the note of the bell, they entered the shade of those woods,  lighted only by the moonbeams, that glided down between the leaves,  and threw a tremulous uncertain gleam upon the steep track they were  winding. The gloom and the silence that prevailed, except when the bell  returned upon the air, together with the wildness of the surrounding  scene, struck Emily with a degree of fear, which, however, the voice and  conversation of Valancourt somewhat repressed. When they had been some  time ascending, St. Aubert complained of weariness, and they stopped to  rest upon a little green summit, where the trees opened, and admitted  the moon-light. He sat down upon the turf, between Emily and Valancourt.  The bell had now ceased, and the deep repose of the scene was  undisturbed by any sound, for the low dull murmur of some distant  torrents might be said to sooth, rather than to interrupt, the silence.    Before them, extended the valley they had quitted; its rocks, and woods  to the left, just silvered by the rays, formed a contrast to the deep  shadow, that involved the opposite cliffs, whose fringed summits only  were tipped with light; while the distant perspective of the valley was  lost in the yellow mist of moon-light. The travellers sat for some time  wrapt in the complacency which such scenes inspire.    'These scenes,' said Valancourt, at length, 'soften the heart, like the  notes of sweet music, and inspire that delicious melancholy which no  person, who had felt it once, would resign for the gayest pleasures.  They waken our best and purest feelings, disposing us to benevolence,  pity, and friendship. Those whom I love--I always seem to love more in  such an hour as this.' His voice trembled, and he paused.    St. Aubert was silent; Emily perceived a warm tear fall upon the hand he  held; she knew the object of his thoughts; hers too had, for some time,  been occupied by the remembrance of her mother. He seemed by an effort  to rouse himself. 'Yes,' said he, with an half-suppressed sigh, 'the  memory of those we love--of times for ever past! in such an hour as this  steals upon the mind, like a strain of distant music in the stillness  of night;--all tender and harmonious as this landscape, sleeping in the  mellow moon-light.' After the pause of a moment, St. Aubert added, 'I  have always fancied, that I thought with more clearness, and precision,  at such an hour than at any other, and that heart must be insensible  in a great degree, that does not soften to its influence. But many such  there are.'    Valancourt sighed.    'Are there, indeed, many such?' said Emily.    'A few years hence, my Emily,' replied St. Aubert, 'and you may smile at  the recollection of that question--if you do not weep to it. But come, I  am somewhat refreshed, let us proceed.'    Having emerged from the woods, they saw, upon a turfy hillock above, the  convent of which they were in search. A high wall, that surrounded it,  led them to an ancient gate, at which they knocked; and the poor monk,  who opened it, conducted them into a small adjoining room, where he  desired they would wait while he informed the superior of their request.  In this interval, several friars came in separately to look at them;  and at length the first monk returned, and they followed him to a room,  where the superior was sitting in an arm-chair, with a large folio  volume, printed in black letter, open on a desk before him. He received  them with courtesy, though he did not rise from his seat; and, having  asked them a few questions, granted their request. After a short  conversation, formal and solemn on the part of the superior, they  withdrew to the apartment where they were to sup, and Valancourt, whom  one of the inferior friars civilly desired to accompany, went to seek  Michael and his mules. They had not descended half way down the cliffs,  before they heard the voice of the muleteer echoing far and wide.  Sometimes he called on St. Aubert, and sometimes on Valancourt; who  having, at length, convinced him that he had nothing to fear either for  himself, or his master; and having disposed of him, for the night, in a  cottage on the skirts of the woods, returned to sup with his friends,  on such sober fare as the monks thought it prudent to set before them.  While St. Aubert was too much indisposed to share it, Emily, in her  anxiety for her father, forgot herself; and Valancourt, silent and  thoughtful, yet never inattentive to them, appeared particularly  solicitous to accommodate and relieve St. Aubert, who often observed,  while his daughter was pressing him to eat, or adjusting the pillow she  had placed in the back of his arm-chair, that Valancourt fixed on her a  look of pensive tenderness, which he was not displeased to understand.    They separated at an early hour, and retired to their respective  apartments. Emily was shown to hers by a nun of the convent, whom she  was glad to dismiss, for her heart was melancholy, and her attention  so much abstracted, that conversation with a stranger was painful. She  thought her father daily declining, and attributed his present fatigue  more to the feeble state of his frame, than to the difficulty of the  journey. A train of gloomy ideas haunted her mind, till she fell asleep.    In about two hours after, she was awakened by the chiming of a bell, and  then heard quick steps pass along the gallery, into which her chamber  opened. She was so little accustomed to the manners of a convent, as to  be alarmed by this circumstance;"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32706"],[0,"Triplanetary (#12)"],[1,"from the surface of the brook. Steam! Steam from the  cooling jacket of that Maxim 1907! And there was the tube!    Cautiously he moved around until he could trace that tube to its  business end--the carefully-hidden emplacement. There it was! He  couldn't maintain his westward course without them spotting him; nor  could he go around far enough. And besides ... and besides that, there  would be at least a patrol, if it hadn't gone up the hill already. And  there were grenades available, right close....    He crept up to one of the gruesome objects he had been avoiding, and  when he crept away he half-carried, half-dragged three grenades in a  canvas bag. He wormed his way to a certain boulder. He straightened up,  pulled three pins, swung his arm three times.    Bang! Bam! Pow! The camouflage disappeared; so did the shrubbery for  yards around. Kinnison had ducked behind the rock, but he ducked still  deeper as a chunk of something, its force pretty well spent, clanged  against his steel helmet. Another object thudded beside him--a leg,  gray-clad and wearing a heavy field boot!    Kinnison wanted to be sick again, but he had neither the time nor the  contents.    And damn! What _lousy_ throwing! He had never been any good at baseball,  but he supposed that he could hit a thing as big as that gun-pit--but  not one of his grenades had gone in. The crew would probably be  dead--from concussion, if nothing else--but the gun probably wasn't even  hurt. He would have to go over there and cripple it himself.    He went--not exactly boldly--forty-five in hand. The Germans looked  dead. One of them sprawled on the parapet, right in his way. He gave the  body a shove, watched it roll down the slope. As it rolled, however, it  came to life and yelled; and at that yell there occurred a thing at  which young Kinnison's hair stood straight up inside his iron helmet. On  the gray of the blasted hillside hitherto unseen gray forms moved; moved  toward their howling comrade. And Kinnison, blessing for the first time  in his life his inept throwing arm, hoped fervently that the Maxim was  still in good working order.    A few seconds of inspection showed him that it was. The gun had  practically a full belt and there was plenty more. He placed a box--he  would have no Number Two to help him here--took hold of the grips,  shoved off the safety, and squeezed the trip. The gun roared--what a  gorgeous, what a heavenly racket that Maxim made! He traversed until he  could see where the bullets were striking: then swung the stream of  metal to and fro. One belt and the Germans were completely disorganized;  two belts and he could see no signs of life.    He pulled the Maxim's block and threw it away; shot the water-jacket  full of holes. That gun was done. Nor had he increased his own hazard.  Unless more Germans came very soon, nobody would ever know who had done  what, or to whom.    He slithered away; resumed earnestly his westward course: going as fast  as--sometimes a trifle faster than--caution would permit. But there were  no more alarms. He crossed the dangerously open ground; sulked rapidly  through the frightfully shattered wood. He reached the road, strode  along it around the first bend, and stopped, appalled. He had heard of  such things, but he had never seen one; and mere description has always  been and always will be completely inadequate. Now he was walking right  into it--the thing he was to see in nightmare for all the rest of his  ninety-six years of life.    Actually, there was very little to see. The road ended abruptly. What  had been a road, what had been wheatfields and farms, what had been  woods, were practically indistinguishable, one from the other; were  fantastically and impossibly the same. The entire area had been churned.  Worse--it was as though the ground and its every surface object had been  run through a gargantuan mill and spewed abroad. Splinters of wood,  riven chunks of metal, a few scraps of bloody flesh. Kinnison screamed,  then, and ran; ran back and around that blasted acreage. And as he ran,  his mind built up pictures; pictures which became only the more vivid  because of his frantic efforts to wipe them out.    That road, the night before, had been one of the world's most heavily  traveled highways. Motorcycles, trucks, bicycles. Ambulances. Kitchens.  Staff-cars and other automobiles. Guns; from seventy-fives up to the big  boys, whose tremendous weight drove their wide caterpillar treads inches  deep into solid ground. Horses. Mules. And people--_especially_  people--like himself. Solid columns of men, marching as fast as they  could step--there weren't trucks enough to haul them all. That road had  been crowded--jammed. Like State and Madison at noon, only more so.  Over-jammed with all the personnel, all the instrumentation and  incidentalia, all the weaponry, of war.    And upon that teeming, seething highway there had descended a rain of  steel-encased high explosive. Possibly some gas, but probably not. The  German High Command had given orders to pulverize that particular area  at that particular time; and hundreds, or perhaps thousands, of German  guns, in a micrometrically-synchronized symphony of firepower, had  pulverized it. Just that. Literally. Precisely. No road remained; no  farm, no field, no building, no tree or shrub. The bits of flesh might  have come from horse or man or mule; few indeed were the scraps of metal  which retained enough of their original shape to show what they had once  been.    Kinnison ran--or staggered--around that obscene blot and struggled back  to the road. It was shell-pocked, but passable. He hoped that the  shell-holes would decrease in number as he went along, but they did not.  The enemy had put this whole road out of service. And that farm, the  P.C., ought to be around the next bend.    It was, but it was no longer a Post of Command. Either by directed  fire--star-shell illumination--or by uncannily accurate chart-work, they  had put some heavy shell exactly where they would do the most damage.  The buildings were gone; the cellar in which the P.C. had been was now a  gaping crater. Parts of motorcycles and of staff cars littered the  ground. Stark tree trunks--all bare of leaves, some riven of all except  the largest branches, a few stripped even of bark--stood gauntly. In a  crotch of one, Kinnison saw with rising horror, hung the limp and  shattered naked torso of a man; blown completely out of his clothes.    Shells were--had been, right along--coming over occasionally. Big ones,  but high; headed for targets well to the west. Nothing close enough to  worry about. Two ambulances, a couple of hundred meters apart, were  coming; working their way along the road, between the holes. The first  one slowed ... stopped.    \"Seen anybody--Look out! Duck!\"    Kinnison had already heard that unmistakable, unforgettable screech, was  already diving headlong into the nearest hole. There was a crash as  though the world were falling apart. Something smote him; seemed to  drive him bodily into the ground. His light went out. When he recovered  consciousness he was lying upon a stretcher; two men were bending over  him.    \"What hit me?\" he gasped. \"Am I...?\" He stopped. He was afraid to ask:  afraid even to try to move, lest he should find that he didn't have any  arms or legs.    \"A wheel, and maybe some of the axle, of the other ambulance, is all,\"  one of the men assured him. \"Nothing much; you're practically as good as  ever. Shoulder and arm bunged up a little and something--maybe shrapnel,  though--poked you in the guts. But we've got you all fixed up, so take  it easy and....\"    \"What we want to know is,\" his partner interrupted, \"Is there anybody  else alive up here?\"    \"Uh-huh,\" Kinnison shook his head.    \"O.K. Just wanted to be sure. Lots of business back there, and it won't  do any harm to have a doctor look at you.\"    \"Get me to a 'phone, as fast as you can,\" Kinnison directed, in a voice  which he thought was strong and full of authority, but which in fact  was neither. \"I've got an important message for General Weatherby, at  Spearmint.\"    \"Better tell us what it is, hadn't you?\" The ambulance was now jolting  along what had been the road. \"They've got phones at the hospital where  we're going, but you might faint or something before we get there.\"    Kinnison told, but fought to retain what consciousness he had.  Throughout that long, rough ride he fought. He won. He himself spoke to  General Weatherby--the doctors, knowing him to be a Captain of Aviation  and realizing that his message should go direct, helped him telephone.  He himself received the General's sizzlingly sulphurous assurance that  relief would be sent and that that quadruply-qualified line would be  rectified that night.    Then someone jabbed him with a needle and he lapsed into a dizzy, fuzzy  coma, from which he did not emerge completely for weeks. He had lucid  intervals at times, but he did not, at the time or ever, know surely  what was real and what was fantasy.    There were doctors, doctors, doctors; operations, operations,  operations. There were hospital tents, into which quiet men were  carried; from which still quieter men were removed. There was a larger  hospital, built of wood. There was a machine that buzzed and white-clad  men who studied films and papers. There were scraps of conversation.    \"Belly wounds are bad,\" Kinnison thought--he was never sure--that he  heard one of them say. \"And such contusions and multiple and compound  fractures as those don't help a bit. Prognosis unfavorable--distinctly  so--but we'll soon see what we can do. Interesting case ... fascinating.  What would you do, Doctor, if you were doing it?\"    \"I'd let it alone!\" A younger, stronger voice declared, fervently.  \"Multiple perforations, infection, extravasation, oedema--uh-uh! I am  watching, Doctor, and learning!\"    Another interlude, and another."]]]
