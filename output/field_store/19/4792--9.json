More than one hardy traveller, before the age of automobiles, and  even before the age of steam, has made \"the grand tour,\" and then  come home and written a book about it until there seems hardly any  need that a modern traveller should attempt to set down his  impressions of the craggy, castled Rhine, the splendid desolation of  Pompeii, or the romantic reminders still left in old Provence to tell  the story of the days of the troubadours and the \"Courts of Love.\"    It is conceivable that one can see and enjoy all these classic  splendours from an automobile, but automobilists from overseas have  been known to rush across France in an attempt to break the record  between some Channel port and Monte Carlo, or dash down the Rhine and  into Switzerland for a few days, and so on to Rome, and ultimately  Naples, where ship is taken for home in the western world.    This is, at any rate, the itinerary of many a self-made millionaire  who thinks to enjoy himself between strenuous intervals of  international business affairs. It is a pity he does not go slower  and see more.    The real grand tour, or, as the French call it, the \"_Circuit  Europeen,_\" may well begin at Paris, and descend through Poitou to  Biarritz, along the French slope of the Pyrenees, finally skirting  the Mediterranean coast by Marseilles and Monte Carlo, thence to  Genoa, in Italy, and north to Milan, finally reaching Vienna. This  city is generally considered the outpost of comfortable automobile  touring, and rightly so, for the difficulty of getting gasoline and  oil, along the route, and such small necessities as an automobile  requires, continually oppresses one, and dampens his enthusiasm for  the beauties of nature, the fascination of historic shrines, or the  worship of art, the three chief things for which the most of us  travel, unless we be mere vagabonds, and journey about for the sheer  love of being on the move. From Vienna to Prague, to Breslau, to  Berlin, Hanover, and Cologne, and finally to Paris via Reims finishes  the \"_circuit,_\" which for variety and excellence of the roads cannot  elsewhere be equalled.    This, or something very near to it, would be the very best possible  course for a series of reliability trials, and certainly nothing  quite so suitable or enjoyable for the participants could otherwise  be found. It is much better than a mere pegging away round and round  a two hundred and fifty kilometre circuit, as some trials and races  have been run. In all the distance is something like five thousand  kilometres, which easily divides itself into stages of two hundred  kilometres daily, and gives one an enjoyable twenty-five days or a  month of travel, which, in all its illuminating variety, is far and  away ahead of the benefits our forefathers derived from the box seat  of a diligence or a post-chaise.    On this trip one runs the whole gamut of the European climate, and  eats the food of Paris, of the Midi, of Italy, Austria, and Germany,  and wonders why it is that he likes the last one partaken of the  best. Given a faultlessly running automobile (and there are many  today which can do the work under these conditions) and no tire  troubles, and one could hardly improve upon the poetry of motion  which enables one to eat up the long silent stretches of roadway in  La Beauce or the Landes, to climb the gentle slopes skirting the  Pyrenees, or the ruder ones of Northern Italy, until finally he makes  that bee-line across half of Europe, from Berlin to Paris. One's  impressions of places when touring _en automobile_ are apt to be  hazy; like those of the energetic American who, when asked if he had  been to Rome, replied, \"Why, yes; that's where I bought my panama  _(sic)_ hat!\"    Such a \"grand tour\" as outlined by the \"_Circuit Europeen_\" presents  a variety which it is impossible to equal. It is a tour which  embraces country widely differing in characteristics--one which takes  in both the long, broad, ribbon-like roads of Central France, flanked  by meadows, orchards, and farmsteads, and lofty mountains from the  peaks of which other peaks capped with glistening snow may be gazed  upon, sunlit valleys and sparkling lakes. It is a tour which no man  could possibly make without a good machine, and yet it is a tour  which, with a good machine, can be considered easy and comparatively  inexpensive.    One does not require a car with excessive horsepower for the trip,  though he does need a machine which has been carefully constructed  and adjusted, and above all he must guard carefully that his motor  does not overheat, for the hills are stiff for the most part.    When touring on an itinerary as varied as that here indicated one  should have anti-skidding tires on the rear wheels, take descents  with care, and, if you be the owner of a powerful machine, do not  make that an excuse for rushing up the tortuous, twisting, and  frightfully dangerous roads, banked by a cliff on one hand, and by a  precipice on the other, which abound in all mountainous regions.    In taking turnings on such roads also always keep to the right, even  if this necessitates slowing down at the bends. One never knows what  is descending, and in such parts slow-moving carts drawn by cattle  are numerous, and generally keep the middle of the road. Most of the  automobile accidents which take place on mountain roads are due to  this swishing round bends, heedless of what may be on the other side,  and in allowing one's machine to gather too much speed on the long  descents. This is gospel! There is both sport and pleasure to be had  from such an itinerary as this, but it is a serious affair, for one  has to have a lookout for many things that are unthought of in a two  hours' afternoon suburban promenade. The _chauffeur_, be he  professional or amateur, who brings his automobile back from the  _Circuit Europeen_ under its own power is entitled to be called  expert.    As for the value to automobilism of this great trial one can hardly  overestimate it. There is no place here for the freak machine or  scorching _chauffeur_, such as one has found in many great events of  the past. A great touring contest over such a course would be bound  to have important results in many ways. The ordinary class of  _circuit_ is a very close approach to a racing-track, with gasoline  and tire stations established at many points of the course. On the  European Circuit such advantages would be out of the question,  everything would have to be taken as it exists naturally. In a sense,  such a competition would be a return to the contests organized in the  early days of the automobile, the Paris-Bordeaux and Paris-Berlin  races, when the driver had ever to be on the alert for unforeseen  difficulties unknown on the racing-circuit as understood in recent  years.    To follow the _Circuit Europeen_ one traverses France, Italy,  Austria, Germany, and Belgium; and one may readily enough, if time  and inclination permit, get also a glimpse of Spain, Switzerland, and  Holland. Generally the automobile tourist has confined his trip to  France, as properly he might, but, if he would go further afield, the  European Circuit, as it has become classically known, is an itinerary  vouched for as to its practicability and interest by the allied  automobile and touring clubs of many lands.    France is still far in the lead in the accommodation which it offers  to the automobilist, but Germany has made great strides of late, and  the other frontier boundary states have naturally followed suit.  Roads improvement in Germany has gone on at a wonderful rate of late,  due, it is said, to the interest of the German emperor in the  automobile industry, both from a sportive and a very practical side.    From Paris to the Italian frontier one finds the roads uniformly  excellent; but, as one enters Italy, they deteriorate somewhat,  except along the frontiers, where, curiously enough, nations seem to  vie with each other in a careful maintenance of the highroads, which  is, of course, laudable. This is probably due to strategic military  reasons, but so long as it benefits the automobilist he will not cry  out for disarmament.    The Austrian roads are fair--near Vienna and Prague they are quite  good; but they are dangerous with deep ditches and gullies which the  French know as _canivaux_, the Austrians by some unpronounceable  name, and the Anglo-Saxon as \"thank-you-marms.\" From Prague to  Breslau the roads are twisting and turning, and large stones jut here  and there above the actual road level. This is a real danger, a very  considerable annoyance. From Breslau to Potsdam one gets as dusty a  bit of road travelling as he will find in all Europe. One side of the  road only is stone-rolled, the other apparently being merely loose  sand, or some variety of dust which whirls up in clouds and even  penetrates one's tightly closed bags and boxes. Hanover, the home of  Continental tires, is surrounded in every direction with execrable  cobblestones, or whatever the German equivalent is--\"pflaster,\" the  writer thinks. Probably the makers of the excellent tires for  automobiles have nothing to do with the existence of this awful  _pave_, and perhaps if you accused them of it they would repair your  tires without charge! The writer does not know.    From Hanover to Minden the roads improve, and when one actually  strikes the trail of Napoleon he finds the roads better and better.  Napoleon nearly broke up Europe, or saved it--the critics do not  agree, but he was the greatest road-builder since the Romans.    Finally, crossing the Rhine at Cologne and passing through Belgium,  one enters France by the valley of the Meuse.    One of the most remarkable tours was that undertaken in 1904 by  Georges Cormier, in a tiny six horse-power De Dion Populaire. He left  the Automobile Club de France in mid-October for Sens, his first  stop, 101 kilometres from "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26046"],[0,"Bird Stories from Burroughs (#12)"],[1,"yarn that  gave me so much trouble.\"     [Illustration: BALTIMORE ORIOLE   Upper, male; lower, female]    One day in Kentucky I saw an oriole weave into her nest unusual  material. As we sat upon the lawn in front of the cottage, we had  noticed the bird just beginning her structure, suspending it from a  long, low branch of the Kentucky coffee-tree that grew but a few feet  away. I suggested to my host that if he would take some brilliant yarn  and scatter it about upon the shrubbery, the fence, and the walks, the  bird would probably avail herself of it, and weave a novel nest. I had  heard of its being done, but had never tried it myself. The suggestion  was at once acted upon, and in a few moments a handful of zephyr yarn,  crimson, orange, green, yellow, and blue, was distributed about the  grounds. As we sat at dinner a few moments later, I saw the eager bird  flying up toward her nest with one of these brilliant yarns streaming  behind her. They had caught her eye at once, and she fell to work upon  them with a will; not a bit daunted by their brilliant color, she soon  had a crimson spot there amid the green leaves. She afforded us rare  amusement all the afternoon and the next morning. How she seemed to  congratulate herself over her rare find! How vigorously she knotted  those strings to her branch and gathered the ends in and sewed them  through and through the structure, jerking them spitefully like a  housewife burdened with many cares! How savagely she would fly at her  neighbor, an oriole that had a nest just over the fence a few yards  away, when she invaded her territory! The male looked on approvingly,  but did not offer to lend a hand. There is something in the manner of  the female on such occasions, something so decisive and emphatic, that  one entirely approves of the course of the male in not meddling or  offering any suggestions. It is the wife's enterprise, and she evidently  knows her own mind so well that the husband keeps aloof, or plays the  part of an approving spectator.    The woolen yarn was ill-suited to the Kentucky climate. This fact the  bird seemed to appreciate, for she used it only in the upper part of  her nest, in attaching it to the branch and in binding and compacting  the rim, making the sides and bottom of hemp, leaving it thin and airy,  much more so than are the same nests with us. No other bird would,  perhaps, have used such brilliant material; their instincts of  concealment would have revolted, but the oriole aims more to make its  nest inaccessible than to hide it. Its position and depth insure its  safety.          THE WHIP-POOR-WILL      One day in May, walking in the woods, I came upon the nest of a  whip-poor-will, or rather its eggs, for it builds no nest,--two  elliptical whitish spotted eggs lying upon the dry leaves. My foot was  within a yard of the mother bird before she flew. I wondered what a  sharp eye would detect curious or characteristic in the ways of the  bird, so I came to the place many times and had a look. It was always a  task to separate the bird from her surroundings, though I stood within a  few feet of her, and knew exactly where to look. One had to bear on with  his eye, as it were, and refuse to be baffled. The sticks and leaves,  and bits of black or dark-brown bark, were all exactly copied in the  bird's plumage. And then she did sit so close, and simulate so well a  shapeless, decaying piece of wood or bark! Twice I brought a companion,  and, guiding his eye to the spot, noted how difficult it was for him to  make out there, in full view upon the dry leaves, any semblance to a  bird. When the bird returned after being disturbed, she would alight  within a few inches of her eggs, and then, after a moment's pause,  hobble awkwardly upon them.    [Illustration: WHIP-POOR-WILL]    After the young had appeared, all the wit of the bird came into play. I  was on hand the next day, I think. The mother bird sprang up when I was  within a pace of her, and in doing so fanned the leaves with her wings  till they sprang up, too; as the leaves started the young started, and  as they were of the same color, to tell which was the leaf and which the  bird was a trying task to any eye. I came the next day, when the same  tactics were repeated. Once a leaf fell upon one of the young birds and  nearly hid it. The young are covered with a reddish down, like a young  partridge, and soon follow their mother about. When disturbed, they gave  but one leap, then settled down, perfectly motionless and stupid, with  eyes closed. The parent bird, on these occasions, made frantic efforts  to decoy me away from her young. She would fly a few paces and fall upon  her breast, and a spasm, like that of death, would run through her  tremulous outstretched wings and prostrate body. She kept a sharp eye  out the mean while to see if the ruse took, and, if it did not, she was  quickly cured, and, moving about to some other point, tried to draw my  attention as before. When followed she always alighted upon the ground,  dropping down in a sudden, peculiar way. The second or third day both  old and young had disappeared.    The whip-poor-will walks as awkwardly as a swallow, which is as awkward  as a man in a bag, and yet she manages to lead her young about the  woods. The latter, I think, move by leaps and sudden spurts, their  protective coloring shielding them most effectively.           *       *       *       *       *    As the shadows deepen and the stars begin to come out, the  whip-poor-will suddenly strikes up. What a rude intrusion upon the  serenity and harmony of the hour! A cry without music, insistent,  reiterated, loud, penetrating, and yet the ear welcomes it; the night  and the solitude are so vast that they can stand it; and when, an hour  later, as the night enters into full possession, the bird comes and  serenades me under my window or upon my doorstep, my heart warms toward  it. Its cry is a love-call, and there is something of the ardor and  persistence of love in it, and when the female responds, and comes and  hovers near, there is an interchange of subdued, caressing tones between  the two birds that it is a delight to hear. During my first summer in my  cabin one bird used to strike up every night from a high ledge of rocks  in front of my door. At just such a moment in the twilight he would  begin, the first to break the stillness. Then the others would follow,  till the solitude was vocal with their calls. They are rarely heard  later than ten o'clock. Then at daybreak they take up the tale again,  whipping poor Will till one pities him. One April morning between three  and four o'clock, hearing one strike up near my window, I began counting  its calls. My neighbor had told me he had heard one call over two  hundred times without a break, which seemed to me a big story. But I  have a much bigger one to tell. This bird actually laid upon the back of  poor Will one thousand and eighty-eight blows, with only a barely  perceptible pause here and there, as if to catch its breath. Then it  stopped about half a minute and began again, uttering this time three  hundred and ninety calls, when it paused, flew a little farther away,  took up the tale once more, and continued till I fell asleep.    By day the whip-poor-will apparently sits motionless upon the ground. A  few times in my walks through the woods I have started one up from  almost under my feet. On such occasions the bird's movements suggest  those of a bat; its wings make no noise, and it wavers about in an  uncertain manner, and quickly drops to the ground again. One June day we  flushed an old one with her two young, but there was no indecision or  hesitation in the manner of the mother bird this time. The young were  more than half fledged, and they scampered away a few yards and  suddenly squatted upon the ground, where their assimilative coloring  rendered them almost invisible. Then the anxious parent put forth all  her arts to absorb our attention and lure us away from her offspring.  She flitted before us from side to side, with spread wings and tail, now  falling upon the ground, where she would remain a moment as if quite  disabled, then perching upon an old stump or low branch with drooping,  quivering wings, and imploring us by every gesture to take her and spare  her young. My companion had his camera with him, but the bird would not  remain long enough in one position for him to get her picture.          THE BLACK-THROATED BLUE WARBLER    A SEARCH FOR A RARE NEST      I had set out in hopes of finding a rare nest,--the nest of the  black-throated blue-backed warbler, which, it seemed, with one or two  others, was still wanting to make the history of our warblers complete.  The woods were extensive, and full of deep, dark tangles, and looking  for any particular nest seemed about as hopeless a task as searching for  a needle in a haystack, as the old saying is. Where to begin, and how?  But the principle is the same as in looking for a hen's nest,--first  find your bird, then watch its movements.    The bird is in these woods, for I have seen him scores of times, but  whether he builds high or low, on the ground or in the trees, is all  unknown to me. That is his song now,--\"twe-twea-twe-e-e-a,\" with a  peculiar summer languor and plaintiveness, and issuing from the lower  branches and growths. Presently we--for I have been joined by a  companion--discover the bird, a male, insecting in the top of a newly  fallen hemlock. The black, white, and blue of his uniform are seen at a  glance. His movements are quite slow compared with some of the warblers.  If he will only betray the locality of that little domicile where his  plainly clad mate is evidently sitting, it is all we will ask of him.  But this he seems in no wise disposed to do. Here and there, and up and  down, we follow him, often losing him, and as often refinding him by his  song; but the clew to his"]]]
