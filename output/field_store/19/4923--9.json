[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3317"],[0,"Now It Can Be Told (#12)"],[1,"was almost  a caricature of an old-time British general, with his ruddy,  pippin-cheeked face, with white hair, and a fierce little white  mustache, and blue, watery eyes, and a little pot-belly and short  legs. He puffed and panted when he walked, and after two minutes in his  company Cyril Maude would have played him to perfection. The staff-work  of his army was as good in detail as any machinery of war may be, and  the tactical direction of the Second Army battles was not slipshod nor  haphazard, as so many others, but prepared with minute attention to  detail and after thoughtful planning of the general scheme. The battle  of Wytschaete and Messines was a model in organization and method, and  worked in its frightful destructiveness like the clockwork of a death  machine. Even the battles of Flanders in the autumn of '17, ghastly as  they were in the losses of our men in the state of the ground through  which they had to fight, and in futile results, were well organized by  the Second Army headquarters, compared with the abominable mismanagement  of other troops, the contrast being visible to every battalion officer  and even to the private soldier. How much share of this was due to Sir  Herbert Plumer it is impossible for me to tell, though it is fair to  give him credit for soundness of judgment in general ideas and in the  choice of men.    He had for his chief of staff Sir John Harington, and beyond all doubt  this general was the organizing brain of to Second Army, though with  punctilious chivalry he gave, always, the credit of all his work to  the army commander. A thin, nervous, highly strung man, with extreme  simplicity of manner and clarity of intelligence, he impressed me as a  brain of the highest temper and quality in staff-work. His memory for  detail was like a card-index system, yet his mind was not clogged with  detail, but saw the wood as well as the trees, and the whole broad sweep  of the problem which confronted him. There was something fascinating as  well as terrible in his exposition of a battle that he was planning. For  the first time in his presence and over his maps, I saw that after all  there was such a thing as the science of war, and that it was not always  a fetish of elementary ideas raised to the nth degree of pomposity, as  I had been led to believe by contact with other generals and  staff-officers. Here at least was a man who dealt with it as a  scientific business, according to the methods of science--calculating  the weight and effect of gun-fire, the strength of the enemy's defenses  and man-power, the psychology of German generalship and of German  units, the pressure which could be put on British troops before the  breaking-point of courage, the relative or cumulative effects of  poison-gas, mines, heavy and light artillery, tanks, the disposition of  German guns and the probability of their movement in this direction or  that, the amount of their wastage under our counter-battery work, the  advantages of attacks in depth--one body of troops \"leap-frogging,\"  another in an advance to further objectives--the time-table of  transport, the supply of food and water and ammunition, the comfort of  troops before action, and a thousand other factors of success.    Before every battle fought by the Second Army, and of the eve of it, Sir  John Harington sent for the war correspondents and devoted an hour or  more to a detailed explanation of his plans. He put down all his cards  on the table with perfect candor, hiding nothing, neither minimizing nor  exaggerating the difficulties and dangers of the attack, pointing out  the tactical obstacles which must be overcome before any chance of  success, and exposing the general strategy in the simplest and clearest  speech.    I used to study him at those times, and marveled at him. After intense  and prolonged work at all this detail involving the lives of thousands  of men, he was highly wrought, with every nerve in his body and brain  at full tension, but he was never flurried, never irritable, never  depressed or elated by false pessimism or false optimism. He was a  chemist explaining the factors of a great experiment of which the  result was still uncertain. He could only hope for certain results after  careful analysis and synthesis. Yet he was not dehumanized. He laughed  sometimes at surprises he had caused the enemy, or was likely to cause  them--surprises which would lead to a massacre of their men. He warmed  to the glory of the courage of the troops who were carrying out his  plans.    \"It depends on these fellows,\" he would say. \"I am setting them a  difficult job. If they can do it, as I hope and believe, it will be  a fine achievement. They have been very much tried, poor fellows, but  their spirit is still high, as I know from their commanding officers.\"    One of his ambitions was to break down the prejudice between the  fighting units and the Staff. \"We want them to know that we are all  working together, for the same purpose and with the same zeal. They  cannot do without us, as we cannot do without them, and I want them to  feel that the work done here is to help them to do theirs more easily,  with lighter losses, in better physical conditions, with organization  behind them at every stage.\"    Many times the Second Army would not order an attack or decide the time  of it before consulting the divisional generals and brigadiers, and  obtaining their consensus of opinion. The officers and men in the Second  Army did actually come to acknowledge the value of the staff-work behind  them, and felt a confidence in its devotion to their interests which was  rare on the western front.    At the end of one of his expositions Sir John Harington would rise and  gather up his maps and papers, and say:    \"Well, there you are, gentlemen. You know as much as I do about the  plans for to-morrow's battle. At the end of the day you will be able to  see the result of all our work and tell me things I do not know.\"    Those conferences took place in the Second Army headquarters on Cassel  Hill, in a big building which was a casino before the war, with a  far-reaching view across Flanders, so that one could see in the distance  the whole sweep of the Ypres salient, and southward the country below  Notre Dame de Lorette, with Merville and Hazebrouck in the foreground.  Often we assembled in a glass house, furnished with trestle tables on  which maps were spread, and, thinking back to these scenes, I remember  now, as I write, the noise of rain beating on that glass roof, and the  clammy touch of fog on the window-panes stealing through the cracks and  creeping into the room. The meteorologist of the Second Army was often  a gloomy prophet, and his prophecies were right. How it rained on nights  when hundreds of thousands of British soldiers were waiting in their  trenches to attack in a murky dawn!... We said good night to General  Harington, each one of us, I think, excited by the thought of the drama  of human life and death which we had heard in advance in that glass  house on the hill; to be played out by flesh and blood before many  hours had passed. A kind of sickness took possession of my soul when I  stumbled down the rock path from those headquarters in pitch darkness,  over slabs of stones designed by a casino architect to break one's neck,  with the rain dribbling down one's collar, and, far away, watery lights  in the sky, of gun-flashes and ammunition-dumps afire, and the noise of  artillery thudding in dull, crumbling shocks. We were starting early  to see the opening of the battle and its backwash. There would be more  streams of bloody, muddy men, more crowds of miserable prisoners, more  dead bodies lying in the muck of captured ground, more shells plunging  into the wet earth and throwing up columns of smoke and mud, more dead  horses, disemboweled, and another victory at fearful cost, over one of  the Flanders ridges.    Curses and prayers surged up in my heart. How long was this to go  on--this massacre of youth, this agony of men? Was there no sanity left  in the world that could settle the argument by other means than this?  When we had taken that ridge to-morrow there would be another to take,  and another. And what then? Had we such endless reserves of men that we  could go on gaining ground at such a price? Was it to be extermination  on both sides? The end of civilization itself? General Harington had  said: \"The enemy is still very strong. He has plenty of reserves on hand  and he is fighting hard. It won't be a walk-over to-morrow.\"    As an onlooker I was overwhelmed by the full measure of all this tragic  drama. The vastness and the duration of its horror appalled me. I went  to my billet in an old monastery, and sat there in the darkness, my  window glimmering with the faint glow of distant shell-flashes, and  said, \"O God, give us victory to-morrow, if that may help us to the  end.\" Then to bed, without undressing. There was an early start before  the dawn. Major Lytton would be with me. He had a gallant look along the  duckboards... Or Montague--white-haired Montague, who liked to gain a  far objective, whatever the risk, and gave one a little courage by  his apparent fearlessness. I had no courage on those early mornings of  battle. All that I had, which was little, oozed out of me when we came  to the first dead horses and the first dead men, and passed the tumult  of our guns firing out of the mud, and heard the scream of shells. I  hated it all with a cold hatred; and I went on hating it for years  that seem a lifetime. I was not alone in that hatred, and other men had  greater cause, though it was for their sake that I suffered most, as  an observer of their drama of death... As observers we saw most of the  grisly game.          PART TWO. THE SCHOOL OF COURAGE    EARLY DAYS WITH THE NEW ARMY          I      By the time stationary warfare had been established on the western front  in "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3327"],[0,"Bulfinch's Mythology: The Age of Fable (#12)"],[1," with head and shoulders  bare, screening her face with her hand, looked up to heaven, and  with a husky voice called on Jupiter.    \"O ruler of the gods, if I have deserved this treatment, and it  is your will that I perish with fire, why withhold your  thunderbolts?  Let me at least fall by your hand.  Is this the  reward of my fertility, of my obedient service?  Is it for this  that I have supplied herbage for cattle, and fruits for men, and  frankincense for your altars?  But if I am unworthy of regard,  what has my brother Ocean done to deserve such a fate?  If  neither of us can excite your pity, think, I pray you, of your  own heaven, and behold how both the poles are smoking which  sustain your palace, which must fall if they be destroyed.  Atlas  faints, and scarce holds up his burden.  If sea, earth, and  heaven perish, we fall into ancient Chaos.  Save what yet remains  to us from the devouring flame.  Oh, take thought for our  deliverance in this awful moment!\"    Thus spoke Earth, and overcome with heat and thirst, could say no  more.  Then Jupiter Omnipotent, calling to witness all the gods,  including him who had lent the chariot, and showing them that all  was lost unless some speedy remedy were applied, mounted the  lofty tower from whence he diffuses clouds over the earth, and  hurls the forked lightnings.  But at that time not a cloud was to  be found to interpose for a screen to earth, nor was a shower  remaining unexhausted.  He thundered, and brandishing a  lightning-bolt in his right hand launched it against the  charioteer, and struck him at the same moment from his seat and  from existence!  Phaeton, with his hair on fire, fell headlong,  like a shooting star which marks the heavens with its brightness  as it falls, and Eridanus, the great river, received him and  cooled his burning frame.  The Italian Naiads reared a tomb for  him, and inscribed these words upon the stone:      \"Driver of Phoebus' chariot, Phaeton,    Struck by Jove's thunder, rests beneath this stone.    He could not rule his father's car of fire,    Yet was it much so nobly to aspire.\"    His sisters, the Heliades, as they lamented his fate were turned  into poplar trees, on the banks of the river, and their tears,  which continued to flow, became amber as they dropped into the  stream,    One of Prior's best remembered poems is that on the Female  Phaeton, from which we quote the last verse.    Kitty has been imploring her mother to allow her to go out into  the world as her friends have done, if only for once.      \"Fondness prevailed, mamma gave way;    Kitty, at heart's desire,    Obtained the chariot for a day,    And set the world on fire.\"    Milman, in his poem of Samor, makes the following allusion to  Phaeton's story:--      \"As when the palsied universe aghast    Lay .... mute and still,    When drove, so poets sing, the sun-born youth    Devious through Heaven's affrighted signs his sire's    Ill-granted chariot.  Him the Thunderer hurled    From th'empyrean headlong to the gulf    Of the half-parched Eridanus, where weep    Even now the sister trees their amber tears    O 'er Phaeton untimely dead.\"    In the beautiful lines of Walter Savage Lando describing the sea-  shell, there is an allusion to the sun's palace and chariot.  The  water-nymph says,      \"I have sinuous shells of pearly hue    Within, and things that lustre have imbibed    In the sun's palace porch, where when unyoked    His chariot-wheel stands midway in the wave.    Shake one and it awakens; then apply    Its polished lip to your attentive car,    And it remembers its August abodes,    And murmurs as the ocean murmurs there.\"    Gebir, Book 1        Chapter IV    Midas. Baucis and Philemon. Pluto and Proserpine.    Bacchus, on a certain occasion, found his old school master and  foster father, Silenus, missing.  The old man had been drinking,  and in that state had wandered away, and was found by some  peasants, who carried him to their king, Midas.  Midas recognized  him, and treated him hospitably, entertaining him for ten days  and nights with an unceasing round of jollity.  On the eleventh  day he brought Silenus back, and restored him in safety to his  pupil.  Whereupon Bacchus offered Midas his choice of whatever  reward he might wish.  He asked that whatever he might touch  should be changed into GOLD.  Bacchus consented, though sorry  that he had not made a better choice.  Midas went his way,  rejoicing in his newly acquired power, which he hastened to put  to the test.  He could scarce believe his eyes when he found that  a twig of an oak, which he plucked from the branch, became gold  in his hand.  He took up a stone   it changed to gold.  He  touched a sod   it did the same.  He took an apple from the tree    you would have thought he had robbed the garden of the  Hesperides.  His joy knew no bounds, and as soon as he got home,  he ordered the servants to set a splendid repast on the table.  Then he found to his dismay that whether he touched bread, it  hardened in his hand; or put a morsel to his lips, it defied his  teeth.  He took a glass of wine, but it flowed down his throat  like melted gold.    In consternation at the unprecedented affliction, he strove to  divest himself of his power; he hated the gift he had lately  coveted.  But all in vain; starvation seemed to await him.  He  raised his arms, all shining with gold, in prayer to Bacchus,  begging to be delivered from his glittering destruction.  Bacchus, merciful deity, heard and consented.  \"Go,\" said he, \"to  the river Pactolus, trace the stream to its fountain-head, there  plunge in your head and body and wash away your fault and its  punishment.\"  He did so, and scarce had he touched the waters  before the gold-creating power passed into them, and the river  sands became changed into GOLD, as they remain to this day.    Thenceforth Midas, hating wealth and splendor, dwelt in the  country, and became a worshipper of Pan, the god of the fields.  On a certain occasion Pan had the temerity to compare his music  with that of Apollo, and to challenge the god of the lyre to a  trial of skill.  The challenge was accepted, and Tmolus, the  mountain-god, was chosen umpire.  Tmolus took his seat and  cleared away the trees from his ears to listen.  At a given  signal Pan blew on his pipes, and with his rustic melody gave  great satisfaction to himself and his faithful follower, Midas,  who happened to be present.  Then Tmolus turned his head toward  the sun-god, and all his trees turned with him.  Apollo rose, his  brow wreathed with Parnassian laurel, while his robe of Tyrian  purple swept the ground.  In his left hand he held the lyre, and  with his right hand struck the strings.  Ravished with the  harmony, Tmolus at once awarded the victory to the god of the  lyre, and all but Midas acquiesced in the judgment.  He  dissented, and questioned the justice of the award.  Apollo would  not suffer such a depraved pair of ears any longer to wear the  human form, but caused them to increase in length, grow hairy,  within and without, and to become movable, on their roots; in  short, to be on the perfect pattern of those of an ass.    Mortified enough was King Midas at this mishap; but he consoled  himself with the thought that it was possible to hide his  misfortune, which he attempted to do by means of an ample turban  or headdress.  But his hairdresser of course knew the secret.  He  was charged not to mention it, and threatened with dire  punishment if he presumed to disobey.  But he found it too much  for his discretion to keep such a secret; so he went out into the  meadow, dug a hole in the ground, and stooping down, whispered  the story, and covered it up. Before long a thick bed of reeds  sprang up in the meadow, and as soon as it had gained its growth,  began whispering the story, and has continued to do so, from that  day to this, with every breeze which passes over the place.    The story of King Midas has been told by others with some  variations.  Dryden, in the Wife of Bath's Tale, makes Midas'  queen the betrayer of the secret.      \"This Midas knew, and durst communicate    To none but to his wife his ears of state.\"    Midas was king of Phrygia.  He was the son of Gordius, a poor  countryman, who was taken by the people and made king, in  obedience to the command of the oracle, which had said that their  future king should come in a wagon.  While the people were  deliberating, Gordius with his wife and son came driving his  wagon into the public square.    Gordius, being made king, dedicated his wagon to the deity of the  oracle, and tied it up in its place with a fast knot.  This was  the celebrated GORDIAN KNOT, of which, in after times it was  said, that whoever should untie it should become lord of all  Asia.  Many tried to untie it, but none succeeded, till Alexander  the Great, in his career of conquest, came to Phrygia.  He tried  his skill with as ill success as the others, till growing  impatient he drew his sword and cut the knot.  When he afterwards  succeeded in subjecting all Asia to his sway, people began to  think that he had complied with the terms of the oracle according  to its true meaning.      BAUCIS AND PHILEMON    On a certain hill in Phrygia stand a linden tree and an oak,  enclosed by a low wall.  Not far from the spot is a marsh,  formerly good habitable land, but now indented with pools, the  resort of fen-birds and cormorants.  Once on a time, Jupiter, in  human shape, visited this country, and with him his son Mercury  (he of the caduceus), without his wings.  They presented  themselves at many a door as weary travellers, seeking rest and  shelter, but found all closed, for it was late, and the  inhospitable inhabitants would not rouse themselves to open for  their reception.  At last a humble mansion received them, a small  thatched cottage, where Baucis, a pious old dame, and her husband  Philemon, united when young, had"]]]
