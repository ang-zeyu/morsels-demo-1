Burglars in all ages and many lands have been patrons of this  species of magic, which is very useful to them in the exercise of  their profession. Thus a South Slavonian housebreaker sometimes  begins operations by throwing a dead man's bone over the house,  saying, with pungent sarcasm, \"As this bone may waken, so may these  people waken\"; after that not a soul in the house can keep his or  her eyes open. Similarly, in Java the burglar takes earth from a  grave and sprinkles it round the house which he intends to rob; this  throws the inmates into a deep sleep. With the same intention a  Hindoo will strew ashes from a pyre at the door of the house;  Indians of Peru scatter the dust of dead men's bones; and Ruthenian  burglars remove the marrow from a human shin-bone, pour tallow into  it, and having kindled the tallow, march thrice round the house with  this candle burning, which causes the inmates to sleep a death-like  sleep. Or the Ruthenian will make a flute out of a human leg-bone  and play upon it; whereupon all persons within hearing are overcome  with drowsiness. The Indians of Mexico employed for this maleficent  purpose the left fore-arm of a woman who had died in giving birth to  her first child; but the arm had to be stolen. With it they beat the  ground before they entered the house which they designed to plunder;  this caused every one in the house to lose all power of speech and  motion; they were as dead, hearing and seeing everything, but  perfectly powerless; some of them, however, really slept and even  snored. In Europe similar properties were ascribed to the Hand of  Glory, which was the dried and pickled hand of a man who had been  hanged. If a candle made of the fat of a malefactor who had also  died on the gallows was lighted and placed in the Hand of Glory as  in a candlestick, it rendered motionless all persons to whom it was  presented; they could not stir a finger any more than if they were  dead. Sometimes the dead man's hand is itself the candle, or rather  bunch of candles, all its withered fingers being set on fire; but  should any member of the household be awake, one of the fingers will  not kindle. Such nefarious lights can only be extinguished with  milk. Often it is prescribed that the thief's candle should be made  of the finger of a new-born or, still better, unborn child;  sometimes it is thought needful that the thief should have one such  candle for every person in the house, for if he has one candle too  little somebody in the house will wake and catch him. Once these  tapers begin to burn, there is nothing but milk that will put them  out. In the seventeenth century robbers used to murder pregnant  women in order thus to extract candles from their wombs. An ancient  Greek robber or burglar thought he could silence and put to flight  the fiercest watchdogs by carrying with him a brand plucked from a  funeral pyre. Again, Servian and Bulgarian women who chafe at the  restraints of domestic life will take the copper coins from the eyes  of a corpse, wash them in wine or water, and give the liquid to  their husbands to drink. After swallowing it, the husband will be as  blind to his wife's peccadilloes as the dead man was on whose eyes  the coins were laid.    Further, animals are often conceived to possess qualities of  properties which might be useful to man, and homoeopathic or  imitative magic seeks to communicate these properties to human  beings in various ways. Thus some Bechuanas wear a ferret as a  charm, because, being very tenacious of life, it will make them  difficult to kill. Others wear a certain insect, mutilated, but  living, for a similar purpose. Yet other Bechuana warriors wear the  hair of a hornless ox among their own hair, and the skin of a frog  on their mantle, because a frog is slippery, and the ox, having no  horns, is hard to catch; so the man who is provided with these  charms believes that he will be as hard to hold as the ox and the  frog. Again, it seems plain that a South African warrior who twists  tufts of rat's hair among his own curly black locks will have just  as many chances of avoiding the enemy's spear as the nimble rat has  of avoiding things thrown at it; hence in these regions rats' hair  is in great demand when war is expected. One of the ancient books of  India prescribes that when a sacrifice is offered for victory, the  earth out of which the altar is to be made should be taken from a  place where a boar has been wallowing, since the strength of the  boar will be in that earth. When you are playing the one-stringed  lute, and your fingers are stiff, the thing to do is to catch some  long-legged field spiders and roast them, and then rub your fingers  with the ashes; that will make your fingers as lithe and nimble as  the spiders' legs--at least so think the Galelareese. To bring back  a runaway slave an Arab will trace a magic circle on the ground,  stick a nail in the middle of it, and attach a beetle by a thread to  the nail, taking care that the sex of the beetle is that of the  fugitive. As the beetle crawls round and round, it will coil the  thread about the nail, thus shortening its tether and drawing nearer  to the centre at every circuit. So by virtue of homoeopathic magic  the runaway slave will be drawn back to his master.    Among the western tribes of British New Guinea, a man who has killed  a snake will burn it and smear his legs with the ashes when he goes  into the forest; for no snake will bite him for some days  afterwards. If a South Slavonian has a mind to pilfer and steal at  market, he has nothing to do but to burn a blind cat, and then throw  a pinch of its ashes over the person with whom he is higgling; after  that he can take what he likes from the booth, and the owner will  not be a bit the wiser, having become as blind as the deceased cat  with whose ashes he has been sprinkled. The thief may even ask  boldly, \"Did I pay for it?\" and the deluded huckster will reply,  \"Why, certainly.\" Equally simple and effectual is the expedient  adopted by natives of Central Australia who desire to cultivate  their beards. They prick the chin all over with a pointed bone, and  then stroke it carefully with a magic stick or stone, which  represents a kind of rat that has very long whiskers. The virtue of  these whiskers naturally passes into the representative stick or  stone, and thence by an easy transition to the chin, which,  consequently, is soon adorned with a rich growth of beard. The  ancient Greeks thought that to eat the flesh of the wakeful  nightingale would prevent a man from sleeping; that to smear the  eyes of a blear-sighted person with the gall of an eagle would give  him the eagle's vision; and that a raven's eggs would restore the  blackness of the raven to silvery hair. Only the person who adopted  this last mode of concealing the ravages of time had to be most  careful to keep his mouth full of oil all the time he applied the  eggs to his venerable locks, else his teeth as well as his hair  would be dyed raven black, and no amount of scrubbing and scouring  would avail to whiten them again. The hair-restorer was in fact a  shade too powerful, and in applying it you might get more than you  bargained for.    The Huichol Indians admire the beautiful markings on the backs of  serpents. Hence when a Huichol woman is about to weave or embroider,  her husband catches a large serpent and holds it in a cleft stick,  while the woman strokes the reptile with one hand down the whole  length of its back; then she passes the same hand over her forehead  and eyes, that she may be able to work as beautiful patterns in the  web as the markings on the back of the serpent.    On the principle of homoeopathic magic, inanimate things, as well as  plants and animals, may diffuse blessing or bane around them,  according to their own intrinsic nature and the skill of the wizard  to tap or dam, as the case may be, the stream of weal or woe. In  Samaracand women give a baby sugar candy to suck and put glue in the  palm of its hand, in order that, when the child grows up, his words  may be sweet and precious things may stick to his hands as if they  were glued. The Greeks thought that a garment made from the fleece  of a sheep that had been torn by a wolf would hurt the wearer,  setting up an itch or irritation in his skin. They were also of  opinion that if a stone which had been bitten by a dog were dropped  in wine, it would make all who drank of that wine to fall out among  themselves. Among the Arabs of Moab a childless woman often borrows  the robe of a woman who has had many children, hoping with the robe  to acquire the fruitfulness of its owner. The Caffres of Sofala, in  East Africa, had a great dread of being struck with anything hollow,  such as a reed or a straw, and greatly preferred being thrashed with  a good thick cudgel or an iron bar, even though it hurt very much.  For they thought that if a man were beaten with anything hollow, his  inside would waste away till he died. In eastern seas there is a  large shell which the Buginese of Celebes call the \"old man\"  (_kadj√¢wo_). On Fridays they turn these \"old men\" upside down and  place them on the thresholds of their houses, believing that whoever  then steps over the threshold of the house will live to be old. At  initiation a Brahman boy is made to tread with his right foot on a  stone, while the words are repeated, \"Tread on this stone; like a  stone be firm\"; and the same ceremony is performed, with the same  words, by a Brahman bride at her marriage. In Madagascar a mode of  counteracting the levity of fortune is to bury a stone at the foot  of the heavy house-post. The common custom of swearing upon a stone  may be based partly on a belief that the strength and stability of  the stone lend confirmation to an oath. Thus the old Danish  historian Saxo Grammaticus tells us that \"the ancients, when they  were to choose a king,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36299"],[0,"Our Legal Heritage: King AEthelbert - King George III, 600 A.D. - 1776 (#12)"],[1,"of 24 years  who was widely respected for his intelligence, resourcefulness, good  judgment, and wisdom. His educated Queen Edith, whom he relied on for  advice and cheerful courage, was a stabilizing influence on him. They  were served by a number of thegns, who had duties in the household,  which was composed of the hall, the courtyard, and the bedchamber. They  were important men - thegns by rank. They were landholders, often in  several areas, and held leading positions in the shires. They were also  priests and clerics, who maintained the religious services and performed  tasks for which literacy was necessary. Edward was the first king to  have a \"Chancellor\". He kept a royal seal and was the chief royal  chaplain. He did all the secretarial work of the household and court,  drew up and sealed the royal writs, conducted the king's correspondence,  and kept all the royal accounts. The word \"chancellor\" signified a  screen behind which the secretarial work of the household was done. He  had the special duty of securing and administering the royal revenue  from vacant benefices. The most important royal officers were the  chamberlains, who took care of the royal bedchamber and adjoining  wardrobe used for dressing and storage of valuables, and the priests.  These royal officers had at first been responsible only for domestic  duties, but gradually came to assume public administrative tasks.         Edward wanted to avoid the pressures and dangers of living in the rich  and powerful City of London. So he rebuilt a monastic church, an abbey,  and a palace at Westminster about two miles upstream. He started the  growth of Westminster as a center of royal and political power; kings'  councils met there. Royal coronations took place at the abbey. Since  Edward traveled a lot, he established a storehouse-treasury at  Winchester to supplement his traveling wardrobe. At this time, Spanish  stallions were imported to improve English horses. London came to have  the largest and best trained army in England.         The court invited many of the greatest magnates and prelates [highest  ecclesiastical officials, such as bishops] of the land to the great  ecclesiastical festivals, when the king held more solemn courts and  feasted with his vassals for several days. These included all the great  earls, the majority of bishops, some abbots, and a number of thegns and  clerics. Edward had a witan of wise men to advise him, but sometimes the  King would speak in the hall after dinner and listen to what comments  were made from the mead-benches. As the court moved about the country,  many men came to pay their respects and attend to local business. Edward  started the practice of King's touching people to cure them of scrofula,  a disease which affected the glands, especially in the head and neck. It  was done in the context of a religious ceremony.         The main governmental activities were: war, collection of revenue,  religious education, and administration of justice. For war, the shires  had to provide a certain number of men and the ports quotas of ships  with crews. The king was the patron of the English church. He gave the  church peace and protection. He presided over church councils and  appointed bishops. As for the administration of justice, the public  courts were almost all under members of Edward's court, bishops, earls,  and reeves. Edward's mind was often troubled and disturbed by the threat  that law and justice would be overthrown, by the pervasiveness of  disputes and discord, by the raging of wicked presumption, by money  interfering with right and justice, and by avarice kindling all of  these. He saw it as his duty to courageously oppose the wicked by taking  good men as models, by enriching the churches of God, by relieving those  oppressed by wicked judges, and by judging equitably between the  powerful and the humble. He was so greatly revered that a comet was  thought to accompany his death.         The king established the office of the Chancery to draft documents and  keep records. It created the writ, which was a small piece of parchment  [sheep skin] addressed to a royal official or dependent commanding him  to perform some task for the King. By the 1000s A.D., the writ contained  a seal: a lump of wax with the impress of the Great Seal of England  which hung from the bottom of the document. Writing was done with a  sharpened goose-wing quill. Ink was obtained from mixing fluid from the  galls made by wasps for their eggs on oak trees, rainwater or vinegar,  gum arabic, and iron salts for color.         A King's grant of land entailed two documents: a charter giving  boundaries and conditions and a writ, usually addressed to the shire  court, listing the judicial and financial privileges conveyed with the  land. These were usually sac and soke [possession of jurisdiction of a  private court of a noble or institution to execute the laws and  administer justice over inhabitants and tenants of the estate], toll  [right to have a market and to collect a payment on the sale of cattle  and other property on the estate] and team [probably the right to hold a  court to determine the honesty of a man accused of illegal possession of  cattle or of buying stolen cattle by inquiring of the alleged seller or  a warrantor, even if an outsider], and infangenetheof [the authority to  hang and take the chattels of a thief caught on the estate].         The town of Coventry consisted of a large monastery estate and a large  private estate headed by a lord. The monastery was granted by Edward the  Confessor full freedom and these jurisdictions: sac and soke, toll and  team, hamsocne [the authority to fine a person for breaking into and  making entry by force into the dwelling of another], forestall [the  authority to fine a person for robbing others on the road], bloodwite  [the authority to impose a forfeiture for assault involving bloodshed],  fightwite [the authority to fine for fighting], weordwite [the authority  to fine for manslaughter, but not for willful murder], and mundbryce  [the authority to fine for any breach of the peace, such as trespass on  lands].         Every man was expected to have a lord to whom he gave fealty. He swore  by this fealty oath: \"By the Lord, before whom this relic is holy, I  will be to faithful and true, and love all that he loves, and shun all  that he shuns, according to God's law, and according to the world's  principle, and never, by will nor by force, by word nor by work, do  ought of what is loathful to him; on condition that he keep me as I am  willing to deserve, and all that fulfill that our agreement was, when I  to him submitted and chose his will.\" If a man was homeless or lordless,  his brothers were expected to find him such, e.g. in the folkmote.  Otherwise, he was to be treated as a fugitive and could be slain, and  anyone who had harbored him would pay a penalty. Brothers were also  expected to protect their minor kinsmen.         Marriages were determined by men asking women to marry them. If a woman  said yes, he paid a sum to her kin for her \"mund\" [jurisdiction or  protection over her] and gave his oath to them to maintain and support  the woman and any children born. As security for this oath, he gave a  valuable object or \"wed\". The couple were then betrothed. Marriage  ceremonies were performed by priests in churches. The groom had to bring  friends to his wedding as sureties to guarantee his oath to maintain and  support his wife and children. Those who swore to take care of the  children were called their \"godfathers\". The marriage was written into  church records. After witnessing the wedding, friends ate the great  loaf, or first bread made by the bride. This was the forerunner of the  wedding cake. They drank special ale, the \"bride ale\" (from hence the  work \"bridal\"), to the health of the couple.         Women could own land, houses, and furniture and other property. They  could even make wills that disinherited their sons. This marriage  agreement with an Archbishop's sister provides her with land, money, and  horsemen:         \"Here in this document is stated the agreement which Wulfric and the  archbishop made when he obtained the archbishop's sister as his wife,  namely he promised her the estates at Orleton and Ribbesford for her  lifetime, and promised her that he would obtain the estate at Knightwick  for her for three lives from the community at Winchcombe, and gave her  the estate at Alton to grant and bestow upon whomsoever she pleased  during her lifetime or at her death, as she preferred, and promised her  50 mancuses of gold and 30 men and 30 horses.    The witnesses that this agreement was made as stated were Archbishop  Wulfstan and Earl Leofwine and Bishop AEthelstan and Abbot AElfweard and  the monk Brihtheah and many good men in addition to them, both  ecclesiastics and laymen. There are two copies of this agreement, one in  the possession of the archbishop at Worcester and the other in the  possession of Bishop AEthelstan at Hereford.\"         This marriage agreement provided the wife with money, land, farm  animals and farm laborers; it also names sureties, the survivor of whom  would receive all this property:        \"Here is declared in this document the agreement which Godwine made with  Brihtric when he wooed his daughter. In the first place he gave her a  pound's weight of gold, to induce her to accept his suit, and he granted  her the estate at Street with all that belongs to it, and 150 acres at  Burmarsh and in addition 30 oxen and 20 cows and 10 horses and 10  slaves.    This agreement was made at Kingston before King Cnut, with the  cognizance of Archbishop Lyfing and the community at Christchurch, and  Abbot AElfmaer and the community at St. Augustine's, and the sheriff  AEthelwine and Sired the old and Godwine, Wulfheah's son, and AElfsige  cild and Eadmaer of Burham and Godwine, Wulfstan's son, and Carl,"]]]
