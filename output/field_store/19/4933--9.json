If  these groups are of common origin, the lack of distinct boundaries  between them is not surprising. A muscular band which extends from the  _pars interna_ of the _m. gastrocnemius_ around the front of the knee  is present in every emberizine species that I studied and in the Genus  _Piranga_. With the exception of _Spiza_ none of the richmondenines  possesses this band.    The significant differences in leg-musculature which have been  discussed above (pp. 183-184) distinguish the carduelines from the New  World finches and tanagers. Even the cardueline _Leucosticte_ and the  emberizine _Calcarius_, which resemble one another in general  adaptations and in several myological features of the leg (p. 183),  agree in significant features of the musculature with the respective  groups to which they belong. The carduelines agree in the major  features of leg-musculature with the ploceids which I studied.    The use of serological techniques in taxonomic work has two main  advantages. The biochemical systems involved in such investigations  seem to be relatively slow to change in response to external  environmental influences, and the quantitative nature of the results  obtained makes possible objective measurement of resemblances among  species.    I have pointed out (p. 200) that the carduelines are excluded,  serologically, from the distinct assemblage formed by the  richmondenines, emberizines, and tanagers. Actually, the carduelines  show less serological resemblance to this assemblage than do the  estrildines, and most ornithologists agree that the Estrildinae are  not at all closely related to the Richmondeninae, Emberizinae, and  Thraupidae. _Molothrus_, representing a family (Icteridae) recognized  as distinct from the Family Fringillidae, also more closely resembles  the fringillid assemblage, serologically, than do the carduelines.  Although the Carduelinae constitute a distinct group serologically,  they show greater serological resemblance to the estrildines of the  Family Ploceidae than to any of the other species tested. At least the  carduelines and the estrildines form a group as compact as the  subfamilies of the Fringillidae. Thus, the serological data correlate  well with those obtained from the study of the leg-musculature.    Present systems of classification include the subfamilies Passerinae  and Estrildinae in the Family Ploceidae. _Passer_, however, is less  closely related to the estrildines serologically than are the  carduelines, and is less closely related to the estrildines than  _Molothrus_, an icterid, is to the fringillids. This raises a question  as to the homogeneity of the Family Ploceidae as presently recognized  by most ornithologists. If the Passerinae and the Estrildinae are  placed in a single family, the serological divergence among members of  this group is certainly greater than it is in the Family Fringillidae.  Additionally, Beecher (1953:303-304) found that the estrildines  possess a pattern of jaw-musculature different from those in other  ploceids.    The combined evidence from jaw-musculature and serology has caused me  to conclude that the estrildines should be excluded from the Family  Ploceidae (see below).    In an attempt to clarify the relationships of the Fringillidae and  allied groups, I here review briefly the evidence which has been  presented. From his studies of jaw-musculature (1951a, 1951b,  1953) Beecher concludes that the Pyrrhuloxinae (=Richmondeninae),  the Carduelinae, and the Thraupinae are closely related.  He places these groups in the Family Thraupidae. He excludes the  Emberizinae from this group and places them with the wood warblers  in the Family Parulidae. He suggests that the estrildines constitute  a family (Estrildidae) separate from the Family Ploceidae.    From his studies of certain features of the bony palate Tordoff  (1954:25-26, 32) concludes that the richmondenines, the emberizines,  and the tanagers have a common origin and places these groups in the  Family Fringillidae. He excludes the carduelines from this assemblage,  suggests that they are closely related to the estrildines, and  includes them as the Subfamily Carduelinae in the Family Ploceidae.    In this paper I have presented data obtained from the study of certain  features of morphology and biochemistry which I think are less subject  to the influence of environmental factors than those features studied  by recent workers. It is significant that the data obtained by use of  serological techniques and those obtained from the study of  leg-musculature point to the same conclusions. On the basis of these  data I have drawn several conclusions concerning the relationships of  the groups which I studied.    The richmondenines, emberizines, and tanagers are closely related and  should be included in a single family, Fringillidae. The Carduelinae  and the Estrildinae are closely related subfamilies. Although most  recent classifications place the Estrildinae and Passerinae in the  Family Ploceidae, the serological evidence indicates that these groups  are not closely related. Beecher (1953:303-304) drew the same  conclusion from his study of jaw-musculature (see above). I suggest,  therefore, that the Carduelinae and the Estrildinae be placed in a  family separate from the Ploceidae and that the name Carduelidae  (rather than Estrildidae) be used for this group. At present, neither  is an accepted family name. Because _Carduelis_ Brisson 1760 is an  older name than _Estrilda_ Swainson 1827 and because _Carduelis_ seems  to be a centrally located genus in the family, I have chosen the  former (although the International Rules of Zoological Nomenclature do  not specify that priority must apply in forming family names).    I have been unable to study any of the species included in the  subfamilies Fringillinae (not Fringillinae of Tordoff, see 1954:23-24,  and below) and Geospizinae of recent classifications; thus these  groups have not been discussed above. Beecher (1953:307-308) includes  _Fringilla_ in the Subfamily Carduelinae; he includes the geospizines  in a separate family, Geospizidae, and states that they are derived  from the emberizines. Tordoff (1954:23-24) found that in features of  the bony palate _Fringilla_ and the geospizines resemble the  emberizines and, on this basis, includes them in the Subfamily  Fringillinae.    The Dickcissel, _Spiza americana_, possesses certain features which  merit special discussion. Beecher (1951a:431; 1953:309), on the basis  of jaw-musculature, considers it an icterid. To be sure _Spiza_ is in  many ways an aberrant member of the group to which it is now assigned  (Subfamily Richmondeninae). _Spiza_, serologically, is closely related  to all species of the richmondenine-emberizine-thraupid assemblage.  Within this assemblage its nearest relatives are the richmondenines.  _Spiza_ differs from the other richmondenines studied and resembles  the emberizines and tanagers in the possession of the muscular band  which extends from the _pars interna_ of the _m. gastrocnemius_ around  the front of the knee. This band, in _Spiza_, is smaller, however,  than in any of the other species. No icterid dissected possesses such  a structure. Tordoff (1954:29) states that _Spiza_ is typically  richmondenine in palatal structure and makes the suggestion, with  which I agree, that _Spiza_ is a richmondenine and may be closely  related to the ancestral stock which gave rise to the fringillid  assemblage. The serological position of _Spiza_, approximately  equidistant from the other fringillids (Figs. 22, 23), and the  presence of the small muscular band around the front of the knee  constitute evidence supporting the central position of _Spiza_.    After consideration of evidence from the studies of external  morphology, ethology, myology, osteology, and serology, I propose here  an arrangement of the groups which I have studied and submit for  comparison the arrangements (of these groups) proposed by Beecher and  Tordoff. The names of subfamilies that I have been unable to study are  included in my classification and are placed in brackets.     ------------------------+----------------------+-----------------------                           | Proposed by Tordoff  |  Proposed by Beecher        Here proposed:     | (1954) on the basis  |  (1953) on the basis                           | of the bony palate:  |  of jaw-musculature:   ========================+======================+=======================       FAMILY PLOCEIDAE    |   FAMILY PLOCEIDAE   |    FAMILY PLOCEIDAE                           |                      |   [Subf.

The  possibility of a strain being caused by the contraction that would occur  during the cooling down of the joint last made had to be provided for  also. The desired object was effected as follows. In Fig. 29 _A_  represents a section of the ozone generator at the point where the tube  to connect it to the gauge was fixed. _B_ represents the top of the  gauge, with the side tube _C_, which was to be connected with that from  _A_, viz. _D_. The ends of _C_ and _D_ were expanded as shown at _D_ (by  melting them and blowing them out), so that one of them, made rather  smaller than the other, could be overlapped by the larger one. _A_ and  _B_ being rigidly fixed in their final positions, with _C_ and _D_ in  contact, as shown in the figure, all openings in the apparatus were  closed, except one, to which was attached an india-rubber blowing-bottle  by means of a tube of india-rubber long enough to be held in the hand of  the operator, and to allow him to observe the operation of joining the  tubes at _D_. When everything was in readiness, a very small-pointed  flame from a moveable blow-pipe held in the hand was directed upon the  glass at _D_ till it melted and the two tubes united. To prevent the  fine tube when melted from running into a solid mass of glass, and so  becoming closed, a slight excess of pressure was maintained inside the  apparatus during the operation by forcing air into it with the  india-rubber blower from the moment at which _C_ and _D_ united. A point  of charcoal was kept in readiness to support the softened glass at _D_  in case it showed any tendency to fall out of shape.    The V-tube at _C_ served to prevent the subsequent fracture of the joint  in consequence of any strain caused by the contraction of the glass in  cooling.[13]    [13] For a method of joining soda glass to lead glass, see p. 81.    It is not difficult to connect several pieces of apparatus successively  in this manner, nor is this method only useful in such cases as that  just described. Pieces of apparatus of great length and weight may be  joined in a similar manner, irrespective of the size of the tubes to be  united.    The ends to be joined, prepared as before, so that one slightly overlaps  the other, must be held firmly in contact by clamps, and heated in  successive portions by a blow-pipe held in the hand of the operator,  each patch of glass being re-heated and gently blown, after a rough  joint has been made. Finally, a larger flame may be used to heat up the  whole joint for its final blowing. It is important to place the  apparatus so that the operator has free access to it on all sides. A  revolving table might be employed. An assistant to work the bellows is  necessary. Or, better still, air may be admitted to the blow-pipe from a  large gas-bag placed in some convenient position.    But in most cases one or other of the following air-tight joints can be  employed, and will be found to be very convenient:--    =Mercury Joints.=--The simplest form of mercury joint is shown at Fig.  30. _A_ and _B_ are the two tubes which are to be connected. A larger  tube or cup _F_ is attached to _A_ by the india-rubber tube _E_, and  placed on _A_ so that the end of _B_ may be brought into contact with  _A_ at _C_, and connected to it by a well-fitting piece of india-rubber  tube _C_. The cup _E_ is then brought into the position shown in Fig.  30, and mercury is introduced till the india-rubber tube at _C_ is  covered. As mercury and glass do not come into true contact, however,  such a joint, though said to give good results in practice, is not  theoretically air-tight, for air _might_ gradually find its way between  the liquid and the glass. By covering the mercury with a little  sulphuric acid or glycerine the risk of this occurring may be removed.  The same result may be attained by the use of glycerine in place of the  mercury in the cup _F_; but glycerine is less pleasant to work with than  mercury.[14]    [14] If the india-rubber tube _C_ be secured by wires, iron wire, not  copper wire, should be employed.    [Illustration: FIG. 30.]    When sulphuric acid is to be employed in such a joint, or when for any  other reason the use of an india-rubber tube is undesirable, the joint  may consist of a hollow stopper _B_ (Fig. 31), made of glass tube, and  ground to fit the neck of a thistle funnel _A_. _A_ and _B_ are joined  respectively to the pieces of apparatus to be connected, and connection  is made by placing _B_ in position in the neck of _A_; the joint is made  air-tight by introducing mercury with strong sulphuric acid above it  into the cup _A_. The joint may be rendered air-tight by introducing  sulphuric acid only into the cup. But this plan must not be adopted if  the interior of the apparatus is to be exhausted, as sulphuric acid is  easily forced between the ground glass surfaces by external pressure.  Mercury, however, will not pass between well-ground glass surfaces, and  is therefore to be employed for connecting apparatus which is to be  exhausted, and, if necessary, protected by a layer of strong sulphuric  acid to completely exclude air.    [Illustration: FIG. 31.]    Tubes placed horizontally may be joined by a glycerine or mercury joint  such as is shown in Fig. 32. The two tubes _A_ and _B_ are joined as  before by an india-rubber connection _C_, or one may be ground to fit  the other, and the joint is then enclosed within a larger jacketing-tube  _D_, with a mouth at _F_, which is filled with glycerine or mercury. _D_  is easily made by drawing out both ends of a piece of tube, leaving them  large enough to pass over the connection at _C_, however, and piercing  one side at _F_.    [Illustration: FIG. 32.]    =Vacuum Taps.=--It is not necessary to enter into a description of the  construction of ordinary glass taps, which can be purchased at very  reasonable prices. It may be remarked here, however, as a great many of  them are very imperfectly ground by the makers, that they may easily be  made air-tight by hand-grinding with camphorated turpentine and fine  emery, finishing with rotten-stone. A well-ground tap, which is well  lubricated, should be practically air-tight under greatly reduced  pressure for a short period; but when it is necessary to have a tap  which absolutely forbids the entrance of air into apparatus, one of the  following may be employed:--    [Illustration: FIG. 33.]    [Illustration: FIG. 34.]    (1.) _Mr. Cetti's Vacuum Tap_ (Fig. 34): This tap is cupped at _A_ and  sealed at _B_, and the cup _A_ is filled with mercury when the tap is in  use, so that if, for example, the end _C_ be attached to a flask, and  _D_ to an apparatus for exhausting the flask, it will be possible to  close the flask by turning off the tap _E_, and if no air be allowed  access through _D_, the vacuum produced in the flask at _C_ cannot be  affected by air leaking through the tap at _A_ or _B_.    A passage _F_ must be drilled from the bottom of the plug _E_ to meet  _G_, in order that when the plug is in position no residue of air shall  be confined within _B_, whence it might gradually leak into any  apparatus connected to it.    It is obvious, however, that this tap does not protect a flask sealed  to _C_ from the entrance of air through _D_, which, in fact, is the  direction in which air is most likely to effect an entrance. When using  one of these taps as part of an apparatus for supplying pure oxygen, I  have guarded against this by attaching a trap (Fig. 33) to the end _D_,  _C_ being joined to the delivery tube from the gas-holder. The structure  and mode of action of the trap are as follows:--    A narrow tube _G_ is joined to _D_ of Fig. 34, and terminates in the  wide tube _I_, which is connected above to _H_, and below to the  air-trap _J_. _J_ is connected at _K_, by a piece of flexible tube, to a  reservoir of mercury, from which mercury enters the air-trap, and  passing thence to _I_, can be employed for filling the V-trap _HLG_. The  air-trap _J_ is in the first instance filled with mercury, and then  serves to intercept any stray bubbles of air that the mercury may carry  with it. The particular form of the trap shown at _HLG_ was adopted  because with it the arm _LG_ is more readily emptied of mercury than  with any other form of trap made of small tube that I have tried. It has  been used in my apparatus in the following manner:--_H_ was connected  with a vessel to be filled with pure oxygen, the tap _E_ closed, and the  rise of mercury above _L_ prevented by a clamp on the flexible tube; the  vessel to be filled and the trap were then exhausted by a Sprengel pump,  and oxygen allowed to flow into the exhausted space by opening _E_, the  operation of exhausting the tubes and admitting oxygen being repeated as  often as necessary.    To prevent access of air to _E_ on disconnecting the vessel at _H_, the  mercury was allowed to flow into the trap till it reached to _MM_. _E_  was then closed, and _H_ exposed without danger of air reaching _E_, the  length of the arms of the trap being sufficient to provide against the  effects of any changes of temperature and pressure that could occur.    A delivery tube may be connected to _H_ and filled with mercury, by  closing _E_ and raising the mercury reservoir. All air being in that  way expelled from the delivery tube, and the supply of mercury cut off  by clamping the tube from the reservoir, oxygen can be delivered from  the tube by opening _E_, when it will send forward the mercury, and pass  into a tube placed to receive it without any risk of air being derived  from the delivery tube.    [Illustration: FIG. 35.]    (2.) _Gimmingham's Vacuum Tap_,[15] shown in Fig. 35, consists of three  parts. A tube _A_ is ground to fit the neck of _B_. _B_ is closed at its  lower end,"]]]
