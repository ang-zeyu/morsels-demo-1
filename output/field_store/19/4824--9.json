There have been instances of people, who  could see better in the gloom of the evening, than in the stronger light of  the day; like owls, and bats, and many quadrupeds, and flying insects. When  the eye is inflamed, great light becomes eminently painful, owing to the  increased irritative motions of the retina, and the consequent increased  sensation. Thus when the eye is dazzled with sudden light, the pain is not  owing to the motion of the iris; for it is the contraction of the iris,  which relieves the pain from sudden light; but to the too violent  contractions of the moving fibres, which constitute the extremities of the  optic nerve.    2. _Auditus acrior._ The irritative ideas of hearing are so increased in  energy as to excite our attention. This happens in some diseases of the  epileptic kind, and in some fevers. Hence the whispering of the currents of  air in a room, the respiration of the company, and noises before  unperceived, become troublesome; and sounds louder than usual, or  unexpected, produce starting, and convulsions.    M. M. Put oil of almonds into the ears. Stop the meatus auditorius with  cotton wool. Set the feet of the patient's bed on cushions, or suspend it  by cords from the ceiling.    3. _Olfactus acrior._ The irritative ideas of smell from the increased  action of the olfactive nerve excite our attention. Hence common odours are  disagreeable; and are perceived from variety of objects, which were before  thought inodorous. These are commonly believed to be hallucinations of the  sense.    M. M. Snuff starch up the nostrils.    4. _Gustus acrior._ The irritative ideas of taste, as of our own saliva,  and even of the atmospheric air, excite our attention; and common tastes  are disagreeably strong.    M. M. Water. Mucilage. Vegetable acids. Scrape the tongue clean. Rub it  with a sage-leaf and vinegar.    5. _Tactus acrior._ The irritative ideas of the nerves of touch excite our  attention: hence our own pressure on the parts, we rest upon, becomes  uneasy with universal soreness.    M. M. Soft feather-bed. Combed wool put under the patients, which rolls  under them, as they turn, and thus prevents their friction against the  sheets. Drawers of soft leather. Plasters of cerate with calamy.    6. _Sensus caloris acrior._ Acuter sense of heat occurs in some diseases,  and that even when the perceptible heat does not appear greater than  natural to the hand of another person. See Class I. 1. 2. See Sect. XIV. 8.  All the above increased actions of our organs of sense separately or  jointly accompany some fevers, and some epileptic diseases; the patients  complaining of the perception of the least light, noises in their ears, bad  smells in the room, and bad tastes in their mouths, with soreness,  numbness, and other uneasy feels, and with disagreeable sensations of  general or partial heat.    7. _Sensus extensionis acrior._ Acuter sense of extension. The sense of  extension was spoken of in Sect. XIV. 7. and XXXII. 4. The defect of  distention in the arterial system is accompanied with faintness; and its  excess with sensations of fulness, or weight, or pressure. This however  refers only to the vascular muscles, which are distended by their  appropriated fluids; but the longitudinal muscles are also affected by  different quantities of extension, and become violently painful by the  excess of it.    These pains of muscles and of membranes are generally divided into acute  and dull pains. The former are generally owing to increase of extension, as  in pricking the skin with a needle; and the latter generally to defect of  extension, as in cold head-aches; but if the edge of a knife, or point of a  pin, be gradually pressed against the fibres of muscles or membranes, there  would seem to be three states or stages of this extension of the fibres;  which have acquired names according to the degree or kind of sensation  produced by the extension of them; these are 1. titillation or tickling. 2.  itching, and the 3. smarting; as described below. See Sect. XIV. 9.    8. _Titillatio._ Tickling is a pleasureable pain of the sense of extension  above mentioned, and therefore excites laughter; as described in Sect.  XXXIV. 1. 4. The tickling of the nostrils, which precedes the efforts of  sneezing, is owing to the increased irritation occasioned by external  stimulus; and is attended with a pleasureable sensation in consequence of  the increased action of the part. When this action is exerted in a greater  degree, the sensation becomes painful, and the convulsion of sneezing  ensues; as the pain in tickling the soles of the feet of children is  relieved by laughter.    A lady after a bruise on her nose by a fall was affected with incessant  sneezing, and relieved by snuffing starch up her nostrils. Perpetual  sneezings in the measles, and in catarrhs from cold, are owing to the  stimulus of the saline part of the mucous effusion on the membrane of the  nostrils. See Class II. 1. 1. 3.    9. _Pruritus._ Itching seems to be a greater degree of titillation, and to  be owing to the stimulus of some acrid material, as the matter of the itch;  or of the herpes on the scrotum, and about the anus; or from those  universal eruptions, which attend some elderly people, who have drank much  vinous spirit. It occurs also, when inflammations are declining, as in the  healing of blisters, or in the cure of ophthalmia, as the action of the  vessels is yet so great as to produce sensation; which, like the  titillations that occasion laughter, is perpetually changing from pleasure  to pain.    When the natural efforts of scratching do not relieve the pain of itching,  it sometimes increases so as to induce convulsions and madness. As in the  furor uterinus, and satyriasis, and in the sphincter ani and scrotum. See  Class II. 1. 4. 14. IV. 2. 2. 6.    M. M. Warm bath. Fomentation. Alcohol externally. Poultice. Oiled silk.  Mercurial ointments on small surfaces at once. See Class II. 1. 4. 12.  Solutions of lead on small surfaces at once.    10. _Dolor urens._ Smarting follows the edge of a knife in making a wound,  and seems to be owing to the distention of a part of a fibre, till it  breaks. A smarting of the skin is liable to affect the scars left by herpes  or shingles; and the callous parts of the bottoms of the feet; and around  the bases of corns on the toes; and frequently extends after sciatica along  the outside of the thigh, and of the leg, and part of the foot. All these  may be owing to the stimulus of extension, by blood or serum being forced  into vessels nearly coalesced.    M. M. Emplastrum de minio put like a bandage on the part. Warm fomentation.  Oil and camphor rubbed on the part. Oil-silk covering. A blister on the  part. Ether, or alcohol, suffered to evaporate on the part.    11. _Consternatio._ Surprise. As our eyes acquaint us at the same time with  less than half of the objects, which surround us, we have learned to  confide much in the organ of hearing to warn us of approaching dangers.  Hence it happens, that if any sound strikes us, which we cannot immediately  account for, our fears are instantly alarmed. Thus in great debility of  body, the loud clapping of a door, or the fall of a fire-shovel, produces  alarm, and sometimes even convulsions; the same occurs from unexpected  sights, and in the dark from unexpected objects of touch.    In these cases the irritability is less than natural, though it is  erroneously supposed to be greater; and the mind is busied in exciting a  train of ideas inattentive to external objects; when this train of ideas is  dissevered by any unexpected stimulus, surprise is excited; as explained in  Sect. XVII. 3. 7. and XVIII. 17. then as the sensibility in these cases is  greater, fear becomes superadded to the surprise; and convulsions in  consequence of the pain of fear. See Sect. XIX. 2.    The proximate cause of surprise is the increased irritation induced by some  violent stimulus, which dissevers our usual trains of ideas; but in  diseases of inirritability the frequent starting or surprise from sounds  not uncommon, but rather louder than usual, as the clapping of a door,  shews, that the attention of the patient to a train of sensitive ideas was  previously stronger than natural, and indicates an incipient delirium;  which is therefore worth attending to in febrile diseases.           *       *       *       *       *    ORDO II.    _Decreased Irritation._    GENUS I.    _With decreased Action of the Sanguiferous System._    The reader should be here apprized, that the words strength and debility,  when applied to animal motions, may properly express the quantity of  resistance such motions may overcome; but that, when they are applied to  mean the susceptibility or insusceptibility of animal fibres to motion,  they become metaphorical terms; as in Sect. XII. 2. 1. and would be better  expressed by the words activity and inactivity.    There are three sources of animal inactivity; first, the defect of the  natural quantity of stimulus on those fibres, which have been accustomed to  perpetual stimulus; as the arterial and secerning systems. When their  accustomed stimulus is for a while intermitted, as when snow is applied to  the skin of the hands, an accumulation of sensorial power is produced; and  then a degree of stimulus, as of heat, somewhat greater than that at  present applied, though much less than the natural quantity, excites the  vessels of the skin into violent action. We must observe, that a deficiency  of stimulus in those fibres, which are not subject to perpetual stimulus,  as the locomotive muscles, is not succeeded by accumulation of sensorial  power; these therefore are more liable to become permanently inactive after  a diminution of stimulus; as in strokes of the palsy, this may be called  inactivity from defect of stimulus.    2.

The economy  rebounded in 1993-95 after a severe depression accompanying the end  of the previous centrally planned system in 1990 and 1991. However,  a weakening of government resolve to maintain stabilization policies  in the election year of 1996 contributed to renewal of inflationary  pressures, spurred by the budget deficit which exceeded 12% of GDP.  The collapse of financial pyramid schemes in early 1997 - which had  attracted deposits from a substantial portion of Albania's  population - triggered severe social unrest which led to more than  1,500 deaths, widespread destruction of property, and a 7% drop in  GDP. The government has taken measures to curb violent crime and to  revive economic activity and trade. The economy is bolstered by  remittances from some 20% of the labor force that works abroad,  mostly in Greece and Italy. These remittances supplement GDP and  help offset the large foreign trade deficit. Most agricultural land  was privatized in 1992, substantially improving peasant incomes. In  1998, Albania recovered the 7% drop in GDP of 1997 and pushed ahead  by 8% in 1999 and by 7.5% in 2000. International aid helped defray  the high costs of receiving and returning refugees from the Kosovo  conflict. Privatization scored some successes in 2000, but other  reforms lagged.
