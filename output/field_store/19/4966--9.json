George read this with a self-satisfied smirk.    \"The way to treat these fellows,\" he said to the Elder Dempster captain,  \"is to show 'em you'll stand no nonsense. I thought he'd climb down.\"    The Elder Dempster captain, who knew Sanders by repute, smiled  discreetly, but said nothing. Once more the special correspondent's  mountain of baggage was embarked in the surf boat, and the Hon. George  waved a farewell to his friends on the steamer.    The Elder Dempster skipper, leaning over the side of his bridge, watched  the surf boat rising and falling in the swell.    \"There goes a man who's looking for trouble,\" he said, \"and I wouldn't  take a half-share of the trouble he's going to find for five hundred of  the best. Is that blessed anchor up yet, Mr. Simmons? Half ahead--set  her due west, Mr. What's-your-name.\"    It was something of a triumph for the Hon. George. There were ten  uniformed policemen awaiting him on the smooth beach to handle his  baggage, and Sanders came down to his garden gate to meet him.    \"The fact of it is----\" began Sanders awkwardly; but the magnanimous  George raised his hand.    \"Let bygones,\" he said, \"be bygones.\"    Sanders was unaccountably annoyed by this generous display. Still more  so was he when the correspondent refused to reopen the question of  atrocities.    \"As your guest,\" said George solemnly, \"I feel that it would be better  for all concerned if I pursued an independent investigation. I shall  endeavour as far as possible, to put myself in your place, to consider  all extenuating circumstances----\"    \"Oh, have a gin-swizzle!\" said Sanders rudely and impatiently; \"you make  me tired.\"    \"Look here,\" he said later, \"I will only ask you two questions. Where  are these atrocities supposed to have taken place?\"    \"In the district of Lukati,\" said the Hon. George.    \"Olari,\" thought Sanders. \"Who was the victim?\" he asked.    \"There were several,\" said the correspondent, and produced his  note-book. \"You understand that I'd really much rather not discuss the  matter with you, but, since you insist,\" he read, \"Efembi of Wastambo.\"    \"Oh!\" said Sanders, and his eyebrows rose    \"Kabindo of Machembi.\"    \"Oh, lord!\" said Sanders.    The Hon. George read six other cases, and with every one a line was  wiped from Sanders' forehead.    When the recital was finished the Commissioner said slowly--    \"I can make a statement to you which will save you a great deal of  unnecessary trouble.\"    \"I would rather you didn't,\" said George, in his best judicial manner.    \"Very good,\" said Sanders; and went away whistling to order dinner.    Over the meal he put it to the correspondent:    \"There are a number of people on this station who are friends of mine. I  won't disguise the fact from you--there is O'Neill, in charge of the  Houssas; the doctor, Kennedy, the chap in charge of the survey party;  and half a dozen more. Would you like to question them?\"    \"They are friends of yours?\"    \"Yes, personal friends.\"    \"Then,\" said the Hon. George, gravely, \"perhaps it would be better if I  did not see them.\"    \"As you wish,\" said Sanders.    With an escort of four Houssas, and fifty carriers recruited from the  neighbouring villages, the Hon. George departed into the interior, and  Sanders saw him off.    \"I cannot, of course, guarantee your life,\" he said, at parting, \"and I  must warn you that the Government will not be responsible for any injury  that comes to you.\"    \"I understand,\" said the Hon. George knowingly, \"but I am not to be  deterred. I come from a stock----\"    \"I dare say,\" Sanders cut his genealogical reminiscences short; \"but the  last traveller who was 'chopped' in the bush was a D'Arcy, and his  people came over with the Conqueror.\"    The correspondent took the straight path to Lukati, and at the end of  the third day's march came to the village of Mfabo, where lived the  great witch-doctor, Kelebi.    George pitched his camp outside the village, and, accompanied by his  four Houssas, paid a call upon the chief, which was one of the first  mistakes he made, for he should have sent for the chief to call upon  him; and if he called upon anybody, he should have made his visit to the  witch-doctor, who was a greater man than forty chiefs.    In course of time, however, he found himself squatting on the ground  outside the doctor's house, engaged, through the medium of the  interpreter he had brought from Sierra Leone, in an animated  conversation with the celebrated person.    \"Tell him,\" said George to his interpreter, \"that I am a great white  chief whose heart bleeds for the native.\"    \"Is he a good man?\" asked George.    The witch-doctor, with the recollection of Sanders' threat, said \"No!\"    \"Why?\" asked the Hon. George eagerly. \"Does he beat the people?\"    Not only did he beat the people, explained the witch-doctor with relish,  but there were times when he burnt them alive.    \"This is a serious charge,\" said George, wagging his head warningly;  nevertheless he wrote with rapidity in his diary:--        \"Interviewed Kelebi, respected native doctor, who states:        \"'I have lived all my life in this district, and have never      known so cruel a man as Sandi (Sanders). I remember once he      caused a man to be drowned, the man's name I forget; on another      occasion he burned a worthy native alive for refusing to guide      him and his Houssas through the forest. I also remember the time      when he put a village to the fire, causing the people great      suffering.        \"'The people of the country groan under his oppressions, for      from time to time he comes demanding money and crops, and if he      does not receive all that he asks for he flogs the villagers      until they cry aloud.'\"    (I rather suspect that there is truth in the latter statement, for  Sanders finds no little difficulty in collecting the hut-tax, which is  the Government's due.)    George shook his head when he finished writing.    \"This,\" he said, \"looks very bad.\"    He shook hands with the witch-doctor, and that aged villain looked  surprised, and asked a question in the native tongue.    \"You no be fit to dash him somet'ing,\" said the interpreter.    \"Dash him?\"    \"Give 'um present--bottle gin.\"    \"Certainly not,\" said George. \"He may be satisfied with the knowledge  that he is rendering a service to humanity; that he is helping the cause  of a down-trodden people.\"    The witch-doctor said something in reply, which the interpreter very  wisely refrained from putting into English.           *     *     *     *     *    \"How go the investigations?\" asked the captain of Houssas three weeks  later.    \"As far as I can gather,\" said Sanders, \"our friend is collecting a  death-roll by the side of which the records of the Great Plague will  read like an advertisement of a health resort.\"    \"Where is he now?\"    \"He has got to Lukati--and I am worried\"; and Sanders looked it.    The Houssa captain nodded, for all manner of reports had come down from  Lukati country. There had been good crops, and good crops mean idleness,  and idleness means mischief. Also there had been devil dances, and the  mild people of the Bokari district, which lies contiguous to Lukati, had  lost women.    \"I've got a free hand to nip rebellion in the bud,\" Sanders reflected  moodily; \"and the chances point to rebellion----What do you say? Shall  we make a report and wait for reinforcements, or shall we chance our  luck?\"    \"It's your funeral,\" said the Houssa captain, \"and I hate to advise you.  If things go wrong you'll get the kicks; but if it were mine I'd go,  like a shot--naturally.\"    \"A hundred and forty men,\" mused Sanders.    \"And two Maxims,\" suggested the other.    \"We'll go,\" said Sanders; and half an hour later a bugle blared through  the Houssas' lines, and Sanders was writing a report to his chief in  far-away Lagos.    The Hon. George, it may be said, had no idea that he was anything but  welcome in the village of Lukati.    Olari the chief had greeted him pleasantly, and told him stories of  Sanders' brutality--stories which, as George wrote, \"if true, must of  necessity sound the death-knell of British integrity in our native  possessions.\"    Exactly what that meant, I am not disposed to guess.    George stayed a month as the guest of Lukati. He had intended to stay at  the most three days, but there was always a reason for postponing his  departure.    Once the carriers deserted, once the roads were not safe, once Olari  asked him to remain that he might see his young men dance. George did  not know that his escort of four Houssas were feeling uneasy, because  his interpreter--as big a fool as himself--could not interpret omens.  George knew nothing of the significance of a dance in which no less than  six witch-doctors took part, or the history of the tumble-down hut that  stood in solitude at one end of the village. Had he taken the trouble to  search that hut, he would have found a table, a chair, and a truckle  bed, and on the table a report, soiled with dust and rain, which began:    \"I have the honour to inform your Excellency that the natives maintain  their industrious and peaceable attitude.\"    For in this hut in his lifetime lived Carter, Deputy Commissioner; and  the natives, with their superstitious regard for the dead, had moved  nothing.    It was approaching the end of the month, when the Hon. George thought he  detected in his host a certain scarcely-veiled insolence of tone, and in  the behaviour of the villagers something more threatening.    The dances were a nightly occurrence now, and the measured stamping of  feet, the clash of spear against cane shield, and the never-ending growl  of the song the dancers sang, kept him awake at nights. Messengers came  to Olari daily from long distances, and once he was awakened in the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35554"],[0,"A Voice of Warning (#12)"],[1,"flesh, my soul mourns over you, and  had I a voice like a trumpet, I would cry, Awake, awake and arouse  from your slumber, for the time is fulfilled, your destruction is at  the door, \"for I have heard from the Lord God of Hosts, a consumption,  even determined upon the whole earth!\" Prepare to meet your God I And  again, Awake, O house of Israel, and lift up your heads, for your  redemption draweth nigh: yea, depart ye, depart ye, go ye out from  hence, gather home from your long dispersion, rebuild your cities;  yea, go ye out from the nations, from one end of heaven to the other;  but let not your flight be in haste, for the Lord shall go before you,  and the God of Israel shall be your rearward! And finally, I would say  to all, both Jew and Gentile, Repent ye, repent ye, for the great day  of the Lord is at hand; for if I, who am a man, do lift up my voice,  and call upon you to repent, and ye hate me, what will ye say when the  day cometh, when the thunders shall utter their voices to the ends of  the earth, speaking to the ears of all that live, saying: \"Repent, and  prepare for the great day of the Lord?\" Yea, again, when the  lightnings shall streak from the east unto the west, and shall utter  forth their voices unto all that live, and make the ears of all that  hear to tingle, saying these words: \"Repent ye, for the great day of  the Lord is come?\" And again, the Lord shall utter His voice out of  heaven, saying: \"Hearken, O ye nations of the earth, and hear the  words of that God who made you: O ye nations of the earth, how oft  would I have gathered you together as a hen gathereth her chickens  under her wings, but ye would not!

Behold, the day has come, when the cup of the wrath of mine  indignation is full.\"          CHAPTER III.    THE KINGDOM OF GOD.    \"Seek first the Kingdom of God.\"      This was the command of the Savior, while on the earth, teaching the  children of men.    Having taken a general view of the prophecies, past and future, we  shall now proceed to fulfil this command, and search out the kingdom  of God. But, before we advance, I would again caution the reader not  to accompany me in this research, unless he is prepared to sacrifice  everything, even to his good name, and life itself, if necessary, for  the truth; for if he should once get a view of the kingdom of God, he  will be so delighted that he never will rest satisfied short of  becoming a subject of the same. And yet it will be so unlike every  other system of religion now on earth, that he will be astonished that  any person, with the Bible in his hand, should ever have mistaken any  of the systems of men for the kingdom of God. There are certain  powers, privileges, and blessings, pertaining to the kingdom of God,  which are found in no other kingdom, nor enjoyed by any other people.  By these it was over distinguished from all other kingdoms and  systems, insomuch that the inquiring mind, seeking the kingdom of God,  and being once acquainted with these peculiarities concerning it, need  never mistake it, or be at a loss to know when he has found it. But,  before we proceed any further in our research, let us agree upon the  meaning of the term, the Kingdom of God, or the sense in which we will  use it; for some apply this term to the kingdom of glory above, and  some to the individual enjoyment of their own souls, while others  apply it to His organized government on the earth. Now, when We speak  of the kingdom of God, we wish it to be understood that we mean His  organized government on the earth.    Now, reader, we launch forth into the wide field before us in search  of a kingdom. But stop, let us consider--what is a kingdom? I reply,  that four things are required in order to constitute any kingdom in  heaven or on earth; namely, first, a king; secondly, commissioned  officers duly qualified to execute his ordinances and laws; thirdly, a  code of laws by which the subjects are governed; and fourthly,  subjects who are governed. Where these exist in their proper order and  regular authority, there is a kingdom, but where either of these  ceases to exist, there is a disorganization of the kingdom;  consequently an end of it, until reorganized after the same manner as  before. It this respect the kingdom of God is like all other kingdoms;  wherever we find officers duly commissioned and qualified by the Lord  Jesus, together with His ordinances and laws existing in purity,  unmixed with any precepts or commandments of men, there the kingdom of  God exists, and there His power is manifest, and His blessings are  enjoyed as in days of old.    We shall now take a view of the setting up of the kingdom of God in  the days of the Apostles. The first intimation of its near approach  was by an angel to Zachariah, promising him a son, who should go  before the King to prepare his way. The next manifestation was to  Mary, and finally to Joseph, by a holy angel, promising the birth of  the Messiah: while at the same time, the Holy Ghost manifested unto  Simeon, in the temple, that he should not die until he had seen the  Savior. Thus, all these, together with the shepherds and the wise men  from the east, began to rejoice with a joy unspeakable and full of  glory, while the world around them knew not the occasion of their joy.  After these things, all seemed to rest in silent expectation, until  John had grown to manhood, when he came bounding from the wilderness  of Judea, with a proclamation strange and new, crying: \"Repent ye, for  the kingdom of heaven is at hand,\" baptizing unto repentance, telling  them plainly that their King was already standing among them, on the  point of setting up His kingdom. And while he yet ministered, the  Messiah came, and was baptized, and sealed with the Spirit of God,  which rested on Him in the form of a dove; and soon after began the  same proclamation as John, saying--\"Repent ye, for the kingdom of  heaven is at hand.\" Then, after choosing twelve disciples, He sent  them forth into all the cities of Judea, with the same proclamation--  \"The kingdom of heaven is at hand;\" and after them He sent seventy,  and then another seventy, with the same news, so that all might be  well warned and prepared for a kingdom which was soon to be organized  amongst them.    But when these things had produced the desired effect, in causing a  general expectation, more especially in the hearts of His disciples,  who daily expected to triumph over their persecutors, by the  coronation of this glorious personage, while they themselves were  hoping for a reward for all their toil and sacrifices for His sake, by  being exalted to dignity near His person, what must have been their  disappointment, when they saw their King taken and crucified, having  been mocked, derided, ridiculed, and finally overcome, and triumphed  over, both by Jew and Gentile? They would gladly have died in battle  to have placed Him upon the throne; but tamely to submit without a  struggle, to give up all their expectations, and sink in despair from  the highest pitch of enthusiasm to the lowest degradation, was more  than they could well endure. They shrank back in sorrow, and returned  every man to his own net, or to their several occupations, supposing  all was over; probably with reflections like these: \"Is this the  result of all our labors? was it for this we forsook all worldly  objects, our friends, our houses and lands, suffering persecution,  hunger, fatigue and disgrace? And we trust it should have been He who  would have delivered Israel; but alas, they have killed Him, and all  is over. For three years we have awakened a general expectation  through all Judea, by telling them that the kingdom of heaven was at  hand, but now our King is dead, how shall we dare to look the people  in the face?\"    With these reflections, each pursuing his own course, all was again  turned to silence, and the voice had ceased to be heard in Judea,  crying: \"Repent ye, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.\" Jesus slept  in the arms of death; a great stone with the seal of of state, secured  the tomb where he lay, while the Roman guard stood in watchful  silence, to see that all was kept secure; when suddenly, from the  regions of glory, a mighty angel descended, at whoso presence the  soldiers fell back as dead men, while he rolled the stone from the  door of the sepulchre, and the Son of God awoke from His slumbers,  burst the bonds of death, and soon after appearing to Mary, He sent  her to the disciples with the joyful news of His resurrection, and  appointed a place to meet them. When, after seeing Him, all their  sorrow was turned into joy, and all their former hopes were suddenly  revived, they had no longer to cry--\"The kingdom of heaven is at  hand,\" but were to tarry at Jerusalem until the kingdom was  established; and they prepared to unlock the door of the kingdom, and  to adopt strangers and foreigners into it as legal citizens, by  administering certain laws and ordinances, which were invariably the  laws of adoption, and without which no man could ever become a  citizen.    Having ascended up on high, and having been crowned with all power in  heaven and on earth, He again comes to His disciples, and gives them  their authority, saying unto them: \"Go ye into all the world, and  preach the gospel to every creature. He that believeth, and is  "]]]
