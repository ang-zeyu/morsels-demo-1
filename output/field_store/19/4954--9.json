On the contrary _truei_  was invariably trapped quite near the junipers and often in association  with the large nests of _Neotoma fuscipes simplex_. In fact traps set  right on the beds of litter beneath the junipers were most likely to  catch _truei_. Records kept of trapping localities show that _truei_ was  without exception trapped within twenty feet of some treelike shelter  such as junipers, pinyons, Joshua tree or scrub oaks. Thus _Peromyscus  maniculatus_ occupies the open stretches between the trees, while  _truei_ inhabits the ground beneath and immediately adjacent to the  trees. In Nevada the pinon mouse prefers rocky areas (Hall, 1946:520).  In the San Gabriel Mountains this mouse does not seem to have this  predilection.    In the juniper belt _truei_ was second to _Dipodomys panamintinus_ in  point of numbers. In the course of 500 trap-nights in the juniper belt  twenty-two _truei_ were taken with thirty-six _Dipodomys_.    I consider my series of _Peromyscus truei_ from the desert slope of the  San Gabriels to represent the subspecies _montipinoris_. The series is  closely comparable to specimens of the subspecies _montipinoris_ in the  California Museum of Vertebrate Zoology from the Mount Pinos area, but  differs from specimens of the race _chlorus_ from the San Bernardino  Mountains in certain diagnostic characteristics. In his recent paper on  _Peromyscus truei_, Hoffmeister (1951) considered the populations of  this species in the San Gabriels to be of the race _chlorus_.  Hoffmeister had only one specimen available from the San Gabriel  Mountains (Lytle Creek, on the Pacific slope) which was intermediate  between _montipinoris_ and _chlorus_, but on the basis of cranial  measurements it was referred to the race _chlorus_. Specimens of  _Peromyscus truei_ from the eastern end of the desert slope of the San  Gabriel Mountains and the Cajon Pass area would probably demonstrate  that the race _montipinoris_, which occupies the desert slope of the San  Gabriels, intergrades with the race _chlorus_, which occurs in the San  Bernardino Range immediately to the east, in the Cajon Pass area.  Although _montipinoris_ occurs on the desert slope of the San Gabriels,  _chlorus_ may occur on the Pacific slope. I took no specimens of the  pinon mouse on the Pacific slope of the San Gabriel Mountains.    In December, 1948, many small juveniles were taken in the juniper  belt, and on October 15, 1951, two females trapped at the head of  Grandview Canyon had embryos: one three and the other four. On November  13, 1951, a partially gray-pelaged subadult female was trapped which had  recently suckled young.        _Specimens examined._--Total, 17, all in Illinois Museum of      Natural History, distributed as follows: Los Angeles County:      Mescal Canyon, 4500 ft., 8 mi.

This mouse inhabited the barren sandy channels of Mescal  Wash but was rare on the adjacent juniper-clad benches. In the arid,  sandy washes this typical desert rodent penetrated the high  pinyon-juniper association.    Wherever grasshopper mice occurred they were outnumbered by most of the  other rodent species. For example, on November 26, 1949, below Graham  Canyon, 100 snap traps yielded 10 _Dipodomys panamintinus mohavensis_, 2  _Dipodomys merriami merriami_, 4 _Peromyscus maniculatus sonoriensis_,  and 3 _Onychomys torridus pulcher_.    Where abandoned kangaroo rat burrows were common in the Joshua tree belt  these burrows were used as retreats by _Onychomys_. Some traps set at  the entrances to old burrows caught grasshopper mice.        _Specimens examined._--Total, 7, distributed as follows: Los      Angeles County: 8 mi. E and 3 mi.

S Valyermo, 4600 ft., 1 (PC).      =Neotoma lepida intermedia= Rhoads    Desert Woodrat    This species was on the Pacific face of the Mountains from 1600 feet  elevation in the coastal sage belt, to 4800 feet elevation in open  groves of big cone-spruce and scrub oak of the chaparral association.    The local distribution of this woodrat is determined by suitable nesting  sites. Although taken in different types of vegetation, _lepida_,  without exception, was associated with rocky areas or areas supporting  patches of prickly-pear cactus. In the channels of San Antonio Wash,  _lepida_ was commonly associated with jumbles of boulders and  boulder-dotted cut banks. There the vegetation is sparse, and the rats  dwell among the rocks; only their droppings and faint trails indicate  their presence. Among boulders _lepida_ builds only small houses of  sticks and debris, and even these only occasionally. The effect of the  prickly-pear cactus on the distribution of _lepida_ in the sageland is  striking; trap lines there yielded no woodrats where extensive rock  piles and patches of prickly-pear were absent, but many rats were taken  where patches of prickly-pear are plentiful. On an acre supporting  coastal sagebrush at the mouth of San Antonio Canyon, at 1800 feet  elevation, there were fourteen patches of prickly-pear, each covering at  least thirty square feet. In these patches there were thirteen occupied  woodrat nests. Only one patch lacked an occupied nest, and this one  contained the remains of an old nest. On this acre there were at least  thirteen individuals. In the sagebrush belt only an occasional large  patch of cactus lacks a woodrat house occupied by _lepida_. Seemingly  _Neotoma fuscipes_ does not build houses in patches of prickly-pear.    Most of the houses built by _Neotoma lepida_ are small and simple as  compared to those of _Neotoma fuscipes_, and often in rocky areas no  nests are in evidence. The most elaborate nests are built among the pads  and spines of the prickly-pear and under laurel sumac or other large  shrubs growing near washes. One of three houses examined at the mouth of  San Antonio Canyon was on sandy ground in a patch of _Opuntia_ measuring  approximately 11 x 14 feet. The house was 14 inches high and 41 x 37  inches at the base. It was built around the main stem of the  prickly-pear and a rock about 10 inches in diameter. The house was  constructed of sticks of coastal sagebrush and buckwheat, and was dotted  with dissected fruits and flowers of the prickly-pear. The main chamber  was arched over by the main stem of the prickly-pear and was roughly 12  x 19 inches, inside dimensions, being reached through two three-inch  openings, one on the east side of the chamber and one on the north side  of the chamber. Two cup-shaped nests were inside the chamber, these  being constructed mostly of grasses, and each resembling a well  constructed bird nest 4 inches in diameter. The grass nests were free of  feces, but feces were piled up against the west side of the chamber with  many snail shells and dissected fruits and flowers of prickly-pear.  Thirty-five inches from the main chamber was a third grass nest on the  ground beneath a cluster of cactus pads. Next to this there was a blind  burrow about eight inches long, and one and three-quarters inches in  diameter. No burrow led to the main chamber, in this or in either of the  other houses, but all had at least one short blind burrow beneath the  house.    At many houses there were one to three grass nests outside the house on  the ground, within four feet of the house. From each nest a well worn  path lead to the house. Traps set in these nests invariably caught  woodrats.    The many prickly-pear fruits and snail shells in and around the houses  of _lepida_ probably were remnants of food. So many of the rodents  caught in traps near woodrat nests were partly eaten--usually the brains  were taken--that I suspect the woodrats of eating their relatives. The  heads of many composite annuals were piled near woodrat nests.    Immature individuals were taken in September, October, and early  November, and on September 26, 1951, a lactating female was trapped near  Palmer Canyon.    An old female bobcat trapped in Thompson Canyon had masses of cactus  thorns beneath her skin, especially about the forelegs. These thorns  were probably received while she was foraging in growths of prickly-pear  for woodrats. The other bobcats from San Antonio Wash also had  accumulations of thorns under the skin of the forelegs. Fragments of the  skulls of _Neotoma lepida_ were recovered from horned owl pellets and  coyote feces.        _Specimens examined._--Total, 7, distributed as follows: Los      Angeles County: San Antonio Canyon, 4500 ft., 2; San Antonio      Wash, 1800 ft., 5 (2 PC).      =Neotoma lepida lepida= Thomas    Desert Woodrat    These woodrats were present in rocky situations along the desert slope  from the lower edge of the juniper belt down into the desert. Specimens  were taken in piles of boulders in Mescal Wash, and amid rock  outcroppings on the steep, barren, south slopes at the base of Grandview  Canyon, whereas none was found on the juniper-clad benches.    This woodrat built no nests in rocky areas; however, in the Joshua tree  belt _N. l. lepida_ often built small nests at the bases of large  standing or prostrate Joshua trees. There sticks from creosote bushes,  along with cow dung and small stones were favorite building materials.  Judging from the large number of unused woodrat nests in the Joshua tree  flats it seemed that this rat was formerly far more common than it was  in the period of this study.        _Specimens examined._--Total, 9, distributed as"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34853"],[0,"The Fairy-Faith in Celtic Countries (#12)"],[1," _good  people_ here on the Hill a hundred times, and they'd always be talking  about them. The _good people_ can see everything, and you dare not  meddle with them. They live in _raths_, and their houses are in them.  The opinion always was that they are a race of spirits, for they can go  into different forms, and can appear big as well as little.'      EVIDENCE FROM KILMESSAN, NEAR TARA    John Boylin, born in County Meath about sixty years ago, will be our  witness from Kilmessan, a village about two miles from Tara; and he,  being one of the men of the vicinity best informed about its folk-lore,  is able to offer testimony of very great value:--    _The Fairy Tribes._--'There is said to be a whole tribe of little red  men living in Glen Odder, between Ringlestown and Tara; and on long  evenings in June they have been heard. There are other breeds or castes  of fairies; and it seems to me, when I recall our ancient traditions,  that some of these fairies are of the Fir Bolgs, some of the Tuatha De  Danann, and some of the Milesians. All of them have been seen  serenading round the western slope of Tara, dressed in ancient Irish  costumes. Unlike the little red men, these fairy races are warlike and  given to making invasions. Long processions of them have been seen going  round the King's Chair (an earthwork on which the Kings of Tara are said  to have been crowned); and they then would appear like soldiers of  ancient Ireland in review.'    _The Fairy Procession._--'We were told as children, that, as soon as  night fell, the fairies from Rath Ringlestown would form in a  procession, across Tara road, pass round certain bushes which have not  been disturbed for ages, and join the _gangkena_ (?) or host of  industrious folk, the red fairies. We were afraid, and our nurses always  brought us home before the advent of the fairy procession. One of the  passes used by this procession happened to be between two mud-wall  houses; and it is said that a man went out of one of these houses at the  wrong time, for when found he was dead: the fairies had _taken_ him  because he interfered with their procession.'[12]    _Death through Cutting Fairy-Bushes._--'A man named Caffney cut as fuel  to boil his pot of potatoes some of these undisturbed bushes round which  the fairies pass. When he put the wood under the pot, though it spat  fire, and fire-sparkles would come out of it, it would not burn. The man  pined away gradually. In six months after cutting the fairy-bushes, he  was dead. Just before he died, he told his experiences with the wood to  his brother, and his brother told me.'    _The Fairies are the Dead._--'According to the local belief, fairies are  the spirits of the departed. Tradition says that Hugh O'Neil in the  sixteenth century, after his march to the south, encamped his army on  the _Rath_ or _Fort_ of Ringlestown, to be assisted by the spirits of  the mighty dead who dwelt within this _rath_. And it is believed that  Gerald Fitzgerald has been seen coming out of the Hill of Mollyellen,  down in County Louth, leading his horse and dressed in the old Irish  costume, with breastplate, spear, and war outfit.'    _Fairy Possession._--'Rose Carroll was possessed by a fairy-spirit. It  is known that her father held communion with evil spirits, and it  appears that they often assisted him. The Carrolls' house was built at  the end of a fairy _fort_, and part of it was scooped out of this  _fort_. Rose grew so peculiar that her folks locked her up. After two  years she was able to shake off the fairy possession by being taken to  Father Robinson's sisters, and then to an old witch-woman in Drogheda.'      IN THE VALLEY OF THE BOYNE    In walking along the River Boyne, from Slane to Knowth and New Grange, I  stopped at the cottage of Owen Morgan, at Ross-na-Righ, or 'the Wood of  the Kings', though the ancient wood has long since disappeared; and as  we sat looking out over the sunlit beauty of Ireland's classic river,  and in full view of the first of the famous _moats_, this is what Owen  Morgan told me:--    _How the Shoemaker's Daughter became the Queen of Tara._--'In olden  times there lived a shoemaker and his wife up there near Moat Knowth,  and their first child was taken by the queen of the fairies who lived  inside the moat, and a little leprechaun left in its place. The same  exchange was made when the second child was born. At the birth of the  third child the fairy queen came again and ordered one of her three  servants to take the child; but the child could not be moved because of  a great beam of iron, too heavy to lift, which lay across the baby's  breast. The second servant and then the third failed like the first, and  the queen herself could not move the child. The mother being short of  pins had used a needle to fasten the child's clothes, and that was what  appeared to the fairies as a beam of iron, for there was virtue in steel  in those days.    'So the fairy queen decided to bestow gifts upon the child; and advised  each of the three servants to give, in turn, a different gift. The first  one said, \"May she be the grandest lady in the world\"; the second one  said, \"May she be the greatest singer in the world\"; and the third one  said, \"May she be the best mantle-maker in the world.\" Then the fairy  queen said, \"Your gifts are all very good, but I will give a gift of my  own better than any of them: the first time she happens to go out of the  house let her come back into it under the form of a rat.\" The mother  heard all that the fairy women said, and so she never permitted her  daughter to leave the house.    'When the girl reached the age of eighteen, it happened that the young  prince of Tara, in riding by on a hunt, heard her singing, and so  entranced was he with the music that he stopped to listen; and, the song  ended, he entered the house, and upon seeing the wonderful beauty of the  singer asked her to marry him. The mother said that could not be, and  taking the daughter out of the house for the first time brought her back  into it in an apron under the form of a rat, that the prince might  understand the refusal.    'This enchantment, however, did not change the prince's love for the  beautiful singer; and he explained how there was a day mentioned with  his father, the king, for all the great ladies of Ireland to assemble in  the Halls of Tara, and that the grandest lady and the greatest singer  and the best mantle-maker would be chosen as his wife. When he added  that each lady must come in a chariot, the rat spoke to him and said  that he must send to her home, on the day named, four piebald cats and a  pack of cards, and that she would make her appearance, provided that at  the time her chariot came to the Halls of Tara no one save the prince  should be allowed near it; and, she finally said to the prince, \"Until  the day mentioned with your father, you must carry me as a rat in your  pocket.\"    'But before the great day arrived, the rat had made everything known to  one of the fairy women, and so when the four piebald cats and the pack  of cards reached the girl's home, the fairies at once turned the cats  into the four most splendid horses in the world, and the pack of cards  into the most wonderful chariot in the world; and, as the chariot was  setting out from the Moat for Tara, the fairy queen clapped her hands  and laughed, and the enchantment over the girl was broken, so that she  became, as before, the prettiest lady in the world, and she sitting in  the chariot.    'When the prince saw the wonderful chariot coming, he knew whose it was,  and went out alone to meet it; but he could not believe his eyes on  seeing the lady inside. And then she told him about the witches and  fairies, and explained everything.    'Hundreds of ladies had come to the Halls of Tara from all Ireland, and  every one as grand as could be. The contest began with the singing, and  ended with the mantle-making, and the young girl was the last to appear;  but to the amazement of all the company the king had to give in (admit)  that the strange woman was the grandest lady, the greatest singer, and  the best mantle-maker in Ireland; and when the old king died she became  the Queen of Tara.'    After this ancient legend, which Owen Morgan heard from the old folks  when he was a boy, he told me many anecdotes about the 'good people' of  the Boyne, who are little men usually dressed in red.    _The 'Good People' at New Grange._--Between Knowth and New Grange I met  Maggie Timmons carrying a pail of butter-milk to her calves; and when we  stopped on the road to talk, I asked her, in due time, if any of the  'good people' ever appeared in the region, or about New Grange, which we  could see in the field, and she replied, in reference to New Grange:--'I  am sure the neighbours used to see the _good people_ come out of it at  night and in the morning. The _good people_ inherited the _fort_.'    Then I asked her what the 'good people' are, and she said:--'When they  disappear they go like fog; they must be something like spirits, or how  could they disappear in that way? I knew of people,' she added, 'who  would milk in the fields about here and spill milk on the ground for the  _good people_; and pots of potatoes would be put out for the _good  people_ at night.' (See chap. viii for additional New Grange folk-lore.)      THE TESTIMONY OF AN IRISH PRIEST    We now pass directly to West Ireland, in many ways our most important  field, and where of all places in the Celtic world the Fairy-Faith is  vigorously alive; and it seems very fitting to offer the first  opportunity to testify in behalf of that district to a scholarly priest  of the Roman Church, for what he tells us is almost wholly the result of  his own memories and experiences as an Irish boy in Connemara,  supplemented in a valuable way by his wider and more mature knowledge of  the fairy-belief as he sees it now among his own"]]]
