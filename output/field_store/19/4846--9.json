[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2846"],[0,"The Life of Flavius Josephus (#12)"],[1," country engaged in, both against the Romans and against the king  [Agrippa, junior] For before ever I was appointed governor of Galilee by  the community of Jerusalem, both thou and all the people of Tiberias  had not only taken up arms, but had made war with Decapolis of Syria.  Accordingly, thou hadst ordered their villages to be burnt, and a  domestic servant of thine fell in the battle. Nor is it I only who  say this; but so it is written in the Commentaries of Vespasian, the  emperor; as also how the inhabitants of Decapolis came clamoring to  Vespasian at Ptolemais, and desired that thou, who wast the author [of  that war], mightest be brought to punishment. And thou hadst certainly  been punished at the command of Vespasian, had not king Agrippa, who had  power given him to have thee put to death, at the earnest entreaty  of his sister Bernice, changed the punishment from death into a long  imprisonment. Thy political administration of affairs afterward doth  also clearly discover both thy other behavior in life, and that thou  wast the occasion of thy country's revolt from the Romans; plain signs  of which I shall produce presently. I have also a mind to say a few  things to the rest of the people of Tiberias on thy account, and to  demonstrate to those that light upon this history, that you bare no  good-will, neither to the Romans, nor to the king. To be sure, the  greatest cities of Galilee, O Justus! were Sepphoris, and thy country  Tiberias. But Sepphoris, situated in the very midst of Galilee, and  having many villages about it, and able with ease to have been bold and  troublesome to the Romans, if they had so pleased, yet did it resolve to  continue faithful to those their masters, and at the same time excluded  me out of their city, and prohibited all their citizens from joining  with the Jews in the war; and, that they might be out of danger from me,  they, by a wile, got leave of me to fortify their city with walls: they  also, of their own accord, admitted of a garrison of Roman legions, sent  them by Cestlus Gallus, who was then president of Syria, and so had  me in contempt, though I was then very powerful, and all were greatly  afraid of me; and at the same time that the greatest of our cities,  Jerusalem, was besieged, and that temple of ours, which belonged to  us all, was in danger of falling under the enemy's power, they sent no  assistance thither, as not willing to have it thought they would bear  arms against the Romans. But as for thy country, O Justus: situated upon  the lake of Gennesareth, and distance from Hippos thirty furlongs,  from Gadara sixty, and from Scythopolis, which was under the king's  jurisdiction, a hundred and twenty; when there was no Jewish city near,  it might easily have preserved its fidelity [to the Romans,] if it  had so pleased them to do, for the city and its people had plenty of  weapons. But, as thou sayest, I was then the author [of their revolts].  And pray, O Justus! who was that author afterwards? For thou knowest  that I was in the power of the Romans before Jerusalem was besieged, and  before the same time Jotapata was taker by force, as well as many other  fortresses, and a great many of the Galileans fell in the war. It was  therefore then a proper time, when you were certainly freed from any  fear on my account, to throw away your weapons, and to demonstrate to  the king and to the Romans, that it was not of choice, but as forced by  necessity, that you fell into the war against them; but you staid till  Vespasian came himself as far as your walls, with his whole army; and  then you did indeed lay aside your weapons out of fear, and your city  had for certain been taken by force, unless Vespasian had complied with  the king's supplication for you, and had excused your madness. It was  not I, therefore, who was the author of this, but your own inclinations  to war. Do not you remember how often I got you under my power, and yet  put none of you to death? Nay, you once fell into a tumult one against  another, and slew one hundred and eighty-five of your citizens, not on  account of your good-will to the king and to the Romans, but on account  of your own wickedness, and this while I was besieged by the Romans in  Jotapata. Nay, indeed, were there not reckoned up two thousand of the  people of Tiberias during the siege of Jerusalem, some of whom were  slain, and the rest caught and carried captives? But thou wilt pretend  that thou didst not engage in the war, since thou didst flee to the  king. Yes, indeed, thou didst flee to him; but I say it was out of fear  of me. Thou sayest, indeed, that it is I who am a wicked man. But then,  for what reason was it that king Agrippa, who procured thee thy life  when thou wast condemned to die by Vespian, and who bestowed so much  riches upon thee, did twice afterward put thee in bonds, and as often  obliged thee to run away from thy country, and, when he had once ordered  thee to be put to death, he granted thee a pardon at the earnest desire  of Bernice? And when [after so many of thy wicked pranks] he made thee  his secretary, he caught thee falsifying his epistles, and drove thee  away from his sight. But I shall not inquire accurately into these  matters of scandal against thee. Yet cannot I but wonder at thy  impudence, when thou hast the assurance to say, that thou hast better  related these affairs [of the war] than have all the others that have  written about them, whilst thou didst not know what was done in Galilee;  for thou wast then at Berytus with the king; nor didst thou know how  much the Romans suffered at the siege of Jotapata, or what miseries they  brought upon us; nor couldst thou learn by inquiry what I did during  that siege myself; for all those that might afford such information  were quite destroyed in that siege. But perhaps thou wilt say, thou hast  written of what was done against the people of Jerusalem exactly. But  how should that be? for neither wast thou concerned in that war, nor  hast thou read the commentaries of Caesar; of which we have evident  proof, because thou hast contradicted those commentaries of Caesar  in thy history. But if thou art so hardy as to affirm, that thou hast  written that history better than all the rest, why didst thou not  publish thy history while the emperors Vespasian and Titus, the generals  in that war, as well as king Agrippa and his family, who were men very  well skilled in the learning of the Greeks, were all alive? for thou  hast had it written these twenty years, and then mightest thou have had  the testimony of thy accuracy. But now when these men are no longer with  us, and thou thinkest thou canst not be contradicted, thou venturest to  publish it. But then I was not in like manner afraid of my own writing,  but I offered my books to the emperors themselves, when the facts were  almost under men's eyes; for I was conscious to myself, that I had  observed the truth of the facts; and as I expected to have their  attestation to them, so I was not deceived in such expectation.  Moreover, I immediately presented my history to many other persons, some  of whom were concerned in the war, as was king Agrippa and some of his  kindred. Now the emperor Titus was so desirous that the knowledge of  these affairs should be taken from these books alone, that he subscribed  his own hand to them, and ordered that they should be published; and for  king Agrippa, he wrote me sixty-two letters, and attested to the truth  of what I had therein delivered; two of which letters I have here  subjoined, and thou mayst thereby know their contents:-- \"King Agrippa  to Josephus, however, when thou comest to me, I will inform thee of a  great many things which thou dost not know.\" So when this history was  perfected, Agrippa, neither by way of flattery, which was not agreeable  to him, nor by way of irony, as thou wilt say, [for he was entirely a  stranger to such an evil disposition of mind,] but he wrote this by way  of attestation to what was true, as all that read histories may do. And  so much shall be said concerning Justus [24] which I am obliged to add  by way of digression.    66. Now, when I had settled the affairs of Tiberias, and had assembled  my friends as a sanhedrim, I consulted what I should do as to John.  Whereupon it appeared to be the opinion of all the Galileans, that  I should arm them all, and march against John, and punish him as the  author of all the disorders that had happened. Yet was not I pleased  with their determination; as purposing to compose these troubles without  bloodshed. Upon this I exhorted them to use the utmost care to learn  the names of all that were under John; which when they had done, and I  thereby was apprized who the men were, I published an edict, wherein I  offered security and my right hand to such of John's party as had a mind  to repent; and I allowed twenty days' time to such as would take this  most advantageous course for themselves. I also threatened, that unless  they threw down their arms, I would burn their houses, and expose their  goods to public sale. When the men heard of this, they were in no small  disorder, and deserted John; and to the number of four thousand threw  down their arms, and came to me. So that no others staid with John but  his own citizens, and about fifteen hundred strangers that came from the  metropolis of Tyre; and when John saw that he had been outwitted by my  stratagem, he continued afterward in his own country, and was in great  fear of me.    67. But about this time it was that the people of Sepphoris grew  insolent, and took up arms, out of a confidence they had in the strength  of their walls, and because they saw me engaged in other affairs also.  So they sent to Cestius Gallus, who was president of Syria, and desired  that he would either come quickly to them, and take their city under his  protection, or send them a garrison. Accordingly, Gallus promised"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2848"],[0,"Antiquities of the Jews (#12)"],[1," him  the tenth part of his prey, he accepted of the gift: but the king of  Sodom desired Abram to take the prey, but entreated that he might have  those men restored to him whom Abram had saved from the Assyrians,  because they belonged to him. But Abram would not do so; nor would make  any other advantage of that prey than what his servants had eaten; but  still insisted that he should afford a part to his friends that had  assisted him in the battle. The first of them was called Eschol, and  then Enner, and Mambre.    3. And God commended his virtue, and said, Thou shalt not however lose  the rewards thou hast deserved to receive by such thy glorious actions.  He answered, And what advantage will it be to me to have such rewards,  when I have none to enjoy them after me?for he was hitherto childless.  And God promised that he should have a son, and that his posterity  should be very numerous; insomuch that their number should be like the  stars. When he heard that, he offered a sacrifice to God, as he  commanded him. The manner of the sacrifice was this:He took an heifer  of three years old, and a she-goat of three years old, and a ram in like  manner of three years old, and a turtle-dove, and a pigeon 19 and as he  was enjoined, he divided the three former, but the birds he did not  divide. After which, before he built his altar, where the birds of prey  flew about, as desirous of blood, a Divine voice came to him, declaring  that their neighbors would be grievous to his posterity, when they  should be in Egypt, for four hundred years; 20 during which time they  should be afflicted, but afterwards should overcome their enemies,  should conquer the Canaanites in war, and possess themselves of their  land, and of their cities.    4. Now Abram dwelt near the oak called Ogyges,the place belongs to  Canaan, not far from the city of Hebron. But being uneasy at his wife's  barrenness, he entreated God to grant that he might have male issue; and  God required of him to be of good courage, and said that he would add to  all the rest of the benefits that he had bestowed upon him, ever since  he led him out of Mesopotamia, the gift of children. Accordingly Sarai,  at God's command, brought to his bed one of her handmaidens, a woman of  Egyptian descent, in order to obtain children by her; and when this  handmaid was with child, she triumphed, and ventured to affront Sarai,  as if the dominion were to come to a son to be born of her. But when  Abram resigned her into the hand of Sarai, to punish her, she contrived  to fly away, as not able to bear the instances of Sarai's severity to  her; and she entreated God to have compassion on her. Now a Divine Angel  met her, as she was going forward in the wilderness, and bid her return  to her master and mistress, for if she would submit to that wise advice,  she would live better hereafter; for that the reason of her being in  such a miserable case was this, that she had been ungrateful and  arrogant towards her mistress. He also told her, that if she disobeyed  God, and went on still in her way, she should perish; but if she would  return back, she should become the mother of a son who should reign over  that country. These admonitions she obeyed, and returned to her master  and mistress, and obtained forgiveness. A little while afterwards, she  bare Ismael; which may be interpreted Heard of God, because God had  heard his mother's prayer.    5. The forementioned son was born to Abram when he was eighty-six years  old: but when he was ninety-nine, God appeared to him, and promised him  that he Should have a son by Sarai, and commanded that his name should  be Isaac; and showed him, that from this son should spring great nations  and kings, and that they should obtain all the land of Canaan by war,  from Sidon to Egypt. But he charged him, in order to keep his posterity  unmixed with others, that they should be circumcised in the flesh of  their foreskin, and that this should be done on the eighth day after  they were born: the reason of which circumcision I will explain in  another place. And Abram inquiring also concerning Ismael, whether he  should live or not, God signified to him that he should live to be very  old, and should be the father of great nations. Abram therefore gave  thanks to God for these blessings; and then he, and all his family, and  his son Ismael, were circumcised immediately; the son being that day  thirteen years of age, and he ninety-nine.              CHAPTER 11. How God Overthrew The Nation Of The Sodomites, Out Of His  Wrath Against Them For Their Sins.    1. About this time the Sodomites grew proud, on account of their riches  and great wealth; they became unjust towards men, and impious towards  God, insomuch that they did not call to mind the advantages they  received from him: they hated strangers, and abused themselves with  Sodomitical practices. God was therefore much displeased at them, and  determined to punish them for their pride, and to overthrow their city,  and to lay waste their country, until there should neither plant nor  fruit grow out of it.    2. When God had thus resolved concerning the Sodomites, Abraham, as he  sat by the oak of Mambre, at the door of his tent, saw three angels; and  thinking them to be strangers, he rose up, and saluted them, and desired  they would accept of an entertainment, and abide with him; to which,  when they agreed, he ordered cakes of meal to be made presently; and  when he had slain a calf, he roasted it, and brought it to them, as they  sat under the oak. Now they made a show of eating; and besides, they  asked him about his wife Sarah, where she was; and when he said she was  within, they said they would come again hereafter, and find her become a  mother. Upon which the woman laughed, and said that it was impossible  she should bear children, since she was ninety years of age, and her  husband was a hundred. Then they concealed themselves no longer, but  declared that they were angels of God; and that one of them was sent to  inform them about the child, and two of the overthrow of Sodom.    3. When Abraham heard this, he was grieved for the Sodomites; and he  rose up, and besought God for them, and entreated him that he would not  destroy the righteous with the wicked. And when God had replied that  there was no good man among the Sodomites; for if there were but ten  such man among them, he would not punish any of them for their sins,  Abraham held his peace. And the angels came to the city of the  Sodomites, and Lot entreated them to accept of a lodging with him; for  he was a very generous and hospitable man, and one that had learned to  imitate the goodness of Abraham. Now when the Sodomites saw the young  men to be of beautiful countenances, and this to an extraordinary  degree, and that they took up their lodgings with Lot, they resolved  themselves to enjoy these beautiful boys by force and violence; and when  Lot exhorted them to sobriety, and not to offer any thing immodest to  the strangers, but to have regard to their lodging in his house; and  promised that if their inclinations could not be governed, he would  expose his daughters to their lust, instead of these strangers; neither  thus were they made ashamed.    4. But God was much displeased at their impudent behavior, so that he  both smote those men with blindness, and condemned the Sodomites to  universal destruction. But Lot, upon God's informing him of the future  destruction of the Sodomites, went away, taking with him his wife and  daughters, who were two, and still virgins; for those that were  betrothed 21 to them were above the thoughts of going, and deemed that  Lot's words were trifling. God then cast a thunderbolt upon the city,  and set it on fire, with its inhabitants; and laid waste the country  with the like burning, as I formerly said when I wrote the Jewish War.  22 But Lot's wife continually turning back to view the city as she went  from it, and being too nicely inquisitive what would become of it,  although God had forbidden her so to do, was changed into a pillar of  salt;23 for I have seen it, and it remains at this day. Now he and his  daughters fled to a certain small place, encompassed with the fire, and  settled in it: it is to this day called Zoar, for that is the word which  the Hebrews use for a small thing. There it was that he lived a  miserable life, on account of his having no company, and his want of  provisions.    5. But his daughters, thinking that all mankind were destroyed,  approached to their father, 24 though taking care not to be perceived.  This they did, that human kind might not utterly fail: and they bare  sons; the son of the elder was named Moab, Which denotes one derived  from his father; the younger bare Ammon, which name denotes one derived  from a kinsman. The former of whom was the father of the Moabites, which  is even still a great nation; the latter was the father of the  Ammonites; and both of them are inhabitants of Celesyria. And such was  the departure of Lot from among the Sodomites.              CHAPTER 12. Concerning Abimelech; And Concerning Ismael The Son Of  Abraham; And Concerning The Arabians, Who Were His Posterity.    1. Abraham now removed to Gerar of Palestine, leading Sarah along with  him, under the notion of his sister, using the like dissimulation that  he had used before, and this out of fear: for he was afraid of  Abimelech, the king of that country, who did also himself fall in love  with Sarah, and was disposed to corrupt her; but he was restrained from  satisfying his lust by a dangerous distemper which befell him from God.  Now when his physicians despaired of curing him, he fell asleep, and saw  a dream, warning him not to abuse the stranger's wife; and when he  recovered, he told his friends that God had inflicted that disease upon  him, by way of punishment, for his injury to the stranger; and in order  to preserve the chastity of"]]]
