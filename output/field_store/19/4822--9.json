The United States has carried on foreign intelligence activities since  the days of George Washington but only since World War II have they  been coordinated on a government-wide basis. Three programs have  highlighted the development of coordinated basic intelligence since  that time: (1) the Joint Army Navy Intelligence Studies (JANIS), (2)  the National Intelligence Survey (NIS), and (3) The World Factbook.    During World War II, intelligence consumers realized that the  production of basic intelligence by different components of the US  Government resulted in a great duplication of effort and conflicting  information. The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941 brought home  to leaders in Congress and the executive branch the need for  integrating departmental reports to national policymakers. Detailed and  coordinated information was needed not only on such major powers as  Germany and Japan, but also on places of little previous interest. In  the Pacific Theater, for example, the Navy and Marines had to launch  amphibious operations against many islands about which information was  unconfirmed or nonexistent. Intelligence authorities resolved that the  United States should never again be caught unprepared.    In 1943, Gen. George B. Strong (G-2), Adm. H. C. Train (Office of Naval  Intelligence - ONI), and Gen. William J. Donovan (Director of the  Office of Strategic Services - OSS) decided that a joint effort should  be initiated. A steering committee was appointed on 27 April 1943 that  recommended the formation of a Joint Intelligence Study Publishing  Board to assemble, edit, coordinate, and publish the Joint Army Navy  Intelligence Studies (JANIS). JANIS was the first interdepartmental  basic intelligence program to fulfill the needs of the US Government  for an authoritative and coordinated appraisal of strategic basic  intelligence. Between April 1943 and July 1947, the board published 34  JANIS studies. JANIS performed well in the war effort, and numerous  letters of commendation were received, including a statement from Adm.  Forrest Sherman, Chief of Staff, Pacific Ocean Areas, which said,  \"JANIS has become the indispensable reference work for the shore-based  planners.\"         The need for more comprehensive basic intelligence in the postwar  world was well expressed in 1946 by George S. Pettee, a noted author on  national security. He wrote in The Future of American Secret  Intelligence (Infantry Journal Press, 1946, page 46) that world  leadership in peace requires even more elaborate intelligence than in  war. \"The conduct of peace involves all countries, all human activities  - not just the enemy and his war production.\"         The Central Intelligence Agency was established on 26 July 1947  and officially began operating on 18 September 1947. Effective 1  October 1947, the Director of Central Intelligence assumed operational  responsibility for JANIS. On 13 January 1948, the National Security  Council issued Intelligence Directive (NSCID) No. 3, which authorized  the National Intelligence Survey (NIS) program as a peacetime  replacement for the wartime JANIS program. Before adequate NIS country  sections could be produced, government agencies had to develop more  comprehensive gazetteers and better maps. The US Board on Geographic  Names (BGN) compiled the names; the Department of the Interior produced  the gazetteers; and CIA produced the maps.    The Hoover Commission's Clark Committee, set up in 1954 to study the  structure and administration of the CIA, reported to Congress in 1955  that: \"The National Intelligence Survey is an invaluable publication  which provides the essential elements of basic intelligence on all  areas of the world. There will always be a continuing requirement for  keeping the Survey up-to-date.\" The Factbook was created as an annual  summary and update to the encyclopedic NIS studies. The first  classified Factbook was published in August 1962, and the first  unclassified version was published in June 1971. The NIS program was  terminated in 1973 except for the Factbook, map, and gazetteer  components. The 1975 Factbook was the first to be made available to the  public with sales through the US Government Printing Office (GPO). The  year 2005 marks the 58th anniversary of the establishment of the  Central Intelligence Agency and the 62nd year of continuous basic  intelligence support to the US Government by The World Factbook and its  two predecessor programs.

Scarcely had Gregory emptied his before he fell forward on  the table.    \"Good!\" said Vaninka to her maid in a low voice: \"the opium is taking  effect.\"    \"What do you mean to do?\" said Annouschka.    \"You will soon see,\" was the answer.    The two moujiks followed the example of the master of the house, and  fell down side by side on the ground. Ivan was left struggling against  sleep, and trying to sing a drinking song; but soon his tongue refused  to obey him, his eyes closed in spite of him, and seeking the tune that  escaped him, and muttering words he was unable to pronounce, he fell  fast asleep near his companions.    Immediately Vaninka rose, fixed them with flashing eyes, and called them  by name one after another. There was no response.    Then she clapped her hands and cried joyfully, \"The moment has come!\"  Going to the back of the room, she brought thence an armful of straw,  placed it in a corner of the room, and did the same in the other  corners. She then took a flaming brand from the stove and set fire in  succession to the four corners of the room.    \"What are you doing?\" said Annouschka, wild with terror, trying to stop  her.    \"I am going to bury our secret in the ashes of this house,\" answered  Vaninka.    \"But my brother, my poor brother!\" said the girl.    \"Your brother is a wretch who has betrayed me, and we are lost if we do  not destroy him.\"    \"Oh, my brother, my poor brother!\"    \"You can die with him if you like,\" said Vaninka, accompanying the  proposal with a smile which showed she would not have been sorry if  Annouschka had carried sisterly affection to that length.    \"But look at the fire, madam--the fire!\"    \"Let us go, then,\" said Vaninka; and, dragging out the heart-broken  girl, she locked the door behind her and threw the key far away into the  snow.    \"In the name of Heaven,\" said Annouschka, \"let us go home quickly: I  cannot gaze upon this awful sight!\"    \"No, let us stay here!\" said Vaninka, holding her back with a grasp of  almost masculine strength. \"Let us stay until the house falls in on  them, so that we may be certain that not one of them escapes.\"    \"Oh, my God!\" cried Annouschka, falling on her knees, \"have mercy upon  my poor brother, for death will hurry him unprepared into Thy presence.\"    \"Yes, yes, pray; that is right,\" said Vaninka. \"I wish to destroy their  bodies, not their souls.\"    Vaninka stood motionless, her arms crossed, brilliantly lit up by the  flames, while her attendant prayed. The fire did not last long: the  house was wooden, with the crevices filled with oakum, like all those of  Russian peasants, so that the flames, creeping out at the four corners,  soon made great headway, and, fanned by the wind, spread rapidly to all  parts of the building. Vaninka followed the progress of the fire with  blazing eyes, fearing to see some half-burnt spectral shape rush out of  the flames. At last the roof fell in, and Vaninka, relieved of all fear,  then at last made her way to the general's house, into which the two  women entered without being seen, thanks to the permission Annouschka  had to go out at any hour of the day or night.    The next morning the sole topic of conversation in St. Petersburg was  the fire at the Red House. Four half-consumed corpses were dug out from  beneath the ruins, and as three of the general's slaves were missing, he  had no doubt that the unrecognisable bodies were those of Ivan, Daniel,  and Alexis: as for the fourth, it was certainly that of Gregory.    The cause of the fire remained a secret from everyone: the house was  solitary, and the snowstorm so violent that nobody had met the two women  on the deserted road. Vaninka was sure of her maid. Her secret then had  perished with Ivan. But now remorse took the place of fear: the young  girl who was so pitiless and inflexible in the execution of the deed  quailed at its remembrance. It seemed to her that by revealing the  secret of her crime to a priest, she would be relieved of her terrible  burden. She therefore sought a confessor renowned for his lofty charity,  and, under the seal of confession, told him all. The priest was  horrified by the story. Divine mercy is boundless, but human forgiveness  has its limits. He refused Vaninka the absolution she asked. This  refusal was terrible: it would banish Vaninka from the Holy Table; this  banishment would be noticed, and could not fail to be attributed to some  unheard-of and secret crime. Vaninka fell at the feet of the priest, and  in the name of her father, who would be disgraced by her shame, begged  him to mitigate the rigour of this sentence.    The confessor reflected deeply, then thought he had found a way to  obviate such consequences. It was that Vaninka should approach the Holy  Table with the other young girls; the priest would stop before her as  before all the others, but only say to her, \"Pray and weep\"; the  congregation, deceived by this, would think that she had received the  Sacrament like her companions. This was all that Vaninka could obtain.    This confession took place about seven o'clock in the evening, and the  solitude of the church, added to the darkness of night, had given it a  still more awful character. The confessor returned home, pale and  trembling. His wife Elizabeth was waiting for him alone. She had just  put her little daughter Arina, who was eight years old, to bed in an  adjoining room. When she saw her husband, she uttered a cry of terror,  so changed and haggard was his appearance. The confessor tried to  reassure her, but his trembling voice only increased her alarm. She  asked the cause of his agitation; the confessor refused to tell her.  Elizabeth had heard the evening before that her mother was ill; she  thought that her husband had received some bad news. The day was Monday,  which is considered an unlucky day among the Russians, and, going out  that day, Elizabeth had met a man in mourning; these omens were too  numerous and too strong not to portend misfortune.    Elizabeth burst into tears, and cried out, \"My mother is dead!\"    The priest in vain tried to reassure her by telling her that his  agitation was not due to that. The poor woman, dominated by one idea,  made no response to his protestations but this everlasting cry, \"My  mother is dead!\"    Then, to bring her to reason, the confessor told her that his emotion  was due to the avowal of a crime which he had just heard in the  confessional. But Elizabeth shook her head: it was a trick, she said, to  hide from her the sorrow which had fallen upon her. Her agony, instead  of calming, became more violent; her tears ceased to flow, and were  followed by hysterics. The priest then made her swear to keep the  secret, and the sanctity of the confession was betrayed.    Little Arina had awakened at Elizabeth's cries, and being disturbed and  at the same time curious as to what her parents were doing, she got up,  went to listen at the door, and heard all.    The day for the Communion came; the church of St. Simeon was crowded.  Vaninka came to kneel at the railing of the choir. Behind her was her  father and his aides-de-camp, and behind them their servants.    Arina was also in the church with her mother. The inquisitive child  wished to see Vaninka, whose name she had heard pronounced that terrible  night, when her father had failed in the first and most sacred of the  duties imposed on a priest. While her mother was praying, she left her  chair and glided among the worshippers, nearly as far as the railing.    But when she had arrived there, she was stopped by the group of the  general's servants. But Arina had not come so far to be, stopped so  easily: she tried to push between them, but they opposed her; she  persisted, and one of them pushed her roughly back. The child fell,  struck her head against a seat, and got up bleeding and crying, \"You are  very proud for a slave. Is it because you belong to the great lady who  burnt the Red House?\"    These words, uttered in a loud voice, in the midst of the silence which  preceded, the sacred ceremony, were heard by everyone. They were  answered by a shriek. Vaninka had fainted. The next day the general, at  the feet of Paul, recounted to him, as his sovereign and judge, the  whole terrible story, which Vaninka, crushed by her long struggle, had  at last revealed to him, at night, after the scene in the church.    The emperor remained for a moment in thought at the end of this strange  confession; then, getting up from the chair where he had been sitting  while the miserable father told his story, he went to a bureau, and  wrote on a sheet of paper the following sentence:    \"The priest having violated what should have been inviolable, the  secrets of the confessional, is exiled to Siberia and deprived of his  priestly office. His wife will follow him: she is to be blamed for not  having respected his character as a minister of the altar. The little  girl will not leave her parents.    \"Annouschka, the attendant, will also go to Siberia for not having made  known to her master his daughter's conduct.    \"I preserve all my esteem for the general, and I mourn with him for the  deadly blow which has struck him.    \"As for Vaninka, I know of no punishment which can be inflicted upon  her. I only see in her the daughter of a brave soldier, whose whole life  has been devoted to the service of his country. Besides, the  extraordinary way in which the crime was discovered, seems to place the  culprit beyond the limits of my severity. I leave her punishment in her  own hands. If I understand her character, if any feeling of dignity  remains to her, her heart and her remorse will show her the path she  ought to follow.\"    Paul handed the paper open to the general, ordering him"]]]
