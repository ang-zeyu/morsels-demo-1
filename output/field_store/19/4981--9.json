The younger men who  had been included in the levy were quite satisfied with the  arrangement. The spirit of the West Saxons was still high, and those  without wives and families who would suffer by their absence or be  ruined by their death were eager to continue the contest. The proposal  that they should be paid as when at work was considered perfectly  satisfactory.    The men of Sherborne had under their young leader gained great credit  by their steadiness and valour in the battles four years before, and  they looked forward to fresh victories over the invader. The result was  that ninety young men assembled for service. Edmund had sent off a  messenger to the king saying that the people were utterly weary of war  and refused to take up arms, but that he was gathering a band of young  men with whom he would ere long join him; but he prayed for a short  delay in order that he might get them into a condition to be useful on  the day of battle.    After consultation with Egbert, Edmund drew up a series of orders  somewhat resembling those of modern drill. King Alfred had once, in  speaking to him, described the manner in which the Thebans, a people of  Northern Greece, had fought, placing their troops in the form of a  wedge. The formation he now taught his men. From morning to night they  were practised at rallying from pursuit or flight, or changing from a  line into the form of a wedge. Each man had his appointed place both in  the line and wedge. Those who formed the outside line of this formation  were armed with large shields which covered them from chin to foot, and  with short spears; those in the inner lines carried no shields, but  bore spears of increasing length, so that four lines of spears  projected from the wedge to nearly the same distance. Inside the four  lines were twenty men armed with shields, bows, and arrows. The sides  of the wedge were of equal length, so that they could march either way.    Egbert's place was at the apex of the wedge intended generally for  attack. He carried no spear, nor did those at the other corners, as  they would be covered by those beside and behind them; he was armed  with a huge battle-axe. The other leaders were also chosen for great  personal strength. Edmund's place was on horseback in the middle of the  wedge, whence he could overlook the whole and direct their movements.    In three weeks the men could perform their simple movements to  perfection, and at a sound from Edmund's horn would run in as when  scattered in pursuit or flight, or could form from line into the wedge,  without the least confusion, every man occupying his assigned place.    The men were delighted with their new exercises, and felt confident  that the weight of the solid mass thickly bristling with spears would  break through the Danish line without difficulty, or could draw off  from the field in perfect order and safety in case of a defeat, however  numerous their foes. The two front lines were to thrust with their  pikes, the others keeping their long spears immovable to form a solid  hedge. Each man carried a short heavy sword to use in case, by any  fatality, the wedge should get broken up.    When assured that his band were perfect in their new exercise Edmund  marched and joined the king. He found on his arrival that the summons  to arms had been everywhere disregarded. Many men had indeed come in,  but these were in no way sufficient to form a force which would enable  him to take the field against the Danes.    Edmund therefore solicited and obtained permission to march with his  band to endeavour to check the plundering bands of Danes, who were  already committing devastations throughout the country.    \"Be not rash, Edmund,\" the monarch said, \"you have but a handful of  men, and I should grieve indeed did aught of harm befall you. If you  can fall upon small parties of plunderers and destroy them you will do  good service, not only by compelling them to keep together but by  raising the spirits of the Saxons; but avoid conflict with parties  likely to defeat you.\"    \"You shall hear of us soon, I promise you,\" Edmund replied, \"and I  trust that the news will be good.\"    The little party set out towards the border, and before long met  numbers of fugitives, weeping women carrying children, old men and  boys, making their way from the neighbourhood of the Danes. The men had  for the most part driven their herds into the woods, where they were  prepared to defend them as best they could against roving parties. They  learned that Haffa, a Danish jarl, with about 600 followers, was  plundering and ravaging the country about twelve miles away. The force  was a formidable one, but after consultation with Egbert, Edmund  determined to advance, deeming that he might find the Danes scattered  and cut off some of their parties.    As they neared the country of which the Danes were in possession the  smoke of burning villages and homesteads was seen rising heavily in the  air. Edmund halted for the night in a wood about a mile distant from a  blazing farm, and the band lay down for some hours.    Before daybreak three or four of the swiftest-footed of the men were  sent out to reconnoitre. They learned, from badly wounded men whom they  found lying near the burning farms, that the Danes had been plundering  in parties of twenty or thirty, but that the main body under Haffa lay  five miles away at the village of Bristowe.    A consultation was held, and it was agreed that the party should remain  hidden in the wood during the day, and that upon the following night  they should fall upon the Danes, trusting to the surprise to inflict  much damage upon them, and to be able to draw off before the enemy  could recover sufficiently to rally and attack them.    Accordingly about nine o'clock in the evening they started, and  marching rapidly approached Bristowe an hour and a half later. They  could see great fires blazing, and round them the Danes were carousing  after their forays of the day. Great numbers of cattle were penned up  near the village.    Edmund and Egbert having halted their men stole forward until close to  the village in order to learn the nature of the ground and the position  of the Danes. Upon their return they waited until the fires burned low  and the sound of shouting and singing decreased. It was useless to wait  longer, for they knew that many of the Danes would, according to their  custom, keep up their revelry all night. Crawling along the ground the  band made for the great pen where were herded the cattle which the  Danes had driven in from the surrounding country, and over which  several guards had been placed. Before starting Egbert assigned to each  man the special duties which he was to fulfil.    The Saxons crept up quite close to the Danish guards unobserved. To  each of these three or four bowmen had been told off, and they, on  nearing the sentries lay prone on the ground with bows bent and arrows  fixed until a whistle from Edmund gave the signal. Then the arrows were  loosed, and the distance being so short the Danish sentries were all  slain. Then a party of men removed the side of the pen facing the  village; the rest mingled with the cattle, and soon with the points of  their spears goaded them into flight. In a mass the herd thundered down  upon the village, the Saxons keeping closely behind them and adding to  their terror by goading the hindermost.    The Danes, astonished at the sudden thunder of hoofs bearing down upon  them, leaped to their feet and endeavoured to turn the course of the  herd, which they deemed to have accidentally broken loose, by loud  shouts and by rattling their swords against their shields. The oxen,  however, were too terrified by those in their rear to check their  course, and charged impetuously down upon the Danes.    Numbers of these were hurled to the ground and trampled under foot, and  the wildest confusion reigned in the camp. This was increased when, as  the herds swept along, a number of active men with spear and sword fell  suddenly upon them. Scores were cut down or run through before they  could prepare for defence, or recover from their surprise at the novel  method of attack.    At last, as the thunder of the herd died away in the distance, and they  became aware of the comparative fewness of their foes, they began to  rally and make head against their assailants. No sooner was this the  case than the note of a horn was heard, and as if by magic their  assailants instantly darted away into the night, leaving the  superstitious Danes in some doubt whether the whole attack upon them  had not been of a supernatural nature.    Long before they recovered themselves, and were ready for pursuit, the  Saxons were far away, no less than 200 of the Danes having been slain  or trampled to death, while of Edmund's band not one had received so  much as a wound.    The Saxons regained the wood in the highest state of exultation at  their success, and more confident than before in themselves and their  leader.    \"I am convinced,\" Edmund said, \"that this is the true way to fight the  Danes, to harry and attack them by night assaults until they dare not  break up into parties, and become so worn out by constant alarms that  they will be glad to leave a country where plunder and booty are only  to be earned at so great a cost.\"    Knowing that Haffa's band would for some time be thoroughly on the  alert Edmund moved his party to another portion of the country, where  he inflicted a blow, almost as heavy as he had dealt Haffa, upon  Sigbert, another of the Danish jarls. Three or four more very  successful night attacks were made, and then the Danes, by this time  thoroughly alarmed, obtained from some Saxon country people whom they  took prisoners news as to the strength of Edmund's band.    Furious at the heavy losses which had been inflicted upon them by so  small a number, they determined to unite"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36764"],[0,"In the Track of the Bookworm (#12)"],[1,"erest, simply because it is the  fashion or the books are intrinsically beautiful. Many a man has a fine  collection on Angling, for example, who hardly knows how to put a worm on  a hook, much less attach a fly. I fear I am one of these hypocritical  creatures, for this is      HOW I GO A-FISHING.      Tis sweet to sit in shady nook,    Or wade in rapid crystal brook,    Impervious in rubber boots,    And wary of the slippery roots,    To snare the swift evasive trout    Or eke the sauntering horn-pout;    Or in the cold Canadian river    To see the glorious salmon quiver,    And them with tempting hook inveigle,    Fit viand for a table regal;    Or after an exciting bout    To snatch the pike with sharpened snout;    Or with some patient ass to row    To troll for bass with motion slow.    Oh! joy supreme when they appear    Splashing above the water clear,    And drawn reluctantly to land    Lie gasping on the yellow sand!    But sweeter far to read the books    That treat of flies and worms and hooks,    From Pickering's monumental page,    (Late rivalled by the rare Dean Sage),    And Major's elder issues neat,    To Burnand's funny \"Incompleat.\"    I love their figures quaint and queer,    Which on the inviting page appear,    From those of good Dame Juliana,    Who lifts a fish and cries hosanna,    To those of Stothard, graceful Quaker,    Of fishy art supremest maker,    Whose fisherman, so dry and neat,    Would never soil a parlor seat.    I love them all, the books on angling,    And far from cares and business jangling,    Ensconced in cosy chimney-corner,    Like the traditional Jack Horner,    I read from Walton down to Lang,    And hum that song the Milkmaid sang.    I get not tired nor wet nor cross,    Nor suffer monetary loss--    If fish are shy and will not bite,    And shun the snare laid in their sight--    In order home at night to bring    A fraudulent, deceitful string,    And thus escape the merry jeers    Of heartless piscatory peers;    Nor have to listen to the lying    Of fishermen while fish are frying,    Who boast of draughts miraculous    Which prove too large a draught on us.    I spare the rod, and rods don't break;    Nor fish in sight the hook forsake;    My lines ne'er snap like corset laces;    My lines are fallen in pleasant places.    And so in sage experience ripe,    My fishery is but a type.          XV.    POVERTY AS A MEANS OF ENJOYMENT IN COLLECTING.      Poor collectors are not only not at a disadvantage in enjoyment, but they  have a positive advantage over affluent rivals. If I were rich, probably I  should not throw my money away just to experience this superiority, but it  nevertheless exists. I do not envy, but I commiserate my brother collector  who has plenty of money. He who only has to draw his check to obtain his  desire fails to reach the keenest bliss of the pursuit. If diamonds were  as common as cobble stones there would be no delight in picking them up.    To constitute a bibliomaniac in the true sense, the love of books must  combine with a certain limitation of means for the gratification of the  appetite. The consciousness of some extravagance must be always present  in his mind; there must be a sense of sacrifice in the attainment; in a  rich man the disease cannot exist; he cannot enter the kingdom of the  Bibliomaniac's heaven. There is the same difference of sensation between  the acquirement of books by a wealthy man and by him of slender purse,  that there is between the taking of fish in a net and the successful  result of a long angling pursuit after one especially fat and evasive  trout. When a prince kills his preserved game, with keepers to raise it  for him and to hand him guns ready loaded, so that all he has to do is to  squint and pull the trigger, this is not hunting; it is mere vulgar  butchery. What knows he of the joys of the tramper in the forest, who  stalks the deer, or scares up smaller game, singly, and has to work hard  for his bag? We read in Dibdin's sumptuous pages of the celebrated contest  between the Duke of Devonshire and the Marquis of Blandford for the  possession of the Valdarfar Decameron; we read with admiration, but we  also read of the immortal battle of Elia with the little squab-keeper of  the old book-stall in Ninety-four alley, over the ownership of a ragged  duodecimo for a sixpence; we read with affection. So we read Leigh  Hunt's confession that when he \"cut open a new catalogue of old books, and  put crosses against dozens of volumes in the list, out of the pure  imagination of buying them, the possibility being out of the question.\"  Poverty hath her victories no less renowned than wealth. To haunt the  book-stores, there to see a long-desired work in luxurious and tempting  style, reluctantly to abandon it for the present on account of the price;  to go home and dream about it, to wonder, for a year, and perchance  longer, whether it will ever again greet your eyes; to conjecture what act  of desperation you might in heat of passion commit toward some more  affluent man in whose possession you should thereafter find it; to see it  turn up again in another book-shop, its charms slightly faded, but yet  mellowed by age, like those of your first love, met in later life--with  this difference, however, that whereas you crave those of the book more  than ever, you are generally quite satisfied with yourself for not having,  through the greenness of youth, yielded untimely to those of the lady; to  ask with assumed indifference the price, and learn with ill-dissembled joy  that it is now within your means; to say you'll take it; to place it  beneath your arm, and pay for it (or more generally order it \"charged\");  to go forth from that room with feelings akin to those of Ulysses when he  brought away the Palladium from Troy; to keep a watchful eye on the parcel  in the railway coach on your way home, or to gloat over the treasures of  its pages, and wonder if the other passengers have any suspicion of your  good fortune; and finally to place the volume on your shelf, and  thenceforth to call it your own--this is indeed a pleasure denied to the  affluent, so keen as to be akin to pain, and only marred by the palling  which always follows possession and the presentation of your book-seller's  account three months afterwards.          XVI.    THE ARRANGEMENT OF BOOKS.      There was a time when I loved to see my books arranged with a view to  uniformity of height and harmony of color without respect to subjects.  That time I regard as my vealy period. That was the time when we admired  \"Somnambula,\" and when the housewife used to have all the pictures hung on  the same level, and to buy vases in pairs exactly alike and put them on  either side of the parlor clock, which was generally surmounted by a  prancing Saracen or a weaving Penelope. Granting that a collection is not  extensive enough to demand a strict arrangement by subjects, I like to see  a little artistic confusion--high and low together here and there, like a  democratic community; now and then some giants laid down on their sides to  rest; the shelves not uniformly filled out as if the owner never expected  to buy any more, and alongside a dainty Angler a book in red or blue cloth  with a white label--just as childred in velvet and furs sit next a  newsboy, or a little girl in calico with a pigtail at Sunday School, or as  beggars and princes kneel side by side on the cathedral pavement. It is  good to have these \"swell\" books rub up against the commoners, which  though not so elegant are frequently a great deal brighter. At a country  funeral I once heard the undertaker say to the bearers, \"size yourselves  off.\" There is no necessity or artistic gain in such a ceremony in a  library, and a departure from stiff uniformity is quite agreeable. Then  I do not care to have the book cases all of the same height, nor even of  the same kind of wood, nor to have them all \"dwarfs,\" with bric-a-brac on  the top. I would rather have more books on top. In short, it is pleasant  to have the collection remind one in a way of Topsy--not that it was  \"born,\" but \"growed\" and is expected to grow more. There is a modern  notion of considering a library as a room rather than as a collection of  books, and of making the front drawing-room the library, which is  heretical in the eyes of a true Book-Worm. This is probably an invention  of the women of the house to prevent any additions to the books without  their knowledge, and to discourage book-buying. We have surrendered too  much to our wives in this; they demand book cases as furniture and to  serve as shelves, without any regard to the interior contents or whether  there are any, except for the color of the bindings and the regularity of  the rows. All of us have thus seen \"libraries\" without books worthy the  name, and book-cases sometimes with exquisite silk curtains, carefully and  closely drawn, arousing the suspicion that there were no books behind  them. My ideal library is a room given up to books, all by itself, at  the top or in the rear of the house, where \"company\" cannot break through  and say to me, \"I know you are a great man to buy books--have you seen  that beautiful limited holiday edition of Ben Hur, with illustrations?\"          XVII.    ENEMIES OF BOOKS.      Mr. Blades regards as \"Enemies of Books\" fire, water, gas, heat, dust and  neglect, ignorance and bigotry, the worm, beetles, bugs and rats,  book-binders, collectors, servants and children. He does not include  women, borrowers, or thieves. Perhaps he considers them rather as enemies  of the book-owners. The worm is not always to be considered an enemy to  authors, although he may be to books. James Payn, in speaking of the  recent discovery, in the British Museum, of a copy on papyrus of the  humorous poems of the obscure Greek poet, Herodles, says: \"The humorous  poems of Herodles possess, however, the immense advantage of"]]]
