The virtue of Madame d'Urban was as much cried up at Avignon as the  ill-behaviour of the chevalier had been reprobated in Paris. A  reputation equal to his own, but so opposite in kind, could not fail to  be very offensive to him, therefore he determined immediately upon  arriving to play one against the other.    Nothing was easier than the attempt. M. d'Urban, sure of his wife's  virtue, allowed her entire liberty; the chevalier saw her wherever he  chose to see her, and every time he saw her found means to express a  growing passion. Whether because the hour had come for Madame d'Urban,  or whether because she was dazzled by the splendour of the chevalier's  belonging to a princely house, her virtue, hitherto so fierce, melted  like snow in the May sunshine; and the chevalier, luckier than the poor  page, took the husband's place without any attempt on Madame d'Urban's  part to cry for help.    As all the chevalier desired was public triumph, he took care to make  the whole town acquainted at once with his success; then, as some  infidels of the neighbourhood still doubted, the chevalier ordered one  of his servants to wait for him at the marquise's door with a lantern  and a bell. At one in the morning, the chevalier came out, and the  servant walked before him, ringing the bell. At this unaccustomed sound,  a great number of townspeople, who had been quietly asleep, awoke, and,  curious to see what was happening, opened their windows. They beheld the  chevalier, walking gravely behind his servant, who continued to light  his master's way and to ring along the course of the street that lay  between Madame d'Urban's house and his own. As he had made no mystery to  anyone of his love affair, nobody took the trouble even to ask him  whence he came. However, as there might possibly be persons still  unconvinced, he repeated this same jest, for his own satisfaction, three  nights running; so that by the morning of the fourth day nobody had any  doubts left.    As generally happens in such cases, M. d'Urban did not know a word of  what was going on until the moment when his friends warned him that he  was the talk of the town. Then he forbade his wife to see her lover  again. The prohibition produced the usual results: on the morrow, as,  soon as M. d'Urban had gone out, the marquise sent for the chevalier to  inform him of the catastrophe in which they were both involved; but she  found him far better prepared than herself for such blows, and he tried  to prove to her, by reproaches for her imprudent conduct, that all this  was her fault; so that at last the poor woman, convinced that it was she  who had brought these woes upon them, burst into tears. Meanwhile, M.  d'Urban, who, being jealous for the first time, was the more seriously  so, having learned that the chevalier was with his wife, shut the doors,  and posted himself in the ante-chamber with his servants, in order to  seize him as he came out. But the chevalier, who had ceased to trouble  himself about Madame d'Urban's tears, heard all the preparations, and,  suspecting some ambush, opened the window, and, although it was one  o'clock in the afternoon and the place was full of people, jumped out of  the window into the street, and did not hurt himself at all, though the  height was twenty feet, but walked quietly home at a moderate pace.    The same evening, the chevalier, intending to relate his new adventure  in all its details, invited some of his friends to sup with him at the  pastrycook Lecoq's. This man, who was a brother of the famous Lecoq of  the rue Montorgueil, was the cleverest eating-house-keeper in Avignon;  his own unusual corpulence commended his cookery, and, when he stood at  the door, constituted an advertisement for his restaurant. The good man,  knowing with what delicate appetites he had to deal, did his very best  that evening, and that nothing might be wanting, waited upon his guests  himself. They spent the night drinking, and towards morning the  chevalier and his companions, being then drunk, espied their host  standing respectfully at the door, his face wreathed in smiles. The  chevalier called him nearer, poured him out a glass of wine and made him  drink with them; then, as the poor wretch, confused at such an honour,  was thanking him with many bows, he said:--    \"Pardieu, you are too fat for Lecoq, and I must make you a capon.\"    This strange proposition was received as men would receive it who were  drunk and accustomed by their position to impunity. The unfortunate  pastry-cook was seized, bound down upon the table, and died under their  treatment. The vice-legate being informed of the murder by one of the  waiters, who had run in on hearing his master's shrieks, and had found  him, covered with blood, in the hands of his butchers, was at first  inclined to arrest the chevalier and bring him conspicuously to  punishment. But he was restrained by his regard for the Cardinal de  Bouillon, the chevalier's uncle, and contented himself with warning the  culprit that unless he left the town instantly he would be put into the  hands of the authorities. The chevalier, who was beginning to have had  enough of Avignon, did not wait to be told twice, ordered the wheels of  his chaise to be greased and horses to be brought. In the interval  before they were ready the fancy took him to go and see Madame d'Urban  again.    As the house of the marquise was the very last at which, after the  manner of his leaving it the day before, the chevalier was expected at  such an hour, he got in with the greatest ease, and, meeting a  lady's-maid, who was in his interests, was taken to the room where the  marquise was. She, who had not reckoned upon seeing the chevalier again,  received him with all the raptures of which a woman in love is capable,  especially when her love is a forbidden one. But the chevalier soon put  an end to them by announcing that his visit was a visit of farewell, and  by telling her the reason that obliged him to leave her. The marquise  was like the woman who pitied the fatigue of the poor horses that tore  Damien limb from limb; all her commiseration was for the chevalier, who  on account of such a trifle was being forced to leave Avignon. At last  the farewell had to be uttered, and as the chevalier, not knowing what  to say at the fatal moment, complained that he had no memento of her,  the marquise took down the frame that contained a portrait of herself  corresponding with one of her husband, and tearing out the canvas,  rolled, it up and gave it to the chevalier. The latter, so far from  being touched by this token of love, laid it down, as he went away, upon  a piece of furniture, where the marquise found it half an hour later.  She imagined that his mind being so full of the original, he had  forgotten the copy, and representing to herself the sorrow which the  discovery of this forgetfulness would cause him, she sent for a servant,  gave him the picture, and ordered him to take horse and ride after the  chevalier's chaise. The man took a post-horse, and, making great speed,  perceived the fugitive in the distance just as the latter had finished  changing horses. He made violent signs and shouted loudly, in order to  stop the postillion. But the postillion having told his fare that he saw  a man coming on at full speed, the chevalier supposed himself to be  pursued, and bade him go on as fast as possible. This order was so well  obeyed that the unfortunate servant only came up with the chaise a  league and a half farther on; having stopped the postillion, he got off  his horse, and very respectfully presented to the chevalier the picture  which he had been bidden to bring him. But the chevalier, having  recovered from his first alarm, bade him go about his business, and take  back the portrait--which was of no use to him--to the sender. The  servant, however, like a faithful messenger, declared that his orders  were positive, and that he should not dare go back to Madame d'Urban  without fulfilling them. The chevalier, seeing that he could not conquer  the man's determination, sent his postillion to a farrier, whose house  lay on the road, for a hammer and four nails, and with his own hands  nailed the portrait to the back of his chaise; then he stepped in again,  bade the postillion whip up his horses, and drove away, leaving Madame  d'Urban's messenger greatly astonished at the manner in which the  chevalier had used his mistress's portrait.    At the next stage, the postillion, who was going back, asked for his  money, and the chevalier answered that he had none. The postillion  persisted; then the chevalier got out of his chaise, unfastened Madame  d'Urban's portrait, and told him that he need only put it up for sale in  Avignon and declare how it had come into his possession, in order to  receive twenty times the price of his stage; the postillion, seeing that  nothing else was to be got out of the chevalier, accepted the pledge,  and, following his instructions precisely, exhibited it next morning at  the door of a dealer in the town, together with an exact statement of  the story. The picture was bought back the same day for twenty-five  Louis.    As may be supposed, the adventure was much talked of throughout the  town. Next day, Madame d'Urban disappeared, no one knew whither, at the  very time when the relatives of the marquis were met together and had  decided to ask the king for a 'lettre-de-cachet'. One of the gentlemen  present was entrusted with the duty of taking the necessary steps; but  whether because he was not active enough, or whether because he was in  Madame d'Urban's interests, nothing further was heard in Avignon of any  consequences ensuing from such steps. In the meantime, Madame d'Urban,  who had gone to the house of an aunt, opened negotiations with her  husband that were entirely "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2759"],[0,"The Man in the Iron Mask (#12)"],[1,"ress, similar to  those of the Epicureans?\" answered Percerin. And while saying this, in  an absent manner, the worthy tailor endeavored to recapture his piece of  brocade.    \"An Epicurean's dress?\" asked D'Artagnan, in a tone of inquiry.    \"I see,\" said Aramis, with a most engaging smile, \"it is written that  our dear D'Artagnan shall know all our secrets this evening. Yes,  friend, you have surely heard speak of M. Fouquet's Epicureans, have you  not?\"    \"Undoubtedly. Is it not a kind of poetical society, of which La  Fontaine, Loret, Pelisson, and Moliere are members, and which holds its  sittings at Saint-Mande?\"    \"Exactly so. Well, we are going to put our poets in uniform, and enroll  them in a regiment for the king.\"    \"Oh, very well, I understand; a surprise M. Fouquet is getting up for  the king. Be at ease; if that is the secret about M. Lebrun, I will not  mention it.\"    \"Always agreeable, my friend. No, Monsieur Lebrun has nothing to do with  this part of it; the secret which concerns him is far more important  than the other.\"    \"Then, if it is so important as all that, I prefer not to know it,\" said  D'Artagnan, making a show of departure.    \"Come in, M. Lebrun, come in,\" said Aramis, opening a side-door with his  right hand, and holding back D'Artagnan with his left.    \"I'faith, I too, am quite in the dark,\" quoth Percerin.    Aramis took an \"opportunity,\" as is said in theatrical matters.    \"My dear M. de Percerin,\" Aramis continued, \"you are making five dresses  for the king, are you not? One in brocade; one in hunting-cloth; one in  velvet; one in satin; and one in Florentine stuffs.\"    \"Yes; but how--do you know all that, monseigneur?\" said Percerin,  astounded.    \"It is all very simple, my dear monsieur; there will be a hunt, a  banquet, concert, promenade and reception; these five kinds of dress are  required by etiquette.\"    \"You know everything, monseigneur!\"    \"And a thing or two in addition,\" muttered D'Artagnan.    \"But,\" cried the tailor, in triumph, \"what you do not know,  monseigneur--prince of the church though you are--what nobody will  know--what only the king, Mademoiselle de la Valliere, and myself do  know, is the color of the materials and nature of the ornaments, and the  cut, the _ensemble_, the finish of it all!\"    \"Well,\" said Aramis, \"that is precisely what I have come to ask you,  dear Percerin.\"    \"Ah, bah!\" exclaimed the tailor, terrified, though Aramis had pronounced  these words in his softest and most honeyed tones. The request appeared,  on reflection, so exaggerated, so ridiculous, so monstrous to M.  Percerin that first he laughed to himself, then aloud, and finished  with a shout. D'Artagnan followed his example, not because he found the  matter so \"very funny,\" but in order not to allow Aramis to cool.    \"At the outset, I appear to be hazarding an absurd question, do I not?\"  said Aramis. \"But D'Artagnan, who is incarnate wisdom itself, will tell  you that I could not do otherwise than ask you this.\"    \"Let us see,\" said the attentive musketeer; perceiving with his  wonderful instinct that they had only been skirmishing till now, and  that the hour of battle was approaching.    \"Let us see,\" said Percerin, incredulously.    \"Why, now,\" continued Aramis, \"does M. Fouquet give the king a  _fete?_--Is it not to please him?\"    \"Assuredly,\" said Percerin. D'Artagnan nodded assent.    \"By delicate attentions? by some happy device? by a succession of  surprises, like that of which we were talking?--the enrolment of our  Epicureans.\"    \"Admirable.\"    \"Well, then; this is the surprise we intend. M. Lebrun here is a man who  draws most excellently.\"    \"Yes,\" said Percerin; \"I have seen his pictures, and observed that his  dresses were highly elaborated. That is why I at once agreed to make him  a costume--whether to agree with those of the Epicureans, or an original  one.\"    \"My dear monsieur, we accept your offer, and shall presently avail  ourselves of it; but just now, M. Lebrun is not in want of the dresses  you will make for himself, but of those you are making for the king.\"    Percerin made a bound backwards, which D'Artagnan--calmest and most  appreciative of men, did not consider overdone, so many strange and  startling aspects wore the proposal which Aramis had just hazarded. \"The  king's dresses! Give the king's dresses to any mortal whatever! Oh!  for once, monseigneur, your grace is mad!\" cried the poor tailor in  extremity.    \"Help me now, D'Artagnan,\" said Aramis, more and more calm and smiling.  \"Help me now to persuade monsieur, for _you_ understand; do you not?\"    \"Eh! eh!--not exactly, I declare.\"    \"What! you do not understand that M. Fouquet wishes to afford the king  the surprise of finding his portrait on his arrival at Vaux; and that  the portrait, which be a striking resemblance, ought to be dressed  exactly as the king will be on the day it is shown?\"    \"Oh! yes, yes,\" said the musketeer, nearly convinced, so plausible was  this reasoning. \"Yes, my dear Aramis, you are right; it is a happy idea.  I will wager it is one of your own, Aramis.\"    \"Well, I don't know,\" replied the bishop; \"either mine or M. Fouquet's.\"  Then scanning Percerin, after noticing D'Artagnan's hesitation, \"Well,  Monsieur Percerin,\" he asked, \"what do you say to this?\"    \"I say, that--\"    \"That you are, doubtless, free to refuse. I know well--and I by no means  count upon compelling you, my dear monsieur. I will say more, I even  understand all the delicacy you feel in taking up with M. Fouquet's  idea; you dread appearing to flatter the king. A noble spirit, M.  Percerin, a noble spirit!\" The tailor stammered. \"It would, indeed, be a  very pretty compliment to pay the young prince,\" continued Aramis; \"but  as the surintendant told me, 'if Percerin refuse, tell him that it  will not at all lower him in my opinion, and I shall always esteem him,  only--'\"    \"'Only?'\" repeated Percerin, rather troubled.    \"'Only,'\" continued Aramis, \"'I shall be compelled to say to the  king,'--you understand, my dear Monsieur Percerin, that these are M.  Fouquet's words,--'I shall be constrained to say to the king, \"Sire, I  had intended to present your majesty with your portrait, but owing to a  feeling of delicacy, slightly exaggerated perhaps, although creditable,  M. Percerin opposed the project.\"'\"    \"Opposed!\" cried the tailor, terrified at the responsibility which would  weigh upon him; \"I to oppose the desire, the will of M. Fouquet when he  is seeking to please the king! Oh, what a hateful word you have uttered,  monseigneur. Oppose! Oh, 'tis not I who said it, Heaven have mercy on  me. I call the captain of the musketeers to witness it! Is it not true,  Monsieur d'Artagnan, that I have opposed nothing?\"    D'Artagnan made a sign indicating that he wished to remain neutral. He  felt that there was an intrigue at the bottom of it, whether comedy or  tragedy; he was at his wit's end at not being able to fathom it, but in  the meanwhile wished to keep clear.    But already Percerin, goaded by the idea that the king was to be told he  stood in the way of a pleasant surprise, had offered Lebrun a chair, and  proceeded to bring from a wardrobe four magnificent dresses, the  fifth being still in the workmen's hands; and these masterpieces he  successively fitted upon four lay figures, which, imported into France  in the time of Concini, had been given to Percerin II. by Marshal  d'Onore, after the discomfiture of the Italian tailors ruined in their  competition. The painter set to work to draw and then to paint the  dresses. But Aramis, who was closely watching all the phases of his  toil, suddenly stopped him.    \"I think you have not quite got it, my dear Lebrun,\" he said; \"your  colors will deceive you, and on canvas we shall lack that exact  resemblance which is absolutely requisite. Time is necessary for  attentively observing the finer shades.\"    \"Quite true,\" said Percerin, \"but time is wanting, and on that head, you  will agree with me, monseigneur, I can do nothing.\"    \"Then the affair will fail,\" said Aramis, quietly, \"and that because of  a want of precision in the colors.\"    Nevertheless Lebrun went on copying the materials and ornaments with  the closest fidelity--a process which Aramis watched with ill-concealed  impatience.    \"What in the world, now, is the meaning of this imbroglio?\" the  musketeer kept saying to himself.    \"That will never do,\" said Aramis: \"M. Lebrun, close your box, and roll  up your canvas.\"    \"But, monsieur,\" cried the vexed painter, \"the light is abominable  here.\"    \"An idea, M. Lebrun, an idea! If we had a pattern of the materials, for  example, and with time, and a better light--\"    \"Oh, then,\" cried Lebrun, \"I would answer for the effect.\"    \"Good!\" said D'Artagnan, \"this ought to be the knotty point of the whole  thing; they want a pattern of each of the materials. _Mordioux!_ Will  this Percerin give in now?\"    Percerin, beaten from his last retreat, and duped, moreover, by the  feigned good-nature of Aramis, cut out five patterns and handed them to  the bishop of Vannes.    \"I like this better. That is your opinion, is it not?\" said Aramis to  D'Artagnan.    \"My dear Aramis,\" said D'Artagnan, \"my opinion is that you are always  the same.\"    \"And, consequently, always your friend,\" said the bishop in a charming  tone.    \"Yes, yes,\" said D'Artagnan, aloud; then, in a low voice, \"If I am your  dupe, double Jesuit that you are, I will not be your accomplice; and  to prevent it, 'tis time I left this place.--Adieu, Aramis,\" he added  aloud, \"adieu; I am going to rejoin Porthos.\"    \"Then wait for me,\" said Aramis, pocketing the patterns, \"for I have  done, and shall be glad to say a parting word to our dear old friend.\"    Lebrun packed up his paints and brushes, Percerin put back the dresses  into the closet, Aramis put his hand on his pocket to assure himself the  patterns were secure,--and they"]]]
