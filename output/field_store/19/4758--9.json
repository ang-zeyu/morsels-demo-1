In the Umbrian school Pietro Perugino (1446-1524) was a notable painter;  he was important on account of his own work, and because he was the master  of the great Raphael. His pictures were simple and devout in their spirit,  and brilliant in color; in fact, he is considered as the founder of the  style which Raphael perfected. His works are in the principal galleries of  Europe, and he had many followers of whom we have not space to speak.    FRANCISCO FRANCIA (1450-1518) was the founder of the school of Bologna.  His true name was Francisco di Marco Raibolini, and he was a goldsmith of  repute before he was a painter. He was also master of the mint to the  Bentivoglio and to Pope Julius II. at Bologna. It is not possible to say  when he began to paint; but his earliest known work is dated 1490 or 1494,  and is in the Gallery of Bologna. His pictures resemble those of Perugino  and Raphael, and it is said that he died of sorrow because he felt himself  so inferior to the great painter of Urbino. Raphael sent his St. Cecilia  to Francia, and asked him to care for it and see it hung in its place; he  did so, but did not live long after this. It is well known that these two  masters were good friends and corresponded, but it is not certain that  they ever met. Francia's pictures are numerous; his portraits are  excellent. Many of his works are still in Bologna.    [Illustration: FIG. 34.--MADONNA. _By Perugino. In the Pitti Gallery,  Florence._]    We come now to one of the most celebrated masters of Italy, LEONARDO DA  VINCI (1452-1519), the head of the Lombard or Milanese school. He was not  the equal of the great masters, Michael Angelo, Raphael, and Titian; but  he stands between them and the painters who preceded him or those of his  own day.    In some respects, however, he was the most extraordinary man of his time.  His talents were many-sided; for he was not only a great artist, but also  a fine scholar in mathematics and mechanics; he wrote poetry and composed  music, and was with all this so attractive personally, and so brilliant in  his manner, that he was a favorite wherever he went. It is probable that  this versatility prevented his being very great in any one thing, while he  was remarkable in many things.    When still very young Leonardo showed his artistic talent. The paper upon  which he worked out his sums was frequently bordered with little pictures  which he drew while thinking on his lessons, and these sketches at last  attracted his father's attention, and he showed them to his friend Andrea  Verrocchio, an artist of Florence, who advised that the boy should become  a painter. Accordingly, in 1470, when eighteen years old, Leonardo was  placed under the care of Verrocchio, who was like a kind father to his  pupils: he was not only a painter, but also an architect and sculptor, a  musician and a geometer, and he especially excelled in making exquisite  cups of gold and silver, crucifixes and statuettes such as were in great  demand for the use of the priesthood in those days.    [Illustration: FIG. 35.--LEONARDO DA VINCI. _From a drawing in red chalk  by himself. In the Royal Library, Turin._]    Pietro Perugino was a fellow-pupil with Leonardo, and they two soon  surpassed their master in painting, and at last, when Verrocchio was  painting a picture for the monks of Vallambrosa, and desired Leonardo to  execute an angel in it, the work of his pupil was so much better than his  own that the old painter desired to throw his brush aside forever. The  picture is now in the Academy of Florence, and represents \"The Baptism  of Christ.\" With all his refinement and sweetness, Leonardo had a liking  for the horrible. It once happened that a countryman brought to his father  a circular piece of wood cut from a fig-tree, and desired to have it  painted for a shield; it was handed over to Leonardo, who collected in his  room a number of lizards, snakes, bats, hedgehogs, and other frightful  creatures, and from these painted an unknown monster having certain  characteristics of the horrid things he had about him. The hideous  creature was surrounded by fire, and was breathing out flames. When his  father saw it he ran away in a fright, and Leonardo was greatly pleased at  this. The countryman received an ordinary shield, and this _Rotello del  Fico_ (or shield of fig-tree wood) was sold to a merchant for one hundred  ducats, and again to the Duke of Milan for three times that sum. This  shield has now been lost for more than three centuries; but another  horror, the \"Medusa's Head,\" is in the Uffizi Gallery in Florence, and is  a head surrounded by interlacing serpents, the eyes being glassy and  deathlike and the mouth most revolting in expression.    While in Florence Leonardo accomplished much, but was at times diverted  from his painting by his love of science, sometimes making studies in  astronomy and again in natural history and botany; he also went much into  society, and lived extravagantly. He had the power to remember faces that  he had seen accidentally, and could make fine portraits from memory; he  was also accustomed to invite to his house people from the lower classes;  he would amuse them while he sketched their faces, making good portraits  at times, and again ridiculous caricatures. He even went so far, for the  sake of his art, as to accompany criminals to the place of execution, in  order to study their expressions.    After a time Leonardo wished to secure some fixed income, and wrote to the  Duke of Milan, Ludovico Sforza, called Il Moro, offering his services to  that prince. This resulted in his going to Milan, where he received a  generous salary, and became very popular with the Duke and all the court,  both as a painter and as a gentleman. The Duke governed as the regent for  his young nephew, and gathered about him talented men for the benefit of  the young prince. He also led a gay life, and his court was the scene of  constant festivities. Leonardo's varied talents were very useful to the  Duke; he could assist him in everything--by advice at his council, by  plans for adorning his city, by music and poetry in his leisure hours, and  by painting the portraits of his favorites. Some of these last are now  famous pictures--that of Lucrezia Crevelli is believed to be in the Louvre  at Paris, where it is called \"La Belle Ferroniere.\"    The Duke conferred a great honor on Leonardo by choosing him to be the  founder and director of an academy which he had long wished to establish.  It was called the \"Academia Leonardi Vinci,\" and had for its purpose the  bringing together of distinguished artists and men of letters. Leonardo  was appointed superintendent of all the fetes and entertainments given by  the court, and in this department he did some marvellous things. He also  superintended a great work in engineering which he brought to perfection,  to the wonder of all Italy: it was no less an undertaking than bringing  the waters of the Adda from Mortisana to Milan, a distance of nearly two  hundred miles. In spite of all these occupations the artist found time to  study anatomy and to write some valuable works. At length Il Moro became  the established duke, and at his brilliant court Leonardo led a most  agreeable life; but he was so occupied with many things that he painted  comparatively few pictures.    [Illustration: FIG. 36.--THE LAST SUPPER. _By Leonardo da Vinci._]    At length the Duke desired him to paint a picture of the Last Supper on  the wall of the refectory in the Convent of the Madonna delle Grazie. This  was his greatest work in Milan and a wonderful masterpiece. It was  commenced about 1496, and was finished in a very short time. We must now  judge of it from copies and engravings, for it has been so injured as to  give no satisfaction to one who sees it. Some good copies were made before  it was thus ruined, and numerous engravings make it familiar to all the  world. A copy in the Royal Academy, London, was made by one of Leonardo's  pupils, and is the size of the original. It is said that the prior of the  convent complained to the Duke of the length of time the artist was  spending upon this picture; when the Duke questioned the painter he said  that he was greatly troubled to find a face which pleased him for that of  Judas Iscariot; he added that he was willing to allow the prior to sit for  this figure and thus hasten the work; this answer pleased the Duke and  silenced the prior.    After a time misfortunes overtook the Duke, and Leonardo was reduced to  poverty; finally Il Moro was imprisoned; and in 1500 Leonardo returned to  Florence, where he was honorably received. He was not happy here, however,  for he was not the one important artist. He had been absent nineteen  years, and great changes had taken place; Michael Angelo and Raphael were  just becoming famous, and they with other artists welcomed Leonardo, for  his fame had reached them from Milan. However, he painted some fine  pictures at this time; among them were the \"Adoration of the Kings,\" now  in the Uffizi Gallery, and a portrait of Ginevra Benci, also in the same  gallery. This lady must have been very beautiful; Ghirlandajo introduced  her portrait into two of his frescoes.    But the most remarkable portrait was that known as Mona Lisa del Giocondo,  which is in the Louvre, and is called by some critics the finest work of  this master. The lady was the wife of Francesco del Giocondo, a lovely  woman, and some suppose that she was very dear to Leonardo. He worked upon  it for four years, and still thought it unfinished: the face has a deep,  thoughtful expression--the eyelids are a little weary, perhaps, and  through it all there is a suggestion of something not quite understood--a  mystery: the hands are graceful and of perfect form, and the rocky  background gives an unusual fascination to the whole"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24728"],[0,"Stories Of Georgia (#12)"],[1,"she had the French and the Spaniards  for neighbors, and she felt at home with neither race. She was bluntly,  emphatically, and unaffectedly American. To add to her troubles, a big  rain flooded the river, destroyed her crops, and surrounded her house.  This, with the French and Spaniards, was too much for her. She returned  to Georgia, but, finding her old home occupied by others, she settled in  Edgefield, S.C.    A Methodist society was formed in her neighborhood, and its influence  became so active that Aunt Nancy's conscience began to trouble her. She  listened to the preaching of the Word from a distance until she became  worried about her future state. She went to the meetinghouse, but found  the door closed against intruders. The deacon and members were holding  a class meeting. The closed door was no obstacle to Aunt Nancy. She cut  the fastening and walked in without ceremony. Once in, she found what  she wanted. She became an enthusiastic Methodist, and is said to have  fought Satan and sin as manfully as she fought the Tories and the  British.    When Governor George R. Gilmer of Georgia was in Congress, in 1828-29,  the members were very anxious to attract the notice of General Jackson,  who had been elected President. A proposal was made to fill the vacant  niches in the rotunda with paintings descriptive of the battle of New  Orleans and the general's other victories. Governor Gilmer offered as an  amendment a resolution to fill one of the niches with a painting of Aunt  Nancy Hart wading Broad River, her petticoats held up with one hand,  a musket in the other, and driving three Tories before her, to deliver  them up to Colonel Elijah Clarke.    Governor Gilmer's proposition was a more sensible one than he intended  it to be. Georgia has perpetuated Aunt Nancy's name by calling a county  after her; but the Republic owes something to her memory.          TWO SOLDIERS OF THE REVOLUTION.    The pen of the historian is not always as impartial as it should be. It  has its spites and prejudices; and it frequently happens that the men  who wield the pen with which history is written, have their whims,  their likes, and their dislikes. It is certain that two of the hardest  fighters in the War for Independence--two of the most distinguished  officers that Georgia gave to the cause--have had tardy justice done  to their valor. The names of these men are General James Jackson and  General Elijah Clarke. The independence and the individuality of these  men stand clearly out in all the records that we have of them, and it  is no doubt true that these qualities made them to some degree unpopular  with those who inspired the early chroniclers of the Revolution in the  South. Neither of these officers was capable of currying favor with his  superiors, or of doing injustice to the humblest of his comrades. They  were not seekers after the bubble reputation, but had their minds and  all their energies bent on liberating Georgia and her sister Colonies.    General James Jackson was born in the county of Devon, England. He  came to this country in 1772, landing at Savannah penniless and almost  friendless. He began the study of law; but when the Liberty Boys began  their movement for resisting British oppression, he placed his books  on their shelves, and gave himself entirely to the cause of the people.  When only nineteen years old, he was one of the volunteers that fired  the British armed vessels sent to attack Savannah by water, while Major  Maitland and Major Grant attacked it by land. The crews of these vessels  were compelled to escape without their clothes and arms. General Jackson  served in the lower part of Georgia until the fall of Savannah in 1778,  when he and his friend John Milledge made their way to the patriot  troops, commanded by General Moultrie. Such was the condition of these  men, both of whom afterwards became governors of Georgia, that they  were compelled to make the greater part of their journey barefoot and in  rags. Their appearance was so much against them that they were arrested  as spies by some American soldiers, and would have been hanged but for  the timely arrival of a gentleman who knew them.    General Jackson was at the siege of Savannah, and, after the disastrous  result of that affair, returned to South Carolina. The victory of the  Americans at Blackstock's House, in South Carolina, was almost wholly  due to the Georgians who were there. Sumter commanded at the beginning  of the action, but a severe wound compelled him to retire from the  field. The command then devolved upon the oldest Georgia officer,  General John Twiggs, who was assisted by Jackson, Clarke, and Chandler.  In this engagement Tarleton, the famous leader of the British dragoons,  was defeated for the first time, and he was never able to recover the  prestige he had lost. Tarleton fled from the field, and Jackson was  ordered to pursue him. It was owing only to the fleetness of his horse  that Tarleton escaped.    [Illustration: General James Jackson 093]    At the battle of The Cow-pens, Jackson again distinguished himself.  \"Major Jackson,\" says General Andrew Pickens, \"by his example, and firm,  active conduct, did much to animate the soldiers and insure the success  of the day. He ran the utmost risk of his life in seizing the colors of  the 71st British Regiment, and afterwards introducing Major Mc-Arthur,  commanding officer of the British Infantry, as a prisoner of war to  General Morgan.\" His services brought him to the attention of General  Greene, and he was sent on a tour of difficult duty through North  Carolina. He was so successful in this, that the commanding general  authorized him to raise a partisan legion of infantry and cavalry for  service in Georgia. By means of his native eloquence, which was said  to be almost irresistible, he succeeded in raising the legion in a very  short time. Wherever he addressed the people, there were loud cries of  \"Liberty and Jackson forever!\" When his legion had been organized, he  was appointed lieutenant colonel. His dragoons were clothed and armed by  themselves, with the exception of their pistols. Their coats were made  of dressed deerskins, and faced with the little blue that could be  procured.    Just before the siege of Augusta, Jackson was called upon to employ  his eloquence in preventing the militia from giving up in despair  and returning to their homes. These men were utterly worn out. Being  ignorant men, they could see no ray of hope. They lacked every necessary  of life. Jackson roused their drooping spirits, restored their hopes,  and revived their old-time enthusiasm. At the siege of Augusta these men  fought fiercely. Jackson himself led one of the advance parties. After  the surrender of the town, he was ordered to level the fortifications,  and he was appointed commandant. He was afterwards ordered to take  position midway between Augusta and Savannah. While he held this  position, a conspiracy was formed in the infantry to kill him in  his bed. A soldier named Davis, who waited in the commander's tent,  suspected that something was wrong. So he mingled among the men, and  applied many harsh epithets to Jackson. Thinking to make Davis useful to  them, the conspirators told him their plans, which he made haste to lay  before his superior officer. Shortly afterwards the infantry were drawn  up in line, and the ringleaders in the conspiracy arrested, tried, and  executed.    After the war the Legislature gave Davis a horse, saddle, and bridle,  and five hundred acres of land, as a reward for his fidelity.    Jackson was with General Wayne in his Georgia campaign, and was  intrusted by him with many hazardous duties. When Savannah surrendered,  General Wayne issued an order in which he said, \"Lieutenant Colonel  Jackson, in consideration of his severe and fatiguing service in the  advance, is to receive the key of Savannah, and is allowed to enter the  western gate.\"    In 1786, Jackson was made brigadier general, and had command of the  forces operating against the Indians. Between 1788 and 1806 General  Jackson held almost every high office within the gift of the people of  the State,--member of the Legislature, governor when only thirty-one  years old, member of the first Congress held under the Federal  Constitution, member of the State Constitutional Convention,  presidential elector, and United States senator.    With General Jackson in many of his engagements was General Elijah  Clarke, who in many respects was the most remarkable soldier  that Georgia contributed to the War for Independence. With fairer  opportunities than he had, he would have made a great commander. He had  small knowledge of tactics, but he had what is better,--the skill to  take advantage of quickly passing events, and the coolness that made him  complete master of all his resources. He was a man of the most striking  characteristics, and he came out of the war with many bitter enemies  among those with whom he came in contact. This feeling was perpetuated  by the political campaigns in which his son, John Clarke, took part  after the war. A trace of this is to be seen in the sketch which  Governor Gilmer gives to Elijah Clarke in his curious book entitled  \"Georgians.\" It is undoubtedly true that Elijah Clarke was ignorant of  what is called book knowledge, but he was not much worse off in this  respect than the famous Confederate General Forrest, who is thought by  some high military critics to have been the most remarkable commander  on the Southern side in the civil war. Elijah Clarke, as well as General  Forrest, had something that served them a better turn than a mere  knowledge of books. They had a thorough knowledge of men, and a quick  eye for the situations that follow each other so rapidly in a skirmish  or battle.
