The essence extracted from the rind  is yellow, fragrant, slightly bitter; density, 0.856; boiling point  165°. The juice which is turbid and pale yellow in color contains 9%  citric acid, 3-5% gum and sugar and 2-8/10% inorganic salts. The  essence is used to flavor certain pharmaceutical preparations, and  is a diffusible stimulant which may be given internally in doses of  3-6 drops on a little sugar. The bitter rind is occasionally used in  infusion as a stomachic and stimulant. The juice is most commonly  used in lemonade, a cooling drink which, used intemperately in the  Philippines, is apt to cause gastro-intestinal trouble, so commonly  attributed to \"irritation,\" but really the result of a general atony  of the digestive organs. Lemon juice is also used with very good  results as a local cleansing application for sore throat, as well as  externally on fetid ulcers. In some forms of malarial fever it seems  to have given satisfactory results, administered internally.    In many navies lemon juice forms a part of the sea ration as a  preventive of scurvy, upon which it exercises a real and noteworthy  action. The Danish navy adopted it for this purpose in 1770, the  English navy followed, then the French and possibly others. The English  call it lime-juice, and its preventive dose is 30-40 grams a day. Its  curative dose is 100-150 grams a day. To preserve the lime-juice it  was bottled with a layer of oil, which, floating on the surface kept it  from contact with the air; but this process gave it a bad taste as did  also the addition of sulphate of calcium, and at present the English  add, to each liter of juice, 60 grams of alcohol, which preserves it  perfectly. Fonssagrives says that the antiscorbutic action of lemon  juice is due rather to the vegetable juice itself than to the citric  acid which it contains.    Botanical Description.--A most familiar tree 11° or more high,  trunk with solitary thorns. Leaves ovate, obtuse, acute-toothed, the  petiole bearing serrate wings. Calyx 4-6-toothed. Corolla, 4 thick  petals. Filaments 10-25 on the receptacle, some joined and bearing  2-3 anthers. Fruit thin-skinned, globular, about 1' in diameter;  the rind adheres closely to the pulp.    (This fruit closely resembles, if it is not identical with the lime  fruit, _C. Limetta_, or _C. Bergamia_, Risso, though Gray states that  the leaf of the latter has a wingless petiole.--J. B. T.)    Habitat.--Common to all parts of the islands.        _Citrus Bigaradia_, Hook. f. (_C. vulgaris_, Risso; _C. aurantium_,  Blanco.)    Nom. Vulg.--_Naranjas del país_, Sp.; _Kahel_, _Kahil_, Tag.; _Native  Orange_, Eng.    Uses.--The rind of the _cagel_ is the so-called bitter orange peel,  the best of which comes from Curaçao and Barbadoes. It is tonic and is  used in decoction and in syrup. The infusion of the leaves, 5-10 grams  to the liter, is useful as a sedative and diaphoretic in hysterical and  nervous attacks; the infusion of the flowers is similarly used. When  distilled the flowers yield a very sweet essential oil called _neroli_,  which is used as a perfume only.    Botanical Description.--A tree 15-20° high, trunk bearing solitary  spines. Leaves medium lanceolate, serrate, the apex notched, petioles  winged. Flowers usually solitary. Calyx 4-5-toothed. Corolla 4-5  petals. Filaments joined or separate. Anthers about 20. The fruit,  a small orange 2' or more in diameter, the peel closely adherent.    The _C. aurantium verum_ or _C. reticulata_ (Blanco) has a yellow  pulp and the rind is readily separated from it, a thin net of fibers  intervening.        _Citrus decumana_, L.    Nom. Vulg.--_Suha_, _Lukban_, Tag.; _Toronjas_ Penins.; _Naranjas_,  Sp.-Fil.    Uses.--The fruit, which is handsome and large, and the leaves and  flowers, are used for the same purposes as those of _C. bigaradia_.    Habitat.--The above species are cultivated in all parts of the islands,  and, like the variety _C. aurantium verum_, H. f. (_C. reticulata_,  Blanco), commonly called _naranjita_, are among the most abundant of  native fruits.        _Ægle decandra_, Naves. (_Feronia ternata_, Blanco.)    Nom. Vulg.--_Malakabuyaw_, Tag.; _Tabog_, Pam., Tag. (A species of  Bael-Fruit Tree.)    Uses.--We do not know the medicinal use of this plant in the  Philippines. Probably it has none, but we may give those of the  species. _R. marmelos_, Cor., the fruit of which is almost identical  with that of our species and is called _Bela_ or _Bael_ in India. The  fruit of the Malakabuyaw is ovoid and full of a mucilaginous pulp,  aromatic and acid, the same as that of the Bael. The uses of the latter  are the following: The pulp acts as an astringent, but it would be  more correctly called a tonic of the intestinal mucosa, for it has  been experimentally proved that, although it checks diarrhoea, it also  acts as a laxative in chronic constipation. In both conditions it seems  to operate by toning and regulating the functions of the intestine.    Martin, an English physician, was the first to call attention to the  properties of Bael, and according to Dr. Green one dose of the pulp  of the ripe fruit, prepared with sugar and given every morning, is  an efficient remedy in the treatment of the dyspepsia of Europeans  in India, especially in the form characterized by constipation and  flatulence. The green fruit is a powerful astringent used by the  Hindoos for diarrhoea. In cholera epidemics Dr. Bose advises the daily  use of an ice made from the pulp of the ripe fruit, the object being  the regulation of the functions of the intestine.    The Pharmacopoeia of India contains the following preparations:              _Mixture._--Pulp of the ripe fruit       60 grams.                      Water                       120 grams.                      Sugar                        60 grams.      Mix, and if desired add chopped ice. This forms a very agreeable  drink which has the aroma of the fruit itself, and may be repeated  2-3 times a day. When the fruit is ripe, this preparation is not only  astringent in cases of diarrhoea, but possesses the additional property  of increasing the appetite.  If the patient's stomach is very weak,  the preparation may produce vomiting in which event it is necessary  to give it in small doses or to employ the extract.    _Extract of Bael._--Pulp of the ripe fruit is placed in a vessel and  sufficient water added to cover it. It is then heated and evaporated  to the consistency of a soft extract. The dose is 2-4 grams, 2,  3 or 4 times a day.    _Fluid Extract of Bael._--              Pulp of Bael          500 grams.          Water                   3 liters.          Rectified alcohol      60 grams.      The Bael is macerated in a third of the water and at the end of 12  hours the liquid is decanted and another third of water is added;  the maceration is repeated and the same process followed till the  last third of water is used. Express the residuum, put all the liquid  into one vessel, filter and evaporate till reduced to 800 grams,  then cool and add the alcohol. Dose, 4-8 grams.    The fluid extract is less active than the freshly prepared solid  extract.    According to Dr. G. Bidie, the fruit of the _Feronia elephantum_,  Correa (the species that grows in the Philippines), possesses the  same properties as Bael. Its leaves are astringent, aromatic and  carminative, and the gum with which the trunk of the tree is covered  is a good substitute for gum arabic.    Botanical Description.--A tree 7-8 meters high, the trunk covered with  large, solitary spines. Leaves alternate, ternate. Leaflets lanceolate,  scalloped and glabrous, the middle one larger than the others. Calyx  5-toothed. Corolla, 5 thick petals, linear, much longer than the  calyx. Stamens 10. Ovary cylindrical. Style and stigma thick. Fruit  oblong, more than 3' long and 2' thick, with a surface irregular with  prominences and grooves; 10 or more compartments, each containing  several ovoid, compressed seeds, ending with a woolly tuft.    Habitat.--San Mateo, Montalbán (Manila); Arayat (La Pampanga).        _Feronia elephantum_, Correa. (_Murraya adorata_, Blanco.)    Nom. Vulg.--_Panoan_, _Pamunoan_, Vis.; _Wood-apple_, Eng.    Uses.--The pulp of the ripe fruit has an agreeable odor and  is edible. In India the green fruit is used as an astringent in  diarrhoea and dysentery; the ripe fruit is given in diseases of the  gums and as a gargle. Mir Muhammad Husain states that the ripe fruit  is a refrigerant, astringent, cardiac and general tonic, and is very  efficacious in the treatment of salivation and ulcers of the throat,  strengthening the gums and operating as an astringent. A sorbet made  of the ripe fruit whets the appetite and the pulp is used locally  for bites of venomous animals. In the latter case the pulverized bark  may be used if the fruit cannot be obtained.    The fruit of Ferona is a substitute for Bael (_Ægle Marmelos_), and is  used as such by the English physicians in the hospitals of India. The  tender leaves have an agreeable aroma similar to that of anise and  are used internally in decoction as a stomachic and carminative.    The incised trunk exudes a gum which is used in India as a substitute  for gum arabic and there is an active trade in this gum in the bazars  of Bombay and Calcutta. According to Pereira, it was at one time  imported into England from the east of India under the name of gum  arabic. It exists in the form of irregular, semitransparent pieces, of  a brownish-red color. With water it forms a mucilage as adhesive as gum  arabic, and this solution reddens litmus paper. It is dextrogyrous and  is precipitated by the neutral acetate of lead and by caustic baryta.    Botanical Description.--Tree 3-4 meters high. Leaves fragrant,  opposite, odd-pinnate. Leaflets, 2 pairs, lanceolate, entire,  and glabrous. Common petiole flattened above. Flowers terminal,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2641"],[0,"A Room with a View (#12)"],[1," Lavish, who had several times tried to  interrupt his mordant wit. \"The narrowness and superficiality of the  Anglo-Saxon tourist is nothing less than a menace.\"    \"Quite so. Now, the English colony at Florence, Miss Honeychurch--and it  is of considerable size, though, of course, not all equally--a few are  here for trade, for example. But the greater part are students. Lady  Helen Laverstock is at present busy over Fra Angelico. I mention her  name because we are passing her villa on the left. No, you can only see  it if you stand--no, do not stand; you will fall. She is very proud of  that thick hedge. Inside, perfect seclusion. One might have gone back  six hundred years. Some critics believe that her garden was the scene of  The Decameron, which lends it an additional interest, does it not?\"    \"It does indeed!\" cried Miss Lavish. \"Tell me, where do they place the  scene of that wonderful seventh day?\"    But Mr. Eager proceeded to tell Miss Honeychurch that on the right lived  Mr. Someone Something, an American of the best type--so rare!--and that  the Somebody Elses were farther down the hill. \"Doubtless you know  her monographs in the series of 'Mediaeval Byways'? He is working at  Gemistus Pletho. Sometimes as I take tea in their beautiful grounds I  hear, over the wall, the electric tram squealing up the new road with  its loads of hot, dusty, unintelligent tourists who are going to 'do'  Fiesole in an hour in order that they may say they have been there, and  I think--think--I think how little they think what lies so near them.\"    During this speech the two figures on the box were sporting with each  other disgracefully. Lucy had a spasm of envy. Granted that they wished  to misbehave, it was pleasant for them to be able to do so. They were  probably the only people enjoying the expedition. The carriage swept  with agonizing jolts up through the Piazza of Fiesole and into the  Settignano road.    \"Piano! piano!\" said Mr. Eager, elegantly waving his hand over his head.    \"Va bene, signore, va bene, va bene,\" crooned the driver, and whipped  his horses up again.    Now Mr. Eager and Miss Lavish began to talk against each other on the  subject of Alessio Baldovinetti. Was he a cause of the Renaissance, or  was he one of its manifestations? The other carriage was left behind. As  the pace increased to a gallop the large, slumbering form of Mr. Emerson  was thrown against the chaplain with the regularity of a machine.    \"Piano! piano!\" said he, with a martyred look at Lucy.    An extra lurch made him turn angrily in his seat. Phaethon, who for some  time had been endeavouring to kiss Persephone, had just succeeded.    A little scene ensued, which, as Miss Bartlett said afterwards, was  most unpleasant. The horses were stopped, the lovers were ordered to  disentangle themselves, the boy was to lose his pourboire, the girl was  immediately to get down.    \"She is my sister,\" said he, turning round on them with piteous eyes.    Mr. Eager took the trouble to tell him that he was a liar.    Phaethon hung down his head, not at the matter of the accusation, but  at its manner. At this point Mr. Emerson, whom the shock of stopping  had awoke, declared that the lovers must on no account be separated, and  patted them on the back to signify his approval. And Miss Lavish, though  unwilling to ally him, felt bound to support the cause of Bohemianism.    \"Most certainly I would let them be,\" she cried. \"But I dare say I  shall receive scant support. I have always flown in the face of the  conventions all my life. This is what I call an adventure.\"    \"We must not submit,\" said Mr. Eager. \"I knew he was trying it on. He is  treating us as if we were a party of Cook's tourists.\"    \"Surely no!\" said Miss Lavish, her ardour visibly decreasing.    The other carriage had drawn up behind, and sensible Mr. Beebe  called out that after this warning the couple would be sure to behave  themselves properly.    \"Leave them alone,\" Mr. Emerson begged the chaplain, of whom he stood  in no awe. \"Do we find happiness so often that we should turn it off the  box when it happens to sit there? To be driven by lovers--A king might  envy us, and if we part them it's more like sacrilege than anything I  know.\"    Here the voice of Miss Bartlett was heard saying that a crowd had begun  to collect.    Mr. Eager, who suffered from an over-fluent tongue rather than a  resolute will, was determined to make himself heard. He addressed the  driver again. Italian in the mouth of Italians is a deep-voiced stream,  with unexpected cataracts and boulders to preserve it from monotony.  In Mr. Eager's mouth it resembled nothing so much as an acid whistling  fountain which played ever higher and higher, and quicker and quicker,  and more and more shrilly, till abruptly it was turned off with a click.    \"Signorina!\" said the man to Lucy, when the display had ceased. Why  should he appeal to Lucy?    \"Signorina!\" echoed Persephone in her glorious contralto. She pointed at  the other carriage. Why?    For a moment the two girls looked at each other. Then Persephone got  down from the box.    \"Victory at last!\" said Mr. Eager, smiting his hands together as the  carriages started again.    \"It is not victory,\" said Mr. Emerson. \"It is defeat. You have parted  two people who were happy.\"    Mr. Eager shut his eyes. He was obliged to sit next to Mr. Emerson, but  he would not speak to him. The old man was refreshed by sleep, and took  up the matter warmly. He commanded Lucy to agree with him; he shouted  for support to his son.    \"We have tried to buy what cannot be bought with money. He has bargained  to drive us, and he is doing it. We have no rights over his soul.\"    Miss Lavish frowned. It is hard when a person you have classed as  typically British speaks out of his character.    \"He was not driving us well,\" she said. \"He jolted us.\"    \"That I deny. It was as restful as sleeping. Aha! he is jolting us now.  Can you wonder? He would like to throw us out, and most certainly he is  justified. And if I were superstitious I'd be frightened of the girl,  too. It doesn't do to injure young people. Have you ever heard of  Lorenzo de Medici?\"    Miss Lavish bristled.    \"Most certainly I have. Do you refer to Lorenzo il Magnifico, or to  Lorenzo, Duke of Urbino, or to Lorenzo surnamed Lorenzino on account of  his diminutive stature?\"    \"The Lord knows. Possibly he does know, for I refer to Lorenzo the poet.  He wrote a line--so I heard yesterday--which runs like this: 'Don't go  fighting against the Spring.'\"    Mr. Eager could not resist the opportunity for erudition.    \"Non fate guerra al Maggio,\" he murmured. \"'War not with the May' would  render a correct meaning.\"    \"The point is, we have warred with it. Look.\" He pointed to the Val  d'Arno, which was visible far below them, through the budding trees.  \"Fifty miles of Spring, and we've come up to admire them. Do you suppose  there's any difference between Spring in nature and Spring in man? But  there we go, praising the one and condemning the other as improper,  ashamed that the same laws work eternally through both.\"    No one encouraged him to talk. Presently Mr. Eager gave a signal for the  carriages to stop and marshalled the party for their ramble on the hill.  A hollow like a great amphitheatre, full of terraced steps and misty  olives, now lay between them and the heights of Fiesole, and the road,  still following its curve, was about to sweep on to a promontory which  stood out in the plain. It was this promontory, uncultivated, wet,  covered with bushes and occasional trees, which had caught the fancy of  Alessio Baldovinetti nearly five hundred years before. He had ascended  it, that diligent and rather obscure master, possibly with an eye to  business, possibly for the joy of ascending. Standing there, he had seen  that view of the Val d'Arno and distant Florence, which he afterwards  had introduced not very effectively into his work. But where exactly had  he stood? That was the question which Mr. Eager hoped to solve now. And  Miss Lavish, whose nature was attracted by anything problematical, had  become equally enthusiastic.    But it is not easy to carry the pictures of Alessio Baldovinetti in your  head, even if you have remembered to look at them before starting. And  the haze in the valley increased the difficulty of the quest.    The party sprang about from tuft to tuft of grass, their anxiety to keep  together being only equalled by their desire to go different directions.  Finally they split into groups. Lucy clung to Miss Bartlett and Miss  Lavish; the Emersons returned to hold laborious converse with the  drivers; while the two clergymen, who were expected to have topics in  common, were left to each other.    The two elder ladies soon threw off the mask. In the audible whisper  that was now so familiar to Lucy they began to discuss, not Alessio  Baldovinetti, but the drive. Miss Bartlett had asked Mr. George Emerson  what his profession was, and he had answered \"the railway.\" She was very  sorry that she had asked him. She had no idea that it would be such a  dreadful answer, or she would not have asked him. Mr. Beebe had turned  the conversation so cleverly, and she hoped that the young man was not  very much hurt at her asking him.    \"The railway!\" gasped Miss Lavish. \"Oh, but I shall die! Of course it  was the railway!\" She could not control her mirth. \"He is the image of a  porter--on, on the South-Eastern.\"    \"Eleanor, be quiet,\" plucking at her vivacious companion. \"Hush! They'll  hear--the Emersons--\"    \"I can't stop. Let me go my wicked way. A porter--\"    \"Eleanor!\"    \"I'm sure it's all right,\" put in Lucy. \"The Emersons won't hear, and  they wouldn't mind if they did.\"    Miss Lavish did not seem pleased at this.    \"Miss Honeychurch listening!\" she said rather crossly. \"Pouf! Wouf! You  naughty girl! Go away!\"    \"Oh, Lucy, you ought to be with Mr. Eager,"]]]
