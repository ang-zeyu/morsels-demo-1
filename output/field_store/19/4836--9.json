The _Bengalee Magazine_, devoted to the interests of Indian ladies,  its editorials all from woman's pen, shows Asiatic advance.    In the United States the list of women's fashion papers, with their  women editors and correspondents, is numerous and important. For  fourteen years _Harper's Bazaar_ has been ably edited by Mary L.  Booth; other papers of similar character are both owned and edited by  women. _Madame Demorest's Monthly_, a paper that originated the vast  pattern business which has extended its ramifications into every part  of the country and given employment to thousands of women. As  illustrative of woman's continuity of purpose in newspaper work, we  may mention the fact that for fifteen years Fanny Fern did not fail to  have an article in readiness each week for the _Ledger_, and for  twenty years Jennie June (Mrs. Croly) has edited _Demorest's Monthly_  and contributed to many other papers throughout the United States.  Mary Mapes Dodge has edited the _St. Nicholas_ the past eight years.  So important a place do women writers hold, _Harper's Monthly_  asserts, that the exceptionally large prices are paid to women  contributors. The spiciest critics, reporters, and correspondents  to-day, are women--Grace Greenwood, Louise Chandler Moulton, Mary  Clemmer. Laura C. Holloway is upon the editorial staff of the Brooklyn  _Eagle_. The New York _Times_ boasts a woman (Midi Morgan) cattle  reporter, one of the best judges of stock in the country. In some  papers, over their own names, women edit columns on special subjects,  and fill important positions on journals owned and edited by men.  Elizabeth Boynton Harbert edits \"The Woman's Kingdom\" in the  _Inter-Ocean_, one of the leading dailies of Chicago. Mary Forney  Weigley edits a social department in her father's--John W.  Forney--paper, the _Progress_, in Philadelphia. The political columns  of many papers are prepared by women, men often receiving the credit.  Among the best editorials in the New York _Tribune_, from Margaret  Fuller to Lucia Gilbert Calhoun, have been from the pens of women.    If the proverb that \"the pen is mightier than the sword\" be true,  woman's skill and force in using this mightier weapon must soon change  the destinies of the world.          CHAPTER III.    THE WORLD'S ANTI-SLAVERY CONVENTION, LONDON, JUNE 12, 1840.           Individualism rather than Authority--Personal appearance of       Abolitionists--Clerical attempt to silence Woman--Double battle       against the tyranny of sex and color--Bigoted Abolitionists--James       G. Birney likes freedom on a Southern plantation, but not at his       own fireside--John Bull never dreamt that Woman would answer his       call--The venerable Thomas Clarkson received by the Convention       standing--Lengthy debate on \"Female\" delegates--The \"Females\"       rejected--William Lloyd Garrison refused to sit in the Convention.    In gathering up the threads of history in the last century, and  weaving its facts and philosophy together, one can trace the liberal  social ideas, growing out of the political and religious revolutions  in France, Germany, Italy, and America; and their tendency to  substitute for the divine right of kings, priests, and orders of  nobility, the higher and broader one of individual conscience and  judgment in all matters pertaining to this life and that which is to  come. It is not surprising that in so marked a transition period from  the old to the new, as seen in the eighteenth century, that women,  trained to think and write and speak, should have discovered that  they, too, had some share in the new-born liberties suddenly announced  to the world. That the radical political theories, propagated in  different countries, made their legitimate impress on the minds of  women of the highest culture, is clearly proved by their writings and  conversation. While in their ignorance, women are usually more  superstitious, more devoutly religious than men; those trained to  thought, have generally manifested more interest in political  questions, and have more frequently spoken and written on such themes,  than on those merely religious. This may be attributed, in a measure,  to the fact that the tendency of woman's mind, at this stage of her  development, is toward practical, rather than toward speculative  science.    Questions of political economy lie within the realm of positive  knowledge; those of theology belong to the world of mysteries and  abstractions, which those minds, only, that imagine they have  compassed the known, are ambitious to enter and explore. And yet, the  quickening power of the Protestant Reformation roused woman, as well  as man, to new and higher thought. The bold declarations of Luther,  placing individual judgment above church authority, the faith of the  Quaker that the inner light was a better guide than arbitrary law, the  religious idealism of the Transcendentalists, and their teachings that  souls had no sex, had each a marked influence in developing woman's  self-assertion. Such ideas making all divine revelations as veritable  and momentous to one soul, as another, tended directly to equalize the  members of the human family, and place men and women on the same plane  of moral responsibility.    The revelations of science, too, analyzing and portraying the wonders  and beauties of this material world, crowned with new dignity, man and  woman,--Nature's last and proudest work. Combe and Spurzheim, proving  by their Phrenological discoveries that the feelings, sentiments, and  affections of the soul mould and shape the skull, gave new importance  to woman's thought as mother of the race. Thus each new idea in  religion, politics, science, and philosophy, tending to individualism,  rather than authority, came into the world freighted with new hopes of  liberty for woman.    And when in the progress of civilization the time had fully come for  the recognition of the feminine element in humanity, women, in every  civilized country unknown to each other, began simultaneously to  demand a broader sphere of action. Thus the first public demand for  political equality by a body of women in convention assembled, was a  link in the chain of woman's development, binding the future with the  past, as complete and necessary in itself, as the events of any other  period of her history. The ridicule of facts does not change their  character. Many who study the past with interest, and see the  importance of seeming trifles in helping forward great events, often  fail to understand some of the best pages of history made under their  own eyes. Hence the woman suffrage movement has not yet been accepted  as the legitimate outgrowth of American ideas--a component part of the  history of our republic--but is falsely considered the willful  outburst of a few unbalanced minds, whose ideas can never be realized  under any form of government.    Among the immediate causes that led to the demand for the equal  political rights of women, in this country, we may note three:    1. The discussion in several of the State Legislatures on the property  rights of married women, which, heralded by the press with comments  grave and gay, became the topic of general interest around many  fashionable dinner-tables, and at many humble firesides. In this way  all phases of the question were touched upon, involving the  relations of the sexes, and gradually widening to all human  interests--political, religious, civil, and social. The press and  pulpit became suddenly vigilant in marking out woman's sphere, while  woman herself seemed equally vigilant in her efforts to step outside  the prescribed limits.    2. A great educational work was accomplished by the able lectures of  Frances Wright, on political, religious, and social questions.  Ernestine L. Rose, following in her wake, equally liberal in her  religious opinions, and equally well informed on the science of  government, helped to deepen and perpetuate the impression Frances  Wright had made on the minds of unprejudiced hearers.    3. And above all other causes of the \"Woman Suffrage Movement,\" was  the Anti-Slavery struggle in this country. The ranks of the  Abolitionists were composed of the most eloquent orators, the ablest  logicians, men and women of the purest moral character and best minds  in the nation. They were usually spoken of in the early days as \"an  illiterate, ill-mannered, poverty-stricken, crazy set of long-haired  Abolitionists.\" While the fact is, some of the most splendid specimens  of manhood and womanhood, in physical appearance, in culture,  refinement, and knowledge of polite life, were found among the early  Abolitionists. James G. Birney, John Pierpont, Gerrit Smith, Wendell  Phillips, Charles Sumner, Maria Weston Chapman, Helen Garrison, Ann  Green Phillips, Abby Kelly, Paulina Wright Davis, Lucretia Mott, were  all remarkably fine-looking.    In the early Anti-Slavery conventions, the broad principles of human  rights were so exhaustively discussed, justice, liberty, and equality,  so clearly taught, that the women who crowded to listen, readily  learned the lesson of freedom for themselves, and early began to take  part in the debates and business affairs of all associations. Woman  not only felt every pulsation of man's heart for freedom, and by her  enthusiasm inspired the glowing eloquence that maintained him through  the struggle, but earnestly advocated with her own lips human freedom  and equality. When Angelina and Sarah Grimke began to lecture in New  England, their audiences were at first composed entirely of women, but  gentlemen, hearing of their eloquence and power, soon began timidly to  slip into the back seats, one by one. And before the public were  aroused to the dangerous innovation, these women were speaking in  crowded, promiscuous assemblies. The clergy opposed to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28026"],[0,"Great Pianists on Piano Playing (#12)"],[1,"satisfied with his or her work, but--and this  is the all-important point--runs the risk of undermining his or her  health. The precious days of youth should be devoted primarily to the  storing up of health, without which lasting success is impossible.  Nothing is more harmful to sound physical development and mental growth  than the strain of extensive tours. It is true that one great virtuoso  now before the public played frequently before large audiences as an  infant prodigy. But, happily, wise and efficient influences served to  check this mad career. The young artist was placed in the hands of a  great teacher and given a chance to reach full physical maturity and  artistic stature before resuming public appearances. Had it been  otherwise, it is a matter of common belief that this great talent would  have fizzled out.    \"By this I do not mean that the pupil should be prevented from playing  at recitals in the home city. Playing of this kind gives the pupil  confidence and smooths the way for his work as a mature artist. These  performances should be rare, except in the case of performances given in  the home of the pupil or at the teacher's home. What I object to is the  exploitation on a large scale of the infant prodigy.      THOROUGH PREPARATION NECESSARY    \"One of the real secrets of success in public appearance is thorough  preparation. In fact there is no talisman, no secret that one can pass  over to another and say, 'Here is my secret, go thou and do likewise.'  What a valuable secret it would be--the mysterious secret processes of  the Krupp Gun Works in Germany would be trifling in comparison. Genuine  worth is, after all, the great essential, and thorough preparation leads  to genuine worth. For instance, I have long felt that the mental technic  that the study of Bach's inventions and fugues afford could not be  supplied by any other means. The peculiar polyphonic character of these  works trains the mind to recognize the separate themes so ingeniously  and beautifully interwoven and at the same time the fingers receive a  kind of discipline which hardly any other study can secure.    \"The layman can hardly conceive how difficult it is to play at the same  time two themes different in character and running in opposite  directions. The student fully realizes this difficulty when he finds  that it takes years to master it. These separate themes must be  individualized; they must be conceived as separate, but their bearing  upon the work as a whole must never be overlooked.    \"The purity of style to be found in Bach, in connection with his  marvelous contrapuntal designs, should be expounded to the student at as  early an age as his intellectual development will permit. It may take  some time to create a taste for Bach, but the teacher will be rewarded  with results so substantial and permanent that all the trouble and time  will seem well worth while.    \"There is also a refining influence about which I would like to speak.  The practice of Bach seems to fairly grind off the rough edges, and  instead of a raw, bungling technic the student acquires a kind of  finish from the study of the old master of Eisenach that nothing else  can give him.    \"I do not mean to be understood that the study of Bach, even if it be  ever so thorough, suffices in itself to give one a perfect technic.  Vastly more is necessary. The student who would fit himself for a  concert career must have the advice of a great teacher and must work  incessantly and conscientiously under his guidance. I emphasize the  study of Bach merely because I find it is not pursued as much as it  deserves. That technical finish is of the very essence of success in  public appearance, goes without saying. It is not only indispensable for  a creditable performance, but the consciousness of possessing it  contributes to that confidence of the player without which he cannot  hope to make an impression upon his audience.      LESCHETIZKY AND 'METHOD'    \"Speaking about teachers reminds me to put forth this caution: Do not  pin your faith to a method. There is good and, alas! some bad in most  methods. We hear a great deal these days about the Leschetizky method.  During the five years I was with Leschetizky, he made it very plain that  he had no fixed method in the ordinary sense of the word. Like every  good teacher, he studied the individuality of each pupil and taught him  according to that individuality. It might almost be said that he had a  different method for each pupil, and I have often said that  Leschetizky's method is to have no fixed method. Of course, there are  certain preparatory exercises which with slight variations he wants all  his pupils to go through. But it is not so much the exercises in  themselves as the patience and painful persistence in executing them to  which they owe their virtue. Of course, Leschetizky has his preference  for certain works for their great educational value. He has his  convictions as to the true interpretation to be given to the various  compositions, but those do not form what may properly be called a  method. Personally, I am rather skeptical when anybody announces that he  teaches any particular method. Leschetizky, without any particular  method, is a great force by virtue of his tremendously interesting  personality and his great qualities as an artist. He is himself a  never-ending source of inspiration. At eighty he was still a youth, full  of vitality and enthusiasm. Some student, diffident but worthy, was  always encouraged; another was incited by sarcasm; still another was  scolded outright. Practical illustration on the piano, showing 'how not  to do it,' telling of pertinent stories to elucidate a point, are among  the means which he constantly employed to bring out the best that was in  his pupils. A good teacher cannot insure success and Leschetizky has  naturally had many pupils who will never become great virtuosos. It was  never in the pupils and, no matter how great the teacher, he cannot  create talent that does not exist.    \"The many books published upon the Leschetizky system by his assistants  have merit, but they by no means constitute a Leschetizky system. They  simply give some very rational preparatory exercise that the assistants  give in preparing pupils for the master. Leschetizky himself laughs when  one speaks of his 'method' or 'system.'    \"Success in public appearance will never come through any system or  method except that which works toward the end of making a mature and  genuine artist.      WELL-SELECTED PROGRAMS    \"Skill in the arrangement of an artist's programs has much to do with  his success. This matter has two distinct aspects. Firstly, the program  must _look_ attractive, and secondly, it must _sound_ well in the  rendition. When I say the program must look attractive, I mean that it  must contain works which interest concert-goers. It should be neither  entirely conventional, nor should it contain novelties exclusively. The  classics should be represented, because the large army of students  expect to be especially benefited by hearing these performed by a great  artist. Novelties must be placed on the program to make it attractive to  the maturer habitues of the concert room.    \"But more important, to my mind, is the other aspect of program making  which I have mentioned. There must be contrasts in the character and  tonal nature of the compositions played. They must be so grouped that  the interest of the hearers will be not only sustained to the end, but  will gradually increase. It goes without saying that each composition  should have merit and worth as musical literature. But beyond that,  there should be variety in the character of the different compositions:  the classic, the romantic, and the modern compositions should all be  given representation. To play several slow movements or several  vivacious movements in succession would tend to tire the listener.  Anti-climaxes should be avoided.    \"It may truly be said that program making is in itself a high art. It is  difficult to give advice on this subject by any general statement.  Generalizations are too often misleading. I would advise the young  artist to study carefully the programs of the most successful artists  and to attempt to discover the principle underlying their arrangement.    \"One thing which should never be forgotten is that the object of a  concert is not merely to show off the skill of the performer, but to  instruct, entertain and elevate the audience. The bulk of the program  should be composed of standard works, but novelties of genuine worth  should be given a place on the program.      PERSONALITY    \"The player's personality is of inestimable importance in winning the  approval of the public. I do not refer particularly to personal beauty,  although it cannot be doubted that a pleasing appearance is helpful in  conquering an audience. What I mean is sincerity, individuality,  temperament. What we vaguely describe as magnetism is often possessed by  players who can lay no particular claim to personal beauty. Some players  seem fairly to hypnotize their audiences--yes, hypnotize them. This is  not done by practicing any species of black art, or by consciously  following any psychological formula, but by the sheer intensity of  feeling of the artist at the moment of performance.    \"The great performer in such moments of passion forgets himself  entirely. He is in a sort of artistic trance. Technical mastery of the  composition being presupposed, the artist need not and does not give  thought to the matter of playing the notes correctly, but, re-creating  in himself what he feels to have been the mood of the composer,  re-creates the composition itself. It is this kind of playing which  establishes an invisible cord, connecting the player's and the hearers'  hearts, and, swayed himself by the feelings of the moment, he sways his  audience. He makes the"]]]
