Seldom was money  better bestowed. Part of it went to buy books and a glass-polishing  machine, with the help of which young Fraunhofer studied mathematics and  optics, and secretly exercised himself in the shaping and finishing of  lenses; the remainder purchased his release from the tyranny of one  Weichselberger, a looking-glass maker by trade, to whom he had been  bound apprentice on the death of his parents. A period of struggle and  privation followed, during which, however, he rapidly extended his  acquirements; and was thus eminently fitted for the task awaiting him,  when, in 1806, he entered the optical department of the establishment  founded two years previously by Von Reichenbach and Utzschneider. He now  zealously devoted himself to the improvement of the achromatic  telescope; and, after a prolonged study of the theory of lenses, and  many toilsome experiments in the manufacture of flint-glass, he  succeeded in perfecting, December 12, 1817, an object-glass of exquisite  quality and finish, 9-1/2 inches in diameter, and of 14 feet focal  length.    This (as it was then considered) gigantic lens was secured by Struve for  the Russian Government, and the \"great Dorpat refractor\"--the first of  the large achromatics which have played such an important part in modern  astronomy--was, late in 1824, set up in the place which it still  occupies. By ingenious improvements in mounting and fitting, it was  adapted to the finest micrometrical work, and thus offered unprecedented  facilities both for the examination of double stars (in which Struve  chiefly employed it), and for such subtle measurements as might serve to  reveal or disprove the existence of a sensible stellar parallax.  Fraunhofer, moreover, constructed for the observatory at Koenigsberg the  first really available heliometer. The principle of this instrument  (termed with more propriety a \"divided object-glass micrometer\") is the  separation, by a strictly measurable amount, of two distinct images of  the same object. If a double star, for instance, be under examination,  the two half-lenses into which the object-glass is divided are shifted  until the upper star (say) in one image is brought into coincidence with  the lower star in the other, when their distance apart becomes known by  the amount of motion employed.[68]    This virtually new engine of research was delivered and mounted in 1829,  three years after the termination of the life of its deviser. The Dorpat  lens had brought to Fraunhofer a title of nobility and the sole  management of the Munich Optical Institute (completely separated since  1814 from the mechanical department). What he had achieved, however, was  but a small part of what he meant to achieve. He saw before him the  possibility of nearly quadrupling the light-gathering capacity of the  great achromatic acquired by Struve; he meditated improvements in  reflectors as important as those he had already effected in refractors;  and was besides eagerly occupied with investigations into the nature of  light, the momentous character of which we shall by-and-by have an  opportunity of estimating. But his health was impaired, it is said, from  the weakening effects of his early accident, combined with excessive and  unwholesome toil, and, still hoping for its restoration from a projected  journey to Italy, he died of consumption, June 7, 1826, aged thirty-nine  years. His tomb in Munich bears the concise eulogy, _Approximavit  sidera_.    Bessel had no sooner made himself acquainted with the exquisite defining  powers of the Koenigsberg heliometer, than he resolved to employ them in  an attack upon the now secular problem of star-distances. But it was not  until 1837 that he found leisure to pursue the inquiry. In choosing his  test-star he adopted a new principle. It had hitherto been assumed that  our nearest neighbours in space must be found among the brightest  ornaments of our skies. The knowledge of stellar proper motions afforded  by the critical comparison of recent with earlier star-places, suggested  a different criterion of distance. It is impossible to escape from the  conclusion that the apparently swiftest-moving stars are, _on the  whole_, also the nearest to us, however numerous the individual  exceptions to the rule. Now, as early as 1792,[69] Piazzi had noted as  an indication of relative vicinity to the earth, the unusually large  proper motion (5.2\" annually) of a double star of the fifth magnitude in  the constellation of the Swan. Still more emphatically in 1812[70]  Bessel drew the attention of astronomers to the fact, and 61 Cygni  became known as the \"flying star.\" The _seeming_ rate of its flight,  indeed, is of so leisurely a kind, that in a thousand years it will have  shifted its place by less than 3-1/2 lunar diameters, and that a quarter  of a million would be required to carry it round the entire circuit of  the visible heavens. Nevertheless, it has few rivals in rapidity of  movement, the apparent displacement of the vast majority of stars being,  by comparison, almost insensible.    This interesting, though inconspicuous object, then, was chosen by  Bessel to be put to the question with his heliometer, while Struve made  a similar and somewhat earlier trial with the bright gem of the Lyre,  whose Arabic title of the \"Falling Eagle\" survives as a time-worn  remnant in \"Vega.\" Both astronomers agreed to use the \"differential\"  method, for which their instruments and the vicinity to their selected  stars of minute, physically detached companions offered special  facilities. In the last month of 1838 Bessel made known the result of  one year's observations, showing for 61 Cygni a parallax of about a  third of a second (0.3136\").[71] He then had his heliometer taken down  and repaired, after which he resumed the inquiry, and finally terminated  a series of 402 measures in March 1840.[72] The resulting parallax of  0.3483\" (corresponding to a distance about 600,000 times that of the  earth from the sun), seemed to be ascertained beyond the possibility of  cavil, and is memorable as the first _published_ instance of the  fathom-line, so industriously thrown into celestial space, having really  and indubitably _touched bottom_. It was confirmed in 1842-43 with  curious exactness by C. A. F. Peters at Pulkowa; but later researches  showed that it required increase to nearly half a second.[73]    Struve's measurements inspired less confidence. They extended over three  years (1835-38), but were comparatively few, and were frequently  interrupted. The parallax, accordingly, of about a quarter of a second  (0.2613\") which he derived from them for Alpha Lyrae, and announced  in 1840,[74] has proved considerably too large.[75]    Meanwhile a result of the same kind, but of a more striking character  than either Bessel's or Struve's, had been obtained, one might almost  say casually, by a different method and in a distant region. Thomas  Henderson, originally an attorney's clerk in his native town of Dundee,  had become known for his astronomical attainments, and was appointed in  1831 to direct the recently completed observatory at the Cape of Good  Hope. He began observing in April, 1832, and, the serious shortcomings  of his instrument notwithstanding, executed during the thirteen months  of his tenure of office a surprising amount of first-rate work. With a  view to correcting the declination of the lustrous double star Alpha  Centauri (which ranks after Sirius and Canopus as the third brightest  orb in the heavens), he effected a number of successive determinations  of its position, and on being informed of its very considerable proper  motion (3.6\" annually), he resolved to examine the observations already  made for possible traces of parallactic displacement. This was done on  his return to Scotland, where he filled the office of Astronomer Royal  from 1834 until his premature death in 1844. The result justified his  expectations. From the declination measurements made at the Cape and  duly reduced, a parallax of about one second of arc clearly emerged  (diminished by Gill's and Elkin's observations, 1882-1883, to O.75\");  but, by perhaps an excess of caution, was withheld from publication  until fuller certainty was afforded by the concurrent testimony of  Lieutenant Meadows's determinations of the same star's right  ascension.[76] When at last, January 9, 1839, Henderson communicated his  discovery to the Astronomical Society, he could no longer claim the  priority which was his due. Bessel had anticipated him with the parallax  of 61 Cygni by just two months.    Thus from three different quarters, three successful and almost  simultaneous assaults were delivered upon a long-beleaguered citadel of  celestial secrets. The same work has since been steadily pursued, with  the general result of showing that, as regards their overwhelming  majority, the stars are far too remote to show even the slightest trace  of optical shifting from the revolution of the earth in its orbit. In  nearly a hundred cases, however, small parallaxes have been determined,  some certainly (that is, within moderate limits of error), others more  or less precariously. The list is an instructive one, in its omissions  no less than in its contents. It includes stars of many degrees of  brightness, from Sirius down to a nameless telescopic star in the Great  Bear;[77] yet the vicinity to the earth of this minute object is so much  greater than that of the brilliant Vega, that the latter transported to  its place would increase in lustre thirty-eight times. Moreover, many of  the brightest stars are found to have no sensible parallax, while the  majority of those ascertained to be nearest to the earth are of fifth,  sixth, even ninth magnitudes. The obvious conclusions follow that the  range of variety in the sidereal system is enormously greater than"]]]
