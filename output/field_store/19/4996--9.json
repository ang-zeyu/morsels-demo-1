The two sacks  of grain were soon consumed; the feeble efforts at building a ship  had come to nothing.  But rather than stay longer the colonists  resolved to crowd into the two small vessels they had, and sail  homeward if only they could gather food enough for the voyage.  But  where to get that food none knew.    One day full of troubled, anxious thoughts Laudonnière climbed  the hill and looked seaward.  Suddenly he saw something which made  his heart beat fast, and brought the colour to his wasted cheeks.  A great ship, its sails gleaming white in the sunlight was making  for the mouth of the river.  As he gazed another and still another  ship hove in sight.  Thrilling with excitement Laudonnière sent  a messenger down to the fort with all speed to tell the news, and  when they heard it the men who had seemed scarce able to crawl arose  and danced for joy.  They laughed, and wept, and cried aloud, till  it seemed as if joy had bereft them of their wits.    But soon fear mingled with their joy.  There was something not  altogether familiar about the cut and rig of the ships.  Were they  really the long-looked-for ships from France, or did they belong  to their deadly and hated enemies, the Spaniards? They were neither  one nor the other.  That little fleet was English, under command  of the famous admiral, John Hawkins, in search of fresh water of  which they stood much in need.  The English Admiral at once showed  himself friendly.  To prove that he came with no evil intent he  landed with many of his officers gaily clad, and wearing no arms.  The famine-stricken colonists hailed him with delight, for it seemed  to them that he came as a deliverer.    Gravely and kindly Hawkins listened to the tale of misery, yet he  was glad enough when he heard that the Frenchmen had decided to  leave Florida, for he wanted to claim it for Queen Elizabeth and  England.  When, however, he saw the ships in which they meant to  sail homewards he shook his head. \"It was not possible,\" he said,  \"for so many souls to cross the broad Atlantic in those tiny  barques.\" So he offered to give all the Frenchmen a free passage  to France in his own ships.  This Laudonnière refused.  Then Hawkins  offered to lend him, or sell him, one of his ships.  Even this  kindness Laudonnière hesitated to accept.    Thereupon there arose a great uproar among the colonists, they  crowded round him clamouring to be gone, threatening that if he  refused the Englishman's offer they would accept it and sail without  him.    So Laudonnière yielded.  He told Hawkins that he would buy the  ship he offered, but he had no money.  The Englishman, however, was  generous.  Instead of money he took the cannon and other things now  useless to the colonists.  He provided them with food enough for  the voyage, and seeing many of the men ragged and barefoot, added  among other things fifty pairs of shoes.    Then with kindly good wishes Hawkins said farewell and sailed away,  leaving behind him many grateful hearts.  As soon as he was gone  the Frenchmen began to prepare to depart also.  In a few days all  was ready, and they only waited for a fair wind in order to set  sail.  But as they waited, one day, the fort was again thrown into  a state of excitement by the appearance of another fleet of ships.  Again the question was asked, were they friends or foes, Spaniards  or Frenchmen? At length, after hours of sickening suspense, the  question was answered, they were Frenchmen under the command of  Ribaut.    The long-looked-for help had come at last.  It had come when it was  no longer looked for, when it was indeed unwelcome to many.  For  the colonists had grown utterly weary of that sunlit cruel land,  and they only longed to go home.  France with any amount of tyranny  was to be preferred before the freedom and the misery of Florida.    But to abandon the colony was now impossible, for besides supplies  of food the French ships had brought many new colonists.  This  time, too, the men had not come alone but had brought their wives  and families with them.  Soon the fort which had been so silent and  mournful was filled with sounds of talk and laughter.  Again, the  noise of hatchet and hammer resounded through the woods, and the  little forsaken corner of the world awoke once more to life.    __________            Chapter 9 - How the Spaniards Drove the French Out of Florida          Scarcely a week had passed before the new peace and happiness of  the French colony was brought to a cruel end.    Late one night the men on board the French ships saw a great black  hulk loom silently up out of the darkness.  It was followed by  another and another.  No word was spoken, and in eerie silence the  strange ships crept stealthily onwards, and cast anchor beside the  French.  The stillness grew terrible.  At length it was broken by a  trumpet call from the deck of one of the silent new-comers.    Then a voice came through the darkness. \"Gentlemen,\" it asked,  \"whence does this fleet come?\"    \"From France,\" was the reply.    \"What are you doing here?\" was the next question.    \"We are bringing soldiers and supplies for a fort which the King of  France has in this country, and for many which he soon will have.\"    \"Are you Catholics or Lutherans?\"    The question came sharply across the dark water.  It was answered  by many voices.    \"We are Lutherans,\" cried the French, \"we are of the new religion.\"    Then it was the Frenchmen's turn to ask questions.    \"Who are you,\" I they cried, \"and whence come ye?\"    \"I am Pedro Menendez,\" replied the voice out of the darkness. \"I  am Admiral of the fleet of the King of Spain.  And I am come into  this country to hang and behead all Lutherans whom I may find by  land or by sea.  And my King has given me such strict commands that  I have power to pardon no man of them.  And those commands I shall  obey to the letter, as you will see.  At dawn I shall come aboard  your ship.  And if there I find any Catholic he shall be well-treated,  but every heretic shall die.\"    In reply to this speech a shout of wrath went up from the Frenchmen.    \"If You are a brave man,\" they cried, \"why wait for dawn? Come on  now, and see what you will get.\"    Then in their anger they heaped insults upon the Spaniards, and  poured forth torrents of scoffing words.  Thereupon Menendez was  so enraged that he swore to silence those Lutheran dogs once and  for ever.  So the order was given, and his great ship slowly moved  towards the French.    The threats of the French had been but idle boasting; they could not  withstand the Spaniards, for their leader was ashore with most of  his soldiers.  So cutting their cables they fled out to sea pursued  by the foe.    There was a mad chase through the darkness.  But the heretic devils,  as the Spaniards called them, were skilful sailors.  Menendez could  not catch them, and when day dawned he gave up the chase and moodily  turned back to Fort Caroline.    Here he found the French ready for him, and they seemed so strong  that he would not attack, but sailed away southwards until he  reached the river of Dolphins.    Here Menendez landed and took possession of the country in the  name of the King of Spain.  While cannon boomed and trumpets blew  he stepped on shore followed by his officers and gentlemen.  In  all the gay trappings of knighthood, with many-coloured banners  fluttering in the breeze, they marched.  Then as they advanced another  procession came toward them.  At the head of it was a priest in all  the pomp and splendour of his priestly robes.  He carried a gilded  crucifix in his hand, and as he marched he sang a Te Deum.    When the two processions met Menendez and all his company knelt,  and baring their heads kissed the crucifix.  So was the land claimed  for Spain and the Catholic faith, and St.  Augustine, the oldest  town in the United States, was founded.    Meanwhile, the fleeing French ships had turned, followed the Spaniards,  and seen them land.  Then they went back to Fort Caroline with the  news.    While these things had been happening Laudonnière had been very  ill.  He was still in bed when Ribaut, followed by several of his  chief officers, came to his room to tell him the news which the  returning ships had just brought.  And beside his sickbed they held  a council of war.  It was decided to attack the Spaniards and drive  them from the land.  But how?    First one plan and then another was discussed, and to each some  one objected.  But at length it was decided to go by sea and attack  the Spaniards suddenly in their newly-founded fort.    So almost every man who could hold a gun set forth with Ribaut,  and Laudonnière was left in the fort with the feeble and sick, and  scarcely a man besides who had ever drawn a sword or fired a shot.  Their leader was as sick and feeble as any of them.  But he dragged  himself from his bed to review his forces.  They were poor indeed,  but Laudonnière made the best of them.  He appointed each man to a  certain duty, he set a, watch night and day, and he began to repair  the broken-down walls of the fort, so that they would be able to  make some show of resistance in ease of attack.    While Laudonnière was thus ordering his poor little garrison  the ships carrying the rest of the colonists sailed on their way.  The wind was fair, and in the night they crept close to where the  Spanish vessels lay.    But when day dawned and the Spaniards saw the French vessels close  to them they fled to the shelter of their harbour.  And a sudden  storm arising the French were driven out to sea again.    As Menendez watched them from the shore he rejoiced.  He knew by  the number of the ships that most of the French colonists must be  in them, and he hoped that they would all be lost in the storm.    Then as he watched a sudden thought came to him.
