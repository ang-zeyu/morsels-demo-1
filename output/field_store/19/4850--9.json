[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28540"],[0,"Bibliomania; or Book-Madness (#12)"],[1,"on the       last day were sold all the English books in the       _black-letter_. Some of these are rather curious.         Of CONSUL SMITH I am unable to present the lover of VIRTU       with any particulars more acceptable than the following.       Pasquali (whose Latin preface is curious enough--abounding       with as many interrogatories as Hamlet's soliloquies) has       told us that \"as the Consul himself was distinguished for       his politeness, talents, and prudence, so was his house for       splendid and elegant decorations. You might there view, says       he, the most beautifully painted pictures, and exquisite       ornaments, whether gems, vases, or engravings. In short, the       whole furniture was so brilliant and classical that you       admired at once the magnificence and judgment of the owner.\"       He tells us, a little further, that he had frequently       solicited the Consul to print a catalogue of his books;       which proposition his modesty at first induced him to       reject; but, afterwards, his liberality, to comply with. He       then observes that, \"in the compilation of the catalogue, he       has studied brevity as much as it was consistent with       perspicuity; and that he was once desirous of stating the       _value_ and _price_ of the books, but was dissuaded from it       by the advice of the more experienced, and by the singular       modesty of the Collector.\"         It must be confessed that Pasquali has executed his task       well, and that the catalogue ranks among the most valuable,       as well as rare, books of the kind.]         [Footnote 44: \"BIBLIOTHECA WESTIANA; A catalogue of the       curious and truly valuable library of the late James West,       Esq., President of the Royal Society, deceased, &c.

ALBANS SCHOOLMASTE [Transcriber's Note:       Schoolmaster], WYNKYN DE WORDE, PYNSON, and the rest of the       old English typographers. Digested by Samuel Paterson,\"       1773, 8vo.         ANALYSIS OF THE CATALOGUE.         1. _Volumes of Miscellaneous Tracts._         These volumes extend from No. 148 to 200, from 915 to       992, from 1201 to 1330, and from No. 1401 to 1480.         2. _Divinity._         In the whole, 560 articles; probably about 1200 volumes;       some of them exceedingly scarce and valuable.         3. _Education, Languages, Criticism, Classics, Dictionaries,       Catalogues of Libraries, &c._         There were about 700 volumes in these departments. The       catalogues of English books, from that of Maunsell, in 1595,       to the latest before Mr. West's time, were very complete.       The treatises on education and translations of the ancient       classics comprehended a curious and uncommon collection. The       Greek and Latin classics were rather select than rare.         4. _English Poetry, Romance, and Miscellanies._         This interesting part of the collection comprehended about       355 articles, or probably about 750 volumes: and if the       singularly rare and curious books which may be found _under       these heads alone_ were now concentrated in one library, the       owner of them might safely demand 4000 guineas for such a       treasure.         5. _Philosophy, Mathematics, Inventions, Agriculture and       Horticulture, Medicine, Cookery, Surgery, etc._         Two hundred and forty articles, or about 560 volumes.         6. _Chemistry, Natural History, Astrology, Sorcery,       Gigantology._         Probably not more than 100 volumes.         7. _History and Antiquities._         This comprehended a great number of curious and valuable       productions, relating both to foreign and domestic       transactions.         8. _Heraldry and Genealogy._         A great number of curious and scarce articles may be found       under these heads.         9. _Ancient Legends and Chronicles._         To the English antiquary, few departments of literature are       more interesting that these. Mr. West seems to have paid       particular attention to them, and to have enriched his       library with many articles of this description, of the       rarest occurrence. The lovers of Caxton, Fabian, Hardyng,       Hall, Grafton, and Holinshed, may be highly gratified by       inspecting the various editions of these old chroniclers. I       entreat the diligent bibliographer to examine the first       eight articles of page 209 of the catalogue. Alas, when will       all these again come under the hammer at one sale?!         10. _Topography._         Even to a veteran, like the late Mr. GOUGH, such a       collection as may be found from p. 217 to p. 239 of this       catalogue, would be considered a first-rate acquisition. I       am aware that the gothic wainscot, and stained glass       windows, of _Enfield Study_ enshrined a still more exquisite       topographical collection! But we are improved since the days       of Mr. West; and every body knows to _whom_ these       improvements are, in a great measure, to be attributed. When       I call to mind the author of '_British Topography_' and       '_Sepulchral Monuments_,' I am not insensible to the taste,       diligence, and erudition of the \"par nobile fratrum,\" who       have gratified us with the '_Environs of London_,' '_Roman       Remains_,' and the first two volumes of '_Magna Britannia_!'         The preceding is to be considered as a very general, and       therefore superficial, analysis of the catalogue of Mr.       West's library; copies of it, with the sums for which the       books were sold, are now found with difficulty, and bring a       considerable price. I never saw or heard of one on LARGE       PAPER!]         [Footnote 45: \"A catalogue of rare books and tracts in       various languages and faculties; including the _Ancient       Conventual Library_ of Missenden-Abbey, in Buckinghamshire;       together with some choice remains of that of the late       eminent Serjeant at law, WILLIAM FLETEWODE, Esq., Recorder       of London, in the Reign of Queen Elizabeth; among which are       several specimens of the earliest Typography, foreign and       English, including CAXTON, WYNKYN DE WORDE, PYNSON, and       others; a fine collection of English Poetry, some scarce old       law-books, a great number of old English plays, several       choice MSS. upon vellum, and other subjects of literary       curiosity.

The name and collection of Dr. ASKEW are so well       known in the bibliographical world that the reader need not       be detained with laboured commendations on either: in the       present place, however, it would be a cruel disappointment       not to say a word or two by way of _preface_ or _prologue_.         Dr. ANTHONY ASKEW had eminently distinguished himself by a       refined taste, a sound knowledge, and an indefatigable       research relating to every thing connected with Grecian and       Roman literature. It was to be expected, even during his       life, as he was possessed of sufficient means to gratify       himself with what was rare, curious, and beautiful in       literature and the fine arts, that the public would, one       day, be benefited by such pursuits: especially as he had       expressed a wish that his treasures might be unreservedly       submitted to sale,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28553"],[0,"How it Works (#12)"],[1,"back to the other pole.    [Illustration: FIG. 51.--Electro-magnet: A, armature; B, battery.]    Having now considered electricity in three of its forms--static,  current, and rotatory--we will pass to some of its applications.      THE ELECTRIC BELL.    A fit device to begin with is the Electric Bell, which has so largely  replaced wire-pulled bells. These last cause a great deal of trouble  sometimes, since if a wire snaps it may be necessary to take up carpets  and floor-boards to put things right. Their installation is not simple,  for at every corner must be put a crank to alter the direction of the  pull, and the cranks mean increased friction. But when electric wires  have once been properly installed, there should be no need for touching  them for an indefinite period. They can be taken round as many corners  as you wish without losing any of their conductivity, and be placed  wherever is most convenient for examination. One bell may serve a large  number of rooms if an _indicator_ be used to show where the call was  made from, by a card appearing in one of a number of small windows.  Before answering a call, the attendant presses in a button to return the  card to its normal position.    In Fig. 52 we have a diagrammatic view of an electric bell and current.  When the bell-push is pressed in, current flows from the battery to  terminal T^1, round the electro-magnet M, through the pillar P and  flat steel springs S and B, through the platinum-pointed screw, and back  to the battery through the push. The circulation of current magnetizes  M, which attracts the iron armature A attached to the spring S, and  draws the hammer H towards the gong. Just before the stroke occurs, the  spring B leaves the tip of the screw, and the circuit is broken, so that  the magnet no longer attracts. H is carried by its momentum against the  gong, and is withdrawn by the spring, until B once more makes contact,  and the magnet is re-excited. The hammer vibrations recur many times a  second as long as the push is pressed in.    [Illustration: FIG. 52.--Sketch of an electric-bell circuit.]    The electric bell is used for so many purposes that they cannot all be  noted. It plays an especially important part in telephonic installations  to draw the attention of the subscribers, forms an item in automatic  fire and burglar alarms, and is a necessary adjunct of railway  signalling cabins.      THE INDUCTION OR RUHMKORFF COIL.    Reference was made in connection with the electrical ignition of  internal-combustion engines (p. 101) to the _induction coil_. This is a  device for increasing the _voltage_, or pressure, of a current. The  two-cell accumulator carried in a motor car gives a voltage (otherwise  called electro-motive force = E.M.F.) of 4.4 volts. If you attach a wire  to one terminal of the accumulator and brush the loose end rapidly  across the other terminal, you will notice that a bright spark passes  between the wire and the terminal. In reality there are two sparks, one  when they touch, and another when they separate, but they occur so  closely together that the eye cannot separate the two impressions. A  spark of this kind would not be sufficiently hot to ignite a charge in a  motor cylinder, and a spark from the induction coil is therefore used.    [Illustration: FIG. 53.--Sketch of an induction coil.]    We give a sketch of the induction coil in Fig. 53. It consists of a core  of soft iron wires round which is wound a layer of coarse insulated  wire, denoted by the thick line. One end of the winding of this  _primary_ coil is attached to the battery, the other to the base of a  hammer, H, vibrating between the end of the core and a screw, S, passing  through an upright, T, connected with the other terminal of the battery.  The action of the hammer is precisely the same as that of the armature  of an electric bell. Outside the primary coil are wound many turns of a  much finer wire completely insulated from the primary coil. The ends of  this _secondary_ coil are attached to the objects (in the case of a  motor car, the insulated wire of the sparking-plug and a wire projecting  from its outer iron casing) between which a spark has to pass. As soon  as H touches S the circuit is completed. The core becomes a powerful  magnet with external lines of force passing from one pole to the other  over and among the turns of the secondary coil. H is almost  instantaneously attracted by the core, and the break occurs. The lines  of force now (at least so it is supposed) sink into the core, cutting  through the turns of the \"secondary,\" and causing a powerful current to  flow through them. The greater the number of turns, the greater the  number of times the lines of force are cut, and the stronger is the  current. If sufficiently intense, it jumps any gap in the secondary  circuit, heating the intermediate air to a state of incandescence.      THE CONDENSER.    The sudden parting of H and S would produce strong sparking across the  gap between them if it were not for the condenser, which consists of a  number of tinfoil sheets separated by layers of paraffined paper. All  the \"odd\" sheets are connected with T, all the \"even\" with T^1. Now,  the more rapid the extinction of magnetism in the core after \"break\" of  the primary circuit, the more rapidly will the lines of force collapse,  and the more intense will be the induced current in the secondary coil.  The condenser diminishes the period of extinction very greatly, while  lengthening the period of magnetization after the \"make\" of the primary  current, and so decreasing the strength of the reverse current.      TRANSFORMATION OF CURRENT.    The difference in the voltage of the primary and secondary currents  depends on the length of the windings. If there are 100 turns of wire in  the primary, and 100,000 turns in the secondary, the voltage will be  increased 1,000 times; so that a 4-volt current is \"stepped up\" to 4,000  volts. In the largest induction coils the secondary winding absorbs  200-300 miles of wire, and the spark given may be anything up to four  feet in length. Such a spark would pierce a glass plate two inches  thick.    It must not be supposed that an induction coil increases the _amount_ of  current given off by a battery. It merely increases its pressure at the  expense of its volume--stores up its energy, as it were, until there is  enough to do what a low-tension flow could not effect. A fair comparison  would be to picture the energy of the low-tension current as the  momentum of a number of small pebbles thrown in succession at a door,  say 100 a minute. If you went on pelting the door for hours you might  make no impression on it, but if you could knead every 100 pebbles into  a single stone, and throw these stones one per minute, you would soon  break the door in.    Any intermittent current can be transformed as regards its intensity.  You may either increase its pressure while decreasing its rate of flow,  or _amperage_; or decrease its pressure and increase its flow. In the  case that we have considered, a continuous battery current is rendered  intermittent by a mechanical contrivance. But if the current comes from  an \"alternating\" dynamo--that is, is already intermittent--the  contact-breaker is not needed. There will be more to say about  transformation of current in later paragraphs.      USES OF THE INDUCTION COIL.    The induction coil is used--(1.) For passing currents through glass  tubes almost exhausted of air or containing highly rarefied gases. The  luminous effects of these \"Geissler\" tubes are very beautiful. (2.) For  producing the now famous X or Roentgen rays. These rays accompany the  light rays given off at the negative terminal (cathode) of a vacuum  tube, and are invisible to the eye unless caught on a fluorescent  screen, which reduces their rate of vibration sufficiently for the eye  to be sensitive to them. The Roentgen rays have the peculiar property of  penetrating many substances quite opaque to light, such as metals,  stone, wood, etc., and as a consequence have proved of great use to the  surgeon in localizing or determining the nature of an internal injury.  They also have a deterrent effect upon cancerous growths. (3.) In  wireless telegraphy, to cause powerful electric oscillations in the  ether. (4.) On motor cars, for igniting the cylinder charges. (5.) For  electrical massage of the body.      [11] \"What is Electricity?\" p. 46.    [12] If a magnetized bar be heated to white heat and tapped with a  hammer it loses its magnetism, because the distance between the  molecules has increased, and the molecules can easily return to their  original positions.

Needle instruments--Influence of current on the magnetic       needle--Method of reversing the current--Sounding       instruments--Telegraphic relays--Recording telegraphs--High-speed       telegraphy.      Take a small pocket compass and wind several turns of fine insulated  wire round the case, over the top and under the bottom. Now lay the  compass on a table, and turn it about until the coil is on a line with  the needle--in fact, covers it. Next touch the terminals of a battery  with the ends of the wire. The needle at once shifts either to right or  left, and remains in that position as long as the current flows. If you  change the wires over, so reversing the direction of the current, the  needle at once points in the other direction. It is to this conduct on  the part of a magnetic needle when in a \"magnetic field\" that we owe the  existence of the needle telegraph instrument.      NEEDLE INSTRUMENTS.    [Illustration: FIG. 54.--Sketch of the side elevation of a Wheatstone  needle instrument.]    Probably the best-known needle instrument is the Cooke-Wheatstone,  largely used in signal-boxes and in some post-offices. A vertical  section of it is shown in Fig. 54. It consists of a base, B, and "]]]
