[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2849"],[0,"Against Apion (#12)"],[1," have been read  to so little purpose by many learned critics; viz. that their main aim  has not been chronology or history, but philology, to know words, and  not things, they not much entering oftentimes into the real contents of  their authors, and judging which were the most accurate discoverers of  truth, and most to be depended on in the several histories, but rather  inquiring who wrote the finest style, and had the greatest elegance in  their expressions; which are things of small consequence in comparison  of the other. Thus you will sometimes find great debates among the  learned, whether Herodotus or Thucydides were the finest historian in  the Ionic and Attic ways of writing; which signify little as to the real  value of each of their histories; while it would be of much more moment  to let the reader know, that as the consequence of Herodotus's history,  which begins so much earlier, and reaches so much wider, than that  of Thucydides, is therefore vastly greater; so is the most part of  Thucydides, which belongs to his own times, and fell under his own  observation, much the most certain.    [7] Of this accuracy of the Jews before and in our Savior's time, in  carefully preserving their genealogies all along, particularly those of  the priests, see Josephus's Life, sect. 1. This accuracy. seems to have  ended at the destruction of Jerusalem by Titus, or, however, at that by  Adrian.    [8] Which were these twenty-two sacred books of the Old Testament, see  the Supplement to the Essay of the Old Testament, p. 25-29, viz. those  we call canonical, all excepting the Canticles; but still with this  further exception, that the book of apocryphal Esdras be taken into that  number instead of our canonical Ezra, which seems to be no more than a  later epitome of the other; which two books of Canticles and Ezra it no  way appears that our Josephus ever saw.    [9] Here we have an account of the first building of the city of  Jerusalem, according to Manetho, when the Phoenician shepherds were  expelled out of Egypt about thirty-seven years before Abraham came out  of Harsh.    [10] Genesis 46;32, 34; 47:3, 4.    [11] In our copies of the book of Genesis and of Joseph, this Joseph  never calls himself \"a captive,\" when he was with the king of Egypt,  though he does call himself \"a servant,\" \"a slave,\" or \"captive,\" many  times in the Testament of the Twelve Patriarchs, under Joseph, sect. 1,  11, 13-16.    [12] Of this Egyptian chronology of Manetho, as mistaken by Josephus,  and of these Phoenician shepherds, as falsely supposed by him, and  others after him, to have been the Israelites in Egypt, see Essay on the  Old Testament, Appendix, p. 182-188. And note here, that when Josephus  tells us that the Greeks or Argives looked on this Danaus as \"a most  ancient,\" or \"the most ancient,\" king of Argos, he need not be supposed  to mean, in the strictest sense, that they had no one king so ancient as  he; for it is certain that they owned nine kings before him, and Inachus  at the head of them. See Authentic Records, Part II. p. 983, as Josephus  could not but know very well; but that he was esteemed as very ancient  by them, and that they knew they had been first of all denominated  \"Danai\" from this very ancient king Danaus. Nor does this superlative  degree always imply the \"most ancient\" of all without exception, but is  sometimes to be rendered \"very ancient\" only, as is the case in the like  superlative degrees of other words also.    [13] Authentic Records, Part II. p. 983, as Josephus could not but know  very well; but that he was esteemed as very ancient by them, and that  they knew they had been first of all denominated \"Danai\" from this very  ancient king Danaus. Nor does this superlative degree always imply the  \"most ancient\" of all without exception, but is sometimes to be rendered  \"very ancient\" only, as is the case in the like superlative degrees of  other words also.    [14] This number in Josephus, that Nebuchadnezzar destroyed the temple  in the eighteenth year of his reign, is a mistake in the nicety of  chronology; for it was in the nineteenth. The true number here for the  year of Darius, in which the second temple was finished, whether the  second with our present copies, or the sixth with that of Syncellus,  or the tenth with that of Eusebius, is very uncertain; so we had best  follow Josephus's own account elsewhere, Antiq.;B. XI. ch. 3. sect. 4,  which shows us that according to his copy of the Old Testament, after  the second of Cyrus, that work was interrupted till the second of  Darius, when in seven years it was finished in the ninth of Darius.    [15] This is a thing well known by the learned, that we are not secure  that we have any genuine writings of Pythagoras; those Golden Verses,  which are his best remains, being generally supposed to have been  written not by himself, but by some of his scholars only, in agreement  with what Josephus here affirms of him.    [16] Whether these verses of Cherilus, the heathen poet, in the days of  Xerxes, belong to the Solymi in Pisidia, that were near a small lake, or  to the Jews that dwelt on the Solymean or Jerusalem mountains, near the  great and broad lake Asphaltitis, that were a strange people, and  spake the Phoenician tongue, is not agreed on by the learned. If is yet  certain that Josephus here, and Eusebius, Prep. IX. 9. p. 412, took them  to be Jews; and I confess I cannot but very much incline to the same  opinion. The other Solymi were not a strange people, but heathen  idolaters, like the other parts of Xerxes's army; and that these spake  the Phoenician tongue is next to impossible, as the Jews certainly  did; nor is there the least evidence for it elsewhere. Nor was the  lake adjoining to the mountains of the Solvmi at all large or broad,  in comparison of the Jewish lake Asphaltitis; nor indeed were these so  considerable a people as the Jews, nor so likely to be desired by Xerxes  for his army as the Jews, to whom he was always very favorable. As for  the rest of Cherilus's description, that \"their heads were sooty; that  they had round rasures on their heads; that their heads and faces were  like nasty horse-heads, which had been hardened in the smoke;\" these  awkward characters probably fitted the Solymi of Pisidi no better than  they did the Jews in Judea. And indeed this reproachful language, here  given these people, is to me a strong indication that they were the poor  despicable Jews, and not the Pisidian Solymi celebrated in Homer, whom  Cherilus here describes; nor are we to expect that either Cherilus or  Hecateus, or any other pagan writers cited by Josephus and Eusebius,  made no mistakes in the Jewish history. If by comparing their  testimonies with the more authentic records of that nation we find them  for the main to confirm the same, as we almost always do, we ought to be  satisfied, and not expect that they ever had an exact knowledge of all  the circumstances of the Jewish affairs, which indeed it was almost  always impossible for them to have. See sect. 23.    [17] This Hezekiah, who is here called a high priest, is not named in  Josephus's catalogue; the real high priest at that time being rather  Onias, as Archbishop Usher supposes. However, Josephus often uses the  word high priests in the plural number, as living many at the same time.  See the note on Antiq. B. XX. ch. 8. sect. 8.    [18] So I read the text with Havercamp, though the place be difficult.    [19] This number of arourae or Egyptian acres, 3,000,000, each aroura  containing a square of 100 Egyptian cubits, [being about three quarters  of an English acre, and just twice the area of the court of the Jewish  tabernacle,] as contained in the country of Judea, will be about one  third of the entire number of arourae in the whole land of Judea,  supposing it 160 measured miles long and 70 such miles broad; which  estimation, for the fruitful parts of it, as perhaps here in Hecateus,  is not therefore very wide from the truth. The fifty furlongs in compass  for the city Jerusalem presently are not very wide from the truth also,  as Josephus himself describes it, who, Of the War, B. V. ch. 4. sect. 3.  makes its wall thirty-three furlongs, besides the suburbs and gardens;  nay, he says, B. V. ch. 12. sect. 2, that Titus's wall about it at some  small distance, after the gardens and suburbs were destroyed, was  not less than thirty-nine furlongs. Nor perhaps were its constant  inhabitants, in the days of Hecateus, many more than these 120,000,  because room was always to be left for vastly greater numbers which came  up at the three great festivals; to say nothing of the probable increase  in their number between the days of Hecateus and Josephus, which was at  least three hundred years. But see a more authentic account of some of  these measures in my Description of the Jewish Temples. However, we are  not to expect that such heathens as Cherilus or Hecateus, or the  rest that are cited by Josephus and Eusebius, could avoid making many  mistakes in the Jewish history, while yet they strongly confirm the same  history in the general, and are most valuable attestations to those more  authentic accounts we have in the Scriptures and Josephus concerning  them.    [20] A glorious testimony this of the observation of the sabbath by the  Jews. See Antiq. B. XVI. ch. 2. sect. 4, and ch. 6. sect. 2; the Life,  sect. 54; and War, B. IV. ch. 9. sect. 12.    [21] Not their law, but the superstitious interpretation of their  leaders which neither the Maccabees nor our blessed Savior did ever  approve of.    [22] In reading this and the remaining sections of this book, and some  parts of the next, one may easily perceive that our usually cool and  candid author, Josephus, was too highly offended with the impudent  calumnies of Manethe, and the other bitter enemies of the Jews, with  whom he had now to deal, and was thereby betrayed into a greater heat  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28491"],[0,"Dishes & Beverages of the Old South (#12)"],[1,"to swell, put in a deep kettle of boiling water, and boil for five  hours, filling up the kettle as needed with boiling water so as not to  check the cooking. Make several days beforehand, and boil an extra hour  upon Christmas day. Serve in a blaze of brandy, with a very rich sauce,  either fruit or wine flavored.    _Pudding Sauce_: (Mrs. Barbara Clayton.) Beat together until very light,  one cup white sugar, one cup creamed butter, and the yolks of three  eggs. Beat the egg whites very stiff with another cup of sugar, add to  the yolks and butter, beat hard together, then put in double boiler and  cook until thick. Put two wineglasses of good whiskey in a bowl, pour  the hot sauce upon it, and whip hard until light.          [Illustration: _Creole Cookery_]      Exotics rarely flower in native splendor after transplanting. Milly was  the exception, proving the rule. Bred in New Orleans, steeped in its  atmosphere, its traditions, a cook of degree, and daughter of a cook to  whom, though past middle age, she paid the most reverent homage, she yet  kept her magic touch amid the crush and hurly-burly of New York town,  albeit she never grew acclimated nor even content. This in spite of a  mistress she adored--in virtue of having served her ten years down in  the home city. When at last Milly went back to her own, there was  wailing amongst all of us, who had eaten her cooking, but the mistress  smiled, rather sadly, to be sure, saying: \"I could not beg her to  stay--she was so unhappy here.\"    Milly never had quite a free hand--New York markets know not many things  familiar to those of the Crescent City. Notwithstanding, she was a  liberal education in blended flavors, in the delights, the surprises of  the Creole kitchen. Tall and slim, of a golden-brown complexion, neat to  the point of austerity, trim and self-contained, sight of her somehow  gave an added piquancy to her dishes. She did not make friends readily,  but the comradery of cooking induced her to more than tolerate me. \"I  don't say I kin cook--but my mother can,\" she often told me--smiling  proudly the while, with the buzzing praises of _gourmets_ sounding in  her ears. She could never tell you how she made her ambrosial  dishes--but if you had my luck to be _persona gratis_ she could and did  show you, to the queen's taste.    I shall write only whereof I know--not by any means a compend of Creole  cookery. Indeed, a lifetime is hardly enough to eat of all its  specially excellent dishes. It seems to me from this scant experience,  one general principle runs through all. It is the blending of  proportioned flavors, achieved through long and gentle cooking. Milly  said she let things \"sob,\" a mistake I dare say, for the old-time \"sod,\"  past participle of \"seethe.\" But I by no means speak with authority--my  deduction is from the premise of fifty dinners, each it seemed to me  uniquely excellent. After this prelude come we to specific recipes.    _Court Bouillon_: (Pronounced \"Coubare.\") Milly sighed for Redfish or  Red Snapper but made shift with halibut or any other firm fine-grained  fish perfectly fresh. Take three pounds of it, wash very clean, and cut  in six equal slices with a very sharp knife. There must be no rags and  tatters. Melt a heaping tablespoonful of lard in a deep kettle, add to  it gradually two tablespoonfuls flour, stirring hard so it shall not  burn. Throw into it a dozen pounded alspice, three sprigs each of thyme,  parsley, bay leaf and sweet marjoram chopped fine, one small clove of  garlic, one large onion also chopped fine, and either six large fresh  tomatoes, chopped small, or half a can--those from glass are best. Pour  in a large glass of claret, add a quart of boiling water, and bring all  to a very brisk boil. Cook for five minutes, then add salt and Cayenne  pepper to taste. Boil five minutes longer, then lay in the fish slices  one at a time, following them with the strained juice of a lemon. Boil  hard twenty minutes longer. Serve hot.    To make _Court Bouillon a la Espagnole_, stir together as above, lard  and flour, taking care to have them smooth, add a large onion, six  tomatoes, clove of garlic, sprigs of sweet basil and thyme, all chopped  fine, along with two whole bay leaves. Brown all nicely, taking care not  to burn, then add a quart of boiling water, bring to a boil and cook two  or three minutes. Have six thick slices of fine, firm fresh fish, rub  them well over with salt and pepper, lay in a dish and pour over a large  cup of white wine boiling hot. Vinegar answers, but wine is better. Lay  the fish slices in the pot, handling carefully, add the wine, and  simmer until tender--about half an hour commonly. Take up carefully so  as not to break, lay in a deepish dish, remove bay leaves from the gravy  and pour over the fish. Finish with a garnish of sliced lemon, and serve  with either boiled rice or whole boiled potatoes.    _Bouillabaisse_: While time endures New Orleans will plume itself upon  this dish which drew from Thackeray a world-famous tribute. \"In New  Orleans you can eat a Bouillabaisse, the like of which was never eaten  in Marseilles or Paris.\" Which is much, very much, from the laureate of  Bouillabaisse, as native to Marseilles. The reason of superiority is not  far to seek--it lies in the excellence and flavor of the fish native to  the Gulf of Mexico. Lacking Pompano, Red Snapper, and Redfish, even  Milly could not quite do her knowledge justice. But she made shift with  what the market offered, choosing generally halibut, with fresh cod, or  bluefish, or sea trout. Two kinds of fish in equal quantity are  imperative. The better, finer and firmer the fish, the better the  Bouillabaisse. Cut each sort in six equal slices, saving trimmings,  heads, etc. Boil them in three pints of water, with a sliced onion, and  a bouquet of herbs, until reduced to one pint. Remove fish-heads and  herbs, then strain the stock, and set aside until needed. Meantime rub  the fish over very well with salt and pepper, then with a mixture made  by mincing very fine three bay leaves, three sprigs each of thyme and  parsley, three cloves of garlic, and six allspice pounded to powder. Rub  the mixture in well and thoroughly--here is the key to success. The  seasoning must go through and through the fish. Put into a very wide  pan, two tablespoonfuls of olive oil, heat it gently, add two mild  onions, chopped and let them cook a little without browning. Now lay in  the fish, slice by slice, so one slice does not touch another, cover the  pan, and let the slices smother for about ten minutes, turning them  once, so as to cook each side partly. Take up, lay separately in a large  dish, pour half a bottle of white wine into the pan, and stir hard. Add  six large, fresh tomatoes, sliced very thin, let boil a few minutes,  then half a lemon, also in very thin slices, and a pint of the fish  stock strained. Season well, with salt, pepper, and Cayenne--here the  palate is guide. Boil all together until reduced almost one half, then  lay in the fish slices, taking care they do not touch, and boil briskly  for five minutes. While the boiling goes on, chop fine a pinch of  saffron, put it in a small, deep dish, and mix smooth with a spoonful of  the boiling liquor. Dissolve the saffron very well, and when the fish  has cooked its allotted five minutes, spread the saffron on top of the  fish. Fry in butter as many slices of toast as you have slices of  fish--lay the fish on the toast, pour the sauce over it, and serve  immediately, very hot.    _Shrimps_: The secret of cooking shrimps is to boil them properly--that  is to say in very salt water, almost brine. They take up salt only in  the boiling, and not so much then. To five quarts of very salt water add  a large bunch of celery, chopped, roots, leaves and all, two dozen  allspice, one dozen cloves, two blades of mace, a bouquet of herbs  chopped small, a pod of red pepper, and a seasoning of Cayenne. Boil  until the strength of herbs and seasoning is extracted, then throw in a  hundred shrimps--river shrimps are best--let boil hard ten minutes, take  from fire and allow the shrimps to cool in the brine. Serve as a relish  before dinner, on a bed of cracked ice, with a garnish of parsley.    _Baked Shrimp_: Cut the eyes from a dozen large, meaty tomatoes, scoop  out the pulp, leaving the shells whole, then mix it with one hundred  shrimps boiled as directed and picked from their shells, one cup grated  bread crumbs or fine cracker crumbs, and one heaping tablespoon of  butter. Stew all together, seasoning with pepper and salt, fill the  tomato shells with the mixture, sift fine crumbs on top, dot with  butter, put in a pan, with a very little hot water in the bottom, and  bake until done in a quick but not scorching oven.    _Shrimp Pie_: Boil and pick from shells one hundred shrimps, mix well  with two large slices stale bread free of crust, moistened with two  glasses white wine, and highly seasoned with salt, pepper, Cayenne,  nutmeg, mace, chopped thyme and parsley. Crisp the bread crusts, and  grate over the mixture after it is packed in a deep dish. Dot well with  butter, and bake in a hot oven. Serve with a sauce made by cooking  together a pint of boiled shrimps, a tablespoonful of butter, five  chopped tomatoes, a little celery, thyme, parsley and bay leaf, also  chopped. Cook three to four minutes, then add half a pint of oyster  liquor, boil up, and serve very hot.    _Shrimp Salad_: Boil, and pick from shells--if large cut in half,  otherwise leave whole. Season well with salt and pepper, then mix well  with crisp celery, chopped fine with a very little onion. Heap in salad  dish, cover with a good mayonnaise, and garnish with sliced hard-boiled  eggs, sliced lemon, sliced beets, and celery tips.    _Fried Soft-Shell Crabs_: Wash always in cold water--hot water spoils  the flavor. Remove all sand, also the sand-bag between the eyes, the"]]]
