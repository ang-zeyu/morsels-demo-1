And see, here is Tommaso Pace walking in front of them to  light their way.\"    Indeed, a tall spectral figure, black from head to foot, his face  carefully hidden under a velvet mask, walked at the end of the corridor,  lamp in hand, and stopped at the first step of a staircase which led to  the upper floors. The conspirators advanced slowly, two by two, like a  procession of ghosts, appeared for one moment in the circle of light  made by the torch, and again disappeared into shadow.    \"See, there are Charles and Bertrand of Artois,\" said the notary; \"there  are the Counts of Terlizzi and Catanzaro; the grand admiral and grand  seneschal, Godfrey of Marsan, Count of Squillace, and Robert of Cabane,  Count of Eboli; the two women talking in a low voice with the eager  gesticulations are Catherine of Tarentum, Empress of Constantinople, and  Philippa the Catanese, the queen's governess and chief lady; there is  Dona Cancha, chamberwoman and confidante of Joan; and there is the  Countess of Morcone.\"    The notary stopped on beholding a shadow alone, its head bowed, with  arms hanging loosely, choking back her sobs beneath a hood of black.    \"Who is the woman who seems to drag herself so painfully along in their  train?\" asked the duke, pressing his companion's arm.    \"That woman,\" said the notary, \"is the queen.\" \"Ah, now I see,\" thought  Charles, breathing freely, with the same sort of satisfaction that Satan  no doubt feels when a long coveted soul falls at length into his power.    \"And now, my lord,\" continued Master Nicholas, when all had returned  once more into silence and darkness, \"if you have bidden me spy on these  conspirators with a view to saving the young prince you are protecting  with love and vigilance, you must hurry forward, for to-morrow maybe it  will be too late.\"    \"Follow me,\" cried the duke imperiously; \"it is time you should know my  real intention, and then carry out my orders with scrupulous exactness.\"    With these words he drew him aside to a place opposite to where the  conspirators had just disappeared. The notary mechanically followed  through a labyrinth of dark corridors and secret staircases, quite at a  loss how to account for the sudden change that had come over his  master--crossing one of the ante-chambers in the castle, they came upon  Andre, who joyfully accosted them; grasping the hand of his cousin Duras  in his affectionate manner, he asked him in a pressing way that would  brook no refusal, \"Will you be of our hunting party to-morrow, duke?\"    \"Excuse me, my lord,\" said Charles, bowing down to the ground; \"it will  be impossible for me to go to-morrow, for my wife is very unwell; but I  entreat you to accept the best falcon I have.\"    And here he cast upon the notary a petrifying glance.    The morning of the 20th of August was fine and calm--the irony of nature  contrasting cruelly with the fate of mankind. From break of day masters  and valets, pages and knights, princes and courtiers, all were on foot;  cries of joy were heard on every side when the queen arrived on a  snow-white horse, at the head of the young and brilliant throng. Joan  was perhaps paler than usual, but that might be because she had been  obliged to rise very early. Andre, mounted on one of the most fiery of  all the steeds he had tamed, galloped beside his wife, noble and proud,  happy in his own powers, his youth, and the thousand gilded hopes that a  brilliant future seemed to offer. Never had the court of Naples shown so  brave an aspect: every feeling of distrust and hatred seemed entirely  forgotten; Friar Robert himself, suspicious as he was by nature, when he  saw the joyous cavalcade go by under his window, looked out with pride,  and stroking his beard, laughed at his own seriousness.    Andre's intention was to spend several days hunting between Capua and  Aversa, and only to return to Naples when all was in readiness for his  coronation. Thus the first day they hunted round about Melito, and went  through two or three villages in the land of Labore. Towards evening the  court stopped at Aversa, with a view to passing the night there, and  since at that period there was no castle in the place worthy of  entertaining the queen with her husband and numerous court, the convent  of St. Peter's at Majella was converted into a royal residence: this  convent had been built by Charles II in the year of our Lord 1309.    While the grand seneschal was giving orders for supper and the  preparation of a room for Andre and his wife, the prince, who during the  whole day had abandoned himself entirely to his favourite amusement,  went up on the terrace to enjoy the evening air, accompanied by the good  Isolda, his beloved nurse, who loved him more even than his mother, and  would not leave his side for a moment. Never had the prince appeared so  animated and happy: he was in ecstasies over the beauty of the country,  the clear air, the scent of the trees around; he besieged his nurse with  a thousand queries, never waiting for an answer; and they were indeed  long in coming, for poor Isolda was gazing upon him with that appearance  of fascination which makes a mother absent-minded when her child is  talking: Andre was eagerly telling her about a terrible boar he had  chased that morning across the woods, how it had lain foaming at his  feet, and Isolda interrupted him to say he had a grain of dust in his  eye. Then Andre was full of his plans for the future, and Isolda stroked  his fair hair, remarking that he must be feeling very tired. Then,  heeding nothing but his own joy and excitement, the young prince hurled  defiance at destiny, calling by all his gods on dangers to come forward,  so that he might have the chance of quelling them, and the poor nurse  exclaimed, in a flood of tears, \"My child, you love me no longer.\"    Out of all patience with these constant interruptions, Andre scolded her  kindly enough, and mocked at her childish fears. Then, paying no  attention to a sort of melancholy that was coming over him, he bade her  tell him old tales of his childhood, and had a long talk about his  brother Louis, his absent mother, and tears were in his eyes when he  recalled her last farewell. Isolda listened joyfully, and answered all  he asked; but no fell presentiment shook her heart: the poor woman loved  Andre with all the strength of her soul; for him she would have given up  her life in this world and in the world to come; yet she was not his  mother.    When all was ready, Robert of Cabane came to tell the prince that the  queen awaited him; Andre cast one last look at the smiling fields  beneath the starry heavens, pressed his nurse's hand to his lips and to  his heart, and followed the grand seneschal slowly and, it seemed, with  some regret. But soon the brilliant lights of the room, the wine that  circulated freely, the gay talk, the eager recitals of that day's  exploits served to disperse the cloud of gloom that had for a moment  overspread the countenance of the prince. The queen alone, leaning on  the table with fixed eyes and lips that never moved, sat at this strange  feast pale and cold as a baleful ghost summoned from the tomb to disturb  the joy of the party. Andre, whose brain began to be affected by the  draughts of wine from Capri and Syracuse, was annoyed at his wife's  look, and attributing it to contempt, filled a goblet to the brim and  presented it to the queen. Joan visibly trembled, her lips moved  convulsively; but the conspirators drowned in their noisy talk the  involuntary groan that escaped her. In the midst of a general uproar,  Robert of Cabane proposed that they should serve generous supplies of  the same wine drunk at the royal table to the Hungarian guards who were  keeping watch at the approaches to the convent, and this liberality  evoked frenzied applause. The shouting of the soldiers soon gave witness  to their gratitude for the unexpected gift, and mingled with the  hilarious toasts of the banqueters. To put the finishing touch to  Andre's excitement, there were cries on every side of \"Long live the  Queen! Long live His Majesty the King of Naples!\"    The orgy lasted far into the night: the pleasures of the next day were  discussed with enthusiasm, and Bertrand of Artois protested in a loud  voice that if they were so late now some would not rise early on the  morrow. Andre declared that, for his part, an hour or two's rest would  be enough to get over his fatigue, and he eagerly protested that it  would be well for others to follow his example. The Count of Terlizzi  seemed to express some doubt as to the prince's punctuality. Andre  insisted, and challenging all the barons present to see who would be up  first, he retired with the queen to the room that had been reserved for  them, where he very soon fell into a deep and heavy sleep. About two  o'clock in the morning, Tommaso Pace, the prince's valet and first usher  of the royal apartments, knocked at his master's door to rouse him for  the chase. At the first knock, all was silence; at the second, Joan, who  had not closed her eyes all night, moved as if to rouse her husband and  warn him of the threatened danger; but at the third knock the  unfortunate young man suddenly awoke, and hearing in the next room  sounds of laughter and whispering, fancied that they were making a joke  of his laziness, and jumped out of bed bareheaded, in nothing but his  shirt, his shoes half on and half off. He opened the door; and at this  point we translate literally the account of Domenico Gravina, a  historian of much esteem. As soon as the prince appeared, the  conspirators all at once fell upon him, to strangle him with their  hands; believing he could not die by poison or sword, because of the  charmed ring given him by his poor mother. But Andre was so strong and  active, that when he perceived the infamous treason"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27509"],[0,"The 2006 CIA World Factbook (#12)"],[1,"with satellites.    Satellite link - a radio connection between a satellite and an earth  station permitting communication between them, either one-way (down  link from satellite to earth station - television receive-only  transmission) or two-way (telephone channels).    SHF - super high frequency; any radio frequency in the 3,000- to  30,000-MHz range.    Shortwave - radio frequencies (from 1.605 to 30 MHz) that fall above  the commercial broadcast band and are used for communication over long  distances.    Solidaridad - geosynchronous satellites in Mexico's system of  international telecommunications in the Western Hemisphere.    Statsionar - Russia's geostationary system for satellite  telecommunications.    Submarine cable - a cable designed for service under water.    TAT - Trans-Atlantic Telephone; any of a number of high-capacity  submarine coaxial telephone cables linking Europe with North America.    Telefax - facsimile service between subscriber stations via the public  switched telephone network or the international Datel network.    Telegraph - a telecommunications system designed for unmodulated  electric impulse transmission.    Telex - a communication service involving teletypewriters connected by  wire through automatic exchanges.    Tropospheric scatter - a form of microwave radio transmission in which  the troposphere is used to scatter and reflect a fraction of the  incident radio waves back to earth; powerful, highly directional  antennas are used to transmit and receive the microwave signals;  reliable over-the-horizon communications are realized for distances up  to 600 miles in a single hop; additional hops can extend the range of  this system for very long distances.    Trunk network - a network of switching centers, connected by  multichannel trunk lines.    UHF - ultra high frequency; any radio frequency in the 300- to 3,000-  MHz range.    VHF - very high frequency; any radio frequency in the 30- to 300-MHz  range.    Telephones - main lines in use    This entry gives the total number of main telephone lines in use.    Telephones - mobile cellular    This entry gives the total number of mobile cellular telephone  subscribers.    Television broadcast stations    This entry gives the total number of separate broadcast stations plus  any repeater stations.    Terminology    Due to the highly structured nature of the Factbook database, some  collective generic terms have to be used. For example, the word Country  in the Country name entry refers to a wide variety of dependencies,  areas of special sovereignty, uninhabited islands, and other entities  in addition to the traditional countries or independent states.  Military is also used as an umbrella term for various civil defense,  security, and defense activities in many entries. The Independence  entry includes the usual colonial independence dates and former ruling  states as well as other significant nationhood dates such as the  traditional founding date or the date of unification, federation,  confederation, establishment, or state succession that are not strictly  independence dates. Dependent areas have the nature of their dependency  status noted in this same entry.    Terrain    This entry contains a brief description of the topography.    Time Difference    This entry is expressed in The World Factbook in two ways. First, it is  stated as the difference in hours between the capital of an entity and  Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) during Standard Time. Additionally,  the difference in time between the capital of an entity and that  observed in Washington, D.C. is also provided. Note that the time  difference assumes both locations are simultaneously observing Standard  Time or Daylight Saving Time.    Time zones    Ten countries (Australia, Brazil, Canada, Indonesia, Kazakhstan,  Mexico, New Zealand, Russia, Spain, and the United States) and the  island of Greenland observe more than one official time depending on  the number of designated time zones within their boundaries. An  illustration of time zones throughout the world and within countries  can be seen in the Standard Time Zones of the World map included in the  Reference Maps section of The World Factbook.    Total fertility rate    This entry gives a figure for the average number of children that would  be born per woman if all women lived to the end of their childbearing  years and bore children according to a given fertility rate at each  age. The total fertility rate (TFR) is a more direct measure of the  level of fertility than the crude birth rate, since it refers to births  per woman. This indicator shows the potential for population change in  the country. A rate of two children per woman is considered the  replacement rate for a population, resulting in relative stability in  terms of total numbers. Rates above two children indicate populations  growing in size and whose median age is declining. Higher rates may  also indicate difficulties for families, in some situations, to feed  and educate their children and for women to enter the labor force.  Rates below two children indicate populations decreasing in size and  growing older. Global fertility rates are in general decline and this  trend is most pronounced in industrialized countries, especially  Western Europe, where populations are projected to decline dramatically  over the next 50 years.    Trafficking in persons    Trafficking in persons is modern-day slavery, involving victims who are  forced, defrauded, or coerced into labor or sexual exploitation. The  International Labor Organization (ILO), the UN agency charged with  addressing labor standards, employment, and social protection issues,  estimates that 12.3 million people worldwide are enslaved in forced  labor, bonded labor, forced child labor, sexual servitude, and  involuntary servitude at any given time. Human trafficking is a multi-  dimensional threat, depriving people of their human rights and  freedoms, risking global health, promoting social breakdown, inhibiting  development by depriving countries of their human capital, and helping  fuel the growth of organized crime. In 2000, the US Congress passed the  Trafficking Victims Protection Act (TVPA), reauthorized in 2003 and  2005, which provides tools for the US to combat trafficking in persons,  both domestically and abroad. One of the law¿s key components is the  creation of the US Department of State¿s annual Trafficking in Persons  Report, which assesses the government response in some 150 countries  with a significant number of victims trafficked across their borders  who are recruited, harbored, transported, provided, or obtained for  forced labor or sexual exploitation. Countries in the annual report are  rated in three tiers, based on government efforts to combat  trafficking. The countries identified in this entry are those listed in  the 2006 Trafficking in Persons Report as Tier 2 Watch List or Tier 3  based on the following definitions:    Tier 2 Watch List countries do not fully comply with the minimum  standards for the elimination of trafficking but are making significant  efforts to do so, and meet one of the following criteria: 1. they  display a high or significantly increasing number victims, 2. they have  failed to provide evidence of increasing efforts to combat trafficking  in persons, or, 3. they have committed to take action over the next  year.    Tier 3 countries neither satisfy the minimum standards for the  elimination of traffiking nor demonstrate a significant effort to do  so. Countries in this tier are subject to potential non-humanitarian  and non-trade sanctions.    Transnational issues    This category includes four entries - Disputes - international,  Refugees and internally displaced persons, Trafficking in persons, and  Illicit drugs - that deal with current issues going beyond national  boundaries.    Transportation    This category includes the entries dealing with the means for movement  of people and goods.    Transportation - note    This entry includes miscellaneous transportation information of  significance not included elsewhere.    UTC (Coordinated Universal Time)    See entry for Coordinated Universal Time.    Unemployment rate    This entry contains the percent of the labor force that is without  jobs. Substantial underemployment might be noted.    Waterways    This entry gives the total length of navigable rivers, canals, and  other inland bodies of water.    Weights and Measures    This information is presented in Appendix G: Weights and Measures and  includes mathematical notations (mathematical powers and names), metric  interrelationships (prefix; symbol; length, weight, or capacity; area;  volume), and standard conversion factors.    Years    All year references are for the calendar year (CY) unless indicated as  fiscal year (FY). The calendar year is an accounting period of 12  months from 1 January to 31 December. The fiscal year is an accounting  period of 12 months other than 1 January to 31 December.
