The curvilinear course of the arteries likewise gives considerable  resistance; for at every bending the blood loses part of its momentum  against the sides; and this loss is evidently proportioned to the  magnitude of the angle, at which the branch goes off. Convolutions  are frequently made, in order to diminish the force of the blood in  particular organs; this is especially the case with the carotid  artery before it enters the brain.    The angles which the ramifications of the arteries make, are greater  or more obtuse nearer the heart, and more acute as the distance  increases; by which means the velocity of the blood is rendered more  equal in different parts.    The anastomosing or union of different branches of arteries, likewise  retards the velocity of the blood, the particles of which, from  different vessels, impinging, disturb each other's motion, and  produce a compound force, in which there is always a loss of  velocity: and it is evident, from the composition of forces, that  this loss must be proportioned to the obliquity of the angle at which  the vessels unite.    The adhesion of the blood to the sides of the vessels, likewise  causes a loss of velocity in the minuter branches, which may be owing  to a chemical affinity: the viscidity or imperfect fluidity of the  blood is another retarding cause. All these causes united, would  render it impossible for the heart to propel the blood with the  velocity with which it moves in the very minute branches of the  arteries, if these arteries were not endowed with a living muscular  power like the heart, by which they contract and propel their  contents.    In the veins, the motion of the blood is occasioned partly by the vis  a tergo, and partly by the contraction of the neighbouring muscles,  which press upon the veins; and these veins being furnished with  valves, the return of the blood towards the arteries is prevented; it  must therefore move towards the heart.    That the contraction of the muscles of the body tends very much to  promote the circulation of the blood, is evident, from the increase  of the circulation from exercise, and likewise from the languid  motion of the blood in sedentary persons, and those given to  indolence. Hence we may account for the different diseases to which  such persons are subject, and know how to apply the proper remedies.  Hence likewise, we see the reason why rest is so absolutely necessary  in acute and inflammatory diseases, where the momentum of the blood  is already too great.    It has been doubted by anatomists, whether the veins were possessed  with muscular power; but this seems now to be confirmed. Haller found  the vena cava near the heart to contract on the application of  stimulants, though he could see no muscular fibres; these, however,  have been discovered by succeeding anatomists.    The magnitude of the veins is always greater than that of the  corresponding arteries; hence the velocity of the blood must be less  in the veins; and hence likewise we may account for their want of  pulsation; for the action of the heart upon the arteries is at first  very great; but as we recede from the heart, this effect becomes less  perceptible; the arterial tube increases both in size and  muscularity, in proportion to its distance from the source of  circulation. The powers of the heart are spent in overcoming the  different resistances which I have noticed, before the blood enters  the veins; hence the blood will flow uniformly in these last.    The blood is subject in the veins to retarding causes, similar to  those which operate in the arteries, but perhaps not in an equal  degree; for the flexures are less frequent in the veins than in the  arteries. As the capacity of the arterial tube increases with its  distance from the heart, the velocity, from this cause, as has  already been observed, is continually diminished; but a contrary  effect takes place in the veins; for the different branches uniting,  form trunks, whose capacities are smaller than the sums of the  capacities of the branches, hence the velocity of the blood in the  veins will increase as it approaches the heart.    Another retarding cause may be mentioned, namely, gravity, which acts  more on the venous than the arterial system. The effects of gravity  on the veins may be exemplified, by a ring being pulled off the  finger with ease when the hand is elevated; also by the swellings of  the feet that occur in relaxed habits, which swellings increase  towards night, and subside in the morning, after the body has been in  a horizontal posture for some hours.    In weak persons, the frequency of the pulse is increased by an erect  posture, which may probably depend on gravity; as we know, from the  observations of Macdonald and others, that an erect posture will make  a difference of 15 or 20 beats in a minute. The experiments alluded  to, were made by gently raising a person fastened to a board, where  there being no muscular exertion, respiration would not be increased;  so that the whole effect was probably owing to gravity accelerating  the column of arterial blood.    The inverted posture produces a still more remarkable effect in  accelerating the pulse, than the erect, for it sometimes causes it to  beat 10 or 12 times more in the former case than in the latter.    While we are on this subject, it may not be improper to take notice  of the effects of swinging on the circulation, which have been found  by Dr. Carmichael Smyth, and others, to diminish the strength and  velocity to such a degree, as to bring on fainting. These effects  have never been satisfactorily accounted for; but they would seem to  admit of an easy explanation on mechanical principles: they are  undoubtedly owing, at least in a great measure, to the centrifugal  force acquired by the blood.    By a centrifugal force, I mean, the tendency which revolving bodies  have to fly off from the centre, which arises from their tendency to  move in a straight line, agreeably to the laws of motion. Hence a  tumbler of water may be whirled in a circle vertically without  spilling it; the centrifugal force pushing the water against the  bottom of the tumbler. In the same manner when the human body is made  to revolve vertically in the arch of a circle, this centrifugal force  will propel the blood from the head and heart towards he extremities;  hence the circulation of the blood will be weakened, and the energy of  the brain diminished. The contrary, however, will take place on a  horizontal swing, as I have frequently observed, both on myself and  others; for the centrifugal force in this case will propel the blood  from the extremities towards the head.    It has been already observed, that the pulsations of the artery which  we feel at the wrist, are occasioned by its alternate dilatations and  contractions, which vary according to the strength and regularity of  the circulation, which is liable to be affected by the smallest  changes in the state of health. Hence physicians make use of the  pulse as a criterion whereby to judge of the health of the body. And we  may observe that there are few more certain characteristics of the  state of the body than the pulse; yet the conclusions that have been  drawn from it have often been erroneous; and this has arisen from  trusting to observation without the aid of reason.    That we may better understand the phenomena of the pulse, I shall lay  down the following postulata. 1st. It is now generally believed, that  every part of the arterial system is endowed with irritability, or a  power of contracting on the application of a stimulus, and that the  blood acting on this contractibility, if the term may be allowed,  causes contraction; and that the alternate relaxation and contraction  gives the phenomenon pulsation. 2d. The greater the action of the  stimulus of the blood, the greater will be the contraction, that is,  the nearer will the sides of the artery approach towards the axis.  3d. That the velocity with which a muscular fibre, in a state of  debility, contracts, is at least equal to that with which a fibre in  a state of strength contracts, is a fact generally allowed by  physiologists.    We shall afterwards see, that a deficient action of stimulus on the  vessels may arise, either directly from diminishing the quantity of  blood contained in them, or indirectly, from the application of too  great a stimulant power, which has diminished the capability of  contracting inherent in the vessels.    From these postulata, it will be evident, that the greater the action  of the arteries, that is, the more powerful their contraction, the  longer will be the intervals between the pulsations.    For the velocity being at least equal in debility and in strength,  the times between the pulsations will be proportioned to the approach  of the sides of the artery towards its axis: but the approach of the  sides towards the axis is greater when the arteries are in a state of  vigour than when debilitated; consequently the intervals between the  pulsations will be greater when the arteries are in a state of vigour  than when debilitated.    Hence it is evident, that a frequency of pulse must generally  indicate a diminished action or debility; while a moderate slowness  indicates a vigorous or just action.    Hence likewise the opinion of increased action, which has been  supposed to take place in fevers, because a frequent pulse was  observed, must be false, because the frequency arises from a directly  opposite state, and indicates a diminished action of the vascular  system.

Conn and Aikman refer to the fact that over one  hundred species capable of producing variable quantities of lactic acid  are already known. It is fair to presume, however, that a careful  comparative study of these would show that simply racial differences  exist in many cases, and therefore, that they are not distinct species.    As a group these bacteria are characterized by their inability to  liquefy gelatin or develop spores. On account of this latter  characteristic they are easily destroyed when milk is pasteurized. They  live under aerobic or anaerobic conditions, many of them being able to  grow in either environment, although, according to McDonnell,[52] they  are more virulent when air is not excluded.    While growth of these lactic forms may go on in milk throughout a  relatively wide range in temperature, appreciable quantities of acid are  not produced except very slowly at temperatures below 50 deg. F.[53]    From the standpoint of frequency the most common abnormal changes that  occur in milk are those in which gases of varying character are  developed in connection with acids, from the milk sugar. Other volatile  products imparting bad flavors usually accompany gas production. These  fermentations are of most serious import in the cheese industry, as they  are especially prone to develop in the manufacture of milk into certain  types of cheese. Not often is their development so rapid that they  appear in the milk while it is yet in the hands of the milk producer,  but almost invariably the introduction of the causal organisms takes  place while the milk is on the farm. Numerous varieties of bacteria  possess this property of producing gas (H and CO_{2} are most common  although N and methane (CH_{4}) are sometimes produced). The more common  forms are those represented by _B. lactis aerogenes_ and the common  fecal type, _B. coli commune_. The ordinary habitat of this type is dirt  and intestinal filth. Hence careless methods of milk handling invite  this type of abnormal change in milk.    It is a wide-spread belief that thunder storms cause milk to sour  prematurely, but this idea has no scientific foundation. Experiments[54]  with the electric spark, ozone and loud detonations show no effect on  acid development, but the atmospheric conditions usually incident to a  thunder storm are such as permit of a more rapid growth of organisms.  There is no reason to believe but that the phenomenon of souring is  wholly related to the development of bacteria. Sterile milks are never  affected by the action of electric storms.    ~\"Gassy\" milks.~ Where these gas bacteria abound, the amount of lactic  acid is generally reduced, due to the splitting up of some of the sugar  into gaseous products. This type of germ life does not seem to be able  to develop well in the presence of the typical lactic acid non  gas-forming bacteria.    [Illustration: FIG. 16. Cheese made from \"gassy\" milk.]    ~\"Sweet curdling\" and digesting fermentations.~ Not infrequently milk,  instead of undergoing spontaneous souring, curdles in a weakly acid or  neutral condition, in which state it is said to have undergone \"sweet  curdling.\" The coagulation of the milk is caused by the action of enzyms  of a rennet type that are formed by the growth of various species of  bacteria. Later the whey separates more or less perfectly from the curd,  producing a \"wheyed off\" condition. Generally the coagulum in these  cases is soft and somewhat slimy. The curd usually diminishes in bulk,  due to the gradual digestion or peptonization of the casein by  proteid-dissolving enzyms (tryptic type) that are also produced by the  bacteria causing the change.    A large number of bacteria possess the property of affecting milk in  this way. So far as known they are able to liquefy gelatin (also a  peptonizing process) and form spores. The Tyrothrix type of bacteria (so  named by Duclaux on account of the supposed relation to cheese ripening)  belongs to this class. The hay and potato forms are also digesters.  Organisms of this type are generally associated with filth and manure,  and find their way into the milk from the accumulations on the coat of  the animal.    Conn[55] has separated the rennet enzym from bacterial cultures in a  relatively pure condition, while Fermi[56] has isolated the digestive  ferment from several species.    Duclaux[57] has given to this digesting enzym the name _casease_ or  cheese ferment. These isolated ferments when added to fresh milk possess  the power of causing the characteristic curdling and subsequent  digestion quite independent of cell development. The quantity of ferment  produced by different species differs materially in some cases. In these  digestive fermentations, the chemical transformations are profound, the  complex proteid molecule being broken down into albumoses, peptones,  amido-acids (tyrosin and leucin) and ammonia as well as fatty acids.    Not infrequently these fermentations gain the ascendency over the normal  souring change, but under ordinary conditions they are held in abeyance,  although this type of bacteria is always present to some extent in milk.  When the lactic acid bacteria are destroyed, as in boiled, sterilized  or pasteurized milk, these rennet-producing, digesting species develop.    ~Butyric acid fermentations.~ The formation of butyric acid in milk which  may be recognized by the \"rancid butter\" odor is not infrequently seen  in old, sour milk, and for a long time was thought to be a continuation  of the lactic fermentation, but it is now believed that these organisms  find more favorable conditions for growth, not so much on account of the  lactic acid formed as in the absence of dissolved oxygen in the milk  which is consumed by the sour-milk organisms.    Most of the butyric class of bacteria are spore-bearing, and hence they  are frequently present in boiled or sterilized milk. The by-products  formed in this series of changes are quite numerous. In most cases,  butyric acid is prominent, but in addition to this, other organic acids,  as lactic, succinic, and acetic, are produced, likewise different  alcohols. Concerning the chemical origin of butyric acid there is yet  some doubt. Duclaux[58] affirms that the fat, sugar and casein are all  decomposed by various forms. In some cases, the reaction of the milk is  alkaline, with other species it may be neutral or acid. This type of  fermentation has not received the study it deserves.    In milk these organisms are not of great importance, as this  fermentation does not readily gain the ascendency over the lactic  bacteria.    ~Ropy or slimy milk.~ The viscosity of milk is often markedly increased  over that which it normally possesses. The intensity of this abnormal  condition may vary much; in some cases the milk becoming viscous or  slimy; in others stringing out into long threads, several feet in  length, as in Fig. 17. Two sets of conditions are responsible for these  ropy or slimy milks. The most common is where the milk is clotted or  stringy when drawn, as in some forms of garget. This is generally due to  the presence of viscid pus, and is often accompanied by a bloody  discharge, such a condition representing an inflamed state of the udder.  Ropiness of this character is not usually communicable from one lot of  milk to another.    [Illustration: FIG. 17. Ropy milk.]    The communicable form of ropy milk only appears after the milk has been  drawn from the udder for a day or so, and is caused by the development  of various species of bacteria which find their way into the milk after  it is drawn. These defects are liable to occur at any season of the  year. Their presence in a dairy is a source of much trouble, as the  unsightly appearance of the milk precludes its use as food, although  there is no evidence that these ropy fermentations are dangerous to  health.    There are undoubtedly a number of different species of bacteria that are  capable of producing these viscid changes,[59] but it is quite probable  that they are not of equal importance in infecting milk under natural  conditions.    In the majority of cases studied in this country,[60] the causal  organism seems to be _B. lactis viscosus_, a form first found by Adametz  in surface waters.[61] This organism possesses the property of  developing at low temperatures (45 deg.-50 deg. F.), and consequently it  is often able in winter to supplant the lactic-acid forms. Ward has found  this germ repeatedly in water tanks where milk cans are cooled; and  under these conditions it is easy to see how infection of the milk might  occur. Marshall[62] reports an outbreak which he traced to an external  infection of the udder; in another case, the slime-forming organism was  abundant in the barn dust. A defect of this character is often  perpetuated in a dairy for some time, and may therefore become  exceedingly troublesome. In one instance in the writer's experience, a  milk dealer lost over $150 a month for several months from ropy cream.  Failure to properly sterilize cans, and particularly strainer cloths, is  frequently responsible for a continuance of trouble of this sort.    The slimy substance formed in milk comes from various constituents of  the milk, and the chemical character of the slime produced also varies  with different germs. In some cases the slimy material is merely the  swollen outer cell membrane of the bacteria themselves as in the case of  _B. lactis viscosus_; in others it is due to the decomposition of the  proteids, but often the chief decomposition product appears to come from  a viscous fermentation of the milk-sugar.    An interesting case of a fermentation of this class being utilized in  dairying is seen in the use of \"lange wei\" (long or stringy whey) which  is employed as a starter in Holland to control the"]]]
