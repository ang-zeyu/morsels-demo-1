Man is seen only in the true likeness of his Maker.  Believing a lie veils the truth from our vision; even as  in mathematics, in summing up positive and negative [10]  quantities, the negative quantity offsets an equal positive  quantity, making the aggregate positive, or true quantity,  by that much, less available.    _Why do Christian Scientists hold that their theology is_  _essential to heal the sick, when the mind-cure claims to heal_ [15]  _without it?_    The theology of Christian Science is Truth; opposed  to which is the error of sickness, sin, and death, that  Truth destroys.    A \"mind-cure\" is a matter-cure. An adherent to this [20]  method honestly acknowledges this fact in her work  entitled \"Mind-cure on a Material Basis.\" In that  work the author grapples with Christian Science, attempts  to solve its divine Principle by the rule of human mind,  fails, and ends in a parody on this Science which is amus- [25]  ing to astute readers,--especially when she tells them  that she is practising this Science.    The theology of Christian Science is based on the action  of the divine Mind over the human mind and body;  whereas, \"mind-cure\" rests on the notion that the human [30]  mind can cure its own disease, or that which it causes,    [Page 63.]    and the _sickness of matter_,--which is infidel in the one [1]  case, and anomalous in the other. It was said of old by  Truth-traducers, that Jesus healed through Beelzebub;  but the claim that one erring mind cures another one was  at first gotten up to hinder his benign influence and to hide [5]  his divine power.    Our Master understood that Life, Truth, Love are the  triune Principle of all pure theology; also, that this divine  trinity is one infinite remedy for the opposite triad, sick-  ness, sin, and death. [10]    _If there is no sin, why did Jesus come to save sinners?_    If there is no reality in sickness, why does a Chris-  tian Scientist go to the bedside and address himself to  the healing of disease, on the basis of its unreality?  Jesus came to seek and to save such as believe in the [15]  reality of the unreal; to save them from _this false belief_;  that they might lay hold of eternal Life, the great reality  that concerns man, and understand the final fact,--that  God is omnipotent and omnipresent; yea, \"that the Lord  He is God; there is none else beside Him,\" as the Scrip- [20]  tures declare.    _If Christ was God, why did Jesus cry out, __\"__My God,_  _why hast Thou forsaken me?__\"_    Even as the struggling heart, reaching toward a higher  goal, appeals to its hope and faith, Why failest thou [25]  me? Jesus as the son of man was human: Christ as  the Son of God was divine. This divinity was reaching  humanity through the crucifixion of the human,--that  momentous demonstration of God, in which Spirit proved  its supremacy over matter. Jesus assumed for mortals the [30]    [Page 64.]    weakness of flesh, that Spirit might be found \"All-in-all.\" [1]  Hence, the human cry which voiced that struggle;  thence, the way he made for mortals' escape. Our  Master bore the cross to show his power over death;  then relinquished his earth-task of teaching and dem- [5]  onstrating the nothingness of sickness, sin, and death,  and rose to his native estate, man's indestructible eternal  life in God.    _What can prospective students of the College take for_  _preliminary studies? Do you regard the study of litera-_ [10]  _ture and languages as objectionable?_    Persons contemplating a course at the Massachusetts  Metaphysical College, can prepare for it through no  books except the Bible, and \"Science and Health with  Key to the Scriptures.\" Man-made theories are nar- [15]  row, else extravagant, and are always materialistic.  The ethics which guide thought spiritually must bene-  fit every one; for the only philosophy and religion that  afford instruction are those which deal with facts and  resist speculative opinions and fables. [20]    Works on science are profitable; for science is not  human. It is spiritual, and not material. Literature  and languages, to a limited extent, are aids to a student  of the Bible and of Christian Science.    _Is it possible to know why we are put into this condition_ [25]  _of mortality?_    It is quite as possible to know wherefore man is thus  conditioned, as to be certain that he _is_ in a state of  mortality. The only evidence of the existence of a mor-  tal man, or of a material state and universe, is gathered [30]    [Page 65.]    from the five personal senses. This delusive evidence, [1]  Science has dethroned by repeated proofs of its falsity.    We have no more proof of human discord,--sin,  sickness, disease, or death,--than we have that the  earth's surface is flat, and her motions imaginary. If [5]  man's _ipse dixit_ as to the stellar system is correct, this  is because Science is true, and the evidence of the senses  is false. Then why not submit to the affirmations of  Science concerning the greater subject of human weal  and woe? Every question between Truth and error, [10]  Science must and will decide. Left to the decision of  Science, your query concerns a negative which the posi-  tive Truth destroys; for God's universe and man are  immortal. We must not consider the false side of exist-  ence in order to gain the true solution of Life and its [15]  great realities.    _Have you changed your instructions as to the right way_  _of treating disease?_    I have not; and this important fact must be, and al-  ready is, apprehended by those who understand my in- [20]  structions on this question. Christian Science demands  both law and gospel, in order to demonstrate healing,  and I have taught them both in its demonstration, and  with signs following. They are a unit in restoring the  equipoise of mind and body, and balancing man's ac- [25]  count with his Maker. The sequence proves that strict  adherence to one is inadequate to compensate for the  absence of the other, since both constitute the divine law  of healing.    The Jewish religion demands that \"whoso sheddeth [30]  man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed.\" But this    [Page 66.]    law is not infallible in wisdom; and obedience thereto [1]  may be found faulty, since false testimony or mistaken  evidence may cause the innocent to suffer for the guilty.  Hence the gospel that fulfils the law in righteousness,  the genius whereof is displayed in the surprising wisdom [5]  of these words of the New Testament: \"Whatsoever  a man soweth, that shall he also reap.\" No possible  injustice lurks in this mandate, and no human mis-  judgment can pervert it; for the offender alone suffers,  and always according to divine decree. This sacred, [10]  solid precept is verified in all directions in Mind-  healing, and is supported in the Scripture by parallel  proof.    The law and gospel of Truth and Love teach, through  divine Science, that sin is identical with suffering, and [15]  that suffering is the lighter affliction. To reach the sum-  mit of Science, whence to discern God's perfect ways  and means, the material sense must be controlled by  the higher spiritual sense, and Truth be enthroned,  while \"we look not at the things which are seen, but at [20]  the things which are not seen.\"    Cynical critics misjudge my meaning as to the sci-  entific treatment of the sick. Disease that is superin-  duced by sin is not healed like the more physical  ailment. The beginner in sin-healing must know this, or [25]  he never can reach the Science of Mind-healing, and  so \"overcome evil with good.\" Error in premise is met  with error in practice; yea, it is \"the blind leading the  blind.\" Ignorance of the cause of disease can neither  remove that cause nor its effect. [30]    I endeavor to accommodate my instructions to the  present capability of the learner, and to support the    [Page 67.]    liberated thought until its altitude reaches beyond the [1]  mere alphabet of Mind-healing. Above physical wants,  lie the higher claims of the law and gospel of healing.  First is the law, which saith:--    \"Thou shalt not commit adultery;\" in other words, [5]  thou shalt not adulterate Life, Truth, or Love,--men-  tally, morally, or physically. \"Thou shalt not steal;\"  that is, thou shalt not rob man of money, which is but  trash, compared with his rights of mind and character.  \"Thou shalt not kill;\" that is, thou shalt not strike at the [10]  eternal sense of Life with a malicious aim, but shalt  know that by doing thus thine own sense of Life shall be  forfeited. \"Thou shalt not bear false witness;\" that is,  thou shalt not utter a lie, either mentally or audibly, nor  cause it to be thought. Obedience to these command- [15]  ments is indispensable to health, happiness, and length  of days.    The gospel of healing demonstrates the law of Love.  Justice uncovers sin of every sort; and mercy demands  that if you see the danger menacing others, you shall, [20]  _Deo volente_, inform them thereof. Only thus is the right  practice of Mind-healing achieved, and the wrong prac-  tice discerned, disarmed, and destroyed.    _Do you believe in translation?_    If your question refers to language, whereby one ex- [25]  presses the sense of words in one language by equiva-  lent words in another, I do. If you refer to the removal  of a person to heaven, without his subjection to death,  I modify my affirmative answer. I believe in this  removal being possible after all the footsteps requisite [30]  have been taken up to the very throne, up to the    [Page 68.]    spiritual sense and fact of divine substance, intelligence, [1]  Life, and Love. This translation is not the work of mo-  ments; it requires both time and eternity. It means more  than mere disappearance to the human sense; it must  include also man's changed appearance and diviner form [5]"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31511"],[0,"A History of Witchcraft in England from 1558 to 1718 (#12)"],[1,",\" intending to send her to the pillory. While the mayor was  admonishing her, a lawyer called attention to the point that the  invocation of evil spirits had been made a felony. The mayor sentenced  the woman to execution. But, \"because there was no matter of invocation  given in evidence against hir, ... hir execution was staied by the space  of three daies.\" Sundry preachers tried to wring confessions from her,  but to no purpose. Yet she made so godly an end, says the chronicler,  that \"manie now lamented hir death which were before hir utter  enimies.\"[29] The case illustrates vividly the clumsiness of municipal  court procedure. The mayor's court was unfamiliar with the law and  utterly unable to avert the consequences of its own finding. In the  regular assize courts, Joan Cason would probably have been sentenced to  four public appearances in the pillory.    The differences between the first half and the second half of  Elizabeth's reign have not been deemed wide enough by the writer to  justify separate treatment. The whole reign was a time when the  superstition was gaining ground. Yet in the span of years from Reginald  Scot to the death of Elizabeth there was enough of reaction to justify a  differentiation of statistics. In both periods, and more particularly in  the first, we may be sure that some of the records have been lost and  that a thorough search of local archives would reveal some trials of  which we have at present no knowledge. It was a time rich in mention of  witch trials, but a time too when but few cases were fully described.  Scot's incidental references to the varied experiences of Sir Roger  Manwood and of his uncle Sir Thomas Scot merely confirm an impression  gained from the literature of the time that the witch executions were  becoming, throughout the seventies and early eighties, too common to be  remarkable. For the second period we have record of probably a larger  percentage of all the cases. For the whole time from 1563, when the new  law went into effect, down to 1603, we have records of nearly fifty  executions. Of these just about two-thirds occurred in the earlier  period, while of the acquittals two-thirds belong to the later period.  It would be rash to attach too much significance to these figures. As a  matter of fact, the records are so incomplete that the actual totals  have little if any meaning and only the proportions can be  considered.[30] Yet it looks as if the forces which caused the  persecution of witches in England were beginning to abate; and it may  fairly be inquired whether some new factor may not have entered into the  situation. It is time to speak of Reginald Scot and of the exorcists.      [1] Who from a confession made in 1579 seems to have been her sister.  See the pamphlet _A Detection of damnable driftes, practised by three  Witches arraigned at Chelmsforde in Essex at the last Assizes there  holden, which were executed in Aprill, 1579_ (London, 1579).    [2] _E. g._: \"I was afearde for he [the dog with horns] skypped and  leaped to and fro, and satte on the toppe of a nettle.\"    [3] Whether Agnes Waterhouse had a \"daggar's knife\" and whether the dog  had the face of an ape.    [4] An offer which indicates that he was acting as judge.    [5] She was questioned on her church habits. She claimed to be a regular  attendant; she \"prayed right hartely there.\" She admitted, however, that  she prayed \"in laten\" because Sathan would not let her pray in English.    [6] There is of course the further possibility that the pamphlet account  was largely invented. A critical examination of the pamphlet tends to  establish its trustworthiness. See appendix A, Sec. 1.    [7] Alice Chandler was probably hanged at this time. The failure to  mention her name is easily explained when we remember that the pamphlet  was issued in two parts, as soon as possible after the event. Alice  Chandler's case probably did not come up for trial until the two parts  of the pamphlet had already been published. See _A Detection of damnable  driftes_.    [8] Mother Staunton, who had apparently made some pretensions to the  practice of magic, was arraigned on several charges. She had been  refused her requests by several people, who had thereupon suffered some  ills.    [9] It is possible that the whole affair started from the whim of a sick  child, who, when she saw Elleine Smith, cried, \"Away with the witch.\"    [10] A caution here. The pamphlets were hastily compiled and perhaps  left out important facts.    [11] Her eight-year-old boy was probably illegitimate.    [12] Mother Waterhouse's knowledge of Latin, if that is more than the  fiction of a Protestant pamphleteer, is rather remarkable.    [13] Allowance must be made for a very prejudiced reporter, _i. e._, the  judge himself.    [14] These details were very probably suggested to her by the judge.    [15] Who promised her also \"favour.\"    [16] The detestable methods of Justice Darcy come out in the case of a  woman from whom he threatened to remove her imps if she did not confess,  and by that means trapped her into the incriminating statement, \"That  shal ye not.\"    [17] William Hooke had heard William Newman \"bid the said Ales his wife  to beate it away.\" Comparable with this was the evidence of Margerie  Sammon who \"sayeth that the saide widow Hunt did tell her that shee had  harde the said Joan Pechey, being in her house, verie often to chide and  vehemently speaking, ... and sayth that shee went in to see, ... shee  founde no bodie but herselfe alone.\"    [18] Reginald Scot, _Discoverie of Witchcraft_, 542, says of this trial,  \"In the meane time let anie man with good consideration peruse that  booke published by W. W. and it shall suffice to satisfie him in all  that may be required.... See whether the witnesses be not single, of  what credit, sex, and age they are; namelie lewd miserable and envious  poore people; most of them which speake to anie purpose being old women  and children of the age of 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 yeares.\"    [19] There can be no doubt that Brian Darcy either wrote the account  himself or dictated it to \"W. W.\" The frequent use of \"me,\" meaning by  that pronoun the judge, indicates that he was responsible.    [20] It is some relief in this trial to read the testimony of John  Tendering about William Byett. He had a cow \"in a strange case.\" He  could not lift it. He put fire under the cow, she got up and \"there  stood still and fell a byting of stickes larger than any man's finger  and after lived and did well.\"    [21] Second wife of Sir Henry Cromwell, who was the grandfather of  Oliver.    [22] The children were strangely inconsistent. At the first they had  fits when Mother Samuel appeared. Later they were troubled unless Mother  Samuel were kept in the house, or unless they were taken to her house.    [23] This device seems to have been originally suggested by the children  to try Mother Samuel's guilt.    [24] The clergyman, \"Doctor Dorrington,\" had been one of the leaders in  prosecuting them.    [25] Harsnett, _Discovery of the Fraudulent Practises of John Darrel_  (London, 1599), 92, 97.    [26] Among the manuscripts on witchcraft in the Bodleian Library are  three such pardons of witches for their witchcraft--one of Jane Mortimer  in 1595, one of Rosa Bexwell in 1600, and one of \"Alice S.,\" without  date but under Elizabeth.    [27] In 1595 he was made warden of the Manchester Collegiate Church. Dee  has in our days found a biographer. See _John Dee_ (1527-1608), by  Charlotte Fell Smith (London, 1909).    [28] For the particular case, see Mary Bateson, ed., _Records of the  Borough of Leicester_ (Cambridge, 1899), III. 335; for the general  letters patent covering such cases see _id._, II, 365, 366.    [29] For this story see Ralph Holinshed, _Chronicles of England,  Scotland, and Ireland_ (London, 1577, reprinted 1586-1587 and  1807-1808), ed. of 1807-1808, IV, 891, 893. Faversham was then  \"Feversham.\"    [30] Justice Anderson, when sentencing a witch to a year's imprisonment,  declared that this was the twenty-fifth or twenty-sixth witch he had  condemned. This is good evidence that the records of many cases have  been lost. See Brit. Mus., Sloane MS. 831, f. 38.          CHAPTER III.    REGINALD SCOT.      From the chronicling of witch trials we turn aside in this chapter to  follow the career of the first great English opponent of the  superstition. We have seen how the attack upon the supposed creatures of  the Devil was growing stronger throughout the reign of Elizabeth. We  shall see how that attack was checked, at least in some degree, by the  resistance of one man. Few men of so quiet and studious life have  wrought so effectively as Reginald Scot. He came of a family well known  in Kent, but not politically aggressive. As a young man he studied at  Hart Hall[1] in Oxford, but left without taking his degree and returned  to Scots-Hall, where he settled down to the routine duties of managing  his estate. He gave himself over, we are told, to husbandry and  gardening and to a solid course of general reading in the obscure  authors that had \"by the generality been neglected.\" In 1574 his studies  in horticulture resulted in the publication of _A Perfect Platforme of a  Hoppe-Garden and necessary instructions for the making and maintaining  thereof_. That the book ministered to a practical interest was evidenced  by the call for three editions within five years. Whether he now applied  himself to the study of that subject which was to be the theme of his  _Discoverie_, we do not know. It was a matter which had doubtless  arrested his attention even earlier and had enlisted a growing interest  upon his part. Not until a decade after his _Hoppe-Garden_, however, did  he put forth the epoch-making _Discoverie_. Nor does it seem likely that  he had been engaged for a long period on the actual composition. Rather,  the style and matter of the book seem to evince traces of"]]]
