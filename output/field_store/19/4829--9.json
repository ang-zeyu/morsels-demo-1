For these  different kinds of congress, performed according to the usage of each  country, and the liking of each individual, generate love, friendship,  and respect in the hearts of women.\"          CHAPTER VII.    OF THE VARIOUS MODES OF STRIKING, AND OF THE SOUNDS APPROPRIATE TO THEM.      Sexual intercourse can be compared to a quarrel, on account of the  contrarieties of love and its tendency to dispute. The place of striking  with passion is the body, and on the body the special places are:       The shoulders.     The head.     The space between the breasts.     The back.     The jaghana, or middle part of the body.     The sides.    Striking is of four kinds, viz.:       Striking with the back of the hand.     Striking with the fingers a little contracted.     Striking with the fist.     Striking with the open palm of the hand.    On account of its causing pain, striking gives rise to the hissing  sound, which is of various kinds, and to the eight kinds of crying,  viz.:       The sound Hin.     The thundering sound.     The cooing sound.     The weeping sound.     The sound Phut.     The sound Phat.     The sound Sut.     The sound Plat.    Besides these, there are also words having a meaning, such as \"mother,\"  and those that are expressive of prohibition, sufficiency, desire of  liberation, pain or praise, and to which may be added sounds like those  of the dove, the cuckoo, the green pigeon, the parrot, the bee, the  sparrow, the flamingo, the duck, and the quail, which are all  occasionally made use of.    Blows with the fist should be given on the back of the woman, while she  is sitting on the lap of the man, and she should give blows in return,  abusing the man as if she were angry, and making the cooing and the  weeping sounds. While the woman is engaged in congress the space between  the breasts should be struck with the back of the hand, slowly at first,  and then proportionately to the increasing excitement, until the end.    At this time the sounds Hin and others may be made, alternately or  optionally, according to habit. When the man, making the sound Phat,  strikes the woman on the head, with the fingers of his hand a little  contracted, it is called Prasritaka, which means striking with the  fingers of the hand a little contracted. In this case the appropriate  sounds are the cooing sound, the sound Phat, and the sound Phut in the  interior of the mouth, and at the end of congress the sighing and  weeping sounds. The sound Phat is an imitation of the sound of a bamboo  being split, while the sound Phut is like the sound made by something  falling into water. At all times when kissing and such like things are  begun, the woman should give a reply with a hissing sound. During the  excitement when the woman is not accustomed to striking, she continually  utters words expressive of prohibition, sufficiently, or desire of  liberation, as well as the words \"father,\" \"mother,\" intermingled with  the sighing, weeping and thundering sounds.[38] Towards the conclusion  of the congress, the breasts, the jaghana, and the sides of the woman  should be pressed with the open palms of the hand, with some force,  until the end of it, and then sounds like those of the quail, or the  goose should be made.    There are also two verses on the subject as follows:    \"The characteristics of manhood are said to consist of roughness and  impetuosity, while weakness, tenderness, sensibility, and an inclination  to turn away from unpleasant things are the distinguishing marks of  womanhood. The excitement of passion, and peculiarities of habit may  sometimes cause contrary results to appear, but these do not last long,  and in the end the natural state is resumed.\"    The wedge on the bosom, the scissors on the head, the piercing  instrument on the cheeks, and the pinchers on the breasts and sides, may  also be taken into consideration with the other four modes of striking,  and thus give eight ways altogether. But these four ways of striking  with instruments are peculiar to the people of the southern countries,  and the marks caused by them are seen on the breasts of their women.  They are local peculiarities, but Vatsyayana is of opinion that the  practice of them is painful, barbarous, and base, and quite unworthy of  imitation.    In the same way anything that is a local peculiarity should not always  be adopted elsewhere, and even in the place where the practice is  prevalent, excess of it should always be avoided. Instances of the  dangerous use of them may be given as follows. The King of the Panchalas  killed the courtezan Madhavasena by means of the wedge during congress.  King Shatakarni Shatavahana of the Kuntalas deprived his great Queen  Malayavati of her life by a pair of scissors, and Naradeva, whose hand  was deformed, blinded a dancing girl by directing a piercing instrument  in a wrong way.    There are also two verses on the subject as follows:    \"About these things there cannot be either enumeration or any definite  rule. Congress having once commenced, passion alone gives birth to all  the acts of the parties.\"    Such passionate actions and amorous gesticulations or movements, which  arise on the spur of the moment, and during sexual intercourse, cannot  be defined, and are as irregular as dreams. A horse having once attained  the fifth degree of motion goes on with blind speed, regardless of pits,  ditches, and posts in his way; and in the same manner a loving pair  become blind with passion in the heat of congress, and go on with great  impetuosity, paying not the least regard to excess. For this reason one  who is well acquainted with the science of love, and knowing his own  strength, as also the tenderness, impetuosity, and strength of the young  woman, should act accordingly. The various modes of enjoyment are not  for all times or for all persons, but they should only be used at the  proper time, and in the proper countries and places.    FOOTNOTE:    [Footnote 38: Men who are well acquainted with the art of love are well  aware how often one woman differs from another in her sighs and sounds  during the time of congress. Some women like to be talked to in the most  loving way, others in the most abusive way, and so on. Some women enjoy  themselves with closed eyes in silence, others make a great noise over  it, and some almost faint away. The great art is to ascertain what gives  them the greatest pleasure, and what specialities they like best.]          CHAPTER VIII.    ABOUT WOMEN ACTING THE PART OF A MAN; AND OF THE WORK OF A MAN.      When a woman sees that her lover is fatigued by constant congress,  without having his desire satisfied, she should, with his permission,  lay him down upon his back, and give him assistance by acting his part.  She may also do this to satisfy the curiosity of her lover, or her own  desire of novelty.    There are two ways of doing this, the first is when during congress she  turns round, and gets on the top of her lover, in such a manner as to  continue the congress, without obstructing the pleasure of it; and the  other is when she acts the man's part from the beginning. At such a  time, with flowers in her hair hanging loose, and her smiles broken by  hard breathings, she should press upon her lover's bosom with her own  breasts, and lowering her head frequently, should do in return the same  actions which he used to do before, returning his blows and chaffing  him, should say, \"I was laid down by you, and fatigued with hard  congress, I shall now therefore lay you down in return.\" She should then  again manifest her own bashfulness, her fatigue, and her desire of  stopping the congress. In this way she should do the work of a man,  which we shall presently relate.    Whatever is done by a man for giving pleasure to a woman is called the  work of a man, and is as follows:--    While the woman is lying on his bed, and is as it were abstracted by his  conversation, he should loosen the knot of her under garments, and when  she begins to dispute with him, he should overwhelm her with kisses.  Then when his lingam is erect he should touch her with his hands in  various places, and gently manipulate various parts of the body. If the  woman is bashful, and if it is the first time that they have come  together, the man should place his hands between her thighs, which she  would probably keep close together, and if she is a very young girl, he  should first get his hands upon her breasts, which she would probably  cover with her own hands, and under her armpits and on her neck. If  however she is a seasoned woman, he should do whatever is agreeable  either to him or to her, and whatever is fitting for the occasion. After  this he should take hold of her hair, and hold her chin in his fingers  for the purpose of kissing her. On this, if she is a young girl, she  will become bashful and close her eyes. Any how he should gather from  the action of the woman what things would be pleasing to her during  congress.    Here Suvarnanabha says that while a man is doing to the woman what he  likes best during congress, he should always make a point of pressing  those parts of her body on which she turns her eyes.    The signs of the enjoyment and satisfaction of the women are as follows:  her body relaxes, she closes her eyes, she puts aside all bashfulness,  and shows increased willingness to unite the two organs as closely  together as possible. On the other hand, the signs of her want of  enjoyment and of failing to be satisfied are as follows: she shakes her  hands, she does not let the man get up, feels dejected, bites the man,  kicks him, and continues to go on moving after the man has finished. In  such cases the man should rub the yoni of the woman with his hand and  fingers (as the elephant rubs anything with his trunk) before engaging  in congress, until it "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2785"],[0,"The Elusive Pimpernel (#12)"],[1," rate not for the present.    She trusted to her own powers of intrigue, and her well-known  fascinations, to re-conquer the friendship of the Jacobin clique, and  she once more turned her attention to the affiliated Socialistic clubs  of England. But between the proverbial two stools, Demoiselle Candeille  soon came to the ground. Her machinations became known in official  quarters, her connection with all the seditious clubs of London was soon  bruited abroad, and one evening Desiree found herself confronted with  a document addressed to her: \"From the Office of His Majesty's Privy  Seal,\" wherein it was set forth that, pursuant to the statute 33 George  III. cap. 5, she, Desiree Candeille, a French subject now resident in  England, was required to leave this kingdom by order of His Majesty  within seven days, and that in the event of the said Desiree Candeille  refusing to comply with this order, she would be liable to commitment,  brought to trial and sentenced to imprisonment for a month, and  afterwards to removal within a limited time under pain of transportation  for life.    This meant that Demoiselle Candeille had exactly seven days in which to  make complete her reconciliation with her former friends who now ruled  Paris and France with a relentless and perpetually bloodstained hand.  No wonder that during the night which followed the receipt of this  momentous document, Demoiselle Candeille suffered gravely from insomnia.    She dared not go back to France, she was ordered out of England! What  was to become of her?    This was just three days before the eventful afternoon of the Richmond  Gala, and twenty-four hours after ex-Ambassador Chauvelin had landed in  England. Candeille and Chauvelin had since then met at the \"Cercle des  Jacobins Francais\" in Soho Street, and now fair Desiree found herself in  lodgings in Richmond, the evening of the day following the Gala, feeling  that her luck had not altogether deserted her.    One conversation with Citizen Chauvelin had brought the fickle jade  back to Demoiselle Candeilles' service. Nay, more, the young actress  saw before her visions of intrigue, of dramatic situations, of pleasant  little bits of revenge;--all of which was meat and drink and air to  breathe for Mademoiselle Desiree.    She was to sing in one of the most fashionable salons in England: that  was very pleasant. The Prince of Wales would hear and see her! that  opened out a vista of delightful possibilities! And all she had to do  was to act a part dictated to her by Citizen Chauvelin, to behave as  he directed, to move in the way he wished! Well! that was easy enough,  since the part which she would have to play was one peculiarly suited to  her talents.    She looked at herself critically in the glass. Her maid Fanchon--a  little French waif picked up in the slums of Soho--helped to readjust a  stray curl which had rebelled against the comb.    \"Now for the necklace, Mademoiselle,\" said Fanchon with suppressed  excitement.    It had just arrived by messenger: a large morocco case, which now lay  open on the dressing table, displaying its dazzling contents.    Candeille scarcely dared to touch it, and yet it was for her. Citizen  Chauvelin had sent a note with it.    \"Citizeness Candeille will please accept this gift from the government  of France in acknowledgment of useful services past and to come.\"    The note was signed with Robespierre's own name, followed by that of  Citizen Chauvelin. The morocco case contained a necklace of diamonds  worth the ransom of a king.    \"For useful services past and to come!\" and there were promises of still  further rewards, a complete pardon for all defalcations, a place  within the charmed circle of the Comedie Francaise, a grand pageant  and apotheosis with Citizeness Candeille impersonating the Goddess of  Reason, in the midst of a grand national fete, and the acclamations of  excited Paris: and all in exchange for the enactment of a part--simple  and easy--outlined for her by Chauvelin!...    How strange! how inexplicable! Candeille took the necklace up in her  trembling fingers and gazed musingly at the priceless gems. She had seen  the jewels before, long, long ago! round the neck of the Duchesse de  Marny, in whose service her own mother had been. She--as a child--had  often gazed at and admired the great lady, who seemed like a wonderful  fairy from an altogether world, to the poor little kitchen slut.    How wonderful are the vagaries of fortune! Desiree Candeille, the  kitchen-maid's daughter, now wearing her ex-mistress' jewels.  She supposed that these had been confiscated when the last of the  Marnys--the girl, Juliette--had escaped from France! confiscated and now  sent to her--Candeille--as a reward or as a bribe!    In either case they were welcome. The actress' vanity was soothed. She  knew Juliette Marny was in England, and that she would meet her to-night  at Lady Blakeney's. After the many snubs which she had endured from  French aristocrats settled in England, the actress felt that she was  about to enjoy an evening of triumph.    The intrigue excited her. She did not quite know what schemes Chauvelin  was aiming at, what ultimate end he had had in view when he commanded  her services and taught her the part which he wished her to play.    That the schemes were vast and the end mighty, she could not doubt. The  reward she had received was proof enough of that.    Little Fanchon stood there in speechless admiration, whilst her mistress  still fondly fingered the magnificent necklace.    \"Mademoiselle will wear the diamond to-night?\" she asked with evident  anxiety: she would have been bitterly disappointed to have seen the  beautiful thing once more relegated to its dark morocco case.    \"Oh, yes, Fanchon!\" said Candeille with a sigh of great satisfaction;  \"see that they are fastened quite securely, my girl.\"    She put the necklace round her shapely neck and Fanchon looked to see  that the clasp was quite secure.    There came the sound of loud knocking at the street door.    \"That is M. Chauvelin come to fetch me with the chaise. Am I quite  ready, Fanchon?\" asked Desiree Candeille.    \"Oh yes, Mademoiselle!\" sighed the little maid; \"and Mademoiselle looks  very beautiful to-night.\"    \"Lady Blakeney is very beautiful too, Fanchon,\" rejoined the actress  naively, \"but I wonder if she will wear anything as fine as the Marny  necklace?\"    The knocking at the street door was repeated. Candeille took a final,  satisfied survey of herself in the glass. She knew her part and felt  that she had dressed well for it. She gave a final, affectionate  little tap to the diamonds round her neck, took her cloak and hood from  Fanchon, and was ready to go.          Chapter X: Lady Blakeney's Rout        There are several accounts extant, in the fashionable chronicles of the  time, of the gorgeous reception given that autumn by Lady Blakeney in  her magnificent riverside home.    Never had the spacious apartments of Blakeney Manor looked more  resplendent than on this memorable occasion--memorable because of the  events which brought the brilliant evening to a close.    The Prince of Wales had come over by water from Carlton House; the Royal  Princesses came early, and all fashionable London was there, chattering  and laughing, displaying elaborate gowns and priceless jewels dancing,  flirting, listening to the strains of the string band, or strolling  listlessly in the gardens, where the late roses and clumps of heliotrope  threw soft fragrance on the balmy air.    But Marguerite was nervous and agitated. Strive how she might, she  could not throw off that foreboding of something evil to come, which had  assailed her from the first moment when she met Chauvelin face to face.    That unaccountable feeling of unreality was still upon her, that sense  that she, and the woman Candeille, Percy and even His Royal Highness  were, for the time being, the actors in a play written and stage-managed  by Chauvelin. The ex-ambassador's humility, his offers of friendship,  his quietude under Sir Percy's good-humoured banter, everything was a  sham. Marguerite knew it; her womanly instinct, her passionate love, all  cried out to her in warning: but there was that in her husband's nature  which rendered her powerless in the face of such dangers, as, she felt  sure, were now threatening him.    Just before her guests had begun to assemble, she had been alone with  him for a few minutes. She had entered the room in which he sat, looking  radiantly beautiful in a shimmering gown of white and silver, with  diamonds in her golden hair and round her exquisite neck.    Moments like this, when she was alone with him, were the joy of her  life. Then and then only did she see him as he really was, with that  wistful tenderness in his deep-set eyes, that occasional flash  of passion from beneath the lazily-drooping lids. For a few  minutes--seconds, mayhap--the spirit of the reckless adventurer was laid  to rest, relegated into the furthermost background of this senses by the  powerful emotions of the lover.    Then he would seize her in his arms, and hold her to him, with a strange  longing to tear from out his heart all other thoughts, feelings and  passions save those which made him a slave to her beauty and her smiles.    \"Percy!\" she whispered to him to-night when freeing herself from his  embrace she looked up at him, and for this one heavenly second felt  him all her own. \"Percy, you will do nothing rash, nothing foolhardy  to-night. That man had planned all that took place yesterday. He hates  you, and ...\"    In a moment his face and attitude had changed, the heavy lids drooped  over the eyes, the rigidity of the mouth relaxed, and that quaint,  half-shy, half-inane smile played around the firm lips.    \"Of course he does, m'dear,\" he said in his usual affected, drawly  tones, \"of course he does, but that is so demmed amusing. He does not  really know"]]]
