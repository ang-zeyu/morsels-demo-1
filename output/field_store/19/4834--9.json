It is characterized by painless attacks of  vomiting, occurring immediately after food is taken, followed  by hunger, and recurring as soon as hunger is satisfied.    The name <i>Barcoo</i> is derived from the district traversed  by the river Barcoo, or Cooper, in which this complaint and the  <i>Barcoo Rot</i> are common.  See Dr. E. C.

An Australian  football term dating from about 1880.  The verb has been ruled  unparliamentary by the Speaker in the Victorian Legislative  Assembly.  It is, however, in very common colloquial use.  It  is from the aboriginal word <i>borak</i> (q.v.), and the sense  of jeering is earlier than that of supporting, but jeering at  one side is akin to cheering for the other.  Another suggested  derivation is from the Irish pronunciation of \"Bark,\" as  (according to the usually accepted view) \"Larrikin\" from  \"larking.\" But the former explanation is the more probable.  There is no connection with soldiers' \"barracks;\" nor is it  likely that there is any, as has been ingeniously suggested,  with the French word <i>baragouin</i>, gibberish.    1890.  `Melbourne Punch,' Aug. 14, p. 106, col. 3:    \"To use a football phrase, they all to a man `barrack' for the  British Lion.\"    1893.  `The Age,' June 17, p. 15, col. 4:    \"[The boy] goes much to football matches, where he barracks,  and in a general way makes himself intolerable.\"    1893.  `The Argus,' July 5, p. 9, col. 4, Legislative Assembly:    \"<i>Mr. Isaacs</i>:. . .

The physicians are men of  the highest scientific reputation: the nurses are trained assistants:  the food is the best that can be procured. The poorest man brought to  the hospital is treated with the same care, the same science, the same  luxuries as the richest.    Look, however, at the hospital as founded by Rahere.    There is a great hall with a chapel at one end: at which mass is daily  sung. The room is narrow and lofty, lit by Norman windows, two or three  on a side: there is a lanthorn in the roof: under the lanthorn a fire is  burning every day, the smoke rising to the roof: the hall is dark and  ill ventilated, the air foul and heavy with the breath of sixty or  seventy sick men lying in beds arranged in rows along the wall. There  are not separate beds for each patient, but as the sick are brought in  they are laid together side by side, in the same bed, whatever the  disease, so that he who suffers from fever is placed beside another who  suffers from palsy. There are four in a bed, and in times of pressure  even more. Sometimes one arrives who develops the plague, when the  whole of the patients in the hospital catch the infection and all die  together. The surgeons are especially skilled in the dressing of wounds  received in battle or in fray: the sisters can tie up a broken limb and  stop a bleeding wound. The brethren go about the beds administering the  last offices of the Church to the dying. The food is scanty: the  appliances are rude: there is small hope of recovery: yet to die in  hospital tended and consoled instead of in the hut where life has been  passed is something for which to be grateful.    [Illustration: THE UPPER CHAMBER OR SOLAR AT SUTTON COURTENAY  MANOR-HOUSE.    (_Date, about 1350._)]    Consider into how great, how noble a Foundation the little hospital of  Rahere has grown. The modern hospital contains 676 beds: it receives  about 150,000 patients every year, of whom 7,000 are inpatients, 18,000  out patients, and 130,000 casuals. The eight brethren have become 30  physicians and surgeons besides the assistants called clinical clerks  and dressers. The four sisters are now 159 sisters and nurses. There is  a noble school of medicine: there are museums, libraries, lecture rooms,  and there is a residential college for medical students: there is a  convalescent hospital in the country. No hospital in the world has a  larger or a more noble record than this of St. Bartholomew. And it all  sprang from the resolution of one man, who started a humble house for  the reception of the sick in a poor and despised place outside the City  wall, but near to the Shambles where one could beg for broken victuals  and for the pieces of meat that the butchers could not sell. Thus out of  one good deed, apparently of small importance, has grown a never-ending  stream of refreshment and healing. It has lasted for 700 years already:  there seems no reason why it should ever stop.          21. THE TERROR OF LEPROSY.      One mile outside the City walls, on the west, stood for four hundred  years the Hospital of St. Giles in the Fields.    Here was a Lazar House, i.e. a Hospital for Lepers. It was founded by  Maud, Queen of Henry I. It was dedicated to St. Giles because this saint  was considered the protector of cripples. Hence the name Cripplegate,  which really means the Little Gate, was applied to the church of St.  Giles, and supposed to mean the gate near the church dedicated to the  Patron Saint of Cripples. A common result of leprosy was to make the  sufferer lame and crippled. Hence the connection. Generally, however,  Lazarus, whom our Lord raised from the dead, was esteemed the Saint of  Lepers, whence a Leper's Hospital was always called a Lazar House.    In the middle ages the mysterious disease called leprosy was an ever  present terror. Other plagues appeared at intervals and disappeared.  Leprosy remained. It never left the land. It struck the King on his  Throne, the Bishop in his Cathedral, the Abbess in her Nunnery, the  soldier in camp, the merchant in his counting house, the sailor at sea.  No class could escape it. Robert Bruce died of it; Orivalle, Bishop of  London, died of it; Baldwin, King of Jerusalem, died of it. To this day  it prevails in India, at the Cape, in the Pacific Islands, while there  are occasional cases found in our own hospitals. The disease was  incurable: the man, woman, or child, attacked by it would surely and  slowly die of it. The leper was unclean: he was thrust out of the town:  he had to live apart, or congregated in hospitals with other wretches  similarly afflicted: if he walked abroad he wore a grey gown for  distinction and carried a clapper as he went along, crying 'Unclean,  Unclean,' so that the people might stand aside and not so much as touch  his garments. And since he could not work with his hands, he was  permitted to carry into the market a 'clap dish,' that is to say, a bowl  or basin in which to receive food and alms.[2]    [2] Lacroix, _Science_, p. 146.    Leprosy is supposed to have had its origin in Egypt: the laws laid down  in the Book of Leviticus for the separation of lepers are stringent and  precise: it was believed, partly, no doubt, on account of these statutes  in the Book of the Jewish Law, that the disease was brought into Western  Europe by the Crusaders; but this was erroneous, because it was in this  country before the Crusaders. Thus the Palace of St. James stands upon  the site of a lazar house founded before the Conquest for fourteen  leprous maidens.    This is not the place to describe the symptoms and the results of this  dreadful disease. Suffice it to say that the skin thickens, is  discoloured and ulcerates: that the limbs swell: that the fingers and  toes drop off: that the voice sinks to a whisper: and that the  sufferer's mind is weakened by his malady.    The fearful scourge was so prevalent that there was not a town, hardly a  village, in any country of Europe which had not, in those centuries, its  lepers and its lazar house, great or small. Every effort was made to  isolate them: they were not allowed to worship with the rest of the  people: they were provided with a separate building or chapel where,  through a hole in the wall, they could look on at the performance of  mass. And in addition, as you have seen, they lived apart and took their  food apart.    As for their houses--the lazar houses--the chief of them all, the place  where Abbot possessed some kind of authority over the others, was one  built in a village near Melton Mowbray called Burton Lazars. The  Hospital of St. Giles, for instance, became shortly after its foundation  a 'cell,' or dependency, of this House.    Whatever the cause of this malady, whether it be contagious, i.e.  communicated by touch; or infectious, that is, communicated by breathing  the same air; or hereditary; it is quite certain that it was greatly  aggravated by the habits of the time. Bad food, uncleanly habits, bad  air, all contributed to the spread of leprosy. Especially it has been  considered that the long fasts during which meat was prohibited  encouraged the disease: not because abstinence from meat is in itself a  bad thing, but because the people had to eat fish imperfectly cured or  kept too long, and unwholesome. Fresh-water fish could not be procured  in sufficient quantities and it was impossible to convey fish from the  sea more than a certain distance inland.    [Illustration: THE LEPERS BEGGING.]    The dreadful appearance of the lepers, their horrible sufferings,  produced loathing more than pity. People were horror stricken at the  sight of them: they drove them out of their sight: they punished them  cruelly if they broke the rules of separation: they imprisoned any  citizen who should harbour a leper: they kept bailiffs at the City gates  to keep them from entering. Fourteen of these afflicted persons were  required to be maintained in accordance with Queen Maud's Foundation by  the Hospital of St. Giles: there was also a lazar house in the Old Kent  Road, Southwark: one between Mile End and Bow: one at Kingsland between  Shoreditch and Stoke Newington: one at Knightsbridge, west of Charing  Cross, and one at Holloway.    On the Dissolution of the Monasteries, all these lazar houses were  suppressed. Now, since we hear very little more about lepers, and since  no new lazar houses were built, and since the prohibitions to enter  churches, towns, &c., are no more renewed, it is tolerably certain that  leprosy by the middle of the sixteenth century had practically  disappeared. The above will show, however, how great and terrible a  thing it was between the ninth and the sixteenth centuries.          22. THE TERROR OF FAMINE.      Suppose that all the ocean traffic were stopped; that there was no  communication, or exchange of commodities, between our country and  another; suppose that the people of this island depended entirely on  their own harvests and their own cattle for their support. You would  then easily understand how a single bad year might produce scarcity of  food, and a very bad year might produce a famine. That was our condition  down to the fifteenth century. Some corn may have been brought over from  Prussia or from Hamburg; but there was no regular supply; the country  depended on its own harvests. Therefore, the fear of a famine--or of  scarcity--was ever present to the people.    Many of"]]]
