How the instinctive wildness of the turkey crops out in the young! Let  the mother turkey while hovering her brood give the danger-signal, and  the young will run from under her and hide in the grass. Why? To give  her a chance to fly and decoy away the enemy. I think young chickens  will do the same. Young partridges hatched under a hen run away at  once. Pheasants in England reared under a domestic fowl are as wild as  in a state of nature. Some California quail hatched under a bantam hen  in the Zoo in New York did not heed the calls of their foster-mother  at all the first week, but at her alarm-note they instantly squatted,  showing that the danger-cry of a fowl is a kind of universal language  that all species understand. One may prove this at any time by  arousing the fears of any wild bird: how all the other birds catch the  alarm! Charles St. John says that in Scotland the stag you are  stalking is sure to be put to flight if it hears the alarm-cry of the  cock-grouse. You see it is more important that the wild creatures  should understand the danger-signals of one another than that they  should understand the rest of their language.    To what extent animals reason, or show any glimmering of what we call  reason, is a much-debated question among animal psychologists, and I  shall have more to say upon the subject later on. Dogs undoubtedly  show gleams of reason, and other animals in domestication, such as the  elephant and the monkey. One does not often feel like questioning  Darwin's conclusions, yet the incident of the caged bear which he  quotes, that pawed the water in front of its cage to create a current  that should float within its reach a piece of bread that had been  placed there, does not, in my judgment, show any reasoning about the  laws of hydrostatics. The bear would doubtless have pawed a cloth in  the same way, vaguely seeking to draw the bread within reach. But when  an elephant blows through his trunk upon the ground _beyond_ an object  which he wants, but which is beyond his reach, so that the rebounding  air will drive it toward him, he shows something very much like  reason.    Instinct is a kind of natural reason,--reason that acts without proof  or experience. The principle of life in organic nature seeks in all  ways to express and to perpetuate itself. It finds many degrees of  expression and fulfillment in the vegetable world; it finds higher  degrees of expression and fulfillment in the animal world, reaching  its highest development in man.    That the animals, except those that have been long associated with  man, and they only in occasional gleams and hints, are capable of any  of our complex mental processes, that they are capable of an act of  reflection, of connecting cause and effect, of putting this and that  together, is to me void of proof. Why, there are yet savage tribes in  which the woman is regarded as the sole parent of the child. When the  mother is sick at childbirth, the father takes to his bed and feigns  the illness he does not feel, in order to establish his relationship  to the child. It is not at all probable that the males of any species  of animals, or the females either, are guided or influenced in their  actions by the desire for offspring, or that they possess anything  like knowledge of the connection between their love-making and their  offspring. This knowledge comes of reflection, and reflection the  lower animals are not capable of. But I shall have more to say upon  this point in another chapter, entitled \"What do Animals Know?\" I will  only say here that animals are almost as much under the dominion of  absolute nature, or what we call instinct, innate tendency, habit of  growth, as are the plants and trees. Their lives revolve around three  wants or needs--the want of food, of safety, and of offspring. It is  in securing these ends that all their wit is developed. They have no  wants outside of these spheres, as man has. Their social wants and  their love of beauty, as in some of the birds, are secondary. It is  quite certain that the animals that store up food for the winter do  not take any thought of the future. Nature takes thought for them and  gives them their provident instinct. The jay, by his propensity to  carry away and hide things, plants many of our oak and chestnut trees,  but who dares say that he does this on purpose, any more than that the  insects cross-fertilize the flowers on purpose? Sheep do not take  thought of the wool upon their backs that is to protect them from the  cold of winter, nor does the fox of his fur. In the tropics sheep  cease to grow wool in three or four years.    All the lower animals, so far as I know, swim the first time they find  themselves in the water. They do not have to be taught: it is a matter  of instinct. It is what we should expect from our knowledge of their  lives. Not so with man; he must learn to swim as he learns so many  other things. The stimulus of the water does not at once set in motion  his legs and arms in the right way, as it does the animal's legs; his  powers of reason and reflection paralyze him--his brain carries him  down. Not until he has learned to resign himself to the water as the  animal does, and to go on all fours, can he swim. As soon as the boy  ceases to struggle against his tendency to sink, assumes the  horizontal position, and strikes out as the animal does, with but one  thought, and that to apply his powers of locomotion to the medium  about him, he swims as a matter of course. It is said that children  have sometimes been known to swim when thrown into the water. Their  animal instincts were not thwarted by their powers of reflection.  Doubtless this never happened to a grown person. Moreover, is it not  probable that the specific gravity of the hairless human body is  greater than that of the hair-covered animal, and that it sinks, while  that of the cat or dog floats? This, with the erect position of man,  makes swimming with him an art that must be acquired.    There is no better illustration of the action of instinct as opposed  to conscious intelligence than is afforded by the parasitic  birds,--the cuckoo in Europe and the cowbird in this country,--birds  that lay their eggs in the nests of other birds. Darwin speculates as  to how this instinct came about, but whatever may have been its  genesis, it is now a fixed habit among these birds. Moreover, the  instinct of the blind young alien, a day or two after it is hatched,  to throw or crowd its foster-brothers out of the nest is a strange and  anomalous act, and is as untaught and unreasoned as anything in  vegetable life. But when our yellow warbler, finding this strange egg  of the cowbird in her nest, proceeds to bury it by putting another  bottom in the nest and carrying up the sides to correspond, she shows  something very much like sense and judgment, though of a clumsy kind.  How much simpler and easier it would be to throw out the strange egg!  I have known the cowbird herself to carry an egg from a nest in which  she wished to deposit one of her own. Again, how stupid and ludicrous  it seems on the part of the mother sparrow, or warbler, or vireo, when  she goes about toiling desperately to satisfy the hunger of her big  clamorous bantling of a cowbird, never suspecting that she has been  imposed upon!    Of course the line that divides man from the lower orders is not a  straight line. It has many breaks and curves and deep indentations.  The man-like apes, as it were, mark where the line rises up into the  domain of man. Furthermore, the elephant and the dog, especially as we  know them in domestication, encroach upon man's territory.    Men are born with aptitudes for different things, but the art and the  science of them all they have to learn; proficiency comes with  practice. Man must learn to spin his web, to build his house, to sing  his song, to know his food, to sail his craft, to find his way--things  that the animals know \"from the jump.\" The animal inherits its  knowledge and its skill: man must acquire his by individual effort;  all he inherits is capacity in varying degrees for these things. The  animal does rational things without an exercise of reason. It is  intelligent as nature is intelligent. It does not know that it knows,  or how it knows, while man does. Man's knowledge is the light of his  mind that shines on many and widely different objects, while the  knowledge of animals cannot be symbolized by the term \"light\" at all.  The animal acts blindly so far as any conscious individual  illumination or act of judgment is concerned. It does the thing  unwittingly, because it must. Confront it with a new condition, and it  has no resources to meet that condition. The animal knows what  necessity taught its progenitors, and it knows that only as a  spontaneous impulse to do certain things.    Instinct, I say, is a great matter, and often shames reason. It adapts  means to an end, it makes few or no mistakes, it takes note of times  and seasons, it delves, it bores, it spins, it weaves, it sews, it  builds, it makes paper, it constructs a shelter, it navigates the air  and the water, it is provident and thrifty, it knows its enemies, it  outwits its foes, it crosses oceans and continents without compass, it  foreshadows nearly all the arts and trades and occupations of mankind,  it is skilled without practice, and wise without experience. How it  arose, what its genesis was, who can tell? Probably natural selection  has been the chief agent in its development. If natural selection has  developed and sharpened the claws of the cat and the scent of the  fox, why should it not develop and sharpen their wits also? The remote  ancestors of the fox or of the crow were doubtless less shrewd and  cunning than the crows and the foxes of to-day.

The burgher  to whom he gave money to purchase him another innocently brought him a  Boer sombrero.    Before his chance to escape came a month elapsed, and the opportunity  that then offered was less an opportunity to escape than to get himself  shot.    The State Model Schools were surrounded by the children's playgrounds,  penned in by a high wall, and at night, while they were used as a  prison, brilliantly lighted by electric lights. After many nights of  observation, Churchill discovered that while the sentries were pacing  their beats there was a moment when to them a certain portion of the  wall was in darkness. This was due to cross-shadows cast by the electric  lights. On the other side of this wall there was a private house set in  a garden filled with bushes. Beyond this was the open street.    To scale the wall was not difficult; the real danger lay in the fact  that at no time were the sentries farther away than fifteen yards, and  the chance of being shot by one or both of them was excellent. To a  brother officer Churchill confided his purpose, and together they agreed  that some night when the sentries had turned from the dark spot on the  wall they would scale it and drop among the bushes in the garden. After  they reached the garden, should they reach it alive, what they were to  do they did not know. How they were to proceed through the streets  and out of the city, how they were to pass unchallenged under its many  electric lights and before the illuminated shop windows, how to dodge  patrols, and how to find their way through two hundred and eighty  miles of a South African wilderness, through an utterly unfamiliar,  unfriendly, and sparsely settled country into Portuguese territory and  the coast, they left to chance. But with luck they hoped to cover the  distance in a fortnight, begging corn at the Kaffir kraals, sleeping by  day, and marching under cover of the darkness.    They agreed to make the attempt on the 11th of December, but on that  night the sentries did not move from the only part of the wall that was  in shadow. On the night following, at the last moment, something delayed  Churchill's companion, and he essayed the adventure alone. He writes:    \"Tuesday, the 12th! Anything was better than further suspense. Again  night came. Again the dinner bell sounded. Choosing my opportunity,  I strolled across the quadrangle and secreted myself in one of the  offices. Through a chink I watched the sentries. For half an hour they  remained stolid and obstructive. Then suddenly one turned and walked up  to his comrade and they began to talk. Their backs were turned.    \"I darted out of my hiding-place and ran to the wall, seized the top with  my hands and drew myself up. Twice I let myself down again in sickly  hesitation, and then with a third resolve scrambled up. The top was  flat. Lying on it, I had one parting glimpse of the sentries, still  talking, still with their backs turned, but, I repeat, still fifteen  yards away. Then I lowered myself into the adjoining garden and crouched  among the shrubs. I was free. The first step had been taken, and it was  irrevocable.\"    Churchill discovered that the house into the garden of which he had so  unceremoniously introduced himself was brilliantly lighted, and that the  owner was giving a party. At one time two of the guests walked into the  garden and stood, smoking and chatting, in the path within a few yards  of him.    Thinking his companion might yet join him, for an hour he crouched in  the bushes, until from the other side of the wall he heard the voices of  his friend and of another officer.    \"It's all up!\" his friend whispered. Churchill coughed tentatively.  The two voices drew nearer. To confuse the sentries, should they be  listening, the one officer talked nonsense, laughed loudly, and quoted  Latin phrases, while the other, in a low and distinct voice, said:  \"I cannot get out. The sentry suspects. It's all up. Can you get back  again?\"    To go back was impossible. Churchill now felt that in any case he was  sure to be recaptured, and decided he would, as he expresses it, at  least have a run for his money.    \"I shall go on alone,\" he whispered.    He heard the footsteps of his two friends move away from him across the  play yard. At the same moment he stepped boldly out into the garden and,  passing the open windows of the house, walked down the gravel path to  the street. Not five yards from the gate stood a sentry. Most of those  guarding the school-house knew him by sight, but Churchill did not turn  his head, and whether the sentry recognized him or not, he could not  tell.    For a hundred feet he walked as though on ice, inwardly shrinking as he  waited for the sharp challenge, and the rattle of the Mauser thrown to  the \"Ready.\" His nerves were leaping, his heart in his throat, his spine  of water. And then, as he continued to advance, and still no tumult  pursued him, he quickened his pace and turned into one of the main  streets of Pretoria. The sidewalks were crowded with burghers, but no  one noticed him. This was due probably to the fact that the Boers wore  no distinctive uniform, and that with them in their commandoes were many  English Colonials who wore khaki riding breeches, and many Americans,  French, Germans, and Russians, in every fashion of semi-uniform.    If observed, Churchill was mistaken for one of these, and the very  openness of his movements saved him from suspicion.    Straight through the town he walked until he reached the suburbs, the  open veldt, and a railroad track. As he had no map or compass he knew  this must be his only guide, but he knew also that two railroads left  Pretoria, the one along which he had been captured, to Pietermaritzburg,  and the other, the one leading to the coast and freedom. Which of the  two this one was he had no idea, but he took his chance, and a hundred  yards beyond a station waited for the first outgoing train. About  midnight, a freight stopped at the station, and after it had left it and  before it had again gathered headway, Churchill swung himself up upon  it, and stretched out upon a pile of coal. Throughout the night the  train continued steadily toward the east, and so told him that it was  the one he wanted, and that he was on his way to the neutral territory  of Portugal.    Fearing the daylight, just before the sun rose, as the train was pulling  up a steep grade, he leaped off into some bushes. All that day he lay  hidden, and the next night he walked. He made but little headway. As all  stations and bridges were guarded, he had to make long detours, and the  tropical moonlight prevented him from crossing in the open. In this way,  sleeping by day, walking by night, begging food from the Kaffirs, five  days passed.    Meanwhile, his absence had been at once discovered, and, by the  Boers, every effort was being made to retake him. Telegrams giving his  description were sent along both railways, three thousand photographs  of him were distributed, each car of every train was searched, and  in different parts of the Transvaal men who resembled him were being  arrested. It was said he had escaped dressed as a woman; in the uniform  of a Transvaal policeman whom he had bribed; that he had never left  Pretoria, and that in the disguise of a waiter he was concealed in the  house of a British sympathizer. On the strength of this rumor the houses  of all suspected persons were searched.    In the Volksstem it was pointed out as a significant fact that a week  before his escape Churchill had drawn from the library Mill's \"Essay on  Liberty.\"    In England and over all British South Africa the escape created as much  interest as it did in Pretoria. Because the attempt showed pluck, and  because he had outwitted the enemy, Churchill for the time became a sort  of popular hero, and to his countrymen his escape gave as much pleasure  as it was a cause of chagrin to the Boers.    But as days passed and nothing was heard of him, it was feared he  had lost himself in the Machadodorp Mountains, or had succumbed  to starvation, or, in the jungle toward the coast, to fever, and  congratulations gave way to anxiety.    The anxiety was justified, for at this time Churchill was in a very bad  way. During the month in prison he had obtained but little exercise. The  lack of food and of water, the cold by night and the terrific heat by  day, the long stumbling marches in the darkness, the mental effect upon  an extremely nervous, high-strung organization of being hunted, and of  having to hide from his fellow men, had worn him down to a condition  almost of collapse.    Even though it were neutral soil, in so exhausted a state he dared not  venture into the swamps and waste places of the Portuguese territory;  and, sick at heart as well as sick in body, he saw no choice left him  save to give himself up.    But before doing so he carefully prepared a tale which, although most  improbable, he hoped might still conceal his identity and aid him to  escape by train across the border.    One night after days of wandering he found himself on the outskirts of  a little village near the boundary line of the Transvaal and Portuguese  territory. Utterly unable to proceed further, he crawled to the nearest  zinc-roofed shack, and, fully prepared to surrender, knocked at the  door. It was opened by a rough-looking, bearded giant, the first white  man to whom in many days Churchill had dared address himself.    To him, without hope, he feebly stammered forth the speech he had  rehearsed. The man listened with every outward mark of disbelief. At  Churchill himself he stared with open suspicion. Suddenly he seized the  boy by the shoulder, drew him inside the hut, and barred the door.    \"You needn't lie to me,\" he said. \"You are Winston Churchill, and I--am  the only Englishman in this village.\"    The rest of the adventure was comparatively easy. The next night his"]]]
