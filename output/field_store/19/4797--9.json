He said: \"We charged three times with the bayonet,  and my gun was covered with whiskers and blood, though I don't remember  striking anybody, but I was nearly mad with excitement, shells bursting  and bullets whizzing round like hail. I was close behind the commanding  officer when he was wounded. He was shot and had to sit down, but he  cheered on his men. 'Forward, Gordons,' he cried, 'the world is looking  at you. Brave lads, give it to the beggars, exterminate the  vermin--charge.' He then started crying because he could no longer lead  his battalion, and he would not retire from the field until the day was  won. He is a fine man to lead a battalion--as brave as a lion. The  Gordons were the last line, and we raced through the Manchesters and the  Devons and the Light Horse Volunteers, all charging together.\"    Here we have a proof how much the morale of soldiers may be influenced  by their immediate chief.    The _Natal Advertiser_ in its account of the final scene said:--    \"By a quarter past six the Devonshire Regiment, the Gordon Highlanders,  and the Manchester Regiment, with the Imperial Light Horse, were in a  position to storm the Boer camp from the enemy's front and left flank,  and the signal for the bayonet charge was sounded. Then was witnessed  one of the most splendid pieces of storming imaginable, the Devons  taking the lead, closely followed by the Gordons, the Manchesters, and  the Light Horse, in the face of a tremendous, killing fire, the rattle  and roar of which betokened frightful carnage.... A bugler boy of the  5th Lancers shot three Boers with his revolver. He was afterwards  carried round the camp amid cheers.\"    So many acts of gallantry were performed that they cannot all be  related. It is impossible, however, to allow the wondrous pluck of  Sergeant Kenneth M'Leod to go unrecorded. During the charge this gallant  Scot was twice struck, once in the arm and once in the side. He however  continued to pipe and advance with the Gordons to their final rush.  Presently came more bullets, smashing his drones, his chanter, and his  windbag, whereupon the splendid fellow had to give in.    Perhaps the most heart-rending period was that following the last gleam  of daylight, when the Medical Staff went forth to do their melancholy  duty. All were armed with lanterns, which, shining like pale glow-worms,  made the dense gloom around more impenetrable still. Yet, groping and  shivering through the black horror of the night, they patiently pursued  their ghastly task with zeal that was truly magnificent. Dead, dying,  wounded, were dotted all over the veldt. There, bearded old Boers, boys,  Britons in their prime, were indiscriminately counted, collected,  tended, the Field Hospital men and Indian stretcher-bearers working  incessantly and ungrudgingly till dawn. Gruesome and heart-rending were  the sights and scenes around the camp-fires when such wounded as could  crawl dragged themselves towards their comrades. Pitiable the faces of  the survivors as news came in of gallant hearts that had ceased to beat.  A pathetic incident was witnessed in the grey gloom of the small hours.  One of the bearers chanced on an ancient hoary-headed Boer, who was  lying behind a rock supporting himself on his elbows. The bearer  approached warily, as many of the enemy were known to have turned on  those who went to their succour. This man, however, was too weak from  loss of blood to attempt to raise his rifle. Between his dying gasps he  begged a favour--would some one find his son, a boy of thirteen, who had  been fighting by his side when he fell. The request was obeyed. The  little lad, stone-dead, was discovered. He was placed in the failing  arms of his father. The unhappy old fellow clasped the clay-cold form,  and hugged it despairingly to himself, and then, merciful Providence  pitied him in his misery--his stricken spirit went out to join his son.    An officer who was wounded, and who spent the night in the terrible  scene, thus described his own awful experiences: \"I lay where I fell for  about three-quarters of an hour, when a doctor came and put a  field-dressing on my wound, gave me some brandy, put my helmet under my  head as a pillow, covered me with a Boer blanket which he had taken from  a dead man, and then went to look after some other poor beggar. I shall  never forget the horrors of that night as long as I live. In addition to  the agony which my wound gave me, I had two sharp stones running into my  back; I was soaked to the skin and bitterly cold, but had an awful  thirst; the torrents of rain never stopped. On one side of me was a  Gordon Highlander in raving delirium, and on the other a Boer who had  his leg shattered by a shell, and who gave vent to the most  heart-rending cries and groans. War is a funny game, and no one can  realise what its grim horrors are till they see it in all its barbarous  reality. I lay out in the rain the whole of the night, and at daybreak  was put into a doolie by a doctor, and some natives carried me down to  the station. The ground was awfully rough, and they dropped me twice; I  fainted both times. I was sent down to Ladysmith in the hospital train;  from the station I was conveyed to the chapel (officers' hospital) in a  bullock-cart, the jolting of which made me faint again. I was the last  officer taken in. I was then put to bed, and my wound was dressed just  seventeen hours after I was hit. They then gave me some beef-tea, which  was the first food I had had for twenty-seven hours.\"    The amazing spirit of chivalry that animated all classes, general  officers, medical officers, chaplains, and even stretcher-bearers, in  this campaign has been the subject of much comment. It was thought that  modernity had rendered effete some of the sons of Great Britain, and the  war, if it should have done no other good, has served to prove that  times may have changed, but not the tough and dauntless character of the  men who have made the Empire what it is.    The following, from a Congregational minister of Durban, who had  volunteered to go to the front as honorary chaplain to the Natal Mounted  Rifles, in which corps many of his congregation enrolled, is of immense  interest. It gives us an insight into the inner core of valour--the  valour of those who, unarmed, share the dangers without the  intoxications of the fight. It runs:--         \"The Lancers, who were mistaken by the Boers in the growing       darkness for a body of their own men, fell upon them and turned       a rout into a wild flight. Commander Schiel was very furious at       losing the battle, and said he would like to kill every man,       woman, and child in Natal. In this he was the exception to the       rule, for the captives whom we liberated said the Boers had       treated them with great kindness. After the battle Dr.       Bonnybrook and I spent the night on the field of battle, and       also followed the retreating Boers for a distance of six or       seven miles, searching for and tending the wounded and dying.       In the early hours of the morning we came to a Boer       field-hospital, and shouting out, 'Doctor and Predicant,' we       entered and rested, and slept there awhile. By daybreak we were       out again. About six miles from camp Dr. Bonnybrook rode up to       twenty-five mounted and armed Boers, and told them they were       his prisoners. Ordering two to take the weapons of their       comrades, he marched them into camp prisoners. For an unarmed       man to accomplish alone, this was an exceedingly brave thing to       do. After the battle one of the captured held up his gun and       said, 'Look through this. I have not fired a shot. I am a       Britisher. They forced me to come.'\"    Among other heroes of Elandslaagte was Lieutenant Meiklejohn of the  Gordon Highlanders. This young officer, one of the \"Dargai boys,\" helped  the charge in an endeavour to embarrass the Boer flank. Supported by a  party of Gordons, so runs the narrative, Meiklejohn waved his sword and  cried out to his party hastily gathered round him. But the Boer ranks  were alert, and poured in a deadly fire on the gallant band. Lieutenant  Meiklejohn received three bullets through his upper right arm, one  through the right forearm, a finger blown away, a bullet through the  left thigh, two bullets through the helmet, a \"snick\" in the neck, while  his sword and scabbard were literally shot to pieces. He has by now lost  his right arm, but, happily, being left-handed, it is hoped he may  remain in the profession he is so well calculated to adorn.    A private soldier in the 2nd Battalion Gordon Highlanders recounted an  extraordinary personal experience. He said:--         \"We, the Devons, Imperial Light Horse, and others, had a fight       at Elandslaagte with the Boers, and I never enjoyed myself so       much before. You first have to get christened to fire, and then       you think nothing of the shells bursting about you, and the       bullets which go whistling past like bees. We went forward by       fifty-yard rushes, and at every rush you could hear a groan,       and down would go one of our comrades, either killed or       wounded, poor chap. When we were miles from the enemy they       opened fire on us with shell, and as we were going along in       mass, one of the shells burst on the left of the company, and       one of our men of my section--Bobby Hall--got shot dead with a       piece of the shell going straight through his head. That was       what made more than one wish to turn and run. But what would       Britain do if her soldiers ran from the enemy? At last we got       to where we could get a shot at the Boers with our rifles, and       you may bet we gave them more than one,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26323"],[0,"The Suffrage Cook Book (#12)"],[1,"Cake              1 cake compressed Yeast            1/4 lb.

STATE OF CALIFORNIA                           EXECUTIVE MANSION              Since its adoption in October, 1911, equal            suffrage in California has been put to the most            thorough and severe test. Every conceivable sort            of election has been held in the past three years,            and women have been called upon to exercise their            new privilege and perform their added duty not            alone in the usual fashion, but in various            primaries, including one for presidential            preference, in local option elections, and they            have been compelled to pass on laws and            governmental policies presented to the electorate            by the initiative and referendum.              The women have met the test and equal suffrage in            California has fully justified itself. In nineteen            eleven, by a very narrow margin the amendment            carried.              Were it to be again submitted, the vote in its            favor would be overwhelming.

Beat well and add the raisins, dredge with a little flour; now add  sponge and beat all thoroughly for 1/2 hour till it drops from the spoon  a little thicker than a sweet cake.    Grease your pan with butter and take the split almonds and stick them on  the side of the pan. Bake nearly an hour.    This makes 2 small cakes or one large one. Very fine German Coffee Cake.  You should use a pan with a tube in the center.

Mix and sift flour and baking powder and add  alternately with milk to first mixture.      Pineapple Cake              1 egg            1/2 cup butter            3/4 cup sugar            3/4 cup milk            1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder            1 1/2 cups flour    Make in two layers and when ready to serve put grated pineapple on each  layer of cake. Whip half a pint of cream, sweeten to taste and put over  pineapples.    (Bananas can be used instead of pineapples).      Ginger Cookies              3 lbs. flour            1 lb. butter and lard mixed            1 lb. brown sugar            1 pint molasses            1 good sized teaspoon of soda or 2 level ones.    Add ginger to taste--about 4 level teaspoons, also lemon extract or  grated rind and juice if preferred.    Put flour, sugar and butter together and rub thoroughly. Make hole in  center and pour in the molasses in which the soda has been beaten in.  Stir all well together, break off enough to roll out; cut, space in pan  and bake in very moderate oven.    These keep well, especially in stone crock. This recipe makes a quantity  if cut with small cutter.      Pound Cake              1 lb. flour            1 lb. pulverized sugar            flavoring            1 lb. butter            10 eggs    Cream butter and sugar to finest possible consistency. Add 1/4 of the  flour and beat well. Have eggs beaten to a froth. Add a few tablespoons  at a time and beat thoroughly after each addition of egg. When eggs are  all in, add balance of flour and flavoring and beat.    Bake in a slow oven one and one-half hours.    Hints:--Secret of fine pound cake is in the mixing, much beating being  essential.    One-half the recipe serves fifteen persons amply.    A paler yellow cake can be had by substituting the whites of two eggs  for every yolk discarded.    In the full recipe not more than four yolks should be discarded.    A very little lemon combined with vanilla or almond, improves the flavor  of the cake.    Bake, if possible, in an old-fashioned tin pan with a center tube.

Then stir in flour with baking powder added.    Do not roll too thin.    Have lard boiling when you drop in the doughnuts. A slice of raw potato  in the lard will prevent the lard taste.
