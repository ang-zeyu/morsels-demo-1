We traverse a few more trillion miles in our rapid  course, and it shines out like a fine star of the first magnitude. It  grows larger and larger. Soon we divine that it is our humble Earth that  is shining before us, and gladly alight upon her. In future we shall not  quit our own province of the Celestial Kingdom, but will enter into  relations with this solar family, which interests us the more in that it  affects us so closely.    [Illustration: FIG. 28.--Comparative sizes of the Sun and Earth.]    The Sun, which is manifested to us as a fine white disk at noon, while  it is fiery red in the evening, at its setting, is an immense globe,  whose colossal dimensions surpass those of our terrestrial atom beyond  all conceivable proportion.    In diameter, it is, in effect, 108-1/2 times as large as the Earth; that  is to say, if our planet be represented by a globe 1 meter in diameter,  the Sun would figure as a sphere 108-1/2 meters across. This is shown on  the accompanying figure (Fig. 28), which is in exact proportion.    If our world were set down upon the Sun, with all its magnificence, all  its wealth, its mountains, its seas, its monuments, and its inhabitants,  it would only be an imperceptible speck. It would occupy less space in  the central orb than one grain in a grenade. If the Earth were placed in  the center of the Sun, with the Moon still revolving round it at her  proper distance of 384,000 kilometers (238,500 miles), only half the  solar surface would be covered.    In volume the Sun is 1,280,000 times vaster than our abode, and 324,000  times heavier in mass. That the giant only appears to us as a small  though very brilliant disk, is solely on account of its distance. Its  apparent dimensions by no means reveal its majestic proportions to us.    When observed with astronomical instruments, or photographed, we  discover that its surface is not smooth, as might be supposed, but  granulated, presenting a number of luminous points dispersed over a  more somber background. These granulations are somewhat like the pores  of a fruit, _e.g._, a fine orange, the color of which recalls the hue of  the Sun when it sinks in the evening, and prepares to plunge us into  darkness. At times these pores open under the influence of disturbances  that arise upon the solar surface, and give birth to a Sun-Spot. For  centuries scientists and lay people alike refused to admit the existence  of these spots, regarding them as so many blemishes upon the King of the  Heavens. Was not the Sun the emblem of inviolable purity? To find any  defect in him were to do him grievous injury. Since the orb of day was  incorruptible, those who threw doubt on his immaculate splendor were  fools and idiots. And so when Scheiner, one of the first who studied the  solar spots with the telescope, published the result of his experiments  in 1610, no one would believe his statements.    Yet, from the observations of Galileo and other astronomers, it became  necessary to accept the evidence, and stranger still to recognize that  it is by these very spots that we are enabled to study the physical  constitution of the Sun.    They are generally rounded or oval in shape, and exhibit two distinct  parts; first, the central portion, which is black, and is called the  _nucleus_, or _umbra_; second, a clearer region, half shaded, which has  received the name of _penumbra_. These parts are sharply defined in  outline; the penumbra is gray, the nucleus looks black in relation to  the dazzling brilliancy of the solar surface; but as a matter of fact it  radiates a light 2,000 times superior in intensity to that of the full  moon.    [Illustration: FIG. 29.--Direct photograph of the Sun.]    Some idea of the aspect of these spots may be obtained from the  accompanying reproduction of a photograph of the Sun (taken September 8,  1898, at the author's observatory at Juvisy), and from the detailed  drawing of the large spot that broke out some days later (September 13),  crossed by a bridge, and furrowed with flames. As a rule, the spots  undergo rapid transformations.    [Illustration: FIG. 30.--Telescopic aspect of a Sun-Spot.]    These spots, which appear of insignificant dimensions to the observers  on the Earth, are in reality absolutely gigantic. Some that have been  measured are ten times as large as the Earth's diameter, _i.e._, 120,000  kilometers (74,500 miles).    Sometimes the spots are so large that they can be seen with the unaided  eye (protected with black or dark-blue glasses). They are not formed  instantaneously, but are heralded by a vast commotion on the solar  surface, exhibiting, as it were, luminous waves or _faculae_. Out of this  agitation arises a little spot, that is usually round, and enlarges  progressively to reach a maximum, after which it diminishes, with  frequent segmentation and shrinkage. Some are visible only for a few  days; others last for months. Some appear, only to be instantly  swallowed in the boiling turmoil of the flaming orb. Sometimes, again,  white incandescent waves emerge, and seem to throw luminous bridges  across the central umbra. As a rule the spots are not very profound.  They are funnel-shaped depressions, inferior in depth to the diameter of  the Earth, which, as we have seen, is 108 times smaller than that of the  Sun.           *       *       *       *       *    The Sun-Spots are not devoid of motion, and from their movements we  learn that the radiant orb revolves upon itself in about twenty-five  days. This rotation was determined in 1611, by Galileo, who, while  observing the spots, saw that they traversed the solar disk from east  to west, following lines that are oblique to the plane of the ecliptic,  and that they disappear at the western border fourteen days after their  arrival at the eastern edge. Sometimes the same spot, after being  invisible for fourteen days, reappears upon the eastern edge, where it  was observed twenty-eight days previously. It progresses toward the  center of the Sun, which is reached in seven days, disappears anew in  the west, and continues its journey on the hemisphere opposed to us, to  reappear under observation two weeks later, if it has not meantime been  extinguished. This observation proves that the Sun revolves upon itself.  The reappearance of the spots occurs in about twenty-seven days, because  the Earth is not stationary, and in its movement round the burning  focus, a motion effected in the same direction as the solar rotation,  the spots are still visible two and a half days after they disappeared  from the point at which they had been twenty-five days previously. In  reality, the rotation of the Sun occupies twenty-five and a half days,  but strangely enough this globe _does not rotate in one uniform period_,  like the Earth; the rotation periods, or movements of the different  parts of the solar surface, diminish from the Sun's equator toward its  poles. The period is twenty-five days at the equator, twenty-six at the  twenty-fourth degree of latitude, north or south, twenty-seven at the  thirty-seventh degree, twenty-eight at the forty-eighth. The spots are  usually formed between the equator and this latitude, more especially  between the tenth and thirtieth degrees. They have never been seen round  the poles.    Toward the edges of the Sun, again, are very brilliant and highly  luminous regions, which generally surround the spots, and have been  termed _faculae_ (_facula_, a little torch). These faculae, which  frequently occupy a very extensive surface, seem to be the seat of  formidable commotions that incessantly revolutionize the face of our  monarch, often, as we said, preceding the spots. They can be detected  right up to the poles.    Our Sun, that appears so calm and majestic, is in reality the seat of  fierce conflagrations. Volcanic eruptions, the most appalling storms,  the worst cataclysms that sometimes disturb our little world, are gentle  zephyrs compared with the solar tempests that engender clouds of fire  capable at one burst of engulfing globes of the dimensions of our  planet.    To compare terrestrial volcanoes with solar eruptions is like comparing  the modest night-light that consumes a midge with the flames of the fire  that destroys a town.    The solar spots vary in a fairly regular period of eleven to twelve  years. In certain years, _e.g._, 1893, they are vast, numerous and  frequent; in other years, _e.g._, 1901, they are few and insignificant.  The statistics are very carefully preserved. Here, for instance, is the  surface showing sun-spots expressed in millionths of the extent of the  visible solar surface:              1889            78            1890            99            1891           569            1892         1,214            1893         1,464            1895           974            1896           543            1897           514            1898           375            1899           111            1900            75            1901            29            1902            62    The years 1889 and 1901 were _minima_; the year 1893 a _maximum_.    It is a curious fact that terrestrial magnetism and the boreal auroras  exhibit an oscillation parallel to that of the solar spots, and  apparently the same occurs with regard to temperature.    We must regard our sun as a globe of gas in a state of combustion,  burning at high temperature, and giving off a prodigious amount of heat  and light. The dazzling surface of this globe is called a _photosphere_  (light sphere). It is in perpetual motion, like the waves of an ocean of  fire, whose roseate and transparent flames measure some 15,000  kilometers (9,300 miles) in height. This stratum of rose-colored flames  has received the name of _chromosphere_ (color sphere). It is  transparent; it is not directly visible, but is seen"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2527"],[0,"The Sorrows of Young Werther (#12)"],[1," do not possess, attributing to them  also all that we enjoy ourselves, that by this process we form the idea  of a perfect, happy man,--a man, however, who only exists in our own  imagination.    But when, in spite of weakness and disappointments, we set to work in  earnest, and persevere steadily, we often find, that, though obliged  continually to tack, we make more way than others who have the  assistance of wind and tide; and, in truth, there can be no greater  satisfaction than to keep pace with others or outstrip them in the race.    November 26.    I begin to find my situation here more tolerable, considering all  circumstances. I find a great advantage in being much occupied; and the  number of persons I meet, and their different pursuits, create a varied  entertainment for me. I have formed the acquaintance of the Count  C--and I esteem him more and more every day. He is a man of strong  understanding and great discernment; but, though he sees farther than  other people, he is not on that account cold in his manner, but capable  of inspiring and returning the warmest affection. He appeared interested  in me on one occasion, when I had to transact some business with him. He  perceived, at the first word, that we understood each other, and that  he could converse with me in a different tone from what he used with  others. I cannot sufficiently esteem his frank and open kindness to me.  It is the greatest and most genuine of pleasures to observe a great mind  in sympathy with our own.    DECEMBER 24.    As I anticipated, the ambassador occasions me infinite annoyance. He is  the most punctilious blockhead under heaven. He does everything step by  step, with the trifling minuteness of an old woman; and he is a man whom  it is impossible to please, because he is never pleased with himself. I  like to do business regularly and cheerfully, and, when it is finished,  to leave it. But he constantly returns my papers to me, saying, \"They  will do,\" but recommending me to look over them again, as \"one may  always improve by using a better word or a more appropriate particle.\"  I then lose all patience, and wish myself at the devil's. Not a  conjunction, not an adverb, must be omitted: he has a deadly antipathy  to all those transpositions of which I am so fond; and, if the music  of our periods is not tuned to the established, official key, he cannot  comprehend our meaning. It is deplorable to be connected with such a  fellow.    My acquaintance with the Count C--is the only compensation for such an  evil. He told me frankly, the other day, that he was much displeased  with the difficulties and delays of the ambassador; that people like him  are obstacles, both to themselves and to others. \"But,\" added he, \"one  must submit, like a traveller who has to ascend a mountain: if the  mountain was not there, the road would be both shorter and pleasanter;  but there it is, and he must get over it.\"    The old man perceives the count's partiality for me: this annoys him,  and, he seizes every opportunity to depreciate the count in my hearing.  I naturally defend him, and that only makes matters worse. Yesterday he  made me indignant, for he also alluded to me. \"The count,\" he said, \"is  a man of the world, and a good man of business: his style is good,  and he writes with facility; but, like other geniuses, he has no solid  learning.\" He looked at me with an expression that seemed to ask if I  felt the blow. But it did not produce the desired effect: I despise a  man who can think and act in such a manner. However, I made a stand, and  answered with not a little warmth. The count, I said, was a man entitled  to respect, alike for his character and his acquirements. I had never  met a person whose mind was stored with more useful and extensive  knowledge,--who had, in fact, mastered such an infinite variety of  subjects, and who yet retained all his activity for the details of  ordinary business. This was altogether beyond his comprehension; and I  took my leave, lest my anger should be too highly excited by some new  absurdity of his.    And you are to blame for all this, you who persuaded me to bend my  neck to this yoke by preaching a life of activity to me. If the man who  plants vegetables, and carries his corn to town on market-days, is not  more usefully employed than I am, then let me work ten years longer at  the galleys to which I am now chained.    Oh, the brilliant wretchedness, the weariness, that one is doomed  to witness among the silly people whom we meet in society here! The  ambition of rank! How they watch, how they toil, to gain precedence!  What poor and contemptible passions are displayed in their utter  nakedness! We have a woman here, for example, who never ceases to  entertain the company with accounts of her family and her estates. Any  stranger would consider her a silly being, whose head was turned by  her pretensions to rank and property; but she is in reality even  more ridiculous, the daughter of a mere magistrate's clerk from this  neighbourhood. I cannot understand how human beings can so debase  themselves.    Every day I observe more and more the folly of judging of others by  ourselves; and I have so much trouble with myself, and my own heart is  in such constant agitation, that I am well content to let others pursue  their own course, if they only allow me the same privilege.    What provokes me most is the unhappy extent to which distinctions of  rank are carried. I know perfectly well how necessary are inequalities  of condition, and I am sensible of the advantages I myself derive  therefrom; but I would not have these institutions prove a barrier to  the small chance of happiness which I may enjoy on this earth.    I have lately become acquainted with a Miss B--, a very agreeable girl,  who has retained her natural manners in the midst of artificial life.  Our first conversation pleased us both equally; and, at taking leave,  I requested permission to visit her. She consented in so obliging a  manner, that I waited with impatience for the arrival of the happy  moment. She is not a native of this place, but resides here with her  aunt. The countenance of the old lady is not prepossessing. I paid her  much attention, addressing the greater part of my conversation to her;  and, in less than half an hour, I discovered what her niece subsequently  acknowledged to me, that her aged aunt, having but a small fortune, and  a still smaller share of understanding, enjoys no satisfaction except  in the pedigree of her ancestors, no protection save in her noble birth,  and no enjoyment but in looking from her castle over the heads of the  humble citizens. She was, no doubt, handsome in her youth, and in her  early years probably trifled away her time in rendering many a poor  youth the sport of her caprice: in her riper years she has submitted  to the yoke of a veteran officer, who, in return for her person and her  small independence, has spent with her what we may designate her age of  brass. He is dead; and she is now a widow, and deserted. She spends her  iron age alone, and would not be approached, except for the loveliness  of her niece.    JANUARY 8, 1772.    What beings are men, whose whole thoughts are occupied with form and  ceremony, who for years together devote their mental and physical  exertions to the task of advancing themselves but one step, and  endeavouring to occupy a higher place at the table. Not that such  persons would otherwise want employment: on the contrary, they give  themselves much trouble by neglecting important business for such petty  trifles. Last week a question of precedence arose at a sledging-party,  and all our amusement was spoiled.    The silly creatures cannot see that it is not place which constitutes  real greatness, since the man who occupies the first place but  seldom plays the principal part. How many kings are governed by their  ministers--how many ministers by their secretaries? Who, in such cases,  is really the chief? He, as it seems to me, who can see through the  others, and possesses strength or skill enough to make their power or  passions subservient to the execution of his own designs.    JANUARY 20.    I must write to you from this place, my dear Charlotte, from a small  room in a country inn, where I have taken shelter from a severe storm.  During my whole residence in that wretched place D--, where I lived  amongst strangers,--strangers, indeed, to this heart,--I never at any  time felt the smallest inclination to correspond with you; but in this  cottage, in this retirement, in this solitude, with the snow and hail  beating against my lattice-pane, you are my first thought. The instant  I entered, your figure rose up before me, and the remembrance! O my  Charlotte, the sacred, tender remembrance! Gracious Heaven! restore to  me the happy moment of our first acquaintance.    Could you but see me, my dear Charlotte, in the whirl of  dissipation,--how my senses are dried up, but my heart is at no time  full. I enjoy no single moment of happiness: all is vain--nothing  touches me. I stand, as it were, before the raree-show: I see the little  puppets move, and I ask whether it is not an optical illusion. I am  amused with these puppets, or, rather, I am myself one of them: but,  when I sometimes grasp my neighbour's hand, I feel that it is not  natural; and I withdraw mine with a shudder. In the evening I say I will  enjoy the next morning's sunrise, and yet I remain in bed: in the day I  promise to ramble by moonlight; and I, nevertheless, remain at home. I  know not why I rise, nor why I go to sleep.    The leaven which animated my existence is gone: the charm which cheered  me in the gloom of night, and aroused me from my morning slumbers, is  for ever fled.    I have found but one being here to interest me, a Miss B--. She  resembles you, my dear Charlotte, if any one can possibly resemble you.  \"Ah!\" you will say, \"he has"]]]
