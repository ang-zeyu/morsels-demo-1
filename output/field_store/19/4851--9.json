This process is repeated several times; and at last when  the final sliver comes out, although it looks almost the same as when  it came from the carding-machine, its fibers are parallel. It is much  more uniform, but it is very fragile, and still has to be handled  with great care. It is not nearly strong enough to be twisted into  thread; and before this can be done, it must pass through three other  machines. The first, or \"slubber,\" gives it a very slight twist, just  enough to suggest what is coming later, and of course in doing this  makes it smaller. The cotton changes its name at every operation, and  now it is called \"roving.\" It has taken one long step forward, for  now it is not coiled up in cans, but is wound on \"bobbins,\" or great  spools. The second machine, the \"intermediate speeder,\" twists it a  very little more and winds it on fresh bobbins. It also puts two  rovings together, so that if one happens to be thin in one place,  there is a chance for it to be strengthened by a thicker place in  the other. The third machine, the \"fine speeder,\" simply makes a  finer roving.    All this work must be done merely to prepare the raw cotton to be  twisted into the tiny threads that you see by raveling a piece of  cotton cloth. Now comes the actual twisting. If you fasten one end  of a very soft string and twist the other and wind it on a spool, you  will get a spool of finer, stronger, and harder-twisted string than  you had at first. This is exactly what the \"ring-spinner\" does.  Imagine a bobbin full of roving standing on a frame. Down below it are  some rolls between which the thread from the bobbin passes to a second  bobbin which is fast on a spindle. Around this spindle is the  \"spinning-ring,\" a ring which is made to whirl around by an endless  belt. This whirling twists the thread, and another part of the machine  winds it upon the second bobbin. Hundreds of these ring-spinners and  bobbins are on a single \"spinning-frame\" and accomplish a great deal  in a very short time. The threads that are to be used for the \"weft\"  or \"filling\" go directly into the shuttles of the weavers after being  spun; but those which are to be used for \"warp\" are wound first on  spools, then on beams to go into the loom.    Little children weave together strips of paper, straws, and  splints,--\"over one, under one,\"--and the weaving of plain cotton  cloth is in principle nothing more than this. The first thing to do  in weaving is to stretch out the warp evenly. This warp is simply  many hundreds of tiny threads as long as the cloth is to be,  sometimes forty or fifty yards. They must be stretched out side by  side and close together. To make them regular, they are passed  between the teeth of a sort of upright comb; then they are wound upon  the loom beam, a horizontal beam at the back of the loom. Here they  are as close together as they will be in the cloth. With a magnifying  glass it is easy to count the threads of the warp in an inch of  cloth. Some kinds of cloth have a hundred or even more to the inch.  In order to make cloth, the weaver must manage in some way to lower  every other one of these little threads and run his shuttle over  them, as the children do the strips of paper in their paper weaving.  Then he must lower the other set and run the shuttle over _them_.  \"Drawing in\" makes this possible. After the threads leave the beam,  they are drawn through the \"harnesses.\" These are hanging frames, one  in front of the other, filled with stiff, perpendicular threads or  wires drawn tight, and with an eye in each thread. Through these eyes  the threads of the warp are drawn, the odd ones through one, and the  even through the other. Then, keeping the threads in the same order,  they pass through the teeth of a \"reed,\"--that is, a hanging frame  shaped like a great comb as long as the loom is wide; and last, they  are fastened to the \"front beam,\" which runs in front of the weaver's  seat and on which the cloth is to be rolled when it has been woven.  Each harness is connected with a treadle. The weaver puts his foot on  the treadle of the odd threads and presses them down. Then he sends  his shuttle, containing a bobbin full of thread, sliding across over  the odd threads and under the even. He puts his foot on the treadle  of the even threads and sends the shuttle back over the even and  under the odd. At each trip of the shuttle, the heavy reed is drawn  back toward the weaver to push the last thread of the woof or filling  firmly into place.    This is the way cloth is woven in the hand looms which used to be in  every household. The power loom used in factories is, even in its  simplest form, a complicated machine; but its principle is exactly the  same. If colors are to be used, great care is needed in arranging warp  and woof. If you ravel a piece of checked gingham, you will see that  half the warp is white and half colored; and that in putting in the  woof or filling, a certain number of the threads are white and an  equal number are colored. If you look closely at the weaving of a  tablecloth, you will see that the satin-like figures are woven by  bringing the filling thread not \"over one and under one,\" but often  over two or three and under one. In drilling or any other twilled  goods, several harnesses have to be used because the warp thread is  not lowered directly in line with the one preceding, but diagonally.  Such work as this used to require a vast amount of skill and patience;  but the famous Jacquard machine will do it with ease, and will do more  complicated weaving than any one ever dreamed of before its invention,  for it will weave not only regular figures extending across the cloth,  but can be made to introduce clusters of flowers, a figure, or a face  wherever it is desired. By the aid of this, every little warp thread  or cluster of threads can be lifted by its own hooked wire without  interfering with any other thread. Cards of paper or thin metal are  made for each pattern, leaving a hole wherever the hook is to slip  through and lift up a thread. After the cards are once made, the work  is as easy as plain weaving; but there must be a separate card for  every thread of filling in the pattern, and sometimes a single design  has required as many as thirty thousand pattern cards.    The machines in a cotton mill are the result of experimenting, lasting  through many years. They do not seem quite so \"human\" as those which  help to carry on some parts of other manufactures; but they are  wonderfully ingenious. For instance, the sliver is so light that it  seems to have hardly any weight, but it balances a tiny support. If  the sliver breaks, the support falls, and this stops the machine.  Again, if one of the threads of the warp breaks when it is being wound  on the beam, a slender bent wire that has been hung on it falls. It  drops between two rollers and stops them. Then the workman knows that  something is wrong, and a glance will show where attention is needed.  Success in a cotton mill demands constant attention to details. A mill  manager who has been very successful has given to those of less  experience some wise directions about running a mill. For one thing,  he reminds them that building is expensive and that floor space  counts. If by rearranging looms space can be made for more spindles,  it is well worth while to rearrange. He tells them to study their  machines and see whether they are working so slowly that they cannot  do as much as possible, or so fast as to strain the work. He bids them  to keep their gearings clean, to be clear and definite in their  orders, and to read the trade papers; but above everything else to  look out for the little things, a little leak in the mill dam, a  little too much tightness in a belt, or the idleness of just one  spindle. Herein lies, he says, one of the great differences between  a successful and an unsuccessful superintendent.    Weaving as practiced in factories is a complicated business; but  whether it is done with a simple hand loom in a cottage or with a big  power loom in a great factory, there are always three movements. One  separates the warp threads; one drives the shuttle between them; and  one swings the reed against the filling thread just put in.          XI    SILKWORMS AND THEIR WORK      About silk there is something particularly agreeable. There are few  people who do not like the sheen of a soft silk, the sparkle of light  on a \"taffeta,\" and the richness of the silk that \"can stand alone.\"  Its delicate rustle is charming, and the \"feel\" of it is a delight.  It has not the chill of linen, the deadness of cotton, or the  \"scratchiness\" of woolen. It pleases the eye, the ear, and the touch.    The caterpillars of a few butterflies and of many moths are spinners  of fibers similar to silk. Among these last is the beautiful  pale-green lunar moth. Spiders spin a lustrous fiber, and it is said  that a lover of spiders succeeded, by a good deal of petting and  attention, in getting considerable material from a company of them.  Silkworms, however, are the only providers of real silk for the world.  Once in a while glowing accounts are published of the ease with which  they can be raised and the amount of money which can be made from them  with very small capital. This business, however, like all other kinds  of business, requires close attention and skill if it is to be a  success. An expert has said that it needs more time to build a spool  of silk than a locomotive.    The way to begin to raise silkworms is first of all to provide  something for them to eat. They are very particular about their bill  of fare. The leaf of the osage orange will answer, but they like much  better the leaf of the white mulberry. Then send to a reliable dealer  for a quarter of an ounce of silkworm eggs.

The next solar eclipse worthy of note was an annular one, and occurred  in 431 B.C., the first year of the Peloponnesian War. Plutarch relates  that the pilot of the ship, which was about to convey Pericles to the  Peloponnesus, was very much frightened by it; but Pericles calmed him by  holding up a cloak before his eyes, and saying that the only difference  between this and the eclipse was that something larger than the cloak  prevented his seeing the sun for the time being.    An eclipse of great historical interest is that known as the \"Eclipse of  Agathocles,\" which occurred on the morning of the 15th of August, 310  B.C. Agathocles, Tyrant of Syracuse, had been blockaded in the harbour  of that town by the Carthaginian fleet, but effected the escape of his  squadron under cover of night, and sailed for Africa in order to invade  the enemy's territory. During the following day he and his vessels  experienced a total eclipse, in which \"day wholly put on the appearance  of night, and the stars were seen in all parts of the sky.\"    A few solar eclipses are supposed to be referred to in early Roman  history, but their identity is very doubtful in comparison with those  which the Greeks have recorded. Additional doubt is cast upon them by  the fact that they are usually associated with famous events. The birth  and death of Romulus, and the Passage of the Rubicon by Julius Caesar,  are stated indeed to have been accompanied by these marks of the  approval or disapproval of the gods!    Reference to our subject in the Bible is scanty. Amos viii. 9 is thought  to refer to the Nineveh eclipse of 763 B.C., to which allusion has  already been made; while the famous episode of Hezekiah and the shadow  on the dial of Ahaz has been connected with an eclipse which was partial  at Jerusalem in 689 B.C.    The first solar eclipse, recorded during the Christian Era, is known as  the \"Eclipse of Phlegon,\" from the fact that we are indebted for the  account to a pagan writer of that name. This eclipse took place in A.D.  29, and the total phase was visible a little to the north of Palestine.  It has sometimes been confounded with the \"darkness of the Crucifixion,\"  which event took place near the date in question; but it is sufficient  here to say that the Crucifixion is well known to have occurred during  the Passover of the Jews, which is always celebrated at the _full_ moon,  whereas an eclipse of the sun can only take place at _new_ moon.    Dion Cassius, commenting on the Emperor Claudius about the year A.D. 45,  writes as follows:--    \"As there was going to be an eclipse on his birthday, through fear of a  disturbance, as there had been other prodigies, he put forth a public  notice, not only that the obscuration would take place, and about the  time and magnitude of it, but also about the causes that produce such an  event.\"    This is a remarkable piece of information; for the Romans, an  essentially military nation, appear hitherto to have troubled themselves  very little about astronomical matters, and were content, as we have  seen, to look upon phenomena, like eclipses, as mere celestial  prodigies.    What is thought to be the first definite mention of the solar corona  occurs in a passage of Plutarch. The eclipse to which he refers is  probably one which took place in A.D. 71. He says that the obscuration  caused by the moon \"has no time to last and no extensiveness, but some  light shows itself round the sun's circumference, which does not allow  the darkness to become deep and complete.\" No further reference to this  phenomenon occurs until near the end of the sixteenth century. It  should, however, be here mentioned that Mr. E.W. Maunder has pointed  out the probability[6] that we have a very ancient symbolic  representation of the corona in the \"winged circle,\" \"winged disc,\" or  \"ring with wings,\" as it is variously called, which appears so often  upon Assyrian and Egyptian monuments, as the symbol of the Deity (Fig.  7).    [Illustration: FIG. 7.--The \"Ring with Wings.\" The upper is the Assyrian  form of the symbol, the lower the Egyptian. (From _Knowledge_.) Compare  the form of the corona on Plate VII. (B), p. 142.]    The first solar eclipse recorded to have been seen in England is that of  A.D. 538, mention of which is found in the _Anglo-Saxon Chronicle_. The  track of totality did not, however, come near our islands, for only  two-thirds of the sun's disc were eclipsed at London.    In 840 a great eclipse took place in Europe, which was total for more  than five minutes across what is now Bavaria. Terror at this eclipse is  said to have hastened the death of Louis le Debonnaire, Emperor of the  West, who lay ill at Worms.    In 878--_temp._ King Alfred--an eclipse of the sun took place which was  total at London. From this until 1715 no other eclipse was total at  London itself; though this does not apply to other portions of England.    An eclipse, generally known as the \"Eclipse of Stiklastad,\" is said to  have taken place in 1030, during the sea-fight in which Olaf of Norway  is supposed to have been slain. Longfellow, in his _Saga of King Olaf_,  has it that    \"The Sun hung red  As a drop of blood,\"    but, as in the case of most poets, the dramatic value of an eclipse  seems to have escaped his notice.    In the year 1140 there occurred a total eclipse of the sun, the last to  be visible in England for more than five centuries. Indeed there have  been only two such since--namely, those of 1715 and 1724, to which we  shall allude in due course. The eclipse of 1140 took place on the 20th  March, and is thus referred to in the _Anglo-Saxon Chronicle_:--    \"In the Lent, the sun and the day darkened, about the noon-tide of the  day, when men were eating, and they lighted candles to eat by. That was  the 13th day before the calends of April. Men were very much struck with  wonder.\"    Several of the older historians speak of a \"fearful eclipse\" as having  taken place on the morning of the Battle of Crecy, 1346. Lingard, for  instance, in his _History of England_, has as follows:--    \"Never, perhaps, were preparations for battle made under circumstances  so truly awful. On that very day the sun suffered a partial eclipse:  birds, in clouds, the precursors of a storm, flew screaming over the two  armies, and the rain fell in torrents, accompanied by incessant thunder  and lightning. About five in the afternoon the weather cleared up; the  sun in full splendour darted his rays in the eyes of the enemy.\"    Calculations, however, show that no eclipse of the sun took place in  Europe during that year. This error is found to have arisen from the  mistranslation of an obsolete French word _esclistre_ (lightning), which  is employed by Froissart in his description of the battle.    In 1598 an eclipse was total over Scotland and part of North Germany. It  was observed at Torgau by Jessenius, an Hungarian physician, who noticed  a bright light around the moon during the time of totality. This is said  to be the first reference to the corona since that of Plutarch, to which  we have already drawn attention.    Mention of Scotland recalls the fact that an unusual number of eclipses  happen to have been visible in that country, and the occult bent natural  to the Scottish character has traditionalised a few of them in such  terms as the \"Black Hour\" (an eclipse of 1433), \"Black Saturday\" (the  eclipse of 1598 which has been alluded to above), and \"Mirk Monday\"  (1652). The track of the last-named also passed over Carrickfergus in  Ireland, where it was observed by a certain Dr. Wybord, in whose account  the term \"corona\" is first employed. This eclipse is the last which has  been total in Scotland, and it is calculated that there will not be  another eclipse seen as total there until the twenty-second century.    An eclipse of the sun which took place on May 30, 1612, is recorded as  having been seen \"through a tube.\" This probably refers to the then  recent invention--the telescope.    The eclipses which we have been describing are chiefly interesting from  an historical point of view. The old mystery and confusion to the  beholders seem to have lingered even into comparatively enlightened  times, for we see how late it is before the corona attracts definite  attention for the sake of itself alone.    It is not a far cry from notice of the corona to that of other  accompaniments of a solar eclipse. Thus the eclipse of 1706, the total  phase of which was visible in Switzerland, is of great interest; for it  was on this occasion that the famous red prominences seem first to have  been noted. A certain Captain Stannyan observed this eclipse from Berne  in Switzerland, and described it in a letter to Flamsteed, the then  Astronomer Royal. He says the sun's \"getting out of his eclipse was  preceded by a blood-red streak of light from its left limb, which  continued not longer than six or seven seconds of time; then part of the  Sun's disc appeared all of a sudden, as bright as Venus was ever seen in  the night, nay brighter; and in that very instant gave a Light and  Shadow to things as strong as Moonlight uses to do.\" How little was then  expected of the sun is, however, shown by Flamsteed's words, when  communicating this information to the Royal Society:--    \"The Captain is the first man I ever heard of that took notice of a Red  Streak of Light preceding the Emersion of the Sun's body from a total  Eclipse. And I take notice of it to you because it infers that _the Moon  has an atmosphere_; and its short continuance of only six or seven  seconds of time, tells us that _its height is not more than the five or  six hundredth part of her diameter_.\"    What a change has since come over the ideas of men! The sun has proved a  veritable mine of discovery, while the moon has yielded up nothing new.    The eclipse of 1715, the first total at London since that of 878, was  "]]]
