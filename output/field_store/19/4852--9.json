IX    AN INDIAN CAMP                                    CLOUDCREST, October 13, 1914.    DEAR, DEAR MRS. CONEY,--    This is the very last letter you will receive dated from this camp. We  are leaving a few days earlier than we intended and I am pretty badly  on the fence. I want to laugh, and really I can hardly keep back the  tears. We are leaving sooner than we meant, for rather a good reason.  We haven't one bite to eat except elk meat.    After the men had brought into camp the elk we killed the other  afternoon, they began to plan a sheep hunt. As sheep do not stay in  the woods, the men had to go miles away and above timber line. They  decided to take a pack horse and stay all night. I didn't want Mr.  Stewart to go because the climbing is very dangerous. No accidents  have happened this year, but last season a man fell from the crags  and was killed; so I tried to keep the \"good mon\" at home. But he  would not be persuaded. The love of chase has entered his blood, and  it looks to me as if it had chased reason plumb out of his head. I  know exactly how Samantha felt when Josiah _would_ go to the \"pleasure  exertion.\" The bald spot on the Stewart's head doesn't seem to remind  him of years gone by; he is as joyous as a boy.    It was finally decided to take Mrs. O'Shaughnessy and the children and  myself to a neighboring camp about two miles away, as we didn't like  to risk being frightened by a possible intruder. Sorenson, the  game-warden, was in camp to inspect our game on the 12th, and he told  us he was on the trail of tooth-hunters and had routed them out on the  night of the storm; but what they could have been doing in our camp  was as much a mystery to him as to us.    Well, when we were ready to go, Mr. Murry and the Stewart escorted  us. It was a cloudy afternoon and often great flakes of snow fell  gently, softly. The snow was already about eighteen inches deep, and  it made sheep hunting slippery and dangerous work. On our way we came  upon an Indian camp. They were all huddled about a tiny fire;  scattered about were their wikiups made of sticks and pine boughs. The  Indians were sullen and angry. The game-warden had ordered them back  to Fort Washakie, where they belonged. Their squaws had jerked their  elk. You may not know what jerked means, so I will explain: it means  dried, cured. They had all they were allowed, but for some reason they  didn't want to go. Sorenson suspects them of being in with the  tooth-hunters and he is narrowing the circle.    At the camp where we were to stay, we found Mrs. Kavanaugh laid up  with a sore throat, but she made us welcome. It would be a mighty  funny camper who wouldn't. As soon as the men from the Kavanaugh camp  heard our men's plans, they were eager to go along. So it ended in us  three women being left alone. We said we were not afraid and we tried  not to feel so, but after dark we all felt a little timorous. Mrs.  Kavanaugh was afraid of the Indians, but I was afraid they would bring  Clyde back dead from a fall. We were camped in an old cabin built by  the ranger. The Kavanaughs were short of groceries. We cooked our big  elk steaks on sticks before an open fire, and we roasted potatoes in  the ashes. When our fear wore away, we had a fine time. After a while  we lay down on fragrant beds of pine.    We awoke late. The fire was dead upon the hearth and outside the snow  was piling up. Mrs. O'Shaughnessy made a rousing fire and managed to  jolly us until we had a really happy breakfast hour. About three in  the afternoon all the men came trooping in, cold, wet, and hungry.  After filling them with venison, hot potatoes, and coffee, we started  to our own camp. The men were rather depressed because they had come  back empty-handed. The Indians were gone and the snow lay thick over  the place where their fire had been; they had left in the night.    When we came to camp, Mr. Struble started to build a fire; but no  matches were to be had. Next, the men went to feed grain to their  tired horses, but the oats were gone. Mr. Murry sought in vain for his  beloved accordion. Mr. Harkrudder was furious when he found his  grinding machine was gone. Mrs. O'Shaughnessy made a dash for the  grub-box. It was empty. We were dumbfounded. Each of us kept searching  and researching and knowing all the while we would find nothing. Mr.  Struble is a most cheerful individual, and, as Mrs. O'Shaughnessy  says, \"is a mighty good fellow even if he _is_ Dutch.\" \"The Indians  have stolen us out,\" he said, \"but after all they have left us our  tents and harness, all our meat, and the road home; so what matter if  we _are_ a little inconvenienced as to grub? Haynes may cry for sugar,  but that won't hurt the rest any. I'll saddle and ride over to  Scotty's and get enough to last us out.\"    We knew the Kavanaughs could not help us any, but we grew cheerful in  anticipating help from Scotty, who was from Green River and was camped  a few miles away. We wanted Mr. Struble to wait until morning, but he  said no, it would make breakfast late; so he rode off in the dark. At  two o'clock this morning he came in almost frozen, with two small cans  of milk and two yeast cakes. As soon as it was light enough to see,  the men were at work loading the game and breaking camp. As they are  ready now to take down this tent, I will have to finish this letter  somewhere else.          X    THE TOOTH-HUNTERS                                    AT SORENSON'S CABIN                                   ON GREEN RIVER.    Well, we're here, warmed and fed and in much better trim bodily and  mentally. We had mishap after mishap coming. First the Hutton horse,  being a bronco, had to act up when he was hitched up. We had almost  more game than we could haul, but at last we got started, after the  bronco had reared and pitched as much as he wanted to. There are a  great many springs,--one every few feet in these mountains,--and the  snow hid the pitfalls and made the ground soft, so that the wheels cut  in and pulling was hard. Then, too, our horses had had nothing to eat  for two days, the snow being so deep they couldn't get at the grass,  hobbled as they were.    We had got perhaps a mile from camp when the leading wagon, with four  horses driven by Mr. Haynes, suddenly stopped. The wheels had sunk  into the soft banks of a small, ditch-like spring branch. Mr. Stewart  had to stay on our wagon to hold the bronco, but all the rest, even  Mrs. O'Shaughnessy, gathered around and tried to help. They hitched on  a snap team, but not a trace tightened. They didn't want to unload the  game in the snow. The men lifted and pried on the wheels. Still the  horses wouldn't budge.    Mr. Haynes is no disciple of Job, but he tried manfully to restrain  himself. Turning to Glenholdt, who was offering advice, he said, \"You  get out. I know what the trouble is: these horses used to belong to a  freighter and are used to being cussed. It's the greatest nuisance in  the world for a man to go out where there's a bunch of women. If these  women weren't along I'd make these horses get out of there.\"    Mrs. O'Shaughnessy said, \"Don't lay your poor driving to the women. If  you drive by cussin', then _cuss_. We will stop up our ears.\"    She threw her apron over her head. I held my fingers in Jerrine's  ears, and she stopped my ears, else I might be able to tell you what  he said. It was something violent, I know. I could tell by the  expression of his face. He had only been doing it a second when those  horses walked right out with the wagon as nicely as you please. Mrs.  O'Shaughnessy said to Mr. Haynes, \"It's a poor cusser you are. Sure,  it's no wonder you hesitated to begin. If Danny O'Shaughnessy couldn't  have sworn better, I'd have had to hilp him.\"    We got along pretty well after that. Mr. Haynes kept some distance  ahead; but occasionally a bit of \"cussin'\" came back to us and we knew  he was using freighter tactics.    The game-warden lives in a tiny little cabin. The door is so low that  I had to stoop to get in. It was quite dark when we got here last  night, but Mrs. Sorenson acted as if she was _glad_ to see us. I  didn't think we could all get in. A row of bunks is built along one  side of the cabin. A long tarpaulin covers the bed, and we all got  upon this and sat while our hostess prepared our supper. If one of us  had stirred we would have been in her way; so there we sat as thick as  thieves. When supper was ready six got off their perch and ate; when  they were through, six more were made happy.    Mr. Sorenson had caught the tooth-hunters. On the wall hung their  deadly guns, with silencers on them to muffle the report. He showed us  the teeth he had found in their possession. The warden and his deputy  had searched the men and their effects and found no teeth. He had no  evidence against them except their unlawful guns, but he knew he had  the right men. At last he found their contract to furnish two hundred  pair of teeth. It is a trick of such hunters to thrust a knife into  the meat of the game they have, and so to make pockets in which they  hide the teeth; but these fellows had no such pockets. They jeered at  the warden and threatened to kill him, but he kept searching, and  presently found the teeth in a pail of lard. He told us all about it  as we sat, an eager crowd, on his bed. A warden takes his life in his  hands when he goes after such fellows, but Sorenson is not afraid to  do it.    The cabin walls are covered with pen-and-ink drawings, the work of the  warden's gifted children,--Vina, the pretty eighteen-year-old  daughter, and Laurence, the sixteen-year-old son. They never had a  lesson in drawing in their lives, but their pictures portray Western  life exactly.    The snow is not so deep here as it was at camp, but it is too deep for  the horses to get grass. The men were able to get a little grain from  the warden; so we will pull out in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28613"],[0,"Pioneers of Science (#12)"],[1,", and  several were tried: with the result that they could be made to answer  better than a circle, but still were not right.    Now, however, the geometrical and mathematical difficulties of  calculation, which before had been tedious and oppressive, threatened to  become overwhelming; and it is with a rising sense of despondency that  Kepler sees his six years' unremitting labour leading deeper and deeper  into complication.    One most disheartening circumstance appeared, viz. that when he made the  circuit oval his law of equable description of areas broke down. That  seemed to require the circular orbit, and yet no circular orbit was  quite accurate.    While thinking and pondering for weeks and months over this new dilemma  and complication of difficulties, till his brain reeled, an accidental  ray of light broke upon him in a way not now intelligible, or barely  intelligible. Half the extreme breadth intercepted between the circle  and oval was 429/100,000 of the radius, and he remembered that the  \"optical inequality\" of Mars was also about 429/100,000. This  coincidence, in his own words, woke him out of sleep; and for some  reason or other impelled him instantly to try making the planet  oscillate in the diameter of its epicycle instead of revolve round it--a  singular idea, but Copernicus had had a similar one to explain the  motions of Mercury.    [Illustration: FIG. 31.--Mode of drawing an ellipse. The two pins _F_  are the foci.]    Away he started through his calculations again. A long course of work  night and day was rewarded by finding that he was now able to hit off  the motions better than before; but what a singularly complicated motion  it was. Could it be expressed no more simply? Yes, the curve so  described by the planet is a comparatively simple one: it is a special  kind of oval--the ellipse. Strange that he had not thought of it before.  It was a famous curve, for the Greek geometers had studied it as one of  the sections of a cone, but it was not so well known in Kepler's time.  The fact that the planets move in it has raised it to the first  importance, and it is familiar enough to us now. But did it satisfy the  law of speed? Could the rate of description of areas be uniform with  it? Well, he tried the ellipse, and to his inexpressible delight he  found that it did satisfy the condition of equable description of areas,  if the sun was in one focus. So, moving the planet in a selected  ellipse, with the sun in one focus, at a speed given by the equable area  description, its position agreed with Tycho's observations within the  limits of the error of experiment. Mars was finally conquered, and  remains in his prison-house to this day. The orbit was found.    [Illustration: FIG. 32.]    In a paroxysm of delight Kepler celebrates his victory by a triumphant  figure, sketched actually on his geometrical diagram--the diagram which  proves that the law of equable description of areas can hold good with  an ellipse. The above is a tracing of it.    Such is a crude and bald sketch of the steps by which Kepler rose to his  great generalizations--the two laws which have immortalized his name.    All the complications of epicycle, equant, deferent, excentric, and the  like, were swept at once away, and an orbit of striking and beautiful  properties substituted. Well might he be called, as he was, \"the  legislator,\" or law interpreter, \"of the heavens.\"    [Illustration: FIG. 33.--If _S_ is the sun, a planet or comet moves from  _P_ to _P_1_, from _P_2_ to _P_3_, and from _P_4_ to _P_5_ in  the same time; if the shaded areas are equal.]    He concludes his book on the motions of Mars with a half comic appeal to  the Emperor to provide him with the sinews of war for an attack on  Mars's relations--father Jupiter, brother Mercury, and the rest--but the  death of his unhappy patron in 1612 put an end to all these schemes, and  reduced Kepler to the utmost misery. While at Prague his salary was in  continual arrear, and it was with difficulty that he could provide  sustenance for his family. He had been there eleven years, but they had  been hard years of poverty, and he could leave without regret were it  not that he should have to leave Tycho's instruments and observations  behind him. While he was hesitating what best to do, and reduced to the  verge of despair, his wife, who had long been suffering from low spirits  and despondency, and his three children, were taken ill; one of the sons  died of small-pox, and the wife eleven days after of low fever and  epilepsy. No money could be got at Prague, so after a short time he  accepted a professorship at Linz, and withdrew with his two quite young  remaining children.    He provided for himself now partly by publishing a prophesying almanack,  a sort of Zadkiel arrangement--a thing which he despised, but the  support of which he could not afford to do without. He is continually  attacking and throwing sarcasm at astrology, but it was the only thing  for which people would pay him, and on it after a fashion he lived. We  do not find that his circumstances were ever prosperous, and though  8,000 crowns were due to him from Bohemia he could not manage to get  them paid.    About this time occurred a singular interruption to his work. His old  mother, of whose fierce temper something has already been indicated, had  been engaged in a law-suit for some years near their old home in  Wuertemberg. A change of judge having in process of time occurred, the  defendant saw his way to turn the tables on the old lady by accusing her  of sorcery. She was sent to prison, and condemned to the torture, with  the usual intelligent idea of extracting a \"voluntary\" confession.  Kepler had to hurry from Linz to interpose. He succeeded in saving her  from the torture, but she remained in prison for a year or so. Her  spirit, however, was unbroken, for no sooner was she released than she  commenced a fresh action against her accuser. But fresh trouble was  averted by the death of the poor old dame at the age of nearly eighty.    This narration renders the unflagging energy shown by her son in his  mathematical wrestlings less surprising.    Interspersed with these domestic troubles, and with harassing and  unsuccessful attempts to get his rights, he still brooded over his old  problem of some possible connection between the distances of the planets  from the sun and their times of revolution, _i.e._ the length of their  years.    It might well have been that there was no connection, that it was purely  imaginary, like his old idea of the law of the successive distances of  the planets, and like so many others of the guesses and fancies which  he entertained and spent his energies in probing. But fortunately this  time there was a connection, and he lived to have the joy of discovering  it.    The connection is this, that if one compares the distance of the  different planets from the sun with the length of time they take to go  round him, the cube of the respective distances is proportional to the  square of the corresponding times. In other words, the ratio of r^3  to T^2 for every planet is the same. Or, again, the length of a  planet's year depends on the 3/2th power of its distance from the sun.  Or, once more, the speed of each planet in its orbit is as the inverse  square-root of its distance from the sun. The product of the distance  into the square of the speed is the same for each planet.    This (however stated) is called Kepler's third law. It welds the planets  together, and shows them to be one system. His rapture on detecting the  law was unbounded, and he breaks out into an exulting rhapsody:--    \"What I prophesied two-and-twenty years ago, as soon as I discovered the  five solids among the heavenly orbits--what I firmly believed long  before I had seen Ptolemy's _Harmonies_--what I had promised my friends  in the title of this book, which I named before I was sure of my  discovery--what sixteen years ago, I urged as a thing to be sought--that  for which I joined Tycho Brahe, for which I settled in Prague, for which  I have devoted the best part of my life to astronomical contemplations,  at length I have brought to light, and recognized its truth beyond my  most sanguine expectations. It is not eighteen months since I got the  first glimpse of light, three months since the dawn, very few days since  the unveiled sun, most admirable to gaze upon, burst upon me. Nothing  holds me; I will indulge my sacred fury; I will triumph over mankind by  the honest confession that I have stolen the golden vases of the  Egyptians to build up a tabernacle for my God far away from the  confines of Egypt. If you forgive me, I rejoice; if you are angry, I can  bear it; the die is cast, the book is written, to be read either now or  by posterity, I care not which; it may well wait a century for a reader,  as God has waited six thousand years for an observer.\"    Soon after this great work his third book appeared: it was an epitome of  the Copernican theory, a clear and fairly popular exposition of it,  which had the honour of being at once suppressed and placed on the list  of books prohibited by the Church, side by side with the work of  Copernicus himself, _De Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestium_.    This honour, however, gave Kepler no satisfaction--it rather occasioned  him dismay, especially as it deprived him of all pecuniary benefit, and  made it almost impossible for him to get a publisher to undertake  another book.    Still he worked on at the Rudolphine tables of Tycho, and ultimately,  with some small help from Vienna, completed them; but he could not get  the means to print them. He applied to the Court till he was sick of  applying: they lay idle four years. At last he determined to pay for the  type himself. What he paid it with, God knows, but he did pay it, and he  did bring out the tables, and so was faithful to the behest of his  friend.    This great"]]]
