Jehannot expected  Abraham's conversion least of all things, and allowed him some days of rest  before he asked what he thought of the Holy Father and the cardinals and the  other courtiers. To which the Jew forthwith replied:--\"I think God owes them  all an evil recompense: I tell thee, so far as I was able to carry my  investigations, holiness, devotion, good works or exemplary living in any  kind was nowhere to be found in any clerk; but only lewdness, avarice,  gluttony, and the like, and worse, if worse may be, appeared to be held in  such honour of all, that (to my thinking) the place is a centre of  diabolical rather than of divine activities. To the best of my judgment,  your Pastor, and by consequence all that are about him devote all their zeal  and ingenuity and subtlety to devise how best and most speedily they may  bring the Christian religion to nought and banish it from the world. And  because I see that what they so zealously endeavour does not come to pass,  but that on the contrary your religion continually grows, and shines more  and more clear, therein I seem to discern a very evident token that it,  rather than any other, as being more true and holy than any other, has the  Holy Spirit for its foundation and support. For which cause, whereas I met  your exhortations in a harsh and obdurate temper, and would not become a  Christian, now I frankly tell you that I would on no account omit to become  such. Go we then to the church, and there according to the traditional rite  of your holy faith let me receive baptism.\" Jehannot, who had anticipated a  diametrically opposite conclusion, as soon as he heard him so speak, was the  best pleased man that ever was in the world. So taking Abraham with him to  Notre Dame he prayed the clergy there to baptise him. When they heard that  it was his own wish, they forthwith did so, and Jehannot raised him from the  sacred font, and named him Jean; and afterwards he caused teachers of great  eminence thoroughly to instruct him in our faith, which he readily learned,  and afterwards practised in a good, a virtuous, nay, a holy life.      NOVEL III.    --  Melchisedech, a Jew, by a story of three rings averts a great danger with  which he was menaced by Saladin.  --    When Neifile had brought her story to a close amid the commendations of all  the company, Filomena, at the queen's behest, thus began:--    The story told by Neifile brings to my mind another in which also Jew  appears, but this time as the hero of a perilous adventure; and as enough  has been said of God and of the truth our faith, it will not now be  inopportune if we descend to mundane events and the actions of men.  Wherefore I propose to tell you a story, which will perhaps dispose you to  be more circumspect than you have been wont to be in answering questions  addressed to you. Well ye know, or should know, loving gossips, that, as it  often happens that folk by their own folly forfeit a happy estate and are  plunged in most grievous misery, so good sense will extricate the wise from  extremity of peril, and establish them in complete and assured peace. Of the  change from good to evil fortune, which folly may effect, instances abound;  indeed, occurring as they do by the thousand day by day, they are so  conspicuous that their recital would be beside our present purpose. But that  good sense may be our succour in misfortune, I will now, as I promised, make  plain to you within the narrow compass of a little story.    Saladin, who by his great valour had from small beginnings made himself  Soldan of Egypt, and gained many victories over kings both Christian and  Saracen, having in divers wars and by divers lavish displays of magnificence  spent all his treasure, and in order to meet a certain emergency being in  need of a large sum of money, and being at a loss to raise it with a  celerity adequate to his necessity, bethought him of a wealthy Jew,  Melchisedech by name, who lent at usance in Alexandria, and who, were he but  willing, was, as he believed, able to accommodate him, but was so miserly  that he would never do so of his own accord, nor was Saladin disposed to  constrain him thereto. So great, however, was his necessity that, after  pondering every method whereby the Jew might be induced to be compliant, at  last he determined to devise a colourably reasonable pretext for extorting  the money from him. So he sent for him, received him affably, seated him by  his side, and presently said to him:--\"My good man, I have heard from many  people that thou art very wise, and of great discernment in divine things;  wherefore I would gladly know of thee, which of the three laws thou reputest  the true law, the law of the Jews, the law of the Saracens, or the law of  the Christians?\" The Jew, who was indeed a wise man, saw plainly enough that  Saladin meant to entangle him in his speech, that he might have occasion to  harass him, and bethought him that he could not praise any of the three laws  above another without furnishing Saladin with the pretext which he sought.  So, concentrating all the force of his mind to shape such an answer as might  avoid the snare, he presently lit on what he sought, saying:--\"My lord, a  pretty question indeed is this which you propound, and fain would I answer  it; to which end it is apposite that I tell you a story, which, if you will  hearken, is as follows:--If I mistake not, I remember to have often heard  tell of a great and rich man of old time, who among other most precious  jewels had in his treasury a ring of extraordinary beauty and value, which  by reason of its value and beauty he was minded to leave to his heirs for  ever; for which cause he ordained, that, whichever of his sons was found in  possession of the ring as by his bequest, should thereby be designate his  heir, and be entitled to receive from the rest the honour and homage due to  a superior. The son, to whom he bequeathed the ring, left it in like manner  to his descendants, making the like ordinance as his predecessor. In short  the ring passed from hand to hand for many generations; and in the end came  to the hands of one who had three sons, goodly and virtuous all, and very  obedient to their father, so that he loved them all indifferently. The rule  touching the descent of the ring was known to the young men, and each  aspiring to hold the place of honour among them did all he could to persuade  his father, who was now old, to leave the ring to him at his death. The  worthy man, who loved them all equally, and knew not how to choose from  among them a sole legatee, promised the ring to each in turn, and in order  to satisfy all three, caused a cunning artificer secretly to make two other  rings, so like the first, that the maker himself could hardly tell which was  the true ring. So, before he died, he disposed of the rings, giving one  privily to each of his sons; whereby it came to pass, that after his decease  each of the sons claimed the inheritance and the place of honour, and, his  claim being disputed by his brothers, produced his ring in witness of right.  And the rings being found so like one to another that it was impossible to  distinguish the true one, the suit to determine the true heir remained  pendent, and still so remains. And so, my lord, to your question, touching  the three laws given to the three peoples by God the Father, I answer:--Each  of these peoples deems itself to have the true inheritance, the true law,  the true commandments of God; but which of them is justified in so  believing, is a question which, like that of the rings, remains pendent.\"  The excellent adroitness with which the Jew had contrived to evade the snare  which he had laid for his feet was not lost upon Saladin. He therefore  determined to let the Jew know his need, and did so, telling him at the same  time what he had intended to do, in the event of his answering less  circumspectly than he had done.    Thereupon the Jew gave the Soldan all the accommodation that he required,  which the Soldan afterwards repaid him in full. He also gave him most  munificent gifts with his lifelong amity and a great and honourable position  near his person.      NOVEL IV.    --  A monk lapses into a sin meriting the most severe punishment, justly  censures the same fault in his abbot, and thus evades the penalty.  --    The silence which followed the conclusion of Filomena's tale was broken by  Dioneo, who sate next her, and without waiting for the queen's word, for he  knew that by the rule laid down at the commencement it was now his turn to  speak, began on this wise:--Loving ladies, if I have well understood the  intention of you all, we are here to afford entertainment to one another by  story-telling; wherefore, provided only nought is done that is repugnant to  this end, I deem it lawful for each (and so said our queen a little while  ago) to tell whatever story seems to him most likely to be amusing. Seeing,  then, that we have heard how Abraham saved his soul by the good counsel of  Jehannot de Chevigny, and Melchisedech by his own good sense safe-guarded  his wealth against the stratagems of Saladin, I hope to escape your censure  in narrating a brief story of a monk, who by his address delivered his body  from imminent peril of most severe chastisement.    In the not very remote district of Lunigiana there flourished formerly a  community of monks more numerous and holy than is there to be found to-day,  among whom was a young brother, whose vigour and lustihood neither the fasts  nor the vigils availed to subdue. One afternoon, while the rest of the  confraternity slept, our young monk took a stroll around the church, which  lay in a very sequestered spot, and chanced to espy a young and very  beautiful girl, a daughter, perhaps, of one of the husbandmen of those  parts, going through the fields and gathering herbs as she went. No"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37329"],[0,"The Domestic Cat (#12)"],[1,"the captain vouches, clearly  proves that pussy has a much larger amount of reasoning power than most  people give her credit for.  It was just as though pussy had addressed  the male cat thus:    \"I've brought you your youngster, Thomas.  It cannot live at home for  the mischievous puppy.  Goodness knows I've done _my_ duty to him as a  mother; now, hub, you have a turn.  Time about's fair-play, Thomas;  good-bye.\"    CHAPTER THIRTEEN.    SAGACITY OF THE CAT.      \"The dignity of life is not impaired    By aught which innocently satisfies    The humbler cravings of the heart; and he    Is still a happier man, who, for the heights    Of speculation not unfit, descends,    And such benign affections cultivates,    Among the inferior kinds.\"      Wordsworth.    I think many of the miseries which the \"harmless necessary cat\" has to  endure in this wicked world of hers and ours would be mitigated if not  entirely removed, were we only to take the trouble to study and consider  what a wonderfully reasoning and sensible little thing she is.  \"Leave  the study to old maids,\" I think I hear some manly (?) reader exclaim.  But why to old maids?  It is you who are unkind to pussy, and regardless  of her comforts, and not old maids.  And indeed, indeed now, I never for  the life of me could see why any stigma should attach itself to an old  maid any more than to a cat.  Most of the old maids I have known were  very agreeable persons indeed, and I've spent many a quiet and enjoyable  hour with old maids over a cup of homely tea.  My two maternal aunts are  old maids, they even plead guilty to the soft impeachment, but cheerier  bodies you wouldn't meet anywhere.  They go three times to the kirk on a  Sunday, to be sure, and wouldn't cook a meal on that sacred day for a  world.  But just see them on a week-day, look at their bright smiling  faces--what odds if they do try to appear a few years younger?--and ah!  just see them go through the intricate figures of the mazy Reel o'  Tulloch, and hear them crack their thumbs, and cry \"hooch!\" you wouldn't  say old-maidendom was so very dreary after that.  It isn't always a  woman's fault if she can't get married: many, whose early affections  have been blighted, would not marry if they could, for haven't they got  a posy somewhere, a locket with a face, a lock of hair, and a faded  ribbon which erst was bonny blue--relics of lost love, around which  cling sweetest memories of the past?  Besides, have not unmarried ladies  more opportunities to taste the sweets of doing good, and, better still,  more time to cherish hopes of happiness hereafter, which are worth a  world of wedded bliss?    Cats then, like old maids, are fifty times worse than they are painted,  and the reason why people don't like them is because they don't  understand them.  I have at this moment a large and beautiful tabby, and  I positively rejoice that that cat is so fierce to everyone but me,  because before I got her she was subjected to the most barbarous  treatment, neither fed, nor housed, nor watered, and I believe I was the  first person from whom she ever got a word of kindness.  No wonder that  at first she did not understand my meaning.  But she does now, though  she never will be tame; but if I am asleep she mounts guard on the table  near me, and her purring chant is speedily turned into a low, ominous  growl if any one but touches the handle of the door.  Does she know that  I am asleep, and that one in sleep is helpless as regards defence?  I'm  sure she does, for--    _Cats know the nature of sleep in others_.--A friend of mine has a  pussy, Kate to name, who has been early trained to habits of  cleanliness.  When Kate wishes to get out at night she goes to her  master's bedside, and mews loudly and entreatingly.  To see how she will  behave, sometimes her master pretends to be fast asleep, and snores  loudly.  \"Oh!\" thinks puss to herself, \"this will never do;\" so she  invariably stands upon her hind legs, and pats his face with her gloved  hand.  When he gets up, she trots pleasantly before him towards a little  window, which he opens for her, and admits her into the garden.  The  same cat for many years used to seat herself regularly every night on a  chest of drawers, waiting patiently till the door of the adjoining  cupboard was thrown open for her: this cupboard was a very prolific  hunting-ground of pussy's.  When she had kittens, and they were able to  eat, she used to bring all the mice to them, and present them with that  fond \"murring\" mew which all cat lovers know so well.    Everybody knows that cats can open doors if left off the latch, and also  that they soon get up to the mechanism of the old-fashioned  hand-and-thumb latch; they open this by springing up, and holding on to  the hand portion with one arm, while they press down the thumb portion  with the other foot.    A lady friend of mine has a large Tabby Tom who can open a room door, by  standing on his hind legs and turning the knob with his teeth.  This is  clever, but cats even know how to _fasten_ doors, at least some do; and  this same _lady was once in_ a cupboard, when one of her pussies came  and turned on the button latch of the door, and made her a prisoner for  some considerable time!    In a small village which I know, there is an old woman who lives by  keeping lodgers of the more humble description.  As these have often to  get up and be off early in the morning, the woman always gives them  strict injunctions to shut the door when they go out, for fear of  thieves.  One morning a lodger had forgotten to obey his landlady's  instructions.  Pussy, however, had witnessed the infraction of the rule,  and walked directly to her mistress's bedside, and began to mew most  plaintively.  Nor would she be content till the woman got up, when the  cat led her directly to the door.  Pussy wouldn't go out, but so soon as  the door was shut, led the way again back to bed, _singing_.  Old  women's cats are nearly always wiser than others--they get more care  taken with their training, and more comfort and love.  They know all the  ways, likes, and dislikes of a beloved mistress, and study them just as  they do their own.  Indeed, some of the things I have known old women's  cats do are unaccountable in any other way, but the belief that they are  possessed of a very high amount of intelligence and reasoning power.  No  wonder our ignorant ancestors believed them possessed of devils.    You see it is just like this--when you once get a cat to love you, you,  and you only, will become the study of her whole life.  She soon finds  out what pleases you, and what vexes you, and also what you love, and,  whether that be dog or child, she will love it too, to please you.    Cats will often, very often--just like dogs--lead those they love to  places where something or some creature is in danger.  It may be, as  happened to myself once, while residing in Lincoln, two summers ago,  when a cat came towards me out of an entry, and, as plain as any animal  could speak, gazed up into my face, and cried: \"Come, oh come and help  me?\"  I followed, and she led me down the garden to a closet, through  which her kitten had dropped into the cesspool below.  Now just think  for one moment of the amount of sagacity shown in this case!  Piteously  the little kit had mewed to her mother: \"Mother, mother, come and help  me?\"  Pussy's answer had been: \"My dear, I can't, but I'll soon find  those who will.\"  And that was precisely my answer to the mother cat,  when I saw the state of affairs, and I kept my word.    And once again a pussy--this time my own--led me a long way from my work  to a distant outhouse to see her kits.  After she got me to the spot  where they were, she rolled on her back and held them up one by one to  be admired.    I knew the case of a cat bringing her mistress hastily to a room where  her sick child lay.  The child had rolled on to the floor, and would  have been smothered, except for pussy's timely aid.    Some will hardly credit this, because they do not see the working of the  internal machine--pussy's mind--nor know the motive power--love, love,  love.  _Amor vincit omnia_.    CHAPTER FOURTEEN.    CATS FEEDING THE SICK.    \"Ma conscience! mither, it kens its name?\"  Such was the exclamation of  a little ragged and kilted urchin, in the remote Highlands of  Argyllshire, as he heard me call my dog to give him a drink.  The day  was exceedingly warm, and we had had a long walk over the mountain, and  had been kindly invited into a shepherd's hut, and asked to partake of a  draught of cool, sweet whey--the very best of summer beverages.  Nero  was having a \"talkee-talkee\" with some rabbits, and didn't see his whey  until I called his attention to it; hence the wondering urchin's  exclamation.    \"Hoo shouldna he?\" said the mother; \"poor wise-lookin' beast.  Ise  warrant he kens mair than that.\"    The idea of even a child thinking it strange Theodore Nero [the  Newfoundland champion] should know his name was so amusing that I gave  the boy \"twa bawbees\" on the spot.    And just on a par with this boy's ignorance, is the unbelieving  ignorance of some people who doubt everything they cannot understand,  however well authenticated.  This doubting implies an assumption on  their part that the knowledge they possess is the highest attainable,  that their minds are, in fact, complete in themselves.  It is people of  this class--fools--who doubt the existence of even a Supreme Being.  I  read in a late number of the _Live Stock Journal_ an account of a cat,  which, seeing its master sick in bed, and unable to move, brought a  mouse to him, and on her master pretending to eat it, the same day  brought him a striped squirrel; and every day, until he got well,  brought \"game\" of some sort and laid them on his bed.    I believe I, myself, was the first who ever _dared_ to publish a case of  the same kind.  The story was this: "]]]
