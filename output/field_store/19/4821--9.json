If you include your  e-mail address we will at least acknowledge your note. Thank you again.    Answers to many frequently asked questions (FAQs) are explained in the  Notes and Definitions section in The World Factbook. Please review this  section to see if your question is already answered there. In addition,  we have compiled the following list of FAQs to answer other common  questions. Select from the following categories to narrow your search:      General  Geography  Spelling and Pronunciation  Policies and Procedures  Technical        General    Can you provide additional information for a specific country?    The staff cannot provide data beyond what appears in The World  Factbook. The format and information in the Factbook are tailored to  the specific requirements of US Government officials and content is  focused on their current and anticipated needs. The staff welcomes  suggestions for new entries.    How often is The World Factbook updated?    Formerly our Web site (and the published Factbook) were only updated  annually. Beginning in November 2001 we instituted a new system of more  frequent online updates.    The annual printed version of the Factbook is usually released about  midyear. US Government officials may obtain information about Factbook  availability from their own organizations or through liaison channels  to the CIA. Other users may obtain sales information through the  following channels:    Superintendent of Documents  P. O. Box 371954 Pittsburgh, PA 15250-7954  Telephone: [1] (202) 512-1800  FAX: [1] (202) 512-2250  http://bookstore.gpo.gov    National Technical Information Service  5285 Port Royal Road Springfield, VA 22161  Telephone: [1] (800) 553-6847 (only in the US);  [1] (703) 605-6000 (for outside US)  FAX: [1] (703) 605-6900  http://www.ntis.gov      Can I use some or all of The World Factbook for my Web site (book,  research project, homework, etc.)?    The World Factbook is in the public domain and may be used freely by  anyone at anytime without seeking permission. However, US Code  prohibits use of the CIA seal in a manner which implies that the CIA  approved, endorsed, or authorized such use. If you have any questions  about your intended use, you should consult with legal counsel. Further  information on The World Factbook's use is described on the  Contributors and Copyright Information page. As a courtesy, please cite  The World Factbook when used.    Why doesn't The World Factbook include information on states,  departments, provinces, etc., in the country format?    The World Factbook provides national-level information on countries,  territories, and dependencies, but not subnational administrative units  within a country. A good encyclopedia should provide state/province-  level information.    Is it possible to access older editions of The World Factbook to do  comparative research and trend analysis?    Only the current version is available for browsing on the CIA Web site.  In the future, the staff hopes to post electronic versions of The World  Factbook as far back as 1986. Hardcopy editions for earlier years are  available from libraries.    Would it be possible to set up a partnership or collaboration between  the producers of The World Factbook and other organizations or  individuals?    The World Factbook does not partner with other organizations or  individuals, but we do welcome comments and suggestions that such  groups or persons choose to provide.        Geography    I can't find a geographic name for a particular country. Why not?    The World Factbook is not a gazetteer (a dictionary or index of places,  usually with descriptive or statistical information) and cannot provide  more than the names of the administrative divisions (in the Government  category) and major cities/towns (on the country maps). Our expanded  Cross-Reference List of Geographic Names, however, includes many of the  world's major geographic features as well as historic (former) names of  countries and cities mentioned in The World Factbook.    Why are Taiwan and the European Union listed out of alphabetical order  at the end of the Factbook entries?    Taiwan is listed after the regular entries because even though the  mainland People's Republic of China claims Taiwan, elected Taiwanese  authorities de facto administer the island and reject mainland  sovereignty claims. With the establishment of diplomatic relations with  China on January 1, 1979, the US Government recognized the People's  Republic of China as the sole legal government of China, acknowledging  the Chinese position that there is only one China and that Taiwan is  part of China.    The European Union (EU) is not a country, but it has taken on many  nation-like attributes and these are likely to be expanded in the  future. A more complete explanation on the inclusion of the EU into the  Factbook may be found in the Preliminary statement.    Since we have an ambassador who represents the US at the Vatican, why  is this entity not listed in the Factbook?    Vatican City is found under Holy See. The term \"Holy See\" refers to the  authority, jurisdiction, and sovereignty vested in the Pope and his  advisors to direct the worldwide Catholic Church. The Holy See has a  legal personality that allows it to enter into treaties as the  juridical equal of a state and to send and receive diplomatic  representatives. Vatican City, created in 1929 to administer properties  belonging to the Holy See in Rome, is recognized under international  law as a sovereign state, but it does not send or receive diplomatic  representatives. Consequently, Holy See is included as a Factbook  entry, with Vatican City cross-referenced in the Geographic Names  appendix.    Why is Palestine not listed in The World Factbook?    The areas that could potentially form a future Palestinian state -- the  West Bank and Gaza Strip -- do appear in the Factbook. These areas are  presently Israeli-occupied with current status subject to the Israeli-  Palestinian 1995 Interim Agreement; their permanent status is to be  determined through further negotiation.    Why are the Golan Heights not shown as part of Israel or Northern  Cyprus with Turkey?    Territorial occupations/annexations not recognized by the United States  Government are not shown on US Government maps.    Why don't you include information on entities such as Tibet, Kashmir,  or Kosovo?    The World Factbook provides information on the administrative divisions  of a country as recommended by the United States Board on Geographic  Names (BGN). The BGN is a component of the US Government that develops  policies, principles, and procedures governing the spelling, use, and  application of geographic names--domestic, foreign, Antarctic, and  undersea. Its decisions enable all departments and agencies of the US  Government to have access to uniform names of geographic features.    Also included in the Factbook are entries on parts of the world whose  status has not yet been resolved (e.g., West Bank, Spratly Islands).  Specific regions within a country or areas in dispute among countries  are not covered.    What do you mean when you say that a country is \"doubly landlocked\"?    A doubly landlocked country is one that is separated from an ocean or  an ocean-accessible sea by two intervening countries. Uzbekistan and  Liechtenstein are the only countries that fit this definition.        Spelling and Pronunciation    Why is the spelling of proper names such as rulers, presidents, and  prime ministers in The World Factbook different than their spelling in  my country?    The Factbook staff applies the names and spellings from the Chiefs of  State link on the CIA Web site. The World Factbook is prepared using  the standard American English computer keyboard and does not use any  special characters, symbols, or most diacritical markings in its  spellings. Surnames are always spelled with capital letters; they may  appear first in some cultures.    The spelling of geographic names, features, cities, administrative  divisions, etc. in the Factbook differs from those used in my country.  Why is this?    The United States Board on Geographic Names (BGN) recommends and  approves names and spellings. The BGN is the component of the United  States Government that develops policies, principles, and procedures  governing the spelling, use, and application of geographic names--  domestic, foreign, Antarctic, and undersea. Its decisions enable all  departments and agencies of the US Government to use uniform names of  geographic features. (A note is usually included where changes may have  occurred but have not yet been approved by the BGN). The World Factbook  is prepared using the standard American English computer keyboard and  does not use any special characters, symbols, or most diacritical  markings in its spellings.    Why doesn't The World Factbook include pronunciations of country or  leader names?    There are too many variations in pronunciation among English-speaking  countries, not to mention English renditions of non-English names, for  pronunciations to be included. American English pronunciations are  included for some countries like Qatar and Kiribati.    Why is the name of the Labour party misspelled?    When American and British spellings of common English words differ, The  World Factbook always uses the American spelling, even when these  common words form part of a proper name in British English.        Policies and Procedures    What is The World Factbook's source for a specific subject field?    The Factbook staff uses many different sources to publish what we judge  are the most reliable and consistent data for any particular category.  Space considerations preclude a listing of these various sources.    The names of some geographic features provided in the Factbook differ "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2756"],[0,"Marquise Brinvillier (#12)"],[1,"terrified.    \"Madame, I will do as you wish,\" he answered; \"but you would be acting  kindly if you could spare me for a few hours. I might go home, and  Father Chavigny would stay with you.\"    \"Ah!\" she cried, wringing her hands, \"you promised you would not leave  me till I am dead, and now you go away. Remember, I never saw you before  this morning, but since then you have become more to me than any of my  oldest friends.\"    \"Madame,\" said the good doctor, \"I will do all I can to please you. If I  ask for a little rest, it is in order that I may resume my place with  more vigour to-morrow, and render you better service than I otherwise  could. If I take no rest, all I say or do must suffer. You count on the  execution for tomorrow; I do not know if you are right; but if so,  to-morrow will be your great and decisive day, and we shall both need  all the strength we have. We have already been working for thirteen or  fourteen hours for the good of your salvation; I am not a strong man,  and I think you should realise, madame, that if you do not let me rest a  little, I may not be able to stay with you to the end.\"    \"Sir,\" said the marquise, \"you have closed my mouth. To-morrow is for me  a far more important day than to-day, and I have been wrong: of course  you must rest to-night. Let us just finish this one thing, and read over  what we have written.\"    It was done, and the doctor would have retired; but the supper came in,  and the marquise would not let him go without taking something. She told  the concierge to get a carriage and charge it to her. She took a cup of  soup and two eggs, and a minute later the concierge came back to say the  carriage was at the door. Then the marquise bade the doctor good-night,  making him promise to pray for her and to be at the Conciergerie by six  o'clock the next morning. This he promised her.    The day following, as he went into the tower, he found Father Chavigny,  who had taken his place with the marquise, kneeling and praying with  her. The priest was weeping, but she was calm, and received the doctor  in just the same way as she had let him go. When Father Chavigny saw  him, he retired. The marquise begged Chavigny to pray for her, and  wanted to make him promise to return, but that he would not do. She then  turned to the doctor, saying, \"Sir, you are punctual, and I cannot  complain that you have broken your promise; but oh, how the time has  dragged, and how long it has seemed before the clock struck six!\"    \"I am here, madame,\" said the doctor; \"but first of all, how have you  spent the night?\"    \"I have written three letters,\" said the marquise, \"and, short as they  were, they took a long time to write: one was to my sister, one to  Madame de Marillac, and the third to M. Couste. I should have liked to  show them to you, but Father Chavigny offered to take charge of them,  and as he had approved of them, I could not venture to suggest any  doubts. After the letters were written, we had some conversation and  prayer; but when the father took up his breviary and I my rosary with  the same intention, I felt so weary that I asked if I might lie on my  bed; he said I might, and I had two good hours' sleep without dreams or  any sort of uneasiness; when I woke we prayed together, and had just  finished when you came back.\"    \"Well, madame,\" said the doctor, \"if you will, we can pray again; kneel  down, and let us say the 'Veni Sancte Spiritus'.\"    She obeyed, and said the prayer with much unction and piety. The prayer  finished, M. Pirot was about to take up the pen to go on with the  confession, when she said, \"Pray let me submit to you one question which  is troubling me. Yesterday you gave me great hope of the mercy of God;  but I cannot presume to hope I shall be saved without spending a long  time in purgatory; my crime is far too atrocious to be pardoned on any  other conditions; and when I have attained to a love of God far greater  than I can feel here, I should not expect to be saved before my stains  have been purified by fire, without suffering the penalty that my sins  have deserved. But I have been told that the flames of purgatory where  souls are burned for a time are just the same as the flames of hell  where those who are damned burn through all eternity tell me, then, how  can a soul awaking in purgatory at the moment of separation from this  body be sure that she is not really in hell? how can she know that the  flames that burn her and consume not will some day cease? For the  torment she suffers is like that of the damned, and the flames wherewith  she is burned are even as the flames of hell. This I would fain know,  that at this awful moment I may feel no doubt, that I may know for  certain whether I dare hope or must despair.\"    \"Madame,\" replied the doctor, \"you are right, and God is too just to add  the horror of uncertainty to His rightful punishments. At that moment  when the soul quits her earthly body the judgment of God is passed upon  her: she hears the sentence of pardon or of doom; she knows whether she  is in the state of grace or of mortal sin; she sees whether she is to be  plunged forever into hell, or if God sends her for a time to purgatory.  This sentence, madame, you will learn at the very instant when the  executioner's axe strikes you; unless, indeed, the fire of charity has  so purified you in this life that you may pass, without any purgatory at  all, straight to the home of the blessed who surround the throne of the  Lord, there to receive a recompense for earthly martyrdom.\"    \"Sir,\" replied the marquise, \"I have such faith in all you say that I  feel I understand it all now, and I am satisfied.\"    The doctor and the marquise then resumed the confession that was  interrupted the night before. The marquise had during the night  recollected certain articles that she wanted to add. So they continued,  the doctor making her pause now and then in the narration of the heavier  offences to recite an act of contrition.    After an hour and a half they came to tell her to go down. The registrar  was waiting to read her the sentence. She listened very calmly,  kneeling, only moving her head; then, with no alteration in her voice,  she said, \"In a moment: we will have one word more, the doctor and I,  and then I am at your disposal.\" She then continued to dictate the rest  of her confession. When she reached the end, she begged him to offer a  short prayer with her, that God might help her to appear with such  becoming contrition before her judges as should atone for her scandalous  effrontery. She then took up her cloak, a prayer-book which Father  Chavigny had left with her, and followed the concierge, who led her to  the torture chamber, where her sentence was to be read.    First, there was an examination which lasted five hours. The marquise  told all she had promised to tell, denying that she had any accomplices,  and affirming that she knew nothing of the composition of the poisons  she had administered, and nothing of their antidotes. When this was  done, and the judges saw that they could extract nothing further, they  signed to the registrar to read the sentence. She stood to hear it: it  was as follows:    \"That by the finding of the court, d'Aubray de Brinvilliers is convicted  of causing the death by poison of Maitre Dreux d'Aubray, her father, and  of the two Maitres d'Aubray, her brothers, one a civil lieutenant, the  other a councillor to the Parliament, also of attempting the life of  Therese d'Aubray, her sister; in punishment whereof the court has  condemned and does condemn the said d'Aubray de Brinvilliers to make the  rightful atonement before the great gate of the church of Paris, whither  she shall be conveyed in a tumbril, barefoot, a rope on her neck,  holding in her hands a burning torch two pounds in weight; and there on  her knees she shall say and declare that maliciously, with desire for  revenge and seeking their goods, she did poison her father, cause to be  poisoned her two brothers, and attempt the life of her sister, whereof  she doth repent, asking pardon of God, of the king, and of the judges;  and when this is done, she shall be conveyed and carried in the same  tumbril to the Place de Greve of this town, there to have her head cut  off on a scaffold to be set up for the purpose at that place; afterwards  her body to be burnt and the ashes scattered; and first she is to be  subjected to the question ordinary and extraordinary, that she may  reveal the names of her accomplices. She is declared to be deprived of  all successions from her said father, brothers, and sister, from the  date of the several crimes; and all her goods are confiscated to the  proper persons; and the sum of 4000 livres shall be paid out of her  estate to the king, and 400 livres to the Church for prayers to be said  on behalf of the poisoned persons; and all the costs shall be paid,  including those of Amelin called Lachaussee. In Parliament, 16th July  1676.\"    The marquise heard her sentence without showing any sign of fear or  weakness. When it was finished, she said to the registrar, \"Will you,  sir, be so kind as to read it again? I had not expected the tumbril, and  I was so much struck by that that I lost the thread of what followed.\"    The registrar read the sentence again. From that moment she was the  property of the executioner, who approached her. She knew him by the  cord he held in his hands, and extended her own, looking him over coolly  from head to foot without a word. The judges then filed out, disclosing  as they did so the various apparatus of the question. The marquise  firmly gazed upon the racks and ghastly rings, on which so many had been  stretched crying and screaming. She noticed the three buckets of water    [Note: The torture with the water was thus administered. There were  eight vessels, each containing 2 pints of water. Four of these were  given for the ordinary,"]]]
