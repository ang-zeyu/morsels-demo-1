[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2743"],[0,"Massacres of the South (1551-1815) (#12)"],[1,"day, of the month of February 1703.\"    M de Montrevel obeyed this proclamation to the letter. For instance, one  day--the 1st of April 1703--as he was seated at dinner it was reported  to him that about one hundred and fifty Reformers were assembled in a  mill at Carmes, outside Nimes, singing psalms. Although he was told at  the same time that the gathering was composed entirely of old people and  children, he was none the less furious, and rising from the table, gave  orders that the call to horse should be sounded. Putting himself at the  head of his dragoons, he advanced on the mill, and before the Huguenots  knew that they were about to be attacked they were surrounded on every  side. It was no combat which ensued, for the Huguenots were incapable of  resistance, it was simply a massacre; a certain number of the dragoons  entered the mill sword in hand, stabbing all whom they could reach,  whilst the rest of the force stationed outside before the windows  received those who jumped out on the points of their swords. But soon  this butchery tired the butchers, and to get over the business more  quickly, the marshal, who was anxious to return to his dinner, gave  orders that the mill should be set on fire. This being done, the  dragoons, the marshal still at their head, no longer exerted themselves  so violently, but were satisfied with pushing back into the flames the  few unfortunates who, scorched and burnt, rushed out, begging only for a  less cruel death.    Only one victim escaped. A beautiful young girl of sixteen was saved by  the marshal's valet: both were taken and condemned to death; the young  girl was hanged, and the valet was on the point of being executed when  some Sisters of Mercy from the town threw themselves at the marshal's  feet end begged for his life: after long supplication, he granted their  prayer, but he banished the valet not only from his service, but from  Nimes.    The very same evening at supper word was brought to the marshal that  another gathering had been discovered in a garden near the still smoking  mill. The indefatigable marshal again rose from table, and taking with  him his faithful dragoons, surrounded the garden, and caught and shot on  the spot all those who were assembled in it. The next day it turned out  that he had made a mistake: those whom he had shot were Catholics who  had gathered together to rejoice over the execution of the Calvinists.  It is true that they had assured the marshal that they were Catholics,  but he had refused to listen to them. Let us, however, hasten to assure  the reader that this mistake caused no further annoyance to the marshal,  except that he received a paternal remonstrance from the Bishop of  Nimes, begging him in future not to confound the sheep with the wolves.    In requital of these bloody deeds, Cavalier took the chateau of Serras,  occupied the town of Sauve, formed a company of horse, and advancing to  Nimes, took forcible possession of sufficient ammunition for his  purposes. Lastly, he did something which in the eyes of the courtiers  seemed the most incredible thing of all, he actually wrote a long letter  to Louis XIV himself. This letter was dated from the \"Desert, Cevennes,\"  and signed \"Cavalier, commander of the troops sent by God\"; its purpose  was to prove by numerous passages from Holy Writ that Cavalier and his  comrades had been led to revolt solely from a sense of duty, feeling  that liberty of conscience was their right; and it dilated on the  subject of the persecutions under which Protestants had suffered, and  asserted that it was the infamous measures put in force against them  which had driven them to take up arms, which they were ready to lay down  if His Majesty would grant them that liberty in matters of religion  which they sought and if he would liberate all who were in prison for  their faith. If this were accorded, he assured the king His Majesty  would have no more faithful subjects than themselves, and would  henceforth be ready to shed their last drop of blood in his service, and  wound up by saying that if their just demands were refused they would  obey God rather than the king, and would defend their religion to their  last breath.    Roland, who, whether in mockery or pride, began now to call himself  \"Comte Roland,\" did not lag behind his young brother either as warrior  or correspondent. He had entered the town of Ganges, where a wonderful  reception awaited him; but not feeling sure that he would be equally  well received at St. Germain and St. Andre, he had written the following  letters:--    \"Gentlemen and officers of the king's forces, and citizens of St.  Germain, make ready to receive seven hundred troops who have vowed to  set Babylon on fire; the seminary and the houses of MM. de Fabregue, de  Sarrasin, de Moles, de La Rouviere, de Musse, and de Solier, will be  burnt to the ground. God, by His Holy Spirit, has inspired my brother  Cavalier and me with the purpose of entering your town in a few days;  however strongly you fortify yourselves, the children of God will bear  away the victory. If ye doubt this, come in your numbers, ye soldiers of  St. Etienne, Barre, and Florac, to the field of Domergue; we shall be  there to meet you. Come, ye hypocrites, if your hearts fail not. \"COMTE  ROLAND.\"    The second letter was no less violent. It was as follows:--    \"We, Comte Roland, general of the Protestant troops of France assembled  in the Cevennes in Languedoc, enjoin on the inhabitants of the town of  St. Andre of Valborgne to give proper notice to all priests and  missionaries within it, that we forbid them to say mass or to preach in  the afore-mentioned town, and that if they will avoid being burnt alive  with their adherents in their churches and houses, they are to withdraw  to some other place within three days. \"COMTE ROLAND.\"    Unfortunately for the cause of the king, though the rebels met with some  resistance in the villages of the plain, such as St. Germain and St.  Andre, it was otherwise with those situated in the mountains; in those,  when beaten, the Protestants found cover, when victorious rest; so that  M. de Montrevel becoming aware that while these villages existed heresy  would never be extirpated, issued the following ordinance:--    \"We, governor for His most Christian Majesty in the provinces of  Languedoc and Vivarais, do hereby make known that it has pleased the  king to command us to reduce all the places and parishes hereinafter  named to such a condition that they can afford no assistance to the  rebel troops; no inhabitants will therefore be allowed to remain in  them. His Majesty, however, desiring to provide for the subsistence of  the afore-mentioned inhabitants, orders them to conform to the following  regulations. He enjoins on the afore-mentioned inhabitants of the  hereinafter-mentioned parishes to repair instantly to the places  hereinafter appointed, with their furniture, cattle, and in general all  their movable effects, declaring that in case of disobedience their  effects will be confiscated and taken away by the troops employed to  demolish their houses. And it is hereby forbidden to any other commune  to receive such rebels, under pain of having their houses also razed to  the ground and their goods confiscated, and furthermore being regarded  and treated as rebels to the commands of His Majesty.\"    To this proclamation were appended the following instructions:--    \"I. The officers who may be appointed to perform the above task shall  first of all make themselves acquainted with the position of the  parishes and villages which are to be destroyed and depopulated, in  order to an effective disposition of the troops, who are to guard the  militia engaged in the work of destruction.    \"II. The attention of the officers is called to the following:--When two  or more villages or hamlets are so near together that they may be  protected at the same time by the same troops, then in order to save  time the work is to be carried on simultaneously in such villages or  hamlets.    \"III. When inhabitants are found still remaining in any of the  proscribed places, they are to be brought together, and a list made of  them, as well as an inventory taken of their stock and corn.    \"IV. Those inhabitants who are of the most consequence among them shall  be selected to guide the others to the places assigned.    \"V. With regard to the live stock, the persons who may be found in  charge of it shall drive it to the appointed place, save and except  mules and asses, which shall be employed in the transport of corn to  whatever places it may be needed in. Nevertheless, asses may be given to  the very old, and to women with child who may be unable to walk.    \"VI. A regular distribution of the militia is to be made, so that each  house to be destroyed may have a sufficient number, for the task; the  foundations of such houses may be undermined or any other method  employed which may be most convenient; and if the house can be destroyed  by no other means, it is to be set on fire.    \"VII. No damage is to be done to the houses of former Catholics until  further notice, and to ensure the carrying out of this order a guard is  to be placed in them, and an inventory of their contents taken and sent  to Marechal de Montrevel.    \"VIII. The order forbidding the inhabitants to return to their houses is  to be read to the inhabitants of each village; but if any do return they  shall not be harmed, but simply driven away with threats; for the king  does not desire that blood be shed; and the said order shall be affixed  to a wall or tree in each village.    \"IX. Where no inhabitants are found, the said order shall simply be  affixed as above-mentioned in each place.    \"(Signed) \"MARECHAL DE MONTREVEL\"    Under these instructions the list of the villages to be destroyed was  given. It was as follows:        18 in the parish of Frugeres,        5    \"      \""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2744"],[0,"Mary Stuart (#12)"],[1,"ed, refused to attend it.    Mary's delusion was short-lived: scarcely was she in Bothwell's power  than she saw what a master she had given herself. Gross, unfeeling, and  violent, he seemed chosen by Providence to avenge the faults of which he  had been the instigator or the accomplice. Soon his fits of passion  reached such a point, that one day, no longer able to endure them, Mary  seized a dagger from Erskine, who was present with Melville at one of  these scenes, and would have struck herself, saying that she would  rather die than continue living unhappily as she did; yet, inexplicable  as it seems, in spite of these miseries, renewed without ceasing, Mary,  forgetting that she was wife and queen, tender and submissive as a  child, was always the first to be reconciled with Bothwell.    Nevertheless, these public scenes gave a pretext to the nobles, who only  sought an opportunity for an outbreak. The Earl of Mar, the young  prince's tutor, Argyll, Athol, Glencairn, Lindley, Boyd, and even Morton  and Maitland themselves, those eternal accomplices of Bothwell, rose,  they said, to avenge the death of the king, and to draw the son from  hands which had killed the father and which were keeping the mother  captive. As to Murray, he had kept completely in the background during  all the last events; he was in the county of Fife when the king was  assassinated, and three days before the trial of Bothwell he had asked  and obtained from his sister permission to take a journey on the  Continent.    The insurrection took place in such a prompt and instantaneous manner,  that the Confederate lords, whose plan was to surprise and seize both  Mary and Bothwell, thought they would succeed at the first attempt.    The king and queen were at table with Lord Borthwick, who was  entertaining them, when suddenly it was announced that a large body of  armed men was surrounding the castle: Bothwell and Mary suspected that  they were aimed at, and as they had no means of resistance, Bothwell  dressed himself as a squire, Mary as a page, and both immediately taking  horse, escaped by one door just as the Confederates were coming in by  the other. The fugitives withdrew to Dunbar.    There they called together all Bothwell's friends, and made them sign a  kind of treaty by which they undertook to defend the queen and her  husband. In the midst of all this, Murray arrived from France, and  Bothwell offered the document to him as to the others; but Murray  refused to put his signature to it, saying that it was insulting him to  think he need be bound by a written agreement when it was a question of  defending his sister and his queen. This refusal having led to an  altercation between him and Bothwell, Murray, true to his system of  neutrality, withdrew into his earldom, and let affairs follow without  him the fatal decline they had taken.    In the meantime the Confederates, after having failed at Borthwick, not  feeling strong enough to attack Bothwell at Dunbar, marched upon  Edinburgh, where they had an understanding with a man of whom Bothwell  thought himself sure. This man was James Balfour, governor of the  citadel, the same who had presided over the preparation of the mine  which had blown up Darnley, and whom Bothwell had, met on entering the  garden at Kirk of Field. Not only did Balfour deliver Edinburgh Castle  into the hands of the Confederates, but he also gave them a little  silver coffer of which the cipher, an \"F\" crowned, showed that it had  belonged to Francis II; and in fact it was a gift from her first  husband, which the queen had presented to Bothwell. Balfour stated that  this coffer contained precious papers, which in the present  circumstances might be of great use to Mary's enemies. The Confederate  lords opened it, and found inside the three genuine or spurious letters  that we have quoted, the marriage contract of Mary and Bothwell, and  twelve poems in the queen's handwriting. As Balfour had said, therein  lay, for her enemies, a rich and precious find, which was worth more  than a victory; for a victory would yield them only the queen's life,  while Balfour's treachery yielded them her honour.          CHAPTER IV      Meanwhile Bothwell had levied some troops, and thought himself in a  position to hold the country: accordingly, he set out with his army,  without even waiting for the Hamiltons, who were assembling their  vassals, and June 15th, 1567, the two opposed forces were face to face.  Mary, who desired to try to avoid bloodshed, immediately sent the French  ambassador to the Confederate lords to exhort them to lay aside their  arms; but they replied \"that the queen deceived herself in taking them  for rebels; that they were marching not against her, but against  Bothwell.\" Then the king's friends did what they could to break off the  negotiations and give battle: it was already too late; the soldiers knew  that they were defending the cause of one man, and that they were going  to fight for a woman's caprice, and not for the good of the country:  they cried aloud, then, that \"since Bothwell alone was aimed at, it was  for Bothwell to defend his cause\". And he, vain and blustering as usual,  gave out that he was ready to prove his innocence in person against  whomsoever would dare to maintain that he was guilty. Immediately  everyone with any claim to nobility in the rival camp accepted the  challenge; and as the honour was given to the bravest, Kirkcaldy of  Grange, Murray of Tullibardine, and Lord Lindsay of Byres defied him  successively. But, be it that courage failed him, be it that in the  moment of danger he did not himself believe in the justice of his cause,  he, to escape the combat, sought such strange pretexts that the queen  herself was ashamed; and his most devoted friends murmured.    Then Mary, perceiving the fatal humour of men's minds, decided not to  run the risk of a battle. She sent a herald to Kirkcaldy of Grange, who  was commanding an outpost, and as he was advancing without distrust to  converse with the queen, Bothwell, enraged at his own cowardice, ordered  a soldier to fire upon him; but this time Mary herself interposed,  forbidding him under pain of death to offer the least violence. In the  meanwhile, as the imprudent order given by Bothwell spread through the  army, such murmurs burst forth that he clearly saw that his cause was  for ever lost.    That is what the queen thought also; for the result of her conference  with Lord Kirkcaldy was that she should abandon Bothwell's cause, and  pass over into the camp of the Confederates, on condition that they  would lay down their arms before her and bring her as queen to  Edinburgh. Kirkcaldy left her to take these conditions to the nobles,  and promised to return next day with a satisfactory answer. But at the  moment of leaving Bothwell, Mary was seized again with that fatal love  for him that she was never able to surmount, and felt herself overcome  with such weakness, that, weeping bitterly, and before everyone, she  wanted Kirkcaldy to be told that she broke off all negotiations;  however, as Bothwell had understood that he was no longer safe in camp,  it was he who insisted that things should remain as they were; and,  leaving Mary in tears, he mounted, and setting off at full speed, he did  not stop till he reached Dunbar.    Next day, at the time appointed, the arrival of Lord Kirkcaldy of Grange  was announced by the trumpeters preceding him. Mary mounted directly and  went to meet him; them, as he alighted to greet her, \"My lord;\" said  she, \"I surrender to you, on the conditions that you have proposed to me  on the part of the nobles, and here is my hand as a sign of entire  confidence\". Kirkcaldy then knelt down, kissed the queen's hand  respectfully; and, rising, he took her horse by the bridle and led it  towards the Confederates' camp.    Everyone of any rank in the army received her with such marks of respect  as entirely to satisfy her; but it was not so at all with the soldiers  and common people. Hardly had the queen reached the second line, formed  by them, than great murmurs arose, and several voices cried, \"To the  stake, the adulteress! To the stake, the parricide!\" However, Mary bore  these outrages stoically enough but a more terrible trial yet was in  store for her. Suddenly she saw rise before her a banner, on which was  depicted on one side the king dead and stretched out in the fatal  garden, and on the other the young prince kneeling, his hands joined and  his eyes raised to heaven, with this inscription, \"O Lord! judge and  revenge my cause!\" Mary reined in her horse abruptly at this sight, and  wanted to turn back; but she had scarcely moved a few paces when the  accusing banner again blocked her passage. Wherever she went, she met  this dreadful apparition. For two hours she had incessantly under her  eyes the king's corpse asking vengeance, and the young prince her son  praying God to punish the murderers. At last she could endure it no  longer, and, crying out, she threw herself back, having completely lost  consciousness, and would have fallen, if someone had not caught hold of  her. In the evening she entered Edinburgh, always preceded by the cruel  banner, and she already had rather the air of a prisoner than of a  queen; for, not having had a moment during the day to attend to her  toilet, her hair was falling in disorder about her shoulders, her face  was pale and showed traces of tears; and finally, her clothes were  covered with dust and mud. As she proceeded through the town, the  hootings of the people and the curses of the crowd followed her. At  last, half dead with fatigue, worn out with grief, bowed down with  shame, she reached the house of the Lord Provost; but scarcely had she  got there when the entire population of Edinburgh crowded into the  square, with cries that from time to time assumed a tone of terrifying  menace. Several times, then, Mary wished to go "]]]
