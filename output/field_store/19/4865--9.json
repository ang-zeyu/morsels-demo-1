(Volume 1 of 2) (#12)"],[1,"on't know what is coming, only we do not admire the  grim determination of our driver's mouth, or the devilry flashing from  his eyes. The rest of the passengers say nothing. They know Dandy Jack,  and are philosophically resigned to their fate.    And now we plunge down the side of a gully, steep and wooded, with a  brawling torrent pouring along its bottom. The road runs obliquely down  the incline, and this descent we proceed to accomplish at a furious  gallop, Dandy Jack shouting and encouraging his horses; his mate riding  beside them, and flogging them to harder exertions. Then we see what is  before us.    Right at the bottom of the steep road is a bridge across the creek; or,  at least, what was once a bridge, for a freshet or something seems to  have torn it partially up. Originally built by throwing tree-trunks  across from bank to bank, and covering these with planking, what we now  see seems little more than a bare skeleton; for nearly all the planking  is gone, and only the rough bare logs remain--and of these several are  displaced, so that uncomfortable-looking gaps appear. Some feet below  the level of this ruined bridge a regular cataract is flowing. Across  the frail scaffolding--you can call it no more--that spans the torrent,  it is clearly Dandy Jack's intention to hurl the coach, trusting to the  impetus to get it over. We shut our eyes in utter despair of a safe  issue, and hold on to our seats with the clutch of drowning men. It is  all that we can do.    Meanwhile the four horses, maddened by the whoops and lashes of our  excited Jehu and his aid, are tearing down the slope at racing speed.  The coach is bounding, rocking, jolting at their heels in frightfully  dangerous fashion. We dare not glance at Dandy Jack, but we feel that he  is in his element; and that, consequently, we are in deadly peril. Then  the chorus of yells grows louder and fiercer, the swish of the whips  more constant and furious. There is a tremendous rattle, a series of  awful bumps that seem to dislocate every bone in my body, a feeling that  the coach is somersaulting, I appear to be flying through space among  the stars, and then--all is blank.    When I recall my shocked and scattered senses, a minute or two later, I  find myself half-buried, head downward, among moss and fern. I pick  myself out of that, and stupidly feel myself all over, fortunately  finding that I have sustained no particular injury. Then I survey the  scene.    We are on the other side of the stream--so much I discover--but we have  evidently not attained it without a mishap. Not to put too fine a point  upon it, we have experienced a most decided spill. The coach has  overturned just as it crossed the bridge, and passengers and baggage  have been shot forth into the world at large. Fortunately, the ground  was soft with much vegetation, so that no one is much hurt; the  \"insides\" alone being badly bruised. There is a confused heap of  plunging hoofs, and among them Dandy Jack and Yankee Bill are already  busy, loosening the traces and getting the horses on their feet.    The passengers go one by one to their assistance, and much objurgation  and ornamental rhetoric floats freely through the atmosphere. Presently,  the coach is got on its wheels again by united effort, and it is found  to be none the worse for the accident. In truth, its builder seems to  have had an eye to such casualties as that we have suffered, and has  adapted the construction of the machine to meet them.    But with the horses it is different. Three of them are speedily got on  their legs and rubbed down, being no more than scared. The fourth,  however, cannot rise, and examination shows that one of its legs is  broken, and probably the spine injured as well. It is evident the poor  creature is past all further service. So Dandy Jack sits on its head,  while Yankee Bill pulls out his sheath-knife and puts the animal out of  misery. I overhear our eccentric driver murmuring--      \"Woe worth the chase, woe worth the day    That cost thy life, my gallant grey!\"--    Adding, in a louder voice--    \"Twelve pounds I paid for that critter; but I reckon I've had the profit  out of it, anyhow!\"    The horse that Yankee Bill was riding is now unsaddled and hitched up  with the others, in place of the dead one. For baggage and passengers  are being collected again, and it seems we are going on as though  nothing had happened.    It is, perhaps, not strange that no one should express surprise at the  accident; but it is certainly singular that no one shows any resentment  towards our driver, or blames him in any way. The prevailing feeling is  one of simple congratulation that things are no worse. One would think  the accident was quite a usual affair, and had even been expected. A  passenger remarks quite seriously--    \"I will say this for Dandy Jack: he always contrives that you shall  pitch into a soft place.\"    They seem about to offer a vote of thanks to this reckless madman, for  having overturned us without hurt to any one! It occurs to us two  new-chums that our life in this country is likely to be eventful, if  this kind of thing is the ordinary style of coaching. And we begin to  understand what our driver meant, when he alluded to the grave  responsibility of having a lady among his passengers; for his driving is  only comparable to the driving of the son of Nimshi.    Before we proceed on our way, the foppery of our charioteer reasserts  itself. Of course, his neat and spruce trim has been considerably  disarrayed, so now he proceeds to reorganize his appearance. Gravely and  calmly he draws brushes and so on from a receptacle under the box-seat,  and commences to titivate himself. This is too much. Laughter and jibes  and energetic rebukes fall on him thick as hail. At first he pays no  attention; then he says slowly--    \"Look here! If any one wants to walk the rest of the way, he can do it.  I'm willing to split fares for the half journey!\"    There is a covert threat in this, and as no one cares to quarrel with  the speaker, his eccentricities are allowed to develop themselves  without further interference. Then we resume our drive on to  Helensville.    For the most part the road passes through open country, but we now more  frequently see scrub and bush in various directions. At one place,  indeed, for about two miles, we pass through forest. The trees, mostly  kahikatea, seem to our English eyes of stupendous proportions, but we  are told they grow much bigger in many other parts. Signs of human life  are not altogether wanting in these wilds. We pass a dray coming down  from the Kaipara, laden with wool, and pull up, that Dandy Jack may have  a private conversation with the driver of it. This dray is a huge  waggon, built in a very strong and substantial style, and it is drawn by  twelve span of bullocks.    Here and there among the fern, usually in the bottom of a gully beside  some patch of scrub, we have noticed little clusters of huts. These are  not Maori whares, as we suppose at first, but are the temporary  habitations of gum-diggers, a nomadic class who haunt the waste tracts  where kauri-gum is to be found buried in the soil. In a few places we  pass by solitary homesteads, looking very comfortable in the midst of  their more or less cultivated paddocks and clearings. These are usually  fixed on spots where the soil, for a space of a few hundred acres,  happens to be of better quality than the gum-lands around. At most of  these settlers' houses somebody is on the look-out for the coach, and  there is a minute's halt to permit of the exchange of mails or news. For  travellers along the road are very few in number, and the bi-weekly  advent of the coach is an event of importance.    The afternoon is wearing late, and the rays of the declining sun are  lengthening the shadows, when we emerge on the top of a high hill that  overlooks the valley of the Kaipara. A wide and magnificent prospect  lies spread before us. Far down below the river winds through a broad  valley, the greater expanse of which, being low and swampy, is covered  with a dense thicket of luxuriant vegetation. In parts we see great  masses of dark, sombre forest, but even in the distance this is relieved  by variety of colouring, flowering trees, perhaps, or the brilliant  emerald of clusters of tree-ferns. Right out on the western boundary a  line of hills shuts out the sea, and their summits glisten with a  strange ruddy and golden light--the effect of the sun shining on the  wind-driven sand that covers them. To the north the river widens and  winds, until, far away, we get a glimpse of the expanding waters of  the Kaipara Harbour. Successive hills and rolling ranges, clothed with  primeval forest, close in upon the valley.    About the centre of the broad-stretching vale, we discern a little patch  of what looks like grass and cleared land. There is here a cluster of  houses, whitely gleaming beside the river, and that hamlet is  Helensville--the future town and metropolis of the Kaipara.    The road, from the hill-top where we are, winds in a long descent of  about two miles down to the township. It is scarcely needful to say that  Dandy Jack considers it incumbent on him to make his entrance into  Helensville with as much flourish and _eclat_ as possible. Accordingly,  we proceed along the downhill track at breakneck speed, and come  clattering and shouting into the village, amid much bustle and  excitement. We are finally halted in an open space before the hotel,  which is evidently intended to represent a village green or public  square, the half-dozen houses of the place being scattered round it.    The entire population has turned out to witness our arrival: a score or  so of bearded, sunburnt, rough-looking men, three or four women, and a  group of boys and children. A babel of conversation ensues. We, as  new-chums, are speedily surrounded by a group anxious to make"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29084"],[0,"The Cook and Housekeeper's Complete and Universal Dictionary; Including a System (#12)"],[1,"then reducing it to  powder in a mortar, a salt nearly equal to basket salt may be obtained,  fine and of a good colour, and well adapted to the use of the table.      BATH BUNS. Rub half a pound of butter into a pound of fine flour, with  five eggs, and three spoonfuls of thick yeast. Set it before the fire to  rise; then add a quarter of a pound of powdered sugar, and an ounce of  carraway seeds. Mix them well in, roll it out in little cakes, strew on  carraway comfits, and bake on tins.      BATTER PUDDING. Rub by degrees three spoonfuls of fine flour extremely  smooth, into a pint of milk. Simmer till it thickens, stir it in two  ounces of butter, set it to cool, and then add the yolks of three eggs.  Flour a wet cloth, or butter a bason, and put the batter into it. Tie it  tight, and plunge it into boiling water, the bottom upwards. Boil it an  hour and a half, and serve with plain butter. If a little ginger,  nutmeg, and lemon peel be added, serve with sweet sauce.      BEAN BREAD. Blanch half a pound of almonds, and put them into water to  preserve their colour. Cut the almonds edgeways, wipe them dry, and  sprinkle over them half a pound of fine loaf sugar pounded and sifted.  Beat up the white of an egg with two spoonfuls of orange-flower water,  moisten the almonds with the froth, lay them lightly on wafer paper, and  bake them on tins.      BEAN PUDDING. Boil and blanch some old green-beans, beat them in a  mortar, with very little pepper and salt, some cream, and the yolk of an  egg. A little spinach-juice will give a finer colour, but it is as good  without. Boil it an hour, in a bason that will just hold it; pour  parsley and butter over, and serve it up with bacon.      BEE HIVES. Common bee hives made of straw are generally preferred,  because they are not likely to be overheated by the rays of the sun;  they will also keep out the cold better than wood, and are cheaper than  any other material. As cleanliness however is of great consequence in  the culture of these delicate and industrious insects, the bottom or  floor of the hive should be covered with gypsum or plaster of Paris, of  which they are very fond; and the outside of their habitation should be  overspread with a cement made of two-thirds of cow-dung, and one-third  of ashes. This coating will exclude noxious insects, which would  otherwise perforate and lodge in the straw; it will also secure the bees  from cold and wet, while it exhales an odour which to them is very  grateful. The inner part of the hive should be furnished with two thin  pieces of oak, or peeled branches of lime tree, placed across each other  at right angles, which will greatly facilitate the construction of the  combs, and support them when filled with honey. A good bee-hive ought to  be so planned as to be capable of enlargement or contraction, according  to the number of the swarm; to admit of being opened without disturbing  the bees, either for the purpose of cleaning it, of freeing it from  noxious insects, or for the admission of a stock of provision for the  winter. It should also admit of the produce being removed without injury  to the bees, and be internally clean, smooth, and free from flaws. A  hive of this description may easily be made of three or four open square  boxes, fastened to each other with buttons or wooden pegs, and the  joints closed with cement. The whole may be covered with a moveable  roof, projecting over the boxes to carry off the rain, and kept firm on  the top by a stone being laid upon it. If the swarm be not very  numerous, two or three boxes will be sufficient. They should be made of  wood an inch thick, that the bees and wax may be less affected by the  changes of the atmosphere. This hive is so easily constructed, that it  is only necessary to join four boards together in the simplest manner;  and a little cement will cover all defects. Within the upper part of the  boxes, two bars should be fixed across from one corner to another, to  support the combs. At the lower end of each box in front, there must be  an aperture, or door, about an inch and an half wide, and as high as is  necessary for the bees to pass without obstruction. The lowest is to be  left open as a passage for the bees, and the others are to be closed by  a piece of wood fitted to the aperture. A hive thus constructed may be  enlarged or diminished, according to the number of boxes; and a  communication with the internal part can readily be effected by removing  the cover.      BEE HOUSE. An apiary or bee house should front the south, in a situation  between the extremes of heat and cold. It should stand in a valley, that  the bees may with greater ease descend loaded on their return to the  hive; and near a dwelling-house, but at a distance from noise and  offensive smells; surrounded with a low wall, and in the vicinity of  shallow water. If there be no running stream at hand, they ought to be  supplied with water in troughs or pans, with small stones laid at the  bottom, that the bees may alight upon them and drink. They cannot  produce either combs, honey, or food for their maggots, without water;  but the neighbourhood of rivers or ponds with high banks ought to be  avoided, or the bees will be blown into the water with high winds, and  be drowned. Care should also be taken to place the hives in a  neighbourhood which abounds with such plants as will supply the bees  with food; such as the oak, the pine, the willow, fruit trees, furze,  broom, mustard, clover, heath, and thyme, particularly borage, which  produces an abundance of farina. The garden in which the bee house  stands, should be well furnished with scented plants and flowers, and  branchy shrubs, that it may be easy to hive the swarms which may settle  on them. See BEES, HIVING, &c.      BEEF. In every sort of provisions, the best of the kind goes the  farthest; it cuts out with most advantage, and affords most nourishment.  The best way to obtain a good article is to deal with shops of  established credit. You may perhaps pay a little more than by purchasing  of those who pretend to sell cheap, but you will be more than in  proportion better served. To prevent imposition more effectually,  however, it is necessary to form our own judgment of the quality and  value of the articles to be purchased. If the flesh of ox-beef is young,  it will show a fine smooth open grain, be of a good red, and feel  tender. The fat should look white rather than yellow, for when that is  of a deep colour, the meat is seldom good. Beef fed with oil cakes is  generally so, and the flesh is loose and flabby. The grain of cow-beef  is closer, and the fat whiter, than that of ox-beef; but the lean is not  so bright a red. The grain of bull-beef is closer still, the fat hard  and skinny, the lean of a deep red, and a stronger scent. Ox-beef is the  reverse; it is also the richest and the largest; but in small families,  and to some tastes, heifer-beef as better still, if finely fed. In old  meat there is a horny streak in the ribs of beef: the harder that is,  the older: and the flesh is not finely flavoured.      BEEF BOUILLI. A term given to boiled beef, which, according to the  French fashion, is simmered over a slow fire, for the purpose of  extracting a rich soup, while at the same time the meat makes its  appearance at table, in possession of a full portion of nutricious  succulence. This requires nothing more than to stew the meat very  slowly, instead of keeping the pot quickly boiling, and taking up the  beef as soon as it is done enough. Meat cooked in this manner, affords  much more nourishment than when dressed in the common way, and is easy  of digestion in proportion to its tenderness. The leg or shin, or the  middle of a brisket of beef, weighing seven or eight pounds, is best  adapted for this purpose. Put it into a soup pot or deep stewpan with  cold water enough to cover it, and a quart over. Set it on a quick fire  to get the scum up, which remove as it rises; then put in two carrots,  two turnips, two leeks, or two large onions, two heads of celery, two  or three cloves, and a faggot of parsley and sweet herbs. Set the pot by  the side of the fire to simmer very gently, till the meat is just tender  enough to eat: this will require four or five hours. When the beef is  done, take it up carefully with a slice, cover it up, and keep it warm  by the fire. Thicken a pint and a half of the beef liquor with three  table spoonfuls of flour, season it with pepper, a glass of port wine or  mushroom ketchup, or both, and pour it over the beef. Strain the soup  through a hair sieve into a clean stewpan, take off the fat, cut the  vegetables into small squares, and add them to the soup, the flavour of  which may be heightened, by adding a table-spoonful of ketchup.      BEEF BROTH. If intended for sick persons, it is better to add other  kinds of meat, which render it more nourishing and better flavoured.  Take then two pounds of lean beef, one pound of scrag of veal, one pound  of scrag of mutton, some sweet herbs, and ten pepper corns, and put the  whole into a nice tin saucepan, with five quarts of water. Simmer it to  three quarts, clear it from the fat when cold, and add an onion if  approved. If there be still any fat remaining, lay a piece of clean  blotting or writing paper on the broth when in the bason, and it will  take up every particle of the fat.      BEEF CAKES, chiefly intended for a side-dish of dressed meat. Pound some  beef that is under done, with a little fat bacon or ham. Season with  pepper, salt, a little shalot or garlick; mix them well, and make the  whole into small cakes three inches long, and half as wide and thick.  Fry them to a light brown, and serve them in good thick gravy.      BEEF CECILS. Mince some beef with crumbs of bread, a quantity of onions,  some anchovies, lemon peel, salt, nutmeg, chopped parsley, pepper, and  a bit of warmed butter. Mix these over the fire"]]]
