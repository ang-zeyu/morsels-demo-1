Neither bluebird nor  woodrat can hide from my seeing,\" he said, snapping his beak. \"Neither  of them, unless they hide under bushes. Yet I have failed to see  anything of the Maidens ye seek for. Send for my younger brother, the  Falcon. Strong of flight is he, yet not so strong as I, and nearer the  ground he takes his way ere sunrise.\"    Then the Eagle spread his wings and flew away to Twin Mountain. The  Warrior-Priests of the Bow sped again fleetly over the plain to the  westward for his younger brother, Falcon.    Sitting on an ant hill, so the warriors found Falcon. He paused as they  approached, crying, \"If ye have snare strings, I will be off like the  flight of an arrow well plumed of our feathers!\"    \"No,\" said the priests. \"Thy elder brother hath bidden us seek thee.\"    Then they told Falcon what had happened, and how Eagle had failed to  find the Corn Maidens, so white and beautiful.    \"Failed!\" said Falcon. \"Of course he failed. He climbs aloft to the  clouds and thinks he can see under every bush and into every shadow, as  sees the Sunfather who sees not with eyes. Go ye before.\"    Before the Warrior-Priests had turned toward the town, the Falcon had  spread his sharp wings and was skimming off over the tops of the trees  and bushes as though verily seeking for field mice or birds' nests. And  the Warriors returned to tell the fathers and to await his coming.    But after Falcon had searched over the world, to the north and west, to  the east and south, he too returned and was received as had been Eagle.  He settled on the edge of a tray before the altar, as on the ant hill he  settles today. When he had smoked and had been smoked, as had been  Eagle, he told the sorrowing fathers and mothers that he had looked  behind every copse and cliff shadow, but of the Maidens he had found no  trace.    \"They are hidden more closely than ever sparrow hid,\" he said. Then he,  too, flew away to his hills in the west.    \"Our beautiful Maiden Mothers,\" cried the matrons. \"Lost, lost as the  dead are they!\"    \"Yes,\" said the others. \"Where now shall we seek them? The far-seeing  Eagle and the close-searching Falcon alike have failed to find them.\"    \"Stay now your feet with patience,\" said the fathers. Some of them had  heard Raven, who sought food in the refuse and dirt at the edge of town,  at daybreak.    \"Look now,\" they said. \"There is Heavy-nose, whose beak never fails to  find the substance of seed itself, however little or well hidden it be.  He surely must know of the Corn Maidens. Let us call him.\"    So the warriors went to the river side. When they found Raven, they  raised their hands, all weaponless.    \"We carry no pricking quills,\" they called. \"Blackbanded father, we seek  your aid. Look now! The Mother-maidens of Seed whose substance is the  food alike of thy people and our people, have fled away. Neither our  grandfather the Eagle, nor his younger brother the Falcon, can trace  them. We beg you to aid us or counsel us.\"    \"Ka! ka!\" cried the Raven. \"Too hungry am I to go abroad fasting on  business for ye. Ye are stingy! Here have I been since perching time,  trying to find a throatful, but ye pick thy bones and lick thy bowls too  clean for that, be sure.\"    \"Come in, then, poor grandfather. We will give thee food to cat. Yea,  and a cigarette to smoke, with all the ceremony.\"    \"Say ye so?\" said the Raven. He ruffled his collar and opened his mouth  so wide with a lusty kaw-la-ka--that he might well have swallowed his  own head. \"Go ye before,\" he said, and followed them into the court of  the dancers.    He was not ill to look upon. Upon his shoulders were bands of white  cotton, and his back was blue, gleaming like the hair of a maiden dancer  in the sunlight. The Master-Priest greeted Raven, bidding him sit and  smoke.    \"Ha! There is corn in this, else why the stalk of it?\" said the Raven,  when he took the cane cigarette of the far spaces and noticed the joint  of it. Then he did as he had seen the Master-Priest do, only more  greedily. He sucked in such a throatful of the smoke, fire and all, that  it almost strangled him. He coughed and grew giddy, and the smoke all  hot and stinging went through every part of him. It filled all his  feathers, making even his brown eyes bluer and blacker, in rings. It is  not to be wondered at, the blueness of flesh, blackness of dress, and  skinniness, yes, and tearfulness of eye which we see in the Raven  to-day. And they are all as greedy of corn food as ever, for behold! No  sooner had the old Raven recovered than he espied one of the ears of  corn half hidden under the mantle-covers of the trays. He leaped from  his place laughing. They always laugh when they find anything, these  ravens. Then he caught up the ear of corn and made off with it over the  heads of the people and the tops of the houses, crying.    \"Ha! ha! In this wise and in no other will ye find thy Seed Maidens.\"    But after a while he came back, saying, \"A sharp eye have I for the  flesh of the Maidens. But who might see their breathing-beings, ye  dolts, except by the help of the Father of Dawn-Mist himself, whose  breath makes breath of others seem as itself.\" Then he flew away cawing.    Then the elders said to each other, \"It is our fault, so how dare we  prevail on our father Paiyatuma to aid us? He warned us of this in the  old time.\"    Suddenly, for the sun was rising, they heard Paiyatuma in his daylight  mood and transformation. Thoughtless and loud, uncouth in speech, he  walked along the outskirts of the village. He joked fearlessly even of  fearful things, for all his words and deeds were the reverse of his  sacred being. He sat down on a heap of vile refuse, saying he would have  a feast.    \"My poor little children,\" he said. But he spoke to aged priests and  white-haired matrons.    \"Good-night to you all,\" he said, though it was in full dawning. So he  perplexed them with his speeches.    \"We beseech thy favor, oh father, and thy aid, in finding our beautiful  Maidens.\" So the priests mourned.    \"Oh, that is all, is it? But why find that which is not lost, or summon  those who will not come?\"    Then he reproached them for not preparing the sacred plumes, and picked  up the very plumes he had said were not there.    Then the wise Pekwinna, the Speaker of the Sun, took two plumes and the  banded wing-tips of the turkey, and approaching Paiyatuma stroked him  with the tips of the feathers and then laid the feathers upon his  lips....    Then Paiyatuma became aged and grand and straight, as is a tall tree  shorn by lightning. He said to the father:    \"Thou are wise of thought and good of heart. Therefore I will summon  from Summer-land the beautiful Maidens that ye may look upon them once  more and make offering of plumes in sacrifice for them, but they are  lost as dwellers amongst ye.\"    Then he told them of the song lines and the sacred speeches and of the  offering of the sacred plume wands, and then turned him about and sped  away so fleetly that none saw him.    Beyond the first valley of the high plain to the southward Paiyatuma  planted the four plume wands. First he planted the yellow, bending over  it and watching it. When it ceased to flutter, the soft down on it  leaned northward but moved not. Then he set the blue wand and watched  it; then the white wand. The eagle down on them leaned to right and left  and still northward, yet moved not. Then farther on he planted the red  wand, and bending low, without breathing, watched it closely. The soft  down plumes began to wave as though blown by the breath of some small  creature. Backward and forward, northward and southward they swayed, as  if in time to the breath of one resting.    \"'T is the breath of my Maidens in Summer-land, for the plumes of the  southland sway soft to their gentle breathing. So shall it ever be. When  I set the down of my mists on the plains and scatter my bright beads in  the northland(7), summer shall go thither from afar, borne on the breath  of the Seed Maidens. Where they breathe, warmth, showers, and fertility  shall follow with the birds of Summer-land, and the butterflies,  northward over the world.\"    Then Paiyatuma arose and sped by the magic of his knowledge into the  countries of Summer-land,--fled swiftly and silently as the soft breath  he sought for, bearing his painted flute before him. And when he paused  to rest, he played on his painted flute and the butterflies and birds  sought him. So he sent them to seek the Maidens, following swiftly, and  long before he found them he greeted them with the music of his  songsound, even as the People of the Seed now greet them in the song of  the dancers.    When the Maidens heard his music and saw his tall form in their great  fields of corn, they plucked ears, each of her own kind, and with them  filled their colored trays and over all spread embroidered  mantles,--embroidered in all the bright colors and with the  creature-songs of Summer-land. So they sallied forth to meet him and  welcome him. Then he greeted them, each with the touch of his hands and  the breath of his flute, and bade them follow him to the northland home  of their deserted children.    So by the magic of their knowledge they sped back as the stars speed  over the world at night time, toward the home of our ancients. Only at  night and dawn they journeyed, as the dead do, and the stars also. So  they came at evening in the full of the last moon to the Place of the  Middle, bearing their trays of seed.    Glorious was Paiyatuma, as he walked into the courts of the dancers in  the dusk of the evening and stood with folded arms at the foot of the  bow-fringed ladder of priestly council, he and his follower Shutsukya.  He was tall and beautiful and banded with his own mists, and carried the  banded"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25049"],[0,"My Reminiscences of the Anglo-Boer War (#12)"],[1," and we rode back; but on nearing the Pretoria Laager, I  found to my dismay that there were only 22 of us left. What was to be  done? This handful of men was of very little use; yet to return would  have been cowardly, and besides, in the meantime our laager would have  gone on, and would now be several hours' riding ahead of us. I sent  some burghers in advance to see what was happening to the Pretoria  Laager. It seemed strange to me that the place should still be in the  hands of our men, seeing that all the other commandos had long since  retired. After waiting fully an hour, our scouts came back with the  information that the laager was full of English soldiers, and that  they had been able to hear them quarrelling about the booty left  behind by the burghers.    It was now two o'clock in the morning. Our Pretoria comrades were  apparently safe, and considerably relieved we decided to ride to  Elandslaagte which my men would by that time have surely reached. Our  carts were sooner or later bound to arrive there, inasmuch as they  were in charge of a field-cornet known to us as one of our best  \"retreat officers.\" I think it was splendid policy under the  circumstances to appoint such a gentleman to such a task; I felt sure  that the enemy would never overtake him and capture his carts. We  followed the main road, which was fortunately not held by the enemy,  as had been reported to us. On the way we encountered several carts  and waggons which had been cast away by the owners for fear of being  caught up by the pursuing troops. Of course the rumour that this road  was in possession of the English was false, but it increased the panic  among the burghers. Not only carts had been left behind, but, as we  found in places, sacks of flour, tins of coffee, mattresses and other  jettison, thrown out of the carts to lighten their burden.    On nearing Elandslaagte we caught up the rear of the fleeing  commandos. Here we learned that Generals Botha and Meyer were still  behind us with their commandos, near Lombardsdorp. We off-saddled,  exhausted and half starving. Luckily, some of the provisions of our  commissariat, which had been stored here during the Ladysmith  investment, had not been carried away. But, to our disgust, we found  that the Commissariat-Commissioner had set fire to the whole of it, so  we had to appease our hunger by picking half-burned potatoes out of a  fire.    At 7 o'clock next morning General Botha and his men arrived at  Elandslaagte and off-saddled in hopes of getting something to eat.  They were also doomed to disappointment. Such wanton destruction of  God's bounty was loudly condemned, and had Mr. Pretorius, the  Commissioner of Stores, not been discreet enough to make himself  scarce, he would no doubt have been subjected to a severe  \"sjamboking.\" Later in the day a council of war was held, and it was  decided that we should all stay there for the day, in order to stop  the enemy if they should pursue us. Meantime we would allow the  convoys an opportunity of getting to the other side of the Sunday  River.    The British must have been so overjoyed at the relief of Ladysmith  that Generals Buller and White did not think it necessary to pursue  us, at any rate for some time, a consideration for which we were  profoundly grateful. Methinks General Buller must have felt that he  had paid a big price for the relief of Ladysmith, for it must have  cost him many more lives than he had relieved. But in that place were  a few Jingos (Natal Jingos) who had to be released, I suppose, at any  costs.    My burghers and I had neither cooking utensils nor food, and were  anxious to push forward and find our convoys; for we had not as yet  learned to live without carts and commissariat. At dusk the  generals--I have no idea who they were--ordered us to hold the  \"randjes\" south of the Sunday River till the following day, and that  no burghers were to cross the river. This order did not seem to please  the majority, but the Generals had put a guard near the bridge, with  instructions to shoot any burghers and their horses should they try to  get to the other side; so they had perforce, to remain where they  were. Now I had only 22 men under my command, and I did not think  these would make an appreciable difference to our fighting force, so I  said to myself: \"To-night we shall have a little game with the  generals for once.\"    We rode towards the bridge, and of course the guard there threatened  to fire on us if we did not go back immediately. My adjutant, however,  rode up and said: \"Stand back, you ----! This is Commandant Viljoen,  who has been ordered to hurry up a patrol at ----\" (mentioning some  place a few miles away) \"which is in imminent danger of being  captured.\"    The guards, quite satisfied, stepped back and favoured us with a  military salute as we rode by. When we had been riding a little way I  heard someone ask them what \"people\" they were who had passed over the  bridge, and I caught the words: \"Now you will see that they will all  want to cross.\"    I do not contend I was quite right in acting in this insubordinate  manner, but we strongly objected to being put under the guard of other  commandos by some one irresponsible general. I went on that night  till we reached the Biggarsbergen, and next day sent out scouts in the  direction of the Drakensbergen to inquire for the scattered remains of  my commando. The mountains were covered with cattle from the laagers  about Glencoe Station. The Boers there were cooking food, shoeing  their horses, or repairing their clothes; in fact, they were very  comfortable and very busy. They remarked: \"There are many more  burghers yonder with the General; we are quite sure of that.\" ... \"The  Commandant-General is near Glencoe and will stop the retreating men.\"    In short, as was continually happening in the War, everything was left  to chance and the Almighty. Luckily General Botha had deemed it his  duty to form a rearguard and cover our retreat; otherwise the English  would have captured a large number of laagers, and many burghers whose  horses were done up. But, whereas we had too little discipline, the  English had evidently too much. It is not for me to say why General  Buller did not have us followed up; but it seems that the British  lost a splendid chance.    Some days went by without anything of note happening. My scouts  returned on the third day and reported that my commando and its laager  had safely got through, and could be expected the next day. Meanwhile  I had procured some provisions at Glencoe, and for the time being we  had nothing to complain about.    I was very much amused next day to receive by despatch-rider a copy of  a telegram from Glencoe sent by General Joubert to General Prinsloo at  Harrismith (Orange Free State) asking for information regarding  several missing commandos and officers, amongst whom my name appeared,  while the telegram also contained the startling news that my commando  had been reported cut up at Klip River and that I had been killed in  action! This was the second time that I was killed, but one eventually  gets used to that sort of thing.    I sent, by the despatch-rider, this reply:--    \"I and my commando are very much alive!\" Adding: \"Tell the General we  want four slaughter oxen.\"    The following day I received orders to attend a council of war which  was to be held at Glencoe Station. The principal object of this  gathering was to discuss further plans of operation, to decide as to  where our next positions were to be taken, and where the new fighting  line would be formed.    [Illustration: General Joubert opening a Council of War with Prayer.]    We all met at the appointed time in a big unoccupied hall near Glencoe  Station, where General Joubert opened the last council that he was to  conduct in this world. Over 50 officers were present and the interest  was very keen for several reasons. In the first place we all desired  some official information about the fate of General Cronje and his  burghers at Paardeburg, and in the second place some expected to hear  something definite about the intervention of which so much had been  said and written of late. In fact many thought that Russia, France,  Germany or the United States of America would surely intervene so soon  as the fortunes of war began to turn against us. My personal opinion  was stated just before the war at a public meeting, held in  Johannesburg, where I said: \"If we are driven to war we must not rely  for deliverance on foreign powers, but on God and the Mauser.\"    Some officers thought we ought to retire to our frontiers as far as  Laing's Nek, and it was generally believed that this proposal would be  adopted. According to our custom General Joubert opened the council  with an address, in which he described the situation in its details.  It was evident that our Commandant-General was very low-spirited and  melancholy, and was suffering greatly from that painful internal  complaint which was so soon to put an end to his career.    No less than eleven assisting commandants and fighting generals were  present, and yet not one could say who was next in command to General  Joubert. I spoke to some friends about the irregularities which  occurred during our retreat from Ladysmith: how all the generals were  absent except Botha and Meyer, while the latter was on far from good  terms with General Joubert since the unfortunate attack on Platrand.  This was undoubtedly due to the want of co-operation on the part of  the various generals, and I resolved if possible, to bring our army  into a closer union. I therefore proposed a motion:--         \"That all the generals be asked to resign, with the       exception of one assistant commandant-general and one       fighting general.\"    Commandant Engelbrecht had promised to second my proposal, but when it  was read out his courage failed him. The motion, moreover, was not"]]]
