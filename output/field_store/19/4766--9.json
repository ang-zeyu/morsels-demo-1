It is hard to be poor. I know it. I am poor.\"    \"You poor!\" said Clorinda, kissing her. \"Why, you are the richest  woman I know, Aunt Emmy--rich in love and goodness and contentment.\"    \"And so are you, dearie ... rich in youth and health and happiness and  ambition. Aren't they all worth while?\"    \"Of course they are,\" laughed Clorinda. \"Only, unfortunately,  Christmas gifts can't be coined out of them.\"    \"Did you ever try?\" asked Aunt Emmy. \"Think out that question, too, in  your thinking out, Clorinda.\"    \"Well, I must say bye-bye and run home. I feel cheered up--you always  cheer people up, Aunt Emmy. How grey it is outdoors. I do hope we'll  have snow soon. Wouldn't it be jolly to have a white Christmas? We  always have such faded brown Decembers.\"    Clorinda lived just across the road from Aunt Emmy in a tiny white  house behind some huge willows. But Aunt Mary lived there too--the  only relative Clorinda had, for Aunt Emmy wasn't really her aunt at  all. Clorinda had always lived with Aunt Mary ever since she could  remember.    Clorinda went home and upstairs to her little room under the eaves,  where the great bare willow boughs were branching athwart her windows.  She was thinking over what Aunt Emmy had said about Christmas gifts  and giving.    \"I'm sure I don't know what she could have meant,\" pondered Clorinda.  \"I do wish I could find out if it would help me any. I'd love to  remember a few of my friends at least. There's Miss Mitchell ... she's  been so good to me all this year and helped me so much with my  studies. And there's Mrs. Martin out in Manitoba. If I could only send  her something! She must be so lonely out there. And Aunt Emmy herself,  of course; and poor old Aunt Kitty down the lane; and Aunt Mary and,  yes--Florence too, although she did treat me so meanly. I shall never  feel the same to her again. But she gave me a present last Christmas,  and so out of mere politeness I ought to give her something.\"    Clorinda stopped short suddenly. She had just remembered that she  would not have liked to say that last sentence to Aunt Emmy.  Therefore, there was something wrong about it. Clorinda had long ago  learned that there was sure to be something wrong in anything that  could not be said to Aunt Emmy. So she stopped to think it over.    Clorinda puzzled over Aunt Emmy's meaning for four days and part of  three nights. Then all at once it came to her. Or if it wasn't Aunt  Emmy's meaning it was a very good meaning in itself, and it grew  clearer and expanded in meaning during the days that followed,  although at first Clorinda shrank a little from some of the  conclusions to which it led her.    \"I've solved the problem of my Christmas giving for this year,\" she  told Aunt Emmy. \"I have some things to give after all. Some of them  quite costly, too; that is, they will cost me something, but I know  I'll be better off and richer after I've paid the price. That is what  Mr. Grierson would call a paradox, isn't it? I'll explain all about it  to you on Christmas Day.\"    On Christmas Day, Clorinda went over to Aunt Emmy's. It was a faded  brown Christmas after all, for the snow had not come. But Clorinda  did not mind; there was such joy in her heart that she thought it the  most delightful Christmas Day that ever dawned.    She put the queer cornery armful she carried down on the kitchen floor  before she went into the sitting room. Aunt Emmy was lying on the sofa  before the fire, and Clorinda sat down beside her.    \"I've come to tell you all about it,\" she said.    Aunt Emmy patted the hand that was in her own.    \"From your face, dear girl, it will be pleasant hearing and telling,\"  she said.    Clorinda nodded.    \"Aunt Emmy, I thought for days over your meaning ... thought until I  was dizzy. And then one evening it just came to me, without any  thinking at all, and I knew that I could give some gifts after all. I  thought of something new every day for a week. At first I didn't think  I _could_ give some of them, and then I thought how selfish I was. I  would have been willing to pay any amount of money for gifts if I had  had it, but I wasn't willing to pay what I had. I got over that,  though, Aunt Emmy. Now I'm going to tell you what I did give.    \"First, there was my teacher, Miss Mitchell. I gave her one of  father's books. I have so many of his, you know, so that I wouldn't  miss one; but still it was one I loved very much, and so I felt that  that love made it worth while. That is, I felt that on second thought.  At first, Aunt Emmy, I thought I would be ashamed to offer Miss  Mitchell a shabby old book, worn with much reading and all marked over  with father's notes and pencillings. I was afraid she would think it  queer of me to give her such a present. And yet somehow it seemed to  me that it was better than something brand new and unmellowed--that  old book which father had loved and which I loved. So I gave it to  her, and she understood. I think it pleased her so much, the real  meaning in it. She said it was like being given something out of  another's heart and life.    \"Then you know Mrs. Martin ... last year she was Miss Hope, my dear  Sunday School teacher. She married a home missionary, and they are in  a lonely part of the west. Well, I wrote her a letter. Not just an  ordinary letter; dear me, no. I took a whole day to write it, and you  should have seen the postmistress's eyes stick out when I mailed it. I  just told her everything that had happened in Greenvale since she went  away. I made it as newsy and cheerful and loving as I possibly could.  Everything bright and funny I could think of went into it.    \"The next was old Aunt Kitty. You know she was my nurse when I was a  baby, and she's very fond of me. But, well, you know, Aunt Emmy, I'm  ashamed to confess it, but really I've never found Aunt Kitty very  entertaining, to put it mildly. She is always glad when I go to see  her, but I've never gone except when I couldn't help it. She is very  deaf, and rather dull and stupid, you know. Well, I gave her a whole  day. I took my knitting yesterday, and sat with her the whole time and  just talked and talked. I told her all the Greenvale news and gossip  and everything else I thought she'd like to hear. She was so pleased  and proud; she told me when I came away that she hadn't had such a  nice time for years.    \"Then there was ... Florence. You know, Aunt Emmy, we were always  intimate friends until last year. Then Florence once told Rose Watson  something I had told her in confidence. I found it out and I was so  hurt. I couldn't forgive Florence, and I told her plainly I could  never be a real friend to her again. Florence felt badly, because she  really did love me, and she asked me to forgive her, but it seemed as  if I couldn't. Well, Aunt Emmy, that was my Christmas gift to her ...  my forgiveness. I went down last night and just put my arms around her  and told her that I loved her as much as ever and wanted to be real  close friends again.    \"I gave Aunt Mary her gift this morning. I told her I wasn't going to  Murraybridge, that I just meant to stay home with her. She was so  glad--and I'm glad, too, now that I've decided so.\"    \"Your gifts have been real gifts, Clorinda,\" said Aunt Emmy.  \"Something of you--the best of you--went into each of them.\"    Clorinda went out and brought her cornery armful in.    \"I didn't forget you, Aunt Emmy,\" she said, as she unpinned the paper.    There was a rosebush--Clorinda's own pet rosebush--all snowed over  with fragrant blossoms.    Aunt Emmy loved flowers. She put her finger under one of the roses and  kissed it.    \"It's as sweet as yourself, dear child,\" she said tenderly. \"And it  will be a joy to me all through the lonely winter days. You've found  out the best meaning of Christmas giving, haven't you, dear?\"    \"Yes, thanks to you, Aunt Emmy,\" said Clorinda softly.          Cyrilla's Inspiration      It was a rainy Saturday afternoon and all the boarders at Mrs.  Plunkett's were feeling dull and stupid, especially the Normal School  girls on the third floor, Cyrilla Blair and Carol Hart and Mary  Newton, who were known as The Trio, and shared the big front room  together.    They were sitting in that front room, scowling out at the weather. At  least, Carol and Mary were scowling. Cyrilla never scowled; she was  sitting curled up on her bed with her Greek grammar, and she smiled at  the rain and her grumbling chums as cheerfully as possible.    \"For pity's sake, Cyrilla, put that grammar away,\" moaned Mary. \"There  is something positively uncanny about a girl who can study Greek on  Saturday afternoons--at least, this early in the term.\"    \"I'm not really studying,\" said Cyrilla, tossing the book away. \"I'm  only pretending to. I'm really just as bored and lonesome as you are.  But what else is there to do? We can't stir outside the door; we've  nothing to read; we can't make candy since Mrs. Plunkett has forbidden  us to use the oil stove in our room; we'll probably quarrel all round  if we sit here in idleness; so I've been trying to brush up my Greek  verbs by way of keeping out of mischief. Have you any better  employment to offer me?\"    \"If it were only a mild drizzle we might go around and see the  Patterson girls,\" sighed Carol. \"But there is no venturing out in such  a downpour. Cyrilla, you are supposed to be the brainiest one of us.  Prove your claim to such pre-eminence by thinking of some brand-new  amusement, especially suited to rainy afternoons. That will be putting  your grey matter to better use than squandering it on Greek verbs out  of study limits.\"    \"If only I'd got a letter from home today,\" said Mary, who seemed  determined to persist in gloom. \"I wouldn't mind the weather. Letters  are such cheery things:--especially the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24877"],[0,"Lucy Maud Montgomery Short Stories, 1907 to 1908 (#12)"],[1,". Nobody knew much about how he got along, for the  Appleby house is half a mile from anywhere, down near the shore at the  end of a long lane--the lonesomest place, as I did not fail to  remember when I was considering Isaac's offer.    \"I heard Jarvis Aldrich say Isaac had got a dog lately,\" said Melissa,  when we finally came in sight of the house--a handsome new one, by the  way, put up only ten years ago. \"Jarvis said it was an imported  breed. I do hope it isn't cross.\"    I have a mortal horror of dogs, and I followed Melissa into the big  farmyard with fear and trembling. We were halfway across the yard when  Melissa shrieked:    \"Anne, there's the dog!\"    There was the dog; and the trouble was that he didn't stay there, but  came right down the slope at a steady, business-like trot. He was a  bull-dog and big enough to bite a body clean in two, and he was the  ugliest thing in dogs I had ever seen.    Melissa and I both lost our heads. We screamed, dropped our parasols,  and ran instinctively to the only refuge that was in sight--a ladder  leaning against the old Appleby house. I am forty-five and something  more than plump, so that climbing ladders is not my favorite form of  exercise. But I went up that one with the agility and grace of  sixteen. Melissa followed me, and we found ourselves on the  roof--fortunately it was a flat one--panting and gasping, but safe,  unless that diabolical dog could climb a ladder.    I crept cautiously to the edge and peered over. The beast was sitting  on his haunches at the foot of the ladder, and it was quite evident he  was not short on time. The gleam in his eye seemed to say:    \"I've got you two unprincipled subscription hunters beautifully treed  and it's treed you're going to stay. That is what I call satisfying.\"    I reported the state of the case to Melissa.    \"What shall we do?\" I asked.    \"Do?\" said Melissa, snappishly. \"Why, stay here till Isaac Appleby  comes out and takes that brute away? What else can we do?\"    \"What if he isn't at home?\" I suggested.    \"We'll stay here till he comes home. Oh, this is a nice predicament.  This is what comes of cushioning churches!\"    \"It might be worse,\" I said comfortingly. \"Suppose the roof hadn't  been flat?\"    \"Call Isaac,\" said Melissa shortly.    I didn't fancy calling Isaac, but call him I did, and when that failed  to bring him Melissa condescended to call, too; but scream as we  might, no Isaac appeared, and that dog sat there and smiled  internally.    \"It's no use,\" said Melissa sulkily at last. \"Isaac Appleby is dead or  away.\"    Half an hour passed; it seemed as long as a day. The sun just boiled  down on that roof and we were nearly melted. We were dreadfully  thirsty, and the heat made our heads ache, and I could see my muslin  dress fading before my very eyes. As for the roses on my best hat--but  that was too harrowing to think about.    Then we saw a welcome sight--Isaac Appleby coming through the yard  with a hoe over his shoulder. He had probably been working in his  field at the back of the house. I never thought I should have been so  glad to see him.    \"Isaac, oh, Isaac!\" I called joyfully, leaning over as far as I dared.    Isaac looked up in amazement at me and Melissa craning our necks over  the edge of the roof. Then he saw the dog and took in the situation.  The creature actually grinned.    \"Won't you call off your dog and let us get down, Isaac?\" I said  pleadingly.    Isaac stood and reflected for a moment or two. Then he came slowly  forward and, before we realized what he was going to do, he took that  ladder down and laid it on the ground.    \"Isaac Appleby, what do you mean?\" demanded Melissa wrathfully.    Isaac folded his arms and looked up. It would be hard to say which  face was the more determined, his or the dog's. But Isaac had the  advantage in point of looks, I will say that for him.    \"I mean that you two women will stay up on that roof until one of you  agrees to marry me,\" said Isaac solemnly.    I gasped.    \"Isaac Appleby, you can't be in earnest?\" I cried incredulously. \"You  couldn't be so mean?\"    \"I am in earnest. I want a wife, and I am going to have one. You two  will stay up there, and Julius Caesar here will watch you until one of  you makes up her mind to take me. You can settle it between  yourselves, and let me know when you have come to a decision.\"    And with that Isaac walked jauntily into his new house.    \"The man can't mean it!\" said Melissa. \"He is trying to play a joke on  us.\"    \"He does mean it,\" I said gloomily. \"An Appleby never says anything he  doesn't mean. He will keep us here until one of us consents to marry  him.\"    \"It won't be me, then,\" said Melissa in a calm sort of rage. \"I won't  marry him if I have to sit on this roof for the rest of my life. You  can take him. It's really you he wants, anyway; he asked you first.\"    I always knew that rankled with Melissa.    I thought the situation over before I said anything more. We certainly  couldn't get off that roof, and if we could, there was Julius Caesar.  The place was out of sight of every other house in Jersey Cove, and  nobody might come near it for a week. To be sure, when Melissa and I  didn't turn up the Covites might get out and search for us; but that  wouldn't be for two or three days anyhow.    Melissa had turned her back on me and was sitting with her elbows  propped up on her knees, looking gloomily out to sea. I was afraid I  couldn't coax her into marrying Isaac. As for me, I hadn't any real  objection to marrying him, after all, for if he was short of romance  he was good-natured and has a fat bank account; but I hated to be  driven into it that way.    \"You'd better take him, Melissa,\" I said entreatingly. \"I've had one  husband and that is enough.\"    \"More than enough for me, thank you,\" said Melissa sarcastically.    \"Isaac is a fine man and has a lovely house; and you aren't sure the  Kingsbridge man really means anything,\" I went on.    \"I would rather,\" said Melissa, with the same awful calmness, \"jump  down from this roof and break my neck, or be devoured piecemeal by  that fiend down there than marry Isaac Appleby.\"    It didn't seem worth while to say anything more after that. We sat  there in stony silence and the time dragged by. I was hot, hungry,  thirsty, cross; and besides, I felt that I was in a ridiculous  position, which was worse than all the rest. We could see Isaac  sitting in the shade of one of his apple trees in the front orchard  comfortably reading a newspaper. I think if he hadn't aggravated me by  doing that I'd have given in sooner. But as it was, I was determined  to be as stubborn as everybody else. We were four obstinate  creatures--Isaac and Melissa and Julius Caesar and I.    At four o'clock Isaac got up and went into the house; in a few minutes  he came out again with a basket in one hand and a ball of cord in the  other.    \"I don't intend to starve you, of course, ladies,\" he said politely,  \"I will throw this ball up to you and you can then draw up the  basket.\"    I caught the ball, for Melissa never turned her head. I would have  preferred to be scornful, too, and reject the food altogether; but I  was so dreadfully thirsty that I put my pride in my pocket and hauled  the basket up. Besides, I thought it might enable us to hold out until  some loophole of escape presented itself.    Isaac went back into the house and I unpacked the basket. There was a  bottle of milk, some bread and butter, and a pie. Melissa wouldn't  take a morsel of the food, but she was so thirsty she had to take a  drink of milk.    She tried to lift her veil--and something caught; Melissa gave it a  savage twitch, and off came veil and hat--and all her front hair!    You never saw such a sight. I'd always suspected Melissa wore a false  front, but I'd never had any proof before.    Melissa pinned on her hair again and put on her hat and drank the  milk, all without a word; but she was purple. I felt sorry for her.    And I felt sorry for Isaac when I tried to eat that bread. It was sour  and dreadful. As for the pie, it was hopeless. I tasted it, and then  threw it down to Julius Caesar. Julius Caesar, not being over  particular, ate it up. I thought perhaps it would kill him, for  anything might come of eating such a concoction. That pie was a strong  argument for Isaac. I thought a man who had to live on such cookery  did indeed need a wife and might be pardoned for taking desperate  measures to get one. I was dreadfully tired of broiling on the roof  anyhow.    But it was the thunderstorm that decided me. When I saw it coming up,  black and quick, from the northwest, I gave in at once. I had endured  a good deal and was prepared to endure more; but I had paid ten  dollars for my hat and I was not going to have it ruined by a  thunderstorm. I called to Isaac and out he came.    \"If you will let us down and promise to dispose of that dog before I  come here I will marry you, Isaac,\" I said, \"but I'll make you sorry  for it afterwards, though.\"    \"I'll take the risk of that, Anne,\" he said; \"and, of course, I'll  sell the dog. I won't need him when I have you.\"    Isaac meant to be complimentary, though you mightn't have thought so  if you had seen the face of that dog.    Isaac ordered Julius Caesar away and put up the ladder, and turned his  back, real considerately, while we climbed down. We had to go in his  house and stay till the shower was over. I didn't forget the object of  our call and I produced our subscription list at once.    \"How much have you got?\" asked Isaac.    \"Seventy dollars and we want a hundred and fifty,\" I said.    \"You may put me down for the remaining eighty, then,\" said Isaac  calmly.    The Applebys are never mean where money is concerned, I must say.    Isaac offered to drive us home when it cleared up, but I said \"No.\" I  wanted to settle Melissa before she got a chance to talk.    On the way home I said to"]]]
