It is during this last leap that it puts its neck into  the noose and is taken. If a keeper merely watches a snare until it is  \"lifted,\" good and well; but to put a hare or rabbit into it and then  pounce on the moucher--well, that is a different matter. It is not  difficult to see where a hare has been taken, especially if the run in  which the snare was set was damp. There will be the hole where the peg  has been, and the ground will be beaten flat by the struggles of the  animal in endeavouring to free itself.    Field-netting for rabbits may be prevented in the same way as for  partridges--by thorning the ground where the game feeds. It is quite a  mistake to plant thorns, or even to stake out large branches. The only  ones that at all trouble the poacher are small thorns which are left  absolutely free on the ground. These get into the net, roll it up  hopelessly in a short time, and if this once occurs everything escapes.  Large thorns are easily seen and easily removed, but the abominable ones  are the small ones left loose on the surface of the ground.    The most certain and wholesale method of rabbit poaching I ever  practised was also the most daring. The engine employed was the  \"well-trap.\" This is a square, deep box, built into the ground, and  immediately opposite to a smoot-hole in the fence through which the  rabbits run from wood or covert to field or pasture. Through a hole in  the wall or fence a wooden trough or box is inserted. As the rabbits run  through, the floor opens beneath their weight, and they drop into the  \"well.\" Immediately the pressure is removed the floor springs back to  its original position, and thus a score or more rabbits are often taken  in a single night. In the construction of these \"well-traps,\" rough and  unbarked wood is used, though, even after this precaution, the rabbits  will not take them for weeks. Then, they become familiar; the weather  washes away all scent, and the \"well\" is a wholesale engine of  destruction. All surface traces of the existence of the trap must be  covered over with dead leaves and woodland debris. The rabbits, of  course, are taken alive, and the best way of killing them is by  stretching them across the knee, and so dislocating the spine. If the  keeper once finds out the trap the game is up. Whilst it lasts, however,  it kills more rabbits than every other stroke of woodcraft the poacher  knows.          [Illustration]    Chapter 10.    TRICKS.      When it is known that a man's life is one long protest against the Game  Laws he has to be exceedingly careful of his comings and goings. Every  constable, every gamekeeper, and most workers in woodcraft are aware of  the motives which bring him abroad at night. More eyes are upon him  than he sees, and no one knows better than he that the enemies most to  be feared are those who are least seen; and the man who has tasted the  bitterness of poaching penalties will do everything in his power to  escape detection. Probably the greatest aid to this end is knowing the  country by heart; the field-paths and disused bye-ways, the fordable  parts of the river, and a hundred things beside. The poacher is and must  be suspicious of everyone he meets.    In planning and carrying out forays I was always careful to observe two  conditions. No poaching secret was ever confided to another; and I  invariably endeavoured to get to the ground unseen. If my out-going was  observed it often entailed a circuit of a dozen miles in coming home,  and even then the entry into town was not without considerable risk. The  hand of everyone was against me in my unlawful calling, and many were  the shifts I had to make to escape detection or capture. To show with  what success this may be carried out, the following incident will show.    [Illustration]    I conceived the idea of openly shooting certain well-stocked coverts  during the temporary absence of the owner. These were so well watched  that all the ordinary measures at night seemed likely to be baffled. To  openly shoot during broad day, and under the very eye of the keeper, was  now the essential part of the programme; and to this end I must explain  as follows: The keeper on the estate was but lately come to the  district. Upon two occasions when I had been placed in the dock, I had  been described as \"a poacher of gentlemanly appearance,\" and \"the  gentleman poacher again.\" (My forefathers had been small estatesmen for  generations, and I suppose that some last lingering air of gentility  attached to me). Well, I had arranged with a confederate to act as bag  carrier; he was to be very servile, and not to forget to touch his cap  at pretty frequent intervals. After \"making up\" as a country squire--(I  had closely studied the species on the \"Bench\")--and providing a  luncheon in keeping with my temporary \"squiredom,\" we started for the  woods. It was a bright morning in the last week of October, and  game--hares, pheasants, and woodcock--was exceedingly plentiful. The  first firing brought up the keeper, who touched his hat in the most  respectful fashion. He behaved, in short, precisely as I would have had  him behave. I lost no time on quietly congratulating him on the number  and quality of his birds; told him that his master would return from  town to-morrow (which I had learned incidentally), and ended by handing  him my cartridge bag to carry. A splendid bag of birds had been made by  luncheon time, and the viands which constituted the meal were very much  in keeping with my assumed position. Dusk came at the close of the short  October afternoon, and with it the end of our day's sport. The bag was  spread out in one of the rides of the wood, and in imagination I can see  it now--thirty-seven pheasants, nine hares, five woodcock, a few  rabbits, some cushats, and the usual \"miscellaneous.\" The man of gaiters  was despatched a couple of miles for a cart to carry the spoil, and a  substantial \"tip\" gave speed to his not unwilling legs. The game,  however, was not to occupy the cart. A donkey with panniers was waiting  in a clump of brush by the covert side, and as soon as the panniers were  packed, its head was turned homeward over a wild bit of moorland. With  the start obtained, chase would have been fruitless had it ever been  contemplated--which it never was. I need not detail the sequel to the  incident here, and may say that it was somewhat painful to myself as  well as my bag carrier. And I am sorry to say that the keeper was  summarily dismissed by the enraged squire as a reward for his innocence.  As to the coverts, they were so well stocked, that after a few days'  rest there appeared as much game as ever, and the contents of our little  bag were hardly missed.    [Illustration]    Another trick to which my co-worker used to resort was to attire himself  in broad-brimmed hat and black coat similar to those worn a century ago  by the people called Quakers. In the former he carried his nets, and in  the capacious pockets of the latter the game he took. These outward  guarantees of good faith, away from his own parish, precluded him from  ever once being searched. I have already remarked, and every practical  poacher knows it to be the fact, that the difficulty is not so much to  obtain game as to transport it safely home. Although our dogs were  trained to run on a hundred yards in advance so as to give warning of  the approach of a possible enemy--even this did not always save us. A  big bag of game handicaps one severely in a cross-country run, and it is  doubly galling to have to sacrifice it. Well, upon the particular  occasion to which I refer there was to be a country funeral with a  hearse from the neighbouring market town, and of this I was determined  to take advantage. By arranging with the driver I was enabled to stow  myself and a large haul in the body of the vehicle, and, although the  journey was a cramped and stuffy one, we in time reached our  destination. As we came behind the nearest game shop the driver undid  the door, and the questionable corpse was safely landed.    [Illustration]    I need hardly say that in a long life of poaching there were many  occasions when I was brought to book. These, however, would form but a  small percentage of the times I was \"out.\" My success in this way was  probably owing to the fact that I was chary as to those I took into  confidence, and knew that above all things keeping my own council was  the best wisdom. Another moucher I knew, but with whom I would have  nothing to do, was an instance of one who told poaching secrets to  village gossips. The \"Mole\" spent most of _his_ time in the county gaol,  and just lately he completed his sixty-fifth incarceration--only a few  of which were for offences outside the game laws. Well, there came a  time when all the keepers round the country side had their revenge on  me, and they made the most of it. I and my companion were fairly caught  by being driven into an ambuscade by a combination of keepers. Exultant  in my capture, the keepers from almost every estate in the neighbourhood  flocked to witness my conviction. Some of them who had at times only  seen a vanishing form in the darkness, now attended to see the man, as  they put it. As I had always been followed at nights by an old black  bitch, she, too, was produced in court, and proved an object of much  curiosity. Well, our case was called, and, as we had no good defence to  set up, it was agreed that my companion should do the talking. Without  letting it appear so, we had a very definite object in prolonging the  hearing of the case. There was never any great inclination to hurry such  matters, as the magistrates always seemed to enjoy them. \"We had been  taken in the act,\" my co-worker told the bench. \"We deserved no quarter,  and asked"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36974"],[0,"Old Trails on the Niagara Frontier (#12)"],[1,"rs, if  apprehended, were to be shot. In the letter just quoted from he reports  that this order had a good effect. Many curious circumstances arose at  the time, due to the British or American allegiance of men who before  the war had been friendly neighbors, but who now met as hostiles, as  captor and captive, sometimes as victor and victim. There was a constant  flight, by one route and another, of Loyalist refugees to Fort Niagara.  Thus, by a return of Feb. 12, 1779, 1,346 people were drawing rations  from the stores of that place, of whom sixty-four were \"distressed  families,\" that is, Tories who had fled from the colonies (mostly from  the Mohawk Valley); and 445 Indians. The war parties left early in the  spring, and during the summer the supply boats could get up from the  lower stations. Then came that march of destruction up the Genesee  Valley; winter shut down on lake and river communication, and the most  distressed period the frontier had known under British rule set in. In  October, immediately after the invasion, Col. Bolton wrote (I quote  briefly from a very full report): \"Joseph Brant ... assures me that if  500 men had joined the Rangers in time, there is no doubt that instead  of 300, at least 1,000 warriors would have turned out, and with that  force he is convinced that Mr. Sullivan would have had some reason to  repent of his expedition; but the Indians not being supported as they  expected, thought of nothing more than carrying off their families, and  we had at this Post the 21st of last month 5,036 to supply with  provisions, and notwithstanding a number of parties have been sent out  since, we have still on the ground 3,678 to maintain. I am convinced  your Excellency will not be surprised, if I am extremely alarmed, for to  support such a multitude I think will be absolutely impossible. I have  requested of Major Butler to try his utmost to prevail on the Indians  whose villages have been destroyed to go down to Montreal for the  winter, where, I have assured him, they would be well taken care of; and  to inform all the rest who have not suffered by the enemy that they must  return home and take care of their corn.\"    Neither plan worked as hoped for. It was difficult to get the Indians to  consent to go down the river, or even to Carleton Island; and as  Sullivan had destroyed every village save two, few of the Senecas could  be induced to return into the Genesee country. Bolton's urgent appeals  for extra provisions were also doomed to disappointment, owing to the  lateness of the season or the lack of transports.    The winter after Sullivan's raid, Guy Johnson distributed clothing to  more than 3,000 Indians at Fort Niagara. But the cost of clothing them  was trifling compared with the cost of feeding them. Expeditions against  the distant American settlements were planned, not more through the  desire for retaliation, than from the necessity of reducing the number  of dependents on Fort Niagara. When the inroads on provisions grew  serious, the Indians were encouraged to go on the war-path. But so  exceedingly severe was the winter, so deep was the snow on the trails,  that not until the middle of February could any parties be induced to  set out. The number camped around the fort, consuming the King's pork,  beef, flour and rum, rose as we have seen, to more than 5,000. Many  starved and many froze.    Much could be said regarding the British policy of dealing with the  Indians at Fort Niagara, but I may only touch upon the subject at this  time. Haldimand, and behind him the British Ministry, placed great  reliance upon them. The uniform instruction was that the Indians should  be maintained as allies. On April 10, 1778, Lord George Germaine wrote  to Gen. Haldimand that the designs of the rebels against Niagara and  Detroit were not likely to be successful as long as the Six Nations  continued faithful. Presents, honors, and the full license of the  tomahawk and scalping-knife were allowed them. With a view to promoting  their fidelity, Joseph Brant was made a colonel. Significant, too, was  the settling of a generous allowance for life upon Brant's sister, Sir  William Johnson's consort; which act was approved, about this time, by  the august council at Whitehall.    The British watched the state of the Indian mind as the sailor watches  his barometer at the coming of a storm. And the Indian mind, though  always cunning, was sometimes childlike in the directness and simplicity  of its conclusions. The constant flight to Fort Niagara of refugee  Tories was remarked by the savages, and in turn noted and reported to  Gen. Haldimand. \"The frequent passing of white people to Niagara,\" wrote  Capt. John Johnson to Gen. Carleton, October 6, 1778, \"is much taken  note of by the Indians, who say they are running away and that they (the  Tories) have begun the quarrel and leave them (the Indians) to defend  it.\" However, Johnson counted on being able to change their minds, for  he added: \"I hope in my next to inform you of giving the rebels an  eternal thrashing.\"    The usual British good sense--the national tradesman's instinct--seems  to have been temporarily suspended, held in abeyance, at the demands of  these Indians. In his report of May 12, '78, Col. Bolton writes that he  has approved bills for nearly L18,000 \"for sundries furnished savages  which Maj. Butler thought absolutely necessary, notwithstanding all the  presents sent to their posts last year; 2,700 being assembled at a time  when I little expected such a number, obliged me to send to Detroit for  a supply of provisions, and to buy up all the cattle, etc., that could  possibly be procured, otherwise this garrison must have been distressed  or the savages offended, and of course, I suppose, would have joined the  rebels. Even after all that was done for them they scarce seemed  satisfied.\" In June he writes that only eight out of twenty puncheons of  rum ordered for Fort Niagara had been received, and that \"much wine has  been given to the savages that was intended for this post.\"    One reads in this old correspondence, with mingled amusement and  amazement, of the marvelous attentions paid these wily savages.  Childlike, whatever they saw in the cargoes of the merchants, they  wanted, and England humored and pampered them, lest they transfer their  affections. We have Guy Johnson's word for it, under date of Niagara,  July 3, 1780, that \"many of the Indians will no longer wear tinsel lace,  and are become good judges of gold and silver. They frequently demand  and have received wine, tea, coffee, candles and many such articles, and  they are frequently nice in the choice of the finest black and other  cloth for blankets, and the best linnen and cambrick with other things  needless to enumerate.... The Six Nations are not so fond of gaudy  colors as of good and substantial things, but they are passionately fond  of silver ornaments and neat arrows.\" Elsewhere in these letters a  requisition for port wine is explained on the ground that it was  demanded by the chiefs when they were sick--dainty treatment, truly, for  stalwart savages whose more accustomed diet was cornmeal and water, and  who could feast, when fortune favored, on the reeking entrails of a dead  horse.    Now and then, it is true, advantages were taken of the Indians in ways  which, presumably, it was thought they would not detect; all, we must  grant, in the interest of economy. One was in the matter of powder. The  Indians were furnished with a grade inferior to the garrison powder.  This was shown by a series of tests made at Fort Niagara by order of  Brig. Gen. Powell--Col. Bolton's successor--on July 10, 1782. We may  suppose it to have been an agreeable summer day, that there was leisure  at the fort to indulge in experiments, and that there were no astute  Indians on hand to be unduly edified by the result. At Gen. Powell's  order an eight-inch mortar was elevated to forty-five degrees, and six  rounds fired, to find out how far one half a pound of powder would throw  a forty-six pound shell. The first trial, with the garrison powder, sent  the shell 239 yards. For rounds two and three Indian Department powder  was used; the fine-glazed kind sent the shell eighty-two yards, the  coarser grain carried it but seventy-nine yards. Once more the garrison  powder was used; the shell flew 243 yards, while a second trial of the  two sorts of Indian Department powder sent it but eighty-four and  seventy-six yards, or about three to one in favor of the white man. With  the garrison powder, a musket and carbine ball went through a two and  one-quarter-inch oak plank, at the distance of fifty yards, and lodged  in one six inches behind it; but with the Indian powder these balls  would not go through the first plank.    This seems like taking a base advantage of the trustful Indian ally,  especially since he was to use his powder against the common foe, the  American rebel; in reality, however, the Indians were wasteful and  irresponsible, and squandered their ammunition on the little birds of  the forest and even in harmless but expensive salvos into the empty air.    Another economy was practiced in the Indian Department: when the stock  ran low the rum was watered. Sometimes the precious contents of the  casks were augmented one third, sometimes even two thirds, with the more  abundant beverage from Niagara River, so that the garrison rum, like  the garrison powder, \"carried\" two or three times as well as did that of  the Indian Department; but whether this had a salutary effect upon the  thirsty recipients is a problem the solution of which lies outside the  range of the exact historian.    Difficult as it was to hold the allegiance of the savage, it was harder  yet--nay, it was impossible--to make him fight according to the rules of  civilized warfare.
