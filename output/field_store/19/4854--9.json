The good-natured founder of the feast, highly amused at the ecstasies  each morsel created in its passage over the palate of the enraptured  _gourmand_, thus encouraged the perseverance of his guest--\"Cut away, my  dear sir, cut away, use no ceremony, I pray: I hope you will pick out  all the best of my cheese. _Don't you think_ that THE RIND _and the_  ROTTEN _will do very well for my wife and family!!_\" There is another  set of terribly _free and easy_ folks, who are \"fond of taking  possession of the throne of domestic comfort,\" and then, with all the  impudence imaginable, simper out to the ousted master of the family,  \"Dear me, I am afraid I have taken your place!\"    _Half the trouble of_ WAITING AT TABLE _may be saved_ by giving each  guest two plates, two knives and forks, two pieces of bread, a spoon, a  wine-glass, and a tumbler, and placing the wines and sauces, and the  MAGAZINE OF TASTE, (No. 462,) &c. as a _dormant_, in the centre of the  table; one neighbour may then help another.    Dinner-tables are seldom sufficiently lighted, or attended. An active  waiter will have enough to do to attend upon half a dozen active eaters.  There should be about half as many candles as there are guests, and  their flame be about eighteen inches above the table. Our foolish  modern pompous candelabras seem intended to illuminate the ceiling,  rather than to give light on the plates, &c.    Wax lights at dinner are much more elegant, and not so troublesome and  so uncertain as lamps, nor so expensive; for to purchase a handsome lamp  will cost you more than will furnish you with wax candles for several  years.      FOOTNOTES:    [38-*] Swilling cold _soda water_ immediately after eating a hearty  dinner, is another very unwholesome custom--take good ginger beer if you  are thirsty, and don't like Sir John Barleycorn's cordial.    [38-+] _Strong peppermint or ginger lozenges_ are an excellent help for  that flatulence with which some aged and dyspeptic people ate afflicted  three or four hours after dinner.    [39-*] _Le Grand Sommelier_, or CHIEF BUTLER, in former times was  expected to be especially accomplished in the art of folding table  linen, so as to lay his napkins in different forms every day: these  transformations are particularly described in ROSE'S Instructions for  the Officers of the Mouth, 1682, p. 111, &c. \"To pleat a napkin in the  form of a cockle-shell double\"--\"in the form of hen and  chickens\"--\"shape of two capons in a pye\"--or \"like a dog with a collar  about his neck\"--and many others equally whimsical.    [43-*] In days of yore \"_Le Grand Ecuyer Tranchant_,\" or the MASTER  CARVER, was the next officer of the mouth in rank to the \"_Maitre  d'Hotel_,\" and the technical terms of his art were as singular as any of  those which ornament \"Grose's Classical Slang Dictionary,\" or \"The  Gipsies' Gibberish:\" the only one of these old phrases now in common use  is, \"cut up the TURKEY:\"--we are no longer desired to \"disfigure a  PEACOCK\"--\"unbrace a DUCK\"--\"unlace a CONEY\"--\"tame a CRAB\"--\"tire an  EGG\"--and \"spoil the HEN,\" &c.--See _Instructions for the Officers of  the Mouth_, by ROSE, 1682.    [43-+] Those in the parlour should recollect the importance of setting a  good example to their friends at the second table. If they cut _bread_,  _meat_, _cheese_, &c. FAIRLY, it will go twice as far as if they hack  and mangle it, as if they had not half so much consideration for those  in the kitchen as a good sportsman has for his dogs.          FRIENDLY ADVICE TO COOKS,[46-*] AND OTHER SERVANTS      On your first coming into a family, lose no time in immediately getting  into the good graces of your fellow-servants, that you may learn from  them the customs of the kitchen, and the various rules and orders of the  house.    Take care to be on good terms with the servant who waits at table; make  use of him as your sentinel, to inform you how your work has pleased in  the parlour: by his report you may be enabled in some measure to rectify  any mistake; but request the favour of an early interview with your  master or mistress: depend as little as possible on second-hand  opinions. Judge of your employers from YOUR OWN observations, and THEIR  behaviour to you, not from any idle reports from the other servants,  who, if your master or mistress inadvertently drop a word in your  praise, will immediately take alarm, and fearing your being more in  favour than themselves, will seldom stick at trifles to prevent it, by  pretending to take a prodigious liking to you, and poisoning your mind  in such a manner as to destroy all your confidence, &c. in your  employers; and if they do not immediately succeed in worrying you away,  will take care you have no comfort while you stay: be most cautious of  those who profess most: not only beware of believing such honey-tongued  folks, but beware as much of betraying your suspicions of them, for that  will set fire to the train at once, and of a doubtful friend make a  determined enemy.    If you are a good cook, and strictly do your duty, you will soon become  a favourite domestic; but never boast of the approbation of your  employers; for, in proportion as they think you rise in their  estimation, you will excite all the tricks, that envy, hatred, malice,  and all uncharitableness can suggest to your fellow-servants; every one  of whom, if less sober, honest, or industrious, or less favoured than  yourself, will be your enemy.    While we warn you against making others your enemies, take care that you  do not yourself become your own and greatest enemy. \"Favourites are  never in greater danger of falling, than when in the greatest favour,\"  which often begets a careless inattention to the commands of their  employers, and insolent overbearance to their equals, a gradual neglect  of duty, and a corresponding forfeiture of that regard which can only be  preserved by the means which created it.        \"Those arts by which at first you gain it,      You still must practise to maintain it.\"    If your employers are so pleased with your conduct as to treat you as a  friend rather than a servant, do not let their kindness excite your  self-conceit, so as to make you for a moment forget you are one.  Condescension, even to a proverb, produces contempt in inconsiderate  minds; and to such, the very means which benevolence takes to cherish  attention to duty, becomes the cause of the evil it is intended to  prevent.    To be an agreeable companion in the kitchen, without compromising your  duty to your patrons in the parlour, requires no small portion of good  sense and good nature: in a word, you must \"do as you would be done by.\"    ACT FOR, AND SPEAK OF, EVERY BODY AS IF THEY WERE PRESENT.    We hope the culinary student who peruses these pages will be above  adopting the common, mean, and ever unsuccessful way of \"holding with  the hare, and running with the hounds,\" of currying favour with  fellow-servants by flattering them, and ridiculing the mistress when in  the kitchen, and then, prancing into the parlour and purring about her,  and making opportunities to display all the little faults you can find  (_or invent_) that will tell well against those in the kitchen; assuring  them, on your return, that they were _vraised_, for whatever you heard  them _blamed_, and so excite them to run more extremely into any little  error which you think will be most displeasing to their employers;  watching an opportunity to pour your poisonous lies into their  unsuspecting ears, when there is no third person to bear witness of your  iniquity; making your victims believe, it is all out of your _sincere  regard_ for them; assuring them (as Betty says in the man of the world,)  \"That indeed you are no busybody that loves fending nor proving, but  hate all tittling and tattling, and gossiping and backbiting,\" &c. &c.    Depend upon it, if you hear your fellow-servants speak disrespectfully  of a master or a mistress with whom they have lived some time, it is a  sure sign that they have some sinister scheme against yourself; if they  have not been well treated, why have they stayed?    \"There is nothing more detestable than defamation. I have no scruple to  rank a slanderer with a murderer or an assassin. Those who assault the  reputation of their benefactors, and 'rob you of that which nought  enriches them,' would destroy your life, if they could do it with equal  impunity.\"    \"If you hope to gain the respect and esteem of others, and the  approbation of your own heart, be respectful and faithful to your  superiors, obliging and good-natured to your fellow-servants, and  charitable to all.\" You cannot be too careful to cultivate a meek and  gentle disposition; you will find the benefit of it every day of your  life: to promote peace and harmony around you, will not only render you  a general favourite with your fellow-servants, but will make you happy  in yourself.    \"Let your _character_ be remarkable for industry and moderation; your  _manners_ and deportment, for modesty and humility; your _dress_  distinguished for simplicity, frugality, and neatness. A dressy servant  is a disgrace to a house, and renders her employers as ridiculous as she  does herself. If you outshine your companions in finery, you will  inevitably excite their envy, and make them your enemies.\"      \"Do every thing at the proper time.\"    \"Keep every thing in its proper place.\"    \"Use every thing for its proper purpose.\"    The importance of these three rules"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28693"],[0,"Tales of the Fish Patrol (#12)"],[1," evenly over the river as far as we could see. A  narrow space on the right-hand side of the channel was left clear for  steam-boats, but the rest of the river was covered with the  wide-stretching nets. The narrow space was our logical course, but  Charley, at the wheel, steered the _Mary Rebecca_ straight for the  nets.    This did not cause any alarm among the fishermen, because up-river  sailing craft are always provided with \"shoes\" on the ends of their  keels, which permit them to slip over the nets without fouling them.    \"Now she takes it!\" Charley cried, as we dashed across the middle of a  line of floats which marked a net. At one end of this line was a small  barrel buoy, at the other the two fishermen in their boat. Buoy and  boat at once began to draw together, and the fishermen to cry out, as  they were jerked after us. A couple of minutes later we hooked a  second net, and then a third, and in this fashion we tore straight up  through the centre of the fleet.    The consternation we spread among the fishermen was tremendous. As  fast as we hooked a net the two ends of it, buoy and boat, came  together as they dragged out astern; and so many buoys and boats,  coming together at such breakneck speed, kept the fishermen on the  jump to avoid smashing into one another. Also, they shouted at us like  mad to heave to into the wind, for they took it as some drunken prank  on the part of scow-sailors, little dreaming that we were the fish  patrol.    The drag of a single net is very heavy, and Charley and Ole Ericsen  decided that even in such a wind ten nets were all the _Mary Rebecca_  could take along with her. So when we had hooked ten nets, with ten  boats containing twenty men streaming along behind us, we veered to  the left out of the fleet and headed toward Collinsville.    We were all jubilant. Charley was handling the wheel as though he were  steering the winning yacht home in a race. The two sailors who made up  the crew of the _Mary Rebecca_, were grinning and joking. Ole  Ericsen was rubbing his huge hands in child-like glee.    [Illustration: \"The consternation we spread among the fishermen was  tremendous.\"]    \"Ay tank you fish patrol fallers never ban so lucky as when you sail  with Ole Ericsen,\" he was saying, when a rifle cracked sharply astern,  and a bullet gouged along the newly painted cabin, glanced on a nail,  and sang shrilly onward into space.    This was too much for Ole Ericsen. At sight of his beloved paintwork  thus defaced, he jumped up and shook his fist at the fishermen; but a  second bullet smashed into the cabin not six inches from his head, and  he dropped down to the deck under cover of the rail.    All the fishermen had rifles, and they now opened a general fusillade.  We were all driven to cover--even Charley, who was compelled to desert  the wheel. Had it not been for the heavy drag of the nets, we would  inevitably have broached to at the mercy of the enraged fishermen. But  the nets, fastened to the bottom of the _Mary Rebecca_ well aft, held  her stern into the wind, and she continued to plough on, though  somewhat erratically.    Charley, lying on the deck, could just manage to reach the lower  spokes of the wheel; but while he could steer after a fashion, it was  very awkward. Ole Ericsen bethought himself of a large piece of sheet  steel in the empty hold. It was in fact a plate from the side of the  _New Jersey_, a steamer which had recently been wrecked outside the  Golden Gate, and in the salving of which the _Mary Rebecca_ had taken  part.    Crawling carefully along the deck, the two sailors, Ole, and myself  got the heavy plate on deck and aft, where we reared it as a shield  between the wheel and the fishermen. The bullets whanged and banged  against it till it rang like a bull's-eye, but Charley grinned in its  shelter, and coolly went on steering.    So we raced along, behind us a howling, screaming bedlam of wrathful  Greeks, Collinsville ahead, and bullets spat-spatting all around us.    \"Ole,\" Charley said in a faint voice, \"I don't know what we're going  to do.\"    Ole Ericsen, lying on his back close to the rail and grinning upward  at the sky, turned over on his side and looked at him. \"Ay tank we go  into Collinsville yust der same,\" he said.    \"But we can't stop,\" Charley groaned. \"I never thought of it, but we  can't stop.\"    A look of consternation slowly overspread Ole Ericsen's broad face. It  was only too true. We had a hornet's nest on our hands, and to stop  at Collinsville would be to have it about our ears.    \"Every man Jack of them has a gun,\" one of the sailors remarked  cheerfully.    \"Yes, and a knife, too,\" the other sailor added.    It was Ole Ericsen's turn to groan. \"What for a Svaidish faller like  me monkey with none of my biziness, I don't know,\" he soliloquized.    A bullet glanced on the stern and sang off to starboard like a  spiteful bee. \"There's nothing to do but plump the _Mary Rebecca_  ashore and run for it,\" was the verdict of the first cheerful sailor.    \"And leaf der _Mary Rebecca_?\" Ole demanded, with unspeakable horror  in his voice.    \"Not unless you want to,\" was the response. \"But I don't want to be  within a thousand miles of her when those fellers come  aboard\"--indicating the bedlam of excited Greeks towing behind.    We were right in at Collinsville then, and went foaming by within  biscuit-toss of the wharf.    \"I only hope the wind holds out,\" Charley said, stealing a glance at  our prisoners.    \"What of der wind?\" Ole demanded disconsolately. \"Der river will not  hold out, and then...and then...\"    \"It's head for tall timber, and the Greeks take the hindermost,\"  adjudged the cheerful sailor, while Ole was stuttering over what would  happen when we came to the end of the river.    We had now reached a dividing of the ways. To the left was the mouth  of the Sacramento River, to the right the mouth of the San Joaquin.  The cheerful sailor crept forward and jibed over the foresail as  Charley put the helm to starboard and we swerved to the right into  the San Joaquin. The wind, from which we had been running away on an  even keel, now caught us on our beam, and the _Mary Rebecca_ was  pressed down on her port side as if she were about to capsize.    Still we dashed on, and still the fishermen dashed on behind. The  value of their nets was greater than the fines they would have to pay  for violating the fish laws; so to cast off from their nets and  escape, which they could easily do, would profit them nothing.  Further, they remained by their nets instinctively, as a sailor  remains by his ship. And still further, the desire for vengeance was  roused, and we could depend upon it that they would follow us to the  ends of the earth, if we undertook to tow them that far.    The rifle-firing had ceased, and we looked astern to see what our  prisoners were doing. The boats were strung along at unequal  distances apart, and we saw the four nearest ones bunching together.  This was done by the boat ahead trailing a small rope astern to the  one behind. When this was caught, they would cast off from their net  and heave in on the line till they were brought up to the boat in  front. So great was the speed at which we were travelling, however,  that this was very slow work. Sometimes the men would strain to their  utmost and fail to get in an inch of the rope; at other times they  came ahead more rapidly.    When the four boats were near enough together for a man to pass from  one to another, one Greek from each of three got into the nearest boat  to us, taking his rifle with him. This made five in the foremost boat,  and it was plain that their intention was to board us. This they  undertook to do, by main strength and sweat, running hand over hand  the float-line of a net. And though it was slow, and they stopped  frequently to rest, they gradually drew nearer.    Charley smiled at their efforts, and said, \"Give her the topsail,  Ole.\"    The cap at the mainmast head was broken out, and sheet and downhaul  pulled flat, amid a scattering rifle fire from the boats; and the  _Mary Rebecca_ lay over and sprang ahead faster than ever.    But the Greeks were undaunted. Unable, at the increased speed, to draw  themselves nearer by means of their hands, they rigged from the blocks  of their boat sail what sailors call a \"watch-tackle.\" One of them,  held by the legs by his mates, would lean far over the bow and make  the tackle fast to the float-line. Then they would heave in on the  tackle till the blocks were together, when the manoeuvre would be  repeated.    \"Have to give her the staysail,\" Charley said.    Ole Ericsen looked at the straining _Mary Rebecca_ and shook his head.  \"It will take der masts out of her,\" he said.    \"And we'll be taken out of her if you don't,\" Charley replied.    Ole shot an anxious glance at his masts, another at the boat load of  armed Greeks, and consented.    The five men were in the bow of the boat--a bad place when a craft is  towing. I was watching the behavior of their boat as the great  fisherman's staysail, far, far larger than the topsail and used only  in light breezes, was broken out. As the _Mary Rebecca_ lurched  forward with a tremendous jerk, the nose of the boat ducked down into  the water, and the men tumbled over one another in a wild rush into  the stern to save the boat from being dragged sheer under water.    \"That settles them!\" Charley remarked, though he was anxiously  studying the behavior of the _Mary Rebecca_, which was being driven  under far more canvas than she was rightly able to carry.    \"Next stop is Antioch!\" announced the cheerful sailor, after the  manner of a railway conductor. \"And next comes Merryweather!\"    \"Come here, quick,\" Charley said to me.    I crawled across the deck and stood upright beside him in the shelter  of the sheet steel.    \"Feel in my inside pocket,\" he commanded, \"and get my notebook. That's  right. Tear out a "]]]
