One of the parties  must either support the new issue or give place to a party which would  do so.    A political party for the defense of liberty was the fulfillment of the  aspirations of all earnest anti-slavery men and of all abolitionists  not of the radical Garrisonian persuasion. The national anti-slavery  societies were for the most part limited in their operations to the  Atlantic seaboard. The West organized local and state associations  with little reference to the national association. When the disruption  occurred between Garrison and his opponents in 1840, the Western  abolitionists continued their former methods of local organization. They  recognized no divisions in their ranks and continued to work in  harmony with all who in any way opposed the institution of slavery. The  political party was their first really effective national organization.  Through party committees, caucuses, and conventions, they became a part  of the forces that controlled the nation. The older local clubs and  associations were either displaced by the party or became mere adjuncts  to the party.    The lines for political action were now clearly defined. In the  States emancipation should be accomplished by state action. With a few  individual exceptions the leaders conceded that Congress had no power  to abolish slavery in the States. Upon the general Government they urged  the duty of abolishing both slavery and the slave-trade in the District  of Columbia and in all areas under direct federal control. They further  urged upon the Government the strict enforcement of the laws prohibiting  the foreign slave-trade and the enactment of laws forbidding the  interstate slave-trade. The constitutionality of these main lines of  action has been generally conceded.    Abolitionists were pioneers in the formulation of political platforms.  The declaration of principles drawn up by Garrison in 1833 and adopted  by the American Anti-Slavery Society was of the nature of a political  platform. The duty of voting in furtherance of the policy of  emancipation was inculcated. No platform was adopted for the first  political campaign, that of 1840; but four years later there was an  elaborate party platform of twenty-one resolutions. Many things had  happened in the eleven years intervening since the declaration of  principles of the American Anti-Slavery Society. In the earlier platform  the freedom of the slave appears as the primary object. That of the  Liberty party assumes the broad principle of human brotherhood as the  foundation for a democracy or a republic. It denies that the party is  organized merely to free the slave. Slaveholding as the grossest form of  despotism must indeed be attacked first, but the aim of the party is to  carry the principle of equal rights into all social relations. It is not  a sectional party nor a party organized for a single purpose. \"It is not  a new party, nor a third party, but it is the party of 1776, reviving  the principles of that memorable era, and striving to carry them into  practical application.\" The spirit of '76 rings, indeed, throughout  the document, which declares that it was understood at the time of the  Declaration and the Constitution that the existence of slavery was in  derogation of the principles of American liberty. The implied faith  of the Nation and the States was pledged to remove this stain upon the  national character. Some States had nobly fulfilled that pledge; others  shamelessly had neglected to do so.    These principles are reasserted in succeeding platforms. The later  opponents of slavery in their principles and policies thus allied  themselves with the founders of the republic. They claimed the right to  continue to repeat the words of Washington and Jefferson and those of  the members of the Virginia Legislature of 1832. No new doctrines were  required. It was enough simply to reaffirm the fundamental principles of  democracy.    The names attached to the party are significant. It was at first  popularly styled the Abolition party, then officially in turn the  Liberty party, the Freesoil party, and finally the Republican party.  Republican was the name first applied to the Democratic party--the party  of Jefferson. The term Democrat was gradually substituted under the  leadership of Jackson before 1830. Some of the men who participated  in the organization of the later Republican party had themselves been  Republicans in the party of Jefferson. They not only accepted the name  which Jefferson gave to his party, but they adopted the principles which  Jefferson proclaimed on the subject of slavery, free soil, and human  rights in general. This was the final stage in the identification of the  later anti-slavery crusade with the earlier contest for liberty.        CHAPTER VII. THE PASSING OF THE WHIG PARTY    The middle of the last century was marked by many incidents which have  left a permanent impress upon politics in general and upon the slavery  question in particular. Europe was again in the throes of popular  uprisings. New constitutions were adopted in France, Switzerland,  Prussia, and Austria. Reactions in favor of autocracy in Austria and  Germany sent multitudes of lovers of liberty to America. Kossuth, the  Hungarian revolutionist, electrified American audiences by his appeals  on behalf of the downtrodden in Europe. Already the world was growing  smaller. America did not stop at the Pacific but crossed the ocean to  establish permanent political and commercial relations with Japan and  China.    The industries of the country were being reorganized to meet new  conditions created by recent inventions. The electric telegraph was  just coming into use, giving rise to a new era in communication. The  discovery of gold in California in 1848 was followed by competing  projects to construct railroads to the Pacific with Chicago and St.  Louis as the rival eastern terminals. The telegraph, the railway,  and the resulting industrial development proved great nationalizing  influences. They served also to give increased emphasis to the contrast  between the industries of the free and those of the slave States. The  Census of 1850 became an effective anti-slavery argument.    The telegraph also gave new life to the public press. The presidential  campaign of 1848 was the last one in which it was possible to carry on  contradictory arguments in support of the same candidate. If slavery  could not endure the test of untrammeled discussion when there were no  means of rapid intercommunication such as the telegraph supplied, how  could it contend against the revelations of the daily press with the new  type of reporter and interviewer which was now developed?    It is a remarkable coincidence that in the midst of the passing of the  old and the coming in of the new order there should be a change in the  political leadership of the country. Webster, Clay, Calhoun, John Quincy  Adams, not to mention others, all died near the middle of the century,  and their political power passed to younger men. Adams gave his blessing  to a young friend and co-laborer, William H. Seward of New York,  intimating that he expected him to do much to curb the threatening power  of the slaveholding oligarchy; while Andrew Jackson, who died earlier,  had already conferred a like distinction upon young Stephen A. Douglas.  There was no lack of aspirants for the fallen mantles.    John C. Calhoun continued almost to the day of his death to modify his  interpretation of the Constitution in the interest of his section. As  a young man he avowed protectionist principles. Becoming convinced that  slave labor was not suited to manufacture, he urged South Carolina to  declare the protective tariff laws null and void within her limits.  When his section seemed endangered by the distribution of anti-slavery  literature through the mail, he extemporized a theory that each State  had a right to pass statutes to protect itself in such an emergency, in  which case it became the duty of the general Government and of all other  States to respect such laws. When it finally appeared that the territory  acquired from Mexico was likely to remain free, the same statesman made  further discoveries. He found that Congress had no right to exclude  slavery from any Territory belonging to the United States; that the  owners of slaves had equal rights with the owners of other property;  that neither Congress nor a territorial authority had any power  to exclude slaves from a Territory. This doctrine was accepted by  extremists in the South and was finally embodied in the Dred Scott  decision of 1857.    Abolitionists had meantime evolved a precisely contradictory theory.  They asserted that the Constitution gave no warrant for property in man,  except as held under state laws; that with this exception freedom was  guaranteed to all; that Congress had no more right to make a slave than  it had to make a king; and that it was the duty of Congress to maintain  freedom in all the Territories. Extremists expressed the view that all  past acts whereby slavery had been extended were unconstitutional  and therefore void. Between these extreme conflicting views was every  imaginable grade of opinion. The prevailing view of opponents of  slavery, however, was in harmony with their past conduct and maintained  that Congress had complete control over slavery in the Territories.    When the Mexican territory was acquired, Stephen A. Douglas, as the  experienced chairman of the Committee on Territories in the Senate, was  already developing a theory respecting slavery in the Territories  which was destined to play a leading part in the later crusade against  slavery. Douglas was the most thoroughgoing of expansionists and would  acknowledge no northern boundary on this side of the North Pole, no  southern boundary nearer than Panama.

The following, one of the latest productions of the poet Moore,  addressed to the Marquis of Lansdowne, shows that though by that time  inclining to threescore and ten, he retained all the fire and vivacity  of early youth. It is full of those exquisitely apt allusions and  felicitous turns of expression in which the English Anacreon excels. It  breathes the very spirit of classic festivity. Such an invitation to  dinner is enough to create an appetite in any lover of poetry:--     \"Some think we bards have nothing real--       That poets live among the stars, so    Their very dinners are ideal,--       (And heaven knows, too oft they are so:)    For instance, that we have, instead       Of vulgar chops and stews, and hashes,    First course,--a phoenix at the head,       Done in its own celestial ashes:    At foot, a cygnet, which kept singing       All the time its neck was wringing.    Side dishes, thus,--Minerva's owl,       Or any such like learned fowl;    Doves, such as heaven's poulterer gets       When Cupid shoots his mother's pets.    Larks stew'd in morning's roseate breath,       Or roasted by a sunbeam's splendour;    And nightingales, be-rhymed to death--       Like young pigs whipp'd to make them tender    Such fare may suit those bards who're able    To banquet at Duke Humphrey's table;    But as for me, who've long been taught       To eat and drink like other people,    And can put up with mutton, bought       Where Bromham rears its ancient steeple;    If Lansdowne will consent to share    My humble feast, though rude the fare    Yet, seasoned by that salt he brings     From Attica's salinest springs,    'Twill turn to dainties; while the cup,    Beneath his influence brightening up,    Like that of Baucis, touched by Jove,         Will sparkle fit for gods above!\"           *       *       *       *       *      THE POETS IN A PUZZLE.    Cottle, in his Life of Coleridge, relates the following amusing  incident:--    \"I led the horse to the stable, when a fresh perplexity arose. I removed  the harness without difficulty; but, after many strenuous attempts, I  could not remove the collar. In despair, I called for assistance, when  aid soon drew near. Mr. Wordsworth brought his ingenuity into exercise;  but, after several unsuccessful efforts, he relinquished the achievement,  as a thing altogether impracticable. Mr. Coleridge now tried his hand,  but showed no more grooming skill than his predecessors; for, after  twisting the poor horse's neck almost to strangulation and the great  danger of his eyes, he gave up the useless task, pronouncing that the  horse's head must have grown (gout or dropsy?) since the collar was put  on; for he said 'it was a downright impossibility for such a huge _os  frontis_ to pass through so narrow a collar!' Just at this instant, a  servant-girl came near, and, understanding the cause of our consternation,  'La! master,' said she, 'you don't go about the work in the right way.  You should do like this,' when, turning the collar completely upside  down, she slipped it off in a moment, to our great humiliation and  wonderment, each satisfied afresh that there were heights of knowledge  in the world to which we had not yet attained.\"           *       *       *       *       *      SALE OF MAGAZINES.    Sir John Hawkins, in his \"Memoirs of Johnson,\" ascribes the decline of  literature to the ascendancy of frivolous Magazines, between the years  1740 and 1760. He says that they render smatterers conceited, and confer  the superficial glitter of knowledge instead of its substance.    Sir Richard Phillips, upwards of forty years a publisher, gives the  following evidence as to the sale of the Magazines in his time:--    \"For my own part, I know that in 1790, and for many years previously,  there were sold of the trifle called the _Town and Country Magazine_,  full 15,000 copies per month; and, of another, the _Ladies' Magazine_,  from 16,000 to 22,000. Such circumstances were, therefore, calculated to  draw forth the observations of Hawkins. _The Gentleman's Magazine_, in  its days of popular extracts, never rose above 10,000; after it became  more decidedly antiquarian, it fell in sale, and continued for many  years at 3000.    \"The veriest trifles, and only such, move the mass of minds which  compose the public. The sale of the _Town and Country Magazine_ was  created by a fictitious article, called _Bon-Ton_, in which were given  the pretended amours of two personages, imagined to be real, with two  sham portraits. The idea was conceived, and, for above twenty years,  was executed by Count Carraccioli; but, on his death, about 1792,  the article lost its spirit, and within seven years the magazine was  discontinued. The _Ladies' Magazine_ was, in like manner, sustained by  love-tales and its low price of sixpence, which, till after 1790, was  the general price of magazines.\"    Things have now taken a turn unlooked for in those days. The price of  most magazines, it is true, is still more than sixpence--usually a  shilling, and at that price the _Cornhill_ in some months reached an  impression of 120,000; but the circulation of _Good Words_, at sixpence,  has touched 180,000, and continues, we believe, to be over 100,000.           *       *       *       *       *      MRS. SOUTHEY.    And who was Mrs. Southey?--who but she who was so long known, and so  great a favourite, as Caroline Bowles; transformed by the gallantry of  the laureate, and the grace of the parson, into her matrimonial  appellation. Southey, so long ago as the 21st of February, 1829,  prefaced his most amatory poem of _All for Love_, with a tender address,  that is now, perhaps, worth reprinting:--     \"TO CAROLINE BOWLES.     \"Could I look forward to a distant day,    With hope of building some elaborate lay,    Then would I wait till worthier strains of mine,    Might have inscribed thy name, O Caroline!    For I would, while my voice is heard on earth,    Bear witness to thy genius and thy worth.    But we have been both taught to feel with fear,    How frail the tenure of existence here;    What unforeseen calamities prevent,    Alas! how oft, the best resolved intent;    And, therefore, this poor volume I address    To thee, dear friend, and sister poetess!     \"_Keswick, Feb. 21, 1829._     \"ROBERT SOUTHEY.\"    The laureate had his wish; for in duty, he was bound to say, that  worthier strains than his bore inscribed the name of Caroline connected  with his own--and, moreover, she was something more than a dear friend  and sister poetess.    \"The laureate,\" observes a writer in _Fraser's Magazine_, \"is a  fortunate man; his queen supplies him with _butts_ (alluding to the  laureateship), and his lady with Bowls: then may his cup of good fortune  be overflowing.\"           *       *       *       *       *      DEVOTION TO SCIENCE.    M. Agassiz, the celebrated palaeontologist, is known to have relinquished  pursuits from which he might have been in the receipt of a considerable  income, and all for the sake of science. Dr. Buckland knew him, when  engaged in this arduous career, with the revenue of only 100_l._: and  of this he paid fifty pounds to artists for drawings, thirty pounds for  books, and lived himself on the remaining twenty pounds a year! Thus did  he raise himself to an elevated European rank; and, in his abode, _au  troisieme_, was the companion and friend of princes, ambassadors, and  men of the highest rank and talent of every country.           *       *       *       *       *      DISADVANTAGEOUS CORRECTION.    Lord North had little reason to congratulate himself when he ventured  on an interruption with Burke. In a debate on some economical question,  Burke was guilty of a false quantity--\"_Magnum vect[)i]gal est  parsimonia._\" \"_Vect[=i]gal_,\" said the minister, in an audible  under-tone. \"I thank the noble lord for his correction,\" resumed the  orator, \"since it gives me the opportunity of repeating the inestimable  adage--\"_Magnum vect[=i]gal est parsimonia._\" (Parsimony is a great  revenue.)           *       *       *       *       *      PATRONAGE OF LITERATURE.    When Victor Hugo was an aspirant for the honours of the French Academy,  and called on M. Royer Collard to ask his vote, the sturdy veteran  professed entire ignorance of his name. \"I am the author of _Notre Dame  de Paris_, _Les Derniers Jours d'un Condamne_, _Bug-Jargal_, _Marian  Delorme_, &c.\" \"I never heard of any of them,\" said Collard. \"Will you  do me the honour of accepting a copy of my works?\" said Victor Hugo. \"I  never read new books,\" was the cutting reply.           *       *       *       *       *      DR. JOHNSON'S WIGS.    Dr. Johnson's wigs were in general very shabby, and their fore-parts  were burned away by the near approach of the candle, which his  short-sightedness rendered necessary in reading. At Streatham, Mr.  Thrale's butler always had a wig ready; and as Johnson passed from the  drawing-room, when dinner was announced, the servant would remove the  ordinary wig, and replace it with the newer one; and this ludicrous  ceremony was performed every day.--_Croker._           *       *       *       *       *      SHERIDAN'S \"PIZARRO.\"    Mr. Pitt was accustomed to relate very pleasantly an amusing anecdote  of a total breach of memory in some Mrs. Lloyd, a lady, or nominal  housekeeper, of Kensington Palace. \"Being in company,\" he said, \"with  Mr. Sheridan, without recollecting him, while _Pizarro_ was the topic of  discussion, she said to him, 'And so this fine _Pizarro_ is printed?'  'Yes, so I hear,' said Sherry. 'And did you ever in your life read such  stuff?' cried she. 'Why I believe it's bad enough,' quoth Sherry; 'but  at least, madam, you must allow it's very loyal.' 'Ah!' cried she,  shaking her head--'loyal? you don't know its author as well as I do.'\"           *       *       *       *       *      DR. JOHNSON IN LONDON.    The following were Dr."]]]
