[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3410"],[0,"The American Spirit in Literature: A Chronicle of Great Interpreters (#12)"],[1,"to break the last threads of our  friendship for France, and suspicion of the Holy Alliance led to an era  of national self-assertion of which the Monroe Doctrine was only one  expression. The raw Jacksonism of the West seemed to be gaining upon  the older civilizations represented by Virginia and Massachusetts. The  self-made type of man began to pose as the genuine American. And at this  moment came forward a man of natural lucidity and serenity of mind, of  perfect poise and good temper, who knew both Europe and America and felt  that they ought to know one another better and to like one another more.  That was Irving's service as an international mediator. He diffused  sweetness and light in an era marked by bitterness and obscuration. It  was a triumph of character as well as of literary skill.    But the skill was very noticeable also. Irving's prose is not that of  the Defoe-Swift-Franklin-Paine type of plain talk to the crowd. It is  rather an inheritance from that other eighteenth century tradition, the  conversation of the select circle. Its accents were heard in Steele and  Addison and were continued in Goldsmith, Sterne, Cowper, and Charles  Lamb. Among Irving's successors, George William Curtis and Charles  Dudley Warner and William Dean Howells have been masters of it likewise.  It is mellow human talk, delicate, regardful, capable of exquisite  modulation. With instinctive artistic taste, Irving used this old and  sound style upon fresh American material. In \"Rip van Winkle\" and \"The  Legend of Sleepy Hollow\" he portrayed his native valley of the Hudson,  and for a hundred years connoisseurs of style have perceived the  exquisite fitness of the language to the images and ideas which Irving  desired to convey. To render the Far West of that epoch this style is  perhaps not \"big\" and broad enough, but when used as Irving uses it in  describing Stratford and Westminster Abbey and an Old English Christmas,  it becomes again a perfect medium. Hawthorne adopted it for \"Our Old  Home,\" and Englishmen recognized it at once as a part of their own  inheritance, enriched, like certain wines, by the voyage across the  Atlantic and home again. Irving wrote of England, Mr. Warner once said,  as Englishmen would have liked to write about it. When he described  the Alhambra and Granada and the Moors, it was the style, rich both in  physical sensation and in dreamlike reverie, which revealed to the world  the quick American appreciation of foreign scenes and characters. Its  key is sympathy.    Irving's popularity has endured in England. It suffered during the  middle of the century in his own country, for the strongest New England  authors taught the public to demand more thought and passion than were  in Irving's nature. Possibly the nervous, journalistic style of the  twentieth century allows too scanty leisure of mind for the full  enjoyment of the Knickerbocker flavor. Yet such changes as these in  literary fashion scarcely affect the permanent service of Irving to our  literature. He immortalized a local type--the New York Dutchman--and  local legends, like that of Rip van Winkle; he used the framework of  the narrative essay to create something almost like the perfected short  story of Poe and Hawthorne; he wrote prose with unfailing charm in an  age when charm was lacking; and, if he had no message, it should be  remembered that some of the most useful ambassadors have had none save  to reveal, with delicacy and tact and humorous kindness, the truth that  foreign persons have feelings precisely like our own.    Readers of Sir Walter Scott's \"Journal\" may remember his account of an  evening party in Paris in 1826 where he met Fenimore Cooper, then in  the height of his European reputation. \"So the Scotch and American lions  took the field together,\" wrote Sir Walter, who loved to be generous.  \"The Last of the Mohicans,\" then just published, threatened to eclipse  the fame of \"Ivanhoe.\" Cooper, born in 1789, was eighteen years younger  than the Wizard of the North, and was more deeply indebted to him than  he knew. For it was Scott who had created the immense nineteenth century  audience for prose fiction, and who had evolved a kind of formula for  the novel, ready for Cooper's use. Both men were natural story-tellers.  Scott had the richer mind and the more fully developed historical  imagination. Both were out-of-doors men, lovers of manly adventure and  of natural beauty. But the American had the good fortune to be able to  utilize in his books his personal experiences of forest and sea and to  reveal to Europe the real romance of the American wilderness.    That Cooper was the first to perceive the artistic possibilities of  this romance, no one would claim. Brockden Brown, a Quaker youth of  Philadelphia, a disciple of the English Godwin, had tried his hand at  the very end of the eighteenth century upon American variations of the  Gothic romance then popular in England. Brown had a keen eye for the  values of the American landscape and even of the American Indian. He had  a knack for passages of ghastly power, as his descriptions of maniacs,  murderers, sleep-walkers, and solitaries abundantly prove. But he had  read too much and lived too little to rival the masters of the art of  fiction. And there was a traveled Frenchman, Chateaubriand, surely an  expert in the art of eloquent prose, who had transferred to the pages  of his American Indian stories, \"Atala\" and \"Rene,\" the mystery and  enchantment of our dark forests and endless rivers. But Chateaubriand,  like Brockden Brown, is feverish. A taint of old-world eroticism and  despair hovers like a miasma over his magnificent panorama of the  wilderness. Cooper, like Scott, is masculine.    He was a Knickerbocker only by adoption. Born in New Jersey, his  childhood was spent in the then remote settlement of Cooperstown in  Central New York. He had a little schooling at Albany, and a brief and  inglorious career at Yale with the class of 1806. He went to sea for two  years, and then served for three years in the United States Navy upon  Lakes Ontario and Champlain, the very scene of some of his best stories.  In 1811 he married, resigned from the Navy, and settled upon a little  estate in Westchester County, near New York. Until the age of thirty, he  was not in the least a bookman, but a healthy, man of action. Then, as  the well-known anecdote goes, he exclaims to his wife, after reading a  stupid English novel, \"I believe I could write a better story myself.\"  \"Precaution\" (1820) was the result, but whether it was better than the  unknown English book, no one can now say. It was bad enough. Yet the  next year Cooper published \"The Spy,\" one of the finest of his novels,  which was instantly welcomed in England and translated in France. Then  came, in swift succession, \"The Pioneers,\" the first Leather-Stocking  tale in order of composition, and \"The Pilot,\" to show that Scott's  \"Pirate\" was written by a landsman! \"Lionel Lincoln\" and \"The Last  of the Mohicans\" followed. The next seven years were spent in Europe,  mainly in France, where \"The Prairie\" and \"The Red Rover\" were written.  Cooper now looked back upon his countrymen with eyes of critical  detachment, and made ready to tell them some of their faults. He came  home to Cooperstown in 1833, the year after Irving's return to America.  He had won, deservedly, a great fame, which he proceeded to imperil by  his combativeness with his neighbors and his harsh strictures upon the  national character, due mainly to his lofty conception of the ideal  America. He continued to spin yarns of sea and shore, and to write naval  history. The tide of fashion set against him in the eighteen-forties  when Bulwer and Dickens rode into favor, but the stouthearted old  pioneer could afford to bide his time. He died in 1851, just as Mrs.  Stowe was writing \"Uncle Tom's Cabin.\"    Two generations have passed since then, and Cooper's place in our  literature remains secure. To have written our first historical novel,  \"The Spy,\" our first sea-story, \"The Pilot,\" and to have created the  Leather-Stocking series, is glory enough. In his perception of masculine  character, Cooper ranks with Fielding. His sailors, his scouts and  spies, his good and bad Indians, are as veritable human figures  as Squire Western. Long Tom Coffin, Harvey Birch, Hawk-Eye, and  Chingachgook are physically and morally true to life itself. Read the  Leather-Stocking books in the order of the events described,  beginning with \"The Deerslayer,\" then \"The Last of the Mohicans,\" \"The  Pathfinder,\" \"The Pioneers\", and ending with the vast darkening horizon  of \"The Prairie\" and the death of the trapper, and one will feel  how natural and inevitable are the fates of the personages and the  alterations in the life of the frontier. These books vary in their  poetic quality and in the degree of their realism, but to watch the  evolution of the leading figure is to see human life in its actual  texture.    Clever persons and pedantic persons have united to find fault with  certain elements of Cooper's art. Mark Twain, in one of his least  inspired moments, selected Cooper's novels for attack. Every grammar  school teacher is ready to point out that his style is often prolix  and his sentences are sometimes ungrammatical. Amateurs even criticize  Cooper's seamanship, although it seemed impeccable to Admiral Mahan. No  doubt one must admit the \"helplessness, propriety, and incapacity\" of  most of Cooper's women, and the dreadfulness of his bores, particularly  the Scotchmen, the doctors, and the naturalists. Like Sir Walter, Cooper  seems to have taken but little pains in the deliberate planning of his  plots. Frequently he accepts a ready-made formula of villain and hero,  predicament and escape, renewed crisis and rescue, mystification and  explanation, worthy of a third-rate novelist. His salvation lies in  his genius for action, the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34110"],[0,"Deadfalls and Snares (#12)"],[1,"through the snare he only  needs to give a slight pull to open the slip knot and release the  spring pole.    To prevent the rabbits from biting a cord snare, rub it well with the  dropping of the lynx or fox and also, never use any green wood other  than spruce or balsam, as any fresh green wood is sure to attract the  rabbits. You may also put a small piece of beaver castor along the  trail on each side of the snare, and you will be more sure of the  lynx, as beaver castor is very attractive to these big cats.      * * *    We will now proceed to make another spring pole snare, altho the one  described before is more practical, says a Colorado trapper. It is  made like the preceding one except the trigger, etc. This one is to  be used on a runway without any bait whatever. The illustration shows  the trigger as it appears in the runway. No. 1 is the trip stick; No.  2, the stay crotch; No. 3, the trigger; No. 4, the loop; No. 5, the  pathway, and No. G, the stay wire.      [Illustration: PATH SNARE.]    The animal in coming on down the path (5) passes its body or neck  thru the loop made of stout soft insulated wire (4); in passing it  steps on the trip stick (1) which settles with the animal's weight,  releasing the trigger (3) which in turn releases the stay wire (6)  and jerks the loop (4) around the animal; the spring pole onto which  the stay-wire it attached lifts your game up into the air, choking it  to death and placing it out of reach of other animals that would  otherwise destroy your fur. A small notch cut in the stay crotch  where the end of the trip stick rests will insure the trigger to be  released. This will hold the trip stick firm at the end, making it  move only at the end where the animal steps.        CHAPTER XVII.    BAIT SET SNARE.    This snare I consider good for such animals as will take bait. (See  page 141.)    No. 1 and 2, headless wire nails driven horizontally into tree about  ten inches from ground.    No. 3, a No. 10 or 12 wire nail with head used to catch under No. 1  and 2.    No. 4, bait stick or trigger. No. 3 passes through No. 4.    No. 5, bait, frog tied to bottom of No. 4.    No. 6's snare, fastened to No. 3 by two half hitches, then fastened  to No. 3 by two half hitches, then fastened to seven or spring pole.    No. 7, spring pole.    Nos. 8, 8, small stakes driven in ground to form a pen.    Nos. 9, 9, two small twigs split at top to hold snare loop in place.    Nos. 1 and 2 should be about 4 inches apart.    No. 3 goes through a gimlet hole in No. 4. About three inches from  the top use any small round stick from 1/2 to 1 inch in thickness,  not necessary to flatten No. 4 as in illustration. Use it natural  bark on. From hole in No. 4 to bottom end should be about 7 inches.      [Illustration: RAT RUNWAY SNARE. UNDERGROUND RAT RUNWAY. RUNWAY AND  CUBBY SET. LOG SET SNARE. COW PATH SNARE.]    Snare loop about 6 inches in front of bait, held in place by 9, 9,  slightly leaning against 8,8.    It can be plainly seen that if an animal takes No. 5 in its jaws and  tries to remove it, it moves out the bottom of No. 4, moving forward  No. 3 until, flip! up she goes. The top of No. 4 must be tight  against the tree when set.      [Illustration: LIFTING POLE SNARE.]    No. 3 should just catch under No. 1 and 2, then it takes but 1/2 inch  to pull on bait to spring it. Bait with frogs, fish, tainted meat for  skunk, and pieces of rabbit, muskrat or bird, for mink.    The lynx, like the wolverine, is not afraid of a snowshoe track, and  will follow a line of rabbit snare for long distances, and when he  sees a bunny hanging up, he, without the least compunction,  appropriates it to himself, by right of discovery.    When he does this once he will come again and the Indian hunter,  knowing this, at once sets a snare for \"Mister Cat.\" Sometimes when  the thief has left a portion of the rabbit, a branch house is built  up against the trunk of some tree, the remains of the rabbit placed  at the back and the snare set at the doorway.      [Illustration: BAIT SET SNARE.]    A stout birch stick is cut about three or four feet long and lodged  on a forked stick at each side of the door and about two and a half  feet high. To the middle of this crossbar the end of the twine is  tied; No. 9 Holland is generally used, or No. 6 thread cod line. This  is gummed by rubbing balsam branches up and down the twine in the  same way as the bear snare. The noose is held in shape in one or two  places at each side by a light strand of wood or blade of grass and a  couple of small dry sticks are placed upright under the snare to  prevent the cat from passing beneath.    The loop is almost as large as for a bear and as high from the  ground, if not higher. The lynx has long legs and carries his head  straight in front of him and takes a snare by pushing thru it, or by  a rush, never crouching and then springing.    As the resort of rabbits is a young growth of country, there are also  lynx in the greatest numbers. Rabbits and partridges are their  principal food. When the Indian enters a new piece of country to set  rabbit snares to support his wife and family and sees signs of lynx,  he combines the two kinds of hunting and as he goes along, once in a  while, he bars his snowshoe track by placing a lynx snare in the way.  The lynx are fond of the smell of castor, as indeed are most animals,  so the hunter rubs a little on a tree at each side of his snare for  the cat to rub against when he comes that way.    The snare is never tied to anything immovable, as they are very  powerful and would break the twine. As soon as the noose tightens the  cross piece comes readily away from the supports and the cat springs  to one side. The stick, however, either knocks him a blow or gets  tangled in his legs. This he tries several times, but with the same  result, that bothersome stick is always hanging to his neck. About  the last effort he makes to free himself is to ascend a tree. This,  however, is nearly always fatal, for after he gets up a certain  distance this trouble some stick is sure to get fast back of some  limb. The lynx by this time, having become a pretty cross cat, makes  matters worse and the hunter finds him hanging dead, at times twenty  or thirty feet from the earth.        CHAPTER XVIII    THE BOX TRAP.    This trap is put to various uses. The beginner usually has one or two  with which he traps for rabbits. In fact they are great for that for  the animal is not injured, which is often the case when shot or  caught by dogs. Rabbits caught in box traps are therefore the best  for eating.    The trapper who wants to secure fur-bearers alive to sell to parks,  menageries or to start a \"fur ranch\" usually uses the box trap.    The size for rabbits is about 30 inches long by 5 wide and 6 high.  The boards can be of any kind but pine, poplar, etc., being light is  much used. The boards need only be a half inch thick. To make a trap  you will need four pieces 30 inches long; two of these for the sides  should be six inches wide; the other two for top and bottom should be  5 inches. These pieces should be nailed on the top and bottom of the  sides. This will make the inside of the trap six inches high by four  wide. It is best to have your trap narrow so that the animal you are  trapping cannot turn in the trap.    In one end of the trap wires or small iron rods should be placed (see  illustration). These should be about an inch apart. In the other end  the door is constructed. This can be made out of wire also. The  bottom of door should strike about eight inches inside. It will be  seen that an animal pushing against the door, from the outside,  raises it, but once on the inside the more they push against it the  tighter it becomes.      [Illustration: THE BOX TRAP.]    The trap can be set at holes where game is known to be, or can be  placed where game frequents and baited. If bait is used place a  little prop under the door and place bait back in trap a foot or  more. Bait to use of course depending upon what you are trapping.    The trap described is about right size for the common rabbit and  mink. For skunk and opossum a trap a little larger will be required.    For mink and other animals that are gnawers the traps should be  visited daily for they may gnaw and escape. If impossible to visit  traps daily they should be lined with tin.    In many places these traps, with a door at each end, are used for  catching muskrat. They are set in their dens under water and either  tied or weighted down. The rats are caught either going in or  leaving.    In making these traps the beginner is apt to make them too wide--so  the animal can turn within. This is a mistake for it gives the game  more freedom and room to gnaw to liberty.    The animal simply goes in and is there until the trapper comes along  and removes the game. Skunk can be drowned when caught in this trap  without scenting if the trapper knows how to go about it.    The trap should be handled carefully. Take to water sufficiently deep  to cover the trap and slowly sink and then either weight the trap or  hold down until the animal is drowned.    The box trap is a humane trap if visited daily. They are rather  unhandy to carry about and few trappers want many, yet under certain  conditions they are very useful. They can be made during idle time.  For mink and other shy animals they should be handled as little as  possible. They should be made of old boards or at least avoid all  appearances of newness.      * * *    Some sections saplings to make deadfalls cannot be had and for the  benefit of such, a wooden trap, three feet long and six inches wide  and deep, is a good manner to take muskrat, writes a Western trapper.  The boards can be cut out of any old lumber. In each end is a wire  door, hung on hinges at the top. These doors rise at the slightest  push on the outside, but will not open from the inside.
