This babbler tends to inhabit secondary growth more than does _T.       malaccense_ and was partly arboreal, occasionally ranging as high       as 20 feet above ground. It occurred occasionally in flocks of four       or five.    _=Malacopteron magnum magnum=_ Eyton: Greater Red-headed  Babbler.--_Specimens_, 12: Cocoa Research Station: [Male] testis 7 x 5  mm., September 7, 1962, MCT 2886; [Male] testis 9 x 5 mm., October 4,  1962, MCT 2990; [Male], November 30, 1962, MCT 3437; [Female], November  27, 1962, MCT 3340; [Female], April 30, 1963, ADG 91; [Male], June 14,  1963, ADG 136; [Male], July 9, 1963, ADG 178.

This babbler was common at the Cocoa Research Station but uncommon       elsewhere. It seemed to prefer primary forest and was only rarely       seen in the cocoa. My series shows that this species was common at       Quoin Hill and _M. cinereum_ was rare, while the opposite obtained       12 miles north of Kalabakan. For the moment this cannot be       explained. Possibly these two species are competitive and tend       toward mutual exclusion. Since the birds were mostly netted, it is       assumed that I obtained a random sample. My observations at Quoin       Hill seem to bear out the specimen record.         The specimens in my series of _M. m. magnum_ are more nearly black       on the crown than those labelled _M. m. saba_ in the U. S. National       Museum (from the Segah River), but there was much variation in the       amount of black on the crown in all series examined. I consider _M.       m. saba_ to be synonymous with _M. m. magnum_.    _=Malacopteron cinereum cinereum=_ Eyton: Lesser Red-headed  Babbler.--_Specimens_, 29: Cocoa Research Station: [Male], December 2,  1962, MCT 3428; [Female], June 11, 1963, ADG 124; [Male], July 9, 1963,  ADG 178. 12 mi.

SW Tenom: [Male],  December 19, 1962, MCT 3462. Oil Palm Research Station: [Female], August  28, 1963, ADG 265.         This babbler inhabits the understory of primary forest, and       occasionally is seen in secondary forest scrub. A specimen was       taken at 4,000 feet elevation in moss forest near Tenom. The       breeding season is seemingly in June and July but there is       indication of gonadal activity in males in October (MCT 3108). On       October 15, 1962, I observed an individual feeding on the rough       bark of a large dipterocarp. The bird was clinging to the bark much       as a nuthatch would, hopping along the vertical trunk upside down,       laterally and straight up. Other birds of the species were feeding       close by in small trees about 20 feet tall.    _=Pomatorhinus montanus borneensis=_ Cabanis: Chestnut-backed Scimitar  Babbler.--_Specimens_, 3: Cocoa Research Station: [Male] testis 5 x 2  mm., 33.1 gm., July 23, 1962, MCT 2643; [Male] testis 2 x 1 mm., 28.2  gm., July 24, 1962, MCT 2655. 5.5 mi. SW Tenom: [Male], December 22,  1962, MCT 3496.         This bird of the understory in primary forest was seen in only one       other situation, 12 miles north of Kalabakan it was feeding in a       clearing near our camp.    _=Ptilocichla leucogrammica=_ (Bonaparte): Bornean  Wren-babbler.--_Specimens_, 3: Ulu Balung Cocoa Estate: [Male], July 17,  1963, ADG 207: [Female] one egg in oviduct, July 19, 1963, ADG 211. Oil  Palm Research Station: [Female] egg in oviduct, August 13, 1963, ADG  230.         Garcia netted three specimens in primary forest. This bird is known       from Borneo only from a few specimens (Smythies, 1960:410). In       North Borneo, it has been known previously only from Bettotan on       the east coast (Smythies, 1960:410). The additional records       published herewith also are for the east coast.    _=Kenopia striata=_ (Blyth): Striped Wren-babbler.--_Specimens_, 11:  Cocoa Research Station: [Female], 21.1 gm., July 24, 1962, MCT 2649;  [Male] testis 4 x 3 mm., 19.6 gm., July 24, 1962, MCT 2640; [Male]  testis 2 x 1 mm., 18.7 gm., July 27, 1962, MCT 2670. 12 mi.

Ulu Balung Cocoa Estate: [Male], July 21, 1963, ADG 213. Oil  Palm Research Station: [Male], August 13, 1963, ADG 229; [Female],  August 19, 1963, ADG 250.         This bird of primary forest is found occasionally in adjacent       secondary forest and spends about three-fourths of its time running       about on the ground, only occasionally ascending to the lower       branches of trees. The song may be rendered as _kittle jank_, the       first note being trilled and a bit higher than the last, which is       short and chopped off. This babbler appears to sing as it moves       along the forest floor without stopping. It was observed foraging       under leaves, and was common both at Quoin Hill and 12 miles north       of Kalabakan, in groups of two or three birds.    _=Macronous gularis=_ (Horsfield): Striped Tit-babbler.--I saw this bird  at the Semporna Rest House feeding in shrubbery. It was not seen  elsewhere.    _=Macronous ptilosus reclusus=_ Hartert: Fluffy-backed  Tit-babbler.--_Specimens_, 2: Kalabakan: [Male], November 15, 1962, MCT  3283. Oil Palm Research Station: sex?, August 23, 1963, ADG 254.         This bird was seen only at Kalabakan, in dense secondary growth. My       specimen was in heavy molt.    _=Stachyris nigriceps hartleyi=_ Chasen: Gray-throated Tree  Babbler.--_Specimens_, 16: 5.5 mi.

This babbler was abundant in the moss forest above Tenom and       appeared to be at the height of its breeding season in December.         The specimens were compared with material at the American Museum of       Natural History and proved to be _S. n. hartleyi_, which has not       previously been reported from North Borneo.    _=Stachyris poliocephala=_ (Temminck): Gray-headed Tree  Babbler.--_Specimens_, 8: Cocoa Research Station: [Male] testis 3 x 2  mm., 24.0 gm., July 28, 1962, MCT 2674; [Male], December 1, 1962,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3307"],[0,"The Pagan Tribes of Borneo (#12)"],[1,"churn the surface of the ground into a thick layer of slippery mire.    Here and there along the front of the house are open platforms raised  to the level of the floor, on which the PADI is exposed to the sun  to be dried before being husked.    Under the house, among the piles on which it is raised, such  boats as are not in daily use are stored. Round about the house,  and especially on the space between it and the brink of the river,  are numerous PADI barns (Pl. 40). Each of these, the storehouse of  the grain harvested by one family, is a large wooden bin about 10  feet square, raised on piles some 7 feet from the ground. Each pile  carries just below the level of the floor of the bin a large disc of  wood horizontally disposed, and perforated at its centre by the pile;  this serves to prevent rats and mice gaining access to the bin. The  shingle roof of the bin is like that of the house, but the two ends  are filled by sloping surfaces running up under the gables. There  are generally also a few fruit trees and tobacco plants in the space  cleared round about the house; and in the space between it and the  river are usually some rudely carved wooden figures, around which  rites and ceremonies are performed from time to time.    Kayan villages generally consist of several, in some cases as many  as seven or eight, such houses of various lengths, grouped closely  together. The favourite situation for such a village is a peninsula  formed by a sharp bend of the river.    Of the houses built by the other peoples, those of the Kenyahs very  closely resemble those of the Kayans. The Kenyah village frequently  consists of a single long house (and with the Sea Dayaks this is  invariably the case), and it is in many cases perched on a high  steep bank immediately above the river. Some of the Klemantans also  build houses little if at all inferior to those of the Kayans, and  very similar to them in general plan. But in this as in all other  respects the Klemantans exhibit great diversities, some of their  houses being built in a comparatively flimsy manner, light timber  and even bamboos being used, and the roof being made of leaves. The  houses of the Muruts are small and low, and of poor construction.    The Sea Dayak's house differs from that of the Kayan more than any  of the others. The general plan is the same; but the place of the  few massive piles is taken by a much larger number of slender piles,  which pass up to the roof through the gallery and chambers. Of the  gallery only a narrow passageway alongside the main partition-wall  is kept clear of piles and other obstructions. The floor is of split  bamboo covered with coarse mats. An open platform at the level of the  floor runs along the whole length of the open side of the house. There  are no PADI barns about the house, the PADI being kept in bins in the  roofs. The roof itself is low, giving little head space. The gallery  of the house makes an impression of lack of space, very different to  that made by the long wide gallery of a Kayan or Kenyah house.    Although the more solidly built houses, such as those of the Kayans,  would be habitable for many generations, few of them are inhabited for  more than fifteen or twenty years, and some are used for much shorter  periods only. For one reason or another the village community decides  to build itself a new house on a different and sometimes distant site,  though the new site is usually in the same tributary river, or, if on  the main river, within a few miles of the old one. The most frequent  causes of removal are, first, using up of the soil in the immediate  neighbourhood of the village, for they do not cultivate the same  patch more than three or four times at intervals of several years;  secondly, the occurrence of a fatal epidemic; thirdly, any run of bad  luck or succession of evil omens; fourthly, the burning of the house,  whether accidentally or in the course of an attack by enemies.    On removing to a new site the planks and the best of the timber of a  well-built house are usually towed along the river to the spot chosen,  and used in the construction of the new house.    After the houses the most important of the material possessions of the  people are their boats. Each family possesses at least one small boat  capable of carrying seven or eight persons, and used chiefly for going  to and from the PADI fields, but also for fishing and short journeys  of all kinds. In addition to these the community possesses several  larger boats used for longer journeys, and generally at least one long  war-boat, capable of carrying 50 to 100 men. Each boat, even one of  the largest size, is hollowed from a single log, the freeboard being  raised by lashing narrow planks to the edge of the hollowed log. In  the middle of a large boat is a section, the freeboard of which is  raised still higher, and which is covered by an arched roof of palm  leaves. The boat is crossed at intervals of some three feet by seats  formed of short planks, each supported at both ends by projections of  the main timber, to which they are lashed with rattan. In travelling  on the lower reaches of the rivers, the rowers sit two on each bench,  side by side and facing the bow. On the upper reaches, where rapids  abound, a deck is made by laying split bamboos along the length of the  boat upon the benches, and the crew sits upon this deck in paddling,  or stands upon it when poling the boat over rapids.    In addition to the clothes, houses, and boats, and the domestic  animals mentioned above, and to the personal ornaments and weapons  to be described in later chapters, the material possessions of the  Kayans consist chiefly of baskets and mats.    The baskets are of various shapes and sizes, adapted to a variety  of uses. The largest size holds about two bushels of PADI, and is  chiefly used for transporting grain from the fields to the house  (Fig. 4). It is almost cylindrical in shape, but rather wider at  the upper end. Four strips of wood running down from near the upper  edge project slightly below, forming short legs on which the basket  stands. The upper end is closed by a detachable cap, which fits inside  the upper lip of the basket. It is provided with a pair of shoulder  straps, and a strap which is passed over the crown of the head. These  straps are made of a single strip of tough beaten bark. One end of it  is attached to the foot of the basket; a second attachment is made  at the middle of the height, forming a loop for the one shoulder;  the strip is then looped over to the corresponding point on the other  side, forming the loop for the head, and then carried down to the foot  of the basket on that side to form the loop for the other shoulder.    A smaller cylindrical basket, very neatly plaited of thin and very  pliable strips of rattan, is used for carrying the few articles which  a man takes with him in travelling -- a little rice and tobacco,  a spare waist cloth, a sleeping mat, perhaps a second mat of palm  leaves used as a protection against rain, a roll of dried banana  leaves for making cigarettes, perhaps a cap for wear in the house, and,  not infrequently nowadays, a bright coloured handkerchief of Chinese  silk. The lip of the basket is surrounded by a close set row of eyes  through which a cord is passed. To this cord a net is attached,  and is drawn together in the centre of the opening of the basket  by a second cord, in order to confine its contents. This basket is  provided with shoulder straps only.    In addition to these two principal baskets, each family has a number  of smaller baskets of various shapes for storing their personal  belongings, and for containing food in course of preparation (Fig. 5).    The mats are of many shapes and sizes. The largest are spread on  the raised part of the floor, both of the gallery and of the private  chambers, when a party sits down to eat or converse. Each individual  has his own sleeping mat, and each family has a number of mats used  for drying, husking, winnowing, and sieving the PADI.    The bamboo water-vessel consists of a section of the stem of the  bamboo, closed at the lower end by the natural septum, the upper end  having a lip or spout formed at the level of the succeeding septum. A  short length of a branch remains projecting downwards to form a handle,  by means of which the vessel can be conveniently suspended. These  vessels are used also for carrying rice-spirit or BORAK; but this  is stored in large jars of earthenware or china. The native jar of  earthenware is ovoid in shape and holds about one gallon, but these  are now largely superseded by jars made by the Chinese.    Each family possesses some dishes and platters of hardwood (Figs. 6  and 7), and generally a few china plates bought from traders; but a  large leaf is the plate most commonly used.    Rice, the principal food, which forms the bulk of every meal, is  boiled in an iron or brass pot with lip, handle, and lid, not unlike  the old English cauldron; it has no legs, and is placed on a tripod of  stones or suspended over the fire. This metal pot, which is obtained  from the Chinese traders, has superseded the home-made pot of clay  (Fig. 8) and the bamboo vessels in which the rice was cooked in former  times. A larger wide stewpan is also used for cooking pork, vegetables,  and fish. The Kayans smoke tobacco, which they cultivate in small  quantities. It is generally smoked in the form of large cigarettes,  the finely cut leaf being rolled in sheets of dried banana leaf. But  it is also smoked in pipes, which are made in a variety of shapes, the  bowl of hardwood, the stem of slender bamboo (Fig. 9). Sea Dayaks chew  tobacco, but smoke little, being devoted to the chewing of betel nut.    In every house is a number of large brass gongs (TAWAK), which are  used in various ceremonies and for signalling, and constitute also  one of the best recognised standards of"]]]
