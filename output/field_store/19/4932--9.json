Here we have  distinctive marks, quite independent of the ground colour of the wings.    The sexes of this butterfly are nearly alike in their markings, the chief  difference being in the yellower ground tint of the males.    The same localities--viz. the south and south-east coast, and the adjacent  district--that are most prolific in its near relative, _Edusa_, likewise  furnish this species in the greatest plenty; but this is by far the rarer  species of the two, and, either by coincidence, or in obedience to some  direct law, several successive periods of its abundance have been  septennial, or have occurred once in seven years. Thus the years 1821, '28,  '35, '42, '49, and '56 are noted in entomological records as having  produced it in great numbers.    On the coast of France, opposite to our own, it is one of the common  butterflies, and it is not improbable that it frequently makes the passage  of the Channel. The maritime habits of both this and _Edusa_ are well  known, and I have frequently seen the latter flying out to seawards, and  coquetting with the waves, till the eye could follow the golden speck no  longer. Taking advantage then of a favouring wind, its naturally strong  {77} and rapid flight would quickly take it across the few miles of sea  that separate us from the Gallic shore.    _Hyale_, whose flight is at least as strong as _Edusa's_, and whose  salt-water tastes are similar, doubtless acts in the same manner.    The northward range of this species is more limited than that of _Edusa_,  but it has been taken singly near York, Manchester, and a few other  northern localities. In the lucerne fields near Brighton, a dozen or more  have been sometimes captured in one day.    The _caterpillar_ is of a sea-green colour, with four yellow lines, two  along the back and one on each side; and is to be found, in June and July,  feeding on lucerne and other plants of the same natural order.    The _chrysalis_ is very similar to that of _Edusa_, green, with a yellow  stripe.    In this country, the _butterfly_ first appears in August; but on the  Continent it seems to be double-brooded, being found in May as well as in  August.           *       *       *       *       *    THE BLACK-VEINED OR HAWTHORN BUTTERFLY. (_Aporia Crataegi._)    (Plate IV. fig. 1.)    When on the wing, this species might easily be mistaken by the  inexperienced for the common Cabbage {78} White; and, by virtue of this  _incognito_, does in all probability often escape from the terrors of the  net, which would speedily entrap him, were his real character known to the  young hunter; for this butterfly is one of those called, in entomological  slang, \"_a good thing_\"--a term expressive neither of superior excellence  nor beauty, but meaning that the insect can't be met with everywhere, or  every day, and when seen is always to be caught.    A closer view, however, shows it to be very distinct from all the other  \"Whites;\" its _decided black veinings on a milk-white ground_, in  conjunction with its large size, being sufficient for its immediate  recognition.    The outline of the wings, as well as the play of the veining lines on their  surface, is extremely elegant. It will be observed, that instead of the  feathered fringe that surrounds the wings of most butterflies, they are  bordered in this species by a stout nervure, forming a sharp black outline,  and giving a peculiarly chaste finish.    The under side differs in no mentionable respect from the upper--a very  rare circumstance in this tribe. From being very sparingly coated with  scales, the wings are semi-transparent, differing much in this respect from  those of the Garden White butterflies.    The female generally has the veins of the fore wings of a browner tint than  in the males.    This butterfly is one of the very local species, though its food plants are  everywhere to be found, in more or less abundance. {79}    The following localities, among others, have been recorded as producing  it:--Herne Bay, and other parts of the Isle of Thanet, plentifully; near  Faversham, Kent; Horsham, Sussex; New Forest; Brington, in Huntingdonshire;  near Cardiff, South Wales, plentiful.    The caterpillars are gregarious, feeding under cover of a silken web. The  hawthorn and the sloe are its chief food plants in this country, but it is  here too rare an insect to do much damage. Not so, however, on the  Continent, where it is extremely common, and is classed among noxious  insects, committing great devastation among various fruit trees, especially  the apple, pear, and cherry.    But even in this country the insect is occasionally met with in great  profusion, but only in isolated spots. Mr. Drane, writing from Cardiff to  the _Zoologist_, says, \"In the middle of April (1858) I found the _larvae_  feeding by thousands upon insulated shrubs of _Prunus Spinosa_ (Common  Sloe), eating out the centres of the unexpanded buds, or basking in the sun  upon their winter webs.\"    The body of the adult _caterpillar_ is thickly clothed with whitish hairs,  is leaden grey on the side and underneath, black on the back, and marked  with two longitudinal reddish stripes. Found from the middle of April to  the end of May.    The _chrysalis_, shown at fig. 14, Plate I., is greenish white, striped  with yellow and spotted with black.    The _butterfly_ appears in June.           *       *       *       *       *    {80}    THE LARGE GARDEN WHITE BUTTERFLY (_Pieris Brassicae._)    (Plate IV. fig. 2.)    Why this butterfly should so far outnumber every other native species  (excepting, perhaps, the more rural Meadow Brown), is a question beyond our  power to answer satisfactorily. Certainly, the food plants of the  caterpillar--cabbages, cresses, and their tribe--are universally met with;  but then we find there are other insects whose food plant is equally  plentiful and widespread, and yet they are nevertheless very rare or local.    This is pre-eminently the domestic butterfly, abounding in suburban  gardens, and at times penetrating into the smoky heart of London, and then  even the young \"St. Giles's bird,\" whose eyes were never gladdened by green  fields, gets up a butterfly hunt, and, cap (or rag) in hand, feels for the  nonce all the enthusiasm of the chase in pursuit of the white-winged  wanderer, who looks sadly lost and out of place in the flowerless,  brick-and-mortar wilderness.    This and the next species are the only British butterflies who can be  charged with committing any appreciable amount of damage to human food and  property. In the winged state, indeed, it is utterly harmless (like all  other butterflies); but not so the hungry caterpillar progeny, as the  gardener knows too well when he looks {81} at his choice cabbage rows all  gnawed away into skeletons.    In some seasons and places they multiply so inordinately and prodigiously  as to deserve the title of a plague of caterpillars, and several remarkable  instances of this phenomenon are on record.    A note in the _Zoologist_, p. 4547, by the Rev. Arthur Hussey, gives us the  following:--\"For the last two summers many of the gardens of this village  have been infested by caterpillars to such an extent that the cabbages have  been utterly destroyed.\" When the time for changing to the chrysalis state  arrived, the surrounding buildings presented a curious appearance, being  marked with long lines of the creatures travelling up the walls in search  of a suitable place of shelter for undergoing their transformation. A great  number of the caterpillars took refuge in a malt-house, from which they  could not escape as butterflies, the result being that for several weeks  the maltster swept up daily many hundreds of the dead insects.    In 1842, a vast flight of white butterflies came over from the Continent to  the coast about Dover, and spreading inland from thence, did an immense  amount of damage to the cabbage gardens; but so effectually did the  ichneumon flies do their work, that an exceedingly small proportion of the  caterpillars, resulting from this flock of immigrants, went into the  chrysalis state, nearly all perishing just before the period of change.    Those small, silky, oval objects, of yellowish colour, {82} frequently  found in groups on walls and palings, are the _cocoons_ of these useful  little flies, spun round about and over the remains of the dead caterpillar  their victim. \"These,\" as Mr. Westwood observes, \"ignorant persons mistake  for the eggs of the caterpillar, and destroy; thus foolishly killing their  benefactors.\"    Happily these devastating caterpillars have plenty of enemies to prevent  their continued multiplication, and to reduce their number speedily when it  exceeds certain limits. Besides the ichneumons, mentioned above, the  feathered tribes do much towards keeping them down. Mr. Haworth, in his  \"_Lepidoptera Britannica_,\" says, with reference to this: \"Small birds  destroy incredible numbers of them as food, and should be encouraged. I  once observed a titmouse (_Parus major_) take five or six large ones to its  nest in a very few minutes. In enclosed gardens sea-gulls, with their wings  cut, are of infinite service. I had one eight years, which was at last  killed by accident, that lived entirely all the while upon the insects,  slugs, and worms which he found in the garden.\"    The pretty _egg_ of this butterfly is figured on Plate II. fig. 1: it may  be found commonly enough, with a little searching, on cabbage-leaves,  either at the end of May or beginning of August.    The _caterpillar_, which, besides cabbages, consumes various other  cruciferous plants,--also Tropaeolums, or, as they are erroneously called,  \"Nasturtiums,\"--is green, {83} shaded with yellow on each side, and covered  with black points, on each of which is situated a hair.    By way of compensation for the damage it inflicts, it has been suggested  that a durable green dye might be"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33874"],[0,"Wild Bees, Wasps and Ants and Other Stinging Insects (#12)"],[1,", as  is the case in _Halictus_ and _Sphecodes_. If one visits a locality in the  spring one may catch any number of females of _Halictus_, but no males  appear till the late {98} summer or autumn, and, unless one visits the same  spot again when both sexes are out, it is impossible to associate males and  females. I have at the present moment in my collection several males,  which, being in doubt about myself, I have communicated to continental  authorities, who have returned them to me as possibly the male of so and  so! and we shall have to remain in uncertainty about them till some one  happens to take both sexes together, when the mystery will be solved.    In time of appearance the males always precede the females--in burrows,  such as those of the leaf-cutting bees, etc., it may seem puzzling as to  how this is arranged, as one cell is placed over the other so that those  lower down in the tube cannot pass those higher up. This difficulty is got  over by the arrangement that the first eggs laid by the mother bee are  female and the last male, so that those at the top belong to this latter  sex; these emerge as soon as the warmth of the sun is great enough to  energize them sufficiently to break through their cell covering, when they  emerge and wait for the appearance of their females. The males of {99} some  species of _Andrena_ seem to take great pleasure in flying rapidly up and  down hedgerows, hardly ever settling, and apparently far away from their  females, which are probably pollen collecting in dandelions or some such  flowers in the neighbourhood.           *       *       *       *       *    {100}    THE VAGARIES OF COLOUR AND STRUCTURE IN THE SEXES    As a rule the male is rather smaller and especially slenderer than the  female, but there are notable exceptions; in one genus of the fossors,  _Myrmosa_ for instance, the male is many times larger than the female. In  this case the male is winged and the female is wingless. Also, if there is  a difference in brightness of coloration between the sexes, as a rule the  male is duller than the female--this is especially the case among the  bees--but if there is any eccentricity in the form of the limbs it is  almost sure to occur in the male, and I think one would not go far wrong in  saying that when peculiar features occur in the female, the reason for them  is more or less apparent, whereas for the eccentricities of the male there  really often seems to be no assignable cause. These male eccentricities are  often exceedingly marked. A very good {101} [Illustration: FIG. 23.]  [Illustration: FIG. 24.] example of them occurs among the small \"keyhole\"  wasps. All the British species are practically alike in coloration. They  may vary in having a greater or less number of yellow bands on the body,  but otherwise their distinctions rest on structure. In the females the  antennae are slightly thickened towards the apex, but otherwise they are  simple. The males, however, are divided into three quite distinct groups.  In the first of these, the end joints of the antennae are rolled up in more  or less of a spiral (fig. 23, 2); in the second, the apical joint is turned  sharply back like a hook (fig. 23, 1); in the third, the end joints of the  antennae are simple and more or less like those of the female. Now if we  examine the legs of the males in the first group we shall find still  greater peculiarities; in two of our species there is a long yellow spine  at the extreme base of the middle leg on the little joint by which it  articulates on to the body (fig. 24, 2), and a curious pencil of hairs  {102} on each side of the mouth. In two others, the femora, or thighs of  the middle legs, are cut into two deep somewhat semicircular incisions  (fig. 24, 1)--a most curious character; but here again the females have no  corresponding peculiarities. There seems to be no explanation known for  these vagaries, and yet one feels that there must be some object served by  them. If we turn to the bees we shall find that in many species the face of  the male is white to a greater or less extent, whereas that character is  very rare in the female. The front feet are produced into a wide flattened  form in some, in others the middle legs are extraordinarily developed, and  provided with tufts of hairs, etc. Another form of male development lies in  the form of the head. This is sometimes very much enlarged--often varying  considerably in this respect in specimens of the same species; there is  often a projecting tooth or spine on the mandible or jaw at its base, or  frequently on the cheek just above it. Then in the fossors the males of the  genus _Crabro_ break out into numerous eccentricities; in some, two or more  of the joints of the antennae are soldered together and curved or cut out  into {103} curious forms (fig. 26); in others the front shin or tibia is  formed like a concave shield or shell (fig. 25), and all the joints of that  leg more or less distorted; in another male (a rather doubtful native which  has not been taken in this country for fifty years) the head is narrowed  behind into an almost ridiculously small neck, being quite triangular in  form, viewed from above, with the eyes projecting from its anterior angles  (fig. 27, 1), the female head being of normal form (fig. 27, 2).    [Illustration: FIG. 25.]    [Illustration: FIG. 26.]    [Illustration: FIG. 27.]    In the males of several species of fossors and bees the eyes are enormously  developed, joining one another on the top of the head. This condition  occurs also in the drone of the hive bee. The male of _Astatus_, which has  this character, has also a peculiar habit. It sits basking in the sun on  some bare sandy spot, and when disturbed makes a sort of circular detour  and pitches down again exactly on the spot from which it started up. An  {104} increased length of the antennae is another male characteristic. This  is carried to an extraordinary development in what is called the \"long  horned bee\"; this bee, which is pretty common in some places, has antennae  which, when directed backwards, are almost as long as its body--the female  has quite an ordinary pair.    Another set of male characters which are of great value to systematists  lies in the hidden apical segments of the underside; although these are  hidden, being telescoped up inside the segments which close the apical  opening of the body, they often assume most curious and beautiful forms,  and are characters whereby the males of a species may be determined with  certainty when the females defy all one's endeavours to discover their  identity.           *       *       *       *       *    {105}    THE DISTRIBUTION, RARITY, OR ABUNDANCE OF VARIOUS SPECIES    There are few points about which we know less than the causes of  distribution and rarity, although there are certain tolerably well  recognized laws which govern the occurrence of some species in certain  localities. What I mean is that marshy spots, say salt marshes for  instance, attract certain beetles and bugs which are never found except in  such places; certain kinds of flowers attract bees which never appear to  visit any others, but these localities and kinds of flowers occur often at  great distances from each other, and why--given a certain flower you  probably find a certain bee peculiar to it; or given a certain kind of  marsh you probably find a certain beetle, although the localities may be  hundreds of miles apart--I think still awaits explanation. I will give an  example with which I am personally well acquainted. {106} There is a rare  little bee (_Macropis labiata_) which at one time was looked upon as an  extreme rarity, having only occurred three or four times in this country.  Mr. F. Enoch, comparatively lately, took a fair number on the flowers of  the greater loose-strife (_Lysimachia vulgaris_) along the canal at Woking;  now that its food-plant is known, it has occurred in several other places  in numbers, and no doubt wherever the _Lysimachia_ is abundant _Macropis_  will probably occur, but how the little creature has been distributed over  the places where this plant occurs, which are often far distant from each  other, seems to me to be an unsolved problem. Then there is another  puzzling point, and that is the extreme rarity of certain insects. No doubt  in many cases this is due to ignorance of their habits, as it has  frequently happened that species once considered of great rarity have  occurred in abundance when their habits have been discovered, as in the  case of _Macropis_, but there are some cases which do not seem to be  explainable in this way. I will again give an example which has been  specially under my own observation. _Dufourea vulgaris_, a little black  bee, {107} which certainly might not be recognized from its outward  appearance, as there are many which very closely resemble it, is still one  of our greatest rarities, only three British examples having been recorded.  The first was taken by Sir Sidney Saunders at Chewton, Hants, on the  twelfth of August, 1879; this was a male; the second, a female, was taken  by Mr. T. R. Billups at Woking, on the first of August, 1881; and the third  by myself at Chobham (about four miles from Woking) on the first of August,  1891. I believe in all cases these were taken on yellow composite flowers.  The flight and behaviour of the male I caught were so peculiar, as it  wriggled itself into the flower, that I knew at once I had caught a rarity,  and remarked to my companions that I believed I had got a _Dufourea_. I  also hazarded the remark that it was \"ten years since it had been taken.\"  When I got home and looked up the former record it was ten years to a day.  Now there are few places in England that have been better worked for the  bee tribe than the Woking, Chobham, and Weybridge neighbourhood; it has  been worked by experienced men who would see a difference {108} in the"]]]
