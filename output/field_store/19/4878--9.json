These two groups of black  moulds and white moulds are the noblest, and contain the largest  number of genera and species amongst the _Hyphomycetes_. There is,  however, the small group of _Isariacei_, in which the threads are  compacted, and a semblance of such hymenomycetal forms as _Clavaria_  and _Pterula_ is the result, but it is doubtful if this group contains  many autonomous species. In another small group, the _Stilbacei_,  there is a composite character in the head, or receptacle,[r] and in  the stem when the latter is present. Many of these, again, as  _Tubercularia_, _Volutella_, _Fusarium_, &c., contain doubtful  species. In _Sepedoniei_ and _Trichodermacei_, the threads are reduced  to a minimum, and the spores are such a distinctive element that  through these groups the _Hyphomycetes_ are linked with the  _Coniomycetes_. These groups, however, are not of sufficient size or  importance to demand from us, in a work of this character, anything  more than the passing allusion which we have given to them.    [Illustration: FIG. 30.--_Penicillium chartarum_, Cooke.]    We come now to consider the structure in the Sporidiifera, in which  the fructifying corpuscles or germs, whether called spores or  sporidia, are generated within certain privileged cysts, usually in  definite numbers. In systematic works, these are included under two  orders, the _Physomycetes_ and the _Ascomycetes_. The former of these  consists of cyst-bearing moulds, and from their nearest affinity to  the foregoing will occupy the first place.    [Illustration: FIG. 31.--_Mucor mucedo_, with three sporangia. _a._  Portion of frill with sporangiola.]    PHYSOMYCETES include, especially amongst the _Mucorini_, many most  interesting and instructive species for study, which even very lately  have occupied the attention of continental mycologists. Most of these  phenomena are associated more or less with reproduction, and as such  will have to be adverted to again, but there are points in the  structure which can best be alluded to here. Again taking Professor de  Bary's researches as our guide,[s] we will illustrate this by the  common _Mucor mucedo_: If we bring quite fresh horse-dung into a damp  confined atmosphere, for example, under a bell-glass, there appears on  its surface, after a few days, an immense white mildew. Upright strong  filaments of the breadth of a hair raise themselves over the surface,  each of them soon shows at its point a round little head, which  gradually becomes black, and a closer examination shows us that in all  principal points it perfectly agrees with the sporangia of other  species. Each of these white filaments is a sporangia-bearer. They  spring from a mycelium which is spread in the dung, and appear singly  upon it. Certain peculiarities in the form of the sporangium, and the  little long cylindrical spores, which, when examined separately, are  quite flat and colourless, are characteristic of the species. If the  latter be sown in a suitable medium, for example, in a solution of  sugar, they swell, and shoot forth germinating utricles, which quickly  grow to mycelia, which bear sporangia. This is easily produced on the  most various organic bodies, and _Mucor mucedo_ is therefore found  spontaneously on every substratum which is capable of nourishing  mildew, but on the above-named the most perfect and exuberant  specimens are generally to be found. The sporangia-bearers are at  first always branchless and without partitions. After the sporangium  is ripe, cross partitions in irregular order and number often appear  in the inner space, and on the upper surface branches of different  number and size, each of which forms a sporangium at its point. The  sporangia which are formed later are often very similar, but sometimes  very different, to those which first appeared, because their partition  is very thick and does not fall to pieces when it is ripe, but  irregularly breaks off, or remains entire, enclosing the spores, and  at last falls to the ground, when the fungus withers. The cross  partition which separates the sporangia from its bearers is in those  which are first formed (which are always relatively thicker sporangia)  very strongly convex, while those which follow later are often  smaller, and in little weak specimens much less arched, and sometimes  quite straight. After a few days, similar filaments generally show  themselves on the dung between the sporangia-bearers, which appear to  the naked eye to be provided with delicate white frills. Where such an  one is to be found, two to four rectangular expanding little branches  spring up to the same height round the filament. Each of these, after  a short and simple process, branch out into a furcated form; the  furcations being made in such a manner that the ends of the branch at  last so stand together that their surface forms a ball. Finally, each  of the ends of a branch swells to a little round sporangium, which is  limited by a partition (called sporangiolum, to distinguish it from  the larger ones), in which some, generally four, spores are formed in  the manner already known. When the sporangiola are alone, they have  such a peculiar appearance, with their richly-branched bearers, that  they can be taken for something quite different to the organs of the  _Mucor mucedo_, and were formerly not considered to belong to it. That  they really belong to the _Mucor_ is shown by the principal filament  which it bears, not always, but very often, ending with a large  sporangium, which is characteristic of the _Mucor mucedo_; it is still  more evident if we sow the spores of the sporangiolum, for, as it  germinates, a mycelium is developed, which, near a simple bearer, can  form large sporangia, and those form sporangiola, the first always  considerably preponderating in number, and very often exclusively. If  we examine a large number of specimens, we find every possible middle  form between the simple or less branched sporangia-bearers and the  typical sporangiola frills; and we arrive at last at the conclusion  simply to place the latter among the varieties of form which the  sporangia-bearer of the _Mucor mucedo_ shows, like every other typical  organic form within certain limits. On the other hand, propagation  organs, differing from those of the sporangia and their products,  belong to _Mucor mucedo_, which may be termed conidia. On the dung  (they are rare on any other substance) these appear at the same time,  or generally somewhat later, than the sporangia-bearers, and are not  unlike those to the naked eye. In a more accurate examination, they  appear different; a thicker, partition-less filament rises up and  divides itself, generally three-forked, at the length of one  millimetre, into several series of branchlets. The forked branches of  the last series bear under their points, which are mostly capillary,  short erect little ramuli, and these, with which the ends of the  principal branches articulate on their somewhat broad tops, several  spores and conidia, near one another; about fifteen to twenty are  formed at the end of each little ramulus. The peculiarities and  variations which so often appear in the ramification need not be  discussed here. After the articulation of the conidia, their bearers  sink together by degrees, and are quite destroyed. The ripe conidia  are round like a ball, their surface is scarcely coloured, and almost  wholly smooth. These conidioid forms were at first described as a  separate species under the name of _Botrytis Jonesii_. How, then, do  they belong to the _Mucor_?[t] That they appear gregariously is as  little proof of an original relation to one another, here as  elsewhere. Attempts to prove that the conidia and sporangia-bearers  originate on one and the same mycelium filament may possibly hereafter  succeed. Till now this has not been the case, and he who has ever  tried to disentangle the mass of filaments which exuberantly covers  the substratum of a _Mucor_ vegetation, which has reached so far as to  form conidia, will not be surprised that all attempts have hitherto  proved abortive. The suspicion of the connection founded on the  gregariously springing up, and external resemblance, is fully  justified, if we sow the conidia in a suitable medium, for example, in  a solution of sugar. They here germinate and produce a mycelium which  exactly resembles that of the _Mucor mucedo_, and, above all, they  produce in profusion the typical sporangia of the same on its bearers.  The latter are till now alone reproductions of conidia-bearers, and  have never been observed on mycelia which have grown out of conidia.    [Illustration: FIG. 32.--Small portion of _Botrytis Jonesii_.]    These phenomena of development appear in the _Mucor_ when it dwells on  a damp substance, which must naturally contain the necessary  nourishment for it, and is exposed to the atmospheric air. Its  mycelium represents at first strong branched utricles without  partitions; the branches are of the higher order, mostly divided into  rich and very fine-pointed ramuli. In old mycelium, and also in the  sporangia-bearers, the contents of which are mostly used for the  formation of spores, and the substratum of which is exhausted for our  fungus, short stationary pieces, filled with protoplasm, are very  often formed into cells through partitions in order to produce spores,  that is, grow to a new fruitful mycelium. These cells are called  gemmules, brooding cells, and resemble such vegetable buds and sprouts  of foliaceous plants which remain capable of development after the  organs of vegetation are dead, in order to grow, under suitable  circumstances, to new vegetating plants, as, for example, the bulbs of  onions, &c.    If we bring a vegetating mycelium of _Mucor mucedo_ into a medium  which contains the necessary nourishment for it, but"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30230"],[0,"A Story of the Red Cross; Glimpses of Field Work (#12)"],[1,"our objects were purely  humanitarian, having neither political, racial, nor religious  significance.    The Pasha listened most attentively to Mr. Terrell, thanked him, and  said that this was well understood, that they knew the Red Cross and its  president. Turning to me he repeated: \"We know you, Miss Barton; have  long known you and your work. We would like to hear your plans for  relief and what you desire.\"    I proceeded to state our plans for relief, which, if not carried out at  this time, the suffering in Armenia, unless we had been misinformed,  would shock the entire civilized world. None of us knew from personal  observation, as yet, the full need of assistance, but had reason to  believe it very great. If my agents were permitted to go, such need as  they found they would be prompt to relieve. On the other hand, if they  did not find the need existing there, none would leave the field so  gladly as they. There would be no respecting of persons--humanity alone  would be their guide. \"We have,\" I added, \"brought only ourselves; no  correspondent has accompanied us, and we shall have none, and shall not  go home to write a book on Turkey. We are not here for that. Nothing  shall be done in any concealed manner. All dispatches which we send will  go openly through your own telegraph, and I should be glad if all that  we shall write could be seen by your government. I can not, of course,  say what its character will be, but can vouch for its truth, fairness,  and integrity, and for the conduct of every leading man who shall be  sent. I shall never counsel or permit a sly or underhand action with  your government, and you will pardon me, Pasha, if I say I shall expect  the same treatment in return--such as I give I shall expect to receive.\"    Almost without a breath he replied: \"And you shall have it. We honor  your position and your wishes shall be respected. Such aid and  protection as we are able, we shall render.\"    I then asked if it were necessary for me to see other officials. \"No,\"  he replied, \"I speak for my government,\" and with cordial good wishes  our interview closed.    I never spoke personally with this gentleman again, all further business  being officially transacted through the officers of our legation. Yet I  can truly say, as I have said of my first meeting with our matchless  band of missionary workers, that here commenced an acquaintance which  proved invaluable, and here were given pledges of mutual faith, of which  not a word was ever broken on either side.    The Turkish Government, when once it came to understand American methods  and enthusiasm was forgiving and kind to us. No obstruction was ever  placed in our way. Our five expeditions passed through Armenian Turkey  from sea to sea, distributing whatever was needed, repairing the  destroyed machines, enabling the people to make tools to harvest their  grain, thus averting a famine; providing medical help and food as well  for thousands of sick; setting free the frightened inhabitants, and  returning them to the villages from which they had fled for their lives;  restoring all missionary freedom that had been interrupted; establishing  a more kindly feeling toward them on the part of the government; and  through all this, we had never one unpleasant transaction with any  person of whatever name or race.    While our expeditions were getting ready to go out by the Black Sea, a  request was brought to me by Dr. Washburn, of Robert College, from Sir  Philip Currie, the British Ambassador at Constantinople, asking if I  could not be \"persuaded\" to turn my expedition through the  Mediterranean, rather than the Black Sea, in order to reach Mirash and  Zeitoun, where the foreign consuls were at the moment convened. They had  gotten word to him that ten thousand people in those two cities were  down with four distinct epidemics--typhoid and typhus fevers, dysentery  and smallpox--that the victims were dying in overwhelming numbers, and  that there was not a physician among them, all being either sick or  dead, with no medicine and little food.    This was not a case for \"persuasion,\" but of heartfelt thanks from us  all, that Sir Philip had remembered to call us, whom he had never met.  But here was a hindrance. The only means of conveyance from  Constantinople to Alexandretta were coasting boats, belonging to  different nationalities, which left only once in two weeks, and  irregularly at that. Transport for our goods was secured on the first  boat to leave, the goods taken to the wharf at Galata, and at the latest  moment, in order to give time, a request was made to the government for  _teskeres_, or traveling permits, for Dr. J. B. Hubbell and assistants.  To our surprise they were granted instantly, but by some delay on the  part of the messenger sent for them they reached a moment too late. The  boat left a little more promptly, taking with it our relief goods, and  leaving the men on the dock to receive their permits only when the boat  was beyond recall. It was really the fault of no one.    With the least possible delay Dr. Hubbell secured passage by the first  boat at Smyrna, and a fortunate chance boat from there took him to  Alexandretta, via Beyrout and Tripoli, Syria. The goods arrived in  safety, and two other of our assistants, whom we had called by cable  from America--Edward M. Wistar and Charles King Wood--were also passed  over to the same point with more goods. There, caravans were fitted out  to leave over the--to them--unknown track to Aintab, as a first base.  From this point the reports of these three gentlemen made to me will be  living witnesses. They tell their own modest tales of exposure, severe  travel, hard work, and hardship, of which no word of complaint has ever  passed their lips. There have been only gratitude and joy, that they  could do something in a cause at once so great and so terrible.    While this was in progress, a dispatch came to me at Constantinople from  Dr. Shepard of Aintab, whose tireless hands had done the work of a score  of men, saying that fevers, both typhoid and typhus, of the most  virulent nature, had broken out in Arabkir, two or three days north of  Harpoot; could I send doctors and help? Passing the word on to Dr.  Hubbell at Harpoot, prompt and courageous action was taken by him. It is  something to say that from a rising pestilence with a score of deaths  daily, in five weeks, himself and his assistants left the city in a  normally healthful condition, the mortality ceasing at once under their  care and treatment.    During this time the medical relief for the cities of Zeitoun and Marash  was in charge of Dr. Ira Harris, of Tripoli, who reached there March  18th. The report of the consuls had placed the number of deaths from the  four contagious diseases at one hundred a day. This would be quite  probable when it is considered that ten thousand were smitten with the  prevailing diseases, and that added to this were the crowded condition  of the patients, the thousands of homeless refugees who had flocked from  their forsaken villages, the lack of all comforts, of air, cleanliness,  and a state of prolonged starvation.    Dr. Harris's first report to me was that he was obliged to set the soup  kettles boiling and feed his patients before medicine could be retained.  My reply was a draft for two hundred liras (something over eight hundred  dollars) with the added dispatch: \"Keep the pot boiling; let us know  your wants.\" The further reports show from this time an astonishingly  small number of deaths. The utmost care was taken by all our expeditions  to prevent the spread of the contagion and there is no record of its  ever having been carried out of the cities, where it was found, either  at Zeitoun, Marash, or Arabkir. Lacking this precaution, it might well  have spread throughout all Asia Minor, as was greatly feared by the  anxious people.    On the twenty-fourth of May, Dr. Harris reported the disease as  overcome. His stay being no longer needed, he returned to his great  charge in Tripoli, with the record of a medical work and success behind  him never surpassed if ever equaled. The lives he had saved were enough  to gain Heaven's choicest diadem. Never has America cause to be more  justly proud and grateful than when its sons and daughters in foreign  lands perform deeds of worth like that.    The closing of the medical fields threw our entire force into the  general relief of the vilayet of Harpoot, which the relieving  missionaries had well named their \"bottomless pit.\"    The apathy to which the state of utter nothingness, together with their  grief and fear, had reduced the inhabitants, was by no means the  smallest difficulty to be overcome. Here was realized the great danger  felt by all--that of continued alms-giving, lest they settle down into a  condition of pauperism, and thus finally starve, from the inability of  the world at large to feed them. The presence of a strange body of  friendly working people, coming thousands of miles to help them,  awakened a hope and stimulated the desire to help themselves.    It was a new experience that these strangers _dared_ to come to them.  Although the aforetime home lay a heap of stone and sand, and nothing  belonging to it remained, still the land was there, and when seed to  plant the ground and the farming utensils and cattle were brought to  work it with, the faint spirit revived, the weak, hopeless hands  unclasped, and the farmer stood on his feet again.    When the cities could no longer provide the spades, hoes, plows, picks  and shovels, and the crude iron and steel to make these was purchased  and taken to them, the blacksmith found again his fire and forge and  traveled weary miles with his bellows on his back. The carpenter again  swung his hammer and drew his saw. The broken and scattered  spinning-wheels and looms from under the storms and _debris_ of winter  again took form and"]]]
