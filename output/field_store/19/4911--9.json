I am a fool, and I know I am, and nobody but a fool would  have started such a row,\"--as all this happened, Patrick Crehore came  back for his little sister's orange which he had wrapped in her  handkerchief and left on one of the book-racks in the room. Patrick was  alone now, and was therefore sheepish enough, and got himself and his  orange out of the room as soon as he well could. But he was sharp enough  to note the whole position, and keen enough to catch Alice's words as  she spoke to Mr. Flagg. Indeed, the general look of disappointment and  chagrin in the room, and the contrast between this filthy ruin and the  pretty elegance of half an hour ago, were distinct enough to be  observed by a much more stupid boy than Patrick Crehore. He went down  stairs and found Bridget waiting, and walked home with the little  toddler, meditating rather more than was his wont on Alice's phrase, \"I  tell you, I am a fool.\" Meditating on it, he hauled Bridget up five  flights of stairs and broke in on the little room where a table spread  with a plentiful supply of tea, baker's bread, butter, cheese, and  cabbage, waited their return. Jerry Crehore, his father, sat smoking,  and his mother was tidying up the room.    \"And had ye a good time, me darling? And ye 've brought home your  orange, and a doll too, and mittens too. And what did you have, Pat?\"    So Pat explained, almost sulkily, that he had a checker-board, and a set  of checker-men, which he produced; but he put them by as if he hated the  sight of them, and for a minute dropped the subject, while he helped  little Biddy to cabbage. He ate something himself, drank some tea, and  then delivered his rage with much unction, a little profanity, great  incoherency,--but to his own relief.    \"It's a mean thing it is, all of it,\" said he, \"I'll be hanged but it  is! I dunno who the lady is; but we've made her cry bad, I know that;  and the boys acted like Nick. They knew that as well as I do. The man  there had to knock one of the fellows down, bedad, and served him right,  too. I say, the fellows fought, and hollared, and stole, and sure ye 'd  thought ye was driving pigs down the Eighth Avenue, and I was as bad as  the worst of 'em. That's what the boys did when a lady asked 'em to  Christmas.\"    \"That was a mean thing to do,\" said Jerry, taking his pipe from his  mouth for a longer speech than he had ever been known to make while  smoking.    Mrs. Crehore stopped in her dish-wiping, sat down, and gave her opinion.  She did not know what a Christmas-tree was, having never seed one nor  heared of one. But she did know that those who went to see a lady should  show manners and behave like jintlemen, or not go at all. She expressed  her conviction that Tom Mulligan was rightly served, and her regret that  he had not two black eyes instead of one. She would have been glad,  indeed, if certain Floyds, and Sullivans, and Flahertys with whose  names of baptism she was better acquainted than I am, had shared a  similar fate.    This oration, and the oracle of his father still more, appeased Pat  somewhat; and when his supper was finished, after long silence, he said,  \"We'll give her a Christmas present. We will. Tom Mulligan and Bill  Floyd and I will give it. The others sha'n't know. I know what we'll  give her. I'll tell Bill Floyd that we made her cry.\"      CHAPTER III.    After supper, accordingly, Pat Crehore repaired to certain rendezvous of  the younger life of the neighborhood, known to him, in search of Bill  Floyd. Bill was not at the first, nor at the second, there being indeed  no rule or principle known to men or even to archangels by which Bill's  presence at any particular spot at any particular time could be  definitely stated. But Bill also, in his proud free-will, obeyed certain  general laws; and accordingly Pat found him inspecting, as a volunteer  officer of police, the hauling out and oiling of certain hose at the  house of a neighboring hose company. \"Come here, Bill. I got something  to show you.\"    Bill had already carried home and put in safe keeping a copy of  Routledge's \"Robinson Crusoe,\" which had been given to him.    He left the hose inspection willingly, and hurried along with Pat, past  many attractive groups, not even stopping where a brewer's horse had  fallen on the ground, till Pat brought him in triumph to the gaudy  window of a shoe-shop, lighted up gayly and full of the wares by which  even shoe-shops lure in customers for Christmas.    \"See there!\" said Pat, nearly breathless. And he pointed to the very  centre of the display, a pair of slippers made from bronze-gilt kid, and  displaying a hideous blue silk bow upon the gilding. For what class of  dancers or of maskers these slippers may have been made, or by what  canon of beauty, I know not. Only they were the centre of decoration in  the shoe-shop window. Pat looked at them with admiration, as he had  often done, and said again to Bill Floyd, \"See there, ain't them  handsome?\"    \"Golly!\" said Bill, \"I guess so.\"    \"Bill, let's buy them little shoes, and give 'em to her.\"    \"Give 'em to who?\" said Bill, from whose mind the Christmas-tree had for  the moment faded, under the rivalry of the hose company, the brewer's  horse, and the shop window. \"Give 'em to who?\"    \"Why, her, I don't know who she is. The gal that made the  what-do-ye-call-it, the tree, you know, and give us the oranges, where  old Purdy was. I say, Bill, it was a mean dirty shame to make such a row  there, when we was bid to a party; and I want to make the gal a present,  for I see her crying, Bill. Crying cos it was such a row.\" Again, I omit  certain profane expressions which did not add any real energy to the  declaration.    \"They is handsome,\" said Bill, meditatingly. \"Ain't the blue ones  handsomest?\"    \"No,\" said Pat, who saw he had gained his lodgment, and that the  carrying his point was now only a matter of time. \"The gould ones is the  ones for me. We'll give 'em to the gal for a Christmas present, you and  I and Tom Mulligan.\"    Bill Floyd did not dissent, being indeed in the habit of going as he  was led, as were most of the \"rebel rout\" with whom he had an hour ago  been acting. He assented entirely to Pat's proposal. By \"Christmas\" both  parties understood that the present was to be made before Twelfth Night,  not necessarily on Christmas day. Neither of them had a penny; but both  of them knew, perfectly well, that whenever they chose to get a little  money they could do so.    They soon solved their first question, as to the cost of the coveted  slippers. True, they knew, of course, that they would be ejected from  the decent shop if they went in to inquire. But, by lying in wait, they  soon discovered Delia Sullivan, a decent-looking girl they knew, passing  by, and having made her their confidant, so far that she was sure she  was not fooled, they sent her in to inquire. The girl returned to  announce, to the astonishment of all parties, that the shoes cost six  dollars.    \"Hew!\" cried Pat, \"six dollars for them are! I bought my mother's new  over-shoes for one.\" But not the least did he 'bate of his  determination, and he and Bill Floyd went in search of Tom Mulligan.    Tom was found as easily as Bill. But it was not so easy to enlist him.  Tom was in a regular corner liquor store with men who were sitting  smoking, drinking, and telling dirty stories. Either of the other boys  would have been whipped at home if he had been known to be seen sitting  in this place, and the punishment would have been well bestowed. But Tom  Mulligan had had nobody thrash him for many a day till John Flagg had  struck out so smartly from the shoulder. Perhaps, had there been some  thrashing as discriminating as Jerry Flaherty's, it had been better for  Tom Mulligan. The boys found him easily enough, but, as I said, had some  difficulty in getting him away. With many assurances, however, that they  had something to tell him, and something to show him, they lured him  from the shadow of the comfortable stove into the night.    Pat Crehore, who had more of the tact of oratory than he knew, then  boldly told Tom Mulligan the story of the Christmas-tree, as it passed  after Tom's ejection. Tom was sour at first, but soon warmed to the  narrative, and even showed indignation at the behavior of boys who had  seemed to carry themselves less obnoxiously than he did. All the boys  agreed, that but for certain others who had never been asked to come,  and ought to be ashamed to be there with them as were, there would have  been no row. They all agreed that on some suitable occasion unknown to  me and to this story they would take vengeance on these Tidds and  Sullivans. When Pat Crehore wound up his statement, by telling how he  saw the ladies crying, and all the pretty room looking like a pig-sty,  Tom Mulligan was as loud as he was in saying that it was all wrong, and  that nobody but blackguards would have joined in it, in particular such  blackguards as the Tidds and Sullivans above alluded to.    Then to Tom's sympathizing ear was confided the project of the gold  shoes, as the slippers were always called, in this honorable company.  And Tom completely approved. He even approved the price. He explained to  the others that it would be mean to give to a lady any thing of less  price. This was exactly the sum which recommended itself to his better  judgment. And so the boys went home, agreeing to meet Christmas morning  as a Committee of Ways and Means.    To the discussions of this committee I need not admit you. Many plans  were proposed: one that they should serve through the holidays at  certain ten-pin alleys, known to them; one that they should buy off  Fogarty from his newspaper route for a few days. But the decision was,  that Pat, the most decent in appearance, should dress up in a certain  Sunday"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32505"],[0,"The Systematics of the Frogs of the Hyla Rubra Group in Middle America (#12)"],[1,"of  the savanna region of Central Peten, Guatemala.
