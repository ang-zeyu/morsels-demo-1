They concur in the policy of her Majesty's Government of exhausting all  peaceful means to obtain redress of the grievances of the Uitlanders and  authoritatively assert the supremacy of Great Britain before resorting  to war; but they state that this is a question of defensive precaution,  not of making war.'    In answer to these and other remonstrances the garrison of Natal was  gradually increased, partly by troops from Europe, and partly by the  dispatch of five thousand British troops from India. The 2nd Berkshires,  the 1st Royal Munster Fusiliers, the 1st Manchesters, and the 2nd Dublin  Fusiliers arrived in succession with reinforcements of artillery. The  5th Dragoon Guards, 9th Lancers, and 19th Hussars came from India, with  the 1st Devonshires, 1st Gloucesters, 2nd King's Royal Rifles and 2nd  Gordon Highlanders. These with the 21st, 42nd, and 53rd batteries of  Field Artillery made up the Indian Contingent. Their arrival late in  September raised the number of troops in South Africa to 22,000, a force  which was inadequate to a contest in the open field with the numerous,  mobile, and gallant enemy to whom they were to be opposed, but which  proved to be strong enough to stave off that overwhelming disaster  which, with our fuller knowledge, we can now see to have been impending.    As to the disposition of these troops a difference of opinion broke out  between the ruling powers in Natal and the military chiefs at the spot.  Prince Kraft has said, 'Both strategy and tactics may have to yield to  politics '; but the political necessity should be very grave and very  clear when it is the blood of soldiers which has to pay for it. Whether  it arose from our defective intelligence, or from that caste feeling  which makes it hard for the professional soldier to recognise (in spite  of deplorable past experiences) a serious adversary in the mounted  farmer, it is certain that even while our papers were proclaiming that  this time, at least, we would not underrate our enemy, we were most  seriously underrating him. The northern third of Natal is as vulnerable  a military position as a player of kriegspiel could wish to have  submitted to him. It runs up into a thin angle, culminating at the apex  in a difficult pass, the ill-omened Laing's Nek, dominated by the  even more sinister bulk of Majuba. Each side of this angle is open to  invasion, the one from the Transvaal and the other from the Orange Free  State. A force up at the apex is in a perfect trap, for the mobile  enemy can flood into the country to the south of them, cut the line  of supplies, and throw up a series of entrenchments which would make  retreat a very difficult matter. Further down the country, at such  positions as Ladysmith or Dundee, the danger, though not so imminent,  is still an obvious one, unless the defending force is strong enough to  hold its own in the open field and mobile enough to prevent a mounted  enemy from getting round its flanks. To us, who are endowed with that  profound military wisdom which only comes with a knowledge of the event,  it is obvious that with a defending force which could not place more  than 12,000 men in the fighting line, the true defensible frontier was  the line of the Tugela. As a matter of fact, Ladysmith was chosen, a  place almost indefensible itself, as it is dominated by high hills in at  least two directions.    Such an event as the siege of the town appears never to have been  contemplated, as no guns of position were asked for or sent. In spite  of this, an amount of stores, which is said to have been valued at  more than a million of pounds, was dumped down at this small railway  junction, so that the position could not be evacuated without a  crippling loss. The place was the point of bifurcation of the main line,  which divides at this little town into one branch running to Harrismith  in the Orange Free State, and the other leading through the Dundee coal  fields and Newcastle to the Laing's Nek tunnel and the Transvaal. An  importance, which appears now to have been an exaggerated one, was  attached by the Government of Natal to the possession of the coal  fields, and it was at their strong suggestion, but with the concurrence  of General Penn Symons, that the defending force was divided, and a  detachment of between three and four thousand sent to Dundee, about  forty miles from the main body, which remained under General Sir George  White at Ladysmith. General Symons underrated the power of the invaders,  but it is hard to criticise an error of judgment which has been so  nobly atoned and so tragically paid for. At the time, then, which our  political narrative has reached, the time of suspense which followed the  dispatch of the Cabinet message of September 8th, the military situation  had ceased to be desperate, but was still precarious. Twenty-two  thousand regular troops were on the spot who might hope to be reinforced  by some ten thousand colonials, but these forces had to cover a great  frontier, the attitude of Cape Colony was by no means whole-hearted and  might become hostile, while the black population might conceivably throw  in its weight against us. Only half the regulars could be spared to  defend Natal, and no reinforcements could reach them in less than a  month from the outbreak of hostilities. If Mr. Chamberlain was really  playing a game of bluff, it must be confessed that he was bluffing from  a very weak hand.    For purposes of comparison we may give some idea of the forces which  Mr. Kruger and Mr. Steyn could put in the field, for by this time it was  evident that the Orange Free State, with which we had had no shadow of  a dispute, was going, in a way which some would call wanton and some  chivalrous, to throw in its weight against us. The general press  estimate of the forces of the two republics varied from 25,000 to 35,000  men. Mr. J. B. Robinson, a personal friend of President Kruger's and  a man who had spent much of his life among the Boers, considered the  latter estimate to be too high. The calculation had no assured basis to  start from. A very scattered and isolated population, among whom large  families were the rule, is a most difficult thing to estimate. Some  reckoned from the supposed natural increase during eighteen years, but  the figure given at that date was itself an assumption. Others took  their calculation from the number of voters in the last presidential  election: but no one could tell how many abstentions there had been,  and the fighting age is five years earlier than the voting age in the  republics. We recognise now that all calculations were far below the  true figure. It is probable, however, that the information of the  British Intelligence Department was not far wrong. According to this  the fighting strength of the Transvaal alone was 32,000 men, and of the  Orange Free State 22,000. With mercenaries and rebels from the colonies  they would amount to 60, 000, while a considerable rising of the Cape  Dutch would bring them up to 100,000. In artillery they were known to  have about a hundred guns, many of them (and the fact will need much  explaining) more modern and powerful than any which we could bring  against them. Of the quality of this large force there is no need to  speak. The men were brave, hardy, and fired with a strange religious  enthusiasm. They were all of the seventeenth century, except their  rifles. Mounted upon their hardy little ponies, they possessed a  mobility which practically doubled their numbers and made it an  impossibility ever to outflank them. As marksmen they were supreme. Add  to this that they had the advantage of acting upon internal lines with  shorter and safer communications, and one gathers how formidable a  task lay before the soldiers of the empire. When we turn from such an  enumeration of their strength to contemplate the 12,000 men, split into  two detachments, who awaited them in Natal, we may recognise that, far  from bewailing our disasters, we should rather congratulate ourselves  upon our escape from losing that great province which, situated as it  is between Britain, India, and Australia, must be regarded as the very  keystone of the imperial arch.    At the risk of a tedious but very essential digression, something must  be said here as to the motives with which the Boers had for many years  been quietly preparing for war. That the Jameson raid was not the cause  is certain, though it probably, by putting the Boer Government into a  strong position, had a great effect in accelerating matters. What had  been done secretly and slowly could be done more swiftly and openly when  so plausible an excuse could be given for it. As a matter of fact, the  preparations were long antecedent to the raid. The building of the forts  at Pretoria and Johannesburg was begun nearly two years before that  wretched incursion, and the importation of arms was going on apace.  In that very year, 1895, a considerable sum was spent in military  equipment.    But if it was not the raid, and if the Boers had no reason to fear the  British Government, with whom the Transvaal might have been as friendly  as the Orange Free State had been for forty years, why then should they  arm? It was a difficult question, and one in answering which we find  ourselves in a region of conjecture and suspicion rather than of  ascertained fact. But the fairest and most unbiased of historians must  confess that there is a large body of evidence to show that into the  heads of some of the Dutch leaders, both in the northern republics  and in the Cape, there had entered the conception of a single Dutch  commonwealth, extending from Cape Town to the Zambesi, in which flag,  speech, and law should all be Dutch. It is in this aspiration that  many shrewd and well-"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30691"],[0,"Astounding Stories of Super-Science, December 1930 (#12)"],[1,"and joked about before. That  man, too, had claimed to have travelled far from the earth; he had  invented a machine; his name--    The pointer was swinging in frenzied haste to spell over and over the  name of a man, and the name, too, of a forgotten place in the mountains  of Nevada. It was repeating the message; then finished in one long  crashing wail as a cloud of vapor shot about McGuire and his hand upon  the pointer went suddenly limp.      CHAPTER XI    Captain Blake's game of solitaire had become an obsession. He drove  himself to the utmost in the line of duty, and, through the day, the  demands of the flying field filled his mind to forgetfulness. And for  the rest, he forced his mind to concentrate upon the turn of the cards.  He could not read--and he must not think!--so he sat through long  evenings trying vainly to forget.    He looked up with an expressionless face as Colonel Boynton entered the  room. The colonel saw the cards and nodded.    \"Does that help?\" he asked, and added without waiting for an answer, \"I  don't like cards, but I find my mathematics works well.... My old  problems--I can concentrate on them, and stop this eternal, damnable  thinking, thinking--\"    There was something of the same look forming about the eyes of  both--that look that told of men who struggled gamely under the sentence  of death, refusing to think or to fear, and waiting, waiting,  impotently. Blake looked at the colonel with a carefully emotionless  gaze. \"It's hell in the big towns, I hear.\"    The Colonel nodded. \"Can't blame them much, if that's what appeals to  them. A year and a half!--and they've got to forget it. Why not crowd  all the recklessness and excesses they can into the time that is  left?--poor devils! But for the most part the world is wagging along,  and people are going through the familiar motions.\"    \"Well,\" said Blake, \"I used to wonder at times how a man might feel if  he were facing execution. Now we all know. Just going dumbly along,  feeling as little as we can, thinking of anything, everything--except  the one thing. They've turned to using dope, a lot of them, I hear.  Maybe it helps; nobody cares much. Only a year and a half.\"           *       *       *       *       *    He raised his face from which all expression was consciously erased.  \"Any possible hope?\" he asked. \"Or do we take it when it comes and fight  with what we've got as long as we can? There was some talk in the papers  of an invention--Bureau of Standards cooperating with the big General  Committee to investigate. Anything come of it?\"    \"A thousand of them,\" said the colonel, \"all futile. No, we can't expect  much from those things. Though there's a whisper that came to me from  Washington. General Clinton--you may remember him; he was here when the  thing first broke--says that some scientist, a real one, not another of  these half-baked geniuses, has worked out a transformation of some kind.  It was too deep for me, but it is based upon changing hydrogen into  helium, I think. Liberates some perfectly tremendous amount of power.  The general had it all down pat--\"    He stopped speaking at the change in Captain Blake's face. The careful  repression of all emotions was gone; the face was suddenly alive--    \"I know,\" he said sharply; \"I remember something of the theory. There is  a difference in the atoms or their protons--the liberation of an  electron from each atom--matter actually transformed into energy;  theoretical, what I have read. But--but--Oh my God, Boynton, do you mean  that they've got it?--that it will drive us through space?\"           *       *       *       *       *    The colonel drove one fist into the palm of his other hand. \"Fool!  Idiot!\" he exclaimed, and it was evident that the epithets were intended  for himself.    \"I had forgotten that you had been trained along that line. The general  wants a man to work with them, somewhat as a liason officer to link the  army requirements closely with their developments; we are hoping to work  out a space ship, of course. You are just the man; I will radio him this  minute. Be ready to leave--\" The slamming of the door marked a hurried  exit toward the radio room.    And abruptly, stifflingly, Captain Blake dared to hope. \"Scientists will  come through with something, some new method of propulsion. All the  world is looking to them!\" His thoughts were leaping from one  possibility to another. \"Some miracle of power that will drive a fleet  through space as they have done, to battle with the enemy on his own  ground--\"    Could he help? Was there one little thing that he could do to apply  their knowledge to practical ends? The thought thrilled him with  overpowering emotion an hour later as he felt the lift of the plane  beneath him.    \"Report to General Clinton,\" the colonel's reply had said. \"Captain  Blake will be assigned to special duty.\" He opened the throttle to his  ship's best cruising speed, but his spirit was soaring ahead to urge on  the swift scout ship whose wings drove steadily into the gathering  dusk.           *       *       *       *       *    And then, after long hours, Washington! Brief words with many men--and  discouragement! The seat of government of the United States was a city  of despondent men, weary, hopeless, but fighting. There was a look of  strain on every face; the eyes told a story of sleepless nights and  futile thinking and planning. Blake's elation was short lived.    He was sent to New York and on into the state, where the laboratories of  a great electrical company had turned their equipment from commercial  purposes to those of war. Here, surely, one might find fuel to feed the  dying embers of hope; the new development must give greater promise than  General Clinton had intimated.    \"Nothing you can do as yet,\" he was told, when he had stated his  mission. \"It is still experimental, but we have worked out the  transformation on a small scale, and harnessed the power.\"    Captain Blake was in no mood for temporizing; he was tired with being  put off. He stared belligerently at the chief of this department.    \"Power--hell!\" he said. \"We've got power now. How will you apply it? How  will we use it for travelling through space?\"    The great man of science was unmoved by the outburst. \"That is  poppycock,\" he replied; \"the unscientific twaddle of the sensational  press. We are practical men here; we are working to give you men who do  the fighting better ships and better arms. But you will use them right  here on Earth.\"    The calm assurance of this man who spoke with a voice of such confidence  and authority left the flyer speechless. His brain sent a chaos of  profane and violent expletives to the lips that dared not frame them.  There was no adequate reply.           *       *       *       *       *    Blake jammed his hat upon his head and walked blindly from the room.  Heedless of the protests of those he jostled on the street he went  raging on, but some subconscious urge directed his steps. He found  himself at the railway. There was a station, and a grilled window where  he was asking for a ticket back to Washington. And on the following  day--    \"There is nothing I can do,\" he told General Clinton. \"It is hopeless. I  ask to be relieved.\"    \"Why?\" The general snapped the question at him. What kind of man was  this that Boynton had sent him?    \"They are fools,\" said Blake bluntly, \"pompous, well-meaning fools! They  are planning better motors, more power\"--he laughed harshly--\"and they  think that with them we can attack ships that are independent of the  air.\"    \"Still,\" asked General Clinton coldly, \"for what purpose do you wish to  be relieved? What do you intend to do?\"    \"Return to the field,\" said Captain Blake, \"to work, and put my planes  and personnel in the best possible condition; then, when the time comes,  go up and fight like hell.\"    An unusual phrasing of a request when one is addressing one's commander;  but the older man threw back his shoulders, that were bending under  responsibilities too great for one man to bear, and took a long breath  that relaxed his face and seemed to bring relief.    \"You've got the right idea,\"--he spoke slowly and thoughtfully--\"the  right philosophy. It is all we have left--to fight like hell when the  time comes. Give my regards to Colonel Boynton; he sent me a good man  after all.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Another long flight, westward this time, and, despite the failure of his  hopes and of his errand, Blake was flying with a mind at peace. \"It is  all we have left,\" the general had said. Well, it was good to face  facts, to admit them--and that was that! There was no use of thinking or  worrying.... He lifted the ship to a higher level and glanced at his  compass. There were clouds up ahead, and he drove still higher into the  night, until he was above them.    And again his peace of mind was not to last.    It was night when he swung the ship over his home port and signalled for  a landing. A flood of light swept out across the field to guide him  down. He went directly to the colonel's quarters but found him gone.    \"In the radio room, I think,\" an orderly told him.    Colonel Boynton was listening intently in the silent room; he scowled  with annoyance at the disturbance of Blake's coming; then, seeing who it  was, he motioned quickly for the captain to listen in.    \"Good Lord, Blake,\" he told the captain in an excited whisper; \"I'm glad  you're here. Another ship had been sighted; she's been all over the  earth; just scouting and mapping, probably. And there have been signals  the same as before--the same until just now. Listen!--it's talking  Morse!--it's been calling for you!\"    He thrust a head set into Blake's hands, then reached for some papers.  \"Poor reception, but there's what we've got,\" he said.           *       *       *       *       *    The paper held the merest fragments of"]]]
