[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3535"],[0,"A Narrative of the Expedition to Botany-Bay (#12)"],[1," last moments of my life, to bid you an eternal adieu! my doom being  irrevocably fixed, and ere this hour to-morrow I shall have quitted this  vale of wretchedness, to enter into an unknown and endless eternity. I  will not distress your tender maternal feelings by any long comment on  the cause of my present misfortune. Let it therefore suffice to say,  that impelled by that strong propensity to evil, which neither the  virtuous precepts nor example of the best of parents could eradicate, I  have at length fallen an unhappy, though just, victim to my own follies.    \"Too late I regret my inattention to your admonitions, and feel myself  sensibly affected by the remembrance of the many anxious moments you  have passed on my account. For these, and all my other transgressions,  however great, I supplicate the Divine forgiveness; and encouraged by  the promises of that Saviour who died for us all, I trust to receive  that mercy in the world to come, which my offences have deprived me of  all hope, or expectation of, in this. The affliction which this will  cost you, I hope the Almighty will enable you to bear. Banish from your  memory all my former indiscretions, and let the cheering hope of a happy  meeting hereafter, console you for my loss. Sincerely penitent for my  sins; sensible of the justice of my conviction and sentence, and firmly  relying on the merits of a Blessed Redeemer, I am at perfect peace with  all mankind, and trust I shall yet experience that peace, which this  world cannot give. Commend my soul to the Divine mercy. I bid you an  eternal farewell.    \"Your unhappy dying Son,    \"SAMUEL PEYTON.\"      After this nothing occurred with which I think it necessary to trouble  the reader. The contents of the following chapters could not, I  conceive, be so properly interwoven in the body of the work; I have,  therefore, assigned them a place by themselves, with a view that the  conclusions adopted in them may be more strongly enforced on the minds  of those, to whom they are more particularly addressed.          CHAPTER XV.        The Face of the Country; its Productions, Climate, &c.      To the geographical knowledge of this country, supplied by Captain Cook,  and Captain Furneaux, we are able to add nothing. The latter explored  the coast from Van Diemen's land to the latitude of 39 deg south;  and Cook from Point Hicks, which lies in 37 deg 58 min, to Endeavour  Streights. The intermediate space between the end of Furneaux's  discovery and Point Hicks, is, therefore, the only part of the  south-east coast unknown, and it so happened on our passage thither,  owing to the weather, which forbade any part of the ships engaging with  the shore, that we are unable to pronounce whether, or not, a streight  intersects the continent hereabouts: though I beg leave to say, that I  have been informed by a naval friend, that when the fleet was off this  part of the coast, a strong set-off shore was plainly felt.    At the distance of 60 miles inland, a prodigious chain of lofty  mountains runs nearly in a north and south direction, further than the  eye can trace them. Should nothing intervene to prevent it, the Governor  intends, shortly, to explore their summits: and, I think there can be  little doubt, that his curiosity will not go unrewarded. If large rivers  do exist in the country, which some of us are almost sceptical enough  to doubt, their sources must arise amidst these hills; and the direction  they run in, for a considerable distance, must be either due north, or  due south. For it is strikingly singular that three such noble harbours  as Botany Bay, Port Jackson, and Broken Bay, alike end in shallows and  swamps, filled with mangroves.    The general face of the country is certainly pleasing, being diversified  with gentle ascents, and little winding vallies, covered for the most  part with large spreading trees, which afford a succession of leaves  in all seasons. In those places where trees are scarce, a variety of  flowering shrubs abound, most of them entirely new to an European,  and surpassing in beauty, fragrance, and number, all I ever saw in an  uncultivated state: among these, a tall shrub, bearing an elegant white  flower, which smells like English May, is particularly delightful, and  perfumes the air around to a great distance. The species of trees are  few, and, I am concerned to add, the wood universally of so bad a grain,  as almost to preclude a possibility of using it: the increase of labour  occasioned by this in our buildings has been such, as nearly to exceed  belief. These trees yield a profusion of thick red gum (not unlike the  'sanguis draconis') which is found serviceable in medicine, particularly  in dysenteric complaints, where it has sometimes succeeded, when all  other preparations have failed. To blunt its acrid qualities, it is  usual to combine it with opiates.    The nature of the soil is various. That immediately round Sydney Cove is  sandy, with here and there a stratum of clay. From the sand we have yet  been able to draw very little; but there seems no reason to doubt, that  many large tracts of land around us will bring to perfection whatever  shall be sown in them. To give this matter a fair trial, some practical  farmers capable of such an undertaking should be sent out; for the spots  we have chosen for experiments in agriculture, in which we can scarce  be supposed adepts, have hitherto but ill repaid our toil, which may be  imputable to our having chosen such as are unfavourable for our purpose.    Except from the size of the trees, the difficulties of clearing the land  are not numerous, underwood being rarely found, though the country  is not absolutely without it. Of the natural meadows which Mr. Cook  mentions near Botany Bay, we can give no account; none such exist about  Port Jackson. Grass, however, grows in every place but the swamps with  the greatest vigour and luxuriancy, though it is not of the finest  quality, and is found to agree better with horses and cows than sheep. A  few wild fruits are sometimes procured, among which is the small purple  apple mentioned by Cook, and a fruit which has the appearance of a  grape, though in taste more like a green gooseberry, being excessively  sour: probably were it meliorated by cultivation, it would become more  palatable.    Fresh water, as I have said before, is found but in inconsiderable  quantities. For the common purposes of life there is generally enough;  but we know of no stream in the country capable of turning a mill: and  the remark made by Mr. Anderson, of the dryness of the country round  Adventure Bay, extends without exception to every part of it which we  have penetrated.    Previous to leaving England I remember to have frequently heard it  asserted, that the discovery of mines was one of the secondary objects  of the expedition. Perhaps there are mines; but as no person competent  to form a decision is to be found among us, I wish no one to adopt an  idea, that I mean to impress him with such a belief, when I state, that  individuals, whose judgements are not despicable, are willing to think  favourably of this conjecture, from specimens of ore seen in many of the  stones picked up here. I cannot quit this subject without regretting,  that some one capable of throwing a better light on it, is not in the  colony. Nor can I help being equally concerned, that an experienced  botanist was not sent out, for the purpose of collecting and describing  the rare and beautiful plants with which the country abounds. Indeed,  we flattered ourselves, when at the Cape of Good Hope, that Mason, the  King's botanical gardener, who was employed there in collecting for the  royal nursery at Kew, would have joined us, but it seems his orders and  engagements prevented him from quitting that beaten track, to enter on  this scene of novelty and variety.    To the naturalist this country holds out many invitations. Birds, though  not remarkably numerous, are in great variety, and of the most exquisite  beauty of plumage, among which are the cockatoo, lory, and parroquet;  but the bird which principally claims attention is, a species of  ostrich, approaching nearer to the emu of South America than any other  we know of. One of them was shot, at a considerable distance, with a  single ball, by a convict employed for that purpose by the Governor; its  weight, when complete, was seventy pounds, and its length from the end  of the toe to the tip of the beak, seven feet two inches, though there  was reason to believe it had not attained its full growth. On dissection  many anatomical singularities were observed: the gall-bladder was  remarkably large, the liver not bigger than that of a barn-door fowl,  and after the strictest search no gizzard could be found; the legs,  which were of a vast length, were covered with thick, strong scales,  plainly indicating the animal to be formed for living amidst deserts;  and the foot differed from an ostrich's by forming a triangle, instead  of being cloven.    Goldsmith, whose account of the emu is the only one I can refer to,  says, \"that it is covered from the back and rump with long feathers,  which fall backward, and cover the anus; these feathers are grey on  the back, and white on the belly.\" The wings are so small as hardly to  deserve the name, and are unfurnished with those beautiful ornaments  which adorn the wings of the ostrich: all the feathers are extremely  coarse, but the construction of them deserves notice--they grow in pairs  from a single shaft, a singularity which the author I have quoted has  omitted to remark. It may be presumed, that these birds are not very  scarce, as several have been seen, some of them immensely large, but  they are so wild, as to make shooting them a matter of great difficulty.  Though incapable of flying, they run with such swiftness, that our  fleetest greyhounds are left far behind in every attempt to catch them."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3536"],[0,"The Enchanted Castle (#12)"],[1,"twisted ivy that clung to the wall, he  looked back over the grey slope there was a splashing at the  fish-pool that had mirrored the stars the shape of the great stone  beast was wallowing in the shallows among the lily-pads.    Once inside the room, Gerald turned for another look. The  fish-pond lay still and dark, reflecting the moon. Through a gap in  the drooping willow the moonlight fell on a statue that stood calm  and motionless on its pedestal. Everything was in its place now in  the garden. Nothing moved or stirred.    \"How extraordinarily rum!\" said Gerald. \"I shouldn't have thought  you could go to sleep walking through a garden and dream like  that.\"    He shut the window, lit a match, and closed the shutters. Another  match showed him the door. He turned the key, went out, locked  the door again, hung the key on its usual nail, and crept to the end  of the passage. Here he waited, safe in his invisibility, till the  dazzle of the matches should have gone from his eyes, and he be  once more able to find his way by the moonlight that fell in bright  patches on the floor through the barred, unshuttered windows of  the hall.    \"Wonder where the kitchen is,\" said Gerald. He had quite forgotten  that he was a detective. He was only anxious to get home and tell  the others about that extraordinarily odd dream that he had had in  the gardens. \"I suppose it doesn't matter what doors I open. I'm  invisible all right still, I suppose? Yes; can't see my hand before  my face.\" He held up a hand for the purpose. \"Here goes!\"    He opened many doors, wandered into long rooms with furniture  dressed in brown holland covers that looked white in that strange  light, rooms with chandeliers hanging in big bags from the high  ceilings, rooms whose walls were alive with pictures, rooms whose  walls were deadened with rows on rows of old books, state  bedrooms in whose great plumed four-posters Queen Elizabeth  had no doubt slept. (That Queen, by the way, must have been very  little at home, for she seems to have slept in every old house in  England.) But he could not find the kitchen. At last a door opened  on stone steps that went up there was a narrow stone passage steps  that went down a door with a light under it. It was, somehow,  difficult to put out one's hand to that door and open it.    \"Nonsense!\" Gerald told himself, \"don't be an ass! Are you  invisible, or aren't you?\"    Then he opened the door, and someone inside said something in a  sudden rough growl.    Gerald stood back, flattened against the wall, as a man sprang to  the doorway and flashed a lantern into the passage.    \"All right,\" said the man, with almost a sob of relief. \"It was only  the door swung open, it's that heavy that's all.\"    \"Blow the door!\" said another growling voice; \"blessed if I didn't  think it was a fair cop that time.\"    They closed the door again. Gerald did not mind. In fact, he rather  preferred that it should be so. He didn't like the look of those men.  There was an air of threat about them. In their presence even  invisibility seemed too thin a disguise. And Gerald had seen as  much as he wanted to see. He had seen that he had been right  about the gang. By wonderful luck  beginner's luck, a card-player  would have told him he had discovered a burglary on the very first  night of his detective career. The men were taking silver out of  two great chests, wrapping it in rags, and packing it in baize sacks.  The door of the room was of iron six inches thick. It was, in fact,  the strong-room, and these men had picked the lock. The tools they  had done it with lay on the floor, on a neat cloth roll, such as  wood-carvers keep their chisels in.    \"Hurry up!\" Gerald heard. \"You needn't take all night over it.\"    The silver rattled slightly. \"You're a rattling of them trays like  bloomin' castanets,\" said the gruffest voice. Gerald turned and  went away, very carefully and very quickly. And it is a most  curious thing that, though he couldn't find the way to the servants  wing when he had nothing else to think of, yet now, with his mind  full, so to speak, of silver forks and silver cups, and the question of  who might be coming after him down those twisting passages, he  went straight as an arrow to the door that led from the hall to the  place he wanted to get to.    As he went the happenings took words in his mind.    \"The fortunate detective,\" he told himself, \"having succeeded  beyond his wildest dreams, himself left the spot in search of  assistance.\"    But what assistance? There were, no doubt, men in the house, also  the aunt; but he could not warn them.    He was too hopelessly invisible to carry any weight with strangers.  The assistance of Mabel would not be of much value. The police?  Before they could be got and the getting of them presented  difficulties the burglars would have cleared away with their sacks  of silver.    Gerald stopped and thought hard; he held his head with both hands  to do it. You know the way the same as you sometimes do for  simple equations or the dates of the battles of the Civil War.    Then with pencil, note-book, a window-ledge, and all the  cleverness he could find at the moment, he wrote: \"You know the  room where the silver is. Burglars are burgling it, the thick door is  picked. Send a man for police. I will follow the burglars if they get  away ere police arrive on the spot.\"    He hesitated a moment, and ended \"From a Friend this is not a  sell.\"    This letter, tied tightly round a stone by means of a shoelace,  thundered through the window of the room where Mabel and her  aunt, in the ardour of reunion, were enjoying a supper of unusual  charm stewed plums, cream, sponge-cakes, custard in cups, and  cold bread-and-butter pudding.    Gerald, in hungry invisibility, looked wistfully at the supper before  he threw the stone. He waited till the shrieks had died away, saw  the stone picked up, the warning letter read.    \"Nonsense!\" said the aunt, growing calmer. \"How wicked! Of  course it's a hoax.\"    \"Oh! do send for the police, like he says,\" wailed Mabel.    \"Like who says?\" snapped the aunt.    \"Whoever it is,\" Mabel moaned.    \"Send for the police at once,\" said Gerald, outside, in the manliest  voice he could find. \"You'll only blame yourself if you don t. I  can't do any more for you.\"    \"I I'll set the dogs on you!\" cried the aunt.    \"Oh, auntie, don't!\" Mabel was dancing with agitation. \"It's true I  know it's true. Do do wake Bates!\"    \"I don't believe a word of it,\" said the aunt. No more did Bates  when, owing to Mabel's persistent worryings, he was awakened.  But when he had seen the paper, and had to choose whether he'd  go to the strong-room and see that there really wasn't anything to  believe or go for the police on his bicycle, he chose the latter  course.    When the police arrived the strong-room door stood ajar, and the  silver, or as much of it as the three men could carry, was gone.    Gerald's note-book and pencil came into play again later on that  night. It was five in the morning before he crept into bed, tired out  and cold as a stone.    \"Master Gerald!\" it was Eliza's voice in his ears \"it's seven o clock  and another fine day, and there's been another burglary My cats  alive!\" she screamed, as she drew up the blind and turned towards  the bed; \"look at his bed, all crocked with black, and him not  there!\" \"Oh, Jiminy!\" It was a scream this time. Kathleen came  running from her room; Jimmy sat up in his bed and rubbed his  eyes.    \"Whatever is it?\" Kathleen cried.    \"I dunno when I 'ad such a turn. Eliza sat down heavily on a box as  she spoke. \"First thing his bed all empty and black as the chimley  back, and him not in it, and then when I looks again he is in it all  the time. I must be going silly. I thought as much when I heard  them haunting angel voices yesterday morning. But I'll tell  Mamselle of you, my lad, with your tricks, you may rely on that.  Blacking yourself all over and crocking up your clean sheets and  pillow-cases. It's going back of beyond, this is.\"    \"Look here,\" said Gerald slowly; \"I'm going to tell you something.\"    Eliza simply snorted, and that was rude of her; but then, she had  had a shock and had not got over it.    \"Can you keep a secret?\" asked Gerald, very earnest through the  grey of his partly rubbed-off blacklead.    \"Yes,\" said Eliza.    \"Then keep it and I'll give you two bob.\"    \"But what was you going to tell me?\"    \"That. About the two bob and the secret. And you keep your mouth  shut.\"    \"I didn't ought to take it,\" said Eliza, holding out her hand eagerly.  \"Now you get up, and mind you wash all the corners, Master  Gerald.\"    \"Oh, I'm so glad you're safe,\" said Kathleen, when Eliza had gone.    \"You didn't seem to care much last night,\" said Gerald coldly.    \"I can't think how I let you go. I didn't care last night. But when I  woke this morning and remembered!\"    \"There, that'll do it'll come off on you,\" said Gerald through the  reckless hugging of his sister.    \"How did you get visible?\" Jimmy asked.    \"It just happened when she called me the ring came off.\"    \"Tell us all about everything,\" said Kathleen. \"Not yet, said Gerald  mysteriously.    \"Where's the ring?\" Jimmy asked after breakfast. \"I want to have a  try now.\"    \"I I forgot it,\" said Gerald; \"I expect it's in the bed somewhere.    But it wasn't. Eliza had made the bed.    \"I'll swear there ain't no ring there,\" she said. \"I should \"a seen it if  there had'a been.\"    \"Search and research proving vain,\" said Gerald, when every  corner of the bedroom had been turned out and the ring had not  been found, \"the noble detective hero of our tale remarked that he  would have other fish to fry in half a jiff, and if the rest of you  want to hear about last night...\"    \"Let's keep it till we get to Mabel,\" said Kathleen heroically.    \"The assignation was ten-thirty, wasn't it? Why shouldn't Gerald  gas as we go along? I"]]]
