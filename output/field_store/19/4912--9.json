I went down with the end of the wire. Wilma followed a few feet above  me, then Barker, Gaunt and Blash. Gibbons, of course, stayed behind to  hold the ship in position and control the paying out of the line. We all  had our ultrophones in place inside our air helmets, and so could  converse with one another and with Gibbons. But at Wilma's suggestion,  although we would have liked to let the Big Boss listen in, we kept them  adjusted to short-range work, for fear that those who had been clearing  with the Hans, and against whom we were on a raid for evidence, might  also pick up our conversation. We had no fear that the Hans would hear  us. In fact, we had the added advantage that, even after we landed, we  could converse freely without danger of their hearing our voices through  our air helmets.    For a while I could see nothing below but utter darkness. Then I  realized, from the feel of the air as much as from anything, that we  were sinking through a cloud layer. We passed through two more cloud  layers before anything was visible to us.    Then there came under my gaze, about two miles below, one of the most  beautiful sights I have ever seen; the soft, yet brilliant, radiance of  the great Han city of Nu-yok. Every foot of its structural members  seemed to glow with a wonderful incandescence, tower piled up on tower,  and all built on the vast base-mass of the city, which, so I had been  told, sheered upward from the surface of the rivers to a height of 728  levels.    The city, I noticed with some surprise, did not cover anything like the  same area as the New York of the 20th Century. It occupied, as a matter  of fact, only the lower half of Manhattan Island, with one section  straddling the East River, and spreading out sufficiently over what once  had been Brooklyn, to provide berths for the great liners and other air  craft.    Straight beneath my feet was a tiny dark patch. It seemed the only spot  in the entire city that was not aflame with radiance. This was the  central tower, in the top floors of which were housed the vast library  of record files and the main projectoscope plant.    \"You can shoot the wire now,\" I ultrophoned Gibbons, and let go the  little weighted knob. It dropped like a plummet, and we followed with  considerable speed, but braking our descent with gloved hands  sufficiently to see whether the knob, on which a faint light glowed as a  signal for ourselves, might be observed by any Han guard or night  prowler. Apparently it was not, and we again shot down with accelerated  speed.    We landed on the roof of the tower without any mishap, and fortunately  for our plan, in darkness. Since there was nothing above it on which it  would have been worth while to shed illumination, or from which there  was any need to observe it, the Hans had neglected to light the tower  roof, or indeed to occupy it at all. This was the reason we had selected  it as our landing place.    As soon as Gibbons had our word, he extinguished the knob light, and the  knob, as well as the wire, became totally invisible. At our ultrophoned  word, he would light it again.    \"No gun play now,\" I warned. \"Swords only, and then only if absolutely  necessary.\"    Closely bunched, and treading as lightly as only inertron-belted people  could, we made our way cautiously through a door and down an inclined  plane to the floor below, where Gaunt and Blash assured us the military  offices were located.    Twice Barker cautioned us to stop as we were about to pass in front of  mirror-like \"windows\" in the passage wall, and flattening ourselves to  the floor, we crawled past them.    \"Projectoscopes,\" he said. \"Probably on automatic record only, at this  time of night. Still, we don't want to leave any records for them to  study after we're gone.\"    \"Were you ever here before?\" I asked.    \"No,\" he replied, \"but I haven't been studying their electrophone  communications for seven years without being able to recognize these  machines when I run across them.\"          CHAPTER IX    The Fight in the Tower      So far we had not laid eyes on a Han. The tower seemed deserted. Blash  and Gaunt, however, assured me that there would be at least one man on  \"duty\" in the military offices, though he would probably be asleep, and  two or three in the library proper and the projectoscope plant.    \"We've got to put them out of commission,\" I said. \"Did you bring the  'dope' cans, Wilma?\"    \"Yes,\" she said, \"two for each. Here,\" and she distributed them.    We were now two levels below the roof, and at the point where we were to  separate.    I did not want to let Wilma out of my sight, but it was necessary.    According to our plan, Barker was to make his way to the projectoscope  plant, Blash and I to the library, and Wilma and Gaunt to the military  office.    Blash and I traversed a long corridor, and paused at the great arched  doorway of the library. Cautiously we peered in. Seated at three great  switchboards were library operatives. Occasionally one of them would  reach lazily for a lever, or sleepily push a button, as little numbered  lights winked on and off. They were answering calls for electrograph and  viewplate records on all sorts of subjects from all sections of the  city.    I apprised my companions of the situation.    \"Better wait a bit,\" Blash added. \"The calls will lessen shortly.\"    Wilma reported an officer in the military office sound asleep.    \"Give him the can, then,\" I said.    Barker was to do nothing more than keep watch in the projectoscope  plant, and a few moments later he reported himself well concealed, with  a splendid view of the floor.    \"I think we can take a chance now,\" Blash said to me, and at my nod, he  opened the lid of his dope can. Of course, the fumes did not affect us,  through our helmets. They were absolutely without odor or visibility,  and in a few seconds the librarians were unconscious. We stepped into  the room.    There ensued considerable cautious observation and experiment on the  part of Gaunt, working from the military office, and Blash in the  library; while Wilma and I, with drawn swords and sharply attuned  microphones, stood guard, and occasionally patrolled nearby corridors.    \"I hear something approaching,\" Wilma said after a bit, with excitement  in her voice. \"It's a soft, gliding sound.\"    \"That's an elevator somewhere,\" Barker cut in from the projectoscope  floor. \"Can you locate it? I can't hear it.\"    \"It's to the east of me,\" she replied.    \"And to my west,\" said I, faintly catching it. \"It's between us, Wilma,  and nearer you than me. Be careful. Have you got any information yet,  Blash and Gaunt?\"    \"Getting it now,\" one of them replied. \"Give us two minutes more.\"    \"Keep at it then,\" I said. \"We'll guard.\"    The soft, gliding sound ceased.    \"I think it's very close to me,\" Wilma almost whispered. \"Come closer,  Tony. I have a feeling something is going to happen. I've never known my  nerves to get taut like this without reason.\"    In some alarm, I launched myself down the corridor in a great leap  toward the intersection whence I knew I could see her.    In the middle of my leap my ultrophone registered her gasp of alarm. The  next instant I glided to a stop at the intersection to see Wilma backing  toward the door of the military office, her sword red with blood, and an  inert form on the corridor floor. Two other Hans were circling to either  side of her with wicked-looking knives, while a third evidently a high  officer, judging by the resplendence of his garb tugged desperately to  get an electrophone instrument out of a bulky pocket. If he ever gave  the alarm, there was no telling what might happen to us.    I was at least seventy feet away, but I crouched low and sprang with  every bit of strength in my legs. It would be more correct to say that I  dived, for I reached the fellow head on, with no attempt to draw my legs  beneath me.    Some instinct must have warned him, for he turned suddenly as I hurtled  close to him. But by this time I had sunk close to the floor, and had  stiffened myself rigidly, lest a dragging knee or foot might just  prevent my reaching him. I brought my blade upward and over. It was a  vicious slash that laid him open, bisecting him from groin to chin, and  his dead body toppled down on me, as I slid to a tangled stop.    The other two startled, turned. Wilma leaped at one and struck him down  with a side slash. I looked up at this instant, and the dazed fear on  his face at the length of her leap registered vividly. The Hans knew  nothing of our inertron belts, it seemed, and these leaps and dives of  ours filled them with terror.    As I rose to my feet, a gory mess, Wilma, with a poise and speed which I  found time to admire even in this crisis, again leaped. This time she  dove head first as I had done and, with a beautifully executed thrust,  ran the last Han through the throat.    Uncertainly, she scrambled to her feet, staggered queerly, and then sank  gently prone on the corridor. She had fainted.    At this juncture, Blash and Gaunt reported with elation that they had  the record we wanted.    \"Back to the roof, everybody!\" I ordered, as I picked Wilma up in my  arms. With her inertron belt, she felt as light as a feather.    Gaunt joined me at once from the military office, and at the  intersection of the corridor, we came upon Blash waiting for us. Barker,  however, was not in evidence.    \"Where are you, Barker?\" I called.    \"Go ahead,\" he replied. \"I'll be with you on the roof at once.\"    We came out in the open without any further mishap, and I instructed  Gibbons in the ship to light the knob on the end of the ultron wire. It  flashed dully a few feet away from us. Just how he had maneuvered the  ship to keep our end of the line in position, without its swinging in a  tremendous arc, I"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3261"],[0,"News from Nowhere; Or, An Epoch of Rest (#12)"],[1,"me that \"the sacred rights of property,\" as we used  to think of them, were now no more.  So I sat silent while the old man  took up the thread of the discourse again, and said:    \"Well, then, property quarrels being no longer possible, what remains in  these matters that a court of law could deal with?  Fancy a court for  enforcing a contract of passion or sentiment!  If such a thing were  needed as a _reductio ad absurdum_ of the enforcement of contract, such a  folly would do that for us.\"    He was silent again a little, and then said: \"You must understand once  for all that we have changed these matters; or rather, that our way of  looking at them has changed, as we have changed within the last two  hundred years.  We do not deceive ourselves, indeed, or believe that we  can get rid of all the trouble that besets the dealings between the  sexes.  We know that we must face the unhappiness that comes of man and  woman confusing the relations between natural passion, and sentiment, and  the friendship which, when things go well, softens the awakening from  passing illusions: but we are not so mad as to pile up degradation on  that unhappiness by engaging in sordid squabbles about livelihood and  position, and the power of tyrannising over the children who have been  the results of love or lust.\"    Again he paused awhile, and again went on: \"Calf love, mistaken for a  heroism that shall be lifelong, yet early waning into disappointment; the  inexplicable desire that comes on a man of riper years to be the all-in-  all to some one woman, whose ordinary human kindness and human beauty he  has idealised into superhuman perfection, and made the one object of his  desire; or lastly the reasonable longing of a strong and thoughtful man  to become the most intimate friend of some beautiful and wise woman, the  very type of the beauty and glory of the world which we love so well,--as  we exult in all the pleasure and exaltation of spirit which goes with  these things, so we set ourselves to bear the sorrow which not unseldom  goes with them also; remembering those lines of the ancient poet (I quote  roughly from memory one of the many translations of the nineteenth  century):       'For this the Gods have fashioned man's grief and evil day     That still for man hereafter might be the tale and the lay.'    Well, well, 'tis little likely anyhow that all tales shall be lacking, or  all sorrow cured.\"    He was silent for some time, and I would not interrupt him.  At last he  began again: \"But you must know that we of these generations are strong  and healthy of body, and live easily; we pass our lives in reasonable  strife with nature, exercising not one side of ourselves only, but all  sides, taking the keenest pleasure in all the life of the world.  So it  is a point of honour with us not to be self-centred; not to suppose that  the world must cease because one man is sorry; therefore we should think  it foolish, or if you will, criminal, to exaggerate these matters of  sentiment and sensibility: we are no more inclined to eke out our  sentimental sorrows than to cherish our bodily pains; and we recognise  that there are other pleasures besides love-making.  You must remember,  also, that we are long-lived, and that therefore beauty both in man and  woman is not so fleeting as it was in the days when we were burdened so  heavily by self-inflicted diseases.  So we shake off these griefs in a  way which perhaps the sentimentalists of other times would think  contemptible and unheroic, but which we think necessary and manlike.  As  on the other hand, therefore, we have ceased to be commercial in our love-  matters, so also we have ceased to be _artificially_ foolish.  The folly  which comes by nature, the unwisdom of the immature man, or the older man  caught in a trap, we must put up with that, nor are we much ashamed of  it; but to be conventionally sensitive or sentimental--my friend, I am  old and perhaps disappointed, but at least I think we have cast off  _some_ of the follies of the older world.\"    He paused, as if for some words of mine; but I held my peace: then he  went on: \"At least, if we suffer from the tyranny and fickleness of  nature or our own want of experience, we neither grimace about it, nor  lie.  If there must be sundering betwixt those who meant never to sunder,  so it must be: but there need be no pretext of unity when the reality of  it is gone: nor do we drive those who well know that they are incapable  of it to profess an undying sentiment which they cannot really feel: thus  it is that as that monstrosity of venal lust is no longer possible, so  also it is no longer needed.  Don't misunderstand me.  You did not seemed  shocked when I told you that there were no law-courts to enforce  contracts of sentiment or passion; but so curiously are men made, that  perhaps you will be shocked when I tell you that there is no code of  public opinion which takes the place of such courts, and which might be  as tyrannical and unreasonable as they were.  I do not say that people  don't judge their neighbours' conduct, sometimes, doubtless, unfairly.  But I do say that there is no unvarying conventional set of rules by  which people are judged; no bed of Procrustes to stretch or cramp their  minds and lives; no hypocritical excommunication which people are  _forced_ to pronounce, either by unconsidered habit, or by the  unexpressed threat of the lesser interdict if they are lax in their  hypocrisy.  Are you shocked now?\"    \"N-o--no,\" said I, with some hesitation.  \"It is all so different.\"    \"At any rate,\" said he, \"one thing I think I can answer for: whatever  sentiment there is, it is real--and general; it is not confined to people  very specially refined.  I am also pretty sure, as I hinted to you just  now, that there is not by a great way as much suffering involved in these  matters either to men or to women as there used to be.  But excuse me for  being so prolix on this question!  You know you asked to be treated like  a being from another planet.\"    \"Indeed I thank you very much,\" said I.  \"Now may I ask you about the  position of women in your society?\"    He laughed very heartily for a man of his years, and said: \"It is not  without reason that I have got a reputation as a careful student of  history.  I believe I really do understand 'the Emancipation of Women  movement' of the nineteenth century.  I doubt if any other man now alive  does.\"    \"Well?\" said I, a little bit nettled by his merriment.    \"Well,\" said he, \"of course you will see that all that is a dead  controversy now.  The men have no longer any opportunity of tyrannising  over the women, or the women over the men; both of which things took  place in those old times.  The women do what they can do best, and what  they like best, and the men are neither jealous of it or injured by it.  This is such a commonplace that I am almost ashamed to state it.\"    I said, \"O; and legislation? do they take any part in that?\"    Hammond smiled and said: \"I think you may wait for an answer to that  question till we get on to the subject of legislation.  There may be  novelties to you in that subject also.\"    \"Very well,\" I said; \"but about this woman question?  I saw at the Guest  House that the women were waiting on the men: that seems a little like  reaction doesn't it?\"    \"Does it?\" said the old man; \"perhaps you think housekeeping an  unimportant occupation, not deserving of respect.  I believe that was the  opinion of the 'advanced' women of the nineteenth century, and their male  backers.  If it is yours, I recommend to your notice an old Norwegian  folk-lore tale called How the Man minded the House, or some such title;  the result of which minding was that, after various tribulations, the man  and the family cow balanced each other at the end of a rope, the man  hanging halfway up the chimney, the cow dangling from the roof, which,  after the fashion of the country, was of turf and sloping down low to the  ground.  Hard on the cow, _I_ think.  Of course no such mishap could  happen to such a superior person as yourself,\" he added, chuckling.    I sat somewhat uneasy under this dry gibe.  Indeed, his manner of  treating this latter part of the question seemed to me a little  disrespectful.    \"Come, now, my friend,\" quoth he, \"don't you know that it is a great  pleasure to a clever woman to manage a house skilfully, and to do it so  that all the house-mates about her look pleased, and are grateful to her?  And then, you know, everybody likes to be ordered about by a pretty  woman: why, it is one of the pleasantest forms of flirtation.  You are  not so old that you cannot remember that.  Why, I remember it well.\"    And the old fellow chuckled again, and at last fairly burst out laughing.    \"Excuse me,\" said he, after a while; \"I am not laughing at anything you  could be thinking of; but at that silly nineteenth-century fashion,  current amongst rich so-called cultivated people, of ignoring all the  steps by which their daily dinner was reached, as matters too low for  their lofty intelligence.  Useless idiots!  Come, now, I am a 'literary  man,' as we queer animals used to be called, yet I am a pretty good cook  myself.\"    \"So am I,\" said I.    \"Well, then,\" said he, \"I really think you can understand me better than  you would seem to do, judging by your words and your silence.\"    Said I: \"Perhaps that is so; but people putting in practice commonly this  sense of interest in the ordinary occupations of life rather startles me.  I will ask you a question or two presently about that.  But I want to  return to the position of women amongst you.  You have studied the  'emancipation of women' business of the nineteenth century: don't you  remember that some of the 'superior' women wanted to emancipate the more  intelligent part of their sex from the bearing of children?\"    The old man grew quite serious again.  Said he: \"I"]]]
