If the grade is so steep  as to cause the vehicle to accelerate rapidly, the brakes must be  applied and loss of energy results. The coasting grade is dependent  upon the character of the surface and the nature of the vehicle. In  the cases discussed in the preceding paragraph, the coasting grades  would be five per cent and three per cent respectively. For horse  drawn vehicles then the economical grades would be three and five per  cent, which again emphasizes the necessity of lower grades on roads  that are surfaced than on roads with no wearing surface other than the  natural soil.    The theory of grades is somewhat different when motor vehicles are  considered, since it is allowable to permit considerably higher speed  than with horse drawn vehicles before applying the brakes and the  effect of grade can be utilized not only in translating the vehicle  down the grade, but also in overcoming resistances due to mechanical  friction and the air. On long grades, a speed might be attained that  would require the use of the brake or the same condition might apply  on very steep short grades. There is at present insufficient data on  the tractive resistance and air resistance with motor vehicles to  permit the establishing of rules relative to grade, but experience  indicates a few general principles that may be accepted.    If a hill is of such rate of grade and of such length that it is not  necessary to use the brake it may be assumed that no energy loss  results so far as motor vehicles are concerned. Where there is no turn  at the bottom of the hill and the physical condition of the road  permits speeds up to thirty-five or forty miles per hour grades of  five per cent are permissible if the length does not exceed five  hundred feet and grades of three per cent one thousand feet long are  allowable. It is a rather settled conviction among highway engineers  that on trunk line highways the maximum grade should be six per cent,  unless a very large amount of grading is necessary to reach that  grade.    =Undulating Roads.=--Many hills exist upon highways, the grade of  which is much below the maximum permissible. If there are grades  ranging from 0 to 4 per cent, with a few hills upon which it is  impracticable to reach a grade of less than six per cent, it is  questionable economy to reduce the grades that are already lower than  the allowable maximum. It is especially unjustifiable to incur expense  in reducing a grade from two per cent to one and one-half per cent on  a road upon which there are also grades in excess of that amount. The  undulating road is not uneconomical unless the grades are above the  allowable maximum or are exceptionally long or the alignment follows  short radius curves.    =Safety Considerations.=--On hills it is especially desirable to  provide for safety and curves on hills are always more dangerous than  on level sections of road. Therefore, it is desirable to provide as  flat grades as possible at the curves and to cut away the berm at the  side of the road so as to give a view ahead for about three hundred  feet. Whether a road be level or on a hill, safety should always be  considered and the most important safety precaution is to provide a  clear view ahead for a sufficient distance to enable motor vehicle  drivers to avoid accidents.    [Illustration: Fig. 9.--Types of Guard Rails]    =Guard Railing.=--When a section of road is on an embankment, guard  rails are provided at the top of the side slope to serve as warnings  of danger, and to prevent vehicles from actually going over the  embankment in case of skidding, or if for any reason the driver loses  control. These are usually strongly built, but would hardly restrain a  vehicle which struck at high speed. But they are adequate for the  protection of a driver who uses reasonable care. A typical guard rail  is shown in Fig. 9, but many other designs of similar nature are  employed. At very dangerous turns a solid plank wall six or eight feet  high is sometimes built of such substantial construction as to  withstand the severest shock without being displaced.    Trees, shrubs and the berms at the side of the road in cuts are  particularly likely to obstruct the view and should be cleared or cut  back so far as is necessary to provide the proper sight distance.    =Width of Roadway.=--For roads carrying mixed traffic, 9 feet of width  is needed for a single line of vehicles and 18 feet for 2 lines of  vehicles. In accordance with the above, secondary roads, carrying  perhaps 25 to 50 vehicles per day, may have an available traveled way  18 feet wide. Those more heavily traveled may require room for three  vehicles to pass at any place and therefore have an available traveled  way 30 feet wide. Greater width is seldom required on rural highways,  and 20 feet is the prevailing width for main highways.    =Cross Section.=--The cross section of the road is designed to give  the required width of traveled way, and, in addition, provide the  drainage channels that may be needed. In regions of small rainfall the  side ditches will be of small capacity or may be entirely omitted, but  usually some ditch is provided. The transition from the traveled way  to ditch should be a gradual slope so as to avoid the danger incident  to abrupt change in the shape of the cross section. The depth of ditch  may be varied without changing to width or slope of the traveled part  of the road as shown in Fig. 10.    [Illustration: Fig. 10]    =Control of Erosion.=--The construction of a highway may be utilized  to control general erosion to some extent, particularly when public  highways exist every mile or two and are laid out on a gridiron  system, as is the case in many of the prairie states. The streams  cross the highways at frequent intervals and the culverts can be  placed so as effectually to prevent an increase in depth of the  stream. This will to some extent limit the erosion above the culvert  and if such culverts are built every mile or two along the stream,  considerable effect is produced.    Where small streams have their origin a short distance from a culvert  under which they pass, it is sometimes advisable to provide tile for  carrying the water under the road, instead of the culvert, and, by  continuing the tile into the drainage area of the culvert, eliminate  the flow of surface water and reclaim considerable areas of land.    Erosion in the ditches along a highway can be prevented by  constructing weirs across the ditch at frequent intervals, thus  effectually preventing an increase in the depth of the ditch.    Wherever water flows at a velocity sufficient to produce erosion or  where the drainage channel changes abruptly from a higher to a lower  level, paved gutters, tile or pipe channels should be employed to  prevent erosion.    =Private Entrances.=--Entrance to private property along the highway  is by means of driveways leading off the main road. These should  always be provided for in the design so as to insure easy and  convenient access to the property. The driveways will usually cross  the side ditch along the road and culverts will be required to carry  the water under the driveway. Driveways that cross a gutter by means  of a pavement in the gutter are usually unsatisfactory, and to cross  the gutter without providing a pavement is to insure stoppage of the  flow at the crossing. The culvert at a driveway entrance must be large  enough to take the ditch water readily or it will divert the water to  the roadway itself. Generally end walls on such culverts are not  required as in the case of culverts across a highway.    =Aesthetics.=--Much of the traffic on the public highways is for  pleasure and relaxation and anything that tends to increase the  attractiveness of the highways is to be encouraged. Usually the  roadside is a mass of bloom in the fall, goldenrod, asters and other  hardy annuals being especially beautiful. In some states wild roses  and other low bushes are planted to serve the two-fold purpose of  assisting to prevent erosion and to beautify the roadside. In humid  areas trees of any considerable size shade the road surface and are a  distinct disadvantage to roads surfaced with the less durable  materials such as sand-clay or gravel. It is doubtful if the same is  true of paved surfaces, but the trees should be far enough back from  the traveled way to afford a clear view ahead. Shrubs are not  objectionable from any view-point and are to be encouraged for their  beauty, so long as they do not obstruct the view at turns.          CHAPTER V    EARTH ROADS      Highways constructed without the addition of surfacing material to the  natural soil of the right-of-way are usually called earth roads. But  if the natural soil exhibits peculiar characteristics or is of a  distinct type, the road may be referred to by some distinctive name  indicating that fact. Hence, roads are referred to as clay, gumbo,  sandy or caliche roads as local custom may elect. In each case,  however, the wearing surface consists of the natural soil, which may  have been shaped and smoothed for traffic or may be in its natural  state except for a trackway formed by the vehicles that have used it.    =Variations in Soils.=--The nature of the existing soil will obviously  determine the serviceability and physical characteristics of the road  surface it affords. That is to say that even under the most favorable  conditions some earth roads will be much more serviceable than others,  due to the better stability of the natural soil. Some soils are dense  and somewhat"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29444"],[0,"The Machinery of the Universe: Mechanical Conceptions of Physical Phenomena (#12)"],[1,"the mechanical  pressure which may result from it is a measure of the strength of the  magnetic field, and may exceed a thousand pounds per square inch.      21. OTHER PROPERTIES OF MATTER.    There are many secondary qualities exhibited by matter in some of its  forms, such as hardness, brittleness, malleability, colour, etc., and  the same ultimate element may exhibit itself in the most diverse ways,  as is the case with carbon, which exists as lamp-black, charcoal,  graphite, jet, anthracite and diamond, ranging from the softest to the  hardest of known bodies. Then it may be black or colourless. Gold is  yellow, copper red, silver white, chlorine green, iodine purple. The  only significance any or all of such qualities have for us here is that  the ether exhibits none of them. There is neither hardness nor  brittleness, nor colour, nor any approach to any of the characteristics  for the identification of elementary matter.      22. SENSATION DEPENDS UPON MATTER.    However great the mystery of the relation of body to mind, it is quite  true that the nervous system is the mechanism by and through which all  sensation comes, and that in our experience in the absence of nerves  there is neither sensation nor consciousness. The nerves themselves are  but complex chemical structures; their molecular constitution is said to  embrace as many as 20,000 atoms, chiefly carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and  nitrogen. There must be continuity of this structure too, for to sever a  nerve is to paralyze all beyond. If all knowledge comes through  experience, and all experience comes through the nervous system, the  possibilities depend upon the mechanism each one is provided with for  absorbing from his environment, what energies there are that can act  upon the nerves. Touch, taste, and smell imply contact, sound has  greater range, and sight has the immensity of the universe for its  field. The most distant but visible star acts through the optic nerve to  present itself to consciousness. It is not the ego that looks out  through the eyes, but it is the universe that pours in upon the ego.    Again, all the known agencies that act upon the nerves, whether for  touch or sound or sight, imply matter in some of its forms and  activities, to adapt the energy to the nervous system. The mechanism  for the perception of light is complicated. The light acts upon a  sensitive surface where molecular structure is broken up, and this  disturbance is in the presence of nerve terminals, and the sensation is  not in the eye but in the sensorium. In like manner for all the rest; so  one may fairly say that matter is the condition for sensation, and in  its absence there would be nothing we call sensation.      THE ETHER IS INSENSIBLE TO NERVES.    The ether is in great contrast with matter in this particular. There is  no evidence that in any direct way it acts upon any part of the nervous  system, or upon the mind. It is probable that this lack of relation  between the ether and the nervous system was the chief reason why its  discovery was so long delayed, as the mechanical necessities for it even  now are felt only by such as recognize continuity as a condition for the  transmission of energy of whatever kind it may be. Action at a distance  contradicts all experience, is philosophically incredible, and is  repudiated by every one who once perceives that energy has two  factors--substance and motion.    The table given below presents a list of twenty-two of the known  properties of matter contrasted with those exhibited by the ether. In  none of them are the properties of the two identical, and in most of  them what is true for one is not true for the other. They are not simply  different, they are incomparable.    From the necessities of the case, as knowledge has been acquired and  terminology became essential for making distinctions, the ether has been  described in terms applicable to matter, hence such terms as mass,  solidity, elasticity, density, rigidity, etc., which have a definite  meaning and convey definite mechanical conceptions when applied to  matter, but have no corresponding meaning and convey no such mechanical  conceptions when applied to the ether. It is certain that they are  inappropriate, and that the ether and its properties cannot be described  in terms applicable to matter. Mathematical considerations derived from  the study of matter have no advantage, and are not likely to lead us to  a knowledge of the ether.    Only a few have perceived the inconsistency of thinking of the two in  the same terms. In his _Grammar of Science_, Prof. Karl Pearson says,  \"We find that our sense-impressions of hardness, weight, colour,  temperature, cohesion, and chemical constitution, may all be described  by the aid of the motions of a single medium, which itself is conceived  to have no hardness, weight, colour, temperature, nor indeed elasticity  of the ordinary conceptual type.\"    None of the properties of the ether are such as one would or could have  predicted if he had had all the knowledge possessed by mankind. Every  phenomenon in it is a surprise to us, because it does not follow the  laws which experience has enabled us to formulate for matter. A  substance which has none of the phenomenal properties of matter, and is  not subject to the known laws of matter, ought not to be called matter.  Ether phenomena and matter phenomena belong to different categories, and  the ends of science will not be conserved by confusing them, as is done  when the same terminology is employed for both.    There are other properties belonging to the ether more wonderful, if  possible, than those already mentioned. Its ability to maintain enormous  stresses of various kinds without the slightest evidence of  interference. There is the gravitational stress, a direct pull between  two masses of matter. Between two molecules it is immeasurably small  even when close together, but the prodigious number of them in a bullet  brings the action into the field of observation, while between such  bodies as the earth and moon or sun, the quantity reaches an astonishing  figure. Thus if the gravitative tension due to the gravitative  attraction of the earth and moon were to be replaced by steel wires  connecting the two bodies to prevent the moon from leaving its orbit,  there would be needed four number ten steel wires to every square inch  upon the earth, and these would be strained nearly to the breaking  point. Yet this stress is not only endured continually by this pliant,  impalpable, transparent medium, but other bodies can move through the  same space apparently as freely as if it were entirely free. In addition  to this, the stress from the sun and the more variable stresses from the  planets are all endured by the same medium in the same space and  apparently a thousand or a million times more would not make the  slightest difference. Rupture is impossible.    Electric and magnetic stresses, acting parallel or at right angles to  the other, exist in the same space and to indefinite degrees, neither  modifying the direction nor amount of either of the others.    These various stresses have been computed to represent energy, which if  it could be utilized, each cubic inch of space would yield five hundred  horse-power. It shows what a store-house of energy the ether is. If  every particle of matter were to be instantly annihilated, the universe  of ether would still have an inexpressible amount of energy left. To  draw at will directly from this inexhaustible supply, and utilize it for  the needs of mankind, is not a forlorn hope.    The accompanying table presents these contrasting properties for  convenient inspection.      CONTRASTED PROPERTIES OF MATTER AND THE ETHER.             MATTER.                         ETHER.     1.

So far as we have knowledge to-day, the only factors we have to consider  in explaining physical phenomena are: (1) Ordinary matter, such as  constitutes the substance of the earth, and the heavenly bodies; (2) the  ether, which is omnipresent; and (3) the various forms of motion, which  are mutually transformable in matter, and some of which, but not all,  are transformable into ether forms. For instance, the translatory motion  of a mass of matter can be imparted to another mass by simple impact,  but translatory motion cannot be imparted to the ether, and, for that  reason, a body moving in it is not subject to friction, and"]]]
