The human being is the \"star\", and the horse in only a secondary  performer, a sort of understudy; yes, that's it, an understudy--he has  to study how to keep under the man.\"    \"Are they hard to train?\"    \"Their work all depends on the men that ride them. In bareback riding  there's a knack in jumping on the horse. If a man lands awkwardly and  jars the horse's back, the horse will get out of step and flinch at each  jump, and he isn't nearly so good to perform on. A ring horse must  not swerve or change his pace; if you're up in the air, throwing a  somersault, and the horse swerves from underneath you--where are you?\"    \"Some people think that horses take a lot of notice of the band--is that  so?\"    \"Not that I know of. If there are any horses in the show with an ear  for music, I haven't heard of them. They take a lot of notice of the  ringmaster.\"    \"Does it take them long to learn this work?\"    \"Not long; a couple of months will teach a ring horse; of course, some  are better than others.\"    \"First of all we teach them to come up to you, with the whip, like  horsebreakers do. Then we run them round the ring with a lunging rein  for a long time; then, when they are steady to the ring, we let them  run with the rein loose, and the trainer can catch hold of it if they go  wrong. Then we put a roller on them--a broad surcingle that goes round  the horse's body--and the boys jump on them and canter round, holding  on to the roller, or standing up, lying down, and doing tricks till the  horse gets used to it.\"    \"Well?\"    \"Well, you give 'em a couple of hours of it, perhaps, and then dry them  and feed them, and give them a spell, and then bring them out again.  They soon get to know what you want; but you can't break in horses on  the move. The shifting and worry and noise and excitement put it all out  of their heads. We have a fixed camp where we break them in. And a horse  may know his work perfectly well when there is no one about, but bring  him into the ring at night, and he is all abroad.\"    \"Do you have to give them much whip?\"    \"Not much. If a horse doesn't know what you want him to do, it only  ruins him to whip him. But once he does a thing a few times, and then  won't do it, then you must whip him.\"    \"What about trick horses?\"    \"A trick horse rolls a barrel, or lies down and goes to bed with the  clown, or fires a pistol--does any trick like that. Some small circuses  make the same horses do both trick and ring work, but it isn't a good  line. A horse is all the better to have only one line of business--same  as a man.\"    \"How do you teach them tricks?\"    \"Oh, it takes a long time and a lot of hard work and great patience.  Even to make a horse lie down when he's ordered takes a couple of months  sometimes. To make a horse lie down, you strap up one leg, and then pull  his head round; after a while he gets so tired of the strained position  that he lies down, after which he learns to do it at command. If you  want him to pick up a handkerchief, you put a bit of carrot in it, and  after a while they know that you want them to pick it up--but it takes  a long time. Then a strange hand in the ring will flurry them, and if  anything goes wrong, they get all abroad. A good active pony, with a bit  of Arab blood in him, is the best for tricks.\"    \"What's a school horse?\"    \"Ah, that's a line of business that isn't appreciated enough out here.  On the Continent they think a lot of them. A school horse is one that is  taught to do passaging, to change his feet at command, to move sideways  and backwards; in fact, to drill. Out here no one thinks much of it. But  in Germany, where everyone goes through military riding schools, they  do. The Germans are the best horse-trainers in the world; and the big  German circus-proprietors have men to do all their business for them,  while they just attend to the horses.\"    \"How long does it take to turn out a school horse?\"    \"Well, Chiarini was the best trainer out here, and he used to take two  years to get a horse to his satisfaction. For school horses, you must  have thoroughbreds, because their appearance is half their success. We  had a New Zealand thoroughbred that had raced, and was turning out a  splendid school horse, and he got burnt after costing a year's training.  That's the luck of the game, you know. You keep at it year after year,  and sometimes they die, and sometimes they get crippled--it's all in the  luck of the game. You may give fifty pounds for a horse, and find that  he can never get over his fear of the elephant, while you give ten  pounds for another, and find him a ready-made performer almost.\"    We passed out through the ghostly circus and the menagerie tent down to  the stable tent. There, among a lot of others, a tranquil-looking animal  was munching some feed, while in front of him hung a placard, \"Tiger  Horse\".    \"That's a new sort! What is he, ring, trick, or school horse?\"    \"Well, he's a class by himself. I suppose you'd call him a ring horse.  That's the horse that the tiger rides on.\"    \"Did it take him long to learn that?\"    \"Well, it did not take this horse long; but we tried eleven others  before we could get one to stand it. They're just like men, all  different. What one will stand another won't look at. Well, good-bye.\"    Just like men--no doubt; most men have to carry tigers of various sorts  through life to get a living.          THE CAT      Most people think that the cat is an unintelligent animal, fond of ease,  and caring little for anything but mice and milk. But a cat has really  more character than most human beings, and gets a great deal more  satisfaction out of life. Of all the animal kingdom, the cat has the  most many-sided character.    He--or she--is an athlete, a musician, an acrobat, a Lothario, a grim  fighter, a sport of the first water. All day long the cat loafs about  the house, takes things easy, sleeps by the fire, and allows himself  to be pestered by the attentions of our womenfolk and annoyed by our  children. To pass the time away he sometimes watches a mouse-hole for  an hour or two--just to keep himself from dying of ennui; and people get  the idea that this sort of thing is all that life holds for the cat.  But watch him as the shades of evening fall, and you see the cat as he  really is.    When the family sits down to tea, the cat usually puts in an appearance  to get his share, and purrs noisily, and rubs himself against the  legs of the family; and all the time he is thinking of a fight or a  love-affair that is coming off that evening. If there is a guest at  table the cat is particularly civil to him, because the guest is likely  to have the best of what is going. Sometimes, instead of recognizing  this civility with something to eat, the guest stoops down and strokes  the cat, and says, \"Poor pussy! poor pussy!\"    The cat soon tires of that; he puts up his claw and quietly but firmly  rakes the guest in the leg.    \"Ow!\" says the guest, \"the cat stuck his claws into me!\" The delighted  family remarks, \"Isn't it sweet of him? Isn't he intelligent? _He wants  you to give him something to eat_.\"    The guest dares not do what he would like to do--kick the cat through  the window--so, with tears of rage and pain in his eyes, he affects  to be very much amused, and sorts out a bit of fish from his plate and  hands it down. The cat gingerly receives it, with a look in his  eyes that says: \"Another time, my friend, you won't be so dull of  comprehension,\" and purrs maliciously as he retires to a safe distance  from the guest's boot before eating it. A cat isn't a fool--not by a  long way.    When the family has finished tea, and gathers round the fire to enjoy  the hours of indigestion, the cat slouches casually out of the room and  disappears. Life, true life, now begins for him.    He saunters down his own backyard, springs to the top of the fence with  one easy bound, drops lightly down on the other side, trots across the  right-of-way to a vacant allotment, and skips to the roof of an empty  shed. As he goes, he throws off the effeminacy of civilisation; his gait  becomes lithe and pantherlike; he looks quickly and keenly from side to  side, and moves noiselessly, for he has so many enemies--dogs, cabmen  with whips, and small boys with stones.    Arrived on the top of the shed, the cat arches his back, rakes his claws  once or twice through the soft bark of the old roof, wheels round and  stretches himself a few times; just to see that every muscle is in full  working order; then, dropping his head nearly to his paws, he sends  across a league of backyards his call to his kindred--a call to love, or  war, or sport.    Before long they come, gliding, graceful shadows, approaching  circuitously, and halting occasionally to reconnoitre--tortoiseshell,  tabby, and black, all domestic cats, but all transformed for the nonce  into their natural state. No longer are they the hypocritical, meek  creatures who an hour ago were cadging for fish and milk. They are now  ruffling, swaggering blades with a Gascon sense of dignity. Their fights  are grim and determined, and a cat will be clawed to ribbons before he  will yield.    Even young lady cats have this inestimable superiority over human  beings, that they can work off jealousy, hatred, and malice in a  sprawling, yelling combat on a flat roof. All cats fight, and all keep  themselves more or less in training while they are young. Your cat may  be the acknowledged lightweight champion of his district--a Griffo of  the feline ring!    Just think how much more he gets out of his life than you do out of  yours--what a hurricane of fighting and lovemaking his life is--and  blush for yourself. You have had one little love-affair, and never had a  good, all-out fight in your life!    And the sport they have, too!

For  to what shall we trust for our distinction from the beasts that perish?  To our higher intellect?--yet are we not bidden to be wise as the  serpent, and to consider the ways of the ant?--or to our affections?  nay; these are more shared by the lower animals than our intelligence.  Hamlet leaps into the grave of his beloved, and leaves it,--a dog had  stayed. Humanity and immortality consist neither in reason, nor in love;  not in the body, nor in the animation of the heart of it, nor in the  thoughts and stirrings of the brain of it,--but in the dedication of  them all to Him who will raise them up at the last day.    Sec. XI. It is not, therefore, that the signs of his affections, which  man leaves upon his work, are indeed more ennobling than the signs of  his intelligence; but it is the balance of both whose expression we  need, and the signs of the government of them all by Conscience; and  Discretion, the daughter of Conscience. So, then, the intelligent part  of man being eminently, if not chiefly, displayed in the structure of  his work, his affectionate part is to be shown in its decoration; and,  that decoration may be indeed lovely, two things are needed: first, that  the affections be vivid, and honestly shown; secondly, that they be  fixed on the right things.    Sec. XII. You think, perhaps, I have put the requirements in wrong order.  Logically I have; practically I have not: for it is necessary first to  teach men to speak out, and say what they like, truly; and, in the  second place, to teach them which of their likings are ill set, and  which justly. If a man is cold in his likings and dislikings, or if he  will not tell you what he likes, you can make nothing of him. Only get  him to feel quickly and to speak plainly, and you may set him right. And  the fact is, that the great evil of all recent architectural effort has  not been that men liked wrong things: but that they either cared nothing  about any, or pretended to like what they did not. Do you suppose that  any modern architect likes what he builds, or enjoys it? Not in the  least. He builds it because he has been told that such and such things  are fine, and that he _should_ like them. He pretends to like them, and  gives them a false relish of vanity. Do you seriously imagine, reader,  that any living soul in London likes triglyphs?[30]--or gets any hearty  enjoyment out of pediments?[31] You are much mistaken. Greeks did:  English people never did,--never will. Do you fancy that the architect  of old Burlington Mews, in Regent Street, had any particular  satisfaction in putting the blank triangle over the archway, instead of  a useful garret window? By no manner of means. He had been told it was  right to do so, and thought he should be admired for doing it. Very few  faults of architecture are mistakes of honest choice: they are almost  always hypocrisies.    Sec. XIII. So, then, the first thing we have to ask of the decoration is  that it should indicate strong liking, and that honestly. It matters not  so much what the thing is, as that the builder should really love it and  enjoy it, and say so plainly. The architect of Bourges Cathedral liked  hawthorns; so he has covered his porch with hawthorn,--it is a perfect  Niobe of May. Never was such hawthorn; you would try to gather it  forthwith, but for fear of being pricked. The old Lombard architects  liked hunting; so they covered their work with horses and hounds, and  men blowing trumpets two yards long. The base Renaissance architects of  Venice liked masquing and fiddling; so they covered their work with  comic masks and musical instruments. Even that was better than our  English way of liking nothing, and professing to like triglyphs.    Sec. XIV. But the second requirement in decoration, is a sign of our  liking the right thing. And the right thing to be liked is God's work,  which He made for our delight and contentment in this world. And all  noble ornamentation is the expression of man's delight in God's work.    Sec. XV. So, then, these are the two virtues of building: first, the  signs of man's own good work; secondly, the expression of man's delight  in better work than his own. And these are the two virtues of which I  desire my reader to be able quickly to judge, at least in some measure;  to have a definite opinion up to a certain point. Beyond a certain point  he cannot form one. When the science of the building is great, great  science is of course required to comprehend it; and, therefore, of  difficult bridges, and light-houses, and harbor walls, and river dykes,  and railway tunnels, no judgment may be rapidly formed. But of common  buildings, built in common circumstances, it is very possible for every  man, or woman, or child, to form judgment both rational and rapid. Their  necessary, or even possible, features are but few; the laws of their  construction are as simple as they are interesting. The labor of a few  hours is enough to render the reader master of their main points; and  from that moment he will find in himself a power of judgment which can  neither be escaped nor deceived, and discover subjects of interest where  everything before had appeared barren. For though the laws are few and  simple, the modes of obedience to them are not so. Every building  presents its own requirements and difficulties; and every good building  has peculiar appliances or contrivances to meet them. Understand the  laws of structure, and you will feel the special difficulty in every new  building which you approach; and you will know also, or feel  instinctively,[32] whether it has been wisely met or otherwise. And an  enormous number of buildings, and of styles of buildings, you will be  able to cast aside at once, as at variance with these constant laws of  structure, and therefore unnatural and monstrous.    Sec. XVI. Then, as regards decoration, I want you only to consult your  own natural choice and liking. There is a right and wrong in it; but you  will assuredly like the right if you suffer your natural instinct to  lead you. Half the evil in this world comes from people not knowing what  they do like, not deliberately setting themselves to find out what they  really enjoy. All people enjoy giving away money, for instance: they  don't know _that_,--they rather think they like keeping it; and they  _do_ keep it under this false impression, often to their great  discomfort. Every body likes to do good; but not one in a hundred finds  _this_ out. Multitudes think they like to do evil; yet no man ever  really enjoyed doing evil since God made the world.    So in this lesser matter of ornament. It needs some little care to try  experiments upon yourself: it needs deliberate question and upright  answer. But there is no difficulty to be overcome, no abstruse reasoning  to be gone into; only a little watchfulness needed, and thoughtfulness,  and so much honesty as will enable you to confess to yourself and to all  men, that you enjoy things, though great authorities say you should not.    Sec. XVII. This looks somewhat like pride; but it is true humility, a  trust that you have been so created as to enjoy what is fitting for you,  and a willingness to be pleased, as it was intended you should be. It is  the child's spirit, which we are then most happy when we most recover;  only wiser than children in that we are ready to think it subject of  thankfulness that we can still be pleased with a fair color or a dancing  light. And, above all, do not try to make all these pleasures  reasonable, nor to connect the delight which you take in ornament with  that which you take in construction or usefulness. They have no  connection; and every effort that you make to reason from one to the  other will blunt your sense of beauty, or confuse it with sensations  altogether inferior to it. You were made for enjoyment, and the world  was filled with things which you will enjoy, unless you are too proud to  be pleased by them, or too grasping to care for what you cannot turn to  other account than mere delight. Remember that the most beautiful things  in the world are the most useless; peacocks and lilies for instance; at  least I suppose this quill I hold in my hand writes better than a  peacock's would, and the peasants of Vevay, whose fields in spring time  are as white with lilies as the Dent du Midi is with its snow, told me  the hay was none the better for them.    Sec. XVIII. Our task therefore divides itself into two branches, and these  I shall follow in succession. I shall first consider the construction of  buildings, dividing them into their really necessary members or  features; and I shall endeavor so to lead the reader forward from the  foundation upwards, as that he may find out for himself the best way of  doing everything, and having so discovered it, never forget it. I shall  give him stones, and bricks, and straw, chisels, and trowels, and the  ground, and then ask him to build; only helping him, as I can, if I find  him puzzled. And when he has built his house or church, I shall ask him  to ornament it, and leave it to him to choose the ornaments as I did to  find out the construction: I shall use no influence with him whatever,  except to counteract previous prejudices, and leave him, as far as may  be, free. And when he has thus found out how to build, and chosen his  forms of decoration, I shall do what I can to confirm his confidence in"]]]
