[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37814"],[0,"The Story of Magellan and The Discovery of the Philippines (#12)"],[1,"the middle of October. The water grew colder and the land became  more desolate. Suddenly a bay appeared and the continent seemed to part.  The sea poured its tides to the East amid towering mountains, and a  strait appeared, which now bears the name of Magellan.    The soul of the Admiral thrilled. It was the fulfillment of his visions.  He called the opening to the swift channel Cape Virgins, as he  discovered it on the day on which the Church commemorated the martyrdom  of the \"eleven thousand virgins.\"    His lone lantern entered the straits. The way was toward the East.    Magellan sent the ship Antonio, which was commanded by his cousin Alvaro  de Mesquita, to explore the bay, of which ship Gormez still held the  position of pilot. The mutineer's hour had come.    The pilot entered the bay, but presently a powerful tide carried the  ship back, and beyond the sight of the flag and the lantern of Magellan.    The jealous Portuguese had seen enough to know that great perils were  before the fleet or that a glory like to that of Columbus was now likely  to fall to the lot of Magellan. He determined to be revenged upon the  Admiral for supplanting him in accepting the favors of the King.    He called the crew secretly about him.    \"You are rushing on to ruin,\" he said. \"I can take you back to Spain.  Put Mesquita in irons, and let us return. Mesquita advised Magellan to  execute our comrades!\"    The crew, overcome by the perils of the situation, obeyed the pilot.    Mesquita was placed in irons, and the pilot bore the Antonio away from  the wintry seas, and turned her prow toward Spain.    But untrue as the sailors were to Magellan, he was true to them. He  delayed the expedition for their return, and sent out the Victoria in  search of them. The Victoria's crew planted signal standards, under  which were letters.    Now perhaps for the first time Magellan was master of the expedition. He  supposed at first that the Antonio had become lost in the terrible  tides, but he still suspected treachery.    As the fleet entered the straits, the hills at night blazed with fires.  The explorers thought these fires were volcanoes. They were signal fires  kindled by the natives. Magellan gave the place the name of \"Tierra del  Fuego\"--the \"Land of Fire,\" a name that it still bears.    The water ran icy cold. Peaks of crystal towered above the straits, and  the sublimities of mountain desolations everywhere appeared. So amid  awful chasms of the sea, now white with snows, now dark with shadows,  the little fleet glided on, the farol in the air at night, and all eyes  strained with wonder to see what new disclosure this strait would  bring.    What must have been the reflection of Magellan as the mysteries of the  new world lifted before his eyes?    Joy is the compensation of suffering, and if his happiness was as great  as his trials had been, he must have indeed known thrilling moments. He  had dared, and he had achieved.    He wondered at the fate of the Antonio, as the days went by. He indeed  thought her lost, but yet hoped that she might appear.    \"She has deserted us,\" ventured a loyal officer.    \"No,\" reasoned the Admiral. \"Mesquita would never desert me.\"    He was right. There were many true hearts that made the voyage like Del  Cano's, but no heart was truer to Magellan than Mesquita's; and true  hearts know and love each other.    The ships glided on slowly, without the Antonio. They had two new  passengers in the giants whose lives must have been filled with wonder  on ship-board.          CHAPTER XIII.    \"THE ADMIRAL WAS MAD!\"      Grave as was the act of treachery that the jealousy of Gormez led him to  commit, he was true to the two marooned priests who had opposed the  daring schemes of Magellan.    \"We must not leave them to perish,\" he said.    So with Mesquita in irons he steered his ship toward the lonely islands  where the crew had passed the winter.    They found Carthagena and his brother monk still living, and never could  two men have been more glad to escape from exile. To live among naked  giants, whom they could not civilize, must have become a horror to them.  But their lives had been spared, though their biscuits and wine, we  fancy, were gone.    \"The Admiral has gone mad,\" said the men who had come to rescue them.  \"He knows not the way to the Moluccas, nor to anywhere.\"    The marooned men asked them where they were now going.    \"To Spain,\" was the answer. \"We have come to rescue you. Our Captain has  never forgotten you. He will need you as witnesses. You must testify  that the Admiral is mad.\"    They were ready to testify that.    The ship sailed back to Spain.    The tales that they carried back to beautiful Seville caused a great  disappointment in Spain. They must have stricken the heart of the wife  of Magellan.    Gormez related there that the Admiral had become mad; that he had  marooned the two priests whom they had brought back as witnesses of the  truth of what he asserted; that Magellan had sailed into winter seas,  and quite lost his reason, and knew not where he was going.    Then he told a terrible story of the execution of the mutinous  Spaniards, friends of the King, at St. Julian. He said:    \"His cousin, Mesquita, our captain, advised these crimes, and so we put  him in irons, and have brought him back to receive justice in Spain.\"    Mesquita protested his innocence and tried to gain credence for his  case. But no one cared to listen to him. The court and the popular  feeling were against him. He was consigned to a prison. It was useless  for him to protest, and to say that Magellan had made a great discovery;  that he had found straits which were leading to the South Sea, and which  were likely to prove that the ocean that Balboa had beheld was  continuous.    He was placed in a lonely dungeon, and there brooded over his wrongs and  dreamed.    He had one hope; it was that Magellan would return triumphant, a second  Columbus or Vasco da Gama. If that day were to come, he would be  released, and the court would honor him, and he would be hailed as a  hero.    \"I have been made a prisoner by treachery,\" he said to a few men. \"I  believe that the day of my vindication will one day dawn.\"    Cardinal Ximenes died. Juana still watched by the tomb of her husband,  and took no interest in the world. Charles V was entering upon his  career as a conqueror who was to subdue the Roman world to his will.    As for Magellan in Spain he was to be but little more remembered now.  Spain believed the story of the jealous Gormez, and the mariners of  Seville said:    \"The Admiral was mad!\"    In the common view the mad Admiral had gone down in Antarctic seas. Like  Faleiro, his friend, who had been sent to the mad house, it was thought  that his brain had become unsettled, and that his bright visions had  failed.    The two mutineers ate bread and drank wine again in the convent bowers  of Seville.    Gormez had schemes of his own. He desired the authority of the throne to  make an expedition to the Spice Islands, which he believed he could find  by sailing West. Strangely enough, as we have said, this jealous,  treacherous man was afterward made a pilot in an expedition that visited  Florida, Cape Cod, and Massachusetts Bay. But he did not find the way to  the Spice Islands on the voyage.    Mesquita, still believing in the success of the expedition of Magellan,  said to a few whom he could reach:    \"Magellan is not mad. He executed those who had planned to murder him.  He had to put to death these men for the sake of the expedition. He will  return again!\"    Few believed his story, and fewer his prophecy.    Still there were some who hoped that the prisoner's prophecy might prove  true. Columbus was deemed mad, and quelled a mutiny, but he returned  again. Vasco da Gama faced doubt and destruction, but he returned again.  There were not wanting some who asked, \"Will Magellan ever return  again?\" Such usually received the answer, \"The Admiral was mad!\"    The poor wife of Magellan, who had hoped much from him for the sake of  her child, as well as for Spain, heard these reports in an agony of  grief. But she still hoped. She must have believed in her husband's  destiny.          CHAPTER XIV.    THE PACIFIC.--THE DEATH OF THE GIANTS.      The four ships glided along the wonderful straits which Magellan named  the \"Virgins,\" but which will always bear his own name. The scenery  continued wild and fierce, and in some places overawing and sublime;  they sailed amid domes of crystal and almost under the roofs of a broken  world. They still moved slowly--the scenery growing more and more  wonderful.    The air grew bright again. The ships were in the sea. They had entered a  sea broad and glorious, but which Magellan could have hardly dreamed to  be nearly ten thousand miles long, and more than that wide! Its waters  were placid--an ocean plain. Columbus had heard of this vast sea, and  Balboa had seen it from the peak of Darien.    All the joy that Magellan had anticipated in his visions of years now  burst upon him.    \"The Pacific!\"    This was the name that came to him as he surveyed the new ocean world.  He was the discoverer of the South Pacific, which was continuous with  the ocean discovered by Balboa. What did it contain? Whither might he  sail over the new serenity of waters?    His soul had stood against his own country; his name had been cast out  by his countrymen. But in the splendors of the sunset sea he had found  his faith to be reality. It is said that the sailors wept when they  beheld the Pacific.    We may fancy the joy of Del Cano.    We may imagine how the heart of Pigafetta, the young Italian, which had  always been true to the Admiral, must have overflowed with delight when  the Pacific opened before his eyes! There is a strong heart beat in the  happiness of one who has been true to a successful man in the hour of  his need.

(Foregoing combination of characters distinguishing  _S. puma_ from other species in genus.)    _Description and variation._--Ten breeding males from the vicinity of  Puerto Viejo, Heredia Province, Costa Rica, have snout-vent lengths of  32.5 to 37.9 mm. (34.8 mm.). In these specimens, the length of the tibia  to the snout-vent length is 0.48 to 0.53 (0.51), and the tympanum/eye  ratio is 0.52 to 0.72 (0.65). Seven females have snout-vent lengths of  40.8 to 45.8 mm. (43.9 mm.). No individual has more than a vestige of a  web between the second and third and fourth fingers. None has a web  between the first and second fingers. Breeding males lack nuptial  excrescences on the thumbs. The vocal sac is moderately large and  bilobed.    In preserved specimens the dorsal ground color varies from yellowish tan  to grayish brown. All specimens have dark brown dorsal markings in the  form of a pair of dorsal stripes, variously modified (Pl. 7A). In some  specimens, such as KU 91716, the stripes are discrete and extend from  the postorbital region nearly to the vent. In most specimens the stripes  are connected by a transverse mark in the scapular region and in many  others also by a transverse mark in the sacral region. In some specimens  the stripes are fragmented posteriorly; fragmentation is extreme in KU  30300, in which the dorsal pattern consists of two series of dark  longitudinal dashes. The other extreme is a nearly complete fusion of  the stripes, as in KU 91714. A dark brown interorbital bar usually  extends onto the eyelids, but in some specimens this is reduced to a  short V-shaped mark or small spot between the eyes. There is no dark  post-tympanic mark, but dark brown pigment forms a venated pattern from  the axilla to the mid-flank; the inguinal region is white, finely  mottled with dark brown. The dorsal surfaces of the hind limbs are  colored like the body and have two or three dark brown transverse marks  on the thighs, three to five marks on the shanks, and one or two marks  or irregularly arranged dark flecks on the tarsi. The anterior and  posterior surfaces of the thighs are pale tan to brown. The webbing of  the feet is tan to grayish brown. A narrow white labial stripe, white  anal stripe, and narrow white stripes on the tarsi and outer edges of  the forelimbs are invariably present. The ventral surfaces are creamy  white.    In life the dorsum is tan or pale brown with dark brown markings. Some  individuals have scattered metallic green flecks on the dorsum. The  flanks are mottled dark brown and creamy white. The posterior surfaces  of the thighs are dark brown. The vocal sacs are grayish brown, and the  iris is a deep bronze color.    _Natural History._--_Smilisca puma_ inhabits humid lowland tropical  forests having more or less evenly distributed rainfall throughout the  year. The equable climatic conditions seemingly permit these frogs to be  active throughout most of the year. Taylor (1952:846) found calling  males at Batan, Costa Rica, on July 20, 1951. We found the species  breeding near Puerto Viejo, Costa Rica, on February 19, June 18, July  13, and July 31. Specimens of calling males from Costa Rica in the  collection at the University of Southern California were obtained in  February at La Fortuna, on August 22 at Los Diamantes, on August 30 at  Jabillos, and on September 5 at La Lola. Gravid females were collected  in June, July and August.    Males call from shallow water. All breeding congregations of this  species that we have found were in a grassy marsh, 7.5 kilometers west  of Puerto Viejo, Costa Rica. Tadpoles were found in water-filled  depressions in the marsh at night. When first observed, tadpoles were  near the surface of the water; they responded to light by quickly taking  refuge in the dense grass. No tadpoles were observed by day.    The breeding call consists of a low squawk, usually followed by a series  of one or more rattling secondary notes (duration of primary notes,  0.06-0.35 seconds; of secondary notes, 0.10 to 0.47 seconds), repeated  at intervals of 5 to 55 seconds. The primary notes have 187 to 240  pulses per second and major frequencies of about 740 to 1870 cycles per  second (Pl. 11A).    Only six tadpoles are available for study. Four of them in stage 34 of  development have body lengths of 9.0 to 9.5 mm., tail lengths of 14.0 to  15.0 mm., and total lengths of 23.0 to 24.5 mm. One tadpole in stage 38  and one in stage 40 have total lengths of 31.0 mm. A typical tadpole in  stage 34 of development (KU 91807 from 7.5 km. W Puerto Viejo, Heredia  Province, Costa Rica) has a body length of 9.5 mm., tail length of 15.0  mm., and total length of 24.5 mm.;"]]]
