He removed with his father, during childhood, and settled near  Palmyra, in Wayne County, New York. Amid these forest wilds he was  reared a farmer, and inured to all the hardships, toils, and  privations of a newly settled country. His education was therefore  very limited. When about seventeen years of age, he had several open  visions, in which a holy angel ministered to him, admonished him for  his sins, taught him repentance, and faith in the crucified and risen  Messiah, opened to him the Scriptures of the Prophets, unfolding the  field of prophecy pertaining to the latter-day glory, and the  doctrines of Christ and his ancient Apostles.    On the 22nd Sept., 1827, the angel directed him to a hill a few miles  distant, called anciently Cumorah. Around this hill, in the fifth  century of the Christian era, had rallied the last remnant of a once  powerful and highly polished nation called the Nephites.    Here, two hundred and thirty thousand men, women and children,  marshalled themselves for a last defence, in legions of ten thousand  each, under their respective commanders, at whose head was the  renowned Mormon, the General of a hundred battles. And here they  received the enemy in untold numbers, and melted away before them,  till none remained except a few that fled to the southward, and a few  that fell wounded, and were left by the enemy among the unburied dead.    Among these latter were General Mormon, and his son, and second in  command--General Moroni.    These were the last Prophets of a nation, now no more. They held the  sacred records, compiled and transmitted from their fathers, from the  remotest antiquity. They held the Urim and Thummim, and the compass of  Lehi, which had been prepared by Providence, to guide a colony from  Jerusalem to America.    In the hill Cumorah, they deposited all these things. Here they lay  concealed for fourteen hundred years. And here did the angel Moroni  direct the young Joseph to behold these sacred things, in their sacred  deposit, and to receive, from these long-silent and gloomy archives,  an abridged record of the whole, and with it the Urim and Thummim.    The abridged record, thus obtained, was engraved in Egyptian  characters, on gold plates, by the hands of the two Prophets and  Generals--Mormon and Moroni. By the instructions of the angel, and the  use of the Urim and Thummim, the youthful Joseph, now a Prophet and  Seer, was enabled to translate the abridgment, or rather the unsealed  portion which was destined for the present age.    This done, the angel of the Lord appeared to three other persons,  called Martin Harris, Oliver Cowdery, and David Whitmer; showed them  the golden plates, and the engravings thereon; bore testimony of their  correct translation by the Prophet Joseph, and commanded them to bear  a faithful testimony of the same. Two of these were respectable  farmers, and the other was a school-master.    Early in 1830, this translation with the accompanying testimony, was  published in English, in the United States, under the title of the  Book Of Mormon.    It is now, 1853, translated and published in nearly all European  languages.    This book more deeply interests the world, and every intelligent,  accountable being therein, than any other book, save the Jewish  Scriptures, which is now extant. Its history penetrates the otherwise  dark oblivion of the past, as it regards America, through the remote  ages of antiquity; follows up the stream of the generations of man,  till arriving at the great fountain, the distributor of nations,  tribes and tongues--the Tower of Babel, it ceases, or is lost in, and  sweetly blended with, that one great undivided Adamic river, whose  source is in Paradise, the cradle of man; whose springs issue from  beneath the throne of the Eternal; and whose secret fountains comprise  the infinite expanse, the boundless ocean of intellect, fact, and  historic truth, as recorded in the archives of eternity. Its prophetic  vision opens the events of unborn time. The fate of nations; the  restoration of Judah and Israel; the downfall of corrupt churches and  institutions; the end of superstition and misrule; the universal  prevalence of peace, truth, light and knowledge; the awful wars which  precede those happy times; the glorious coming of Jesus Christ as  King; the resurrection of the Saints, to reign upon the earth; the  great, grand rest of a thousand years; the jubilee of universal nature  upon our planet, are all predicted in that book. The time and means of  their fulfilment are pointed out with clearness, showing the present  age more pregnant with events than all the ages of Adam's race which  have gone before it. Its doctrines are developed in such plainness and  simplicity, and with such clearness and precision, that no man can  mistake them. They are there as they flowed from the mouth of a risen  Redeemer, in the liquid eloquence of love, mingled with immortal tears  of joy and compassion, and were written by men whose tears of  overwhelming affection and gratitude bathed his immortal feet.    It was ascertained by revelation, by means of the Urim and  Thummim, that the youthful Prophet Joseph was of the house of Israel,  of the tribe of Joseph.    He continued to receive visions, revelations, and the ministry of  angels, by whom he was at length ordained to the Apostleship, or High  Priesthood after the order of Melchizedec, to hold the keys of the  kingdom of God, the dispensation of the fulness of times.    Thus qualified, he proceeded, on the 6th of April, A.D. 1830, to  organize the Church of the Saints, which then consisted of six  members. The gifts of healing, of prophecy, of visions and miracles,  began to be manifested among the believers, thus confirming his  testimony with signs following.    In this same year, the principles restored by him were proclaimed, and  Branches of the Church were organized in various parts of his own  State, in Pennsylvania, Ohio, and elsewhere; and the number of his  disciples increased from six members, to upwards of one thousand.    During the three following years, hundreds of ministers, ordained by  him, were sent out in all directions through the country, and Branches  of the Church were organized in most of the States of the American  Union.    In eighteen hundred and thirty five, he ordained by commandment of the  Lord, a quorum of Twelve Apostles, and several quorums of seventy, as  a traveling ministry.    In 'thirty-six, a temple was completed and dedicated, in Kirtland,  Ohio; in which these quorums, and the Priesthood in general were  assembled in a school of the Prophets, and were instructed, and  anointed to their holy calling. In this same year, some of the  Apostles visited Upper Canada, and spread the fulness of the Gospel in  Toronto and all the region round, gathering several Branches of the  Church.    In 'thirty-seven, a mission was sent to England, which was attended  with the same powers, and with remarkable success.    In 'thirty-eight, the State of Missouri undertook the extermination of  the Church from its borders, murdered many men, women and children,  and finally succeeded in the forcible expulsion of about ten thousand  people, and the seizure of their lands and property.    In eighteen hundred and forty, the quorum of the Twelve Apostles  visited England, gathered great numbers into the Church, and published  the Book of Mormon, and several other works, among which was a  periodical called the _Millennial Star_, which now, in 1853, has a  circulation of nearly eighteen thousand copies weekly.    Between the years 'forty, and 'forty-four, our youthful Prophet  gathered about him many thousands of his disciples; erected the great  city of Nauvoo, on the banks of the Mississippi; commenced the  erection of one of the most splendid temples in the world; and  organized a legion of citizen soldiers for its defence. This legion  comprised nearly six thousand men, and was commanded by the young  Prophet Joseph, who held a government commission, as  Lieutenant-General.    From this centre of science and heavenly light, there emanated rays,  by the aid of a foreign ministry, penetrating afar, and lighting up  the dawn of that effulgent day which is destined to break over all the  earth, and shine for ever.    Apostles, High Priests, Elders, Counsellors and Ministers of every  degree, here thronged our youthful Prophet and hero, and were taught  in this great school of Theology and spiritual philosophy; while a  hundred thousand disciples in the nation and beyond the seas, looked  to this centre for light and instruction.    Such was the progress of the science of Theology, revived in the  present age; such the result of fourteen years of the ministry of an  unlettered youth, crying in the wilderness the proclamation of  repentance, baptizing for the remission of sins, and holding the keys  of this divine, eternal power.    His unparalleled success, and still increasing influence, now alarmed  his former persecutors, and raised their jealousy and envy to the  highest pitch of frenzy and madness.    Several counties of Illinois combined with the former enemies, who had  robbed and destroyed the Saints in Missouri, and, calling public  meetings, passed resolutions to destroy the city of Nauvoo, and to  force the Saints, once more, to abandon their homes and farms to the  possession of the land pirates. They also entered into covenant, to  take the life of the young Joseph.    To resist this overwhelming storm, our hero and Prophet marshalled his  legion of six thousand men, in his beloved city of Nauvoo, prepared  for the most vigorous defence, and awaited the onset. The cowardly  enemy soon discovered the impropriety of an open attack, and resolved  on stratagem. They caused a magistrate of their own number to issue a  writ; and sent a constable to bring the person of Joseph into"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35490"],[0,"Seaside Studies in Natural History. Marine Animals of Massachusetts Bay. (#12)"],[1," of a gelatinous disk,  corresponding to that of any Jelly-fish. Four tubes pass through the  whole length of this peduncle, and open into four chambers, dividing  the digestive cavity above into as many equal spaces. (Fig. 55.) These  spaces are produced by folds in the upper floor of the disk, uniting  it to the lower floor at given distances, and forming so many  partition-walls, dividing the digestive sac into four distinct  cavities. These lines of juncture between the two floors, where the  partitions occur, produce the four radiating lines, running from the  proboscis to the margin of the disk, on the upper surface. (Fig. 55.)  The triangular figures, running from the mouth to each cluster of  tentacles, are produced by the ovaries, which consist of distinct  pouches or bags attached to the upper surface of the disk, and hanging  down into the cavities below; every little dot within these triangular  spaces represents such a bag. Each bag is crowded with eggs, which  drop into the digestive cavity at the spawning season, and are passed  out at the mouth. The tentacles always grow in clusters, but are  nevertheless arranged according to a regular order. They are  club-shaped at their extremities, but are hollow throughout, opening  into the chambers of the digestive cavity, two of the clusters thus  being connected with each chamber. Their chief office seems to be to  catch the food and convey it to the mouth, though they may also be  used as a kind of suckers, and the animal not unfrequently attaches  itself by means of these appendages. Between every two clusters of  tentacles will be observed a short, single appendage, of an entirely  different appearance. These are the so-called auricles, and though so  unlike tentacles in the adult animal, when in their earlier stages  (Fig. 56) they resemble each other closely. But as their development  goes on, the tentacles stretch out into longer, more delicate flexible  organs, while the auricles remain short and compact throughout life.  They contain a slight pigment spot representing an eye, though how far  it serves the purpose of vision remains doubtful. They are chiefly  used by the animal as a means of adhering to any surface upon which it  may wish to fasten itself; for the Lucernaria, though usually found  attached to eel-grass in shoal water, has the power of independent  motion, and frequently separates from its resting-place, floating  about freely in the water for a while, or attaching itself anew by  means of the auricles and tentacles upon some other object. The color  of this pretty Acaleph varies from a greenish hue to green, with a  faint tinge of red, or to a reddish brown. One of its commonest and  most exquisite tints is that of a pale aqua-marine. It may be found  along our shores wherever the eel-grass grows, and as far out as this  plant extends. It thrives admirably in confinement, and for this  reason is especially adapted to the aquarium.        [Illustration: Fig. 56. Young Lucernaria; magnified.]           *       *       *       *       *          HYDROIDS.      Under this order, the general character of which has already been  explained in the introductory chapter on Acalephs, are included a  number of groups which, whether as Hydroid communities in their  earlier phases of existence, or as free swimming Medusae in their  farther development, challenge our admiration, both for their beauty  of form and color, and their grace of motion. Some of them are so  minute that they escape the observation of all but those who are  laboriously seeking for the hidden treasures of the microscopic world,  but the greater number are large enough to be readily found by the  most inexperienced collector, when his attention is once drawn to  them; and he may easily stock his aquarium with these pretty little  communities, and even trace the development of the Jelly-fishes upon  them.    To the Hydroids belong the Campanularians, the Sertularians, and the  Tubularians. Some examples of each, as represented on our shores, will  be found under their different heads, accompanied with full  descriptions. There is another group usually considered as distinct  from Hydroids, and known as a separate order among Acalephs, under the  name of Siphonophorae, but included with them here in accordance with  the views of Vogt, Agassiz, and others, in whose opinion they differ  from the ordinary Hydroid communities only in being free and floating,  instead of fixed to the ground. Some new facts, published here for the  first time, tend to sustain the accuracy of this classification.[5]  With these few preliminary remarks to show the connection of the  order, let us now look at some of the animals belonging to it more in  detail.        [Footnote 5: See Chapter on Nanomia.]      _Campanularians_.    All the Campanularians, of which Oceania (Fig. 68), Clytia (Fig. 73),  and Eucope (Fig. 61) form a part, belong among those little shrub-like  communities of animals called Hydroids, from which most of our  Jelly-fishes are developed. They differ in one essential feature from  the Tubularians. (Fig. 93.) The whole stem, from summit to base, is  enveloped in a horny sheath, extending around both the fertile and  sterile individuals of the community, and forming a network at the  base of the stem, which serves as a kind of foundation for the whole  stock. To the naked eye such a community looks like a tiny shrub (see  Fig. 57), with the branches growing in regular alternation on either  side of the stems. The reproductive calycles, i.e. the protecting  envelopes covering the young Medusae, usually arise in the angles of  the branches formed by a prolongation of the sheath. These calycles or  bells, as they are called, assume a great variety of  shapes,--elliptical, round, pear-shaped, or ringed like the Clytia.  (Fig. 72.) In one such bell there may be no less than twenty or thirty  Medusae developed one below the other; when ready to hatch, the calycle  bursts and allows them to escape.      _Eucope_. (_Eucope diaphana_ AG.)        [Illustration: Fig. 57. Hydrarium of Eucope; natural size.]        [Illustration: Fig. 58. Portion of Fig. 57; magnified.]    In Figs. 60 and 61 we have a representation of our little Eucope, one  of the prettiest of the Jelly-fishes belonging to this group; Fig. 57  represents the Hydroid from which it arises; a single branch with the  reproductive bell being magnified in Fig. 58. In Fig. 59 is seen a  portion of the Jelly-fish disk, with the fringe of tentacles highly  magnified. The disk of the Eucope (Fig. 60) looks like a shallow bell,  of which the proboscis often seems to form the handle; for the disk  has such an extraordinary thinness that it turns inside out with the  greatest ease, so that the inner surface may become at any moment the  outer one, with the proboscis projecting from it, as in Fig. 60, while  the next movement of the animal may reverse its whole position, and  the proboscis then hangs down from the inside, as in other  Jelly-fishes. (See Fig. 61.)        [Illustration: Fig. 59. Part of marginal tube and tentacles of      Eucope, greatly magnified; _e_ eye-speck, _b_ base of tentacle.,      _r_ reentering base of tentacle.]        [Illustration: Fig. 60. Young Eucope; magnified.]        [Illustration: Fig. 61. Adult Eucope seen in profile; magnified.]        [Illustration: Fig. 62. Quarter disk of Fig. 60, seen from below;      _e e_ tentacles bearing eye-speck.]    The tentacles are solid and stiff like little hairs, and two of them,  in each quarter-segment of the disk, have small concretions at the  base, which are no doubt eye-specks. (See Fig. 62.) Along the  chymiferous tubes little swellings are developed, which increase  gradually, and become either ovaries or spermaries, according to the  sex of the animal. (Fig. 63.) In the adult the genital organs hang  down, like elongated bags, from the chymiferous tubes. (Fig. 64.) The  tentacles are numerous, multiplying to about a hundred and ninety-two  in the adult, and increasing according to the numerical law to be  explained in the description of the Oceania.        [Illustration: Fig. 63. Quarter-disk of young Eucope, older than      Fig. 62, with a second set of tentacles (2) between the first set      (1).]        [Illustration: Fig. 64. Magnified quarter-disk of adult Eucope.]    This little Jelly-fish is one of the most common in our Bay. There is  not a night or day when they cannot be taken in large numbers, from  the early spring till late in the autumn; and as the breeding season  lasts during the whole of that period, they are found in all possible  stages of growth. In consequence of this, the course of their  development, and the relation between the different phases of their  existence as Hydroids, and afterwards as Acalephs, are well known,  though the successive steps of their growth have not been traced  connectedly, as in some of the other Jelly-fishes, the Tima or  Melicertum, for instance. The process is, however, so similar  throughout the class of Hydroids, that, having followed it from  beginning to end in some of the groups, we have the key to the history  of others, whose development has not been so fully traced. The eggs  laid by the Eucope in the autumn develop into planulae, which acquire  their full size as Hydroid communities toward the close of the winter,  and the development of the young Medusae upon them, as described above,  begins with the opening spring.      _Oceania_. (_Oceania languida_ A. AG.)    The Oceania (Fig. 68) is so delicate and unsubstantial, that with the  naked eye one perceives it only by the more prominent outlines of its  structure. We may see the outline of the disk, but not the disk  itself; we may trace the four faint thread-like lines produced by the  radiating tubes traversing the disk from the summit to the margin; and  we may perceive, with far more distinctness, the four ovaries attached  to these tubes "]]]
