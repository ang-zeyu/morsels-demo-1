[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3462"],[0,"More Hunting Wasps (#12)"],[1,"suppress my astonishment at the profound  immobility of the prey before my eyes. In the other victims with  flexible skins, Caterpillars, Crickets, Mantes, Ephippigers, I perceived  at least some pulsations of the abdomen, a few feeble contortions under  the stimulus of a needle. There is nothing of the sort here, nothing but  absolute inertia, except in the head, where I see, from time to time,  the mouth-parts open and close, the palpi give a tremor, the short  antennae sway to and fro. A prick with the point of a needle causes no  contraction, no matter what the spot pricked. Though I stab it through  and through, the creature does not stir, be it ever so little. A corpse  is not more inert. Never, since my remotest investigations, have I  witnessed so profound a paralysis. I have seen many wonders due to the  surgical talent of the Wasp; but to-day's marvel surpasses them all.    I am doubly surprised when I consider the unfavourable conditions under  which the Scolia operates. The other paralysers work in the open air, in  the full light of day. There is nothing to hinder them. They enjoy  full liberty of action in seizing the prey, holding it in position and  sacrificing it; they are able to see the victim and to parry its means  of defence, to avoid its spears, its pincers. The spot or spots to be  attained are within their reach; they drive the dagger in without let or  hindrance.    What difficulties, on the other hand, await the Scolia! She hunts  underground, in the blackest darkness. Her movements are laboured and  uncertain, owing to the mould, which is continually giving way all  round her; she cannot keep her eyes on the terrible mandibles, which  are capable of cutting her body in two with a single bite. Moreover,  the Cetonia-grub, perceiving that the enemy is approaching, assumes  its defensive posture, rolls itself up and makes a shield for its only  vulnerable part, the ventral surface, with its convex back. No,  it cannot be an easy operation to subdue the powerful larva in its  underground retreat and to stab with the precision which immediate  paralysis requires.    We wish that we might witness the struggle between the two adversaries  and see at first hand what happens, but we cannot hope to succeed.  It all takes place in the mysterious darkness of the soil; in broad  daylight, the attack would not be delivered, for the victim must remain  where it is and then and there receive the egg, which is unable to  thrive and develop except under the warm cover of vegetable mould. If  direct observation is impracticable, we can at least foresee the main  outlines of the drama by allowing ourselves to be guided by the warlike  manoeuvres of other burrowers.    I picture things thus: digging and rummaging through the heap of mould,  guided perhaps by that singular sensibility of the antennae which  enables the Hairy Ammophila to discover the Grey Worm (The caterpillar  of the Turnip Moth. Cf. \"The Hunting Wasps\": chapters 18 to  20.--Translator's Note.) underground, the Scolia ends by finding a  Cetonia-larva, a good plump one, in the pink of condition, having  reached its full growth, just what the grub which is to feed on it  requires. Forthwith, the assaulted victim, contracting desperately,  rolls itself into a ball. The other seizes it by the skin of the neck.  To unroll it is impossible to the insect, for I myself have some trouble  in doing so. One single point is accessible to the sting: the under part  of the head, or rather of the first segments, which are placed outside  the coil, so that the grub's hard cranium makes a rampart for the hinder  extremity, which is less well defended. Here the Wasp's sting enters and  here only can it enter, within a narrowly circumscribed area. One stab  only of the lancet is given at this point, one only because there is no  room for more; and this is enough: the larva is absolutely paralysed.    The nervous functions are abolished instantly; the muscular contractions  cease; and the animal uncoils like a broken spring. Henceforth  motionless, it lies on its back, its ventral surface fully exposed from  end to end. On the median line of this surface, towards the rear, near  the brown patch due to the alimentary broth contained in the intestine,  the Scolia lays her egg and without more ado, leaves everything lying on  the actual spot where the murder was committed, in order to go in search  of another victim.    This is how the deed must be done: the results prove it emphatically.  But then the Cetonia-grub must possess a very exceptional structure in  its nervous organization. The larva's violent contraction leaves but a  single point of attack open to the sting, the under part of the neck,  which is doubtless uncovered when the victim tries to defend itself  with its mandibles; and yet a stab in this one point produces the most  thorough paralysis that I have ever seen. It is the general rule that  larvae possess a centre of innervation for each segment. This is so  in particular with the Grey Worm, the sacrificial victim of the Hairy  Ammophila. The Wasp is acquainted with this anatomical secret: she stabs  the caterpillar again and again, from end to end, segment by segment,  ganglion by ganglion. With such an organization the Cetonia-grub,  unconquerably coiled upon itself would defy the paralyser's surgical  skill.    If the first ganglion were wounded, the others would remain uninjured;  and the powerful body, actuated by these last, would lose none of its  powers of contraction. Woe then to the egg, to the young grub held fast  in its embrace! And how insurmountable would be the difficulties if the  Scolia, working in the profound darkness amid the crumbling soil and  confronted by a terrible pair of mandibles, had to stab each segment  in turn with her sting, with the certainty of method displayed by the  Ammophila! The delicate operation is possible in the open air, where  nothing stands in the way, in broad daylight, where the sight guides the  scalpel, and with a patient which can always be released if it becomes  dangerous. But in the dark, underground, amidst the ruins of a ceiling  which crumbles in consequence of the conflict and at close quarters with  an opponent greatly her superior in strength, how is the Scolia to guide  her sting with the accuracy that is essential if the stabs are to be  repeated?    So profound a paralysis; the difficulty of vivisection underground;  the desperate coiling of the victim: all these things tell me that the  Cetonia-grub, as regards its nervous system, must possess a structure  peculiar to itself. The whole of the ganglia must be concentrated in a  limited area in the first segments, almost under the neck. I see this  as clearly as though it had been revealed to me by a post-mortem  dissection.    Never was anatomical forecast more fully confirmed by direct  examination. After forty-eight hours in benzine, which dissolves the fat  and renders the nervous system more plainly visible, the Cetonia-grub is  subjected to dissection. Those of my readers who are familiar with these  investigations will understand my delight. What a clever school is the  Scolia's! It is just as I thought! Admirable! The thoracic and abdominal  ganglia are gathered into a single nervous mass, situated within the  quadrilateral bounded by the four hinder legs, which legs are very near  the head. It is a tiny, dull-white cylinder, about three millimetres  long by half a millimetre wide. (.117 x.019 inch.--Translator's Note.)  This is the organ which the Scolia's sting must attack in order to  secure the paralysis of the whole body, excepting the head, which is  provided with special ganglia. From it run numbers of filaments which  actuate the feet and the powerful muscular layer which is the creature's  essential motor organ. When examined merely through the pocket-lens,  this cylinder appears to be slightly furrowed transversely, a proof of  its complex structure. Under the microscope, it is seen to be formed by  the close juxtaposition, the welding, end to end, of the ganglia, which  can be distinguished one from the other by a slight intermediate groove.  The bulkiest are the first, the fourth and the tenth, or last; these are  all very nearly of equal size. The rest are barely half or even a third  as large as those mentioned.    The Interrupted Scolia experiences the same hunting and surgical  difficulties when she attacks, in the crumbling, sandy soil, the  larvae of the Shaggy Anoxia or of the Morning Anoxia, according to the  district; and these difficulties, if they are to be overcome, demand in  the victim a concentrated nervous system, like the Cetonia's. Such is my  logical conviction before making my examination; such also is the result  of direct observation. When subjected to the scalpel, the larva of the  Morning Anoxia shows me its centres of innervation for the thorax and  the abdomen, gathered into a short cylinder, which, placed very far  forward, almost immediately after the head, does not run back beyond the  level of the second pair of legs. The vulnerable point is thus easily  accessible to the sting, despite the creature's posture of defence, in  which it contracts and coils up. In this cylinder I recognize eleven  ganglia, one more than in the Cetonia. The first three, or thoracic,  ganglia are plainly distinguishable from one another, although they are  set very close together; the rest are all in contact. The largest are  the three thoracic ganglia and the eleventh.    After ascertaining these facts, I remembered Swammerdam's investigations  into the grub of the Monoceros, our Oryctes nasicornis. (Jan Swammerdam  (1637-1680), the Dutch naturalist and anatomist.--Translator's Note.) I  chanced to possess an abridgement of the \"Biblia naturae,\" the masterly  work of the father of insect anatomy. I consulted the venerable volume.  It informed me that the learned Dutchman had been struck, long"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34645"],[0,"The History of Painting in Italy, Vol. 3 (of 6) (#12)"],[1,"beautiful  colouring he contrived to bestow upon his pictures, in a degree inferior  to none. From the same source we learn that the year of his decease is  supposed to have been 1529. But Girolamo da' Libri was his superior,  both in point of taste and general celebrity. The son of a miniature  painter of choral books and of anthems, who had hence acquired the name  of Francesco da' Libri, from his father he received both a knowledge of  the art and his surname, both of which he also transmitted to his son,  Francesco, as we again learn from Vasari.    It is not, however, within my province to enter into a consideration of  their books; but in regard to the altarpieces of Girolamo, I cannot  remain silent. That of S. Lionardo, near Verona, I have never seen; a  picture in which the artist having drawn a laurel, the birds are said to  have frequently entered at the church windows, fluttering around as if  wishing to repose in its branches. Another which I beheld at S. Giorgio,  with the date 1529, scarcely retains a trace of the ancient character.  It represents the Virgin between two holy bishops, portraits select and  full of meaning; together with three exquisitely graceful figures of  cherubs, both in face and gesture. In this little picture may be traced,  to a certain degree, the character of a miniaturist who paints, or a  painter drawing miniature; while the charms of the several professions  are seen there exhibited in one point of view. The church, indeed, is a  rich gallery, containing numerous masterpieces of the art; among which  the S. Giorgio of Paolo (Veronese) too far transcends the rest; but the  painting of Girolamo shines almost like a precious jewel, surprising the  spectator by an indescribable union of what is graceful, bright, and  lucid, which it presents to the eye. He survived many years after the  production of this piece, highly esteemed, and in particular for his  miniatures, in which he was accounted the first artist in Italy; and as  if to crown his reputation, he became the instructor, in such art, of  Don Giulio Clovio, a sort of Roscius, if we may so say, of miniature  painting.    However flourishing in valuable masters we may consider the city of  Venice during this era, the fame of Mantegna, with the vicinity of  Mantua, where he taught, attracted thither two artists from Verona, whom  I reserve for that school, of which they were faithful followers. These  were Monsignori, and Gio. Francesco Carotto, formerly a pupil of  Liberale. His brother Giovanni, a noble architect, and designer of  ancient edifices, was but a feeble imitator of his style. He richly  deserves a place in history as the instructor of Paolo, an artist  excellent in many branches of painting, and in architecture almost  divine. It is supposed that Paolo must have acquired this degree of  excellence by studying at first under Carotto, and afterwards perfecting  himself, as we shall shew, by means of Badile. To such as are most known  we might here add names less celebrated, which the Marchese Maffei,  however, has already inserted in his history; as, for instance, a Matteo  Pasti, commended by us in the first volume; but I have, perhaps, already  treated sufficiently of the merits of the old Veronese artists.    About this period there flourished two distinguished artists in Brescia,  who were present at the terrific saccage of that opulent city, in the  year 1512, by Gaston de Foix. One of these is Fioravante Ferramola, who  was honoured and remunerated upon that occasion by the French victor for  his striking merit, and became sufficiently conspicuous in various  churches of the country. His painting of S. Girolamo is seen at Le  Grazie, extremely well conceived, with fine landscape, and in a taste so  like that of Muziano, that we might almost suppose it prognosticated his  appearance. And it might be said that he afforded the latter a  prototype, if he does not aspire to the name of his master. The other is  Paolo Zoppo, who depicted the above desolation of the city in miniature,  upon a large crystal bason; a work of immense labour, intended to be  presented to the doge Gritti: but in transporting it to Venice, the  crystal was unfortunately broken, and the unhappy artist died of  disappointment and despair. The specimens of his style remaining at  Brescia, among which is one of Christ going up to Mount Calvary, at S.  Pietro in Oliveto--a piece falsely attributed by others to Foppa--serve  to shew that he approached near to the modern manner, and was not  unacquainted with the Bellini.    Finally, Bergamo boasted in Andrea Previtali one of the most excellent  disciples of Gian Bellini. He appears, indeed, less animated than his  master, and less correct in the extremities of his figures; neither have  I discovered any of his compositions which are free from the ancient  taste, whether in the grouping of his forms, or in the minute  ornamenting of the accessaries of his art. Nevertheless, in a few  pictures produced, perhaps, later in life, such as his S. Giovanni  Batista, at S. Spirito; his S. Benedetto, in the dome of Bergamo, and  several more in the Carrara Gallery, he very nearly attained to the  modern manner; and was indisputably one of the most distinguished  artists, in point of colours and perspective, belonging to the school of  the Bellini. His Madonnas are held in the highest esteem; in whose  features he appears less a disciple of Gian Bellini, than of Raffaello,  and of Vinci. Two of them at Milan I have seen, both bearing his name:  one is in possession of the Cavalier Melzi; the other in that of Monsig.  Arciprete Rosales, painted in 1522; and both are surrounded with figures  of other saints, portraits executed with discrimination and truth. There  is also a picture of Our Lord announced by the Angel, at Ceneda, a work  so uncommonly beautiful in regard to the two heads, that Titian, in  passing occasionally through the place, is said, according to Ridolfi,  to have repeatedly contemplated it with rapture; charmed by the spirit  of devotion it expressed. Upon the same boundaries, between the ancient  and modern taste, we find various other painters, natives of the valleys  of Bergamo, a fruitful source both of wealth and intellect to the city.  Such is Antonio Boselli,[38] from the Valle Brembana, of whom there has  recently been discovered a fine altarpiece at the Santo of Padua;  besides two other artists of the same vale, who approach even nearer to  the softness, if not to the elegance of Previtali. These are Gian  Giacomo, and Agostino Gavasii di Pascante. We may add to these Jacopo  degli Scipioni, of Averara, and Caversegno, of Bergamo, besides others  handed down to us by Tassi. These, having flourished at a period so  distinguished for the art of colouring, may be compared to certain  writers of the fourteenth century, who throw little light upon learning;  but who, observes Salvini, in respect to language, appear to me as if  every separate page were embued with gold.    I have already pointed out to the reader, the best masters of the  Venetian School, contemporary with, and followers of Gian Bellini; a  number which, though we subtract from it several names of inferior note,  will leave a larger proportion than is generally supposed. The state,  indeed, is full of specimens founded upon his models, the authors of  which remain doubtful; yet it is certain they composed in Bellini's  style, while their designs partake more or less both of the modern and  ancient taste.[39] Undoubtedly, no other school affords a proof of so  great a number of disciples from one master, and following so closely in  his footsteps. Granting this, I cannot easily give credit to the  numerous specimens of Madonnas attributed to his single hand, besides  other pictures in different collections. A cautious judge will not be  apt to pronounce any work his, which displays much of ideal beauty;  Bellini having, for the most part, repeated in his feminine figures an  expression of countenance, partaking in some degree of an apish  character. Nor will he be easily led to ascribe to him pictures which  display a minute care and finish, approaching to the miniature style,  inasmuch as he embodied and coloured his conceptions with a free and  fearless hand. In short, a certain vigour of colour, warm and lively; a  certain reddish tinge of the drapery, approaching a rosy hue; a certain  brightness of varnish, are not the usual characteristics of his hand,  however much his style of design may be mixed up with them; and such  pieces may reasonably be presumed the production of those artists of the  state bordering nearest upon Lombardy, whence, likewise, a few of the  Venetian state derived the mechanical part of their colouring.    Within the limits proposed to myself, I may here annex to my  consideration of the painters in water colours and in oil, other less  distinguished branches of the art. Among these is that species of inlaid  work with wood of different colours, which was intended more  particularly for the ornament of choirs where the divine service was  chaunted. I can trace nothing of its inventors, whether of German or  other origin;[40] though it is said to have taken its rise in an  imitation of mosaic work, and of works in stone. No other coloured woods  besides black and white were at first in use; nor any other objects  beyond large edifices, temples, colonnades, and in short ornaments with  architectural views, attempted to be represented. Brunelleschi at  Florence gave instructions in perspective to architects, that edifices  might be drawn according to good rules; and Massaccio in painting,  greatly availed himself of his precepts, as well as Benedetto da Majano  in his inlaid works. There remain at Florence, as well as other places  in Italy, several ancient choirs very highly prized in that age, but  afterwards despised, when the art of staining wood with boiled water  colours"]]]
