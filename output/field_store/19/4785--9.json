He saw the distant airships, so big  and strong, and led his family away to quieter places, without knowing  at all what the big birds were, or what they meant to do. There was so  much happening in the country that honored him, that Uncle Sam could not  understand!    He did not even know that, far to the northwest, there was a part of the  country called Alaska, where eagles had lived in safety and had brought  up their young in peace long after their haunts in most parts of the  land had been disturbed. He did not know that the government of Alaska  was at that moment paying people fifty cents for every eagle they would  kill, and that in two years about five thousand of these noble birds  were to die in that manner. He did not know that, if such deeds kept on,  before many years there would be no eagles flying proudly through the  air: there would be only pictures of eagles on our money and banners. If  he could have been told what was happening, and that there was danger  that the country would be without a living emblem, and that there might  be only stuffed emblems in museums, would he not have thought, \"Surely  the strong, wise men who go forth to fight for right and liberty will  see that the bird of freedom has a home in their land!\"    No; Uncle Sam knew nothing about such matters, and so he busied his mind  with the things he did know, and was not sad.    He knew where the swamp was, and in the swamp the ducks were thick. They  were good-tasting ducks, and there were so many of them that hunters  with guns and dogs gathered there from all the country round. And the  hunters wounded some birds that the dogs did not get, and these could  not fly off at migrating time.    Now, Uncle Sam and his family found the wounded ducks easy to catch, and  they were nearly as well pleased with them for food as with fish. Of  course their feathers had to be picked off first. No eagle would eat a  duck with his feathers on, any more than you would. And Uncle Sam knew  how to strip off the feathers as well as anyone.    So it was interesting in the swamp, and Uncle Sam and Aunt Samantha and  the twins were satisfied with hunting there when they were not fishing  in the lake.    One day, when Uncle Sam went hunting, he flew near a field where there  was a little lamb; and being a strong and powerful eagle, he was able to  carry it away. Perhaps he felt very proud as he flew off with so much  food at one time. Such strength is something to be pleased with when it  is put to the right use, and getting food is as important for an eagle's  life as it is for a man's.    He lifted his burden high in the air, holding it in his strong talons;  and he did not falter once in his steady flight, although the load  weighed nearly as much as he did, and he carried it two miles without  resting once.    Yes, I think Uncle Sam was proud of that day's hunting and happy with  what he had caught; and the tender meat tasted good to him and his  family.    But the man who had owned the lamb before Uncle Sam caught it was not  pleased. He happened to be coming out of the woods just in time to see  the capture; and an hour later the boy and the girl who lived within  sight of Uncle Sam's nest met the man and saw that he carried a gun.    \"I'm after a white-headed sheep thief,\" he said; \"do you know which way  he flew, after he reached the cliff?\"    The boy's face turned white in a second, and he held his fists together  very still and very tight. The girl looked at her younger brother and  then at the man.    \"Yes, we know,\" she said, \"and we will not tell.\"    \"Why?\" asked the man. \"He took the lamb I was going to roast when it was  big enough.\"    The girl chuckled a little merrily. \"And Uncle Sam got ahead of you,\"  she said. \"Never mind, I'll get the money to pay for his dinner. The  eagles here usually eat fish from the lake, and sometimes game from the  swamp; but once in a very, very long while they take a lamb. When that  happens, the Junior Audubon Society at our school pays for their treat.  I have the money, because I am treasurer.\"    After the girl turned back to the house for the money, the boy looked  hard at the gun. Then he swallowed to get rid of the lump that hurt his  throat and said, \"If you had shot Uncle Sam or Aunt Samantha or their  young, the children for miles and miles NEVER would have liked you.  Eagles have nested in that tree for more than seventy years, and nobody  except a newcomer would think of shooting one.\"    So they talked together for some time about eagles; and when the girl  came back, the man did not charge so much for Uncle Sam's treat as we  sometimes have to pay for our own lamb chops.    And way off among the cliffs Uncle Sam ate in content, not knowing that  his life had been in danger, and that he had been saved by a boy and a  girl who were growing up \"under the shadow of an eagle's wings,\" as they  said to each other as they watched him sail the air in his journeys to  and fro.    That afternoon, when they heard him call, \"Cac, cac, cac,\" they said,  \"Uncle Sam is laughing.\" And when his mate answered in her harsh voice,  they said, \"Aunt Samantha would be happy if she knew we saved their  lives.\"    Busy with the life Nature taught them to live, the twins grew up as  Uncle Sam had grown before them.    As they were hunters, there was nothing more interesting to them than  seeking their food in wild, free places. They had no guns and dogs, but  they caught game in the swamp. They had no cooks to prepare their ducks,  so they picked off the feathers themselves. They had no fish-line and  tackle, but they caught fish in the lake. And in time they caught fish  in the air, too; which was even more thrilling, and a game they came to  enjoy when they overtook the ospreys. Many times, too, they sought the  fish that had been washed up on the lake shore, and so helped keep  things sweet and clean. In this way they were scavengers; and it is  always well to remember that a scavenger, whether he be a bird or beast  or beetle, does great service in the world for all who need pure air to  breathe.    The first year they became bigger than their father, and bigger than  they themselves would be when they were old. At first, too, their eyes  were brown, and not yellow like their father's and mother's. And for two  years their heads and tails were dark, so that they looked much more  like \"golden eagles\" than they did like the old ones of their own kind.    The soldiers at the training-camp caught sight of them now and then, and  named them the \"Yankee-Doodle Twins.\" When the twins were three years  old, their molting season brought a remarkable change to them. The dark  feathers of their heads and necks and tails dropped out, and in their  places white feathers grew, so that by this time they looked like their  own father and mother, who are what is called \"bald eagles,\" though  their heads are not bald at all, but well covered with feathers.    These two birds that were hatched in the home that was more than seventy  years old lived to see the end of the war the young soldiers were  training for when they took their first flights together near the shore  of the same lake. And perhaps they will live to a time when the people  of their country learn to deal more and more justly with each other and  with the great bird of freedom chosen by their forefathers to be the  emblem of their proud land.    Why, indeed, if the boys and girls of the neighborhood keep up a guard  for the protection of Uncle Sam and Aunt Samantha, should they not nest  again, and yet again, in that tree-top home that has been so well taken  care of for more than threescore years and ten; and bring up  Yankee-Doodle Twins for their country in days of peace as they did in  days of war?          VII    CORBIE      Corbie's great-great-grandfather ruled a large flock from his look-out  throne on a tall pine stump, where he could see far and wide, and judge  for his people where they should feed and when they should fly.    His great-grandfather was famous for his collections of old china and  other rare treasures, having lived in the woods near the town dump,  where he picked up many a bright trinket, chief among which was an old  gold-plated watch-chain, which he kept hidden in a doll's red tea-cup  when he was not using it.    His grandfather was a handsome fellow, so glistening that he looked  rather purple when he walked in the sunshine; and he had a voice so  sweet and mellow that any minstrel might have been proud of it, though  he seldom sang, and it is possible that no one but Corbie's grandmother  heard it at its best. He was, moreover, a merry soul, fond of a joke,  and always ready to dance a jig, with a chuckle, when anything very  funny happened in crowdom.    As for the wisdom and beauty of his grandmothers all the way back, there  is so much to be said that, if I once began to tell about them, there  would be no space left for the story of Corbie himself.    [Illustration: _In this Mother Crow had laid her eggs._]    Of course, coming from a family like that, Corbie was sure to be  remarkable; for there is no doubt at all that we inherit many traits of  our ancestors.    Corbie knew very little about his own father and mother, for he was  adopted into a human family when he was ten days old, and a baby at that  age does not remember much.    Although he was too young to realize it, those first ten days after he  had come out of his shell, and those before that, while he was growing  inside his shell, were in some ways the most important of his life, for  it was then that he needed the most tender and skillful care. Well, he  had it; for the gentleness and skill of Father and Mother Crow left  nothing to be desired. They had built the best possible nest for their  needs by placing strong sticks criss-cross high up in an old pine tree.  For a lining they had stripped soft stringy bark from a wild"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2563"],[0,"Memoirs of the Comtesse Du Barry (#12)"],[1,"in doing the same  thing; but as I am no longer of an age to inspire you with the passion  which I should feel towards you, I content myself with your friendship.  I have no enemy here, and no wish to hurt any person. Thus you need not  fear that I shall urge you to any measures that might compromise you. It  is the hatred of the kingdom that you will have to fear. France is about  to march in a better track, and the best plan is to follow its lead.  It pains me, madame, to use language which may appear severe to you; we  ought only to talk to you of your beauty and the love which it inspires.  But in your situation, even that beauty may serve the interests of  France, and it is for that motive that I come to solicit you.\"    I replied to M. de Chauvelin with equal frankness. I told him that my  sole intentions were to confine myself to the circle of my duties; that  I had none but to please the king, and no intention of mixing myself  up with state affairs. This was my plan I can assure you. I flattered  myself that I could follow it, not dreaming of those political nuisances  into which I was precipitated in spite of myself. I added, nevertheless,  that in my situation, which was delicate, I would not refuse the  counsels of a faithful servant of the king, and that under this title M.  de Chauvelin should be consulted on important occasions.    The marquis de Chauvelin had too much good sense, too much knowledge of  the world, not to perceive a refusal concealed under this politeness.  The secret inclination of my heart had already led me to select the duc  d'Aiguillon for my director, and I could not reconcile myself to any  other. He contented himself with asking me again for my friendship,  which I willingly accorded him, and I have always found myself fortunate  in his. Thus did I accept the offers of service from the prince de  Soubise, the duc de la Vauguyon, and the marquis de Chauvelin.    A fourth sought to swell the ranks; the comte, afterwards prince, de  Montbarrey. This gentleman made up in pretensions for what he lacked  in talent. He was weak, self-important, selfish, fond of women, and  endeavored to preserve all the airs of a man of good breeding in the  midst of the grossest debauchery. He was full of respect for himself and  his house, of which in time of need he could cite the whole genealogy.  His nomination was a real scandal; no one dreamt of his ever being  minister of war. It was one of the thousand follies of old Maurepas,  whom the late king knew well, and called the ballad-maker of the  council.    The comte de Montbarrey, whom I had known at Paris, came to me one fine  day, fully powdered, performed, and apparelled. He had a smile on  his lip, a loud tone, and an insolent look. He came not to ask  my friendship, but my obedience. He told me that he loved me to  distraction, and of course my head must be equally towards him. He  amused me. I let him run out the full length of his line; and when he  had spun it all out, I said to him, \"Monsieur, be so good as to call me  to the recollection of madame de Merfort.\"    She was one of the gambling ladies, and at her house I had formerly met  the chevalier de Montbarrey. My reply confounded him: he saw that he had  gone the wrong way to work with me; and, raising the siege, he left me  excessively embarrassed.    Figure to yourself, my friend, what confidence a man, lost in the  crowd of lower courtiers, could inspire me with; for to judge of the  proceedings of the comte de Montbarrey, it would have been necessary  to have seen him as he then was, and not what he became since the  imbecility of M. de Maurepas. When I told comte Jean of his visit, he  would not believe such insolence. You must know that my brother-in-law  also wished to direct me, but I did not consider him sufficiently  clever. His marvellous genius was eclipsed in politics. He swore at my  ingratitude, and I could only appease him by an offering of plenty of  money.    In the midst of this cross-fire of intrigues, one was devised against me  which might have terminated in my ruin; but, thanks to the indefatigable  activity of comte Jean, only served to fix me more firmly in my  situation. Lebel, of whom I have said nothing for this age, came to me  one day: his face was sad, and his look serious. By his manner I augured  that my reign had passed, and that I must quit my post. I awaited what  he should say with mortal impatience. At length he began thus:    \"Madame, you have many bitter enemies, who are laboring to effect your  ruin with a blood-thirstiness which nothing can assuage. They have now  spread a report that you are not married. This infamous calumny--\"    \"Ah, is that all?\" said I with joy; \"no, my dear Lebel, this time they  do not calumniate me. The worthy creatures for once are right.\"    \"What,\" said Lebel, in a tone of alarm almost comic, \"what, are you  really not married?\"    \"No.\"    \"Are you not the wife of the comte Guillaume du Barry?\"    \"No.\"    \"Then you have deceived the king, and played with me.\"    \"Lebel, my friend, take another tone. No one has any right to complain.  You have given me to the king as a person to please him; I do so. The  rest can be no matter of yours.\"    \"Pardon me, madame; it is a matter of the greatest consequence to me. I  am terribly compromised in this affair, and you with me.\"    Lebel told me that the duchesse de Grammont had begged him to call upon  her, and had bitterly reproached him about the mistress he had procured  for the king; the duchesse affirmed that I was a nameless and unmarried  creature; and added, that it was his duty to make the king acquainted  with these particulars, unless I, the pretended wife of du Barry, would  consent to go to England when a large pension should be assured to me.    \"No, my dear Lebel, I will not go to England; I will remain in France,  at Versailles, at the chateau. If I am not married I will be; the thing  is easily managed.\"    Lebel, somewhat assured, begged me to send for comte Jean, and when he  came he (Lebel) recommenced his tale of grief.    \"You are drowning yourself in a glass of water,\" said my future  brother-in-law to him, beginning to treat him with less ceremony; \"go  back to the duchesse de Grammont, and tell her that madame was married  at Toulouse. She will have an inquiry set on foot; in the mean while my  brother will arrive, and the marriage will take place. Then we will show  the rebels a real comtesse du Barry; and whether my sister-in-law be  a lady of six months' standing or only of yesterday, that is of no  consequence to the king of France.\"    After this conversation Lebel delivered the message to the duchesse  de Grammont, who told him that she should write to Toulouse to the  attorney-general. This was what the comte Jean wished and he was  prepared for her.    But, you will say to me, was it certain that your asserted husband would  marry you? Were there no difficulties to fear? None. Comte Guillaume was  poor, talented, and ambitious; he liked high living, and would have sold  himself to the devil for riches. He was happy in marrying me. Comte Jean  would not have ventured such a proposal to his other brother, the comte  d'Hargicourt, who had much good sense and great notions of propriety,  and who at Versailles was called the _honnete homme_; a distinction not  over flattering to his two brothers.    The same evening the whole family arrived, and was presented to me the  next day. My two future sisters-in-law frightened me at first with their  provincial manners and southern accent; but, after a few minutes,  I found that this Gascon pronunciation had many charms with it.  Mesdemoiselles du Barry were not handsome but very agreeable. One was  called Isabelle, whom they had nicknamed _Bischi_, the other's name was  Fanchon, and her name had been abbreviated to \"_Chon_.\" The latter had  much talent, and even brought to Versailles with her, an instinctive  spirit of diplomacy which would have done honor to a practised courtier.  She would have been thought simple, unsophisticated, and yet was full of  plot and cunning.    I was soon much pleased with her, and the king became equally so. He was  always very much amused at hearing her talk _patois_ (provincially), or  recite the verses of one Gondouli, a poet of Languedoc. He used to make  her jump upon his knees; and altho' she had passed the first bloom  of youth, he played with her like a child. But what most particularly  diverted the king, was calling my sister-in-law by her nickname;  \"_Petite Chon, grande Chon_,\" he was always saying, \"do this, go there,  come here.\" Louis XV did the same with his own daughters: he had amongst  them a _Loque_, a _Graille_, a _Chiffe_, and they were the ladies  Victoire, Adelaide, and Sophie, whom he thus elegantly designated. I so  soon saw the taste of the king for nicknames that I gave him one, it  was Lafrance. So far from being angry with me, he laughed to tears  every time that I called him so. I must confess, _en passant_, that  the anecdote about the coffee is true.* I will only justify myself by  saying, that if I expressed myself coarsely it was not in consequence  of my vulgar education, but because the king liked such modes of  expression.         *Louis XV had a habit of making his own coffee after dinner.       One day the coffee boiled over the sides of the pot, and       madame du Barry cried out, \"Eh, Lafrance, ton cafe f --- le       camp.\"  (author)    Let me revert to my marriage, which was performed secretly at the parish  of Saint Laurent. I believe the king knew of it, altho' he never alluded  to it any more than myself. Thus the malice of my enemies was completely  balked in this affair. Some days afterwards comte Jean received a letter  from the attorney-general of the parliament of Toulouse, M. the marquis  de Bonrepos-Riquet. This gentleman informed my brother-in-law that he  had been applied to, to institute an"]]]
