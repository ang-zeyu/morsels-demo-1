[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34076"],[0,"Fox Trapping: A Book of Instruction Telling How to Trap, Snare, Poison and Shoot (#12)"],[1," you will see that I have touched nothing with my hands and  never stepped out of my tracks setting trap.      * * *    The fox is, without doubt, the most cunning of all cunning animals we  trappers have to trap, says an Eastern trapper. Many times have I  been to my fox traps to find one or so turned bottom side up and no  fox. A fox will reach into a bed and take your bait with his paw, and  I have trapped them when actions said plain as words, \"you can't fool  me.\"    I find the No. 1 1/2 Newhouse a very good trap for the fox,  especially in early fall when the ground don't freeze. A fox will  start on his nightly rounds and frequent small clearings in woods,  sandy side hills and such places, and that is the place a trapper  wants a few tanglefoot. I have trapped fox for quite a number of  years, and I never caught one by accident yet. I always have to set  for fox and fox only.    In regard to poisoning, I think that a man that uses it ought to be  shot full of holes. In regard to iron smell, I will say that fox can  smell iron, but bury your trap deep enough and you will be all right.  A good scent is as follows: Take skunk essence, white of eggs, and  let stand about one week. Use about five drops and I will warrant it  to be the best fox scent made.      * * *    We all know it's difficult to catch the fox on dry land, although it  is done, says a New England trapper. There are thousands of fox who  fall victims to this way, and I believe it a more successful method  than any in existence. I shall recommend a spring to set your trap in  because the water does not rise or fall much, like a brook. Carefully  dig out your spring in July or August, arranging it so that you will  have it ready by fall, by placing a flat stone about fifteen inches  from the stone so it will project above water about one inch; on top  of this place a sod about three inches thick if possible, and have  the edges come into the water so it will look natural. Cut your sods  that you are to fix inside the trap, and lay up to dry when you  prepare your place.    When the time is ready for setting your trap, go to the place by  walking up the outlet of the spring or brook, using the greatest  care, and not touch the brushes or anything around the trap; place  your trap very near the edge of the spring, about six or eight inches  from the sod; have the trap entirely under water, and place your sod,  cut for the purpose, on the pan, have it cover all the space inside  the trap, and be sure it is out of water enough to offer a dry  footing for the fox, and not over two inches from the shore.    Some have the shore cut out so half the trap is on apparently dry  land. Either way is all right. Place your bait on the side of the  sod, using scent and being sure that your bait or scent cannot be  reached except by the fox stepping on the pan of the trap, and you  will get your fox.    When you visit your trap do not go too near, as all these things have  their effect. I should recommend for bait cat or muskrat, a piece  half the size of an egg is all right. It should be prepared by  placing in a perfectly clean jar the number of bait you wish, and  allow to taint, putting the scent in with the bait, or dropping on  the bait after you place on sod. You must use the greatest care in  handling your bait. Do not take out or place on the bait with your  bare hands. Use a stick.      [Illustration: NEW ENGLAND TRAPPERS CATCH.]    I have been waiting for some of the fox trappers of the Red River  Valley, says a Minnesota trapper, to write and tell us how they  manage to pinch Mr. Reynard's toes. I think we have a harder place  here to trap fox than you Eastern fellows have. The country is just  as level as a board and no timber, and we are liable to have a  blizzard any hour. What makes it hard to trap is that the traps  always blow in if you haven't got them in a good place. I have quite  a trick to catch the fox, at least I have had the best luck with it.  I first find a place where an old straw pile was burned, then smear  my traps with blood and hide them good in ashes, erase all of my  tracks and drop a few spirits of anise oil all around. For bait I  generally use the entrails of a hog or beef. Last winter I caught two  without any bait; just the oil. Last winter I had good luck with dead  chickens. I always staple my traps to a clog of about twelve or  fifteen pounds weight. On this clog I nailed the chicken and I got  every fox that came around.    I only trapped one month with two traps, No. 2 Newhouse, and I got 6  fox and 1 wolf, and that was all the fox there were inside of about  three or four miles, and I didn't have time to go further because I  am a farmer and have my stock to tend.      * * *    If you know where there is a meadow with hay or straw stacked out on  it, says Austin Palin, of Indiana, and if you will go to this stack  after a little snow and there has been a fox in the field, he will be  pretty sure to have gone to the stack to nose around. I first go and  catch some fish about 6 or 8 inches long. I generally get suckers. I  now clean my traps by boiling them in weak lye, then reboil them in  evergreen boughs. I think it advisable to run beeswax over your trap,  but I have had success without the beeswax.    After you have your traps cleaned and fixed do not handle them with  your bare hands but put on a pair of gloves, take your trap and fish  and a piece of wood about 4 feet long and the thickness of your arm  and go to the stack. Now raise up the edge of the hay at the ground  and slip the fish (one will be enough) back under the hay 6 or 8  inches, then set your trap directly in front of it, covering with the  fine chaff; now fasten the trap chain to the piece of wood and slip  the stick back under the stack, working it around a little so when  the fox gets fast he can pull it out easily. Now take a stick and  straighten out the hay over the trap and scratch out all signs and  your set is complete. Make the above set when there is no snow.      * * *    We trapped foxes by baiting in beds mostly, says a Michigan trapper,  though we caught five in the following manner: A wounded deer had  fallen near two down trees which lap with tops crossed. We drew the  deer into the apex or pen, as we noticed that foxes had been visiting  the carcass. We cut notches out of these trees which were old and  moss-covered, and set traps in the places prepared, covering neatly  with moss.    Foxes are prone to walk convenient logs investigating anything that  attracts them, and rarely look for danger under foot if the trap has  been well placed and cleverly hidden. We smoked our traps and handled  them with mittens.      * * *    The red fox is the only species that abounds in this locality, says  Wm. Muchon, of Minnesota. When run by the hounds he usually keeps  half a mile ahead, regulating his speed by that of the hounds,  occasionally pausing a moment to divert himself with a mouse or to  contemplate the landscape or to listen for his pursuer.    A most spirited and exciting chase occurs when the dogs gets close  upon one in the open field. The fox relies so confidently upon his  superior speed that I imagine he half tempts the dog to the race, but  if he be a smart dog, and their course lies down hill over smooth  ground, Reynard must put his best foot forward and then sometimes  suffers the ignominy of being run over by his pursuer, who, however,  is quite unable to pick him up, owing to the speed. But uphill and in  the woods the superior nimbleness and agility of the fox tells at  once.    Carry the carcass of a pig or a fowl to a distant field in  mid-winter, and in a few nights his tracks cover the snow about it. The  inexperienced youth, misled by this seeming carelessness of Reynard,  suddenly conceives a project to enrich himself with fur, and wonders  why the idea has not occurred to him before and to others. I knew a  youthful yeoman of this kind who imagined he had found a mine of  wealth discovering on a remote side hill between two woods a dead  porker, upon which it appeared all the foxes of the neighborhood did  nightly banquet.    The clouds were burdened with snow and as the first flakes began to  eddy down he set out, trap and broom in hand, already counting over  in imagination the silver quarters he would receive for the first fox  skin. With the utmost care and with a palpitating heart he removed  enough of the trodden snow to allow the trap to sink below the  surface. The next morning at dawn he was on his way to bring his fur.  The snow had done its work effectually, and he believed had kept his  secret well.    Approaching nearer, the surface was unbroken, and doubt usurped the  place of certainty in his mind. A slight wound marked the side of the  porker, but there was no footprint near it. Looking up the hill, he  saw where Reynard had walked leisurely down toward his wanted bacon  till within a few yards when he had wheeled, and with prodigious  strides disappeared in the woods. The stream of silver quarters  suddenly set in another direction.    The successful trapper commences in the fall, or before the first  deep snow. In a field not too remote with an old axe he cuts a small  place, say ten inches by fourteen in the frozen ground, and removes  the earth to the depth of three or four inches, then fills the cavity  with dry ashes in which are placed bits of roasted cheese. Reynard is  very suspicious and gives the place a wide berth, but the cheese is  savory and the cold severe. He ventures a little closer every night  until he can reach and pick out a piece from the ashes, and finding a  fresh supply of the delectable morsels every night is soon thrown off  his guard and his suspicions lulled.    After a week of baiting in this way, the trapper carefully conceals  his trap in the bed, first smoking it thoroughly with hemlock boughs  so as to kill all smell of iron. If the weather favors, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34093"],[0,"Mink Trapping: A Book of Instruction Giving Many Methods of Trapping (#12)"],[1,"traps with leaves, grass or fine rubbish.    This method is very successful for mink, and in fact for almost any  fur bearing animal that travels up and down a creek, says an Illinois  trapper. The first thing to do is to set your trap near the shore so  it will be about two inches under water. Stake the trap or fasten it  to a drag, just as you like. The trap should be a No. 1 1/2 or you  can set two or three No. 1 traps together. Now after the trap is set,  get some weeds or brush and begin at the trap and make a V shaped  pen, leaving an opening where the trap is about ten inches wide if  you are trapping for coon. The brush or weeds, whichever is used,  should extend several feet from the trap in either direction.    After you are through it should be like illustration No. 1. This, we  will suppose, is for catching animals coming down the creek. Now go  down the creek a few rods and set another trap, but have the narrow  opening of the pen pointing up the creek, as in the illustration No.  2, which will catch an animal traveling up the creek. If these pens  are made right, then a mink will walk into the pens and through the  opening nine times out of ten instead of walking around them. Try  this method once and be convinced. These pens should be about a foot  high.      [Illustration: NORTHWEST TRAPPER AND MINK.]    If brush is used it should be fine so it will lie close together so a  mink cannot pass through. If there is danger of the creek washing the  brush away, then fasten it by driving a few small stakes in the  ground to hold it.    Remember that no bait or scent should be used. If footprints are left  on the ground, then splash water on them. Remember that half of the  pen is on the shore and the other half is in the creek, providing the  creek is a wide one; this depends on the width of the creek. It is a  good idea to trap on both sides of a creek; one is sure then of  catching an animal whether it goes down on one side or the other.  This is the only method I use and it has proven to be successful.    If a mink is hungry and finds bait that has been left for him he will  pay no attention to human scent, while if he is not hungry he will  not take the bait be it ever so fresh. A mink will sometimes make a  trail in the fresh snow by passing several times over the same route  and then never use that trail again. I have known otter to do the  same.    I caught two mink last winter in a ditch, setting trap in the water.  The first night I caught a medium sized mink and the third night I  caught a small one, and would have caught every mink that went up  that ditch if it had not frozen up and snowed so during the time that  I could not keep the traps properly set.    If a person sets out a line of traps in this country, Iowa, while  there is snow on the ground, he is simply going to a great deal of  trouble to give them to some one.    In trapping mink I watch for signs, and when I locate a mink I  consider it mine and it generally is, while if you bait up a trap  somewhere that you may think is a good place to catch a mink, it  often happens that you may make a good many trips to your trap before  you get a mink, and you may say to yourself that it is human scent  that keeps them away, when perhaps there has not been a mink near the  trap. My advice to young trappers is not to set where a mink may go  but set it where you know he is going, and you will find it no trick  to catch mink.    I have many different ways of trapping the mink, says a Pennsylvania  trapper, as I set my traps only where I see their signs, and as the  signs are often different, and found in different kinds of places,  one way is not enough. I use Blake & Lamb No. 1 traps mostly for  mink. I never stake a trap down except in water set. On dry land I  fasten to a brush clog.    If one sets only where he sees the signs, and only sets one or two  traps for each mink, from one to two dozen traps are all that are  required. In fall and early winter I set my traps is natural  enclosures in old drifts, in hollow logs, under roots of trees, etc.,  baiting with fresh muskrat, fish, rabbit, chicken, mice or birds,  using fish oil or muskrat musk for scent.    I do not believe in using mixed scents. In late winter and early  spring I set traps in the same kind of places but without bait, using  the musk of mink for scent. The mink is not looking for food then,  and such scents as fish-oil and muskrat musk are not as good as the  musk of the mink itself.    The traps should always be covered with some light substance, which  will not look out of place. Never smoke your traps, boil them in  walnut hulls, maple bark or sweet fern. Mink may also be caught by  tying a rabbit in a shunk of a hollow log, blocking one end shut and  setting his trap in the other end.    When streams are open the shyest mink may be caught by putting  several small live fish on a string and stretching the string in a V  shaped enclosure, in shallow water, setting the trap at the open end.  Mink are easily caught by setting the trap at the foot of a steep  bank which they use. If the trap is properly set, the bank will guide  the mink into the trap.    There are many other ways of trapping the mink, where the signs are  different, and found in different places. An experienced trapper can  trace a mink for miles, where another person would not see a sign. A  trapper must be able to read signs as he would read a book. As to  human scent, that is all nonsense. The scent will not hang to the  trap or bait more than a couple of hours.    I find a stream where mink frequent, look for tracks either in or out  of water, close to edge, however, says an Arkansas trapper. Now don't  set your trap on a track thinking you will get a mink, but look for a  slide; mink have a slide same as otter; don't set on slide but go  above slide along bank where water is not over four inches deep. Set  a No. 1 or 1 1/2 trap, cover spring, don't disturb bank but just lay  a small pole, attach your trap chain to this, cover trap and chain  with old wet leaves. Don't take your hands, get a stick and rake the  leaves over it, and do not let any one cause you to think that mink  are not afraid of human scent. Be sure to crowd your trap against  bank as a mink travels close to the bank. This is one way.    Another is, find a tree that has the earth washed away from the roots  to the water, it being right against the bank, look in the shallow  water around roots for mink tracks, if any, set trap. Again crowd  bank with trap and you may expect mink from under that tree.    Another way is in looking along the bank of stream you will notice  small holes straight back in bank just under water, extending back  perhaps 4 or 6 inches; a mink did it. Look a little further and you  will see a hole extending back in bank. It may be 6 or 8 inches  across, extending back to 4 to 8 inches. Every time a mink travels  this stream he visits these holes. He dug them to get crabs and small  fish to bed in them. He catches them on his rounds. Now set a trap at  mouth of hole and you can get a mink.      [Illustration: NORTHERN MINK TRAPPER'S SHANTY.]    I have used bait. When I do I prefer red bird or woodpecker. Fix your  bait always so mink cannot get at it without crossing or getting over  trap. I believe this is sufficient, however, an old trapper or an  experienced one needs no pointers, he will get the game.    Two years ago last fall I had a line of traps consisting of a few fox  traps and the rest mink traps, about fifteen in all, says a Maine  trapper. My partner, Dan, was a very young trapper, having caught  only a few mink and skunk. I would rather have trapped alone, but as  I was just starting in I thought I would rather have some one with me  that knew a little more about it. So one November morning we started  out all aglow and pushed on by the cool morning air we set the above  named traps and returned home very tired and weary, but the thought  of bringing back a fox or a nice mink the next day gave me more life,  and I retired happy enough for my day's work.    The next morning we were up early and made our rounds, but to our  great disappointment we found that we had only a skunk and a striped  one at that, but we didn't lose heart at that but kept right on, now  and then changing a trap or two.    At last one morning my partner said to me, \"I think I have found out  what the trouble is with our trapping.\" \"That's good,\" I said, \"tell  me about it.\" \"Well,\" went on Dan, \"you see all the traps we've got  set on that brook are along the banks. Well now the stream is all  frozen over tight so that nothing can get into the brook from the  outside, so I don't see why a mink coming, up that brook under the  ice--for under the ice they must come or we would see their tracks  somewhere along the bank--can smell the bait on the outside, so what  I think best is this: Take an axe and cut a long hole about 8 inches  wide clear across the brook. Now get some sticks about 3 or 4 feet  long, it all depends on the depth of the water, and drive them into  the mud, beginning at one side of the brook. Now drive until you get  to the middle of the brook, then do the same on the other side,  leaving a place about the width of the trap in the middle. Care must  be taken to get sticks near enough together so he can't get through  only just at the middle. Now if the water is very deep so he can't  get through only just at the middle, we can build up until about to  the surface or say 4 inches from the surface. Now set your trap on  the thing you have built up, and just between the posts, and I think  you will have him.\"    This advice was acted upon at once and the next morning we had a fine  mink measuring about 28 inches. The next morning we had another and  in a few mornings another, and so on until we had caught just nine  mink from that place.    Some trappers say it is hard to catch mink, others say that"]]]
