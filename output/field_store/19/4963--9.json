This colouring of white should be fully borne in mind  when crossing colours in breeding, as the results are widely different  from the two varieties. The whole colour yellow-white will not do to  match with blue or gray, as it will assuredly give the wrong tinge or  colour.    The eyes should be blue; green is a great defect; bright yellow is  allowable, or what in horses is called \"wall eyes.\" Orange gives a heavy  appearance; but yellow will harmonise and look well with a gray-white.    White cats with blue eyes are hardy. Mr. Timbs, in \"Things Not Generally  Known,\" relates that even they are not so likely to be deaf as is  supposed, and mentions one of seventeen years old which retained its  hearing faculties perfectly. Some specimens I have seen with one yellow  eye and one blue; this is a most singular freak of nature, and to the  best of my knowledge is not to be found among any of the other colours.    It is stated that one of the white horses recently presented by the Shah  of Persia to the Emperor of Russia has blue eyes. I can scarcely credit  this, but think it must be a true albino, with the gray-pink coloured  eyes they generally have, or possibly the blue eye is that peculiar to  the _albino_ cat and horse, as I have never seen an albino horse or cat  with pink eyes but a kind of opalesque colour, or what is termed \"wall  eye.\" No doubt many of my readers have observed the differences in the  white of our horses, they mostly being the gray-white, with dark skin;  but the purer white has a pink skin, and is much softer and elegant in  appearance. It is the same with our white cats.          THE BLACK CAT.      It is often said \"What's in a name?\" the object, whatever it is, by any  other would be the same, and yet there is much in a name; but this is  not the question at issue, which is that of colour. Why should a _black_  cat be thought so widely different from all others by the foolish,  unthinking, and ignorant? Why, simply on account of its colour being  black, should it have ascribed to it a numberless variety of bad omens,  besides having certain necromantic power? In Germany, for instance,  black cats are kept away from children as omens of evil, and if a black  cat appeared in the room of one lying ill it was said to portend death.  To meet a black cat in the twilight was held unlucky. In the \"good old  times\" a black cat was generally the only colour that was favoured by  men reported to be wizards, and also were said to be the constant  companions of reputed witches, and in such horror and detestation were  they then held that when the unfortunate creatures were ill-treated,  drowned, or even burned, very frequently we are told that their cats  suffered martyrdom at the same time. It is possible that one of the  reasons for such wild, savage superstition may have arisen from the fact  of the larger amount of electricity to be found by friction in the coat  of the black cat to any other; experiments prove there is but very  little either in that of the white or the red tabby cat. Be this as it  may, still the fact remains that, for some reason or other, the black  cat is held by the prejudiced ignorant as an animal most foul and  detestable, and wonderful stories are related of their actions in the  dead of the night during thunder-storms and windy nights. Yet, as far as  I can discover, there appears little difference either of temper or  habit in the black cat distinct from that of any other colour, though it  is maintained by many even to this day that black cats are far more  vicious and spiteful and of higher courage, and this last I admit.  Still, when a black cat is enraged and its coat and tail are well \"set  up,\" its form swollen, its round, bright, orange-yellow eye distended  and all aglow with anger, it certainly presents to even the most  impartial observer, to say the least of it, a most \"uncanny\" appearance.  But, for all this, their admirers are by no means few; and, to my  thinking, a jet-black cat, fine and glossy in fur and elegantly formed,  certainly has its attractions; but I will refer to the superstitions  connected with the black cat further on.    A black cat for show purposes should be of a uniform, intense black; a  brown-black is richer than a blue-black. I mean by this that when the  hair is parted it should show in the division a dark brown-black in  preference to any tint of blue whatever. The coat or fur should be  short, velvety, and very glossy. The eyes round and full, and of a deep  orange colour; nose black, and also the pads of the feet; tail long,  wide at the base, and tapering gradually towards the end. A long thin  tail is a great fault, and detracts much from the merits it may  otherwise possess. A good, deep, rich-coloured black cat is not so  common as many may at first suppose, as often those that are said to be  black show tabby markings under certain conditions of light; and, again,  others want depth and richness of colour, some being only a very dark  gray. In form it is the same as other short-haired cats, such as I have  described in the white, and this brings me to the variety called  \"blue.\"    [Illustration: ARCHANGEL BLUE CAT.]          THE BLUE CAT.      This is shown often under a number of names. It was at first shown as  the Archangel cat, then Russian blue, Spanish blue, Chartreuse blue,  and, lastly, and I know not why, the American blue. It is not, in my  belief, a distinct breed, but merely a light-coloured form of the black  cat. In fact, I have ascertained that one shown at the Crystal Palace,  and which won many prizes on account of its beautiful blue colour  slightly tinged with purple, was the offspring of a tabby and white  she-cat and a black-and-white he-cat, and I have seen the same colour  occur when bred from the cats usually kept about a farmhouse as a  protection from rats and mice, though none of the parents had any blue  colour.    Being so beautiful, and as it is possible in some places abroad it may  be bred in numbers, I deemed it advisable, when making out the prize  schedule, to give special prizes for this colour; the fur being used for  various purposes on account of its hue. A fine specimen should be even  in colour, of a bluish-lilac tint, with no sootiness or black, and  though light be firm and rich in tone, the nose and pads dark, and the  eyes orange-yellow. If of a very light blue-gray, the nose and pads may  be of a deep chocolate colour and the eyes deep yellow, not green. If it  is a foreign variety, I can only say that I see no distinction in form,  temper, or habit; and, as I have before mentioned, it is sometimes bred  here in England from cats bearing no resemblance to the bluish-lilac  colour, nor of foreign extraction or pedigree. I feel bound, however, to  admit that those that came from Archangel were of a deeper, purer tint  than the English cross-breeds; and on reference to my notes, I find they  had larger ears and eyes, and were larger and longer in the head and  legs, also the coat or fur was excessively short, rather inclined to  woolliness, but bright and glossy, the hair inside the ears being  shorter than is usual in the English cat.    [Illustration]      [Illustration]          THE BLACK-AND-WHITE CAT.      This is distinct from the _white-and-black_ cat, the ground colour being  black, marked with white; while the other is white, marked with black.  The chief points of excellence for show purposes are a dense bright  brown-black, evenly marked with white. Of this I give an illustration,  showing the most approved way in which the white should be distributed,  coming to a point between the eyes. The feet should be white, and the  chest, the nose, and the pads white. No black on the lips or nose,  whiskers white, eyes of orange yellow. Any black on the white portions  is highly detrimental to its beauty and its chance of a prize.    The same markings are applicable to the brown tabby and white, the dark  tabby and white, the red tabby and white, the yellow tabby and white,  the blue or silver tabby and white, and the blue and white. One great  point is to obtain a perfectly clear and distinct gracefully-curved  outline of colour, and this to be maintained throughout; the blaze on  the forehead to be central. It is stated that if a dog has white  anywhere, he is sure to have a white tip to his tail, and I think, on  observation, it will be found usually the case, although this is not so  in the cat, for I cannot call to mind a single instance where a  black-and-white had a white tip to its tail; but taking the various  colours of the domestic cat into consideration I think it will be found  that there is a larger number with some white about them than those of  entirely one colour, without even a few white hairs, which if they  appear at all are mostly to be found on the chest, though they often are  exceedingly few in number.    [Illustration: MRS. VYVYAN'S ROYAL CAT OF SIAM.]      [Illustration]        THE WHITE-AND-BLACK CAT.      This differs entirely from the black-and-white cat, as just explained,  and is the opposite as regards colour, the ground being white instead of  black, and the markings black on white. For exhibition purposes and  points of excellence, no particular rule exists beyond that the exhibit  shall be evenly marked, with the colour distributed so as to balance,  as, for example:--If a cat has a black patch just _under_ one eye with a  _little above_, the balance of colour would be maintained if the other  eye had a preponderance of colour _above_ instead of _below_, and so  with the nose, shoulders, or back, but it would be far better if the  patches of colour were the same size and shape, and equal in position.  It might be that a cat evenly marked on the head had a mark on the left  shoulder with more on the right, with a rather larger patch on the right  side of the loin, or a black tail would help considerably to"]]]
