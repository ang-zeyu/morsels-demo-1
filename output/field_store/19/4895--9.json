[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31103"],[0,"A Christmas Greeting: A Series of Stories (#12)"],[1," the farm-yard an old man, who knew how to make  shaving-soap and soap for washing, in square cakes as well as in round  balls. He was a merry, wandering old man. When he saw the sparrow that  the boys had caught, and which, as they said, they did not care about  at all, he asked, \"Shall we make something very fine of him?\" Mamma  sparrow felt an icy coldness creep over her. Out of the box, in which  were the most beautiful colors, the old man took a quantity of gold  leaf, and the boys were obliged to go and fetch the white of an egg,  with which the sparrow was painted all over; on this the gold was  stuck, and mamma sparrow was now entirely gilded; but she did not  think of adornment, for she trembled in every limb. And the  soap-dealer tore a bit off the lining of his old jacket, cut scollops  in it so that it might look like a cock's comb, and stuck it on the  head of the bird.    \"Now, then, you shall see master gold-coat fly,\" said the old man, and  let the sparrow go, who, in deadly fright, flew off, illumined by the  beaming sun. How she shone! All the sparrows, even a crow, although an  old fellow, were much frightened at the sight; they, however flew on  after him, in order to learn what foreign bird it was.    Impelled by anguish and terror, he flew homewards: he was near falling  exhausted to the earth. The crowd of pursuing birds increased; yes,  some indeed even tried to peck at him.    \"Look! there's a fellow! Look! there's a fellow!\" screamed they all.    \"Look! there's a fellow! Look! there's a fellow!\" cried the young  sparrows, as the old one approached the nest. \"That, for certain, is a  young peacock; all sorts of colors are playing in his feathers: it  quite hurts one's eyes to look at him, just as our mother told us.  Chirp! chirp! That is the beautiful!\" And now they began pecking at  the bird with their little beaks, so that it was quite impossible for  the sparrow to get into the nest: she was so sadly used that she could  not even say \"Chirrup,\" still less, \"Why, I am your own mother!\" The  other birds, too, now set upon the sparrow, and plucked out feather  after feather; so that at last she fell bleeding in the rose-bush  below.    \"Oh! poor thing!\" said all the roses, \"be quieted; we will hide you.  Lean your little head on us.\"    The sparrow spread out her wings once more, then folded them close to  her body, and lay dead in the midst of the family who were her  neighbors,--the beautiful fresh roses.    \"Chirp! chirp!\" sounded from the nest. \"Where can our mother be? It is  quite inconceivable! It cannot surely be a trick of hers by which she  means to tell us that we are now to provide for ourselves? She has  left us the house as an inheritance; but to which of us is it  exclusively to belong, when we ourselves have families'?\"    \"Yes, that will never do that you stay here with me when my household  is increased by the addition of a wife and children,\" said the  smallest.    \"I shall have, I should think, more wives and children than you,\" said  the second.    \"But I am the eldest,\" said the third. They all now grew passionate;  they beat each other with their wings, pecked with their beaks, when,  plump! one after the other was tumbled out of the nest. There they lay  with their rage; they turned their heads on one side, and winked their  eyes as they looked upward: that was their way of playing the  simpleton. They could fly a little, and by practice they learned to do  so still better; and they finally were unanimous as to a sign by  which, when at some future time they should meet again in the world,  they might recognise each other. It was to consist in a \"Chirrup!\" and  in a thrice-repeated scratching on the ground with the left leg.    The young sparrow that had been left behind in the nest spread himself  out to his full size. He was now, you know, a householder; but his  grandeur did not last long: in the night red fire broke through the  windows, the flames seized on the roof, the dry thatch blazed up high,  the whole house was burnt, and the young sparrow with it; but the  young married couple escaped, fortunately, with life. When the sun  rose again, and every thing looked so refreshed and invigorated, as  after a peaceful sleep, there was nothing left of the cottage except  some charred black beams leaning against the chimney, which now was  its own master. A great deal of smoke still rose from the ground, but  without, quite uninjured, stood the rose-bush, fresh and blooming, and  mirrored every flower, every branch, in the clear water.    \"Oh! how beautifully the roses are blooming in front of the burnt-down  house!\" cried a passer-by. \"It is impossible to fancy a more lovely  picture. I must have that!\"    And the man took a little book with white leaves out of his pocket: he  was a painter, and with a pencil he drew the smoking house, the  charred beams, and the toppling chimney, which now hung over more and  more. But the large and blooming rose-tree, quite in the foreground,  afforded a magnificent sight; it was on its account alone that the  whole picture had been made.    Later in the day two of the sparrows who had been born here passed by.  \"Where is the house?\" asked they. \"Where the nest? Chirp! chirp! All  is burnt down, and our strong brother,--that is what he has got for  keeping the nest. The roses have escaped well; there they are yet  standing with their red cheeks. They, forsooth, do not mourn at the  misfortune of their neighbors. I have no wish whatever to address  them; and, besides, it is very ugly here, that's my opinion.\" And off  and away they flew.    On a beautiful, bright, sunny autumn day--one might almost have  thought it was still the middle of summer--the pigeons were strutting  about the dry and nicely-swept court-yard in front of the great  steps--black and white and party-colored--and they shone in the  sunshine. The old mamma pigeon said to the young ones: \"Form  yourselves in groups, form yourselves in groups, for that makes a much  better appearance.\"    \"What little brown creatures are those running about amongst us?\"  asked an old pigeon, whose eyes were green and yellow. \"Poor little  brownies! poor little brownies!\"    \"They are sparrows: we have always had the reputation of being kind  and gentle; we will, therefore, allow them to pick up the grain with  us. They never mix in the conversation, and they scrape a leg so  prettily.\"    \"Yes, they scratched three times with their leg, and with the left leg  too, and said also \"Chirrup!\" It is by this they recognised each  other; for they were three sparrows out of the nest of the house that  had been burnt down.    \"Very good eating here,\" said one of the sparrows. The pigeons  strutted round each other, drew themselves up, and had inwardly their  own views and opinions.    \"Do you see the cropper pigeon?\" said one of the others. \"Do you see  how she swallows the peas? She takes too many, and the very best into  the bargain!\"--\"Coo! coo!\"--\"How she puts up her top-knot, the ugly,  mischievous creature!\" \"Coo! coo! coo!\"    And every eye sparkled with malice. \"Form yourselves in groups! form  yourselves in groups! Little brown creatures! Poor little brownies!  Coo! coo!\" So it went on unceasingly, and so will they go on  chattering in a thousand years to come.    The sparrows ate right bravely. They listened attentively to what was  said, and even placed themselves in a row side by side, with the  others. It was not at all becoming to them, however. They were not  satisfied, and they therefore quitted the pigeons, and exchanged  opinions about them; nestled along under the garden palisades, and, as  they found the door of the room open that led upon the lawn, one of  them, who was filled to satiety, and was therefore over-bold, hopped  upon the threshold. \"Chirrup!\" said he, \"I dare to venture!\"    \"Chirrup!\" said another, \"I dare, too, and more besides!\" and he  hopped into the chamber. No one was present: the third saw this, and  flew still further into the room, calling out, \"Either all or nothing!  However, 'tis a curious human nest that we have here; and what have  they put up there? What is that?\"    Close in front of the sparrows bloomed the roses; they mirrored  themselves in the water, and the charred rafters leaned against the  over-hanging chimney. But what can that be? how comes this in the room  of the mansion? And all three sparrows were about to fly away over the  roses and the chimney, but they flew against a flat wall. It was all a  picture, a large, beautiful picture, which the painter had executed  after the little sketch.    \"Chirrup!\" said the sparrows, \"it is nothing! It only looks like  something. Chirrup! That is beautiful! Can you comprehend it? I  cannot!\" And away they flew, for people came into the room.    Days and months passed, the pigeons had often cooed, the sparrows had  suffered cold in winter, and in summer lived right jollily; they were  all betrothed and married, or whatever you choose to call it. They had  young ones, and each naturally considered his the handsomest and the  cleverest: one flew here, another there; and if they met they  recognised each other by the \"Chirrup?\" and by the thrice-repeated  scratching with the left leg. The eldest sparrow had remained an old  maid, who had no nest and no family; her favorite notion was to see a  large town, so away she flew to Copenhagen.    There one beheld a large house, painted with many bright colors, quite  close to the canal, in which lay many barges laden with earthen pots  and apples. The windows were broader below than above, and when the  sparrow pressed through, every room appeared like a tulip, with the  most varied colors and shades, but in the middle of the tulip white  men were standing: they were of marble, some, too, were of plaister;  but when viewed with a sparrow's eyes, they are the same. Up above on  the roof stood a metal chariot, with metal horses harnessed to it;"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31111"],[0,"Across Asia on a Bicycle (#12)"],[1,"uds, now entirely cleared away, left our view  unobstructed. We could even descry the black Kurdish tents upon the  northeast slope, and, far below, the Aras River, like a streak of silver,  threading its way into the purple distance. The atmosphere about us grew  colder, and we buttoned up our now too scanty garments. We must be nearing  the top, we thought, and yet we were not certain, for a huge, precipitous  cliff, just in front of us, cut off the view.    \"Slowly, slowly,\" feebly shouted the old gentleman, as we began the attack  on its precipitous sides, now stopping to brush away the treacherous snow,  or to cut some steps in the solid ice. We pushed and pulled one another  almost to the top, and then, with one more desperate effort, we stood upon  a vast and gradually sloping snow-bed. Down we plunged above our knees  through the yielding surface, and staggered and fell with failing  strength; then rose once more and plodded on, until at last we sank  exhausted upon the top of Ararat.    For a moment only we lay gasping for breath; then a full realization of  our situation dawned upon us, and fanned the few faint sparks of  enthusiasm that remained in our exhausted bodies. We unfurled upon an  alpenstock the small silk American flag that we had brought from home, and  for the first time the \"stars and stripes\" was given to the breeze on the  Mountain of the Ark. Four shots fired from our revolvers in commemoration  of Independence Day broke the stillness of the gorges. Far above the  clouds, which were rolling below us over three of the most absolute  monarchies in the world, was celebrated in our simple way a great event of  republicanism.    Mount Ararat, it will be observed from the accompanying sketch, has two  tops, a few hundred yards apart, sloping, on the eastern and western  extremities, into rather prominent abutments, and separated by a snow  valley, or depression, from 50 to 100 feet in depth. The eastern top, on  which we were standing, was quite extensive, and 30 to 40 feet lower than  its western neighbor. Both tops are hummocks on the huge dome of Ararat,  like the humps on the back of a camel, on neither one of which is there a  vestige of anything but snow.      [Illustration: ON THE SUMMIT OF MOUNT ARARAT--FIRING THE FOURTH OF JULY    SALUTE.]    There remained just as little trace of the crosses left by Parrot and  Chodzko, as of the ark itself. We remembered the pictures we had seen in  our nursery-books, which represented this mountain-top covered with green  grass, and Noah stepping out of the ark, in the bright, warm sunshine,  before the receding waves; and now we looked around and saw this very spot  covered with perpetual snow. Nor did we see any evidence whatever of a  former existing crater, except perhaps the snow-filled depression we have  just mentioned. There was nothing about this perpetual snow-field, and the  freezing atmosphere that was chilling us to the bone, to remind us that we  were on the top of an extinct volcano that once trembled with the  convulsions of subterranean heat.    The view from this towering height was immeasurably extensive, and almost  too grand. All detail was lost--all color, all outline; even the  surrounding mountains seemed to be but excrescent ridges of the plain.  Then, too, we could catch only occasional glimpses, as the clouds shifted  to and fro. At one time they opened up beneath us, and revealed the Aras  valley with its glittering ribbon of silver at an abysmal depth below. Now  and then we could descry the black volcanic peaks of Ali Ghez forty miles  away to the northwest, and on the southwest the low mountains that  obscured the town of Bayazid. Of the Caucasus, the mountains about Erzerum  on the west, and Lake Van on the south, and even of the Caspian Sea, all  of which are said to be in Ararat's horizon, we could see absolutely  nothing.    Had it been a clear day we could have seen not only the rival peaks of the  Caucasus, which for so many years formed the northern wall of the  civilized world, but, far to the south, we might have descried the  mountains of Quardu land, where Chaldean legend has placed the landing of  the ark. We might have gazed, in philosophic mood, over the whole of the  Aras valley, which for 3000 years or more has been the scene of so much  misery and conflict. As monuments of two extreme events in this historic  period, two spots might have attracted our attention--one right below us,  the ruins of Artaxata, which, according to tradition, was built, as the  story goes, after the plans of the roving conqueror Hannibal, and stormed  by the Roman legions, A. D. 58; and farther away to the north, the modern  fortress of Kars, which so recently reverberated with the thunders of the  Turkish war.    We were suddenly aroused by the rumbling of thunder below us. A storm was  rolling rapidly up the southeast slope of the mountain. The atmosphere  seemed to be boiling over the heated plain below. Higher and higher came  the clouds, rolling and seething among the grim crags along the chasm; and  soon we were caught in its embrace. The thermometer dropped at once below  freezing-point, and the dense mists, driven against us by the hurricane,  formed icicles on our blistered faces, and froze the ink in our  fountain-pens. Our summer clothing was wholly inadequate for such an  unexpected experience; we were chilled to the bone. To have remained where  we were would have been jeopardizing our health, if not our lives.  Although we could scarcely see far enough ahead to follow back on the  track by which we had ascended, yet we were obliged to attempt it at once,  for the storm around us was increasing every moment; we could even feel  the charges of electricity whenever we touched the iron points of our  alpenstocks.    Carefully peering through the clouds, we managed to follow the trail we  had made along the gradually sloping summit, to the head of the great  chasm, which now appeared more terrible than ever. We here saw that it  would be extremely perilous, if not actually impossible, to attempt a  descent on the rocks along its treacherous edge in such a hurricane. The  only alternative was to take the precipitous snow-covered slope. Planting  our ice-hooks deep in the snow behind us, we started. At first the strong  head wind, which on the top almost took us off our feet, somewhat checked  our downward career, but it was not long before we attained a velocity  that made our hair stand on end. It was a thrilling experience; we seemed  to be sailing through the air itself, for the clouds obscured the slope  even twenty feet below. Finally we emerged beneath them into the glare of  the afternoon sunlight; but on we dashed for 6000 feet, leaning heavily on  the trailing-stocks, which threw up an icy spray in our wake. We never  once stopped until we reached the bottom of the dome, at our last night's  camp among the rocks.    In less than an hour we had dashed down, through a distance which it had  taken us nine and a half hours to ascend. The camp was reached at 4 P. M.,  just twelve hours from the time we left it. Gathering up the remaining  baggage, we hurried away to continue the descent. We must make desperate  efforts to reach the Kurdish encampment by nightfall; for during the last  twenty-seven hours we had had nothing to drink but half a pint of tea, and  our thirst by this time became almost intolerable.    The large snow-bed down which we had been sliding now began to show signs  of treachery. The snow, at this low altitude, had melted out from below,  to supply the subterranean streams, leaving only a thin crust at the  surface. It was not long before one of our party fell into one of these  pitfalls up to his shoulders, and floundered about for some time before he  could extricate himself from his unexpected snow-bath.    Over the rocks and boulders the descent was much slower and more tedious.  For two hours we were thus busily engaged, when all at once a shout rang  out in the clear evening air. Looking up we saw, sure enough, our two  zaptiehs and muleteer on the very spot where we had left them the evening  before. Even the two donkeys were on hand to give us a welcoming bray.  They had come up from the encampment early in the morning, and had been  scanning the mountain all day long to get some clue to our whereabouts.  They reported that they had seen us at one time during the morning, and  had then lost sight of us among the clouds. This solicitude on their part  was no doubt prompted by the fact that they were to be held by the  mutessarif of Bayazid as personally responsible for our safe return, and  perhaps, too, by the hope that they might thus retrieve the good graces  they had lost the day before, and thereby increase the amount of the  forthcoming baksheesh. Nothing, now, was too heavy for the donkeys, and  even the zaptiehs themselves condescended to relieve us of our  alpenstocks.    That night we sat again around the Kurdish camp-fire, surrounded by the  same group of curious faces. It was interesting and even amusing to watch  the bewildered astonishment that overspread their countenances as we  related our experiences along the slope, and then upon the very top, of  Ak-Dagh. They listened throughout with profound attention, then looked at  one another in silence, and gravely shook their heads. They could not  believe it. It was impossible. Old Ararat stood above us grim and terrible  beneath the twinkling stars. To them it was, as it always will be, the  same mysterious, untrodden height--the palace of the jinn.                                               III                             THROUGH PERSIA TO SAMARKAND      \"It is all bosh,\" was the all but universal opinion of Bayazid in regard  to our alleged ascent of Ararat. None but the Persian consul and the  mutessarif himself deigned to profess a belief in it, and the gift of  several letters to Persian officials, and a"]]]
