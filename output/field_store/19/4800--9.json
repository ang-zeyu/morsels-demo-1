GERMAN-AMERICAN PRESS.    _Under the caption, \"He Kept His Vow,\" the evening edition of the  New-Yorker Staats-Zeitung, which for months had been referring to  Secretary Bryan as \"Secretary Bryan Stumping,\" as opposed to  \"Secretary Lansing Acting,\" said on June 9:_    As unreservedly as we believe that he [Mr. Bryan] is sacrificing high  office to a principle--something that seems to be incomprehensible not  alone to American politicians; readily as we pay him tribute that a  man in public life has again had the courage to act, despite the  machinations of editorial offices, pulpits, and the counting rooms of  money agents; clearly as we see again his latest act, the old Bryan,  who can sacrifice nothing to utilitarianism, everything to an idea, no  matter how fantastic it may be, nevertheless it must not be left  unmentioned that his exit out of the Wilson Cabinet was under all  circumstances only a question of time. Bryan may want to be a  candidate in 1916, a rival of Wilson; there may be a political motive  at the bottom of the dramatically staged resignation; the fact remains  that two hard heads, Wilson and Bryan, could not permanently agree.  One had to yield; one had to go. Just as Bismarck had to go when  Wilhelm II. felt himself safe in the saddle, so Bryan had to yield as  soon as Woodrow Wilson himself took the reins, all the reins, into his  hand.    Whether the departure of Bryan will exercise great influence on the  course of events, so far as relations with Germany are concerned, is  an open question. At all events, the peace party in Congress and in  the country as a whole has found a leader who is a fighter, who today  still has a large following in Congress and out of it. And in  Congress, through the masses, the question must finally be decided.  Meanwhile, is it to be assumed without further ado that President  Wilson himself stands diametrically opposed to the peace views of  Bryan? We do not believe that. We are even today still of the opinion  that Wilson desires war with Germany as little as does Bryan, the  friend of peace, who has just let his deeds follow his words.    _From the St. Paul Daily Volks Zeitung._    Bryan's stand for fair play forces his resignation. Bryan's  resignation at this critical moment is the greatest service the  Commoner has ever rendered his country, because it has aroused the  people to see the danger of the foreign policy now pursued by the  President.    _From the Minneapolis Freie Presse Herold._    It is evident that Mr. Bryan, believing that Wilson and Roosevelt will  be the next Presidential nominees, now sees the opportunity to secure  the German vote for himself, but Mr. Bryan's hypocrisy will fool no  one, particularly the Germans.    _From Alex E. Oberlander, Editor the Syracuse Union._    Mr. Bryan will be a greater power for peace out of the Cabinet than  in it. As a member of the Cabinet diplomacy muzzled him, but now as a  private citizen he can and will be outspoken, and his voice for peace  will carry far more weight than the manufacturers of war munitions,  Wall Street, would-be Generals, Colonels, and Captains, and the jingo  press.    _From Paul F. Mueller, Editor Abendpost of Chicago._    The people will choose Mr. Bryan's side if the President persists on a  way which may lead to war and must lead to dishonor.    _From Horace L. Brand, Publisher Illinois Staats-Zeitung._    Mr. Bryan will have the support of all sane Americans on any  reasonable proposition which will keep this country out of war. Mr.  Bryan, with all his faults, evidently has his principles.    _From the Waechter und Anzeiger of Cleveland, Ohio._    He would not be a man had he signed the death warrant for what he  regarded as the crowning deed and success of his life's work. And,  because this was asked of him, many a person will say the Scotch in  the President's veins did not deny itself in the manner which  compelled Mr. Bryan's resignation, although keeping up the appearance  that it came of Bryan's own free will because of a disagreement over  principles.    _From the Colorado Herald of Denver._    Bryan's resignation comes as the biggest surprise of the year to all  those of pro-German proclivities who were heretofore laboring under  the impression that Bryan represented the spirit in the Cabinet that  savored of anything but a square deal for Germany.    _From the Illinois Staats-Zeitung of Chicago._    Mr. William Jennings Bryan, by his resignation and by his reasons of  his resignation, caused us fear that President Wilson's second note to  Germany would be full of thunder and lightning, and would lead at best  to a severance of the diplomatic relations between the two  countries, the friendship of which grew almost to be a tradition.    Our surprise is just as great as it is pleasant. The note of the  President is in its tone sound and friendly, and excludes the  possibility of hostilities. Germany, though she had many reasons to  complain about a hostile disposition on the part of the people, the  press, and the Government of the United States, will readily admit  that our Government is in duty bound to protect American lives and  American property, even though she should have been justified in  torpedoing the Lusitania. President Wilson seems to be willing to  admit such justification and invites Germany to submit her evidence.  This means an invitation to further negotiations, to which President  Wilson was apparently opposed in his first note.    _From Charles Neumeyer, Editor the Louisville Anzeiger._    It is inexplicable why Bryan could reconcile the signing of the first  note, which was of a much more assertive tone, with his sentiments and  principles, and then refuse his assent to this one, characterized by  dignified friendliness. Mr. Bryan must either have become extremely  touchy and particular over night, or somebody must have been fooling  somebody else. At any rate, the American note is a guarantee of  continued peace as to the issues now pending.          Mr. Bryan's Defense         In a statement headed \"The Real Issue\" and addressed \"To the       American People,\" issued on June 10, 1915; in a second       statement, appealing \"To the German-Americans,\" on June 11;       in a third, issued June 12, on the \"First and Second German       Notes,\" and in a series of utterances put forth on three       successive days, beginning June 16, Mr. Bryan justified his       resignation and offered what he styled a practical working       solution of the problem of bringing peace to Europe. These       statements were preceded by a formal utterance about his       resignation, published on June 10. Their texts are presented       below.      THE REASON FOR RESIGNING.    Washington, June 9, 1915.    My reason for resigning is clearly stated in my letter of resignation,  namely, that I may employ, as a private citizen, the means which the  President does not feel at liberty to employ. I honor him for doing  what he believes to be right, and I am sure that he desires, as I do,  to find a peaceful solution of the problem which has been created by  the action of the submarines.    Two of the points on which we differ, each conscientious in his  conviction, are:    First, as to the suggestion of investigation by an international  commission, and,    Second, as to warning Americans against traveling on belligerent  vessels or with cargoes of ammunition.    I believe that this nation should frankly state to Germany that we are  willing to apply in this case the principle which we are bound by  treaty to apply to disputes between the United States and thirty  countries with which we have made treaties, providing for  investigation of all disputes of every character and nature.    These treaties, negotiated under this Administration, make war  practically impossible between this country and these thirty  Governments, representing nearly three-fourths of all the people of  the world.    Among the nations with which we have these treaties are Great Britain,  France, and Russia. No matter what disputes may arise between us and  these treaty nations, we agree that there shall be no declaration and  no commencement of hostilities until the matters in dispute have been  investigated by an international commission, and a year's time is  allowed for investigation and report. This plan was offered to all the  nations without any exceptions whatever, and Germany was one of the  nations that accepted the principle, being the twelfth, I think, to  accept.    No treaty was actually entered into with Germany, but I cannot see  that that should stand in the way when both nations indorsed the  principle. I do not know whether Germany would accept the offer, but  our country should, in my judgment, make the offer. Such an offer, if  accepted,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26378"],[0,"The Care of Books (#12)"],[1,"by the fuller information that  has come down to us respecting the library of Isidore, Bishop of Seville  600-636. The \"verses composed by himself for his own presses,\" to quote  the oldest manuscript containing them[111], have been preserved, with the  names of the writers under whose portraits they were inscribed.    There were fourteen presses, arranged as follows:      I.       Origen.    II.      Hilary.    III.     Ambrose.    IV.      Augustine.    V.       Jerome.    VI.      Chrysostom.    VII.     Cyprian.    VIII.    Prudentius.    IX.      Avitus, Juvencus, Sedulius.    X.       Eusebius, Orosius.    XI.      Gregory.    XII.     Leander.    XIII.    Theodosius, Paulus, Gaius.    XIV.     Cosmas, Damian, Hippocrates, Galen.    These writers are probably those whom Isidore specially admired, or had  some particular reason for commemorating. The first seven are obvious  types of theologians, and the presses over which they presided were  doubtless filled not merely with their own works, but with bibles,  commentaries, and works on Divinity in general. Eusebius and Orosius are  types of ecclesiastical historians; Theodosius, Paulus, and Gaius, of  jurists; Cosmas, Damian, etc. of physicians. But the Christian poets  Prudentius to Sedulius could hardly have needed two presses to contain  their works; nor Gregory the Great the whole of one. Lastly, Leander,  Isidore's elder brother, could only owe his place in the series to  fraternal affection. I conjecture that these portraits were simply  commemorative; and that the presses beneath them contained the books on  subjects not suggested by the rest of the portraits, as for example,  secular literature, in which Isidore was a proficient.    The sets of verses[112] begin with three elegiac couplets headed _Titulus  Bibliothece_, probably placed over the door of entrance.      Sunt hic plura sacra, sunt hic mundalia plura:      Ex his si qua placent carmina, tolle, lege.    Prata vides, plena spinis, et copia florum;      Si non vis spinas sumere, sume rosas.    Hic geminae radiant veneranda volumina legis;      Condita sunt pariter hic nova cum veteri.      Here sacred books with worldly books combine;    If poets please you, read them; they are thine.    My meads are full of thorns, but flowers are there;    If thorns displease, let roses be your share.    Here both the Laws in tomes revered behold;    Here what is new is stored, and what is old.    The authors selected are disposed of either in a single couplet, or in  several couplets, according to the writer's taste. I will quote the lines  on S. Augustine:      Mentitur qui [te] totum legisse fatetur:      An quis cuneta tua lector habere potest?    Namque voluminibus mille, Augustine, refulges,      Testantur libri, quod loquor ipse, tui.    Quamvis multorum placeat prudentia libris,      Si Augustinus adest, sufficit ipse tibi.      They lie who to have read thee through profess;    Could any reader all thy works possess?    A thousand scrolls thy ample gifts display;    Thy own books prove, Augustine, what I say.    Though other writers charm with varied lore,    Who hath Augustine need have nothing more.    The series concludes with some lines \"To an Intruder (_ad  Interventorem_),\" the last couplet of which is too good to be omitted:      Non patitur quenquam coram se scriba loquentem;      Non est hic quod agas, garrule, perge foras.      A writer and a talker can't agree:    Hence, idle chatterer; 'tis no place for thee.    [Illustration: Fig. 16. Great Hall of the Vatican Library, looking west.]    With these three examples I conclude the section of my work which deals  with what may be called the pagan conception of a library in the fulness  of its later development. Unfortunately, no enthusiast of those distant  times has handed down to us a complete description of his library, and we  are obliged to take a detail from one account, and a detail from another,  and so piece the picture together for ourselves. What I may call \"the  pigeon-hole system,\" suitable for rolls only, was replaced by presses  which could contain rolls if required, and certainly did (as shewn (fig.  13) on the sarcophagus of the Villa Balestra), but which were specially  designed for _codices_. These presses were sometimes plain, sometimes  richly ornamented, according to the taste or the means of the owner. With  the same limitations the floor, the walls, and possibly the roof also were  decorated. Further, it was evidently intended that the room selected for  books should be used for no other purpose; and, as the books were hidden  from view in their presses, the library-note, if I may be allowed the  expression, was struck by numerous inscriptions, and by portraits in  various materials, representing either authors whose works were on the  shelves, or men distinguished in other ways, or friends and relations of  the owner of the house.    The Roman conception of a library was realised by Pope Sixtus V., in  1587[113], when the present Vatican Library was commenced from the design  of the architect Fontana. I am not aware that there is any contemporary  record to prove that either the Pope or his advisers contemplated this  direct imitation; but it is evident, from the most cursory inspection of  the large room (fig. 16), that the main features of a Roman library are  before us[114]; and perhaps, having regard to the tendency of the  Renaissance, especially in Italy, it would be unreasonable to expect a  different design in such a place, and at such a period.    This noble hall--probably the most splendid apartment ever assigned to  library-purposes--spans the Cortile del Belvedere from east to west, and  is entered at each end from the galleries connecting the Belvedere with  the Vatican palace. It is 184 feet long, and 57 feet wide, divided into  two by six piers, on which rest simple quadripartite vaults. The north and  south walls are each pierced with seven large windows. No books are  visible. They are contained in plain wooden presses 7 feet high and 2 feet  deep, set round the piers, and against the walls between the windows. The  arrangement of these presses will be understood from the general view  (fig. 16), and from the view of a single press open (fig. 17).    In the decoration, with which every portion of the walls and vaults is  covered, Roman methods are reproduced, but with a difference. The great  writers of antiquity are conspicuous by their absence; but the  development of the human race is commemorated by the presence of those  to whom the invention of letters is traditionally ascribed; the walls  are covered with frescoes representing the foundation of the great  libraries which instructed the world, and the assemblies of the Councils  which established the Church; the vaults record the benefits conferred  on Rome by Sixtus V., in a series of historical views, one above each  window; and over these again are stately figures, each embodying some  sacred abstraction--\"Thrones, dominations, princedoms, virtues,  powers\"--with angels swinging censers, and graceful nymphs, and laughing  satyrs--a strange combination of paganism and Christianity--amid wreaths  of flowers, and arabesques twining round the groups and over every  vacant space, partly framing, partly hiding, the heraldic devices which  commemorate Sixtus and his family:--a web of lovely forms and brilliant  colours, combined in an intricate and yet orderly confusion.    It may be questioned whether such a room as this was ever intended for  study. The marble floor, the gorgeous decoration, the absence of all  appliances for work in the shape of desks, tables, chairs, suggest a place  for show rather than for use. The great libraries of the Augustan age, on  the other hand, seem, so far as we can judge, to have been used as  meeting-places and reading-rooms for learned and unlearned alike. In  general arrangement and appearance, however, the Vatican Library must  closely resemble its imperial predecessors.    [Illustration: Fig. 17. A single press in the Vatican Library, open.
