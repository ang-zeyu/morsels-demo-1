They  were therefore taken up over a mountain-country, crossing Mount Ingwe,  to the Zlobani Mountain, a stronghold ten miles south of Umbelleni's  chief kraal, and where at present he was residing.  After three days'  journey the lads, exhausted and footsore, ascended to the plateau of the  Zlobani Mountains.    Upon their way they passed through many villages, and at each place it  needed the efforts of their guards to prevent their being seriously  maltreated, if not killed.  The Zulus, although victorious at Isandula,  had suffered terribly, it being estimated that nearly 3000 had fallen in  the attack.    Thus there was not a village but had lost some of its members, for,  although the Zulu regiments have local denominations and regular  military kraals, each regiment consists of men drawn from the population  at large.    Every four or five years all the lads who have passed the age of  eighteen since the formation of the last corps, are called out and  formed into a regiment, or are embodied with some regiment whose numbers  have fallen in strength.  Thus a regiment may consist of men differing  considerably from each other in point of age, the great distinction  being that some corps consist entirely of married men, while others are  all unmarried.  A regiment remains unmarried until the king formally  gives the permission to take wives, and the corps to whom the boon has  been granted are distinguished from the others by their hair being  arranged in a thick ring round the head.  So great is the enmity between  these married regiments and their less fortunate comrades that they are  never encamped in each other's view, as fighting in that case would  inevitably take place.  Thus it happened that, although some of the  corps had suffered far more than others, the loss was spread over the  whole of Zululand.    CHAPTER SIX.    ZLOBANI.    While disaster had fallen upon the centre column, the division under  Colonel Evelyn Wood had been showing what could be done when care and  prudence took the place of a happy-go-lucky recklessness.  It had  advanced from Utrecht on the 7th of January, and had moved up to the  frontier at Sandspruit.  At two in the afternoon of the 10th it moved  forward, halted at six, and again advanced by the light of the moon at  half-past one in the morning; a mounted advance-guard was thrown out,  flanking patrols were organised, and the troops moved in the greatest  silence.    The next day Colonel Buller, with his irregular horse, went out, and  after a skirmish with the Zulus brought in a thousand cattle, and  Captain Barton, with a party scouting in another direction, captured  550.    On the following morning a reconnaissance in force was made, and a good  deal of skirmishing took place; but, as Colonel Wood never allowed his  men to follow the Zulus into rough ground, the latter were unable to  effect anything against the column.  This division advanced forward but  slowly, as it was intended that they should keep within reach of the  leisurely-moving central column.    After several slight skirmishes the news reached them on the 24th of the  disaster of Isandula, and with it Colonel Wood received orders to fall  back; and on the 26th he encamped at Kambula.  Raids were made in all  directions with great success; the great military kraal of Manyamyoba  was captured and destroyed by Colonel Buller and his cavalry.  As  Colonel Wood's was now the most advanced column, Colonel Rowlands, with  a wing of the 80th and a couple of guns and 200 Swazis, together with  Raaff's Horse and Wetherby's Borderers, were sent as a reinforcement to  him.    The Zulus were not idle, and Umbelleni and Manyamyoba made several  successful raids across the border and destroyed the kraals of natives  friendly to the English.  These two chiefs were not regular Zulu  chieftains; both were adventurers who had gathered under them numbers of  broken men, and had for years carried on raids on their own account from  their mountain-stronghold, in much the same way that the Scotch  borderers of olden times harassed the country on the English side of the  frontier.    Oham, the king's brother, with his own following, came into Colonel  Wood's camp, and gave himself up, saying that he was altogether opposed  to the war.    The boys on their arrival at Zlobani were brought before Umbelleni.  That chief briefly gave orders that they should be killed; but two or  three of his headmen represented to him that they might be of use; they  would be able to carry a message to the British camp, should he desire  at any time to send one; by their appearance and dress, they could tell  him the nature of any troops they might intend to attack, and could read  and explain any letters which might be captured on messengers; finally,  they might be an acceptable present to send to Cetewayo, who might not  be pleased if he heard that prisoners had been killed in cold blood.    Umbelleni assented to the reasoning, and ordered the boys to be taken to  a hut.  The Zulu dwellings resemble in form great bee-hives.  They are  circular and dome-roofed; the entrance is but three feet high, and  people can only enter by crawling.  A woman was ordered to cook for  them.  No guard was placed over them, and they were permitted to wander  about freely, as escape from such a position was considered impossible.    Six weeks passed slowly, and on the 11th of March a messenger arrived,  and there was a sudden stir in the camp.  In a few minutes the  fighting-men assembled.  The boys were ordered to take their place in  the column, and at a swift march, with which they had the greatest  difficulty in keeping up, the column moved away.    \"Where are they taking us now, I wonder?\"  Tom said.    \"I suppose they are going to attack some English party on the march; our  men are hardly likely, I should think, again to be caught napping, as  they were at Isandula.\"    Crossing two rivers, the Bevana and Pongola, they at night halted in  another mountain-kraal of Umbelleni, about three miles from the Intombe  River.  On the bank of the river could be seen twenty waggons.  These  waggons had come down from Derby, on their way to Luneberg, a town  situated four miles from the Intombe.  Major Tucker, who commanded  there, sent Captain Moriarty with a company of the 80th, seventy strong,  down to the river to protect the waggons whilst crossing, and that  officer had orders to neglect no precaution, and above all to keep an  incessant and vigilant look-out.    The river was in flood, and no crossing could be effected, and for four  days the waggons remained on the northern bank.  Captain Moriarty placed  the waggons in laager on the bank, and took post there with forty of his  men, leaving Lieutenant Harwood with thirty-four on the south bank with  directions to cover the sides of the laager with a flanking fire, should  it be attacked.  The position of the waggons was a dangerous one, as the  ground rose immediately behind them, and was covered with bush.    In the middle of the night of the 11th Umbelleni's men arose, and,  accompanied by the boys, started from the kraal, and Dick and Tom were  filled with forebodings of what was about to happen.  Dick had already  gathered from the natives that the guard of the waggons was an extremely  small one, and, as the body moving to attack them were between 4000 and  5000 strong, the chance of a successful resistance appeared small.    When within a short distance of the waggons two of the Zulus motioned to  the boys to stop.  In ten minutes they heard a sentry challenge; his  shout was answered by a loud yell, and the Zulus poured down to the  attack.  Unfortunately Captain Moriarty had not taken sufficient  precaution against surprise, and before the men were fairly under arms  the Zulus were upon them.    The force on the other side of the river were now on the alert, and  their rifle-fire opened before that of the defenders of the waggons.  For a moment or two there was a sharp rattling fire from the waggons;  then there were shouts and screams, the firing ceased, and the boys knew  that the laager had been captured.  Many of the soldiers indeed were  assegaied before they could leave their tents, most were slaughtered at  once, but a few managed to swim across the river.  The Zulus swarmed  after them.  Lieutenant Harwood jumped upon his horse and rode off to  Luneberg to fetch assistance.  The little detachment was broken by the  rush of the Zulus, but a serjeant and eight men fell back into a  deserted kraal, and succeeded in repelling the attacks of the enemy.    Lieutenant Harwood was afterwards tried by court-martial for his  conduct; he was acquitted, but the general in command refused to confirm  the verdict, and the commander-in-chief at home approved of the view he  took of the matter, and issued a general order to the effect that \"An  officer, being the only one present with a party of soldiers actually  engaged with the enemy, is not under any pretext whatever justified in  deserting them, and thus by so doing abandoning them to their fate.\"    Apprehensive of the arrival of reinforcements from Luneberg, Umbelleni  did not continue his attack upon the little party in the kraal, but,  after hastily plundering the waggons, retreated with his force, and the  next day returned to Zlobani.    A few days passed and the boys learnt that two regiments from Ulundi  were expected shortly to reinforce Umbelleni's men.  The chief himself,  with the majority of his followers, was now at his kraal, four miles  distant, but the boys remained in the village on the Zlobani plateau.  Several times they saw parties of British horse riding over the plains  and from a distance reconnoitring the position, and they wondered  whether there could be any intention on the part of Colonel Wood to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32947"],[0,"On Snake-Poison: Its Action and Its Antidote (#12)"],[1,"    Dr. Hannah, of Southport. Particulars not given.        CASE 35.--Mrs. Rogers, of Bulu Bulu, Gippsland, bitten on finger      by tiger snake, and treated by Dr. Trampy, first with intravenous      injections of ammonia, which had no effect, and when sinking with      strychnine injections, which had almost immediate effect, and in a      few hours placed her out of danger.        CASE 36.--Son of Mr. J. Beveridge, squatter, of Glengower, treated      successfully by Dr. Andrew, of Clunes, with strychnine injections.        CASE 37.--Theresa Byrne, aged 14 years, bitten whilst bathing,      snake not seen. Treated by Dr. Cuppaidge, of Normanby, Queensland.      Only 18 minims of L. S. required.        CASE 38.--Mr. Bullock, of Tenterfield, N.S.W., bitten by black      snake and treated by Dr. Morice.        CASE 39.--A boy, J. Taylor, bitten at Mount Keat, agricultural      settlement, Queensland, by a black snake, and treated successfully      by a layman, Mr. James Daniels.        CASE 40.--George Neilson, a Danish miner, bitten by a tiger snake      whilst bathing. Case reported by Dr. Gamble, of Walhalla. Forty      minims of liq. strych. required; recovery complete next morning.        CASES 41 AND 42, reported by Dr. Helsham, of Richmond, N.S.W. In      one of these where, judging from the symptoms, a large dose of      snake-poison had been absorbed, but very small doses of strychnine      were injected, convulsions set in, _whilst coma was still      present_, and lasted for two hours. Though semi-tetanic in      appearance they were erroneously ascribed to m. xxvi. of liq.      strychniae, which at the time of their appearance had not removed      the symptoms of snake-poison. They were evidently produced by the      latter and quite on a par with those occasionally occurring in man      before the strychnine is administered, and almost invariably in      dogs. As long as coma is present with other symptoms denoting the      snake-poison to be in active operation, such convulsions rather      call for the antidote, than contra indicate its use, for the      strychnine never produces them until it has completely conquered      the snake-poison, and even then they are always preceded by local      spasms and never set in suddenly. Timid medical men, when      administering the antidote and anxiously watching for the dreaded      strychnine effects, are too apt to see them in the slightest      irregular muscular action.        CASE 43, reported by Dr. Johnson, of Avoca, patient bitten by a      tiger snake, was comatose, pulseless, with very shallow      respiration, &c., and restored by three injections of m. xvi., xv.      and x. within less than three hours.        CASE 44.--Reported in _Australian Journal of Pharmacy_, from      Tasmania, treated by Dr. Tofft, of Campbell Town. The report      concludes: We have had some fatal cases of snakebite already this      season, and the successful treatment in the above case has created      a strong feeling in favour of strychnine in such emergencies.        CASES 45 TO 49.--Reported by Dr. Alex. Barber to _A.M. Gazette_.      He writes: \"During the last year I treated four cases of snakebite      successfully with strychnine. In one of these, a bite of a brown      snake, I injected three doses of m. xx. each of liq. strych. P.B.,      in all over half a grain, in one hour.\"        CASE 50.--Reported by Dr. Barrington, of Benalla (Vic.), bite of      tiger snake, symptoms moderate. Completely removed in three hours      by 57 minims of liq. strych. P.B.        _Notes of eight cases as reported to the \"Australasian Medical         Gazette\" for July and November, 1892, by R. P. Banerjee,         B.A., G.B.M.S.L., Medical Officer, Salt Mines, Pachhadra,         Rajputana,  India_:--        CASE 1.--Bhagwan Singh, aged 30, Hindu male, Sepoy, E. T. Force,      was bitten by a viperine snake (_echis carinata_) at 4 p.m. 10th      June, 1892, in the dorsum of left foot. He was removed to the      hospital, tight ligature applied, and with the following      symptoms:--Heaviness of both legs, staggered if allowed to walk,      giddiness, sense of sinking at the pit of the stomach, bleeding      from mucous surfaces and old scars; soon fell swooning.        Treatment.--The punctures incised, and blood let out, one-twelfth      of a grain of strychniae; acetas hypodermically injected. Again,      the insensibility not gone after 30 minutes, another dose given,      and so repeated the third time. The _bleeding stopped_ and the man      recovered his senses, but could not raise himself to talk. Many      more doses were given under the skin, with hour intervals, and the      man recovered the next day; but he was much exhausted and treated      for weakness three days, and discharged to duty on the 14th.      Punctures were distinct, symptoms well developed. Took _one and a      half grains_ of strychnine to effect cure, leaving no after      effects of the drug or poison.        CASE 2.--Sadig Husain, a Mussulman boy, aged 12 years, bitten on      the right ankle, just below the inner malleolus, by _echis      carinata_ (Khapar) on the 5th August, 1891, brought in with usual      symptoms, as before.        Treatment as before. This case took only one-fourth grain of      strych. acet. The boy was weak and sickly. He was discharged cured      on the third day, _i.e._, 17th August, 1891.        CASE 3.--Nathey Khan, Mussulman, customs peon, aged 35 years,      robust and strong, bitten by _echis carinata_ (yellow variety).      Punctures were on the left ankle, over the outer malleolus.      Symptoms as before given.        Treatment as before stated. This case took as much as one and      three quarter grains of strych. acet. Was admitted on the 9th      August, 1891, and discharged on the 12th August, 1891, cured and      fit for duty.        CASE 4.--Musamat Jewai, Hindu female, a labourer, age 40, strong      built. Bitten by kerait (_Bungarus coeruleus_), about 2-1/2 feet      long, above the left knee joint; ligature below the hip was used,      but all the symptoms were present and the patient was insensible.      Cyanotic marks were seen on the arms, abdomen, back and neck. At      first all hopes of recovery were given up, but attempts were made      to see if anything could do good.        Treatment.--Punctures scarified and cupping applied. Repeated      doses of strychnine acetas hypodermically given, but in _quarter      grain_ doses. It seemed marvellous. The cyanotic patches in the      skin gradually faded away and the body became warmer. It was      wondered if the person had expired, but suddenly the woman called      for a drink of cold water to bathe her dry and parching mouth.      This was done and she recovered sense. She was admitted on the 3rd      September, 1891, and discharged on the 10th. Took _three grains_      of acetate of strychnine to effect a cure.        CASE 5.--Paroati Devi, Hindu female, aged 67 years, healthy      constitution. Bitten on big toe of left foot on 10th September,      1891, symptoms were as preceding. The wound was cauterised.        Treatment.--Strychnia was given very cautiously, as the patient      was over-aged, the degeneration of the heart kept in view--1/10      grain eventually showed the peculiar strychnine symptoms. The      patient was cured in two days and discharged cured on the third      day, 14th September, 1891. This patient took in all _one and a      half grains_ of acetate of strychnia.        CASE 6.--Maya Swuper, aged 38 years, bitten by echis carinata      (without dots) on the lower third of the left leg, on the outside      of it. Mucous membrane of the mouth, eyes, nostrils, ears, and      urinary passages all bled profusely. Urine had clots in it and      symptoms resembled those in the first case.        Treated with strychnine and recovered in four days. Was admitted      on the 14th September, 1891, and discharged to duty on the 18th      September, 1891. Took in all _three grains_ to effect cure.        CASE 7.--Avghunandan, customs semadar, aged 55 years, Hindu male.      Bitten at 8 a.m. on the 29th March, 1892, by echis carinata (brown      variety) on the right foot near the cuboid bone. The punctures      were distinct and the symptoms like those of case 1. Bleeding was      profuse in this case.        Treatment.--Strychnine acetas injected _in quarter grain_ doses      under the skin and repeated as often as desirable. Patient      recovered after the sixth day and took in _all four grains of      strych. acet._ in six days. Only the bitten leg had erysipelatous      inflammation, which had to be treated afterwards, but the man was      quite safe.        Remarks.--In connection with echis bites one peculiar symptom was      always noticed, namely, the free oozing of blood from mucous      surfaces and old scars of wounds. The power of co-ordination was      very much affected from the first setting in of other symptoms.      Usually after 24 hours symptoms showed a relapse. In the treatment      with strychnia neither the symptoms of the drug nor of the      snake-poison ever showed themselves afterwards. Both seemed to      neutralise each other. Bungarus coeruleus, or kerait-bite, had its      own peculiar symptoms of cyanotic patches and insensibility,      swooning and stertorous breathing. The true comatose state was not      present in any, but only a slight one noticed in cases 4 and 5.      The other cases were generally delirious in the beginning.        CASE 8.--Dr. Banerjee communicated this case to the _Australasian      Medical Gazette_ separately and quite recently, November, 1892. It      is, of all his cases, the most important one. He writes:--\"The      following case increases my number to eight, and should clear away      prejudice and prepossessed ideas, as strychnine saved this case, a      bite of _Duboia Russellii_. This snake is admitted by all"]]]
