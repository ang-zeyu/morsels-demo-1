I never had      much hand in timber-cartin' myself; but this man.... 'Twas over      there on the Hog's Back, not far from Tongham Station. We all went      out for to see 'n do it--'cause 'twas in the dinner-time he come,      and we never believed he'd do it single-handed. The farmer says to      'n, 'You'll never get they up by yourself.' 'I dessay I shall,' he      says; and so he did, too. Three great elm-trees upon that one      carriage.... Well, he had a four-hoss team, so that'll tell ye what      'twas. They _was_ some hosses, too. Ordinary farm hosses wouldn't      ha' done it. But he only jest had to speak, and you'd see they      watchin' him.... When he went forward, after he'd got the trees up,      to see what sort of a road he'd got for gettin' out, they stood      there with their heads stretched out and their ears for'ard. 'Come      on,' he says, and _away_ they went, _tearin'_ away. Left great ruts      in the road where the wheels sent in--that'll show ye they got      something to pull.\"        We got one shrub a little further, Bettesworth grunting to a heavy      lift; then, in answer to a question:        \"No, none o' we helped 'n. We was only gone out to see 'n do it. He      never wanted no help. He didn't say much; only 'Git back,' or 'Git      up,' to the hosses. When it come to gettin' the last tree up, on top      o' t'other two, I never thought he could ha' done it. But he got 'n      up. And he was a oldish man, too: sixty, I dessay he was. But he      jest spoke to the hosses. Never used no whip 'xcept jest to guide      'em. Didn't the old farmer go on at his own men, too! 'You dam      fellers, call yerselves carters,' he says; 'a man like that's worth      a dozen o' you.' Well, they couldn' ha' done it. A dozen of 'em 'd      ha' scrambled about, an' _then_ not done it! Besides, their _hosses_      wouldn't. But this feller the old farmer says to 'n, 'I never      believed you'd ha' done it.' 'I thought mos likely I should,' he      says. But he never had much to say.\"    A few hundred yards further along the Hog's Back the road drops down  south-east to Seale, the first of the three ancient and interesting  villages which lie under the ridge between Farnham and Guildford. Seale  is a fascinating little place. It consists only of a few cottages, shy  and red-roofed, deep among high hedges, bushy dells and reedy meadows,  with wheatfields and barleyfields clothing the chalky slopes above. The  church has been rebuilt, but has some inscriptions worth looking at. One  is an epitaph on a young officer, Edward Noel Long, who was drowned at  sea. According to the inscription:--        \"On his way to join the British forces in Spain, he, with others of      his regiment, perished in the sea near Cape St. Vincent, during the      confusion of a fatal accident occasioned by the _Isis_ man-of-war      falling on board the transport on which he was embarked on the night      of the 6th March, 1809.\"    That was just after Corunna. A carved bas-relief represents the _Isis_  under full sail \"falling on board\" the transport.    [Illustration: _Seale._]    Here, under the Hog's Back north and south, nearly all the cottages are  old and nearly all have gardens. One perfect little building stands not  far from Seale on the road to Puttenham, bowered in vines and quaintly  chimneyed, with white-curtained windows opening on a low wall and  stone-crop and high box borders, and, when I saw it in July, bunches of  pink and white mallows glowing under an old oak door. No cottages count  sunnier hours than these that stand about the long strip of green  country under the chalk downs. This part of Surrey, perhaps, has changed  as little as any part during the last twenty or thirty years, which have  added so many miles of brick and slate to Surrey villages and towns;  probably the greatest change has been in the roads. Mrs. Henry Ady, for  instance, writing of the Pilgrims' Way just fifteen years ago, speaks of  the road that runs through Seale, Puttenham, and Compton as being \"a  grassy lane, not always easy to follow, and little used in places.\" The  road as it runs here may not take the exact line of the Pilgrims' Way,  but no one could call it difficult to follow. Here and there it passes  through cornfields, and it is by leaving the road to take a footpath  through a cornfield that the best view is to be had of Puttenham, whose  red roofs and grey church tower are set delightfully among rich elms,  with a splash of ploughed chalk blazing white through the trees beyond.  Puttenham has added only a few new cottages to its outskirts; under the  church it is still red and mossy and lichened. The cottages are oddly  built to suit the sloping ground, for the road to the church rises on a  hill, and necessitates different levels for foundations and stone  pathways. One of the cottages has an outside staircase to its front  door, for what reason there is no guessing.    The next village under the Hog's Back on the way to Guildford is  Compton, perhaps the third stage of thirsty pilgrims journeying from  Whitewaysend. The main road enters Compton from the north, but the  prettiest way to find the village is to drop down on it by a woodland  footpath from the west. Icehouse Wood is the name of the few acres of  trees through which the path runs; an old brick-lined pocket in the side  of the hill suggests the name, but there are remains of another brick  building higher up the slope which look nothing like an icehouse. Was  the name ever Oasthouse wood, perhaps, and did they grow hops here as at  Farnham? If any pilgrims left the beaten track from Puttenham which runs  north of Compton they may have come to the church and the inn by this  footpath. It is centuries old; it is lined, before it enters the wood,  by ordered holly which may once have marked a road, and as it drops down  the hill it cuts as deep into the sand as the old trackways north of  Anstiebury Camp or west of Albury. Great beeches coil their roots about  its edge--younger than the road if ever oasthouses stood by it.    Compton looks like a village presided over by a single mind. The  cottages which add themselves to whatever is old in neighbouring  buildings are designed to fit with a scheme; the cottage gardens are  challenges of roses and phloxes, which shall be brightest. The black  beams and jutting stories of an ancient timbered house stand above the  road, an example and a guardian; the whole aspect of the village is of  the quietest country. When I was walking through Compton I was told of a  village festival which had been held in the spring, in which children  from Bermondsey--Bermondsey once a Thames-side village itself--dressed  in the old dresses and danced the old dances. They had a Queen of the  May and they twined a maypole with ribands; and as I went out of Compton  there were the Compton village children, six or seven of them, dancing  over the dances the Bermondsey children had shown them, in the same  field where the festival was held. The first of May would come round  again; they would choose their own Queen and twine their own maypole.    Compton church is one of the most interesting in the country. It must be  forgiven a hideous organ, whose blue and red pipes block the western  arch of the nave; the sanctuary is the beauty of the church. It is the  only two-storied sanctuary in England, and the origin of two-storied  sanctuaries is unknown. Mr. Lewis Andre, writing in the _Surrey  Archaeological Collections_, is inclined to think that the dedication of  the upper sanctuary may have been to St. Michael; there are several  altars dedicated to St. Michael in the galleries of continental  churches. Another feature of the church is the wooden Norman screen  which fences off the upper sanctuary; it is the oldest known in England,  and dates back to 1180, according to the archaeologists. Some Jacobean  screen work in the pulpit and the altar rails is an interesting  contrast.    Half a mile north of Compton are a chapel and a cemetery, the joint gift  of the late George Frederick Watts and Mrs. Watts; the chapel, designed  by Mrs. Watts, strikes a dominant note of terracotta and red brick.  There are strengths and splendours which belong to the building and its  frescoes, but to me, at all events, it seems to lack the peace and  mystery of quieter, duller chapels. A noble memorial of a master mind is  the picture gallery in the grounds of the terracotta designing school  founded by the late painter's wife. The gallery contains many of his  finest pictures, and in particular the last of all which he  painted--_Destiny_, a tremendous figure with a shadowed face; masses of  filmy light are about it, and power moves in the arm that holds the  book; there is a secret hidden which the grey face knows. The gallery is  lighted as no London gallery is; the ceiling and walls are washed with  old gold, which takes all the hardness from the spaces of sunshine  playing through the roof. Mrs. Watts, I believe, added this charm to the  gallery. Others besides critics owe her gratitude. Outside the gallery  stand rows of pottery, the work of her pupils. Urns, vases, basins,  cups, pedestals, fountains await translation to flower gardens. The  birds of many Surrey lawns owe a debt to Compton for wide splash-baths  of water to bathe in and drink at in the heats of summer.    Compton can be seen either from Guildford or from Godalming, and the  traveller has the choice at Puttenham either of rejoining the Hog's Back  immediately above the village, and so dropping down into Wanborough on  the other side, or going on to Compton and perhaps climbing up again to  the road on the ridge afterwards. Wanborough, a fascinating little  hamlet, is worth the extra climbs up the hill. It is little more, in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2808"],[0,"Treatises on Friendship and Old Age (#12)"],[1," our ancestors  would never have called their supreme council a Senate. At Sparta,  indeed, those who hold the highest magistracies are in accordance with  the fact actually called \"elders.\" But if you will take the trouble  to read or listen to foreign history, you will find that the mightiest  States have been brought into peril by young men, have been supported  and restored by old. The question occurs in the poet Naevius's _Sport_:         Pray, who are those who brought your State       With such despatch to meet its fate?    There is a long answer, but this is the chief point:         A crop of brand-new orators we grew,       And foolish, paltry lads who thought they knew.    For of course rashness is the note of youth, prudence of old age.    7. But, it is said, memory dwindles. No doubt, unless you keep it in  practice, or if you happen to be somewhat dull by nature. Themistocles  had the names of all his fellow-citizens by heart. Do you imagine that  in his old age he used to address Aristides as Lysimachus? For my part,  I know not only the present generation, but their fathers also, and  their grandfathers. Nor have I any fear of losing my memory by reading  tombstones, according to the vulgar superstition. On the contrary, by  reading them I renew my memory of those who are dead and gone. Nor, in  point of fact, have I ever heard of any old man forgetting where he had  hidden his money. They remember everything that interests them: when to  answer to their bail, business appointments, who owes them money, and  to whom they owe it. What about lawyers, pontiffs, augurs, philosophers,  when old? What a multitude of things they remember! Old men retain their  intellects well enough, if only they keep their minds active and fully  employed. Nor is that the case only with men of high position and  great office: it applies equally to private life and peaceful pursuits.  Sophocles composed tragedies to extreme old age; and being believed to  neglect the care of his property owing to his devotion to his art, his  sons brought him into court to get a judicial decision depriving him of  the management of his property on the ground of weak intellect--just as  in our law it is customary to deprive a paterfamilias of the management  of his property if he is squandering it. There--upon the old poet is  said to have read to the judges the play he had on hand and had just  composed--the _Oedipus Coloneus_--and to have asked them whether they  thought that the work of a man of weak intellect. After the reading he  was acquitted by the jury. Did old age then compel this man to become  silent in his particular art, or Homer, Hesiod, Simonides, or Isocrates  and Gorgias whom I mentioned before, or the founders of schools of  philosophy, Pythagoras, Democritus, Plato, Xenocrates, or later Zeno and  Cleanthus, or Diogenes the Stoic, whom you too saw at Rome? Is it not  rather the case with all these that the active pursuit of study only  ended with life?    But, to pass over these sublime studies, I can name some rustic Romans  from the Sabine district, neighbours and friends of my own,  without whose presence farm work of importance is scarcely ever  performed--whether sowing, or harvesting or storing crops. And yet in  other things this is less surprising; for no one is so old as to think  that he may not live a year. But they bestow their labour on what they  know does not affect them in any case:         He plants his trees to serve a race to come,    as our poet Statius says in his Comrades. Nor indeed would a farmer,  however old, hesitate to answer any one who asked him for whom he was  planting: \"For the immortal gods, whose will it was that I should not  merely receive these things from my ancestors, but should also hand them  on to the next generation.\"    8. That remark about the old man is better than the following:         If age brought nothing worse than this,       It were enough to mar our bliss,       That he who bides for many years       Sees much to shun and much for tears.    Yes, and perhaps much that gives him pleasure too. Besides, as to  subjects for tears, he often comes upon them in youth as well.    A still more questionable sentiment in the same Caecilius is:         No greater misery can of age be told       Than this: be sure, the young dislike the old.    Delight in them is nearer the mark than dislike. For just as old men, if  they are wise, take pleasure in the society of young men of good parts,  and as old age is rendered less dreary for those who are courted and  liked by the youth, so also do young men find pleasure in the maxims of  the old, by which they are drawn to the pursuit of excellence. Nor do  I perceive that you find my society less pleasant than I do yours. But  this is enough to show you how, so far from being listless and sluggish,  old age is even a busy time, always doing and attempting something, of  course of the same nature as each man's taste had been in the previous  part of his life. Nay, do not some even add to their stock of learning?  We see Solon, for instance, boasting in his poems that he grows old  \"daily learning something new.\" Or again in my own case, it was only  when an old man that I became acquainted with Greek literature, which in  fact I absorbed with such avidity--in my yearning to quench, as it were,  a long-continued thirst--that I became acquainted with the very facts  which you see me now using as precedents. When I heard what Socrates had  done about the lyre I should have liked for my part to have done that  too, for the ancients used to learn the lyre but, at any rate, I worked  hard at literature.    9. Nor, again, do I now MISS THE BODILY STRENGTH OF A YOUNG MAN (for  that was the second point as to the disadvantages of old age) any more  than as a young man I missed the strength of a bull or an elephant. You  should use what you have, and whatever you may chance to be doing, do  it with all your might. What could be weaker than Milo of Croton's  exclamation? When in his old age he was watching some athletes  practising in the course, he is said to have looked at his arms and to  have exclaimed with tears in his eyes: \"Ah well! these are now as good  as dead.\" Not a bit more so than yourself, you trifler! For at no time  were you made famous by your real self, but by chest and biceps. Sext.  Aelius never gave vent to such a remark, nor, many years before him,  Titus Coruncanius, nor, more recently, P. Crassus--all of them learned  juris-consults in active practice, whose knowledge of their profession  was maintained to their last breath. I am afraid an orator does lose  vigour by old age, for his art is not a matter of the intellect alone,  but of lungs and bodily strength. Though as a rule that musical ring  in the voice even gains in brilliance in a certain way as one grows  old--certainly I have not yet lost it, and you see my years. Yet  after all the style of speech suitable to an old man is the quiet and  unemotional, and it often happens that the chastened and calm delivery  of an old man eloquent secures a hearing. If you cannot attain to that  yourself, you might still instruct a Scipio and a Laelius. For what is  more charming than old age surrounded by the enthusiasm of youth? Shall  we not allow old age even the strength to teach the young, to train  and equip them for all the duties of life? And what can be a nobler  employment? For my part, I used to think Publius and Gnaeus Scipio and  your two grandfathers, L. Aemilius and P. Africanus, fortunate men when  I saw them with a company of young nobles about them. Nor should we  think any teachers of the fine arts otherwise than happy, however much  their bodily forces may have decayed and failed. And yet that same  failure of the bodily forces is more often brought about by the vices of  youth than of old age; for a dissolute and intemperate youth hands down  the body to old age in a worn-out state. Xenophon's Cyrus, for instance,  in his discourse delivered on his death-bed and at a very advanced age,  says that he never perceived his old age to have become weaker than his  youth had been. I remember as a boy Lucius Metellus, who having been  created Pontifex Maximus four years after his second consulship, held  that office twenty-two years, enjoying such excellent strength of body  in the very last hours of his life as not to miss his youth. I need not  speak of myself; though that indeed is an old man's way and is generally  allowed to my time of life. Don't you see in Homer how frequently Nestor  talks of his own good qualities? For he was living through a third  generation; nor had he any reason to fear that upon saying what was true  about himself he should appear either over vain or talkative. For, as  Homer says, \"from his lips flowed discourse sweeter than honey,\" for  which sweet breath he wanted no bodily strength. And yet, after all, the  famous leader of the Greeks nowhere wishes to have ten men like Ajax,  but like Nestor: if he could get them, he feels no doubt of Troy shortly  falling.    10. But to return to my own case: I am in my eighty-fourth year. I could  wish that I had been able to make the same boast as Cyrus; but, after  all, I can say this: I am not indeed as vigorous as I was as a private  soldier in the Punic war, or as quaestor in the same war, or as consul  in Spain, and four years later when as a military tribune I took part in  the engagement at Thermopylae under the consul Manius Acilius Glabrio;  but yet, as you see, old age has not entirely destroyed my muscles, has  not quite brought me to the ground. The Senate-house does not find all  my vigour gone, nor the rostra, nor my friends, nor my clients, nor  my foreign guests. For I have never given in to that ancient and  much-praised proverb:         Old when young       Is old for long.    For myself, I had rather be an old man a somewhat shorter time than  an old man _before_ my time. "]]]
