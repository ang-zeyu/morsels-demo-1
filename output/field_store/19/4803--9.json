Contemptuous eyewitnesses described her very well as looking  like a tin can on a shingle or a cheesebox on a raft. She carried  only two guns, eleven-inchers, both mounted inside her turret,  which revolved by machinery; but their 180-pound shot were far  more powerful than any aboard the _Merrimac_. In maneuvering the  _Monitor_ enjoyed an immense advantage, with her light draft, strong  engines, and well-protected screws and rudder.    On the eighth of March, a lovely spring day, the _Merrimac_ made  her trial trip by going into action with her wheezy old engines,  lubberly crew, and the guns she had never yet fired. She shoveled  along at only five knots; but the Confederate garrisons cheered  her to the echo. Seven miles north she came upon the astonished  fifty-gun _Congress_ and thirty-gun _Cumberland_ swinging drowsily  at anchor off Newport News, with their boats alongside and the  men's wash drying in the rigging. Yet the surprised frigates opened  fire at twelve hundred yards and were joined by the shore batteries,  all converging on the _Merrimac_, from whose iron sides the shot  glanced up without doing more than hammer her hard and start a few  rivets. Closing in at top speed--barely six knots--the _Merrimac_  gave the _Congress_ a broadside before ramming the _Cumberland_  and opening a hole \"wide enough to drive in a horse and cart.\"  Backing clear and turning the after-pivot gun, the _Merrimac_ then  got in three raking shells against the _Congress_, which grounded  when trying to escape. Meanwhile the _Cumberland_ was listing over  and rapidly filling, though she kept up the fight to the very last  gasp. When she sank with a roar her topmasts still showed above  water and her colors waved defiance. An hour later the terribly  mauled _Congress_ surrendered; whereupon her crew was rescued and  she was set on fire. By this time various smaller craft on both  sides had joined the fray. But the big _Minnesota_ still remained,  though aground and apparently at the mercy of the _Merrimac_. The  great draught of the _Merrimac_ and the setting in of the ebb tide,  however, made the Confederates draw off for the night.    Next morning they saw the \"tin can on the shingle\" between them and  their prey. The _Monitor_ and _Merrimac_ then began their epoch-making  fight. The patchwork engines of the deep-draught _Merrimac_ made her  as unhandy as if she had been water-logged, while the light-draught  _Monitor_ could not only play round her when close-to but maneuver  all over the surrounding shallows as well. The _Merrimac_ put her  last ounce of steam into an attempt to ram her agile opponent.  But a touch of the _Monitor's_ helm swung her round just in time  to make the blow perfectly harmless. The _Merrimac_ simply barged  into her, grated harshly against her iron side, and sheered off  beaten. The firing was furious and mostly at pointblank range.  Once the _Monitor_ fired while the sides were actually touching.  The concussion was so tremendous that all the _Merrimac's_ gun-crews  aft were struck down flat, with bleeding ears and noses. But in  spite of this her boarders were called away; whereupon every man  who could handle cutlass and revolver made ready and stood by. The  _Monitor_, however, dropped astern too quickly; and the wallowing  _Merrimac_ had no chance of catching her. The fight had lasted all  through that calm spring morning when the _Monitor_ steamed off,  across the shallows, still keeping carefully between the _Merrimac_  and _Minnesota_. It was a drawn battle. But the effect was that  of a Northern victory; for the _Merrimac_ was balked of her easy  prey, and the North gained time to outbuild the South completely.    Outbuilding the South of course meant tightening the \"anaconda\"  system of blockade, in the entangling coils of which the South  was caught already. Three thousand miles of Southern coastline  was, however, more than the North could blockade or even watch to  its own satisfaction all at once. Fogs, storms, and clever ruses  played their part on behalf of those who ran the blockade, especially  during the first two years; and it was almost more than human nature  could stand to keep forever on the extreme alert, day after dreary  day, through the deadly boredom of a long blockade. Like caged  eagles the crews passed many a weary week of dull monotony without  the chance of swooping on a chase. \"Smoke ho!\" would be called  from the main-topgallant cross-tree. \"Where away?\" would be called  back from the deck. \"Up the river, Sir!\"--and there it would stay,  the very mark of hope deferred. Occasionally a cotton ship would  make a dash, with lights out on a dark night, or through a dense  fog, when her smoke might sometimes be conned from the tops.  Occasionally, too, a foreigner would try to run in, and not seldom  succeed, because only the fastest vessels tried to run the blockade  after the first few months. But the general experience was one of  utter boredom rarely relieved by a stroke of good luck.    The South could not break the blockade. But the North could tighten  it, and did so repeatedly, not only at sea but by establishing  strong strategic centers of its own along the Southern coast. We  have seen already how Hatteras Island was taken in '61, five weeks  after Bull Run. Within another three weeks Ship Island was also taken,  to the great disadvantage of the Gulf ports and the corresponding  advantage of the Federal fleet blockading them; for Ship Island  commanded the coastwise channels between Mobile and New Orleans,  the two great scenes of Farragut's success. Then, on the seventh  of November, the day that Grant began his triumphant career by  dealing the Confederates a shrewd strategic blow at Belmont in  Missouri, South Carolina suffered a worse defeat at Port Royal  (where she lost Forts Beauregard and Walker) than North Carolina  had suffered at Hatteras Island. Admiral S. F. Du Pont managed  the naval part of the Port Royal expedition with consummate skill,  especially the fine fleet action off Hilton Head against the Southern  ships and forts. He was ably seconded by General Thomas West Sherman,  commanding the troops.    North Carolina's turn soon came again, when she lost Roanoke Island  (and with it the command of Albemarle Sound) on February 8, 1862;  and when she also had Pamlico Sound shut against her by a joint  expedition that struck down her defenses as far inland as Newbern  on the fourteenth of March. Then came the turn of Georgia, where  Fort Pulaski, the outpost of Savannah, fell to the Federals on  the eleventh of April. Within another month Florida was even more  hardly hit when the pressure of the Union fleet and army on Virginia  compelled the South to use as reinforcements the garrison that  had held Pensacola since the beginning of the war.    These were all severe blows to the Southern cause. But they were  nothing to the one which immediately followed.    The idea of an attack on New Orleans had been conceived in June,  '61, by Commander (afterwards Admiral) D. D. Porter, of the U.S.S.  _Powhatan_, when he was helping to blockade the Mississippi. The  Navy Department had begun thinking over the same idea in September  and had worked out a definite scheme. New Orleans was of immense  strategic importance, as being the link between the sea and river  systems of the war. The mass of people and their politicians, on  both sides, absurdly thought of New Orleans as the objective of a  land invasion from the north. Happily for the Union cause, Gustavus  Fox, Assistant Secretary of the Navy, knew better and persuaded  his civilian chief, Gideon Welles, that this was work for a joint  expedition, with the navy first, the army second. The navy could  take New Orleans. The army would have to hold it.    The squadron destined for this enterprise was commanded by David  Glasgow Farragut, who arrived at Ship Island on February 20, 1862,  in the _Hartford_, the famous man-of-war that carried his flag in  triumph to the end. Unlike Lee and Jackson, Grant and Sherman,  the other four great leaders in the Civil War, Farragut was not an  American whose ancestors on both sides had come from the British  Isles. Like Lee, however, he was of very ancient lineage, one of  his ancestors, Don Pedro Farragut, having held a high command under  the King of Aragon in the Moorish wars of the thirteenth century.  Farragut's father was a pure-blooded Spaniard, born under the British  flag in Minorca in 1755. Half Spanish, half Southern by descent,  Farragut was wholly Southern by family environment. His mother,  Elizabeth Shine, was a native of North Carolina. He spent his early  boyhood in New Orleans. Both his first and second wives came from  Virginia; and he made his home at Norfolk. On the outbreak of the  war, however, he immediately went North and applied for employment  with the Union fleet.    Farragut was the oldest of the five great leaders, being now sixty  years of age, while Lee was fifty-five, Sherman forty-two, Grant  forty, and Jackson thirty-eight. He was, however, fit as an athlete  in training, able to turn a handspring on his birthday and to hold  his own in swordsmanship against any of his officers. Of middle  height, strong build, and rather plain features, he did not attract  attention in a crowd. But his alert and upright carriage, keenly  interested look, and genial smile impressed all who ever knew him  with a sense of native kindliness and power. Though far too great  a master of the art of war to interfere with his subordinates he  always took care to understand their duties from their own points  of view so that he could control every part of the complex naval  instruments of war--human and material alike--with a sure and inspiring  touch. His one weakness as a leader was his generous inclination  to give"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26490"],[0,"Lord Milner's Work in South Africa (#12)"],[1," the dangerous situation of the years that followed it.  The Raid tore aside the veil which the Rhodes-Hofmeyr alliance had  cast over the eyes alike of Dutch and British, and left them free to  see the essential antagonism of aim between the two men in its naked  truth.[24] From that moment Rhodes was recognised by the Bond as its  chief and most dangerous enemy; and as such he was pursued by its  bitterest hostility to the day of his death; while Rhodes, on the  other hand, was driven to seek support solely in the people of his own  nationality. From that moment the Bond fell back upon the policy of  1881. The Dutch Press, pulpit, and platform commenced an active  nationalist propaganda on the old racial lines; and the advocacy of  anti-British aims increased in boldness and in definiteness as the  Transvaal grew strong with its inflowing armaments.             [Footnote 24: _Ons Land_, reputed to be controlled by Hofmeyr           himself, and certainly the recognised organ of the Bond,           published a paean of triumph over the surrender of Dr.           Jameson's troopers at Doornkop. \"Afrikanderdom has awakened           to a sense of earnestness which we have not observed since           the heroic war of liberty in 1881. From the Limpopo, as far           as Capetown, the second Majuba has given birth to a new           inspiration and a new movement amongst our people in South           Africa.... The flaccid and cowardly imperialism that had           already begun to dilute and weaken our national blood,           gradually turned aside before the new current that permeated           our people.... Now or never the foundation of a           wide-embracing nationalism must be laid.... The partition           wall has disappeared ... never has the necessity for a policy           of a colonial and republican union been greater; now the           psychological moment has arrived; now our people have           awakened all over South Africa; a new glow illumines our           hearts; let us lay the foundation-stone of a real United           South Africa on the soil of a pure and all-comprehensive           national sentiment.\"]    [Sidenote: Effects of the raid.]    We are now in a position to sum up the main features of the situation  in South Africa as Lord Milner found it. British administration,  controlled from Downing Street, had quickly led to what Sir George  Grey called the dismemberment of European South Africa. The Imperial  Government, having found out its mistake, had endeavoured to regain  the lost solidarity of the European communities and its authority over  them, by bringing the Republics into a federal system under the  British Crown. It had been thwarted in this endeavour by the military  resistance of the Boers in the Transvaal, and the fear of a like  resistance on the part of the Dutch population throughout South  Africa. Its impotency had invited, and in part justified, the efforts  made by local British initiative to solve the problem of South African  unity on South African lines, but in a manner consistent with the  maintenance of British supremacy. The early success of these efforts,  prosecuted mainly through the agency of Rhodes, had been obliterated  by the Jameson Raid. All attempts to secure the reunion of South  Africa under the British flag having failed alike under Imperial and  local British initiative, the way was open for the Afrikander  nationalists once more to put forward the alternative plan of a united  South Africa under its own flag, which they had formulated in the year  immediately following the retrocession of the Transvaal.    In proportion as the friends and supporters of British supremacy were  discredited and depressed by the catastrophe of the Raid, the  advocates and promoters of Afrikander nationalism were emboldened and  encouraged. It was not Sir Gordon Sprigg, the Prime Minister of the  Cape who succeeded the discredited Rhodes (January 13th, 1896), but  Mr. Hofmeyr, the veteran leader of the Afrikander Bond, that dictated  the policy which Lord Rosmead must pursue to re-establish the  integrity of the Imperial Government in the minds of its Dutch  subjects. At the next presidential election in the Free State (March  4th, 1896), Mr. J. G. Fraser, the head of the moderate party which  followed in the steps of President Brand, was hopelessly beaten by Mr.  Marthinus Steyn, an Afrikander nationalist of the scientific school of  Borckenhagen, and a politician whose immediate programme included the  \"closer union\" of that state with the South African Republic, the  terms of which were finally settled at Bloemfontein on March 9th,  1897. In the Cape Colony the Bond organised its resources with a view  of securing even more complete control of the Cape Legislature at the  general election of 1898. And lastly, President Krueger, who had  ceased to rely upon Holland for administrative talent, and opened the  lucrative offices of the South African Republic to the ambitious and  educated Afrikander youth of the Free State and Cape Colony, commenced  methodically and secretly to supply arms and ammunition to the  adherents of the nationalist cause in the British Colonies.    [Sidenote: Situation in 1896.]    But disastrous as was the Jameson Raid in its method of execution and  immediate effects, it produced certain results that cannot be held to  have been prejudicial to the British cause in South Africa, if once we  recognise the fact that the English people as a whole were totally  ignorant, at the time of its occurrence, of the extent to which the  sub-continent had already slipped from their grasp. Something of the  long advance towards the goal of nationalist ambition, achieved by the  Bond, was revealed. The emphatic cry of \"Hands off\" to Germany, for  which the Kaiser's telegram of congratulation provided the occasion,  was undoubtedly the means of arresting the progress of that power, at  a point when further progress would have gained her a foot-hold in  South Africa from which nothing short of actual hostilities could have  dislodged her. And more important still was the fact that the Raid,  with its train of dramatic incidents, had published, once and for all,  the humiliating position of the British population in the Transvaal  throughout the length and breadth of the Anglo-Saxon world, and  compelled the Imperial Government to pledge itself to obtain the  redress of the \"admitted grievances\" of the Uitlanders.    [Sidenote: Mr. Chamberlain's policy.]    Against the rallying forces of Afrikander nationalism Mr. Chamberlain,  for the moment, had nothing to oppose but the vague and as yet unknown  power of an awakened Imperial sentiment. Lord Rosmead's attitude at  Pretoria had convinced him of the uselessness of expecting that any  satisfactory settlement of the franchise question could be brought  about through the agency of the High Commissioner. He, therefore,  invited President Krueger to visit England in the hope that his own  personal advocacy of the cause of the Uitlanders, backed up by the  weight of the Salisbury Government, might remove the \"root causes\" of  Transvaal unrest. But President Krueger refused to confer with the  Colonial Secretary upon any other than the wholly inadmissible basis  of the conversion of the London Convention into a treaty of amity such  as one independent power might conclude with another. Mr. Chamberlain,  therefore, having put upon record that the purpose of the proposed  conference was to give effect to the London Convention and not to  destroy it, proceeded to formulate a South African policy that would  enable him to make the most effective use of the authority of Great  Britain as paramount Power. His purpose was to win Dutch opinion in  the Free State and the Cape Colony to the side of the Imperial  Government, and then to use this more progressive Dutch opinion as  the fulcrum by which the lever of Imperial remonstrance was to be  successfully applied to the Transvaal Government. In the speech[25] in  which he sketched the main lines of this policy he declared  emphatically that the paramount power of England was to be maintained  at all costs, that foreign intervention would not be permitted under  any pretence, and that the admitted grievances of the Uitlanders were  to be redressed:             [Footnote 25: 1896.]         \"We have,\" he continued, \"a confident hope that we shall be able       in the course of no lengthened time to restore the situation as       it was before the invasion of the Transvaal, to have at our backs       the sympathy and support of the majority of the Dutch population       in South Africa, and if we have that, the opinion--the united       opinion--which that will constitute, will be an opinion which no       power in Africa can resist.\"    With the record of the last ten years before us it seems strange that  Mr. Chamberlain should ever have believed in the efficacy of such a  policy: still more strange that he should have spoken of his  \"confident hope\" of winning the Afrikander nationalists to support the  paramount Power. But it must be remembered that the evidence of the  real sentiments and purposes of the nationalists here set forth in the  preceding pages, and now the common property of all educated  Englishmen, was then known only to perhaps a dozen journalists and  politicians in England; and if these men had attempted to impart  their knowledge to the general public, they would have failed from the  sheer inability of the average Englishman to believe that \"British  subjects\" under responsible government could be anything but loyal to  the Imperial tie.    But little as Mr. Chamberlain knew of the real strength of the forces  of Afrikander nationalism, he discerned enough of the South African  situation to realise that this policy would have no chance of success,  unless the maintenance of the British cause in South Africa was placed  in the hands of"]]]
