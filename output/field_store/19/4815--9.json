[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27365"],[0,"Tales of Space and Time (#12)"],[1,"Fire!\" they screamed. But he whispered and  passed, and there was nothing but ashes. Then Ugh-lomi danced with anger  and struck the ashes with his fist. But Eudena began to hammer the  firestone against a flint. And the eyes of each were turning ever and  again towards the gully by which Andoo was climbing down. Brother Fire!    Suddenly the huge furry hind-quarters of the bear came into view,  beneath the bulge of the chalk that had hidden him. He was still  clambering gingerly down the nearly vertical surface. His head was yet  out of sight, but they could hear him talking to himself. \"Pig and  monkey,\" said the cave bear. \"It ought to be good.\"    Eudena struck a spark and blew at it; it twinkled brighter and  then--went out. At that she cast down flint and firestone and stared  blankly. Then she sprang to her feet and scrambled a yard or so up the  cliff above the ledge. How she hung on even for a moment I do not know,  for the chalk was vertical and without grip for a monkey. In a couple of  seconds she had slid back to the ledge again with bleeding hands.    Ugh-lomi was making frantic rushes about the ledge--now he would go to  the edge, now to the gully. He did not know what to do, he could not  think. The she-bear looked smaller than her mate--much. If they rushed  down on her together, _one_ might live. \"Ugh?\" said the cave bear, and  Ugh-lomi turned again and saw his little eyes peering under the bulge of  the chalk.    Eudena, cowering at the end of the ledge, began to scream like a gripped  rabbit.    At that a sort of madness came upon Ugh-lomi. With a mighty cry, he  caught up his axe and ran towards Andoo. The monster gave a grunt of  surprise. In a moment Ugh-lomi was clinging to a bush right underneath  the bear, and in another he was hanging to its back half buried in fur,  with one fist clutched in the hair under its jaw. The bear was too  astonished at this fantastic attack to do more than cling passive. And  then the axe, the first of all axes, rang on its skull.    The bear's head twisted from side to side, and he began a petulant  scolding growl. The axe bit within an inch of the left eye, and the hot  blood blinded that side. At that the brute roared with surprise and  anger, and his teeth gnashed six inches from Ugh-lomi's face. Then the  axe, clubbed close, came down heavily on the corner of the jaw.    The next blow blinded the right side and called forth a roar, this time  of pain. Eudena saw the huge, flat feet slipping and sliding, and  suddenly the bear gave a clumsy leap sideways, as if for the ledge. Then  everything vanished, and the hazels smashed, and a roar of pain and a  tumult of shouts and growls came up from far below.    Eudena screamed and ran to the edge and peered over. For a moment, man  and bears were a heap together, Ugh-lomi uppermost; and then he had  sprung clear and was scaling the gully again, with the bears rolling and  striking at one another among the hazels. But he had left his axe below,  and three knob-ended streaks of carmine were shooting down his thigh.  \"Up!\" he cried, and in a moment Eudena was leading the way to the top of  the cliff.    In half a minute they were at the crest, their hearts pumping noisily,  with Andoo and his wife far and safe below them. Andoo was sitting on  his haunches, both paws at work, trying with quick exasperated movements  to wipe the blindness out of his eyes, and the she-bear stood on  all-fours a little way off, ruffled in appearance and growling angrily.  Ugh-lomi flung himself flat on the grass, and lay panting and bleeding  with his face on his arms.    For a second Eudena regarded the bears, then she came and sat beside  him, looking at him....    Presently she put forth her hand timidly and touched him, and made the  guttural sound that was his name. He turned over and raised himself on  his arm. His face was pale, like the face of one who is afraid. He  looked at her steadfastly for a moment, and then suddenly he laughed.  \"Waugh!\" he said exultantly.    \"Waugh!\" said she--a simple but expressive conversation.    Then Ugh-lomi came and knelt beside her, and on hands and knees peered  over the brow and examined the gorge. His breath was steady now, and the  blood on his leg had ceased to flow, though the scratches the she-bear  had made were open and wide. He squatted up and sat staring at the  footmarks of the great bear as they came to the gully--they were as wide  as his head and twice as long. Then he jumped up and went along the  cliff face until the ledge was visible. Here he sat down for some time  thinking, while Eudena watched him. Presently she saw the bears had  gone.    At last Ugh-lomi rose, as one whose mind is made up. He returned towards  the gully, Eudena keeping close by him, and together they clambered to  the ledge. They took the firestone and a flint, and then Ugh-lomi went  down to the foot of the cliff very cautiously, and found his axe. They  returned to the cliff as quietly as they could, and set off at a brisk  walk. The ledge was a home no longer, with such callers in the  neighbourhood. Ugh-lomi carried the axe and Eudena the firestone. So  simple was a Palaeolithic removal.    They went up-stream, although it might lead to the very lair of the  cave bear, because there was no other way to go. Down the stream was the  tribe, and had not Ugh-lomi killed Uya and Wau? By the stream they had  to keep--because of drinking.    So they marched through beech trees, with the gorge deepening until the  river flowed, a frothing rapid, five hundred feet below them. Of all the  changeful things in this world of change, the courses of rivers in deep  valleys change least. It was the river Wey, the river we know to-day,  and they marched over the very spots where nowadays stand little  Guildford and Godalming--the first human beings to come into the land.  Once a grey ape chattered and vanished, and all along the cliff edge,  vast and even, ran the spoor of the great cave bear.    And then the spoor of the bear fell away from the cliff, showing,  Ugh-lomi thought, that he came from some place to the left, and keeping  to the cliff's edge, they presently came to an end. They found  themselves looking down on a great semi-circular space caused by the  collapse of the cliff. It had smashed right across the gorge, banking  the up-stream water back in a pool which overflowed in a rapid. The slip  had happened long ago. It was grassed over, but the face of the cliffs  that stood about the semicircle was still almost fresh-looking and white  as on the day when the rock must have broken and slid down. Starkly  exposed and black under the foot of these cliffs were the mouths of  several caves. And as they stood there, looking at the space, and  disinclined to skirt it, because they thought the bears' lair lay  somewhere on the left in the direction they must needs take, they saw  suddenly first one bear and then two coming up the grass slope to the  right and going across the amphitheatre towards the caves. Andoo was  first; he dropped a little on his fore-foot and his mien was despondent,  and the she-bear came shuffling behind.    Eudena and Ugh-lomi stepped back from the cliff until they could just  see the bears over the verge. Then Ugh-lomi stopped. Eudena pulled his  arm, but he turned with a forbidding gesture, and her hand dropped.  Ugh-lomi stood watching the bears, with his axe in his hand, until they  had vanished into the cave. He growled softly, and shook the axe at the  she-bear's receding quarters. Then to Eudena's terror, instead of  creeping off with her, he lay flat down and crawled forward into such a  position that he could just see the cave. It was bears--and he did it  as calmly as if it had been rabbits he was watching!    He lay still, like a barked log, sun-dappled, in the shadow of the  trees. He was thinking. And Eudena had learnt, even when a little girl,  that when Ugh-lomi became still like that, jaw-bone on fist, novel  things presently began to happen.    It was an hour before the thinking was over; it was noon when the two  little savages had found their way to the cliff brow that overhung the  bears' cave. And all the long afternoon they fought desperately with a  great boulder of chalk; trundling it, with nothing but their unaided  sturdy muscles, from the gully where it had hung like a loose tooth,  towards the cliff top. It was full two yards about, it stood as high as  Eudena's waist, it was obtuse-angled and toothed with flints. And when  the sun set it was poised, three inches from the edge, above the cave of  the great cave bear.    In the cave conversation languished during that afternoon. The she-bear  snoozed sulkily in her corner--for she was fond of pig and monkey--and  Andoo was busy licking the side of his paw and smearing his face to cool  the smart and inflammation of his wounds. Afterwards he went and sat  just within the mouth of the cave, blinking out at the afternoon sun  with his uninjured eye, and thinking.    \"I never was so startled in my life,\" he said at last. \"They are the  most extraordinary beasts. Attacking _me_!\"    \"I don't like them,\" said the she-bear, out of the darkness behind.    \"A feebler sort of beast I _never_ saw. I can't think what the world is  coming to. Scraggy, weedy legs.... Wonder how they keep warm in winter?\"    \"Very likely they don't,\" said the she-bear.    \"I suppose it's a sort of monkey gone wrong.\"    \"It's a change,\" said the she-bear.    A pause.    \"The advantage he had was merely accidental,\" said Andoo. \"These things  _will_ happen at times.\"    \"_I_ can't understand why you let go,\" said the she-bear.    That matter had been discussed before, and settled. So Andoo, being a  bear of experience, remained silent for a space. Then he resumed upon a  different aspect of the matter. \"He has a sort of claw--a long claw that  he seemed to have first on one paw and then on the other. Just one claw.  They're"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27378"],[0,"The Story of the Heavens (#12)"],[1," luminous clouds which forms the  visible surface of the sun and which we call the photosphere. The  gaseous envelope from which the prominences spring has been called the  chromosphere on account of the coloured lines displayed in its spectrum.  Such lines are very numerous, but those pertaining to the single  substance, hydrogen, predominate so greatly that we may say the  chromosphere consists chiefly of this element. It is, however, to be  noted that calcium and one other element are also invariably present,  while iron, manganese and magnesium are often apparent. The remarkable  element, of which we have not yet mentioned the name, has had an  astonishing history.    During the eclipse of 1868 a fine yellow line was noticed among the  lines of the prominence spectrum, and it was not unnaturally at first  assumed that it must be the yellow sodium line. But when careful  observations were afterwards made without hurry in full sunshine, and  accurate measures were obtained, it was at once remarked that this line  was not identical with either of the components of the double sodium  line. The new line was, no doubt, quite close to the sodium lines, but  slightly towards the green part of the spectrum. It was also noticed  there was not generally any corresponding line to be seen among the dark  lines in the ordinary solar spectrum, though a fine dark one has now and  then been detected, especially near a sun-spot. Sir Norman Lockyer and  Sir Edward Frankland showed that this was not produced by any known  terrestrial element. It was, therefore, supposed to be caused by some  hitherto unknown body to which the name of _helium_, or the sun element,  was given. About a dozen less conspicuous lines were gradually  identified in the spectrum of the prominences and the chromosphere,  which appeared also to be caused by this same mysterious helium. These  same remarkable lines have in more recent years also been detected in  the spectra of various stars.    This gas so long known in the heavens was at last detected on earth. In  April, 1895, Professor Ramsay, who with Lord Rayleigh had discovered the  new element argon, detected the presence of the famous helium line in  the spectrum of the gas liberated by heating the rare mineral known as  cleveite, found in Norway. Thus this element, the existence of which had  first been detected on the sun, ninety-three million miles away, has at  last been proved to be a terrestrial element also.    When it was announced by Runge that the principal line in the spectrum  of the terrestrial helium had a faint and very close companion line on  the red-ward side, some doubt seemed at first to be cast on the identity  of the new terrestrial gas discovered by Ramsay with the helium of the  chromosphere. The helium line of the latter had never been noticed to be  double. Subsequently, however, several observers provided with very  powerful instruments found that the famous line in the chromosphere  really had a very faint companion line. Thus the identity between the  celestial helium and the gas found on our globe was established in the  most remarkable manner. Certain circumstances have seemed to indicate  that the new gas might possibly be a mixture of two gases of different  densities, but up to the present this has not been proved to be the  case.    After it had been found possible to see the spectra of prominences  without waiting for an eclipse, Sir W. Huggins, in an observation on the  13th of February, 1869, successfully applied a method for viewing the  remarkable solar objects themselves instead of their mere spectra in  full sunshine. It is only necessary to adjust the spectroscope so that  one of the brightest lines--_e.g._ the red hydrogen line--is in the  middle of the field of the viewing telescope, and then to open wide the  slit of the spectroscope. A red image of the prominence will then be  displayed instead of the mere line. In fact, when the slit is opened  wide, the prisms produce a series of detached images of the prominence  under observation, one for each kind of light which the object emits.    We have spoken of the spectroscope as depending upon the action of glass  prisms. It remains to be added that in the highest class of  spectroscopes the prisms are replaced by ruled gratings from which the  light is reflected. The effect of the ruling is to produce by what is  known as diffraction the required breaking up of the beam of light into  its constituent parts.    [Illustration: PLATE IV.    SOLAR PROMINENCES.    (DRAWN BY TROUVELOT AT HARVARD COLLEGE, CAMBRIDGE, U.S., IN 1872.)]    Majestic indeed are the proportions of some of those mighty prominences  which leap from the luminous surface; yet they flicker, as do our  terrestrial flames, when we allow them time comparable to their gigantic  dimensions. Drawings of the same prominence made at intervals of a few  hours, or even less, often show great changes. The magnitude of the  displacements that have been noticed sometimes attains many thousands of  miles, and the actual velocity with which such masses move frequently  exceeds 100 miles a second. Still more violent are the convulsions when,  from the surface of the chromosphere, as from a mighty furnace, vast  incandescent masses of gas are projected upwards. Plate IV. gives a view  of a number of prominences as seen by Trouvelot at Harvard College  Observatory, Cambridge, U.S.A. Trouvelot has succeeded in exhibiting in  the different pictures the wondrous variety of aspect which these  objects assume. The dimensions of the prominences may be inferred from  the scale appended to the plate. The largest of those here shown is  fully 80,000 miles high; and trustworthy observers have recorded  prominences of an altitude even much greater. The rapid changes which  these objects sometimes undergo are well illustrated in the two sketches  on the left of the lowest line, which were drawn on April 27th, 1872.  These are both drawings of the same prominence taken at an interval no  greater than twenty minutes. This mighty flame is so vast that its  length is ten times as great as the diameter of the earth, yet in this  brief period it has completely changed its aspect; the upper part of the  flame has, indeed, broken away, and is now shown in that part of the  drawing between the two figures on the line above. The same plate also  shows various instances of the remarkable spike-like objects, taken,  however, at different times and at various parts of the sun. These  spikes attain altitudes not generally greater than 20,000 miles, though  sometimes they soar aloft to stupendous distances.    We may refer to one special object of this kind, the remarkable history  of which has been chronicled by Professor Young. On October 7th, 1880, a  prominence was seen, at about 10.30 a.m., on the south-east limb of the  sun. It was then about 40,000 miles high, and attracted no special  attention. Half an hour later a marvellous transformation had taken  place. During that brief interval the prominence became very brilliant  and doubled its length. For another hour the mighty flame still soared  upwards, until it attained the unprecedented elevation of 350,000  miles--a distance more than one-third the diameter of the great luminary  itself. At this climax the energy of the mighty outbreak seems to have  at last become exhausted: the flame broke up into fragments, and by  12.30--an interval of only two hours from the time when it was first  noticed--the phenomenon had completely faded away.    No doubt this particular eruption was exceptional in its vehemence, and  in the vastness of the changes of which it was an indication. The  velocity of upheaval must have been at least 200,000 miles an hour, or,  to put it in another form, more than fifty miles a second. This mighty  flame leaped from the sun with a velocity more than 100 times as great  as that of the swiftest bullet ever fired from a rifle.    The prominences may be generally divided into two classes. We have first  those which are comparatively quiescent, and in form somewhat resemble  the clouds which float in our earth's atmosphere. The second class of  prominences are best described as eruptive. They are, in fact, thrown up  from the chromosphere like gigantic jets of incandescent material. These  two classes of objects differ not only in appearance but also in the  gases of which they are composed. The cloud-like prominences consist  mainly of hydrogen, with helium and calcium, while many metals are  present in the eruptive discharges. The latter are never seen in the  neighbourhood of the sun's poles, but generally appear close to a  sun-spot, thus confirming the conclusion that the spots are associated  with violent disturbances on the surface of the sun. When a spot has  reached the limb of the sun it is frequently found to be surrounded by  prominences. It has even been possible in a few instances to detect  powerful gaseous eruptions in the neighbourhood of a spot, the  spectroscope rendering them visible against the background of the solar  surface just as the prominences are observed at the limb against the  background of the sky.    In order to photograph a prominence we have, of course, to substitute a  photographic plate for the observer's eye. Owing, however, to the  difficulty of preventing the feeble light from the prominence from being  overpowered by extraneous light, the photography of these bodies was not  very successful until Professor Hale, of Chicago, designed his  spectro-heliograph. In this instrument there is (in addition to the  usual slit through which the light falls on the prisms, or grating,) a  second slit immediately in front of the photographic plate through which  the light of a given wave-length can be permitted to pass to the  exclusion of all the rest. The light chosen for producing an image of  the prominences is that radiated in the remarkable \"K line,\" due to  calcium."]]]
