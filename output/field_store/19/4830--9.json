As Stanilaus Augustus, the last king of Poland, was a tool of Russia,  and did not enjoy any consideration, the Polish grandees played him  many tricks. Prince Radziwill came to court in a carriage drawn by six  wild bears;--the horses of course, were extremely frightened; in  consequence of which, some accidents happened. The king pointed out to  the prince the impropriety of his conduct. Radziwill added, that the  bears were not cross, as whip, gold, and patience can put in order  every thing; He added also, that, sometimes the ace beats the king at  cards, and paid liberally the damages. After some time, he gave a  splendid party, to which he invited all the ambassadors, and all the  leading personages in Poland, and displayed extraordinary luxury. The  dancing was kept up in several drawing rooms. After the supper, he  conducted a select parly to a separate apartment--where, to their  astonishment, they found four girls of uncommon beauty, richly  dressed, in company not with four gentlemen, but with four enormous  bears!--which, after the first outbreak of music, began to dance with  the girls all the figures of French quadrilles, with the utmost  accuracy, and with as much ease as if they were highly educated  gentlemen. At first the guests were alarmed; but, seeing the extra  ordinary tameness of the beasts, struck with amazement, they seemed to  have been pleased with this extraordinary sight. After the dance was  over, their bear-ships conducted themselves with the utmost propriety,  and, at a sign from the keeper, each of them made a bow to his lady,  and withdrew to another room. For some time, nothing was talked of at  Warsaw but that singular ball.           *       *       *       *       *          ALL IS NOT GOLD THAT GLITTERS.      A lady, at a ball lately given in Calcutta, attracted the attention of  all, and excited the jealousy of many, in consequence of the splendor  and brilliancy which her diamonds shed upon her person and all around  her. At length that curiosity which is the moving spring of woman's  actions, could be no longer resisted by her female admirers, who at  the close of the ball, instituted a rigid examination of the nature of  those incomparable brilliants, when, to their astonishment, they found  that they were no more or less than so many fire flies, which the envy  of the ball-room had secured in gauze bags, and which as she moved  about, fluttered, and thus threw out their varied brilliant hues.           *       *       *       *       *      The Odd Fellows procession to the dedication of their new Hall at  Philadelphia, says our exchanges \"_came off_ on Thursday\".

(By the particular request of a \"Mechanic\" in Cherryfield, Me.)--In  this art the process is various according to the circumstances, and  the ground on subjects to which it is applied. In painting common  chairs, the ground is prepared by a coat of paint composed of ivory  black and rose-pink,--equal quantities, ground in a mixture of equal  parts of linseed oil, drying japan and spirits of turpentine.--When  this is dry, the graining color, consisting of three parts of  rose-pink with one of vermillion, ground in a mixture of oil, japan  and spirits of turpentine, is applied with a common flat graining  brush. Fancy boxes and cabinet furniture are painted by a different  process, by which a better imitation is produced. The ground is  prepared by one or more coats of white lead changed two or three  shades with yellow ochre. When dry, a thin staining of burnt  terra-de-sienna ground in water, containing a very little sugar or  gumarabic is laid on the work, and while this continues moist and  flowing, the graining is applied. The graining should consist of a  mixture of black and rose pink, ground in the staining compound. This  must be varnished when dry, with copal varnish. Some prefer, however,  to grind the staining and graining in oil, diluted with spirits of  turpentine. The learner must have some sample pieces of varnished  rosewood before him when graining.           *       *       *       *       *          INDIA RUBBER.      The substance called India Rubber, or Caoutchouc, was not known in  Europe until the beginning of the eighteenth century. It was  originally brought as a great curiosity from South America. Europeans  continued ignorant of its origin until a deputation of the French  Academicians undertook a voyage to South America in 1735, for the  purpose of obtaining the correct admeasurement of a degree of the  meridian. These philosophers did not confine their attention to the  one great object of their pursuit, but among other interesting  discoveries made themselves acquainted with that peculiar  substance--caoutchouc. These Academicians discovered at Emeralds, in  Brazil, trees called by the natives _heve_, whence flowed a juice,  which, when dried, proved to be what is called India Rubber. The  _heve_ was also found growing in Cayenne, and on the banks of the  Amazon river. It has since been discovered that caoutchouc may be  obtained from another species of tree"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27868"],[0,"The Glow-Worm and Other Beetles (#12)"],[1," a  couple of inches deep which they carefully fill up after laying their  eggs there in a heap. This laying is repeated three or four times  over, at intervals of a few days during the same season. For each  batch of eggs the female digs a special hole, which she does not fail  to fill up afterwards. This takes place in April and May.    [Footnote 2: Jean Baptiste Godart (1775-1823), the principal editor of  _L'Histoire naturelle des lepidopteres de France_.--_Translator's  Note_.]    [Footnote 3: Baron Karl de Geer (1720-1778), the Swedish entomologist,  author of _Memoires pour servir a l'histoire des insectes_  (1752-1778).--_Translator's Note_.]    The number of eggs laid in a single batch is really prodigious. In the  first batch, which, it is true, is the most prolific of all, _Meloe  proscarabaeus_, according to Newport's calculations, produces the  astonishing number of 4,218 eggs, which is double the number of eggs  laid by a Sitaris. And what must the number be, when we allow for the  two or three batches that follow the first! The Sitares, entrusting  their eggs to the very corridors through which the Anthophora is bound  to pass, spare their larvae a host of dangers which the larvae of the  Meloe have to run, for these, born far from the dwellings of the Bees,  are obliged to make their own way to their hymenopterous  foster-parents. The Oil-beetles, therefore, lacking the instinct of  the Sitares, are endowed with incomparably greater fecundity. The  richness of their ovaries atones for the insufficiency of instinct by  proportioning the number of germs in accordance with the risks of  destruction. What transcendent harmony is this, which thus holds the  scales between the fecundity of the ovaries and the perfection of  instinct!    The hatching of the eggs takes place at the end of May or in June,  about a month after they are laid. The eggs of the Sitares also are  hatched after the same lapse of time. But the Meloe-larvae, more  greatly favoured, are able to set off immediately in search of the  Bees that are to feed them; while those of the Sitares, hatched in  September, have to wait motionless and in complete abstinence for the  emergence of the Anthophorae the entrance to whose cells they guard. I  will not describe the young Meloe-larva, which is sufficiently well  known, in particular by the description and the diagram furnished by  Newport. To enable the reader to understand what follows, I will  confine myself to stating that this primary larva is a sort of little  yellow louse, long and slender, found in the spring in the down of  different Bees.    How has this tiny creature made its way from the underground lodging  where the eggs are hatched to the fleece of a Bee? Newport suspects  that the young Oil-beetles, on emerging from their natal burrow, climb  upon the neighbouring plants, especially upon the Cichoriceae, and  wait, concealed among the petals, until a few Bees chance to plunder  the flower, when they promptly fasten on to their fur and allow  themselves to be borne away by them. I have more than Newport's  suspicions upon this curious point; my personal observations and  experiments are absolutely convincing. I will relate them as the first  phase of the history of the Bee-louse. They date back to the 23rd of  May, 1858.    A vertical bank on the road from Carpentras to Bedoin is this time the  scene of my observations. This bank, baked by the sun, is exploited by  numerous swarms of Anthophorae, who, more industrious than their  congeners, are in the habit of building, at the entrance to their  corridors, with serpentine fillets of earth, a vestibule, a defensive  bastion in the form of an arched cylinder. In a word, they are swarms  of _A. parietina_. A sparse carpet of turf extends from the edge of  the road to the foot of the bank. The more comfortably to follow the  work of the Bees, in the hope of wresting some secret from them, I had  been lying for a few moments upon this turf, in the very heart of the  inoffensive swarm, when my clothes were invaded by legions of little  yellow lice, running with desperate eagerness through the hairy  thickets of the nap of the cloth. In these tiny creatures, with which  I was powdered here and there as with yellow dust, I soon recognized  an old acquaintance, the young Oil-beetles, whom I now saw for the  first time elsewhere than in the Bees' fur or the interior of their  cells. I could not lose so excellent an opportunity of learning how  these larvae manage to establish themselves upon the bodies of their  foster-parents.    In the grass where, after lying down for a moment, I had caught these  lice were a few plants in blossom, of which the most abundant were  three composites: _Hedypnois polymorpha_, _Senecio gallicus_ and  _Anthemis arvensis_. Now it was on a composite, a dandelion, that  Newport seemed to remember seeing some young Oil-beetles; and my  attention therefore was first of all directed to the plants which I  have named. To my great satisfaction, nearly all the flowers of these  three plants, especially those of the camomile (_Anthemis_) were  occupied by young Oil-beetles in greater or lesser numbers. On one  head of camomile I counted forty of these tiny insects, cowering  motionless in the centre of the florets. On the other hand, I could  not discover any on the flowers of the poppy or of a wild rocket  (_Diplotaxis muralis_) which grew promiscuously among the plants  aforesaid. It seems to me, therefore, that it is only on the composite  flowers that the Meloe-larvae await the Bees' arrival.    In addition to this population encamped upon the heads of the  composites and remaining motionless, as though it had achieved its  object for the moment, I soon discovered yet another, far more  numerous, whose anxious activity betrayed a fruitless search. On the  ground, in the grass, numberless little larvae were running in a great  flutter, recalling in some respects the tumultuous disorder of an  overturned Ant-hill; others were hurriedly climbing to the tip of a  blade of grass and descending with the same haste; others again were  plunging into the downy fluff of the withered everlastings, remaining  there a moment and quickly reappearing to continue their search.  Lastly, with a little attention, I was able to convince myself that  within an area of a dozen square yards there was perhaps not a single  blade of grass which was not explored by several of these larvae.    I was evidently witnessing the recent emergence of the young  Oil-beetles from their maternal lairs. Part of them had already  settled on the groundsel- and camomile-flowers to await the arrival of  the Bees; but the majority were still wandering in search of this  provisional refuge. It was by this wandering population that I had  been invaded when I lay down at the foot of the bank. It was  impossible that all these larvae, the tale of whose alarming thousands  I would not venture to define, should form one family and recognize a  common mother; despite what Newport has told us of the Oil-beetles'  astonishing fecundity, I could not believe this, so great was their  multitude.    Though the green carpet was continued for a considerable distance  along the side of the road, I could not detect a single Meloe-larva  elsewhere than in the few square yards lying in front of the bank  inhabited by the Mason-bee. These larvae therefore could not have come  far; to find themselves near the Anthophorae they had had no long  pilgrimage to make, for there was not a sign of the inevitable  stragglers and laggards that follow in the wake of a travelling  caravan. The burrows in which the eggs were hatched were therefore in  that turf opposite the Bees' abode. Thus the Oil-beetles, far from  laying their eggs at random, as their wandering life might lead one to  suppose, and leaving their young to the task of approaching their  future home, are able to recognize the spots haunted by the  Anthophorae and lay their eggs in the near neighbourhood of those  spots.    With such a multitude of parasites occupying the composite flowers in  close proximity to the Anthophora's nests, it is impossible that the  majority of the swarm should not become infested sooner or later. At  the time of my observations, a comparatively tiny proportion of the  starving legion was waiting on the flowers; the others were still  wandering on the ground, where the Anthophorae very rarely alight; and  yet I detected the presence of several Meloe-larvae in the thoracic  down of nearly all the Anthophorae which I caught and examined.    I have also found them on the bodies of the Melecta- and  Coelioxys-bees,[4] who are parasitic on the Anthophorae. Suspending  their audacious patrolling before the galleries under construction,  these spoilers of the victualled cells alight for an instant on a  camomile-flower and lo, the thief is robbed! A tiny, imperceptible  louse has slipped into the thick of the downy fur and, at the moment  when the parasite, after destroying the Anthophora's egg, is laying  her own upon the stolen honey, will creep upon this egg, destroy it in  its turn and remain sole mistress of the provisions. The mess of honey  amassed by the Anthophora will thus pass through the hands of three  owners and remain finally the property of the weakest of the three.    [Footnote 4: Cf. _The Mason-bees_: chaps. viii. and ix.--_Translator's  Note_.]    And who shall say whether the Meloe, in its turn, will not be  dispossessed by a fresh thief; or even whether it will not, in the  state of a drowsy, fat and flabby larva, fall a prey to some marauder  who will munch its live entrails? As we meditate upon this deadly,  implacable struggle which nature imposes, for their preservation, on  these different creatures, which are by turns possessors and  dispossessed, devourers and devoured, a painful impression mingles  with the wonder aroused by the means employed by each parasite to  "]]]
