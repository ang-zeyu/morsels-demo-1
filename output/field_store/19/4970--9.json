The Fixed clamp, No. 128, represented in the figure of the large sliding  microtome, serves to clamp the specimen in position and does not allow  any further adjustment.    The Ball and Socket clamp permits the adjustments of the specimen after  it is held in the clamp by means of a ball and socket joint--see figure  of No. 129--a set-screw then holds it firmly in position.    The Naples clamp permits the accurate adjustment of the specimen at any  level, the clamp being supported on two horizontal axes at right angles  to each other, the one controlled by rack and pinion, the other by  endless screw.    The knife-carrier is arranged to hold the Thoma form knives, which are  fastened by means of a wing-screw.

(#12)"],[1,"of Mars is relatively deeper than that of the Earth, so  that we, in observing the details of its surface, are looking down through  an immense thickness of an obscuring medium. And yet the details of the  surface are seen with remarkable distinctness; not as clearly indeed as we  can see those of the Moon, but nearly so. For instance, the \"canals\"  appear to have a breadth of from 15 to 20 miles, corresponding to 1/16th,  and 1/12th, of a second of arc, at an average opposition. The oases, as a  rule, are about 120 miles in diameter, that is to say about half a second  of arc. These are extraordinarily fine details to be perceived and held,  even if Mars had no atmosphere at all; it would certainly be impossible to  detect them unless the atmosphere were exceedingly thin and transparent.  For we must remember that, though our own atmosphere is a hindrance to our  observing, yet the atmosphere of the planet into which we are looking is a  greater hindrance still. Like the lace curtains of the window of a house,  it is a much greater obstacle to looking inward than to looking outward,  and as the perfect distinctness with which we see the Moon is a proof that  it is practically without an atmosphere, so the great detail visible on  Mars bears unmistakable testimony to the slightness of the atmospheric  veil around that planet.    And when we turn again to the statistics of Mars, we see that this must  inevitably be the case. Of two planets, one heavier than the other, it is  not possible to suppose that the lighter should secure the greater  proportional amount of atmosphere. With planets, as with persons, it is  the most powerful that gets the lion's share: \"to him that hath it is  given, and from him that hath not is taken away even that which he seemeth  to have.\" But if we assume that Mars has acquired an atmosphere  proportional to its mass, then we see from the Table that this must be a  little less than 1/9th of that of the Earth; exactly 0.107. It is  distributed over a smaller surface, 0.285. Consequently the amount of air  above each square inch of Martian surface is 0.107 / 0.285 = 0.38. But  since the force of gravity at the surface of Mars is less than on the  Earth, this column of air will only weigh 0.38 x 0.38 = 0.145; or  one-seventh of the column of air resting on a square inch of the Earth's  surface. The pressure at the surface of Mars will therefore be 2.1 lb.;  and the aneroid barometer would read 4.3 inches. (In order to express the  diminished pressure of the Martian atmosphere, it is necessary to refer it  to the aneroid barometer. The mercury in a mercurial barometer, or the  water in a water barometer would lose in weight in consequence of the  diminished force of gravity in the same proportion as the air would, and  the mercurial barometer would read 11.4 inches.)    But a pressure of 2.1 lb. on the square inch is far less than that  experienced by Coxwell and Glaisher in their great ascent; it is about  one-half the pressure that is experienced on the top of the very highest  terrestrial mountains. But the habitable regions of the Earth do not  extend even so far upward as to the level of a pressure of 7.3 lb. on the  square inch; that is, of half the terrestrial surface pressure. Plant life  dies out before we reach that point, and though birds or men may  occasionally attain greater heights, they cannot domicile there, and are,  indeed, only able thus to ascend in virtue of nourishment which they have  procured in more favoured regions. If we could suppose the conditions of  the whole Earth changed to correspond with those prevailing at the summit  of Mt. Everest, or even at the summit of Mont Blanc, it is clear that the  life now present on this planet would be extinguished, and that speedily.  Much more would this be the case if the atmosphere were diminished to one  half the pressure on the summit of the highest earthly mountain.    The tenuity of the atmosphere on Mars has another consequence. Here water  freezes at 0 deg. C. and boils at 100 deg. C.; so that for one hundred degrees it  remains in a liquid condition. On Mars, under the assumed conditions,  water would boil at 53 deg. C., and the range of temperature within which it  would be liquid would be much curtailed. But it is only water in the  liquid state that is useful for sustaining life.    The above estimate of the density of the atmosphere of Mars is an outside  limit, for it assumes that Mars has retained an atmosphere to the full  proportion of its mass. But as the molecules of a gas are in continual  motion, and in every direction, the lighter, most swiftly moving molecules  must occasionally be moving directly outwards from the planet at the top  of their speed, and in this case, if the speed of recession should exceed  that which the gravity of the planet can control, the particle is lost to  the planet for ever. A small planet therefore is subject to a continual  drain upon its atmosphere, a drain of the lightest constituents. Hence it  is, no doubt, that free hydrogen is not a constituent of the atmosphere of  the Earth.    To what extent, then, has the atmosphere of Mars fallen below its full  proportion? Mr. Lowell has adopted an ingenious method of obtaining some  light on this question, by comparing the relative albedoes of the Earth  and Mars; that is to say the relative power of reflection possessed by the  two planets. Of course the method is rough; we have first of all no  satisfactory means of determining the albedo of the Earth itself, and Mr.  Lowell puts it higher than most astronomers would do; then there is the  difficulty of determining what portion of the total albedo is to be  referred to the atmosphere and what to the actual soil or surface of the  planet. But, on the whole, Mr. Lowell concludes that the amount of  atmosphere above the unit of surface of Mars is 0.222 of that above the  unit of surface of the Earth. This would bring down the pressure on each  square inch of Mars to 1.2 lb., and the aneroid barometer would read 2.5  inches; and water would boil at 44 deg. C. The range of temperature from day  to night, from summer to winter, at any place on the planet would be  increased, while the range within which water could retain its liquid form  would be diminished.    These statistics may seem rather dull and tiresome, but if we are to deal  with the problem before us at all, it is important to understand that one  factor in the condition of a planet cannot be altered and all the other  factors retained unchanged. It will be seen that in computing the density  of the atmosphere of Mars, we had to take into consideration not only the  diameter of the planet, but the surface, which varies as the square of the  diameter; the volume, which varies as the cube; the mass, which varies in  a higher power still; and various combinations of these numbers. Novelists  who write tales of journeys to other worlds or of the inhabitants of other  worlds visiting this one, usually assume that the atmosphere is of the  same density on all planets, and the action of gravity unchanged. In their  view it is only that men would have a little less ground to walk upon on  Mars, and a good deal more on Jupiter. Dean Swift, in _Gulliver's  Travels_, made the Lilliputians take a truer view of the effect of the  alteration of one dimension, for, finding that Gulliver was twelve times  as tall as the average Lilliputian, they did not appoint him the rations  of twelve Lilliputians, which would have been rather poor feeding for  that veracious mariner, but allotted him the cube of twelve, viz.  seventeen hundred and twenty-eight rations. Mr. J. Holt Schooling, in one  of his ingenious and interesting statistical papers, tried to bring home  the vast extent of the British Empire by supposing that it seceded, and  taking the portion of Earth that has fallen to it, set up a world of its  own--the planet \"Victoria.\" He allots to the British Empire 21 per cent of  the land surface of the world. If the Earth were divided so as to form two  globes with surfaces in proportion of 21 to 79, the smaller globe, which  would correspond to Mr. Schooling's new planet \"Victoria,\" would be less  than half the present Earth in diameter; it would be considerably smaller  than Mars. But \"the rest of the world\" would be 0.96 of the present Earth  in diameter, or very nearly the size of Venus, and it would contain just  eight-ninths of the substance of the Earth, leaving only one-ninth for  \"Victoria.\" The statistics given above will suggest to the reader that,  could such a secession be carried out, the inhabitants of the British  Empire would not be happier for the change during the very short continued  existence that remained to them. The \"rest of the world\" could spare our  fraction of the planet much better than we could spare theirs.    This is a principle which applies to worlds anywhere; not merely within  the limits of the solar system but wherever they exist. Everywhere the  surface must vary with the square of the diameter; the volume with the  cube; everywhere the smaller planet must have the rarer atmosphere, and  with a rare atmosphere the extreme range of temperature must be great,  while the range of temperature within which water will flow will be  restricted. Our Earth stands as the model of a world of the right size for  the maintenance of life; much smaller than our Earth would be too small;  much larger, as we shall see later, would be too large.    So far we have dealt with Mars as if it received the same amount of light  and heat from the Sun that the Earth does. But, as the Table shows, from  its greater distance from the Sun, Mars receives per unit of surface only  about three-sevenths of the light and heat of that received by the Earth.    The inclination of the axis of Mars is almost the same as that of the  Earth, so that the general character of the seasons is not very different  on the two planets, "]]]
