By this it should seem as if these last  had secretly followed them, probably with hostile intentions but, on  discovering their strength, and that they were on their guard, had  abandoned their design.    On reaching Manly Cove, three Indians were observed standing on a rock,  with whom they entered into conversation. The Indians informed them, that  the man who had wounded the governor belonged to a tribe residing at Broken  Bay, and they seemed highly to condemn what he had done. Our gentlemen  asked them for a spear, which they immediately gave. The boat's crew said  that Baneelon and Colbee had just departed, after a friendly intercourse.  Like the others, they had pretended highly to disapprove the conduct of the  man who had thrown the spear, vowing to execute vengeance upon him.    From this time, until the 14th, no communication passed between the natives  and us. On that day, the chaplain and lieutenant Dawes, having Abaroo with  them in a boat, learned from two Indians that Wileemarin was the name of  the person who had wounded the governor. These two people inquired kindly  how his excellency did, and seemed pleased to hear that he was likely to  recover. They said that they were inhabitants of Rose Hill, and expressed  great dissatisfaction at the number of white men who had settled in their  former territories. In consequence of which declaration, the detachment at  that post was reinforced on the following day.    A hazardous enterprise (but when liberty is the stake, what enterprise is  too hazardous for its attainment!) was undertaken in this month by five  convicts at Rose Hill, who, in the night, seized a small punt there, and  proceeded in her to the South Head, whence they seized and carried off a  boat, appropriated to the use of the lookout house, and put to sea in  her, doubtless with a view of reaching any port they could arrive at, and  asserting their freedom. They had all come out in the last fleet; and for  some time previous to their elopement, had been collecting fishing tackle,  and hoarding up provisions, to enable them to put their scheme into  execution*.    [*They have never since been heard of. Before they went away, they tried in  vain to procure firearms. If they were not swallowed by the sea, probably  they were cut off by the natives, on some part of the coast where their  necessities obliged them to land.]          CHAPTER IX.        Transactions of the Colony in part of September and October, 1790.      From so unfavourable an omen as I have just related, who could  prognosticate that an intercourse with the natives was about to commence!  That the foundation of what neither entreaty, munificence, or humanity,  could induce, should be laid by a deed, which threatened to accumulate  scenes of bloodshed and horror was a consequence which neither speculation  could predict, or hope expect to see accomplished.    On the 15th a fire being seen on the north shore of the harbour, a party  of our people went thither, accompanied by Nanbaree and Abaroo. They found  there Baneelon, and several other natives, and much civility passed, which  was cemented by a mutual promise to meet in the afternoon at the same  place. Both sides were punctual to their engagement, and no objection being  made to our landing, a party of us went ashore to them unarmed. Several  little presents, which had been purposely brought, were distributed among  them; and to Baneelon were given a hatchet and a fish. At a distance stood  some children, who, though at first timorous and unwilling to approach,  were soon persuaded to advance, and join the men.    A bottle of wine was produced, and Baneelon immediately prepared for the  charge. Bread and beef he called loudly for, which were given to him, and  he began to eat, offering a part of his fare to his countrymen, two of whom  tasted the beef, but none of them would touch the bread. Having finished  his repast, he made a motion to be shaved, and a barber being present, his  request was complied with, to the great admiration of his countrymen, who  laughed and exclaimed at the operation. They would not, however, consent  to undergo it, but suffered their beards to be clipped with a pair of  scissors.    On being asked where their women were, they pointed to the spot, but seemed  not desirous that we should approach it. However, in a few minutes, a  female appeared not far off, and Abaroo was dispatched to her. Baneelon  now joined with Abaroo to persuade her to come to us, telling us she was  Barangaroo, and his wife, notwithstanding he had so lately pretended that  she had left him for Colbee. At length she yielded, and Abaroo, having  first put a petticoat on her, brought her to us. But this was the prudery  of the wilderness, which her husband joined us to ridicule, and we soon  laughed her out of it. The petticoat was dropped with hesitation, and  Barangaroo stood \"armed cap-a-pee in nakedness.\" At the request of  Baneelon, we combed and cut her hair, and she seemed pleased with the  operation. Wine she would not taste, but turned from it with disgust,  though heartily invited to drink by the example and persuasion of Baneelon.  In short, she behaved so well, and assumed the character of gentleness and  timidity to such advantage, that had our acquaintance ended here, a very  moderate share of the spirit of travelling would have sufficed to record,  that amidst a horde of roaming savages, in the desert wastes of New South  Wales, might be found as much feminine innocence, softness, and modesty  (allowing for inevitable difference of education), as the most finished  system could bestow, or the most polished circle produce. So little fitted  are we to judge of human nature at once! And yet on such grounds have  countries been described, and nations characterized. Hence have arisen  those speculative and laborious compositions on the advantages and  superiority of a state of nature. But to resume my subject.    Supposing, that by a private conversation, she might be induced to visit  Sydney, which would be the means of drawing her husband and others thither,  Abaroo was instructed to take her aside, and try if she could persuade her  to comply with our wish. They wandered away together accordingly, but it  was soon seen, that Barangaroo's arguments to induce Abaroo to rejoin their  society, were more powerful than those of the latter, to prevail upon her  to come among us; for it was not without manifest reluctance, and often  repeated injunctions, that Abaroo would quit her countrywomen; and when she  had done so, she sat in the boat, in sullen silence, evidently occupied by  reflection on the scene she had left behind, and returning inclination to  her former habits of life.    Nor was a circumstance which had happened in the morning interview,  perhaps, wholly unremembered by the girl. We had hinted to Baneelon to  provide a husband for her, who should be at liberty to pass and repass to  and from Sydney, as he might choose. There was at the time, a slender fine  looking youth in company, called Imeerawanyee, about sixteen years old.  The lad, on being invited, came immediately up to her, and offered many  blandishments, which proved that he had assumed the 'toga virilis'. But  Abaroo disclaimed his advances, repeating the name of another person,  who we knew was her favourite. The young lover was not, however, easily  repulsed, but renewed his suit, on our return in the afternoon, with such  warmth of solicitation, as to cause an evident alteration in the sentiments  of the lady.    To heighten the good humour which pervaded both parties, we began to  play and romp with them. Feats of bodily strength were tried, and their  inferiority was glaring. One of our party lifted with ease two of them from  the ground, in spite of their efforts to prevent him, whereas in return, no  one of them could move him. They called him 'murree mulla' (a large strong  man). Compared with our English labourers, their muscular power would  appear very feeble and inadequate.    Before we parted, Baneelon informed us that his countrymen had lately been  plundered of fish-gigs, spears, a sword, and many other articles, by  some of our people, and expressed a wish that they should be restored,  promising, that if they were, the governor's dirk should be produced and  returned to us to-morrow, if we would meet him here.    Accordingly on the following day we rowed to the spot, carrying with us the  stolen property. We found here several natives, but not Baneelon. We asked  for him, and were told that he was gone down the harbour with Barangaroo to  fish. Although disappointed at his breach of promise, we went on shore, and  mingled without distrust among those we found, acquainting them that we had  brought with us the articles of which they had been plundered. On hearing  this account, they expressed great joy, and Imeerawanyee darting forward,  claimed the sword. It was given to him, and he had no sooner grasped it,  than he hastened to convince his mistress, that his prowess in war, was not  inferior to his skill in courtship. Singling out a yellow gum-tree for the  foe, he attacked it with great fierceness, calling to us to look on, and  accompanying his onset with all the gestures and vociferation which they  use in battle. Having conquered his enemy, he laid aside his fighting face,  and joined us with a countenance which carried in it every mark of youth  and good nature.    Whether Abaroo's coyness, and preference of another, had displeased him, or  it was owing to natural fickleness, he paid her no farther attention, but  seemed more delighted with us. He had no beard, but was highly gratified in  being combed and having his hair clipped.    All the stolen property being brought on shore, an old man came up, and  claimed one of the fish-gigs, singling it from the bundle,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35345"],[0,"The International Monthly, Volume 5, No. 4, April, 1852 (#12)"],[1,"science--stranger still that men are who believe all--all--'tis to  them a spasmodic miracle, and he is an infidel of course who doubts.  Strange too is it, that men do not see here the monstrous power of what  is called Symbolism, and that they should not help nor hinder; who say,  Let the world go--who cares! Men live and women too who say, \"There's  _something_ in it\"--there must be! and is there not? Figure now all this  boundless cunningly devised agglomerate of royal arches, deaths' heads,  hieroglyphically painted screens, \"columns in the state of innocence,  with spacious masonic halls--dark, or in the favorablest theatrical  light-and-dark: Kircher's magic lantern, Belshazzar handwritings (of  phosphorus), plaintive tones, gong-beatings, hoary head of a  supernatural Grand Cophta emerging through the gloom--and how it all  acts, not only directly through the foolish senses of men, but also  indirectly connecting itself with Enoch and Elias, with philanthropy,  immortality,\" &c. Let such as _will_ now say there is nothing in  it--something there is, for a thoughtful man to consider well of, asking  himself what also does this of clairvoyance, and spiritual knockings,  and Jenny-Lind manias, and Jerkers--truly mean? and what kind of a  person am _I who have had_ part and lot with these?    But the lofty science of Egyptian Masonry flourishes, lodges are  established over Europe, and the Grand Master travels hither and  thither, \"mounts to the seat of the Venerable, and holds high discourse,  hours long, on masonry, morality, universal science, divinity, and  things in general,\" with a \"sublimity, and emphasis and unction,\"  proceeding it appears \"from the special inspiration of the Holy Ghost.\"  He is received with shouts and exultation--every where the great heart  of man thrills at the coming of this mystic symbol, which  contains--cunningly enfolded, as their eyes can and do see--every  virtue, every greatness--is he not indeed the Incarnation of these, and  therefore to be worshipped; such gift of reverence is in the heart of  man, and to such things does he again and again bow down!    To go on. Cheers, and the ravishment of thronging audiences can make him  maudlin; render him louder in eloquence of theory; and \"philanthropy,\"  \"divine science,\" \"depth of unknown worlds,\" \"finer feelings of the  heart\"--and so shall draw tears from most asses of sensibility. \"The few  reasoning mortals scattered here and there, that see through him,  deafened in the universal hub-bub, shut their lips in sorrowful disdain,  _confident in the grand remedy, Time_.\" So says our author, and can we  blame him? Will the reader allow the current of this prosperity to be  checked for one moment by a certain Count M.? One of the chosen few at  Warsaw, who having spent the night with the \"dear Master,\" in conversing  with spirits, had returned to the country to transmute metals  perhaps--perhaps to do other mighty works. Count M. seems to have been  afflicted with doubts, to have supposed that by sleight-of-hand the  \"sweet Master\" had substituted the crucible with melted ducats, for the  other--carefully filled with red lead, \"smelted and set to cool,\" \"and  now found broken and hidden among these bushes\"--the whole golden  crucible standing in its place. \"Neither does the Plenagon or Elixir of  Life, or whatever it was, prosper better--our sweet master enters into  expostulation--swears by his great God, and his honor, that he will  finish the work and make us _happy_.\" In vain--\"the shreds of the broken  crucible lie there before your eyes\"--and the usurper has its place.  That \"resemblance of a sleeping child, grown visible in the magic  cooking of our Elixir, proves to be an inserted rosemary leaf. The Grand  Cophta cannot be gone too soon.\"    Already it has been said that \"Charity pays,\" philanthropy, benevolence,  all these--sometimes? if one sows his bread on the waters shall he not  expect its return after many or after few days?--the sooner the better  for your Cagliostros, your Barnums. Shout it daily to an envious  world--\"Am I not a charitable man? If I have done wrong myself (as who  has not?) has not a great deal of good _grown out_ of my wickedness? I  have therefore done my share, for which if the world has paid me in  'praise and pudding,' it is no more than it has done before, and will do  again!\" Take courage!    Cagliostro doctors--heals--the poor, for nothing!--even gives them  alms--does a great deal of good--who but he? At Strasburg in the year  1783 (year of our peace with England), he \"appears in full bloom and  radiance, the envy and admiration of the world. In large hired  hospitals, he with open drug-box (containing 'Extract of Saturn'), and  even with open purse, relieves the suffering poor; unfolds himself  lamblike, angelic, to a believing few, of the rich classes. Medical  miracles have at all times been common, but what miracle is this of an  occidental or oriental Serene-highness that 'regardless of expense,'  employs himself in curing sickness, in illuminating ignorance?\" We at  the present day know nothing like it; the mere giving of a few surplus  hundreds or thousands to certain Slavery, Anti-Slavery, Peace,  Temperance or other societies, is benevolence of the \"rocking chair\"  species--is not to be mentioned with this, of the self-denying  Cagliostro's diving into cellars, and mounting into garrets, to seek and  to save--at the risk of not only life but comfort--the first of which  happily was not thus sacrificed:--nor indeed on the whole was comfort  lost sight of, as the \"coach-and-four with liveries and sumptuosities  bears witness.\" There is often profound wisdom in this thing called  _public_ or newspaper charity. Does it--or does it not--pay?    The favorite of the gods, he who holds high discourse with spirits, and  to whom is opened the hidden secret of earth and heaven, finds ready  acceptance--backed as he is by charities, by elegancies: finds  acceptance with the poor, the ignorant to whom he ministers--but also  \"with a mixture of sorrow and indignation\" it is recorded, among the  great--and not only they, but among the learned, \"even physicians and  naturalists.\" It does not seem worth while to expend sorrow and  indignation upon this fact, not at all new, as we now fifty years  farther along have discovered; for we can show our physicians and  naturalists, and also our priests and prophets, in small crowds with  whom marvels find acceptance. We shall see more of them by and by.    But one among the rich and great, was the Cardinal Prince Count Rohan,  Archbishop of Strasburg. \"Open-handed dupe,\" as some term him--now out  of favor with the Queen Marie Antoinette (after that beheaded and called  unfortunate). Banished from his beloved Paris and the sunshine of  royalty, what should he do but to regain his pedestal? necessary no  doubt, for the glory of God, and his church; necessary at least for the  Count Rohan. Cagliostro is all powerful--he will help the Cardinal  Prince--not only by philters and charms, but by prophecies from the  gods, who speaking through their earthly oracle, will of course (it  paying best), promise success and not failure. The Archbishop tries all  things, and at last the far-famed \"diamond necklace,\" upon the queen,  which no woman's heart can withstand, not even the queen's. Sad to tell,  the miserable queen knew nothing of the necklace; and only the Md'lle De  la Motte, styled countess, by superior arts had outjuggled Cagliostro  himself, Cardinal Rohan, queen and all: the diamonds were gone--the  queen's character blackened, cardinal, cophta, and countess, all in the  Bastille, where they lay some nine months (year 1781), disastrous  months, when \"high science\" wasted itself in eating out its own heart.  Cagliostro escaped, was let go--but a plundered, banished, suspected  high priest, was quite another thing from a golden cophta, with the  foreign coat-of-arms, serene countess--and open purse relieving the  unfortunate.    Cagliostro now flits to England, to Bale, to Brienne, to Aix, to Turin,  he wanders hither and thither; we cannot follow him. The end of all, the  lofty and the low, must come--that seems drawing near to Cagliostro  too--but how? not in ruddy splendor as of departing day, not quiet,  serene, as of nature sinking to rest--rather like the disastrous death  of the bleeding shark it seems: his brethren, his friends--- sharks of  his own kind, of all kinds, high and low--rush upon the wounded shark,  as to a banquet to which they were bidden. He is exiled here, he is  persecuted there--imprisonment, despair, degradation haunt him--the  houseless, unfortunate--now vagabond, once renovator of the human race,  and friend of lords and friend of gods and princes. Such is gratitude!  such is popular favor! a thing to be bought and bargained for, to be  given when _not needed_. Such, no doubt, Cagliostro decided!    He is sore bested, and begins \"to confess himself to priests,\" for a man  must do something in his extremity. It avails him not; he is at last in  the gripe of the holy Inquisition at Rome, \"in the year of our Lord,  1789, December 29,\" and must match himself with a power which this world  knows something of: face to face, hand to hand, at last. Have they  juggles equal to his juggles, miracles equal to his--high science equal  to his--legions of angels equal to his?--enough that they have dungeons,  and sbirri--and in his case, hearts harder than the nether  mill-stone--not to be softened \"by demands for religious  books\"--assertions of the divinity of the Egyptian Masonry--promises of  wonderful revelations--oaths, flatteries, or any of the mystic  paraphernalia of the now powerless professor and prophet: they will not  let him out! but rather will introduce him to a new art, that of  becoming a Christian, and get him, the toughest in a tough time, into  heaven as they best can.
