[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24858"],[0,"The Story of Wool (#12)"],[1," \"Well, well!\" was Mr. Clark's first exclamation. \"How is this? I sent a  pale-faced American boy to the range and I get an Indian in exchange!\"    \"I suppose I am tanned,\" laughed Donald. \"I know my hands are. As for my  face--I have not seen it since I started. We don't have looking-glasses  in the hills.\"    \"And you enjoyed your trip?\"    \"I had the time of my life, father! It is simply bully up there. I wish  you had been along.\"    \"I am planning to go back with you in two or three weeks. It seemed a  pity to bring you down, but I did need you, Don. If it had only been  that I missed you I should not have sent, no matter how much I wanted to  see you.\"    \"I was glad to come, sir. How is everything at Crescent?\"    \"Going well. We are getting in a big crop of alfalfa from the south  meadow. That is why I wanted you. You will now have to turn farmer and  pitch hay for a while.\"    \"All right!\"    And that was what Donald did. For the next few weeks he was busy helping  his father harvest the first crop of alfalfa grass, drying it, and  storing it away in the great sprawling barn of the home ranch for winter  feed. Days of hard work were succeeded by nights of heavy slumber. Life  was very real. The boy was doing something--something that  told--something that was of use to other persons; he had a place to  fill, duties for which he was responsible. Continually he found himself  speaking of \"our ranch\" and suggesting to his father that \"we\" do such  and such things.    Mr. Clark rubbed his hands with satisfaction. Although he and Donald had  always preserved a close comradeship no experience had ever drawn them  so near together as had this common interest. It was happiness to each  of them. From the time the boy tumbled out of bed in the early morning  until he tumbled in again at dusk his whistle could be heard shrill  above the click of mowing-machines, and the tramp of horses' hoofs.    At last came the day when the last load of alfalfa was housed under  cover; then Mr. Clark said to Thornton:    \"Well, Thornton, there seems to be nothing more for which we shall be  needed at present. You can deal out the rations and send them to the  three central camps without me; you can also order necessary supplies  from Glen City. Some repairs remain for you to oversee, but I am sure  you fully understand about them, and can manage them without my help.  To-morrow, therefore, if the day is fine, Donald and I will set out for  the range, I think.\"    Donald threw his hat into the air.    \"To join Sandy, father?\" he asked eagerly.    \"That is my plan.\"    \"Hurrah!\"    Mr. Clark looked amused at his enthusiasm.    \"One would think you a born shepherd, Don, instead of a boy who has only  been out on the range with a herder.\"    \"Why do you call Sandy just a herder, father?\" Donald asked, seeming to  fear that the term was a slight to his friend the Scotchman.    \"Because he is a herder, son. A shepherd is a man who herds or tends his  own sheep--sheep that belong to him; a herder, on the contrary, is a man  hired to care for other people's sheep. There is a great difference, you  see. Generally speaking, a shepherd will take more pains with a flock  than a herder will on the principle that we are more interested in our  own possessions than in those which are not our own.\"    \"No one could take better care of sheep, father, than Sandy does.\"    \"I feel sure of that,\" agreed his father, gravely. \"In fact all our  herders are honest men--I am convinced of it. After the next shearing I  mean to give to each man a small band of sheep for his own. He may run  them with the flocks, sell the wool, and keep the money as a nest-egg.  The men deserve a share in the profits of Crescent Ranch and I should  like them to have it in return for their splendid spirit of loyalty.\"    \"Even Thornton?\"    Mr. Clark hesitated.    \"I have been watching Thornton,\" he admitted slowly. \"That is why I kept  him with me, and why I stayed behind.\"    \"Why, I never thought of that being the reason!\"    \"It was my chief reason.\"    \"But now you are going off and leaving Thornton alone,\" Donald said,  somewhat puzzled.    \"Yes, and I am leaving him in a position of trust, too. The supplies and  much of our business is in his hands. He knows it. If he proves himself  worthy, I shall appoint him, when we leave here, as manager in Johnson's  place; if he abuses the confidence I am placing in him he will force me  to appoint some one else. I wish to be perfectly fair.\"    \"But I do not like Thornton,\" declared Donald.    \"We must never be guided by our prejudices, Don.\"    \"And anyway,\" went on the boy, \"I don't see how you will know what he is  doing. You will be miles away in the hills. He could do almost anything  he chose. Have you left some one to watch him, father?\"    \"No, indeed, son. That would be a mean method; don't you think so? To  set a trap for a man, or to spy upon him would be contemptible!\"    Donald hung his head, ashamed of the suggestion.    \"No,\" continued Mr. Clark less severely, \"I have left no one on guard  over Thornton but himself. I am really trusting him.\"    \"You will never find out what he does, then.\"    \"Yes, I shall.\"    \"I don't see how.\"    \"Thornton himself shall tell me.\"    Donald gasped.    \"He never will tell you, father!\" announced the boy positively.    \"Wait and see. Now let us think no more of Thornton, for it is of Sandy  that we are to talk. He has a great surprise for you.\"    \"A surprise for me!\"    \"Yes.\"    Mr. Clark studied the lad's mystified expression with pleasure.    \"A surprise for me!\" repeated Donald. \"What can it be!\"    \"You will see.\"    \"Aren't you going to tell me?\"    \"No, not a word. It would spoil Sandy's fun.\"    \"A surprise!\" reiterated Donald over and over.    As they rode from the central camp up over the rough trail Don  speculated constantly as to what could be in store for him. It seemed a  long journey for he was impatient to solve the waiting enigma. What  surprise could Sandy have concocted? At the border of the Reserve they  met the ranger who chanced to be patrolling that portion of the  government line. He remembered Donald very well and greeted him kindly;  he also had a cordial word for Mr. Clark. Donald, however, begrudged  even this brief delay and was glad when they plunged into the woods and  were on their way through the National Forest.    Pete, the Mexican camp-tender who had come with them as guide, knew the  country as an American boy knows his A B C's. He hunted out sheltered  nooks where they could camp at night, taking great care to build the  fire on a rocky base that it might not set ablaze the brush and litter  of pine-needles about them.    \"Many a careless shepherd sets a forest fire through being thoughtless,\"  he said. \"Acres of timber will be burned off a hillside by one person  who did not put out his fire, or scattered sparks in the dried  underbrush. Old Angus trained us Crescent men always to build our fires  on a flat rock if we could; then there is no danger of our doing damage  in the reserve or elsewhere.\"    \"It is a wise plan,\" Mr. Clark said heartily. \"I wish all herders were  as careful.\"    So they journeyed on--now in the sunlight of the plateaus, now in the  shadows of the forest. Then one morning they suddenly emerged into an  emerald meadow glowing with sunshine. There a beautiful sight met  Donald's eye.    Spread out like a fan the herd was grazing on the rich herbage of the  mountain pasture, their backs to the brilliant light as was their wont.  But of these details Donald was not conscious. What held him spellbound  was the miracle that had happened in his absence. Now he knew the  surprise that Sandy had for him! Beside every ewe in the flock stood a  tiny white lamb!    [Illustration]          CHAPTER IX    A SECOND ADVENTURE      Donald's delight at being back on the range was equaled only by Sandy's  pleasure at having him there. The first thing, of course, was to display  the lambs to the boy and Mr. Clark.    With no little pride the Scotchman led the newcomers over the pasture,  pointing out the finest blooded creatures in the flock.    \"One would think, Sandy, that you were a mother hen with a brood of  chicks!\" laughed Donald's father. \"Well, you have a right to be pleased  with your herd. You have a fine lot of lambs.\"    \"They are no so handsome just now, sir,\" Sandy chuckled. \"But give them  time! A few weeks more, and a winsome sight they'll be.\"    \"Are--are--lambs always so long-legged?\" queried Donald timidly, anxious  not to hurt Sandy's feelings. \"These seem to have no bodies at all--just  legs.\"    \"That is their nature, lad. They have only enough body to keep their  legs alive. Young lambs are ever like that. Later they fill out. It is  their strong legs that enable them to travel with the flock as soon as  they are three or four weeks old. But I am proud of them--legs or no  legs. Now that they are here, our next task is to bring them through  alive. We have lost but a few thus far. Luckily we had several sets of  twins, so we have been able to give a lamb to every mother sheep that  lost her baby. We fasten the strange lamb inside the skin of the dead  one, and the mother is as well pleased as if she had her own back  again.\"    \"What a funny idea!\" Donald said.    \"Yes, isn't it? You see sheep recognize their young merely by scent. The  power of smell is remarkably keen in all sheep. They can tell their  babies no other way. We do not want any of the ewes grieving because  they have no lamb--they do grieve, poor things--so we have to fool them  a little. It is a fair thing to do because the ewes with twins do not  need two. They are just as happy with one,\" explained Sandy.    \"And now you will have a big, big flock to take care of, won't you,  Sandy?\"    \"Aye! There is much more to do now. I am glad you have come back, Don,  for I can put you to work.\"    \"You must put me to work also, Sandy,\" Mr. Clark "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24869"],[0,"The Rámáyan of Válmíki, translated into English verse (#12)"],[1,"spouse,  Devoted to thy husband's vows.  And O dear Santa, ne'er neglect  To pay the dues of meek respect  To the great saint, thy husband's sire,  With all observance and with fire.  And, sweet one, pure of spot and blame,  Forget not thou thy husband's claim;  In every change, in good and ill,  Let thy sweet words delight him still,  And let thy worship constant be:  Her lord is woman's deity.  To learn thy welfare, dearest friend,  The king will many a Brahman send.  Let happy thoughts thy spirit cheer,  And be not troubled, daughter dear.\"      These soothing words the ladies said.  And pressed their lips upon her head.  Each gave with sighs her last adieu,  Then at the king's command withdrew.  The king around the hermit went  With circling footsteps reverent,  And placed at Rishyasring's command  Some soldiers of his royal band.  The Brahman bowed in turn and cried,  \"May fortune never leave thy side.  O mighty King, with justice reign,  And still thy people's love retain.\"  He spoke, and turned away his face,    And, as the hermit went,  The monarch, rooted to the place,    Pursued with eyes intent.  But when the sage had past from view  King Dasaratha turned him too,  Still fixing on his friend each thought.  With such deep love his breast was fraught.  Amid his people's loud acclaim  Home to his royal seat he came,    And lived delighted there,  Expecting when each queenly dame,  Upholder of his ancient fame,    Her promised son should bear.  The glorious sage his way pursued  Till close before his eyes he viewed  Sweet Champa, Lomapad's fair town,  Wreathed with her Champacs'(126) leafy crown.  Soon as the saint's approach he knew,  The king, to yield him honour due,  Went forth to meet him with a band  Of priests and nobles of the land:  \"Hail, Sage,\" he cried, \"O joy to me!  What bliss it is, my lord, to see  Thee with thy wife and all thy train  Returning to my town again.  Thy father, honoured Sage, is well,  Who hither from his woodland cell  Has sent full many a messenger  For tidings both of thee and her.\"  Then joyfully, for due respect,  The monarch bade the town be decked.  The king and Rishyasring elate  Entered the royal city's gate:    In front the chaplain rode.  Then, loved and honoured with all care  By monarch and by courtier, there    The glorious saint abode.          Canto XVIII. Rishyasring's Departure.      The monarch called a Brahman near    And said, \"Now speed away  To Kasyap's son,(127) the mighty seer,    And with all reverence say  The holy child he holds so dear,  The hermit of the noble mind,  Whose equal it were hard to find,    Returned, is dwelling here.  Go, and instead of me do thou  Before that best of hermits bow,  That still he may, for his dear son,  Show me the favour I have won.\"  Soon as the king these words had said,  To Kasyap's son the Brahman sped.  Before the hermit low he bent  And did obeisance, reverent;  Then with meek words his grace to crave  The message of his lord he gave:  \"The high-souled father of his bride  Had called thy son his rites to guide:  Those rites are o'er, the steed is slain;  Thy noble child is come again.\"      Soon as the saint that speech had heard  His spirit with desire was stirred  To seek the city of the king  And to his cot his son to bring.  With young disciples at his side  Forth on his way the hermit hied,  While peasants from their hamlets ran  To reverence the holy man.  Each with his little gift of food,  Forth came the village multitude,  And, as they humbly bowed the head,  \"What may we do for thee?\" they said.  Then he, of Brahmans first and best,  The gathered people thus addressed:  \"Now tell me for I fain would know,  Why is it I am honoured so?\"  They to the high-souled saint replied:  \"Our ruler is with thee allied.  Our master's order we fulfil;  O Brahman, let thy mind be still.\"      With joy the saintly hermit heard  Each pleasant and delightful word,  And poured a benediction down  On king and ministers and town.  Glad at the words of that high saint  Some servants hastened to acquaint  Their king, rejoicing to impart  The tidings that would cheer his heart.  Soon as the joyful tale he knew  To meet the saint the monarch flew,  The guest-gift in his hand he brought,  And bowed before him and besought:  \"This day by seeing thee I gain  Not to have lived my life in vain,  Now be not wroth with me, I pray,  \"Because I wiled thy son away.(128)      The best of Brahmans answer made:  \"Be not, great lord of kings, afraid.  Thy virtues have not failed to win  My favour, O thou pure of sin.\"  Then in the front the saint was placed,  The king came next in joyous haste,  And with him entered his abode,  Mid glad acclaim as on they rode.  To greet the sage the reverent crowd  Raised suppliant hands and humbly bowed.  Then from the palace many a dame  Following well-dressed Santa came,  Stood by the mighty saint and cried:  \"See, honour's source, thy son's dear bride.\"  The saint, who every virtue knew,  His arms around his daughter threw,  And with a father's rapture pressed  The lady to his wondering breast.  Arising from the saint's embrace  She bowed her low before his face,  And then, with palm to palm applied,  Stood by her hermit father's side.  He for his son, as laws ordain,  Performed the rite that frees from stain,(129)  And, honoured by the wise and good,  With him departed to the wood.          Canto XIX. The Birth Of The Princes.      The seasons six in rapid flight  Had circled since that glorious rite.  Eleven months had passed away;  'Twas Chaitra's ninth returning day.(130)  The moon within that mansion shone  Which Aditi looks kindly on.  Raised to their apex in the sky  Five brilliant planets beamed on high.  Shone with the moon, in Cancer's sign,  Vrihaspati(131) with light divine.  Kausalya bore an infant blest  With heavenly marks of grace impressed;  Rama, the universe's lord,  A prince by all the worlds adored.  New glory Queen Kausalya won  Reflected from her splendid son.  So Aditi shone more and more,  The Mother of the Gods, when she  The King of the Immortals(132) bore,  The thunder-wielding deity.  The lotus-eyed, the beauteous boy,  He came fierce Ravan to destroy;  From half of Vishnu's vigour born,  He came to help the worlds forlorn.  And Queen Kaikeyi bore a child  Of truest valour, Bharat styled,  With every princely virtue blest,  One fourth of Vishnu manifest.  Sumitra too a noble pair,  Called Lakshman and Satrughna, bare,  Of high emprise, devoted, true,  Sharers in Vishnu's essence too.  'Neath Pushya's(133) mansion, Mina's(134) sign,  Was Bharat born, of soul benign.  The sun had reached the Crab at morn  When Queen Sumitra's babes were born,  What time the moon had gone to make  His nightly dwelling with the Snake.  The high-souled monarch's consorts bore  At different times those glorious four,  Like to himself and virtuous, bright  As Proshthapada's(135) four-fold light.  Then danced the nymphs' celestial throng,    The minstrels raised their strain;  The drums of heaven pealed loud and long,    And flowers came down in rain.  Within Ayodhya, blithe and gay,  All kept the joyous holiday.  The spacious square, the ample road  With mimes and dancers overflowed,  And with the voice of music rang  Where minstrels played and singers sang,  And shone, a wonder to behold,  With dazzling show of gems and gold.  Nor did the king his largess spare,  For minstrel, driver, bard, to share;  Much wealth the Brahmans bore away,  And many thousand dine that day.      Soon as each babe was twelve days old  'Twas time the naming rite to hold.  When Saint Vasishtha, rapt with joy,  Assigned a name to every boy.  Rama, to him the high-souled heir,  Bharat, to him Kaikeyi bare:  Of Queen Sumitra one fair son  Was Lakshman, and Satrughna(136) one  Rama, his sire's supreme delight,  Like some proud banner cheered his sight,  And to all creatures seemed to be  The self-existent deity.  All heroes, versed in holy lore,  To all mankind great love they bore.  Fair stores of wisdom all possessed,  With princely graces all were blest.  But mid those youths of high descent,  With lordly light preeminent.  Like the full moon unclouded, shone  Rama, the world's dear paragon.  He best the elephant could guide.(137)  Urge the fleet car, the charger ride:  A master he of bowman's skill,  Joying to do his father's will.  The world's delight and darling, he  Loved Lakshman best from infancy  And Lakshman, lord of lofty fate,  Upon his elder joyed to wait,  Striving his second self to please  With friendship's sweet observances.  His limbs the hero ne'er would rest  Unless the couch his brother pressed;  Except beloved Rama shared  He could not taste the meal prepared.  When Rama, pride of Reghu's race,  Sprang on his steed to urge the chase,  Behind him Lakshman loved to go  And guard him with his trusty bow.  As Rama was to Lakshman dear  More than his life and ever near,  So fond Satrughna prized above  His very life his Bharat's love.  Illustrious heroes, nobly kind  In mutual love they all combined,  And gave their royal sire delight  With modest grace and warrior might:  Supported by the glorious four  Shone Dasaratha more and more,    As though, with every guardian God      Who keeps the land and skies,    The Father of all creatures trod      The earth before men's eyes.          Canto XX. Visvamitra's Visit.      Now Dasaratha's pious mind  Meet wedlock for his sons designed;  With priests and friends the king began  To counsel and prepare his plan.  Such thoughts engaged his bosom, when,  To see Ayodhya's lord of men,  A mighty saint of glorious fame,  The hermit Visvamitra(138) came.  For evil fiends that roam by night  Disturbed him in each holy rite,  And in their strength and frantic rage  Assailed with witcheries the sage.  He came to seek the monarch's aid  To guard the rites the demons stayed,  Unable to a close to bring  One unpolluted offering.  Seeking the king in this dire"]]]
