The Governor also refused to let the  Assembly see the instructions from the proprietors under which he  was acting. This was another attack upon their liberties and involved  nothing less than an attempt to change their charter rights by secret  instructions to a deputy governor which he must obey at his peril.  Several bills had recently been introduced in the English Parliament for  the purpose of making royal instructions to governors binding on all the  colonial assemblies without regard to their charters. This innovation,  the colonists felt, would wreck all their liberties and turn colonial  government into a mere despotism.    The assemblies of all the colonies have been a good deal abused for  delay in supporting the war and meanness in withholding money. But  in many instances the delay and lack of money were occasioned by the  grasping schemes of governors who saw a chance to gain new privileges  for the Crown or a proprietor or to weaken popular government by  crippling the powers of the legislatures. The usual statement that  the Pennsylvania Assembly was slow in assisting the war because it was  composed of Quakers is not supported by the facts. The Pennsylvania  Assembly was not behind the rest. On this particular occasion, when  their large money supply bill could not be passed without sacrificing  their constitutional rights, they raised money for the war by appointing  a committee which was authorized to borrow 5000 pounds on the credit of  the Assembly.    Other contests arose over the claim of the proprietors that their  estates in the province were exempt from taxation for the war or any  purpose. One bill taxing the proprietary estates along with others was  met by Thomas Penn offering to subscribe 5000 pounds, as a free gift to  the colony's war measures. The Assembly accepted this, and passed the  bill without taxing the proprietary estates. It turned out, however,  to be a shrewd business move on the part of Thomas Penn; for the 5000  pounds was to be collected out of the quitrents that were in arrears,  and the payment of it was in consequence long delayed. The thrifty  Thomas had thus saddled his bad debts on the province and gained a  reputation for generosity at the same time.    Pennsylvania, though governed by Quakers assisted by noncombatant  Germans, had a better protected frontier than Maryland or Virginia; no  colony, indeed, was at that time better protected. The Quaker Assembly  did more than take care of the frontier during the war; it preserved  at the same time constitutional rights in defense of which twenty-five  years afterwards the whole continent fought the Revolution. The Quaker  Assembly even passed two militia bills, one of which became law, and  sent rather more than the province's full share of troops to protect  the frontiers of New York and New England and to carry the invasion into  Canada.    General Braddock warmly praised the assistance which Pennsylvania gave  him because, he said, she had done more for him than any of the other  colonies. Virginia and Maryland promised everything and performed  nothing, while Pennsylvania promised nothing and performed everything.  Commodore Spy thanked the Assembly for the large number of sailors sent  his fleet at the expense of the province. General Shirley, in charge  of the New England and New York campaigns, thanked the Assembly for  the numerous recruits; and it was the common opinion at the time that  Pennsylvania had sent more troops to the war than any other colony. In  the first four years of the war the province spent for military purposes  210,567 pounds sterling, which was a very considerable sum at that time  for a community of less than 200,000 people. Quakers, though they hate  war, will accept it when there is no escape. The old story of the Quaker  who tossed a pirate overboard, saying, \"Friend, thee has no business  here,\" gives their point of view better than pages of explanation.  Quaker opinion has not always been entirely uniform. In Revolutionary  times in Philadelphia there was a division of the Quakers known as the  Fighting Quakers, and their meeting house is still pointed out at the  corner of Fourth Street and Arch. They even produced able military  leaders: Colonel John Dickinson, General Greene, and General Mifflin in  the Continental Army, and, in the War of 1812, General Jacob Brown,  who reorganized the army and restored its failing fortunes after many  officers had been tried and found wanting.    There was always among the Quakers a rationalistic party and a party of  mysticism. The rationalistic party prevailed in Pennsylvania all through  the colonial period. In the midst of the worst horrors of the French and  Indian wars, however, the conscientious objectors roused themselves and  began preaching and exhorting what has been called the mystical side of  the faith. Many extreme Quaker members of the Assembly resigned their  seats in consequence. After the Revolution the spiritual party began  gaining ground, partly perhaps because then the responsibilities of  government and care of the great political and religious experiment in  Pennsylvania were removed. The spiritual party increased so rapidly  in power that in 1827 a split occurred which involved not a little  bitterness, ill feeling, and litigation over property. This division  into two opposing camps, known as the Hicksites and the Orthodox,  continues and is likely to remain.    Quaker government in Pennsylvania was put to still severer tests by  the difficulties and disasters that followed Braddock's defeat. That  unfortunate general had something over two thousand men and was hampered  with a train of artillery and a splendid equipment of arms, tools, and  supplies, as if he were to march over the smooth highways of Europe.  When he came to drag all these munitions through the depths of the  Pennsylvania forests and up and down the mountains, he found that he  made only about three miles a day and that his horses had nothing to eat  but the leaves of the trees. Washington, who was of the party, finally  persuaded him to abandon his artillery and press forward with about  fifteen hundred picked men. These troops, when a few miles from Fort  Duquesne (now Pittsburgh), met about six hundred Indians and three  hundred French coming from the fort. The English maintained a close  formation where they were, but the French and Indians immediately spread  out on their flanks, lying behind trees and logs which provided rests  for their rifles and security for their bodies. This strategy decided  the day. The English were shot down like cattle in a pen, and out of  about fifteen hundred only four hundred and fifty escaped. The French  and Indian loss was not much over fifty.    This defeat of Braddock's force has become one of the most famous  reverses in history; and it was made worse by the conduct of Dunbar who  had been left in command of the artillery, baggage, and men in the rear.  He could have remained where he was as some sort of protection to the  frontier. But he took fright, burned his wagons, emptied his barrels of  powder into the streams, destroyed his provisions, and fled back to Fort  Cumberland in Maryland. Here the governors of Pennsylvania and Virginia  as well as the Pennsylvania Assembly urged him to stay. But, determined  to make the British rout complete, he soon retreated to the peace and  quiet of Philadelphia, and nothing would induce him to enter again the  terrible forests of Pennsylvania.    The natural result of the blunder soon followed. The French, finding  the whole frontier of Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Virginia abandoned,  organized the Indians under French officers and swept the whole region  with a devastation of massacre, scalping, and burning that has never  been equaled. Hurons, Potawatomies, Ojibways, Ottawas, Mingoes,  renegades from the Six Nations, together with the old treaty friends of  Penn, the Delawares and Shawanoes, began swarming eastward and soon  had killed more people than had been lost at Braddock's defeat. The  onslaught reached its height in September and October. By that time all  the outlying frontier settlers and their families had been killed or  sent flying eastward to seek refuge in the settlements. The Indians even  followed them to the settlements, reached the Susquehanna, and crossed  it. They massacred the people of the village of Gnadenhutten, near  Bethlehem on the Lehigh, and established near by a headquarters for  prisoners and plunder. Families were scalped within fifty miles of  Philadelphia, and in one instance the bodies of a murdered family  were brought into the town and exhibited in the streets to show the  inhabitants how near the danger was approaching. Nothing could be done  to stem the savage tide. Virginia was suffering in the same way: the  settlers on her border were slaughtered or were driven back in herds  upon the more settled districts, and Washington, with a nominal strength  of fifteen hundred who would not obey orders, was forced to stand  a helpless spectator of the general flight and misery. There was no  adequate force or army anywhere within reach. The British had been  put to flight and had gone to the defense of New England and New York.  Neither Pennsylvania nor Virginia had a militia that could withstand  the French and their red allies. They could only wait till the panic had  subsided and then see what could be done.    One thing was accomplished, however, when the Pennsylvania Assembly  passed a Quaker militia law which is one of the most curious legal  documents of its kind in history. It was most aptly worded, drafted by  the master hand of Franklin. It recited the fact that the province had  always been ruled by Quakers who were opposed to war, but that now it  had become necessary to allow men to become soldiers and to give them  every facility for the profession of arms, because the Assembly though"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3050"],[0,"Notes of a War Correspondent (#12)"],[1,"treat, as  the trail for two miles behind them was wedged with men.  They could not  remain where they were, for they were being shot to pieces.  There was  only one thing they could do--go forward and take the San Juan hills by  assault.  It was as desperate as the situation itself.  To charge  earthworks held by men with modern rifles, and using modern artillery,  until after the earthworks have been shaken by artillery, and to attack  them in advance and not in the flanks, are both impossible military  propositions.  But this campaign had not been conducted according to  military rules, and a series of military blunders had brought seven  thousand American soldiers into a chute of death from which there was no  escape except by taking the enemy who held it by the throat and driving  him out and beating him down.  So the generals of divisions and brigades  stepped back and relinquished their command to the regimental officers  and the enlisted men.    \"We can do nothing more,\" they virtually said.  \"There is the enemy.\"    Colonel Roosevelt, on horseback, broke from the woods behind the line of  the Ninth, and finding its men lying in his way, shouted: \"If you don't  wish to go forward, let my men pass.\"  The junior officers of the Ninth,  with their negroes, instantly sprang into line with the Rough Riders, and  charged at the blue block-house on the right.    I speak of Roosevelt first because, with General Hawkins, who led Kent's  division, notably the Sixth and Sixteenth Regulars, he was, without  doubt, the most conspicuous figure in the charge.  General Hawkins, with  hair as white as snow, and yet far in advance of men thirty years his  junior, was so noble a sight that you felt inclined to pray for his  safety; on the other hand, Roosevelt, mounted high on horseback, and  charging the rifle-pits at a gallop and quite alone, made you feel that  you would like to cheer.  He wore on his sombrero a blue polka-dot  handkerchief, a la Havelock, which, as he advanced, floated out straight  behind his head, like a guidon.  Afterward, the men of his regiment who  followed this flag, adopted a polka-dot handkerchief as the badge of the  Rough Riders.  These two officers were notably conspicuous in the charge,  but no one can claim that any two men, or any one man, was more brave or  more daring, or showed greater courage in that slow, stubborn advance,  than did any of the others.  Some one asked one of the officers if he had  any difficulty in making his men follow him.  \"No,\" he answered, \"I had  some difficulty in keeping up with them.\"  As one of the brigade generals  said: \"San Juan was won by the regimental officers and men.  We had as  little to do as the referee at a prize-fight who calls 'time.'  We called  'time' and they did the fighting.\"    I have seen many illustrations and pictures of this charge on the San  Juan hills, but none of them seem to show it just as I remember it.  In  the picture-papers the men are running uphill swiftly and gallantly, in  regular formation, rank after rank, with flags flying, their eyes aflame,  and their hair streaming, their bayonets fixed, in long, brilliant lines,  an invincible, overpowering weight of numbers.  Instead of which I think  the thing which impressed one the most, when our men started from cover,  was that they were so few.  It seemed as if some one had made an awful  and terrible mistake.  One's instinct was to call to them to come back.  You felt that some one had blundered and that these few men were blindly  following out some madman's mad order.  It was not heroic then, it seemed  merely absurdly pathetic.  The pity of it, the folly of such a sacrifice  was what held you.    They had no glittering bayonets, they were not massed in regular array.  There were a few men in advance, bunched together, and creeping up a  steep, sunny hill, the tops of which roared and flashed with flame.  The  men held their guns pressed across their chests and stepped heavily as  they climbed.  Behind these first few, spreading out like a fan, were  single lines of men, slipping and scrambling in the smooth grass, moving  forward with difficulty, as though they were wading waist high through  water, moving slowly, carefully, with strenuous effort.  It was much more  wonderful than any swinging charge could have been.  They walked to greet  death at every step, many of them, as they advanced, sinking suddenly or  pitching forward and disappearing in the high grass, but the others waded  on, stubbornly, forming a thin blue line that kept creeping higher and  higher up the hill.  It was as inevitable as the rising tide.  It was a  miracle of self-sacrifice, a triumph of bull-dog courage, which one  watched breathless with wonder.  The fire of the Spanish riflemen, who  still stuck bravely to their posts, doubled and trebled in fierceness,  the crests of the hills crackled and burst in amazed roars, and rippled  with waves of tiny flame.  But the blue line crept steadily up and on,  and then, near the top, the broken fragments gathered together with a  sudden burst of speed, the Spaniards appeared for a moment outlined  against the sky and poised for instant flight, fired a last volley, and  fled before the swift-moving wave that leaped and sprang after them.    The men of the Ninth and the Rough Riders rushed to the block-house  together, the men of the Sixth, of the Third, of the Tenth Cavalry, of  the Sixth and Sixteenth Infantry, fell on their faces along the crest of  the hills beyond, and opened upon the vanishing enemy.  They drove the  yellow silk flags of the cavalry and the flag of their country into the  soft earth of the trenches, and then sank down and looked back at the  road they had climbed and swung their hats in the air.  And from far  overhead, from these few figures perched on the Spanish rifle-pits, with  their flags planted among the empty cartridges of the enemy, and  overlooking the walls of Santiago, came, faintly, the sound of a tired,  broken cheer.        III--THE TAKING OF COAMO      This is the inside story of the surrender, during the Spanish War, of the  town of Coamo.  It is written by the man to whom the town surrendered.  Immediately after the surrender this same man became Military Governor of  Coamo.  He held office for fully twenty minutes.    Before beginning this story the reader must forget all he may happen to  know of this particular triumph of the Porto Rican Expedition.  He must  forget that the taking of Coamo has always been credited to Major-General  James H. Wilson, who on that occasion commanded Captain Anderson's  Battery, the Sixteenth Pennsylvania, Troop C of Brooklyn, and under  General Ernst, the Second and Third Wisconsin Volunteers.  He must forget  that in the records of the War Department all the praise, and it is of  the highest, for this victory is bestowed upon General Wilson and his  four thousand soldiers.  Even the writer of this, when he cabled an  account of the event to his paper, gave, with every one else, the entire  credit to General Wilson.  And ever since his conscience has upbraided  him.  His only claim for tolerance as a war correspondent has been that  he always has stuck to the facts, and now he feels that in the sacred  cause of history his friendship and admiration for General Wilson, that  veteran of the Civil, Philippine, and Chinese Wars, must no longer stand  in the way of his duty as an accurate reporter.  He no longer can tell a  lie.  He must at last own up that he himself captured Coamo.     [Picture: Officers watching the artillery play on Coamo.  Drawn by F. C.                    Yohn from a photograph by the Author]    On the morning of the 9th of August, 1898, the Sixteenth Pennsylvania  Volunteers arrived on the outskirts of that town.  In order to get there  they had spent the night in crawling over mountain trails and scrambling  through streams and ravines.  It was General Wilson's plan that by this  flanking night march the Sixteenth Pennsylvania would reach the road  leading from Coamo to San Juan in time to cut off the retreat of the  Spanish garrison, when General Wilson, with the main body, attacked it  from the opposite side.    At seven o'clock in the morning General Wilson began the frontal attack  by turning loose the artillery on a block-house, which threatened his  approach, and by advancing the Wisconsin Volunteers.  The cavalry he sent  to the right to capture Los Banos.  At eight o'clock, from where the main  body rested, two miles from Coamo, we could hear the Sixteenth  Pennsylvania open its attack and instantly become hotly engaged.  The  enemy returned the fire fiercely, and the firing from both sides at once  became so severe that it was evident the Pennsylvania Volunteers either  would take the town without the main body, or that they would greatly  need its assistance.  The artillery was accordingly advanced one thousand  yards and the infantry was hurried forward.  The Second Wisconsin  approached Coamo along the main road from Ponce, the Third Wisconsin  through fields of grass to the right of the road, until the two regiments  met at the ford by which the Banos road crosses the Coamo River.  But  before they met, from a position near the artillery, I had watched  through my glasses the Second Wisconsin with General Ernst at its head  advancing along the main road, and as, when I saw them, they were near  the river, I guessed they would continue across the bridge and that they  soon would be in the town.    As the firing from the Sixteenth still continued, it seemed obvious that  General Ernst would be the first general officer to enter Coamo, and to  receive its surrender.  I had never seen five thousand people surrender  to one man, and it seemed that, if I were to witness that ceremony, my  best plan was to abandon the artillery and, as quickly as possible,  pursue the Second Wisconsin.  I did not want to share the spectacle of  the surrender with"]]]
