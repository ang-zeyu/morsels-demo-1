After a short interval of quiet,  the flames of war were rekindled by the curses hurled by one young  woman at another on the beach at Kororareka. A sharp battle was fought  between the relatives and partisans of the two damsels, in which many  lives were lost. At this juncture, Marsden arrived suddenly in the Bay.  Together with Henry Williams he visited the hostile camps, and after  some days of discussion peace was made. But the \"Girls' War\" did not end  here. Two of the Ngapuhi chiefs, not being able to obtain vengeance for  their slaughtered father among those who had slain him, went far away  from their own territory and raided the islands in the Bay of Plenty.  This involved the whole tribe in a war with the people of Tauranga, a  war which dragged on for two whole years. Henry Williams and his  brethren accompanied the fleets in their boat, and used their influence  to stop the war. Partly through his exhortations, and partly through the  absence of Hongi's determined generalship, the Ngapuhi fought  half-heartedly and with little success. \"The words of Wiremu,\" they  confessed, \"lay heavy on us, and our guns would not shoot.\" The stage  had arrived which is depicted in the legend quoted at the head of this  chapter. Like the Irish warrior, the New Zealanders were ready to say:      O weary was I of the travel, the trouble, the strife, and the sin.    The deadly feuds of the last thirteen years had greatly reduced the  population, and the Maoris were bound to admit that the new religion  offered a more excellent way.    This consummation, though highly desirable in itself, was of course  regarded by the missionaries only as a means to a further end--the  thorough conversion of the people to the Christian faith. Such  conversions were rare, but they were just frequent enough to give  encouragement. At first it was only the old and the sick who were drawn  by the announcement of a heaven where bloodshed and turmoil should  cease. Of these the case of the old man, Rangi, is notable through his  being the first of his race to be received into the Church of Christ by  baptism (1825). A much more striking conversion was that of Taiwhanga,  one of Hongi's chief warriors, in 1829. His struggles against the  fascinations of the old life were severe and prolonged. Frequently he  was solicited to go with a party on the warpath, and even his musket was  coveted as a weapon endowed with more than ordinary power. At last he  resolved that his children should be baptised, and the letter which he  wrote to the missionaries on this occasion is of uncommon interest:  \"Here am I thinking of the day when my son shall be baptised. You are  messengers from God, therefore I wish that he should be baptised  according to your customs. I have left off my native rites and my native  thoughts, and am now thinking how I may untie the cords of the devil,  and so loosen them that they may fall off together with all sin. Christ  is near, perhaps beholding my sinfulness; he looks into the hearts of  men. It is well for me to grieve in the morning, in the evening, and at  night, that my sins may be blotted out.\"    The baptism of Taiwhanga's children (August 23) was naturally looked  upon as a significant event. William Williams spent part of the previous  day in translating the baptismal service, and he determined to baptise  at the same time his own infant son, Leonard Williams, afterwards to  become Bishop of Waiapu. Six months later, Taiwhanga himself came  forward publicly for baptism, and received the appropriate name of  David. He immediately became an active missionary among his own  countrymen, and proved an invaluable help to his teachers.    In spite of these and other gleams of success, the mission seemed to its  friends to be doing little during these years, inasmuch as it made no  extension beyond the limits of the Bay of Islands. The regret was shared  by the leaders on the spot, and it has already been shown how Williams  made more than one attempt by sea to effect an opening in the Bay of  Plenty. It must be remembered, however, that the country to the  southward of the northern isthmus had been desolated by Hongi's wars,  and that the few remaining inhabitants were naturally hostile to  anything that seemed to come from the Ngapuhi. Concentration was forced  upon the mission by the circumstances of the time. When once the schools  were established, they required the whole of the available staff of  teachers to conduct them efficiently. To have weakened the schools would  have been bad policy, even if openings had presented themselves  elsewhere.    [Illustration: HENRY WILLIAMS AT THE SIGNING OF THE TREATY AT WAITANGI.]    But, as a matter of fact, the missionaries \"builded better than they  knew.\" The really important feature of their work was little guessed  even by themselves. Among their classes at Paihia were many wistful  faces of slaves who had been torn from their distant homes in Hongi's  wars. These had been befriended by the missionaries, and were placed on  an equal footing in the schools with the sons of chiefs and rangatiras.  It was these who drank in most deeply the Christian teaching, and it was  these who were destined to be the pioneers of the future.    Outwardly the most striking achievements of these schools were the  annual examinations which took place at the close of the years 1828 to  1830. Twice the scholars from Paihia and Rangihoua were taken by boat to  Kerikeri, where the proceedings lasted for two or three days, and always  finished with a generous feast. The gathering of 1830 took place at  Paihia, and included 178 men and boys, besides 92 girls. It is not often  that a school examination acquires a political significance, but it was  so in this case. There were more than 1,000 Maori spectators  present--men who had fought on opposite sides in the recent battle of  Kororareka. The orderliness of the proceedings, and the delightful  atmosphere of keenness and pleasure which pervaded the scene, drew all  parties together and served to weld the bond of peace.    Such exhibitions of the working of the new faith, together with the  adhesion of a powerful convert like Taiwhanga, were bound to tell upon  the people around. Evidences began to multiply of a serious attention to  the teaching of the missionaries. Here and there in unexpected quarters  signs appeared of coming change. To use the picturesque native simile,  \"the fire was spreading in the fern.\"          CHAPTER V.    THE FORWARD MOVE.    (1831-1837).      Speak unto the children of Israel, that they go forward.      --_Exod._      Unlike their brethren in Africa and some other parts of the world, the  New Zealand missionaries did not attempt much in the way of exploration.  Marsden discovered the Manukau Harbour in 1820; Kendall and King were  the first white men to visit Hokianga; Henry Williams' little _Herald_  was the first European vessel since Captain Cook's _Endeavour_ to enter  the Bay of Plenty. Greater expeditions were prevented by a variety of  obstacles. The missionaries were \"settlers,\" and a settler is tied to  his home duties. The land route from the Bay of Islands southwards had  been devastated by Hongi. The clerical missionaries were few in number,  and the schools absorbed all their energies. Hence it was that even as  late as 1833--eighteen years after Marsden's first landing--their  knowledge of the country was but slight. The map which Yate put forth at  this time shows very little advance on that of Captain Cook. The  interior of the island is almost wholly blank.    But the hour had now struck for a forward movement. New lay workers  arrived from England--Wilson and Morgan in 1833, Colenso and others in  the year following. The termination of the \"Girls' War\" had at last  brought peace between the Ngapuhi and their neighbours; the inland  tribes were beginning to creep out of their fastnesses and to re-occupy  their ravaged lands.    Very cautiously and tentatively was the advance begun. Instead of a move  to the southward, the Committee decided in the first place to try the  north. At the end of 1832, Mr. William Williams with a large party of  catechists and Maoris made their way for 80 miles over wooded mountains  from Waimate to Kaitaia. The people at this place were so eager for a  missionary that the resolution was soon taken to plant a station among  them. It was long, however, before an actual settlement was made. In the  following year some ground was bought, and a more direct road explored  across the mountains. Even then there was hesitation. A fourth  expedition was sent \"to ascertain the true state of the minds of the  natives with regard to our settling among them.\" The answer was brief  and satisfactory: \"Make haste and take up your abode among us.\" Thus  encouraged, Puckey and Matthews made a temporary stay, and at last,  after some months, brought up their wives and their belongings.    The site of the new station was a beautiful one. It lay amidst rivers  and hills, and its position was such that the roar of the surf on both  eastern and western coasts of the island could be distinctly heard.  Shortly after his permanent settlement, Mr. Puckey made a journey to the  extreme north of the island and reached Cape Reinga. Standing on the  black cliffs against which the sea was dashing with terrific force,  listening to the scream of the sea-fowl and the weird noise produced by  the waves in a hollow cave, the white man could easily understand how  this dread place came to be regarded by the Maoris as the gateway into  the unseen world. The masses of kelp which swung to and fro in the waves  were believed to be the door through which the spirits passed to  Hawaiki, or to some idealised counterpart thereof, and a projecting  tree-root halfway down the cliff was highly venerated as the ladder  which assisted them in their descent."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31425"],[0,"Report of the Decision of the Supreme Court of the United States, and the (#12)"],[1,"lands in North  Carolina and Georgia, which had not then been ceded, but the cession  of which was confidently anticipated upon some terms that would be  arranged between the General Government and these two States. And,  moreover, there were many articles of value besides this property in  land, such as arms, military stores, munitions, and ships of war,  which were the common property of the States, when acting in their  independent characters as confederates, which neither the new  Government nor any one else would have a right to take possession of,  or control, without authority from them; and it was to place these  things under the guardianship and protection of the new Government,  and to clothe it with the necessary powers, that the clause was  inserted in the Constitution which gives Congress the power \"to  dispose of and make all needful rules and regulations respecting the  territory or other property belonging to the United States.\" It was  intended for a specific purpose, to provide for the things we have  mentioned. It was to transfer to the new Government the property then  held in common by the States, and to give to that Government power to  apply it to the objects for which it had been destined by mutual  agreement among the States before their league was dissolved. It  applied only to the property which the States held in common at that  time, and has no reference whatever to any territory or other property  which the new sovereignty might afterwards itself acquire.    The language used in the clause, the arrangement and combination of  the powers, and the somewhat unusual phraseology it uses, when it  speaks of the political power to be exercised in the government of the  territory, all indicate the design and meaning of the clause to be  such as we have mentioned. It does not speak of _any_ territory, nor  of _Territories_, but uses language which, according to its legitimate  meaning, points to a particular thing. The power is given in relation  only to _the_ territory of the United States--that is, to a territory  then in existence, and then known or claimed as the territory of the  United States. It begins its enumeration of powers by that of  disposing, in other words, making sale of the lands, or raising money  from them, which, as we have already said, was the main object of the  cession, and which is accordingly the first thing provided for in the  article. It then gives the power which was necessarily associated with  the disposition and sale of the lands--that is, the power of making  needful rules and regulations respecting the territory. And whatever  construction may now be given to these words, every one, we think,  must admit that they are not the words usually employed by statesmen  in giving supreme power of legislation. They are certainly very unlike  the words used in the power granted to legislate over territory which  the new Government might afterwards itself obtain by cession from a  State, either for its seat of Government, or for forts, magazines,  arsenals, dock yards, and other needful buildings.    And the same power of making needful rules respecting the territory  is, in precisely the same language, applied to the _other_ property  belonging to the United States--associating the power over the  territory in this respect with the power over movable or personal  property--that is, the ships, arms, and munitions of war, which then  belonged in common to the State sovereignties. And it will hardly be  said, that this power, in relation to the last-mentioned objects, was  deemed necessary to be thus specially given to the new Government, in  order to authorize it to make needful rules and regulations respecting  the ships it might itself build, or arms and munitions of war it might  itself manufacture or provide for the public service.    No one, it is believed, would think a moment of deriving the power of  Congress to make needful rules and regulations in relation to property  of this kind from this clause of the Constitution. Nor can it, upon  any fair construction, be applied to any property but that which the  new Government was about to receive from the confederated States. And  if this be true as to this property, it must be equally true and  limited as to the territory, which is so carefully and precisely  coupled with it--and like it referred to as property in the power  granted. The concluding words of the clause appear to render this  construction irresistible; for, after the provisions we have  mentioned, it proceeds to say, \"that nothing in the Constitution shall  be so construed as to prejudice any claims of the United States, or of  any particular State.\"    Now, as we have before said, all of the States, except North Carolina  and Georgia, had made the cession before the Constitution was adopted,  according to the resolution of Congress of October 10, 1780. The  claims of other States, that the unappropriated lands in these two  States should be applied to the common benefit, in like manner, was  still insisted on, but refused by the States. And this member of the  clause in question evidently applies to them, and can apply to nothing  else. It was to exclude the conclusion that either party, by adopting  the Constitution, would surrender what they deemed their rights. And  when the latter provision relates so obviously to the unappropriated  lands not yet ceded by the States, and the first clause makes  provision for those then actually ceded, it is impossible, by any  just rule of construction, to make the first provision general, and  extend to all territories, which the Federal Government might in any  way afterwards acquire, when the latter is plainly and unequivocally  confined to a particular territory; which was a part of the same  controversy, and involved in the same dispute, and depended upon the  same principles. The union of the two provisions in the same clause  shows that they were kindred subjects; and that the whole clause is  local, and relates only to lands, within the limits of the United  States, which had been or then were claimed by a State; and that no  other territory was in the mind of the framers of the Constitution, or  intended to be embraced in it. Upon any other construction it would be  impossible to account for the insertion of the last provision in the  place where it is found, or to comprehend why, or for what object, it  was associated with the previous provision.    This view of the subject is confirmed by the manner in which the  present Government of the United States dealt with the subject as soon  as it came into existence. It must be borne in mind that the same  States that formed the Confederation also formed and adopted the new  Government, to which so large a portion of their former sovereign  powers were surrendered. It must also be borne in mind that all of  these same States which had then ratified the new Constitution were  represented in the Congress which passed the first law for the  government of this territory; and many of the members of that  legislative body had been deputies from the States under the  Confederation--had united in adopting the ordinance of 1787, and  assisted in forming the new Government under which they were then  acting, and whose powers they were then exercising. And it is obvious  from the law they passed to carry into effect the principles and  provisions of the ordinance, that they regarded it as the act of the  States done in the exercise of their legitimate powers at the time.  The new Government took the territory as it found it, and in the  condition in which it was transferred, and did not attempt to undo  anything that had been done. And, among the earliest laws passed under  the new Government, is one reviving the ordinance of 1787, which had  become inoperative and a nullity upon the adoption of the  Constitution. This law introduces no new form or principles for its  government, but recites, in the preamble, that it is passed in order  that this ordinance may continue to have full effect, and proceeds to  make only those rules and regulations which were needful to adapt it  to the new Government, into whose hands the power had fallen. It  appears, therefore, that this Congress regarded the purposes to which  the land in this Territory was to be applied, and the form of  government and principles of jurisprudence which were to prevail  there, while it remained in the Territorial state, as already  determined on by the States when they had full power and right to make  the decision; and that the new Government, having received it in this  condition, ought to carry substantially into effect the plans and  principles which had been previously adopted by the States, and which  no doubt the States anticipated when they surrendered their power to  the new Government. And if we regard this clause of the Constitution  as pointing to this Territory, with a Territorial Government already  established in it, which had been ceded to the States for the purposes  hereinbefore mentioned--every word in it is perfectly appropriate and  easily understood, and the provisions it contains are in perfect  harmony with the objects for which it was ceded, and with the  condition of its government as a Territory at the time. We can, then,  easily account for the manner in which the first Congress legislated  on the subject--and can also understand why this power over the  territory was associated in the same clause with the other property of  the United States, and subjected to the like power of making needful  rules and regulations. But if the clause is construed in the expanded  sense contended for, so as to embrace any territory acquired from a  foreign nation by the present Government, and to give it in such  territory a despotic and unlimited power over persons and property,  such as the confederated States might exercise in their common  property, it would be"]]]
