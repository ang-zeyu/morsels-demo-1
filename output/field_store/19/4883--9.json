So Driver Smith he went to the war a-cracking his driver's whip,    From ambulance to collecting base they showed him his regular trip.    And he said to the boys that were marching past, as he gave his whip a crack,    'You'll walk yourselves to the fight,' says he --      'Lord spare me, I'll drive you back.'      Now, the fight went on in the Transvaal hills for the half of a day or more,    And Driver Smith he worked his trip -- all aboard for the seat of war!    He took his load from the stretcher men and hurried 'em homeward fast    Till he heard a sound that he knew full well -- a battery rolling past.      He heard the clink of the leading chains and the roll of the guns behind --    He heard the crack of the drivers' whips,      and he says to 'em, 'Strike me blind,    I'll miss me trip with this ambulance, although I don't care to shirk,    But I'll take the car off the line to-day and follow the guns at work.'      Then up the Battery Colonel came a-cursing 'em black in the face.    'Sit down and shift 'em, you drivers there, and gallop 'em into place.'    So off the Battery rolled and swung, a-going a merry dance,    And holding his own with the leading gun goes Smith with his ambulance.      They opened fire on the mountain side, a-peppering by and large,    When over the hill above their flank the Boers came down at the charge;    They rushed the guns with a daring rush, a-volleying left and right,    And Driver Smith with his ambulance moved up to the edge of the fight.      The gunners stuck to their guns like men, and fought like the wild cats fight,    For a Battery man don't leave his gun with ever a hope in sight;    But the bullets sang and the Mausers cracked and the Battery men gave way,    Till Driver Smith with his ambulance drove into the thick of the fray.      He saw the head of the Transvaal troop a-thundering to and fro,    A hard old face with a monkey beard -- a face that he seemed to know;    'Now, who's that leader,' said Driver Smith, 'I've seen him before to-day.    Why, bless my heart, but it's Kruger's self,'      and he jumped for him straight away.      He collared old Kruger round the waist and hustled him into the van.    It wasn't according to stretcher drill for raising a wounded man;    But he forced him in and said, 'All aboard, we're off for a little ride,    And you'll have the car to yourself,' says he, 'I reckon we're full inside.'      He wheeled his team on the mountain side and set 'em a merry pace,    A-galloping over the rocks and stones, and a lot of the Boers gave chase;    But Driver Smith had a fairish start, and he said to the Boers, 'Good-day,    You have Buckley's chance for to catch a man that was trained in Battery A.'      He drove his team to the hospital and said to the P.M.O.,    'Beg pardon, sir, but I missed a trip, mistaking the way to go;    And Kruger came to the ambulance and asked could we spare a bed,    So I fetched him here, and we'll take him home to show for a bob a head.'      So the word went round to the English troops to say they need fight no more,    For Driver Smith with his ambulance had ended the blooming war:    And in London now at the music halls he's starring it every night,    And drawing a hundred pounds a week to tell how he won the fight.          There's Another Blessed Horse Fell Down          When you're lying in your hammock, sleeping soft and sleeping sound,     Without a care or trouble on your mind,    And there's nothing to disturb you but the engines going round,     And you're dreaming of the girl you left behind;    In the middle of your joys you'll be wakened by a noise,     And a clatter on the deck above your crown,    And you'll hear the corporal shout as he turns the picket out,     'There's another blessed horse fell down.'      You can see 'em in the morning, when you're cleaning out the stall,     A-leaning on the railings nearly dead,    And you reckon by the evening they'll be pretty sure to fall,     And you curse them as you tumble into bed.    Oh, you'll hear it pretty soon, 'Pass the word for Denny Moon,     There's a horse here throwing handsprings like a clown;    And it's 'Shove the others back or he'll cripple half the pack,     There's another blessed horse fell down.'      And when the war is over and the fighting all is done,     And you're all at home with medals on your chest,    And you've learnt to sleep so soundly that the firing of a gun     At your bedside wouldn't rob you of your rest;    As you lie in slumber deep, if your wife walks in her sleep,     And tumbles down the stairs and breaks her crown,    Oh, it won't awaken you, for you'll say, 'It's nothing new,     It's another blessed horse fell down.'          On the Trek          Oh, the weary, weary journey on the trek, day after day,     With sun above and silent veldt below;    And our hearts keep turning homeward to the youngsters far away,     And the homestead where the climbing roses grow.    Shall we see the flats grow golden with the ripening of the grain?     Shall we hear the parrots calling on the bough?    Ah! the weary months of marching ere we hear them call again,     For we're going on a long job now.      In the drowsy days on escort, riding slowly half asleep,     With the endless line of waggons stretching back,    While the khaki soldiers travel like a mob of travelling sheep,     Plodding silent on the never-ending track,    While the constant snap and sniping of the foe you never see     Makes you wonder will your turn come -- when and how?    As the Mauser ball hums past you like a vicious kind of bee --     Oh! we're going on a long job now.      When the dash and the excitement and the novelty are dead,     And you've seen a load of wounded once or twice,    Or you've watched your old mate dying -- with the vultures overhead,     Well, you wonder if the war is worth the price.    And down along Monaro now they're starting out to shear,     I can picture the excitement and the row;    But they'll miss me on the Lachlan when they call the roll this year,     For we're going on a long job now.          The Last Parade          With never a sound of trumpet,     With never a flag displayed,    The last of the old campaigners     Lined up for the last parade.      Weary they were and battered,     Shoeless, and knocked about;    From under their ragged forelocks     Their hungry eyes looked out.      And they watched as the old commander     Read out, to the cheering men,    The Nation's thanks and the orders     To carry them home again.      And the last of the old campaigners,     Sinewy, lean, and spare --    He spoke for his hungry comrades:     'Have we not done our share?      'Starving and tired and thirsty     We limped on the blazing plain;    And after a long night's picket     You saddled us up again.      'We froze on the wind-swept kopjes     When the frost lay snowy-white.    Never a halt in the daytime,     Never a rest at night!      'We knew when the rifles rattled     From the hillside bare and brown,    And over our weary shoulders     We felt warm blood run down,      'As we turned for the stretching gallop,     Crushed to the earth with weight;    But we carried our riders through it --     Carried them p'raps too late.      'Steel!  We were steel to stand it --     We that have lasted through,    We that are old campaigners     Pitiful, poor, and few.      'Over the sea you brought us,     Over the leagues of foam:    Now we have served you fairly     Will you not take us home?      'Home to the Hunter River,     To the flats where the lucerne grows;    Home where the Murrumbidgee     Runs white with the melted snows.      'This is a small thing surely!     Will not you give command    That the last of the old campaigners     Go back to their native land?'           .    .    .    .    .      They looked at the grim commander,     But never a sign he made.    'Dismiss!' and the old campaigners     Moved off from their last parade.          With French to Kimberley          The Boers were down on Kimberley with siege and Maxim gun;    The Boers were down on Kimberley, their numbers ten to one!    Faint were the hopes the British had to make the struggle good,    Defenceless in an open plain the Diamond City stood.    They built them forts from bags of sand, they fought from roof and wall,    They flashed a message to the south 'Help! or the town must fall!'    And down our ranks the order ran to march at dawn of day,    For French was off to Kimberley to drive the Boers away.      He made no march along the line; he made no front attack    Upon those Magersfontein heights that drove the Scotchmen back;    But eastward over pathless plains by open veldt and vley,    Across the front of Cronje's force his troopers held their way.    The springbuck, feeding on the flats where Modder River runs,    Were startled by his horses' hoofs, the rumble of his guns.    The Dutchman's spies that watched his march from every rocky wall    Rode back in haste:  'He marches east!  He threatens Jacobsdal!'    Then north he wheeled as wheels the hawk and showed to their dismay,    That French was off to Kimberley to drive the Boers away.      His column was five thousand strong -- all mounted men -- and guns:    There met, beneath the world-wide flag, the world-wide Empire's sons;    They came to prove to all the earth that kinship conquers space,    And those who fight the British Isles must fight the British race!    From far New Zealand's flax and fern, from cold Canadian snows,    From Queensland plains, where hot as fire the summer sunshine glows;    And in the front the Lancers rode that New South Wales had sent:    With easy"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30427"],[0,"The Lost Kafoozalum (#12)"],[1," over the stretcher  puts me in the field of the antigrav. A moment later another gust  comes, and I realize I am rising into the air.    Gripping the edge of the stretcher with one hand I reach out the  other, trying to grasp some projection on the face of the cliff. Not  being able to see I simply push farther away till it is out of reach.    We are still rising.    I pull myself up on the stretcher; there is just room for my toes on  either side of M'Clare's legs. The wind roaring in my ears makes it  difficult to think.    Rods of light slash down at me from the edge of the cliff. For a  moment all I can do is duck; then I realize we are still well below  them, but rising every moment. The cliff-face is about six feet away;  the wind reflecting from it keeps us from being blown closer.    I must get the antigrav off. I let myself over the side of the  stretcher, hanging by one hand, and fumble for the controls. I can  just reach. Then I realize this is no use. Antigrav controls are not  meant to go off with a click of the finger; they might get switched  off accidentally. To work the switch and the safety you must have two  hands, or one hand in the optimum position. My position is about as  bad as it could be. I can stroke the switch with one finger; no more.    I haul myself back on to the stretcher and realize we are only about  six feet under the beam of light. Only one thing left. I feel in my  pocket for the Andite. Stupidly, I am still also bending over the  outlet valve of the helmet, trying to see whether M'Clare is still  breathing or not.    The little white cigar is not fused. I have to hold on with one hand.  In the end I manage to stick the Andite between thumb and finger-roots  of that hand while I use the other to find the fuse and stick it over  the Andite. The shortest; three minutes.    I think the valve is still moving--    Then something drops round me; I am hauled tight against the  stretcher; we are pulled strongly downwards with the wind buffeting  and snatching, banged against the edge of something, and pulled  through into silence and the dark.    For a moment I do not understand; then I recognize the feel of Fragile  Cargo, still clamping me to the stretcher, and I open my mouth and  scream and scream.    Clatter of feet. Hatch opens. Fragile Cargo goes limp.    I stagger to my feet. Faint light through the hatch; B's head. I hold  out the Andite stick and she turns and shouts; and a panel slides open  in the wall so that the wind comes roaring in.    I push the stick through and the wind snatches it away and it is gone.    After that--           *       *       *       *       *    After that, for a while, nothing, I suppose, though I have no  recollection of losing consciousness; only without any sense of break  I find I am flat on my back on one of the seats in the cabin of the  hopper.    I sit up and say \"How--\"    B who is sitting on the floor beside me says that when the broadcaster  was activated of course they came at once, only while they were  waiting for the boat to reach land whole squads of land cars arrived  and started combing the area, and some came up on top of the cliff and  shone their headlights out over the sea so Mr. Yardo had to lurk  against the cliff face and wait till I got into a position where he  could pick me up and it was _frightfully_ clever of me to think of  floating up on antigrav--    I forgot about the broadcaster.    I forgot about the hopper come to that, there seemed to be nothing in  the world except me and the stretcher and the enemy.    Stretcher.    I say, \"Is M'Clare--\"    At which moment Mr. Yardo turns from the controls with a wide smile of  triumph and says \"Eighteen twenty-seven, girls!\" and the world goes  weightless and swings upside down.    Then still with no sense of any time-lapse I am lying in the big  lighted hold, with the sound of trampling all round: it is somehow  filtered and far off and despite the lights there seems to be a globe  of darkness around my head. I hear my own voice repeating, \"M'Clare?  How's M'Clare?\"    A voice says distantly, without emphasis, \"M'Clare? He's dead.\"    The next time I come round it is dark. I am vaguely aware of having  been unconscious for quite a while.    There is a single thread of knowledge connecting this moment with the  last: M'Clare's dead.    This is the central factor: I seem to have been debating it with  myself for a very long time.    I suppose the truth is simply that the Universe never guarantees  anything; life, or permanence, or that your best will be good enough.    The rule is that you have to pick yourself up and go on; and lying  here in the dark is not doing it.    I turn on my side and see a cluster of self-luminous objects including  a light switch. I reach for it.    How did I get into a hospital?    On second thoughts it is a cabin in the ship, or rather two of them  with the partition torn out, I can see the ragged edge of it. There is  a lot of paraphernalia around; I climb out to have a look.    Holy horrors what's happened? Someone borrowed my legs and put them  back wrong; my eyes also are not functioning well, the light is set at  Minimum and I am still dazzled. I see a door and make for it to get  Explanations from somebody.    Arrived, I miss my footing and stumble against the door and on the  other side someone says \"Hello, Lizzie. Awake at last?\"    I think my heart stops for a moment. I can't find the latch. I am  vaguely aware of beating something with my fists, and then the door  gives, sticks, gives again and I stumble through and land on all fours  the other side of it.    Someone is calling: \"Lizzie! Are you hurt? Where the devil have they  all got to? Liz!\"    I sit up and say, \"They said you were _dead_!\"    \"_Who_ did?\"    \"I ... I ... someone in the hold. I said How's M'Clare? and they said  you were dead.\"    M'Clare frowns and says gently, \"Come over here and sit down quietly  for a bit. You've been dreaming.\"    Have I? Maybe the whole thing was a dream--but if so how far does it  go? Going down in the heli? The missile? The boat? Crawling through  the black tunnel of a broken ship?    No, because he is sitting in a sort of improvised chaise longue and  his legs are evidently strapped in place under the blanket; he is  fumbling with the fastening or something.           *       *       *       *       *    I say \"Hey! Cut that out!\"    He straightens up irritably.    \"Don't you start that, Lysistrata. I've been suffering the attentions  of the damnedest collection of amateur nurses who ever handled a  thermocouple, for over a week. I don't deny they've been very  efficient, but when it comes to--\"    Over a _week_?    He nods. \"My dear Lizzie, we left Incognita ten days ago. Amateur  nursing again! They have some unholy book of rules which says that for  Exposure, Exhaustion and Shock the best therapy is sleep. I don't  doubt it, but it goes on to say that in extreme cases the patient has  been known to benefit by as much as two weeks of it. I didn't find out  that they were trying it on you until about thirty-six hours ago when  I began inquiring why you weren't around. They kept me under for three  days--in fact until their infernal Handbook said it was time for my  leg muscles to have some exercise. Miss Lammergaw was the  ring-leader.\"    No wonder my legs feel as though someone exchanged the muscles for  cotton wool, just wait till I get hold of Kirsty.    If it hadn't been for her, I shouldn't have spent ten days  remembering, even in my sleep, that--    I say, \"Hell's feathers, it was _you_!\"    M'Clare makes motions as though to start getting out of his chair,  looking seriously alarmed. I say, \"It was your voice! When I asked--\"    M'Clare, quite definitely, starts to blush. Not much, but some.    \"Lizzie, I believe you're right. I have a sort of vague memory of  someone asking how I was--and I gave what I took to be a truthful  answer. I remember it seemed quite inconceivable that I could be  alive. In fact I still don't understand it. Neither Yardo nor Miss  Laydon could tell me. How _did_ you get me out of that ship?\"    Well, I do my best to explain, glossing over one or two points; at the  finish he closes his eyes and says nothing for a while.    Then he says, \"So except for this one man who saw you, you left no  traces at all?\"    Not that I know of, but--    \"Do you know, five minutes later there were at least twenty men in  that bay, most of them scientists? They don't seem to have found  anything suspicious. Visibility was bad, of course, and you can't  leave foot-prints in shingle--\"    Hold on, what _is_ all this?    M'Clare says, \"We've had two couriers while you were asleep. Yes, I  know it's not ordinarily possible for a ship on Mass-Time to get news.  One of these days someone will have an interesting problem in Cultural  Engineering, working out how to integrate some of these Space Force  secrets into our economic and social structure without upsetting the  whole of the known volume. Though courier boats make their crews so  infernally sick I doubt whether the present type will ever come into  common use. Anyway, we've had transcripts of a good many broadcasts  from Incognita, the last dated four days ago; and as far as we can  tell they're interpreting _Gilgamesh_ just as we meant them to.    \"The missile, by the way, was experimental, waiting to be test-fired  the next day. The man in charge saw _Gilgamesh_ on the alarm screens  and got trigger-happy. The newscasters were divided as to whether he  should be blamed or praised; they all seem to feel he averted a  menace, at least temporarily, but some of them think the invaders  could have been captured alive.    \"The first people on the scene came from a scientific camp; you and  Miss Laydon saw their lights on the way down. You remember that area  is geophysically interesting? Well, by extraordinary good luck an  international group was there studying it."]]]
