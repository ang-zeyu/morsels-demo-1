[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/271"],[0,"Black Beauty (#12)"],[1,"Tom Green said in a low voice:    \"I wish, John, you'd say a bit of a kind word to Joe. The boy is quite  broken-hearted; he can't eat his meals, and he can't smile. He says he  knows it was all his fault, though he is sure he did the best he knew,  and he says if Beauty dies no one will ever speak to him again. It goes  to my heart to hear him. I think you might give him just a word; he is  not a bad boy.\"    After a short pause John said slowly, \"You must not be too hard upon me,  Tom. I know he meant no harm, I never said he did; I know he is not a  bad boy. But you see, I am sore myself; that horse is the pride of my  heart, to say nothing of his being such a favorite with the master and  mistress; and to think that his life may be flung away in this manner is  more than I can bear. But if you think I am hard on the boy I will try  to give him a good word to-morrow--that is, I mean if Beauty is better.\"    \"Well, John, thank you. I knew you did not wish to be too hard, and I am  glad you see it was only ignorance.\"    John's voice almost startled me as he answered:    \"Only ignorance! only ignorance! how can you talk about only ignorance?  Don't you know that it is the worst thing in the world, next to  wickedness?--and which does the most mischief heaven only knows. If  people can say, 'Oh! I did not know, I did not mean any harm,' they  think it is all right. I suppose Martha Mulwash did not mean to kill  that baby when she dosed it with Dalby and soothing syrups; but she did  kill it, and was tried for manslaughter.\"    \"And serve her right, too,\" said Tom. \"A woman should not undertake to  nurse a tender little child without knowing what is good and what is bad  for it.\"    \"Bill Starkey,\" continued John, \"did not mean to frighten his brother  into fits when he dressed up like a ghost and ran after him in the  moonlight; but he did; and that bright, handsome little fellow, that  might have been the pride of any mother's heart is just no better than  an idiot, and never will be, if he lives to be eighty years old. You  were a good deal cut up yourself, Tom, two weeks ago, when those young  ladies left your hothouse door open, with a frosty east wind blowing  right in; you said it killed a good many of your plants.\"    \"A good many!\" said Tom; \"there was not one of the tender cuttings that  was not nipped off. I shall have to strike all over again, and the worst  of it is that I don't know where to go to get fresh ones. I was nearly  mad when I came in and saw what was done.\"    \"And yet,\" said John, \"I am sure the young ladies did not mean it; it  was only ignorance.\"    I heard no more of this conversation, for the medicine did well and sent  me to sleep, and in the morning I felt much better; but I often thought  of John's words when I came to know more of the world.          20 Joe Green      Joe Green went on very well; he learned quickly, and was so attentive  and careful that John began to trust him in many things; but as I have  said, he was small of his age, and it was seldom that he was allowed to  exercise either Ginger or me; but it so happened one morning that John  was out with Justice in the luggage cart, and the master wanted a  note to be taken immediately to a gentleman's house, about three miles  distant, and sent his orders for Joe to saddle me and take it, adding  the caution that he was to ride steadily.    The note was delivered, and we were quietly returning when we came  to the brick-field. Here we saw a cart heavily laden with bricks; the  wheels had stuck fast in the stiff mud of some deep ruts, and the carter  was shouting and flogging the two horses unmercifully. Joe pulled up. It  was a sad sight. There were the two horses straining and struggling with  all their might to drag the cart out, but they could not move it; the  sweat streamed from their legs and flanks, their sides heaved, and every  muscle was strained, while the man, fiercely pulling at the head of the  fore horse, swore and lashed most brutally.    \"Hold hard,\" said Joe; \"don't go on flogging the horses like that; the  wheels are so stuck that they cannot move the cart.\"    The man took no heed, but went on lashing.    \"Stop! pray stop!\" said Joe. \"I'll help you to lighten the cart; they  can't move it now.\"    \"Mind your own business, you impudent young rascal, and I'll mind mine!\"  The man was in a towering passion and the worse for drink, and laid on  the whip again. Joe turned my head, and the next moment we were going at  a round gallop toward the house of the master brick-maker. I cannot say  if John would have approved of our pace, but Joe and I were both of one  mind, and so angry that we could not have gone slower.    The house stood close by the roadside. Joe knocked at the door, and  shouted, \"Halloo! Is Mr. Clay at home?\" The door was opened, and Mr.  Clay himself came out.    \"Halloo, young man! You seem in a hurry; any orders from the squire this  morning?\"    \"No, Mr. Clay, but there's a fellow in your brick-yard flogging two  horses to death. I told him to stop, and he wouldn't; I said I'd help  him to lighten the cart, and he wouldn't; so I have come to tell you.  Pray, sir, go.\" Joe's voice shook with excitement.    \"Thank ye, my lad,\" said the man, running in for his hat; then pausing  for a moment, \"Will you give evidence of what you saw if I should bring  the fellow up before a magistrate?\"    \"That I will,\" said Joe, \"and glad too.\" The man was gone, and we were  on our way home at a smart trot.    \"Why, what's the matter with you, Joe? You look angry all over,\" said  John, as the boy flung himself from the saddle.    \"I am angry all over, I can tell you,\" said the boy, and then in  hurried, excited words he told all that had happened. Joe was usually  such a quiet, gentle little fellow that it was wonderful to see him so  roused.    \"Right, Joe! you did right, my boy, whether the fellow gets a summons or  not. Many folks would have ridden by and said it was not their  business to interfere. Now I say that with cruelty and oppression it is  everybody's business to interfere when they see it; you did right, my  boy.\"    Joe was quite calm by this time, and proud that John approved of him,  and cleaned out my feet and rubbed me down with a firmer hand than  usual.    They were just going home to dinner when the footman came down to the  stable to say that Joe was wanted directly in master's private room;  there was a man brought up for ill-using horses, and Joe's evidence was  wanted. The boy flushed up to his forehead, and his eyes sparkled. \"They  shall have it,\" said he.    \"Put yourself a bit straight,\" said John. Joe gave a pull at his necktie  and a twitch at his jacket, and was off in a moment. Our master being  one of the county magistrates, cases were often brought to him to  settle, or say what should be done. In the stable we heard no more for  some time, as it was the men's dinner hour, but when Joe came next into  the stable I saw he was in high spirits; he gave me a good-natured slap,  and said, \"We won't see such things done, will we, old fellow?\" We heard  afterward that he had given his evidence so clearly, and the horses were  in such an exhausted state, bearing marks of such brutal usage, that the  carter was committed to take his trial, and might possibly be sentenced  to two or three months in prison.    It was wonderful what a change had come over Joe. John laughed, and said  he had grown an inch taller in that week, and I believe he had. He  was just as kind and gentle as before, but there was more purpose and  determination in all that he did--as if he had jumped at once from a boy  into a man.          21 The Parting      Now I had lived in this happy place three years, but sad changes were  about to come over us. We heard from time to time that our mistress was  ill. The doctor was often at the house, and the master looked grave and  anxious. Then we heard that she must leave her home at once, and go to  a warm country for two or three years. The news fell upon the household  like the tolling of a deathbell. Everybody was sorry; but the master  began directly to make arrangements for breaking up his establishment  and leaving England. We used to hear it talked about in our stable;  indeed, nothing else was talked about.    John went about his work silent and sad, and Joe scarcely whistled.  There was a great deal of coming and going; Ginger and I had full work.    The first of the party who went were Miss Jessie and Flora, with their  governess. They came to bid us good-by. They hugged poor Merrylegs  like an old friend, and so indeed he was. Then we heard what had been  arranged for us. Master had sold Ginger and me to his old friend,  the Earl of W----, for he thought we should have a good place there.  Merrylegs he had given to the vicar, who was wanting a pony for Mrs.  Blomefield, but it was on the condition that he should never be sold,  and that when he was past work he should be shot and buried.    Joe was engaged to take care of him and to help in the house, so I  thought that Merrylegs was well off. John had the offer of several good  places, but he said he should wait a little and look round.    The evening before they left the master came into the stable to give  some directions, and to give his horses the last pat. He seemed very  low-spirited; I knew that by his voice. I believe we horses can tell  more by the voice than many men can.    \"Have you decided what to do, John?\" he said. \"I find you have not  accepted either of those offers.\"    \"No, sir; I have made up my mind that if I could get a situation with  some first-rate colt-breaker and horse-trainer, it would be the right  thing for me. Many young animals are frightened and spoiled by wrong  treatment, which need not be if the right man took them in hand. I  always get on well with horses, and if I could help some of them to a  fair start I should feel as if I was doing some good.

You observe, messieurs, that the defunct  lady or gentleman could not have been of very high rank.\"    \"No; no one seems to be following the coffin.\"    \"Yes,\" said Porthos; \"I see a man.\"    \"You are right; a man wrapped in a cloak,\" said D'Artagnan.    \"It's not worth looking at,\" said Planchet.    \"I find it interesting,\" said D'Artagnan, leaning on the window-sill.    \"Come, come, you are beginning to take a fancy to the place already,\"  said Planchet, delightedly; \"it is exactly my own case. I was so  melancholy at first that I could do nothing but make the sign of the  cross all day, and the chants were like so many nails being driven into  my head; but now, they lull me to sleep, and no bird I have ever seen  or heard can sing better than those which are to be met with in this  cemetery.\"    \"Well,\" said Porthos, \"this is beginning to get a little dull for me,  and I prefer going downstairs.\"    Planchet with one bound was beside his guest, whom he offered to lead  into the garden.    \"What!\" said Porthos to D'Artagnan, as he turned round, \"are you going  to remain here?\"    \"Yes, I will join you presently.\"    \"Well, M. D'Artagnan is right, after all,\" said Planchet: \"are they  beginning to bury yet?\"    \"Not yet.\"    \"Ah! yes, the grave-digger is waiting until the cords are fastened round  the bier. But, see, a woman has just entered the cemetery at the other  end.\"    \"Yes, yes, my dear Planchet,\" said D'Artagnan, quickly, \"leave me,  leave me; I feel I am beginning already to be much comforted by my  meditations, so do not interrupt me.\"    Planchet left, and D'Artagnan remained, devouring with his eager gaze  from behind the half-closed blinds what was taking place just before  him. The two bearers of the corpse had unfastened the straps by which  they carried the litter, and were letting their burden glide gently into  the open grave. At a few paces distant, the man with the cloak wrapped  round him, the only spectator of this melancholy scene, was leaning  with his back against a large cypress-tree, and kept his face and person  entirely concealed from the grave-diggers and the priests; the corpse  was buried in five minutes. The grave having been filled up, the priests  turned away, and the grave-digger having addressed a few words to them,  followed them as they moved away. The man in the mantle bowed as they  passed him, and put a piece of gold into the grave-digger's hand.    \"_Mordioux!_\" murmured D'Artagnan; \"it is Aramis himself.\"    Aramis, in fact, remained alone, on that side at least; for hardly had  he turned his head when a woman's footsteps, and the rustling of her  dress, were heard in the path close to him. He immediately turned round,  and took off his hat with the most ceremonious respect; he led the lady  under the shelter of some walnut and lime trees, which overshadowed a  magnificent tomb.    \"Ah! who would have thought it,\" said D'Artagnan; \"the bishop of  Vannes at a rendezvous! He is still the same Abbe Aramis as he was  at Noisy-le-Sec. Yes,\" he added, after a pause; \"but as it is in a  cemetery, the rendezvous is sacred.\" But he almost laughed.    The conversation lasted for fully half an hour. D'Artagnan could not see  the lady's face, for she kept her back turned towards him; but he saw  perfectly well, by the erect attitude of both the speakers, by their  gestures, by the measured and careful manner with which they glanced  at each other, either by way of attack or defense, that they must be  conversing about any other subject than of love. At the end of the  conversation the lady rose, and bowed profoundly to Aramis.    \"Oh, oh,\" said D'Artagnan; \"this rendezvous finishes like one of a very  tender nature though. The cavalier kneels at the beginning, the  young lady by and by gets tamed down, and then it is she who has to  supplicate. Who is this lady? I would give anything to ascertain.\"    This seemed impossible, however, for Aramis was the first to leave;  the lady carefully concealed her head and face, and then immediately  departed. D'Artagnan could hold out no longer; he ran to the window  which looked out on the Rue de Lyon, and saw Aramis entering the inn.  The lady was proceeding in quite an opposite direction, and seemed, in  fact, to be about to rejoin an equipage, consisting of two led horses  and a carriage, which he could see standing close to the borders of  the forest. She was walking slowly, her head bent down, absorbed in the  deepest meditation.    \"_Mordioux! Mordioux!_ I must and will learn who that woman is,\" said  the musketeer again; and then, without further deliberation, he set off  in pursuit of her. As he was going along, he tried to think how he could  possibly contrive to make her raise her veil. \"She is not young,\" he  said, \"and is a woman of high rank in society. I ought to know that  figure and peculiar style of walk.\" As he ran, the sound of his spurs  and of his boots upon the hard ground of the street made a strange  jingling noise; a fortunate circumstance in itself, which he was far  from reckoning upon. The noise disturbed the lady; she seemed to fancy  she was being either followed or pursued, which was indeed the case, and  turned round. D'Artagnan started as if he had received a charge of small  shot in his legs, and then turning suddenly round as if he were going  back the same way he had come, he murmured, \"Madame de Chevreuse!\"  D'Artagnan would not go home until he had learnt everything. He asked  Celestin to inquire of the grave-digger whose body it was they had  buried that morning.    \"A poor Franciscan mendicant friar,\" replied the latter, \"who had not  even a dog to love him in this world, and to accompany him to his last  resting-place.\"    \"If that were really the case,\" thought D'Artagnan, \"we should not  have found Aramis present at his funeral. The bishop of Vannes is not  precisely a dog as far as devotion goes: his scent, however, is quite as  keen, I admit.\"        Chapter VII. How Porthos, Truchen, and Planchet Parted with Each Other  on Friendly Terms, Thanks to D'Artagnan.    There was good living in Planchet's house. Porthos broke a ladder and  two cherry-trees, stripped the raspberry-bushes, and was only unable to  succeed in reaching the strawberry-beds on account, as he said, of his  belt. Truchen, who had become quite sociable with the giant, said that  it was not the belt so much as his corporation; and Porthos, in a state  of the highest delight, embraced Truchen, who gathered him a pailful of  the strawberries, and made him eat them out of her hands. D'Artagnan,  who arrived in the midst of these little innocent flirtations, scolded  Porthos for his indolence, and silently pitied Planchet. Porthos  breakfasted with a very good appetite, and when he had finished, he  said, looking at Truchen, \"I could make myself very happy here.\"  Truchen smiled at his remark, and so did Planchet, but not without  embarrassment.    D'Artagnan then addressed Porthos: \"You must not let the delights of  Capua make you forget the real object of our journey to Fontainebleau.\"    \"My presentation to the king?\"    \"Certainly. I am going to take a turn in the town to get everything  ready for that. Do not think of leaving the house, I beg.\"    \"Oh, no!\" exclaimed Porthos.    Planchet looked at D'Artagnan nervously.    \"Will you be away long?\" he inquired.    \"No, my friend; and this very evening I will release you from two  troublesome guests.\"    \"Oh! Monsieur d'Artagnan! can you say--\"    \"No, no; you are a noble-hearted fellow, but your house is very small.  Such a house, with half a dozen acres of land, would be fit for a king,  and make him very happy, too. But you were not born a great lord.\"    \"No more was M. Porthos,\" murmured Planchet.    \"But he has become so, my good fellow; his income has been a hundred  thousand francs a year for the last twenty years, and for the last fifty  years Porthos has been the owner of a couple of fists and a backbone,  which are not to be matched throughout the whole realm of France.  Porthos is a man of the very greatest consequence compared to you,  and... well, I need say no more, for I know you are an intelligent  fellow.\"    \"No, no, monsieur, explain what you mean.\"    \"Look at your orchard, how stripped it is, how empty your larder, your  bedstead broken, your cellar almost exhausted, look too... at Madame  Truchen--\"    \"Oh! my goodness gracious!\" said Planchet.    \"Madame Truchen is an excellent person,\" continued D'Artagnan, \"but  keep her for yourself, do you understand?\" and he slapped him on the  shoulder.    Planchet at this moment perceived Porthos and Truchen sitting close  together in an arbor; Truchen, with a grace of manner peculiarly  Flemish, was making a pair of earrings for Porthos out of a double  cherry, while Porthos was laughing as amorously as Samson in the company  of Delilah. Planchet pressed D'Artagnan's hand, and ran towards the  arbor. We must do Porthos the justice to say that he did not move as  they approached, and, very likely, he did not think he was doing any  harm. Nor indeed did Truchen move either, which rather put Planchet out;  but he, too, had been so accustomed to see fashionable folk in his shop,  that he found no difficulty in putting a good countenance on what seemed  disagreeable or rude. Planchet seized Porthos by the arm, and proposed  to go and look at the horses, but Porthos pretended he was tired.  Planchet then suggested that the Baron du Vallon should taste some  noyeau of his own manufacture, which was not to be equaled anywhere; an  offer the baron immediately"]]]
