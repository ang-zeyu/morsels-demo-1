The young birches and poplars, filmed with the  first of the green, crowded close upon the trail, with, here and  there, a rose-blooming maple, here and there, a sombre, black-green  hemlock, towering over the thick second growth. The early air was  fresh, but soft; fragrant with the breath of opening buds. Faint mists  streamed up into the sunlight along the mossy line of the trail, and  the only sounds breaking the silence of the wilderness were the  sweetly plaintive calls of two rain-birds, answering each other slowly  over the treetops. Everything in the scene--the tenderness of the  colour and the air, the responses of the mating birds, the hope and  the expectancy of all the waking world--seemed piteously at variance  with the anguish of the stricken mother and her young, down there in  the solitude of the trail.    Presently, in the undergrowth beside the trail, a few paces beyond the  deadfall, a twig snapped sharply. Admonished by that experience of a  thousand ancestral generations which is instinct, the calf lifted his  big awkward ears apprehensively, and with a shiver drew closer to his  mother's crushed body. A moment later a gaunt black bear thrust his  head and shoulders forth from the undergrowth, and surveyed the scene  with savage, but shrewd, little eyes. He was hungry, and to his  palate no other delicacy the spring wilderness could ever afford was  equal to a young moose calf. But the situation gave him pause. The  mother moose was evidently in a trap; and the bear was wary of all  traps. He sank back into the undergrowth, and crept noiselessly nearer  to reconnoitre. In his suspicious eyes even a calf might be dangerous  to tamper with, under such unusual conditions as these. As he vanished  the calf shuddered violently, and tried to climb upon his mother's  mangled body.    In a few seconds the bear's head appeared again, close by the base of  the deadfall. With crafty nose he sniffed at the great timber which  held the moose cow down. The calf was now almost within reach of the  deadly sweep of his paw; but the man-smell was strong on the deadfall,  and the bear was still suspicious. While he hesitated, from behind a  bend in the trail came a sound of footsteps. The bear knew the sound.  A man was coming. Yes, certainly there was some trick about it. With a  grunt of indignant disgust he shrank back again into the thicket and  fled stealthily from so dangerous a neighbourhood. Hungry as he was,  he had no wish to try conclusions with man.    The woodsman came striding down the trail hurriedly, rounded the turn,  and stopped abruptly. He understood at a glance the evil work of the  game poachers. With indignant pity, he stepped forward and drew a  merciful knife across the throat of the suffering beast. The calf  shrank away and stood staring at him anxiously, wavering between  terror and trust.    For a moment or two the man hesitated. Of one thing he was certain:  the poachers who had set the deadfall must not profit by their  success. Moreover, fresh moose-meat would not be unappreciated in his  backwoods cabin. He turned and retraced his steps at a run, fearing  lest some hungry spring marauders should arrive in his absence. And  the calf, more than ever terrified by his mother's unresponsiveness,  stared after him uneasily as he vanished.    For half an hour nothing happened. The early chill passed from the  air, a comforting warmth glowed down the trail, the two rain-birds  kept whistling to each other their long, persuasive, melancholy call,  and the calf stood motionless, waiting, with the patience of the wild,  for he knew not what. Then there came a clanking of chains, a  trampling of heavy feet, and around the turn appeared the man again,  with a pair of big brown horses harnessed to a drag-sled. The calf  backed away as the man approached, and watched with dull wonder as the  great log was rolled aside and his mother's limp, crushed form was  hoisted laboriously upon the sled. This accomplished, the man turned  and came to him gently, with hand outstretched. To run away would have  been to run away from the shelter of his mother's presence; so, with a  snort of apprehension, he submitted to being stroked and rubbed about  the ears and neck and throat. The sensation was curiously comforting,  and suddenly his fear vanished. With his long, mobile muzzle he began  to tug appealingly at a convenient fold of the man's woollen sleeve.  Smiling complacently at this sign of confidence, the man left him, and  started the team at a slow walk up the trail. With a hoarse bleat of  alarm, thinking he was about to be deserted, the calf followed after  the sled, his long legs wobbling awkwardly.    From the first moment that she set eyes upon him, shambling awkwardly  into the yard at her husband's heels, Jabe Smith's wife was  inhospitable toward the ungainly youngling of the wild. She  declared that he would take all the milk. And he did. For the next  two months she was unable to make any butter, and her opinions on  the subject were expressed without reserve. But Jabe was inflexible,  in his taciturn, backwoods way, and the calf, till he was old enough  to pasture, got all the milk he wanted. He grew and throve so  astonishingly that Jabe began to wonder if there was not some  mistake in the scheme of things, making cows' milk the proper  nutriment for moose calves. By autumn the youngster was so big and  sleek that he might almost have passed for a yearling.    Jabe Smith, lumberman, pioneer and guide, loved all animals, even  those which in the fierce joy of the hunt he loved to kill. The young  moose bull, however, was his peculiar favourite--partly, perhaps,  because of Mrs. Smith's relentless hostility to it. And the ungainly  youngster repaid his love with a devotion that promised to become  embarrassing. All around the farm he was for ever at his heels, like a  dog; and if, by any chance, he became separated from his idol, he  would make for him in a straight line, regardless of currant bushes,  bean rows, cabbage patches or clothes-lines. This strenuous directness  did not further endear him to Mrs. Smith. That good lady used to lie  awake at night, angrily devising schemes for getting rid of the \"ugly  brute.\" These schemes of vengeance were such a safety-valve to her  injured feelings that she would at last make up her mind to content  herself with \"takin' it out on the hide o' the critter\" next day, with  a sound hickory stick. When next day came, however, and she went out  to milk, the youngster would shamble up to greet her with such amiable  trust in his eyes that her wrath would be, for the moment, disarmed,  and her fell purpose would fritter out in a futile \"Scat, you brute!\"  Then she would condone her weakness by thinking of what she would do  to the animal \"some day.\"    That \"some day,\" as luck would have it, came rather sooner than  she expected. From the first, the little moose had evinced a  determination to take up his abode in the kitchen, in his dread of  being separated from Jabe. Being a just man, Jabe had conceded at  once that his wife should have the choosing of her kitchen guests;  and, to avoid complications, he had rigged up a hinged bar across  the kitchen doorway, so that the door could safely stand open. When  the little bull was not at Jabe's heels, and did not know where to  find him, his favourite attitude was standing in front of the  kitchen door, his long nose thrust in as far as the bar would permit,  his long ears waving hopefully, his eyes intently on the mysterious  operations of Mrs. Jabe's housework. Though she would not have  acknowledged it for worlds, even to her inmost heart, the good woman  took much satisfaction out of that awkward, patient presence in the  doorway. When things went wrong with her, in that perverse way so  trying to the careful housewife, she could ease her feelings  wonderfully by expressing them without reserve to the young moose, who  never looked amused or attempted to answer back.    But one day, as it chanced, her feelings claimed a more violent  easement--and got it. She was scrubbing the kitchen floor. Just in the  doorway stood the scrubbing-pail, full of dirty suds. On a chair close  by stood a dish of eggs. The moose calf was nowhere in sight, and the  bar was down. Tired and hot, she got up from her aching knees and went  over to the stove to see if the pot was boiling, ready to make fresh  suds.    At this moment the young bull, who had been searching in vain all over  the farm for Jabe, came up to the door with a silent, shambling rush.  The bar was down. Surely, then, Jabe was inside! Overjoyed at the  opportunity he lurched his long legs over the threshold. Instantly his  great, loose hoofs slid on the slippery floor, and he came down  sprawling, striking the pail of dirty suds as he fell. With a seething  souse the slops went abroad, all over the floor. At the same time the  bouncing pail struck the chair, turned it over, and sent the dish of  eggs crashing in every direction.    For one second Mrs. Jabe stared rigidly at the mess of eggs, suds and  broken china, at the startled calf struggling to his feet. Then, with  a hysterical scream, she turned, snatched the boiling pot from the  stove, and hurled it blindly at the author of all mischief.    Happily for the blunderer, Mrs. Jabe's rage was so unbridled that she  really tried to hit the object of it. Therefore, she missed. The pot  went crashing through the leg of a table and shivered to atoms against  the log wall, contributing its full share to the discouraging mess on  the floor. But, as it whirled past, a great wedge of the boiling water  leaped out over the rim, flew off at a tangent, and caught the  floundering calf full in the side, in a long flare down from the tip  of the left shoulder. The scalding fluid seemed to cling in the  short, fine hair almost like"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30000"],[0,"The Bird Book (#12)"],[1,"marina._    Range.--Southern seas, accidentally north to the coast of Massachusetts.  This beautiful species is of about the same size as the Leach's Petrel.  It has bluish gray upper parts; the whole under parts, as well as the  forehead and sides of head, are white.    These birds have the same characteristics as do others of the species,  pattering over the water with their feet as they skim over the crests  and troughs of the waves. They are not uncommon in the waters about New  Zealand where they breed. Their single eggs are about the same as  Leach's Petrel, are brilliant white and are, very strongly, for a Petrel  egg, wreathed about the large end with dots of reddish brown. Size 1.32  x .90. Data.--Chatham Is., New Zealand, January 7, 1901. Egg laid at end  of a burrow. Collector, J. Lobb. This egg is in Mr. Thayer's collection.    [Illustration 073: Wilson's Petrel. White-billed Petrel.

Family PHAETHONTIDAE    Tropic Birds are Tern-like birds, having all the toes connected by a  web, and having the two central tail feathers very much lengthened.      112. YELLOW-BILLED TROPIC BIRD. _Phaethon americanus._    Range.--Tropical regions, breeding in the Bahamas, West Indies and the  Bermudas, casual in Florida and along the South Atlantic coast.    The Tropic Birds are the most strikingly beautiful of all the sea birds;  they are about 30 inches in length, of which their long slender tail  takes about 20 inches. They fly with the ease and grace of a Tern, but  with quicker wing beats. They feed on small fish, which they capture by  darting down upon, and upon snails which they get from the beach and  ledges. They build their nests in the crevices and along the ledges of  the rocky cliffs. While gregarious to a certain extent they are not  nearly as much so as the Terns. The nest is made of a mass of seaweed  and weeds; but one egg is laid, this being of a creamy or pale purplish  ground color, dotted and sprinkled with chestnut, so thickly as to often  obscure the ground color. Size 2.10 x 1.45. Data.--Coney Is., Bermudas,  May 1, 1901. Nest made of moss and seaweed in a crevice on ledge of  cliff. Collector, A. H. Verrill.    [Illustration 074: Dull purplish.]  [Illustration: Yellow-billed Tropic Bird. Red-billed Tropic Bird.]  [Illustration: deco.]  [Illustration: left hand margin.]    Page 73    113. RED-BILLED TROPIC BIRD. _Phaethon aethereus._    Range.--Tropical seas, chiefly in the Pacific Ocean; north to southern  California.    They breed on several islands in the Gulf of California. This species  differs from the preceding in having a red bill, and the back being  barred with black. Their plumage has a peculiar satiny appearance and is  quite dazzling when viewed in the sunlight. They are strong fliers and  are met with, hundreds of miles from land. They often rest upon the  water, elevating their long tails to keep them from getting wet. They  nest, as do the preceding species, on rocky islands and are said to also  build their nests in trees or upon the ground. The single egg that they  lay has a creamy ground and is minutely dotted with chestnut. Size 2.40  x 1.55. Data.--Daphone Is., Galapagos Is., South Pacific, March 6, 1901.  Egg laid in hole of a sea cliff. The eggs are easily told from those of  the yellow-billed by their much larger size. Collector, R. H. Beck.      113.1 RED-TAILED TROPIC BIRD. _Phaethon rubricaudus._    Range.--Tropical regions of the Pacific and Indian Oceans, accidental  off the coast of Lower California.    This is a singularly beautiful species resembling the latter except that  the central tail feathers are bright red, with the extreme tips white.  During August and September they breed in large colonies on small  islands in the South Seas. On Mauritius Island they build their nests  either in the trees or place them on the ground; the nest is made of  seaweed, sticks and weeds; numbers of them nest on Laysan Is., of the  Hawaiian group, concealing their nests on the ground under overhanging  brush.    The single egg has a pale purplish ground speckled with brown.    [Illustration 075: Pale purplish.]  [Illustration: Pale purplish ground color.]  [Illustration: right hand margin.]    Page 74    GANNETS. Family SULIDAE    Gannets are large stoutly built birds, having the four toes joined by a  web; they have a small naked pouch beneath the bill; the bill is a  little longer than the head, and the tail is quite short. The plumage of  the adults is generally white, that of the young grayish.      114. BLUE-FACED BOOBY. _Sula syanops._    Range.--Widely distributed in the tropical seas, north casually to  Florida and breeding in the Bahamas.    Like the rest of the Gannets, this one is stupid and will often remain  on the nest until removed with the hand, merely hissing at the intruder.  Often they lay their eggs on the bare ground, but sometimes the nest is  lined with seaweed or grass. They lay either one or two eggs early in  April. These eggs are of a dull white color and are heavily covered with  a chalky deposit. Size 2.50 x 1.70. Data.--Clarion Is., Mexico, May 24,  1897. Nest a mere hollow in the sand near the beach. Collector, A. W.  Anthony.      114.1. BLUE-FOOTED BOOBY. _Sula nebouxi._    Range.--Pacific coasts and islands from the Gulf of California southward  to Chili.    These birds nest in numbers on the island of San Pedro Martir in the  Gulf of California. They lay but a single egg, placing it upon the bare  rock. Their breeding season extends from the latter part of March into  May. The egg is a dull white, generally nest stained and is covered with  the usual chalky deposit. Size 2.35 x 1.60. Data.--Clarion Island,  Mexico, May 21, 1897. Two eggs in a hollow in the sand near the beach.  Collector, A. W. Anthony.    [Illustration 076: Blue-faced Booby. Blue-footed Booby.]  [Illustration: deco.]  [Illustration: left hand margin.]    Page 75    115. BOOBY. _Sula leucogastra._    Range.--Tropical coasts and islands of the Atlantic; north casually to  Georgia.    The common Booby is an abundant bird on some of the islands of the  Bahamas and Bermudas; it is commonly called the Brown Booby because the  upper parts are of a brownish gray. These birds, as do the other  Gannets, have great powers of flight and without apparent effort dart  about with the speed of an arrow. They are quite awkward upon their feet  and are not very proficient swimmers. They rarely rest upon the water  except when tired. Hundreds and sometimes thousands of them breed in  company, laying their eggs upon the bare rocks. Sometimes a few sticks  or grasses will be placed about the bird to prevent the eggs from  rolling away. They generally lay two eggs, chalky white and nest  stained. Size 2.40 x 1.60. Data.--Key West, Bahamas, April 14, 1891. No  nest; two eggs laid on the bare rocks.      115.1. BREWSTER'S BOOBY. _Sula brewsteri._    Range.--Pacific coast from Lower California southward. This Gannet  replaces the common Booby on the Pacific coast. It nests abundantly on  many islands in the Gulf of California, and in company with the  blue-footed variety, on San Pedro Martir Island. They generally lay two  eggs, placing them upon the bare rocks and surrounding them with a ring  of sticks and seaweed to keep them in place. The eggs are chalky white  and cannot be distinguished from those of the other Boobies. Data.--San  Benedicto Is., Lower California, May 18, 1897. Single egg laid on the  sand amid a few blades of grass.      116. RED-FOOTED BOOBY. _Sula piscator._    This is another species that is only occasionally taken on the Florida  coast. The habits of the birds and their nesting habits are the same as  those of the others of the family. Two chalky white eggs are laid.  Data.--San Benedicto Is., Lower California, May 18, 1897. Single egg.  Nest a few twigs of rank grass. Collector, A. W. Anthony.    [Illustration 077: Chalky bluish white, nest stained.]  [Illustration: Booby. Red-footed Booby.]  [Illustration: right hand margin.]    Page 76    117. GANNET. _Sula bassana._    Range.--North Atlantic, breeding, in America, only on Bird Rocks in the  St. Lawrence.    These are the largest of the family, being 35 inches in length. They  feed on fish which they catch by diving upon, from the air. When flying  their neck is carried fully extended. They rest on the water when tired,  the numerous air cells beneath the skin, causing them to sit high up in  the water and enabling them to weather the severest storm in perfect  safety. The only known breeding place in America is Bird Rocks, where  they nest by thousands, placing their nests in rows on the narrow  ledges; the nests are made of piles of seaweed, mud and stones. They lay  but one egg of dingy white color and covered with a chalky deposit. On  St. Kilda Island, off the coast of Scotland, they breed by millions.  They are very tame and will frequently allow themselves to be touched  with the hand. It is said that thousands of the young are killed by  fishermen every year and marketed in Edinburg and other places.  Data.--St. Kilda Island, Scotland, June 18, 1896. Single egg laid on a  large mass of seaweed on a sea cliff. Collector, H. McDonald.

Anhingas or Snake Birds are curiously formed creatures with a Heron-like  head and neck, and the body of a Cormorant. They live in colonies in  inaccessible swamps. Owing to their thin and light bodies, they are  remarkable swimmers, and pursue and catch fish under water with ease.  When alarmed they"]]]
