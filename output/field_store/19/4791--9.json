THURSDAY.--BEAN CELERY SALAD. Mix one can of Veribest Pork and Beans,  four tablespoons of celery cut in one eighth inch rings, two tablespoons  of finely chopped onions, and one fourth cup of good boiled dressing.  Marinate thoroughly, but stir slightly. Rub the salad dish with a cut  clove of garlic. Arrange lettuce leaves around the salad bowl and in the  center make a mound of the salad mixture, to which one fourth cup of  whipped cream has been added. Garnish with stuffed olives cut in rings.    FRIDAY.--ATTRACTIVE LUNCHEON DISH. Heat one can of Veribest Pork and  Beans (without tomato sauce), tossing about with fork to prevent  breaking or mashing the beans. Season to taste. Serve in beet shells  which have been previously prepared as follows: Wash the beets  carefully, so as not to break the skins, and boil rapidly until tender.  Then cover with cold water, and with the hands remove the skins. Scoop  out the centers and fill the cases with the beans. Garnish with young  celery leaves.    SATURDAY.--PUREE OF BEANS. To one can of Armour's Veribest Beans and  Tomato Sauce add two cups of milk; boil for a few minutes and pass  through a sieve. Add salt and pepper to taste, a dash of sage, dry  mustard and more water if required. Strain over croutons in the tureen  and sprinkle with chopped parsley.    SUNDAY NIGHT SUPPER.--BEAN LOAF. Two cups of Veribest Pork and Beans,  mashed to a pulp, one fourth cup of chopped nuts, one cup of browned  bread crumbs, two teaspoons of grated onion, two eggs, one half cup of  cream or rich milk, one teaspoon of salt. Mix thoroughly and put into a  greased bread pan. Brush with the beaten yolk of egg, milk or cream and  bake one half hour. Serve with tomato sauce.           *       *       *       *       *    [Illustration: Jessie Tarbox Beals    Utilizing a Chimney Corner for a Book Case]           *       *       *       *       *    Homely Virtues        \"Scorn not the homely virtues.

In a  family where there are several young men and women do I send each a  separate one?_    If economy is no object send each a separate card. If you do not care to  do this and they are brothers and sisters you may say \"The Misses Brown\"  and \"The Messrs. James and John Wilson.\"    _I would like very much to be able to help other housekeepers, but I  always feel that I only know the simple things of my rather humdrum life  in the country._--MRS. D., OHIO.    What you know is not known to everyone, nor is what any housekeeper  knows a matter of everyday use with other housekeepers. Everyone has  some short cut or recipe, or personal way of doing things that would  lighten the way for others. Your recommendation of butterine for  instance, would carry weight with some housekeepers who had never before  thought of trying it and they would be grateful always for being shown  how to cut their butter bill. So with the other suggestions in your good  letter from which I have taken extracts for the other pages. I want just  such letters as yours. We must not forget that the younger generation of  housekeepers are starting housekeeping and scanning columns like these  for \"the things everyone knows.\"    _Yellow and white scheme for coming-out party._--H. M. B.    Many thanks for the nice things you say about the Cook Book. Am very  glad you have enjoyed it so long. The color scheme you mention could be  carried out further by wearing white dresses with yellow sashes and hair  ribbons. Have yellow ices and cakes with white and yellow frosting. Egg  sandwiches, potato salad garnished with hard boiled eggs halved and  yellow flowers, which are quite plentiful now would all help to carry  out the idea.    _What is the seventh anniversary of a wedding called? and is the  celebration of these anniversaries out of style?_--E. G. T., BOISE CITY.    It is perfectly proper to celebrate and you can have a merry time with  little expense. Have tiny woolly toy sheep for favors and serve lamb  salad (made after a chicken salad recipe). Wear a woolen dress and your  husband white flannels.    _I belong to a little card club and have to entertain the other members  one afternoon soon. Can you suggest something which is easily prepared  and can be served as a lap lunch?_--MRS. F. T., HUNTINGTON, W. VA.    Ham mousse in individual moulds with thin bread and butter sandwiches.  Ice cream served in cantaloupe. Iced tea with a slice of lemon and  Armour's Grape Juice, which needs no flavoring.    _What can I put with my silverware when packing it away to keep it from  tarnishing?_--MRS. S.    Pack in bags of Canton flannel before putting into the drawers or boxes  and place with them a few pieces of camphor gum.    _Please tell me if it is proper to eat cake with the fingers or must a  fork be used?_    It depends on the cake. If one with a soft filling, a fork will be  necessary.      Requested Recipes      FOR G. H.    Molasses Custard    Take one cup molasses (ribbon cane is the best; I have never tried corn  syrup), add one half cup sugar, stir well and put on fire to boil for at  least five minutes. Let cool for a short time, than add three  well-beaten eggs, stirring constantly to keep the eggs from curdling.  Add a tablespoonful of cornstarch. Bake in pie crust in the regular way  but slowly. To keep from browning too quickly I sometimes place a tin in  oven over pie.    Many thanks to Mrs. F. A. F., Jacksonville, Texas.      FOR MRS. T. H., OSWEGO, N. Y.    Boiled Bacon    Place the bacon in a saucepan with sufficient cold water to cover it.  Bring the water to the simmering point and simmer gently until done  (time, about half an hour for a pound for large pieces, less for  smaller). Add to the water an onion with two or three cloves stuck in  it, one carrot, one turnip and some sticks of celery. Skim carefully  several times. When done, remove the skin and cover with browned bread  crumbs.      Found Out!    When making shells for custard and lemon pies prick the crust all over  with a fork before baking. Bake the shells over an inverted pie plate,  then place them in pie plate as usual before filling.--Mrs. D. H.,  Media, Pa.    If a cake gets scorched on top when baking, grate lightly with a nutmeg  grater rather than try to scrape it with a knife. You will have a better  surface for frosting.--C. K., Hurley, Texas.    When your tablecloths begin to wear out make napkins out of the best  parts and get a new tablecloth.    Save your old newspapers and when you sweep soak the papers in water in  which a tablespoonful of ammonia has been dissolved. Squeeze out and  throw the paper pulp on the floor you are about to sweep. It will keep  the dust from flying and at the same time brighten the carpets.    Save all soap scraps and put them into an empty baking powder can that  you have turned into a soap shaker by the help of a hammer and nail.  Punch eight or ten small holes in the top and bottom, run a piece of  wire from lid to bottom to hang it up by. When washing dishes shake the  box in the water and you will have a nice suds.    Do not throw away the small pieces of paraffin that you take from the  tops of jelly glasses. They can be melted and used again. If you do not  make jelly, use them to mix with the kindling. They start a fire like  coal oil. Ends of candles may be used in the same way. If the wick in  the lamp is short and you are out of coal oil, fill the lamp with water.  The oil will rise to the top and the wick will burn as long as there is  oil to burn.    Put a tablespoonful of salt in your lamp and the blaze will be twice as  bright.--C. L. E., Dayton.    A damp or slightly oily cloth is all that is necessary to polish oak  furniture if it is in good condition. Marks made by wet glasses should  be rubbed with a mixture of nine parts olive oil and one part  paraffin.--Mrs. W., Stilesboro, Ga.    A very simple, attractive and inexpensive gift may be made by crocheting  a simple edge for bath towels of the silk finished crochet cotton, and  working the monogram or initial in cross stitch, using the same thread.  The washrag should have a tiny edge to match.--Mrs. J. H. M., New  Mexico.    My linen dress had a tear and as it was bought ready made there were no  left over pieces. I drew a few threads from the under hem and darned it  with these and when laundered it could scarcely be seen.--Mrs. J. E. F.          Hints for October      A Hot Drink with the School Lunch    Whether the individual drinking cup is a requirement in all public  schools, or not, its use is a habit which should be encouraged. A  collapsible cup takes up little room in the lunch basket. With it place  one of the Armour Bouillon Cubes. At lunch time this cube dropped into a  cup of hot water provides a drink of bouillon that is refreshing,  stimulating and healthful.    Armour's Bouillon Cubes, chicken and beef flavor, are sold in tins of  12, 50 and 100--each cube wrapped separately in tin foil.      Fruit Out of Season    The tonic value of pure fruit juices makes them desirable all the year  around, and the caloric properties of grape juice place it at the head  of the list. Just now the Armour factories, in the heart of the  grape-growing sections of New York and Michigan, have their presses at  work extracting the pure juice from the season's luscious Concords.

The stalking-horse was, no doubt, the earliest decoy or shield under  which the ancient fowler got near his birds with the crossbow or gun.  It was sometimes a mere framework of wood, covered with painted canvas  to represent a horse or cow, or was a real animal trained to feed and  move in a natural manner in the midst of the fowl. In the first  instance, the fowler carried the framework in front of him, and made  his shot through an opening; in the second case he gently urged the  animal on, hiding behind, and making his shot under the belly, or over  the back. For ancient methods of stalking, see Gervase Markham; for a  modern method, see \"Bustard Shooting in Spain,\" in the Country of Jan.  21, 1875, and current pages of the Field.    Decoying birds by imitating their notes or cries is an art which the  collector must acquire. Many mechanical calls for wood pigeons,  curfews, and other birds are made. One call, which I do not think is  made or used in England, is a Greek idea for decoying thrashes. It is  a whistle formed from two discs of thin silver or silvered copper,  each the size of, or a little smaller than, a \"graceless\" florin, or  say an inch across; those discs are--one fully concave, and the other  slightly convex, both have a hole in the centre and are soldered  together by their edges in the manner shown in Fig. 10. [Footnote:  Since writing this I find there are now sold to boys, for the large  sum of one-halfpenny, whistles formed in tin, of almost similar  construction to those described. I never yet found anyone to make them  \"speak\" properly; boys not knowing how to modulate or inspire the  breath. I have now tried one of them against my silver whistle, and I  cannot say which has the better tone.]    Fig. 10--DECOY WHISTLE FOR THRUSHES, etc.    The concave part is placed in the mouth, pressing against the teeth,  and by inspiring the breath and modulating the tones with the closed  or open hands, as the case may be, a very perfect imitation of the  song-thrush's note is the result. This, the arriving or newly-arrived  birds hear, and, imagining it proceeds from the throat of one of their  species, who, entirely at his ease, is letting the ornithological  world know how excessively overjoyed he is at his safe arrival, alight  in the trees which surround and conceal the treacherous imitator, and  quickly fall a prey to the ready gun. So infatuated are they, that  enormous quantities are killed by this method early in the season; in  fact, I knew one person who shot one hundred and four, besides other  birds, to his own gun in one day.    Quails may be called from a distance if the sportsman hides himself  and imitates with his mouth their peculiar cry, \"More wet, more wet.\"    There are many other birds which come to call in addition to quail.  Woodpigeons and doves will sometimes be attracted to an ambush by  making a soft cooing noise with the mouth and the hollows of both  hands, but the most successful way of procuring both of these birds is  to build a hut with boughs in the hedge of a field to which they  resort, in which hut the shooter hides himself, keeping perfectly  quiet, and not attempting to shoot until the birds have begun feeding,  as woodpigeons, or doves, when they first alight \"have their eyes all  about them,\" the slight rustle even of the gun being brought to the  present, is enough to scare them, and a snap shot at a flying dove is  rarely successful when you are penned and cramped up in a little bough  hut. Pea, tare, and barley fields, when they are first sown in the  spring, and pea and corn fields, after getting in the crops in the  autumn, are their especial haunts, though they do not despise turnip  leaves and acorns.    Salt marshes are also especially favoured by all the pigeon family in  quest of salt, of which they seem to be inordinately fond. Fresh water  rivers in hot weather are also sure spots to find them; and a stuffed  pigeon is a good decoy in some seasons, if placed in front of a place  of concealment.    Perhaps it may be as well to mention that often, while lying in wait  for wild pigeons, you will observe the advent of one or two tame ones,  or even a flock from some neighbouring farmyard, and, as some of these  pigeons are almost certain to closely resemble the wild stock dove  (Columba oenas, 1.), some little discrimination is required to  distinguish the two species.    The Gannet or Solon goose (Sula bassana, Hewitson) is said to be taken  by the strange device of floating a plank out at sea, to which a fish  is attached, in such a manner that, on the bird dashing down on the  half-submerged plank, it strikes itself with such violence as not  unfrequently to break its neck or breastbone. On mentioning this to  Mr. Frederick Ryland, he assured me that he has in some instances  observed the marks of the bird's bill, which had indented the plank--a  pretty conclusive evidence of the extraordinary force of its descent.    Many other birds besides pigeons are attracted by \"stales,\" which was  the ancient name for a representation of the living bird by stuffed  specimens or wooden images; knots and godwits, says Daniel (vol. iii.  p. 214), were attracted into nets by this mode. Gulls and terns I have  often found attracted by a stuffed bird, or, when one can be shot,  should it be left to lie on the water, or propped up on land, as if  alive, the others almost always hover around it. Sheep's lights thrown  on the water is another good decoy for gulls.    Ducks are sometimes attracted by dummies of indiarubber sold at some  of the shops for that purpose, but the best modification of this is  the French \"hut system,\" described at length, in his usual amusing  style, by the once-renowned Col. Hawker.    A more singular way still, of decoying these birds to the gun is by  the American fashion of \"toling,\" a lucid description of which I  append, culled from the pages of Folkard's \"Wildfowler:\"    \"There is one system of fowling practised in America which is as  curious in performance as it is interesting. It is probably one of the  most remarkable methods ever invented, and approaches the nearest to  the system of decoy as practised in England of any of the arts  employed by the people of a foreign country for the capture of  wildfowl. The method alluded to is termed \"toling.\" I am unable to  trace the origin of the term, unless it simply implies a death knell,  for such it assuredly assumes to those birds which approach within  range of the secreted sportsman. This singular proceeding is said to  have been first introduced upwards of fifty years ago near  Havre-de-Grace, in Maryland; and, according to traditional testimony,  the art was accidentally discovered by a sportsman whilst patiently  lying in ambush watching a paddling of wild ducks, which were a little  beyond the range of his gun. Whilst in a state of doubt and anxiety as  to whether they would approach near enough to be shot, he suddenly  observed them raise their heads and swim towards the shore apart from  his ambuscade; and, whilst wondering at the cause of so strange a  proceeding, his attention was directed to a fox which was skipping  about on the shore, and evidently enticing the ducks to approach. This  accidental discovery of so weak a point in the nature of the feathered  tribe led the sportsman to turn it to advantage, and thence arose the  curious art of \"toling.\" To practise it successfully the sportsman  requires simply the services of a dog, which he uses in a similar way  to that of a \"piper,\" employed at an English decoy. [Footnote: The  word \"toling\" may be explained as a corruption of \"tolling,\" i.e.  enticing.]    For the purpose of \"toling,\" the American sportsman erects blinds or  screens on the margin of some lake, the resort of wildfowl; when any  birds are in sight upon the water, he, with his dog, takes up a  position behind the screens, and by throwing small bits of wood or  pebbles up and down the shore, he keeps the dog in active motion so as  to attract the attention of the birds, and induce them to swim towards  the shore within a few yards of the screens, when, if they do, the  sportsman immediately discharges his fowling piece at them, and  sometimes kills large numbers at a shot. The principal things to be  observed are, a strict silence, and to keep the dog constantly in  motion, and all the time in sight of the ducks. The little animal  should be encouraged to skip and bound over the rocks and stones in  front of the screens, and to flourish his tail about with playful  vivacity. He must never bark, for that would alarm the fowl and cause  them to fly away immediately.    Red or chestnut coloured dogs with long bushy tails are best for the  purpose of \"toling\"; the nearer they approach a fox in colour and  appearance the better.\"    Tubs may be sunk on the seashore into which the shooter gets at the  approach of night (or even a \"skip\" or basket may be used to sit on)  to wait till flight time to procure specimens; but having myself sat  in a marsh at night between a river and the sea in Norfolk more than  once for several hours during a very severe winter, I cannot recommend  this as a torrid amusement--indeed, the melancholy \"sough\" of the sea,  and the pale glitter of the stars in the half-frozen pools, whose dead  and dry sedges rustle in unison to the icy blasts rushing from the  dead white north, make even the most hardy long for the old armchair  by the cozy fireside.    A writer in the Zoologist some years ago appeared to think that iodine  was a species of enchanter's wand in rendering your presence unknown  to wildfowl. I have never tried it, having but little faith in cunning  nostrums concocted for the taking of either birds or fish; but as he  is a gentleman of standing and great experience, I will quote his  words from which I drew my inference:    \"A cormorant once perched himself on my back as I lay concealed on a  rock enveloped"]]]
