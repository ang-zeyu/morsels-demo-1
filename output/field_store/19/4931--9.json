The companion of the dead youth, terrified, started  on his return to Seville still seeing his glassy eyes, hearing his  mournful good-bye. He was filled with fear. A gentle cow appearing in  his path would have made him run. He thought of his mother and of the  prudence of her counsel. Would it not be better to dedicate himself to  shoemaking and live tranquilly? But these resolutions only lasted while  he was alone. When he reached Seville he felt the return of  exhilaration. Friends rushed to him to hear about the death of poor  Chiripa in every detail. Professional bull-fighters questioned him in  Campana Street, remembering with pity the little vagabond with the  pock-marked face who had often run errands for them. Juan, fired by such  signs of consideration, gave rein to his powerful imagination,  describing how he had thrown himself upon the bull when he had seen his  poor companion hooked, how he had grabbed the beast by the tail and  achieved even more wonderful feats, in spite of which the other boy had  left this world.    The impulse of fear vanished. Bull-fighter--nothing but a bull-fighter!  Since others were, why should he not be one? He recollected his mother's  spoiled beans and hard bread; the deprivation each pair of new  pantaloons had cost him; the hunger, that inseparable companion of many  of his expeditions. Moreover he had a vehement desire for all the joys  and displays of life; he gazed with envy at the coaches and the horses;  he stood transfixed before the doors of the great houses through whose  iron grilles he saw courtyards of Oriental sumptuousness and arcades of  colored tiles, pavements with marble and chattering fountains casting a  stream of pearls day and night into a basin surrounded by foliage. His  fate was sealed. To kill bulls or die! To be rich, to have the  newspapers talk of him, and to have the people bow to him, even though  it were at the price of his life. He despised the lower grades of the  art. He saw the _banderilleros_ expose their lives equally with the  swordsmen in exchange for thirty _duros_ for each bull-fight; and, after  a round of toil and horn-stabs, become old, with no other future than  some wretched business bought with paltry savings, or else a position at  the slaughter-house. Some died in the hospital; others begged alms from  their youthful companions. He would have nothing to do with  _banderilleros_ nor with spending long years in a _cuadrilla_ in  submission to the despotism of a _maestro_. He would begin with killing  bulls; he would tread the sand of the plazas as a swordsman!    The misfortune of poor Chiripa gave him a certain ascendency over his  companions, and he formed a _cuadrilla_ of ragged youths who marched  behind him to the _capeas_ of the _pueblos_. They respected him because  he was braver and better dressed. Some young girls of the street,  attracted by the manly beauty of the Little Cobbler, who was now in his  eighteenth year, and predisposed by his _coleta_, disputed in noisy  competition the honor of taking care of his comely person. Moreover he  counted on a patron, an old magistrate who had a weakness for the  courage of young bull-fighters and whose friendship infuriated Senora  Angustias and caused her to let loose some most indecent expressions  which she had learned at the Tobacco Factory in her younger days.    The Little Cobbler dressed himself in suits of English cloth well fitted  to the elegance of his figure, and his hat was always resplendent. His  friends took scrupulous care of the whiteness of his collars and  furbelows, and on certain days he proudly wore on his waistcoat a heavy  gold chain, a loan from his respectable friend, that had already figured  around the necks of other \"boys who were starting out.\"    He mingled with broken-down bull-fighters; he could pay for the drinks  of the old _peones_ who recalled the deeds of famous swordsmen. It was  believed for a certainty that some protectors were exerting themselves  in favor of this \"boy,\" awaiting a propitious occasion for him to make  his _debut_ in a fight of young bullocks in the plaza of Seville.    The Little Cobbler was now a _matador_. One day, at Lebrija, when a  lively little young bull came into the plaza, his companions had urged  him on to the greatest luck. \"Dost thou dare to kill him?\" And he killed  him! Henceforward, fired by the ease with which he had escaped danger,  he went to all the _capeas_ in which they announced that a bull was to  be killed, and to all the granges where bulls were to be fought to the  death.    The proprietor of La Rinconada, a rich farmer with a small bull-ring,  was an enthusiast who kept his table set and his hayloft open for all  the hungry who wished to divert him by fighting his cattle. Juan went  there in days of poverty with other companions, to eat and drink to the  health of the rural hidalgo, although it might be at the price of some  rough tumbling. They arrived afoot after a two days' tramp and the  proprietor, seeing the dusty troop with their bundles of capes, said  solemnly:    \"Whoever does the best work, I'll buy him a ticket that he may return to  Seville on the train.\"    Two days the lord of the farm spent smoking on the balcony of his plaza  while the boys from Seville fought young bulls, being frequently caught  and trampled.    He sharply reproved a poorly executed cape-play, and called out, \"Get up  off the ground, you big coward! Come, give him wine to get him over his  fright,\" when a boy persisted in remaining stretched on the ground after  a bull had passed over his body.    The Little Cobbler killed a bull in a manner so much to the liking of  the owner that the latter seated him at his table while his comrades  stayed in the kitchen with the herders and farm laborers, dipping their  horn spoons into the steaming broth.    \"Thou hast earned the return by railroad, my brave youth. Thou wilt  travel far if thou dost not lose heart. Thou hast promise.\"    The Little Cobbler, starting on his return to Seville second class while  the _cuadrilla_ tramped afoot, thought that a new life was beginning for  him, and he cast a look of covetousness at the enormous plantation with  its extensive olive orchards, its fields of grain, its mills, its  meadows stretching out of sight in which were pasturing thousands of  goats, while bulls and cows lay quietly chewing the cud. What wealth! If  only he might some day come to possess something like that!          CHAPTER IV    AT CARMEN'S WINDOW-GRILLE      Gallardo's prowess in fighting young bulls in the _pueblos_, heralded in  Seville, caused the restless and insatiable amateurs, ever seeking a new  luminary to eclipse those already discovered, to fix their attention  upon him.    \"He certainly is a boy of wonderful promise,\" they used to say, on  seeing him pass along Sierpes Street with short step, swinging his arms  arrogantly. \"He must be seen on classic ground.\" This ground for them  and for the Little Cobbler was the ring of the plaza at Seville. The boy  was soon to find himself face to face with the real thing. His protector  had acquired for him a spangled costume, somewhat worn, a cast-off of  some bull-fighter who had failed to win a name. A _corrida_ of young  bulls was arranged for a benefit, and influential devotees, eager for  novelty, managed to include him in the programme gratuitously, as  _matador_.    The son of Senora Angustias declined to appear in the announcements  under his nickname of Little Cobbler, which he desired to forget. He  would have nothing to do with stage names, and less with menial offices.  He wished to be known by the names of his father, he desired to be Juan  Gallardo; no nickname should recall his origin to the great people who  undoubtedly would become his friends of the future.    The whole ward of the Feria flocked _en masse_ to the _corrida_ with a  noisy and patriotic fervor. The dwellers in the ward of Macarena also  showed their interest and the other popular wards allowed themselves to  be carried away with equal enthusiasm. A new _matador_ for Seville!  There was not room for all and thousands were left outside the plaza  anxiously awaiting the news of the _corrida_.    Gallardo fought, killed, was knocked down by a bull without being hurt,  and kept the public in constant anxiety by his daring, which generally  resulted fortunately and provoked colossal bellowings of enthusiasm.  Certain devotees, esteemed for their opinions, smiled complacently. He  had much to learn but he had courage and ambition, which is the  important thing.    \"Above all, he goes in to really kill 'in classic style,' and he keeps  inside the field of reality.\"    At the opposite side of the plaza the old magistrate smiled  compassionately beneath his white beard, admiring the boy's bravery and  the fine appearance he made in the spangled costume. When he saw him  knocked down by the bull he fell back into his seat as if he were going  to faint. That was too much for him.    In one section proudly strutted the husband of Encarnacion, Gallardo's  sister, a leather-worker by trade, a prudent man, an enemy of vagrancy,  who had married the cigarette girl, captured by her charms, but under  the express condition of having nothing to do with her scamp of a  brother.    Gallardo, offended by his brother-in-law's distrust, had never ventured  into his shop, which was situated in the outskirts of Macarena, nor  descended from the ceremonious you when now and then of an afternoon he  met him at his mother's house.    \"I am going to see how that shameless brother of thine dodges the  oranges,\" he had said to his wife as he set out for the plaza.    And now, from his seat, he bowed to the swordsman, calling him Juaniyo,  saying _thou_, playing the peacock,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33830"],[0,"Fur Farming (#12)"],[1,"as outlined,  there is no reason why they cannot be successfully raised hundreds of  miles north of their northern limit. The thing to guard against will be  freezing. The raiser must see that they have good and deep burrows--deep  enough that the ground will never freeze to their nest. They should have  plenty of leaves in their nest. If the enclosure is in a thicket, and  there are trees within and leaves near, the animals will no doubt carry  an abundance of leaves into their dens for nests. If there are no trees  in the enclosure, see that a supply is furnished each den before  freezing weather in the Fall.    The opossum is going to become one of the important animals in  fur-farming for various reasons: They are prolific breeders, bringing  forth from 6 to 12 at a litter; grow rapidly; are easily fed and eat a  great variety of food.    [Illustration: Ideal Spot for an Opossum or Raccoon Fur Farm.]    The opossum raiser has two sources of revenue--fur and carcass. There is  a ready market for the carcasses in all cities. The grower should make  arrangements with butchers and others to take so many carcasses on a  certain date. The fur is at its best from about Thanksgiving to the  middle of February. Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Years are three  holidays when the fur will be prime and the meat in demand. In cities  like New York, Boston, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Pittsburg, Buffalo,  Cleveland, Detroit, Columbus, Cincinnati, Indianapolis, Chicago,  Milwaukee, Omaha, Des Moines, Kansas City, St. Louis, etc., a market can  be had in each for large quantities at each of these holidays, as well  as considerable quantities each week during the winter months. In the  smaller places, from 5000 up, there will be found a demand for the meat,  so that the market for the carcasses as well as fur, is one that will  always be open. Prices at which the carcasses sell will of course vary,  depending to some extent upon the supply of other meats, as well as the  times, etc.    When it is taken into consideration that the litters are large; that  they eat cheap food; their growth is rapid and that the pelt is extra,  does not this animal promise to lead as a money maker over some of the  other and higher priced fur-producers?    In the latitude of West Virginia, the young are born about the middle of  April. In two months, or by June fifteenth, they are about the size of  rats and always \"gaining.\" Six months later, or December fifteenth, if  well fed and cared for, they will weigh from nine to fifteen pounds. By  this it will be seen that at only eight months old--born April fifteenth  and killed December fifteenth--they have attained sizes ranging from  medium to large.    The males should be kept by themselves, at least from the time the young  are born, until they are two months of age or older. The female, with  her large family, should be given plenty of food from the time the young  are a few days old until weaned, as she requires a great deal of food to  satisfy her cravings and to supply the numerous young.    As the severe weather is over by the time the young are born, very good  places for the old can be made in boxes, old logs and the like. These  should be so placed and constructed that food can be given to the female  handily, so as not to disturb her and the young more than necessary.          CHAPTER IX.    MUSKRAT RAISING.      The muskrat is one of our most common fur-bearing animals and is found  in greater numbers than any other animal, notwithstanding its fur is  very popular and is gradually increasing in value.    Muskrats are found throughout the greater part of the United States and  Canada, but for various reasons are more plentiful in certain sections.  Being water animals they are found in greater numbers in marshy places,  on ponds and lakes and sluggish rivers, but also thrive and are found in  fair numbers on the smaller and more rapid streams. They are very  plentiful in Western Canada and especially in the marshy country lying  west of Hudson's Bay. In the salt water marshes of Delaware and Maryland  they are probably found in greater numbers than in any other part of the  world. There, hundreds of the houses of these little creatures may be  seen in every direction.    It is said that the value of the catch from Dorchester County, Md., will  usually run to $20,000 a year and in some seasons reaches almost to  $50,000. The number of animals required to reach such a figure must  necessarily be very large and the number of muskrats found in that  locality may be judged from the fact that the open season for these  animals and the only time of year when they are trapped, is during the  months of January, February and March. They are also very plentiful in  the marshes along the western shore of Lake Erie and about Lake  Champlain. They are not found on parts of the Pacific Coast and portions  of the South and never range south of the State of Arizona.    While there is only one species of the muskrat, naturalists find several  varieties differing mainly in size and color. For instance, there is the  southern muskrat, which is comparatively small and is dull sooty in  color, found in the lower Mississippi Valley and along the coasts of  Mississippi and Alabama; then there is the Dismal Swamp Muskrat of the  Dismal Swamp, Va., which is larger, darker and richer colored than the  common variety and has larger teeth. In Labrador a small and very dark  variety is found.    The muskrat of the Northwest, while of the same variety as those of the  Central and Eastern districts, are small and thin skinned and as a  consequence are less valuable. What causes this difference in size is  not known, but it is supposed to be due either to the presence of alkali  in most of the Northwestern waters or to the scanty and poor quality of  its natural food.    [Illustration: Fur Farm on Open Ground near a Farmhouse.]    The popularity of muskrat fur is on the increase, while large numbers  are exported to foreign countries, it is being more and more used in the  United States and Canada. At present it is much used for lining ladies  coats and its rich appearance when used in this way seems certain to  increase its popularity. It is also dyed and is then known as electric  seal and French seal.    The great demand for the fur during the past two seasons has resulted in  such persistent hunting and trapping that the number of animals in many  sections has decreased visibly and as a consequence the spring catch has  been comparatively light.    Just before this book went to press, considerable inquiry was made about  the supply of raw fur the past season. The general report was that the  catch of Spring Rats in 1909 was perhaps not more than 25% what it was  the year prior. The fall catch of 1908 and the winter catch of 1908-9  was quite heavy.    From this it appears that the high prices of muskrat during the months  of October, November and December, 1908, caused an unusual number of  hunters and trappers to seek these animals. The consequence being that  they were caught off much closer than ever before.    To further bear this out, dealers say that in many of the Central States  where last year they collected 20,000 during March and April, this year  they only secured 4000 or 5000. Trappers say that there are very few  muskrats left in certain localities. This shows that continued trapping  will practically exterminate the muskrat.    Along the Atlantic Coast south from New York for hundreds of miles the  marshes along the coast, bays, rivers and creeks are literally alive  with muskrats. The marsh owners farm out the \"rat catching\" privileges,  usually on the halves. The State of Delaware protects the rats some  eight or nine months each year. There are laws in several other states  protecting these animals. A few states prohibit the destroying of rat  houses at all times.    While hundreds of people follow rat catching along the marshes the  owners and state see that enough are left for breeding and replenishing  the marshes. They get their food from the flags and other weeds largely,  which flourish in these swamps. Fifty acres of \"swamp\" has been known to  furnish 2000 rats or fifty per acre year after year.    In this section black muskrats are not uncommon, the catch some seasons  running as high as 40% black, but as a rule it is lower. What causes  this strange color phase is unknown. Black muskrats are met with  occasionally in other sections but nowhere is the proportion as large as  along the East Coast.    What nature in a way does for the muskrat in the Eastern swamps, fur  raisers can help to accomplish in hundreds of localities throughout  America. There are scores of ponds, small lakes, swamps, etc., in  practically all states where the muskrat is found that can be made to  yield large profits from muskrats. They are easily raised, in fact, will  raise themselves if given \"half a chance.\"    There is no doubt whatever that the fur of this animal will steadily  increase in value. While there will be fluctuations as in the past, we  do not believe that prices will ever go as low as they were some years  ago. Our conclusions in this are based on the fact that the catch is  growing smaller and the popularity of furs for wearing apparel and  especially muskrat fur, is steadily increasing, also the population of  all countries grows larger each year and there is bound to be a steady  demand for furs.    Another thing worthy of consideration is the fact that the flesh of the  muskrat has become a very popular dish in many of the Eastern cities and  there is a market for the carcass of the animal. The trappers of  Maryland and Delaware find ready sale for the flesh.    The muskrats found on the East Coast as well as those found in the  marshes and the shallow lakes and ponds of other parts of the country  are of the house building kind. It should be understood, however, that  the muskrat living"]]]
