[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29246"],[0,"The International Monthly, Volume 3, No. 2, May, 1851 (#12)"],[1,"book (lately published at Berlin) contains some  interesting criticisms of a Tartar poet, whom Bodenstedt knew at Tiflis,  upon European poetry. Our traveller, partly by way of practice in the  Tartar language, and partly to inspire his eastern friend with greater  respect for the bards of the Occident, used to translate English and  German songs into Tartar. Mirza Shaffy, the name of the Tartar sage and  poet, proved himself no contemptible critic of these foreign  productions. Not once could he be induced to tolerate a poem whose only  merit was the beauty and melody of its language in the original, nor to  swallow the mere sentimentalism which plays so great a part in German  poetry especially. This sentimentalism, says Bodenstedt, is as unknown  as it is unintelligible to the Oriental poet. He aims always at a real  and tangible object, and in gaining it puts heaven and earth in motion.  No image is too remote, no thought too lofty for his purpose. The new  moon is a golden shoe for the hoof of his heroes' steed. The stars are  golden nails, with which the Lord has fastened the sky, lest it should  fall with admiration and desire for his fair one. The cypresses and  cedars grow only to recall the lithe and graceful form of Selma. The  weeping willow droops her green hair to the water, grieving because she  is not slender like Selma. The eyes of his beloved are suns which make  all the faithful fire-worshippers. The sun itself is but a gleaming  lyre, whose beams are golden strings, whence the dawn draws the  loveliest accords to the praise of the earth's beauty and the power of  love.    Mirza Shaffy was a great lover of Moore and Byron, and some of their  songs which were translated needed no explanation to render them  intelligible to him. Wolfe's marvellous poem on the death of Sir John  Moore made a deep impression on him, and was a special favorite. Goethe  and Heine he liked greatly, especially Goethe's song of Mignon, \"Knowst  thou the Land,\" and Heine's Fisher's Song (which Schubert has set to  such delicious and befitting music) which ends--        \"My heart is like the ocean,        Has storm, and ebb, and flow,      And many a lovely pearlet        Rests in its depths below.\"    Schiller he could not so well understand, and often the attempt  adequately to translate this poet had to be given up in despair.  However, Mirza Shaffy admitted that some of his poems had substance in  them. Uhland and Geibel were not much to his mind. One day, Bodenstedt  translated into Tartar a song by the latter, which we in our turn thus  render into English:        The silent water lily        Springs from the earth below,      The leaves all greenly glitter,        The cup is white as snow.        The moon her golden radiance        Pours from the heavens down,      Pours all her beams of glory        This virgin flower to crown.        And, in the azure water,        A swan of dazzling white      Floats longing round the lily,        That trances all his sight.        Ah low he sings, ah sadly,        Fainting with sweetest pain;      O lily, snow white lily,        Hear'st thou the dying strain?    Mirza Shaffy cast the song aside, with the words, \"A foolish swan!\"    \"Don't the song please you?\" asked the translator.    \"The conclusion is foolish,\" replied the Tartar; \"what does the swan  gain by fainting?--he only suffers himself, and does no good to the  rose. I would have ended--        \"Then in his beak he takes it,        And bears it with him home.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Mr. Ross, the editor of _Allgemeine Auswanderungszeitung_ (Universal  Journal of Emigration), an excellent and useful German periodical, has  just published in Germany the _Auswanderer's Handbuch_ (Emigrant's  Manual), devoted especially to the service of those who design  emigrating to the United States. His manual is a valuable collection of  whatever a new comer into this country should know. The constitution and  political arrangements of the Union, its legislation, its means of  intercourse, the peculiarities of soil and climate proper to different  sections, the state of agriculture, and the chances of employment for  persons of different classes, professions, and degrees of education, are  all given. Mr. Ross was himself born in the United States, and  understands what he writes about. At the same time his book gives a fair  and thorough view of the difficulties with which the emigrant to this  country must contend.           *       *       *       *       *    At Pesth, Hungary, is about to appear a biographical work on Hungarian  statesmen and orators who were prominent before the revolutionary  period. Paul Nagy, Eugen Beoethy, Franz Deak, Stephan Bezeredy,  Bartholomaus Szemere, the two Wesselenyis, the two Dionys Pazmandys,  Stephan Szechenyi, and Joseph Eoetvos (the last known in the United  States by translations of his novels), are among the characters  described.           *       *       *       *       *    A new book on the new world is the _Europa ed America_, by Dr. ANT.  CACCIA, an Italian litterateur, who has apparently been in this country  and describes it, as he professes to do, from nature. He says that he  found the people of New-York occupied mainly in making money.    The German authoress FANNY LEWALD, has in press a book entitled _England  und Schottland_ (England and Scotland), made up from the notes of a  journey through those countries. Its publication just at this moment is  for the benefit of the crowds of Germans who are going to the World's  Fair, and who may find in it all sorts of preparatory information. A  specimen chapter published in one of our German papers reads pleasantly.  Fanny Lewald is a phenomenon, of a class of women who know something  about every thing. Nothing is too high or too low to become an object of  consideration to these female Teufelsdroecks, petticoated professors of  \"the science of things in general.\" The intellectual cultivation among  the middle and higher class of society in Prussia, the patronage  bestowed by the court upon learning, the arts, and sciences; the  encouragement to discuss freely every imaginable theme in politics or  religion, with the single exception of the measures of the  administration, all tended to create a taste for mental display in which  it was necessary that women should participate, if they wished to retain  their old position in the social world. In the salons of Berlin,  therefore, women have been heard taking a prominent part in  conversations in which the most abstruse questions in religion,  politics, and general science were discussed. The philosophers, male and  female, debarred by the spy system from any open investigation of  passing political events, revenged themselves by treating these events  as mere temporary phases of the great system of evolutions which forms  the _material_ of history, scarcely worthy of notice, and directed their  attention to the great principles which underlie all great social and  religious developments. A strange tone was thus given to conversation.  Listening to the talkers at a Berlin conversazione, one might have  fancied, judging from the nature of the subjects of conversation, that a  number of gods and goddesses were debating on the construction of a  world. Vulgar bricks and mortar they ignored, and were anxious only  about primary and secondary geological formations. The actual state of  any society was scarcely cared for, except in illustration of a  principle, and the great forces which must unite to form the best  possible society, were the only subjects of investigation. It may be  taken as a great proof of the wonderful facility of adaptation of the  female mind, that women joined in these conversations as readily as men,  and frequently with far more brilliancy, in spite of the range of  reading which it must require to obtain even a superficial knowledge of  the subjects of discourse. Fanny Lewald is one of these prodigies. She  has studied every thing from the Hegelian philosophy downwards. She is  as great in revolutions as in ribbons, and is as amusing when talking  sentiment over oysters and Rheinwein, in the Rathskiller at Bremen, as  when meditating upon ancient art and philosophy in Wilhelm von  Humboldt's castle of Tegel near Berlin.           *       *       *       *       *    We have read with great interest a series of articles which have  appeared in the recent numbers of the _Grenzboten_ upon GEORGE SAND.  Though we have often failed to agree with the view of the writer, Mr.  Julian Schmidt, one of the editors of that paper, we have rarely met  with literary criticism of more ability, and a more just and catholic  spirit. We translate the conclusion of the last article, in which Mr.  Schmidt gives the result of his careful analysis of all the works of the  author: \"The novel, on account of its lax and variable form, and the  caprice which it tolerates, is in my opinion not to be reckoned among  those kinds of art, which, as classic, will endure to posterity. The  authors who have been most read in modern times have already been  checked in their popularity by the greater attraction of novelty offered  by their successors. This is the case even with Walter Scott. Besides,  in most of her writings, George Sand has dealt with problems whose  justification later times will not understand; and thus it may happen  that hereafter she will be regarded as of consequence in the history of  literature alone. But in that sphere she will have a permanent  importance. Future centuries will regard her as the most significant  image of the morbid but intense striving which marks this generation.  When it has long been agreed that the lauded works of Victor Hugo,  Eugene Sue, Lamartine, Alfred de Musset, and others, are but the barren  outgrowths of an untamed and unrestrained fancy, and a perverted  reflection; when the same verdict has been pronounced"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29270"],[0,"The Story of the Great War, Volume 2 (#12)"],[1,"crossed the Meuse,  rode through Charleroi, and trotted on toward the Sambre. At first they  were mistaken for a British cavalry patrol. Probably the populace in  Charleroi were not sufficiently familiar at that time with the British  hussar uniform to distinguish it from the German. In all armies hussar  uniforms bear a close resemblance. A French officer, however, presently  detected the situation. After a skirmish the German hussars were driven  off with the loss of a few killed and wounded. But the raid evidently  came out of the gap as a surprise to the French. The citizens were  promptly ordered to their homes. Barricades were raised in the streets,  and mitrailleuses were placed in sweeping positions. An artillery  engagement began at Jemappe, nine miles above Namur on the left bank of  the Sambre, between Von Buelow's vanguard and the main French right.  Later in the day Von Buelow's vanguard artillery had advanced to open  fire on Charleroi and Thuin, seven miles beyond.    On Saturday, August 22, 1914, Von Buelow attacked Charleroi in full  strength. As we have seen, he had already practically settled with  Namur. Their main assault on Saturday was delivered on the Sambre  bridges at Chatelet and Thuin, below and above Charleroi, respectively.  Sometime on Saturday they succeeded in crossing to turn Charleroi into  one of the most frightful street battle grounds in history. The conflict  raged for the possession of iron foundries, glass works, and other  factories. The thoroughfares were swept by storms of machine-gun fire.  Tall chimneys toppled over and crashed to the ground, burying defenders  grouped near under piles of debris. Desperate hand-to-hand encounters  took place in workshops, electric-power stations, and manufacturing  plants. The normal whir of machinery, now silent, was succeeded by the  crack and spitting of continuous rifle fire.    The French-Turco and Zouave troops fought with savage ferocity, with  gleaming eyes, using bayonets and knives to contest alleys and  passageways. House doors were battered in to reach those firing from  upper windows. Roofs and yard walls were scaled in chase of fleeing  parties. The Germans were driven out of Charleroi several times, only to  return in stronger force. Similarly with the French. With each change  of victors, the losing side turned to bombard with a torrent of  artillery shells the war-engulfed city.    At nightfall on August 22, 1914, Charleroi burst into flames. A dread  and significant glow fell upon the sky. Absent were the usual  intermittent flare of blast furnaces. The greater part of Charleroi had  become a heap of ruins. Those of its citizens still alive cowered in  holes or corners for shelter.    The battle of Charleroi went on throughout the night. Early on the  morning of Sunday, August 23, 1914, Von Hausen swept down through the  gap between the armies of Von Buelow and the Duke of Wuerttemberg. He  crossed the Meuse, drove from before him the French detachments watching  it, and advanced to attack the rear of the French right.    Von Hausen took the French at Charleroi completely by surprise. At the  moment they could comprehend neither where he came from nor the measure  of his strength. But he was in army force.    The French were compelled to withdraw their right from Charleroi. Von  Hausen seized the advantage to hurl his forces upon their rear, while  Von Buelow thundered in assault more vigorously than ever on the French  front. A powerful force was hurled upon them from an unexpected  direction. Presently the retreat of the French Fifth Army was threatened  by the two Saxon corps of Von Hausen's army, pressing on the French  right flank and rear. In this emergency the retirement of the French  Fifth Army appears to have been undertaken with spontaneous realization  of utmost danger. It gave way before the attacks of Von Buelow and Von  Hausen to move southward, leaving their British left wing without  information of defeat.          CHAPTER IX    BATTLE OF MONS      On Friday, August 21, 1914, the British force began to take position on  the French left, forming the line Binche-Mons-Conde. When finally  concentrated it comprised the First and Second Army Corps, and General  Allenby's cavalry division. The regiments forming the cavalry division  were the Second Dragoon Guards, Ninth Lancers, Fourth Hussars, Sixth  Dragoon Guards, with a contingent of the Household Guards. The First  Army Corps was given the right of the line from Binche to Mons. It was  commanded by Sir Douglas Haig. He was a cavalry officer like the  commander in chief, and a comparatively young man for such a  responsibility, but had seen active service with credit. His corps was  comprised of six guards' battalions. The First Black Watch, Second  Munster Fusiliers, The Royal Sussex, North Lancashire, Northamptons,  Second King's Royal Rifles, Third West Surreys, The South Wales  Borderers, Gloucesters, First Welsh Regiment, Highland Light Infantry,  Connaught Rangers, Liverpools, South Staffords, Berkshires, and First  King's Royal Rifles. The First Irish Guards went into action for the  first time in its history.    The second corps extended from Mons to Conde, commanded by Sir Horace  Smith-Dorrien. General Dorrien was a west of England man, and turning  fifty-six. He had seen active service in the Zulu War, Egypt, Sudan, the  Chitral Relief Force, and Tirah campaign. He had occupied the positions  of adjutant general in India, commander of the Quetta division, and  commander in chief at Aldershot. He was recognized as a serious military  student, and possessing the approval and confidence of Lord Kitchener.  The Second Corps was composed of Royal Irish Rifles, Wiltshires, South  Lancashires, Worcesters, Gordons, Royal Scots, Royal Irish, Middlesex,  Royal Fusiliers, Northumberland Fusiliers, Royal Scots Fusiliers,  Lincolns, Yorkshire Light Infantry, West Kent, West Riding, Scottish  Borderers, Manchesters, Cornwalls, East Surreys, and Suffolks. To the  rear Count Gleichen commanded the Norfolks, Bedfords, Cheshires, and  Dorsets. On the left of the Second Corps was stationed General Allenby's  cavalry.    In passing we may note that the commander in chief of the British forces  was a cavalry officer, the commander of the First Army Corps a cavalry  officer, and that the cavalry was in comparatively ample force. Von  Mackensen of the German force came from that branch of the service.  Cavalry officers are excellent soldiers, but their training as such is  not promising for the command of modern armies, mainly of infantry and  artillery, with other complements. In war much has changed since  Waterloo, with the value of cavalry retreating into the background as  aeroplanes sweep to the front for scouting and other purposes.    From Binche to Conde the line assigned to the British was approximately  twenty-five miles. Their force totaled some 75,000 men with 259 guns.  General French, therefore, had 2,500 men to the mile of front. This was  an insufficient force, as the usual fighting front for a battalion of a  thousand men in defense or in attack is estimated in all armies at about  425 yards. The British brigade of four battalions (4,000 rifles) covers  a half-mile front. General French's Third Army Corps having been  utilized elsewhere, he was compelled to use his cavalry in four brigades  as reserve.    Previous to the German attack on Charleroi, General Joffre still held to  his plan of a left-wing attack, or rather a counterattack after the  Germans were beaten. But battles were commencing on other fronts,  properly belonging to the general retreat, which made its execution  doubtful even in an hour of victory. The capture of Charleroi, of  course, dissipated it as a dream. That General French realized the  superiority in numbers of Von Kluck's advancing army both in infantry  and artillery is nowhere suggested. His airmen had merely brought in the  information that the attack would be in \"considerable force.\" The French  Intelligence Service were led to believe and informed the British  commander that Von Kluck was advancing upon him with only one corps, or  two at the most. Some of General French's cavalry scouting as far  toward Brussels as Soignes, during the 21st and 22d, confirmed it. But  the British proceeded to prepare for attack immediately on taking  position. They set to work digging trenches.    While continuing their defensive efforts through Saturday, August 22,  1914, there floated to them a distant rumble from the eastward. Opinions  differed as to whether it was the German guns bombarding Namur, or a  battle in progress on the Sambre. For the most part British officers and  men had but a vague idea of their position, or the progress of the  fighting in the vicinity. Even the headquarters staff remained  uninformed of the desperate situation developing on the French right at  Charleroi.    The headquarters of the British army was at Mons. It lies within what is  known as \"le Borinage,\" that is the boring district of Belgium, the  coal-mining region. In certain physical aspects it much resembles the  same territory of Pennsylvania. Containing one or two larger towns such  as Charleroi and Mons, it is sprinkled over with villages gathered near  the coal pits. Everywhere trolley lines are to be seen running from the  mines to supply the main railways and barge canals.    Formerly the people were of a rough, ignorant and poverty toiling type,  but of late years have greatly improved with the introduction of  organized labor and education. Previous bad conditions, however, have  left their mark in a stunted and physically degenerate type of  descendants from the mining population of those times. In contrast to  later comers they resemble a race of dwarfs. The men seldom exceed four  feet eight inches in height, the women and children appear bloodless and  emaciated.    The output of the Borinage coal field exceeds twenty"]]]
