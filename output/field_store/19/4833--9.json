More than once he sat on  a branch of a tree and watched a buck or doe go by, and his claws  twitched and his eyes blazed, and he fairly trembled with eagerness and  excitement as he saw the big gray creature pass, all unconscious,  beneath his perch. Splendidly armed as he was, it would seem as though  he must have succeeded if only he had jumped and risked a tussle. But he  never tried it. I suppose he was afraid. And yet--such were the  contradictions of his nature--one dark night he trotted half a mile  after a shanty-boy who was going home with a haunch of venison over his  shoulder, and was just gathering himself for a spring, intending to leap  on him from behind, when another man appeared. Two against one was not  fair, he thought, and he gave it up and beat a retreat without either of  them seeing him. They found his footprints the next morning in their  snow-shoe tracks, and wondered how far behind them he had been. I don't  know whether it was a vein of real courage that nerved him up to doing  such a foolhardy thing as to follow a man with the intention of  attacking him, or whether it was simply a case of recklessness. The  probability is, however, that he was hungrier than usual, and that the  smell of the warm blood made him forget everything else. Anyhow, he had  a pretty close call, for the shanty-boy had a revolver in his pocket.    Aside from any question of heroism, I am afraid that he was not really  as wise and discriminating as he looked. I have an idea that when Nature  manufactured him she thought he did not need as much wisdom or as many  wits as some of the other people of the woods, inasmuch as he was larger  and stronger and better armed than most of them. Except possibly the  bear, who was altogether too easy-going to molest him, there was not  one of the animals that could thrash him, and they all knew it and let  him alone. You can often manage very well without brains if only you  have the necessary teeth and muscle and claws; and the old lynx had  them, without a doubt. But I fear that Nature, in adapting a wild animal  to his environment, now and then forgets to allow for the human element  in the problem. Brains are a good thing to have, after all. Even to a  lynx the time is pretty sure to come, sooner or later, when he needs  them in his business. Your fellow-citizens of the woods may treat you  with all due respect, but the trapper won't, and he'll get you if you  don't watch out.    One day he found some more snow-shoe tracks, just like those that the  shanty-boy had left, and instead of running away, as he ought to have  done, and as most of the animals would have had sense enough to do, he  followed them up to see where they led. He wasn't particularly hungry  that day, and there was absolutely no excuse for what he did. It  certainly wasn't bravery that inspired him, for he had not the least  idea of attacking anyone. It was simply a case of foolish curiosity. He  followed the trail a long way, not walking directly in it, but keeping  just a little to one side, wallowing heavily as he went, for a foot and  a half of light, fluffy snow had fallen the day before, and the walking  was very bad. Presently he caught sight of a little piece of scarlet  cloth fastened to a stick that stood upright in a drift. It ought to  have been another warning to him, but it only roused his curiosity to a  still higher pitch, as the trapper knew it would. He sat down in the  snow and considered. The thing didn't really look as if it were good to  eat, and yet it might be. The only way to find out would be to go up to  it and taste it. But, eatable or not, such a bright bit of color was  certainly very attractive to the eye. You would think so yourself if you  hadn't seen anything scarlet since last summer's wild-flowers faded.  Finally, he got up and walked slowly toward it, and the first thing he  knew a steel trap had him by the right foreleg.    The way of the foolish is sometimes as hard as that of the transgressor.  For a few minutes he was the very maddest cat in all the Great  Tahquamenon Swamp, and he yelled and howled and caterwauled at the top  of his voice, and jumped and tore around as if he was crazy. But, of  course, that sort of thing did him no good, and after a while he quieted  down and took things a little more calmly. Instead of being made fast  to a tree, the trap was bound by a short chain to a heavy wooden clog,  and he found that by pulling with all his might he could drag it at a  snail's pace through the snow. So off he went on three legs, hauling the  trap and clog by the fourth, with the blood oozing out around the steel  jaws and leaving a line of bright crimson stains behind him. The strain  on his foot hurt him cruelly, but a great fear was in his heart, and he  knew that he must go away or die. So he pushed on, hour after hour,  stopping now and then to rest for a few minutes in a thicket of cedar or  hemlock, but soon gathering his strength for another effort. How he  growled and snarled with rage and pain, and how his great eyes flamed as  he looked ahead to see what was before him, or back along his trail to  know if the trapper was coming!    It was a terrible journey that he made that night, and the hours dragged  by slow as his pace and heavy as his clog. He was heading toward the  hollow tree by the Glimmerglass that he and his mate called home, but he  had not made more than half the distance, and his strength was nearly  gone. Half-way between midnight and dawn he reached the edge of a steep  and narrow gully that lay straight across his path. The moon had risen  some time before, and the white slopes gleamed and shone in the frosty  light, all the whiter by contrast with the few bushes and trees that  were scattered up and down the little valley. The lynx stood on the  brink and studied the proposition before him. It would be hard, hard  work to climb the farther side, dragging that heavy clog, but at least  it ought to be easy going down. He scrambled over the edge, hauling the  clog after him till it began to roll of its own accord. The chain  slackened, and he leaped forward. It was good to be able to jump again.  But he jumped too far, or tried to, and the chain tightened with a jerk  that brought him down head-first in the snow. Before he could recover  himself the clog shot past him, and the chain jerked again and sent him  heels over head. And then cat, trap, and clog all went rolling over and  over down the slope, and landed in a heap at the bottom. All the breath  and the spirit were knocked out of him, and for a long time he could do  nothing but lie still in the snow, trembling with weakness and pain, and  moaning miserably. It must have been half an hour before he could pull  himself together again, and then, just as he was about to begin the  climb up the far side of the gully, he suddenly discovered that he was  no longer alone. Off to the left, among some thick bushes, he saw the  lurking form of a timber-wolf. He looked to the right, and there was  another. Behind him was a third, and he thought he saw several others  still farther away, slinking from bush to bush, and gradually drawing  nearer. Ordinarily they would hardly have dreamed of tackling him, and,  if they had mustered up sufficient courage to attempt to overpower him  by mere force of numbers, he would simply have climbed a tree and  laughed at them. But now it was different.    The lynx cowered down in the snow and seemed to shrink to half his  normal size; and then, as all the horror and the hopelessness of it came  over him, he lifted up his voice in such a cry of abject fear, such a  wail of utter agony and despair, as even the Great Tahquamenon Swamp had  very seldom heard. I suppose that he had killed and eaten hundreds of  smaller animals in his time, but I doubt if any of his victims ever  suffered as he did. Most of them were taken unawares, and were killed  and eaten almost before they knew what was coming; but he had to lie  still and see his enemies slowly closing in upon him, knowing all the  time that he could not fight to any advantage, and that to fly was  utterly impossible. But when the last moment arrived he must have braced  up and given a good account of himself. At least that was what the  trapper decided when he came a few hours later to look for his trap. The  lynx was gone--not even a broken bone of him was left--but there in the  trodden and blood-stained snow was the record of an awful struggle.  There must have been something heroic about him, after all.    For the rest of the winter his widow had to hunt alone. This was not  such a great hardship in itself, for they had frequently gone out  separately on their marauding expeditions--more often, perhaps, than  they had gone together. But now there was never anyone to curl up beside  her in the hollow tree and help her keep warm, or to share his kill with  her when her own was unsuccessful. And when the spring should come and  bring her a family of kittens, she would have to take on her own  shoulders the whole burden of parental responsibility. Or, rather, the  burden was already there, for if she did not find enough meat to keep  herself in good health the babies would be weak and wizened and  unpromising, with small chance of growing up to be a credit to her or a  satisfaction to themselves. So she hunted night and day, and, on the  whole, with very good results. To tell the truth, I think she was rather  more skilful in the chase than her mate had been, and this seems to be a  not uncommon state of things in cat families. Perhaps feminine fineness  of instinct and lightness of tread are better adapted to the still-hunt  than the greater clumsiness and awkwardness "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27975"],[0,"Delineations of the Ox Tribe: The Natural History of Bulls, Bisons, and (#12)"],[1,"very rarely, that they are not worth taking  into the account; consequently, external forms, and in some cases even  colours, become of importance in ascertaining specific distinction.          THE JUNGLY GAU.    _Bos Sylhetanus._ (Cuv.)    [Illustration]    Further information is requisite to decide the specific character of  this animal. According to the opinion of Col. Smith, (see 'Synopsis of  the Species of Mammalia' in Griffith's Translation of Cuvier's Animal  Kingdom,) it is a mere variety of the Gayal (_Bos Gavaeus_); and Mr. J.  E. Gray, in his 'List of the Specimens of Mammalia in the Collection of  the British Museum,' classes it as a domestic variety of the same  animal, but Mr. Fred. Cuvier regards it as an entirely new species.    The following account of the Jungly Gau (which is the only one that has  been published), is a translation from the splendid folio work of  Messrs. St. Hilaire and F. Cuvier.    This species of Ox, which is entirely new, appears to be the most  nearly allied to our domestic cattle. Those ruminants which are classed  under the generic name of Ox, may be very naturally divided into two  distinct groups. The first includes the Buffaloes, animals in some  measure aquatic, living in low, swampy localities, or near rivers, in  which they remain half immersed a great part of the day; having  broad-based horns, partly spreading over their foreheads, flat on their  internal side, and round on their external; tongue soft, &c. The second  is that of the Ox, properly so called. These are distinguished from the  first by their dwelling on more elevated lands, or in the vicinity of  forests; having smooth round horns, without enlargement at their base;  tongue covered with horny papillae, &c.    It is to this second family, consisting of the American Bison, the  Aurox, the Yak, and the domestic Ox, with its varieties, that the Jungly  Gau undoubtedly belongs. It however differs from the first two in being  entirely destitute of the thick shaggy mane; and, instead of the long  silky hair of the third, it is clothed with close, short hair, equal in  uniformity of texture to the sleekest of our domestic cattle. To judge  from its general appearance, we might be even tempted to take it for a  mere variety of the domestic species, so close is the resemblance. But  the information furnished by M. Alfred Duvaucel, in the only description  which has been given, leaves no doubt as to its being a new species.    The following is M. Duvaucel's account:--\"The horns of the Jungly Gau  rise from the sides of the occiput, first outward, then forward, with a  slight inclination backward of the upper extremity, forming a double  lunation, and separated by a space which gradually diminishes as the  animal grows older; standing equally apart in every individual of the  same age and sex; are round, except at their base, which is slightly  compressed; and they become smoother as the animal advances in age.    \"The hump, which is characteristic of the generality of Indian oxen, is  reduced in this to a slight prominence, extending to the middle of the  back, and is covered with a grayish, woolly hair, rather longer than  that on the other parts of the body, which spreads likewise over the  occiput and the front. The rest of the hair is black except the legs,  which are white from the knees downwards. The tail terminates in a large  tuft of hair; and, in bulls of two or three years old, the under part of  the neck is slightly furnished with long, black, silky hair.    \"The female is smaller than the male, with horns of a still less  proportionate size. The front of the head, instead of being convex, as  in the male, appears to be slightly depressed, in consequence of the  superior elevation of the muzzle. The colour of the female is not so  deep a black; the gray on the top of the neck and the shoulders extends  to the sides, and the inferior part of the muzzle is white.    \"I have long entertained the opinion,\" continues M. Duvaucel, \"that  these oxen were essentially the same as the domestic--that they were  both varieties of the same species; but this opinion was formed on the  inspection only of such specimens as I had seen in the menagerie at  Barracpour. Since that time, I have pursued them myself near the  mountains of Sylhet; and I have likewise learned from various sources  that they are as numerous and as generally diffused as the common  Buffalo; but they appear to be wilder than the Buffalo, and not so  bold, never approaching where man has established his dominion.  Nevertheless, when caught, they are easily subdued, and become quite  domesticated in a few months. The milk of this species is said to be  more abundant and nourishing than that of any other.\"    From all that is at present known respecting this animal, it is regarded  by M. F. Cuvier as a new species added to the genus _Bos_; and, from the  circumstance of its having been first seen in a wild state near the  mountains of Sylhet, he has given it the specific name of _Sylhetanus_.    The animal represented in the following vignette is the Syrian Ox, which  is considered as a variety of _Bos Taurus_.    [Illustration]          THE BUFFALO.      The animal generally known under the name of the _Common_ Buffalo is  evidently a different species from the _Cape_ Buffalo. Much confusion,  however, prevails in the accounts, both of travellers and naturalists,  on the subject of these two animals. Descriptions of the one are mingled  with descriptions of the other, and anecdotes are related of the one  which, there is good reason for believing, ought to be referred to the  other. It is highly probable that future and more accurate observations  will show that more than one species has been confounded under the  general epithets of \"the common Buffalo,\" \"the domestic Buffalo,\" \"the  tame Buffalo,\" or, more indeterminate still, \"_the_ Buffalo.\"    The accounts furnished by travellers of the various animals in Asia and  Africa, described by them as Buffaloes, are altogether vague and  unsatisfactory, and frequently erroneous; not from any desire on the  part of the authors to deceive, but merely because their observations  have been made in the most careless and indifferent manner; and, in many  instances, their information is obtained from the verbal communications  of ignorant natives.    In those descriptions which are confined to the Buffalo, as it at  present exists in Italy and the south of Europe, tolerable reliance may  be placed, as their character and habits are there well known, being of  every day observation; yet, even in this case, little or nothing is  known of the anatomy of the animal, and its period of gestation has  never been precisely stated. The following information on this latter  point is given in Griffith's 'Cuvier,' (vol. iv, p. 383,) \"Gestation _is  said_ to last twelve months, but _it appears_ not to exceed ten.\"          THE ITALIAN BUFFALO.    _Bos Bubalus._      [Illustration]    This animal is more bulky than the domestic Ox, and its limbs are  stouter. The head is larger, in proportion to the size of the body, than  that of the domestic Ox, and is generally carried with the muzzle  projecting; the forehead is rather convex, and higher than broad; the  horns are large, slightly compressed, and recline towards the neck, with  the points turned up; dewlap of a moderate size.    Throughout the whole range of the Italian peninsula Buffaloes are used  as beasts of burden, and their immense strength renders their services  invaluable in the marshy and swampy districts, where the services of  horses, or ordinary oxen, would be totally unavailing. The roads through  which they are obliged to pass are frequently covered to a depth of two  or three feet, through which they work their way with wonderful  perseverance.    On the great plain of Apulia the Buffalo is the ordinary beast of  draught; and at the annual fair held at Foggia, at the end of May,  immense droves of almost wild Buffaloes are brought to the town for  sale. Fearful accidents occasionally happen; enraged animals breaking  from the dense mass, in spite of all the exertions of their drovers, and  rushing upon some object of their vengeance, whom they strike down, and  trample to death. It is dangerous to overwork or irritate the Buffalo,  and instances have been known in which, when released by the brutal  driver from the cart, they have instantly turned upon the man and killed  him on the spot.    The following part of their history is remarkable: They appear to be  most numerous, and to thrive best in those districts which are most  infected with malaria. In the Pontine marshes they find a favorite  retreat, and in the pestilential Maremma scarcely any other animals are  to be seen. In the northern portions of Italy, where malaria is much  less frequent than in the south. Buffaloes are to be found in the  greatest numbers precisely in those localities where malaria is the most  prevalent.    They are particularly fond of the long rank herbage, which springs up in  moist and undrained lands. In their habits they are almost amphibious,  lying for hours half submerged in water and mud.    When travellers make use of the name \"common Buffalo,\" they are usually  understood to mean an animal identical with the Italian species; if this  really be the case, its geographical range must be very extensive. It is  said to inhabit the extensive regions of Hindostan, China, Cochin-China,  Malabar, Coromandel, Persia, and the Crimea; also Abyssinia, Egypt, and  the south of Europe; to which may be added, most of the large islands in  the Indian Sea.    As an article of food, the flesh of this animal is inferior to the beef  of the domestic Ox, but the milk of the female is particularly rich and  abundant; the semi-fluid butter, called _ghee_ in India, is made from  it.
