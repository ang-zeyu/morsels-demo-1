It was no difficult task to study the birds on the plain. Having few  hiding-places in a locality almost destitute of trees and bushes, where  even the grass was too short to afford a covert, they naturally felt  little fear of man, and hence were easily approached. Their cousins  residing in the mountains were, as a rule, provokingly wary. The number  of birds that had pre-empted homesteads on the treeless wastes was  indeed a gratifying surprise, and I went back to the mountains refreshed  by the pleasant change my brief excursion upon the plains had afforded  me.    [Illustration: _Coyotte_    \"_Looking back to see whether he were being pursued_\"]          A PRETTY HUMMER    [Illustration]      Where do you suppose I got my first glimpse of the mite in feathers  called the broad-tailed humming-bird? It was in a green bower in the  Rocky Mountains in plain sight of the towering summit of Pike's Peak,  which seemed almost to be standing guard over the place. Two brawling  mountain brooks met here, and, joining their forces, went with increased  speed and gurgle down the glades and gorges. As they sped through this  ravine, they slightly overflowed their banks, making a boggy area of  about an acre as green as green could be; and here amid the grass and  bushes a number of birds found a pleasant summer home, among them the  dainty hummer.    From the snow-drifts, still to be seen in the sheltered gorges of Pike's  Peak, the breezes would frequently blow down into the nook with a  freshness that stimulated like wine with no danger of intoxicating; and  it was no wonder that the white-crowned sparrows, Lincoln's sparrows,  the robins and wrens, and several other species, found in this spot a  pleasant place to live. One of the narrow valleys led directly up to the  base of the massive cone of the Peak, its stream fed by the snow-fields  shining in the sun. Going around by the valley of Seven Lakes, I had  walked down from the summit, but nowhere had I seen the tiny hummer  until I reached the green nook just described. Still, he sometimes  ascends to an elevation of eleven thousand feet above the level of the  sea.    _ONE OF THE SEVEN LAKES_    _PIKE'S PEAK shows dimly in the background, more plainly in the  reflection. Viewed from the peak, the lakes sparkle like opaline gems in  the sun. The waters are so clear that an inverted world is seen in their  transparent depths. The valley is an elysium for many kinds of birds,  most of them described in the text. The white-crowned sparrows love the  shores of these beautiful lakes, which mirror the blithe forms of the  birds. The pine forests of the mountain sides are vocal with the  refrains of the hermit thrushes._    [Illustration]    Our feathered dot is gorgeous with his metallic green upper parts,  bordered on the tail with purplish black, his white or grayish under  parts, and his gorget of purple which gleams in bright, varying tints in  the sun. He closely resembles our common ruby-throated humming-bird,  whose gorget is intense crimson instead of purple, and who does not  venture into the Rocky Mountain region, but dwells exclusively in the  eastern part of North America. It is a little strange that the eastern  part of our country attracts only one species of the large hummer  family, while the western portion, including the Rocky Mountain region,  can boast of at least seventeen different kinds as summer residents or  visitors.    My attention was first directed to the broad-tailed hummer by seeing him  darting about in the air with the swiftness of an arrow, sipping honey  from the flower cups, and then flying to the twigs of a dead tree that  stood in the marsh. There he sat, turning his head this way and that,  and watching me with his keen little eyes. It was plain he did not trust  me, and therefore resented my presence. Though an unwelcome guest, I  prolonged my call for several hours, during which I made many heroic but  vain attempts to find his nest.    But what was the meaning of a sharp, insect-like buzzing that fell at  intervals on my ear? Presently I succeeded in tracing the sound to the  hummer, which utters it whenever he darts from his perch and back again,  especially if there is a spectator or a rival near at hand, for whom he  seems in this way to express his contempt. It is a vocal sound, or, at  least, it comes from his throat, and is much louder and sharper than the  _susurrus_ produced by the rapid movement of his wings. This I ascertain  by hearing both the sounds at the same time.    But the oddest prank which this hummer performs is to dart up in the  air, and then down, almost striking a bush or a clump of grass at each  descent, repeating this feat a number of times with a swiftness that the  eye can scarcely follow. Having done this, he will swing up into the air  so far that you can scarcely see him with the naked eye; the next moment  he will drop into view, poise in mid-air seventy-five or a hundred feet  above your head, supporting himself by a swift motion of the wings, and  simply hitching to right and left in short arcs, as if he were fixed on  a pivot, sometimes meanwhile whirling clear around. There he hangs on  his invisible axis until you grow tired watching him, and then he darts  to his favorite perch on the dead tree.    No doubt John Vance Cheney had in mind another species when he composed  the following metrical description, but it aptly characterized the  volatile broad-tail as well:        \"Voyager on golden air,      Type of all that's fleet and fair,      Incarnate gem,      Live diadem,      Bird-beam of the summer day,--      Whither on your sunny way?           *       *       *       *       *        Stay, forget lost Paradise,      Star-bird fallen from happy skies.\"    After that first meeting the broad-tailed hummers were frequently seen  in my rambles among the Rockies. In some places there were small  colonies of them. They did not always dwell together in harmony, but  often pursued one another like tiny furies, with a loud z-z-z-zip that  meant defiance and war. The swiftness of their movements often excited  my wonder, and it was difficult to see how they kept from impaling  themselves on thorns or snags, so reckless were their lightning-like  passages through the bushes and trees. When four or five of them were  found in one place, they would fairly thread the air with green and  purple as they described their circles and loops and festoons with a  rapidity that fairly made my head whirl. At one place several of them  grew very bold, dashing at me or wheeling around my head, coming so  close that I could hear the _susurrus_ of their wings as well as the  sharp, challenging buzz from their throats.    Perhaps it would interest you to know where the rambler found these tiny  hummers. They were never in the dark canyons and gorges, nor in the  ravines that were heavily wooded with pine, but in the open, sunshiny  glades and valleys, where there were green grass and bright flowers. In  the upper part of both North and South Cheyenne Canyons they were  plentiful, although they avoided the most scenic parts of these  wonderful mountain gorges. Another place where they found a pleasant  summer home was in a green pocket of the mountain above Red Cliff, a  village on the western side of the great range. On descending the  mountains to the town of Glenwood, I did not find them, and therefore am  disposed to think that in the breeding season they do not choose to  dwell in too low or too high an altitude, but seek suitable places at an  elevation of from seven thousand to nine thousand feet.    _SUMMIT OF PIKE'S PEAK_    _Only a small portion of the peak is shown in the view. The  comparatively level area referred to in the text lies back of the signal  station on the crest. At a garbage heap near the building a flock of  leucostictes were seen, and the writer was told that they came there  regularly to feed. From this sublime height the American pipits rise on  resilient wings hundreds of feet into the air until they disappear in  the cerulean depths of the sky, singing all the while at \"heaven's  gate.\"_    [Illustration]    One day, while staying at Buena Vista, Colorado, I hired a saddle-horse  and rode to Cottonwood Lake, twelve miles away, among the rugged  mountains. The valley is wide enough here to admit of a good deal of  sunshine, and therefore flowers studded the ground in places. It was  here I saw the only female broad-tailed hummer that was met with in my  rambles in the Rockies. She was flitting among the flowers, and did not  make the buzzing sound that the males produce wherever found. She was  not clad so elegantly as were her masculine relatives, for the  throat-patch was white instead of purple, and the green on her back did  not gleam so brightly. But, oddly enough, her sides and under  tail-coverts were stained with a rufous tint--a color that does not  appear at all in the costume of the male.    A curious habit of these hummers is worth describing. The males remain  in the breeding haunts until the young are out of the nest and are  beginning to be able to shift for themselves. Then the papas begin to  disappear, and in about ten days all have gone, leaving the mothers and  the youngsters to tarry about the summer home until the latter are  strong enough to make the journey to some resort lower in the mountains  or farther south. The reason the males do this is perhaps evident  enough, for at a certain date the flowers upon whose sweets the birds  largely subsist begin to grow scant, and so if they remained there  would not be enough for all.    In the San Francisco Mountains of Arizona, Doctor Merriam found the  broad-tails very abundant in the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25992"],[0,"The Martyrs of Science, or, The lives of Galileo, Tycho Brahe, and Kepler (#12)"],[1," its interests. The dogmas of the Catholic faith had  been brought into direct collision with the deductions of science. The  leader of the philosophic band had broken the most solemn armistice with  the Inquisition: he had renounced the ties of gratitude which bound him  to the Pontiff; and Urban was thus compelled to entrench himself in a  position to which he had been driven by his opponents.         [33] Library of Useful Knowledge, Life of Galileo, chap. viii.    The design of summoning Galileo before the Inquisition, seems to have  been formed almost immediately after the publication of his book; for  even in August 1632, the preliminary proceedings had reached the ears of  the Grand Duke Ferdinand. The Tuscan ambassador at Rome was speedily  acquainted with the dissatisfaction which his Sovereign felt at these  proceedings; and he was instructed to forward to Florence a written  statement of the charges against Galileo, in order to enable him to  prepare for his defence. Although this request was denied, Ferdinand  again interposed, and transmitted a letter to his ambassador,  recommending the admission of Campanella and Castelli into the  congregation of ecclesiastics by whom Galileo was to be judged.  Circumstances, however, rendered it prudent to withhold this letter.  Castelli was sent away from Rome, and Scipio Chiaramonte, a bigotted  ecclesiastic, was summoned from Pisa to complete the number of the  judges.    It appears from a despatch of the Tuscan minister, that Ferdinand was  enraged at the transaction; and he instructed his ambassador, Niccolini,  to make the strongest representations to the Pope. Niccolini had several  interviews with his Holiness; but all his expostulations were fruitless.  He found Urban highly incensed against Galileo; and his Holiness begged  Niccolini to advise the Archduke not to interfere any farther, as he  would not \"get through it with honour.\" On the 15th of September the  Pope caused it to be intimated to Niccolini, as a mark of his especial  esteem for the Grand Duke, that he was obliged to refer the work to the  Inquisition; but both the prince and his ambassador were declared liable  to the usual censures if they divulged the secret.    From the measures which this tribunal had formerly pursued, it was not  difficult to foresee the result of their present deliberations. They  summoned Galileo to appear before them at Rome, to answer in person the  charges under which he lay. The Tuscan ambassador expostulated warmly  with the court of Rome on the inhumanity of this proceeding. He urged  his advanced age, his infirm health, the discomforts of the journey, and  the miseries of the quarantine,[34] as motives for reconsidering their  decision: But the Pope was inexorable, and though it was agreed to relax  the quarantine as much as possible in his favour, yet it was declared  indispensable that he should appear in person before the Inquisition.         [34] The communication between Florence and Rome was at this time       interrupted by a contagious disease which had broken out in       Tuscany.    Worn out with age and infirmities, and exhausted with the fatigues of  his journey, Galileo arrived at Rome on the 14th of February, 1633. The  Tuscan ambassador announced his arrival in an official form to the  commissary of the holy office, and Galileo awaited in calm dignity the  approach of his trial. Among those who proffered their advice in this  distressing emergency, we must enumerate the Cardinal Barberino, the  Pope's nephew, who, though he may have felt the necessity of an  interference on the part of the church, was yet desirous that it should  be effected with the least injury to Galileo and to science. He  accordingly visited Galileo, and advised him to remain as much at home  as possible, to keep aloof from general society, and to see only his  most intimate friends. The same advice was given from different  quarters; and Galileo, feeling its propriety, remained in strict  seclusion in the palace of the Tuscan ambassador.    During the whole of the trial which had now commenced, Galileo was  treated with the most marked indulgence. Abhorring, as we must do, the  principles and practice of this odious tribunal, and reprobating its  interference with the cautious deductions of science, we must yet admit  that, on this occasion, its deliberations were not dictated by passion,  nor its power directed by vengeance. Though placed at their  judgment-seat as a heretic, Galileo stood there with the recognised  attributes of a sage; and though an offender against the laws of which  they were the guardian, yet the highest respect was yielded to his  genius, and the kindest commiseration to his infirmities.    In the beginning of April, when his examination in person was to  commence, it became necessary that he should be removed to the holy  office; but instead of committing him, as was the practice, to solitary  confinement, he was provided with apartments in the house of the fiscal  of the Inquisition. His table was provided by the Tuscan ambassador, and  his servant was allowed to attend him at his pleasure, and to sleep in  an adjoining apartment. Even this nominal confinement, however,  Galileo's high spirit was unable to brook. An attack of the disease to  which he was constitutionally subject contributed to fret and irritate  him, and he became impatient for a release from his anxiety as well as  from his bondage. Cardinal Barberino seems to have received notice of  the state of Galileo's feelings, and, with a magnanimity which posterity  will ever honour, he liberated the philosopher on his own  responsibility; and in ten days after his first examination, and on the  last day of April, he was restored to the hospitable roof of the Tuscan  ambassador.    Though this favour was granted on the condition of his remaining in  strict seclusion, Galileo recovered his health, and to a certain degree  his usual hilarity, amid the kind attentions of Niccolini and his  family; and when the want of exercise had begun to produce symptoms of  indisposition, the Tuscan minister obtained for him leave to go into the  public gardens in a half-closed carriage.    After the Inquisition had examined Galileo personally, they allowed him  a reasonable time for preparing his defence. He felt the difficulty of  adducing any thing like a plausible justification of his conduct; and he  resorted to an ingenious, though a shallow artifice, which was regarded  by the court as an aggravation of the crime. After his first appearance  before the Inquisition in 1616, he was publicly and falsely charged by  his enemies with having then abjured his opinions; and he was taunted as  a criminal who had been actually punished for his offences. As a  refutation of these calumnies, Cardinal Bellarmine had given him a  certificate in his own handwriting, declaring that he neither abjured  his opinions, nor suffered punishment for them; and that the doctrine of  the earth's motion, and the sun's stability, was only denounced to him  as contrary to Scripture, and as one which could not be defended. To  this certificate the Cardinal did not add, because he was not called  upon to do it, that Galileo was enjoined not _to teach in any manner_  the doctrine thus denounced; and Galileo ingeniously avails himself of  this supposed omission, to account for his having, in the lapse of  fourteen or sixteen years, forgotten the injunction. He assigned the  same excuse for his having omitted to mention this injunction to  Riccardi, and to the Inquisitor-General at Florence, when he obtained  the licence to print his Dialogues. The court held the production of  this certificate to be at once a proof and an aggravation of his  offence, because the certificate itself declared that the obnoxious  doctrines had been pronounced contrary to the Holy Scriptures.    Having duly weighed the confessions and excuses of their prisoner, and  considered the general merits of the case, the Inquisition came to an  agreement upon the sentence which they were to pronounce, and appointed  the 22d of June as the day on which it was to be delivered. Two days  previous to this, Galileo was summoned to appear at the holy office; and  on the morning of the 21st, he obeyed the summons. On the 22d of June he  was clothed in a penitential dress, and conducted to the convent of  Minerva, where the Inquisition was assembled to give judgment. A long  and elaborate sentence was pronounced, detailing the former proceedings  of the Inquisition, and specifying the offences which he had committed  in teaching heretical doctrines, in violating his former pledges, and in  obtaining by improper means a license for the printing of his Dialogues.  After an invocation of the name of our Saviour, and of the Holy Virgin,  Galileo is declared to have brought himself under strong suspicions of  heresy, and to have incurred all the censures and penalties which are  enjoined against delinquents of this kind; but from all these  consequences he is to be held absolved, provided that with a sincere  heart, and a faith unfeigned, he abjures and curses the heresies he has  cherished, as well as every other heresy against the Catholic church. In  order that his offence might not go altogether unpunished, that he might  be more cautious in future, and be a warning to others to abstain from  similar delinquencies, it was also decreed that his Dialogues should be  prohibited by public edict; that he himself should be condemned to the  prison of the Inquisition during their pleasure, and that, in the  course of the next three years, he should recite once a week the seven  penitential psalms.    The ceremony of Galileo's abjuration was one of exciting interest, and  of awful formality. Clothed in the sackcloth of a repentant criminal,  the venerable sage fell upon his knees before the assembled Cardinals;  and laying his hands upon the Holy Evangelists, he invoked"]]]
