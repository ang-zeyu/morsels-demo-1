It is, however, correct in some points; but the real truths about     Bonaparte's life at this time seem so little known that it may be     well to explain the whole matter. On the 27th of March 1795     Bonaparte, already removed from his employment in the south, was     ordered to proceed to the army of the west to command its artillery     as brigadier-general. He went as far as Paris, and then lingered     there, partly on medical certificate. While in Paris he applied, as     Bourrienne says, to go to Turkey to organise its artillery. His     application, instead of being neglected, as Bourrienne says, was     favourably received, two members of the 'Comite de Saint Public'     putting on its margin most favorable reports of him; one, Jean     Debry, even saying that he was too distinguished an officer to be     sent to a distance at such a time. Far from being looked on as the     half-crazy fellow Bourrienne considered him at that time, Bonaparte     was appointed, on the 21st of August 1795, one of four generals     attached as military advisers to the Committee for the preparation     of warlike operations, his own department being a most important     one. He himself at the time tells Joseph that he is attached to the     topographical bureau of the Comite de Saint Public, for the     direction of the armies in the place of Carnot. It is apparently     this significant appointment to which Madame Junot, wrongly dating     it, alludes as \"no great thing\" (Junot, vol. i, p. 143). Another     officer was therefore substituted for him as commander of Roches     artillery, a fact made use of in the Erreurs (p. 31) to deny his     having been dismissed--But a general re-classification of the     generals was being made. The artillery generals were in excess of     their establishment, and Bonaparte, as junior in age, was ordered on     13th June to join Hoche's army at Brest to command a brigade of     infantry. All his efforts to get the order cancelled failed, and as     he did not obey it he was struck off the list of employed general     officers on the 15th of September 1795, the order of the 'Comite de     Salut Public' being signed by Cambacérès, Berber, Merlin, and     Boissy. His application to go to Turkey still, however, remained;     and it is a curious thing that, on the very day he was struck off     the list, the commission which had replaced the Minister of War     recommended to the 'Comite de Saint Public' that he and his two     aides de camp, Junot and Livrat, with other officers, under him,     should be sent to Constantinople. So late as the 29th of September,     twelve days later, this matter was being considered, the only     question being as to any departmental objections to the other     officers selected by him, a point which was just being settled. But     on the 13th Vendemiaire (5th October 1795), or rather on the night     before, only nineteen days after his removal, he was appointed     second in command to Barras, a career in France was opened to him,     and Turkey was no longer thought of.       Thiers (vol. iv, p. 326) and most writers, contemporary and     otherwise, say that Aubry gave the order for his removal from the     list. Aubry, himself a brigadier-general of artillery, did not     belong to the 'Comite de Salut Public' at the time Bonaparte was     removed from the south; and he had left the Comite early is August,     that is, before the order striking Bonaparte off was given. Aubry     was, however, on the Comite in June 1795, and signed the order,     which probably may have originated from him, for the transfer of     Bonaparte to the infantry. It will be seen that, in the ordinary     military sense of the term, Napoleon was only in Paris without     employment from the 15th of September to the 4th or 6th of October     1796; all the rest of the time in Paris he had a command which he     did not choose to take up. The distress under which Napoleon is     said to have laboured in pecuniary matters was probably shared by     most officers at that time; see 'Erreurs', tome i. p. 32. This     period is fully described in Iung, tome ii. p. 476, and tome iii.     pp. 1-93.]--    Deeply mortified at this unexpected stroke, Bonaparte retired into  private life, and found himself doomed to an inactivity very uncongenial  with his ardent character. He lodged in the Rue du Mail, in an hotel  near the Place des Victoires, and we recommenced the sort of life we  had led in 1792, before his departure for Corsica. It was not without  a struggle that he determined to await patiently the removal of the  prejudices which were cherished against him by men in power; and he  hoped that, in the perpetual changes which were taking place, those  men might be superseded by others more favourable to him. He frequently  dined and spent the evening with me and my elder brother; and his  pleasant conversation and manners made the hours pass away very  agreeably. I called on him almost every morning, and I met at his  lodgings several persons who were distinguished at the time; among  others Salicetti, with whom he used to maintain very animated  conversations, and who would often solicit a private interview with him.  On one occasion Salicetti paid him three thousand francs, in assignats,  as the price of his carriage, which his straitened circumstances obliged  him to dispose of.         --[Of Napoleon's poverty at this time Madame Junot says, \"On     Bonaparte's return to Paris, after the misfortunes of which he     accused Salicetti of being the cause, he was in very destitute     circumstances. His family, who were banished from Corsica, found an     asylum at Marseilles; and they could not now do for him what they     would have done had they been in the country whence they derived     their pecuniary resources. From time to time he received     remittances of money, and I suspect they came from his excellent     brother Joseph, who had then recently married 'Mademoiselle Clary;     but with all his economy these supplies were insufficient.     Bonaparte was therefore in absolute distress. Junot often used to     speak of the six months they passed together in Paris at this time.     When they took an evening stroll on the Boulevard, which used to be     the resort of young men, mounted on fine horses, and displaying all     the luxury which they were permitted to show at that time, Bonaparte     would declaim against fate, and express his contempt for the dandies     with their whiskers and their 'orielles de chiene', who, as they     rode Past, were eulogising in ecstasy the manner in which Madame     Scio sang. And it is on such beings as these,' he would say, 'that     Fortune confers her favours. Grand Dieu! how contemptible is human     nature!'\" (Memoirs of the Duchesse d'Abrantes, vol. i. p. 80,     edit. 1883.)]--    I could, easily perceive that our young friend either was or wished to  be initiated in some political intrigue; and I moreover suspected that  Salicetti had bound him by an oath not to disclose the plans that were  hatching.    He became pensive, melancholy, and anxious; and he always looked with  impatience for Salicetti's daily visit.         --[Salicetti was implicated in the insurrection of the 20th May     1795, 1st Prairial, Year III., and was obliged to fly to Venice.]--    Sometimes, withdrawing his mind from political affairs, he would  envy the happiness of his brother Joseph, who had just then married  Mademoiselle Clary, the daughter of a rich and respectable merchant of  Marseilles. He would often say, \"That Joseph is a lucky rogue.\"    Meanwhile time passed away, and none of his projects succeeded--none of  his applications were listened to. He was vexed by the injustice with  which he was treated, and tormented by the desire of entering upon some  active pursuit. He could not endure the thought of remaining buried in  the crowd. He determined to quit France; and the favourite idea, which  he never afterwards relinquished, that the East is a fine field for  glory, inspired him with the wish to proceed to Constantinople, and  to enter the service of the Grand Seignior. What romantic plans, what  stupendous projects he conceived! He asked me whether I would go with  him? I replied in the negative. I looked upon him as a half-crazy  young fellow, who was driven to extravagant enterprises and desperate  resolutions by his restless activity of mind, joined to the irritating  treatment he had experienced, and, perhaps, it may be added, his want of  money. He did not blame me for my refusal to accompany him; and he told  me that Junot, Marmont, and some other young officers whom he had known  at Toulon, would be willing to follow his fortunes.    He drew up a note which commenced with the words 'Note for . . .' It was  addressed to no one, and was merely a plan. Some days after he wrote out  another, which, however, did not differ very materially from the first,  and which he addressed to Aubert and Coni. I made him a fair copy of it,  and it was regularly for forwarded. It was as follows:--                       NOTE.    At a moment when the Empress of Russia has strengthened her union with  the Emperor of Germany (Austria), it is the interest of France to do  everything in her power to increase the military power of Turkey.    That power possesses a numerous and brave militia but is very backward  in the scientific part of the art of war.

For this cause I am become very       curious to dive, as they say, into the bottom of this       business ... and bring myself to a certainty in this       subject.\"[231]    [Footnote 230: Galileo: _Opere_, X, 68.]    [Footnote 231: 'The Second Day' in Salusbury: _Math. Coll._ I,  110-111.]    Galileo's brilliant work in mechanics and his great popularity--for  his lectures were thronged--combined with his skilled and witty  attacks upon the accepted scientific ideas of the age, embittered and  antagonized many who were both conservative and jealous.[232] The  Jesuits particularly resented his influence and power, for they  claimed the leadership in the educational world and were jealous of  intruders. Furthermore, they were bound by the decree of the fiftieth  General Congregation of their society in 1593 to defend Aristotle, a  decree strictly enforced.[233] While a few of the Jesuits were  friendly disposed to Galileo at first, the controversies in which he  and they became involved and their bitter attacks upon him made him  feel by 1633 that they were among his chief enemies.[234]    [Footnote 232: Fahie: 265.]    [Footnote 233: Conway: 46-47.]    [Footnote 234: Conway: 46-47.]    Early in 1609, Galileo heard a rumor of a spy-glass having been made  in Flanders, and proceeded to work one out for himself according to  the laws of perspective. The fifth telescope that he made magnified  thirty diameters, and it was with such instruments of his own  manufacture that he made in the next three years his famous  discoveries: Jupiter's four satellites (which he named the Medicean  Planets), Saturn's \"tripartite\" character (the rings were not  recognized as such for several decades thereafter), the stars of the  Milky Way, the crescent form of Venus, the mountains of the moon, many  more fixed stars, and the spots on the sun. Popular interest waxed  with each new discovery and from all sides came requests for  telescopes; yet there were those who absolutely refused even to look  through a telescope lest they be compelled to admit Aristotle was  mistaken, and others claimed that Jupiter's moons were merely defects  in the instrument. The formal announcement of the first of these  discoveries was made in the _Sidereus Nuncius_ (1610), a book that  aroused no little opposition. Kepler, however, had it reprinted at  once in Prague with a long appreciative preface of his own.[235]    [Footnote 235: Fahie: 77-126.]    The following March Galileo went to Rome to show his discoveries and  was received with the utmost distinction by princes and church  dignitaries alike. A commission of four scientific members of the  Roman College had previously examined his claims at Cardinal  Bellarmin's suggestion, and had admitted their truth. Now Pope Paul V  gave him long audiences; the Academia dei Lincei elected him a member,  and everywhere he was acclaimed. Nevertheless his name appears on the  secret books of the Holy Office as early as May of that year  (1611).[236] Already he was a suspect.    [Footnote 236: Doc. in Favaro: 13.]    His _Delle Macchie Solari_ (1611) brought on a sharp contest over the  question of priority of discovery between him and the Jesuit father,  Christopher Scheiner of Ingolstadt, from which Galileo emerged  victorious and more disliked than before by that order. Opposition was  becoming active; Father Castelli, for instance, the professor of  mathematics at Pisa and Galileo's intimate friend, was forbidden to  discuss in his lectures the double motion of the earth or even to hint  at its probability. This same father wrote to his friend early in  December, 1613, to tell him of a dinner-table conversation on this  matter at the Tuscan Court, then wintering at Pisa. Castelli told how  the Dowager Grand Duchess Cristina had had her religious scruples  aroused by a remark that the earth's motion must be wrong because it  contradicted the Scriptures, a statement that he had tried to  refute.[237] Galileo wrote in reply (December 21, 1613), the  letter[238] that was to cause him endless trouble, in which he marked  out the boundaries between science and religion and declared it a  mistake to take the literal interpretation of passages in Scripture  that were obviously written according to the understanding of the  common people. He pointed out in addition how futile the miracle of  the sun's standing still was as an argument against the Copernican  doctrine for, even according to the Ptolemaic system, not the sun but  the _primum mobile_ must be stayed for the day to be lengthened.    [Footnote 237: Fahie: 149.]    [Footnote 238: Galileo: _Opere_, V, 281-288.]    Father Castelli allowed others to read and to copy this supposedly  private letter; copies went from hand to hand in Florence and  discussion ran high. On the fourth Sunday in December, 1614, Father  Caccini of the Dominicans preached a sermon in the church of S.M.  Novella on Joshua's miracle, in which he sharply denounced the  Copernican doctrine taught by Galileo as heretical, so he  believed.[239] The Copernicans found a Neapolitan Jesuit who replied  to Caccini the following Sunday from the pulpit of the Duomo.[240]    [Footnote 239: Doc. in Favaro: 48-49.]    [Footnote 240: Doc. in Favaro: 49.]    In February (1615), came the formal denunciation of Galileo to the  Holy Office at Rome by Father Lorini, a Dominican associate of  Caccini's at the Convent San Marco. The father sent with his \"friendly  warning,\" a copy of the letter to Castelli charging that it contained  \"many propositions which were either suspect or temerarious,\" and, he  added, \"though the _Galileisti_ were good Christians they were rather  stubborn and obstinate in their opinions.\"[241] The machinery of the  Inquisition began secretly to turn. The authorities failed to get the  original of the letter, for Castelli had returned that to Galileo at  the latter's request.[242] Pope Paul sent word to Father Caccini to  appear before the Holy Office in Rome to depose on this matter of  Galileo's errors \"pro exoneratione suae conscientiae.\"[243] This he did  \"freely\" in March and was of course sworn to secrecy. He named a  certain nobleman, a Copernican, as the source of his information about  Galileo, for he did not know the latter even by sight. This nobleman  was by order of the Pope examined in November after some delay by the  Inquisitor at Florence. His testimony was to the effect that he  considered Galileo the best of Catholics.[244]    [Footnote 241: Ibid: 38: \"amorevole avviso.\"]    [Footnote 242: Ibid: 46, 47, 51.]    [Footnote 243: Ibid: 47.]    [Footnote 244: Ibid: 49.]    Meanwhile the Consultors of the Holy Office had examined Lorini's copy  of the letter and reported the finding of only three objectionable  places all of which, they stated, could be amended by changing certain  doubtful phrases; otherwise it did not deviate from the true faith. It  is interesting to note that the copy they had differed in many minor  respects from the original letter, and in one place heightened a  passage with which the Examiners found fault as imputing falsehood to  the Scriptures although they are infallible.[245] Galileo's own  statement ran that there were many passages in the Scriptures which  according to the literal meaning of the words, \"hanno aspetto diverso  dal vero....\" The copy read, \"molte propositioni falso quanto al nudo  senso delle parole.\"    [Footnote 245: Ibid: 43-45, see original in Galileo: _Opere_, V,  281-285.]    Rumors of trouble reached Galileo and, urged on by his friends, in  1615 he wrote a long formal elaboration of the earlier letter,  addressing this one to the Dowager Grand Duchess, but he had only  added fuel to the fire. At the end of the year he voluntarily went to  Rome, regardless of any possible danger to himself, to see if he could  not prevent a condemnation of the doctrine.[246] It came as a decided  surprise to him to receive an order to appear before Cardinal  Bellarmin on February 26, 1616,[2] and there to learn that the Holy  Office had already condemned it two days before. He was told that the  Holy Office had declared: first, \"that the proposition that the sun is  the center of the universe and is immobile is foolish and absurd in  philosophy and formally heretical since it contradicts the express  words of the Scriptures in many places, according to the meaning of  the words and the common interpretation and sense of the Fathers and  the doctors of theology; and, secondly, that the proposition that the  earth is not the center of the universe nor immobile receives the same  censure in philosophy and in regard to its theological truth, it at  least is erroneous in Faith.\"[247]    [Footnote 246: Doc. in Favaro: 78.]    [Footnote 247: Ibid: 61.]    Exactly what was said at that meeting between the two men became the  crucial point in Galileo's trial sixteen years later, hence a somewhat  detailed study is important. At the meeting of the Congregation on  February 25th, the Pope ordered Cardinal Bellarmin to summon Galileo  and, in the presence of a notary and witnesses lest he should prove  recusant, warn him to abandon the condemned opinion and in every way  to abstain from teaching, defending or discussing it; if he did not  acquiesce, he was to be imprisoned.[248] The Secret Archives of the  Vatican contain a minute reporting this interview (dated February 26,  1616), in which the Cardinal is said to have ordered Galileo to  relinquish this condemned proposition, \"nec "]]]
