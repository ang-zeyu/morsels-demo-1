The veil is absent, or, if present, it  is downy and adherent to the margin of the cap. The cap is generally  quite fleshy; the stem is homogeneous and confluent with the pileus,  central and nearly fleshy, without either ring or volva, and with no  distinct bark-like coat. The spores are white or grayish-white.    The distinguishing features are the fleshy stem, continuous with the  flesh of the pileus, and the sinuate or notched gills. This is quite a  universal genus. All the species grow on the ground, so far as I know  them.    There are many edible species under this genus, there being only two, so  far as I know, not edible; and no one is likely to touch those on  account of their strong odor. They are T. sulphureum and T. saponaceum.      _Tricholoma transmutans. Pk._    THE CHANGING TRICHOLOMA. EDIBLE.    Transmutans means changing, from changes of color in both stem and gills  in different stages of the plant. This species has a cap two to four  inches broad, viscid or sticky when moist. It is at first tawny-brown,  especially with advancing age. The flesh is white and has a decided  farinaceous odor and taste.    The gills are crowded, rather narrow, sometimes branched, becoming  reddish-spotted with age.    The stem is equal or slightly tapering upward; bare, or slightly  silky-fibrillose; stuffed or hollow; whitish, often marked with reddish  stains or becoming reddish-brown toward the base, white within. Spores  subglobose, 5u.    The species grows in woods and open places, also in clover pastures,  either singly or in tufts. I have seen large tufts of them, and in that  case the caps are more or less irregular on account of their crowded  condition. I found it frequently about Salem, and this fall, 1905, I  found it quite plentiful in a clover pasture near Chillicothe. Found in  wet weather from August to September.      _Tricholoma equestre. Linn._    THE KNIGHTLY TRICHOLOMA. EDIBLE.    [Illustration: Figure 43.--Tricholoma equestre.]    Equestre means belonging to a horseman; so called from its distinguished  appearance in the woods.    The pileus is three to five inches broad, fleshy, compact, convex,  expanded, obtuse, viscid, scaly, margin incurved at first, pale  yellowish, with sometimes a slight tinge of green in both cap and gills.  Flesh white or tinged with yellow.    The gills are free, crowded, rounded behind, yellow.    The stem is stout, solid, pale yellow or white, white within. The spores  are 7-8x5u.    It differs from T. coryphaeum in having gills entirely yellow, while the  edges only of the latter are yellow. It differs from T. sejunctum in the  latter having pure white gills and a more slender stem.    It is found but occasionally here, and then only a specimen or two. It  is an attractive plant and no one would pass it in the woods without  admiring it. Found from August to October.      _Tricholoma sordidum. Fr._    [Illustration: Figure 44.--Tricholoma sordidum.]    Sordidum means dingy, dirty.    The pileus is two to three inches broad, rather tough, fleshy, convex,  bell-shaped, then depressed, subumbonate, smooth, hygrophanous, margin  slightly striate, brownish lilac, then dusky.    The gills are rounded, rather crowded, dingy violet then dusky, notched  with a decurrent tooth.    The stem is colored like the pileus, fibrillose striate, usually  slightly curved, stuffed, short, often thickened at the base.    The spores are 7-8x3-4, minutely rugulose.    This species differs from T. nudum in being smaller, tougher, and often  hygrophanous.    It is found in richly manured gardens, about manure piles, and in  hot-houses. The specimens in Figure 44 were found in a hot-house near  Boston, Mass., and sent to me by Mrs. E. Blackford. They are found in  September and October.      _Tricholoma grammopodium. Bull._    THE GROOVED STEM TRICHOLOMA. EDIBLE.    [Illustration: Figure 45.--Tricholoma grammopodium. Natural size.]    Grammopodium is from two Greek words meaning _line_ and _foot_.    The pileus is three to six inches broad, flesh thick at the center, thin  at the margin, solid yet tender; brownish, blackish-umber, almost a  dingy-lavender when moist, whitish when dry; at first bell-shaped, then  convex, sometimes slightly wavy, obtusely umbonate; margin at first  inclined to be involute, and extending beyond the gills.    The gills are attached to the stem, broadly notched as will be seen in  the specimen, closely crowded, quite entire, shorter ones numerous, a  few branched, white or whitish.    The stem is three to four inches long, thickened at the base, smooth,  firm, longitudinally grooved from which it gets its specific name,  whitish.    The spores are nearly round, 5-6u.    It closely resembles T. fuligineum but can be distinguished by the  grooved stem and crowded gills. The specimens in Figure 45 were found  near Boston, and were sent to me by Mrs. Blackford. The plants keep well  and are easily dried. They were found the first of June. They have an  excellent flavor.      _Tricholoma paedidum. Fr._    Paedidum means nasty, stinking.    The pileus is small, about one and a half inches broad, rather fleshy,  tough; convex, then flattened, soon depressed around the conical umbo;  fibrillose, becoming smooth; smoky gray, somewhat streaked; moist;  margin involute, naked.    The gills are adnexed, crowded, narrow, white, then grayish, somewhat  sinuate with a slight decurrent tooth.    The stem is short, slightly striate, dingy gray, thickened at the base.  The spores are elliptical or fusiform, 10-11x5-6u.    The specific name, \"nasty\" or \"stinking,\" has really no application to  the plant. It is said to be very good when cooked. It is found in well  manured gardens and fields, or about manure piles.    It differs from T. sordidum in having no trace of violet color. T.  lixivium differs in the free truncate gills.      _Tricholoma lixivium. Fr._    Lixivium means made into lye; hence, of the color of ashes and water.    The pileus is two to three inches broad; flesh thin; convex then plane;  umbonate, never depressed; even; smooth; grayish-brown when moist, then  umber; margin membranaceous, at length slightly striate, sometimes wavy.    The gills are rounded behind and adnexed, free, soft, distant, often  crisped, gray.    The stem is about two inches long, fibrous, hollow, or stuffed, equal,  at first covered with a white down, fragile, gray.    The spores are elliptical, 7x4-5u.    The umbonate pileus and the nearly free, broad, gray gills will  distinguish it. They are a late grower and are found under pine trees in  November.      _Tricholoma sulphureum. Bull._    SULPHURY TRICHOLOMA. POISONOUS.    [Illustration: Figure 46.--Tricholoma sulphureum.]    Sulphureum, sulphur; so called from the general color of the plant.    The pileus is one to three inches broad, fleshy, convex, then expanded,  plane, slightly umbonate, sometimes depressed, or flexuous and  irregular, margin at first involute, dingy or reddish-yellow, at first  silky, becoming smooth and even.    The gills are rather thick, narrowed behind, emarginate or acutely  adnate, sulphur-colored.    The stem is two to four inches long, somewhat bulbous, sometimes curved,  frequently slightly striate; stuffed, often hollow; sulphur-yellow,  yellow within; furnished at the base occasionally with many rather  strong, yellow, fibrous roots. Odor strong and disagreeable. Flesh thick  and yellow. Spores are 9-10x5u.    It grows in mixed woods. I find it frequently where logs have decayed.  The specimen in Figure 46 was found in Haynes' Hollow and photographed  by Dr. Kellerman. Found in October and November.      _Tricholoma quinquepartitum. Fr._    Quinquepartitum means divided into five parts. There is no apparent  reason for the name. Fries could not identify Linnaeus' Agaricus  quinquepartitus and he attached the name of this species.    The pileus is three or four inches broad, slightly fleshy; convex,  rather involute, then flattened, somewhat repand; viscid, smooth, even,  pale yellowish.    The gills are notched at the point of attachment to the stem, broad,  white.    The stem is three to four inches long, solid, striate or grooved,  smooth. The spores are 5-6x3-4.    This species differs from T. portentosum in the pileus not being  virgate, and from T. fucatum in the smooth, striate or grooved stem.  This plant is found in thin woods where logs have decayed. I have not  eaten this species but I have no doubt of its edibility. The taste is  pleasant. Found in October and November.      _Tricholoma laterarium. Pk._    [Illustration: Figure 47.--Tricholoma laterarium.]    Laterarium is from _later_, a brick; so called because there is nearly  always a slight tinge of brick red on the disk.    The pileus is two to four inches broad, convex, then expanded, sometimes  slightly depressed in the center; pruinose, whitish, the disk often  tinged with red or brown, the thin margin marked with slight subdistant,  short, radiating ridges.    The gills are narrow, crowded, white, prolonged in little decurrent  lines on the stem. The stem is nearly equal, solid, white. The spores  are globose, .00018 inch in diameter. _Peck's_ 26th Rep.    This plant is quite widely distributed in the United States. It is found  quite frequently in Ohio and is rather abundant on the hillsides about  Chillicothe, where it is frequently somewhat bulbous. The tinge of  brownish-red on the disk, and the short radiating ridges on the margin  of the pileus will serve to identify the plant. It is edible and fairly  good. Found on leaf-mold in rather damp woods from July to November.      _Tricholoma panaeolum. Fr._    [Illustration: Figure 48.--Tricholoma panaeolum.]    Panaeolum, all variegated. The pileus is from three to four inches broad,  deeply depressed, dusky with a gray bloom, hygrophanous; margin at first  inrolled, sometimes wavy or irregular when fully expanded.    The gills are quite crowded, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29233"],[0,"The 2008 CIA World Factbook (#12)"],[1," in the Americas and in a number of other  Western countries.       Orthodox Christianity: The oldest established eastern form of  Christianity, the Holy Orthodox Church, has a ceremonial head in the  Bishop of Constantinople (Istanbul), also known as a Patriarch, but its  various regional forms (e.g., Greek Orthodox, Russian Orthodox, Serbian  Orthodox, Ukrainian Orthodox) are autocephalous (independent of  Constantinople's authority, and have their own Patriarchs). Orthodox  churches are highly nationalist and ethnic. The Orthodox Christian  faith shares many theological tenets with the Roman Catholic Church,  but diverges on some key premises and does not recognize the governing  authority of the Pope.       Protestant Christianity: Protestant Christianity originated in the  16th century as an attempt to reform Roman Catholicism's practices,  dogma, and theology. It encompasses several forms or denominations  which are extremely varied in structure, beliefs, relationship to  state, clergy, and governance. Many protestant theologies emphasize the  primary role of scripture in their faith, advocating individual  interpretation of Christian texts without the mediation of a final  religious authority such as the Roman Pope. The oldest Protestant  Christianities include Lutheranism, Calvinism (Presbyterians), and  Anglican Christianity (Episcopalians), which have established  liturgies, governing structure, and formal clergy. Other variants on  Protestant Christianity, including Pentecostal movements and  independent churches, may lack one or more of these elements, and their  leadership and beliefs are individualized and dynamic.    Hinduism - Originating in the Vedic civilization of India (second and  first millennium B.C.), Hinduism is an extremely diverse set of beliefs  and practices with no single founder or religious authority. Hinduism  has many scriptures; the Vedas, the Upanishads, and the Bhagavad-Gita  are among some of the most important. Hindus may worship one or many  deities, usually with prayer rituals within their own home. The most  common figures of devotion are the gods Vishnu, Shiva, and a mother  goddess, Devi. Most Hindus believe the soul, or atman, is eternal, and  goes through a cycle of birth, death, and rebirth (samsara) determined  by one's positive or negative karma, or the consequences of one's  actions. The goal of religious life is to learn to act so as to finally  achieve liberation (moksha) of one's soul, escaping the rebirth cycle.    Islam - The third of the monotheistic Abrahamic faiths, Islam  originated with the teachings of Muhammad in the 7th century. Muslims  believe Muhammad is the final of all religious prophets (beginning with  Abraham) and that the Qu'ran, which is the Islamic scripture, was  revealed to him by God. Islam derives from the word submission, and  obedience to God is a primary theme in this religion. In order to live  an Islamic life, believers must follow the five pillars, or tenets, of  Islam, which are the testimony of faith (shahada), daily prayer  (salah), giving alms (zakah), fasting during Ramadan (sawm), and the  pilgrimage to Mecca (hajj).    Basic Groupings       The two primary branches of Islam are Sunni and Shia, which split  from each other over a religio-political leadership dispute about the  rightful successor to Muhammad. The Shia believe Muhammad's cousin and  son-in-law, Ali, was the only divinely ordained Imam (religious  leader), while the Sunni maintain the first three caliphs after  Muhammad were also legitimate authorities. In modern Islam, Sunnis and  Shia continue to have different views of acceptable schools of Islamic  jurisprudence, and who is a proper Islamic religious authority. Islam  also has an active mystical branch, Sufism, with various Sunni and Shia  subsets.        Sunni Islam accounts for over 75% of the world's Muslim population.  It recognizes the Abu Bakr as the first caliph after Muhammad. Sunni  has four schools of Islamic doctrine and law - Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi'i,  and Hanbali - which uniquely interpret the Hadith, or recorded oral  traditions of Muhammad. A Sunni Muslim may elect to follow any one of  these schools, as all are considered equally valid.        Shia Islam represents 10-20% of Muslims worldwide, and its  distinguishing feature is its reverence for Ali as an infallible,  divinely inspired leader, and as the first Imam of the Muslim community  after Muhammad. A majority of Shia are known as \"Twelvers,\" because  they believe that the 11 familial successor imams after Muhammad  culminate in a 12th Imam (al-Mahdi) who is hidden in the world and will  reappear at its end to redeem the righteous.    Variants       Ismaili faith: A sect of Shia Islam, its adherents are also known as  \"Seveners,\" because they believe that the rightful seventh Imam in  Islamic leadership was Isma'il, the elder son of Imam Jafar al-Sadiq.  Ismaili tradition awaits the return of the seventh Imam as the Mahdi,  or Islamic messianic figure. Ismailis are located in various parts of  the world, particularly South Asia and the Levant.       Alawi faith: Another Shia sect of Islam, the name reflects  followers' devotion to the religious authority of Ali. Alawites are a  closed, secretive religious group who assert they are Shia Muslims,  although outside scholars speculate their beliefs may have a syncretic  mix with other faiths originating in the Middle East. Alawis live  mostly in Syria, Lebanon, and Turkey.       Druze faith: A highly secretive tradition and a closed community  that derives from the Ismaili sect of Islam; its core beliefs are  thought to emphasize a combination of Gnostic principles believing that  the Fatimid caliph, al-Hakin, is the one who embodies the key aspects  of goodness of the universe, which are, the intellect, the word, the  soul, the preceder, and the follower. The Druze have a key presence in  Syria, Lebanon, and Israel.    Jainism - Originating in India, Jain spiritual philosophy believes in  an eternal human soul, the eternal universe, and a principle of \"the  own nature of things.\" It emphasizes compassion for all living things,  seeks liberation of the human soul from reincarnation through  enlightenment, and values personal responsibility due to the belief in  the immediate consequences of one's behavior. Jain philosophy teaches  non-violence and prescribes vegetarianism for monks and laity alike;  its adherents are a highly influential religious minority in Indian  society.    Judaism - One of the first known monotheistic religions, likely dating  to between 2000-1500 B.C., Judaism is the native faith of the Jewish  people, based upon the belief in a covenant of responsibility between a  sole omnipotent creator God and Abraham, the patriarch of Judaism's  Hebrew Bible, or Tanakh. Divine revelation of principles and  prohibitions in the Hebrew Scriptures form the basis of Jewish law, or  halakhah, which is a key component of the faith. While there are  extensive traditions of Jewish halakhic and theological discourse,  there is no final dogmatic authority in the tradition. Local  communities have their own religious leadership. Modern Judaism has  three basic categories of faith: Orthodox, Conservative, and  Reform/Liberal. These differ in their views and observance of Jewish  law, with the Orthodox representing the most traditional practice, and  Reform/Liberal communities the most accommodating of individualized  interpretations of Jewish identity and faith.    Shintoism - A native animist tradition of Japan, Shinto practice is  based upon the premise that every being and object has its own spirit  or kami. Shinto practitioners worship several particular kamis,  including the kamis of nature, and families often have shrines to their  ancestors' kamis. Shintoism has no fixed tradition of prayers or  prescribed dogma, but is characterized by individual ritual. Respect  for the kamis in nature is a key Shinto value. Prior to the end of  World War II, Shinto was the state religion of Japan, and bolstered the  cult of the Japanese emperor.    Sikhism - Founded by the Guru Nanak (born 1469), Sikhism believes in a  non-anthropomorphic, supreme, eternal, creator God; centering one's  devotion to God is seen as a means of escaping the cycle of rebirth.  Sikhs follow the teachings of Nanak and nine subsequent gurus. Their  scripture, the Guru Granth Sahib - also known as the Adi Granth - is  considered the living Guru, or final authority of Sikh faith and  theology. Sikhism emphasizes equality of humankind and disavows caste,  class, or gender discrimination.    Taoism - Chinese philosophy or religion based upon Lao Tzu's Tao Te  Ching, which centers on belief in the Tao, or the way, as the flow of  the universe and the nature of things. Taoism encourages a principle of  non-force, or wu-wei, as the means to live harmoniously with the Tao.  Taoists believe the esoteric world is made up of a perfect harmonious  balance and nature, while in the manifest world - particularly in the  body - balance is distorted. The Three Jewels of the Tao - compassion,  simplicity, and humility - serve as the basis for Taoist ethics.    Zoroastrianism - Originating from the teachings of Zoroaster in about  the 9th or 10th century B.C., Zoroastrianism may be the oldest  continuing creedal religion. Its key beliefs center on a transcendent  creator God, Ahura Mazda, and the concept of free will. The key ethical  tenets of Zoroastrianism expressed in its scripture, the Avesta, are  based on a dualistic worldview where one may prevent chaos if one  chooses to serve God and exercises good thoughts, good words, and good  deeds. Zoroastrianism is generally a closed religion and members are  almost always born to Zoroastrian parents. Prior to the spread of  Islam, Zoroastrianism dominated greater Iran. Today, though a minority,  Zoroastrians remain primarily in Iran, India, and Pakistan.    Reserves of foreign exchange"]]]
