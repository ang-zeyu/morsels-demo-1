Toward two o'clock in the morning Carmen came  back, and was rather surprised to see me.    \"'Come with me,' said I.    \"'Very well,' said she, 'let's be off.'    \"I went and got my horse, and took her up behind me, and we travelled  all the rest of the night without saying a word to each other. When  daylight came we stopped at a lonely inn, not far from a hermitage.  There I said to Carmen:    \"'Listen--I forget everything, I won't mention anything to you. But  swear one thing to me--that you'll come with me to America, and live  there quietly!'    \"'No,' said she, in a sulky voice, 'I won't go to America--I am very  well here.'    \"'That's because you're near Lucas. But be very sure that even if  he gets well now, he won't make old bones. And, indeed, why should I  quarrel with him? I'm tired of killing all your lovers; I'll kill you  this time.'    \"She looked at me steadily with her wild eyes, and then she said:    \"'I've always thought you would kill me. The very first time I saw you I  had just met a priest at the door of my house. And to-night, as we were  going out of Cordova, didn't you see anything? A hare ran across the  road between your horse's feet. It is fate.'    \"'Carmencita,' I asked, 'don't you love me any more?'    \"She gave me no answer, she was sitting cross-legged on a mat, making  marks on the ground with her finger.    \"'Let us change our life, Carmen,' said I imploringly. 'Let us go away  and live somewhere we shall never be parted. You know we have a hundred  and twenty gold ounces buried under an oak not far from here, and then  we have more money with Ben-Joseph the Jew.'    \"She began to smile, and then she said, 'Me first, and then you. I know  it will happen like that.'    \"'Think about it,' said I. 'I've come to the end of my patience and my  courage. Make up your mind--or else I must make up mine.'    \"I left her alone and walked toward the hermitage. I found the hermit  praying. I waited till his prayer was finished. I longed to pray myself,  but I couldn't. When he rose up from his knees I went to him.    \"'Father,' I said, 'will you pray for some one who is in great danger?'    \"'I pray for every one who is afflicted,' he replied.    \"'Can you say a mass for a soul which is perhaps about to go into the  presence of its Maker?'    \"'Yes,' he answered, looking hard at me.    \"And as there was something strange about me, he tried to make me talk.    \"'It seems to me that I have seen you somewhere,' said he.    \"I laid a piastre on his bench.    \"'When shall you say the mass?' said I.    \"'In half an hour. The son of the innkeeper yonder is coming to serve  it. Tell me, young man, haven't you something on your conscience that is  tormenting you? Will you listen to a Christian's counsel?'    \"I could hardly restrain my tears. I told him I would come back, and  hurried away. I went and lay down on the grass until I heard the bell.  Then I went back to the chapel, but I stayed outside it. When he had  said the mass, I went back to the _venta_. I was hoping Carmen would  have fled. She could have taken my horse and ridden away. But I found  her there still. She did not choose that any one should say I had  frightened her. While I had been away she had unfastened the hem of her  gown and taken out the lead that weighted it; and now she was sitting  before a table, looking into a bowl of water into which she had just  thrown the lead she had melted. She was so busy with her spells that at  first she didn't notice my return. Sometimes she would take out a bit of  lead and turn it round every way with a melancholy look. Sometimes she  would sing one of those magic songs, which invoke the help of Maria  Padella, Don Pedro's mistress, who is said to have been the _Bari  Crallisa_--the great gipsy queen.*         * Maria Padella was accused of having bewitched Don Pedro.       According to one popular tradition she presented Queen       Blanche of Bourbon with a golden girdle which, in the eyes       of the bewitched king, took on the appearance of a living       snake. Hence the repugnance he always showed toward the       unhappy princess.    \"'Carmen,' I said to her, 'will you come with me?' She rose, threw away  her wooden bowl, and put her mantilla over her head ready to start. My  horse was led up, she mounted behind me, and we rode away.    \"After we had gone a little distance I said to her, 'So, my Carmen, you  are quite ready to follow me, isn't that so?'    \"She answered, 'Yes, I'll follow you, even to death--but I won't live  with you any more.'    \"We had reached a lonely gorge. I stopped my horse.    \"'Is this the place?' she said.    \"And with a spring she reached the ground. She took off her mantilla and  threw it at her feet, and stood motionless, with one hand on her hip,  looking at me steadily.    \"'You mean to kill me, I see that well,' said she. 'It is fate. But  you'll never make me give in.'    \"I said to her: 'Be rational, I implore you; listen to me. All the  past is forgotten. Yet you know it is you who have been my ruin--it is  because of you that I am a robber and a murderer. Carmen, my Carmen, let  me save you, and save myself with you.'    \"'Jose,' she answered, 'what you ask is impossible. I don't love you  any more. You love me still, and that is why you want to kill me. If  I liked, I might tell you some other lie, but I don't choose to give  myself the trouble. Everything is over between us two. You are my _rom_,  and you have the right to kill your _romi_, but Carmen will always be  free. A _calli_ she was born, and a _calli_ she'll die.'    \"'Then, you love Lucas?' I asked.    \"'Yes, I have loved him--as I loved you--for an instant--less than I  loved you, perhaps. But now I don't love anything, and I hate myself for  ever having loved you.'    \"I cast myself at her feet, I seized her hands, I watered them with my  tears, I reminded her of all the happy moments we had spent together,  I offered to continue my brigand's life, if that would please her.  Everything, sir, everything--I offered her everything if she would only  love me again.    \"She said:    \"'Love you again? That's not possible! Live with you? I will not do it!'    \"I was wild with fury. I drew my knife, I would have had her look  frightened, and sue for mercy--but that woman was a demon.    \"I cried, 'For the last time I ask you. Will you stay with me?'    \"'No! no! no!' she said, and she stamped her foot.    \"Then she pulled a ring I had given her off her finger, and cast it into  the brushwood.    \"I struck her twice over--I had taken Garcia's knife, because I had  broken my own. At the second thrust she fell without a sound. It seems  to me that I can still see her great black eyes staring at me. Then they  grew dim and the lids closed.    \"For a good hour I lay there prostrate beside her corpse. Then I  recollected that Carmen had often told me that she would like to lie  buried in a wood. I dug a grave for her with my knife and laid her in  it. I hunted about a long time for her ring, and I found it at last.  I put it into the grave beside her, with a little cross--perhaps I did  wrong. Then I got upon my horse, galloped to Cordova, and gave myself up  at the nearest guard-room. I told them I had killed Carmen, but I would  not tell them where her body was. That hermit was a holy man! He prayed  for her--he said a mass for her soul. Poor child! It's the _calle_ who  are to blame for having brought her up as they did.\"        CHAPTER IV    Spain is one of the countries in which those nomads, scattered all over  Europe, and known as Bohemians, Gitanas, Gipsies, Ziegeuner, and so  forth, are now to be found in the greatest numbers. Most of these people  live, or rather wander hither and thither, in the southern and eastern  provinces of Spain, in Andalusia, and Estramadura, in the kingdom  of Murcia. There are a great many of them in Catalonia. These last  frequently cross over into France and are to be seen at all our  southern fairs. The men generally call themselves grooms, horse doctors,  mule-clippers; to these trades they add the mending of saucepans and  brass utensils, not to mention smuggling and other illicit practices.  The women tell fortunes, beg, and sell all sorts of drugs, some of which  are innocent, while some are not. The physical characteristics of the  gipsies are more easily distinguished then described, and when you have  known one, you should be able to recognise a member of the race among  a thousand other men. It is by their physiognomy and expression,  especially, that they differ from the other inhabitants of the same  country. Their complexion is exceedingly swarthy, always darker than  that of the race among whom they live. Hence the name of _cale_ (blacks)  which they frequently apply to themselves.* Their eyes, set with a  decided slant, are large, very black, and shaded by long and heavy  lashes. Their glance can only be compared to that of a wild creature. It  is full at once of boldness and shyness, and in this respect their eyes  are a fair indication of their national character, which is cunning,  bold, but with \"the natural fear of blows,\" like Panurge. Most of the  men are strapping fellows, slight and active. I don't think I ever saw  a gipsy who had grown fat. In Germany the gipsy women are often very  pretty; but beauty is very uncommon among the Spanish gitanas. When very  young, they may pass as being attractive in their ugliness, but once  they have reached motherhood, they become absolutely repulsive. The  filthiness of both sexes is incredible, and no one who has not seen a  gipsy matron's hair can form any conception of what it is, not even  if he conjures up the roughest, the greasiest, and the dustiest heads  imaginable. In some of the large Andalusian towns certain of the gipsy  girls, somewhat better looking than their fellows, will take more care  of their personal appearance. These go out and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24652"],[0,"Diversions in Sicily (#12)"],[1,"of the boredom.  It concludes with the defeat and  death of Orlando and the paladins at Roncisvalle.    The portion of the story appointed for the evening's performance was in  five acts, divided into a large number of very short scenes, and if I did  not always know quite clearly what was going on, that was partly due to  the distracting uproar, for nearly every scene contained a fight, and  some contained several, the shortest lasting well over a minute.  Whoever  had been employed to shorten the story would have earned the thanks of  one member of the audience if he had acted upon Pococurante's remarks to  Candide about the works of Homer.  He ought not to have left in so many  combats; they were as like one another and as tedious as those in the  _Iliad_, besides being much noisier, at least we are not told that the  Homeric heroes were accompanied by a muscular pianist, fully armed, and  by the incessant stamping of clogged boots.  Nevertheless the majority of  the audience enjoyed the fights, for no Sicilian objects to noise.    This is what I gathered: Angelica had come from far Cathay with the  express intention of sowing discord among the paladins by inducing them  to fall in love with her, and at the present moment Sacripante and the  Duca d'Avilla were her victims.  These two knights met in a wood, raised  their vizors and talked matters over; there was to be a fight about it,  of course, but the preliminaries were to be conducted in a friendly  spirit--like a test case in Chancery.  They separated, no doubt to give  them an opportunity of going home to make their wills and take leave of  their wives and families, if any.  In the second scene they met again,  lowered their vizors, drew their swords and fought till Angelica  supervened.  In the next scene the two knights and Angelica were joined  by Medoro with whom one of the knights fought.  I recognized Medoro when  his vizor was up because he was a black man, but Sacripante and the Duca  d'Avilla were so much alike that I did not know which was fighting and  which was standing with Angelica looking on; say it was Sacripante that  was fighting, being king of the Circassians he was probably entitled to  precedence over a mere duke.  Angelica, after some time, began to feel  qualms of conscience, so she interrupted and mentioned who Medoro really  was.  Sacripante, in the most chivalrous manner, immediately desisted and  apologized--he had failed to recognize his opponent and had no idea he  had been fighting with the lady's husband.  The apology was accepted in  the spirit in which it was offered, all accusations, expressed or  implied, were withdrawn, and friendly relations established.  The four  then set out together to pass the night in an albergo.  Angelica,  however, with her quick, womanly instinct, mistrusted the knights and,  taking her husband aside, proposed that they two should depart by stealth  and escape to Cathay, leaving Sacripante and the Duca d'Avilla asleep.  Medoro demurred, saying it was a very good inn and he was quite  comfortable where he was.  So she told him a few facts which alarmed him  to such a degree that he consented and they decamped.    On their way they encountered Ferrau who entered with a stamp of the  foot, sforzando, attacked Medoro and killed him dead, thus obtaining  possession of Angelica according to the play-bill.  But she managed to  get free and appeared upon the coast where she met a sea-captain and,  telling him she was very rich, made terms with him, bought his vessel and  embarked for the Court of her father, Galafrone.  She might have made  better terms had she not opened negotiations by telling him she was very  rich, but it was a matter of life or death and she was reckless, knowing  that Ferrau was after her.  Sacripante and the Duca d'Avilla were after  Ferrau and presently caught him up and attacked him.  He fought with them  both at once and killed one of them in a minute and a half.  With the  exception of myself, every one in the theatre knew which he killed, for  they knew all the knights as they came on.  Let us again give Sacripante  the precedence and suppose that he was killed first.  Ferrau went on  fighting with the Duca d'Avilla and both were hard at work when the  curtain fell.    It rose again, very effectively, on the continuation of the fight, and  almost at once Ferrau cut off the Duca d'Avilla's head which rolled about  on the stage.  Immediately there came three Turks; Ferrau stabbed each as  he entered--one, two, three--and their bodies encumbered the ground as  the curtain fell.    It rose as soon as the bodies had been removed and disclosed Ferrau  stamping about alone.  There came three more Turks; he stabbed them each  as they entered--one, two, three--and their bodies encumbered the ground.  Then there came three knights in armour; Ferrau fought them all three  together for a very considerable time and it was deafening.  He killed  them all and their bodies encumbered the ground with those of the last  three Turks.  It was a bloody sight that met the eyes of Galafrone who  now entered.    The curtain fell, while Galafrone had the corpses cleared away, and rose  again on the same scene which was the ante-chamber of Angelica's  bedroom--for somehow we were now in her father's dominions, and it was  she who had sent the knights and the Turks to kill Ferrau before he could  approach her.  Then there was an interview between Ferrau and Galafrone  on the subject of Angelica.  The knight, having made her a widow, now  wished to make her his wife, the king saw no objection and promised to  use his influence with his daughter.    The scene changed to Angelica's bedroom; her bed was at the far end of  the stage with a patchwork quilt over it, but there was no other  furniture in the room except a sofa near the front.  Her father brought  her in and I, knowing that she was to kill herself personally and that  this must be her last entry, examined her closely and detected a string  passing through her right hand and ending in the hilt of a dagger  ostentatiously concealed in her bosom.  Of course I knew what that meant.  Her father, true to his promise, began to urge Ferrau's suit, saying that  he had forgiven him for having killed Medoro.  But Angelica had not  forgiven him, and moreover she hated Ferrau with his bloodshot eyes and  his explosive manners.  She made a long speech, admirably delivered by  the cobbler and as full of noble sentiments as a poem by Mrs. Browning,  then, suddenly drawing her dagger with the string, she stabbed herself  and fell dead on the couch, exclaiming--    \"A rivederci.\"    It was an extremely neat suicide and her father concluded the  entertainment by weeping over her body.    These marionettes were not nearly so comic in their movements as the  life-sized ones in Catania, not because they were better managed, but  because they attempted less and because, being so small, their defects  were less obvious.  A small one may, and generally does, enter like a  bird alighting on a molehill, but he has such a short distance to go that  he is at rest before one realizes that he has not attempted to walk.  Besides it is a mode of progression we are all familiar with, having  practised it in dreams since childhood.  A life-sized marionette, on a  larger stage, has, perhaps, two or three yards to traverse; he tries to  take steps and is easily caught tripping, for without strings to his feet  his steps can only be done in a haphazard way.  There are marionettes  with strings to their feet, and though they may do _The Story of the  Paladins_, this is not their usual business, they are more elaborately  articulated, and are intended for operas, ballets and other complicated  things.    And then, again, in Catania a glimpse of the hand of an operator or of  some one standing in the wings offended at once as a blot on the  performance.  But looking at the small figures at Trapani one accepted  them almost immediately as men and women, and forgot all about absolute  size, so that when the hand of an operator appeared and it was larger  than the head of a marionette, it seemed to belong to another world,  while a real man standing in the wings could not be seen above his knees,  and it required a mental effort to connect his boots and trousers in any  way with the performance.    The speaker at Catania did well with a good voice; nevertheless one felt  that disaster was in the neighbourhood and was being consciously avoided.  The idea of failure never crossed the mind of the cobbler from Mount  Eryx.  His voice was rich and flexible, full of variety and quick to  express a thousand emotions.  Listening to it was like looking long and  long into a piece of Sicilian amber in whose infinite depth, as you turn  it about in the sunlight, you see all the colours of the rainbow, from  red, through orange, yellow, green and blue, even to a glowing purple.  There was nothing he could not do with it, and he managed it with the  quiet dignity and easy grace of a young lion at play.        CHAPTER VII--THE DEATH OF BRADAMANTE      Before the last act, which concluded with the death of Angelica, a dwarf  had appeared in front of the curtain (not a human dwarf, but a marionette  dwarf) and recited the programme for the following day, stating that the  performance would terminate with the death of Ferrau.  Unfortunately I  was not able to witness his end, but I went to the teatrino the evening  after.  We arrived early and began by inspecting the programme--        Carlo ottiene piena vittoria contro Marsilio--      Fuga di costui e presa di Barcelona--      Marfisa trova Bradamante che more fra le sue braccia.        Charles obtains complete victory over Marsilio--      Flight of the latter and taking of Barcelona--      Marfisa finds Bradamante who dies in her arms.    We then went behind the scenes to spend some time among the puppets  before the play began.  First I"]]]
