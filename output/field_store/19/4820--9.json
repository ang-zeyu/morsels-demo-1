All at once, as if by a sudden inundation, the very scum of the earth  appeared to spread over Janina. The populace, as if trying to drown  their misery, plunged into a drunkenness which simulated pleasure.  Disorderly bands of mountebanks from the depths of Roumelia traversed  the streets, the bazaars and public places; flocks and herds, with  fleeces dyed scarlet, and gilded horns, were seen on all the roads  driven to the court by peasants under the guidance of their priests.  Bishops, abbots, ecclesiastics generally, were compelled to drink, and  to take part in ridiculous and indecent dances, Ali apparently thinking  to raise himself by degrading his more respectable subjects. Day and  night these spectacles succeeded each other with increasing rapidity,  the air resounded with firing, songs, cries, music, and the roaring of  wild beasts in shows. Enormous spits, loaded with meat, smoked before  huge braziers, and wine ran in floods at tables prepared in the palace  courts. Troops of brutal soldiers drove workmen from their labour with  whips, and compelled them to join in the entertainments; dirty and  impudent jugglers invaded private houses, and pretending that they had  orders from the pacha to display their skill, carried boldly off  whatever they could lay their hands upon. Ali saw the general  demoralization with pleasure, especially as it tended to the  gratification of his avarice, Every guest was expected to bring to the  palace gate a gift in proportion to his means, and foot officers watched  to see that no one forgot this obligation. At length, on the nineteenth  day, Ali resolved to crown the feast by an orgy worthy of himself. He  caused the galleries and halls of his castle by the lake to be decorated  with unheard-of splendour, and fifteen hundred guests assembled for a  solemn banquet. The pacha appeared in all his glory, surrounded by his  noble attendants and courtiers, and seating himself on a dais raised  above this base crowd which trembled at his glance, gave the signal to  begin. At his voice, vice plunged into its most shameless diversions,  and the wine-steeped wings of debauchery outspread themselves over the  feast. All tongues were at their freest, all imaginations ran wild, all  evil passions were at their height, when suddenly the noise ceased, and  the guests clung together in terror. A man stood at the entrance of the  hall, pale, disordered, and wild-eyed, clothed in torn and blood-stained  garments. As everyone made way at his approach, he easily reached the  pacha, and prostrating himself at his feet, presented a letter. Ali  opened and rapidly perused it; his lips trembled, his eyebrows met in a  terrible frown, the muscles of his forehead contracted alarmingly. He  vainly endeavoured to smile and to look as if nothing had happened, his  agitation betrayed him, and he was obliged to retire, after desiring a  herald to announce that he wished the banquet to continue.    Now for the subject of the message, and the cause of the dismay it  produced.          CHAPTER VI      Ali had long cherished a violent passion for Zobeide, the wife of his  son Veli Pacha: Having vainly attempted to gratify it after his son's  departure, and being indignantly repulsed, he had recourse to drugs, and  the unhappy Zobeide remained in ignorance of her misfortune until she  found she was pregnant. Then, half-avowals from her women, compelled to  obey the pacha from fear of death, mixed with confused memories of her  own, revealed the whole terrible truth. Not knowing in her despair which  way to turn, she wrote to Ali, entreating him to visit the harem. As  head of the family, he had a right to enter, being supposed responsible  for the conduct of his sons' families, no-law-giver having hitherto  contemplated the possibility of so disgraceful a crime. When he  appeared, Zobeide flung herself at his feet, speechless with grief. Ali  acknowledged his guilt, pleaded the violence of his passion, wept with  his victim, and entreating her to control herself and keep silence,  promised that all should be made right. Neither the prayers nor tears of  Zobeide could induce him to give up the intention of effacing the traces  of his first crime by a second even more horrible.    But the story was already whispered abroad, and Pacho Bey learnt all its  details from the spies he kept in Janina. Delighted at the prospect of  avenging himself on the father, he hastened with his news to the son.  Veli Pacha, furious, vowed vengeance, and demanded Pacho Bey's help,  which was readily promised. But Ali had been warned, and was not a man  to be taken unawares. Pacho Bey, whom Veli had just promoted to the  office of sword-bearer, was attacked in broad daylight by six emissaries  sent from Janina. He obtained timely help, however, and five of the  assassins, taken red-handed, were at once hung without ceremony in the  market-place. The sixth was the messenger whose arrival with the news  had caused such dismay at Ali's banquet.    As Ali reflected how the storm he had raised could best be laid, he was  informed that the ruler of the marriage feast sent by Moustai, Pacha of  Scodra, to receive the young bride who should reign in his harem, had  just arrived in the plain of Janina. He was Yussuf Bey of the Delres, an  old enemy of Ali's, and had encamped with his escort of eight hundred  warriors at the foot of Tomoros of Dodona. Dreading some treachery, he  absolutely refused all entreaties to enter the town, and Ali seeing that  it was useless to insist, and that his adversary for the present was  safe, at once sent his grand-daughter, the Princess of Aulis, out to  him.    This matter disposed of, Ali was able to attend to his hideous family  tragedy. He began by effecting the disappearance of the women whom he  had been compelled to make his accomplices; they were simply sewn up in  sacks by gipsies and thrown into the lake. This done, he himself led the  executioners into a subterranean part of the castle, where they were  beheaded by black mutes as a reward for their obedience. He then sent a  doctor to Zobeide; who succeeded in causing a miscarriage, and who, his  work done, was seized and strangled by the black mutes who had just  beheaded the gipsies. Having thus got rid of all who could bear witness  to his crime, he wrote to Veli that he might now send for his wife and  two of his children, hitherto detained as hostages, and that the  innocence of Zobeide would confound a calumniator who had dared to  assail him with such injurious suspicions.    When this letter arrived, Pacho Bey, distrusting equally the treachery  of the father and the weakness of the son, and content with having sown  the seeds of dissension in his enemy's family, had sufficient wisdom to  seek safety in flight. Ali, furious, vowed, on hearing this, that his  vengeance should overtake him even at the ends of the earth. Meanwhile  he fell back on Yussuf Bey of the Debres, whose escape when lately at  Janina still rankled in his mind. As Yussuf was dangerous both from  character and influence, Ali feared to attack him openly, and sought to  assassinate him. This was not precisely easy; for, exposed to a thousand  dangers of this kind, the nobles of that day were on their guard. Steel  and poison were used up, and another way had to be sought. Ali found it.    One of the many adventurers with whom Janina was filled penetrated to  the pacha's presence, and offered to sell the secret of a powder whereof  three grains would suffice to kill a man with a terrible  explosion--explosive powder, in short. Ali heard with delight, but  replied that he must see it in action before purchasing.    In the dungeons of the castle by the lake, a poor monk of the order of  St. Basil was slowly dying, for having boldly refused a sacrilegious  simony proposed to him by Ali. He was a fit subject for the experiment,  and was successfully blown to pieces, to the great satisfaction of Ali,  who concluded his bargain, and hastened to make use of it. He prepared a  false firman, which, according to custom, was enclosed and sealed in a  cylindrical case, and sent to Yussuf Bey by a Greek, wholly ignorant of  the real object of his mission. Opening it without suspicion, Yussuf had  his arm blown off, and died in consequence, but found time to despatch a  message to Moustai Pacha of Scodra, informing him of the catastrophe,  and warning him to keep good guard.    Yussuf's letter was received by Moustai just as a similar infernal  machine was placed in his hands under cover to his young wife. The  packet was seized, and a careful examination disclosed its nature. The  mother of Moustai, a jealous and cruel woman, accused her  daughter-in-law of complicity, and the unfortunate Ayesha, though  shortly to become a mother, expired in agony from the effects of poison,  only guilty of being the innocent instrument of her grandfather's  treachery.    Fortune having frustrated Ali's schemes concerning Moustai Pacha,  offered him as consolation a chance of invading the territory of Parga,  the only place in Epirus which had hitherto escaped his rule, and which  he greedily coveted. Agia, a small Christian town on the coast, had  rebelled against him and allied itself to Parga. It provided an excuse  for hostilities, and Ali's troops, under his son Mouktar, first seized  Agia, where they only found a few old men to massacre, and then marched  on Parga, where the rebels had taken refuge. After a few skirmishes,  Mouktar entered the town, and though the Parganiotes fought bravely,  they must inevitably have surrendered had they been left to themselves.  But they had sought protection from the French, who had garrisoned the  citadel, and the French grenadiers descending rapidly from the height,  charged the Turks with so much fury that they fled in all directions,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27558"],[0,"The 2003 CIA World Factbook (#12)"],[1,"ntarctic, and undersea. Its decisions enable all departments  and agencies of the US Government to have access to uniform names of  geographic features. The position of the BGN is that the names Burma  and Sea of Japan be used in official US Government maps and  publications.    Why is most of the statistical information in the Factbook given in  metric units, rather than the units standard to US measure?    US Federal agencies are required by the Metric Conversion Act of 1975  (Public Law 94-168) and by Executive Order 12770 of July 1991 to use  the International System of Units, commonly referred to as the metric  system or SI. In addition, the metric system is used by over 95 percent  of the world's population.    Why don't you include information on minimum and maximum temperature  extremes?    The Factbook staff judges that this information would only be useful  for some (generally smaller) countries. Larger countries can have large  temperature extremes that do not represent the landmass as a whole. In  the future, such a category may be adopted listing the extremes, but  also adding a normal temperature range found throughout most of a  country's territory.    What information sources are used for the country flags?    Flag designs used in The World Factbook are those recognized by the  protocol office of the US Department of State.    Why do your GDP (Gross Domestic Product) statistics differ from other  sources?    GDP dollar estimates in The World Factbook are derived from purchasing  power parity (PPP) calculations. See the Notes and Definitions section  on GDP methodology for more information.    On the CIA Web site, Chiefs of State is updated weekly, but the last  update for the Factbook was an earlier date. Why the discrepancy?    Although Chiefs of State and The World Factbook both appear on the CIA  Web site, they are produced and updated by separate staffs. Chiefs of  State includes fewer countries but more leaders, and is updated more  frequently than The World Factbook, which has a much larger database,  and includes all countries.    Some percentage distributions do not add to 100. Why not?    Because of rounding, percentage distributions do not always add  precisely to 100%. Rounding of numbers always results in a loss of  precision--i.e., error. This error becomes apparent when percentage data  are totaled, as the following two examples show:                      Original Data        Rounded to whole integer      Example 1       43.2                 43                    30.4                 30                    26.4                 26                    ----                 --                   100.0                 99      Example 2       42.8                 43                    31.6                 32                    25.6                 26                    ----                 --                   100.0                101    When this occurs, we do not force the numbers to add exactly to 100,  because doing so would introduce additional error into the  distribution.    What rounding convention does The World Factbook use?    In deciding on the number of digits to present, the Factbook staff  assesses the accuracy of the original data and the needs of US  Government officials. All of the economic data are processed by  computer--either at the source or by the Factbook staff. The economic  data presented in The Factbook, therefore, follow the rounding  convention used by virtually all numerical software applications,  namely, any digit followed by a \"5\" is rounded up to the next higher  digit, no matter whether the original digit is even or odd. Thus, for  example, when rounded to the nearest integer, 2.5 becomes 3, rather  than 2, as occurred in some pre-computer rounding systems.      Technical    Does The World Factbook comply with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation  Act regarding accessibility of Web pages?    The World Factbook home page has a link entitled \"Text/Low Bandwidth  Version.\" The country data in the text version is fully accessible. We  believe The World Factbook is compliant with the Section 508 law in  both fact and spirit. If you are experiencing difficulty, please use  our comment form to provide us details of the specific problem you are  experiencing and the assistive software and/or hardware that you are  using so that we can work with our technical support staff to find and  implement a solution. We welcome visitors' suggestions to improve  accessibility of The World Factbook and the CIA Web site.    I am using the Factbook online and it is not working. What is wrong?    Hundreds of \"Factbook\" look-alikes exist on the Internet. The Factbook  site at: www.cia.gov is the only official site.    When I attempt to download a PDF (Portable Document Format) map file  (or some other map) the file has no image. Can you fix this?    Some of the files on The World Factbook Web site are large and could  take several minutes to download on a dial-up connection. The screen  might be blank during the download process.    When I open a map on The World Factbook site, it is fuzzy or granular,  or too big or too small. Why?    Adjusting the resolution setting on your monitor should correct this  problem.    Is The World Factbook country data available in machine-readable  format? All I can find is HTML, but I'm looking for simple tabular  data.    The Factbook Web site now features \"Rank Order\" pages for selected  Factbook entries. \"Rank Order\" pages are available for those data  fields identified with a small bar chart icon located next to the title  of the data entry. In addition, all of the \"Rank Order\" pages can be  downloaded as tab-delimited data files that can be opened in other  applications such as spreadsheets and databases.

The Soviet Union invaded in 1979, but was forced to withdraw    10 years later by anti-Communist mujahidin forces supplied and    trained by the US, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, and others. Fighting    subsequently continued among the various mujahidin factions, giving    rise to a state of warlordism that eventually spawned the Taliban.    Backed by foreign sponsors, the Taliban developed as a political    force and eventually seized power. The Taliban were able to capture    most of the country, aside from Northern Alliance strongholds    primarily in the northeast, until US and allied military action in    support of the opposition following the 11 September 2001 terrorist    attacks forced the group's downfall. In late 2001, major leaders    from the Afghan opposition groups and diaspora met in Bonn, Germany,    and agreed on a plan for the formulation of a new government    structure that resulted in the inauguration of Hamid KARZAI as    Chairman of the Afghan Interim Authority (AIA) on 22 December 2001.    The AIA held a nationwide Loya Jirga (Grand Assembly) in June 2002,    and KARZAI was elected President by secret ballot of the    Transitional Islamic State of Afghanistan (TISA). The Transitional    Authority has an 18-month mandate to hold a nationwide Loya Jirga to    adopt a constitution and a 24-month mandate to hold nationwide    elections. In December 2002, the TISA marked the one-year    anniversary of the fall of the Taliban. In addition to occasionally    violent political jockeying and ongoing military action to root out    remaining terrorists and Taliban elements, the country suffers from    enormous poverty, a crumbling infrastructure, and widespread land    mines.
