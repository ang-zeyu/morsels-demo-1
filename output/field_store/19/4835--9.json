And he into whose right hand his Book shall be given,    Shall be reckoned with in an easy reckoning,    And shall turn, rejoicing, to his kindred.    But he whose Book shall be given him behind his back2    Shall invoke destruction:    But in the fire shall he burn,    For that he lived joyously among his kindred,    Without a thought that he should return to God.    Yea, but his Lord beheld him.

And those that dash off sparks of fire!    And those that scour to the attack at morn!    And stir therein the dust aloft;    And cleave therein their midway through a host!    Truly, Man is to his Lord ungrateful.    And of this he is himself a witness;    And truly, he is vehement in the love of this world's good.    Ah! knoweth he not, that when that which is in the graves shall be laid bare,    And that which is in men's breasts shall be brought forth,    Verily their Lord shall on that day be informed concerning them?      SURA LXXIX.1-THOSE WHO DRAG FORTH [XXXV.]    MECCA.-46 Verses    In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful    By those angels who DRAG FORTH souls with violence,    And by those who with joyous release release them;    By those who swim swimmingly along;    By those who are foremost with foremost speed;2    By those who conduct the affairs of the universe!    One day, the disturbing trumpet-blast shall disturb it,    Which the second blast shall follow:    Men's hearts on that day shall quake:-    Their looks be downcast.    The infidels will say, \"Shall we indeed be restored as at first?    What! when we have become rotten bones?\"    \"This then,\" say they, \"will be a return to loss.\"    Verily, it will be but a single blast,    And lo! they are on the surface of the earth.    Hath the story of Moses reached thee?    When his Lord called to him in Towa's holy vale:    Go to Pharaoh, for he hath burst all bounds:    And say, \"Wouldest thou become just?    Then I will guide thee to thy Lord that thou mayest fear him.\"    And he showed him a great miracle,-    But he treated him as an impostor, and rebelled;    Then turned he his back all hastily,    And gathered an assembly and proclaimed,    And said, \"I am your Lord supreme.\"    So God visited on him the punishment of this life and of the other.    Verily, herein is a lesson for him who hath the fear of God.    Are ye the harder to create, or the heaven which he hath built?    He reared its height and fashioned it,    And gave darkness to its night, and brought out its light,    And afterwards stretched forth the earth,-    He brought forth from it its waters and its pastures;    And set the mountains firm    For you and your cattle to enjoy.    But when the grand overthrow shall come,    The day when a man shall reflect on the pains that he hath taken,    And Hell shall be in full view of all who are looking on;    Then, as for him who hath transgressed    And hath chosen this present life,    Verily, Hell-that shall be his dwelling-place:    But as to him who shall have feared the majesty of his Lord, and shall have  refrained his soul from lust,    Verily, Paradise-that shall be his dwelling-place.    They will ask thee of \"the Hour,\" when will be its fixed time?    But what knowledge hast thou of it?    Its period is known only to thy Lord;    And thou art only charged with the warning of those who fear it.    On the day when they shall see it, it shall seem to them as though they had  not tarried in the tomb, longer than its evening or its morn.      _______________________    1 This Sura obviously consists of three portions, verses 1-14, 15-26, 27-46,  of which the third is the latest in point of style, and the second, more  detailed than is usual in the Suras of the early period, which allude to  Jewish and other legend only in brief and vague terms. It may therefore be  considered as one of the short and early Suras.    2 Or, By those angels which precede, i.e., the souls of the pious into  Paradise.

When the stars, therefore, shall be blotted out,    And when the heaven shall be cleft,    And when the mountains shall be scattered in dust,    And when the Apostles shall have a time assigned them;    Until what day shall that time be deferred?    To the day of severing!    And who shall teach thee what the day of severing is?    Woe on that day to those who charged with imposture!    Have we not destroyed them of old?    We will next cause those of later times to follow them.2    Thus deal we with the evil doers.    Woe on that day to those who charged with imposture!    Have we not created you of a sorry germ,    Which we laid up in a secure place,    Till the term decreed for birth?    Such is our power! and, how powerful are We!    Woe on that day to those who charged with imposture!    Have we not made the earth to hold    The living and the dead?    And placed on it the tall firm mountains, and given you to drink of sweet  water.    Woe on that day to those who charged with imposture!    Begone to that Hell which ye called a lie:-    Begone to the shadows that lie in triple masses;    \"But not against the flame shall they shade or help you:\"-    The sparks which it casteth out are like towers-    Like tawny camels.    Woe on that day to those who charged with imposture!    On that day they shall not speak,    Nor shall it be permitted them to allege excuses.    Woe on that day to those who charged with imposture!    This is the day of severing, when we will assemble you and your ancestors.    If now ye have any craft try your craft on me.

Go straight along, I beg of  you! Our nest is right under this bank!\" And one glance under the bank  showed that I had not misinterpreted his demonstrations. For all that, I  do not feel like taking a lofty tone in passing judgment upon Junco. He  is not the only one whose wisdom is mixed with foolishness. There is at  least one other person of whom the same is true,--a person of whom I  have nevertheless a very good opinion, and with whom I am, or ought to  be, better acquainted than I am with any animal that wears feathers.    The prettiest snow-bird's nest I ever saw was built beside the Crawford  bridle path, on Mount Clinton, just before the path comes out of the  woods at the top. It was lined with hair-moss (a species of  _Polytrichum_) of a bright orange color, and with its four or five  white, lilac-spotted eggs made so attractive a picture that I was  constrained to pause a moment to look at it, even though I had three  miles of a steep, rough footpath to descend, with a shower threatening  to overtake me before I could reach the bottom. I wondered whether the  architects really possessed an eye for color, or had only stumbled upon  this elegant bit of decoration. On the whole, it seemed more charitable  to conclude the former; and not only more charitable, but more  scientific as well. For, if I understand the matter aright, Mr. Darwin  and his followers have settled upon the opinion that birds do display an  unmistakable fondness for bright tints; that, indeed, the males of many  species wear brilliant plumage for no other reason than that their mates  prefer them in that dress. Moreover, if a bird in New South Wales adorns  her bower with shells and other ornaments, why may not our little  Northern darling beautify her nest with such humbler materials as her  surroundings offer? On reflection, I am more and more convinced that the  birds knew what they were doing; probably the female the moment she  discovered the moss, called to her mate, \"Oh, look, how lovely! Do, my  dear, let's line our nest with it!\"    This artistic structure was found on the anniversary of the battle of  Bunker Hill, a day which I had been celebrating, as best I could, by  climbing the highest hill in New England. Plunging into the woods within  fifty yards of the Crawford House, I had gone up and up, and on and on,  through a magnificent forest, and then over more magnificent rocky  heights, until I stood at last on the platform of the hotel at the  summit. True, the path, which I had never traveled before, was wet and  slippery, with stretches of ice and snow here and there; but the  shifting view was so grand, the atmosphere so bracing, and the solitude  so impressive that I enjoyed every step, till it came to clambering up  the Mount Washington cone over the bowlders. At this point, to speak  frankly, I began to hope that the ninth mile would prove to be a short  one. The guide-books are agreed in warning the visitor against making  this ascent without a companion, and no doubt they are right in so  doing. A crippling accident would almost inevitably be fatal, while for  several miles the trail is so indistinct that it would be difficult, if  not impossible, to follow it in a fog. And yet, if one is willing to  take the risk (and is not so unfortunate as never to have learned how to  keep himself company), he will find a very considerable compensation in  the peculiar pleasure to be experienced in being absolutely alone above  the world. For myself, I was shut up to going in this way or not going  at all; and a Bostonian must do something patriotic on the Seventeenth  of June. But for all that, if the storm which chased me down the  mountains in the afternoon, clouding first Mount Washington and then  Mount Pleasant behind me, and shutting me in-doors all the next day, had  started an hour sooner, or if I had been detained an hour later, it is  not impossible that I might now be writing in a different strain.    My reception at the top was none of the heartiest. The hotel was tightly  closed, while a large snow-bank stood guard before the door. However, I  invited myself into the Signal Service Station, and made my wants known  to one of the officers, who very kindly spread a table with such things  as he and his companions had just been eating. It would be out of place  to say much about the luncheon: the bread and butter were good, and the  pudding was interesting. I had the cook's word for it that the latter  was made of corn-starch, but he volunteered no explanation of its color,  which was nearly that of chocolate. As a working hypothesis I adopted  the molasses or brown-sugar theory, but a brief experiment (as brief as  politeness permitted) indicated a total absence of any saccharine  principle. But then, what do we climb mountains for, if not to see  something out of the common course? On the whole, if this department of  our national government is ever on trial for extravagance in the matter  of high living, I shall be moved to offer myself as a competent witness  for the defense.    A company of chimney-swifts were flying criss-cross over the summit, and  one of the men said that he presumed they lived there. I took the  liberty to doubt his opinion, however. To me it seemed nothing but a  blunder that they should be there even for an hour. There could hardly  be many insects at that height, I thought, and I had abundant cause to  know that the woods below were full of them. I knew, also, that the  swifts knew it; for while I had been prowling about between Crawford's  and Fabyan's, they had several times shot by my head so closely that I  had instinctively fallen to calculating the probable consequences of a  collision. But, after all, the swift is no doubt a far better  entomologist than I am, though he has never heard of Packard's Guide.  Possibly there are certain species of insects, and those of a peculiarly  delicate savor, which are to be obtained only at about this altitude.    The most enjoyable part of the Crawford path is the five miles from the  top of Mount Clinton to the foot of the Mount Washington cone. Along  this ridge I was delighted to find in blossom two beautiful Alpine  plants, which I had missed in previous (July) visits,--the diapensia  (_Diapensia Lapponica_) and the Lapland rose-bay (_Rhododendron  Lapponicum_),--and to get also a single forward specimen of _Potentilla  frigida_. Here and there was a humblebee, gathering honey from the small  purple catkins of the prostrate willows, now in full bloom. (Rather  high-minded humblebees, they seemed, more than five thousand feet above  the sea!) Professional entomologists (the chimney-swift, perhaps,  included) may smile at my simplicity, but I was surprised to find this  \"animated torrid zone,\" this \"insect lover of the sun,\" in such a  Greenland climate. Did he not know that his own poet had, described him  as \"hot midsummer's petted crone\"? But possibly he was equally surprised  at my appearance. He might even have taken his turn at quoting  Emerson:--        \"Pants up hither the spruce clerk      From South Cove and City Wharf\"?[13]    Of the two, he was unquestionably the more at home, for he was living  where in forty-eight hours I should have found my death. So much is  _Bombus_ better than a man.    In a little pool of water, which seemed to be nothing but a transient  puddle caused by the melting snow, was a tiny fish. I asked him by what  miracle he got there, but he could give no explanation. He, too, might  well enough have joined the noble company of Emersonians:--        \"I never thought to ask, I never knew;      But, in my simple ignorance, suppose      The self-same Power that brought me here brought you.\"    Almost at the very top of Mount Clinton I was saluted by the familiar  ditty of the Nashville warbler. I could hardly believe my ears; but  there was no mistake, for the bird soon appeared in plain sight. Had it  been one of the hardier-seeming species, the yellow-rumped for example,  I should not have thought it very strange; but this dainty  _Helminthophaga_, so common in the vicinity of Boston, did appear to be  out of his latitude, summering here on Alpine heights. With a good pair  of wings, and the whole continent to choose from, he surely might have  found some more congenial spot than this in which to bring up his little  family. I took his presence to be only an individual freak, but a  subsequent visitor, who made the ascent from the Glen, reported the same  species on that side also, and at about the same height.    These signs of life on bleak mountain ridges are highly interesting and  suggestive. The fish, the humblebees, the birds, and a mouse which  scampered away to its hole amid the rocks,--all these might have found  better living elsewhere. But Nature will have her world full. Stunted  life is better than none, she thinks. So she plants her forests of  spruces, and keeps them growing, where, with all their efforts, they  cannot get above the height of a man's knee. There is no beauty about  them, no grace. They sacrifice symmetry and everything else for the sake  of bare existence, reminding one of Satan's remark, \"All that a man hath  will he give for his life.\"    Very admirable are the devices by which vegetation maintains itself  against odds. Everybody notices that many of the mountain species, like  the diapensia, the rose-bay, the Greenland sandwort (called the mountain  daisy by the Summit House people, for some inscrutable reason), and the  phyllodoce, have blossoms disproportionately large and handsome; as if  they realized that, in order to attract their indispensable allies, the  insects, to these inhospitable regions, they must offer them some  special inducements. Their case is not unlike that of a certain mountain  hotel which might be named, which happens to be poorly"]]]
