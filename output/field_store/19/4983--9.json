Whereupon this enterprising officer  prepared to enter the Transvaal, whither he was driven, not by the  enemy, but by drought. On the 1st of December he started from Tuli with  a force of mounted men, and, after hairbreadth escapes, in four or five  days reached a place some fifty miles north of Petersburg, the chief  town in the north of the South African Republic. He also proceeded down  the railway line towards Mafeking, but was continually harassed by the  enemy, and continually obliged to retrace his steps owing to lack of  water and other insuperable difficulties. Here we must leave him for a  time.    The Boers, learning that necessity is the mother of invention, and  finding they could not get into Mafeking, were obliged to communicate  with the Baden-Powell \"braves\" in an original manner. They fired into  the town a five-pounder shell, which failed to explode. It was examined,  opened, and discovered to contain the following jocose epistle:--\"Dear  Powell,--Excuse an iron messenger. There is no other means of  communicating. Please tell Mrs. -- Mother and family all well. Don't  drink all the whisky. Leave some for us when we get in.\" This was a  little piece of innocent diversion compared to other experiences. On the  following day a shell from a Boer 100-pounder struck a store, sending  its splinters far and wide, and carrying devastation in its wake. Daily  some tragic episode was the result of a well-directed shot, some white  or black inhabitant was left a mangled, hopeless wreck--a pathetic  fortuitous atom blown to the winds by the blast of war. In addition to  the intermittent uproar of the heavy guns, heaven's thunders at times  broke out, with copious showers of rain, and one of these, on the 5th,  was so violent that it flooded out the trenches, and made all bomb-proof  shelters untenable. Trouble and discomfort were as far as possible  relieved with great energy by Lord Edward Cecil and others, but the  effects of the inundation were not easily removed. Brisk engagements  between the sharpshooters on either side now formed part of a morning  and evening programme, and the Protectorate Regiment, under Lord Charles  Bentinck, did such good service that the enemy grew shy of approach, and  concluded that the process of starving out the garrison would be more  comfortable than shelling so vigorous and retaliative a community.    On the 10th of December the Dutchman Viljoen, who was a prisoner, was  exchanged for Lady Sarah Wilson. The story of this enterprising lady is  one of remarkable interest. In the beginning of the siege she left  Mafeking and rode to Setlagoli Hotel, where she arrived on the same  night. No sooner was she asleep than the rattle and roar of musketry  commenced. This was afterwards discovered to be the gallant fight of  Lieutenant Nesbitt on the armoured train, which has been described in  the opening story of the siege. Poor Nesbitt, it may be remembered, was  taken prisoner. Lady Sarah, a day or two after the fight, rode to the  scene of the engagement and photographed the wreck. Later on, this  intrepid lady moved from Mosuti to the care of a colonial farmer, and  with great difficulty and much expenditure of energy and coin, she  managed to induce the natives to provide her with information. All this  time she and her friends were subject to the insults of the Boers. At  one period she was declared to be the sole survivor of Mafeking, in  hiding in the disguise of a woman. At another, she was believed to be  the wife of one of the British generals. Others declared that the  extraordinary lady was a member of the Royal Family, who was acting as  spy on the doings of the Boers in the Colony. After moving to Vryburg,  life for her became more exciting still. A young Boer passed her off as  his sister, and some loyalists in the town gave her shelter, and helped  her to obtain official despatches and news. But her state was far from  comfortable, for most of her excursions had to be made under the shadow  of night, and her days were spent enclosed in a room at the hotel. When  Lady Sarah desired to leave the town, her exit was not so easy. The  magistrates had issued orders that no one was to leave, and but for the  kindness of her \"brother Boer,\" she might not have been able to depart.  Their journey was commenced at four in the morning, while it was still  dark, and before leaving the town they had to submit to a search of  their car, lest it should contain any contraband of war.    At last, however, it was discovered that Lady Sarah Wilson's energy was  connected with despatch-running, and her liberty was threatened. One day  while riding to Mafeking with her maid she was captured by the Boers. On  reaching Snyman's camp, the general refused to allow her to proceed to  her destination or to return to Setlagoli. She was then detained as a  prisoner of war, pending negotiations with Colonel Baden-Powell  regarding the terms of her release. The Colonel offered to exchange for  Lady Sarah a Boer lady prisoner, but the enemy refused to part with  their prize till Viljoen, who was incarcerated in Mafeking, was first  given up. Colonel Baden-Powell then represented that he, as a natural  consequence, and without terms of exchange, had at once transferred  women and children prisoners to the care of their people; but the Boer  general was not to be prevailed upon by argument. Eventually Viljoen was  given up and Lady Sarah returned safe and well to Mafeking. The  transaction, though somewhat unpleasant, was on the whole decidedly  complimentary to Lady Sarah in particular, and to the British feminine  sex in general. It fully proved that an Englishwoman might in future  view herself as the equivalent of a Boer officer.    The artillery-fire of the enemy was now beginning to prove more  efficient than formerly. In spite of this, however, Colonel  Baden-Powell, in the kindness of his heart, issued a warning to the  Burghers advising them to make terms and go home. This very  characteristic epistle is here reproduced, as it shows the amazing blend  of serpent and dove in the spirit of the man who was at that moment  facing the choice of death or surrender:--         \"To the Burghers under arms round Mafeking:--         \"Burghers,--I address you in this manner because I have only       recently learned how you have been intentionally kept in the       dark by your officers, the Government, and the newspapers as to       what is happening in other parts of South Africa. As the       officer commanding Her Majesty's troops on this border, I think       it right to point out clearly the inevitable result of your       remaining longer under arms against Great Britain. You are       aware that the present war was caused by the invasion of       British territory by your forces without justifiable reasons.       Your leaders do not tell you that so far your forces have only       met the advanced guard of the British forces. The circumstances       have changed within the last week. The main body of the British       are now daily arriving by thousands from England, Canada,       India, and Australia, and are about to advance through the       country. In a short time the Republic will be in the hands of       the English, and no sacrifice of life on your part can stop it.       The question now that you have to put to yourselves before it       is too late is:--Is it worth while losing your lives in a vain       attempt to stop the invasion or take a town beyond your       borders, which, if taken, will be of no use to you?         \"I may tell you that Mafeking cannot be taken by sitting down       and looking at it, for we have ample supplies for several       months. The Staats artillery has done very little damage, and       we are now protected both by troops and mines. Your presence       here and elsewhere under arms cannot stop the British advancing       through your country. Your leaders and newspapers are also       trying to make you believe that some foreign combination or       Power is likely to intervene in your behalf against England. It       is not in keeping with their pretence that your side is going       to be victorious, nor in accordance with facts. The Republics       having declared war and taken the offensive, cannot claim       intervention on their behalf. The German Emperor is at present       in England, and fully sympathises with us. The American       Government has warned others of its intention to side with       England should any Power intervene. France has large interests       in the goldfields, identical with those of England. Italy is       entirely in accord with us. Russia has no cause to interfere.       The war is of one Government against another, and not of a       people against another people. The duty assigned to my troops       is to sit still here until the proper time arrives, and then to       fight and kill until you give in. You, on the other hand, have       other interests to think of, your families, farms, and their       safety. Your leaders have caused the destruction of farms, and       have fired on women and children. Our men are becoming hard to       restrain in consequence. They have also caused the invasion of       Kaffir territory, looting their cattle, and have thus induced       them to rise and invade your country and kill your Burghers. As       one white man to another, I warned General Cronje on November       14 that this would occur. Yesterday I heard that more Kaffirs       were rising. I have warned General Snyman accordingly. Great       bloodshed and destruction of farms threaten you on all sides.         \"I wish to offer you a chance of avoiding it. My advice to you       is to return to your homes without delay and remain peaceful       till the war is over. Those who do this before the 13th will,       as far as possible, be protected, as regards"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3689"],[0,"Letters of Franz Liszt -- Volume 1 (#12)"],[1,"the following demonstration:--    \"We must admire (bewundern) Kroll's fine feeling of friendship;  we may be amazed (verwundern) at the proof he has given of his  industry in copying out the Mass; should this industry continue  we shall first of all be astonished (erstaunen), and by degrees,  through the results he will bring about, we again attain to  admiration (Bewunderung).\"    I don't know how you will judge, critically, of this example, but  what is certain is that it appeared to be quite conclusive to our  auditory.    Ernst [The celebrated violinist (1814-65)] has just been spending  a week here, during which he has played some hundred rubbers of  whist at the \"Erbprinz.\" His is a noble, sweet, and delicate  nature, and more than once during his stay I have caught myself  regretting you for him, and regretting him for you. Last Monday  he was good enough to play, in his usual and admirable manner, at  the concert for the Orchestral Pension Fund. The pieces he had  selected were his new \"Concerto pathetique\" (in F~ minor) and an  extremely piquant and brilliant \"Caprice on Hungarian Melodies.\"  (This latter piece is dedicated to me.) The public was in a good  humor, even really warm, which is usually one of its least  faults.    Milde, who is, as you know, not much of a talker, has  nevertheless the tact to say the right thing sometimes. Thus,  when we went to see Ernst off at the railway, he expressed the  feeling of us all--\"What a pity that Kroll is not here!\"    For the most part you have left here the impression which you  will leave in every country--that of a man of heart, talent,  tact, and intellect. One of these qualities alone is enough to  distinguish a man from the vulgar herd; but when one is so well  born as to possess a quartet of them it is absolutely necessary  that the will, and an active will, should be added to them in  order to make them bring out their best fruits,--and this I am  sure you will not be slow to do.    Your brother came through here the day before yesterday, thinking  he should still find you here. I have given him your address, and  told him to inquire about you at Schlesinger's in Berlin, where  he expects to be on the 8th of April; so do not fail to let  Schlesinger know, in one way or another, when you get to Berlin.  As M. de Zigesar [The Intendant at Weimar.] I was obliged to  start in a great hurry for The Hague, in the suite of the  Hereditary Grand Duchess, I will wait till his return to send you  the letters for Mr. de Witzleben. I will address them to  Schlesinger early in April.    We are studying hard at the Duke of Coburg's opera \"Toni, oder  die Vergellung,\" [\"Toni, or the Requital\"] which we shall give  next Saturday. The score really contains some pretty things and  which make a pleasing effect; unluckily I cannot say as much for  the libretto.    Your castle in the air for May we will build up on a solid basis  in Weymar; for I am quite calculating on seeing you then,  together with our charming, good, worthy friend Conradi. Will you  please, dear Kroll, tell Mr. Germershausen and his family how  gratified I am with their kind remembrance? When I go to Sagan I  shall certainly give myself the pleasure of calling on him.    Believe me ever your very sincere and affectionate friend,    F. Liszt        42. To Abbe de Lamennais    [Autograph in the possession of M. Alfred Bovet at Valentigney.]    Permit me, illustrious and venerable friend, to recall myself to  your remembrance through M. Ciabatta, who has already had the  honor of being introduced to you last year at my house. He has  just been making a tour in Spain and Portugal with me, and can  give you all particulars about it. I should have been glad also  to get him to take back to you the score, now completed, of the  chorus which you were so good as to entrust to me (\"The iron is  hard, let us strike!\"), but unfortunately it is not with music as  with painting and poetry: body and soul alone are not enough to  make it comprehensible; it has to be performed, and very well  performed too, to be understood and felt. Now the performance of  a chorus of the size of that is not an easy matter in Paris, and  I would not even risk it without myself conducting the  preliminary rehearsals. While waiting till a favorable  opportunity offers, allow me to tell you that I have been happy  to do this work, and that I trust I have not altogether failed in  it. Were it not for the fear of appearing to you very indiscreet,  I should perhaps venture to trespass on your kindness for the  complete series of these simple, and at the same time sublime,  compositions, of which you alone know the secret. Three other  choruses of the same kind as that of the Blacksmiths, which  should sum up the most poetical methods of human activity, and  which should be called (unless you advise otherwise) Labourers,  Sailors, and Soldiers, would form a lyric epic of which the  genius of Rossini or Meyerbeer would be proud. I know I have no  right to make any such claim, but your kindness to me has always  been so great that I have a faint hope of obtaining this new and  glorious favor. If, however, this work would give you even an  hour's trouble, please consider my request as not having been  made, and pardon me for the regret which I shall feel at this  beautiful idea being unrealized.    As business matters do not necessarily call me to Paris, I prefer  not to return there just now. I expect to go to Bonn in the month  of July, for the inauguration of the Beethoven Monument, and to  have a Cantata performed there which I have written for this  occasion. The text, at any rate, is tolerably new; it is a sort  of Magnificat of human Genius conquered by God in the eternal  revelation through time and space,--a text which might apply  equally well to Goethe or Raphael or Columbus, as to Beethoven.  At the beginning of winter I shall resume my duties at the Court  of Weymar, to which I attach more and more a serious importance.    If you were to be so very good as to write me a few lines, I  should be most happy and grateful. If you would send them either  to my mother's address, Rue Louis le Grand, 20; or to that of my  secretary, Mr. Belloni, Rue Neuve St. George, No. 5, I should  always get them in a very short time.    I have the honor to be, sir, yours very gratefully,    F. Liszt    Marseilles, April 28th, 1845        43. To Frederic Chopin    [Autograph in the possession of M. Alfred Bovet at Valentigney.--  The great Polish tone-poet (1809-49) was most intimate with Liszt  in Paris. The latter, in his work \"F. Chopin\" 1851, second  edition 1879, Breitkopf and Hartel; German translation by La  Mara, 1880), raised an imperishable monument to him.]    Dear Chopin,    M. Benacci, a member of the Maison Troupenas, and in my opinion  the most intelligent editor, and the most liberal in business  matters, in France, asks me for a letter of introduction to you.  I give it all the more willingly, as I am convinced that under  all circumstances you will have every reason to be satisfied with  his activity and with whatever he does. Mendelssohn, whom he met  in Switzerland two years ago, has made him his exclusive editor  for France, and I, for my part, am just going to do the same. It  would be a real satisfaction to me if you would entrust some of  your manuscripts to him, and if these lines should help in making  you do so I know he will be grateful to me.    Yours ever, in true and lively friendship,    F. Liszt    Lyons, May 21st, 1845        44. To George Sand.    [Autograph in the possession of M. Alfred Bovet at Valentigney.--  A friendship of long years subsisted between Liszt and France's  greatest female writer, George Sand. At her home of Nohant he was  a frequent guest, together with the Comtesse d'Agoult. Three  letters which he wrote (in 1835 and 1837) for the Gazette  Musicale--clever talks about Art, Nature, Religion, Freedom,  etc.--bear George Sand's address.]    Without wishing to add to your other inevitable troubles that of  a correspondence for which you care little, allow me, dear  George, to claim for myself your old indulgence for people who  write to you without requiring an answer, and let me recall  myself to you by these few lines through M. Benacci. Their  ostensible object is to recommend the above-mentioned Benacci, so  that you, in your turn, may recommend him more particularly to  Chopin (and I may add in parenthesis that I should abstain from  this negotiation were I not firmly persuaded that Chopin will  never regret entering into business relations with Benacci, who,  in his capacity of member of the firm of Troupenas, is one of the  most important and most intelligent men of his kind); but the  real fact of the matter is that I am writing to you above all--  and why should I not confess it openly?--for the pleasure of  conversing with you for a few moments. Therefore don't expect  anything interesting from me, and if my handwriting bothers you,  throw my letter into the fire without going any further.    Do you know with whom I have just had endless conversations about  you, in sight of Lisbon and Gibraltar? With that kind, excellent,  and original Blavoyer, the Ahasuerus of commerce, whom I had  already met several times without recognising him, until at last  I remembered our dinners at the \"Ecu\" (Crown) at Geneva, and the  famous Pipe!    During the month's voyage from Lisbon to Barcelona we emptied I  cannot tell you how many bottles of sherry in your honor and  glory; and one fine evening he confided to me in so simple and  charming a manner his vexation at being unable to find several  letters that you had written to him in Russia, I think, and which  have been stolen from him, that I took a liking to him, and he  did the same to me. The fact is that there could not possibly be  two Blavoyers under the sun, and his own person is the only  pattern of which he cannot furnish goods wholesale,"]]]
