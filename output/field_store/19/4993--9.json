Distally  the apices are widely separated, and the intervening space gives the  hemipenis a slightly bilobed appearance in some species (especially  _C. vittatus_) or a deeply bilobed appearance in others (especially  _C. lineatus concolor_).       [Illustration: FIG. 9. The everted left hemipenis of _Conophis        vittatus_ (UMMZ 82650). x 5.]    The everted hemipenis reaches posteriorly to the eighth subcaudal  scale. The sulcus bifurcates at the third subcaudal scale. The  situation is similar _in situ_ (Cope, 1895:pl. 28, fig. 2).    There are no apparent hemipenial differences among the species of the  genus _Conophis_. As can be seen in the above description, the  hemipenis of _C. vittatus_ is less bilobed and has a more pronounced  disc at the apex than the others. The hemipenis of _C. lineatus  concolor_ is most bilobed, but has the smallest apical disc. The other  species and subspecies vary widely within these extremes.      Food and Feeding    _Conophis_ eats mostly small lizards, especially _Cnemidophorus_. In  Mexico _Conophis_ occurs in semi-arid habitat where _Cnemidophorus_ is  common. A specimen each of _Conophis vittatus_ and _C. lineatus  lineatus_ were obtained while I was collecting _Cnemidophorus_. The  only record of _Conophis_ having fed on a warm-blooded vertebrate was  obtained in the course of this study, when I recovered from the  stomach of a _Conophis lineatus concolor_ (CNHM 36299) from Chichen  Itza, Yucatan, a heteromyid rodent (_Heteromys gaumeri_).    Ralph Axtell (personal communication) observed _Conophis_ actively  searching for food at dusk. His observations were made near  Tehuantepec, Oaxaca, and the snakes were seen to chase lizards of the  genus _Cnemidophorus_. Near Alvarado, Veracruz, in the late afternoon,  I watched a _Conophis lineatus lineatus_ follow a lizard into a hole.    Mittleman (1944:122) presents the only discussion of the mode of  feeding of a captive specimen of _Conophis lineatus_ ssp. When  presented with a _Thamnophis_ slightly smaller than itself, the  _Conophis_ struck, and within eight minutes immobilized the  _Thamnophis_. Within one-half hour the _Thamnophis_ was swallowed.  Three days later the _Conophis_ ate another _Thamnophis_, though still  distended from its first meal; nine days later it ate a _Storeria_. In  the course of several months, the _Conophis_ ate various toads and  hylids and two more _Storeria_. Apparently members of the genus  _Conophis_ do not constrict their prey, but rely upon a combination of  loss of blood and action of the venom to completely immobilize their  prey.    Ditmars (1931:pls. 26-27) showed three photographs of \"_Conophis  lineatus_\" (actually _Conophis pulcher_) ingesting another snake,  identified by him as a young _Ophis (= Xenodon) colubrinus_.      Effect of Poison    The rear fangs of these snakes are large for the size of the snake.  Various collectors have been bitten, and several reports of the effect  of the poison have been published. The snakes are aggressive and bite  constantly while being handled. A field companion, Dale L. Hoyt, was  bitten on the forefinger by a specimen of _C. l. lineatus_ and  immediately felt a burning sensation. The finger swelled, much as it  would if stung by a wasp, but it returned to normal size in about  twenty-four hours. Ditmars (1931:legend pl. 27) reported immediate  burning pain and a localized swelling, an inch in diameter and half an  inch high, which lasted for several hours. Mertens (1952b:83) reported  merely that the hand of the gardener at the Instituto Tropical in San  Salvador bled strongly for a full hour. Edward H. Taylor was bitten by  a specimen of _Conophis vittatus_ (Taylor and Smith, 1939:252); pain  and swelling lasted for some time. Taylor (personal communication) is  still troubled by damage incurred by that bite, which apparently  resulted in mechanical damage to the second joint of the middle  finger, for the joint swells when the finger is used or exercised.  William E. Duellman (personal communication) was bitten on the hand in  July, 1956. There was immediate pain and localized swelling, both of  which disappeared several hours later.          TAXONOMIC RELATIONSHIPS AND EVOLUTION      The genus _Conophis_ is known only from the Recent. Except that  _Conophis_ belongs to the subfamily xenodontinae and probably is of  New World origin, little is known about the relationships of the  genus. Auffenberg (1958) described a new genus and species of fossil  colubrid snake from the Miocene of Montana as _Dryinoides oxyrhachis_  and compared it with several recent genera. This specimen, of which  there is a relatively complete skull and a series of vertebrae, seems  most closely to resemble a specimen of _Conophis lineatus dunni_ (UF  7657) from Honduras, with which it was compared in basic osteology.  The two genera could be related, for the progenitors of _Conophis_  possibly inhabited much of North America in the Miocene.    Another possibility is that the main stock of the xenodontines reached  South America in earliest Tertiary times, and that the formation of  the Panamanian and Colombian seaways that separated South America and  Central America from the Late Paleocene to the middle of the Pliocene  left the _Conophis_ stock isolated in Middle America where members of  the genus dispersed through semi-arid habitats.    Turning our attention now to the species within the genus, instead of  the genus as a whole, _Conophis vittatus_ is readily set apart from  other members of the genus on the basis of the universal presence of  seven supralabials. In basic coloration it also differs, having no  stripe on the 1st scale-row, or spots on the venter, and a maximum of  four broad stripes on the body. The other species appear to be more  closely related; these make up the _C. lineatus_-group. _Conophis  nevermanni_ differs so much from the other species that it might be  placed in a separate group. Nevertheless, the basic striped pattern,  which is masked by the increased melanism of many specimens, indicates  that _nevermanni_ is more closely related to the _lineatus_-group than  to _vittatus_. The _lineatus_-group, thus, consists of _pulcher_,  _nevermanni_ and the three subspecies of _lineatus_. In this group the  color pattern is characterized by the high frequency of ventral  spotting, darkening of part of the supralabials, dark pigmentation on  the 1st scale-row, and more than four dark stripes on the body of  adults. _Conophis lineatus concolor_, on which the dark pigmentation  on the body apparently is secondarily lost, is an exception.    If differences in color pattern be used as an indication of the  relationships between the species and subspecies of the genus  _Conophis_, I would consider _C. vittatus_ the most divergent unit.  The subspecies of _lineatus_ closely resemble one another and, as a  unit, resemble _pulcher_ from which they differ primarily in the  position of the dorsalmost stripes. _Conophis nevermanni_ is more  divergent than is _pulcher_ from the species _lineatus_, but probably  is not so far removed from _lineatus_ as is _vittatus_.    In the light of what has been pointed out immediately above with  respect to resemblances of, and differences between, the species, an  hypothesis to account for their formation and for their presence in  the areas where they are today is the following: Concurrent with  climatic fluctuations in the Late Pliocene and Pleistocene, the  northernmost population differentiated into the species _vittatus_,  and has subsequently spread north and west from the region of  Tehuantepec, Mexico. During the same period _nevermanni_ became  isolated in northern Costa Rica.    The species _pulcher_ probably differentiated from the remaining  _lineatus_ stock during the Early Pleistocene orogenic upheaval in  Guatemala. The _pulcher_ stock was isolated on the Pacific Coastal  slopes of Guatemala, while _lineatus_ moved through the subhumid  corridor of northern Middle America into Mexico and southward toward  Costa Rica (Stuart, 1954a). In the Late Pleistocene and Recent,  _pulcher_ moved back across the central Guatemalan highlands occupying  its present range in northern Middle America. Primarily because of the  formation of unsuitable habitat (wet forest) that presently separates  the geographic ranges of populations of _lineatus_, this species  differentiated into three subspecies.          SUMMARY      The genus _Conophis_ Peters, 1860, contains four species. Three are  monotypic and the fourth has three subspecies, making a total of six  taxa.    The genus is characterized by maxillary teeth of equal size followed  by a diastema and two enlarged grooved fangs. The scales are smooth,  in 19 rows at mid-body, and 17 nearer the tail. The anal is divided,  apical pits are lacking, the head shields are normal for a colubrid,  and the hemipenis is bilobed having many large basal spines.    The six taxa are separated primarily on the basis of color pattern,  but characters of scutellation, including numbers of dorsals,  ventrals, caudals, and places of reduction of the number of dorsal  scale-rows, were analyzed.    Snakes of this genus are distributed throughout semi-arid environments  from southern Mexico southward into Costa Rica. They feed upon  lizards, primarily of the genus _Cnemidophorus_; in addition they are  known to eat small rodents and other snakes.    _Conophis_ is a member of the subfamily Xenodontinae and, as presently  understood, has no known living close relatives. A single specimen of  _Dryinoides_ from the Miocene of Montana has been compared with this  genus. The genus _Conophis_ is thought to have evolved in Middle  America. The present distribution and differentiation probably are  primarily the result of climatic fluctuations in Middle America, which  produced the areas of subhumid environment where _Conophis_"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3754"],[0,"The Wonders of Instinct: Chapters in the Psychology of Insects (#12)"],[1,"the body, so as to  pack it into a lesser volume and cause it to pass when passage is  obstructed. We shall presently see that this art plays a part of the  greatest importance in the industry of the Necrophori.    Although he has disappeared, the Mole is still far from having reached  his destination. Let us leave the undertakers to complete their task.  What they are now doing below ground is a continuation of what they did  on the surface and would teach us nothing new. We will wait for two or  three days.    The moment has come. Let us inform ourselves of what is happening down  there. Let us visit the retting-vat. I shall invite no one to be  present at the exhumation. Of those about me, only little Paul has the  courage to assist me.    The Mole is a Mole no longer, but a greenish horror, putrid, hairless,  shrunk into a round, greasy mass. The thing must have undergone careful  manipulation to be thus condensed into a small volume, like a fowl in  the hands of the cook, and, above all, to be so completely deprived of  its fur. Is this culinary procedure undertaken in respect of the  larvae, which might be incommoded by the fur? Or is it just a casual  result, a mere loss of hair due to putridity? I am not certain. But it  is always the case that these exhumations, from first to last, have  revealed the furry game furless and the feathered game featherless,  except for the tail-feathers and the pinion-feathers of the wings.  Reptiles and fish, on the other hand, retain their scales.    Let us return to the unrecognizable thing which was once a Mole. The  tit-bit lies in a spacious crypt, with firm walls, a regular workshop,  worthy of being the bake-house of a Copris-beetle. Except for the fur,  which is lying in scattered flocks, it is intact. The grave-diggers  have not eaten into it; it is the patrimony of the sons, not the  provision of the parents, who, in order to sustain themselves, levy at  most a few mouthfuls of the ooze of putrid humours.    Beside the dish which they are kneading and protecting are two  Necrophori; a couple, no more. Four collaborated in the burial. What  has become of the other two, both males? I find them hidden in the  soil, at a distance, almost at the surface.    This observation is not an isolated one. Whenever I am present at a  burial undertaken by a squad in which the males, zealous one and all,  predominate, I find presently, when the burial is completed, only one  couple in the mortuary cellar. Having lent their assistance, the rest  have discreetly retired.    These grave-diggers, in truth, are remarkable fathers. They have  nothing of the happy-go-lucky paternal carelessness that is the general  rule among insects, which plague and pester the mother for a moment  with their attentions and thereupon leave her to care for the  offspring! But those who in the other races are unemployed in this case  labour valiantly, now in the interest of their own family, now for the  sake of another's, without distinction. If a couple is in difficulties,  helpers arrive, attracted by the odour of carrion; anxious to serve a  lady, they creep under the body, work at it with back and claw, bury it  and then go their ways, leaving the householders to their happiness.    For some time longer these latter manipulate the morsel in concert,  stripping it of fur or feather, trussing it and allowing it to simmer  to the taste of the larvae. When all is in order, the couple go forth,  dissolving their partnership, and each, following his fancy,  recommences elsewhere, even if only as a mere auxiliary.    Twice and no oftener hitherto have I found the father preoccupied by  the future of his sons and labouring in order to leave them rich: it  happens with certain Dung-beetles and with the Necrophori, who bury  dead bodies. Scavengers and undertakers both have exemplary morals. Who  would look for virtue in such a quarter?    What follows--the larval existence and the metamorphosis--is a  secondary detail and, for that matter, familiar. It is a dry subject  and I shall deal with it briefly. About the end of May, I exhume a  Brown Rat, buried by the grave-diggers a fortnight earlier. Transformed  into a black, sticky jelly, the horrible dish provides me with fifteen  larvae, already, for the most part, of the normal size. A few adults,  connections, assuredly, of the brood, are also stirring amid the  infected mass. The period of hatching is over now; and food is  plentiful. Having nothing else to do, the foster-parents have sat down  to the feast with the nurselings.    The undertakers are quick at rearing a family. It is at most a  fortnight since the Rat was laid in the earth; and here already is a  vigorous population on the verge of the metamorphosis. Such precocity  amazes me. It would seem as though the liquefaction of carrion, deadly  to any other stomach, is in this case a food productive of especial  energy, which stimulates the organism and accelerates its growth, so  that the victuals may be consumed before its approaching conversion  into mould. Living chemistry makes haste to outstrip the ultimate  reactions of mineral chemistry.    White, naked, blind, possessing the habitual attributes of life in  darkness, the larva, with its lanceolate outline, is slightly  reminiscent of the grub of the Ground-beetle. The mandibles are black  and powerful, making excellent scissors for dissection. The limbs are  short, but capable of a quick, toddling gait. The segments of the  abdomen are armoured on the upper surface with a narrow reddish plate,  armed with four tiny spikes, whose office apparently is to furnish  points of support when the larva quits the natal dwelling and dives  into the soil, there to undergo the transformation. The thoracic  segments are provided with wider plates, but unarmed.    The adults discovered in the company of their larval family, in this  putridity that was a Rat, are all abominably verminous. So shiny and  neat in their attire, when at work under the first Moles of April, the  Necrophori, when June approaches, become odious to look upon. A layer  of parasites envelops them; insinuating itself into the joints, it  forms an almost continuous surface. The insect presents a misshapen  appearance under this overcoat of vermin, which my hair-pencil can  hardly brush aside. Driven off the belly, the horde make the tour of  the sufferer and encamp on his back, refusing to relinquish their hold.    I recognize among them the Beetle's Gamasis, the Tick who so often  soils the ventral amethyst of our Geotrupes. No; the prizes of life do  not fall to the share of the useful. Necrophori and Geotrupes devote  themselves to works of general salubrity; and these two corporations,  so interesting in the accomplishment of their hygienic functions, so  remarkable for their domestic morality, are given over to the vermin of  poverty. Alas, of this discrepancy between the services rendered and  the harshness of life there are many other examples outside the world  of scavengers and undertakers!    The Burying-beetles display an exemplary domestic morality, but it does  not persist until the end. During the first fortnight of June, the  family being sufficiently provided for, the sextons strike work and my  cages are deserted, so far as the surface is concerned, in spite of new  arrivals of Mice and Sparrows. From time to time some grave-digger  leaves the subsoil and comes crawling languidly in the fresh air.    Another rather curious fact now attracts my attention. All, as soon as  they emerge from underground, are cripples, whose limbs have been  amputated at the joints, some higher up, some lower down. I see one  mutilated Beetle who has only one leg left entire. With this odd limb  and the stumps of the others lamentably tattered, scaly with vermin, he  rows himself, as it were, over the dusty surface. A comrade emerges,  one better off for legs, who finishes the cripple and cleans out his  abdomen. So my thirteen remaining Necrophori end their days,  half-devoured by their companions, or at least shorn of several limbs.  The pacific relations of the outset are succeeded by cannibalism.    History tells us that certain peoples, the Massagetae and others, used  to kill their aged folk in order to spare them the miseries of  senility. The fatal blow on the hoary skull was in their eyes an act of  filial piety. The Necrophori have their share of these ancient  barbarities. Full of days and henceforth useless, dragging out a weary  existence, they mutually exterminate one another. Why prolong the agony  of the impotent and the imbecile?    The Massagetae might invoke, as an excuse for their atrocious custom, a  dearth of provisions, which is an evil counsellor; not so the  Necrophori, for, thanks to my generosity, victuals are superabundant,  both beneath the soil and on the surface. Famine plays no part in this  slaughter. Here we have the aberration of exhaustion, the morbid fury  of a life on the point of extinction. As is generally the case, work  bestows a peaceable disposition on the grave-digger, while inaction  inspires him with perverted tastes. Having no longer anything to do, he  breaks his fellow's limbs, eats him up, heedless of being mutilated or  eaten up himself. This is the ultimate deliverance of verminous old  age.        CHAPTER 6. THE BURYING-BEETLES: EXPERIMENTS.    Let us proceed to the rational prowess which has earned for the  Necrophorus the better part of his renown and, to begin with, let us  submit the case related by Clairville--that of the too hard soil and  the call for assistance--to experimental test.    With this object in view, I pave the centre of the space beneath the  cover, level with the soil, with a brick and sprinkle the latter with a  thin layer of sand. This will be the soil in which digging is  impracticable. All about it, for some distance and on the same level,  spreads the loose soil, which is easy to dig.    In order to"]]]
