A fir is the shape of a church steeple or a spear-head about to cleave  the sky. The lowermost branches come out in a ring and spread out  straight and stiff like the spokes of a wheel. Above this whorl is  another of shorter branches still, and so on, till the top ring is  quite a little one round a pointed shoot. The little shoots fork out  on each side of the big branches, and like them are set closely with  leaves. These shoots do not point up to the sky nor down to the earth;  they spread out flat, so that the branch looks like a huge fern.    Pines begin to grow like firs; but as they shoot up side by side in  the woods, their lower branches drop off for want of air and sunshine,  and their upper branches spread out wider. A fir is a pyramid with a  pointed top; but a full-grown pine has a flat top, and often a tall,  bare trunk, so that it looks like a great umbrella. A famous Roman  writer, Pliny, said that the smoke of a volcano was like a pine tree.  The smoke shoots up in a great pillar from the mouth of the fiery  mountain, and then spreads itself out in a black cap.    You have often amused yourselves with finding pictures in the clouds.  Have you seen a pillar of mist rise up from the horizon, the meeting  line of the earth and sky, and then lose itself in a soft cloud? The  country people in some parts of Europe call this cloud-form  _Abraham's tree_ or _Adam's tree_, because it is so like a pine tree.  When the clouds break up into the soft, white, fleecy ripples that we  call a mackerel sky, they say, \"We shall have wind, for Adam's tree is  putting forth leaves.\"    The pine trees dress themselves in long, blue-green, rounded needles  set in bundles of two, three, or more, bristling out all round their  branches; but the fir trees wear short, narrow, flat leaves of a  yellow-green colour, set singly each one by itself. These fir leaves  come out all round the stem just as pine leaves do, but they are  parted down the middle as we sometimes part our hair, so that they  spread out flat in two thick rows.    Mr. Ruskin calls the pines and firs and their relations the builders  with the sword, because of their narrow, pointed leaves, and the  broad-leaved trees he calls the builders with the shield. The trees of  the sword stand erect on the hills like armed soldiers prepared for  war; while the trees of the shield spread themselves in the valleys to  shelter the fields and pastures.    Why do these mountain trees have such narrow leaves? Can you find out  a reason? Perhaps this is one: when the great, strong wind is raging  with all his force, he will not suffer any resistance but breaks down  everything that tries to stay him in his course; if he meets broad  leaves and heavy branches, he hurls them out of his way, but he just  whistles through the slender leaves and branches of the pines and  firs, and scarcely knows they are there.    When you gather the cones in the wood, you may know at once whether  they have fallen from pine trees or from fir trees. A pine cone looks  like a single piece of carved solid wood until it opens, and then each  hard scale shows a thick, square head; but the fir cones are made of  broad, papery scales, with thin edges laid neatly one over the other.    Now you will never have any difficulty in knowing the pines from the  firs, even in the far distance--colour, form, dress, fruit, all are  different.    How is it we make a mistake, and call the Scotch pine by the name of  Scotch fir? Perhaps it is because this tree is the only one of the  great pine and fir family that is a real native of Britain. Our  stay-at-home ancestors who lived above three hundred years ago never  saw a real fir, and so their one pine had to represent all its  relations. They knew it perhaps better than we do, for in their days  there were many forests that have since been cut down to make room for  houses and gardens and fields.    Sometimes when you have been walking over the moorland you have run to  gather some bright yellow moss, and have suddenly found your foot  sinking into wet, black mud, and you have heard stories of men and  horses sucked down by just such dreadful slime. Hundreds of years ago  forests stood where now lie these dangerous bogs, and the trees and  shrubs rotting and decaying in the wet have changed into black, brown  swamps. Many bogs have been drained, and the trunks of pine trees have  been found in them standing as they grew. In one bog in Yorkshire pine  trees were found sawn across and left to lie and rot. Who felled these  trees which have been lying there hundreds of years? Can we tell? Yes;  for among the trees are scattered axe-heads and Roman coins, and we  are able to picture the old story of the place. There was once a  forest there, and the ancient Britons hid themselves in its shelter,  and the Romans cut down the trees to drive them from their  hiding-place.    There are two common kinds of firs which you will find in the woods.  One is the spruce fir, a very prim and proper tree, with slightly  curving branches turned up at the tips. It looks as if the branches  had been all cut to a pattern, and their length and the distances  between them carefully measured. When you have been washed and brushed  and pulled and straightened, and had every hair and bow set in its  proper place, so that you look particularly trim and neat, you  sometimes laugh and call one another _spruce_, like the spruce fir.    Some people think the name \"spruce\" means the _pruce_, or Prussian  tree; others say it means the sprouting tree, the tree that sprouts at  the ends of its branches. In some countries these bright-green sprouts  are cut off and made into a kind of beer called spruce beer.    The spruce fir is at home on the high mountains of Europe where it  often grows one hundred and fifty feet high. You long for the time  when you will be taken to Switzerland to see the snow-capped Alps.  Then standing out against the white snow and the glittering ice rivers  you will see the dark spruce forests. This fir is also at home in  Norway and the cold lands of the North, and so we call it the Norway  Spruce to distinguish it from other kinds of spruce fir that grow in  America. In Norway many old men and women earn a living by gathering  and selling in the markets pieces of fir for the people to strew on  the graves as we do flowers.    What sort of cones has the spruce? Can you find some in the fir wood?  They are five or six inches long and perhaps two inches thick. You  will see them hanging from the ends of the upper branches, and perhaps  you may find some empty ones on the ground. Look at them. Those thin  scales are very different from the tough walls of the pine cone: each  one is shaped off to a point, and this point is divided into two sharp  teeth.    Perhaps when you are looking for the cones, you will find growing fast  to the branches among the leaves some fanciful things that look like  little cones. These are very gay; every scale has a border of crimson  velvet and a green spine in the middle of its back, like a little  tusk. If you open them you will find some brown, soft things inside.  Do you know what they are? Perhaps, if you have not already made  friends with the real cone, you will think these are seeds; but some  of you are growing wise, and know that you have intruded into a little  nest of insects. If you tie a net round the branch and keep watch, you  may see them come out. Their mother pierced a hole in a brown bud last  autumn and laid her eggs there; then when the buds burst in spring the  lower leaves grew fast together and made this comfortable house, and  those green tusks you see are the leaf points.    But what is the other kind of fir that grows in our wood? It is rather  like the spruce in shape, but it is not quite so stiff and prim and  proper, and underneath each little leaf there are two silver lines,  and so we call this the silver fir. You may always know it from the  spruce by these silver lines. Each stiff little leaf has its edges  rolled under as if ready for hemming, and there is a thick green rib  down the middle of the under side, so the silver lining just peeps out  in single streaks between the rib and the hems.    The spring tufts of the Norway spruce are of a bright yellow-green;  those of the silver fir are paler and softer in tint, more like the  primrose. When the sulphur butterfly lights on them we lose sight of  him, so he flits from one to another, feeling quite safe, and keeping  carefully away from those dark old leaves where he would be pounced  upon at once.    The silver fir does not let its cones hang down; it holds them proudly  erect on its branches; like little towers often eight inches high. We  wonder how such slender twigs can hold up such large cones. They look  like hairy giants, for their scales do not end in two little teeth,  but in a long point which turns back and bends downwards.    The silver fir does not like quite such cold places as the spruce and  the Scotch pine; it dwells lower down the mountain sides, and is at  home in Central Europe.    All the pines and firs, like the Scotch pine, have those wonderful  pipes and reservoirs of sticky turpentine juice inside their bark, but  each kind of fir has its own way of making its stores, and so we get  different kinds of resin and turpentine and balsams from different  trees.    It is these stores of resin that make the pine wood burn so brightly.  The Highland chief needed no gas for his great illuminations; he had  only to call his followers to hold up branches of blazing pine. It is  not very wise to light a picnic fire in a pine or fir wood, for  sometimes a few sparks will set a whole forest in flames.    _Fir_--_fire_: how much alike these two words are! Do you think they  must have some connection with one another? Were the first fires made  of fir wood? or was this tree called fir because it made such good"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3458"],[0,"Science and Health, with Key to the Scriptures (#12)"],[1,"the evidence of the bodily senses,  50:21   what would his accusers have said? Even          what they did say, - that Jesus' teachings          were false, and that all evidence of their cor-  50:24   rectness was destroyed by his death. But this saying          could not make it so.                                The real pillory            The burden of that hour was terrible beyond human  50:27   conception. The distrust of mortal minds, disbelieving          the purpose of his mission, was a million          times sharper than the thorns which pierced  50:30   his flesh. The real cross, which Jesus bore up the hill          of grief, was the world's hatred of Truth and Love. Not          the spear nor the material cross wrung from his faithful  51:1    lips the plaintive cry, \"/Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?/\" It          was the possible loss of something more important than  51:3    human life which moved him, - the possible misappre-          hension of the sublimest influence of his career. This          dread added the drop of gall to his cup.                            Life-power indestructible    51:6    Jesus could have withdrawn himself from his enemies.          He had power to lay down a human sense of life for his          spiritual identity in the likeness of the divine;  51:9    but he allowed men to attempt the destruc-          tion of the mortal body in order that he might furnish          the proof of immortal life. Nothing could kill this Life  51:12   of man. Jesus could give his temporal life into his          enemies' hands; but when his earth-mission was accom-          plished, his spiritual life, indestructible and eternal,  51:15   was found forever the same. He knew that matter had          no life and that real Life is God; therefore he could no          more be separated from his spiritual Life than God could  51:18   be extinguished.                            Example for our salvation            His consummate example was for the salvation of us          all, but only through doing the works which he did and  51:21   taught others to do. His purpose in healing          was not alone to restore health, but to demon-          strate his divine Principle. He was inspired by God, by  51:24   Truth and Love, in all that he said and did. The motives          of his persecutors were pride, envy, cruelty, and vengeance,          inflicted on the physical Jesus, but aimed at the divine Prin-  51:27   ciple, Love, which rebuked their sensuality.            Jesus was unselfish. His spirituality separated him          from sensuousness, and caused the selfish materialist  51:30   to hate him; but it was this spirituality which enabled          Jesus to heal the sick, cast out evil, and raise the          dead.                                Master's business    52:1    From early boyhood he was about his \"Father's busi-          ness.\" His pursuits lay far apart from theirs. His mas-  52:3    ter was Spirit; their master was matter. He          served God; they served mammon. His affec-          tions were pure; theirs were carnal. His senses drank in  52:6    the spiritual evidence of health, holiness, and life; their          senses testified oppositely, and absorbed the material evi-          dence of sin, sickness, and death.                                 Purity's rebuke    52:9    Their imperfections and impurity felt the ever-present          rebuke of his perfection and purity. Hence the world's          hatred of the just and perfect Jesus, and the  52:12   prophet's foresight of the reception error would          give him. \"Despised and rejected of men,\" was Isaiah's          graphic word concerning the coming Prince of Peace.  52:15   Herod and Pilate laid aside old feuds in order to unite          in putting to shame and death the best man that ever          trod the globe. To-day, as of old, error and evil again  52:18   make common cause against the exponents of truth.                              Saviour's prediction            The \"man of sorrows\" best understood the nothing-          ness of material life and intelligence and the mighty ac-  52:21   tuality of all-inclusive God, good. These were          the two cardinal points of Mind-healing, or          Christian Science, which armed him with Love. The high-  52:24   est earthly representative of God, speaking of human          ability to reflect divine power, prophetically said to his          disciples, speaking not for their day only but for all time:  52:27   \"He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do          also;\" and \"These signs shall follow them that believe.\"                             Defamatory accusations            The accusations of the Pharisees were as self-contra-  52:30   dictory as their religion. The bigot, the deb-          auchee, the hypocrite, called Jesus a glutton          and a wine-bibber. They said: \"He casteth out devils  53:1    through Beelzebub,\" and is the \"friend of publicans and          sinners.\" The latter accusation was true, but not in their  53:3    meaning. Jesus was no ascetic. He did not fast as did          the Baptist's disciples; yet there never lived a man so far          removed from appetites and passions as the Nazarene.  53:6    He rebuked sinners pointedly and unflinchingly, because          he was their friend; hence the cup he drank.                            Reputation and character            The reputation of Jesus was the very opposite of his  53:9    character. Why? Because the divine Principle and          practice of Jesus were misunderstood. He          was at work in divine Science. His words  53:12   and works were unknown to the world because above          and contrary to the world's religious sense. Mortals be-          lieved in God as humanly mighty, rather than as divine,  53:15   infinite Love.                              Inspiring discontent            The world could not interpret aright the discomfort          which Jesus inspired and the spiritual blessings which  53:18   might flow from such discomfort. Science          shows the cause of the shock so often pro-          duced by the truth, - namely, that this shock arises from  53:21   the great distance between the individual and Truth.          Like Peter, we should weep over the warning, instead of          denying the truth or mocking the lifelong sacrifice which  53:24   goodness makes for the destruction of evil.                                Bearing our sins            Jesus bore our sins in his body. He knew the          mortal errors which constitute the material body, and  53:27   could destroy those errors; but at the time          when Jesus felt our infirmities, he had not          conquered all the beliefs of the flesh or his sense of ma-  53:30   terial life, nor had he risen to his final demonstration of          spiritual power.            Had he shared the sinful beliefs of others, he would  54:1    have been less sensitive to those beliefs. Through the          magnitude of his human life, he demonstrated the divine  54:3    Life. Out of the amplitude of his pure affection, he de-          fined Love. With the affluence of Truth, he vanquished          error. The world acknowledged not his righteousness,  54:6    seeing it not; but earth received the harmony his glorified          example introduced.                            Inspiration of sacrifice            Who is ready to follow his teaching and example? All  54:9    must sooner or later plant themselves in Christ, the true          idea of God. That he might liberally pour          his dear-bought treasures into empty or sin-  54:12   filled human storehouses, was the inspiration of Jesus'          intense human sacrifice. In witness of his divine com-          mission, he presented the proof that Life, Truth, and  54:15   Love heal the sick and the sinning, and triumph over          death through Mind, not matter. This was the highest          proof he could have offered of divine Love. His hearers  54:18   understood neither his words nor his works. They          would not accept his meek interpretation of life nor          follow his example.                              Spiritual friendship    54:21   His earthly cup of bitterness was drained to the          dregs. There adhered to him only a few unpretentious          friends, whose religion was something more  54:24   than a name. It was so vital, that it en-          abled them to understand the Nazarene and to share          the glory of eternal life. He said that those who fol-  54:27   lowed him should drink of his cup, and history has con-          firmed the prediction.                            Injustice to the Saviour            If that Godlike and glorified man were physically on  54:30   earth to-day, would not some, who now pro-          fess to love him, reject him? Would they          not deny him even the rights of humanity, if he enter-  55:1    tained any other sense of being and religion than theirs?          The advancing century, from a deadened sense of the  55:3    invisible God, to-day subjects to unchristian comment and          usage the idea of Christian healing enjoined by Jesus; but          this does not affect the invincible facts.  55:6    Perhaps the early Christian era did Jesus no more          injustice than the later centuries have bestowed upon          the healing Christ and spiritual idea of being. Now  55:9    that the gospel of healing is again preached by the          wayside, does not the pulpit sometimes scorn it? But          that curative mission, which presents the Saviour in a  55:12   clearer light than mere words can possibly do, cannot be          left out of Christianity, although it is again ruled out of          the synagogue.    55:15   Truth's immortal idea is sweeping down the centuries,          gathering beneath its wings the sick and sinning. My          weary hope tries "]]]
