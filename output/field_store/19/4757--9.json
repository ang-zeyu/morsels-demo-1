If I were  racing with somebody who could really run it would be very different.\"  Then he started to run more slowly but every time his heart beat it  said, \"Hurry up! Hurry up!\" The big grey rat decided that it was best  to obey the little voice in his heart so he hurried just as fast as he  could.    When he reached the royal palm tree at the top of the cliff he could  hardly believe his eyes. He thought he must be having a bad dream.  There was the little brown beetle sitting quietly beside the bright  green and gold parrot. The big grey rat had never been so surprised in  all his life. \"How did you ever manage to run fast enough to get here  so soon?\" he asked the little brown beetle as soon as he could catch  his breath.    The little brown beetle drew out the tiny wings from her sides.  \"Nobody said anything about having to run to win the race,\" she  replied, \"so I flew instead.\"    \"I did not know that you could fly,\" said the big grey rat in a  subdued little voice.    \"After this,\" said the bright green and gold parrot, \"never judge any  one by his looks alone. You never can tell how often or where you may  find concealed wings. You have lost the prize.\"    Until this day, even in Brazil where the flowers and birds and beasts  and insects have such gorgeous colouring, the rat wears a plain dull  grey coat.    Then the parrot turned to the little brown beetle who was waiting  quietly at his side. \"What colour do you want your new coat to be?\" he  asked.    The little brown beetle looked up at the bright green and gold parrot,  at the green and gold palm trees above their heads, at the green  mangoes with golden flushes on their cheeks lying on the ground under  the mango trees, at the golden sunshine upon the distant green hills.  \"I choose a coat of green and gold,\" she said.    From that day to this the Brazilian beetle has worn a coat of green  with golden lights upon it.    For years and years the Brazilian beetles were all very proud to wear  green and gold coats like that of the beetle who raced with the rat.    Then, once upon a time, it happened that there was a little beetle who  grew discontented with her coat of green and gold. She looked up at  the blue sky and out at the blue sea and wished that she had a blue  coat instead. She talked about it so much that finally her mother took  her to the parrot who lived next to the tailor bird.    \"You may change your coat for a blue one,\" said the parrot, \"but if  you change you'll have to give up something.\"    \"Oh, I'll gladly give up anything if only I may have a blue coat  instead of a green and gold one,\" said the discontented little beetle.    When she received her new coat she thought it was very beautiful. It  was a lovely shade of blue and it had silvery white lights upon it  like the light of the stars. When she put it on, however, she  discovered that it was not hard like the green and gold one. From that  day to this the blue beetles' coats have not been hard and firm. That  is the reason why the jewellers have difficulty in using them in pins  and necklaces like other beetles.    From the moment that the little beetle put on her new blue coat she  never grew again. From that day to this the blue beetles have been  much smaller than the green and gold ones.    When the Brazilians made their flag they took for it a square of green  the colour of the green beetle's coat. Within this square they placed  a diamond of gold like the golden lights which play upon the green  beetle's back. Then, within the diamond, they drew a circle to  represent the round earth and they coloured it blue like the coat of  the blue beetle. Upon the blue circle they placed stars of silvery  white like the silvery white lights on the back of the blue beetle.  About the blue circle of the earth which they thus pictured they drew  a band of white, and upon this band they wrote the motto of their  country, \"_Ordem e Progresso_, order and progress.\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24717"],[0,"Danger! A True History of a Great City's Wiles and Temptations (#12)"],[1,"peculiar ideas of crime, entertained, perhaps, for reasons only  known to themselves. The chances of escape from detection are, no doubt,  seriously weighed and carefully considered by the persons bent upon  committing felony as a mode of livelihood, and, undoubtedly, some  special line is selected, as the particular branch of the profession to  be followed, in accordance with the physical and mental fitness of the  man or woman to succeed in it.    In other words, they gradually become \"specialists,\" like other  professional persons in the respectable walks of life. It may be safely  said, however, that a thief in one thing is a thief in all things. He  would be callow, indeed, who would predicate that a professional burglar  would hesitate to commit highway robbery because his weapon was a jimmy,  or that a panel thief would turn up his nose at picking an inviting  pocket. It is all in the line of business, and neither professional  would lose caste. No doubt both men and women select the peculiar line  of crime for which they imagine they are physically and mentally best  adapted, and which, in each particular case, seems to offer the most  facilities and immunities. For these considerations, shop-lifting has  its obvious attractions and temptations for women.    For years past, the newspapers of our large cities almost daily have  chronicled the arrests of men and women, in stores, who have been caught  in the act of appropriating articles that have been temptingly displayed  on the counters. Yet it is very doubtful if there has yet appeared one  published account of the exact manner in which such goods have been  stolen, or an explanation given of the _finesse_ by which, in spite of  the Argus eyes of the watchers, clerks, visitors and customers, the  thief generally contrives to escape detection. It goes without saying  that there are adroit and dexterous shop-lifters of both sexes, while  the manner of conducting their operations is as diverse as can well be  conceived.    The annual thefts of goods from the retail stores of this city alone  aggregate an almost fabulous sum. It is very difficult to reach a  reliable approximation of the total amount thus stolen, because  store-keepers are naturally averse to having their losses from this  source known. As a prominent Sixth-avenue gentleman once remarked, \"If I  should tell how much I annually lost through thieves, or suffered by  shop-lifters, I would have the entire band occasionally paying me  visits, thinking I had not provided myself with the usual safe-guards  against them.\" Nevertheless, it can be stated as an absolute fact that  not less than half a million dollars' worth of goods yearly disappear  from the stores through shop-lifters, embracing all kinds of articles,  from diamonds to penny fans.    The professional diamond and jewelry thief, however, is not to be  confounded with the shop-lifter, for the former employs quite a  different _modus operandi_ in capturing his illicit goods. The diamond  thief has been known to display the most fertile ingenuity in devising  schemes to rob the unwary though generally alert jeweler. An instance is  recorded of a thief entering a jewelry store, leaving his \"pal\" outside  to look in through the window, asking to see some diamond rings. While  pretending to examine them with severe criticism, and keeping the  salesman engaged, he cleverly attached one end of the string, held by  his confederate outside, to several of the most valuable, and quietly  dropped them at his feet. His \"pal\" then quietly pulled them along the  floor, out through the door, into the street and decamped. A search of  the thief who remained behind disclosed nothing and, as proof was thus  wanting, he had to be discharged.    The female shop-lifter is generally a woman well known to the police, as  her picture will, in nearly every case, be found in the Rogues' Gallery  at Police Headquarters. Usually, when she discovers that her actions are  watched and her movements shadowed, she quietly folds her tent and  proceeds to some other city where she is comparatively a stranger, and  where, unsuspected, she can ply her nefarious occupation with less risk  of detection and capture. She is often either the wife of a gambler,  professional burglar, forger or other criminal; or she may be the wife  of some reputable mechanic whose income is insufficient to supply her  with the furbelows her vanity craves; or, again, she is one of those  women who, having a natural aversion to labor, seek to support  themselves by petty thefts.    The fact is notorious, and easily demonstrated by the records of the  police courts, that \"a shop-lifter once, a shop-lifter always.\" It is a  lamentable psychological idiosyncrasy that, despite the most earnest and  apparently sincere resolutions to lead an honest life, the female  shop-lifter, intent on making a legitimate purchase, is incapable of  withstanding the temptation offered by a display of fancy articles. She  will usually attempt to purloin some trinket or other and be caught  again. Perhaps the leniency with which crimes of this character have  been treated by the authorities has tended to increase the number of  persons engaged in committing them. For, heartless as man is at times,  he detests the idea of prosecuting a woman for the commission of a petty  theft, when the end, for her, means the penitentiary. In very many,  perhaps the majority of, cases he will be satisfied if his goods are  recovered, and permit the thief to go unpunished. This is very  frequently the case with that class of shop-lifters called, by courtesy,  the \"kleptomaniac,\"--the wealthy lady who steals what she could easily  have purchased. This is a phase of female character only accounted for  upon the Christian hypothesis that her thieving propensities are a  disease, while they are really a manifestation of the same base desires  which actuate less fortunate women who expiate their misdemeanor in the  penitentiary.    Most of the rich kleptomaniacs are well known to the various  store-keepers. A woman of this kind is watched from the moment she  enters an establishment until she leaves it. Usually, a trusty employee  or detective follows her from counter to counter, unobserved, noting all  the articles purloined. When the fair and aristocratic thief enters her  carriage and is driven to her palatial residence a bill of the goods so  \"lifted,\" addressed to the husband, follows her and, in nearly every  case, is paid upon presentation and without questioning. Thus the  transaction ends, until another visit from the lady occasions another  bill. If the \"blue-blooded\" thief enters a store, however, where she is  not known, and to the proprietor of which her \"disease\" is unsuspected,  she often escapes with her \"swag,\" like the unfortunate female who  adopts stealing as a means of subsistence. There should be no  distinction made between the wealthy and aristocratic female thief and  her less fortunate sister, for the crime is the same in both cases; the  only difference being that the latter cannot claim the possession of  riches in extenuation of her guilt.    The frequency with which thefts by shop-lifters occur, and the amount of  valuable goods stolen, has rendered store-keepers more suspicious and  cautious, probably, than any other class of men in the world. Nearly all  the large stores on Sixth avenue, Twenty-third street, Broadway,  Fourteenth street, and others, where ladies do most of their shopping,  and which are perfectly jammed with people nearly all day long, employ  either male or female detectives (and in some instances both are used),  who are constantly on the alert for the detection of female  shop-lifters. Such stores as McCreery's, Lord & Taylor's, O'Neill's,  Macy's, Simpson, Crawford & Simpson's, Hearn's, Altman's, Koch's,  Kaughran's, Ehrich's, Denning's, Stern's and Le Boutillier's are  examples. Some stores have had seats erected near the ceiling, where,  secreted among shawls and other pendant goods, the detectives are  securely hidden from the sight of all persons, and can thus watch the  actions of every woman making a purchase. Other detectives are posted at  the different entrances; while still others, having the appearance of  buyers, are constantly walking and circulating through the various  departments, on the lookout for thieves. During the holidays all these  precautions are doubled, and some officers are even posted on the  sidewalk, in front of the windows.    Before Christmas these stores carry enormous stocks of every kind of  fancy goods, and their lavish display, added to their crowded condition  at all times, renders theft easier than usual. So that, try as they may,  the proprietors cannot prevent a certain amount of thieving, and  thousands of dollars worth of goods are annually lost to each store by  the depredations of shop-lifters. Even the small shops of Third and  Eighth avenues, and Avenues A and B, are not free from the visits of  this class of thieves, and no stores are exempt from the imposition of  their tribute.    Before leaving home on a thieving excursion to the stores the female  shop-lifter carefully and systematically prepares her clothing, and sees  that it is in proper form and ready for business. This she does by first  putting on a corset made especially for the purpose, with broad, strong  bands which pass over the shoulders. Between her legs she arranges a  large bag or receptacle made of some extremely strong cloth, which is  suspended from the corset by a stout band running around the waist. Her  dress or frock covers this, and in front of the dress is an opening or  slit, nicely arranged in the folds so as not to be noticed, which leads  into the suspended bag. Over this, in winter, is worn a sealskin sacque,  cloth cloak, fur circular, or other garment, according to the means of  the wearer. In summer she wears a light shawl, which completely hides  "]]]
