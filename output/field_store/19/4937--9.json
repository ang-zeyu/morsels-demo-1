Make this nest so that when the trap is set  in it, the jaws will lie lengthwise of the trail. Line this nest with  dry grass or leaves, and having attached the trap to some sort of a  drag, set it and place it in the place prepared. Fill in all around  the outside of the jaws with dry dirt, and cover the springs. Now  lay a piece of clean paper over the trap and cover all with about  one-fourth inch of dirt, making it look like the other parts of the  trail as much as possible. The chain and drag must be carefully  concealed.    It is best to have a basket or piece of canvas in which to place the  dirt while making the set and to carry away what is not needed. Do  not spit near the trap, and do not leave any signs of your presence.  It is not necessary to wear gloves, but the hands should be kept  clean. This is an excellent method, especially for the old, sly  animals.      [Illustration: Dry Land Set for Fox.]    The professional trappers of the East use the bait method, mostly,  and although the different trappers use different baits and scents,  the methods of setting the traps are all, practically the same.    The following directions are almost the same as you will get when you  buy a method at from $1.00 to $5.00 or more. \"Prepare your bait about  a week before you want to set the traps, by cutting into pieces about  half the size of an egg, and placing in a clean jar to become  tainted. Put a little bit of scent on each bait before placing in  jar. There are different ways for preparing the traps; most trappers  prefer to boil them in hemlock boughs, or lay them over night in  running water. Wear clean gloves when handling the traps and carry  them in a clean basket. Now find an old stump or a rock along some  hillside, and dig a hole under it making the hole four or five inches  in diameter and ten or twelve inches deep. Stake the trap solid,  driving stake out of sight, and set the trap about ten inches in  front of the hole. Cover the trap first with a piece of clean paper  and finish by about one-fourth inch of dirt dug out of the hole. It  should look as if some animal had dug the hole and scratched the dirt  out in front. Use a small shovel made for the purpose, or a sharpened  stick to dig the hole, and keep your gloves on all the time. Do not  walk around, but stand in the same spot until the set is complete.  Now put a piece of bait in the back of the hole, using a sharpened  stick to handle the bait and put just a little scent by the side of  the hole. When you catch a fox, kill him without drawing blood, and  set the trap back in the same place. Your chances for catching  another fox are doubled. Skunks, coons and other animals will also be  caught in these sets.\"    The following method is a good one to use in settled countries, as it  is not so likely to catch dogs and other animals, as other methods  are. Find an ant-hill, a small, pointed knoll, an old rotten stump, a  moss covered rock, or an old log with one end off the ground. Set the  trap on the highest point, covering carefully, so that it looks just  like it did before the trap was set. Place a fair sized bait, such as  a skunk or muskrat about eight feet away from the trap. The fox is  always suspicious of a bait, especially a large one, and will always  get on the highest point to look at it before going close. Of course,  there must be no other place for him to get up on, near the bait. In  the winter, traps may be set on muskrat houses, and bait placed on  the ice. I think it best to set the traps several days before placing  the baits, as in that way the human and other scents have a chance to  pass away. When baiting, go just close enough to throw the bait into  place.    Some trappers set traps around large baits, such as the carcass of a  horse, cow or sheep, but I think it best to place the bait by the  side of a trail and set several traps on the trail from thirty to  seventy five yards from the bait. When feeding on the bait the foxes  will travel on the trail, and they will not be looking for danger so  far away from the bait.    Comparatively few of the professional fox trappers can trap the fox  successfully after the deep snow come on; but the following methods  are the best known, and will catch the fox if you use care in  setting. Of course, snow sets of any kind can only be used when the  snow is dry and loose and likely to remain in that condition for some  time.    The first method given is the one used by the Canadian Indians, for  taking the silver fox in the great northern wilderness. Out on the  ice on some frozen lake, or on any open, wind swept piece of ground,  make a cone-shaped mound of snow, beating it solid, so that it will  not drift away. The trap should be fastened to a clog, and the clog  buried in the mound. Make the mound about two feet high, and make a  hollow in the top for the trap to set in. The hollow should be lined  with cat-tail down, or some other dry material, and the trap set in  the hollow and covered first with a sheet of white note paper,  finishing with a half inch or more of loose snow. Do not handle this  snow with your hands, for if you do it will be certain to freeze on  the trap. The best way is to take a bunch of evergreen boughs, and  brush the snow up over the mound so that it sifts lightly over the  trap. The covering on the trap should be a little lower than the top  of the mound so that the wind will not uncover the trap. The bait is  cut into small pieces and stuck into the sides of the mound.    After the trap is set it will only require a short time for the wind  to drift your tracks shut and remove all traces of human presence,  and the trap will remain in working order as long as the cold weather  lasts. If water rises on the ice it will not reach your trap, and if  there is a snow storm, the first wind will blow the loose snow off  the mound, leaving just a little over the trap. When looking at the  traps you should not go nearer than fifty yards, and do not turn off  your route, but walk straight by. This is a splendid method for use  in the far north where the snow never melts or freezes during the  winter months.    For use in the settled countries I have been very successful with  this method. Find where foxes travel on old wood roads and with your  traps clean, and with drags attached, go and break a trail in the  snow by walking back and forth on the road, and set the traps in this  broken trail without bait. The traps should be set and covered, as in  the other method, and the chain and clog pushed under the snow at the  side of the trail. Do not let it appear that you have stopped at all,  and when looking at the traps you can follow the trail and step right  over the traps. In settled localities, the fox will follow the trail  because the walking is better, but in the wilderness where the track  of a man is seldom seen, they not only refuse to follow the trail,  but often will not even cross it.    I believe that scent is more used for fox-trapping than for trapping  any other animal. Some of the best trappers, however, do not use any  scent at all, but I believe that if the right kind is used, that it  is a great help. One of the best scents known for dry land or water  sets is prepared as follows: Remove the fat from one or two skunks,  chop it fine, and take a sufficient quantity to almost fill an  ordinary pickle bottle. Take two mice; cut them up and add to the fat  and let the bottle stand in the sun until the mixture is thoroughly  decomposed; then add the scent of two skunks and five or six  muskrats. The bottle must be kept covered so the flies will not blow  it, but it must not be tightly corked. Different trappers have  different ways of preparing this scent, but I think this way is the  best.    Another very good one is made by allowing the flesh of a muskrat to  rot in a bottle, and adding about four ounces of strained honey and  one-half ounce of essence of musk.    Pure fish oil is attractive to the fox, and is used by some very good  trappers. We believe that one of the most successful scents,  especially for winter use is made by taking the generative organs of  the female fox, when in heat and preserving it in alcohol. The urine  of the fox is also good, but in using these two scents, no bait  should be used.    The brine from mackerel or other fish is claimed to be a good scent  for foxes, but if there are any porcupines, or snow-shoe rabbits  about, it will make plenty of trouble as the salt is very attractive  to these animals.    When making blind-sets, or when setting on a trail some distance from  a bait, do not stake your traps, but fasten to a drag of some kind: a  brush, a stone or a grapple. By so doing the fox will not spoil the  trail for the next one, and the trap may be set back in the same  place. For a bait set on dry land, the trap may be staked to  advantage, for if one fox is caught and rolls around over the ground,  you are more likely to catch another one there.    Do not start out with a dozen traps and expect to make a success of  fox trapping. You should have all the traps that you can look after.    Do not depend on one method of setting, as a fox will sometimes learn  your method, but some other method, even if it is not so good, may  fool them.    When killing foxes in traps, do so, if possible without drawing  blood. One of the best ways is by piercing the heart with a wire  dagger. Another good way is by breaking the neck, which may be done  as follows: Strike the fox a light blow over the head with a stick,  just hard enough to slightly stun him, and when he drops down, place  your left hand on the back of his neck, pinning him to the ground and  with your right hand pull his nose backward against his back. It  requires some practice to do this right.    The track of the red fox resembles that"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/341"],[0,"Myths and Legends of the Sioux (#12)"],[1,"away from the log and this space covered with poles and willows. At  the place where the upright stick was put, a hole was left open, large  enough to admit the body of a wolf. The wolf, scenting the meat and  unable to get at it through the poles and willows, would crowd into the  hole and working his body forward, in order to get the meat, would push  down the brace and the log thus released would hold the wolf fast under  its weight.    The young man with the bracelet was placing his bait under the log when  he released the log by knocking down the brace, and the log caught his  wrist on which he wore the bracelet. He could not release himself and  called loud and long for assistance. His friends, hearing his call, came  to his assistance, and on lifting the log found the young man's wrist  broken. \"Now,\" said they, \"you have been punished for taking the  wristlet out of the chamber of the mysterious butte.\"    Some time after this a young man went to the butte and saw engraved on  the wall a woman holding in her hand a pole, with which she was holding  up a large amount of beef which had been laid across another pole, which  had broken in two from the weight of so much meat.    He returned to the camp and reported what he had seen. All around the  figure he saw marks of buffalo hoofs, also marked upon the wall.    The next day an enormous herd of buffalo came near to the village, and  a great many were killed. The women were busy cutting up and drying the  meat. At one camp was more meat than at any other. The woman was hanging  meat upon a long tent pole, when the pole broke in two and she was  obliged to hold the meat up with another pole, just as the young man saw  on the mysterious butte.    Ever after that the Indians paid weekly visits to this butte, and  thereon would read the signs that were to govern their plans.    This butte was always considered the prophet of the tribe.              THE WONDERFUL TURTLE    Near to a Chippewa village lay a large lake, and in this lake there  lived an enormous turtle. This was no ordinary turtle, as he would often  come out of his home in the lake and visit with his Indian neighbors.  He paid the most of his visits to the head chief, and on these occasions  would stay for hours, smoking and talking with him.    The chief, seeing that the turtle was very smart and showed great  wisdom in his talk, took a great fancy to him, and whenever any puzzling  subject came up before the chief, he generally sent for Mr. Turtle to  help him decide.    One day there came a great misunderstanding between different parties of  the tribe, and so excited became both sides that it threatened to cause  bloodshed. The chief was unable to decide for either faction, so he  said, \"I will call Mr. Turtle. He will judge for you.\"    Sending for the turtle, the chief vacated his seat for the time being,  until the turtle should hear both sides, and decide which was in the  right. The turtle came, and taking the chief's seat, listened very  attentively to both sides, and thought long before he gave his decision.  After thinking long and studying each side carefully, he came to the  conclusion to decide in favor of both. This would not cause any hard  feelings. So he gave them a lengthy speech and showed them where they  were both in the right, and wound up by saying:    \"You are both in the right in some ways and wrong in others. Therefore,  I will say that you both are equally in the right.\"    When they heard this decision, they saw that the turtle was right, and  gave him a long cheer for the wisdom displayed by him. The whole tribe  saw that had it not been for this wise decision there would have been a  great shedding of blood in the tribe. So they voted him as their judge,  and the chief, being so well pleased with him, gave to him his only  daughter in marriage.    The daughter of the chief was the most beautiful maiden of the Chippewa  nation, and young men from other tribes traveled hundreds of miles for  an opportunity to make love to her, and try to win her for a wife. It  was all to no purpose. She would accept no one, only him whom her father  would select for her. The turtle was very homely, but as he was prudent  and wise, the father chose him, and she accepted him.    The young men of the tribe were very jealous, but their jealousy was all  to no purpose. She married the turtle. The young men would make sport of  the chief's son-in-law. They would say to him: \"How did you come to have  so flat a stomach?\" The turtle answered them, saying:    \"My friends, had you been in my place, you too would have flat stomachs.  I came by my flat stomach in this way: The Chippewas and Sioux had  a great battle, and the Sioux, too numerous for the Chippewas, were  killing them off so fast that they had to run for their lives. I was on  the Chippewa side and some of the Sioux were pressing five of us, and  were gaining on us very fast. Coming to some high grass, I threw myself  down flat on my face, and pressed my stomach close to the ground, so  the pursuers could not see me. They passed me and killed the four I was  with. After they had gone back, I arose and lo! my stomach was as you  see it now. So hard had I pressed to the ground that it would not assume  its original shape again.\"    After he had explained the cause of his deformity to them, they said:  \"The Turtle is brave. We will bother him no more.\" Shortly after this  the Sioux made an attack upon the Chippewas, and every one deserted the  village. The Turtle could not travel as fast as the rest and was left  behind. It being an unusually hot day in the fall, the Turtle grew very  thirsty and sleepy. Finally scenting water, he crawled towards the point  from whence the scent came, and coming to a large lake jumped in and  had a bath, after which he swam towards the center and dived down, and  finding some fine large rocks at the bottom, he crawled in among them  and fell asleep. He had his sleep out and arose to the top.    Swimming to shore he found it was summer. He had slept all winter. The  birds were singing, and the green grass and leaves gave forth a sweet  odor.    He crawled out and started out looking for the Chippewa camp. He came  upon the camp several days after he had left his winter quarters, and  going around in search of his wife, found her at the extreme edge of the  village. She was nursing her baby, and as he asked to see it, she showed  it to him. When he saw that it was a lovely baby and did not resemble  him in any respect, he got angry and went off to a large lake, where he  contented himself with catching flies and insects and living on seaweed  the remainder of his life.            THE MAN AND THE OAK    There once lived a Sioux couple who had two children, a boy and a girl.  Every fall this family would move away from the main camp and take  up their winter quarters in a grove of timber some distance from the  principal village. The reason they did this was that he was a great  hunter and where a village was located for the winter the game was  usually very scarce. Therefore, he always camped by himself in order to  have an abundance of game adjacent to his camp.    All summer he had roamed around following the tribe to wherever their  fancy might take them. During their travels this particular year there  came to the village a strange girl who had no relatives there. No one  seemed very anxious to take her into their family, so the great hunter's  daughter, taking a fancy to the poor girl, took her to their home and  kept her. She addressed her as sister, and the parents, on account of  their daughter, addressed her as daughter.    This strange girl became desperately in love with the young man of the  family, but being addressed as daughter by the parents, she could not  openly show her feelings as the young man was considered her brother.    In the fall when the main village moved into a large belt of timber for  their winter quarters, the hunter moved on to another place two days'  travel from the main winter camp, where he would not be disturbed by any  other hunters.    The young man had a tent by himself, and it was always kept nice and  clean by his sister, who was very much attached to him. After a long  day's hunt in the woods, he would go into his tent and lie down to rest,  and when his supper was ready his sister would say, \"My brother is so  tired. I will carry his supper to him.\"    Her friend, whom she addressed as sister, would never go into the young  man's tent. Along towards spring there came one night into the young  man's tent a woman. She sat down by the door and kept her face covered  so that it was hidden from view. She sat there a long time and finally  arose and went away. The young man could not imagine who this could be.  He knew that it was a long distance from the village and could not make  out where the woman could have come from. The next night the woman came  again and this time she came a little nearer to where the young man lay.  She sat down and kept her face covered as before. Neither spoke a word.  She sat there for a long time and then arose and departed. He was very  much puzzled over the actions of this woman and decided to ascertain on  her next visit who she was.    He kindled a small fire in his tent and had some ash wood laid on it so  as to keep fire a long time, as ash burns very slowly and holds fire a  long time.    The third night the woman came again and sat down still nearer his bed.  She held her blanket open just a trifle, and he, catching up one of the  embers, flashed it in her face; jumping up she ran hurriedly out of the  tent. The next morning he noticed that his adopted sister kept her face  hidden with her blanket. She chanced to drop her blanket while in the  act of pouring out some soup, and when she did so he noticed a large  burned spot on her cheek.    He felt so sorry for what he had done that he could eat no breakfast,  but"]]]
