If I could have had a  couple dozen of the No. 1 1/2 Victor traps made as at the present  time, I would have been as proud as a small boy with a new pair of  boots, although I think what was lacking in modern traps was fully  made up by the number of furbearing animals.    I had been so busy during the two weeks I was in camp that I had  forgotten the day of the week; neither did I take time to kill a deer  or to go up to the road to see if anyone had written, to see if I was  dead or alive. There was a stage passed over the road twice a week. I  had nailed a box with a good tight lid on a tree by the road so that  I could send a line out home for anything I wanted or my family could  write to me.    I had two or three traps set for foxes up towards the road along the  edge of a laurel patch where there were plenty of rabbits and the  foxes worked around to catch rabbits. I thought I would go to the  road and be there about the time the stage passed along and see if I  could hear anything from pard and the folks at home and then I could  tend the traps on my way back to camp.      [Illustration: WOODCOCK AND SOME OF HIS CATCH.]    I was at the road shortly before the stage came along and was  surprised as well as delighted to see a neighbor boy by the name of  Frank Curtis aboard the stage as he had said he would come over and  stay a day or two with me in camp. Frank had not been allowed to  spend much time with a gun or traps, but like most boys, he liked a  gun. My mother died before I was eleven years old and father allowed  me to trap and hunt about as I liked.    When we got down near the traps we set our packs down--I say we, for  my folks had sent me a new supply of provisions--and went to look  after the traps. The first one had a rabbit leg in it and it was  plain to be seen that some animal had eaten the rabbit. We reset the  trap and went on to the next trap which was set in a little gorge or  hollow. A few yards below the trap two large trees had blown down  across the little hollow. The tree on the side farthest down the hill  from the trap had broken in two where it fell over the hollow and  dropped down so that it laid close to the ground while the tree on  the upper side, the side nearest the trap, lay a foot from the ground  in the hollow.    The trees were two or three feet apart right at the hollow but were  close together on one side. When we came to where the trap had been  set we found trap and drag gone and nothing in sight. We soon  discovered the animal which we supposed was a coon, had gone down the  ravine toward the two large trees that had fallen across the hollow.  We went to the logs and looked between them. There we could see the  clog but the animal was crowded back under the logs so we could see  but little of it.    Frank said that he would get between the logs and poke the coon out.  I told him that he had better let me go, as I was afraid that he  would take a hold of the clog and pull the trap loose from the coon's  foot, but Frank grabbed a stick and jumped between the logs. He had  hardly struck the ground when he gave a fearful yell and there was a  spitting, snarling animal close at his heels. He scrambled out from  between the logs, as white as a sheet. I then saw that it was a  wildcat and a mad one. I cut a good stout stick and while Frank stood  on the bank with his gun, I poked the cat from under the log by  punching it, until Frank could see it enough to shoot it. We pulled  the cat out from between the logs, took the trap from its foot, reset  it and took the cat with our traps and went to camp, declaring in our  minds that there was no other such mighty trappers as we.    Frank declared that he was nearly famished with hunger so we had  supper and then skinned the cat. We did not sleep much that night as  Frank had to tell me all about things at home. He also told me that  pard was no better. Every time an owl would hoot, or a rabbit or  porcupine or a mouse would make a noise in the leaves, Frank would  give me a punch and ask what it was. Frank remained three days in  camp and then he took the stage back home, that being as long as his  parents would allow him to stay. I went to the road to see him off.  When leaving he made many declarations that he would come back to  camp, although he never did.    The snow now began to lie on the ground as it fell and it began to  get cold at night. Coon did but little traveling and some way, after  Frank had been over to camp and stayed those three days, I seemed to  get homesick. I had not become expert enough to make a business of  deer hunting and marten and bear trapping, so I sprung the deadfalls  and took up the few steel traps that I had and began to take my furs  and other plunder to the road to take the stage home. After going  home I went to school for a few weeks.    I no longer remember how many coon, mink and other furs I caught, but  it was quite a bunch for furs were very plentiful in those days.        CHAPTER VI.    A Hunt on the Kinzua.    Comrades, as I have not been able to trap any for the past two  years--1905 and 1906--and as I have previously served for more than 50  years almost without cessation, along the trap line, I beg to be  admitted to your ranks as one of the \"Hasbeens.\"    I will therefore tell of one of my trips on a hunting and trapping  expedition in the fall and winter of 1865-6, a party of two besides  myself. My two companions' names were Charles Manly and William  Howard. We started about the 15th of October for Coudersport with a  team of horses and wagon loaded with the greater part of our outfit  and went to Emporium, Cameron County, where we hit the Philadelphia  and Erie Railroad. The only railroad that touched Northwestern  Pennsylvania at that time. Here we took the railroad to Kane, a town  in Southwestern McKean County, where we stopped one day and made  purchases for three months' camping. We hired a good team here to  take our outfit about seven or eight miles on to Kinzua Creek.    Almost the entire distance was through the woods and over the rock.  There was no sign of a road only as we went ahead of the team and cut  a tree or log here and there. The outfit was lashed onto a bobsled,  and as we had bargained with the man to make the trip for a stated  price, he did not seem to care whether there was any road or not, so  that he got through as quickly as possible.    We reached the stream about noon. The man fed his team some oats,  swallowed a few mouthsful himself and was soon on his way back to  town, while we began laying plans for our camp. We selected a spot on  a little rise of ground near a good spring of water, and where there  was plenty of small yellow birch trees handy to cut logs out of for  camp. We placed a good sized log down first at the end of the shanty  that we intended to build the fire place in. Another was placed at  the end that was to be the highest, so to give the right slope to the  roof, which was a shed roof. We always kept the large ends of the  logs one way, so that when we had the logs rolled up it made the  lower or eaves end of the camp about five feet high.    There was a slope of about two feet for the roof. We felled bass wood  trees which we split in half, and then dug or scooped them out so as  to make a trough. We notched the two end logs down and then placed  the scoops or troughs in these notches so that they would lay firm  with the hollow side up.    After placing these scoops across the entire width of the shack we  then placed another layer of the scoops (reverse) on the first set.  That is to say, the rounding side up. This made a very good roof but  required a good deal of chinking at the ends to keep the cold out,  but as moss was plenty, it was not a long job. The second day after  we got into the woods we had the camp in pretty good shape, well  chinked and calked.    The third day we worked on the fire place, laying it up to the jam of  stone, then we finished the chimney with logs and mud. We had a  fairly comfortable camp with but two exceptions. These were, no  windows, and for a door we had what I called a \"hoghole,\" that was a  door so small that one had to get down on all fours to get in or out.  On the fourth day we intended to cut wood all day, and were at it  before it was fairly light, but before 10 o'clock it began to snow.  In a couple of hours there was a good tracking snow and the boys were  bound to go out and see if they could not kill a deer. I tried hard  to get them to stick to the wood job, but it was no use, they must go  hunting.    There was no partnership business in this hunt. It was every man for  himself, and the dogs, take the hindermost. I told the boys I would  stay in camp and do something at the wood job.    I had been along the creek a little the day before, poking my nose  under the banks and old drifts to see what manner of signs I could  see, and I had noticed several mink tracks. The boys had no more than  gone when I had a fishing tackle rigged out. It consisted of a line  braided from horsehair, out of a horse's tail, and a hook baited with  some bits of fat pork. It did the business, for the stream fairly  swarmed with trout. Taking three or four trout for bait, I was soon  at work building deadfalls. It was not long before I had three or  four built close up under the banks and behind logs where I thought  the boys would not see them.    I then scampered back to camp and went to cutting wood like a good  boy. I had only just got to camp when I heard a gun shot away up the  creek, and in about an hour Charley came dragging a yearling deer.  Will did not show up for some time after dark, but had nothing,  though he said that he had a fair standing shot at a large buck, but  his gun snapped on him and he lost.    The next morning we were out at the peep of day, each one going his  own way. I went down the creek so that I could take "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3407"],[0,"The Spell of Egypt (#12)"],[1,"spirit.\" But the other two sitting up, look as apprehensive as old  ladies in a rocking express, expectant of an accident. The vividness  of the colors in this temple is quite wonderful. And much of its  great attraction comes rather from its position, and from them,  than essentially from itself. At Deir-el-Bahari, what the long shell  contains--its happy murmur of life--is more fascinating than the shell.  There, instead of being uplifted or overawed by form, we are rejoiced  by color, by the high vivacity of arrested movement, by the story that  color and movement tell. And over all there is the bright, blue, painted  sky, studded, almost distractedly studded, with a plethora of the yellow  stars the Egyptians made like starfish.    The restored apricot-colored columns outside look unhappily suburban  when you are near them. The white columns with their architraves are  more pleasant to the eyes. The niches full of bright hues, the arched  chapels, the small white steps leading upward to shallow  sanctuaries, the small black foxes facing each other on little yellow  pedestals--attract one like the details and amusing ornaments of a  clever woman's boudoir. Through this most characteristic temple one  roves in a gaily attentive mood, feeling all the time Hatshepsu's  fascination.    You may see her, if you will, a little lady on the wall, with a face  decidedly sensual--a long, straight nose, thick lips, an expression  rather determined than agreeable. Her mother looks as Semitic as a Jew  moneylender in Brick Lane, London. Her husband, Thothmes II., has a weak  and poor-spirited countenance--decidedly an accomplished performer on  the second violin. The mother wears on her head a snake, no doubt a  cobra-di-capello, the symbol of her sovereignty. Thothmes is clad in  a loin-cloth. And a god, with a sleepy expression and a very fish-like  head, appears in this group of personages to offer the key of life.  Another painting of the queen shows her on her knees drinking milk from  the sacred cow, with an intent and greedy figure, and an extraordinarily  sensual and expressive face. That she was well guarded is surely proved  by a brave display of her soldiers--red men on a white wall. Full  of life and gaiety all in a row they come, holding weapons, and,  apparently, branches, and advancing with a gait of triumph that tells of  \"spacious days.\" And at their head is an officer, who looks back, much  like a modern drill sergeant, to see how his men are marching.    In the southern shrine of the temple, cut in the rock as is the northern  shrine, once more I found traces of the \"Lady of the Under-World.\" For  this shrine was dedicated to Hathor, though the whole temple was sacred  to the Theban god Amun. Upon a column were the remains of the goddess's  face, with a broad brow and long, large eyes. Some fanatic had hacked  away the mouth.    The tomb of Hatshepsu was found by Mr. Theodore M. Davis, and the famous  _Vache_ of Deir-el-Bahari by Monsieur Naville as lately as 1905. It  stands in the museum at Cairo, but for ever it will be connected in the  minds of men with the tiger-colored precipices and the Colonnades of  Thebes. Behind the ruins of the temple of Mentu-Hotep III., in a chapel  of painted rock, the Vache-Hathor was found.    It is not easy to convey by any description the impression this  marvellous statue makes. Many of us love our dogs, our horses, some  of us adore our cats; but which of us can think, without a smile, of  worshipping a cow? Yet the cow was the Egyptian Aphrodite's sacred  animal. Under the form of a cow she was often represented. And in the  statue she is presented to us as a limestone cow. And positively this  cow is to be worshipped.    She is shown in the act apparently of stepping gravely forward out of  a small arched shrine, the walls of which are decorated with brilliant  paintings. Her color is red and yellowish red, and is covered with dark  blotches of a very dark green, which look almost black. Only one or two  are of a bluish color. Her height is moderate. I stand about five foot  nine, and I found that on her pedestal the line of her back was about  level with my chest. The lower part of the body, much of which is  concealed by the under block of limestone, is white, tinged with yellow.  The tail is red. Above the head, open and closed lotus-flowers form  a head-dress, with the lunar disk and two feathers. And the long  lotus-stalks flow down on each side of the neck toward the ground. At  the back of this head-dress are a scarab and a cartouche. The goddess  is advancing solemnly and gently. A wonderful calm, a matchless, serene  dignity, enfold her.    In the body of this cow one is able, indeed one is almost obliged, to  feel the soul of a goddess. The incredible is accomplished. The dead  Egyptian makes the ironic, the skeptical modern world feel deity in a  limestone cow. How is it done? I know not; but it is done. Genius can  do nearly everything, it seems. Under the chin of the cow there is a  standing statue of the King Mentu-Hotep, and beneath her the king kneels  as a boy. Wonderfully expressive and solemnly refined is the cow's face,  which is of dark color, like the color of almost black earth--earth  fertilized by the Nile. Dignified, dominating, almost but just not  stern, strongly intelligent, and, through its beautiful intelligence,  entirely sympathetic (\"to understand all, is to pardon all\"), this face,  once thoroughly seen, completely noticed, can never be forgotten. This  is one of the most beautiful statues in the world.    When I was at Deir-el-Bahari I thought of it and wished that it still  stood there near the Colonnades of Thebes under the tiger-colored  precipices. And then I thought of Hatshepsu. Surely she would not brook  a rival to-day near the temple which she made--a rival long lost and  long forgotten. Is not her influence still there upon the terraced  platforms, among the apricot and the white columns, near the paintings  of the land of Punt? Did it not whisper to the antiquaries, even to the  soldiers from Cairo, who guarded the Vache-Hathor in the night, to make  haste to take her away far from the hills of Thebes and from the Nile's  long southern reaches, that the great queen might once more reign  alone? They obeyed. Hatshepsu was appeased. And, like a delicate woman,  perfumed and arranged, clothed in a creation of white and blue and  orange, standing ever so knowingly against a background of orange and  pink, of red and of brown-red, she rules at Deir-el-Bahari.          XIII    THE TOMBS OF THE KINGS    On the way to the tombs of the kings I went to the temple of Kurna,  that lonely cenotaph, with its sand-colored massive facade, its heaps  of fallen stone, its wide and ruined doorway, its thick, almost rough,  columns recalling Medinet-Abu. There is not very much to see, but from  there one has a fine view of other temples--of the Ramesseum, looking  superb, like a grand skeleton; of Medinet-Abu, distant, very pale gold  in the morning sunlight; of little Deir-al-Medinet, the pretty child of  the Ptolemies, with the heads of the seven Hathors. And from Kurna the  Colossi are exceptionally grand and exceptionally personal, so personal  that one imagines one sees the expressions of the faces that they no  longer possess.    Even if you do not go into the tombs--but you will go--you must ride  to the tombs of the kings; and you must, if you care for the finesse of  impressions, ride on a blazing day and toward the hour of noon. Then the  ravine is itself, like the great act that demonstrates a temperament.  It is the narrow home of fire, hemmed in by brilliant colors, nearly  all--perhaps quite all--of which could be found in a glowing furnace.  Every shade of yellow is there--lemon yellow, sulphur yellow, the yellow  of amber, the yellow of orange with its tendency toward red, the yellow  of gold, sand color, sun color. Cannot all these yellows be found in a  fire? And there are the reds--pink of the carnation, pink of the coral,  red of the little rose that grows in certain places of sands, red of  the bright flame's heart. And all these colors are mingled in complete  sterility. And all are fused into a fierce brotherhood by the sun. and  like a flood, they seem flowing to the red and the yellow mountains,  like a flood that is flowing to its sea. You are taken by them toward  the mountains, on and on, till the world is closing in, and you know the  way must come to an end. And it comes to an end--in a tomb.    You go to a door in the rock, and a guardian lets you in, and wants to  follow you in. Prevent him if you can. Pay him. Go in alone. For this  is the tomb of Amenhotep II.; and he himself is here, far down, at rest  under the mountain, this king who lived and reigned more than fourteen  hundred years before the birth of Christ. The ravine-valley leads to  him, and you should go to him alone. He lies in the heart of the living  rock, in the dull heat of the earth's bowels, which is like no other  heat. You descend by stairs and corridors, you pass over a well by a  bridge, you pass through a naked chamber; and the king is not there. And  you go on down another staircase, and along another corridor, and you  come into a pillared chamber, with paintings on its walls, and on  its pillars, paintings of the king in the presence of the gods of the  underworld, under stars in a soft blue sky. And below you, shut in on  the farther side by the solid mountain in whose breast you have all this  time been walking, there is a crypt. And you turn away from the bright  paintings, and down there you see the king.    Many years ago in London I went to the private view of the Royal Academy  at Burlington House. I went in the afternoon, when the galleries were  crowded with politicians and artists, with dealers, gossips, quidnuncs,  and _flaneurs_; with authors, fashionable lawyers, and doctors; with men  and women of the world;"]]]
