[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2871"],[0,"The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication â€” Volume 1 (#12)"],[1,"gives a curious account (1/74. 'History of Quadrupeds' 1793  volume 1 page 238.) of the manner in which Fochabers, in Scotland, was  stocked \"with a multitude of curs of a most wolfish aspect\" from a single  hybrid-wolf brought into that district.    It would appear that climate to a certain extent directly modifies the  forms of dogs. We have lately seen that several of our English breeds  cannot live in India, and it is positively asserted that when bred there  for a few generations they degenerate not only in their mental faculties,  but in form. Captain Williamson (1/75. 'Oriental Field Sports' quoted by  Youatt 'The Dog' page 15.), who carefully attended to this subject, states  that \"hounds are the most rapid in their decline;\" \"greyhounds and  pointers, also, rapidly decline.\" But spaniels, after eight or nine  generations, and without a cross from Europe, are as good as their  ancestors. Dr. Falconer informs me that bulldogs, which have been known,  when first brought into the country, to pin down even an elephant by its  trunk, not only fall off after two or three generations in pluck and  ferocity, but lose the under-hung character of their lower jaws; their  muzzles become finer and their bodies lighter. English dogs imported into  India are so valuable that probably due care has been taken to prevent  their crossing with native dogs; so that the deterioration cannot be thus  accounted for. The Rev. R. Everest informs me that he obtained a pair of  setters, born in India, which perfectly resembled their Scotch parents: he  raised several litters from them in Delhi, taking the most stringent  precautions to prevent a cross, but he never succeeded, though this was  only the second generation in India, in obtaining a single young dog like  its parents in size or make; their nostrils were more contracted, their  noses more pointed, their size inferior, and their limbs more slender. So  again on the coast of Guinea, dogs, according to Bosman, \"alter strangely;  their ears grow long and stiff like those of foxes, to which colour they  also incline, so that in three or four years, they degenerate into very  ugly creatures; and in three or four broods their barking turns into a  howl.\" (1/76. A. Murray gives this passage in his 'Geographical  Distribution of Mammals' 4to 1866 page 8.) This remarkable tendency to  rapid deterioration in European dogs subjected to the climate of India and  Africa, may be largely accounted for by reversion to a primordial condition  which many animals exhibit, as we shall hereafter see, when their  constitutions are in any way disturbed.    Some of the peculiarities characteristic of the several breeds of the dog  have probably arisen suddenly, and, though strictly inherited, may be  called monstrosities; for instance, the shape of the legs and body in the  turnspit of Europe and India; the shape of the head and the under-hanging  jaw in the bull-and pug-dog, so alike in this one respect and so unlike in  all others. A peculiarity suddenly arising, and therefore in one sense  deserving to be called a monstrosity, may, however, be increased and fixed  by man's selection. We can hardly doubt that long-continued training, as  with the greyhound in coursing hares, as with water-dogs in swimming--and  the want of exercise, in the case of lapdogs--must have produced some  direct effect on their structure and instincts. But we shall immediately  see that the most potent cause of change has probably been the selection,  both methodical and unconscious, of slight individual differences,--the  latter kind of selection resulting from the occasional preservation, during  hundreds of generations, of those individual dogs which were the most  useful to man for certain purposes and under certain conditions of life. In  a future chapter on Selection I shall show that even barbarians attend  closely to the qualities of their dogs. This unconscious selection by man  would be aided by a kind of natural selection; for the dogs of savages have  partly to gain their own subsistence: for instance, in Australia, as we  hear from Mr. Nind (1/77. Quoted by Mr. Galton 'Domestication of Animals'  page 13.), the dogs are sometimes compelled by want to leave their masters  and provide for themselves; but in a few days they generally return. And we  may infer that dogs of different shapes, sizes, and habits, would have the  best chance of surviving under different circumstances,--on open sterile  plains, where they have to run down their own prey,--on rocky coasts, where  they have to feed on crabs and fish left in the tidal pools, as in the case  of New Guinea and Tierra del Fuego. In this latter country, as I am  informed by Mr. Bridges, the Catechist to the Mission, the dogs turn over  the stones on the shore to catch the crustaceans which lie beneath, and  they \"are clever enough to knock off the shell-fish at a first blow;\" for  if this be not done, shell-fish are well-known to have an almost invincible  power of adhesion.    It has already been remarked that dogs differ in the degree to which their  feet are webbed. In dogs of the Newfoundland breed, which are eminently  aquatic in their habits, the skin, according to Isidore Geoffroy (1/78.  'Hist. Nat. Gen.' tome 3 page 450.), extends to the third phalanges whilst  in ordinary dogs it extends only to the second. In two Newfoundland dogs  which I examined, when the toes were stretched apart and viewed on the  under side, the skin extended in a nearly straight line between the outer  margins of the balls of the toes; whereas, in two terriers of distinct sub-  breeds, the skin viewed in the same manner was deeply scooped out. In  Canada there is a dog which is peculiar to the country and common there,  and this has \"half-webbed feet and is fond of the water.\" (1/79. Mr.  Greenhow on the Canadian Dog in Loudon's 'Mag. of Nat. Hist.' volume 6 1833  page 511.) English otter-hounds are said to have webbed feet: a friend  examined for me the feet of two, in comparison with the feet of some  harriers and bloodhounds; he found the skin variable in extent in all, but  more developed in the otter-hounds than in the others. (1/80. See Mr. C.O.  Groom-Napier on the webbing of the hind feet of Otterhounds in 'Land and  Water' October 13, 1866 page 270.) As aquatic animals which belong to quite  different orders have webbed feet, there can be no doubt that this  structure would be serviceable to dogs that frequent the water. We may  confidently infer that no man ever selected his water-dogs by the extent to  which the skin was developed between their toes; but what he does, is to  preserve and breed from those individuals which hunt best in the water, or  best retrieve wounded game, and thus he unconsciously selects dogs with  feet slightly better webbed. The effects of use from the frequent  stretching apart of the toes will likewise aid in the result. Man thus  closely imitates Natural Selection. We have an excellent illustration of  this same process in North America, where, according to Sir J. Richardson  (1/81. 'Fauna Boreali-Americana' 1829 page 62.), all the wolves, foxes, and  aboriginal domestic dogs have their feet broader than in the corresponding  species of the Old World, and \"well calculated for running on the snow.\"  Now, in these Arctic regions, the life or death of every animal will often  depend on its success in hunting over the snow when soft; and this will in  part depend on the feet being broad; yet they must not be so broad as to  interfere with the activity of the animal when the ground is sticky, or  with its power of burrowing holes, or with other necessary habits of life.    As changes in domestic breeds which take place so slowly are not to be  noticed at any one period, whether due to the selection of individual  variations or of differences resulting from crosses, are most important in  understanding the origin of our domestic productions, and likewise in  throwing indirect light on the changes effected under nature, I will give  in detail such cases as I have been able to collect. Lawrence (1/82. 'The  Horse in all his Varieties, etc.' 1829 pages 230, 234.), who paid  particular attention to the history of the foxhound, writing in 1829, says  that between eighty and ninety years before \"an entirely new foxhound was  raised through the breeder's art,\" the ears of the old southern hound being  reduced, the bone and bulk lightened, the waist increased in length, and  the stature somewhat added to. It is believed that this was effected by a  cross with a greyhound. With respect to this latter dog, Youatt (1/83. 'The  Dog' 1845 pages 31, 35; with respect to King Charles' spaniel page 45; for  the setter page 90.), who is generally cautious in his statements, says  that the greyhound within the last fifty years, that is before the  commencement of the present century, \"assumed a somewhat different  character from that which he once possessed. He is now distinguished by a  beautiful symmetry of form, of which he could not once boast, and he has  even superior speed to that which he formerly exhibited. He is no longer  used to struggle with deer, but contends with his fellows over a shorter  and speedier course.\" An able writer (1/84. In the 'Encyclop. of Rural  Sports' page 557.) believes that our English greyhounds are the  descendants, PROGRESSIVELY IMPROVED, of the large rough greyhounds which  existed in Scotland so early as the third century. A cross at some former  period with the Italian greyhound has been suspected; but this seems hardly  probable, considering the feebleness of this latter breed. Lord Orford, as  is well-known, crossed his famous greyhounds, which failed in courage, with  a bulldog--this breed being chosen from being erroneously supposed to be  deficient in the power of scent; \"after the sixth or seventh generation,\"  says Youatt, \"there was not a vestige left of the form of the bulldog, but  his courage and "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28711"],[0,"Operas Every Child Should Know (#12)"],[1,"of the  hullabaloo, and everybody is shouting for her.    Carmen leads in everything. She leads in good and she leads in bad.  She makes the best and the worst cigarettes, she is the quickest and  she is the slowest, as the mood moves her; and now, when she flashes  on to the stage in red and yellow fringes and bedraggled finery,  cigarette in mouth and bangles tinkling, opera has given to the stage  the supreme puzzle of humanity: the woman who does always what she  pleases, and who pleases never to do the thing expected of her!    The first man she sees when she comes from the factory is Jose. The  first thing that she pleases to do is to make Jose love her. It will  be good fun for the noon hour. She has her friends with her, Frasquita  and Mercedes, and all are in the mood for a frolic. They sing:    [Music:         Love is like any wood-bird wild,       That none can ever hope to tame;       And in vain is all wooing mild       If he refuse your heart to claim.       Naught avails, neither threat nor prayer,       One speaks me fair--the other sighs,       'Tis the other that I prefer,       Tho' mute, his heart to mine replies.]    While Carmen sings, her eyes do not leave Don Jose, and he is watching  her in spite of himself. The racket continues till the factory bell  rings to call the crowd back to work. Carmen goes reluctantly, and as  she goes, she throws a flower at Jose.         This little flower gave me a start       Like a ball aimed fair at my heart!    he says, half smiling, half seriously, as he picks it up. While he  stands thus, looking toward the factory, holding the flower, thinking  of Carmen, Michaela comes back into the square. They espy each other,  and a sudden warmth and tenderness come upon Jose: after all, he loves  her dearly--and there is his old mother! His better self responds:  Jose, in imagination, sees the little house in the hills where he  lived as a boy before he went soldiering. He recalls vividly for the  first time in months, those who are faithful to him, and for a moment  he loves them as they love him. They speak together. Michaela gives  him the note from his mother. There is money in it: she has thought he  might be in debt, or in other trouble and need it. Jose is surprised  by the tears in his own eyes--it is a far cry from gay Seville to the  little house among the hills!    \"Go back to mother, Michaela, tell her I am going to get leave as soon  as I can and am coming back to her and you. I am going to play fair.  There's not much in life, otherwise. Go home and tell her I am coming,  and I mean to make you both as happy as once I meant to.\"    His sudden tenderness enraptures the young girl, and kissing him she  sets out to leave Seville with a glad heart. Jose, left alone, on  guard, his life and thought interrupted by this incident of home and  faithfulness, leans thoughtfully upon his musket.    \"It hasn't been quite right, and I am not happy. We'll change all  this,\" he meditates.    As the afternoon sun grows hot the citizens begin to creep within  doors for the _siesta_, as all Spanish life seems to grow tired and  still in the burning day. Suddenly the silence is broken by a scream  from over the way. Jose starts up and looks across.    \"Hey, there! what the devil!\" Zuniga shouts from the guard-house, and  runs out. \"Hello, hello! Jose, look alive there! What's gone  wrong?--what the----\" And the men start to run across the square.    \"Help, help!\" comes from the factory. \"Will no one come? We're being  killed--the she-devil--look out for her--Carmen! Look out for her--she  has a knife!\" Every one is screaming at once and trying each in his  own way to tell what has happened.    \"Get in there, Jose, and bring out the girl. Arrest the gipsy; and you  men here get into this crowd and quiet it down. Make those girls shut  up. Why, what the devil, I say! one would think a lunatic asylum  loose. You've got the girl, Jose?\" he calls across as the corporal  brings Carmen out. \"Bring her over,\" and Zuniga starts across to meet  them, clattering on the cobblestones with his high heels.    \"She knifed one of the girls, did she? All right--clap her into jail.  You're just a bit too ready with your hands, my girl,\" the captain  cries as Jose takes her into the guard-house.    Jose is set to guard her; which is about as wise as setting the cream  where the cat can dip her whiskers.    If it pleased the girl a moment before to stab a companion, it pleases  her best now to get out of jail. She begins ably.    \"I love you,\" she remarks to Jose.    \"It does not concern me,\" replies the heroic Jose.    \"It should,\" Carmen persists.    \"Ah!\" replies Jose, noncommittally. This is unsatisfactory to Carmen.  However, she is equal to the occasion. When is she so fascinating as  when quite preoccupied?--she will try it now. She will sing:    [Music:         Near to the walls of Sevilla       With my good friend Lillas Pastia       I'll soon dance the gay Seguidilla       And I'll drink manzanilla--       I'll go see my good friend Lillas Pastia!]    Jose is disturbed. Carmen is conscious of it. She continues to sing,  meanwhile coquetting with him. Before he is aware of his own mood, he  has cut the cord that he bound her hands with, and has disgraced  himself forever. In the fascination Carmen has for him, he has  forgotten that he is a soldier. Presently Zuniga enters. Carmen is to  be transferred in charge of Jose, with a guard detailed to go with  him. It is arranged. Carmen also makes some arrangements.    \"When we have started, and are about to cross the bridge, I'll give  you a push. You must fall--you could not see me locked up--one so  young and gay!--and when you fall I shall run. After you can get away,  meet me at Lillas Pastia's inn.\" Jose seems to himself to be doing  things in a dream. He has earned a court-martial already if it were  known what he has done. A corporal's guard start under Jose; the  bridge is reached. Carmen makes a leap; down goes Jose. The others are  taken unawares and she rushes at them. They too fall, head over heels,  one down the bank. Carmen is up, and off! She flies up the path,  laughing at them as they pick themselves up.    \"This is a good business, eh?\" Zuniga sneers. \"On the whole, Don Jose,  I think you will shine rather better under lock and key, in the  guard-house, than you will as a soldier at large. Men, arrest him!\" he  orders sharply, and Jose has made the first payment on the score Fate  has chalked up against him.      ACT II    Flying to Lillas Pastia's inn, as she had agreed with Jose, Carmen is  joined by her old comrades--smugglers and gipsy girls, chief of whom  are Mercedes and Frasquita. It is late at night, and a carouse is in  progress. Among those in the inn is Zuniga himself. As a matter of  truth, he has fallen in love with Carmen on his own account, and has  kept Jose under arrest in order to have him out of the way. There they  are, all together, the gipsies playing on guitars and tambourines. The  girls are mostly dancing. Carmen is coquetting with every man present,  and the fun becomes a riot, so that the innkeeper has to interfere.    \"It is so late, I've got to close up,\" he says. \"You'll all have to  clear out.\" Zuniga looks at Carmen. He wants to have a talk with her.    \"Will you go with me?\" he asks.    \"I've no good reason for going with you,\" she answers, tantalizingly.    \"Perhaps you're angry because I have locked Jose up,\" Zuniga suggests.  \"If you will make yourself agreeable, I don't mind telling you I have  had him set free.\"    \"What's that? Not in prison?\" she asked. \"Well, that's very decent of  you, I'm sure,\" she sneers. \"Good-night, gentlemen, I'm off!\" she  cries, and runs out into the night. Everybody follows her but Zuniga,  who knows well enough he cannot trust her. They have no sooner  disappeared than Zuniga hears shouts and \"hurrahs\" outside. He runs to  the window and leans out.    \"Hello! They are going to have a torch-light procession, eh?\" and he  leans farther out. \"By the great horn spoon,\" he presently  exclaims--or something which is its Spanish equivalent, \"it's that  bull-fighting fellow, Escamillo, who won that fight in Granada! Hello,  out there, old friend! Come in here and have something to drink with  me. To your past success and to your future glory!\" Motioning to the  bull-fighter outside, Zuniga goes toward the door. In he comes, this  Escamillo, all covered with the glory of having killed some frisky  and dangerous bulls--with all the chances against the bulls,  nevertheless. Everybody else enters with Escamillo and all stand ready  for refreshments at Zuniga's expense. Carmen comes back, and of course  is to be found in the thick of the fun.    \"Rah, rah, rah!\" everybody yells, calling a toast to the bull-fighter,  who is dressed up till he looks as fine as a little wagon. The toast  suits him perfectly and he says so. He squares himself and strikes an  attitude of grandeur without the least doubt that he is the greatest  thing in the world, and while he is singing about it, half the people  in the opera house are likely to agree with him. Here he goes:    [Music:         For a toast your own will avail me,       Senors, senors!       For all you men of war,       Like all Toreros, as brother hail me!       In a fight, in a fight we both take delight!         'Tis holiday, the circus full,       The circus full from rim to floor:       The lookers on, beyond control,       The lookers on now begin to murmur and roar!       Some are calling,       And others bawling       And howling too, with might and main!       For they await a sight appalling!       'Tis the day of the brave of Spain!       Come on! make ready!       Come on! Come on! Ah!         Toreador, make ready!       Toreador! Toreador!       And think on her, on her, who all can see:       On a dark eyed lady,       And that love waits for thee, Toreador,       Love waits, love waits for"]]]
