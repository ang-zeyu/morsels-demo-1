Simply as a mental exercise, without  any assertion that it is true, let me indicate a possible line of  thought. It is, I admit, mere imagination; but how often is imagination  the mother of truth?    \"We will suppose that there was a guilty secret, a really shameful  secret in the life of this man Douglas. This leads to his murder by  someone who is, we will suppose, an avenger, someone from outside.  This avenger, for some reason which I confess I am still at a loss  to explain, took the dead man's wedding ring. The vendetta might  conceivably date back to the man's first marriage, and the ring be taken  for some such reason.    \"Before this avenger got away, Barker and the wife had reached the room.  The assassin convinced them that any attempt to arrest him would lead  to the publication of some hideous scandal. They were converted to  this idea, and preferred to let him go. For this purpose they probably  lowered the bridge, which can be done quite noiselessly, and then raised  it again. He made his escape, and for some reason thought that he could  do so more safely on foot than on the bicycle. He therefore left his  machine where it would not be discovered until he had got safely away.  So far we are within the bounds of possibility, are we not?\"    \"Well, it is possible, no doubt,\" said I, with some reserve.    \"We have to remember, Watson, that whatever occurred is certainly  something very extraordinary. Well, now, to continue our supposititious  case, the couple--not necessarily a guilty couple--realize after the  murderer is gone that they have placed themselves in a position in  which it may be difficult for them to prove that they did not themselves  either do the deed or connive at it. They rapidly and rather clumsily  met the situation. The mark was put by Barker's bloodstained slipper  upon the windowsill to suggest how the fugitive got away. They obviously  were the two who must have heard the sound of the gun; so they gave the  alarm exactly as they would have done, but a good half hour after the  event.\"    \"And how do you propose to prove all this?\"    \"Well, if there were an outsider, he may be traced and taken. That would  be the most effective of all proofs. But if not--well, the resources of  science are far from being exhausted. I think that an evening alone in  that study would help me much.\"    \"An evening alone!\"    \"I propose to go up there presently. I have arranged it with the  estimable Ames, who is by no means wholehearted about Barker. I shall  sit in that room and see if its atmosphere brings me inspiration. I'm  a believer in the genius loci. You smile, Friend Watson. Well, we shall  see. By the way, you have that big umbrella of yours, have you not?\"    \"It is here.\"    \"Well, I'll borrow that if I may.\"    \"Certainly--but what a wretched weapon! If there is danger--\"    \"Nothing serious, my dear Watson, or I should certainly ask for your  assistance. But I'll take the umbrella. At present I am only awaiting  the return of our colleagues from Tunbridge Wells, where they are at  present engaged in trying for a likely owner to the bicycle.\"    It was nightfall before Inspector MacDonald and White Mason came back  from their expedition, and they arrived exultant, reporting a great  advance in our investigation.    \"Man, I'll admeet that I had my doubts if there was ever an outsider,\"  said MacDonald, \"but that's all past now. We've had the bicycle  identified, and we have a description of our man; so that's a long step  on our journey.\"    \"It sounds to me like the beginning of the end,\" said Holmes. \"I'm sure  I congratulate you both with all my heart.\"    \"Well, I started from the fact that Mr. Douglas had seemed disturbed  since the day before, when he had been at Tunbridge Wells. It was at  Tunbridge Wells then that he had become conscious of some danger. It was  clear, therefore, that if a man had come over with a bicycle it was  from Tunbridge Wells that he might be expected to have come. We took the  bicycle over with us and showed it at the hotels. It was identified at  once by the manager of the Eagle Commercial as belonging to a man named  Hargrave, who had taken a room there two days before. This bicycle and  a small valise were his whole belongings. He had registered his name  as coming from London, but had given no address. The valise was London  made, and the contents were British; but the man himself was undoubtedly  an American.\"    \"Well, well,\" said Holmes gleefully, \"you have indeed done some solid  work while I have been sitting spinning theories with my friend! It's a  lesson in being practical, Mr. Mac.\"    \"Ay, it's just that, Mr. Holmes,\" said the inspector with satisfaction.    \"But this may all fit in with your theories,\" I remarked.    \"That may or may not be. But let us hear the end, Mr. Mac. Was there  nothing to identify this man?\"    \"So little that it was evident that he had carefully guarded himself  against identification. There were no papers or letters, and no marking  upon the clothes. A cycle map of the county lay on his bedroom table. He  had left the hotel after breakfast yesterday morning on his bicycle, and  no more was heard of him until our inquiries.\"    \"That's what puzzles me, Mr. Holmes,\" said White Mason. \"If the fellow  did not want the hue and cry raised over him, one would imagine that he  would have returned and remained at the hotel as an inoffensive tourist.  As it is, he must know that he will be reported to the police by the  hotel manager and that his disappearance will be connected with the  murder.\"    \"So one would imagine. Still, he has been justified of his wisdom up  to date, at any rate, since he has not been taken. But his  description--what of that?\"    MacDonald referred to his notebook. \"Here we have it so far as they  could give it. They don't seem to have taken any very particular stock  of him; but still the porter, the clerk, and the chambermaid are all  agreed that this about covers the points. He was a man about five foot  nine in height, fifty or so years of age, his hair slightly grizzled, a  grayish moustache, a curved nose, and a face which all of them described  as fierce and forbidding.\"    \"Well, bar the expression, that might almost be a description of Douglas  himself,\" said Holmes. \"He is just over fifty, with grizzled hair and  moustache, and about the same height. Did you get anything else?\"    \"He was dressed in a heavy gray suit with a reefer jacket, and he wore a  short yellow overcoat and a soft cap.\"    \"What about the shotgun?\"    \"It is less than two feet long. It could very well have fitted into  his valise. He could have carried it inside his overcoat without  difficulty.\"    \"And how do you consider that all this bears upon the general case?\"    \"Well, Mr. Holmes,\" said MacDonald, \"when we have got our man--and you  may be sure that I had his description on the wires within five minutes  of hearing it--we shall be better able to judge. But, even as it stands,  we have surely gone a long way. We know that an American calling himself  Hargrave came to Tunbridge Wells two days ago with bicycle and valise.  In the latter was a sawed-off shotgun; so he came with the deliberate  purpose of crime. Yesterday morning he set off for this place on his  bicycle, with his gun concealed in his overcoat. No one saw him arrive,  so far as we can learn; but he need not pass through the village  to reach the park gates, and there are many cyclists upon the road.  Presumably he at once concealed his cycle among the laurels where it  was found, and possibly lurked there himself, with his eye on the house,  waiting for Mr. Douglas to come out. The shotgun is a strange weapon to  use inside a house; but he had intended to use it outside, and there it  has very obvious advantages, as it would be impossible to miss with it,  and the sound of shots is so common in an English sporting neighbourhood  that no particular notice would be taken.\"    \"That is all very clear,\" said Holmes.    \"Well, Mr. Douglas did not appear. What was he to do next? He left his  bicycle and approached the house in the twilight. He found the bridge  down and no one about. He took his chance, intending, no doubt, to make  some excuse if he met anyone. He met no one. He slipped into the first  room that he saw, and concealed himself behind the curtain. Thence he  could see the drawbridge go up, and he knew that his only escape was  through the moat. He waited until quarter-past eleven, when Mr. Douglas  upon his usual nightly round came into the room. He shot him and  escaped, as arranged. He was aware that the bicycle would be described  by the hotel people and be a clue against him; so he left it there and  made his way by some other means to London or to some safe hiding place  which he had already arranged. How is that, Mr. Holmes?\"    \"Well, Mr. Mac, it is very good and very clear so far as it goes. That  is your end of the story. My end is that the crime was committed half an  hour earlier than reported; that Mrs. Douglas and Barker are both in  a conspiracy to conceal something; that they aided the murderer's  escape--or at least that they reached the room before he escaped--and  that they fabricated evidence of his escape through the window, whereas  in all probability they had themselves let him go by lowering the  bridge. That's my reading of the first half.\"    The two detectives shook their heads.    \"Well, Mr. Holmes, if this is true, we only tumble out of one mystery  into another,\" said the London inspector.    \"And in some ways a worse one,\" added White Mason. \"The lady has never  been in America in all her life. What possible connection could she have  with an American assassin which would cause her to shelter him?\"  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3291"],[0,"John Marshall and the Constitution, a Chronicle of the Supreme Court (#12)"],[1,"Aaron Burr, late Vice-President of the  United States, was brought before Chief Justice Marshall in the Eagle  Tavern at Richmond on the charge of treason, there began the greatest  criminal trial in American history and one of the notable trials in the  annals of the law.    \"The Burr Conspiracy\" still remains after a hundred years an unsolved  enigma. Yet whether Burr actually planned treason against the United  States in the year of grace 1806 is after all a question of somewhat  restricted importance. The essential truth is that he was by nature an  adventurer who, in the words of Hamilton, \"believed all things possible  to daring and energy,\" and that in 1806 he was a bankrupt and asocial  outcast to boot. Whether, therefore, his grandiose project of an empire  on the ruins of Spanish dominion in Mexico involved also an effort to  separate some part of the West from the Union is a question which, if  it was ever definitely determined in Burr's own mind, was determined,  we may be sure, quite independently of any moral or patriotic  considerations.    Burr's activities after his term of public office ended in March, 1805,  were devious, complicated, and purposely veiled, involving many men and  spread over a large territory. * Near Marietta on an island in the Ohio  River, Burr came upon Harman Blennerhassett, a genial Irishman living in  a luxurious and hospitable mansion which was making a heavy drain upon  his already diminished resources. Here Burr, by his charm of manner and  engaging conversation, soon won from the simple Irishman his heart  and his remaining funds. He also made the island both a convenient  rendezvous for his adherents in his ambitious schemes and a starting  point for his own extended expeditions, which took him during the  latter part of this year to Natchez, Nashville, St. Louis, Vincennes,  Cincinnati, and Philadelphia, and back to Washington.       * An account of the Burr conspiracy will be found in \"Jefferson  and his Colleagues,\" by Allen Johnson (in \"The Chronicles of America\").      In the summer of 1806 Burr turned westward a second time and with the  assistance of Blennerhassett he began military preparations on the  latter's island for a mysterious expedition. On the 29th of July, Burr  had dispatched a letter in cipher to Wilkinson, his most important  confederate. The precise terms of this document we shall never know,  but apparently it contained the most amazing claims of the successful  maturing of Burr's scheme: \"funds had been obtained,\" \"English naval  protection had been secured,\" \"from five hundred to a thousand men\"  would be on the move down the Mississippi by the middle of November.  Unfortunately for Burr, however, Wilkinson was far too expert in the  usages of iniquity to be taken in by such audacious lying as this. He  guessed that the enterprise was on the verge of collapse and forthwith  made up his mind to abandon it.    Meanwhile exaggerated accounts of the size of Burr's following were  filtering to Washington, together with circumstantial rumors of the  disloyalty of his designs. Yet for weeks Jefferson did nothing, until  late in November his alarm was aroused by a letter from Wilkinson, dated  the 21st of October. On the 27th of November the President issued a  proclamation calling upon all good citizens to seize \"sundry persons\"  who were charged with setting on foot a military expedition against  Spain. Already Burr, realizing that the West was not so hot for disunion  as perhaps he had supposed it to be, began to represent his project as  a peaceful emigration to the Washita, a precaution which, however,  came too late to allay the rising excitement of the people. Fearing the  seizure of their equipment, thirty or forty of Burr's followers under  the leadership of Blennerhassett left the island in four or five  flatboats for New Orleans, on the night of the 10th of December, and  a few days later were joined by Burr himself at the mouth of the  Cumberland. When the little expedition paused near Natchez, on the  10th of January, Burr was confronted with a newspaper containing a  transcription of his fatal letter to Wilkinson. A week later, learning  that his former ally, Wilkinson, had now established a reign of terror  at New Orleans directed against his followers; and feeling no desire to  test the tender mercies of a court-martial presided over by his former  associate, Burr surrendered himself into the custody of the acting  Governor of Mississippi Territory. But the refusal of the territorial  grand jury to indict him suggested the hope that he might still escape  from the reach of the law. He therefore plunged into the wilderness,  headed for the Spanish border, and had all but reached his destination  when he was recognized and recaptured at Wakefield, Alabama.    Owing to the peculiar and complicated circumstances which led up to  it, Burr's case was from the outset imbued with factional and partisan  politics of the most extreme kind. While the conspiracy was at its  height, Jefferson, though emphatically warned, had refused to lend it  any credence whatever; but when the danger was well over he had thrown  the whole country into a panic, and had even asked Congress to suspend  the writ of habeas corpus. The Federalists and the President's enemies  within his own party, headed by the redoubtable Randolph, were instantly  alert to the opportunity which Jefferson's inexplicable conduct afforded  them. \"The mountain had labored and brought forth a mouse,\" quoted the  supercilious; the executive dragnet had descended to envelop the monster  which was ready to split the Union or at least to embroil its  relations with a friendly power, and had brought up--a few peaceful  agriculturists! Nor was this the worst of the matter, contended these  critics of the Administration, for the real source of the peril had been  the President's own action in assigning the command at New Orleans to  Wilkinson, a pensioner of Spain, a villain \"from the bark to the very  core.\" Yet so far was the President from admitting this error that he  now attributed the salvation of the country to \"the soldier's honor\" and  \"the citizen's fidelity\" of this same Wilkinson. Surely, then, the  real defendants before the bar of opinion were Thomas Jefferson and his  precious ally James Wilkinson, not their harried and unfortunate victim,  Aaron Burr!    The proceedings against Burr occupied altogether some seven months,  during which the sleepy little town of Richmond became the cynosure of  all eyes. So famous was the case that it brought thither of necessity or  out of curiosity men of every rank and grade of life, of every species  of renown. The prosecution was in charge of the United States District  Attorney, George Hay--serious, humorless, faithful to Jefferson's  interests, and absolutely devoid of the personal authority demanded by  so grave a cause. He was assisted by William Wirt, already a brilliant  lawyer and possessed of a dazzling elocution, but sadly lacking in the  majesty of years. At the head and forefront of the defense stood Burr  himself, an unerring legal tactician, deciding every move of the  great game, the stake of which for him was life itself. About him were  gathered the ablest members of the Richmond bar: John Wickham, witty and  ingenious, Edmund Randolph, ponderous and pontifical, Benjamin Botts,  learned and sarcastic, while from Baltimore came Luther Martin to aid  his \"highly respected friend,\" to keep the political pot boiling,  and eventually to fall desperately in love with Burr's daughter, the  beautiful Theodosia. Among the 140 witnesses there were also some  notable figures: William Eaton, the hero of Derne, whom Burr's  codefendant, Blennerhassett, describes for us as \"strutting about  the streets under a tremendous hat, with a Turkish sash over colored  clothes,\" and offering up, with his frequent libations in the taverns,  \"the copious effusions of his sorrows\"; Commodore Truxton, the gallant  commander of the Constellation; General Andrew Jackson, future  President of the United States, but now a vehement declaimer of Burr's  innocence--out of abundant caution for his own reputation, it may be  surmised; Erick Bollmann, once a participant in the effort to release  Lafayette from Olmutz and himself just now released from durance vile  on a writ of habeas corpus from the Supreme Court; Samuel Swartwout,  another tool of Burr's, reserved by the same beneficent writ for a  career of political roguery which was to culminate in his swindling  the Government out of a million and a quarter dollars; and finally the  bibulous and traitorous Wilkinson, \"whose head\" as he himself owned,  \"might err,\" but \"whose heart could not deceive.\" Traveling by packet  from New Orleans, this essential witness was heralded by the impatient  prosecution, till at last he burst upon the stage with all the eclat  of the hero in a melodrama--only to retire bated and perplexed, his  villainy guessed by his own partisans.    By the Constitution treason against the United States consists \"only in  levying war against them, or in adhering to their enemies, giving them  aid and comfort,\" and no person may be convicted of it \"unless on the  testimony of two witnesses to the same overt act, or on confession in  open court.\" The motion to commit Burr for treason thus raised at  the outset the question whether in this case an \"overt act\" existed.  Marshall, who held that no evidence had been shown to this effect,  denied the motion, but consented to commit the prisoner on the lesser  charge that he had attempted a military expedition against Spain. As  this was a bailable offense, however, Burr was soon at liberty once  more.    Nor was this the only respect in which the preliminary proceedings  sounded a note of antagonism between the Chief Justice and the  Administration which was to recur again and yet again in the months  following.
