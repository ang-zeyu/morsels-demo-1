I have a theory that when bees leave the hive, unless there is some  special attraction in some other direction, they generally go against  the wind. They would thus have the wind with them when they returned  home heavily laden, and with these little navigators the difference  is an important one. With a full cargo, a stiff head-wind is a great  hindrance, but fresh and empty-handed they can face it with more ease.  Virgil says bees bear gravel stones as ballast, but their only ballast  is their honey bag. Hence, when I go bee-hunting, I prefer to get to  windward of the woods in which the swarm is supposed to have taken  refuge.    Bees, like the milkman, like to be near a spring. They do water their  honey, especially in a dry time. The liquid is then of course thicker  and sweeter, and will bear diluting. Hence, old bee-hunters look for  bee-trees along creeks and near spring runs in the woods. I once found a  tree a long distance from any water, and the honey had a peculiar bitter  flavor imparted to it, I was convinced, by rainwater sucked from the  decayed and spongy hemlock tree, in which the swarm was found. In  cutting into the tree, the north side of it was found to be saturated  with water like a spring, which ran out in big drops, and had a bitter  flavor. The bees had thus found a spring or a cistern in their own  house.    Bees are exposed to many hardships and many dangers. Winds and storms  prove as disastrous to them as to other navigators. Black spiders lie in  wait for them as do brigands for travelers. One day as I was looking for  a bee amid some golden-rod, I spied one partly concealed under a leaf.  Its baskets were full of pollen, and it did not move. On lifting up the  leaf I discovered that a hairy spider was ambushed there and had the bee  by the throat. The vampire was evidently afraid of the bee's sting, and  was holding it by the throat till quite sure of its death. Virgil speaks  of the painted lizard, perhaps a species of salamander, as an enemy  of the honey-bee. We have no lizard that destroys the bee; but our  tree-toad, ambushed among the apple and cherry blossoms, snaps them up  wholesale. Quick as lightning that subtle but clammy tongue darts forth,  and the unsuspecting bee is gone. Virgil also accuses the titmouse  and the woodpecker of preying upon the bees, and our kingbird has been  charged with the like crime, but the latter devours only the drones. The  workers are either too small and quick for it, or else it dreads their  sting.    Virgil, by the way, had little more than a child's knowledge of the  honey-bee. There is little fact and much fable in his fourth Georgic. If  he had ever kept bees himself, or even visited an apiary, it is hard to  see how he could have believed that the bee in its flight abroad carried  a gravel stone for ballast:--       \"And as when empty barks on billows float,      With Sandy ballast sailors trim the boat;      So bees bear gravel stones, whose poising weight      Steers through the whistling winds their steady flight;\"    or that when two colonies made war upon each other they issued forth  from their hives led by their kings and fought in the air, strewing the  ground with the dead and dying:--       \"Hard hailstones lie not thicker on the plain,      Nor shaken oaks such show'rs of acorns rain.\"    It is quite certain he had never been bee-hunting. If he had, we should  have had a fifth Georgic. Yet he seems to have known that bees sometimes  escaped to the woods:--       \"Nor bees are lodged in hives alone, but found      In chambers of their own beneath the ground:      Their vaulted roofs are hung in pumices,      And in the rotten trunks of hollow trees.\"    Wild honey is as near like tame as wild bees are like their brothers  in hive. The only difference is that wild honey is flavored with your  adventure, which makes it a little more delectable than the domestic  article.          THE PASTORAL BEES      The honey-bee goes forth from the hive in spring like the dove from  Noah's ark, and it is not till after many days that she brings back the  olive leaf, which in this case is a pellet of golden pollen upon each  hip, usually obtained from the alder or the swamp willow. In a country  where maple sugar is made, the bees get their first taste of sweet from  the sap as it flows from the spiles, or as it dries and is condensed  upon the sides of the buckets. They will sometimes, in their eagerness,  come about the boiling place and be overwhelmed by the steam and the  smoke. But bees appear to be more eager for bread in the spring than for  honey; their supply of this article, perhaps, does not keep as well  as their stores of the latter, hence fresh bread, in the shape of new  pollen, is diligently sought for. My bees get their first supplies from  the catkins of the willows. How quickly they find them out. If but one  catkin opens anywhere within range, a bee is on hand that very hour to  rifle it, and it is a most pleasing experience to stand near the hive  some mild April day and see them come pouring in with their little  baskets packed with this first fruitage of the spring. They will have  new bread now; they have been to mill in good earnest; see their dusty  coats, and the golden grist they bring home with them.    When a bee brings pollen into the hive, he advances to the cell in which  it is to be deposited and kicks it off as one might his overalls or  rubber boots, making one foot help the other; then he walks off without  ever looking behind him; another bee, one of the indoor hands, comes  along and rams it down with his head and packs it into the cell as the  dairymaid packs butter into a firkin.    The first spring wild-flowers, whose shy faces among the dry leaves and  rocks are so welcome, yield no honey. The anemone, the hepatica, the  bloodroot, the arbutus, the numerous violets, the spring beauty, the  corydalis, etc., woo lovers of nature, but do not woo the honey-loving  bee. It requires more sun and warmth to develop the saccharine element,  and the beauty of these pale striplings of the woods and groves is their  sole and sufficient excuse for being. The arbutus, lying low and keeping  green all winter, attains to perfume, but not to honey.    The first honey is perhaps obtained from the flowers of the red maple  and the golden willow. The latter sends forth a wild, delicious perfume.  The sugar maple blooms a little later, and from its silken tassels  a rich nectar is gathered. My bees will not label these different  varieties for me as I really wish they would. Honey from the maples, a  tree so clean and wholesome, and full of such virtues every way, would  be something to put one's tongue to. Or that from the blossoms of the  apple, the peach, the cherry, the quince, the currant,--one would like  a card of each of these varieties to note their peculiar qualities. The  apple-blossom is very important to the bees. A single swarm has been  known to gain twenty pounds in weight during its continuance. Bees love  the ripened fruit, too, and in August and September will suck themselves  tipsy upon varieties such as the sops-of-wine.    The interval between the blooming of the fruit-trees and that of the  clover and the raspberry is bridged over in many localities by the honey  locust. What a delightful summer murmur these trees send forth at this  season. I know nothing about the quality of the honey, but it ought to  keep well. But when the red raspberry blooms, the fountains of plenty  are unsealed indeed; what a commotion about the hives then, especially  in localities where it is extensively cultivated, as in places along the  Hudson. The delicate white clover, which begins to bloom about the  same time, is neglected; even honey itself is passed by for this modest  colorless, all but odorless flower. A field of these berries in June  sends forth a continuous murmur like that of an enormous hive. The honey  is not so white as that obtained from clover but it is easier gathered;  it is in shallow cups while that of the clover is in deep tubes. The  bees are up and at it before sunrise, and it takes a brisk shower to  drive them in. But the clover blooms later and blooms everywhere, and  is the staple source of supply of the finest quality of honey. The  red clover yields up its stores only to the longer proboscis of the  bumble-bee, else the bee pasturage of our agricultural districts would  be unequaled. I do not know from what the famous honey of Chamouni  in the Alps is made, but it can hardly surpass our best products. The  snow-white honey of Anatolia in Asiatic Turkey, which is regularly sent  to Constantinople for the use of the grand seignior and the ladies of  his seraglio, is obtained from the cotton plant, which makes me think  that the white clover does not flourish these. The white clover is  indigenous with us; its seeds seem latent in the ground, and the  application of certain stimulants to the soil, such as wood ashes,  causes them to germinate and spring up.    The rose, with all its beauty and perfume, yields no honey to the bee,  unless the wild species be sought by the bumble-bee.    Among the humbler plants, let me not forget the dandelion that so  early dots the sunny slopes, and upon which the bee languidly grazes,  wallowing to his knees in the golden but not over-succulent pasturage.  From the blooming rye and wheat the bee gathers pollen, also from  the obscure blossoms of Indian corn. Among weeds, catnip is the great  favorite. It lasts nearly the whole season and yields richly. It could  no doubt be profitably cultivated in some localities, and catnip honey  would be a novelty in the market. It would probably partake of the  aromatic properties of the plant from which it was derived.

Those made from  cheese cloth resemble the Turkish rags. Cut and splice the cheese cloth  according to directions on page 83. The face cloth in the illustration  is made from white cheese cloth, cut bias. String the warp 3/16 inch  with white twine. It being desirable to have face and dish cloths as  soft as possible, do not push the woof threads too closely together.  When the cloth is removed from the loom, conceal the ends of the warp  strings as previously directed. Fine white thread should be used. If  preferred, the edges can be bound with tape. Cloths of candle-wicking  are very quickly woven, but they are not so soft.    Face cloths of cheese cloth with borders of knitting cotton would be  durable and satisfactory. Make them according to directions given for  rugs with centers and borders.    Cross-barred face cloths made of knitting cotton No. 4, in two colors,  are very pretty.    [Sidenote: _Bath rug made with continuous warp_]    Serviceable bath rugs can be made by making three strips as long as  desired, and then fastening together. They are made of cheese cloth cut  bias, but the woof threads are packed much tighter than in the face  cloths. Finish the edges by stitching a white tape all around. Floor  rugs of any kind can be made firmer by finishing in this way with tape  of the same color.    [Illustration: _A pattern for a floor rug_]          Chapter Eleven    RAFFIA MATS      [Illustration: _Method of weaving a raffia mat on the loom, showing  colored stripes_]    [Sidenote: _Method of making raffia mats_]    [Sidenote: _The rods and the warp strings in kindergarten patterns_]    Mats of raffia are made like all the other mats. The warp may be of  twine or carpet thread. In this case, the mat should be woven of raffia  in the natural color, with stripes of bright color at each end; or, it  may be of some dark tone with stripes of a contrasting color. By using  a warp of raffia, many of the beautiful kindergarten designs can be  produced. Use one color for the warp and another for the woof. The  method of stringing a warp of raffia is described in \"Methods of  Stringing Warp,\" on page 45. The illustration shows a raffia mat in  process of making. The natural color of raffia is used, with stripes of  cardinal, and the method of stringing color in the warp to obtain this  effect is clearly seen. The children will have no difficulty in carrying  out the pattern, if they remember that the _rods_ correspond to the  _border_ of the paper mat. Before stringing the warp for a kindergarten  pattern, count the strips in the paper mat and begin to count on the  loom _from_ the rods. In this kind of work the string on top of the rod  does not count. It forms the _border_ of the mat.    [Illustration: _A woven mat of raffia, from a kindergarten pattern in  green and the natural color of the raffia_]    [Sidenote: _Stringing the warp_]    In making mats, or matting, of raffia, the material can be carried over  the rods as in wool-weaving, or it can be finished on the edges in the  same way as the real matting is done. This will be easily understood by  examining a piece of matting. In stringing the warp, have three strings  over each bar instead of one. Cut the woof strips several inches longer  than the width of the loom. Weave the first strip, leaving a piece at  each side. Thread a tape needle with one end and weave it in and out the  three warp threads on the rod. Then cut it off close to the edge. Finish  off all the ends in this way. When the work is removed from the loom,  press the edges flat with a warm iron. It is a little easier to keep the  pattern right by weaving in this way, and the work resembles the real  matting more nearly. Use a tape needle for weaving raffia.    [Sidenote: _Porch curtains_]    If the doll house which we are fitting is a large one with porches, one  could complete the furnishings with a porch curtain, for sunny  afternoons.    [Sidenote: _Glove, trinket, and mouchoir boxes_]    Boxes of all kinds can be made of raffia woven in panels. It will make  the box stronger and firmer to overhand a piece of rattan around the  edges of the panels before joining them in the form of a box. Thread a  worsted needle with a narrow strip of raffia and buttonhole the edges of  the panels together; or, sew them over and over and cover with a braid  of raffia. Spiral-weaving is pretty for this finishing. It is described  in an article entitled \"Straw-Weaving,\" in \"American Homes\" for  September, 1900, a magazine published in Knoxville, Tenn. Glove,  trinket, and mouchoir boxes are pretty for holiday gifts. By using  different patterns and colors a great variety of them can be made.    [Sidenote: _Rugs of carpet wool_]    For rugs made of carpet wool, string a three-eighths-inch warp of twine,  or oriental cord, the color of the body of the rug. Use a deep tone of  red, olive green, or any preferred color, with a stripe at each end. A  study of rugs will soon enable one to get the right proportion of rug  and stripe. Beautiful rugs are made with a succession of Roman stripes  separated by a narrow one of deep red, green, or blue, the ends of the  rug being woven of the same color. Center and corner patterns can be  woven by placing the pattern under the warp. By stringing a close warp  of the same material all the designs for paper-weaving can be easily  reproduced. Lengthwise stripes are also pretty. String the warp with  different colors and weave a neutral color through them. The rug in the  frontispiece is woven of heavy carpet wool, some of which is seen on the  table.    [Sidenote: _Patterns for rugs_]    [Sidenote: _Fundamental form No. 1_]    Beautiful patterns for rugs can be made by cutting squares and triangles  of paper according to directions given in the \"Kindergarten Guides.\" The  \"Paradise of Childhood\" has some very pretty ones. There are two  fundamental forms for this paper-cutting. The first is made from a  nine-inch square. Fold one diagonal, place the right acute angle upon  the left so as to produce four triangles resting upon each other. The  form now lies before you with the right angle at the right and two acute  angles (one on top of the other) at the left. Lift one of these acute  angles and place on top of the angle at the back, creasing the fold;  then fold the remaining acute angle _under_ to the same angle at the  back, creasing as before. Now place the form with the right angle at the  back and hold all the open edges to the left while cutting.  Illustrations in the \"Kindergarten Guides\" show a network drawn on the  triangle at the top as an aid to transferring the pattern.    [Illustration: _A rug pattern from an equilateral triangle_]    [Sidenote: _Fundamental form No. 2_]    The second fundamental form is made from a six-fold equilateral  triangle. Directions for folding and cutting this from the square are  given in the \"Paradise of Childhood.\" It can be cut, also, from a circle  whose diameter is equal to the width of the rug desired. In drawing and  cutting the pattern, hold the form with the entirely _open sides_ toward  you. The whole pattern is cut at once and the unfolding often reveals a  charming design for a rug, which can be woven in tones or contrasting  colors. If cut from colored paper, it can be mounted on white and placed  under the warp. Beautiful original designs in conventional leaf and  flower patterns can also be made.    [Sidenote: _Conventional leaf forms_]    To make a conventional leaf form, use fundamental form No. 1. Cut the  leaf on the mid-rib and lay this part on the base of the triangle with  the point of the leaf on the open edges at the left, and the stem on the  closed part at the right. Draw around the edges of the leaf and cut,  taking care not to separate the leaf forms at the center, which is at  the closed part at your right hand.    Some excellent suggestions for this leaf-cutting in centerpieces and  borders can be found in the \"Pratt Institute Monthly\" for April, 1900.    [Sidenote: _Dusters_]    Dusters for hardwood floors are best made of strips of old flannel. They  can be made of stocking strips, or cheese cloth. Make two mats the full  size of the loom, sew on three sides and run a gathering-string around  the top. It will fit better if it has a piece of cheese cloth sewn at  the top through which the gathering-string can be run. This makes a fine  duster to slip over a broom. If one prefers, a continuous warp can be  strung--the length to be twice the length of the broom part--and a long  piece woven which will require sewing on two sides only.    [Illustration: _A doll towel with fringed ends_]    [Sidenote: _Doll towels_]    [Sidenote: _Patterns for towel borders_]    [Sidenote: _Lunch cloths_]    [Sidenote: _Bedspreads_]    [Sidenote: _Quilts_]    Doll towels are very fascinating things to make. Adjust the loom for the  required size. The exact proportion can be ascertained from a large  towel. String the close warp with fine darning cotton and have the  strings in pairs with fringe at each end. Allow several inches for  fringe so that it can be knotted easily. The woof threads, which are  also of fine darning cotton, should be pushed very closely and smoothly  together. Plain stripes of red or blue, or fancy stripes made with a  kindergarten design, can be woven. Observe the same directions for  spacing the stripes which are given with the silkoline rug. The towel  in the illustration is made of white darning cotton, with the stripes  and initial of red. The children will be delighted to lay towel borders  with their tablets, and after cutting and pasting with colored paper,  weave them in towels for Miss Dolly's housekeeping. Cross-stitch the  initial as previously directed. Lunch cloths and"]]]
