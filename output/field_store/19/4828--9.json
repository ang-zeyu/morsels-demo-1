It is not in me to make remarks if a  counsellor's lady changes the color of her eyes, and her complexion  every assizes. But, Sir John, a gentleman ought not to bring a lady to a  lone widow's lodgings, unless so long as he 'okkipies' the apartments he  makes all honorable professions that the lady is his wife, and as such  gives her the use of his name.\"          CHAPTER VIII.    REJECTED ADDRESSES.      No lawyer of the Second Charles's time surpassed Francis North in love  of money, or was more firmly resolved not to marry, without due and  substantial consideration.    His first proposal was for the daughter of a Gray's Inn money-lender.  Usury was not a less contemptible vocation in the seventeenth century  than it is at the present time; and most young barristers of gentle  descent and fair prospects would have preferred any lot to the  degradation of marriage with the child of the most fortunate usurer in  Charles II.'s London. But the Hon. Francis North was placed comfortably  _beneath_ the prejudices of his order and time of life. He was of noble  birth, but quite ready to marry into a plebeian family; he was young,  but loved money more than aught else. So his hearing was quickened and  his blood beat merrily when, one fine morning, \"there came to him a  recommendation of a lady, who was an only daughter of an old usurer in  Gray's Inn, supposed to be a good fortune in present, for her father was  rich; but, after his death, to become worth, nobody could tell what.\"  One would like to know how that 'recommendation of a lady' reached the  lawyer's chambers; above all, who sent it?    \"His lordship,\" continues Roger North, \"got a sight of the lady, and did  not dislike her; thereupon he made the old man a visit, and a proposal  of himself to marry his daughter.\" By all means let this ingenuous,  high-spirited Templar have a fair judgment. He would not have sold  himself to just any woman. He required a _maximum_ of wealth with a  _minimum_ of personal repulsiveness. He therefore 'took a sight of the  lady' (it does not appear that he talked with her) before he committed  himself irrevocably by a proposal. The _sight_ having been taken, as he  did not dislike her (mind, he did not positively like her) he made the  old man a visit. Loving money, and believing in it, this 'old man'  wished to secure as much of it as possible for his only child; and  therefore looking keenly at the youthful admirer of a usurer's heiress,  \"asked him what estate his father intended to settle upon him for  present maintenance, jointure, and provision for children.\" Mildly and  not unjustly Roger calls this \"an inauspicious question.\" It was so  inauspicious that Mr. Francis North abruptly terminated the discussion  by wishing the usurer good-morning. So ended Love Affair No. 1.    Having lost his dear companion, Mr. Edward Palmer, son of the powerful  Sir Geoffry Palmer, Mr. Francis North soon regarded his friend's wife  with tender longing. It was only natural that he should desire to  mitigate his sorrow for the dead by possession of the woman who was  \"left a flourishing widow, and very rich.\" But the lady knew her worth,  as well she might, for \"never was lady more closely besieged with  wooers: she had no less than five younger sons sat down before her at  one time, and she kept them well in hand, as they say, giving no  definite answers to any of one of them.\" Small respect did Mistress  Edward Palmer show her late husband's most intimate friend. For weeks  she tortured the wretched, knavish fellow with coquettish tricks, and  having rendered him miserable in many ways, made him ludicrous by  jilting him. \"He was held at the long saw above a month, doing his duty  as well as he might, and that was but clumsily; for he neither dressed  nor danced, when his rivals were adroit at both, and the lady used to  shuffle her favors amongst them affectedly, and on purpose to mortify  his lordship, and at the same time be as civil to him, with like purpose  to mortify them.\" Poor Mr. Francis! Well may his brother write  indignantly, \"It was very grievous to him--that had his thoughts upon  his clients' concerns, which came in thick upon him--to be held in a  course of bo-peep play with a crafty widow.\" At length, \"after a  clancular proceeding,\" this crafty widow, by marrying \"a jolly knight of  a good estate,\" set her victims free; and Mr. Francis was at liberty to  look elsewhere for a lapful of money.    Roger North tells the story of the third affair so concisely and pithily  that his exact words must be put before the reader:--\"Another  proposition came to his lordship,\" writes the fraternal biographer,  giving Francis North credit for the title he subsequently won, although  at the time under consideration he was plain _Mister_ North, on the keen  look-out for the place of Solicitor General, \"by a city broker, from Sir  John Lawrence, who had many daughters, and those reputed beauties; and  the fortune was to be L6000. His lordship went and dined with the  alderman, and liked the lady, who (as the way is) was dressed out for a  muster. And coming to treat, the portion shrank to L5000, and upon that  his lordship parted, and was not gone far before Mr. Broker (following)  came to him, and said Sir John would give L500 more at the birth of the  first child; but that would not do, for his lordship hated such  screwing. Not long after this dispute, his lordship was made the King's  Solicitor General, and then the broker came again, with news that Sir  John would give L10,000. 'No,' his lordship said, 'after such usage he  would not proceed if he might have L20,000.'\" The intervention of the  broker in this negotiation is delightfully suggestive. More should have  been said about him--his name, address, and terms for doing business.  Was he paid for his services on all that he could save from a certain  sum beyond which his employer would not advance a single gold-piece for  the disposal of his child? Were there, in olden time, men who avowed  themselves 'Heart and Jointure Brokers, Agents for Lovers of both Sexes,  Contractors of Mutual Attachments, Wholesale and Retail Dealers in  Reciprocal Affection, and General Referees, Respondents, and Insurers in  all Sentimental Affairs, Clandestine or otherwise?'    After these mischances Francis North made an eligible match under  somewhat singular circumstances. As co-heiresses of Thomas, Earl of  Down, three sisters, the Ladies Pope, claimed under certain settlements  large estates of inheritance, to which Lady Elizabeth Lee set up a  counter claim. North, acting as Lady Elizabeth Lee's counsel, effected a  compromise which secured half the property in dispute to his client, and  diminished by one-half the fortunes to which each of the three suitors  on the other side had maintained their right. Having thus reduced the  estate of Lady Frances Pope to a fortune estimated at about L14,000, the  lawyer proposed for her hand, and was accepted. After his marriage,  alluding to his exertions in behalf of Lady Elizabeth Lee's very  disputable claim, he used to say that \"he had been counsel against  himself;\" but Roger North frankly admits that \"if this question had not  come to such a composition, which diminished the ladies' fortunes, his  brother had never compassed his match.\"    It was not without reluctance that the Countess of Downs consented to  the union of her daughter with the lawyer who had half ruined her, and  who (though he was Solicitor General and in fine practice) could settle  only L5000 upon the lady. \"I well remember,\" observes Roger, \"the good  countess had some qualms, and complained that she knew not how she could  justify what she had done (meaning the marrying her daughters with no  better settlement).\" To these qualms Francis North, with lawyer-like  coolness, answered--\"Madam, if you meet with any question about that,  _say_ that your daughter has L1000 per annum jointure.\"    The marriage was celebrated in Wroxton Church; and after bountiful  rejoicings with certain loyalist families of Oxfordshire, the happy  couple went up to London and lived in chambers until they moved into a  house in Chancery Lane.    It may surprise some readers of this book to learn that George Jeffreys,  the odious judge of the Bloody Circuit, was a successful gallant. Tall,  well-shaped, and endowed by nature with a pleasant countenance and  agreeable features, Jeffreys was one of the most fascinating men of his  time. A wit and a _bon-vivant_, he could hit the humor of the roystering  cavaliers who surrounded the 'merry monarch;' a man of gallantry and  polite accomplishments, he was acceptable to women of society. The same  tongue that bullied from the bench, when witnesses were perverse or  counsel unruly, could flatter with such melodious affectation of  sincerity, that he was known as a most delightful companion. As a  musical connoisseur he spoke with authority; as a teller of good stories  he had no equal in town. Even those who detested him did not venture to  deny that in the discharge of his judicial offices he could at his  pleasure assume a dignity and urbane composure that well became the seat  of justice. In short, his talents and graces were so various and  effective, that he would have risen to the bench, even if he had labored  under the disadvantages of pure morality and amiable temper.    Women declared him irresistible. At court he had the ear of Nell Gwyn  and the Duchess of Portsmouth--the Protestant favorite and the Catholic  mistress; and before he attained the privilege of entering Whitehall--at  a time when his creditors were urgent, and his best clients were the  inferior attorneys of the city courts--he was loved by virtuous girls.  He was still poor, unknown, and struggling with difficulties, when he  induced an heiress to accept his suit,--the daughter of a rural squire  whose wine the barrister had drunk upon circuit."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2781"],[0,"Just So Stories (#12)"],[1,"'He was round and he was flat; and  his eyes grew upon stalks; and he walked sideways like this; and he was  covered with strong armour upon his back.'    And the Eldest Magician said, 'How wise are little children who speak  truth! Now I know where Pau Amma went. Give me the paddle!'    So he took the paddle; but there was no need to paddle, for the water  flowed steadily past all the islands till they came to the place called  Pusat Tasek--the Heart of the Sea--where the great hollow is that leads  down to the heart of the world, and in that hollow grows the Wonderful  Tree, Pauh Janggi, that bears the magic twin nuts. Then the Eldest  Magician slid his arm up to the shoulder through the deep warm water,  and under the roots of the Wonderful Tree he touched the broad back of  Pau Amma the Crab. And Pau Amma settled down at the touch, and all the  Sea rose up as water rises in a basin when you put your hand into it.    'Ah!' said the Eldest Magician. 'Now I know who has been playing with  the Sea;' and he called out, 'What are you doing, Pau Amma?'    And Pau Amma, deep down below, answered, 'Once a day and once a night I  go out to look for my food. Once a day and once a night I return. Leave  me alone.'    Then the Eldest Magician said, 'Listen, Pau Amma. When you go out from  your cave the waters of the Sea pour down into Pusat Tasek, and all the  beaches of all the islands are left bare, and the little fish die, and  Raja Moyang Kaban, the King of the Elephants, his legs are made muddy.  When you come back and sit in Pusat Tasek, the waters of the Sea rise,  and half the little islands are drowned, and the Man's house is flooded,  and Raja Abdullah, the King of the Crocodiles, his mouth is filled with  the salt water.    Then Pau Amma, deep down below, laughed and said, 'I did not know I  was so important. Henceforward I will go out seven times a day, and the  waters shall never be still.'    And the Eldest Magician said, 'I cannot make you play the play you were  meant to play, Pau Amma, because you escaped me at the Very Beginning;  but if you are not afraid, come up and we will talk about it.'    'I am not afraid,' said Pau Amma, and he rose to the top of the sea in  the moonlight. There was nobody in the world so big as Pau Amma--for he  was the King Crab of all Crabs. Not a common Crab, but a King Crab. One  side of his great shell touched the beach at Sarawak; the other  touched the beach at Pahang; and he was taller than the smoke of three  volcanoes! As he rose up through the branches of the Wonderful Tree he  tore off one of the great twin fruits--the magic double kernelled nuts  that make people young,--and the little girl-daughter saw it bobbing  alongside the canoe, and pulled it in and began to pick out the soft  eyes of it with her little golden scissors.    'Now,' said the Magician, 'make a Magic, Pau Amma, to show that you are  really important.'    Pau Amma rolled his eyes and waved his legs, but he could only stir up  the Sea, because, though he was a King Crab, he was nothing more than a  Crab, and the Eldest Magician laughed.    'You are not so important after all, Pau Amma,' he said. 'Now, let  me try,' and he made a Magic with his left hand--with just the little  finger of his left hand--and--lo and behold, Best Beloved, Pau Amma's  hard, blue-green-black shell fell off him as a husk falls off a  cocoa-nut, and Pau Amma was left all soft--soft as the little crabs that  you sometimes find on the beach, Best Beloved.    'Indeed, you are very important,' said the Eldest Magician. 'Shall I ask  the Man here to cut you with kris? Shall I send for Raja Moyang Kaban,  the King of the Elephants, to pierce you with his tusks, or shall I call  Raja Abdullah, the King of the Crocodiles, to bite you?'    And Pau Amma said, 'I am ashamed! Give me back my hard shell and let me  go back to Pusat Tasek, and I will only stir out once a day and once a  night to get my food.'    And the Eldest Magician said, 'No, Pau Amma, I will not give you back  your shell, for you will grow bigger and prouder and stronger, and  perhaps you will forget your promise, and you will play with the Sea  once more.    Then Pau Amma said, 'What shall I do? I am so big that I can only hide  in Pusat Tasek, and if I go anywhere else, all soft as I am now, the  sharks and the dogfish will eat me. And if I go to Pusat Tasek, all soft  as I am now, though I may be safe, I can never stir out to get my food,  and so I shall die.' Then he waved his legs and lamented.    'Listen, Pau Amma,' said the Eldest Magician. 'I cannot make you play  the play you were meant to play, because you escaped me at the Very  Beginning; but if you choose, I can make every stone and every hole and  every bunch of weed in all the seas a safe Pusat Tasek for you and your  children for always.'    Then Pau Amma said, 'That is good, but I do not choose yet. Look! there  is that Man who talked to you at the Very Beginning. If he had not taken  up your attention I should not have grown tired of waiting and run away,  and all this would never have happened. What will he do for me?'    And the Man said, 'If you choose, I will make a Magic, so that both  the deep water and the dry ground will be a home for you and your  children--so that you shall be able to hide both on the land and in the  sea.'    And Pau Amma said, 'I do not choose yet. Look! there is that girl who  saw me running away at the Very Beginning. If she had spoken then, the  Eldest Magician would have called me back, and all this would never have  happened. What will she do for me?'    And the little girl-daughter said, 'This is a good nut that I am eating.  If you choose, I will make a Magic and I will give you this pair of  scissors, very sharp and strong, so that you and your children can eat  cocoa-nuts like this all day long when you come up from the Sea to the  land; or you can dig a Pusat Tasek for yourself with the scissors that  belong to you when there is no stone or hole near by; and when the earth  is too hard, by the help of these same scissors you can run up a tree.'    And Pau Amma said, 'I do not choose yet, for, all soft as I am, these  gifts would not help me. Give me back my shell, O Eldest Magician, and  then I will play your play.'    And the Eldest Magician said, 'I will give it back, Pau Amma, for eleven  months of the year; but on the twelfth month of every year it shall grow  soft again, to remind you and all your children that I can make magics,  and to keep you humble, Pau Amma; for I see that if you can run both  under the water and on land, you will grow too bold; and if you can  climb trees and crack nuts and dig holes with your scissors, you will  grow too greedy, Pau Amma.'    Then Pau Amma thought a little and said, 'I have made my choice. I will  take all the gifts.'    Then the Eldest Magician made a Magic with the right hand, with all five  fingers of his right hand, and lo and behold, Best Beloved, Pau Amma  grew smaller and smaller and smaller, till at last there was only a  little green crab swimming in the water alongside the canoe, crying in a  very small voice, 'Give me the scissors!'    And the girl-daughter picked him up on the palm of her little brown  hand, and sat him in the bottom of the canoe and gave him her scissors,  and he waved them in his little arms, and opened them and shut them and  snapped them, and said, 'I can eat nuts. I can crack shells. I can dig  holes. I can climb trees. I can breathe in the dry air, and I can find  a safe Pusat Tasek under every stone. I did not know I was so important.  Kun?' (Is this right?)    'Payah-kun,' said the Eldest Magician, and he laughed and gave him his  blessing; and little Pau Amma scuttled over the side of the canoe into  the water; and he was so tiny that he could have hidden under the shadow  of a dry leaf on land or of a dead shell at the bottom of the sea.    'Was that well done?' said the Eldest Magician.    'Yes,' said the Man. 'But now we must go back to Perak, and that is  a weary way to paddle. If we had waited till Pau Amma had gone out of  Pusat Tasek and come home, the water would have carried us there by  itself.'    'You are lazy,' said the Eldest Magician. 'So your children shall be  lazy. They shall be the laziest people in the world. They shall be  called the Malazy--the lazy people;' and he held up his finger to the  Moon and said, 'O Fisherman, here is the Man too lazy to row home. Pull  his canoe home with your line, Fisherman.'    'No,' said the Man. 'If I am to be lazy all my days, let the Sea work  for me twice a day for ever. That will save paddling.'    And the Eldest Magician laughed and said, 'Payah kun' (That is right).    And the Rat of the Moon stopped biting the line; and the Fisherman let  his line down till it touched the Sea, and he pulled the whole deep Sea  along, past the Island of Bintang, past Singapore, past Malacca, past  Selangor, till the canoe whirled into the mouth of the Perak River  again. Kun?' said the Fisherman of the Moon.    'Payah kun,' said the Eldest Magician. 'See now that you pull the Sea  twice a day and twice a night for ever, so that the Malazy fishermen may  be saved paddling. But be careful not to do it too hard, or I shall make  a magic on you as I did to Pau Amma.'    Then they all went up the Perak River and went to bed, Best Beloved.    Now listen and attend!    From that day to this the Moon has always pulled the sea up and down  and made what we call the tides. Sometimes the Fisher of the Sea pulls a  little too hard, and then we get spring tides; and sometimes he pulls  a little too softly, and then we get what are called neap-tides; but  nearly always he is careful, because of the Eldest Magician.    And Pau Amma? You can see when you go to the beach, how all Pau Amma's  babies make little Pusat Taseks for themselves under every stone  and bunch of weed on the sands; you can see them waving their little  scissors; and in some "]]]
