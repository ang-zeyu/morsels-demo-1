In the plants of this genus the hymenophore  or fleshy substance of the cap is continuous with the stem. They are  fleshy, membranaceous, and putrescent, having neither veil, ring, nor  volva. The stem is central, except in a few species, where it is  lateral. A characteristic of the genus which separates it from other  genera of the Agaricini is the vein-like appearance of the gills. They  are very shallow and so obtuse on the edges as to present the appearance  of a network of swollen branching veins. They are usually decurrent and  anastomosing. It is a small genus. Cooke figures nineteen species. Among  the described species C. cibarius is the only one whose edible qualities  have been highly recommended. C. umbonatus, a very small plant, found in  eastern Massachusetts is commended by those who have eaten it. They are  usually found in woods, and amongst moss. One species, _C. carbonatus_,  is found upon charred ground.         [Illustration: Plate VII.

Cap a rich golden yellow, like the yolk of an egg; at first convex,  later concave and turbinated; margin sinuous, undulate, smooth,  shining, and more or less lobed; diameter from two to four inches;  flesh pale yellow or whitish; veins or gills rather thick and wiry,  remarkably decurrent, usually very much bifurcated and of the same  golden yellow as the cap; stem solid or stuffed, slightly attenuated  downwards, yellow; spores white or pale yellowish, elliptical.    European authors esteem it very highly, and some speak of the odor as  like that of ripe apricots. The plant as found in Maryland and Virginia  has a slightly pungent but agreeable taste when raw, and a pleasant odor  when cooked. It is ranked as one of the best of the wood mushrooms by  those who have eaten it in this locality (District of Columbia). It is  found here in abundance, after light rains, in fir woods. Berkeley  states that it is somewhat rare in England, where it is held as a  delicacy, but quite common on the continent. We have had specimens from  various localities throughout the States. Cooke says the spores are  white. Peck and Gibson record them as yellow. I find them white,  sometimes slightly tinted with yellow.    The _Chantarelle_ takes its name from a Greek word signifying a cup or  vase, referring to its shape and possibly also to its rich golden color;  _cibarius_ refers to its esculent qualities.    The variety _rufipes_ Gillet closely resembles C. _cibarius_, but is  darker, with the stem _rufous_, reddish, at the base.    C. _aurantiacus_ Fries bears a sufficient resemblance to C. _cibarius_  to be sometimes taken for it, although the cap is tomentose and of a  much deeper orange in tint, the gills more crowded, darker than the cap,  and the stem less stout. In the variety _pallidus_ the whole plant is  very light or buff yellow, and the gills nearly white. C. aurantiacus  has been recorded as poisonous or unwholesome by some of the earlier  authors, others say that they have eaten it, but do not commend it.          RECEIPTS FOR COOKING.      _Stuffed Morels._--Choose the freshest and lightest colored Morels, open  the stalk at the base, fill with minced veal and bread-crumbs, secure  the ends of the stalk and place between thin slices of bacon.    The Morel should not be gathered immediately after heavy rains, as it  becomes insipid with much moisture. The flavor is said to grow stronger  in drying.    _Escalloped Mushrooms._--(From Mr. Frank Caywood, Fredericktown, Ohio,  November 14, 1893.) Season as directed in the usual methods for  mushrooms and add a small quantity of vinegar to hasten the cooking.  Cook slowly until tender; rapid boiling evaporates the flavor. When  done, put in from a pint to a quart of sweet milk and heat. Take a  pudding dish and put in a layer of broken crackers; light milk crackers  are the best. Put lumps of butter and pepper and salt over the crackers.  Next a layer of the tender mushrooms with some of the hot gravy and  milk. Continue these layers until the dish is full, having a layer of  crackers on top. Place the dish in the oven and bake slowly until the  crackers are browned.    _Mushroom Fritters._--Take nice large tops, season, and dip into batter  and fry in hot butter as other fritters.    _Mushrooms en ragout._--Put into a stewpan a little \"stock,\" a small  quantity of vinegar, parsley, and green onions chopped up, salt and  spices. When this is about to boil, the cleaned mushrooms are put in.  When done remove them from the fire and thicken with yolks of eggs.    The Lactarius _deliciosus_ may be served with a white sauce or fried.  Badham says the best way to cook them is to season first with pepper,  salt, and small pieces of butter, and bake in a closely covered pie dish  for about three quarters of an hour.    The Cantharellus, being somewhat dry, requires more fluid sauce in  cooking than the juicier mushrooms, and is best minced and slowly stewed  until quite tender. Some advise soaking it in milk a few hours before  cooking. The Italians dry or pickle it or keep it in oil for winter use.    Persoon gives the following recipes for cooking the Morel: 1st. Wash and  cleanse thoroughly, as the earth is apt to collect between the ridges;  dry and put them in a saucepan with pepper, salt, and parsley, adding or  not a piece of bacon; stew for an hour, pouring in occasionally a little  broth to prevent burning; when sufficiently done, bind with the yolks of  two or three eggs, and serve on buttered toast.    2. _Morelles a l'Italienne._--Having washed and dried, divide them  across, put them on the fire with some parsley, scallion, chives,  tarragon, a little salt, and two spoonfuls of fine oil. Stew till the  juice runs out, then thicken with a little flour; serve with bread  crumbs and a squeeze of lemon.          MUSHROOM GROWING.[A]      [A] A part of the matter presented under this caption was contributed by  the author to the Health Magazine and appeared in the March number  (1897) of that periodical.    To France is due the credit of being the first country to cultivate  mushrooms on a large scale, and France still supplies the markets of the  world with canned mushrooms. The mushroom which is cultivated in the  caves and quarries of France, to the exclusion of all others, is the  Agaricus arvensis (the \"Snowball\"), a species of field mushroom.    Of late years France has found a formidable competitor in the culture of  mushrooms in Great Britain. The English market gardeners find their  moist, equable climate favorable to outdoor culture, and abundant crops  are grown by them in the open air, chiefly, however, for the home  market.    That mushroom growing can be made a lucrative business is shown by the  experience of a well-known English grower, Mr. J. F. Barter, who on one  acre of ground has produced in the open air, without the aid of glass,  an average of from ten to twelve thousand pounds of mushrooms annually;  the price obtained for them varying according to the season, but  averaging ten pence, or twenty cents, per pound for the whole year. The  value of twelve thousand pounds of mushrooms at ten pence per pound  would be L.500 sterling or $2,500.    For the purposes of comparison the following are quoted from the Pall  Mall Gazette, as exceptional prices realized in England for other fruits  and vegetables in recent years:    Pounds sterling per statute acre:    Very early gooseberries, 100; onions, 192; early lettuces, 100; plums,  100; potatoes, 100; strawberries, 150; black currants, 168; filberts,  200.    It will be seen that onions and filberts head the list, but the product  of an acre of mushrooms has been shown to be worth more than double that  of either filberts or onions.    In the localities specially favorable to hop growing 30 cwt. of hops to  the acre is considered exceptional, while the average price has been  quoted at 3 pounds sterling, or about one-fifth of the sum obtained from  Mr. Barter's acre of mushrooms. Three months in the year the weather  does not favor outdoor culture, and these months Mr. Barter spends in  manufacturing brick spawn, which he exports to this and other countries.  Among those who have been very successful in indoor culture are Mr.  William Robinson, editor of the \"London Garden,\" and Mr. Horace Cox,  manager of the \"Field.\"    In America, where mushroom culture is still comparatively in its  infancy, there have already been obtained very encouraging results by  painstaking growers. Most of the cultivation has been in the northern  and midwestern States, where the climatic conditions seemed most  favorable to indoor culture. A few figures as to the revenue obtained in  this way may be interesting to readers.    An experienced Pennsylvania grower states that from a total area of  5,500 square feet of beds, made up in two mushroom houses, he obtained a  crop of 5,000 pounds of mushrooms in one season, or about one pound to  the square foot. These sold at an average of a little over 50 cents per  pound. A third house, with 19,000 square feet of beds, produced 2,800  pounds, or one and one-half pounds to the square foot. This house  yielded a net profit of one thousand dollars. This, however, can be  quoted only as showing the possibilities of careful culture by  experienced growers under very favorable circumstances. Amateurs could  scarcely expect such good results. Three-fourths of a pound to the  square foot would probably come nearer the average. A Philadelphia  grower gives the average price secured from fifty shipments of mushrooms  in one season at 54 cents per pound. New York dealers report higher  rates than this."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33029"],[0,"Ducks and Geese (#12)"],[1,"formerly and it is rather hard to get. When  it is available it can be used either in winter or summer.    Good field clover cut up and boiled with the potatoes or with the fish  makes a good green feed. All of these green materials for use in the  ration, unless they are already in short lengths, are cut up by means of  a power feed cutter before they are mixed in the mash. When no other  form of green feed is available ground alfalfa is used but only half as  much of this material is mixed with the ration as is used of any of the  other kinds of green feed. Wherever possible the various duck yards  should be used to grow a crop of green stuff such as oats or rye as this  not only helps out on the supply of green feed but also helps to sweeten  the soil. The growing of a crop on the heavier types of soil used for  ducks is especially important as such soils are more likely to become  contaminated from the droppings.    The ration for the ducks is mixed up in a power feed mixer which works  much on the principle of a power dough mixer. In fact, dough mixers are  used on some plants. In mixing the feed enough water should be added to  bring the material to a consistency where it will hold together when  squeezed in the hand. In fact, the consistency should be between crumbly  and sticky, but should never be sloppy. The feed is dumped from the  mixer into a low horse drawn wagon and driven around to the various  yards where it is shoveled off on to the feed troughs or trays. On some  large duck plants a track is provided which runs over the yards and over  this a car loaded with feed is pushed and the feed shoveled into the  feed trays.    The breeders should be fed in the same place. If feeding is begun in the  house this practice should be continued. If feeding is begun in the  yards it should be continued there. To change disturbs the ducks and  interferes with their egg production.    Coarse ground oyster shell about as large as corn should be kept before  the breeders all the time in boxes where they can help themselves. A  flock of 700 or 800 breeders will eat upwards of 200 pounds a week of  this material. Unless sand is available in the yards where they can get  it, ducks should also have access to a supply of good sharp creek sand  but when kept in sand yards no other form of grit need be furnished.    The usual method of feeding is to utilize flat troughs on which the feed  is shoveled. Only as much feed should be given at the regular feeding  time as the ducks will eat up clean. This makes it necessary to watch  the feeding carefully and to regulate the amount accordingly. It is good  practice to gather up any feed that is left by the ducks so that it will  not lie there to sour and spoil as such feed is bad for the birds.      Egg Production    The average egg production of Pekin ducks kept under commercial farm  conditions will run from 80 to 125 eggs per head for the season. This  will vary somewhat from year to year and also with the management and  feed given the ducks. The laying begins to a small extent about December  1 and gradually increases until the ducks are laying freely in February.  As the hot weather of summer begins to come on the laying drops off  until about July 1 and after this not enough eggs are produced as a rule  to pay to hold the breeding ducks longer. Often many ducks will stop  laying considerably before this, especially those which have started  laying early and it may not pay to keep such pens later than May. Laying  takes place early in the morning and practically all the eggs are laid  soon after daylight. It is for this reason that the ducks are usually  shut up at night so that all the eggs laid will be secured as some of  them would otherwise be lost by their being laid around in the yard or  in the water. In the spring the ducks can be let out about 6 a. m., as  the laying will be pretty well over by that time, but in winter they  must be kept shut up later in order to secure all the eggs. After the  ducks start laying in the spring they are very regular and continuous  layers and will miss fewer days than most hens.    After the breeding ducks are first put in the breeding pens and shut in  the houses at night it is common practice to use electric lights for the  first 2 or 3 weeks in order to keep them from stampeding as ducks in  strange surroundings are quite nervous and are quite likely to stampede  and to run over one another thus causing cripples. Electric lights have  also been used to some extent during the late fall and winter for the  purpose of inducing egg production earlier than the natural season. As a  rule the ducks can be started to laying about 4 weeks after turning on  the lights but the average production under this system is not likely to  run more than 60 eggs for the season as so handled they moult quite  early in the spring. A single 25 watt light is sufficient for a house or  pen 16 x 24 feet and the lights are left turned on all night.    The object in feeding and caring for the breeding ducks is to keep them  from moulting and to keep them laying as long as possible. It must be  remembered that any radical change in feed or manner of feeding,  shutting them up too closely, change of temperature, or other disturbing  conditions are likely to cause moulting and to check egg production. Any  change in feed must be made carefully and gradually, not suddenly. It  must also be remembered that ducks are excitable birds and must be  handled and driven carefully so as to disturb them as little as  possible.      Time of Marketing Breeders    The breeders should be turned off to market whenever their egg  production drops off so decidedly that it no longer pays to hold them.  In most cases this will be about the 1st of July but it may range  considerably earlier than this, especially with pens of ducks that have  started laying early. When the ducks finish laying their eggs they begin  to moult and it is at this time that they should be marketed. If  marketing is delayed, the ducks will lose condition as the moulting  progresses and will therefore be held at a loss.      Diseases and Pests    _Disease._ Old ducks, that is, mature ducks, are practically free from  disease. Of course, there will be a certain amount of loss in the  breeding stock from various causes but this should not run for the  entire season more than 10% of the flock. Ducks do not become egg bound,  but sometimes, especially during heavy laying, they become ruptured.    _Insect Pests._ Ducks are remarkably free from lice and other insect  pests and those which they do have do not trouble them much. It is  unnecessary therefore to take any precautions in the way of treating the  ducks to keep them free of insects.    _Dogs._ Occasionally trouble may be experienced from dogs. If these  animals get into the yards with the breeders or the fattening ducks,  they may kill a good many and in addition will seriously injure the rest  by chasing them and by the fright which the ducks are given.          CHAPTER V    Commercial Duck Farming--Incubation      The Pekin duck is essentially a non-broody breed. It, therefore, becomes  necessary to resort to incubators for the purpose of hatching the eggs.  Occasional ducks will sit if allowed to do so but it is not the practice  on commercial duck farms to allow them to sit and hatch their young. No  special means are taken to break them of broodiness other than not to  allow them eggs to sit on.    _Kinds of Incubators Used._ Both the smaller kerosene lamp heated  incubators and the large or mammoth hot water heated incubators are used  for hatching duck eggs. At the present time the mammoth hot water  machines are those which are in principal use due largely to the  lessened labor required to operate them.    _Incubator Cellar._ It is necessary to provide some room in which the  incubators can be installed and operated. This may take the form of a  cellar, or the incubators may be operated in rooms above the ground.  Many of the incubator cellars on duck farms are only partially under  ground and not a few of them are built entirely out of ground. The  particular size and shape of the cellar or incubator room will, of  course, depend upon the number of incubators to be installed and upon  their make and shape. Usually these buildings are constructed with  rather thick walls so that the temperature of the room will fluctuate  less with changes in outside temperature. Provision is also necessary by  means of windows or other ventilating devices to provide for good  ventilation in the room. The cellars are usually constructed with cement  floors as moisture is used freely and wooden floors would rot out  quickly.    _Incubator Capacity Required._ The aim on commercial duck farms is to  hatch all of the eggs produced which are suitable for the purpose.  Practically no eggs are sold except the cracked eggs or those which  would not give good results in the incubator such as too large or too  small eggs. Occasionally, of course, there will be sales of duck eggs in  comparatively large lots for incubation purposes where someone is  starting a duck farm. Occasionally also duck farmers buy from each other  a few eggs for incubation in order to secure new blood. On the whole,  however, practically all of the eggs laid are incubated and it is  necessary to have an incubator capacity sufficient to take care of the  eggs as they are produced during the flush season.    Since the egg production at this time will run around about 80% and  since the period of incubation is 28 days and a couple more days must be  allowed to take the ducklings out of the machines and to clean up the  machines, it is necessary to figure on 30 days between hatches. To take  care of the flush production at this time there would be required an  incubator capacity of from 20 to 25 eggs per head of breeding ducks. The  latter figure is a safer estimate than the former. Of"]]]
