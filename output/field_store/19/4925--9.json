When the Axis of this Prism was parallel to the Horizon, and the  Refraction of the Rays at their Incidence on this Prism equal to that at  their Emergence out of it, I observed with a Quadrant the Angle which  the mean refrangible Rays, (that is those which went to the middle of  the Sun's coloured Image) made with the Horizon, and by this Angle and  the Sun's altitude observed at the same time, I found the Angle which  the emergent Rays contained with the incident to be 44 deg. and 40 min.  and the half of this Angle added to the Angle of Incidence 31 deg. 15  min. makes the Angle of Refraction, which is therefore 53 deg. 35 min.  and its Sine 8047. These are the Sines of Incidence and Refraction of  the mean refrangible Rays, and their Proportion in round Numbers is 20  to 31. This Glass was of a Colour inclining to green. The last of the  Prisms mentioned in the third Experiment was of clear white Glass. Its  refracting Angle 63-1/2 Degrees. The Angle which the emergent Rays  contained, with the incident 45 deg. 50 min. The Sine of half the first  Angle 5262. The Sine of half the Sum of the Angles 8157. And their  Proportion in round Numbers 20 to 31, as before.    From the Length of the Image, which was about 9-3/4 or 10 Inches,  subduct its Breadth, which was 2-1/8 Inches, and the Remainder 7-3/4  Inches would be the Length of the Image were the Sun but a Point, and  therefore subtends the Angle which the most and least refrangible Rays,  when incident on the Prism in the same Lines, do contain with one  another after their Emergence. Whence this Angle is 2 deg. 0'. 7''. For  the distance between the Image and the Prism where this Angle is made,  was 18-1/2 Feet, and at that distance the Chord 7-3/4 Inches subtends an  Angle of 2 deg. 0'. 7''. Now half this Angle is the Angle which these  emergent Rays contain with the emergent mean refrangible Rays, and a  quarter thereof, that is 30'. 2''. may be accounted the Angle which they  would contain with the same emergent mean refrangible Rays, were they  co-incident to them within the Glass, and suffered no other Refraction  than that at their Emergence. For, if two equal Refractions, the one at  the Incidence of the Rays on the Prism, the other at their Emergence,  make half the Angle 2 deg. 0'. 7''. then one of those Refractions will  make about a quarter of that Angle, and this quarter added to, and  subducted from the Angle of Refraction of the mean refrangible Rays,  which was 53 deg. 35', gives the Angles of Refraction of the most and  least refrangible Rays 54 deg. 5' 2'', and 53 deg. 4' 58'', whose Sines  are 8099 and 7995, the common Angle of Incidence being 31 deg. 15', and  its Sine 5188; and these Sines in the least round Numbers are in  proportion to one another, as 78 and 77 to 50.    Now, if you subduct the common Sine of Incidence 50 from the Sines of  Refraction 77 and 78, the Remainders 27 and 28 shew, that in small  Refractions the Refraction of the least refrangible Rays is to the  Refraction of the most refrangible ones, as 27 to 28 very nearly, and  that the difference of the Refractions of the least refrangible and most  refrangible Rays is about the 27-1/2th Part of the whole Refraction of  the mean refrangible Rays.    Whence they that are skilled in Opticks will easily understand,[G] that  the Breadth of the least circular Space, into which Object-glasses of  Telescopes can collect all sorts of Parallel Rays, is about the 27-1/2th  Part of half the Aperture of the Glass, or 55th Part of the whole  Aperture; and that the Focus of the most refrangible Rays is nearer to  the Object-glass than the Focus of the least refrangible ones, by about  the 27-1/2th Part of the distance between the Object-glass and the Focus  of the mean refrangible ones.    And if Rays of all sorts, flowing from any one lucid Point in the Axis  of any convex Lens, be made by the Refraction of the Lens to converge to  Points not too remote from the Lens, the Focus of the most refrangible  Rays shall be nearer to the Lens than the Focus of the least refrangible  ones, by a distance which is to the 27-1/2th Part of the distance of the  Focus of the mean refrangible Rays from the Lens, as the distance  between that Focus and the lucid Point, from whence the Rays flow, is to  the distance between that lucid Point and the Lens very nearly.    Now to examine whether the Difference between the Refractions, which the  most refrangible and the least refrangible Rays flowing from the same  Point suffer in the Object-glasses of Telescopes and such-like Glasses,  be so great as is here described, I contrived the following Experiment.    _Exper._ 16. The Lens which I used in the second and eighth Experiments,  being placed six Feet and an Inch distant from any Object, collected the  Species of that Object by the mean refrangible Rays at the distance of  six Feet and an Inch from the Lens on the other side. And therefore by  the foregoing Rule, it ought to collect the Species of that Object by  the least refrangible Rays at the distance of six Feet and 3-2/3 Inches  from the Lens, and by the most refrangible ones at the distance of five  Feet and 10-1/3 Inches from it: So that between the two Places, where  these least and most refrangible Rays collect the Species, there may be  the distance of about 5-1/3 Inches. For by that Rule, as six Feet and an  Inch (the distance of the Lens from the lucid Object) is to twelve Feet  and two Inches (the distance of the lucid Object from the Focus of the  mean refrangible Rays) that is, as One is to Two; so is the 27-1/2th  Part of six Feet and an Inch (the distance between the Lens and the same  Focus) to the distance between the Focus of the most refrangible Rays  and the Focus of the least refrangible ones, which is therefore 5-17/55  Inches, that is very nearly 5-1/3 Inches. Now to know whether this  Measure was true, I repeated the second and eighth Experiment with  coloured Light, which was less compounded than that I there made use of:  For I now separated the heterogeneous Rays from one another by the  Method I described in the eleventh Experiment, so as to make a coloured  Spectrum about twelve or fifteen Times longer than broad. This Spectrum  I cast on a printed Book, and placing the above-mentioned Lens at the  distance of six Feet and an Inch from this Spectrum to collect the  Species of the illuminated Letters at the same distance on the other  side, I found that the Species of the Letters illuminated with blue were  nearer to the Lens than those illuminated with deep red by about three  Inches, or three and a quarter; but the Species of the Letters  illuminated with indigo and violet appeared so confused and indistinct,  that I could not read them: Whereupon viewing the Prism, I found it was  full of Veins running from one end of the Glass to the other; so that  the Refraction could not be regular. I took another Prism therefore  which was free from Veins, and instead of the Letters I used two or  three Parallel black Lines a little broader than the Strokes of the  Letters, and casting the Colours upon these Lines in such manner, that  the Lines ran along the Colours from one end of the Spectrum to the  other, I found that the Focus where the indigo, or confine of this  Colour and violet cast the Species of the black Lines most distinctly,  to be about four Inches, or 4-1/4 nearer to the Lens than the Focus,  where the deepest red cast the Species of the same black Lines most  distinctly. The violet was so faint and dark, that I could not discern  the Species of the Lines distinctly by that Colour; and therefore  considering that the Prism was made of a dark coloured Glass inclining  to green, I took another Prism of clear white Glass; but the Spectrum of  Colours which this Prism made had long white Streams of faint Light  shooting out from both ends of the Colours, which made me conclude that  something was amiss; and viewing the Prism, I found two or three little  Bubbles in the Glass, which refracted the Light irregularly. Wherefore I  covered that Part of the Glass with black Paper, and letting the Light  pass through another Part of it which was free from such Bubbles, the  Spectrum of Colours became free from those irregular Streams of Light,  and was now such as I desired. But still I found the violet so dark and  faint, that I could scarce see the Species of the Lines by the violet,  and not at all by the deepest Part of it, which was next the end of the  Spectrum. I suspected therefore, that this faint and dark Colour might  be allayed by that scattering Light which was refracted, and reflected  irregularly, partly by some very small Bubbles in the Glasses, and  partly by the Inequalities of their Polish; which Light, tho' it was but  little, yet it being of a white Colour, might suffice to affect the  Sense so strongly as to disturb the Phaenomena of that weak and dark  Colour the violet, and therefore I tried, as in the 12th, 13th, and 14th  Experiments, whether the Light of this Colour did not consist of a  sensible Mixture of heterogeneous Rays, but found it did not. Nor did  the Refractions cause any other sensible Colour than violet to emerge  out of this Light, as they would have done out of white Light, and by  consequence out of this violet Light had it been sensibly compounded  with white Light. And therefore I concluded, that the reason why I could  not see the Species of the Lines distinctly by this Colour, was only  the Darkness of this Colour, and Thinness of its Light, and its distance  from the Axis of the Lens; I divided therefore those Parallel black  Lines into equal Parts, by which I might readily know the distances of  the Colours in the Spectrum from one another, and noted the distances of  the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33527"],[0,"Whales, Dolphins, and Porpoises of the Western North Atlantic (#12)"],[1," each flipper. Further, minke whales rarely reach 30 feet  (9.1 m) in maximum length.      Distribution    The distribution of Bryde's whales is rather poorly known, no doubt in  part, because the species is difficult to positively identify at sea,  and records of its occurrence may have often been confused with those of  sei whales, fin whales, or minke whales. From stranded animals and  confirmed sightings at sea, the species appears to be found primarily  near shore in areas of high productivity in tropical or subtropical  waters, though it ventures into warmer temperate waters as well. It has  been reported from Virginia south into the northeast Gulf of Mexico and  the southeast Caribbean, and southern West Indies (Curacao and Granada).  To date no migration has been described for the species.      Stranded Specimens    Stranded Bryde's whales can be positively identified by the three ridges  along the top of the head from the area of the blowhole to the tip of  the snout. All other species of balaenopterid whales, except humpback  whales have but a single ridge. If the head of a stranded specimen is  buried in sand, is decomposed beyond recognition, or is otherwise  inaccessible for identification, Bryde's whales can still be  distinguished from sei whales by differences in the relative lengths of  the ventral grooves (Table 2) and from both the fin whale and the sei  whale by differences in the characteristics of the baleen plates (Table  2).    [Illustration: Figure 30.--On the head of this Bryde's whale off La  Jolla, Calif. two of the three head ridges characteristic of the  species, the main ridge and the left auxiliary ridge, are clearly  visible. These ridges permit this animal to be positively identified as  a Bryde's whale. (_Photo by F. Morejohn._)]    [Illustration: Figure 31.--Bryde's whales in the Gulf of California and  north of Hawaii (inset). In both, note the tall, sickle-shaped  appearance of the dorsal fin, much like that of the sei whale. In the  animal in the larger photo note the ragged rear margin of the dorsal  fin, a frequently observed characteristic in Bryde's whales. In the  animal on the left note also the region of gray on the sides in front of  the dorsal fin. (_Photos by W. C. Cummings and S.

In both animals note  the head shape similar to that of the sei whale, and the three distinct  head ridges. In the animal on the bottom, note that the two outermost  ridges have their origin in grooves beside the blowholes. In the animal  on the top, note also the baleen plates, up to at least 300 per side and  dark gray with coarse gray bristles. There is infrequently a rather wide  interval at the front of the mouth between the left and right rows of  baleen. (_Photos by U.S. National Museum, courtesy of J. G. Mead (top)  and M. B.

Description    Humpback whales reach a length of 53 feet (16.2 m).    The body is robust, narrowing rapidly on the tail stock. The head is  quite broad and rounded, somewhat like that of the blue whale. The head  ridge characteristic of other balaenopterid species is indistinct and is  replaced in prominence by a string of fleshy \"knobs\" or protuberances,  many more of which are randomly distributed on the top of the head and  on the lower jaw. There is a distinctive rounded projection near the tip  of the lower jaw. Humpback whales carry many barnacles and whale lice.  The baleen plates are all black with black or olive-black bristles.    The flippers are very long (nearly a third as long as the body), are  scalloped on at least the leading edge, and are nearly all white.    The dorsal fin, located slightly more than two-thirds of the way back on  the back in approximately the same position as that of the fin whale, is  small and varies in size and shape from a small, triangular nubbin to a  more substantial, sharply falcate fin. The dorsal fin frequently  includes a step or hump, which is quite distinct when the animal arches  its back to begin a dive and from which the species derives its common  name.    Humpback whales are basically black in color with a white region of  varying size on the belly, which upon close examination may often be  seen to be crosshatched with thin dark lines; the flippers and the  undersides of the flukes also are white.      Natural History Notes    The blow of humpback whales is from 8 to 10 feet (2.4 to 3.1 m) tall and  has been described as balloon-shaped. It is wide relative to its height.  Feeding humpback whales habitually blow 4-8 times at intervals of 15-30  s after a long dive. In the tropics they habitually blow 2-4 times in  succession when beginning a long dive. In diving, humpback whales throw  the tail flukes high into the air, exposing the sometimes white  undersurface and the rippled rear margin.    Humpback whales often leap clear of the water, raise a flipper, and slap  it against the water, or \"lobtail,\" raising the tail high into the air  and bringing it crashing back to the water in a loud report. Often,  particularly when they are encountered on their tropical breeding  grounds, humpback whales will be found lying on their sides with a long  flipper in the air.    Humpback whales feed on krill and schooling fish.      May Be Confused With    From a distance humpback whales may be confused with any of the other  large balaenopterid (rorqual) whales--blue, fin, sei, or Bryde's.  Although it is highly variable, the dorsal fin most closely resembles  that of the blue whale. However, it is located farther forward on the  back. Humpback whales distinguish themselves from the remainder of the  rorquals by their habit of raising the flukes high into the air when  starting a long dive. (In very shallow water they may not raise the  flukes at all.) The only other rorqual to do so--the blue whale--raises  the flukes slightly or not at all.    Under some conditions humpback whales may be confused with sperm whales  at a distance. When arching the back to begin a dive, both may show a  distinct hump. Both species frequently raise their flukes nearly  vertically when beginning a long dive but differ in several ways. The  flukes of humpback whales show varying amounts of white beneath, are  pointed on the tips, and are distinctly concaved and irregularly rippled  on the rear margin. Those of sperm whales are all dark and more  flattened and even along the rear margin. Further the species can be  distinguished in the following ways:            HUMPBACK WHALE                 SPERM WHALE                                  BLOW      Projects upwards from center    Projects obliquely forward    of head. Usually blows          from left side of snout.    4-8 times (2-4 times in         Usually blows many times    tropics) before diving.         (20-50 or more) before diving.                                  HEAD      Raised area around blowholes,   Blunted, long, smooth.    knobs on upper surface.                                 FLUKES      Often white underneath,         Smooth, all black on rear    concaved and scalloped on       margin.    rear margin, deeply notched.                                FLIPPERS      Extremely long (to one-third    Short; all black.    of body), white and scalloped    on leading edge.                          DORSAL FIN (OR HUMP)      Triangular to falcate fin,      Rounded hump, two-thirds    including a step or hump in     back on back followed by    front of the dorsal fin;        knuckles or crenulations.    smooth.    When they can be examined at close range, humpback whales can be easily  distinguished from all other large whale species with a dorsal fin by  the tuberosities or knobs on the head, by the long white flippers  scalloped on the leading edge, by the small distinctive dorsal fin, and  by their distinctive tail flukes.      Distribution    In the western North Atlantic, humpback whales are widely distributed  from north of Iceland, Disko Bay and west of Greenland, south to  Venezuela and around the tropical islands of the West Indies. They have  been reported from the central and eastern Gulf of Mexico. Summer ranges  extend at least from New England north to the pack ice, and feeding  concentrations may be found in any portion of this region. During  winter, humpback whales migrate southward to the shallow borderlands of  Bermuda, to the Bahamas, and to the West Indies to calve and mate.      Stranded Specimens    The most distinctive features of stranded humpback whales are 1) the  ventral grooves, 14-22 in number, very wide and extending to the navel;  2) the tuberosities of the snout and lower jaw, often the sites of  numerous barnacle colonies; 3) the long flippers (to nearly a third of  the total body length); and 4) the distinctive rounded projection near  the tip of the lower jaw.    If these characteristics are not sufficiently clear, the species may be  identifiable by the characteristics of the baleen plates (Table 2).    [Illustration: Figure 33.--Three views of blowing humpback whales. The  blow of this species is usually less than 10 feet (3.1 m) tall, wider  than it is high, and has been described as balloon-shaped. In the photo  on the top, the wind has already begun to distort the blow. In the photo  on the bottom, two separate columns are visible. All baleen whales have  a bipartite blowhole, and if an observer is directly behind or in front  of either the right whale or the humpback whale under ideal wind  conditions, the blows of these two species may appear as two distinct  spouts.
