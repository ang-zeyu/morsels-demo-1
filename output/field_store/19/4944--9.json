They are still  in a good state of preservation, and although some of the figures of  Christ, and of the Virgin in particular, retain much of the Greek  manner, others representing the Evangelists, and Doctors instructing the  Monks of the Franciscan Order, from their chairs, exhibit an originality  of conception and arrangement that does not appear in contemporary  works. The colouring is bold, the proportions are gigantic even in the  distance, and not badly preserved; in short, painting may there be said  to have almost advanced beyond what the mosaic worker at first attempted  to do. The whole of these, indeed, are steps in the progress of the  human intellect not to be recounted in one history, and form beyond  question the distinguishing excellence of the Florentine artist, when  put into competition with either the Pisans or the Sienese. Nor do I  perceive how, after the authority of Vasari, who assigns the work of the  ceiling to Cimabue, confirmed by the tradition of five centuries, P.  della Valle is justified at this day, in ascribing that painting to  Giotto, a painter of a milder genius. If he was induced to prefer other  artists to Cimabue, because they gave the eyes less fierceness, and the  nose a finer shape, these circumstances appear to me too insignificant  to degrade Cimabue from that rank which he enjoys in impartial  history.[47] He has moreover asserted, that Cimabue neither promoted nor  injured the Florentine school by his productions, a harsh judgment, in  the opinion of those who have perused so many old writers belonging to  the city who have celebrated his merits, and of those who have studied  the works of the Florentine artists before his time, and seen how  greatly Cimabue surpasses them.    If Cimabue was the Michelangiolo of that age, Giotto was the Raffaello.  Painting, in his hands, became so elegant, that none of his school, nor  of any other, till the time of Masaccio, surpassed, or even equalled  him, at least in gracefulness of manner. Giotto was born in the country,  and was bred a shepherd; but he was likewise born a painter; and  continually exercised his genius in delineating some object or other  around him. A sheep which he had drawn on a flat stone, after nature,  attracted the notice of Cimabue, who by chance passed that way: he  demanded leave of his father to take him to Florence, that he might  afford him instruction; confident, that in him, he was about to raise up  a new ornament to the art. Giotto commenced by imitating his master, but  quickly surpassed him. An Annunciation, in the possession of the Fathers  of Badia, is one of his earliest works. The style is somewhat dry, but  shews a grace and diligence, that announced the improvement we  afterwards discern. Through him symmetry became more chaste, design more  pleasing, and colouring softer than before. The meagre hands, the sharp  pointed feet, and staring eyes, remnants of the Grecian manner, all  acquired more correctness under him.    It is not possible to assign the cause of this transition, as we are  able to do in the case of later painters; but it is reasonable to  conclude that it was not wholly produced, even by the almost divine  genius of this artist, unaided by adventitious circumstances. There is  no necessity for sending him, as some have done, to be instructed at  Pisa; his history does not warrant it, and an historian is not a  diviner. Much less ought we to refer him to the school of F. Jacopo da  Turrita, and give him Memmi and Lorenzetti for fellow pupils, who are  not known to have been in Rome when F. Jacopo was distinguished for his  best manner. But P. della Valle thinks he discovers in Giotto's first  painting, the style and composition of Giunta, (Preface to Vasari, p.  17,) and in the pictures of Giotto at S. Croce, in Florence, which \"_he  has meditated upon a hundred times_,\" he recognizes F. Jacopo, and finds  \"_reason for opining_\" that he was the master of Giotto. (Vide tom. ii.  p. 78.) When a person becomes attached to a system, he often sees and  opines what no one else can possibly see or opine. In the same manner  Baldinucci wished to refer to the school of Giotto, one Duccio da Siena,  Vital di Bologna, and many others, as will be noticed; and he too argues  upon a resemblance of style, which, to say truth, neither I nor any one  I know can perceive. If I cannot then agree with Baldinucci, can I value  his imitator? and more particularly as it is no question here of Vitale,  or any other artist of mediocrity, almost unknown to history, but of  Giotto himself. Is it likely, with a genius such as his, and born in an  age not wholly barbarous, with the advantages enjoyed under Cimabue,  especially in point of colouring, that he would take Giunta for his  model, or listen to the instruction of Fra Mino, in order to excel his  master. Besides, what advantage can be obtained from thus disturbing the  order of chronology, violating history, and rejecting the tradition of  Giotto's native school, in order to account for his new style?    It is most probable that, as the great Michelangiolo, by modelling and  studying the antique, quickly surpassed in painting his master,  Ghirlandaio, the same occurred with regard to Giotto. It is at least  known that he was also a sculptor, and that his models were preserved  till the time of Lorenzo Ghiberti. Nor was he without good examples.  There were specimens of antique sculpture at Florence, which may be yet  seen near the cathedral, (not to mention those which he afterwards saw  at Rome); and their merit, then already established by the practice of  Niccola and Giovanni of Pisa, could not be unknown to Giotto, to whom  nature had granted such a taste for the exquisite and the beautiful.  When one contemplates some of his heads of men; some of his forms,  proportioned far beyond the littleness of his contemporaries; his taste  in flowing, natural, and becoming drapery; some of his attitudes after  the manner of the antique, breathing grace and tranquillity, it is  scarce possible to doubt that he derived no small advantage from ancient  sculpture. His very defects discover this. A good writer (the author of  the Guide of Bologna) remarks in him a style which partakes of statuary,  contrary to the practice of contemporary foreign artists; a circumstance  very common, as we shall observe, under the Roman school, to those  painters who designed from statues. I shall be told that he probably  derived assistance from the sculpture of the two Pisani; especially as  Baldinucci has discovered a strong resemblance between his style and  that of Giovanni, and some others also have noticed the circular  compositions, the proportions and casting of the drapery which one  perceives in the basso-relievos of the early Pisan school. I would not  deny that he also availed himself of them; but it was perhaps in the  manner that Raffaello profited by Michelangiolo, whose example taught  him to imitate the antique. Nor let it be objected to me that the  dryness of the design, the artifice of concealing the feet by long  garments, the inaccuracy of the extremities, and similar defects, betray  rather a Pisan than an Attic origin. This only proves, that when he  became the founder of a style, he did not aim at giving it the  perfection of which it was susceptible, and which it could hardly be  expected to obtain amid the numerous avocations in which he appears to  have been engaged; in short, I cannot persuade myself, that without the  imitation of the antique, he could in so short a time have made such a  progress, as to have been admired even by Bonarruoti himself.[48]    The first histories of the patriarch S. Francesco, at Assisi, near the  paintings of his master, shew how greatly he excelled him. As his work  advanced he became more correct; and towards the conclusion, he already  manifested a design more varied in the countenances, and improved in the  extremities; the features are more animated, the attitudes more  ingenious, and the landscape more natural. To one who examines them with  attention, the composition appears the most surprising; a branch of the  art, in which he seems not only to surpass himself, but even sometimes  appears unrivalled. In many historical pictures, he often aimed at  ornamenting with buildings, which he painted of a red, or azure, or a  yellow, the colours employed in staining houses, or of a dazzling white,  in imitation of Parian marble. One of his best pictures in this work is  that of a thirsty person, to the expression of which scarcely any thing  could be added by the animating pencil of Raffaello d'Urbino himself.  With similar skill he painted in the inferior church, and this is  perhaps the best performance which has reached our times, though  specimens remain in Ravenna, in Padua, in Rome, in Florence, and in  Pisa. It is assuredly the most spirited of all, for he has there, with  the most poetical images, depicted the saint shunning vice, and a  follower of virtue; it is my opinion that he here gave the first example  of symbolical painting, so familiar to his best followers.    His inventions, which, according to the custom of the age, were employed  in scripture history, are repeated by him in nearly the same style in  several places; and are generally most pleasing when the proportions of  the figures are the least. His small pictures of the Acts of St. Peter  and St. Paul, with some representations of our Saviour, and of various  saints, in the sacristy of the Vatican, appear most elegant and highly  finished miniatures; as likewise are some others in the church of the  Holy Cross at Florence, taken from scriptural history, or from the life  of St. Francis. The real art of portrait painting commenced with him; to  whom we are indebted for correct likenesses of Dante, of Brunetto  Latini, and of Corso Donati. It was indeed before attempted, but,  according to Vasari, no one had succeeded. He also"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34501"],[0,"Wolf and Coyote Trapping: An Up-to-Date Wolf Hunter's Guide (#12)"],[1,"eather, make the nest  for the trap somewhat deeper and line it well with sage leaves or  some other light material, also fill in around jaws and springs with  same, before covering. This will prevent the trap from freezing down.  Do not put cotton under the pan as some advise doing, for if it gets  wet it will freeze and interfere with the working of the trap. If the  traps spring too easily, they may be remedied by drilling a small  hole through the edge of the pan and inserting a tooth pick or small  twig in such a way that it will support the pan. This will prevent  birds and small animals from springing the traps. The same result may  be obtained by bending the point of the \"dog\" or trigger of the trap  upward and thereby causing the trap to spring harder.    Always before placing the trap in position, turn the springs towards  the jaw that is held down by the trigger. This will allow the loose  jaw to drop down to a level and let the trap rest more solidly in its  nest. When adjusting the pan, always work from under the loose jaw,  to avoid accidents.    Many trappers advise wearing gloves when setting or otherwise  handling the traps, to prevent leaving human scent. It is our opinion  that this is not only unnecessary but also useless, as the human odor  will pass through a leather glove readily, and even through the sole  of a heavy shoe. While there is no doubt that the scent of man will  put any wary animal on its guard, there is no way to avoid leaving  this same scent about the setting. This, however, will pass away  after three or four days and it is after the traps have been set for  some time that most of the wolves and coyotes are captured.    Although the traps may be handled with bare hands, we would advise  that it is wise to not leave any more lasting odors than that from  handling the traps, also do not leave any footprints or other signs  of human presence. If, in summer, a line of traps can be set just  before a rain, so much the better, as all odors and signs of  disturbance will be removed by it. In winter a light fall of snow  will have a tendency to improve the catch, as it will cover all human  signs and to a great extent, smother the human and other odors that  may have been left about the setting.    It is important that no lasting, foreign odors be allowed to remain  on the traps or any of the implements used in making the set. The  trapper should make it a point at all times to keep the traps clean  and free from scents which might enable the animals to locate and  avoid the trap. For the same reason strong smelling grease and oils,  such as kerosene should never be used as preservatives, in fact, we  think it best that the traps have no preparation whatever. Some  trappers dip the traps in blood but unless the entire setting is  saturated with same, it is not wise to do so as the wolf would be  sure to locate it. When setting close to a large bait, it is well to  rub the trap and chain with a piece of the bait, so that everything  about the setting will have the same odor.      [Illustration: Wyoming Wolf Trapper Driving the Trap Stake.]    The same result may be obtained by covering the traps with hair from  the animal used for bait, or with the contents of the paunch. When  nesting the traps in sage leaves, as advised elsewhere, the odor of  the trap will be greatly neutralized by the leaves, as they have a  powerful odor. In trail sets on the cattle and sheep range, the traps  may be covered with the droppings of the animals. All of these  methods have the same result, namely, that of smothering the odor of  the trap and allaying the animals' suspicions.    Just what will be needed for trapping wolves and coyotes will depend  entirely on circumstances, but mainly on just how much of a business  one wishes to make of it. The abundance or scarcity of the game, the  nature of the country, the proximity to civilization and many other  matters must also be considered. For the average professional trapper  of the western cattle range, we believe the following will be about  right: In the country lying just east of the Rocky Mountain Range,  vegetation is rather scanty and as horses must pick their own living,  they must have plenty of time for doing so, therefore, several saddle  horses will be needed. In that way the trapper can change horses  daily and give them a chance to rest and rustle food. For  transporting the outfit and stringing out the traps, pack horses must  be employed. Old, worn out horses will answer for packing and after  the traps are once strung out, they may be killed for bait or  otherwise disposed of, as one of the saddle horses may be used for  what little packing is needed. The equipment should consist of a good  easy saddle, bridle, pack-saddles, pack sacks, saddle blankets,  hobbles, picket ropes, etc. If one is camping a good camping outfit  will be necessary. Such an outfit would consist of a tent, blankets,  cooking utensils, axe and some toilet articles. The average trapper  would easily handle 100 traps, some trappers have many more, and the  proper sizes and number of each size would depend on the  proportionate number of wolves and coyotes found in that locality.  The trapper must also have wire for fastening traps, stakes, paper  for covering, a file for sharpening the axe and repairing traps, a  whetstone, a pair of cutting pliers, a high powered rifle and plenty  of ammunition, saddle scabbard, gun oil, hunting knife, axe sheath,  etc. Such an outfit is costly, and is only useful to the professional  trapper, but if game is plentiful, it will soon pay for itself.    For the ranchman, sheep herder or average western trapper, all that  need be purchased is an outfit of traps of a number which may be  conveniently handled, and a rifle with ammunition for same. All of  the outfit that will be needed is to be found on any western ranch  and as the trapper will not be camping out, the camp outfit would be  omitted.        CHAPTER X.    SCENTS AND BAITS.    Scents for attracting animals to traps have been employed for many  years, but trappers differ greatly in their views regarding its  value. Some use scent only, to attract the animals, and make good  catches; others use bait alone and condemn anything in the line of  scent. Some use neither scent nor bait but depend entirely on \"blind  sets\".    The value of scent for trapping wolves and coyotes depends on the  kind that is used and the method employed, the time of year, the sex  of the animal, whether trapping is prosecuted extensively, etc. We  have no doubt that if the right scent is employed and used in the  proper way that it will be productive of good results. In all  probability those who are so ready to condemn scents have never used  the right kind, or having tried the proper kind, have not used it in  the right way.    If one will stop to consider just what scent is, and the object in  using it, he must readily perceive its value, if the right kind is  used. Scents are of various kinds and are expected to appeal to the  animal in different ways. When one uses bait, it is the odor of same  that attracts the animal from a distance,--why then will not a scent  which suggests their favorite food also prove attractive? All animals  of the dog family are very susceptible to food odors and the same  scents will attract both the wolf and coyote. Then there are other  scents which appeal to the animal's passions. These will be described  in the following pages. They are especially attractive to the wolf  during the mating season, but are also good at other times, and  should be used without bait.    The habit of depositing urine on the same spot used by another for  that purpose is characteristic of all animals of the dog family. This  is sometimes taken advantage of by the trapper, and the wolf urine is  used in that way.    In some parts of the country it is probable that one would be more  successful by using bait alone; in other places blind sets would be  better. For many localities it is best to use a good scent, and  especially so at certain seasons. For trapping grey wolves in summer,  it is especially valuable as at that time meat baits soon become  tainted and are not attractive to the animals.    The United States Biological Survey have made exhaustive tests with  scents and the result is given in the following:    \"Success in trapping depends mainly on the use of scents that will  attract the wolves to the neighborhood of a trap and keep them  tramping and pawing until caught. Meat bait alone is of little use,  for as a rule the wolves kill an ample supply for themselves. Many  tests of scents, both prepared baits and various animal musks, have  been made with wolves in the field and in the National Zoological  Park. While some have given a fair degree of success, others have  proved worthless, and no one odor has proved entirely satisfactory.  Experiments are being continued, however, and new odors tried.\"    \"Beaver musk (castoreum) and the commercial perfumery sold as musk  have proved effective in many cases by causing the wolf to turn aside  to follow the scented cross line and so walk into the trap. Siberian  musk (from the Siberian musk deer ) is very attractive to wolves in  the Zoo. Oil of anise and oil of rhodium seem to have no attraction  for wild wolves, and are scarcely noticed by those in confinement.  Assafoetida is mildly attractive to wolves and coyotes at the Zoo,  but used alone is very slightly, if at all, attractive to those on  the range.\"    \"Wolf urine taken from the bladder is used by some trappers, and is  said to be very successful. It is bottled and kept until rancid and  then sprinkled over the trap. The sexual organs of the female wolf  immersed in the urine are said to add efficacy to this bait. The  urine of the female in the rutting season is said to be especially  attractive to males; it should be used in January or February.\"    \"Fetid bait.--The"]]]
