Collecting was  more extensive in these streams, and sampling was done over a wider  range of habitat, than in the Arkansas and Walnut rivers.    The fish taken in the first five seine hauls at each station were  counted and the number of each species was recorded as a percentage of  the total number of fish taken. These percentages were calculated for  the main stream and for each tributary in an attempt to discern possible  intra-stream faunal patterns. In Table 6 lower, middle, and upper  segments of each stream have been segregated and the average of all  stations within each segment is shown.    The results are subject to several sources of error, some of which are  discussed below:    (1) Seining techniques could not be entirely standardized. One station  might present a series of long narrow riffles and narrow, shallow pools  in which only a small seine could be used effectively; another station  might consist of a large, deep, isolated pool in which a larger seine  was needed for effective sampling. In practice, the five seine hauls  were made with any of several seines ranging from ten to twenty feet in  length.    (2) Seines are species-selective, due partly to the preference of  certain fishes for special habitat niches. Fishes that are often found  under stones or in weedy pools require special collecting techniques and  frequently were not represented in the initial five hauls. If work  subsequent to the first five hauls indicated that such fish were a  prominent part of the fauna at a particular station, these results were  considered before percentages were calculated.    (3) Temporal variations occur in populations at the same station. There  were both seasonal and diurnal differences in relative numbers of  species taken in these collections. This was noted especially at station  C-5 where collecting was done both at night and by day. Spawning by  certain species during the course of the study complicated estimates of  their relative abundance.    (4) In tabulating percentages of fishes obtained an arbitrary element is  often unavoidable in deciding whether a station, especially a station on  a tributary, should be considered as part of the lower, middle, or upper  segment of a river system.    Despite these disadvantages it is felt that table 6 has factual basis  permitting some reliable interpretation.

A  conspicuous characteristic of the lower segment was the general  restriction of the deep-bodied suckers and the carp to this part of the  stream. Other fishes that were most common in the lower section were  _Pimephales vigilax_, _Percina phoxocephala_, _Gambusia affinis_, and  _Aplodinotus grunniens_. _Labidesthes sicculus_ and _Lepisosteus osseus_  ranged into the middle section of the stream, but were present in larger  numbers downstream. _Ictalurus punctatus_, _Pomoxis annularis_, and  _Lepomis macrochirus_ were taken chiefly in downstream habitats;  however, stocking has confused the distributional pattern of these  species. _Notropis lutrensis_, although found throughout the system,  progressively declined in numbers taken in the middle and upper  sections. Approximately 18 species were usually taken in downstream  collections.    No species were found exclusively in the middle section of the Big Caney  system. _Micropterus punctulatus_, _Notropis umbratilis_, and _Lepomis  megalotis_ tended to be most common in the middle section of the main  stream. These three species were taken together at stations C-5, C-6,  C-8, and C-10.    The upper section yielded no species that did not occur also in another  section. Fishes most abundant in the upper section included: _Campostoma  anomalum_, _Etheostoma spectabile_, _Notropis boops_, _Notropis  rubellus_, _Pimephales notatus_, and _Lepomis cyanellus_. _Ictalurus  natalis_ also seemed more common upstream than in lower parts of the  basin.    _Campostoma anomalum_ was one of the most common fishes taken at many of  the stations on small upland tributaries. In downstream collections its  relative abundance was less, although it was often concentrated on  riffles.    In the Big Caney system as a whole _Notropis umbratilis_ was the most  abundant species. Several species were present throughout the system in  proportions varying, sometimes greatly, from station to station.  _Lepomis megalotis_ and _Lepomis humilis_ were erratic in occurrence,  and the numbers of _Notropis camurus_ and _Ictalurus melas_ varied  without pattern.      _Grouse Creek_    The fauna of the main stream of Grouse Creek fluctuated more in number  and kinds of fish from station to station than did the fauna of Big  Caney River. Again, the deep-bodied suckers showed downstream  proclivities. In addition, _Notropis buchanani_, _Pimephales tenellus_,  _Percina copelandi_, _Percina phoxocephala_, _Notropis percobromus_ and  _Pylodictis olivaris_ were taken only at the lowermost station (G-1). At  stations G-2 and G-3 the creek is sluggish and often turbid, meandering  between high mud banks in a flood plain. At these stations _Fundulus  notatus_, _Gambusia affinis, La_-_bidesthes sicculus_, _Ictalurus  melas,_ and _Lepomis humilis_ were the most common"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3457"],[0,"The Man of the Forest (#12)"],[1,"saddle.  Helen became anxious. Just then Dale strode back to them.    \"All cinched up, Roy?\"    \"Jest ready,\" replied Roy.    Then Dale stood beside Helen. How tall he was! His wide shoulders seemed  on a level with the pommel of her saddle. He put an affectionate hand on  the horse.    \"His name's Ranger an' he's the fastest an' finest horse in this  country.\"    \"I reckon he shore is--along with my bay,\" corroborated Roy.    \"Roy, if you rode Ranger he'd beat your pet,\" said Dale. \"We can start  now. Roy, you drive the pack-horses.\"    He took another look at Helen's saddle and then moved to do likewise  with Bo's.    \"Are you--all right?\" he asked, quickly.    Bo reeled in her seat.    \"I'm n-near froze,\" she replied, in a faint voice. Her face shone white  in the starlight. Helen recognized that Bo was more than cold.    \"Oh, Bo!\" she called, in distress.    \"Nell, don't you worry, now.\"    \"Let me carry you,\" suggested Dale.    \"No. I'll s-s-stick on this horse or d-die,\" fiercely retorted Bo.    The two men looked up at her white face and then at each other. Then Roy  walked away toward the dark bunch of horses off the road and Dale swung  astride the one horse left.    \"Keep close to me,\" he said.    Bo fell in line and Helen brought up the rear.    Helen imagined she was near the end of a dream. Presently she would  awaken with a start and see the pale walls of her little room at  home, and hear the cherry branches brushing her window, and the old  clarion-voiced cock proclaim the hour of dawn.        CHAPTER VI    The horses trotted. And the exercise soon warmed Helen, until she was  fairly comfortable except in her fingers. In mind, however, she grew  more miserable as she more fully realized her situation. The night now  became so dark that, although the head of her horse was alongside the  flank of Bo's, she could scarcely see Bo. From time to time Helen's  anxious query brought from her sister the answer that she was all right.    Helen had not ridden a horse for more than a year, and for several  years she had not ridden with any regularity. Despite her thrills  upon mounting, she had entertained misgivings. But she was agreeably  surprised, for the horse, Ranger, had an easy gait, and she found she  had not forgotten how to ride. Bo, having been used to riding on a farm  near home, might be expected to acquit herself admirably. It occurred  to Helen what a plight they would have been in but for the thick,  comfortable riding outfits.    Dark as the night was, Helen could dimly make out the road underneath.  It was rocky, and apparently little used. When Dale turned off the road  into the low brush or sage of what seemed a level plain, the traveling  was harder, rougher, and yet no slower. The horses kept to the gait of  the leaders. Helen, discovering it unnecessary, ceased attempting to  guide Ranger. There were dim shapes in the gloom ahead, and always they  gave Helen uneasiness, until closer approach proved them to be rocks  or low, scrubby trees. These increased in both size and number as the  horses progressed. Often Helen looked back into the gloom behind.  This act was involuntary and occasioned her sensations of dread. Dale  expected to be pursued. And Helen experienced, along with the dread,  flashes of unfamiliar resentment. Not only was there an attempt afoot  to rob her of her heritage, but even her personal liberty. Then she  shuddered at the significance of Dale's words regarding her possible  abduction by this hired gang. It seemed monstrous, impossible. Yet,  manifestly it was true enough to Dale and his allies. The West, then, in  reality was raw, hard, inevitable.    Suddenly her horse stopped. He had come up alongside Bo's horse. Dale  had halted ahead, and apparently was listening. Roy and the pack-train  were out of sight in the gloom.    \"What is it?\" whispered Helen.    \"Reckon I heard a wolf,\" replied Dale.    \"Was that cry a wolf's?\" asked Bo. \"I heard. It was wild.\"    \"We're gettin' up close to the foot-hills,\" said Dale. \"Feel how much  colder the air is.\"    \"I'm warm now,\" replied Bo. \"I guess being near froze was what ailed  me.... Nell, how 're you?\"    \"I'm warm, too, but--\" Helen answered.    \"If you had your choice of being here or back home, snug in bed--which  would you take?\" asked Bo.    \"Bo!\" exclaimed Helen, aghast.    \"Well, I'd choose to be right here on this horse,\" rejoined Bo.    Dale heard her, for he turned an instant, then slapped his horse and  started on.    Helen now rode beside Bo, and for a long time they climbed steadily in  silence. Helen knew when that dark hour before dawn had passed, and she  welcomed an almost imperceptible lightening in the east. Then the stars  paled. Gradually a grayness absorbed all but the larger stars. The  great white morning star, wonderful as Helen had never seen it, lost its  brilliance and life and seemed to retreat into the dimming blue.    Daylight came gradually, so that the gray desert became distinguishable  by degrees. Rolling bare hills, half obscured by the gray lifting mantle  of night, rose in the foreground, and behind was gray space, slowly  taking form and substance. In the east there was a kindling of pale  rose and silver that lengthened and brightened along a horizon growing  visibly rugged.    \"Reckon we'd better catch up with Roy,\" said Dale, and he spurred his  horse.    Ranger and Bo's mount needed no other urging, and they swung into a  canter. Far ahead the pack-animals showed with Roy driving them. The  cold wind was so keen in Helen's face that tears blurred her eyes and  froze her cheeks. And riding Ranger at that pace was like riding in  a rocking-chair. That ride, invigorating and exciting, seemed all too  short.    \"Oh, Nell, I don't care--what becomes of--me!\" exclaimed Bo,  breathlessly.    Her face was white and red, fresh as a rose, her eyes glanced darkly  blue, her hair blew out in bright, unruly strands. Helen knew she felt  some of the physical stimulation that had so roused Bo, and seemed so  irresistible, but somber thought was not deflected thereby.    It was clear daylight when Roy led off round a knoll from which patches  of scrubby trees--cedars, Dale called them--straggled up on the side of  the foot-hills.    \"They grow on the north slopes, where the snow stays longest,\" said  Dale.    They descended into a valley that looked shallow, but proved to be deep  and wide, and then began to climb another foot-hill. Upon surmounting it  Helen saw the rising sun, and so glorious a view confronted her that she  was unable to answer Bo's wild exclamations.    Bare, yellow, cedar-dotted slopes, apparently level, so gradual was the  ascent, stretched away to a dense ragged line of forest that rose  black over range after range, at last to fail near the bare summit of a  magnificent mountain, sunrise-flushed against the blue sky.    \"Oh, beautiful!\" cried Bo. \"But they ought to be called Black  Mountains.\"    \"Old Baldy, there, is white half the year,\" replied Dale.    \"Look back an' see what you say,\" suggested Roy.    The girls turned to gaze silently. Helen imagined she looked down upon  the whole wide world. How vastly different was the desert! Verily it  yawned away from her, red and gold near at hand, growing softly flushed  with purple far away, a barren void, borderless and immense, where  dark-green patches and black lines and upheaved ridges only served to  emphasize distance and space.    \"See thet little green spot,\" said Roy, pointing. \"Thet's Snowdrop. An'  the other one--'way to the right--thet's Show Down.\"    \"Where is Pine?\" queried Helen, eagerly.    \"Farther still, up over the foot-hills at the edge of the woods.\"    \"Then we're riding away from it.\"    \"Yes. If we'd gone straight for Pine thet gang could overtake us. Pine  is four days' ride. An' by takin' to the mountains Milt can hide his  tracks. An' when he's thrown Anson off the scent, then he'll circle down  to Pine.\"    \"Mr. Dale, do you think you'll get us there safely--and soon?\" asked  Helen, wistfully.    \"I won't promise soon, but I promise safe. An' I don't like bein' called  Mister,\" he replied.    \"Are we ever going to eat?\" inquired Bo, demurely.    At this query Roy Beeman turned with a laugh to look at Bo. Helen saw  his face fully in the light, and it was thin and hard, darkly bronzed,  with eyes like those of a hawk, and with square chin and lean jaws  showing scant, light beard.    \"We shore are,\" he replied. \"Soon as we reach the timber. Thet won't be  long.\"    \"Reckon we can rustle some an' then take a good rest,\" said Dale, and he  urged his horse into a jog-trot.    During a steady trot for a long hour, Helen's roving eyes were  everywhere, taking note of the things from near to far--the scant sage  that soon gave place to as scanty a grass, and the dark blots that  proved to be dwarf cedars, and the ravines opening out as if by magic  from what had appeared level ground, to wind away widening between gray  stone walls, and farther on, patches of lonely pine-trees, two and three  together, and then a straggling clump of yellow aspens, and up beyond  the fringed border of forest, growing nearer all the while, the black  sweeping benches rising to the noble dome of the dominant mountain of  the range.    No birds or animals were seen in that long ride up toward the timber,  which fact seemed strange to Helen. The air lost something of its cold,  cutting edge as the sun rose higher, and it gained sweeter tang of  forest-land. The first faint suggestion of that fragrance was utterly  new to Helen, yet it brought a vague sensation of familiarity and  with it an emotion as strange. It was as if she had smelled that keen,  pungent tang long ago, and her physical sense caught it before her  memory.    The yellow plain had only appeared to be level. Roy led down into a  shallow ravine, where a tiny stream meandered, and he followed this  around to the left, coming at length to a point"]]]
