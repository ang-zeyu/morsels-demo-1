He declared that his  genius had been exerted for his own country alone, and that his  invention should be kept a secret from all but German authorities. A  secret it would be to-day, except that accident and the fortunes of  war revealed the intricacies of the Zeppelin construction to both  France and England.    Santos-Dumont had the fire, enthusiasm, and resiliency of youth;  Zeppelin, upon whom age had begun to press when first he took up  aeronautics, had the dogged pertinacity of the Teuton. Both were  rich at the outset, but Zeppelin's capital melted away under the  demands of his experimental workshops, while the ancestral coffee  lands of the Brazilian never failed him.    Of the two Zeppelin had the more obstinacy, for he held to his plan  of a rigid dirigible balloon even in face of its virtual failure in  the supreme test of war. Santos-Dumont was the more alert  intellectually for he was still in the flood tide of successful  demonstration with his balloons when he saw and grasped the promise  of the airplane and shifted his activities to that new field in  which he won new laurels.    Zeppelin won perhaps the wider measure of immediate fame, but  whether enduring or not is yet to be determined. His airships  impressive, even majestic as they are, have failed to prove their  worth in war, and are yet to be fully tested in peace. That they  remain a unique type, one which no other individual nor any other  nation has sought to copy, cannot be attributed wholly to the  jealousy of possible rivals. If the monster ship, of rigid frame,  were indeed the ideal form of dirigible it would be imitated on  every hand. The inventions of the Wrights have been seized upon,  adapted, improved perhaps by half a hundred airplane designers of  every nation. But nobody has been imitating the Zeppelins.    [Illustration: _The Giant and the Pigmies._    _Painting by John E. Whiting._]    That, however, is a mere passing reflection. If the Zeppelin has not  done all in war that the sanguine German people expected of it,  nevertheless it is not yet to be pronounced an entire failure. And  even though a failure in war, the chief service for which its  stout-hearted inventor designed it, there is still hope that it may  ultimately prove better adapted to many ends of peace than the  airplanes which for the time seem to have outdone it.    Stout-hearted indeed the old _Luftgraaf_--\"Air Scout\"--as the  Germans call him, was. His was a Bismarckian nature, reminiscent of  the Iron Chancellor alike physically and mentally. In appearance he  recalls irresistibly the heroic figure of Bismarck, jack-booted and  cuirassed at the Congress of Vienna, painted by von Werner. Heir to  an old land-owning family, ennobled and entitled to bear the title  _Landgraf_, Count von Zeppelin was a type of the German aristocrat.  But for his title and aristocratic rank he could never have won his  long fight for recognition by the bureaucrats who control the German  army. In youth he was anti-Prussian in sentiment, and indeed some of  his most interesting army experiences were in service with the army  of South Germany against Prussia and her allied states. But all that  was forgotten in the national unity that followed the defeat of  France in 1872.    Before that, however, the young count--he was born in 1838--had  served with gallantry, if not distinction, in the Union Army in our  Civil War, had made a balloon ascension on the fighting line, had  swum in the Niagara River below the falls, being rescued with  difficulty, and together with two Russian officers and some Indian  guides had almost starved in trying to discover the source of the  Mississippi River--a spot which can now be visited without  undergoing more serious hardships than the upper berth in a Pullman  car.    It was at the siege of Paris that Zeppelin's mind first became  engaged with the problem of aerial navigation. From his post in the  besieging trenches he saw the almost daily ascent of balloons in  which mail was sent out, and persons who could pay the price sought  to escape from the beleaguered city. As a colonel of cavalry, he  had been employed mainly in scouting duty throughout the war. He was  impressed now with the conviction that those globes, rising silently  into the air, above the enemy's cannon shot and drifting away to  safety would be the ideal scouts could they but return with their  intelligence. Was there no way of guiding these ships in the air, as  a ship in the ocean is guided? The young soldier was hardly home  from the war when he began to study the problem. He studied it  indeed so much to the exclusion of other military matters that in  1890 the General Staff abruptly dismissed him from his command. They  saw no reason why a major-general of cavalry should be mooning  around with balloons and kites like a schoolboy.    The dismissal hurt him, but deterred him in no way from the purpose  of his life. Indeed the fruit of his many years' study of aeronautic  conditions was ready for the gathering at this very moment. On the  surface of the picturesque Lake Constance, on the border line  between Germany and Switzerland, floated a huge shed, open to the  water and more than five hundred feet long. In it, nearing  completion, floated the first Zeppelin airship.    In the long patient study which the Count had given to his problem  he had reached the fixed conclusion that the basis of a practical  dirigible balloon must be a rigid frame over which the envelope  should be stretched. His experiments were made at the same time as  those of Santos-Dumont, and he could not be ignorant of the measure  of success which the younger man was attaining with the non-rigid  balloon. But it was a fact that all the serious accidents which  befell Santos-Dumont and most of the threatened accidents which he  narrowly escaped were fundamentally caused by the lack of rigidity  in his balloon. The immediate cause may have been a leaky valve  permitting the gas to escape, or a faulty air-pump which made prompt  filling of the ballonet impossible. But the effect of these flaws  was to deprive the balloon of its rigidity, cause it to buckle,  throwing the cordage out of gear, shifting stresses and strains,  and resulting in ultimate breakdown.    Whether he observed the vicissitudes of his rival or not, Count  Zeppelin determined that the advantages of a rigid frame counted for  more than the disadvantage of its weight. Moreover that disadvantage  could be compensated for by increasing the size, and therefore the  lifting power of the balloon. In determining upon a rigid frame the  Count was not a pioneer even in his own country. While his  experiments were still under way, a rival, David Schwartz, who had  begun, without completing, an airship in St. Petersburg, secured in  some way aid from the German Government, which was at the moment  coldly repulsing Zeppelin. He planned and built an aluminum airship  but died before its completion. His widow continued the work amidst  constant opposition from the builders. The end was one of the many  tragedies of invention. Nobody but the widow ever believed the ship  would rise from its moorings. It was in charge of a man who had  never made an ascent. To his amazement and to the amazement of the  spectators the engine was hardly started when the ship mounted and  made headway against a stiff breeze. On the ground the spectators  shouted in wonder; the widow, overwhelmed by this reward for her  faith in her husband's genius, burst into tears of joy. But the  amateur pilot was no match for the situation. Affrighted to find  himself in mid-air, too dazed to know what to do, he pulled the  wrong levers and the machine crashed to earth. The pilot escaped,  but the airship which had taken four years to build was  irretrievably wrecked. The widow's hopes were blasted, and the way  was left free for the Count von Zeppelin.    Freed, though unwillingly, from the routine duties of his military  rank, Zeppelin thereafter devoted himself wholly to his airships. He  was fifty-three years old, adding one more to the long list of men  who found their real life's work after middle age. With him was  associated his brother Eberhard, the two forming a partnership in  aeronautical work as inseparable as that of Wilbur and Orville  Wright. Like Wilbur Wright, Eberhard von Zeppelin did not live to  witness the fullest fruition of the work, though he did see the  soundness of its principles thoroughly established and in practical  application. There is a picturesque story that when Eberhard lay on  his death-bed his brother, instead of watching by his side, took the  then completed airship from its hangar, and drove it over and around  the house that the last sounds to reach the ears of his faithful  ally might be the roar of the propellers in the air--the grand paean  of victory.    [Illustration: Photo by Press Illustrating Service.    _A French \"Sausage\"._]    Though Count von Zeppelin had begun his experiments in 1873 it was  not until 1890 that he actually began the construction of his first  airship. The intervening years had been spent in constructing and  testing models, in abstruse calculations of the resistance of the  air, the lifting power of hydrogen, the comparative rigidity and  weight of different woods and various metals, the power and weight  of the different makes of motors. In these studies he spent both his  time and his money lavishly, with the result that when he had built  a model on the lines of which he was willing to risk the  construction of an airship of operative size, his private fortune  was gone. It is the common lot of inventors. For a time the Count  suffered all the mortification and ignominy which the beggar, even  in a most worthy cause, must always"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3005"],[0,"Tom Swift and His Airship (#12)"],[1,"and Tom were giving a  final inspection to the craft in the big shed, Mr. Sharp exclaimed \"I  declare Tom, I believe you'll have to take a run into town.\"    \"What for?\"    \"Why to get that kit of special tools I ordered, which we might need to  make repairs. There are some long-handled wrenches, some spare levers,  and a couple of braces and bits. Harrison, the hardware dealer, ordered  them for me from New York, and they were to be ready this afternoon,  but I forgot them. Take an empty valise with you, and you can carry  them on your motorcycle. I'm sorry to have forgotten it, but--\"    \"That's all right, Mr. Sharp, I'd just as soon go as not. It will make  the time pass more quickly. I'll start right off.\"    An hour later, having received the tools, which made quite a bundle,  the lad put them in the valise, and started back toward home. As he  swung around the corner on which the bank was located--the same bank in  which Ned Newton worked--one of the valves on the motor-cycle began to  leak. Tom dismounted to adjust it, and had completed the work, being  about to ride on, when down the street came Andy Foger and Sam  Snedecker. They started at the sight of our hero.    \"There he is now!\" exclaimed Sam, as if he and the red-haired bully had  been speaking of the young inventor.    \"Let's lick him!\" proposed Andy. \"Now's our chance to get even for  throwing that paint and soot on us.\"    Tom heard their words. He was not afraid of both the lads, for, though  each one matched him in size and strength, Tom knew they were cowards.    \"If you're looking for anything I guess I can accommodate you,\" he  said, coolly.    \"Come on, Andy,\" urged Sam. But, somehow Andy hung back. Perhaps he  didn't like the way Tom squared off. The young inventor had let down  the rear brace of his motor-cycle, and was not obliged to hold it, so  he had both hands free.    \"We ought to lick him good and proper,\" growled the squint-eyed lad.    \"Well, why don't you?\" invited Tom.    He moved to one side, so as not to be hampered by his wheel. As he did  so he knocked from the handle bars the valise of tools. They fell with  a clatter and a thud to the pavement, and the satchel came open. It was  under a gas lamp, and the glitter of the long-handled wrenches and  other implements caught the eyes of Andy and his crony.    \"Huh! If we fought you, maybe you'd use some of them on us,\" sneered  Andy, glad of an excuse not to fight.    Tom quickly picked up his valise, shutting it, but he was aware of the  close scrutiny of the two vindictive lads.    \"I don't fight with such things,\" he said, somewhat annoyed, and he  hung the tools back on the handle bars.    \"What you doing around the bank at this hour?\" asked Sam, as if to  change the subject. \"First thing you know the watchman will order you  to move on. He might think you were a suspicious character.\"    \"The same to you,\" retorted Tom, \"but I'm going to ride on now, unless  you want to have a further argument with me.\"    \"You'd better be careful how you hang around a bank,\" added Andy. \"The  police are on the lookout here. There's been some mysterious men seen  about.\"    Tom did not care to go into that, and, seeing that the two bullies had  lost all desire to attack him, he put up the brace and mounted his  wheel.    \"Good-by,\" he called to Andy and Sam, as he rode off, the tools  rattling and jingling in the valise, but it was a sarcastic farewell,  and the two cronies did not reply.    \"I hope I didn't damage any of the tools when I let them fall that  time,\" mused the young inventor. \"My, the way Sam and Andy stared at  them it would make it seem as if I had a lot of weapons in the bag!  They certainly took good note of them.\"    The time was to come, and very shortly, when Andy's and Sam's  observation of the tools was to prove disastrous for our hero. As Tom  turned the corner he looked back, and saw, still standing in front of  the bank, the two cronies.          Chapter 11    The Red Cloud Departs      \"Well, dad, I wish you were going along with us,\" said Tom to his  father next morning. \"You don't know what you're going to miss. A fine  trip of several hundred miles through the air, seeing strange sights,  and experiencing new sensations.\"    \"Yes, I wish you would reconsider your determination, and accompany  us,\" added Mr. Damon. \"I would enjoy your company.\"    \"There's plenty of room. We can carry six persons with ease,\" said Mr.  Sharp.    Mr. Swift shook his head, and smiled.    \"I have too much work to do here at home,\" he replied. \"Perhaps I may  astonish you with something when you come back. I have nearly perfected  my latest invention.\"    There was no combating such a resolution as this, and Tom and the  others considered the decision of the aged inventor as final. The  airship was ready for the start, and every one had arisen earlier than  usual on this account. The bag of tools, for which Tom had gone to  town, were put in their proper place, the last of the supplies were  taken abroad, final tests were made of the various apparatus, the motor  had been given a trial spin, disconnected from the propellers, and then  the balloonist announced:    \"Well, Tom and Mr. Damon, you had better begin to think of starting.  We've had breakfast here, but there's no telling where we will eat  dinner.\"    \"Bless my soul! Don't you talk that way!\" exclaimed Mr. Damon. \"You  make me exceedingly nervous. Why shouldn't we know where we are going  to eat dinner?\"    \"Oh, I meant we couldn't tell over just what part of the United States  we would be when dinner time came,\" explained the aeronaut.    \"Oh, that's different. Bless my pocket knife, but I thought you meant  we might be dashed to pieces, and incapable of eating any dinner.\"    \"Hardly,\" remarked Mr. Sharp. \"The Red Cloud is not that kind of an  airship, I hope. But get aboard, if you please.\"    Tom and Mr. Damon entered the car. It was resting on the ground, on the  small wheels used to start the airship when the gas inflation method  was not used. In this case, however, it had been decided to rise in the  air by means of the powerful vapor, and not to use the wings and planes  until another time. Consequently the ship was swaying slightly, and  tugging at the restraining cables.    As Tom and Mr. Damon entered the cabin there drove into the Swift yard  a dilapidated wagon, drawn by a bony mule, and it did not need the  addition of a colored man's voice, calling: \"Whoa, dar, Boomerang!\" to  tell Tom that his friend Eradicate Sampson was on hand. As for  Eradicate, as soon as he saw the great airship, which he had never  before beheld fully rigged, all ready for a flight, his eyes became big  with wonder.    \"Is dat yo' flyin' machine, Mistah Swift?\" he asked.    \"That's it, Rad,\" answered Tom. \"Don't you want to come and take a ride  with us?\"    \"Me? Good land a' massy! No indeedy, Mistah Swift,\" and the  whitewasher, who had descended from his wagon, edged away, as if the  airship might suddenly put out a pair of hands and grab him. \"No  indeedy I doant! I come t' do a little whitewashin' an' when I do dat  I'se gwine on mah way. But dat's a pow'ful fine ship; it suah am!\"    \"Better come and try a flight, Rad,\" added Mr. Damon. \"I'll look after  you.\"    \"No, sah, an' I doan't take it kind ob yo' all t' tempt me dat way,  nuther,\" spoke Eradicate. But, when he saw that the craft was  stationary, he ventured to approach closer. Gingerly he put out one  hand and touched the framework of the wheels, just forward of the  cabin. The negro grasped the timber, and lifted it slightly. To his  astonishment the whole front of the airship tilted up, for it was about  ready to fly, and a child might have lifted it, so buoyant was it. But  Eradicate did not know this. Wonderingly he looked at the great bulk of  the ship, looming above him, then he glanced at his arm.  Once more,  noting that the attention of his friends was elsewhere, he lifted the  craft. Then he cried \"Look yeah, Mistah Swift! Look yeah!  No wonder  day calls me Sampson. I done lifted dis monstrousness airship wif one  hand, See, I kin do it! I kin do it!\"    Once more he raised the Red Cloud slightly, and a delighted grin, not  unmixed with a look of awe, spread over his honest countenance.    \"I suppose you'll give up whitewashing and join a circus as a strong  man, now,\" observed Mr. Sharp, with a wink at his companions.    \"Days what I will!\" announced Eradicate proudly. \"I neber knowed I was  dat strong, but ob course I allers knowed I had some muscle. Golly, I  must hab growed strong ober night! Now, Boomerang, yo' suah has got t'  look out fo' yo' sef. No mo' ob yo' cuttin' up capers, or I'll jest  lift you up, an' sot yo' down on yo' back, I suah will,\" and the negro  feeling of his biceps walked over to where the mule stood, with its  eyes closed.    \"I guess you can cast off, Tom,\" called Mr. Sharp, as he entered the  car, having seen that everything was all right. \"We'll not go up very  far at first, until Mr. Damon gets used to the thin air.\"    \"Bless my soul, I believe I'm getting nervous,\" announced the eccentric  man. \"Bless my liver, but I hope nothing happens.\"    \"Nothing will happen,\" Mr. Sharp assured him. \"Just keep calm, when it  feels as if the bottom was dropping out of everything and you'll soon  get over it. Are you casting off those ropes, Tom? Is all clear?\"    \"All but the bow and stern lines.\"    \"You attend to the bow line, and I'll go to the stern,\" and, going over  to the gas generator, Mr. Sharp started it so as to force more vapor  into the red aluminum container. This had the effect of rendering the  airship more buoyant, and it tugged and strained harder than ever at  the ropes.    \"Good-by, Tom,\" called Mr. Swift, reaching up to shake hands with his  son. \"Drop me a line when you get a chance.\"    \"Oh, Tom, do be careful,\" implored Mrs. Baggert, her kind face showing  her anxiety. \"May I kiss you good-by?\"    "]]]
