This over pressure, which is the cause of so many  evils and so much of human shame, is an abnormal, not a natural,  condition. It is primarily due to spiritual blindness, to blindness  regarding the spiritual man, and ignorance even of his existence; for  by this blind ignorance are closed the channels through which, were  they open, the creative force could flow into the body of the spiritual  man, there building up an immortal vesture. There is no cure for  blindness, with its consequent over-pressure and attendant misery and  shame, but spiritual vision, spiritual aspiration, sacrifice, the new birth  from above. There is no other way to lighten the burden, to lift the  misery and shame from human life. Therefore, let us follow after  sacrifice and aspiration, let us seek the light. In this way only shall we  gain that insight into the order of the bodily powers, and that mastery  of them, which this Sutra implies.    30. By perfectly concentrated Meditation on the centre of force in the  well of the throat, there comes the cessation of hunger and thirst.    We are continuing the study of the bodily powers and centres of force  in their relation to the powers and forces of the spiritual man. We have  already considered the dominant power of physical life, the creative  power which secures the continuance of physical life; and, further, the  manner in which, through aspiration and sacrifice, it is gradually raised  and set to the work of upbuilding the body of the spiritual man. We  come now to the dominant psychic force, the power which manifests  itself in speech, and in virtue of which the voice may carry so much of  the personal magnetism, endowing the orator with a tongue of fire,  magical in its power to arouse and rule the emotions of his hearers.  This emotional power, this distinctively psychical force, is the cause  of \"hunger and thirst,\" the psychical hunger and thirst for sensations,  which is the source of our two-sided life of emotionalism, with its  hopes and fears, its expectations and memories, its desires and hates.  The source of this psychical power, or, perhaps we should say, its  centre of activity in the physical body is said to be in the cavity of the  throat. Thus, in the Taittiriya Upanishad it is written: \"There is this  shining ether in the inner being. Therein is the spiritual man, formed  through thought, immortal, golden. Inward, in the palate, the organ  that hangs down like a nipple,-this is the womb of Indra. And there,  where the dividing of the hair turns, extending upward to the crown  of the head.\"    Indra is the name given to the creative power of which we have  spoken, and which, we are told, resides in \"the organ which hangs  down like a nipple, inward, in the palate.\"    31. By perfectly concentrated Meditation on the centre of force in the  channel called the \"tortoise-formed,\" comes steadfastness.    We are concerned now with the centre of nervous or psychical force  below the cavity of the throat, in the chest, in which is felt the  sensation of fear; the centre, the disturbance of which sets the heart  beating miserably with dread, or which produces that sense of terror  through which the heart is said to stand still.    When the truth concerning fear is thoroughly mastered, through  spiritual insight into the immortal, fearless life, then this force is  perfectly controlled; there is no more fear, just as, through the control  of the psychic power which works through the nerve-centre in the  throat, there comes a cessation of \"hunger and thirst.\" Thereafter,  these forces, or their spiritual prototypes, are turned to the building of  the spiritual man.    Always, it must be remembered, the victory is first a spiritual one;  only later does it bring control of the bodily powers.    32. Through perfectly concentrated Meditation on the light in the head  comes the vision of the Masters who have attained.    The tradition is, that there is a certain centre of force in the head,  perhaps the \"pineal gland,\" which some of our Western philosophers  have supposed to be the dwelling of the soul, a centre which is, as it  were, the door way between the natural and the spiritual man. It is the  seat of that better and wiser consciousness behind the outward  looking consciousness in the forward part of the head; that better and  wiser consciousness of \"the back of the mind,\" which views spiritual  things, and seeks to impress the spiritual view on the outward looking  consciousness in the forward part of the head. It is the spiritual man  seeking to guide the natural man, seeking to bring the natural man to  concern himself with the things of his immortality. This is suggested  in the words of the Upanishad already quoted: \"There, where the  dividing of the hair turns, extending upward to the crown of the  head\"; all of which may sound very fantastical, until one comes to  understand it.    It is said that when this power is fully awakened, it brings a vision of  the great Companions of the spiritual man, those who have already  attained, crossing over to the further shore of the sea of death and  rebirth. Perhaps it is to this divine sight that the Master alluded, who  is reported to have said: \"I counsel you to buy of me eye-salve, that  you may see.\" It is of this same vision of the great Companions, the  children of light, that a seer wrote:         \"Though inland far we be,       Our souls have sight of that immortal sea       Which brought us hither,       Can in a moment travel thither,       And see the Children sport upon the shore       And hear the mighty waters rolling evermore.\"    33. Or through the divining power of tuition he knows all things.    This is really the supplement, the spiritual side, of the Sutra just  translated. Step by step, as the better consciousness, the spiritual  view, gains force in the back of the mind, so, in the same measure, the  spiritual man is gaining the power to see: learning to open the spiritual  eyes. When the eyes are fully opened, the spiritual man beholds the  great Companions standing about him; he has begun to \"know all  things.\"    This divining power of intuition is the power which lies above and  behind the so-called rational mind; the rational mind formulates a  question and lays it before the intuition, which gives a real answer,  often immediately distorted by the rational mind, yet always  embodying a kernel of truth. It is by this process, through which the  rational mind brings questions to the intuition for solution, that the  truths of science are reached, the flashes of discovery and genius. But  this higher power need not work in subordination to the so-called  rational mind, it may act directly, as full illumination, \"the vision and  the faculty divine.\"    34 By perfectly concentrated Meditation on the heart, the interior  being, comes the knowledge of consciousness.    The heart here seems to mean, as it so often does in the Upanishads,  the interior, spiritual nature, the consciousness of the spiritual man,  which is related to the heart, and to the wisdom of the heart. By  steadily seeking after, and finding, the consciousness of the spiritual  man, by coming to consciousness as the spiritual man, a perfect  knowledge of consciousness will be attained. For the consciousness  of the spiritual man has this divine quality: while being and remaining  a truly individual consciousness, it at the same time flows over, as it  were, and blends with the Divine Consciousness above and about it,  the consciousness of the great Companions; and by showing itself to  be one with the Divine Consciousness, it reveals the nature of all  consciousness, the secret that all consciousness is One and Divine.    35. The personal self seeks to feast on life, through a failure to  perceive the distinction between the personal self and the spiritual  man. All personal experience really exists for the sake of another:  namely, the spiritual man. By perfectly concentrated Meditation on  experience for the sake of the Self, comes a knowledge of the spiritual  man.    The divine ray of the Higher Self, which is eternal, impersonal and  abstract, descends into life, and forms a personality, which, through  the stress and storm of life, is hammered into a definite and concrete  self-conscious individuality. The problem is, to blend these two  powers, taking the eternal and spiritual being of the first, and blending  with it, transferring into it, the self-conscious individuality of the  second; and thus bringing to life a third being, the spiritual man, who  is heir to the immortality of his father, the Higher Self, and yet has the  self-conscious, concrete individuality of his other parent, the personal  self. This is the true immaculate conception, the new birth from above,  \"conceived of the Holy Spirit.\" Of this new birth it is said: \"that which  is born of the Spirit is spirit: ye must be born again.\"    Rightly understood, therefore, the whole life of the personal man is for  another, not for himself. He exists only to render his very life and all  his experience for the building up of the spiritual man. Only through  failure to see this, does he seek enjoyment for himself, seek to secure  the feasts of life for himself; not understanding that he must live for  the other, live sacrificially, offering both feasts and his very being on  the altar; giving himself as a contribution for the building of the  spiritual man. When he does understand this, and lives for the Higher  Self, setting his heart and thought on the Higher Self, then his sacrifice  bears divine fruit, the spiritual man is built up, consciousness awakes  in him, and he comes fully into"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25266"],[0,"Bell's Cathedrals: The Cathedral Church of Saint Paul (#12)"],[1," was situated, is uncertain.    Of all these various buildings which surrounded the cathedral and  added to its interest, the curious, by going to the south side of the  nave, may discern some traces of the old Lesser Cloisters and Chapter  House.

PAUL'S (1666-1710).      Christopher Wren was the most distinguished member of a distinguished  family. His father's elder brother, Matthew, was fellow and senior  treasurer of Pembroke College, Cambridge, when James I. visited that  university in 1611, and won the favour of his sovereign by the ability  with which he acquitted himself in the \"Philosophy Act.\" After serving  as chaplain to Charles in the journey to Spain, he received, amongst  other preferments, the Mastership of Pembroke and the Deaneries of  Windsor and Wolverhampton, and then was made, in quick succession,  Bishop of Hereford, Norwich, and Ely. We shall see that the Cathedral  of Ely exercised an influence over his nephew in designing the Dome of  St. Paul's. Matthew survived the Commonwealth after a lengthy  imprisonment without trial, and returned to Ely after the Restoration.  His younger brother Christopher was chaplain to Lancelot Andrewes,  Bishop of Winchester, who preferred him to the Rectory of East Knoyle,  Wilts.[52] Charles I. made him chaplain in ordinary; and when Matthew  was preferred to Norwich, his brother succeeded him in his two  deaneries. The Dean, like his brother, was a learned scholar, and to  him posterity is indebted for the preservation of many valuable  records at Windsor during the troubled times. He married Mary,  heiress of Robert Cox, of Founthill, in Wiltshire, and died in poverty  and deprived of his benefices before the Restoration. The only  surviving son of the marriage, Christopher, was born at East Knoyle,  October 20, 1632. Like others who have eventually lived to an extreme  old age, he was delicate during childhood, and, instead of being sent  early to school, received his primary instruction privately. Like his  father before him, he displayed great aptitude for mathematics, both  pure and applied, and was fortunate enough to have a capable teacher  in Dr. William Holder, the husband of a sister, in whose house his  father took refuge and died after his ejection from Windsor. At the  age of thirteen he was sent for a short period to Westminster, and  about the same time invented a new astronomical instrument. The next  year he was admitted as a gentleman commoner at Wadham College,  Oxford. Both the Warden, Dr. John Wilkins, and the Savilian Professor  of Astronomy, Dr. Seth Ward, observed his early promise, and gave him  every encouragement in the pursuit of his favourite studies, and he  continued to design ingenious instruments and models, Dr. Charles  Scarborough, a surgeon of note, making use of his talents in preparing  pasteboard models for his anatomical lectures.[53] His intellectual  precocity can only be compared to that of John Stuart Mill, and with  this difference, that whereas Mill was forced by his father like a  plant under glass, Wren's studies were spontaneous and voluntary.    Graduating in 1650, he was elected three years later, after taking his  Master's degree, to a Fellowship of All Souls, the next year began his  friendship with John Evelyn, and he was subsequently chosen Professor  of Astronomy at Gresham College[54] and Savilian Professor at Oxford.  Isaac Newton in the \"Principia\" cites him as an authority on  mathematics, and, had he never turned his attention to architecture,  he would still have taken high rank in other ways. By 1663, as appears  by a letter of Thomas Sprat, afterwards Bishop of Rochester, he was  looked upon as the fittest man to restore the dilapidated St.  Paul's, and was about the same time asked to go to Tangiers to direct  the extensive fortifications and harbour projected there. He refused  the offer of Tangiers on the plea of health, \"and humbly prayed his  Majesty to allow of his Excuse, and to command his duty in England.\"  Although this post was to be accompanied by a reversionary grant of  the Surveyor Generalship of the Royal Works, one may well ask the  question, who, had he accepted it, would have rebuilt St. Paul's?[55]       [Illustration: ELEVATION AND SECTION OF WREN'S REJECTED DESIGN     FOR ST. PAUL'S.     _From his drawings in All Souls' College, Oxford, as reproduced     in facsimile in Blomfield's \"Renaissance Architecture in     England.\"_]    We now begin to find him devoting what Sprat most truly called \"that  great genius of yours\" to architecture. He examined carefully the  leading churches of England and of some parts of the Continent.[56] He  went to Paris the year of the Plague, and it is characteristic of the  taste of his time that no mediaeval cathedral passed on the way is  mentioned. At Paris, under the auspices of Mazarin, many architects  and artists were assembled. \"I hope I shall give you a very good  Account of all the best Artists in France,\" he wrote to a friend. \"My  business now is to pry into Trades and Arts. I put myself into all  shapes to humour them; 'tis a comedy to me, and tho' sometimes  expenceful, I am loth yet to leave it.\" He mentions not only leading  men like Colbert, but more than twenty architects, painters, and  designers he met, and above all Bernini, the architect of the Louvre.  \"Bernini's designs of the Louvre I would have given my skin for; but  the old reserved Italian gave me but a five Minutes View; it was five  little designs on Paper, for which he had received as many thousand  Pistoles: I had only time to copy it in my Fancy and Memory.\" In after  years, when his enthusiasm had been tempered by a more mature  judgment, this eulogium would have been materially qualified. We may  add here that he was in course of time knighted, and became President  of the Royal Society.       [Illustration: SIR CHRISTOPHER WREN.     _From the engraving in Elmes' Memoirs of Sir C. Wren, after the     portrait by Kneller at the Royal Society's rooms._]    Such was the man to whom not merely the king and his advisers, but  public opinion, turned to repair the ravages of the Fire, and in  particular to rebuild St. Paul's. It was the Surveyor General, Sir  John Denham, who recommended Wren as his successor, and the death of  Denham in March, 1668, gave this recommendation full effect. One of  Wren's many disappointments was that the opportunity was missed of  laying out afresh the whole City from Temple Bar to Tower Hill, and  from Moorfields to the river. His inventive genius projected broad  streets, generally rectangular, with piazzas, each the meeting-point  of eight thoroughfares, and quays and terraces along the river bank.  He calculated that by obliterating the numerous churchyards and laying  out healthier cemeteries in the suburbs, no owner would lose a square  foot of ground, and that, although they would not find their property  exactly on the same site, every building would be replaced, with the  immense compensation of an excellent situation in the finest and  healthiest city in the whole world. By this plan St. Paul's would have  directly faced a long and broad street running west and passing  through the present Law Courts, with St. Dunstan's Church in the  centre beyond the Fleet, and the narrow Strand joining from the west  at Temple Bar. At Ludgate, three hundred yards west of the cathedral,  this avenue of a width of some thirty yards began to open out until,  opposite the west front, it had increased to a breadth of a hundred  yards, leaving ample room for a piazza. Here an acute bifurcation was  formed, the northern street leading to the Exchange; the southern, a  broader and a nobler Cannon Street, with St. Paul's between. This  scheme, as laid"]]]
