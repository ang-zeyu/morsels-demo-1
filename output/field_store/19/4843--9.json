Daniel  Touchett, to his perception, was a man of genius, and though he himself  had no aptitude for the banking mystery he made a point of learning  enough of it to measure the great figure his father had played. It was  not this, however, he mainly relished; it was the fine ivory surface,  polished as by the English air, that the old man had opposed to  possibilities of penetration. Daniel Touchett had been neither at  Harvard nor at Oxford, and it was his own fault if he had placed in his  son's hands the key to modern criticism. Ralph, whose head was full  of ideas which his father had never guessed, had a high esteem for the  latter's originality. Americans, rightly or wrongly, are commended for  the ease with which they adapt themselves to foreign conditions; but Mr.  Touchett had made of the very limits of his pliancy half the ground  of his general success. He had retained in their freshness most of  his marks of primary pressure; his tone, as his son always noted with  pleasure, was that of the more luxuriant parts of New England. At the  end of his life he had become, on his own ground, as mellow as he  was rich; he combined consummate shrewdness with the disposition  superficially to fraternise, and his \"social position,\" on which he had  never wasted a care, had the firm perfection of an unthumbed fruit. It  was perhaps his want of imagination and of what is called the historic  consciousness; but to many of the impressions usually made by English  life upon the cultivated stranger his sense was completely closed. There  were certain differences he had never perceived, certain habits he had  never formed, certain obscurities he had never sounded. As regards these  latter, on the day he had sounded them his son would have thought less  well of him.    Ralph, on leaving Oxford, had spent a couple of years in travelling;  after which he had found himself perched on a high stool in his father's  bank. The responsibility and honour of such positions is not, I  believe, measured by the height of the stool, which depends upon other  considerations: Ralph, indeed, who had very long legs, was fond of  standing, and even of walking about, at his work. To this exercise,  however, he was obliged to devote but a limited period, for at the end  of some eighteen months he had become aware of his being seriously out  of health. He had caught a violent cold, which fixed itself on his lungs  and threw them into dire confusion. He had to give up work and apply,  to the letter, the sorry injunction to take care of himself. At first he  slighted the task; it appeared to him it was not himself in the least  he was taking care of, but an uninteresting and uninterested person  with whom he had nothing in common. This person, however, improved  on acquaintance, and Ralph grew at last to have a certain grudging  tolerance, even an undemonstrative respect, for him. Misfortune makes  strange bedfellows, and our young man, feeling that he had something  at stake in the matter--it usually struck him as his reputation for  ordinary wit--devoted to his graceless charge an amount of attention of  which note was duly taken and which had at least the effect of keeping  the poor fellow alive. One of his lungs began to heal, the other  promised to follow its example, and he was assured he might outweather  a dozen winters if he would betake himself to those climates in which  consumptives chiefly congregate. As he had grown extremely fond of  London, he cursed the flatness of exile: but at the same time that he  cursed he conformed, and gradually, when he found his sensitive organ  grateful even for grim favours, he conferred them with a lighter hand.  He wintered abroad, as the phrase is; basked in the sun, stopped at home  when the wind blew, went to bed when it rained, and once or twice, when  it had snowed overnight, almost never got up again.    A secret hoard of indifference--like a thick cake a fond old nurse might  have slipped into his first school outfit--came to his aid and helped to  reconcile him to sacrifice; since at the best he was too ill for aught  but that arduous game. As he said to himself, there was really nothing  he had wanted very much to do, so that he had at least not renounced the  field of valour. At present, however, the fragrance of forbidden fruit  seemed occasionally to float past him and remind him that the finest of  pleasures is the rush of action. Living as he now lived was like reading  a good book in a poor translation--a meagre entertainment for a young  man who felt that he might have been an excellent linguist. He had good  winters and poor winters, and while the former lasted he was sometimes  the sport of a vision of virtual recovery. But this vision was dispelled  some three years before the occurrence of the incidents with which this  history opens: he had on that occasion remained later than usual in  England and had been overtaken by bad weather before reaching Algiers.  He arrived more dead than alive and lay there for several weeks between  life and death. His convalescence was a miracle, but the first use he  made of it was to assure himself that such miracles happen but once. He  said to himself that his hour was in sight and that it behoved him to  keep his eyes upon it, yet that it was also open to him to spend the  interval as agreeably as might be consistent with such a preoccupation.  With the prospect of losing them the simple use of his faculties became  an exquisite pleasure; it seemed to him the joys of contemplation had  never been sounded. He was far from the time when he had found it hard  that he should be obliged to give up the idea of distinguishing himself;  an idea none the less importunate for being vague and none the less  delightful for having had to struggle in the same breast with bursts  of inspiring self-criticism. His friends at present judged him more  cheerful, and attributed it to a theory, over which they shook their  heads knowingly, that he would recover his health. His serenity was but  the array of wild flowers niched in his ruin.    It was very probably this sweet-tasting property of the observed thing  in itself that was mainly concerned in Ralph's quickly-stirred interest  in the advent of a young lady who was evidently not insipid. If he was  consideringly disposed, something told him, here was occupation enough  for a succession of days. It may be added, in summary fashion, that the  imagination of loving--as distinguished from that of being loved--had  still a place in his reduced sketch. He had only forbidden himself the  riot of expression. However, he shouldn't inspire his cousin with a  passion, nor would she be able, even should she try, to help him to one.  \"And now tell me about the young lady,\" he said to his mother. \"What do  you mean to do with her?\"    Mrs. Touchett was prompt. \"I mean to ask your father to invite her to  stay three or four weeks at Gardencourt.\"    \"You needn't stand on any such ceremony as that,\" said Ralph. \"My father  will ask her as a matter of course.\"    \"I don't know about that. She's my niece; she's not his.\"    \"Good Lord, dear mother; what a sense of property! That's all the more  reason for his asking her. But after that--I mean after three months  (for its absurd asking the poor girl to remain but for three or four  paltry weeks)--what do you mean to do with her?\"    \"I mean to take her to Paris. I mean to get her clothing.\"    \"Ah yes, that's of course. But independently of that?\"    \"I shall invite her to spend the autumn with me in Florence.\"    \"You don't rise above detail, dear mother,\" said Ralph. \"I should like  to know what you mean to do with her in a general way.\"    \"My duty!\" Mrs. Touchett declared. \"I suppose you pity her very much,\"  she added.    \"No, I don't think I pity her. She doesn't strike me as inviting  compassion. I think I envy her. Before being sure, however, give me a  hint of where you see your duty.\"    \"In showing her four European countries--I shall leave her the choice of  two of them--and in giving her the opportunity of perfecting herself in  French, which she already knows very well.\"    Ralph frowned a little. \"That sounds rather dry--even allowing her the  choice of two of the countries.\"    \"If it's dry,\" said his mother with a laugh, \"you can leave Isabel alone  to water it! She is as good as a summer rain, any day.\"    \"Do you mean she's a gifted being?\"    \"I don't know whether she's a gifted being, but she's a clever  girl--with a strong will and a high temper. She has no idea of being  bored.\"    \"I can imagine that,\" said Ralph; and then he added abruptly: \"How do  you two get on?\"    \"Do you mean by that that I'm a bore? I don't think she finds me one.  Some girls might, I know; but Isabel's too clever for that. I think I  greatly amuse her. We get on because I understand her, I know the sort  of girl she is. She's very frank, and I'm very frank: we know just what  to expect of each other.\"    \"Ah, dear mother,\" Ralph exclaimed, \"one always knows what to expect  of you! You've never surprised me but once, and that's to-day--in  presenting me with a pretty cousin whose existence I had never  suspected.\"    \"Do you think her so very pretty?\"    \"Very pretty indeed; but I don't insist upon that. It's her general  air of being some one in particular that strikes me. Who is this rare  creature, and what is she? Where did you find her, and how did you make  her acquaintance?\"    \"I found her in an old house at Albany, sitting in a dreary room on a  rainy day, reading a heavy book and boring herself to death. She didn't  know she was bored, but when I left her no doubt of it she seemed very  grateful for the service. You may say I shouldn't have enlightened he--I  should have let her alone.

The chief  impression produced on Isabel's spirit by this criticism was that the  passion of love separated its victim terribly from every one but the  loved object. She felt herself disjoined from every one she had ever  known before--from her two sisters, who wrote to express a dutiful hope  that she would be happy, and a surprise, somewhat more vague, at her  not having chosen a consort who was the hero of a richer accumulation of  anecdote; from Henrietta, who, she was sure, would come out, too late,  on purpose to remonstrate; from Lord Warburton, who would certainly  console himself, and from Caspar Goodwood, who perhaps would not; from  her aunt, who had cold, shallow ideas about marriage, for which she  was not sorry to display her contempt; and from Ralph, whose talk  about having great views for her was surely but a whimsical cover for  a personal disappointment. Ralph apparently wished her not to marry  at all--that was what it really meant--because he was amused with the  spectacle of her adventures as a single woman. His disappointment made  him say angry things about the man she had preferred even to him: Isabel  flattered herself that she believed Ralph had been angry. It was the  more easy for her to believe this because, as I say, she had now little  free or unemployed emotion for minor needs, and accepted as an incident,  in fact quite as an ornament, of her lot the idea that to prefer Gilbert  Osmond as she preferred him was perforce to break all other ties. She  tasted of the sweets of this preference, and they made her conscious,  almost with awe, of the invidious and remorseless tide of the charmed  and possessed condition, great as was the traditional honour and imputed  virtue of being in love. It was the tragic part of happiness; one's  right was always made of the wrong of some one else.    The elation of success, which surely now flamed high in Osmond, emitted  meanwhile very little smoke for so brilliant a blaze. Contentment, on  his part, took no vulgar form; excitement, in the most self-conscious of  men, was a kind of ecstasy of self-control. This disposition, however,  made him an admirable lover; it gave him a constant view of the smitten  and dedicated state. He never forgot himself, as I say; and so he  never forgot to be graceful and tender, to wear the appearance--which  presented indeed no difficulty--of stirred senses and deep intentions.  He was immensely pleased with his young lady; Madame Merle had made him  a present of incalculable value. What could be a finer thing to live  with than a high spirit attuned to softness? For would not the softness  be all for one's self, and the strenuousness for society, which admired  the air of superiority? What could be a happier gift in a companion than  a quick, fanciful mind which saved one repetitions and reflected one's  thought on a polished, elegant surface? Osmond hated to see his thought  reproduced literally--that made it look stale and stupid; he preferred  it to be freshened in the reproduction even as \"words\" by music. His  egotism had never taken the crude form of desiring a dull wife; this  lady's intelligence was to be a silver plate, not an earthen one--a  plate that he might heap up with ripe fruits, to which it would give  a decorative value, so that talk might become for him a sort of served  dessert. He found the silver quality in this perfection in Isabel; he  could tap her imagination with his knuckle and make it ring. He knew  perfectly, though he had not been told, that their union enjoyed little  favour with the girl's relations; but he had always treated her so  completely as an independent person that it hardly seemed necessary  to express regret for the attitude of her family. Nevertheless, one  morning, he made an abrupt allusion to it. \"It's the difference in our  fortune they don't like,\" he said. \"They think I'm in love with your  money.\"    \"Are you speaking of my aunt--of my cousin?\" Isabel asked. \"How do you  know what they think?\"    \"You've not told me they're pleased, and when I wrote to Mrs. Touchett  the other day she never answered my note. If they had been delighted I  should have had some sign of it, and the fact of my being poor and you  rich is the most obvious explanation of their reserve. But of course  when a poor man marries a rich girl he must be prepared for imputations.  I don't mind them; I only care for one thing--for your not having  the shadow of a doubt. I don't care what people of whom I ask nothing  think--I'm not even capable perhaps of wanting to know. I've never so  concerned myself, God forgive me, and why should I begin to-day, when I  have taken to myself a compensation for everything? I won't pretend  I'm sorry you're rich; I'm delighted. I delight in everything that's  yours--whether it be money or virtue. Money's a horrid thing to follow,  but a charming thing to meet. It seems to me, however, that I've  sufficiently proved the limits of my itch for it: I never in my life  tried to earn a penny, and I ought to be less subject to suspicion than  most of the people one sees grubbing and grabbing. I suppose it's their  business to suspect--that of your family; it's proper on the whole they  should. They'll like me better some day; so will you, for that matter.  Meanwhile my business is not to make myself bad blood, but simply to  be thankful for life and love.\" \"It has made me better, loving you,\" he  said on another occasion; \"it has made me wiser and easier and--I won't  pretend to deny--brighter and nicer and even stronger. I used to want  a great many things before and to be angry I didn't have them.  Theoretically I was satisfied, as I once told you. I flattered myself  I had limited my wants. But I was subject to irritation; I used to  have morbid, sterile, hateful fits of hunger, of desire. Now I'm really  satisfied, because I can't think of anything better. It's just as when  one has been trying to spell out a book in the twilight and suddenly the  lamp comes in. I had been putting out my eyes over the book of life and  finding nothing to reward me for my pains; but now that I can read it  properly I see it's a delightful story. My dear girl, I can't tell you  how life seems to stretch there before us--what a long summer afternoon  awaits us. It's the latter half of an Italian day--with a golden haze,  and the shadows just lengthening, and that divine delicacy in the light,  the air, the landscape, which I have loved all my life and which you  love to-day. Upon my honour, I don't see why we shouldn't get on. We've  got what we like--to say nothing of having each other. We've the faculty  of admiration and several capital convictions. We're not stupid, we're  not mean, we're not under bonds to any kind of ignorance or dreariness.  You're remarkably fresh, and I'm remarkably well-seasoned. We've my poor  child to amuse us; we'll try and make up some little life for her. It's  all soft and mellow--it has the Italian colouring.\"    They made a good many plans, but they left themselves also a good deal  of latitude; it was a matter of course, however, that they should live  for the present in Italy. It was in Italy that they had met, Italy had  been a party to their first impressions of each other, and Italy  should be a party to their happiness. Osmond had the attachment of old  acquaintance and Isabel the stimulus of new, which seemed to assure her  a future at a high level of consciousness of the beautiful. The desire  for unlimited expansion had been succeeded in her soul by the sense  that life was vacant without some private duty that might gather one's  energies to a point. She had told Ralph she had \"seen life\" in a year  or two and that she was already tired, not of the act of living, but of  that of observing. What had become of all her ardours, her aspirations,  her theories, her high estimate of her independence and her incipient  conviction that she should never marry? These things had been absorbed  in a more primitive need--a need the answer to which brushed away  numberless questions, yet gratified infinite desires. It simplified the  situation at a stroke, it came down from above like the light of the  stars, and it needed no explanation. There was explanation enough in the  fact that he was her lover, her own, and that she should be able to be  of use to him. She could surrender to him with a kind of humility, she  could marry him with a kind of pride; she was not only taking, she was  giving.    He brought Pansy with him two or three times to the Cascine--Pansy who  was very little taller than a year before, and not much older. That she  would always be a child was the conviction expressed by her father, who  held her by the hand when she was in her sixteenth year and told her to  go and play while he sat down a little with the pretty lady. Pansy wore  a short dress and a long coat; her hat always seemed too big for her.  She found pleasure in walking off, with quick, short steps, to the  end of the alley, and then in walking back with a smile that seemed an  appeal for approbation. Isabel approved in abundance, and the abundance  had the personal touch that the child's affectionate nature craved.  She watched her indications as if for herself also much depended on  them--Pansy already so represented part of the service she could render,  part of the responsibility she could face. Her father took so the  childish view of her that he had not yet explained to her the new  relation in which he stood to the elegant Miss Archer. \"She doesn't  know,\" he said to Isabel; \"she doesn't guess; she thinks it perfectly  natural that you and I should come and walk here together simply as good  friends. There seems to me something enchantingly innocent in that; it's  the way I like her to be. No, I'm not a"]]]
