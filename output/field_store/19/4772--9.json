(#12)"],[1,"length--there, only, does he become quite  good, great and perfect, perhaps there alone.--Wagner is one who has  suffered much--and this elevates him above other musicians.--I admire Wagner  wherever he sets _himself_ to music--          Wherein I Raise Objections.      With all this I do not wish to imply that I regard this music as healthy,  and least of all in those places where it speaks of Wagner himself. My  objections to Wagner's music are physiological objections. Why should I  therefore begin by clothing them in aesthetic formulae? AEsthetic is indeed  nothing more than applied physiology--The fact I bring forward, my \"_petit  fait vrai_,\" is that I can no longer breathe with ease when this music  begins to have its effect upon me; that my foot immediately begins to feel  indignant at it and rebels: for what it needs is time, dance, march; even  the young German Kaiser could not march to Wagner's Imperial March,--what  my foot demands in the first place from music is that ecstasy which lies  in good walking, stepping and dancing. But do not my stomach, my heart, my  circulation also protest? Are not my intestines also troubled? And do I  not become hoarse unawares? {~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} in order to listen to Wagner I require  Geraudel's Pastilles.{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} And then I ask myself, what is it that my whole  body must have from music in general? for there is no such thing as a  soul.{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} I believe it must have relief: as if all animal functions were  accelerated by means of light, bold, unfettered, self-reliant rhythms, as  if brazen and leaden life could lose its weight by means of delicate and  smooth melodies. My melancholy would fain rest its head in the haunts and  abysses of perfection; for this reason I need music. But Wagner makes one  ill--What do I care about the theatre? What do I care about the spasms of  its moral ecstasies in which the mob--and who is not the mob  to-day?--rejoices? What do I care about the whole pantomimic hocus-pocus of  the actor? You are beginning to see that I am essentially anti-theatrical  at heart. For the stage, this mob art _par excellence_, my soul has that  deepest scorn felt by every artist to-day. With a stage success a man  sinks to such an extent in my esteem as to drop out of sight; failure in  this quarter makes me prick my ears, makes me begin to pay attention. But  this was not so with Wagner, next to the Wagner who created the most  unique music that has ever existed there was the Wagner who was  essentially a man of the stage, an actor, the most enthusiastic mimomaniac  that has perhaps existed on earth, even as a musician. And let it be said  _en passant_ that if Wagner's theory was \"drama is the object, music is  only a means\"--his practice was from beginning to end \"the attitude is the  end, drama and even music can never be anything else than means.\" Music as  the manner of accentuating, of strengthening, and deepening dramatic poses  and all things which please the senses of the actor; and Wagnerian drama  only an opportunity for a host of interesting attitudes!--Alongside of all  other instincts he had the dictatorial instinct of a great actor in  everything and, as I have already said, as a musician also.--On one  occasion, and not without trouble, I made this clear to a Wagnerite _pur  sang_,--clearness and a Wagnerite! I won't say another word. There were  reasons for adding; \"For heaven's sake, be a little more true unto  yourself! We are not in Bayreuth now. In Bayreuth people are only upright  in the mass; the individual lies, he even lies to himself. One leaves  oneself at home when one goes to Bayreuth, one gives up all right to one's  own tongue and choice, to one's own taste and even to one's own courage,  one knows these things no longer as one is wont to have them and practise  them before God and the world and between one's own four walls. In the  theatre no one brings the finest senses of his art with him, and least of  all the artist who works for the theatre,--for here loneliness is lacking;  everything perfect does not suffer a witness.{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} In the theatre one becomes  mob, herd, woman, Pharisee, electing cattle, patron, idiot--Wagnerite:  there, the most personal conscience is bound to submit to the levelling  charm of the great multitude, there the neighbour rules, there one  _becomes_ a neighbour.\"          Wagner As A Danger.        1.      The aim after which more modern music is striving, which is now given the  strong but obscure name of \"unending melody,\" can be clearly understood by  comparing it to one's feelings on entering the sea. Gradually one loses  one's footing and one ultimately abandons oneself to the mercy or fury of  the elements: one has to swim. In the solemn, or fiery, swinging movement,  first slow and then quick, of old music--one had to do something quite  different; one had to dance. The measure which was required for this and  the control of certain balanced degrees of time and energy, forced the  soul of the listener to continual sobriety of thought.--Upon the  counterplay of the cooler currents of air which came from this sobriety,  and from the warmer breath of enthusiasm, the charm of all good music  rested--Richard Wagner wanted another kind of movement,--he overthrew the  physiological first principle of all music before his time. It was no  longer a matter of walking or dancing,--we must swim, we must hover.{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} This  perhaps decides the whole matter. \"Unending melody\" really wants to break  all the symmetry of time and strength; it actually scorns these things--Its  wealth of invention resides precisely in what to an older ear sounds like  rhythmic paradox and abuse. From the imitation or the prevalence of such a  taste there would arise a danger for music--so great that we can imagine  none greater--the complete degeneration of the feeling for rhythm, _chaos_  in the place of rhythm.{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} The danger reaches its climax when such music  cleaves ever more closely to naturalistic play-acting and pantomime, which  governed by no laws of form, aim at effect and nothing more.{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~}  Expressiveness at all costs and music a servant, a slave to attitudes--this  is the end.{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~}        2.      What? would it really be the first virtue of a performance (as performing  musical artists now seem to believe), under all circumstances to attain to  a _haut-relief_ which cannot be surpassed? If this were applied to Mozart,  for instance, would it not be a real sin against Mozart's spirit,--Mozart's  cheerful, enthusiastic, delightful and loving spirit? He who fortunately  was no German, and whose seriousness is a charming and golden seriousness  and not by any means that of a German clodhopper.{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} Not to speak of the  earnestness of the \"marble statue\".{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} But you seem to think that all music  is the music of the \"marble statue\"?--that all music should, so to speak,  spring out of the wall and shake the listener to his very bowels?{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} Only  thus could music have any effect! But on whom would the effect be made?  Upon something on which a noble artist ought never to deign to act,--upon  the mob, upon the immature! upon the blases! upon the diseased! upon  idiots! upon _Wagnerites_!{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~}        A Music Without A Future.      Of all the arts which succeed in growing on the soil of a particular  culture, music is the last plant to appear; maybe because it is the one  most dependent upon our innermost feelings, and therefore the last to come  to the surface--at a time when the culture to which it belongs is in its  autumn season and beginning to fade. It was only in the art of the Dutch  masters that the spirit of mediaeval Christianity found its expression--,  its architecture of sound is the youngest, but genuine and legitimate,  sister of the Gothic. It was only in Handel's music that the best in  Luther and in those like him found its voice, the Judeo-heroic trait which  gave the Reformation a touch of greatness-the Old Testament, _not_ the  New, become music. It was left to Mozart, to pour out the epoch of Louis  XIV., and of the art of Racine and Claude Lorrain, in _ringing_ gold; only  in Beethoven's and Rossini's music did the Eighteenth Century sing itself  out--the century of enthusiasm, broken ideals, and _fleeting joy_. All real  and original music is a swan song--Even our last form of music, despite its  prevalence and its will to prevail, has perhaps only a short time to live,  for it sprouted from a soil which was in the throes of a rapid  subsidence,--of a culture which will soon be _submerged_. A certain  catholicism of feeling, and a predilection for some ancient indigenous  (so-called national) ideals and eccentricities, was its first condition.  Wagner's appropriation of old sagas and songs, in which scholarly  prejudice taught us to see something German _par excellence_--now we laugh  at it all, the resurrection of these Scandinavian monsters with a thirst  for ecstatic sensuality and spiritualisation--the whole of this taking and  giving on Wagner's part, in the matter of subjects, characters, passions,  and nerves, would also give unmistakable expression to the _spirit of his  music_ provided that this music, like any other, did not know how to speak  about itself save ambiguously: for _musica is a woman_.{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} We must not let  ourselves be misled concerning this state of things, by the fact that at  this very moment we are living in a reaction, _in the heart itself_ of a  reaction. The age of international wars, of ultramontane martyrdom, in  fact, the whole interlude-character which typifies the present condition  of Europe, may indeed help an art like Wagner's to sudden glory, without,  however, in the least ensuring its _future prosperity_.

She had started out to keep the appointment  her aunt had made early in the morning, and had spent most of the day in  a first-class waiting-room at Victoria Station, where she had heard all  the story.    'Now,' said Darnell, when the table had been cleared, 'tell us all about  it. How long has it been going on?'    'Aunt thinks now, from little things she remembers, that it must have  been going on for a year at least. She says there has been a horrid kind  of mystery about uncle's behaviour for a long time, and her nerves were  quite shaken, as she thought he must be involved with Anarchists, or  something dreadful of the sort.'    'What on earth made her think that?'    'Well, you see, once or twice when she was out walking with her husband,  she has been startled by whistles, which seemed to follow them  everywhere. You know there are some nice country walks at Barnet, and  one in particular, in the fields near Totteridge, that uncle and aunt  rather made a point of going to on fine Sunday evenings. Of course, this  was not the first thing she noticed, but, at the time, it made a great  impression on her mind; she could hardly get a wink of sleep for weeks  and weeks.'    'Whistling?' said Darnell. 'I don't quite understand. Why should she be  frightened by whistling?'    'I'll tell you. The first time it happened was one Sunday in last May.  Aunt had a fancy they were being followed a Sunday or two before, but  she didn't see or hear anything, except a sort of crackling noise in the  hedge. But this particular Sunday they had hardly got through the stile  into the fields, when she heard a peculiar kind of low whistle. She took  no notice, thinking it was no concern of hers or her husband's, but as  they went on she heard it again, and then again, and it followed them  the whole walk, and it made her so uncomfortable, because she didn't  know where it was coming from or who was doing it, or why. Then, just as  they got out of the fields into the lane, uncle said he felt quite  faint, and he thought he would try a little brandy at the \"Turpin's  Head,\" a small public-house there is there. And she looked at him and  saw his face was quite purple--more like apoplexy, as she says, than  fainting fits, which make people look a sort of greenish-white. But she  said nothing, and thought perhaps uncle had a peculiar way of fainting  of his own, as he always was a man to have his own way of doing  everything. So she just waited in the road, and he went ahead and  slipped into the public, and aunt says she thought she saw a little  figure rise out of the dusk and slip in after him, but she couldn't be  sure. And when uncle came out he looked red instead of purple, and said  he felt much better; and so they went home quietly together, and nothing  more was said. You see, uncle had said nothing about the whistling, and  aunt had been so frightened that she didn't dare speak, for fear they  might be both shot.    'She wasn't thinking anything more about it, when two Sundays afterwards  the very same thing happened just as it had before. This time aunt  plucked up a spirit, and asked uncle what it could be. And what do you  think he said? \"Birds, my dear, birds.\" Of course aunt said to him that  no bird that ever flew with wings made a noise like that: sly, and low,  with pauses in between; and then he said that many rare sorts of birds  lived in North Middlesex and Hertfordshire. \"Nonsense, Robert,\" said  aunt, \"how can you talk so, considering it has followed us all the way,  for a mile or more?\" And then uncle told her that some birds were so  attached to man that they would follow one about for miles sometimes; he  said he had just been reading about a bird like that in a book of  travels. And do you know that when they got home he actually showed her  a piece in the \"Hertfordshire Naturalist\" which they took in to oblige a  friend of theirs, all about rare birds found in the neighbourhood, all  the most outlandish names, aunt says, that she had never heard or  thought of, and uncle had the impudence to say that it must have been a  Purple Sandpiper, which, the paper said, had \"a low shrill note,  constantly repeated.\" And then he took down a book of Siberian Travels  from the bookcase and showed her a page which told how a man was  followed by a bird all day long through a forest. And that's what Aunt  Marian says vexes her more than anything almost; to think that he should  be so artful and ready with those books, twisting them to his own wicked  ends. But, at the time, when she was out walking, she simply couldn't  make out what he meant by talking about birds in that random, silly sort  of way, so unlike him, and they went on, that horrible whistling  following them, she looking straight ahead and walking fast, really  feeling more huffy and put out than frightened. And when they got to the  next stile, she got over and turned round, and \"lo and behold,\" as she  says, there was no Uncle Robert to be seen! She felt herself go quite  white with alarm, thinking of that whistle, and making sure he'd been  spirited away or snatched in some way or another, and she had just  screamed out \"Robert\" like a mad woman, when he came quite slowly round  the corner, as cool as a cucumber, holding something in his hand. He  said there were some flowers he could never pass, and when aunt saw that  he had got a dandelion torn up by the roots, she felt as if her head  were going round.'    Mary's story was suddenly interrupted. For ten minutes Darnell had been  writhing in his chair, suffering tortures in his anxiety to avoid  wounding his wife's feelings, but the episode of the dandelion was too  much for him, and he burst into a long, wild shriek of laughter,  aggravated by suppression into the semblance of a Red Indian's  war-whoop. Alice, who was washing-up in the scullery, dropped some three  shillings' worth of china, and the neighbours ran out into their gardens  wondering if it were murder. Mary gazed reproachfully at her husband.    'How can you be so unfeeling, Edward?' she said, at length, when  Darnell had passed into the feebleness of exhaustion. 'If you had seen  the tears rolling down poor Aunt Marian's cheeks as she told me, I don't  think you would have laughed. I didn't think you were so hard-hearted.'    'My dear Mary,' said Darnell, faintly, through sobs and catching of the  breath, 'I am awfully sorry. I know it's very sad, really, and I'm not  unfeeling; but it is such an odd tale, now, isn't it? The Sandpiper, you  know, and then the dandelion!'    His face twitched and he ground his teeth together. Mary looked gravely  at him for a moment, and then she put her hands to her face, and Darnell  could see that she also shook with merriment.    'I am as bad as you,' she said, at last. 'I never thought of it in that  way. I'm glad I didn't, or I should have laughed in Aunt Marian's face,  and I wouldn't have done that for the world. Poor old thing; she cried  as if her heart would break. I met her at Victoria, as she asked me, and  we had some soup at a confectioner's. I could scarcely touch it; her  tears kept dropping into the plate all the time; and then we went to the  waiting-room at the station, and she cried there terribly.'    'Well,' said Darnell, 'what happened next? I won't laugh any more.'    'No, we mustn't; it's much too horrible for a joke. Well, of course aunt  went home and wondered and wondered what could be the matter, and tried  to think it out, but, as she says, she could make nothing of it. She  began to be afraid that uncle's brain was giving way through overwork,  as he had stopped in the City (as he said) up to all hours lately, and  he had to go to Yorkshire (wicked old story-teller!), about some very  tiresome business connected with his leases. But then she reflected that  however queer he might be getting, even his queerness couldn't make  whistles in the air, though, as she said, he was always a wonderful man.  So she had to give that up; and then she wondered if there were anything  the matter with her, as she had read about people who heard noises when  there was really nothing at all. But that wouldn't do either, because  though it might account for the whistling, it wouldn't account for the  dandelion or the Sandpiper, or for fainting fits that turned purple, or  any of uncle's queerness. So aunt said she could think of nothing but to  read the Bible every day from the beginning, and by the time she got  into Chronicles she felt rather better, especially as nothing had  happened for three or four Sundays. She noticed uncle seemed  absent-minded, and not as nice to her as he might be, but she put that  down to too much work, as he never came home before the last train, and  had a hansom twice all the way, getting there between three and four in  the morning. Still, she felt it was no good bothering her head over what  couldn't be made out or explained anyway, and she was just settling  down, when one Sunday evening it began all over again, and worse things  happened. The whistling followed them just as it did before, and poor  aunt set her teeth and said nothing to uncle, as she knew he would only  tell her stories, and they were walking on, not saying a word, when  something made her look back, and there was a horrible boy with red  hair, peeping through the hedge just behind, and grinning. She said it  was a dreadful face, with something unnatural about it, as if it had  been a dwarf, and before she had time to have a good look, it popped  back like lightning, and aunt all but fainted away.'    'A red-headed _boy_?' said Darnell. 'I thought----What an extraordinary  story this is. I've never heard of anything so queer. Who was the boy?'    'You will know in good time,'"]]]
