On 19 April I made an attempt with red dots, but she was tired, and  rapped out first 25, then 23 and finally 19--there were 19 dots. Then I  made some blue dots and she rapped \"11.\" \"Are you sure?\" Again \"11.\"  And this, too, was right.    I put this test several times and it was always successful when the  dots were sufficiently large and regular and did not exceed 35; also if  the colour was dark--either blue or black. Later on, when I read  Krall's book I found that the horses had been submitted to this test  with equally good results. Professor Kraemer of Hohenheim attributes  the reason for this to the fact of animals having originally lived in  herds, and that their \"leader\" as well as the other horses always knew  whether their full complement was present or not. I have had the same  experience with clucking-hens. A clucking-hen with twelve chicks knows  at once should one be missing, and seeks it even when it cannot utter a  sound, and while all the rest of her brood are running about in such  confusion that it would seem impossible to count them oneself. How  animals manage to do this without a sense of figures and without words  always remains a puzzle to me! Now, the measure taken by a dog's eye is  almost as accurate as is its sight for near objects, and its swift  glance and comprehensive eye for detail. It is true that all these  tests have been put to my dog Lola _alone_, but I venture to say  that these facts will be found to apply to all dogs in common, should  they belong to a natural and healthy breed of animals, and not to an  artificially procured variety.    As to \"measuring by eye,\" this was a test put to her accidentally.  About the beginning of June, 1917, for lack of any better idea at the  moment, I determined to teach her the use of the yard measure (the  metre), and without having any definite object in view. So I fetched  the yard-stick and told her the names and the meaning of the divisions  three times; but she seemed unable to work up any enthusiasm for the  subject, and I therefore did not attempt to question her. Many duties  intervened, and so I forgot the whole matter for several weeks. But on  25 July I thought it might be just as well to test her eye for measure,  and this reminded me of the yard-stick. So I asked for fun: \"Do you  remember that I showed you the yard-stick?\" \"Yes!\" was her prompt  reply. In astonishment I continued: \"How many centimetres are there to  the metre?\" \"100!\" \"And how many decimetres to twenty centimetres?\"  \"2.\" \"And how many decimetres in two and a half centimetres?\" \"25.\"  Now, for the joke of the thing, I determined to test the accuracy of  her eye, for I had not yet fetched the yard-stick, and she had, in  fact, not seen it for many weeks. So I pointed to the outside edge of a  small picture-frame that I--at a guess--took to be about twenty-two  centimetres in length. At the same time I must own that I have never  exercised my judgment in this line to any very great extent. \"How long  is this lower edge?\" I asked her, \"from _here_ to _here_?\" (pointing):  her answer was, \"25.\" I then tested it by the stick; it was twenty-six!  I pointed to a larger frame, putting the same question, she answered  \"50.\" I measured, and found it to be 75. Again I showed her a smaller  picture, and she rapped \"19.\" Then I showed her a piece of chocolate--\"7\"  was her reply--it was seven and a half. Later on, when she was in the  mood she became able to guess within _half_ a centimetre at a distance  of about thirty centimetres and at greater distances--up to one metre;  I estimated the difference to vary from about one to ten centimetres.  Of late I have not given her much practice of this kind, for from the  beginning she has not cared much for it. But I have made the experiment  of seeing whether she can distinguish colours in the same way we do. To  make this test I daubed some of the most important colours on a sheet  of paper, writing the name beneath each, and the next day I daubed the  same colours on another piece of paper--but in different sequence, and  without adding their names. The ready response to my questions gave  further proof as Lola's good memory as well as of her perfect ability  to differentiate.    I next questioned her on more practical subjects. I said: \"What is the  colour of the stove in this room?\" at the same time looking out of the  window to make sure that she knew what a \"stove\" was. \"Green,\" was her  answer--and quite right too, for the stove is built of green porcelain  tiles. I asked her a few more questions relating to flowers and to  articles in daily use until I had no further doubt as to her being  competent to tell one colour from the other. Coming generations may,  perhaps, laugh at these numerous tests, instead of crediting animals  with this ability as a matter of course!          HER PERFECT SENSE FOR SOUND      In my quest for further tests as to canine abilities, the idea occurred  to me that it might be as well to arrive at a greater degree of  certainty with respect to sound, that is, inquiring into a dog's memory  for sound, and their powers of differentiating one tune from another.  In the case of my old dog, I had already observed many things such as  inclined those to whom I had related my experiences, to be of opinion  that these had to do with the dog's ear. For instance, if I had been  away, and returned (either driving or on foot), conversing in low tones  with another person, this dog would _scream_ for joy. His voice on such  occasions was of quite a special quality, and everybody about the  court-yard knew that I must have already passed the tree known as the  \"Abend Eiche,\" which stands some hundred metres distant, and the dog  was always at that time confined, though in the open. Our conversations  on such occasions were always quiet ones, and yet the dog recognized my  voice at a distance of a hundred metres. If I happened to return alone  and on foot, after an absence of about two days, his cries would start  when I had reached _half that distance_--therefore, at fifty  metres--and Lola would then also hear my step. And here is another  example--one about which I was at first doubtful, not knowing to which  sense it should be attributed. I always knew from Lola when I might  expect a certain friend of mine--a friend to whom, by the way, she was  really more attached than to me! I used to know by the heavy raps of  her tail against the floor. The room in which we would be at such times  was on the second floor and lay towards the front of the house. But  when those anticipatory raps began my friend was still on her way,  coming by a path which lay in the rear of the house, and, moreover, she  always came alone. When the dog was present she could never take me by  surprise.    My next ventures were of a musical nature, as I thought it might be  easiest to achieve something in this direction. Lola knew the letters  that are associated with the different tones (_c_, _d_, _e_, _f_, _g_,  _a_, _h_[15], _e_), having learnt these in her alphabet, so I only had  to strike the keys (and I confined myself to the _white_ ones, as  involving fewer difficulties), telling her their names. I began by  saying: \"Lola, you are going to learn something quite new and very  beautiful; you must listen to these sounds and tell me the names of  each.\" Then I played the notes over several times from c to c, saying  clearly and slowly: \"c, d, e, f, g, a, h.\" Then I paused and played  them over again--both the ascending and descending scale.          [15] _h_ is the term used in Germany for the note we call _b_.    Then I struck \"c,\" saying, \"What note is that?\" She answered \"c.\" I  struck \"e,\" but she rapped \"no.\" I therefore played from c to e,  accentuating e in particular. \"Do you know now?\" I asked, and she  replied, \"yes: e.\" I struck \"a,\" and the answer came at once, \"a.\" This  seemed enough for one day, for I wished to keep her interest fresh. So  we then went over some arithmetic. The next day I played only _once_  from c to c, asking the names of the notes out of their order, and Lola  was right in all her replies with the exception of \"h,\" and this she  soon identified after a comparison with the other notes. I tried  whether she could recognize the number of notes in a chord. First I  struck two, asking her the number; she replied \"2.\" I then struck  four--and she replied \"4\" without any hesitation. Then I struck five  together, _c_ being associated with them twice. At this Lola rapped  \"4,\" so I said: \"You are to tell me _every_ note I strike,\" at the same  time putting down the chord again, after which she replied \"5.\" This  had been an experiment for which I had made few preparations and I  marvelled at such obvious evidences of musical comprehension. But I  felt that I should nevertheless test her more closely still, and so I  told my experiences to a friend, a woman composer of great professional  distinction. This lady was both interested and surprised, and seating  herself at the piano, she struck some notes. I placed myself so as not  to see the keyboard and tried to guess their pitch, yet I have no \"ear\"  in this way. I had in 1915 attended a course of Delcroze lessons (given  at Stuttgart by Fraeulein Steiner) and had tried to acquire the faculty  to distinguish the basic tone of any chord given at random--for this  can be acquired if one is to some extent musical, yet could I but  seldom succeed. I would hover in doubt between c and d, and so on,  without sensing any connexion with the other tones. Here, too, with one  single note being struck I was unequal to the test, but Lola's replies  were excellent, yet was it again the novelty that gave zest to the  affair, for later on her answers were good only when she was inclined  to take trouble. But in the beginning she had been most obviously"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25918"],[0,"Heads and Tales : or, Anecdotes and Stories of Quadrupeds and Other Beasts, (#12)"],[1," had, in the first year of his  reign, expressed his desire to see a union accomplished between England  and Scotland. He was convinced that nothing could more conduce to the  safety and happiness of both. He should think it his peculiar felicity  if, before the close of his reign, some happy expedient could be devised  for making the two kingdoms one; and he, in the most earnest manner,  recommended the question to the consideration of the Houses. It was  resolved that the message should be taken into consideration on Saturday  the 7th of March.    \"But, on the 1st of March, humours of menacing appearance showed  themselves in the king's knee. On the 4th of March he was attacked by  fever; on the 5th, his strength failed greatly; and on the 6th he was  scarcely kept alive by cordials. The Abjuration Bill and a money bill  were awaiting his assent. That assent he felt that he should not be able  to give in person. He therefore ordered a commission to be prepared for  his signature. His hand was now too weak to form the letters of his  name, and it was suggested that a stamp should be prepared. On the 7th  of March the stamp was ready. The Lord Keeper and the Clerks of the  Parliament came, according to usage, to witness the signing of the  commission. But they were detained some hours in the ante-chamber while  he was in one of the paroxysms of his malady. Meanwhile the Houses were  sitting. It was Saturday the 7th, the day on which the Commons had  resolved to take into consideration the question of the union with  Scotland. But that subject was not mentioned. It was known that the king  had but a few hours to live; and the members asked each other anxiously  whether it was likely that the Abjuration and money bills would be  passed before he died. After sitting long in the expectation of a  message, the Commons adjourned till six in the afternoon. By that time  William had recovered himself sufficiently to put the stamp on the  parchment which authorised his commissioners to act for him. In the  evening, when the Houses had assembled, Black Rod knocked. The Commons  were summoned to the bar of the Lords; the commission was read, the  Abjuration Bill and the Malt Bill became law, and both Houses adjourned  till nine o'clock in the morning of the following day. The following day  was Sunday. But there was little chance that William would live through  the night. It was of the highest importance that, within the shortest  possible time after his decease, the successor designated by the Bill of  Rights and the Act of Succession should receive the homage of the  Estates of the Realm, and be publicly proclaimed in the Council: and the  most rigid Pharisee in the Society for the Reformation of Manners could  hardly deny that it was lawful to save the state, even on the Sabbath.    \"The king meanwhile was sinking fast. Albemarle had arrived at  Kensington from the Hague, exhausted by rapid travelling. His master  kindly bade him go to rest for some hours, and then summoned him to make  his report. That report was in all respects satisfactory. The States  General were in the best temper; the troops, the provisions, and the  magazines were in the best order. Everything was in readiness for an  early campaign. William received the intelligence with the calmness of a  man whose work was done. He was under no illusion as to his danger. 'I  am fast drawing,' he said, 'to my end.' His end was worthy of his life.  His intellect was not for a moment clouded. His fortitude was the more  admirable because he was not willing to die. He had very lately said to  one of those whom he most loved, 'You know that I never feared death;  there have been times when I should have wished it, but, now that this  great new prospect is opening before me, I do wish to stay here a little  longer.' Yet no weakness, no querulousness disgraced the noble close of  that noble career. To the physicians the king returned his thanks  graciously and gently. 'I know that you have done all that skill and  learning could do for me, but the case is beyond your art; and I  submit.' From the words which escaped him he seemed to be frequently  engaged in mental prayer. Burnet and Tenison remained many hours in the  sick-room. He professed to them his firm belief in the truth of the  Christian religion, and received the sacrament from their hands with  great seriousness. The antechambers were crowded all night with lords  and privy-councillors. He ordered several of them to be called in, and  exerted himself to take leave of them with a few kind and cheerful  words. Among the English who were admitted to his bedside were  Devonshire and Ormond. But there were in the crowd those who felt as no  Englishman could feel, friends of his youth, who had been true to him,  and to whom he had been true, through all vicissitudes of fortune; who  had served him with unalterable fidelity when his Secretaries of State,  his Treasury, and his Admiralty had betrayed him; who had never on any  field of battle, or in an atmosphere tainted with loathsome and deadly  disease, shrunk from placing their own lives in jeopardy to save his,  and whose truth he had at the cost of his own popularity rewarded with  bounteous munificence. He strained his feeble voice to thank  Auverquerque for the affectionate and loyal services of thirty years. To  Albemarle he gave the keys of his closet and of his private drawers.  'You know,' he said, 'what to do with them.' By this time he could  scarcely respire. 'Can this,' he said to the physicians, 'last long?' He  was told that the end was approaching. He swallowed a cordial, and asked  for Bentinck. Those were his last articulate words. Bentinck instantly  came to the bedside, bent down, and placed his ear close to the king's  mouth. The lips of the dying man moved, but nothing could be heard. The  king took the hand of his earliest friend, and pressed it tenderly to  his heart. In that moment, no doubt, all that had cast a slight passing  cloud over their long and pure friendship was forgotten. It was now  between seven and eight in the morning. He closed his eyes, and gasped  for breath. The bishops knelt down and read the commendatory prayer.  When it ended William was no more!\"    It was assuredly the stumbling of his horse against a mole-hill that led  more immediately to the death of this great monarch. It is but one link  in the chain of many providences affecting his life. We all remember the  schoolboy ditty--       \"For want of a nail the shoe was lost;     For want of a shoe the rider was lost;     For want of the rider the battle was lost;     For want of the battle the kingdom was lost.\"    How much the death of King William retarded progress in Great Britain  can never be judged or determined. His appointed hour had come. It was  no bullet with its billet on the banks of the Boyne that laid the  Dutchman low, but the cast-up earth of a specimen of a little  insectivorous quadruped called the mole, which laid him on that bed from  which he never arose.    FOOTNOTES:    [28] Jeremy Taylor, if I remember aright.    [29] Vol. V., pp. 305-310.          BEARS.      A most comfortably clad set of plantigrade creatures, as fond, most of  them, of fruits as they are of flesh. No creatures are more amusing in  zoological gardens to children, who wonder at their climbing powers. Who  is so heartless as not to have pitied the roving polar bear, caged, on a  sultry July day, in a small paddock with a puddle, and wandering about  restlessly in his few feet of ground, as the well-dressed mob lounged to  hear the military band performing in the Regent's Park Zoological  Gardens? Even young bears have an _adult_ kind of look about them. The  writer remembers the manner of one, disappointed at its bread sap, most  of the milk of which had been absorbed. A little girl standing by, not  two years old, perfectly understood what the little creature was  searching for, and, looking up, said \"milka,\" or something closely  resembling it. We recently saw a little brown bear, on board a Russian  ship at Leith. He acted as a capital guard. The little creature had a  grown-up face, more easily observed than described.    Bear hams, we speak from rare experience, are truly excellent. Bears, in  our early London days, were kept by many hairdressers and perfumers. The  anecdote or passage from Dickens's \"Humphrey's Clock\" is very  characteristic.    In one of Wilkie's pictures the brown bear is figured on its way with  its owners to the parish beadle's \"house of detention.\" We remember the  very bear and its owners. A fine chapter might be written on the animals  that used to be led about the country by wandering foreigners. Our first  sight of guinea-pigs, our first view of the black-bellied hamster, our  first sight of the camel and dromedary, with a monkey on his neck, and  our first bear, were seen in this way. Boys and girls in those days  seldom saw menageries. A muzzled bear on its hind legs in Nicolson  Street, or at the Sciennes, was an exotic sight seldom witnessed, and  not easily forgotten. The last we saw was in Bernard Street, Leith, in  1869. That very day, the police were hunting for Bruin and its leaders  all over Edinburgh. Bears are now debarred from parading our streets.      AN AUSTRIAN GENERAL AND A BEAR.[30]    Mr Paget was told an excellent story of a bear hunt, which took place in  the mountains of Transylvania, and in the presence of the gentleman who  told him the story.    \"General V----, the Austrian commander of the forces in this district,  had come to Cronstadt to inspect the troops, and had been invited by our  friend, in compliment to his rank, to join him in a bear hunt. Now, the  general, though more accustomed to drilling than hunting, accepted the  invitation, and appeared in due time in a cocked hat and long gray  greatcoat, the uniform of an Austrian general. When they had taken up  their places, the general, with half a "]]]
