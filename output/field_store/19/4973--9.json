In such  a stable environment there would be no advantage to a sharply defined  seasonal molt cycle that could place an animal in thermoregulatory  jeopardy by increasing its thermal conductance. This would be  particularly true for animals like tropical procyonids that have lower  than predicted [.H]_{b}'s but that maintain typical eutherian body  temperatures (Table 7). Consequently, molt in all tropical procyonids  may either be prolonged or continuous. This is a feature of their  biology that needs to be examined in more detail.      _Comparison of Thermal Conductances_    _Procyon lotor_ VERSUS TROPICAL PROCYONIDS.--C_{mwr} for _Procyon  lotor_ in winter was 1.15, which is similar to the values for _Potos  flavus_ and _Procyon cancrivorus_, 1.02 and 1.25, respectively  (Table 7). These two tropical species, therefore, have C_{mw}'s that  are similar on a mass specific basis to the value for _Procyon lotor_  in winter. However, at their T_{lc}'s, the thermal gradient sustained  by these tropical animals is only about 11 deg.C, whereas for _Procyon  lotor_ in winter it was 26.5 deg.C. Examination of Eq. 4 with respect to  these thermal gradients suggests that tropical procyonids achieve such  low C_{mw}'s by virtue of their lower than predicted [.H]_{b}'s rather  than by having pelts that are exceptionally good insulators. In fact,  the insulation afforded by the pelts of these tropical procyonids is  about the same as that of the 50 g arctic lemming, _Dicrostonyx  groenlandicus rubricatus_, whose coat has an insulative value that is  about half that of the hare, _Lepus americanus_, red fox, _Vulpes fulva  alascensis_, and pine martin, _Martes americana_, animals comparable in  size to these procyonids (Scholander et al., 1950a). Therefore, pelts  of these tropical procyonids do not have the same insulative value as  the prime winter coat of _Procyon lotor_.    _Nasua narica_ and _Nasua nasua_ have tropical and subtropical  distributions and they are the only procyonids that are diurnal  (Kaufmann, 1962:103-105, 1982, 1987). Because they are active during  the day they experience a more extreme thermal environment (higher  T_{a}'s and solar radiation) than their nocturnal cousins. Values of  C_{mwr} for _Nasua narica_ (1.45 and 1.55) and _Nasua nasua_ (1.24 and  1.65) are higher than those for _Procyon cancrivorus_ or _Potos flavus_  (Table 7). Thus, these coatis have higher mass specific C_{mw}'s than  their nocturnal tropical cousins. A high C_{mw} reduces the cost of  thermoregulation in hot environments because it increases an animal's  ability to lose excess heat passively. The higher C_{mw}'s of these  coatis serve as an adaptation that contributes to the success of their  diurnal life style as well as their ability to expand their habitat use  to areas with less thermal stability, such as oak and pine woodlands  and deserts.    _Bassariscus astutus._--This species has the lowest mass specific  C_{mw} of these procyonids (C_{mwr} = 0.85; Table 7), which indicates  that its pelt has a greater insulative value than the coats of _Potos  flavus_, _Procyon cancrivorus_, _Nasua nasua_, or _Nasua narica_. This,  coupled with a lower than predicted [.H]_{b}, allows _Bassariscus  astutus_ to maintain T_{b} with less energy expenditure than is  possible for any other procyonid of comparable size; and this  combination of adaptations provides _Bassariscus astutus_ with a  distinct energy advantage in environments that have low productivity  (Wang et al., 1973). The evolution of a pelt that provides better  insulation must be considered an important contributing factor for  the spread of this species into desert regions of the western United  States.        THERMOREGULATION AND USE OF STORED FAT AT LOW TEMPERATURES      _Background_    THERMOREGULATION.--At temperatures below a mammal's T_{n}, heat loss  exceeds [.H]_{b}. To maintain T_{b} under these conditions, metabolic  rate must be increased (Eq. 4). _Procyon lotor_ in summer during its  annual molt (Table 5; Figure 2), _Bassariscus astutus_ (Chevalier,  1985), _Nasua nasua_ (Chevillard-Hugot et al., 1980; Mugaas et al.,  in prep.), _Nasua narica_ (Scholander et al., 1950b; Mugaas et al.,  in prep.), and _Potos flavus_ (Mueller and Kulzer, 1977; Mueller and Rost,  1983) all are able to elevate their metabolic rates by 130% above basal  when they are exposed to T_{a} = 0 deg.C. _Procyon cancrivorus_ responds to  0 deg.C with an increase in metabolic rate of 257% above basal (Scholander  et al., 1950b). All animals listed have about the same T_{lc} and T_{b},  so the temperature differential producing this response is about the  same for each species. Metabolic ability to defend body temperature  against low ambient temperatures, therefore, is well developed in these  procyonids. Such large increases in metabolic rate are energetically  expensive, and if these animals were routinely exposed to T_{a} = 0 deg.C,  it would be difficult for them to acquire enough food each day to  maintain endothermy. Raccoons in winter pelage, however, need only  elevate their metabolic rate by 47% above basal to maintain endothermy  at T_{a} = 0 deg.C (Table 5; Figure 3). Each year at the completion of its  molt, the raccoon's highly insulative pelt is renewed. This lowers  their T_{lc} by 9 deg.C to 15 deg.C below that measured for them in summer  (Figure 3) and decreases their cost of thermoregulation at low  temperatures. The increased insulative capacity of their pelt is one  of the primary adaptations that has allowed _Procyon lotor_ to extend  its distribution into cold climates.    STORED FAT.--Cyclic fattening is an integral and important part of a  raccoon's annual cycle (Mugaas and Seidensticker, ms); however, it has  not been reported for other procyonids. During winter in parts of the  United States and Canada, raccoons are confined to their dens for  variable periods of time (days to months) depending on the severity of  the weather (Stuewer, 1943:223-225; Whitney and Underwood, 1952:108-116;  Sharp and Sharp, 1956; Mech et al., 1968; Schneider et al., 1971).  During this confinement, they do not hibernate but rather enter a state  of \"dormancy\" and become inactive. While dormant they remain endothermic  (T_{b} > 35 deg.C; Thorkelson, 1972:87-90) and derive most of their energy  requirement from fat reserves accumulated during fall. The rate at which  fat stores are consumed during winter dormancy depends on the  thermoregulatory requirement imposed on them by local weather  conditions, the insulative quality of their pelt, and any advantage  they may gain by seeking shelter in a den.      _Thermal Model of the Raccoon and Its Den_    Heat transfer between an animal and its environment is a function of  the interaction of its body temperature and thermal conductance with  various environmental variables (air temperature, wind speed, vapor  pressure, and thermal radiation). When a raccoon is outside its den,  its thermal conductance (C_{mw}) is the only barrier to heat transfer  with the external environment. However, when it enters a tree den, a  raccoon imposes two other thermal barriers between itself and the  external environment: (1) conductance of the air space between its fur  and the den's walls (C_{a}) and (2) conductance of the den's walls  (C_{d}; Thorkelson, 1972:59-63; Thorkelson and Maxwell, 1974).  Thorkelson and Maxwell (1974) modeled heat transfer of a simulated  raccoon (a water-filled aluminum cylinder equipped with a heater and  covered with a raccoon pelt) in a closed tree den. In their system,  65% of resistance to heat flux was attributable to the pelt, whereas  the remainder (35%) was due to C_{a} and C_{d}. Because resistance is  the inverse of conductance, and resistances for the raccoon and its  den are arranged in series, we can estimate total conductance (C_{t})  of this system with Eq. 7.     1/C_{t} = 1/C_{mw} + 1/C_{a} + 1/C_{d}                         Eq. 7    Minimum thermal conductance C_{mw} for raccoons in winter was  0.0172 mL O_{2}.g^{-1}.h^{-1}. deg.C^{-1} (Table 3). Based on Thorkelson  and Maxwell's (1974) model we let 1/C_{mw} = 0.65(1/C_{t}) =  1/0.0172 mL O_{2}.g^{-1}.h^{-1}. deg.C^{-1}, and 1/C_{a} + 1/C_{d} =  0.35(1/C_{t}). Substituting these values into Eq. 7 and solving  for C_{t} yields 0.0112 mL O_{2}.g^{-1}.h^{-1}. deg.C^{-1}, a value  that is 35% lower than that of the animal alone. Substituting  this value and the value for basal metabolism of winter raccoons  (0.47 mL O_{2}.g^{-1}.h^{-1}; Table 7) into Eq. 4 and solving for  (T_{b} - T_{a}) yields a new temperature differential of 42 deg.C.  Therefore, by using tree dens, raccoons in north central Virginia,  with T_{b} = 37 deg.C (Figure 7), could effectively reduce their T_{lc}  from 11 deg.C to -5 deg.C and markedly reduce their metabolic cost of  thermoregulation.      _Metabolic Advantage of the Den_    Given prevailing winter temperatures in north central Virginia (see  \"Materials and Methods\"), adult raccoons in that area should be able  to sustain endothermy most of the time they are in their dens by simply  maintaining [.H]_{b}. Depending on the mass of their stored fat, they  could remain in their dens for several weeks without eating (Mugaas and  Seidensticker, ms). The thermal advantage of a den could be further  enhanced during colder temperatures if two or more raccoons occupied it  at the same time and huddled together, and/or if these animals could  reduce C_{mw} even more by lowering T_{b} and cooling their extremities.  Although we do not have any data to verify the second mechanism, there  are many accounts in natural history literature that document raccoons  occupying dens together (Lotz"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36069"],[0,"Explorers and Travellers (#12)"],[1,"sun shines full upon  them, sparkle so as to be seen at a very great distance.\"    Carver's enthusiasm and interest in the West led him to make the  following striking prediction, which time has fully justified. He says:    \"This extraordinary range of mountains is calculated to be more than  three thousand miles in length, without any very considerable intervals,  which, I believe, surpasses anything of the kind in the other quarters  of the globe. Probably, in future ages, they may be found to contain  more riches in their bowels than those of Hindostan and Malabar, or than  are produced on the golden coast of Guinea, nor will I except even the  Peruvian mines. To the west of these mountains, when explored by future  Columbuses or Raleighs, may be found other lakes, rivers, and countries,  full fraught with all the necessaries or luxuries of life, and where  future generations may find an asylum, whether driven from their country  by the ravages of lawless tyrants, or by religious persecutions, or  reluctantly leaving it to remedy the inconveniences arising from a  superabundant increase of inhabitants; whether, I say, impelled by these  or allured by hopes of commercial advantages, there is little doubt but  their expectations will be fully gratified in these rich and unexhausted  climes.\"    Carver described the valley of the Minnesota as a most delightful  country, abounding with all the necessities of life, which grow  spontaneously. Fruit, vegetables, and nuts were represented as being  particularly abundant, and the sugar-maple grew in amazing numbers.    In April, 1767, the Santees descended the Minnesota in order, among  other things, to bury their dead near a remarkable cave on Lake Pepin,  known to the Indians as the \"dwelling of the Great Spirit.\"    Finding that supplies had not been sent to the Falls of St. Anthony,  Carver returned to Prairie-du-Chien in order to get sufficient stores to  enable him to reach Lake Superior, whence he hoped to be able to cross  the continent from Grand Portage. Obtaining such supplies, he proceeded  up the Mississippi to the Chippeway River, and, after ascending to its  head, made portages to the St. Croix, and reached Lake Superior,  possibly by the river now known as the Bois Brule.    From this point Carver, in his canoe, skirted the coast of Lake Superior  to the Grand Portage, where he awaited the arrival of the Hudson Bay or  northern traders, from whom he anxiously hoped to obtain supplies that  would enable him to journey west; but he was destined to disappointment,  as nothing could be obtained from them. Carver coasted around the north  and east borders of Lake Superior, and arrived at the Falls of Ste.  Marie the beginning of October, having skirted nearly twelve hundred  miles of the shores of Lake Superior in a birch canoe.    The Sault Ste. Marie was then the resort of the Algonquin Indians, who  frequented the falls on account of the great numbers of whitefish that  filled the waters, particularly in the autumn, when that fish leaves  the lakes in order to spawn in shallow running waters.    In November, 1767, Carver arrived at Mackinac, having, as he says, \"been  sixteen months on this extensive tour, travelled nearly four thousand  miles, and visited twelve nations of Indians living to the west and  north. His picture of Detroit on his return, in 1768, is of  retrospective interest.    \"The town of Detroit contains upward of one hundred houses. The streets  are somewhat regular, and have a range of very convenient and handsome  barracks with a spacious parade at the south end. On the west side lies  the King's Garden, belonging to the Governor, which is very well laid  out, and kept in good order. The fortifications of the town consist of a  strong stockade, made of round piles, fixed firmly in the ground, and  lined with palisades. These are defended by some small bastions, on  which are mounted a few indifferent cannon of an inconsiderable size,  just sufficient for its defence against the Indians or an enemy not  provided with artillery. The garrison in time of peace consists of two  hundred men, commanded by a field-officer, who acts as chief magistrate  under the Governor of Canada.    \"In the year 1762, in the month of July, it rained on this town and the  parts adjacent a sulphurous water of the color and consistency of ink,  some of which being collected in bottles, and wrote with, appeared  perfectly intelligible on the paper, and answered every purpose for  that useful liquid. Soon after, the Indian wars already spoken of broke  out in these parts. I mean not to say that this incident was ominous of  them, notwithstanding it is well known that innumerable well-attested  instances of extraordinary phenomena, happening before extraordinary  events, have been recorded in almost every age by historians of  veracity; I only relate the circumstance as a fact, of which I was  informed by many persons of undoubted probity, and leave my readers, as  I have heretofore done, to draw their own conclusions from it.\"    It is beyond question that certain chapters of Carver's work,  supplementary to his account of his personal explorations, and  especially devoted to Indians and to the natural history of the  Northwest, are practically translations of the accounts of Charlevoix,  Hennepin, and particularly of Lahontan. It does not appear from the  first part of the work that Carver was a man endowed with those powers  of observation and assimilation which are essential traits for the  successful traveller and author.    When the brief recital of his personal travels is examined, it seems  difficult to determine on what grounds his truthfulness has been  questioned by a few hostile critics. His story is simple and  straightforward, devoid of boastfulness, free from any exaggeration as  to his personal prowess, and the statement that he passed a winter of  five months in the valley of the Upper Minnesota is, in my opinion,  worthy of entire credence.    Fortunately, however, evidence of the most convincing character exists  as to Carver's residence among the Naudowessies or Santees. The  exhaustive bibliography of the Siouan languages, by Mr. James C.  Pilling, indicates that Carver is the first author who ever published a  vocabulary of the Santee tongue, and its length, eight pages, renders it  evident that it was an original compilation which must have required  considerable time and patience.    [Illustration: Naudowessie Indians.    Carver's drawing of \"A man and woman of the Naudowessie,\" herewith  reproduced, if somewhat fanciful in its details, must be considered of  historical value as indicating in the main the costumes of the Santees  when first visited by the whites.]    The importance of Carver's charts and journals at that time was evident  to the Lords Commissioners of Trade and Plantations in England to whom  Carver was referred when praying for reimbursement of his expenses.  Carver appeared before the Board and, after an examination, was granted  authority to publish his papers. Later, after Carver had, as he says,  disposed of them and they were nearly ready for the press, an order was  issued from the Council Board requiring him to immediately turn in all  the originals of his charts, journals, and other papers relative to his  discoveries.    Meanwhile interest in the extension of English influence into the  interior of North America was waning steadily with the growing  conviction that the colonies would establish their independence, and the  Government had no mind to reimburse an enterprising American, even  though he remained loyal. Carver was reduced gradually to the greatest  straits, was compelled to sell his book for a pittance, and finally, his  end hastened by lack of proper food and suitable attendance, died in the  direst poverty in London, January 13, 1780.    His own generation could best judge as to the timeliness and importance  of Carver's exploration, and as to the value of the information set  forth in his book of travels. Suffice it to say that no less than  twenty-three editions of this book have appeared, in four languages.  This, too, at a time when the war of independence naturally destroyed  current interest in the extension of English settlements in the interior  of North America.    Explorations, however, are wisely esteemed by posterity according to the  results which flow therefrom in the shape of definite additions to the  knowledge of the world or in the more important direction of disclosing  lands suitable for colonization. In this latter manner the exploration  of Jonathan Carver and the accounts of his travels had an important  influence. They first brought into popular and accessible form  information and ideas concerning the interior parts of North America  which before had been practically inaccessible to the general public of  England and America.    Twenty-five years after this journey toward the \"Shining Mountains\" and  \"Oregon, the River of the West,\" the ultimate scheme of Carver found its  justification in the success of Alexander Mackenzie, a young Scotchman,  who was the first white man to cross the continent of America to the  north of Mexico; and yet ten years later Lewis and Clark were despatched  on their famous expedition which explored the valley of the Columbia,  where in 1810, under the energetic management of John Jacob Astor, arose  the trading-post of Astoria, thus turning into reality the dreams and  aspirations of Jonathan Carver, the soldier and explorer.
