He tells me that he cannot do without me, and that there is no  Englishman for whom he has so great a kindness; but all this weighs  nothing with me in comparison of my duty to my lawful King.\"    If the First Lord of the Treasury really had scruples about betraying  his trust, those scruples were soon so effectually removed that he  very complacently continued, during six years, to eat the bread of one  master, while secretly sending professions of attachment and promises of  service to another.    The truth is that Godolphin was under the influence of a mind far more  powerful and far more depraved than his own. His perplexities had  been imparted to Marlborough, to whom he had long been bound by such  friendship as two very unprincipled men are capable of feeling for each  other, and to whom he was afterwards bound by close domestic ties.    Marlborough was in a very different situation from that of William's  other servants. Lloyd might make overtures to Russell, and Bulkeley to  Godolphin. But all the agents of the banished Court stood aloof from  the traitor of Salisbury. That shameful night seemed to have for ever  separated the perjured deserter from the Prince whom he had ruined.  James had, even in the last extremity, when his army was in full  retreat, when his whole kingdom had risen against him, declared that  he would never pardon Churchill, never, never. By all the Jacobites the  name of Churchill was held in peculiar abhorrence; and, in the prose and  verse which came forth daily from their secret presses, a precedence in  infamy, among all the many traitors of the age, was assigned to him. In  the order of things which had sprung from the Revolution, he was one of  the great men of England, high in the state, high in the army. He  had been created an Earl. He had a large share in the military  administration. The emoluments, direct and indirect, of the places  and commands which he held under the Crown were believed at the Dutch  Embassy to amount to twelve thousand pounds a year. In the event of a  counterrevolution it seemed that he had nothing in prospect but a garret  in Holland, or a scaffold on Tower Hill. It might therefore have been  expected that he would serve his new master with fidelity, not  indeed with the fidelity of Nottingham, which was the fidelity of  conscientiousness, not with the fidelity of Portland, which was the  fidelity of affection, but with the not less stubborn fidelity of  despair.    Those who thought thus knew but little of Marlborough. Confident in his  own powers of deception, he resolved, since the Jacobite agents would  not seek him, to seek them. He therefore sent to beg an interview with  Colonel Edward Sackville.    Sackville was astonished and not much pleased by the message. He was a  sturdy Cavalier of the old school. He had been persecuted in the days of  the Popish plot for manfully saying what he thought, and what every body  now thinks, about Oates and Bedloe. [64] Since the Revolution he had  put his neck in peril for King James, had been chased by officers with  warrants, and had been designated as a traitor in a proclamation to  which Marlborough himself had been a party. [65] It was not without  reluctance that the stanch royalist crossed the hated threshold of the  deserter. He was repaid for his effort by the edifying spectacle of such  an agony of repentance as he had never before seen. \"Will you,\" said  Marlborough, \"be my intercessor with the King? Will you tell him what  I suffer? My crimes now appear to me in their true light; and I shrink  with horror from the contemplation. The thought of them is with me day  and night. I sit down to table; but I cannot eat. I throw myself on my  bed; but I cannot sleep. I am ready to sacrifice every thing, to brave  every thing, to bring utter ruin on my fortunes, if only I may be free  from the misery of a wounded spirit.\" If appearances could be trusted,  this great offender was as true a penitent as David or as Peter.  Sackville reported to his friends what had passed. They could not but  acknowledge that, if the arch traitor, who had hitherto opposed to  conscience and to public opinion the same cool and placid hardihood  which distinguished him on fields of battle, had really begun to feel  remorse, it would be absurd to reject, on account of his unworthiness,  the inestimable services which it was in his power to render to the  good cause. He sate in the interior council; he held high command in  the army; he had been recently entrusted, and would doubtless again be  entrusted, with the direction of important military operations. It was  true that no man had incurred equal guilt; but it was true also that no  man had it in his power to make equal reparation. If he was sincere,  he might doubtless earn the pardon which he so much desired. But was he  sincere? Had he not been just as loud in professions of loyalty on the  very eve of his crime? It was necessary to put him to the test. Several  tests were applied by Sackville and Lloyd. Marlborough was required to  furnish full information touching the strength and the distribution of  all the divisions of the English army; and he complied. He was required  to disclose the whole plan of the approaching campaign; and he did so.  The Jacobite leaders watched carefully for inaccuracies in his reports,  but could find none. It was thought a still stronger proof of his  fidelity that he gave valuable intelligence about what was doing in the  office of the Secretary of State. A deposition had been sworn against  one zealous royalist. A warrant was preparing against another. These  intimations saved several of the malecontents from imprisonment, if  not from the gallows; and it was impossible for them not to feel some  relenting towards the awakened sinner to whom they owed so much.    He however, in his secret conversations with his new allies, laid no  claim to merit. He did not, he said, ask for confidence. How could he,  after the villanies which he had committed against the best of Kings,  hope ever to be trusted again? It was enough for a wretch like him to be  permitted to make, at the cost of his life, some poor atonement to the  gracious master, whom he had indeed basely injured, but whom he had  never ceased to love. It was not improbable that, in the summer, he  might command the English forces in Flanders. Was it wished that he  should bring them over in a body to the French camp? If such were the  royal pleasure, he would undertake that the thing should be done. But  on the whole he thought that it would be better to wait till the next  session of Parliament. And then he hinted at a plan which he afterwards  more fully matured, for expelling the usurper by means of the English  legislature and the English army. In the meantime he hoped that James  would command Godolphin not to quit the Treasury. A private man could  do little for the good cause. One who was the director of the national  finances, and the depository of the gravest secrets of state, might  render inestimable services.    Marlborough's pretended repentance imposed so completely on those who  managed the affairs of James in London that they sent Lloyd to France,  with the cheering intelligence that the most depraved of all rebels had  been wonderfully transformed into a loyal subject. The tidings filled  James with delight and hope. Had he been wise, they would have excited  in him only aversion and distrust. It was absurd to imagine that a man  really heartbroken by remorse and shame for one act of perfidy would  determine to lighten his conscience by committing a second act of  perfidy as odious and as disgraceful as the first. The promised  atonement was so wicked and base that it never could be made by any man  sincerely desirous to atone for past wickedness and baseness. The truth  was that, when Marlborough told the Jacobites that his sense of guilt  prevented him from swallowing his food by day and taking his rest at  night, he was laughing at them. The loss of half a guinea would have  done more to spoil his appetite and to disturb his slumbers than all the  terrors of an evil conscience. What his offers really proved was that  his former crime had sprung, not from an ill regulated zeal for the  interests of his country and his religion, but from a deep and incurable  moral disease which had infected the whole man. James, however, partly  from dulness and partly from selfishness, could never see any immorality  in any action by which he was benefited. To conspire against him, to  betray him, to break an oath of allegiance sworn to him, were crimes for  which no punishment here or hereafter could be too severe. But to murder  his enemies, to break faith with his enemies was not only innocent but  laudable. The desertion at Salisbury had been the worst of crimes;  for it had ruined him. A similar desertion in Flanders would be an  honourable exploit; for it might restore him.    The penitent was informed by his Jacobite friends that he was forgiven.  The news was most welcome; but something more was necessary to restore  his lost peace of mind. Might he hope to have, in the royal handwriting,  two lines containing a promise of pardon? It was not, of course, for  his own sake that he asked this. But he was confident that, with such  a document in his hands, he could bring back to the right path some  persons of great note who adhered to the usurper, only because they  imagined that they had no mercy to expect from the legitimate King. They  would return to their duty as soon as they saw that even the worst of  all criminals had, on his repentance, been generously forgiven. The  promise was written, sent, and carefully treasured up. Marlborough had  now attained one object, an object which was common to him with Russell  and Godolphin. But he had other objects which neither Russell nor  Godolphin had ever"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26196"],[0,"The International Magazine, Volume 2, No. 3, February, 1851 (#12)"],[1,"journal and drew a map of their route, but his canoe was upset in  the falls of St. Louis, as he was descending the St. Lawrence in sight  of Montreal, and he lost them with the rest of his effects. What  increases the value of the present discovery is, that the original  narrative goes much more into detail than the one published by Thevenot.  The motive which prompted and the preparations which were made for the  expedition are fully described, and no difficulty is found in tracing  its route. There is also among the papers an autograph journal by  Marquette, of his last voyage from the 25th of October, 1674, to the 6th  of April, 1675, a month before his singular death, which occurred on the  eastern shore of Lake Michigan. Also, a chart of the Mississippi drawn  by himself, illustrating his travels. The one annexed to Thevenot's  account, above referred to, a copy of which is contained in the third  volume of Bancroft's History of the United States, is manifestly  incorrect, as there is a variance between the route of the Jesuit as  traced on his map, and that detailed in his text. The manuscript chart  now rescued from oblivion, reconciles all discrepancies, and constitutes  a most interesting historical relic.\"           *       *       *       *       *    AMONG the publications of the past month, _A copious and critical  Latin-English Lexicon_, royal octavo, pp. 1663, from the press of the  Harpers, is especially deserving of praise. We congratulate Professors  Andrews and Turner on the honorable close to their long and arduous  labors. They have earned thanks of all beginning students and riper  scholars in the Latin tongue. These, and the advancement of sound  learning, are the only adequate rewards for labors so untiring and long  continued; so wearisome and beneficial. The highest and only just praise  of this admirable volume, would be given by a plain statement of its  merits, but these are too extensive and varied to be even catalogued  within brief limits--we can only touch upon a few of them. For a year  past we have had opportunity and occasion to examine parts of the work  as it was going on to completion, and to compare it with others of  similar design. We speak then advisedly when we say that it far  surpasses any such Lexicon hitherto in use among us, and should  supersede them all. Since the works of Forcellini, and Facciolati, and  Gesner, very great advances have been made in all departments of  classical Philology; many of the best results of these advances were  embodied in Freund's great Lexicon, the first volume of which was  published in 1834. But since then, and even since 1845, the date of the  last volume, the thirst for antiquarian research has slaked itself at  newly discovered sources. The present editors, to a discriminating  selection from all that the zeal and activity of others have gathered,  up to the latest time, have added valuable knowledge from their own  varied stores, and at last furnished to American students a work  superior in its kind to any that has preceded it here or abroad. It  combines in a remarkable degree the copiousness of a Thesaurus with the  brevity and convenience for ready reference of a school-dictionary.  Citations abundantly sufficient to meet the wants of ordinary readers  are given in full, while distinct references guide the more exacting  scholar over a much wider field of original authority. In this way space  is economized, and the book is made cheap without a sacrifice of  learning. Its first general merit is its singular correctness. In a  verification of the almost numberless passages quoted, and a correction  of time-honored blunders, committed by subordinates, but sanctioned by  names of great writers employing them; in a distrust of authority at  second-hand, and persistent fidelity to the cause of learning, we  recognize the diligence of Prof. W. W. Turner. Those who have never  tried this kind of work have but an inadequate idea of its demands on  the brain, and on the conscience too. _Reading through_ a dictionary is  an after-dinner pastime in comparison. The vocabulary is more extended  than in other lexicons. But the peculiar and highest merit of this work  appears in definitions, remarkable for clearness, fulness, and  distinction of the subtle shades of meaning. Colloquial, technical, and  other special uses of words, here receive their share of attention, and  are felicitously rendered or illustrated by corresponding English terms.  The arrangement is admirable. The words of the vocabulary are  distinguished by an appropriate type. The etymology, the primitive and  derivative, the general and special, the proper and tropical  significations of a word; its meaning before the courts, in the temples,  at the games, among the Roman mob or the Roman exquisites; its  anti-classical, golden-augustan, neo-degenerate or patristic use--all  this is given in a regular order, by changes of type and an ingenious  system of abbreviations, so that the whole origin, history, value and  application of any Latin word may be taken in, almost at a glance. The  amount of archaeological learning--compressed indeed but never obscured  by abridgment--scattered through these pages is immense. Finally there  is an appendix, containing the XII. Tables, and other specimens of  Archaic Latin; and another, giving a list of Italian and French words,  varied by euphonic changes from the Latin origin. There are also a  translation of Freund's original preface by Prof. Woolsey, and a modest  preface by Prof. Andrews, the editor in chief.           *       *       *       *       *    THE REV. F. W. SHELTON, minister of an out-of-the-way parish on Long  Island, and known in literature hitherto only by two or three wise  lectures which he addressed to the young men of his village, (though his  intimate friends have guessed all the while that his hand was in some of  the wittiest and most unique contributions to the _Knickerbocker_,) has  published during the last month one of the best specimens of allegory  furnished by this age. It is entitled \"Salander,\" and has for its  subject the backbiting dragon sometimes called by similar name. It makes  a neat duodecimo, illustrated with wood cuts, and is published by Samuel  Hueston.           *       *       *       *       *    PROFESSOR BUSH is editing and will soon publish (through J.

Dr. Bush adds to the work a preface  and notes.           *       *       *       *       *    MISS MARTINEAU and a Mr. Atkinson have just published a volume entitled  \"Letters on Man's Nature and Development,\" in which they handle very  boldly the subjects of Mesmerism, Clairvoyance, Phrenology, &c.

HENRY C. PHILLIPS, once, we understand, a companion of the traveller  Catlin, proposes to publish from his note-book and portfolio, \"Sites for  Cities, and Scenes of Beauty and Grandeur, to be made famous by the  Poets and Painters of Coming Ages: observed in a Pedestrian Journey  across the middle of the North American Continent, in 1850.\" This is a  good title, and such a book will be interesting a thousand years hence,  for its prophecies. Surveying the vast chain of mountains, which rises  midway between the oceans, a poetical Jesuit said, \"They are in labor  with nations.\" Mr. Phillips might easily have fancied, as he pursued his  summer journey through the wilderness from Oregon and California, among  regions more lovely and magnificent than any that were seen by the  fathers of art, that of such sights should be born nobler works than  have yet been addressed to the senses or to the imagination; and it is  not improbable that many a London, and Moscow, and Berlin, and Paris,  will some time have their busy populations, where now the ground is  hidden by the falling leaves of forests, and trampled by wild horses and  buffaloes.           *       *       *       *       *    ONE of the most eminent of the living English historians, lately  discovered, as he thought, that \"Old Sam Adams\" was a _defaulter_, and  that he was opposed to Washington; and not choosing to wait until the  exposure could be made in his forthcoming work, he communicated it to a  very distinguished American, by letter. Now this is all sheer nonsense.  It is not necessary to deny the justice of the suspicion that Samuel  Adams was unfriendly to Washington, and all the facts as to his conduct  as collector for his Majesty's port of Boston, are perfectly familiar to  our historical students. He did not indeed pay into the exchequer every  shilling with which he was _charged_: well understood circumstances  prevented the _collection_ of a large amount of duties; but whatever he  received was paid over, and his accounts were squared to a farthing.           *       *       *       *       *    MR.
