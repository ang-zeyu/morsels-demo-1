His company  commander adopted the unusual but effective punishment of reading the  letter aloud in the presence of the writer and the fellow members of his  platoon. A story is told of a padre of the 5th Brigade who, whilst  censoring, discovered that one man had declared his undying devotion to  two different girls, and to each had repudiated any allegiance to the  other. The censor was so indignant over this act of treachery that he  transposed the envelopes of the two letters, before sealing them down.    Of amusements there was no lack. These will be referred to later on. On  the whole, therefore, the soldier had little to complain of in the  treatment he received, nor did he give the Commanding Officer any cause  for anxiety as regards his conduct. Breaches of minor regulations were  common enough, but in most cases the offences were venial and such as  were likely to be committed by any recruit. Only two cases were remanded  for trial by court-martial. Nor were the evils resulting from excessive  drinking conspicuously present. Precautions, however, had to be taken to  prevent any lowering of the standard which the Battalion was working  towards, and in this respect examples had to be made in a few cases  where the individual held rank, and in other cases where sickness  appeared to be simulated.    One little incident seems to be worth mentioning. A soldier, who had  been freely sampling a Reading brew of beer, encountered a certain  warrant officer. An exchange of compliments took place, during which the  private referred disparagingly to his superior's figure and parentage.  On the next day he appeared at \"orderly room\" and was awarded a brief  period of enforced retirement. Declining to walk to the place of  detention he was placed on a stretcher, but the stretcher bearers were  so inexperienced then that after a journey of about 200 yards he elected  to march. On his release, the offender, very contrite and desiring to  make the _amende honourable_, approached the warrant officer and  explained that the statement previously made in regard to his _figure_  was entirely without foundation.    Some rioting had occurred a few months previously in Cairo, and overseas  soldiers were said to have been concerned in it. A further outbreak was  reported during the last week of July, followed on the next evening by a  disturbance in Heliopolis. Whatever were the causes of the first two  outbreaks, the third was directly traceable to the fact that Cairo was  suddenly placed out of bounds when leave men were waiting for trams at  the Heliopolis terminus with a view to securing passage to the city. The  military police, in attempting to deal with the situation, behaved  rather tactlessly, and incurred the resentment of the men, who indulged  in some stone-throwing and roughly handled a few individuals. Charges of  wholesale looting were laid against the troops, but a court of inquiry,  of which the commanding officer was a member, found on close  investigation that L50 would cover the whole of the damage done. The  claims submitted by the native shopkeepers totalled up to some L3,000.  During the early months of the A.I.F's. stay in Egypt, the Military  Police, a newly constituted force, incurred the dislike of the bulk of  the troops. This dislike engendered an antipathy which endured until the  end of the war. In the first instance there appears to have been some  reason for it. The police were not selected with sufficient care, and  included a number of men whose actions, to say the least, were shady. On  several occasions decent and well-behaved members of the Battalion were  received from the police cells, bereft of their money, much bruised and  battered, and accompanied by a charge sheet accusing them of crimes  which one moment's consideration would show they could not have  committed. Strong representations on these matters had no immediate  effect, but ultimately the Provost Corps was purged of the bad element  and became a body of experienced men of great value in the prevention or  detection of crime and the regulation of military traffic.    So far as could be learned, the men of the 28th had no part in either of  the disturbances. In fact, so uniformly high had been their standard of  behaviour that it had come under the notice of Sir John Maxwell, who  sent and asked the Battalion to supply picquets for duty in the  disturbed area. This action rather raised the resentment of some units  and created a certain amount of ill-feeling. So acute did this become  that on one occasion the Battalion of its own volition was on the point  of \"standing to\" with entrenching tool handles to repel a threatened  raid. However, common sense prevailed and good feeling with the men of  the Eastern States was soon re-established, but not before the title  \"J----'s Own\" had been conferred upon the Western Australians.    With the complete mobilisation of the Brigade the number of chaplains in  the camp was brought up to four. Services were held in the huts every  Sunday morning, attendance at which was compulsory. Dean Brennan  identified himself with his flock. The Rev. J. H. Neild, so long as his  health endured, was assiduous in his desire to help all who sought his  aid. The Presbyterian chaplain, the Rev. W. J. Stevens, had served in  the ranks in the South African War. He was very earnest and direct in  his addresses. He inclined towards mysticism, and spoke much of the  \"Angel of Mons.\" Otherwise he knew men well and was later noted for his  activities during the Brigade's stay on Gallipoli. The Anglican chaplain  was inclined to dogma. Very early he gave an address, \"Why I believe in  the Church of England.\" As no one was interested in the subject he rated  his audience for its inattention, and thereafter ceased to exercise any  influence amongst its members. In France he recovered some ground and  did good work, amongst other things, in the organisation of institutes  and coffee stalls behind the lines.

FIRST STAY IN EGYPT.    (continued.)      As has already been stated, the Battalion was quarantined for 14 days  after its arrival at Abbasia. To find amusement during that period was a  problem. At first the immediate environment produced some distraction.  The hawkers and their cries, the arguments between contractors and  labourers, the labour gangs at work, the habits of the crowds of  scavenging kites, the Yeomanry exercising in the desert, the Egyptian  Army recruits drilling in front of their barracks in time to drums  beating at 140 a minute, and the circus-like performance of the Arab  grooms taking remounts to and from water, all helped to pass an idle  hour or two. Occasionally there was a visit from a little party of  juvenile acrobats, who gave exhibitions of their prowess in return for  \"bakshish.\" One visitor was a youth of about 12--an extraordinary  caricature, suffering from ophthalmia and dressed in various ragged and  dirty portions of uniform. He laid claim to the name of \"Saghen  Mechenzi\" and had an uncanny knowledge of the rifle, which he handled  like a guardsman, and defied all attempts to confound him. Another and  more welcome visitor was a youth of French extraction, who sold very  fine picture postcards at a reasonable rate and would also undertake  commissions for purchases in the city. Victor displayed unexpected  traits of honesty and on being questioned thereon replied--\"My father is  French, he is honest, therefore I am honest.\" Nothing more could be  said.    To relieve the monotony of the period during which no leave could be  granted, it was decided to arrange a route march through the city as far  as the Citadel walls, halt there for rest and return in the cool of the  evening. During the afternoon of Sunday, the 11th July, the Battalion in  drill order, and without rifles, set out led by a guide and preceded by  Victor mounted importantly on a white donkey. According to the map the  total distance to be covered was about ten miles, but owing to detours  necessary in order to avoid the narrow streets the Battalion actually  traversed some 14 or 15 miles. The heat was considerable, and a number  of men fell out on account of the sickness which was very prevalent at  this time. However, there was much to be seen. Palaces and hovels,  magnificent hotels and humble coffee houses. Strange people and  stranger costumes. Weird sights, sounds, and smells. Some streets no  wider than our back lanes, teeming with people, filth, and squalor, and  every window, doorway, or hole in the wall with something in it for  sale. Veiled women and shuttered upper windows in the better class  residential quarter hinted romance to those who had read the adventures  of the Khalif. A wedding procession, and, again, a funeral procession  were passed. The effect of the first was unusual, and the music that  accompanied it had a mournful touch not noticeable in the second. The  native police along the route were most attentive and cleared the way on  every occasion. The traffic was considerable--mostly pedestrian, but  with electric tramcars, donkeys, and horse gharris in large numbers.  After one or two rests on the way, the Battalion at length came to a  halt on an open space under the massive west wall of the Citadel. This  place was to become better known later on, but on this occasion  curiosity and interest were subordinated to the desire for cool drinks  and rest.

The master walked on, but the mastiff slackened  his pace, and laying hold of the damask cloth with his teeth, gave one  hearty pull, and thus brought all the glass on the sideboard in  shivers to the ground, thus robbing the unkind nobleman of his favorite  exhibition of splendor.    [Illustration]          XCIII    ARE BEASTS MERE MACHINES?      A gentleman one day talking with a friend said that beasts were mere  machines, and had no sort of reason to direct them; and that when they  cried or made a noise, it was only one of the wheels of the clock or  machine that made it.    The friend, who was of a different opinion replied, \"I have now in my  kitchen two dogs who take turns regularly every other morning to get  into the wheel. One of them, not liking his employment, hid himself on  the day that he should work, so that his companion was forced to mount  the wheel in his stead, but crying and wagging his tail, he made sign  for those about him to follow him. He at once led them to a garret,  where he found the idle dog, drove him out and killed him at once.\"    [Illustration]          XCIV    AN ASS CAST AWAY      An ass, belonging to a captain in the Royal Navy, then at Malta, was  shipped on board a frigate, bound from Gibraltar for that island. The  vessel struck on some sands off the Point de Gat, and the ass was thrown  overboard, in the hope that it might possibly be able to swim to the  land. Of this, however, there did not seem to be much chance, for the  sea was running so high, that a boat which left the ship was lost. A few  days later, when the gates of Gibraltar were opened one morning the  guard were surprised by Valiant, as the ass was called, presenting  himself there for admittance. On entering, he went at once to the stable  of a merchant, where he had formerly lived. The poor animal had not only  swum safely to shore, but without guide, compass, or travelling map, had  found his way from Point de Gat to Gibraltar, a distance of more than  two hundred miles, through a mountainous and intricate country, crossed  by streams, which he had never travelled over before, and in so short a  period, that he could not have made one false turn.    [Illustration]          XCV    QUARRELSOME APES      The town of Bindrabund in India is in high regard with the pious  Hindoos, who resort to it from the most remote parts of the empire. The  town is surrounded by groves of trees, which are the homes of numberless  apes, whose fondness for mischief is increased by the religious respect  paid to them in honor of a divinity of the Hindoo mythology, who is  represented as having the body of an ape. Because of this superstition,  such numbers of these animals are supported by the free-will offerings  of pilgrims, that no one dares to resist or ill-treat them. Hence,  access to the town is often difficult; for should one of the apes take a  dislike to any unlucky traveller, he is sure to be assailed by the whole  community, who follow him with all the missile weapons they can collect,  such as pieces of bamboo, stones, and dirt, making at the same time a  most hideous howling. Of the danger attending a meeting with enemies of  this description, the following is a melancholy instance. Two young  cavalry officers, belonging to the Bengal army, having occasion to pass  through the town, were attacked by a body of apes, at whom one of the  gentlemen had foolishly fired. The alarm instantly drew the whole body,  with the fakeers, out of the place, with so much fury that the officers,  though they were mounted upon elephants, were compelled to seek safety  in flight; and in trying to pass the Jumna, they both of them were  drowned.    [Illustration]          XCVI    A FALSE ALARM      Some years ago, a soldier, who was doing duty at the castle of Cape  Town, kept a tame baboon for his amusement. One evening it broke its  chains unknown to him, and in the night it climbed up into the belfry,  and began to play with and ring the bell.    Instantly the whole place was in an uproar; some great danger was  feared. Many thought that the castle was on fire; others, that an enemy  had entered the bay, and the soldiers actually began to turn out, when  it was discovered that the mischievous baboon had caused the  disturbance.    On the following morning a court-martial was held, when Cape justice  decided that whereas the baboon had unnecessarily put the castle into  alarm, its master should receive fifty lashes. The soldier, however,  found someway to evade the punishment.    [Illustration]          XCVII    A CHILD SAVED      A shepherd, in one of his trips to look after his flock, took with him  one of his children, a boy three years old. After crossing his pastures  for some time, followed by his dog, he found it necessary to ascend a  hill at some distance, to obtain a better view of his range. As the  climb was too much for the little child, he left him on a small plain at  the bottom, telling him not to stir from it until his return. Scarcely  had he gained the top of the hill, however, when the sky was darkened by  a thick mist. The anxious father at once hurried back to find his child;  but owing to the unusual darkness, he missed his way. After a fruitless  search of many hours, he discovered that he had reached the bottom of  the valley, and was near his own cottage. To renew the search that night  was both vain and most dangerous; he was, therefore, compelled to go  home, although he had lost both his child and his dog, that had attended  him faithfully for many years. Next morning, by break of day, the  shepherd, with many of his neighbors, set out to look for the child; but  after a day of searching, he returned to his home, disappointed. He  found that the dog which he had lost the day before had been to the  cottage, and after getting a piece of cake, had at once gone away again.  For several days the shepherd kept up the search, and on his return  each evening, he found that the dog had been home, had received his  usual allowance of cake, and then had instantly disappeared. Struck with  this strange behavior on the part of the dog, he remained at home one  day; and when the dog, as usual, left with his piece of cake, he decided  to follow him, and find out the cause of this queer procedure. The dog  led the way to a cataract at some distance from the spot where the  shepherd had left the child. Down a rugged and almost perpendicular  descent the dog began, without hesitation, to make his way, and at last  disappeared by entering into a cave, the mouth of which was almost level  with the torrent. The shepherd with difficulty followed; but on entering  the cave, what was his joy, when he saw his lost baby boy eating with  much satisfaction the cake which the faithful dog had just brought to  him, while the noble creature stood by, looking at his young charge most  lovingly. The child had probably wandered to the brink of the precipice,  and then had either fallen or scrambled down till he reached the cave.  The dog had tracked him to the spot; and afterward kept him from  starving by giving up to him his own daily portion of food. He never  left the child by day or night, except when he went for the food; and  then he was always seen running at full speed to and from the cottage.    [Illustration]"]]]
