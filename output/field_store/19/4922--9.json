The king neglected to send the  Brahman to warn Pertal's family, and on the arrival of news at  Mudkal that a large force of the Raya's troops was approaching, the  inhabitants fled, and amongst them the girl and her relatives. The  troops therefore resumed, but on the way looted the country. They  were attacked by superior forces and 2000 of them were slain. This  led to a war.    \"In the beginning of the winter of the year 809 (I.E. the winter of  A.D. 1406),[95] he (the Sultan) moved in great force, and arrived  near Beejanuggur, in which Dewul Roy had shut himself up. An assault  was made upon the city, and the Sultan got possession of some streets,  which, however, he was obliged to quit, his army being repulsed by the  Carnatickehs. Dewul Roy, encouraged by his success, now ventured to  encamp his army under protection of the walls, and to molest the royal  camp. As the mussulmauns could not make proper use of their cavalry in  the rocky unevenness of ground round Beejanuggur, they were somewhat  dispirited. During this, Sultan Feroze Shaw was wounded by an arrow  in the hand, but he would not dismount; and drawing out the arrow,  bound up the wound with a cloth.    \"The enemy were at last driven off by the valour and activity of Ahmed  Khan and Khankhanan, and the Sultan moved farther from the city to a  convenient plain, where he halted till his wounded men were recovered.\"    He halted here for four months, holding the Raya a prisoner in his  own capital, while bodies of troops harassed and wasted the country  south of Vijayanagar, and attacked the fortress of Bankapur. The  \"convenient plain\" was probably in the open and rich valley near  the town of Hospett, south of the city; for the Sultan could not  have ravaged the country to the south unless he had been master of  the whole of this valley for many miles. Bankapur was taken, and the  detached forces returned bringing with them 60,000 Hindu prisoners;  on which the Sultan left Khankhanan to hold Vijayanagar, while he  himself attempted to reduce the fortress of Adoni, \"the strongest in  possession of the enemy.\"    Deva Raya then began to treat for peace, and was compelled to submit  to conditions to the last degree humiliating. He agreed to give the  Sultan his daughter in marriage, to indemnify him with an immense  treasure, and to cede for ever the fort of Bankapur.[96]    \"Though the roies of Carnatic had never yet married their daughters  but to persons of their own cast, and giving them to strangers was  highly disgraceful, yet Dewul Roy, out of necessity, complied,  and preparations for celebrating the nuptials were made by both  parties. For forty days communication was open between the city and  the sultan's camp. Both sides of the road were lined with shops and  booths, in which the jugglers, drolls, dancers, and mimics of Carnatic  displayed their feats and skill to amuse passengers. Khankhanan and  Meer Fuzzul Oollah, with the customary presents of a bridegroom,  went to Beejanuggur, from whence at the expiration of seven days they  brought the bride, with a rich portion and offerings from the roy,  to the sultan's camp. Dewul Roy having expressed a strong desire to  see the sultan, Feroze Shaw with great gallantry agreed to visit him  with his bride, as his father-in-law.    \"A day being fixed, he with his bride proceeded to Beejanuggur,  leaving the camp in charge of Khankhanan. On the way he was met by  Dewul Roy in great pomp. From the gate of the city to the palace,  being a distance of six miles,[97] the road was spread with cloth of  gold, velvet, satin, and other rich stuffs. The two princes rode on  horseback together, between ranks of beautiful boys and girls, who  waved plates of gold and silver flowers[98] over their heads as they  advanced, and then threw them to be gathered by the populace. After  this the inhabitants of the city made offerings, both men and women,  according to their rank. After passing through a square directly  in the centre of the city,[99] the relations of Dewul Roy, who had  lined the streets in crowds, made their obeisance and offerings, and  joined the cavalcade on foot, marching before the princes. Upon their  arrival at the palace gate, the sultan and roy dismounted from their  horses, and ascended a splendid palanquin, set with valuable jewels,  in which they were carried together to the apartments prepared for  the reception of the bride and bridegroom, when Dewul Roy took his  leave, and retired to his own palace. The sultan, after being treated  with royal magnificence for three days, took his leave of the roy,  who pressed upon him richer presents than before given, and attended  him four miles on his way, when he returned to the city.    \"Sultan Feroze Shaw was enraged at his not going with him to his  camp, and said to Meer Fuzzul Oollah that he would one day have his  revenge for the affront offered him by such neglect. This declaration  being told to Dewul Roy, he made some insolent remarks, so that,  notwithstanding the connection of family, their hatred was not calmed.\"    Firuz returned after this to his capital and sent for the lovely  Pertal, and on her arrival, finding that her beauty surpassed  all report, he gave her in marriage to his eldest son, Hasan  Khan, when \"the knot was tied amid great rejoicings and princely  magnificence.\" The lady's husband is described by Firishtah as being  \"a weak and dissipated prince.\" He was heir to the throne, but was  easily ousted by the valiant Ahmad \"Khankhanan,\" and lived privately  at Firuzabad, \"entirely devoted to redolence and pleasure.\" The last  we hear of him is that his usurping uncle, Ahmad Shah I., treated  him kindly, \"gave him the palace of Firozeabad for his residence,  with an ample jaghire (estate), and permission to hunt or take his  pleasure within eight miles round his palace, without restriction to  time or form.\" Hasan \"was more satisfied with this power of indulging  his appetites than with the charge of empire. While his uncle lived  he enjoyed his ease, and no difference ever happened between them;  but he was afterwards blinded and kept confined to the palace of  Firozeabad.\" This must have been after A.D. 1434.    Deva Raya I. lived till at least 1412 A.D., and was succeeded by  his son Vira-Vijaya, whom Nuniz calls \"Visaya,\" and who, he says,  reigned six years. The last extant inscription of Deva Raya I. is  dated in A.D. 1412 -- 13, the first of his successor Vijaya in 1413  -- 14. Vijaya's last known inscription is one of 1416 -- 17, and the  first yet known of his successor, his eldest son, Deva Raya II.,  is dated Monday, June 26, 1424 -- 25. Nuniz gives Deva Raya II. a  reign of twenty-five years.    I am inclined to think that Deva Raya II. began to reign in 1419,  for the following reason. The informants of Nuniz stated that  during Vijaya's reign he \"did nothing worth relating,\" and the  chronicle records that during the reign which followed, namely that  of Deva Raya II., there was \"constant warfare.\" Now we have it from  Firishtah that in 1417 Firuz, Sultan of Kulbarga, commenced a war of  aggression against the Hindus of Telingana He besieged the fortress  of Pangul,[100] seventy miles north-east of Adoni, for a period of  two years, but the attempt to reduce it ended in failure owing to a  pestilence breaking out amongst both men and horses.    \"Many of the first nobility deserted the camp and tied with their  followers to their jaghires. At this crisis Dewul Roy collected his  army, and having obtained aid from the surrounding princes, even to  the Raja of Telingana (Warangal), marched against the sultan with a  vast host of horse and foot.\"    This then took place in 1419 A.D., and since this energetic action was  not consonant with the character of Vijaya, the FAINEANT sovereign,  \"who did nothing worth recording\" in all his career, we must suppose  that it took place as soon as Deva Raya, his successor, was crowned;  when the nobles surrounding him (he was, I believe, quite young when  he began to reign)[101] filled with zeal and ambition, roused the  Hindu troops and in the king's name plunged into war against their  country's hereditary foe.    If this be correct, the reign of Deva Raya II., granting that it lasted  as stated by Nuniz for twenty-five years, ended in A.D. 1444. Now the  chronicle tells us a story of how this Deva Raya's son and successor,  \"Pina Rao,\"[102] was attacked by his nephew with a poisoned dagger, and  died from the effects of his wounds after a lapse of six months. Abdur  Razzak, more reliable because he was not only a contemporary but  was at Vijayanagar at the time, relates the same anecdote of Deva  Raya II. himself, making the would-be assassin the king's brother,  and definitely fixing the date beyond a shadow of a doubt. The  event occurred on some day between November 1442 and April 1443 --  the outside limits of Razzak's visit to Calicut -- during his stay  at which place he says it happened. Abdur Razzak does not mention the  king's death, and this therefore had not supervened up to the time of  the traveller leaving the capital in December 1443. On the assumption  that we need not be too particular about Nuniz's \"six months,\" we may  conclude that the attack was made about the month of April 1443, and  that Deva Raya II. died early in 1444 A.D. There is still, however,  a difficulty, as will be noticed below, inscriptions giving us the  name of a Deva Raya as late as 1449 A.D., but it is just possible  that this was another king of the same name.    Putting together the facts given above, we find that the twenty-five  years of the reign of Deva Raya II. lay between 1419 and 1444 A.D.

The act  of substitution is creditable alike to the head and heart of the  adelantado. It begins with an injunction \"that he should strive that  the people under his charge should live and be as true Christians,  separating themselves from vices and public sins, not permitting them  to speak ill of God, nor his blessed mother, nor the saints;\" and it  concludes with the words, \"because I know that you are a person who  will know how to do it well, putting first God our Lord, and the  service of his majesty, and the good of the country, and the execution  of justice.\"    Within a month from the time when he was called away by his father, Don  Francisco returned to Champoton with all the provisions necessary for  prosecuting, on his own account, the conquest of Yucatan. From this  time the door of better fortune seemed opened to the Spaniards.    Don Francisco determined forthwith to undertake the march to Campeachy.  At a short distance from Champoton they encountered a large body of  Indians, routed them, and, determined not to make any retrograde  movement, encamped upon the spot.    From this place the Indians, mortified and incensed at their defeat,  erected fortifications along the whole line of march. The Spaniards  could not advance without encountering walls, trenches, and  embankments, vigorously defended. All these they gained in succession;  and so great was the slaughter of the Indians, that at times their dead  bodies obstructed the battle, and the Spaniards were obliged to pass  over the dead to fight with the living. In one day they had three  battles, in which the Spaniards were almost worn out with fighting.    Here, again, the history fails, and it does not appear how they were  received in Campeachy; but it is manifest from other authorities that  in the year 1540 they founded a city under the name of San Francisco de  Campeche.    Remaining in this place till things were settled, Don Francisco, in  pursuance of his father's instructions, determined on descending to the  province of Quepech, and founding a city in the Indian town of Tihoo.  Knowing that delay was dangerous, he sent forward the Captain Francisco  de Montejo, his cousin, with fifty-seven men. He himself remained in  Campeachy to receive and organize the soldiers, who, stimulated by the  tidings of his improving fortunes, were every day coming in from his  father.    Don Francisco set out for Tihoo, and in all the accounts there is a  uniform correspondence in regard to the many dangers they encountered  on that journey from the smallness of their numbers, the great  multitudes of warlike Indians, and the strong walls and other defences  which they found at every step to obstruct their progress. The Indians  concealed the wells and ponds, and as there were no streams or  fountains, they were perishing with thirst. Provisions were cut off,  and they had war, thirst, and hunger on their path. The roads were mere  narrow passes, with thick woods on both sides, encumbered with the dead  bodies of men and animals, and their sufferings from want of water and  provisions were almost beyond endurance.    Arriving at a town called Pokboc, they pitched and fortified their  camp, with the intention of making a halt, but at night they were  roused by finding the camp on fire. All ran to arms, thinking less of  the fire than of the Indians, and in darkness and silence waited to  discover the quarter whence the attack would come; but hearing no  noise, and relieved from the apprehension of enemies, they attempted to  extinguish the flames. By this time, however, the whole camp, and  almost everything that they had, were burned up. But they were not  dismayed. The captain gave notice of this misfortune to his cousin in  Campeachy, and resumed his march. In the year 1540 he arrived at Tihoo.    In a few days he was joined by forty other Spaniards, who were sent on  by Don Francisco Montejo, and at this time some Indians came to them  and said, \"What are you doing here, Spaniards? more Indians are coming  against you, more than there are hairs on the skin of a deer.\" The  Spaniards answered that they would go out to seek them; and, leaving  the guard in the camp, the Captain Don Francisco Montejo immediately  set out, came upon them at a place five leagues distant, and attacked  them with such vigour, that, though they at first defended themselves  bravely, the Spaniards gained upon them, and killing many, the rest  became disheartened and took to flight.    In the mean time the son of the adelantado arrived from Campeachy; and  being now all united, and the Indians at first withholding all  supplies, they very soon began to suffer from want of provisions. While  in this condition, unexpectedly a great cacique from the interior came  to them voluntarily (the circumstances will appear hereafter) and made  submission. Some neighbouring caciques of Tihoo, either moved by this  example, or finding that, after so many years of war, they could not  prevail against the Spaniards, also submitted. Encouraged by the  friendship of these caciques, and believing that they might count upon  their succour until they had finished the subjection of the country,  the Spaniards determined to found a city on the site occupied by Tihoo;  but in the mean time a terrific storm was gathering over their heads.  All the Indians from the east of Tihoo were drawing together; and in  the month of June, toward the evening of the feast of Barnaby the  apostle, an immense body, varying, according to manuscript accounts,  from forty to seventy thousand, came down upon the small band of a  little more than two hundred then in Tihoo. The following day they  attacked the Spanish camp on all sides. The most terrible battle the  Spaniards had ever encountered ensued. \"Divine power,\" says the pious  historian, \"works more than human valour. What were so few Catholics  against so many infidels!\" The battle lasted the greater part of the  day. Many Indians were killed, but immediately others took their  places, for they were so many that they were like the leaves on the  trees. The arquebuses and crossbows made great havoc, and the horsemen  carried destruction wherever they moved, cutting down the fugitives,  trampling under foot the wounded and dying. Piles of dead bodies  stopped the Spaniards in their pursuit. The Indians were completely  routed, and for a great distance the ground was covered with their  dead.    The fame of the Spaniards rose higher than before, and the Indians  never rallied again for a general battle. All this year the invaders  were occupied in drawing to them and conciliating the neighbouring  caciques, and on the sixth of January, 1542, they founded, with all  legal formalities, on the site of the Indian town of Tihoo, the \"very  loyal and noble\" city of Merida.    Here I shall leave them; and I make no apology for presenting this  history. It was forty years since a straggling canoe at the island of  Guanaja first gave intelligence of the existence of such a country as  Yucatan, and sixteen since Don Francisco Montejo received the royal  authority to conquer and people it. During that time Cortez had driven  Montezuma from the throne of Mexico, and Pizarro had seized the sceptre  of the Peruvian Incas. In the glory of these conquests Yucatan was  unnoticed, and has been to this day. The ancient historians refer to it  briefly and but seldom. The only separate account of it is that of  Cogolludo, a native historian.    The work of this author was published in the year 1658. It is  voluminous, confused, and ill-digested, and might almost be called a  history of the Franciscan Friars, to which order he belonged. It is  from this work principally that, with no small labour, I have gathered  the events subsequent to the grant made by the king to Don Francisco  Montejo; it is the only work that purports to give an account of those  events, and as it has never been translated, and is scarcely known out  of Yucatan, and even in that country is almost out of print, it must at  least be new to the reader.

From the time of the conquest, Yucatan existed as a distinct  captain-generalcy, not connected with Guatimala, nor subject to the  viceroy of Mexico. So it continued down to the Mexican revolution. The  independence of Yucatan followed that of Mexico without any struggle,  and actually by default of the mother-country in not attempting to keep  it in subjection.    Separated from Spain, in an evil hour Yucatan sent commissioners to  Mexico to deliberate upon forming a government; and on the return of  these commissioners, and on their report, she gave up her independent  position, and entered into the Mexican confederation as one of the  states of that republic. Ever since she had been suffering from this  unhappy connexion, and, a short time before our former visit, a  revolution broke out all over the country; in the successful progress  of which, during that visit, the last Mexican garrison was driven out  of Yucatan. The state assumed the rights of sovereignty, asserting its  independent powers, at the same time not disconnecting itself entirely  from Mexico, but declaring itself still a component part of that  republic upon certain conditions. The declaration of its independence  was still a moot question. The assembly had passed a bill to that"]]]
