Whether this be  true or not, it is certain that he applied the micrometer to the  telescope, and was the first to use telescopic sights, by means of which  he was able to fix the optical axis of his telescope, and ascertain by  observation the apparent positions of the heavenly bodies.    Crabtree, in a letter to Gascoigne, says: 'Could I purchase it with  travel, or procure it with gold, I would not be without a telescope for  observing small angles in the heavens; or want the use of your device of  a glass in a cane upon the movable ruler of your sextant, as I remember  for helping to the exact point of the Sun's rays.'    It was not known until the beginning of the eighteenth century that  Gascoigne had invented and used telescopic sights for the purpose of  making accurate astronomical observations. The accidental discovery of  some documents which contained a description of his appliances was the  means by which this became known.    Townley states that Gascoigne had completed a treatise on optics, which  was ready for publication, but that no trace of the manuscript could be  discovered after his death. Having embraced the Royalist cause, William  Gascoigne joined the forces of Charles I., and fell in the battle of  Marston Moor on July 2, 1644.    The early death of this young and remarkably clever man was a severe  blow to the science of astronomy in England.    The invention of logarithms, by Baron Napier, of Merchistoun, was found  to be of inestimable value to astronomers in facilitating and  abbreviating the methods of astronomical calculation.    By the use of logarithms, arithmetical computations which necessitated  laborious application for several months could with ease be completed in  as many days. It was remarked by Laplace that this invention was the  means of doubling the life of an astronomer, besides enabling him to  avoid errors and the tediousness associated with long and abstruse  calculations.    THOMAS HARRIOT, an eminent mathematician, and an assiduous astronomer,  made some valuable observations of the comet of 1607. He was one of the  earliest observers who made use of the telescope, and it was claimed on  his behalf that he discovered Jupiter's satellites, and the spots on the  Sun, independently of Galileo. Other astronomers have been desirous of  sharing this honour, but it has been conclusively proved that Galileo  was the first who made those discoveries.    The investigations of Norwood and Gilbert, the mechanical genius of  Hooke, and the patient researches of Flamsteed--the first Astronomer  Royal--were of much value in perfecting many details associated with the  study of astronomy.    The Royal Observatory at Greenwich was founded in 1675. The building was  erected under a warrant from Charles II. It announces the desire of the  Sovereign to build a small observatory in the park at Greenwich, 'in  order to the finding out of the longitude for perfecting the art of  navigation and astronomy.' This action on the part of the King may be  regarded as the first public acknowledgment of the usefulness of  astronomy for national purposes.    Since its erection, the observatory has been presided over by a  succession of talented men, who have raised it to a position of eminence  and usefulness unsurpassed by any similar institution in this or any  other country. The well-known names of Flamsteed, Halley, Bradley, and  Airy, testify to the valuable services rendered by those past directors  of the Greenwich Observatory in the cause of astronomical science.    If we take a general survey of the science of astronomy as it existed  from 1608 to 1674--a period that embraced the time in which Milton  lived--we shall find that it was still compassed by ignorance,  superstition, and mystery. Astrology was zealously cultivated; most  persons of rank and position had their nativity or horoscope cast, and  the belief in the ruling of the planets, and their influence on human  and terrestrial affairs, was through long usage firmly established in  the public mind. Indeed, at this time, astronomy was regarded as a  handmaid to astrology; for, with the aid of astronomical calculation,  the professors of this occult science were enabled to predict the  positions of the planets, and by this means practised their art with an  apparent degree of truthfulness.    Although over one hundred years had elapsed since the death of  Copernicus, his theory of the solar system did not find many supporters,  and the old forms of astronomical belief still retained their hold on  the minds of the majority of philosophic thinkers. This can be partly  accounted for, as many of the Ptolemaic doctrines were at first  associated with the Copernican theory, nor was it until a later period  that they were eliminated from the system.    Though Copernicus deserved the credit of having transferred the centre  of our system from the Earth to the Sun, yet his theory was imperfect in  its details, and contained many inaccuracies. He believed that the  planets could only move round the Sun in circular paths, nor was he  capable of conceiving of any other form of orbit in which they could  perform their revolutions. He was therefore compelled to retain the use  of cycles and epicycles, in order to account for irregularities in the  uniformly circular motions of those bodies.    We are indebted to the genius of Kepler for having placed the Copernican  system upon a sure and irremovable basis, and for having raised  astronomy to the position of a true physical science. By his discovery  that the planets travel round the Sun in elliptical orbits, he was  enabled to abolish cycles and epicycles, which created such confusion  and entanglement in the system, and to explain many apparent  irregularities of motion by ascribing to the Sun his true position with  regard to the motions of the planets.    After the death of Kepler, which occurred in 1630, the most eminent  supporter of the Copernican theory was the illustrious Galileo, whose  belief in its accuracy and truthfulness was confirmed by his own  discoveries.    Five of the planets were known at this time--viz. Mercury, Venus, Mars,  Jupiter, and Saturn; the latter, which revolves in its orbit at a  profound distance from the Sun, formed what at that time was believed to  be the boundary of the planetary system. The distance of the Earth from  the Sun was approximately known, and the orb was observed to rotate on  his axis.    It was also ascertained that the Moon shone by reflected light, and that  her surface was varied by inequalities resembling those of our Earth.  The elliptical form of her orbit had been discovered by Horrox, and her  elements were computed with a certain degree of accuracy.    The cloudy luminosity of the Milky Way had been resolved into a  multitude of separate stars, disclosing the immensity of the stellar  universe.    The crescent form of the planet Venus, the satellites of Jupiter and of  Saturn, and the progressive motion and measurement of light, had also  been discovered. Observations were made of transits of Mercury and  Venus, and refracting and reflecting telescopes were invented.    The law of universal gravitation, a power which retains the Earth and  planets in their orbits, causing them year after year to describe with  unerring regularity their oval paths round the Sun, was not known at  this time. Though Newton was born in 1642, he did not disclose the  results of his philosophic investigations until 1687--thirteen years  after the death of Milton--when, in the 'Principia,' he announced his  discovery of the great law of universal gravitation.    Kepler, though he discovered the laws of planetary motion, was unable to  determine the motive force which guided and retained those bodies in  their orbits. It was reserved for the genius of Newton to solve this  wonderful problem. This great philosopher was able to prove 'that every  particle of matter in the universe attracts every other particle with a  force proportioned to the mass of the attracting body, and inversely as  the square of the distance between them.' Newton was capable of  demonstrating that the force which guides and retains the Earth and  planets in their orbits resides in the Sun, and by the application of  this law of gravitation he was able to explain the motions of all  celestial bodies entering into the structure of the solar system.    This discovery may be regarded as the crowning point of the science of  astronomy, for, upon the unfailing energy of this mysterious power  depend the order and stability of the universe, extending as it does to  all material bodies existing in space, guiding, controlling, and  retaining them in their several paths and orbits, whether it be a tiny  meteor, a circling planet, or a mighty sun.    The nature of cometary bodies and the laws which govern their motions  were at this time still enshrouded in mystery, and when one of those  erratic wanderers made its appearance in the sky it was beheld by the  majority of mankind with feelings of awe and superstitious dread, and  regarded as a harbinger of evil and disaster, the precursor of war, of  famine, or the overthrow of an empire.    Newton, however, was able to divest those bodies of the mystery with  which they were surrounded by proving that any conic section may be  described about the Sun, consistent with the law of gravitation, and  that comets, notwithstanding the eccentricity of their orbits, obey the  laws of planetary motion.    Beyond the confines of our solar system, little was known of the  magnitude and extent of the sidereal universe which occupies the  infinitude of space by which we are surrounded. The stars were  recognised as self-luminous bodies, inconceivably remote, and although  they excited the curiosity of observers, and conjectures were made as to  their origin, yet no conclusive opinions were arrived at with regard to  their nature"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28458"],[0,"What a Young Woman Ought to Know (#12)"],[1," less than the usual number of cells in the seeing areas, and the cells  were smaller, while the dogs which had been trained to discriminate  between tints and shades of color many times a day had a far greater  number of larger and more complex brain-cells in the seeing areas than  any dog of that age and species ever had before. \"Therefore,\" says  Professor Gates, \"mind activity creates organic structure.\"    Prof. Gates discovered other things of equal importance. He carried  his observations to successive generations, and found that the fifth  generation was born with a far greater number of brain-cells than  could be found in animals not descended from trained ancestors.    This is not only interesting, but of value. You will remember, in our  talk concerning your value, we spoke of your value to the race, and  learned that in cultivating yourself in any direction you were adding  to the welfare of future generations. That was only a general  statement, and now you can see how it can be. You see that if you can  make more brains for yourself you are also making more brains for your  posterity. Or if you fail to make brains for yourself, posterity will  in like degree be defrauded.    Many people have the idea that we are obliged to be satisfied with our  dower of mental ability, and so are excusable for failing to reach as  high a level as some others. If we really believed that we could  create brains we would not sit down and sigh over small mental  capacity, but go to work at once in building minds for ourselves.    And first, we must learn to control our thoughts and make them go  where we send them. In too many cases thoughts wander here and there,  with no power governing and guiding them.    When we are sauntering in the wood we sometimes come upon pathways,  and we know at once that many, many footsteps of men or animals have  been needed to make the paths. If those who walked here had wandered  each in his own way, no path would have been made. One pair of feet  going often over the same ground will make a path. So the thoughts,  traversing the same areas of brain, will make records on the  brain-cells which we may call paths. Every time a thought follows the  same line it creates a deeper impression, and makes it easier to go  over the same territory again. In this way habits are formed. If the  thoughts are good, the habits will be good; if evil, the habits will  be bad.    It is not hard to understand how much easier it is to form a habit  than to overcome it. The emotions, like the thoughts, create habits;  but, more than this, they create actual physical conditions.    It was my pleasure and profit once to have a conversation with  Professor Gates in his laboratory, and he showed me an instrument  wherein he condenses the breath. He then subjects it to a chemical  reagent, and by the precipitate formed he knows what was the mental  condition of the individual, whether he were angry, sorrowful or  remorseful. In five minutes after a fit of anger he finds the  excretory organs beginning to throw out the poison which anger has  created. Only five minutes suffice to create the poison, but half an  hour is none too much to eliminate it.    Think what must be the bodily state of one who is constantly irritated  or angry, who feels jealousy, hatred, or revenge. With body poisoned  by these malevolent passions he cannot feel well, for his physical  organs cannot do good work unless fed by pure blood. Professor Gates  finds that the benevolent emotions create life-giving germs in the  body; so, to love others is not only helpful to them, but it also  gives us new life.    Anger, worry, hatred, jealousy, are suicidal emotions. We cannot for  our own sakes afford to indulge in them, while from selfish reasons  alone we should be incited to kindness, generosity, sympathy, and  love.          CHAPTER XII.    YOU ARE MORE THAN BODY OR MIND.      We have talked of your body and your mind, but as yet not of yourself.  You are not body; you are not mind; but you possess both. You are  spirit, created by God, who is spirit; therefore you are His child.  You may not have thought much of this fact, but that has not changed  the fact. No failure to recognize God as your father changes His  relationship to you. No conduct of yours can make you any less His  child.    \"Well,\" you may say, \"if that is so, what does it matter, then, what I  do? If disobedience or sin cannot make me less God's child, why should  I be good and obedient?\" Because, dear heart, your conduct changes  your attitude towards Him. You might not know that I am your mother;  you might know it and choose to disobey my wishes; yet in both cases I  should still be your mother, and no more or less in one case than in  the other. But you will have no difficulty in understanding that in  one case you would be a loving, helpful, obedient daughter, a comfort  and delight to me; in the other, a disobedient, willful, unloving  daughter, a care and trouble.    We are God's children, each of us, dependent on His love and bounty  for protection, food, friends, intellect, even life. Is it dignified  and noble in us to ignore and disobey Him? Indeed the most worthy and  dignified thing we can do is to recognize ourselves as God's children  and be obedient. It is a wonderful glory to be a child of God. It  means that we have Godlike powers. The children of human parents are  like them in their capacities. Children of God must have capacities  that are Godlike.    This is true even of the most ignorant or degraded. They have in  themselves divine possibilities.    If you can get this thought fully engrafted into your consciousness,  it seems to me you can never willfully do wrong, can never condescend  to a mean or ignoble deed, because you recognize your divine  inheritance, and feel compelled by it to live truly, nobly.    Being children of God puts on us certain obligations towards Him, but  it also puts on God certain obligations towards us. \"What!\" you say;  \"God the Infinite under obligations to man, the finite? The Creator  under obligations to the created?\" Oh, yes.    We recognize the fact that human parents are under obligations to care  for their children, to protect them, to educate them, to give them  opportunities. Even such are the obligations of God towards His human  children, and He fulfills them. All our earthly blessings are from His  hand. Home, friends, shelter, food, are gifts of His love. He takes  such minute care of us that if for one second of time He would forget  us, we should be annihilated. He educates us. He does not send us away  to a boarding-school where we hear from Him but seldom, but He has a  home-school where He is both Father and Teacher, and His methods of  instruction are divinely wise.    The injudicious love of earthly parents often induces them to do for  their children things it would be far better to let the children do  for themselves. I once knew a boy of seven years, as intelligent as  the ordinary child, who had never been allowed to go down stairs alone  in his life for fear he would fall. This unwise care of the parents  had resulted in the child's being timid, fearful, and unable to care  for himself. He would cry if he fell, and would lie still sobbing  until some one came to pick him up and quiet him with caresses. At the  same time I saw a boy of four who could run up and down stairs, go to  the store alone to make purchases, and who, if he fell, would jump up  quickly, saying, \"O, that didn't hurt.\" Which child had been better  protected--the one who had been cared for by an overindulgent parent,  or the one who, by judicious stimulation to self-help, had learned to  care for himself?    God teaches us how to help ourselves, and circumstances of life which  we so often think hard and cruel are only the means by which we are  being trained to be strong. The things we call failure, worriment, and  hardship, are only the little tumbles by which we are learning to  walk.    The heathen philosopher, Seneca, says: \"God gives His best scholars  the hardest lessons.\" We know how proud we would feel if our  school-teacher would say, \"This is a hard problem, but I believe you  can solve it.\" We would be stimulated to work night and day to justify  his confidence in our ability. But when a little trial comes in life  we are quite apt to say, \"God is so hard in His dealings with me. Why  should He be so unkind?\" instead of saying: \"These hard things of life  are a test of my scholarship, and are an evidence of my Teacher's  confidence in my ability.\"    I would like you to get this thought fixed in your mind so firmly that  you will feel sure that all circumstances of life are but lessons in  God's great school, and, rightly used, will be the means of promoting  you to higher grades.    No scholar wants to stay always in the primary department because it  is easy there. He welcomes each promotion, although he knows it means  harder lessons and new difficulties. He looks forward to college or  university with pride, even though lessons grow harder and harder.    God's school of earthly life has in it all grades of advancement. Will  you be a studious, courageous scholar and try to learn life's lessons  well? It is such a wonderful thing to be a child of God, for that  means to be an heir of God, an heir of His wisdom, His strength, His  glory, His powers. \"All things are yours,\" says Paul; \"life, death,  things present and things to come, all are yours, and ye are Christ's,  and Christ is God's.\"          CHAPTER XIII.    SPECIAL PHYSIOLOGY.      With a feeling of reverence for ourselves we now take up the subject  of special physiology to learn what makes us women. In the study of  general physiology we find very few physical differences in the sexes,  but when we come to investigate what is called the reproductive system  we find entire difference of structure and of function.
