In some few instances, I have known the bees  to transfer the eggs from common to queen cells, and this _may_ be their  general method of procedure. I shall hazard the conjecture that the  queen deposits her eggs in cells on the edges of the comb, in a crowded  state of the hive, and that some of these are afterwards enlarged and  changed into royal cells by the workers. Such is the instinctive hatred  of the queen to her own kind, that it does not seem to me probable, that  she is intrusted with even the initiatory steps for securing a race of  successors. That the eggs from which the young queens are produced, are  of the same kind with those producing workers, has been repeatedly  demonstrated. On examining the queen cells while they are in progress,  one of the first things which excites our notice, is the very unusual  amount of attention bestowed upon them by the workers. There is scarcely  a second in which a bee is not peeping into them, and just as fast as  one is satisfied, another pops its head in, to examine if not to report,  progress. The importance of their inmates to the bee-community, might  easily be inferred from their being the center of so much attraction.      ROYAL JELLY.    The young queens are supplied with a much larger quantity of food than  is allotted to the other larvae, so that they seem almost to float in a  thick bed of jelly, and there is usually a portion of it left unconsumed  at the base of the cells, after the insects have arrived at maturity. It  is different from the food of either drones or workers, and in  appearance, resembles a light quince jelly, having a slightly acid  taste.    I submitted a portion of the royal jelly for analysis, to Dr. Charles M.  Wetherill, of Philadelphia; a very interesting account of his  examination may be found in the proceedings of the Phila. Academy of  Nat. Sciences for July, 1852. He speaks of the substance as \"truly a  bread-containing, albuminous compound.\" I hope in the course of the  coming summer to obtain from this able analytical chemist, an analysis  of the food of the young drones and workers. A comparison of its  elements with those of the royal jelly, may throw some light on subjects  as yet involved in obscurity.    The effects produced upon the larvae by this peculiar food and method of  treatment, are very remarkable. For one, I have never considered it  strange that such effects should be rejected as idle whims, by nearly  all except those who have either been eye-witnesses to them, or have  been well acquainted with the character and opportunities for accurate  observation, of those on whose testimony they have received them. They  are not only in themselves most marvelously strange, but on the face of  them so entirely opposed to all common analogies, and so very  improbable, that many men when asked to believe them, feel almost as  though an insult were offered to their common sense. The most important  of these effects, I shall now proceed to enumerate.    1st. The peculiar mode in which the worm designed to be reared as a  queen, is treated, causes it to arrive at maturity, about one-third  earlier than if it had been bred a worker. And yet it is to be much more  fully developed, and according to ordinary analogy, ought to have had a  _slower growth_!    2d. Its organs of reproduction are completely developed, so that it is  capable of fulfilling the office of a mother.    3d. Its size, shape and color are all greatly changed. (See p. 32.) Its  lower jaws are shorter, its head rounder, and its legs have neither  brushes nor baskets, while its sting is more curved, and one-third  longer than that of a worker.    4th. Its _instincts_ are entirely changed. Reared as a worker, it would  have been ready to thrust out its sting, upon the least provocation;  whereas now, it may be pulled limb from limb, without attempting to  sting. As a worker it would have treated a queen with the greatest  consideration; whereas now, if placed under a glass with another queen,  it rushes forthwith to mortal combat with its rival. As a worker, it  would frequently have left the hive, either for labor or exercise: as a  queen, after impregnation, it never leaves the hive except to accompany  a new swarm.    5th. The term of its life is remarkably lengthened. As a worker, it  would have lived not more than six or seven months at farthest; as a  queen it may live seven or eight times as long! All these wonders rest  on the impregnable basis of complete demonstration, and instead of being  witnessed by only a select few, may now, by the use of my hive, be  familiar sights to any bee keeper, who prefers to acquaint himself with  facts, rather than to cavil and sneer at the labors of others.[7]    When provision has been made, in the manner described, for a new race of  queens, the old mother always departs with the first swarm, before her  successors have arrived at maturity.[8]      ARTIFICIAL REARING OF QUEENS.    The distress of the bees when they lose their queen, has already been  described. If they have the means of supplying her loss, they soon calm  down, and commence forthwith, the necessary steps for rearing another.  The process of rearing queens artificially, to meet some special  emergency, is even more wonderful than the natural one, which has  already been described. Its success depends on the bees having  worker-eggs or worms not more than three days old; (if older, the larva  has been too far developed as a worker to admit of any change:) the bees  nibble away the partitions of two cells adjoining a third, so as to make  one large cell out of the three. They destroy the eggs or worms in two  of these cells, while they place before the occupant of the third, the  usual food of the young queens, and build out its cell, so as to give it  ample space for development. They do not confine themselves to the  attempt to rear a single queen, but to guard against failure, start a  considerable number, although the work on all except a few, is usually  soon discontinued.    In twelve or fourteen days, they are in possession of a new queen,  precisely similar to one reared in the natural way, while the eggs which  were laid at the same time in the adjoining cells, and which have been  developed in the usual way, are nearly a week longer in coming to  maturity.    I will give in this connection a description of an interesting  experiment:    A large hive which stood at a distance from any other colony, was  removed in the morning of a very pleasant day, to a new place, and  another hive containing only empty comb, was put upon its stand.  Thousands of workers which were out in the fields, or which left the old  hive after its removal, returned to the familiar spot. It was affecting  to witness their grief and despair: they flew in restless circles about  the place which once contained their happy home, entered and left the  new hive continually, expressing, in various ways, their lamentations  over their cruel bereavement. Towards evening, they ceased to take wing,  and roamed in restless platoons, in and out of the hive, and over its  surface, acting all the time, as though in search of some lost treasure.  I now gave them a piece of brood comb, containing worker eggs and worms,  taken from a second swarm which being just established with its young  queen, in a new hive, could have no intention of rearing young queens  that season; therefore, it cannot be contended that this piece of comb  contained what some are pleased to call \"royal eggs.\" What followed the  introduction of this brood comb, took place much quicker than it can be  described. The bees which first touched it, raised a peculiar note, and  in a moment, the comb was covered with a dense mass; their restless  motions and mournful noises ceased, and a cheerful hum at once attested  their delight! Despair gave place to hope, as they recognized in this  small piece of comb, the means of deliverance. Suppose a large building  filled with thousands of persons, tearing their hair, beating their  breasts, and by piteous cries, as well as frantic gestures, giving vent  to their despair; if now some one should enter this house of mourning,  and by a single word, cause all these demonstrations of agony to give  place to smiles and congratulations, the change could not be more  wonderful and instantaneous, than that produced when the bees received  the brood comb!    The Orientals call the honey bee, Deburrah, \"She that speaketh.\" Would  that this little insect might speak, and in words more eloquent than  those of man's device, to the multitudes who allow themselves to reject  the doctrines of revealed religion, because, as they assert, they are,  on their face so utterly improbable, that they labor under an _a priori_  objection strong enough to be fatal to their credibility. Do not nearly  all the steps in the development of a queen from a worker-egg, labor  under precisely the same objection? and have they not, for this very  reason, always been regarded by great numbers of bee keepers, as  unworthy of credence? If the favorite argument of infidels and errorists  will not stand the test when applied to the wonders of the bee-hive, can  it be regarded as entitled to any serious weight, when employed in  framing objections against religious truths, and arrogantly taking to  task the infinite Jehovah, for what He has been pleased to do or to  teach? Give me the same latitude claimed by such objectors, and I can  easily prove that a man is under no obligation to receive any of the  wonders in the economy of the bee-hive, although he is himself an  intelligent eye-witness that they are all substantial verities.    I shall quote, in this connection, from Huish, an English Apiarian of  whom I have already spoken, because his objections to the discoveries  of Huber, remind me so forcibly of both the spirit and "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24586"],[0,"The Story of My Life (#12)"],[1,"not drink, he very wisely said \"the others should not have it       either,\" and sent it back. How the Lord honours those who honour       Him. Rev. Dr. Strachan and several ladies and gentlemen assembled       to see the distribution of presents. The Christian Indians were       requested to separate from the others, that they might read and       sing. The company was much pleased, and Dr. Strachan prayed with       them. On the following Sabbath, the Dr. visited the Credit       settlement, and attended one of the meetings which was addressed by       Peter Jones. Dr. Strachan proposed their coming under the       superintendence of the Church of England; but after holding a       council, they declined, deciding to remain under the direction of       the Methodists.

How awful the       responsibility! How dreadful my condition if I violate my charge or       deal deceitfully with souls! Oh, God, assist me to declare Thy       whole counsel! and help me to instruct by example as well as       precept. How swiftly am I gliding down time's rapid stream! I am       daily reminded of the uncertainty and shortness of life. I went       to-day to visit a friend, and (as usual) smilingly came to the       door, when behold! all was mourning and sorrow! An infant son had       just taken its everlasting flight to the arms of Jesus. He was a       fine boy, active and promising, but he had suddenly gone to return       no more! The father's philosophy forsakes him now; parental feeling       has uncontrolled sway. I recommended religion as the only       sufficient support and comfort. I touched on the mysterious       government of God; that truly \"Clouds and darkness are round about       him.\" yet \"righteousness and judgment are the habitation of his       throne.\" I pointed out the happiness of the beloved babe, which       should lead us to devote our all to His service, that we might       eventually share in the unspeakable blessedness to which the lovely       infant is now raised.         _Aug. 10th._--My soul rejoices at the news I have heard from home,       that my eldest brother (George) has resolved to join the       Methodists, and become a missionary among the Indians. How       encouraging and comforting the thought that four of us are now       united in the same Church, and pursue the same glorious calling. My       Father has become reconciled, and my Mother is willing to part with       her sons for the sake of the Church of Christ.         _Aug. 14th--Sabbath._--Never did I feel my pride more mortified in       the discharge of public duty. I was desirous of delivering a       discourse, in Niagara, which would meet the approbation of all,       after carefully adjusting the subject, by the assistance of a       variety of authors; but through fatigue (having rode twelve miles),       and embarrassment, I was scarcely able to finish. My heart felt       hard and my mind barren, conscience reproached me that I had not       acted with a single eye to the glory of God. In the afternoon, I       threw myself on the mercy of God; my tongue was loosened and my       heart warmed. Surely, \"They that trust in the Lord shall not be       confounded.\"         _Aug. 17th._--This morning a lady died with whom I had considerable       conversation on the subject of Methodism, and on the propriety of       her daughters joining the society contrary to her wish. She       appeared to be satisfied with my account of the principles and       nature of Methodism, but did not like to acknowledge the propriety       of her daughters' proceedings, although her judgment seemed       convinced as I adverted to the principles of her own church. I am       informed that yesterday she said, \"The girls are right and I am       wrong.\" How comforting this must be to her daughters, who have       entirely overcome her opposition by their kindness, affection, and       gospel simplicity.         _Aug. 22nd._--Yesterday I delivered a discourse on the subject of       Missions, for the purpose of forming a Missionary Society in this       place (Niagara).         _September 3rd, 1825._--I took tea this afternoon at Youngstown,       U.S., for the first time.         _Sept. 6th._--Had the pleasure of meeting my brother to-day, whom I       have not seen for a year. How comforting to meet with those who are       not only near by the ties of nature, but much more by the changing       power of divine grace.         _Sept. 9th._--Have been greatly benefitted to-day by hearing Bishop       Hedding preach from Rev. iii. 5.         _Sept. 16th._--I bless God for what mine eyes hath seen, and mine       ears have heard to-day, being the first anniversary of the Canadian       Missionary Society. The Hon. John Willson, M.P.P., was requested to       take the chair. Several Indians, who had been brought to a       knowledge of the truth, through the efforts of this Society, were       present and spoke. How delightful to see the warlike Mohawk, and       the degraded Mississauga, exchanging the heathen war-whoop for the       sublime praise of the God of love! This is the commencement of       greater things which the Lord will do for the aboriginies of       Canada.         _Sept. 23rd._--I have this day received my appointment for York and       Yonge street. Never did I feel more sensibly the necessity of       Divine help. Help me, O God, to go forth in Thy strength, and       contend manfully under the banner of Christ! Amen.    FOOTNOTES:    [3] These voluminous diaries and journals are full of detail, chiefly of  Dr. Ryerson's religious experience. They are rich in illustration of the  severe mental and spiritual disciplinary process--self-imposed--through  which he passed during these eventful years of his earlier life. They  are singularly severe in their personal reflections upon his religious  shortcomings, and want of watchfulness. They are tinged with an  asceticism which largely characterized the religious experience of many  of the early Methodist preachers of Mr. Wesley's time--an asceticism  which strongly marked the Methodist biography and writings, which were  almost the only religious reading accessible to the devoted Methodist  pioneers of this country,--J. G. H.    [4] In a previous and subsequent chapter Dr. Ryerson refers more  particularly to this illness (pp. 28, 39, and elsewhere). It was a  turning point in his life, and decided him to enter the ministry on his  twenty-second birthday.--J. G. H.    [5] Dr. Ryerson refers in another chapter to the overtures which were  made to him at this time to enter the ministry of the Church of  England.--J. G. H.          CHAPTER III.    1825-1826.    First Year of my Ministry and First Controversy.      My first appointment after my admission on trial was to the (what was  then called the York and Yonge Street Circuit), which then embraced the  Town of York (now the City of Toronto) Weston, the Townships of Vaughan,  King, West Gwillimbury, North Gwillimbury, East Gwillimbury, Whitchurch,  Markham, Pickering, Scarboro', and York, over which we travelled, and  preached from twenty-five to thirty-five sermons in four weeks,  preaching generally three times on Sabbath and attending three class  meetings, besides preaching and attending class meetings on week days.  The roads were (if in any place they could be called roads) bad beyond  description; could only be travelled on horse-back, and on foot; the  labours hard, and the accommodations of the most primitive kind; but we  were received as angels of God by the people, our ministrations being  almost the only supply of religious instruction to them; and nothing  they valued more than to have the preacher partake of their humble and  best hospitality.    It was during the latter part of this the first year of my itinerant  ministry (April and May, 1826) that I was drawn and forced into the  controversy on the Clergy Reserves and equal civil and religious rights  and privileges among all religious persuasions in Upper Canada.[6] There  had been some controversy between the leaders of the Churches of England  and Scotland on their comparative standing as established churches in  Upper Canada. In my earliest years, I had read and studied Blackstone's  Commentaries on the laws of England, especially the rights of the Crown,  and Parliament and Subject, Paley's Moral and Political Philosophy; and  when I read and observed the character of the policy, and state of  things in Canada, I felt that it was not according to the principles of  British liberty, or of the British Constitution; but I had not the  slightest idea of writing anything on the subject.    At this juncture, (April, 1826,) a publication appeared, entitled  \"Sermon Preached and Published by the Venerable Archdeacon of York, in  May, 1826, on the Death of the Late Bishop of Quebec,\" containing a  sketch of the rise and progress of the Church of England in these  provinces, and an appeal on behalf of that Church to the British  Government and Parliament. In stating the obstacles which impeded the  progress of the Church of England in Upper Canada, the memorable Author  of the able discourse attacked the character of the religious  persuasions not connected with the Church of England, especially the  Methodists, whose ministers were represented as American in their origin  and feelings, ignorant, forsaking their proper employments to preach  what they did not understand, and which, from their pride, they  disdained to learn; and were spreading disaffection to the civil and  religious"]]]
