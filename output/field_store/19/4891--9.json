At the beginning of the combustion, there is  a slight augmentation in the volume of the air in the bell-glass, from  the dilatation caused by the heat; but, presently afterwards, a rapid  diminution of the air takes place, and the mercury rises in the glass;  insomuch that, when the quantity of iron is sufficient, and the air  operated upon is very pure, almost the whole air employed is absorbed.    It is proper to remark in this place, that, unless in making experiments  for the purpose of discovery, it is better to be contented with burning  a moderate quantity of iron; for, when this experiment is pushed too  far, so as to absorb much of the air, the cup D, which floats upon the  quicksilver, approaches too near the bottom of the bell-glass; and the  great heat produced, which is followed by a very sudden cooling,  occasioned by the contact of the cold mercury, is apt to break the  glass. In which case, the sudden fall of the column of mercury, which  happens the moment the least flaw is produced in the glass, causes such  a wave, as throws a great part of the quicksilver from the bason. To  avoid this inconvenience, and to ensure success to the experiment, one  gross and a half of iron is sufficient to burn in a bell-glass, which  holds about eight pints of air. The glass ought likewise to be strong,  that it may be able to bear the weight of the column of mercury which it  has to support.    By this experiment, it is not possible to determine, at one time, both  the additional weight acquired by the iron, and the changes which have  taken place in the air. If it is wished to ascertain what additional  weight has been gained by the iron, and the proportion between that and  the air absorbed, we must carefully mark upon the bell-glass, with a  diamond, the height of the mercury, both before and after the  experiment[9]. After this, the syphon (GH, Pl. IV. fig. 3.) guarded, as  before, with a bit of paper, to prevent its filling with mercury, is to  be introduced under the bell-glass, having the thumb placed upon the  extremity, G, of the syphon, to regulate the passage of the air; and by  this means the air is gradually admitted, so as to let the mercury fall  to its level. This being done, the bell-glass is to be carefully  removed, the globules of melted iron contained in the cup, and those  which have been scattered about, and swim upon the mercury, are to be  accurately collected, and the whole is to be weighed. The iron will be  found in that state called _martial ethiops_ by the old chemists,  possessing a degree of metallic brilliancy, very friable, and readily  reducible into powder, under the hammer, or with a pestle and mortar. If  the experiment has succeeded well, from 100 grains of iron will be  obtained 135 or 136 grains of ethiops, which is an augmentation of 35  per cent.    If all the attention has been paid to this experiment which it deserves,  the air will be found diminished in weight exactly equal to what the  iron has gained. Having therefore burnt 100 grains of iron, which has  acquired an additional weight of 35 grains, the diminution of air will  be found exactly 70 cubical inches; and it will be found, in the sequel,  that the weight of vital air is pretty nearly half a grain for each  cubical inch; so that, in effect, the augmentation of weight in the one  exactly coincides with the loss of it in the other.    I shall observe here, once for all, that, in every experiment of this  kind, the pressure and temperature of the air, both before and after the  experiment, must be reduced, by calculation, to a common standard of 10  deg. (54.5 deg.) of the thermometer, and 28 inches of the barometer.  Towards the end of this work, the manner of performing this very  necessary reduction will be found accurately detailed.    If it be required to examine the nature of the air which remains after  this experiment, we must operate in a somewhat different manner. After  the combustion is finished, and the vessels have cooled, we first take  out the cup, and the burnt iron, by introducing the hand through the  quicksilver, under the bell-glass; we next introduce some solution of  potash, or caustic alkali, or of the sulphuret of potash, or such other  substance as is judged proper for examining their action upon the  residuum of air. I shall, in the sequel, give an account of these  methods of analysing air, when I have explained the nature of these  different substances, which are only here in a manner accidentally  mentioned. After this examination, so much water must be let into the  glass as will displace the quicksilver, and then, by means of a shallow  dish placed below the bell-glass, it is to be removed into the common  water pneumato-chemical apparatus, where the air remaining may be  examined at large, and with great facility.    When very soft and very pure iron has been employed in this experiment,  and, if the combustion has been performed in the purest respirable or  vital air, free from all admixture of the noxious or mephitic part, the  air which remains after the combustion will be found as pure as it was  before; but it is difficult to find iron entirely free from a small  portion of charry matter, which is chiefly abundant in steel. It is  likewise exceedingly difficult to procure the pure air perfectly free  from some admixture of mephitis, with which it is almost always  contaminated; but this species of noxious air does not, in the smallest  degree, disturb the result of the experiment, as it is always found at  the end exactly in the same proportion as at the beginning.    I mentioned before, that we have two ways of determining the constituent  parts of atmospheric air, the method of analysis, and that by synthesis.  The calcination of mercury has furnished us with an example of each of  these methods, since, after having robbed the respirable part of its  base, by means of the mercury, we have restored it, so as to recompose  an air precisely similar to that of the atmosphere. But we can equally  accomplish this synthetic composition of atmospheric air, by borrowing  the materials of which it is composed from different kingdoms of nature.  We shall see hereafter that, when animal substances are dissolved in the  nitric acid, a great quantity of gas is disengaged, which extinguishes  light, and is unfit for animal respiration, being exactly similar to the  noxious or mephitic part of atmospheric air. And, if we take 73 parts,  by weight, of this elastic fluid, and mix it with 27 parts of highly  respirable air, procured from calcined mercury, we will form an elastic  fluid precisely similar to atmospheric air in all its properties.    There are many other methods of separating the respirable from the  noxious part of the atmospheric air, which cannot be taken notice of in  this part, without anticipating information, which properly belongs to  the subsequent chapters. The experiments already adduced may suffice for  an elementary treatise; and, in matters of this nature, the choice of  our evidences is of far greater consequence than their number.    I shall close this article, by pointing out the property which  atmospheric air, and all the known gasses, possess of dissolving water,  which is of great consequence to be attended to in all experiments of  this nature. Mr Saussure found, by experiment, that a cubical foot of  atmospheric air is capable of holding 12 grains of water in solution:  Other gasses, as the carbonic acid, appear capable of dissolving a  greater quantity; but experiments are still wanting by which to  determine their several proportions. This water, held in solution by  gasses, gives rise to particular phenomena in many experiments, which  require great attention, and which has frequently proved the source of  great errors to chemists in determining the results of their  experiments.    FOOTNOTES:    [9] It will likewise be necessary to take care that the air contained in  the glass, both before and after the experiment, be reduced to a common  temperature and pressure, otherwise the results of the following  calculations will be fallacious.--E.          CHAP. IV.    _Nomenclature of the several Constituent Parts of Atmospheric Air._      Hitherto I have been obliged to make use of circumlocution, to express  the nature of the several substances which constitute our atmosphere,  having provisionally used the terms of _respirable_ and _noxious_, or  _non-respirable parts of the air_. But the investigations I mean to  undertake require a more direct mode of expression; and, having now  endeavoured to give simple and distinct ideas of the different  substances which enter into the composition of the atmosphere, I shall  henceforth express these ideas by words equally simple.    The temperature of our earth being very near to that at which water  becomes solid, and reciprocally changes from solid to fluid, and as this  phenomenon takes place frequently under our observation, it has very  naturally followed, that, in the languages of at least every climate  subjected to any degree of winter, a term has been used for signifying  water in the state of solidity, when deprived of its caloric. The same,  however, has not been found necessary with respect to water reduced to  the state of vapour by an additional dose of caloric; since those  persons who do not make a particular study of objects of this kind, are  still ignorant that water, when in a temperature only a little above the  boiling heat, is changed into an elastic aeriform fluid, susceptible,  like all other gasses, of being received and contained in vessels, and  preserving its gasseous form so long as it remains at the temperature of  80 deg. (212 deg.), and under a pressure not exceeding 28 inches of the  mercurial barometer. As this phenomenon has not been generally observed,  no language has used a particular term for"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/308"],[0,"Three Men in a Boat (To Say Nothing of the Dog) (#12)"],[1," remember to have  seen Moulsey Lock, before, with only one boat in it.  It is, I suppose,  Boulter's not even excepted, the busiest lock on the river.    I have stood and watched it, sometimes, when you could not see any water  at all, but only a brilliant tangle of bright blazers, and gay caps, and  saucy hats, and many-coloured parasols, and silken rugs, and cloaks, and  streaming ribbons, and dainty whites; when looking down into the lock  from the quay, you might fancy it was a huge box into which flowers of  every hue and shade had been thrown pell-mell, and lay piled up in a  rainbow heap, that covered every corner.    On a fine Sunday it presents this appearance nearly all day long, while,  up the stream, and down the stream, lie, waiting their turn, outside the  gates, long lines of still more boats; and boats are drawing near and  passing away, so that the sunny river, from the Palace up to Hampton  Church, is dotted and decked with yellow, and blue, and orange, and  white, and red, and pink.  All the inhabitants of Hampton and Moulsey  dress themselves up in boating costume, and come and mouch round the lock  with their dogs, and flirt, and smoke, and watch the boats; and,  altogether, what with the caps and jackets of the men, the pretty  coloured dresses of the women, the excited dogs, the moving boats, the  white sails, the pleasant landscape, and the sparkling water, it is one  of the gayest sights I know of near this dull old London town.    The river affords a good opportunity for dress.  For once in a way, we  men are able to show _our_ taste in colours, and I think we come out very  natty, if you ask me.  I always like a little red in my things--red and  black.  You know my hair is a sort of golden brown, rather a pretty shade  I've been told, and a dark red matches it beautifully; and then I always  think a light-blue necktie goes so well with it, and a pair of those  Russian-leather shoes and a red silk handkerchief round the waist--a  handkerchief looks so much better than a belt.    Harris always keeps to shades or mixtures of orange or yellow, but I  don't think he is at all wise in this.  His complexion is too dark for  yellows.  Yellows don't suit him: there can be no question about it.  I  want him to take to blue as a background, with white or cream for relief;  but, there! the less taste a person has in dress, the more obstinate he  always seems to be.  It is a great pity, because he will never be a  success as it is, while there are one or two colours in which he might  not really look so bad, with his hat on.    George has bought some new things for this trip, and I'm rather vexed  about them.  The blazer is loud.  I should not like George to know that I  thought so, but there really is no other word for it.  He brought it home  and showed it to us on Thursday evening.  We asked him what colour he  called it, and he said he didn't know.  He didn't think there was a name  for the colour.  The man had told him it was an Oriental design.  George  put it on, and asked us what we thought of it.  Harris said that, as an  object to hang over a flower-bed in early spring to frighten the birds  away, he should respect it; but that, considered as an article of dress  for any human being, except a Margate nigger, it made him ill.  George  got quite huffy; but, as Harris said, if he didn't want his opinion, why  did he ask for it?    What troubles Harris and myself, with regard to it, is that we are afraid  it will attract attention to the boat.    [Picture: Young lady] Girls, also, don't look half bad in a boat, if  prettily dressed.  Nothing is more fetching, to my thinking, than a  tasteful boating costume.  But a \"boating costume,\" it would be as well  if all ladies would understand, ought to be a costume that can be worn in  a boat, and not merely under a glass-case.  It utterly spoils an  excursion if you have folk in the boat who are thinking all the time a  good deal more of their dress than of the trip.  It was my misfortune  once to go for a water picnic with two ladies of this kind.  We did have  a lively time!    They were both beautifully got up--all lace and silky stuff, and flowers,  and ribbons, and dainty shoes, and light gloves.  But they were dressed  for a photographic studio, not for a river picnic.  They were the  \"boating costumes\" of a French fashion-plate.  It was ridiculous, fooling  about in them anywhere near real earth, air, and water.    The first thing was that they thought the boat was not clean.  We dusted  all the seats for them, and then assured them that it was, but they  didn't believe us.  One of them rubbed the cushion with the forefinger of  her glove, and showed the result to the other, and they both sighed, and  sat down, with the air of early Christian martyrs trying to make  themselves comfortable up against the stake.  You are liable to  occasionally splash a little when sculling, and it appeared that a drop  of water ruined those costumes.  The mark never came out, and a stain was  left on the dress for ever.    I was stroke.  I did my best.  I feathered some two feet high, and I  paused at the end of each stroke to let the blades drip before returning  them, and I picked out a smooth bit of water to drop them into again each  time.  (Bow said, after a while, that he did not feel himself a  sufficiently accomplished oarsman to pull with me, but that he would sit  still, if I would allow him, and study my stroke.  He said it interested  him.)  But, notwithstanding all this, and try as I would, I could not  help an occasional flicker of water from going over those dresses.    The girls did not complain, but they huddled up close together, and set  their lips firm, and every time a drop touched them, they visibly shrank  and shuddered.  It was a noble sight to see them suffering thus in  silence, but it unnerved me altogether.  I am too sensitive.  I got wild  and fitful in my rowing, and splashed more and more, the harder I tried  not to.    I gave it up at last; I said I'd row bow.  Bow thought the arrangement  would be better too, and we changed places.  The ladies gave an  involuntary sigh of relief when they saw me go, and quite brightened up  for a moment.  Poor girls! they had better have put up with me.  The man  they had got now was a jolly, light-hearted, thick-headed sort of a chap,  with about as much sensitiveness in him as there might be in a  Newfoundland puppy.  You might look daggers at him for an hour and he  would not notice it, and it would not trouble him if he did.  He set a  good, rollicking, dashing stroke that sent the spray playing all over the  boat like a fountain, and made the whole crowd sit up straight in no  time.  When he spread more than pint of water over one of those dresses,  he would give a pleasant little laugh, and say:    \"I beg your pardon, I'm sure;\" and offer them his handkerchief to wipe it  off with.    \"Oh, it's of no consequence,\" the poor girls would murmur in reply, and  covertly draw rugs and coats over themselves, and try and protect  themselves with their lace parasols.    At lunch they had a very bad time of it.  People wanted them to sit on  the grass, and the grass was dusty; and the tree-trunks, against which  they were invited to lean, did not appear to have been brushed for weeks;  so they spread their handkerchiefs on the ground and sat on those, bolt  upright.  Somebody, in walking about with a plate of beef-steak pie,  tripped up over a root, and sent the pie flying.  None of it went over  them, fortunately, but the accident suggested a fresh danger to them, and  agitated them; and, whenever anybody moved about, after that, with  anything in his hand that could fall and make a mess, they watched that  person with growing anxiety until he sat down again.                              [Picture: Washing up]    \"Now then, you girls,\" said our friend Bow to them, cheerily, after it  was all over, \"come along, you've got to wash up!\"    They didn't understand him at first.  When they grasped the idea, they  said they feared they did not know how to wash up.    \"Oh, I'll soon show you,\" he cried; \"it's rare fun!  You lie down on  your--I mean you lean over the bank, you know, and sloush the things  about in the water.\"    The elder sister said that she was afraid that they hadn't got on dresses  suited to the work.    \"Oh, they'll be all right,\" said he light-heartedly; \"tuck 'em up.\"    And he made them do it, too.  He told them that that sort of thing was  half the fun of a picnic.  They said it was very interesting.    Now I come to think it over, was that young man as dense-headed as we  thought? or was he--no, impossible! there was such a simple, child-like  expression about him!    Harris wanted to get out at Hampton Church, to go and see Mrs. Thomas's  tomb.    \"Who is Mrs. Thomas?\" I asked.    \"How should I know?\" replied Harris.  \"She's a lady that's got a funny  tomb, and I want to see it.\"    I objected.  I don't know whether it is that I am built wrong, but I  never did seem to hanker after tombstones myself.  I know that the proper  thing to do, when you get to a village or town, is to rush off to the  churchyard, and enjoy the graves; but it is a recreation that I always  deny myself.  I take no interest in creeping round dim and chilly  churches behind wheezy old men, and reading epitaphs.  Not even the sight  of a bit of cracked brass let into a stone affords me what I call real  happiness.    I shock respectable sextons by the imperturbability I am able to assume  before exciting inscriptions, and by my lack of enthusiasm for the local  family history, while my ill-concealed anxiety to get outside wounds  their feelings.    One golden morning of a sunny day, I leant against the low stone wall  that guarded a little village church, and I smoked, and drank in deep,  calm gladness from the sweet, restful scene--the grey old church with its  clustering ivy and its quaint carved"]]]
