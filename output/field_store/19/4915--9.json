[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3284"],[0,"The Discovery of the Source of the Nile (#12)"],[1,"merely a passing ill-wind which would soon blow over; but  before long the two disputants were tonguing it again, and I distinctly  heard Bombay ordering Baraka out of camp as he could not keep from  intermeddling, saying, which was true, he had invited him to join the  expedition, that his knowledge of Hindustani might be useful to us; he  was not wanted for any other purpose, and unless he was satisfied with  doing that alone, we would get on much better without him. To this  provocation Baraka mildly made the retort, \"Pray don't put yourself in  a passion, nobody is hurting you, it is all in your own heart, which is  full of suspicions and jealousy without the slightest cause.\"    This complicated matters more than ever. I knew Bombay to be a generous,  honest man, entitled by his former services to be in the position he was  now holding as fundi, or supervisor in the camp. Baraka, who never  would have joined the expedition excepting through his invitation, was  indebted to him for the rank he now enjoyed--a command over seventy men,  a duty in which he might have distinguished himself as a most useful  accessory to the camp. Again I called the two together, and begged them  to act in harmony like brothers, noticing that there was no cause for  entertaining jealousy on either side, as every order rested with myself  to reward for merit or to punish. The relative position in the camp was  like that of the senior officers in India, Bombay representing the  Mulki lord, or Governor-General, and Baraka the Jungi lord, or  Commander-in-Chief. To the influence of this distinguished comparison  they both gave way, acknowledging myself their judge, and both  protesting that they wished to serve in peace and quietness for the  benefit of the march.    Zungomero is a terminus or junction of two roads leading to the  interior--one, the northern, crossing over the Goma Pass, and trenching  on the Mukondokua river, and the other crossing over the Mabruki Pass,  and edging on the Ruaha river. They both unite again at Ugogi, the  western terminus on the present great Unyamuezi line. On the former  expedition I went by the northern line and returned by the southern,  finding both equally easy, and, indeed, neither is worthy of special and  permanent preference. In fact, every season makes a difference in the  supply of water and provisions; and with every year, owing to incessant  wars, or rather slave-hunts, the habitations of the wretched inhabitants  become constantly changed--generally speaking, for the worse. Our first  and last object, therefore, as might be supposed, from knowing these  circumstances, was to ascertain, before mounting the hill-range, which  route would afford us the best facilities for a speedy march now. No  one, however, could or would advise us. The whole country on ahead,  especially Ugogo, was oppressed by drought and famine. To avoid this  latter country, then, we selected the southern route, as by doing so it  was hoped we might follow the course of the Ruaha river from Maroro  to Usenga and Usanga, and thence strike across to Unyanyembe, sweeping  clear of Ugogo.    With this determination, after despatching a third set of specimens,  consisting of large game animals, birds, snakes, insects, land  and freshwater shells, and a few rock specimens, of which one was  fossiliferous, we turned southwards, penetrating the forests which lie  between the greater range and the little outlying one. At the foot of  this is the Maji ya Wheta, a hot, deep-seated spring of fresh water,  which bubbles up through many apertures in a large dome-shaped heap  of soft lime--an accumulation obviously thrown up by the force of the  spring, as the rocks on either side of it are of igneous character.  We arrived at the deserted village of Kirengue. This was not an easy  go-ahead march, for the halt had disaffected both men and mules. Three  of the former bolted, leaving their loads upon the ground; and on the  line of march, one of the mules, a full-conditioned animal, gave up the  ghost after an eighteen hours' sickness. What his disease was I never  could ascertain; but as all the remaining animals died afterwards much  in the same manner, I may state for once and for all, that these attacks  commenced with general swelling, at first on the face, then down the  neck, along the belly and down the legs. It proved so obstinate that  fire had no effect upon it; and although we cut off the tails of some to  relieve them by bleeding, still they died.    In former days Kirengue was inhabited, and we reasonably hoped to find  some supplies for the jungly march before us. But we had calculated  without our host, for the slave-hunters had driven every vestige of  humanity away; and now, as we were delayed by our three loads behind,  there was nothing left but to send back and purchase more grain. Such  was one of the many days frittered away in do-nothingness.    This day, all together again, we rose the first spurs of the well-wooded  Usagara hills, amongst which the familiar bamboo was plentiful, and at  night we bivouacked in the jungle.    Rising betimes in the morning, and starting with a good will, we soon  reached the first settlements of Mbuiga, from which could be seen a  curious blue mountain, standing up like a giant overlooking all the  rest of the hills. The scenery here formed a strong and very pleasing  contrast to any we had seen since leaving the coast. Emigrant Waziraha,  who had been driven from their homes across the Kingani river by the  slave-hunters, had taken possession of the place, and disposed their  little conical-hut villages on the heights of the hill-spurs in such a  picturesque manner, that one could not help hoping they would here at  least be allowed to rest in peace and quietness. The valleys, watered  by little brooks, are far richer, and even prettier, than the high  lands above, being lined with fine trees and evergreen shrubs; while the  general state of prosperity was such, that the people could afford, even  at this late season of the year, to turn their corn into malt to brew  beer for sale; and goats and fowls were plentiful in the market.    Passing by the old village of Mbuiga, which I occupied on my former  expedition, we entered some huts on the western flank of the Mbuiga  district; and here, finding a coast-man, a great friend of the little  sheikh's, willing to take back to Zanzibar anything we might give him, a  halt was made, and I drew up my reports. I then consigned to his  charge three of the most sickly of the Hottentots in a deplorable  condition--one of the mules, that they might ride by turns--and all  the specimens that had been collected. With regret I also sent back the  camera; because I saw, had I allowed my companion to keep working it,  the heat he was subjected to in the little tent whilst preparing  and fixing his plates would very soon have killed him. The number of  guinea-fowl seen here was most surprising.    A little lighter and much more comfortable for the good riddance of  those grumbling \"Tots,\" we worked up to and soon breasted the stiff  ascent of the Mabruki Pass, which we surmounted without much difficult.  This concluded the first range of these Usagara hills; and once over, we  dropped down to the elevated valley of Makata, where we halted two days  to shoot. As a travelling Arab informed me that the whole of the Maroro  district had been laid waste by the marauding Wahehe, I changed our  plans again, and directed our attention to a middle and entirely new  line, which in the end would lead us to Ugogi. The first and only  giraffe killed upon the journey was here shot by Grant, with a little  40-gauge Lancaster rifle, at 200 yards' distance. Some smaller animals  were killed; but I wasted all my time in fruitlessly stalking some  wounded striped eland--magnificent animals, as large as Delhi oxen--and  some other animals, of which I wounded three, about the size of  hartebeest, and much their shape, only cream-coloured, with a  conspicuous black spot in the centre of each flank. The eland may  probably be the animal first mentioned by Livingstone, but the other  animal is not known.    Though reluctant to leave a place where such rare animals were to be  found, the fear of remaining longer on the road induced us to leave  Kikobogo, and at a good stride we crossed the flat valley of Makata, and  ascended the higher lands beyond, where we no sooner arrived than we  met the last down trader from Unyamuezi, well known to all my men as  the great Mamba or Crocodile. Mamba, dressed in a dirty Arab gown, with  coronet of lion's nails decorating a thread-bare cutch cap, greeted us  with all the dignity of a savage potentate surrounded by his staff  of half-naked officials. As usual, he had been the last to leave the  Unyamuezi, and so purchased all his stock of ivory at a cheap rate,  there being no competitors left to raise the value of that commodity;  but his journey had been a very trying one. With a party, at his own  estimate, of two thousand souls--we did not see anything like that  number--he had come from Ugogo to this, by his own confession, living on  the products of the jungle, and by boiling down the skin aprons of his  porters occasionally for a soup. Famines were raging throughout the  land, and the Arabs preceding him had so harried the country, that every  village was deserted. On hearing our intention to march upon the direct  line, he frankly said he thought we should never get through for my men  could not travel as he had done, and therefore he advised our deflecting  northwards from New Mbumi to join the track leading from Rumuma to  Ugogi. This was a sad disappointment; but, rather than risk a failure, I  resolved to follow his advice.    After reaching the elevated ground, we marched over rolling tops,  covered with small trees and a rich variety of pretty bulbs, and reached  the habitations of Muhanda, where we no sooner "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3287"],[0,"The Man from Glengarry: A Tale of the Ottawa (#12)"],[1," Hughie,\" she said; \"we cannot send  men out to the woods that cannot eat breakfast, can we, Ranald?\"    Hughie at once fell upon his porridge with vigor, while Ranald, who was  much too shy to eat at the minister's table, sat and waited.    After breakfast was over, Jessie was called in for the morning worship,  without which no day was ever begun in the manse. At worship in the  minister's house every one present took part. It was Hughie's special  joy to lead the singing of the psalm. His voice rose high and clear,  even above his mother's, for he loved to sing, and Ranald's presence  inspired him to do his best. Ranald had often heard the psalm sung in  the church--            I to the hills will lift mine eyes,        From whence doth come mine aid;      and the tune was the old, familiar \"French,\" but somehow it was all new  to him that day. The fresh voices and the crisp, prompt movement of the  tune made Ranald feel as if he had never heard the psalm sung before. In  the reading he took his verse with the others, stumbling a little, not  because the words were too big for him, but because they seemed to run  into one another. The chapter for the day contained Paul's injunction to  Timothy, urging him to fidelity and courage as a good soldier of Jesus  Christ.    When the reading was done, Mrs. Murray told them a story of a young man  who had shed his blood upon a Scottish moor because he was too brave to  be untrue to his lord, and then, in a few words, made them all see  that still some conflict was being waged, and that there was still  opportunity for each to display loyal courage and fidelity.    In the prayer that followed, the first thing that surprised Ranald was  the absence of the set forms and tones of prayer, with which he was  familiar. It was all so simple and real. The mother was telling the  great Father in heaven her cares and anxieties, and the day's needs  for them all, sure that he would understand and answer. Every one was  remembered--the absent head of the family and those present; the young  man worshiping with them, that he might be a true man and a good soldier  of Jesus Christ; and at the close, the little lad going away this  morning, that he might be kept from all harm and from all evil thoughts  and deeds. The simple beauty of the words, the music in the voice, and  the tender, trustful feeling that breathed through the prayer awakened  in Ranald's heart emotions and longings he had never known before, and  he rose from his knees feeling how wicked and how cruel a thing it would  be to cause one of these little ones to stumble.    After the worship was over, Hughie seized his Scotch bonnet and rushed  for the jumper, and in a few minutes his mother had all the space not  taken up by him and Ranald packed with blankets and baskets.    \"Jessie thinks that even great shanty-men like you and Don and Hughie  will not object to something better than bread and pork.\"    \"Indeed, we will not,\" said Ranald, heartily.    Then Hughie suddenly remembered that he was actually leaving home, and  climbing out of the jumper, he rushed at his mother.    \"Oh, mother, good by!\" he cried.    His mother stooped and put her arms about him. \"Good by, my darling,\"  she said, in a low voice; \"I trust you to be a good boy, and, Hughie,  don't forget your prayers.\"    Then came to Hughie, for the first time, the thought that had been in  the mother's heart all the morning, that when night came he would lie  down to sleep, for the first time in his life, without the nightly story  and her good-night kiss.    \"Mother,\" whispered the little lad, holding her tight about the neck,  \"won't you come, too? I don't think I like to go away.\"    He could have said no more comforting word, and the mother, whose heart  had been sore enough with her first parting from her boy, was more than  glad to find that the pain was not all on her side; so she kissed him  again, and said, in a cheery voice: \"Now have a good time. Don't trouble  Ranald too much, and bring me back some sugar.\" Her last word braced the  lad as nothing else could.    \"Oh, mother, I'll bring you heaps!\" he cried, and with the vision of  what he would bring home again shining vividly before his eyes, he got  through the parting without tears, and was soon speeding down the lane  beside Ranald, in the jumper.    The mother stood and watched the little figure holding tight to Ranald  with one hand, and with the other waving frantically his bonnet by the  tails, till at last the bush hid him from her sight. Then she turned  back again to the house that seemed so empty, with her hand pressed hard  against her side and her lip quivering as with sharp pain.    \"How foolish!\" she said, impatiently to herself; \"he will be home in two  days.\" But in spite of herself she went again to the door, and looked  long at the spot where the bush swallowed up the road. Then she went  upstairs and shut her door, and when she came down again there was that  in her face that told that her heart had had its first touch of the  sword that, sooner or later, must pierce all mothers' hearts.        CHAPTER VII    MAIMIE      Before Hughie came back from the sugar camp, the minister had returned  from the presbytery, bringing with him his wife's niece, Maimie St.  Clair, who had come from her home in a Western city to meet him. Her  father, Eugene St. Clair, was president of Raymond and St. Clair Lumber  Company. Nineteen years before this time he had married Mrs. Murray's  eldest sister, and established his home with every prospect of a  prosperous and happy life, but after three short, bright years of almost  perfect joy, his young wife, his heart's idol, after two days' illness,  fluttered out from her beautiful home, leaving with her broken-hearted  husband her little boy and a baby girl two weeks old. Then Eugene St.  Clair besought his sister to come out from England and preside over his  home and care for his children; and that he might forget his grief, he  gave himself, heart and mind, to his business. Wealth came to him, and  under his sister's rule his home became a place of cultured elegance and  a center of fashionable pleasure.    Miss Frances St. Clair was a woman of the world, proud of her  family-tree, whose root disappeared in the depths of past centuries, and  devoted to the pursuit and cultivation of those graces and manners that  are supposed to distinguish people of birth and breeding from the common  sort. Indeed, from common men and things she shrank almost with horror.  The entrance of \"trade\" into the social sphere of her life she would  regard as an impertinent intrusion. It was as much as she could bear  to allow the approach of \"commerce,\" which her brother represented. She  supposed, of course, there must be people to carry on the trades and  industries of the country--very worthy people, too--but these were  people one could not be expected to know. Miss St. Clair thanked heaven  that she had had the advantages of an English education and up-bringing,  and she lamented the stubborn democratic opinions of her brother,  who insisted that Harry should attend the public school. She was not  surprised, therefore, though greatly grieved, that Harry chose his  friends in school with a fine disregard of \"their people.\" It was with  surprise amounting to pain that she found herself one day introduced by  her nephew to Billie Barclay, who turned out to be the son of Harry's  favorite confectioner. To his aunt's remonstrance it seemed to Harry a  sufficient reply that Billy was a \"brick\" and a shining \"quarter\" on the  school Rugby team.    \"But, Harry, think of his people!\" urged his aunt.    \"Oh, rot!\" replied her irreverent nephew; \"I don't play with his  people.\"    \"Yes, but Harry, you don't expect to make him your friend?\"    \"But he is my friend, and I don't care what his people are. Besides, I  think his governor is a fine old boy, and I know he gives us jolly good  taffy.\"    \"But, Harry,\" answered his aunt, in despair, \"you are positively  dreadful. Why can't you make friends in your own set? There is Hubert  Evans and the Langford boys.\"    \"Evans!\" snorted Harry, with contempt; \"beastly snob, and the Langfords  are regular Mollies!\" Whereupon Miss St. Clair gave up her nephew as  impossible. But Billie did not repeat his visit to his friend Harry's  home. Miss Frances St. Clair had a way of looking through her pince-nez  that even a boy could understand and would seek to avoid.    With Maimie, Miss St. Clair achieved better results. She was a gentle  girl, with an affectionate, yielding disposition, tending towards  indolence and self-indulgence. Her aunt's chief concern about her was  that she should be frocked and mannered as became her position. Her  education was committed to a very select young ladies' school, where  only the daughters of the first families ever entered. What or how they  were taught, her aunt never inquired. She felt quite sure that the lady  principal would resent, as indeed she ought, any such inquiry. Hence  Maimie came to have a smattering of the English poets, could talk in  conversation-book French, and could dash off most of the notes of a few  waltzes and marches from the best composers, her piece de resistance,  however, being \"La Priere d'une Vierge.\" She carried with her from  school a portfolio of crayons of apparently very ancient and very  battered castles; and water-colors of landscapes, where the water was  quite as solid as the land. True, she was quite unable to keep her own  small accounts, and when her father chanced to ask her one day to do for  him a simple addition, he was amazed to find that only after the third  attempt did she get it right; but, in the eyes of her aunt, these were  quite unimportant deficiencies, and for young ladies she was not sure  but that the keeping of accounts and the adding of figures were almost  vulgar accomplishments. Her father thought otherwise, but he was a busy  "]]]
