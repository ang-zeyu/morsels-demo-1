We organised a number of  outdoor meetings, and of course prepared to attend Mr. Asquith's  meeting. In conversation with the president of the local Women's Liberal  Association, I mentioned the fact that we expected to be put out, and  she indignantly declared that such a thing could not happen in  Northampton, where the women had done so much for the Liberal party. I  told her that I hoped she would be at the meeting.    I had not intended to go myself, my plans being to hold a meeting of my  own outside the door. But our members, before Mr. Asquith began to  speak, attempted to question him, and were thrown out with violence. So  then, turning my meeting over to them, I slipped quietly into the hall  and sat down in the front row of a division set apart for wives and  women friends of the Liberal leaders. I sat there in silence, hearing  men interrupt the speaker and get answers to their questions. At the  close of the speech I stood up and, addressing the chairman, said: \"I  should like to ask Mr. Asquith a question about education.\" The chairman  turned inquiringly to Mr. Asquith, who frowningly shook his head. But  without waiting for the chairman to say a word, I continued: \"Mr.  Asquith has said that the parents of children have a right to be  consulted in the matter of their children's education, especially upon  such questions as the kind of religious instruction they should receive.  Women are parents. Does not Mr. Asquith think that women should have the  right to control their children's education, as men do, through the  vote?\" At this point the stewards seized me by the arms and shoulders  and rushed me, or rather dragged me, for I soon lost my footing, to the  door and threw me out of the building.    The effect on the president of the Northampton Women's Liberal  Association was most salutary. She resigned her office and became a  member of the W. S. P. U. Perhaps her action was influenced further by  the press reports of the incident. Mr. Asquith was reported as saying,  after my ejection, that it was difficult to enter into the minds of  people who thought they could serve a cause which professed to appeal to  the reason of the electors of the country by disturbing public meetings.  Apparently he could enter into the minds of the men who disturbed public  meetings.    To our custom of public heckling of the responsible members of the  hostile Government we added the practice of sending deputations to them  for the purpose of presenting orderly arguments in favour of our cause.  After Mr. Asquith had shown himself so uninformed as to the objects of  the suffragists, we decided to ask him to receive a deputation from the  W. S. P. U. To our polite letter Mr. Asquith returned a cold refusal to  be interviewed on any subject not connected with his particular office.  Whereupon we wrote again, reminding Mr. Asquith that as a member of the  Government he was concerned with all questions likely to be dealt with  by Parliament. We said that we urgently desired to put our question  before him, and that we would send a deputation to his house hoping that  he would feel it his duty to receive us.    Our first deputation was told that Mr. Asquith was not at home. He had,  in fact, escaped from the house through the back door, and had sped away  in a fast motor-car. Two days later we sent a larger deputation, of  about thirty women, to his house in Cavendish Square. To be accurate,  the deputation got as near the house as the entrance to Cavendish  Square; there the women met a strong force of police, who told them that  they would not be permitted to go farther.    Many of the women were carrying little \"Votes for Women\" banners, and  these the police tore from them, in some cases with blows and insults.  Seeing this, the leader of the deputation cried out: \"We will go  forward. You have no right to strike women like that.\" The reply, from a  policeman near her, was a blow in the face. She screamed with pain and  indignation, whereupon the man grasped her by the throat and choked her  against the park railings until she was blue in the face. The young  woman struggled and fought back, and for this she was arrested on a  charge of assaulting the police. Three other women were arrested, one  because, in spite of the police, she succeeded in ringing Mr. Asquith's  door-bell and another because she protested against the laughter of  some ladies who watched the affair from a drawing-room window. She was a  poor working-woman, and it seemed to her a terrible thing that rich and  protected women should ridicule a cause that to her was so profoundly  serious. The fourth woman was taken in charge, because after she had  been pushed off the pavement, she dared to step back. Charged with  disorderly conduct, these women were sentenced to six weeks in the  Second Division. They were given the option of a fine, it is true, but  the payment of a fine would have been an acknowledgment of guilt, which  made such a course impossible. The leader of the deputation was given a  two months' sentence, with the option of a fine of ten pounds. She, too,  refused to pay, and was sent to prison; but some unknown friend paid the  fine secretly, and she was released before the expiration of her  sentence.    About the time these things were happening in London, similar violence  was offered our women in Manchester, where John Burns, Lloyd-George, and  Winston Churchill, all three Cabinet Ministers, were addressing a great  Liberal demonstration. The women were there, as usual, to ask government  support for our measure. There, too, they were thrown out of the  meeting, and three of them were sent to prison.    There are people in England, plenty of them, who will tell you that the  Suffragettes were sent to prison for destroying property. The fact is  that hundreds of women were arrested for exactly such offences as I have  described before it ever occurred to any of us to destroy property. We  were determined, at the beginning of our movement, that we would make  ourselves heard, that we would force the Government to take up our  question and answer it by action in Parliament. Perhaps you will see  some parallel to our case in the stand taken in Massachusetts by the  early Abolitionists, Wendell Phillips and William Lloyd Garrison. They,  too, had to fight bitterly, to face insult and arrest, because they  insisted on being heard. And they were heard; and so, in time, were we.    I think we began to be noticed in earnest after our first success in  opposing a Liberal candidate. This was in a by-election held at  Cockermouth in August, 1906. I shall have to explain that a by-election  is a local election to fill a vacancy in Parliament caused by a death or  a resignation. The verdict of a by-election is considered as either an  indorsement or a censure of the manner in which the Government have  fulfilled their pre-election pledges. So we went to Cockermouth and told  the voters how the Liberal party had fulfilled its pledges of democracy  and lived up to its avowed belief in the rights of all the people. We  told them of the arrests in London and Manchester, of the shameful  treatment of women in Liberal meetings, and we asked them to censure the  Government who had answered so brutally our demand for a vote. We told  them that the only rebuke that the politicians would notice was a lost  seat in Parliament, and that on that ground we asked them to defeat the  Liberal candidate.    How we were ridiculed! With what scorn the newspapers declared that  \"those wild women\" could never turn a single vote. Yet when the  election was over it was found that the Liberal candidate had lost the  seat, which, at the general election a little more than a year before,  had been won by a majority of 655. This time the Unionist candidate was  returned by a majority of 609. Tremendously elated, we hurried our  forces off to another by-election.    Now the ridicule was turned to stormy abuse. Mind you, the Liberal  Government still refused to notice the women's question; they declared  through the Liberal press that the defeat at Cockermouth was  insignificant, and that anyhow it wasn't caused by the Suffragettes; yet  the Liberal leaders were furiously angry with the W. S. P. U. Many of  our members had been Liberals, and it was considered by the men that  these women were little better than traitors. They were very foolish and  ill-advised, into the bargain, the Liberals said, because the vote, if  won at all, must be gained from the Liberal party; and how did the women  suppose the Liberal party would ever give the vote to open and avowed  enemies? This sage argument was used also by the women Liberals and the  constitutional suffragists. They advised us that the proper way was to  work for the party. We retorted that we had done that unsuccessfully for  too many years already, and persisted with the opposite method of  persuasion.    Throughout the summer and autumn we devoted ourselves to the by-election  work, sometimes actually defeating the Liberal candidate, sometimes  reducing the Liberal majority, and always raising a tremendous sensation  and gaining hundreds of new members to the Union. In almost every  neighbourhood we visited we left the nucleus of a local union, so that  before the year was out we had branches all over England and many in  Scotland and Wales. I especially remember a by-election in Wales at  which Mr. Samuel Evans, who had accepted an officership under the Crown,  had to stand for re-election. Unfortunately no candidate had been  brought out against him. So there was nothing for my companions and me  to do but make his campaign as lively as possible. Mr.--now Sir  Samuel--Evans was the man who had incensed women by talking out a  suffrage resolution introduced into the House by Keir Hardie. So we went  to two"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34901"],[0,"On Liberty (#12)"],[1,"into the  mental position of those who think differently from them, and considered  what such persons may have to say; and consequently they do not, in any  proper sense of the word, know the doctrine which they themselves  profess. They do not know those parts of it which explain and justify  the remainder; the considerations which show that a fact which seemingly  conflicts with another is reconcilable with it, or that, of two  apparently strong reasons, one and not the other ought to be preferred.  All that part of the truth which turns the scale, and decides the  judgment of a completely informed mind, they are strangers to; nor is it  ever really known, but to those who have attended equally and  impartially to both sides, and endeavoured to see the reasons of both in  the strongest light. So essential is this discipline to a real  understanding of moral and human subjects, that if opponents of all  important truths do not exist, it is indispensable to imagine them, and  supply them with the strongest arguments which the most skilful devil's  advocate can conjure up.    To abate the force of these considerations, an enemy of free discussion  may be supposed to say, that there is no necessity for mankind in  general to know and understand all that can be said against or for their  opinions by philosophers and theologians. That it is not needful for  common men to be able to expose all the misstatements or fallacies of an  ingenious opponent. That it is enough if there is always somebody  capable of answering them, so that nothing likely to mislead  uninstructed persons remains unrefuted. That simple minds, having been  taught the obvious grounds of the truths inculcated on them, may trust  to authority for the rest, and being aware that they have neither  knowledge nor talent to resolve every difficulty which can be raised,  may repose in the assurance that all those which have been raised have  been or can be answered, by those who are specially trained to the task.    Conceding to this view of the subject the utmost that can be claimed for  it by those most easily satisfied with the amount of understanding of  truth which ought to accompany the belief of it; even so, the argument  for free discussion is no way weakened. For even this doctrine  acknowledges that mankind ought to have a rational assurance that all  objections have been satisfactorily answered; and how are they to be  answered if that which requires to be answered is not spoken? or how can  the answer be known to be satisfactory, if the objectors have no  opportunity of showing that it is unsatisfactory? If not the public, at  least the philosophers and theologians who are to resolve the  difficulties, must make themselves familiar with those difficulties in  their most puzzling form; and this cannot be accomplished unless they  are freely stated, and placed in the most advantageous light which they  admit of. The Catholic Church has its own way of dealing with this  embarrassing problem. It makes a broad separation between those who can  be permitted to receive its doctrines on conviction, and those who must  accept them on trust. Neither, indeed, are allowed any choice as to what  they will accept; but the clergy, such at least as can be fully confided  in, may admissibly and meritoriously make themselves acquainted with the  arguments of opponents, in order to answer them, and may, therefore,  read heretical books; the laity, not unless by special permission, hard  to be obtained. This discipline recognises a knowledge of the enemy's  case as beneficial to the teachers, but finds means, consistent with  this, of denying it to the rest of the world: thus giving to the _elite_  more mental culture, though not more mental freedom, than it allows to  the mass. By this device it succeeds in obtaining the kind of mental  superiority which its purposes require; for though culture without  freedom never made a large and liberal mind, it can make a clever _nisi  prius_ advocate of a cause. But in countries professing Protestantism,  this resource is denied; since Protestants hold, at least in theory,  that the responsibility for the choice of a religion must be borne by  each for himself, and cannot be thrown off upon teachers. Besides, in  the present state of the world, it is practically impossible that  writings which are read by the instructed can be kept from the  uninstructed. If the teachers of mankind are to be cognisant of all that  they ought to know, everything must be free to be written and published  without restraint.    If, however, the mischievous operation of the absence of free  discussion, when the received opinions are true, were confined to  leaving men ignorant of the grounds of those opinions, it might be  thought that this, if an intellectual, is no moral evil, and does not  affect the worth of the opinions, regarded in their influence on the  character. The fact, however, is, that not only the grounds of the  opinion are forgotten in the absence of discussion, but too often the  meaning of the opinion itself. The words which convey it, cease to  suggest ideas, or suggest only a small portion of those they were  originally employed to communicate. Instead of a vivid conception and a  living belief, there remain only a few phrases retained by rote; or, if  any part, the shell and husk only of the meaning is retained, the finer  essence being lost. The great chapter in human history which this fact  occupies and fills, cannot be too earnestly studied and meditated on.    It is illustrated in the experience of almost all ethical doctrines and  religious creeds. They are all full of meaning and vitality to those who  originate them, and to the direct disciples of the originators. Their  meaning continues to be felt in undiminished strength, and is perhaps  brought out into even fuller consciousness, so long as the struggle  lasts to give the doctrine or creed an ascendency over other creeds. At  last it either prevails, and becomes the general opinion, or its  progress stops; it keeps possession of the ground it has gained, but  ceases to spread further. When either of these results has become  apparent, controversy on the subject flags, and gradually dies away. The  doctrine has taken its place, if not as a received opinion, as one of  the admitted sects or divisions of opinion: those who hold it have  generally inherited, not adopted it; and conversion from one of these  doctrines to another, being now an exceptional fact, occupies little  place in the thoughts of their professors. Instead of being, as at  first, constantly on the alert either to defend themselves against the  world, or to bring the world over to them, they have subsided into  acquiescence, and neither listen, when they can help it, to arguments  against their creed, nor trouble dissentients (if there be such) with  arguments in its favour. From this time may usually be dated the decline  in the living power of the doctrine. We often hear the teachers of all  creeds lamenting the difficulty of keeping up in the minds of believers  a lively apprehension of the truth which they nominally recognise, so  that it may penetrate the feelings, and acquire a real mastery over the  conduct. No such difficulty is complained of while the creed is still  fighting for its existence: even the weaker combatants then know and  feel what they are fighting for, and the difference between it and other  doctrines; and in that period of every creed's existence, not a few  persons may be found, who have realised its fundamental principles in  all the forms of thought, have weighed and considered them in all their  important bearings, and have experienced the full effect on the  character, which belief in that creed ought to produce in a mind  thoroughly imbued with it. But when it has come to be a hereditary  creed, and to be received passively, not actively--when the mind is no  longer compelled, in the same degree as at first, to exercise its vital  powers on the questions which its belief presents to it, there is a  progressive tendency to forget all of the belief except the  formularies, or to give it a dull and torpid assent, as if accepting it  on trust dispensed with the necessity of realising it in consciousness,  or testing it by personal experience; until it almost ceases to connect  itself at all with the inner life of the human being. Then are seen the  cases, so frequent in this age of the world as almost to form the  majority, in which the creed remains as it were outside the mind,  encrusting and petrifying it against all other influences addressed to  the higher parts of our nature; manifesting its power by not suffering  any fresh and living conviction to get in, but itself doing nothing for  the mind or heart, except standing sentinel over them to keep them  vacant.    To what an extent doctrines intrinsically fitted to make the deepest  impression upon the mind may remain in it as dead beliefs, without being  ever realised in the imagination, the feelings, or the understanding, is  exemplified by the manner in which the majority of believers hold the  doctrines of Christianity. By Christianity I here mean what is accounted  such by all churches and sects--the maxims and precepts contained in the  New Testament. These are considered sacred, and accepted as laws, by all  professing Christians. Yet it is scarcely too much to say that not one  Christian in a thousand guides or tests his individual conduct by  reference to those laws. The standard to which he does refer it, is the  custom of his nation, his class, or his religious profession. He has  thus, on the one hand, a collection of ethical maxims, which he believes  to have been vouchsafed to him by infallible wisdom as rules for his  government; and on the other, a set of every-day judgments and  practices, which go a certain length with some of those maxims, not so  great a length with others, stand"]]]
