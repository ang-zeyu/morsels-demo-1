The work of Macaulay professes to be \"the  history of England from the accession of King James the Second down to  the time which is within the memory of men still living.\" \"Half a  Century of the British Empire,\" will chiefly deal with events and states  of society during a period in which many of our contemporaries have  lived and acted.           *       *       *       *       *    The correspondence of ROBERT SUTTON, Lord LEXINGTON, British Minister at  Vienna in 1694, has just been published by Murray in London, having  recently been discovered in the library of the Suttons, at Kilham. There  is not much absolute value in their contents, historically speaking; but  the letters supply several striking and some amusing illustrations of  characters already known in history, and are a contribution really  important to the history of manners and society at the seventeenth  century. The non-official letters are in this respect most curious and  entertaining.           *       *       *       *       *    Pensions of L100 a year each have been granted in England to Mrs.  Belzoni, the aged widow of the celebrated traveller; and to Mr. Poole,  the author of _Paul Pry_, and of many contributions to periodical  literature, who is a great sufferer from bodily infirmities.           *       *       *       *       *    CAPTAIN MEDWIN, whose book about Byron was once read by every body, and  who for some time resided in this country, turns up in Holland, after an  oblivion of several years.

His complaints to visitors  of the madhouse are commonly of the injustice done to him by the public  in not recognizing him, instead of Scott and Byron, as the author of  \"Marmion\" and \"Don Juan,\" and in refusing him the honor of having gained  the battle of Waterloo. Clare was the writer, though not generally known  as such, of the lines, \"Here we meet too soon to part\"--which, set to  one of Rossini's most beautiful airs, were some time exceedingly  popular.           *       *       *       *       *    A new volume of the writings of De Quincey has just been published by  Ticknor, Reed & Fields, of Boston.

Du Barry, U. S. N., has been  published in a large octavo of about five hundred pages, by Lippencott,  Grambo, & Co., of Philadelphia. We take the opportunity to give some  account of the author.    Guillaume Tell Poussin was born in the autumn of the year 1796 in the  department of the Seine and Oise, in France. His father was a painter of  some celebrity, who has left many fine works in the galleries of  Versailles and Rouen. Introduced, while a child, to the favor of  Napoleon, it was ordered by a special decree that, as a descendant of  the great Nicholas Poussin, whose works are among the chief glories of  French art, William Tell Poussin should be educated at the imperial  school of Rouen. There he spent seven years, and passed his examination  for admission to the Polytechnic school. He entered this national  academy of engineering, and in 1814, while yet a youth, distinguished  himself by his patriotic spirit, which prompted him to join his comrades  in the defence of the walls of Paris against an invading enemy. He was  wounded at the village of Aubervilliers, in an attack against the  combined force of British and Russian troops who occupied that position;  and after the surrender of Paris his feelings were so excited that he  could not bring himself to acts of submission to the Bourbon family, but  was arrested on account of his opinions, and released only on the  intervention of powerful friends. He soon embarked for America, and  arrived at New-York in November, 1815, having for recommendation his  ardent desire to be useful and a decided love of liberty. After a short  residence in New-York he proceeded to Philadelphia, where he expected to  meet with some encouragement in his profession as an engineer. Here he  became acquainted with Mr. Fairman, the engraver, and worked for him a  few months with advantage, boarding meanwhile at a French house, into  which the landlady received him in consideration of the devotion of his  leisure to the instruction of her children. The next spring he removed  to Washington, where he had heard that he could be profitably employed  in the rebuilding of the capitol, which the British army had destroyed  in the late war. He now worked as an architect for about a year, when,  several leading senators and representatives having become acquainted  with him, and, taking a particular interest in him for his earnest and  manly character and the remarkable abilities he had evinced as an  engineer, in the incidental opportunities presented by his employment as  an architect, they signed a petition to President Madison for his  admission to the corps of Topographical Engineers, which was then to be  organized, and he was at once transferred to the United States Army. A  short time after, General Bernard, whom Mr. Crawford, the American  Minister at Paris, had engaged to be the chief of the Topographical  Engineers, arrived in Washington, and assuming his office proceeded to  the necessary preparations for that survey of the physical resources of  our territory for national defence, and for tracing the lines required  to form a complete base of operations in time of war, on the assailable  portions of our frontier, for which the service had been instituted.  Before leaving France, General Bernard had received especial  recommendations from the friends of young Poussin to look after his  interests, and when they met, therefore, their acquaintance was made on  the most intimate and agreeable terms on both sides. Upon the  application of General Bernard to the Secretary of War, Poussin was  attached to his person as an aid-de-camp, and left Washington with him  for a military reconnaissance of the coast on the Gulf of Mexico, and of  the delta of the Mississippi. They spent a year and a half upon their  important duties, in New Orleans and its vicinity, regardless of the  dangers of that climate, and in 1817 returned to the seat of government  and submitted to the President a particular and elaborate memoir of  their operations. It was upon this first report, presented by the  Executive, on the Military Defences of the United States,--a report  drawn up in a very large degree by the hand of M. Poussin, and  illustrated throughout with his discovery and suggestion,--that  Congress, by an almost unanimous vote, authorized the erection of the  great line of our military defences, adopting the recommendations of the  commissioner without even the slightest alteration. The Board of  Military Engineers entered subsequently on the yearly execution of their  important "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24923"],[0,"The Variation of Animals and Plants Under Domestication, Vol. I. (#12)"],[1,"well illustrates the importance of separation. The  conditions of life in Paraguay appear not to be highly favourable to the  cat, for, though they have run half-wild, they do not become thoroughly  feral, like so many other European animals. In another part of South  America, according to Roulin,[94] the introduced cat has lost the habit of  uttering its hideous nocturnal howl. The Rev. W. D. Fox purchased a cat in  Portsmouth, which he was told came from the coast of Guinea; its skin was  black and wrinkled, fur bluish-grey and short, its ears rather bare, legs  long, and whole aspect peculiar. This \"negro\" cat was fertile with common  cats. On the opposite coast of Africa, at Mombas, Captain Owen, R.N.,[95]  states that all the cats are covered with short stiff hair instead of fur:  he gives a curious account of a cat from Algoa Bay, which had been kept for  some time on board and could be identified with certainty; this {47} animal  was left for only eight weeks at Mombas, but during that short period it  \"underwent a complete metamorphosis, having parted with its sandy-coloured  fur.\" A cat from the Cape of Good Hope has been described by Desmarest as  remarkable from a red stripe extending along the whole length of its back.  Throughout an immense area, namely, the Malayan archipelago, Siam, Pegu,  and Burmah, all the cats have truncated tails about half the proper  length,[96] often with a sort of knot at the end. In the Caroline  archipelago the cats have very long legs, and are of a reddish-yellow  colour.[97] In China a breed has drooping ears. At Tobolsk, according to  Gmelin, there is a red-coloured breed. In Asia, also, we find the  well-known Angora or Persian breed.    The domestic cat has run wild in several countries, and everywhere assumes,  as far as can be judged by the short recorded descriptions, a uniform  character. Near Maldonado, in La Plata, I shot one which seemed perfectly  wild; it was carefully examined by Mr. Waterhouse,[98] who found nothing  remarkable in it, excepting its great size. In New Zealand, according to  Dieffenbach, the feral cats assume a streaky grey colour like that of wild  cats; and this is the case with the half-wild cats of the Scotch Highlands.    We have seen that distant countries possess distinct domestic races of the  cat. The differences may be in part due to descent from several aboriginal  species, or at least to crosses with them. In some cases, as in Paraguay,  Mombas, and Antigua, the differences seem due to the direct action of  different conditions of life. In other cases some slight effect may  possibly be attributed to natural selection, as cats in many cases have  largely to support themselves and to escape diverse dangers. But man, owing  to the difficulty of pairing cats, has done nothing by methodical  selection; and probably very little by unintentional selection; though in  each litter he generally saves the prettiest, {48} and values most a good  breed of mouse or rat-catchers. Those cats which have a strong tendency to  prowl after game, generally get destroyed by traps. As cats are so much  petted, a breed bearing the same relation to other cats, that lapdogs bear  to larger dogs, would have been much valued; and if selection could have  been applied, we should certainly have had many breeds in each  long-civilized country, for there is plenty of variability to work upon.    We see in this country considerable diversity in size, some in the  proportions of the body, and extreme variability in colouring. I have only  lately attended to this subject, but have already heard of some singular  cases of variation; one of a cat born in the West Indies toothless, and  remaining so all its life. Mr. Tegetmeier has shown me the skull of a  female cat with its canines so much developed that they protruded uncovered  beyond the lips; the tooth with the fang being .95, and the part projecting  from the gum .6 of an inch in length. I have heard of a family of six-toed  cats. The tail varies greatly in length; I have seen a cat which always  carried its tail flat on its back when pleased. The ears vary in shape, and  certain strains, in England, inherit a pencil-like tuft of hairs, above a  quarter of an inch in length, on the tips of their ears; and this same  peculiarity, according to Mr. Blyth, characterises some cats in India. The  great variability in the length of the tail and the lynx-like tufts of  hairs on the ears are apparently analogous to differences in certain wild  species of the genus. A much more important difference, according to  Daubenton,[99] is that the intestines of domestic cats are wider, and a  third longer, than in wild cats of the same size; and this apparently has  been caused by their less strictly carnivorous diet.           *       *       *       *       *      {49}    CHAPTER II.

Remains of this animal in a  domesticated condition have been found in the Swiss lake-dwellings,  belonging to the latter part of the Stone period.[100] At the present time  the number of breeds is great, as may be seen by consulting any treatise on  the Horse.[101] Looking only to the native ponies of Great Britain, those  of the Shetland Isles, Wales, the New Forest, and Devonshire are  distinguishable; and so it is with each separate island in the great Malay  archipelago.[102] Some of the breeds present great differences in size,  shape of ears, length of mane, proportions of the body, form of the withers  and hind quarters, and especially in the head. Compare the race-horse,  dray-horse, and a Shetland pony in size, configuration, and disposition;  and see how much greater the difference is than between the six or seven  other living species of the genus Equus.    {50}    Of individual variations not known to characterise particular breeds, and  not great or injurious enough to be called monstrosities, I have not  collected many cases. Mr. G. Brown, of the Cirencester Agricultural  College, who has particularly attended to the dentition of our domestic  animals, writes to me that he has \"several times noticed eight permanent  incisors instead of six in the jaw.\" Male horses alone properly have  canines, but they are occasionally found in the mare, though of small  size.[103] The number of ribs is properly eighteen, but Youatt[104] asserts  that not unfrequently there are nineteen on each side, the additional one  being always the posterior rib. I have seen several notices of variations  in the bones of the leg; thus Mr. Price[105] speaks of an additional bone  in the hock, and of certain abnormal appearances between the tibia and  astragalus, as quite common in Irish horses, and not due to disease. Horses  have often been observed, according to M. Gaudry,[106] to possess a  trapezium and a rudiment of a fifth metacarpal bone, so that \"one sees  appearing by monstrosity, in the foot of the horse, structures which  normally exist in the foot of the Hipparion,\"--an allied and extinct  animal. In various countries horn-like projections have been observed on  the frontal bones of the horse: in one case described by Mr. Percival they  arose about two inches above the orbital processes, and were \"very like  those in a calf from five to six months old,\" being from half to  three-quarters of an inch in length.[107] Azara has described two cases in  South America in which the projections were between three and four inches  in length: other instances have occurred in Spain.    That there has been much inherited variation in the horse cannot be  doubted, when we reflect on the number of the breeds existing throughout  the world or even within the same country, and when we know that they have  largely increased in number {51} since the earliest known records.[108]  Even in so fleeting a character as colour, Hofacker[109] found that, out of  two hundred and sixteen cases in which horses of the same colour were  paired, only eleven pairs produced foals of a quite different colour. As  Professor Low[110] has remarked, the English race-horse offers the best  possible evidence of inheritance. The pedigree of a race-horse is of more  value in judging of its probable success than its appearance: \"King Herod\"  gained in prizes 201,505l. sterling, and begot 497 winners; \"Eclipse\" begot  334 winners.    Whether the whole amount of difference between the various breeds be due to  variation is doubtful. From the fertility of the most distinct breeds[111]  when crossed, naturalists have generally looked at all the breeds as having  descended from a single species. Few will agree with Colonel H. Smith, who  believes that they have descended from no less than five primitive and  differently coloured stocks.[112] But as several species and varieties of  the horse existed[113] during the later tertiary periods, and as Ruetimeyer  found differences in the size and form of the skull in the earliest known  domesticated horses,[114] we ought not to feel sure that all our breeds  have descended from a single species. As we see that the savages of North  and South America easily reclaim the feral horses, there is no  improbability in savages in various quarters of the world having  domesticated more than one native species or natural race. No aboriginal or  truly wild horse is positively known now to exist; for it is thought by  some authors that the wild horses of the East are"]]]
