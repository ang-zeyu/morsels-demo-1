Its history, (#12)"],[1,"it so chanced that they had  been drawn into a debate on the origin and nature of the virus of the  plague which carried off Jansenius. But let us confine ourselves to  serious facts and conclude--    1st. That we have no proof of any anatomical and physiological  difference in the humours or in the blood--that is to say, in the  organic, intimate, and biological elements of the individuals which  collectively constitute the bovine species.    2nd. That we have a right to believe, that all horned cattle are apt to  develop the typhic virus when they are placed within the conditions  required for that effect--that is to say, when they are exposed to the  special morbific causes which form its condition _sine qua non_, and  which are met with on the banks of those great rivers which water  Southern Russia and Hungary, in Africa, on the banks of the Nile, in  South America, on the margins of the lakes, and in what are called hot  climates, &c.      II.    But if the origin of the typhus cannot exclusively depend on the  peculiar organization of certain individuals of the bovine species, we  must inquire after and search for the real causes which produce it.    We have explained already, in the First Part, what alterations organic  matter undergoes in general, when accidental causes happen to modify its  organic elements; and we have pointed out the fact, that of all living  creatures herbivorous animals were those that offered the least vital  resistance to the causes of disease and destruction.    This unquestionable fact being taken for granted, let us now consider  under what conditions live the multitudinous herds of horned cattle  which in Russia and in South America are reared and supported solely for  the produce of their flesh, and sometimes, too, for that of their hides.    The great breeders and proprietors fix the number of their heads of  cattle according and in proportion to the quantity of the pastures, but  like other men, they mortgage the future for their benefit without  making due allowance for accidents or extreme changes of weather, as  when years of unusual drought succeed those of heavy rain; so that these  herds, by the single fact of these extreme fluctuations in the degrees  of temperature, are exposed to a multiplicity of causes productive of  disease. The same nature which generates life and health generates  disease and dissolution, and when the former are neglected the latter  will prevail.    In the prosperous and favoured countries of the temperate zone, such as  England and France, these extreme variations in the seasons, which are  always the cause of a deficiency or alteration in the production of  fodder, are equally the cause of the numerous epizootics which attack  all the herbivorous species, and particularly those to which oxen fall  victims, such as the tumourous typhus (_le typhus charbonneux_), the  so-called aphthous fever, the contagious peripneumonia (which is not  liable to return and is prevented by inoculation), parasitical cutaneous  disease.    But in less favoured countries, in those which are damp, argillaceous,  swampy, inundated by the overflows of their lakes and rivers, or by the  reflux of the sea, there is deposited a slimy or brackish water, which a  temporary torrid heat afterwards causes to ferment; and then a  superabundance of life, a teeming vegetation, springs up in all  directions. In the midst of this swarming vitality live and thrive an  infinity of worms, maggots, animalculae, insects, mollusca, fish,  reptiles, birds, &c.; and here, too, all these creatures die and decay,  when this slime, the prolific source of generations which we might look  upon as spontaneous, begins to dry up and disintegrate. Then from these  organic vegetable and animal matters, in a state of decomposition,  escape those deleterious gases, such as hydrogen, carbonic oxide,  nitrogen, carbonic acid, sulphuretted hydrogen, and even phosphoretted  hydrogen.    Often to all these causes of infection are added myriads of  grasshoppers, which cover the ground, where they die, aggravating the  mass of pestiferous vapour which fills the atmosphere. Finally, the  water which slakes the thirst of the herds of cattle is corrupted; the  plants on which they feed distil poisons; the air, the water, and the  plants, carry within them a principle of venom and death. After this,  how can we be surprised if this flood of putrid emanations is  transformed into a contagious typhic virus, whose subtle and  pestilential effluvia are conveyed by the ox to considerable distances?    In fine, let us recapitulate in our minds all the causes of destruction  to which these passive creatures are exposed, and we shall acknowledge  that there is no necessity to attribute to them a peculiar organization  in order to understand the development of the typhus, which, at a given  moment, cuts them all off; and that in the deltas of the different  countries, as well in Asia, Africa, and America, as in Europe, are to be  found those conditions of infectious disease which we have described. In  these causes, and only in these causes, or in those which resemble them,  will rational men seek for the principle of the contagious typhus in the  bovine race.    Moreover, who is there who does not understand that what is true with  regard to cholera is likewise applicable to this contagious typhus? The  cholera, for causes analogous to these, subject to the particular state  of the soil, is generated, not exclusively, it is true, but most  frequently, on the banks of the Ganges, in the same manner as the  contagious typhus is developed in certain countries where its natural  focus is found.    The race of animals which exists on this deadly and destructive soil is  an instrument of incubation for typhus, not in consequence of their  peculiar structure, but because the conditions under which they live  condemn them to this fate.      III.    Now the breeding of cattle, and the feeding and fattening of them for  the market, constitute a branch of industry--a great interest. They all  have to be removed, conveyed to various distances, and sold; so that  this traffic becomes a new cause to be added to all those which foster,  develop and propagate the distemper.    In prosperous times, when the seasons, conformably with our wishes, have  pursued a course which we call regular (for we are fain to believe that  the planets turn on their axes on our account), and when the cattle find  the ground covered with rich pastures, and limpid streams--conditions  which are eminently favourable in themselves, though in Hungary it is  necessary to add gum, salt, mineral water, and arsenic acid, before the  health of these animals is satisfactory,--then the cattle breeders make  their sordid calculations, and select the heads of cattle intended for  sale.    With animals, as with man, health is but relative, not absolute; the  healthiest in appearance often bearing within its frame the fatal  principle of no distant death. Fatness not being by any means a sure  sign of vital strength, many of these cumbersome beasts, though  seemingly in good and sound condition, contain in their systems, in  various stages of incubation, the tainted leaven of contagious  affections, such as peripneumonia, or even the typhus itself.    But, regardless of this liability, their sale and migration are resolved  upon at length. Hitherto these harmless creatures have lived in the most  perfect stillness and retirement. Their calm, monotonous life has been  as regular as the course of time; never by a single pulsation have their  hearts exceeded the wonted number per minute; they are all gifted with a  nervous sensibility of which the vulgar have no notion. Some favoured  few have felt the sympathy of friendship for the herdsman who tended  them, and for the companions with which they fed. They have been leaders  of their own herd, they have marched at their head; they have given the  signal when to seek shelter beneath the trees, or when to repair to the  brook. They have loved the fields amidst which they have grown and  thriven. Some of them, reared and fed beneath the domestic thatch, were  grateful for the care they had received; their master was endeared to  them, they would run to meet his coming, answer to their name, and lick  his hand with fondness.    And it is the course of this tranquil, this happy existence, that is  about to be broken abruptly. It is this creature, the pattern of  gentleness and goodness, that we are going to treat like a heap of  insensible and inert matter--which we are going to subject to  unutterable torture!    And now, indeed, these creatures are all at once handed over to the  savage guidance, to the thongs and cudgels, of a hind, whose cruelty  keeps pace with his stolid ignorance, and who abets his dogs to quicken  their course to the neighbouring market. From this moment, half-fed and  athirst, these poor animals are forced to make long journeys afoot; or  since the construction of railways, to be heaped together confusedly in  a locomotive pen. There, the shaking, the sudden starts, the friction of  five hundred wheels on the rails, the horrid snorting of the engines,  alarm and terrify them to such a degree as to turn the whole mass of  their blood.    In such a state of vital prostration or feverish excitement, entire  herds are carried to the public markets or to annual fairs with other  animals, and nearly all sent to the shambles. But some amongst them are  reserved for another fate. The females, for instance, are set apart to  serve as milch cows; and in this manner they carry with them into the  cowsheds, wherein they are received, the taint of those contagious  distempers, the germs of which lay concealed in their frames, or which  they have contracted from the companions of their journey.    Some of these heads of cattle, starting from the steppes of Russia, have  to travel five hundred miles in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36504"],[0,"Freshwater Sponges, Hydroids & Polyzoa (#12)"],[1,"they are enabled to  perform by the facts that they are provided with coverings not only very  hard but also fitted to resist the unfavourable agencies to which the  gemmules are likely to be exposed, and that they contain abundant  food-material of which use can be made as soon as favourable conditions  occur again.    Internally the gemmule consists of a mass of cells containing  food-material in what may be called a tabloid form, for it consists of  minutely granular plate-like bodies. These cells are enclosed in a  flask-like receptacle, the walls of which consist of two chitinous  layers, a delicate inner membrane and an outer one of considerable  stoutness. The mouth of the flask is closed by an extension of the inner  membrane, and in some species is surrounded by a tubular extension of  the external membrane known as the foraminal tubule. Externally the  gemmule is usually covered by what is called a \"pneumatic coat,\" also of  \"chitin\" (spongin), but usually of great relative thickness and  honeycombed by spaces which contain air, rendering the structure  buoyant. The pneumatic coat also contains the microscleres  characteristic of the species; it is often limited externally by a third  chitinous membrane, on which more gemmule-spicules sometimes lie  parallel to the surface.    The cells from which those of the gemmules are derived are akin in  origin to those that give rise to eggs and spermatozoa. Some zoologists  are therefore of the opinion that the development of the gemmule is an  instance of parthenogenesis--that is to say of an organism arising from  an egg that has not been fertilized. But some of the collar-cells,  although most of them originate from the external ciliated cells of the  larva, have a similar origin. The building-up of the gemmule affords an  excellent instance of the active co-operation that exists between the  cells of sponges, and of their mobility, for the food-material that has  to be stored up is brought by cells from all parts of the sponge, and  these cells retire after discharging their load into those of the young  gemmule.    The formation of the gemmule of _Ephydatia blembingia_, a Malayan  species not yet found in India, is described in detail by Dr. R. Evans  (Q. J. Microsc. Sci. London, xliv, p. 81, 1901).    Gemmules are produced by the freshwater sponges of Europe, N. America  and Japan at the approach of winter, but in the tropical parts of India  they are formed more frequently at the approach of the hot weather (p.  4). After they are fully formed the sponge that has produced them dies,  and as a rule disintegrates more or less completely. In some species,  however, the greater part of the skeleton remains intact, if it is not  disturbed, and retains some of the gemmules in its meshwork, where they  finally germinate. Other gemmules are set free. Some of them float on  the surface of the water; others sink to the bottom. In any case all of  them undergo a period of quiescence before germinating. It has been  found that they can be kept dry for two years without dying.    The function of the special spicules with which the gemmules of the  Spongillidae are provided appears to be not only to protect them but more  especially to weight them to the extent suitable to the habits of each  species. Species that inhabit running water, for example, in some cases  have heavier gemmule-spicules than those that live in stagnant water,  and their gemmules are the less easily carried away by the currents of  the river. The gemmules of sponges growing in lakes are sometimes  deficient in spicules. This is the case as regards the form of  _Spongilla lacustris_ found in Lake Baa, Isle of Mull, as regards _S.  helvetica_ from the Lake of Geneva, _S. moorei_ from Lake Tanganyika,  and _S. coggini_ from Tali-Fu in Yunnan; also as regards the species of  _Spongilla_ and _Ephydatia_ found in Lake Baikal, many of the sponges of  which are said never to produce gemmules.    Except in the genus _Corvospongilla_ and the subgenus _Stratospongilla_,  in both of which the air-spaces of the gemmules are usually no more than  cavities between different chitinous membranes, the pneumatic coat is  either \"granular\" or \"cellular.\" Neither of these terms, however, must  be understood in a physiological sense, for what appear to be granules  in a granular coat are actually minute bubbles of air contained in  little cavities in a foam-like mass of chitin (or rather spongin), while  the cells in a cellular one are only larger and more regular air-spaces  with thin polygonal walls and flat horizontal partitions. The walls of  these spaces are said in some cases to contain a considerable amount of  silica.    The gemmules with their various coverings are usually spherical in  shape, but in some species they are oval or depressed in outline. They  lie as a rule free in the substance of the sponge, but in some species  adhere at its base to the object to which it is attached. In some  species they are joined together in groups, but in most they are quite  free one from another.    Reproductive buds[O] are produced, so far as is known, by very few  Spongillidae, although they are common enough in some other groups of  sponges. In the only freshwater species in which they have been found to  form a habitual means of reproduction, namely in _Spongilla  proliferens_, they have much the appearance of abortive branches, and it  is possible that they have been overlooked for this reason in other  species, for they were noticed by Laurent in _Spongilla lacustris_ as  long ago as 1840 (CR. Se. Acad. Sci. Paris, xi, p. 478). The buds  noticed by Laurent, however, were only produced by very young sponges,  and were of a different nature from those of _S. proliferens_, perhaps  representing a form of fission rather than true budding (see 'Voyage de  la Bonite: Zoophytologie,' Spongiaires, pl. i (Paris, 1844)).         [Footnote O: Proliferation whereby more than one osculum is       produced is really a form of budding, but in most sponges       this has become no longer a mode of reproduction but the       normal method by which size is increased, and must therefore       be considered merely as a vegetative process.]    In _Spongilla proliferens_, a common Indian species, the buds arise as  thickenings of the strands of cells accompanying the radiating  spicule-fibres of the skeleton, which project outwards from the surface  of the sponge. The thickenings originate beneath the surface and  contain, at the earliest stage at which I have as yet examined them, all  the elements of the adult organism (_i. e._ flesh-spicules, ciliated  chambers, efferent and afferent canals, parenchyma-cells of various  sorts) except skeleton fibres, gemmules, and a dermal membrane. A  section at this period closely resembles one of an adult sponge, except  that the structure is more compact, the parenchyma being relatively  bulky and the canals of small diameter.    Laurent observed reproduction by splitting in young individuals of  _Spongilla_, but I have not been able to obtain evidence myself that  this method of reproduction occurs normally in Indian species. In  injured specimens of _Spongilla carteri_, however, I have observed a  phenomenon that seems to be rather an abnormal form of budding, little  rounded masses of cells making their way to the ends of the radiating  skeleton fibres and becoming transformed into young sponges, which break  loose and so start an independent existence. Possibly the buds observed  by Laurent in _S. lacustris_ were of a similar nature.      DEVELOPMENT.      (a) _From the Egg._    After fertilization, the egg, lying in its cavity in the sponge,  undergoes a complete segmentation; that is to say, becomes divided into  a number of cells without any residuum remaining. The segmentation,  however, is not equal, for it results in the formation of cells of two  distinct types, one larger and less numerous than the other. As the  process continues a pear-shaped body is produced, solid at the broader  end, which consists of the larger cells, but hollow at the other.  Further changes result in the whole of the external surface becoming  ciliated or covered with fine protoplasmic lashes, each of which arises  from a single small cell; considerable differentiation now takes place  among the cells, and spicules begin to appear. At this stage or earlier  (for there seem to be differences in different species and individuals  as to the stage at which the young sponge escapes) the larva makes its  way out of the parent sponge. After a brief period of free life, in  which it swims rapidly through the water by means of its cilia, it fixes  itself by the broad end to some solid object (from which it can never  move again) and undergoes a final metamorphosis. During this process the  ciliated cells of the external layer make their way, either by a  folding-in of the whole layer or in groups of cells, into the interior,  there change into collar-cells and arrange themselves in special  cavities--the ciliated chambers of the adult. Finally an osculum, pores,  &c., are formed, and the sponge is complete.    This, of course, is the merest outline of what occurs; other changes  that take place during the metamorphosis are of great theoretical  interest, but cannot be discussed here. The student may refer to Dr. R.  Evans's account of the larval development of _Spongilla lacustris_ in  the Q. J. Microsc. Sci. London, xlii, p. 363 (1899).    (b) _From the Gemmule._    The period for which the gemmule lies dormant probably depends to some  extent upon environment and to some extent on the species to which it  belongs. Carter found that if he cleaned gemmules with a handkerchief  and placed them in water exposed to sunlight, they germinated in a few  days; but in Calcutta gemmules of _Spongilla alba_ var. _bengalensis_  treated in this way and placed in my aquarium at the beginning of the  hot weather, did"]]]
