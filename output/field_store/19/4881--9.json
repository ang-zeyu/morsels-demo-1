A blow from the horn of another animal  may penetrate the abdomen. Exposure and protrusion of some of the abdominal  organs may also be occasioned by the incautious use of caustics in the  treatment of umbilical or ventral hernia. The parts which generally escape  through an abdominal wound are the small intestine and floating colon.    _Symptoms._--When the abdominal wound is small, the bowel exposed presents  the appearance of a small round tumor, but in a few moments a loop of  intestine may emerge from the opening. The animal then shows symptoms of  severe pain by pawing with his feet, which has the effect of accelerating  the passage of new loops of intestine through the wound, so that the mass  which they form may even touch the ground. The pain becomes so great that  the ox now not only paws but lies down and rolls, thus tearing and crushing  his bowels. In such cases it is best to slaughter the animal at once; but  in the case of a valuable animal in which tearing and crushing of the  bowels has not taken place the bowels should be washed with freshly boiled  water reduced to the temperature of the body and returned and the wounds in  the muscle and skin brought together in a manner somewhat similar to that  described in speaking of ventral hernia.      DISEASES OF THE LIVER AND SPLEEN.    JAUNDICE (THE YELLOWS, OR CONGESTION OF THE LIVER).    When jaundice exists, there is a yellow appearance of the white of the eyes  and of the mucous membrane of the mouth. A similar aspect of the skin may  also be observed in animals which are either partly or altogether covered  with white hair. Jaundice is then merely a symptom of disease and ought to  direct attention to ascertaining, if possible, the cause or causes which  have given rise to it. A swollen condition of the mucous membrane of that  part of the bowel called the duodenum may produce jaundice, as that  mechanically closes the orifice of the biliary duct. In constipation there  is an inactive or torpid condition of the bowel, and the bile which passes  into the intestine may be absorbed and cause the yellow staining of  jaundice. Jaundice is one of the symptoms of Texas fever. It may also arise  from the presence of parasites or gallstones in the ducts, forming a  mechanical obstruction to the onward flow of bile. The conditions under  which jaundice most commonly calls for treatment are when cattle have been  highly fed and kept in a state of inactivity. At such time there is an  excess of nutritive elements carried into the blood, which is associated  with increased fullness of the portal vein and hepatic artery. When  continued high feeding has produced this congested state of the liver, the  functions of that organ become disordered, so that a considerable portion  of the bile, instead of being excreted and passing into the intestine, is  absorbed by the hepatic veins.    The structure of the liver is shown in Plate IV.    _Symptoms._--This disease, although rare, occurs most frequently among  stall-fed cattle. Pressure along the margin of the short ribs on the right  side produces pain; the appetite is poor and the animal shows hardly any  inclination to drink; the mucous membranes of the eye and mouth are yellow,  the urine has a yellow or brown appearance, the animal lies down much and  moves with reluctance, moans occasionally, and has a tottering gait. The  ears and horns are alternately hot and cold; in cows the secretion of milk  is much diminished, and that which is secreted has a bitter taste;  sometimes the animal has a dry, painful cough and presents a dull,  stupefied appearance.    _Treatment._--In such cases it is advisable to produce a free action of the  bowels, so as to remove the usually congested condition of the portal vein  and liver. For this purpose the administration of the following dose is  recommended: Sulphate of soda, 16 ounces; molasses, 1 pint; warm water, 1  quart. The sulphate of soda is dissolved by stirring it up in tepid water.  Following this the animal should have a heaping tablespoonful of artificial  Carlsbad salt in the feed three times daily. This treatment may be assisted  by giving occasional injections of warm water and soap. The diet should be  laxative and moderate in quantity and may consist of coarse bran mash,  pulped roots, grass in the season, and hay in moderate quantity.      HEPATITIS (INFLAMMATION OF THE LIVER).    Hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver and usually occurs as a  complication of some infectious disease. It may also occur as a  complication of gastrointestinal catarrh or in hot weather from overheating  or damaged (putrid or fermented) feeds.    _Symptoms._--The symptoms are sometimes obscure and their real significance  is frequently overlooked. The most prominent symptoms are yellowness of the  white of the eye and of the membrane lining the mouth; the appetite is  poor, the body presents an emaciated appearance, the feces are light  colored, while the urine is likely to be unusually dark; there is thirst,  and pain is caused by pressing over the liver. The gait is weak and the  animal lies down more than usual, and while doing so frequently rests its  head on the side of its chest.    _Treatment._--Give a purge of Glauber's salt and after it has operated give  artificial Carlsbad salts in each feed, as advised under \"Jaundice.\" Give  green feed and plenty of water. Oil of turpentine should be rubbed in well  once a day over the region of the liver. The skin on which it should be  applied extends from the false ribs on the right side to 6 inches in front  of the last one, and from the backbone to 12 inches on the right side of  it.      FLUKE DISEASE.    [See chapter on \"The animal parasites of cattle,\" p. 502.]      SPLENITIS (INFLAMMATION OF THE SPLEEN).    This disease occurs almost solely as a result of the existence of some  infectious disease, and the symptoms caused by it merge with the symptoms  of the accompanying causative disease. The spleen is seriously involved and  becomes enlarged and soft in Texas fever, anthrax, and blood poisoning.      DISEASES OF THE PERITONEUM.    PERITONITIS.    Peritonitis consists of an inflammation of the peritoneum, which is the  thin, delicate membrane that lines the abdomen and covers the abdominal  organs.    _Causes._--Wounds are the usual cause in cattle. The wound may be of the  abdominal wall or of the intestines, stomach, or uterus; or inflammation  may extend from one of the organs of the abdominal cavity to the  peritoneum; so this disease may complicate enteritis or inflamed womb. A  sharp metal body may perforate the second stomach and allow the gastric  contents to escape, irritating the peritoneum. This disease may follow  castration or operation for hernia.    _Symptoms._--A continuous or occasional shivering; the animal lies down,  but appears uneasy; it frequently turns its head toward its belly and lows  plaintively; pressure on the flanks produces pain; has no appetite; muzzle  is dry and no rumination; while standing, its legs are placed well under  its body; pulse small and hard. The evacuations from the bowels are dry and  hard. If this disease is complicated by the presence of inflammation of the  bowels, the pain is more severe and the animal is more restless. The skin  is cold and dry in the early stage of this disease, but in a more advanced  stage this condition may be succeeded by heat of the skin and quick  breathing. The fits of trembling, uneasiness, small and hard pulse, and  tension of the left flank are symptoms the presence of which would enable  one to reach the conclusion that peritonitis exists.    _Post-mortem appearance._--The membrane lining the abdomen and covering the  surface of the bowels is reddened to a greater or less extent, and there is  usually considerable serous, or watery, fluid collected in the abdomen.    _Treatment._--When we have to do with the form of peritonitis resulting  from an injury, as when the horn of another animal has been thrust through  the abdominal walls, this lesion must be treated in accordance with  directions before given, but the general treatment must be similar to that  which follows. Peritonitis resulting from castration or from parturient  fever must also be treated in connection with the special conditions which  give rise to it, as the general treatment of this disease must be modified  to some extent by the exciting cause.    The aim must be to discover and remove the cause. The cause must be treated  according to its nature. Harms strongly recommends borax in the treatment  of peritonitis. He gives 6 ounces in the first 24 hours, divided into three  doses, and afterwards he gives 6 drams three times daily. Opium in doses of  2 to 3 drams may be given. To bring on evacuations of the bowels it is  better to give rectal injections than to administer purges. The strength  may be sustained by coffee or camphor.    The body should be warmly clothed, and it is advisable, when practicable,  to have a blanket which has been wrung out of hot water placed over the  abdomen, then covered by several dry blankets, which are maintained in  position by straps or ropes passing round the body. The wet blanket must be  changed as it cools--the object of treatment being to warm the surface of  the body and to determine as much blood to the skin as possible. The diet  should consist of laxative food and drinks, such as linseed tea. If  peritonitis assumes chronic form the diet should be nutritious, such as  selected clover hay, linseed cake, grass, etc., and iodid of potassium  should be given"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3032"],[0,"The Fathers of the Constitution: A Chronicle of the Establishment of the Union (#12)"],[1,", and for the fourteen  months ending January 1, 1786, the income was at the rate of less  than $375,000 a year, which was not enough, as a committee of Congress  reported, \"for the bare maintenance of the Federal Government on the  most economical establishment and in time of profound peace.\" In fact,  the income was not sufficient even to meet the interest on the foreign  debt.    In the absence of other means of obtaining funds Congress had resorted  early to the unfortunate expedient of issuing paper money based solely  on the good faith of the States to redeem it. This fiat money held its  value for some little time; then it began to shrink and, once started  on the downward path, its fall was rapid. Congress tried to meet the  emergency by issuing paper in increasing quantities until the inevitable  happened: the paper money ceased to have any value and practically  disappeared from circulation. Jefferson said that by the end of 1781  one thousand dollars of Continental scrip was worth about one dollar in  specie.    The States had already issued paper money of their own, and their  experience ought to have taught them a lesson, but with the coming of  hard times after the war, they once more proposed by issuing paper to  relieve the \"scarcity of money\" which was commonly supposed to be one  of the principal evils of the day. In 1785 and 1786 paper money parties  appeared in almost all the States. In some of these the conservative  element was strong enough to prevent action, but in others the movement  had to run its fatal course. The futility of what they were doing should  have been revealed to all concerned by proposals seriously made that the  paper money which was issued should depreciate at a regular rate each  year until it should finally disappear.    The experience of Rhode Island is not to be regarded as typical of  what was happening throughout the country but is, indeed, rather to be  considered as exceptional. Yet it attracted widespread attention and  revealed to anxious observers the dangers to which the country was  subject if the existing condition of affairs were allowed to continue.  The machinery of the State Government was captured by the paper-money  party in the spring election of 1786. The results were disappointing to  the adherents of the paper-money cause, for when the money was issued  depreciation began at once, and those who tried to pay their bills  discovered that a heavy discount was demanded. In response to indignant  demands the legislature of Rhode Island passed an act to force the  acceptance of paper money under penalty and thereupon tradesmen refused  to make any sales at all some closed their shops, and others tried to  carry on business by exchange of wares. The farmers then retaliated by  refusing to sell their produce to the shopkeepers, and general confusion  and acute distress followed. It was mainly a quarrel between the farmers  and the merchants, but it easily grew into a division between town and  country, and there followed a whole series of town meetings and county  conventions. The old line of cleavage was fairly well represented by the  excommunication of a member of St. John's Episcopal Church of Providence  for tendering bank notes, and the expulsion of a member of the Society  of the Cincinnati for a similar cause.    The contest culminated in the case of Trevett vs. Weeden, 1786, which is  memorable in the judicial annals of the United States. The legislature,  not being satisfied with ordinary methods of enforcement, had provided  for the summary trial of offenders without a jury before a court whose  judges were removable by the Assembly and were therefore supposedly  subservient to its wishes. In the case in question the Superior Court  boldly declared the enforcing act to be unconstitutional, and for their  contumacious behavior the judges were summoned before the legislature.  They escaped punishment, but only one of them was reelected to office.    Meanwhile disorders of a more serious sort, which startled the whole  country, occurred in Massachusetts. It is doubtful if a satisfactory  explanation ever will be found, at least one which will be universally  accepted, as to the causes and origin of Shays' Rebellion in 1786. Some  historians maintain that the uprising resulted primarily from a scarcity  of money, from a shortage in the circulating medium; that, while the  eastern counties were keeping up their foreign trade sufficiently at  least to bring in enough metallic currency to relieve the stringency and  could also use various forms of credit, the western counties had no  such remedy. Others are inclined to think that the difficulties of the  farmers in western Massachusetts were caused largely by the return to  normal conditions after the extraordinarily good times between 1776 and  1780, and that it was the discomfort attending the process that drove  them to revolt. Another explanation reminds one of present-day charges  against undue influence of high financial circles, when it is  insinuated and even directly charged that the rebellion was fostered  by conservative interests who were trying to create a public opinion in  favor of a more strongly organized government.    Whatever other causes there may have been, the immediate source of  trouble was the enforced payment of indebtedness, which to a large  extent had been allowed to remain in abeyance during the war. This  postponement of settlement had not been merely for humanitarian reasons;  it would have been the height of folly to collect when the currency was  greatly depreciated. But conditions were supposed to have been restored  to normal with the cessation of hostilities, and creditors were  generally inclined to demand payment. These demands, coinciding with  the heavy taxes, drove the people of western Massachusetts into revolt.  Feeling ran high against lawyers who prosecuted suits for creditors, and  this antagonism was easily transferred to the courts in which the suits  were brought. The rebellion in Massachusetts accordingly took the form  of a demonstration against the courts. A paper was carried from town  to town in the County of Worcester, in which the signers promised to  do their utmost \"to prevent the sitting of the Inferior Court of Common  Pleas for the county, or of any other court that should attempt to take  property by distress.\"    The Massachusetts Legislature adjourned in July, 1786, without remedying  the trouble and also without authorizing an issue of paper money which  the hardpressed debtors were demanding. In the months following mobs  prevented the courts from sitting in various towns. A special session of  the legislature was then called by the Governor but, when that special  session had adjourned on the 18th of November, it might just as well  have never met. It had attempted to remedy various grievances and had  made concessions to the malcontents, but it had also passed measures to  strengthen the hands of the Governor. This only seemed to inflame the  rioters, and the disorders increased. After the lower courts a move  was made against the State Supreme Court, and plans were laid for a  concerted movement against the cities in the eastern part of the State.  Civil war seemed imminent. The insurgents were led by Daniel Shays, an  officer in the army of the Revolution, and the party of law and order  was represented by Governor James Bowdoin, who raised some four thousand  troops and placed them under the command of General Benjamin Lincoln.    The time of year was unfortunate for the insurgents, especially as  December was unusually cold and there was a heavy snowfall. Shays could  not provide stores and equipment and was unable to maintain discipline.  A threatened attack on Cambridge came to naught for, when preparations  were made to protect the city, the rebels began a disorderly retreat,  and in the intense cold and deep snow they suffered severely, and many  died from exposure. The center of interest then shifted to Springfield,  where the insurgents were attempting to seize the United States arsenal.  The local militia had already repelled the first attacks, and  the appearance of General Lincoln with his troops completed the  demoralization of Shays' army. The insurgents retreated, but Lincoln  pursued relentlessly and broke them up into small bands, which then  wandered about the country preying upon the unfortunate inhabitants.  When spring came, most of them had been subdued or had taken refuge in  the neighboring States.    Shays' Rebellion was fairly easily suppressed, even though it required  the shedding of some blood. But it was the possibility of further  outbreaks that destroyed men's peace of mind. There were similar  disturbances in other States; and there the Massachusetts insurgents  found sympathy, support, and finally a refuge. When the worst was over,  and Governor Bowdoin applied to the neighboring States for help in  capturing the last of the refugees, Rhode Island and Vermont failed to  respond to the extent that might have been expected of them. The danger,  therefore, of the insurrection spreading was a cause of deep concern.  This feeling was increased by the impotence of Congress. The Government  had sufficient excuse for intervention after the attack upon the  national arsenal in Springfield. Congress, indeed, began to raise  troops but did not dare to admit its purpose and offered as a pretext  an expedition against the Northwestern Indians. The rebellion was over  before any assistance could be given. The inefficiency of Congress and  its lack of influence were evident. Like the disorders in Rhode Island,  Shays' Rebellion in Massachusetts helped to bring about a reaction and  strengthened the conservative movement for reform.    These untoward happenings, however, were only symptoms: the causes  of the trouble lay far deeper. This fact was recognized even in Rhode  Island, for at least one of the"]]]
