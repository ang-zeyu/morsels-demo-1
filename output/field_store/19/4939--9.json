And  when bred in confinement, a number will often spin in company in a  corner of their cage. I have thus obtained a cluster of thirty-seven  pupae, all hanging by the 'tails' to the same mass of silk, which was so  small that they formed quite a compact mass of beings with their tails  close together.    [Illustration: FIG. 28.--THE COCOON OF THE EMPEROR MOTH.]    [Illustration: FIG. 29.--THE COCOON OF THE SIX-SPOTTED BURNET  (_Filipendulae_).]    We have seen that the Large White Butterfly makes itself secure by a  silk band round its middle, while the 'Tortoiseshell' is fixed only by  its tail. But the extra provision for the safety of the former is not so  necessary in the case of the latter, as it never spends more than two or  three weeks in the pupal state. Here it is the perfect insect that  braves the winter, and not the chrysalis.    There is a great variety in the means taken by the caterpillars of moths  to protect themselves during their metamorphoses, but we shall have  space for only a few illustrations.    A clever cocoon is spun by the larva of the Emperor Moth (_Pavonia_). It  is pear-shaped, and composed of a brownish silk; and is so constructed  that the newly emerged moth can easily walk out of the small end without  breaking a fibre, while the entry of an insect enemy from without is  impossible.    This is managed as follows. A number of rather stiff threads are made to  project from the small end of the cocoon, and these converge as they  pass outward so that the ends are all near together. The other portions  of the cocoon are of compact silk, and any insect intruder that ventures  to enter by what we may almost term the _open_ end is met by a number of  spikes, as it were, that play on it at every attempt. Many of these  wonderful cocoons may be found during the winter months attached to the  food plants of this insect.    Of the silken cocoons spun by various caterpillars some are so thin and  light that the chrysalis can easily be seen through them, and others are  so densely woven as to be quite opaque. A great difference is also to be  observed in the adhesive power of the silk fibres. In some cases little  threads of silk can be pulled off the cocoon; but some of them, that of  the Oak Eggar (page 229) for example, look as if they had been  constructed of paper rather than of silk, because, at the time of  spinning, the moist silk fibres stuck so closely together.    An extreme case of this character is to be met with in the cocoon of the  Puss Moth (page 235); for here the fluid from the spinneret of the  caterpillar does not harden at once on exposure to air, and so the  threads become thoroughly united together, thus forming a solid gluey  cocoon.    When the Puss caterpillar is about to change, it descends the tree  (poplar, willow, or sallow) till it is within a few feet of the ground.  Then it commences gnawing away at the bark, at the same time cementing  all the pieces together with the gluey substance from its spinning  glands. In this way it surrounds itself with a very hard cocoon, which  so closely resembles the surrounding bark in colour that detection is  difficult indeed.    But how will the caterpillar proceed if it is removed from its native  tree and has no bark to gnaw? That you can easily answer for yourself,  or rather Puss will answer it for you. Go and search among the poplars,  willows and sallows in the month of July. You may possibly come across a  caterpillar that is just in the act of creeping down the bark in search  of a resting place; but if not you may be successful in obtaining a few  either by examining the twigs, or you may start them from their hiding  places by smartly tapping the smaller branches with a strong stick.    Having secured one or more larvae, take them home, and they will give  some rather novel performances. If they are not fully grown, you must  supply them with fresh leaves every day till they refuse to eat; and  then is the time for your experiments. Shut one in a little wooden box,  and you will have the pleasure of watching it construct a cocoon of  chips of wood that it has bitten out with its powerful jaws, all joined  together into a hard shell by means of transparent glue. Shut another  Puss in a glass vessel--a tumbler, for instance--either by placing it  under the inverted vessel, or by covering over the top. Perhaps it will  not be superfluous to mention that, should you place it under an  inverted vessel, this vessel should not stand on a polished table, for,  whatever be the material, unless _extremely_ hard, it is sure to be  utilised in the manufacture of the cocoon.    Let us suppose, then, that the caterpillar is under an inverted tumbler  that stands on a plate or saucer. Now it is for _you_ to decide what  material shall be used in the construction of the new home. Give Puss  some fine strips of brightly coloured ribbon, and it will construct a  very gaudy house by gluing them together. Or, provide it with sawdust,  pieces of rag, glass beads, sand, paper, anything in fact; and the  material will be 'made up' into a cocoon more or less ornamental  according to the nature of the supply.    But what if you give it _nothing_ with which to work, and so inclose it  that nothing its jaws can pierce is within its reach? For instance, shut  it in with tumbler and saucer as before, inverting the former on the  latter, and give it no material whatever. What will it do now? We will  watch and see.    At first it is very restless, and walks round and round the edge of the  tumbler, evidently a little dissatisfied with the prospects. Then, after  a little while, the events of nature transpiring in their fixed order  regardless of trivial mishaps, the glutinous fluid begins to flow from  the creature's spinning glands, and it moves about in a somewhat aimless  fashion, applying the transparent adhesive matter both to tumbler and  saucer.    It seems now to become a little more reconciled to its unnatural  surroundings; and, making the best of bad matters, keeps its body in one  place, and starts the construction of a ridge or barrier all round  itself. By the continued application of the creature's spinneret this  barrier is made gradually thicker and higher, till at last the  overhanging sides meet and the caterpillar is inclosed in its  self-constructed prison. But the walls of this prison are so transparent  that every movement can be watched; and, after the insect has spent a  few days in completing the cocoon, we can see it cast off its old skin,  and appear in the new garb of a fine greenish chrysalis.    Its soft green skin soon hardens and turns to a rich dark brown colour,  and it settles down for a long rest lasting till the following May or  June.    When the whole operation of building is completed, lift up the tumbler,  and up will come the saucer too. The two are firmly glued together by  the substance secreted; and the power of this as a cementing material  will be well illustrated if you endeavour by mere pulling force to  separate the two articles.    The Puss is not the only caterpillar that works up a foreign material  with the contents of the spinning organs. There are several others, in  fact, that use for this purpose fragments of wood or other parts of the  food plants; and a still larger number bind together leaves, fresh or  dead, or particles of earth or other matter. Several such cocoons will  be described in our accounts of individual species in another chapter.  We shall now devote a little space to a few general remarks on the  chrysalides and the final metamorphosis of butterflies and moths.          CHAPTER IV    _THE PUPA OR CHRYSALIS_      As soon as the last moult of the caterpillar is over, the chrysalis that  had already been developing under the cover of the old skin is exposed  to full view; and although the perfect insect is not to be liberated for  some time to come, yet some of its parts are apparently fully formed.    [Illustration: FIG. 30.--THE PUPA OF THE PRIVET HAWK (_Ligustri_).]    [Illustration: FIG. 31.--THE CHRYSALIS OF THE LARGE WHITE BUTTERFLY  (_Brassicae_).]    The newly exposed skin of the chrysalis is very soft and moist, but as  it hardens it forms a membranous or horny covering that protects and  holds firmly in place the trunk and the various limbs and appendages  that are distinctly to be traced on the under surface.    If, however, you examine a chrysalis directly after the moult is over,  you will often find that the wings, antennae, proboscis, and legs of the  future butterfly can be easily separated from the trunk of the body on  which they lie by means of a blunt needle, and can be spread out so as  to be quite free from that surface.    In form the chrysalides of butterflies and moths are as variable as the  caterpillars. Many of the former are sharply angular like that of the  'Small Tortoiseshell' already mentioned; but some of the  butterflies--the Skippers (page 197)--have smooth and tapering  chrysalides, and so have most of the moths.    In colour they are equally variable. Some are beautifully tinted with  delicate shades of green, some spotted on a light ground, some striped  with bands more or less gaudy and distinct, but the prevailing tint,  especially among the moths, is a reddish brown, often so deep that it is  almost a black.    [Illustration: FIG. 32.--THE PUPA OF THE DARK GREEN FRITILLARY  (_Aglaia_).]    [Illustration: FIG. 33.--THE PUPA OF THE BLACK-VEINED WHITE BUTTERFLY  (_Crataegi_).]    As a rule there is no marked resemblance between the different stages of  the same insect. Thus, a brilliantly coloured caterpillar may change to  a dull and unattractive chrysalis, from which may emerge a butterfly or  moth that partakes of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34175"],[0,"Domestic Animals (#12)"],[1,"lank; W, plates; X, back, or chine; Y, throat; Z, chest.]      Stall-Feeding.    This ought to be commenced early in the season. An ox may be fed in a  box-stall, or if accustomed to a mate, they do better by tying together  with sufficient room, yet not so near as to allow of injuring each  other. The building should be warm, but not hot; well ventilated, yet  having no current of cold air passing through; and as dark as possible.  The stall ought to be kept clean and dry, and a deep bed of clean straw  is of decided advantage.    The ox should be first fed the inferior and most perishable roots with  his grain and dry forage, and his food should be gradually increased in  richness, as he advances towards maturity. The food and water should be  given three times a day, from thoroughly cleaned mangers or troughs. The  animal likes a change of food, in which he should be indulged as often  as may be necessary. If he refuses his food, a temporary privation, or  variety is essential. When the food is changed, he should be moderately  fed at first, till he becomes accustomed to it, as there is otherwise  danger of cloying, which is always injurious. The moment the animal has  done feeding, the remainder of the food ought to be at once removed. He  then lies down, and if undisturbed, rests quietly till the proper hour  induces him again to look for his accustomed rations. Regularity in the  time of feeding, is of the utmost consequence. An animal soon becomes  habituated to a certain hour, and if it be delayed beyond this, he is  restless and impatient, which are serious obstacles to speedy fattening.    [Illustration: Fig. 13.

Hoven, or Swelling of the Paunch,      Is a temporary ailment, caused by eating too freely of fresh and  generally wet clover, or other succulent food. The animal gorges the  first stomach with so much food, that its contents cannot be expelled.  Inflammation of the membrane takes place, and decomposition of the food  soon follows. This is known by the distension of the paunch, and  difficulty of breathing, and unless speedily relieved, suffocation and  death will ensue. Both sheep and cattle are subject to it.    _Remedies._[1]--In its early stages, when not too severe, it has been  removed by administering some one of the following remedies.    A pint of gin poured down the throat.    From one to two pints of lamp or other oil.    Strong brine.    New milk with one-fifth its bulk of tar mixed.    An egg-shell full of tar forced down the throat, followed by a second,  if the first fails.    A tablespoonful of volatile spirit of ammonia, diluted with water.    A wine-glass full of powder, mixed with cold lard and forced in balls  into the stomach.    A teaspoonful of unslaked lime dissolved in a pint of warm water, shaken  and given immediately.    A pint of tolerably strong lye.    [1] Besides his own experience, the writer has drawn from the N. E.  Farmer, the Albany Cultivator, the American Agriculturist, and other  reliable American and English works, some of the remedies for diseases  herein mentioned.      The Proper Mode of giving the above Remedies    Is for a person to hold the horn and cartilage of the nose, while  another seizes and draws out the tongue as far as possible, when the  medicine is thrust below the root of the tongue. If liquid, it must be  inserted by the use of a bottle.    _The probang_ is used when the former remedies are ineffectual. This  consists of a tarred rope, or a flexible whip-stalk, three-fourths of an  inch in diameter, with a swab or bulbous end. Two persons hold the head  of the animal, so as to keep the mouth in a line with the throat, while  a third forces it into the stomach, when the gas finds a passage out. A  stiff leather tube with a lead nozzle pierced with holes, is best for  insertion, through which the gas will readily escape.    Some one of the above purgatives should be given after the bloat has  subsided, and careful feeding for some days must be observed.    Light gruels are best for allaying inflammation, and restoring the tone  of the stomach.    When no other means are available, the paunch may be tapped with a sharp  penknife, plunging it 11/2 inches forward of the hip bone, towards the  last rib in the left side. If the hole fills up, put in a large  goose-quill tube, which to prevent slipping into the wound, may remain  attached to the feather, and the air can escape through a large hole in  the upper end.    _Prevention_ is vastly better than cure, and may be always secured, by  not allowing hungry cattle to fill themselves with clover, roots,  apples, &c. When first put upon such feed, it should be when the dew and  rain are off, and their stomachs are already partially filled; and they  should then be withdrawn before they have gorged themselves.    [Illustration: Fig. 15.]    [Illustration: Fig. 16.    The Stomach Pump.]    This is a convenient instrument for extracting poisonous substances from  the stomach. It is also highly useful for administering medicines and  injections, and if fitted with several tubes, one may suffice for  animals of any size. It consists of a syringe, _a_, with a side opening  at _b_, and another at the bottom _d_, as shown in Fig. 16. For  injections, Fig. 15 is used, and the end of the syringe is placed in a  vessel containing the fluid, when a probang or injection-tube is screwed  on to the side opening at _b_, through which the fluid is forced into  the stomach or rectum, as may be required. The probang should be a tube  of thick but elastic leather, and it may be passed into the mouth,  through an aperture in a block, placed on edge between the teeth, which  is easily done while a person holds the head of the animal firmly.      Choking    Is frequently relieved by some of the following expedients.    The use of the probang or whip-stock, mentioned under the head of  _remedies for Hoven_, by which the root is forced into the stomach.    A soft root may be crushed so as to allow of swallowing, by holding a  smooth block against it, and striking with a mallet on the opposite  side.    If within arms-length, the root may be removed by hand.    It is said this can be done, by tying up the fore-leg with a small cord,  close to the body, and giving the animal a sudden start with a whip; or  by jerking the fore-leg out forward.    Or pour down the throat a pint bottle full of soft soap, mixed with  sufficient hot water to make it run freely.    _Prevention_ consists in cutting the roots; not feeding them when the  animals are very hungry, and not disturbing them while eating.      Inflammation of the Stomach.    This is frequently produced by a sudden change from dry to green food,  and some other causes.    Epsom salts, castor oil, sulphur, and carbonate of soda, in sufficient  quantity to purge freely, are good remedies.    It may be prevented by changing the food gradually.      Mange, or Scab.    This is denoted by the animal rubbing the hair off about the eyes and  other parts. The skin is scaly or scabby, sometimes appearing like a  large seed-wart.    _Remedies._--Rub the spots with sulphur and lard, after scraping and  washing with soap.    When the skin is cracked, take sulphur, 1 lb.; turpentine, 1/4 lb.;  unguentum, (or mercurial ointment,) 2 ounces; linseed oil, 1 pint. Melt  the turpentine and warm the oil, and when partly cooled, stir in the  sulphur; when cold, add the unguentum, mixing all well. Rub this  thoroughly with the hand on the parts affected.    We have no doubt this, like scab in sheep and itch in the human species,  will be found, on close investigation, to be caused by minute insects  located in the skin. Salt and water ought, in that case, to be a good  remedy.      Hollow Horn, or Horn Ail.    This is not unfrequently _hollow stomach_, and very often follows  stinted fare, hard usage, and exposure to cold. We have noticed this as  most prevalent among oxen that have done a severe winter's work.    _Symptoms._--Bloody urine; swollen udder; shaking the head;"]]]
