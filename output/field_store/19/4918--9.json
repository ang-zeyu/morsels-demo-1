[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32950"],[0,"Camp and Trail (#12)"],[1,"is not nearly as hearty or satisfying as a mouthful of  corn.    _Tomatoes_ are carried extensively, but are very bulky and heavy for  what you get out of them.    _Canned Fruit_ is sheer mad luxury. A handful of the dried article would  equal a half dozen cans.    _Salmon._--A pleasant and compact variation on ordinary fare. It can be  eaten cold, as it comes from the can; or can be fried or baked.    _Picnic Stuff_, such as potted chicken, devilled ham and the rest of it  are abominations.    _Corned Beef_ is fair.    To sum up, I think that if I were to go in for canned goods, I should  concentrate on corn and salmon, with one or two corned beef on the side.    [Sidenote: Desiccated Foods]    As I mentioned at the beginning of this chapter modern desiccation of  foods has helped the wilderness traveler to some extent. I think I have  tried about everything in this line. In the following list I shall  mention those I think good, and also those particularly bad. Any not  mentioned it may be implied that I do not care for myself, but am  willing to admit that you may.    _Canned Eggs._--The very best thing of this kind is made by the National  Bakers' Egg Co., of Sioux City. It is a coarse yellow granulation and  comes in one-pound screw-top tin cans. Each can contains the equivalent  of five dozen eggs, and costs, I think, only $1.25. A tablespoon of the  powder and two of water equals an egg. With that egg you can make  omelets and scrambled eggs, which you could not possibly tell from the  new-laid. Two cans, weighing two pounds, will last you all summer; and  think of the delight of an occasional egg for breakfast! The German  canned eggs--Hoffmeir's is sold in this country--are rather evil  tasting, do not beat up light, and generally decline sullenly to cook.    [Sidenote: Erbswurst]    _Soups._--Some of the compressed soups are excellent. The main  difficulty is that they are put up in flimsy paper packages, difficult  to carry without breaking. Also I have found that when you take but two  kettles, you are generally hungry enough to begrudge one of them to  anything as thin as even the best soup. However, occasionally a hot  cupful is a good thing; and I should always include a few packages. The  most filling and nourishing is the German army ration called  _Erbswurst_. It comes in a sausage-shaped package, which is an exception  to the rule in that it is strongly constructed. You cut off an inch and  boil it. The taste is like that of a thick bean soup. It is said to  contain all the elements of nutrition.    Knorr's packages make good soup when you get hold of the right sort. We  have tried them all, and have decided that they can be divided into two  classes--those that taste like soup, and the dishwater brand. The former  comprise pea, bean, lentil, rice, and onion; the latter, all others.    [Sidenote: Soup Tablets]    Maggi's tablets are smaller than Knorr's and rather better packed. The  green pea and lentil make really delicious soup.    Bouillon capsules of all sorts I have no use for. They serve to flavor  hot water, and that is about all.    _Desiccated Vegetables_ come in tablets about four inches square and a  quarter of an inch thick. A quarter of one of these tablets makes a dish  for two people. You soak it several hours, then boil it. In general the  results are all alike, and equally tasteless and loathsome. The most  notable exception is the string beans. They come out quite like the  original vegetable, both in appearance and taste. I always take some  along. Enough for twenty meals could be carried in the inside pocket of  your waistcoat.    _Julienne_, made by Prevet. A French mixture of carrots and other  vegetables cut into strips and dried. When soaked and boiled it swells  to its original size. A half cupful makes a meal for two. It ranks with  the string beans in being thoroughly palatable. These two preparations  are better than canned goods, and are much more easily carried.    _Potatoes, saxin, saccharine, and crystallose_ I have already mentioned.    [Sidenote: Quantity]    That completes the most elaborate grub list I should care to recommend.  As to a quantitative list, that is a matter of considerably more  elasticity. I have kept track of the exact quantity of food consumed on  a great many trips, and have come to the conclusion that anything but  the most tentative statements must spring from lack of experience. A  man paddling a canoe, or carrying a pack all day, will eat a great deal  more than would the same man sitting a horse. A trip in the clear,  bracing air of the mountains arouses keener appetites than a desert  journey near the borders of Mexico, and a list of supplies ample for the  one would be woefully insufficient for the other. The variation is  really astonishing.    Therefore the following figures must be experimented with rather  cautiously. They represent an average of many of my own trips.    [Sidenote: Grub List]      ONE MONTH'S SUPPLIES FOR ONE MAN ON A FOREST TRIP              15 lbs. flour (includes flour, pancake flour, cornmeal                 in proportion to suit)            15 lbs. meat (bacon or boned ham)            8 lbs. rice            1/2 lb. baking powder            1 lb. tea            2 lbs. sugar            150 saccharine tablets            8 lbs. cereal            1 lb. raisins            Salt and pepper            5 lbs. beans            3 lbs. or 1/2 doz.

Maggi's soups            1/2 doz. dried vegetables--beans and Julienne.    [Sidenote: Don't Figure Grub List too Closely]    These lists are not supposed to be \"eaten down to the bone.\" A man  cannot figure that closely. If you buy just what is included in them you  will be well fed, but will probably have a little left at the end of the  month. If you did not, you would probably begin to worry about the  twenty-fifth day. And this does not pay. Of course if you get game and  fish, you can stay out over the month.          CHAPTER VIII    CAMP COOKERY      [Sidenote: Secret of Camp Cookery]    THE secret of successful camp cookery is experimentation and boldness.  If you have not an ingredient, substitute the nearest thing to it; or  something in the same general class of foods. After you get the logic of  what constitutes a pudding, or bread, or cake, or anything else, cut  loose from cook-books and invent with what is contained in your grub  bags. Do not be content until, by shifting trials, you get your  proportions just right for the best results. Even though a dish is quite  edible, if the possibility of improving it exists, do not be satisfied  with repeating it.    This chapter will not attempt to be a camp cook-book. Plenty of the  latter can be bought. It will try to explain dishes not found in camp  cook-books, but perhaps better adapted to the free and easy culinary  conditions that obtain over an open fire and in the open air.    After _bacon_ gets a little old, parboil the slices before frying them.    [Sidenote: How to Make Bread]    _Bread._--The secret of frying-pan bread is a medium stiff batter in the  proportion of one cup of flour, one teaspoon of salt, one tablespoon of  sugar, and a heaping teaspoon of baking powder. This is poured into the  well-greased and hot pan, and set flat near the fire. In a very few  moments it will rise and stiffen. Prop the pan nearly perpendicular  before the blaze. When done on one side, turn over. A clean sliver or a  fork stuck through the center of the loaf will tell you when it is done:  if the sliver comes out clean, without dough sticking to it, the baking  is finished.    In an oven the batter must be somewhat thinner. Stiff batter makes  close-grained heavy bread; thin batter makes light and crisp bread. The  problem is to strike the happy medium, for if too stiff the loaf is  soggy, and if too thin it sticks to the pan. Dough should be wet only at  the last moment, after the pan is ready, and should be lightly stirred,  never kneaded or beaten.    Biscuits are made in the same way, with the addition of a  dessert-spoonful of cottolene, or a half spoonful of olive oil.    Cornbread is a mixture of half cornmeal and half flour, with salt,  baking powder, and shortening.    [Sidenote: Unleavened Bread]    Unleavened bread properly made is better as a steady diet than any of  the baking powder products. The amateur cook is usually disgusted with  it because it turns out either soggy or leathery. The right method,  however, results in crisp, cracker-like bread, both satisfying and  nourishing. It is made as follows:    Take three-quarters of a cup of either cornmeal, oatmeal, Cream of  Wheat, or Germea, and mix it thoroughly with an equal quantity of flour.  Add a teaspoonful of salt, a tablespoonful of sugar, and a teaspoonful  of olive oil or shortening. Be sure not to exceed the amount of the  latter ingredient. Mix in just enough water to wet thoroughly, and beat  briskly; the result should be almost crumbly. Mold biscuits three inches  across and a quarter of an inch thick,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32958"],[0,"Edge Hill: The Battle and Battlefield; With Notes on Banbury & Thereabout (#12)"],[1,"which the altar could  be watched. The headstone in the churchyard to Captain Gourdin stands by  the path to the Banbury road. The Manor House facing the pool dates from  the later days of Henry VIII.'s reign. Though now in use as two homes, its  hall and oak stairway retain their old style. Of the usual type with  projecting wings and recessed entrance, it looks over the pool and wide  green to the Dassett hills in front. A pathway from the south-west corner  of the churchyard passes through the woods of Deddington Hill and commands  good views of the dale.    RATLEY.--Altitudes, high town, 680; low town, 593; 8 miles north-west of  Banbury. At the point of the long vale, beginning a little south of Ratley  Grange, is Ratley, built in terraces on the hill slope. The red rock of  the Lias covers the brow and high slope; the low town is on the yellow  marls. If it were not for Warmington, it might be said to be the prettiest  village in the district. Descending springs make at their several  outbursts the Bachelor's Trough and the Gogswell. The temperature of the  Bachelor's Trough would seem to be low enough for the humane purposes of  past days. The Church of St. Peter ad Vincula at the hill foot, with a  plain and square tower, bears good appearance from the height and beauty  of the windows (15th century) and the spacious porch of the north side. In  the churchyard on the same side is a cross with steps, plinth and head in  far better preservation than others of the countryside. A curious hummock  at the south-west end of the village is known as the Castle Mound, but it  is probably but a terraced bank naturally formed. Near by is the old manor  house, in bad repair. Beautiful field-ways bear to Arlescot, Warmington,  Hornton, and Horley. The Arlescot path is known as the Tryst-path.    WORMLEIGHTON.--Altitude, 431; population, 191. The village, a few houses  between the mansion and the highway, is on the ridge of the water parting  between the Cherwell and the Avon. The three shire stone is near by.  Hidden by trees from the main road the older settlement is not seen until  quite near, where ampler width of roadway brings tower, house and church  into view. The gateway tower, as the dated shields (1613) tell, is of  later building than the house. It is a plain square tower with connected  side buildings all of the local (Hornton) stone. The archway of the tower  is of good proportions, bearing on the west and south fronts in stone  entablature shields and coats of arms of the Spencers, the latter with the  motto \"Dieu defende droit.\" Inside the archway are warder's doors on  either side, though the approach to the turret is now by an adjoining  building. The ancient turret clock tells time only by its bell.    The manor was bought by John Spencer, Esq., of Sir Wm. Cope, of Hanwell,  in Henry VII.'s days, and the house was built then. It is of the usual  flat red brick of the time, with stone quoins; such as we see of it on the  north and east sides, of handsome proportions and style, and embattled. It  was entered in the inquisition of the time as having sixty persons in  residence, and was then of ampler state and extent. The Tudor brickwork,  though not so elaborated as Compton Wynyates, makes, with that of Hanwell  Castle, good local study. On the south side, a postern leads to the hall,  and of the old front the brickwork and crenellations of the angle remain.  The north entrance, though with no porch now, is at once seen to be the  main way by the proportions of the lobby and its panelled ceiling. On the  right and the left in the lobby are doorways, the one bearing corner  shields and the other triple shields of the house (fret d'or and escallops  of the field).[i] The left doorway opens to the hall, a fine plain room  with large oriel window with bold stone mullions. Above is the star  chamber: the gilt stars remain here and there on the timber work. It is of  like size to the hall, with similar east windows and west side windows,  nearly all bricked up, and a good fireplace with corner shields. It is  coloured to resemble Purbeck marble. Leads and battlements above with  covered niches show the semi-defensive house type of Tudor time. It is  said to have been garrisoned by the Parliamentarians on the evening of the  Edge Hill fight, and that the garrison was captured or driven out by  Prince Rupert. But as to the burning of the house, it is not clear whether  it was then partly destroyed or late in the year after. The Lord Spencer,  a King's man, though at first Parliamentarian, had little liking for Court  ways, and lost his life at the battle of Newbury. Whether the house at  Watergall, two miles to the North-west, of which the foundations only  remain, was of the Spencer holding, and of its fate there is no evidence.  The escallops of the field of the Spencer arms probably find their origin  in the fossil escallops of the Wormleighton stone.    ST. PETER'S CHURCH near by, though plain in all its external decoration,  retains in the interior some work typical of the district. The enamelled  tiles with figures and geometric ornament, the panelling of the chancel  and the carved grotesques of the bench ends are good early work. The  handsome chancel screen removed from the hall, though large for its place,  is of skilled later workmanship; especially rich are the spandrils and  ornament on the inner side of the screen. On the west chancel wall is a  mural tablet to Robert E. Spencer, of date 1610, and an empty tomb is in  an inlet in the north wall of the aisle. Arms of the Spencer family are on  the wall above the belfry arch. A south doorway in the tower and the  carved heads of the tower moulding are worth notice.    SHUTFORD.--Altitudes: high level, 485; low level, 400; population, 283; is  on the inner fringe of hills of the west Oxfordshire border. It rests  mainly on the red rock of the Middle Lias, there as much as 20 to 25 feet  thick. Though mainly of plain agricultural homesteads, it supports a small  community of plush weavers who settled there many generations since, and  who weave a fabric of good repute. The Manor House at the east entrance to  the village is by its height a conspicuous landmark. In the excellence and  strength of its masonry it stands amongst the best of our good houses. On  the south front are porch and square-headed doorway with plain good  moulding and a smaller (postern) door of similar type opening to one of  the south-west rooms. The house appears to be of the style of Broughton,  but of later date, and it is part of the Castle estate. It is not  crenellated, but has similar stone gabling and somewhat smaller windows.  The north front, with projecting wing and entrance, presents a solid wall  of stone covered with fine flint concrete. In its upper storey an angled  fire place and room point to the place of a recluse. The long room of the  upper storey is large enough for the \"the stowering of a troop\"--if time  allowed the quartering of King Charles or Oliver Cromwell in a new place a  legend might be found--it must suffice to know that it was probably the  home of the famous Puritan soldier Nathaniel Fiennes. The hall, well  lighted and with good panelling, is at the north-east of the building, the  further extent of the house on the west side of the court yard is shown by  the old foundation. The kitchen yet keeps its recessed fireplace of ample  space. In the south room there is a chimney piece of Hornton stone with  lozenge-shaped ornament, and the floor stone of the same kind is unusually  good. The Diary of Celia Fiennes, in the time of William and Mary,  mentions \"a neate little house and gardens\" at Shuttford.    ST. MARTIN'S CHURCH, in close touch with the Manor, is of plain early  English work, with a buttressed and pinnacled tower of small proportions.  The nave is on the south side with north chapelry or Lady aisle, heavy  Norman pillars and plain chancel screen. A garden facing the west front  has a stone sun-dial, its plinth covered with ivy, and near by a low stone  building known as the Monastery, said to have been a foundation of the  Knights of St. John. The stonework of the doorway, windows, and stone  bench in the interior are parts of the early work of the house.          A List of Books and Pamphlets relating to Edge Hill and the Battle.
