But it  seems as if nature has not ordained that both combatants should perish  in the duel; but rather that, when finding themselves in the situation  described, namely, opposite, and belly to belly, they fly at that moment  with the utmost precipitation. Thus, when these two rivals felt the  extremities about to meet, they disengaged themselves, and each fled  away. You will observe, Sir, that I have repeated this observation very  often, so that it leaves no room for doubt: and I think that we may here  penetrate the intention of nature.    There ought to be none but one queen in a hive: therefore it is  necessary, if by chance a second is either produced or comes into the  hive, that one of the two must be destroyed. This cannot be committed to  the working bees, because, in a republic composed of so many  individuals, an equal consent cannot be supposed always to exist; it  might frequently happen that one group of bees destroyed one of the  queens, while a second would massacre the other; and the hive thus be  deprived of queens. Therefore it was necessary that the queens  themselves should be entrusted with the destruction of their rivals: but  as, in these combats, nature demands but a single victim, she has wisely  arranged that, at the moment when, from their position, the two  combatants might lose their lives, both feel so great an alarm, that  they think only of flight, and not of using their stings.    I am well aware of the hazard of error in minute researches into the  causes of the most trifling facts. But here the object and the means  seem so plain, that I have ventured to advance my conjectures. You will  judge better than I can, whether they are well founded.--Let me now  return from this digression.    A few minutes after the two queens separated, their terror ceased, and  they again began to seek each other. Immediately on coming in sight,  they rushed together, seized one another, and resumed exactly their  former position. The result of this encounter was the same. When their  bellies approached, they hastily disengaged themselves, and fled with  precipitation. During all this time, the workers seemed in great  agitation; and the tumult appeared to increase when the adversaries  separated. Two different times, we observed them stop the flight of the  queens, seize their limbs, and retain them prisoners above a minute. At  last, the queen, which was either the strongest or the most enraged,  darted on her rival at a moment when unperceived, and with her teeth  caught the origin of the wing; then rising above her, brought the  extremity of her own body under the belly of the other; and, by this  means, easily pierced her with the sting. Then she withdrew her sting  after losing hold of the wing. The vanquished queen fell down, dragged  herself languidly along, and, her strength failing, she soon expired.    This observation proved that virgin queens engage in single combats; but  we wished to discover whether those fecundated, and mothers, had the  same animosity.    On the 22. of July, we selected a flat hive, containing a very fertile  queen: and being curious to learn whether, as virgin queens, she would  destroy the royal cells, three were introduced into the middle of the  comb. Whenever she observed this, _she_ sprung forward on the whole, and  pierced them towards the bottom; nor did she desist until the included  nymphs were exposed. The workers which had hitherto been spectators of  this destruction, now came to carry the nymphs away. They greedily  devoured the food remaining at the bottom of the cells, and also sucked  the fluid from the abdomen of the nymphs: and then terminated with  destroying the cells from which they had been drawn.    In the next place, we introduced a very fertile queen into this hive;  after painting the thorax to distinguish her from the reigning queen. A  circle of bees quickly formed around the stranger, but their intention  was not to caress and receive her well; for they insensibly accumulated  so much, and surrounded her so closely, that in scarcely a minute she  lost her liberty and became a prisoner. It is a remarkable circumstance,  that other workers at the same time collected round the reigning queen  and restrained all her motions; we instantly saw her confined like the  stranger. Perhaps it may be said, the bees anticipated the combat in  which these queens were about to engage, and were impatient to behold  the issue of it, for they retained their prisoners only when they  appeared to withdraw from each other; and if one less restrained seemed  desirous of approaching her rival, all the bees forming the clusters  gave way to allow her full liberty for the attack; then if the queens  testified a disposition to fly, they returned to enclose them.    We have repeatedly witnessed this fact, but it presents so new and  singular a characteristic in the policy of bees, that it must be seen  again a thousand times before any positive assertion can be made on the  subject. I would therefore recommend that naturalists should attentively  examine the combat of queens, and particularly ascertain what part is  taken by the workers. Is their object to accelerate the combat? Do they  by any secret means excite the fury of the combatants? Whence does it  happen that accustomed to bestow every care on their queen, in certain  circumstances, they oppose her preparations to avoid impending danger?    A long series of observations are necessary to solve these problems. It  is an immense field for experiment, which will afford infinitely curious  results. I intreat you to pardon my frequent digressions. The subject is  deeply philosophical, genius such as your's is required to treat it  properly; and I shall now be satisfied with proceeding in the  description of the combat.    The cluster of bees that surrounded the reigning queen having allowed  her some freedom, she seemed to advance towards that part of the comb  where her rival stood; then, all the bees receded before her, the  multitude of workers, separating the two adversaries, gradually  dispersed, until only two remained; these also removed, and allowed the  queens to come in sight. At this moment, the reigning queen rushed on  the stranger, with her teeth seized her near the origin of the wing, and  succeeded in fixing her against the comb without any possibility of  motion or resistance. Next curving her body, she pierced this unhappy  victim of our curiosity with a mortal wound.    In the last place, to exhaust every combination, we had still to examine  whether a combat would ensue between two queens, one impregnated, and  the other a virgin; and what circumstances attended it.    On the 18. of September, we introduced a very fruitful queen into a  glass hive, already containing a virgin queen, and put her on the  opposite side of the comb, that we might have time to see how the  workers would receive her. She was immediately surrounded, but they  confined her only a moment. Being oppressed with the necessity of  laying, she dropped some eggs; however, we could not discover what  became of them; certainly the bees did not convey them to the cells,  for, on inspection, we found none there. The group surrounding this  queen having dispersed a little, she advanced towards the edge of the  comb, and soon approached very near the virgin queen. When in sight,  they rushed together; the virgin queen got on the back of the other, and  gave her several stings in the belly, but, having aimed at the scaly  part, they did not injure her, and the combatants separated. In a few  minutes, they returned to the charge; but this time the impregnated  queen mounted on her rival; however, she sought in vain to pierce her,  for the sting did not enter; the virgin queen then disengaged herself  and fled; she also succeeded in escaping another attack, where her  adversary had the advantage of position. These rivals appeared nearly of  equal strength; and it was difficult to foresee to which side victory  would incline, until at last, by a successful exertion, the virgin queen  mortally wounded the stranger, and she expired in a moment. The sting  had penetrated so far that the victorious queen was unable to extract  it, and she was overthrown by the fall of her enemy. She made great  exertions to disengage the sting: but could succeed by no other means  than turning on the extremity of the belly, as on a pivot. Probably the  barbs of the sting fell by this motion, and, closing like a spiral  around the stem, came more easily from the wound.    These observations, Sir, I think will satisfy you, respecting the  conjecture of our celebrated Reaumur. It is certain, that if several  queens are introduced into a hive, one alone will preserve the empire;  that the others will perish from her attacks; and that the workers will  at no time attempt to employ their stings against the stranger queen. I  can conceive what has misled M. Riems and Schirach; but it is necessary  for explaining it that I should relate a new feature in the policy of  bees, at considerable length.    In the natural state of hives, several queens from different royal  cells, may sometimes exist at the same moment, and they will remain  either until formation of a swarm or a combat among them decides to  which the throne shall appertain. But excepting this case, there never  can be supernumerary queens; and if an observer wishes to introduce one,  he can accomplish it only by force, that is by opening the hive. In a  word, no queen can insinuate herself into a hive in a natural state,  for the following reasons.    Bees preserve a sufficient guard, day and night, at the entrance of  their habitation. These vigilant centinels examine whatever is  presented; and, as if distrusting their eyes, they touch with"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26477"],[0,"Observations on the Florid Song; Or, Sentiments on the Ancient and Modern (#12)"],[1,"ation, and great Name, do on the superior _Cadences_  always make the _Shake_ on the third in _Alt_ to the final Note; since  the _Shake_ (which ought to be resolved) cannot be so in this Case, by  reason of that very third, which being the sixth of the Bass hinders it,  and the _Cadence_ remains without a Resolution. If they should go so far  as to imagine, that the best Rules depended on the _Mode_, I should  notwithstanding think, they might sometimes appeal to the Ear, to know  if That was satisfied with a _Shake_ beaten with the seventh and the  sixth on a Bass which makes the _Cadence_; and I am sure it would  answer. No. From the Rules of the _Ancients_ we learn, that the _Shake_  is to be prepared on the sixth of the Bass, that after it the fifth may  be heard, for that is its proper Place.    Sec. 8. Some others of the same Rank make their _Cadences_ in the Manner of  the Basses, which is, in falling a fifth, with a Passage of Swift Notes  descending gradually, supposing that by this Means they cover the  _Octaves_, which, tho' disguised, will still appear.    Sec. 9. I hold it also for certain, that no Professor of the first Rank, in  any _Cadence_ whatsoever, can be allowed to make _Shakes_, or  _Divisions_, on the last Syllables but one of these  Words,--_Confondero_--_Amero_, &c. for they are Ornaments that do not  suit on those Syllables which are short, but do well on the  Antecedent.[84]    Sec. 10. Very many of the second Class end the inferior _Cadences_ in the  _French_ Manner without a _Shake_[85], either for want of Ability to  make one, or from its being easy to copy them, or from their Desire of  finding out something that may in Appearance support the name of  _Modern_. But in Fact they are mistaken; for the _French_ do not leave  out the _Shake_ on the inferior _Cadences_, except in the _Pathetick  Airs_; and our _Italians_, who are used to over-do the _Mode_, exclude  it every where, tho' in the _Allegro_ the _Shake_ is absolutely  necessary. I know, that a good Singer may with Reason abstain from the  _Shake_ in the _Cantabile_; however, it should be rarely; for if one of  those _Cadences_ be tolerable without that pleasing Grace, it is  absolutely impossible not to be tired at length, with a Number one after  another that die suddenly.    Sec. 11. I find that all the _Moderns_ (let them be Friends or Foes to the  _Shake_) in the inferior _Cadences_ beforementioned go with an  _Appoggiatura_ to the final Note, on the penultimate Syllable of a Word;  and this likewise is a Defect, it appearing to me, that on such  Occasions the _Appoggiatura_ is not pleasing but on the last Syllable,  after the Manner of the _Ancients_, or of those who know how to  sing.[86]    Sec.12. If, in the inferior _Cadences_, the best Singers of these Days  think they are not in the wrong in making you hear the final Note before  the Bass[87], they deceive themselves grossly; for it is a very great  Error, hurts the Ear, and is against the Rules; and becomes doubly so,  going (as they do) to the same Note with an _Appoggiatura_, the which  either ascending or descending, if not after the Bass[88], is always  very bad.    Sec. 13. And is it not worst of all, to torment the Hearers with a thousand  _Cadences_ all in the same Manner? From whence proceeds this Sterility,  since every Professor knows, that the surest way of gaining Esteem in  Singing is a Variety in the Repetition?    Sec. 14. If among all the _Cadences_ in the _Airs_, the last allows a  moderate Liberty to the Singer, to distinguish the end of them, the  Abuse of it is insufferable. But it grows abomable, when the Singer  persists with his tiresome Warbling, nauseating the Judicious, who  suffer the more, because they know that the Composers leave generally in  every _final Cadence_ some Note, sufficient to make a discreet  Embellishment; without seeking for it out of Time, without Taste,  without Art, and without Judgment.[89]    Sec. 15. I am still more surprised when I reflect, that the _modern_ Stile,  after having exposed all the _Cadences_ of the theatrical _Airs_ to the  Martyrdom of a perpetual Motion, will likewise have the Cruelty to  condemn to the same Punishment not Those in the _Cantata's_ only, but  also the _Cadences_ of their _Recitatives_. Do these Singers pretend, by  their not distinguishing the Chamber-Musick from the immoderate  _Gargling_ of the Stage, to expect the vulgar _E Viva's_ in the Cabinet  of Princes?    Sec. 16. Let a sensible Student avoid this Example, and with this Example  the Abuses, the Defects, and every other Thing that is mean and common,  as well in the _Cadences_ as elsewhere.    Sec. 17. If, the inventing particular _Cadences_ without injuring the Time,  has been one of the worthy Employments of the _Ancients_ (so call'd) let  a Student revive the Use of it; endeavouring to imitate them in their  Skill of somewhat anticipating the Time; and remember, that Those, who  understand the Art of Gracing, do not wait to admire the Beauty of it in  a Silence of the Bass.    Sec. 18. Many and many other Errors are heard in the _Cadences_ that were  _Antique_, and which are now become _Modern_; they were ridiculous then,  and are so now; therefore considering, that to change the Stile is not  always to improve it, I may fairly conclude, that what is bad is to be  corrected by Study, and not by the _Mode_.    Sec. 19. Now let us for a while leave at Rest the Opinions of the aforesaid  Ancients, and the supposed _Moderns_, to take notice what Improvement  the Scholar has made, since he is desirous of being heard. Well then,  let him attend, before we part with him, to Instructions of more Weight,  that he may at least deserve the Name of a good Singer, though he may  not arrive at that of an eminent one.          CHAP. IX.    _Observations for a Singer._[90]      Behold the Singer now appearing in Publick, from the Effects of his  Application to the Study of the foregoing Lessons. But to what Purpose  does he appear? Whoever, in the great Theatre of the World, does not  distinguish himself, makes but a very insignificant Figure.    Sec. 2. From the cold Indifference perceived in many Singers, one would  believe that the Science of Musick implored their Favour, to be  received by them as their most humble Servant.    Sec. 3. If too many did not persuade themselves that they had studied  sufficiently, there would not be such a Scarcity of the Best, nor such a  Swarm of the Worst. These, because they can sing by Heart three or four  _Kyrie's_[91], think they are arrived at the _Non plus ultra_; but if  you give them a _Cantata_ to sing, that is even easy, and fairly  written, they, instead of complying as they ought, will tell you with an  impudent Face, that Persons of their Degree are not obliged to sing in  the vulgar Tongue at Sight. And who can forbear laughing? For a Musician  knowing that the Words, let them be either _Latin_ or _Italian_, do not  change the Form of the Notes, must immediately conclude, that this pert  Answer of the great Man proceeds from his not being able to sing at  Sight, or from his not knowing how to read; and he judges right.    Sec. 4. There are an infinite Number[92] of others, who wish and sigh for  the Moment that eases them from the painful Fatigue of their first  Studies, hoping to have a Chance to make one in the Crowd of the second  Rate; and stumbling by good Luck on something that gives them Bread,  they immediately make a Legg to Musick and its Study, not caring whether  the World knows they are, or are not among the Living. These do not  consider that _Mediocrity_ in a Singer means _Ignorance_.    Sec. 5. There are also several who study nothing but the Defects, and are  endow'd with a marvelous Aptness to learn them all, having so happy a  Memory as never to forget them. Their Genius is so inclined to the Bad,  that if by Gift of Nature they had the best of Voices, they would be  discontented if they could not find some Means to make it the worst.    Sec. 6. One of a better Spirit will endeavour to keep better Company. He  will be sensible of the Necessity of farther Discoveries, of farther  Instructions, and even of another Master, of whom, besides the Art of  Singing, he would be glad to learn how to behave himself with good  Breeding. This, added to the Merit acquired by his Singing, may give him  Hopes of the Favour of Princes, and of an universal Esteem.    Sec. 7. If he aims at the Character of a young Man of Wit and Judgment, let  him not be vulgar or too bold.    Sec. 8. Let him shun low and disreputable Company, but, above all, such as  abandon themselves to scandalous Liberties.    Sec. 9. That Professor ought not to be frequented, though excellent in this  Art, whose behaviour is vulgar and discreditable, and who cares not,  provided he makes his Fortune, whether it be at the Expence of his  Reputation.    Sec. 10. The best School is the Nobility, from whom every thing that is  genteel is to be learned; but when a Musician finds that his Company is  not proper, let him retire without repining, and his Modesty will be to  his Commendation.    Sec. 11. If he should not meet with a Gratification from the Great, let him  never complain; for it is better to get but little, than to lose a great  deal, and that is not seldom the Case. The best he can do, is to be  assiduous in serving them, that at least he may hope for the Pleasure of  seeing them for once grateful, or be convinced for ever of their being  ungrateful.    Sec. 12. My long and repeated Travels have given me an Opportunity of being  acquainted with most of the Courts of _Europe_, and Examples, more than  my Words, should persuade every able Singer to see them also; but  without yielding up his Liberty to their Allurements: For Chains,  though of Gold, are still Chains; and they are not all of that precious  Metal: Besides, the several Inconveniencies of Disgrace, Mortifications,  Uncertainty; and, above "]]]
