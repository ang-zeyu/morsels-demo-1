[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/316"],[0,"The Golden Road (#12)"],[1,"it still looked like a storm, though  no more so than it had in the morning. We intended to go home by a  different path--one leading through cleared land overgrown with scrub  maple, which had the advantage of being farther away from Peg Bowen's  house. We hoped to be home before it began to storm, but we had hardly  reached the hill above the village when a fine, driving snow began to  fall. It would have been wiser to have turned back even then; but we  had already come a mile and we thought we would have ample time to reach  home before it became really bad. We were sadly mistaken; by the time  we had gone another half-mile we were in the thick of a bewildering,  blinding snowstorm. But it was by now just as far back to Cousin  Mattie's as it was to Uncle Alec's, so we struggled on, growing more  frightened at every step. We could hardly face the stinging snow, and we  could not see ten feet ahead of us. It had turned bitterly cold and  the tempest howled all around us in white desolation under the  fast-darkening night. The narrow path we were trying to follow soon  became entirely obliterated and we stumbled blindly on, holding to each  other, and trying to peer through the furious whirl that filled the air.  Our plight had come upon us so suddenly that we could not realize it.  Presently Peter, who was leading the van because he was supposed to know  the path best, stopped.    \"I can't see the road any longer,\" he shouted. \"I don't know where we  are.\"    We all stopped and huddled together in a miserable group. Fear filled  our hearts. It seemed ages ago that we had been snug and safe and warm  at Cousin Mattie's. Cecily began to cry with cold. Dan, in spite of her  protests, dragged off his overcoat and made her put it on.    \"We can't stay here,\" he said. \"We'll all freeze to death if we do. Come  on--we've got to keep moving. The snow ain't so deep yet. Take hold of  my hand, Cecily. We must all hold together. Come, now.\"    \"It won't be nice to be frozen to death, but if we get through alive  think what a story we'll have to tell,\" said the Story Girl between her  chattering teeth.    In my heart I did not believe we would ever get through alive. It was  almost pitch dark now, and the snow grew deeper every moment. We were  chilled to the heart. I thought how nice it would be to lie down and  rest; but I remembered hearing that that was fatal, and I endeavoured to  stumble on with the others. It was wonderful how the girls kept up, even  Cecily. It occurred to me to be thankful that Sara Ray was not with us.    But we were wholly lost now. All around us was a horror of great  darkness. Suddenly Felicity fell. We dragged her up, but she declared  she could not go on--she was done out.    \"Have you any idea where we are?\" shouted Dan to Peter.    \"No,\" Peter shouted back, \"the wind is blowing every which way. I  haven't any idea where home is.\"    Home! Would we ever see it again? We tried to urge Felicity on, but she  only repeated drowsily that she must lie down and rest. Cecily, too,  was reeling against me. The Story Girl still stood up staunchly and  counselled struggling on, but she was numb with cold and her words were  hardly distinguishable. Some wild idea was in my mind that we must dig a  hole in the snow and all creep into it. I had read somewhere that people  had thus saved their lives in snowstorms. Suddenly Felix gave a shout.    \"I see a light,\" he cried.    \"Where? Where?\" We all looked but could see nothing.    \"I don't see it now but I saw it a moment ago,\" shouted Felix. \"I'm sure  I did. Come on--over in this direction.\"    Inspired with fresh hope we hurried after him. Soon we all saw the  light--and never shone a fairer beacon. A few more steps and, coming  into the shelter of the woodland on the further side, we realized where  we were.    \"That's Peg Bowen's house,\" exclaimed Peter, stopping short in dismay.    \"I don't care whose house it is,\" declared Dan. \"We've got to go to it.\"    \"I s'pose so,\" acquiesced Peter ruefully. \"We can't freeze to death even  if she is a witch.\"    \"For goodness' sake don't say anything about witches so close to her  house,\" gasped Felicity. \"I'll be thankful to get in anywhere.\"    We reached the house, climbed the flight of steps that led to that  mysterious second story door, and Dan rapped. The door opened promptly  and Peg Bowen stood before us, in what seemed exactly the same costume  she had worn on the memorable day when we had come, bearing gifts, to  propitiate her in the matter of Paddy.    \"Behind her was a dim room scantly illumined by the one small candle  that had guided us through the storm; but the old Waterloo stove was  colouring the gloom with tremulous, rose-red whorls of light, and warm  and cosy indeed seemed Peg's retreat to us snow-covered, frost-chilled,  benighted wanderers.    \"Gracious goodness, where did yez all come from?\" exclaimed Peg. \"Did  they turn yez out?\"    \"We've been over to Baywater, and we got lost in the storm coming back,\"  explained Dan. \"We didn't know where we were till we saw your light.  I guess we'll have to stay here till the storm is over--if you don't  mind.\"    \"And if it won't inconvenience you,\" said Cecily timidly.    \"Oh, it's no inconvenience to speak of. Come in. Well, yez HAVE got some  snow on yez. Let me get a broom. You boys stomp your feet well and shake  your coats. You girls give me your things and I'll hang them up. Guess  yez are most froze. Well, sit up to the stove and git het up.\"    Peg bustled away to gather up a dubious assortment of chairs, with backs  and rungs missing, and in a few minutes we were in a circle around her  roaring stove, getting dried and thawed out. In our wildest flights  of fancy we had never pictured ourselves as guests at the witch's  hearth-stone. Yet here we were; and the witch herself was actually  brewing a jorum of ginger tea for Cecily, who continued to shiver long  after the rest of us were roasted to the marrow. Poor Sis drank that  scalding draught, being in too great awe of Peg to do aught else.    \"That'll soon fix your shivers,\" said our hostess kindly. \"And now I'll  get yez all some tea.\"    \"Oh, please don't trouble,\" said the Story Girl hastily.    \"'Tain't any trouble,\" said Peg briskly; then, with one of the sudden  changes to fierceness which made her such a terrifying personage, \"Do  yez think my vittels ain't clean?\"    \"Oh, no, no,\" cried Felicity quickly, before the Story Girl could speak,  \"none of us would ever think THAT. Sara only meant she didn't want you  to go to any bother on our account.\"    \"It ain't any bother,\" said Peg, mollified. \"I'm spry as a cricket this  winter, though I have the realagy sometimes. Many a good bite I've had  in your ma's kitchen. I owe yez a meal.\"    No more protests were made. We sat in awed silence, gazing with timid  curiosity about the room, the stained, plastered walls of which were  well-nigh covered with a motley assortment of pictures, chromos, and  advertisements, pasted on without much regard for order or character.    We had heard much of Peg's pets and now we saw them. Six cats occupied  various cosy corners; one of them, the black goblin which had so  terrified us in the summer, blinked satirically at us from the centre of  Peg's bed. Another, a dilapidated, striped beastie, with both ears and  one eye gone, glared at us from the sofa in the corner. A dog, with only  three legs, lay behind the stove; a crow sat on a roost above our  heads, in company with a matronly old hen; and on the clock shelf were  a stuffed monkey and a grinning skull. We had heard that a sailor had  given Peg the monkey. But where had she got the skull? And whose was it?  I could not help puzzling over these gruesome questions.    Presently tea was ready and we gathered around the festal board--a board  literally as well as figuratively, for Peg's table was the work of her  own unskilled hands. The less said about the viands of that meal, and  the dishes they were served in, the better. But we ate them--bless you,  yes!--as we would have eaten any witch's banquet set before us. Peg  might or might not be a witch--common sense said not; but we knew she  was quite capable of turning every one of us out of doors in one of  her sudden fierce fits if we offended her; and we had no mind to trust  ourselves again to that wild forest where we had fought a losing fight  with the demon forces of night and storm.    But it was not an agreeable meal in more ways than one. Peg was not  at all careful of anybody's feelings. She hurt Felix's cruelly as she  passed him his cup of tea.    \"You've gone too much to flesh, boy. So the magic seed didn't work,  hey?\"    How in the world had Peg found out about that magic seed? Felix looked  uncommonly foolish.    \"If you'd come to me in the first place I'd soon have told you how to  get thin,\" said Peg, nodding wisely.    \"Won't you tell me now?\" asked Felix eagerly, his desire to melt his too  solid flesh overcoming his dread and shame.    \"No, I don't like being second fiddle,\" answered Peg with a crafty  smile. \"Sara, you're too scrawny and pale--not much like your ma. I knew  her well. She was counted a beauty, but she made no great things of a  match. Your father had some money but he was a tramp like meself. Where  is he now?\"    \"In Rome,\" said the Story Girl rather shortly.    \"People thought your ma was crazy when she took him. But she'd a right  to please herself. Folks is too ready to call other folks crazy. There's  people who say I'M not in my right mind. Did yez ever\"--Peg fixed  Felicity with a piercing glance--\"hear anything so ridiculous?\"    \"Never,\" said Felicity, white to the lips.    \"I wish everybody was as sane as I am,\" said Peg scornfully. Then she  looked poor Felicity over critically. \"You're good-looking but proud.  And your complexion won't wear. It'll be like your ma's yet--too much  red in it.\"    \"Well, that's better than being the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31619"],[0,"The Planet Savers (#12)"],[1," unattached female. Such women are not permitted in the Nests.\"    \"That's easy, then,\" Lerrys said. \"She must belong to one of us.\" He  didn't add a syllable. No one could have expected it; Darkovan  aristocrats don't bring their women on trips like this, and their women  are not like Kyla.    The three brothers broke into a spate of volunteering, and Rafe made an  obscene suggestion. Kyla scowled obstinately, her mouth tight with what  could have been embarrassment or rage. \"If you believe I need your  protection--!\"    \"Kyla,\" I said tersely, \"is under _my_ protection. She will be  introduced as my woman--and treated as such.\"    Rafe twisted his mouth in an un-funny smile. \"I see the leader keeps all  the best for himself?\"    My face must have done something I didn't know about, for Rafe backed  slowly away. I forced myself to speak slowly: \"Kyla is a guide, and  indispensable. If anything happens to me, she is the only one who can  lead you back. Therefore her safety is my personal affair. Understand?\"           *       *       *       *       *    As we went along the trail, the vague green light disappeared. \"We're  right below the Trailcity,\" I whispered, and pointed upward. All around  us the Hundred Trees rose, branchless pillars so immense that four men,  hands joined, could not have encircled one with their arms. They  stretched upward for some three hundred feet, before stretching out  their interweaving branches; above that, nothing was visible but  blackness.    Yet the grove was not dark, but lighted with the startlingly brilliant  phosphorescence of the fungi growing on the trunks, and trimmed into  bizarre ornamental shapes. In cages of transparent fibre, glowing  insects as large as a hand hummed softly and continuously.    As I watched, a trailman--quite naked except for an ornate hat and a  narrow binding around the loins--descended the trunk. He went from cage  to cage, feeding the glow-worms with bits of shining fungus from a  basket on his arm.    I called to him in his own language, and he dropped the basket, with an  exclamation, his spidery thin body braced to flee or to raise an alarm.    \"But I belong to the Nest,\" I called to him, and gave him the names of  my foster-parents. He came toward me, gripping my forearm with warm long  fingers in a gesture of greeting.    \"Jason? Yes, I hear them speak of you,\" he said in his gentle twittering  voice, \"you are at home. But those others--?\" He gestured nervously at  the strange faces.    \"My friends,\" I assured him, \"and we come to beg the Old One for an  audience. For tonight I seek shelter with my parents, if they will  receive us.\"    He raised his head and called softly, and a slim child bounded down the  trunk and took the basket. The trailman said, \"I am Carrho. Perhaps it  would be better if I guided you to your foster-parents, so you will not  be challenged.\"    I breathed more freely. I did not personally recognize Carrho, but he  looked pleasantly familiar. Guided by him, we climbed one by one up the  dark stairway inside the trunk, and emerged into the bright square,  shaded by the topmost leaves into a delicate green twilight. I felt  weary and successful.    Kendricks stepped gingerly on the swaying, jiggling floor of the square.  It gave slightly at every step, and Kendricks swore morosely in a  language that fortunately only Rafe and I understood. Curious trailmen  flocked to the street and twittered welcome and surprise.           *       *       *       *       *    Rafe and Kendricks betrayed considerable contempt when I greeted my  foster-parents affectionately. They were already old, and I was saddened  to see it; their fur graying, their prehensile toes and fingers crooked  with a rheumatic complaint of some sort, their reddish eyes bleared and  rheumy. They welcomed me, and made arrangements for the others in my  party to be housed in an abandoned house nearby ... they had insisted  that I, of course, must return to their roof, and Kyla, of course, had  to stay with me.    \"Couldn't we camp on the ground instead?\" Kendricks asked, eying the  flimsy shelter with distaste.    \"It would offend our hosts,\" I said firmly. I saw nothing wrong with it.  Roofed with woven bark, carpeted with moss which was planted on the  floor, the place was abandoned, somewhat a bit musty, but weathertight  and seemed comfortable to me.    The first thing to be done was to despatch a messenger to the Old One,  begging the favor of an audience with him. That done, (by one of my  foster-brothers), we settled down to a meal of buds, honey, insects and  birds eggs! It tasted good to me, with the familiarity of food eaten in  childhood, but among the others, only Kyla ate with appetite and Regis  Hastur with interested curiosity.           *       *       *       *       *    After the demands of hospitality had been satisfied, my foster-parents  asked the names of my party, and I introduced them one by one. When I  named Regis Hastur, it reduced them to brief silence, and then to an  outcry; gently but firmly, they insisted that their home was unworthy to  shelter the son of a Hastur, and that he must be fittingly entertained  at the Royal Nest of the Old One.    There was no gracious way for Regis to protest, and when the messenger  returned, he prepared to accompany him. But before leaving, he drew me  aside:    \"I don't much like leaving the rest of you--\"    \"You'll be safe enough.\"    \"It's not that I'm worried about, Dr. Allison.\"    \"Call me Jason,\" I corrected angrily. Regis said, with a little  tightening of his mouth, \"That's it. You'll have to be Dr. Allison  tomorrow when you tell the Old One about your mission. But you have to  be the Jason he knows, too.\"    \"So--?\"    \"I wish I needn't leave here. I wish you were--going to stay with the  men who know you only as Jason, instead of being alone--or only with  Kyla.\"    There was something odd in his face, and I wondered at it. Could he--a  Hastur--be jealous of Kyla? Jealous of _me_? It had never occurred to me  that he might be somehow attracted to Kyla. I tried to pass it off  lightly:    \"Kyla might divert me.\"    Regis said without emphasis, \"Yet she brought Dr. Allison back once  before.\" Then, surprisingly, he laughed. \"Or maybe you're right. Maybe  Kyla will--scare away Dr. Allison if he shows up.\"           *       *       *       *       *    The coals of the dying fire laid strange tints of color on Kyla's face  and shoulders and the wispy waves of her dark hair. Now that we were  alone, I felt constrained.    \"Can't you sleep, Jason?\"    I shook my head. \"Better sleep while you can.\" I felt that this night  of all nights I dared not close my eyes or when I woke I would have  vanished into the Jay Allison I hated. For a moment I saw the room with  his eyes; to him it would not seem cosy and clean, but--habituated to  white sterile tile, Terran rooms and corridors--dirty and unsanitary as  any beast's den.    Kyla said broodingly, \"You're a strange man, Jason. What sort of man are  you--in Terra's world?\"    I laughed, but there was no mirth in it. Suddenly I had to tell her the  whole truth:    \"Kyla, the man you know as me doesn't exist. I was created for this one  specific task. Once it's finished, so am I.\"    She started, her eyes widening. \"I've heard tales of--of the Terrans and  their sciences--that they make men who aren't real, men of metal--not  bone and flesh--\"    Before the dawning of that naive horror I quickly held out my bandaged  hand, took her fingers in mine and ran them over it. \"Is this metal? No,  no, Kyla. But the man you know as Jason--I won't be him, I'll be someone  different--\" How could I explain a subsidiary personality to Kyla, when  I didn't understand it myself?    She kept my fingers in hers softly and said, \"I saw--someone  else--looking from your eyes at me once. A ghost.\"    I shook my head savagely. \"To the Terrans, I'm the ghost!\"    \"Poor ghost,\" she whispered.    Her pity stung. I didn't want it.    \"What I don't remember I can't regret. Probably I won't even remember  you.\" But I lied. I knew that although I forgot everything else,  unregretting because unremembered, I could not bear to lose this girl,  that my ghost would walk restless forever if I forgot her. I looked  across the fire at Kyla, cross-legged in the faint light--only a few  coals in the brazier. She had removed her sexless outer clothing, and  wore some clinging garment, as simple as a child's smock and curiously  appealing. There was still a little ridge of bandage visible beneath it  and a random memory, not mine, remarked in the back corners of my brain  that with the cut improperly sutured there would be a visible scar.  _Visible to whom?_    She reached out an appealing hand. \"Jason! Jason--?\"           *       *       *       *       *    My self-possession deserted me. I felt as if I stood, small and reeling,  under a great empty echoing chamber which was Jay Allison's mind, and  that the roof was about to fall in on me. Kyla's image flickered in and  out of focus, first infinitely gentle and appealing, then--as if seen at  the wrong end of a telescope--far away and sharply incised and as remote  and undesirable as any bug underneath a lens.    Her hands closed on my shoulders. I put out a groping hand to push her  away.    \"Jason,\" she implored, \"don't--go away from me like that! Talk to me,  tell me!\"    But her words reached me through emptiness.... I knew important things  might hang on tomorrow's meeting, Jason alone could come through that  meeting, where the Terrans for some reason put him through this hell and  damnation and torture ... oh, yes ... the trailmen's fever.    Jay Allison pushed the girl's hand away and scowled savagely, trying to  collect his thoughts and concentrate them on what he must say and do, to  convince the trailmen of their duty toward the rest of the planet. As if  they--not even human--could have a sense of duty!    With"]]]
