It is a barrier between two great schools of early  architecture. On one side it was cut by Romanesque workmen of the early  Christian ages, and furnishes us with a distinct type of a kind of  ornament which, as we meet with other examples of it, we shall be able  to describe in generic terms, and to throw back behind this balustrade,  out of our way. The _front_ of the balustrade presents us with a totally  different condition of design, less rich, more graceful, and here shown  in its simplest possible form. From the outside of this bar of marble we  shall commence our progress in the study of existing Venetian  architecture. The only question is, do we begin from the tenth or from  the twelfth century?    Sec. XXXIII. I was in great hopes once of being able to determine this  positively; but the alterations in all the early buildings of Venice are  so numerous, and the foreign fragments introduced so innumerable, that I  was obliged to leave the question doubtful. But one circumstance must be  noted, bearing upon it closely.    In the woodcut on page 50, Fig. III., _b_ is an archivolt of Murano, _a_  one of St. Mark's; the latter acknowledged by all historians and all  investigators to be of the twelfth century.    _All_ the twelfth century archivolts in Venice, without exception, are  on the model of _a_, differing only in their decorations and sculpture.  There is not one which resembles that of Murano.    But the deep mouldings of Murano are almost exactly similar to those of  St. Michele of Pavia, and other Lombard churches built, some as early as  the seventh, others in the eighth, ninth, and tenth centuries.    On this ground it seems to me probable that the existing apse of Murano  is part of the original earliest church, and that the inscribed  fragments used in it have been brought from the mainland. The  balustrade, however, may still be later than the rest; it will be  examined, hereafter, more carefully.[15]    I have not space to give any farther account of the exterior of the  building, though one half of what is remarkable in it remains untold. We  must now see what is left of interest within the walls.    [Illustration: Fig. III.]    Sec. XXXIV. All hope is taken away by our first glance; for it falls on a  range of shafts whose bases are concealed by wooden panelling, and which  sustain arches decorated in the most approved style of Renaissance  upholstery, with stucco roses in squares under the soffits, and egg and  arrow mouldings on the architraves, gilded, on a ground of spotty black  and green, with a small pink-faced and black-eyed cherub on every  keystone; the rest of the church being for the most part concealed  either by dirty hangings, or dirtier whitewash, or dim pictures on  warped and wasting canvas; all vulgar, vain, and foul. Yet let us not  turn back, for in the shadow of the apse our more careful glance shows  us a Greek Madonna, pictured on a field of gold; and we feel giddy at  the first step we make on the pavement, for it, also, is of Greek mosaic  waved like the sea, and dyed like a dove's neck.    Sec. XXXV. Nor are the original features of the rest of the edifice  altogether indecipherable; the entire series of shafts marked in the  ground plan on each side of the nave, from the western entrance to the  apse, are nearly uninjured; and I believe the stilted arches they  sustain are those of the original fabric, though the masonry is covered  by the Renaissance stucco mouldings. Their capitals, for a wonder, are  left bare, and appear to have sustained no farther injury than has  resulted from the insertion of a large brass chandelier into each of  their abaci, each chandelier carrying a sublime wax candle two inches  thick, fastened with wire to the wall above. The due arrangement of  these appendages, previous to festal days, can only be effected from a  ladder set against the angle of the abacus; and ten minutes before I  wrote this sentence, I had the privilege of watching the candlelighter  at his work, knocking his ladder about the heads of the capitals as if  they had given him personal offence. He at last succeeded in breaking  away one of the lamps altogether, with a bit of the marble of the  abacus; the whole falling in ruin to the pavement, and causing much  consultation and clamor among a tribe of beggars who were assisting the  sacristan with their wisdom respecting the festal arrangements.    Sec. XXXVI. It is fortunate that the capitals themselves, being somewhat  rudely cut, can bear this kind of treatment better than most of those in  Venice. They are all founded on the Corinthian type, but the leaves are  in every one different: those of the easternmost capital of the southern  range are the best, and very beautiful, but presenting no feature of  much interest, their workmanship being inferior to most of the  imitations of Corinthian common at the period; much more to the rich  fantasies which we have seen at Torcello. The apse itself, to-day (12th  September, 1851), is not to be described; for just in front of it,  behind the altar, is a magnificent curtain of new red velvet with a  gilt edge and two golden tassels, held up in a dainty manner by two  angels in the upholsterer's service; and above all, for concentration of  effect, a star or sun, some five feet broad, the spikes of which conceal  the whole of the figure of the Madonna except the head and hands.    Sec. XXXVII. The pavement is however still left open, and it is of  infinite interest, although grievously distorted and defaced. For whenever  a new chapel has been built, or a new altar erected, the pavement has been  broken up and readjusted so as to surround the newly inserted steps or  stones with some appearance of symmetry; portions of it either covered or  carried away, others mercilessly shattered or replaced by modern  imitations, and those of very different periods, with pieces of the old  floor left here and there in the midst of them, and worked round so as to  deceive the eye into acceptance of the whole as ancient. The portion,  however, which occupies the western extremity of the nave, and the parts  immediately adjoining it in the aisles, are, I believe, in their original  positions, and very little injured: they are composed chiefly of groups  of peacocks, lions, stags, and griffins,--two of each in a group,  drinking out of the same vase, or shaking claws together,--enclosed by  interlacing bands, and alternating with chequer or star patterns, and  here and there an attempt at representation of architecture, all worked  in marble mosaic. The floors of Torcello and of St. Mark's are executed  in the same manner; but what remains at Murano is finer than either, in  the extraordinary play of color obtained by the use of variegated  marbles. At St. Mark's the patterns are more intricate, and the pieces  far more skilfully set together; but each piece is there commonly of one  color: at Murano every fragment is itself variegated, and all are  arranged with a skill and feeling not to be caught, and to be observed  with deep reverence, for that pavement is not dateless, like the rest of  the church; it bears its date on one of its central circles, 1140, and  is, in my mind, one of the most precious monuments in Italy, showing thus  early, and in those rude chequers which the bared knee of the Murano  fisher wears in its daily bending, the beginning of that mighty spirit of  Venetian color, which was to be consummated in Titian.    Sec. XXXVIII. But we must quit the church for the present, for its  garnishings are completed; the candles are all upright in their sockets,  and the curtains drawn into festoons, and a paste-board crescent, gay  with artificial flowers, has been attached to the capital of every  pillar, in order, together with the gilt angels, to make the place look  as much like Paradise as possible. If we return to-morrow, we shall find  it filled with woful groups of aged men and women, wasted and  fever-struck, fixed in paralytic supplication, half-kneeling,  half-couched upon the pavement; bowed down, partly in feebleness, partly  in a fearful devotion, with their grey clothes cast far over their  faces, ghastly and settled into a gloomy animal misery, all but the  glittering eyes and muttering lips.    Fit inhabitants, these, for what was once the Garden of Venice, \"a  terrestrial paradise,--a place of nymphs and demi-gods!\"[16]    Sec. XXXIX. We return, yet once again, on the following day. Worshippers  and objects of worship, the sickly crowd and gilded angels, all are  gone; and there, far in the apse, is seen the sad Madonna standing in  her folded robe, lifting her hands in vanity of blessing. There is  little else to draw away our thoughts from the solitary image. An old  wooden tablet, carved into a rude effigy of San Donato, which occupies  the central niche in the lower part of the tribune, has an interest of  its own, but is unconnected with the history of the older church. The  faded frescoes of saints, which cover the upper tier of the wall of the  apse, are also of comparatively recent date, much more the piece of  Renaissance workmanship, shaft and entablature, above the altar, which  has been thrust into the midst of all, and has cut away part of the feet  of the Madonna. Nothing remains of the original structure but the  semi-dome itself, the cornice whence it springs, which is the same as  that used on the exterior of the church, and the border and face-arch  which surround it. The ground of the dome is of gold, unbroken except by  the upright Madonna, and usual inscription, M R [Greek: Theta] V. The  figure wears a robe of blue, deeply fringed with gold, which seems to be  gathered on the head and thrown back on the shoulders, crossing the  breast, and falling in many folds to the ground. The under robe, shown"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30756"],[0,"The Stones of Venice, Volume 3 (of 3) (#12)"],[1,"in order, and within reach when they  need it; that it has not cost too much time in the getting; that none of  it, once got, has been lost; and that there is not too much to be easily  taken care of.    Sec. XXV. Consider these requirements a little, and the evils that result  in our education and polity from neglecting them. Knowledge is mental  food, and is exactly to the spirit what food is to the body (except that  the spirit needs several sorts of food, of which knowledge is only one),  and it is liable to the same kind of misuses. It may be mixed and  disguised by art, till it becomes unwholesome; it may be refined,  sweetened, and made palatable, until it has lost all its power of  nourishment; and, even of its best kind, it may be eaten to surfeiting,  and minister to disease and death.    Sec. XXVI. Therefore, with respect to knowledge, we are to reason and act  exactly as with respect to food. We no more live to know, than we live  to eat. We live to contemplate, enjoy, act, adore; and we may know all  that is to be known in this world, and what Satan knows in the other,  without being able to do any of these. We are to ask, therefore, first,  is the knowledge we would have fit food for us, good and simple, not  artificial and decorated? and secondly, how much of it will enable us  best for our work; and will leave our hearts light, and our eyes clear?  For no more than that is to be eaten without the old Eve-sin.    Sec. XXVII. Observe, also, the difference between tasting knowledge,  and hoarding it. In this respect it is also like food; since, in some  measure, the knowledge of all men is laid up in granaries, for future  use; much of it is at any given moment dormant, not fed upon or enjoyed,  but in store. And by all it is to be remembered, that knowledge in this  form may be kept without air till it rots, or in such unthreshed  disorder that it is of no use; and that, however good or orderly, it is  still only in being tasted that it becomes of use; and that men may  easily starve in their own granaries, men of science, perhaps, most of  all, for they are likely to seek accumulation of their store, rather  than nourishment from it. Yet let it not be thought that I would  undervalue them. The good and great among them are like Joseph, to whom  all nations sought to buy corn; or like the sower going forth to sow  beside all waters, sending forth thither the feet of the ox and the ass:  only let us remember that this is not all men's work. We are not  intended to be all keepers of granaries, nor all to be measured by the  filling of a storehouse; but many, nay, most of us, are to receive day  by day our daily bread, and shall be as well nourished and as fit for  our labor, and often, also, fit for nobler and more divine labor, in  feeding from the barrel of meal that does not waste, and from the cruse  of oil that does not fail, than if our barns were filled with plenty,  and our presses bursting out with new wine.    Sec. XXVIII. It is for each man to find his own measure in this matter;  in great part, also, for others to find it for him, while he is yet a  youth. And the desperate evil of the whole Renaissance system is, that  all idea of measure is therein forgotten, that knowledge is thought the  one and the only good, and it is never inquired whether men are vivified  by it or paralyzed. Let us leave figures. The reader may not believe the  analogy I have been pressing so far; but let him consider the subject in  itself, let him examine the effect of knowledge in his own heart, and  see whether the trees of knowledge and of life are one now, any more  than in Paradise. He must feel that the real animating power of  knowledge is only in the moment of its being first received, when it  fills us with wonder and joy; a joy for which, observe, the previous  ignorance is just as necessary as the present knowledge. That man is  always happy who is in the presence of something which he cannot know to  the full, which he is always going on to know. This is the necessary  condition of a finite creature with divinely rooted and divinely  directed intelligence; this, therefore, its happy state,--but observe, a  state, not of triumph or joy in what it knows, but of joy rather in the  continual discovery of new ignorance, continual self-abasement,  continual astonishment. Once thoroughly our own, the knowledge ceases to  give us pleasure. It may be practically useful to us, it may be good for  others, or good for usury to obtain more; but, in itself, once let it be  thoroughly familiar, and it is dead. The wonder is gone from it, and all  the fine color which it had when first we drew it up out of the infinite  sea. And what does it matter how much or how little of it we have laid  aside, when our only enjoyment is still in the casting of that deep sea  line? What does it matter? Nay, in one respect, it matters much, and not  to our advantage. For one effect of knowledge is to deaden the force of  the imagination and the original energy of the whole man: under the  weight of his knowledge he cannot move so lightly as in the days of his  simplicity. The pack-horse is furnished for the journey, the war-horse  is armed for war; but the freedom of the field and the lightness of the  limb are lost for both. Knowledge is, at best, the pilgrim's burden or  the soldier's panoply, often a weariness to them both: and the  Renaissance knowledge is like the Renaissance armor of plate, binding  and cramping the human form; while all good knowledge is like the  crusader's chain mail, which throws itself into folds with the body, yet  it is rarely so forged as that the clasps and rivets do not gall us. All  men feel this, though they do not think of it, nor reason out its  consequences. They look back to the days of childhood as of greatest  happiness, because those were the days of greatest wonder, greatest  simplicity, and most vigorous imagination. And the whole difference  between a man of genius and other men, it has been said a thousand  times, and most truly, is that the first remains in great part a child,  seeing with the large eyes of children, in perpetual wonder, not  conscious of much knowledge,--conscious, rather, of infinite ignorance,  and yet infinite power; a fountain of eternal admiration, delight, and  creative force within him meeting the ocean of visible and governable  things around him.    That is what we have to make men, so far as we may. All are to be men of  genius in their degree,--rivulets or rivers, it does not matter, so that  the souls be clear and pure; not dead walls encompassing dead heaps of  things known and numbered, but running waters in the sweet wilderness of  things unnumbered and unknown, conscious only of the living banks, on  which they partly refresh and partly reflect the flowers, and so pass  on.    Sec. XXIX. Let each man answer for himself how far his knowledge has made  him this, or how far it is loaded upon him as the pyramid is upon the  tomb. Let him consider, also, how much of it has cost him labor and time  that might have been spent in healthy, happy action, beneficial to all  mankind; how many living souls may have been left uncomforted and  unhelped by him, while his own eyes were failing by the midnight lamp;  how many warm sympathies have died within him as he measured lines or  counted letters; how many draughts of ocean air, and steps on  mountain-turf, and openings of the highest heaven he has lost for his  knowledge; how much of that knowledge, so dearly bought, is now  forgotten or despised, leaving only the capacity of wonder less within  him, and, as it happens in a thousand instances, perhaps even also the  capacity of devotion. And let him,--if, after thus dealing with his own  heart, he can say that his knowledge has indeed been fruitful to  him,--yet consider how many there are who have been forced by the  inevitable laws of modern education into toil utterly repugnant to their  natures, and that in the extreme, until the whole strength of the young  soul was sapped away; and then pronounce with fearfulness how far, and  in how many senses, it may indeed be true that the wisdom of this world  is foolishness with God.    Sec. XXX. Now all this possibility of evil, observe, attaches to knowledge  pursued for the noblest ends, if it be pursued imprudently. I have  assumed, in speaking of its effect both on men generally and on the  artist especially, that it was sought in the true love of it, and with  all honesty and directness of purpose. But this is granting far too much  in its favor. Of knowledge in general, and without qualification, it is  said by the Apostle that \"it puffeth up;\" and the father of all modern  science, writing directly in its praise, yet asserts this danger even in  more absolute terms, calling it a \"venomousness\" in the very nature of  knowledge itself.    Sec. XXXI. There is, indeed, much difference in this respect between the  tendencies of different branches of knowledge; it being a sure rule that  exactly in proportion as they are inferior, nugatory, or limited in  scope, their power of feeding pride is greater. Thus philology, logic,  rhetoric, and the other sciences of the schools, being for the most part  ridiculous and trifling, have so pestilent an effect upon those who are  devoted to them, that their students cannot conceive of any higher  sciences than these, but fancy that all education ends in the knowledge  of words: but the true and great sciences, more especially natural  history, make men gentle and modest in proportion to the largeness of  their apprehension, and just perception of the infiniteness of the  things they can never know. And this, it seems to me, is the principal  lesson we are intended to be caught by the book of Job; for there God  has thrown open to us the heart of a man most just and holy, and  apparently perfect in all things possible to human nature except  humility. For this he is "]]]
