But on Uct Dealv there came a rage of jealousy and despair such as no  person in the Shi' had ever heard of, and from that moment she  became capable of every ill deed; for there are two things not easily  controlled, and they are hunger and jealousy. She determined that the  woman who had supplanted her in Iollan's affections should rue the day  she did it. She pondered and brooded revenge in her heart, sitting in  thoughtful solitude and bitter collectedness until at last she had a  plan.    She understood the arts of magic and shape-changing, so she changed  her shape into that of Fionn's female runner, the best-known woman in  Ireland; then she set out from Faery and appeared in the world. She  travelled in the direction of Iollan's stronghold.    Iollan knew the appearance of Fionn's messenger, but he was surprised to  see her.    She saluted him.    \"Health and long life, my master.\".    \"Health and good days,\" he replied. \"What brings you here, dear heart?\"    \"I come from Fionn.\"    \"And your message?\" said he.    \"The royal captain intends to visit you.\"    \"He will be welcome,\" said Iollan. \"We shall give him an Ulster feast.\"    \"The world knows what that is,\" said the messenger courteously. \"And  now,\" she continued, \"I have messages for your queen.\"    Tuiren then walked from the house with the messenger, but when they had  gone a short distance Uct Dealv drew a hazel rod from beneath her cloak  and struck it on the queen's shoulder, and on the instant Tuiren's  figure trembled and quivered, and it began to whirl inwards and  downwards, and she changed into the appearance of a hound.    It was sad to see the beautiful, slender dog standing shivering and  astonished, and sad to see the lovely eyes that looked out pitifully  in terror and amazement. But Uct Dealv did not feel sad. She clasped  a chain about the hound's neck, and they set off westward towards the  house of Fergus Fionnliath, who was reputed to be the unfriendliest man  in the world to a dog. It was because of his reputation that Uct Dealv  was bringing the hound to him. She did not want a good home for this  dog: she wanted the worst home that could be found in the world, and she  thought that Fergus would revenge for her the rage and jealousy which  she felt towards Tuiren.        CHAPTER III    As they paced along Uct Dealv railed bitterly against the hound, and  shook and jerked her chain. Many a sharp cry the hound gave in that  journey, many a mild lament.    \"Ah, supplanter! Ah, taker of another girl's sweetheart!\" said Uct Dealv  fiercely. \"How would your lover take it if he could see you now? How  would he look if he saw your pointy ears, your long thin snout, your  shivering, skinny legs, and your long grey tail. He would not love you  now, bad girl!\"    \"Have you heard of Fergus Fionnliath,\" she said again, \"the man who does  not like dogs?\"    Tuiren had indeed heard of him.    \"It is to Fergus I shall bring you,\" cried Uct Dealv. \"He will throw  stones at you. You have never had a stone thrown at you. Ah, bad girl!  You do not know how a stone sounds as it nips the ear with a whirling  buzz, nor how jagged and heavy it feels as it thumps against a skinny  leg. Robber! Mortal! Bad girl! You have never been whipped, but you will  be whipped now. You shall hear the song of a lash as it curls forward  and bites inward and drags backward. You shall dig up old bones  stealthily at night, and chew them against famine. You shall whine and  squeal at the moon, and shiver in the cold, and you will never take  another girl's sweetheart again.\"    And it was in those terms and in that tone that she spoke to Tuiren  as they journeyed forward, so that the hound trembled and shrank, and  whined pitifully and in despair.    They came to Fergus Fionnliath's stronghold, and Uct Dealv demanded  admittance.    \"Leave that dog outside,\" said the servant.    \"I will not do so,\" said the pretended messenger.    \"You can come in without the dog, or you can stay out with the dog,\"  said the surly guardian.    \"By my hand,\" cried Uct Dealv, \"I will come in with this dog, or your  master shall answer for it to Fionn.\"    At the name of Fionn the servant almost fell out of his standing. He  flew to acquaint his master, and Fergus himself came to the great door  of the stronghold.    \"By my faith,\" he cried in amazement, \"it is a dog.\"    \"A dog it is,\" growled the glum servant.    \"Go you away,\" said Fergus to Uct Dealv, \"and when you have killed the  dog come back to me and I will give you a present.\"    \"Life and health, my good master, from Fionn, the son of Uail, the son  of Baiscne,\" said she to Fergus.    \"Life and health back to Fionn,\" he replied. \"Come into the house and  give your message, but leave the dog outside, for I don't like dogs.\"    \"The dog comes in,\" the messenger replied.    \"How is that?\" cried Fergus angrily.    \"Fionn sends you this hound to take care of until he comes for her,\"  said the messenger.    \"I wonder at that,\" Fergus growled, \"for Fionn knows well that there is  not a man in the world has less of a liking for dogs than I have.\"    \"However that may be, master, I have given Fionn's message, and here at  my heel is the dog. Do you take her or refuse her?\"    \"If I could refuse anything to Fionn it would be a dog,\" said Fergus,  \"but I could not refuse anything to Fionn, so give me the hound.\"    Uct Dealv put the chain in his hand.    \"Ah, bad dog!\" said she.    And then she went away well satisfied with her revenge, and returned to  her own people in the Shi.        CHAPTER IV    On the following day Fergus called his servant.    \"Has that dog stopped shivering yet?\" he asked.    \"It has not, sir,\" said the servant.    \"Bring the beast here,\" said his master, \"for whoever else is  dissatisfied Fionn must be satisfied.\"    The dog was brought, and he examined it with a jaundiced and bitter eye.    \"It has the shivers indeed,\" he said.    \"The shivers it has,\" said the servant.    \"How do you cure the shivers?\" his master demanded, for he thought that  if the animal's legs dropped off Fionn would not be satisfied.    \"There is a way,\" said the servant doubtfully.    \"If there is a way, tell it to me,\" cried his master angrily.    \"If you were to take the beast up in your arms and hug it and kiss it,  the shivers would stop,\" said the man.    \"Do you mean--?\" his master thundered, and he stretched his hand for a  club.    \"I heard that,\" said the servant humbly.    \"Take that dog up,\" Fergus commanded, \"and hug it and kiss it, and if I  find a single shiver left in the beast I'll break your head.\"    The man bent to the hound, but it snapped a piece out of his hand, and  nearly bit his nose off as well.    \"That dog doesn't like me,\" said the man.    \"Nor do I,\" roared Fergus; \"get out of my sight.\"    The man went away and Fergus was left alone with the hound, but the poor  creature was so terrified that it began to tremble ten times worse than  before.    \"Its legs will drop off,\" said Fergus. \"Fionn will blame me,\" he cried  in despair.    He walked to the hound.    \"If you snap at my nose, or if you put as much as the start of a tooth  into the beginning of a finger!\" he growled.    He picked up the dog, but it did not snap, it only trembled. He held it  gingerly for a few moments.    \"If it has to be hugged,\" he said, \"I'll hug it. I'd do more than that  for Fionn.\"    He tucked and tightened the animal into his breast, and marched moodily  up and down the room. The dog's nose lay along his breast under his  chin, and as he gave it dutiful hugs, one hug to every five paces, the  dog put out its tongue and licked him timidly under the chin.    \"Stop,\" roared Fergus, \"stop that forever,\" and he grew very red in  the face, and stared truculently down along his nose. A soft brown eye  looked up at him and the shy tongue touched again on his chin.    \"If it has to be kissed,\" said Fergus gloomily, \"I'll kiss it; I'd do  more than that for Fionn,\" he groaned.    He bent his head, shut his eyes, and brought the dog's jaw against his  lips. And at that the dog gave little wriggles in his arms, and little  barks, and little licks, so that he could scarcely hold her. He put the  hound down at last.    \"There is not a single shiver left in her,\" he said.    And that was true.    Everywhere he walked the dog followed him, giving little prances and  little pats against him, and keeping her eyes fixed on his with such  eagerness and intelligence that he marvelled.    \"That dog likes me,\" he murmured in amazement.    \"By my hand,\" he cried next day, \"I like that dog.\"    The day after that he was calling her \"My One Treasure, My Little  Branch.\" And within a week he could not bear her to be out of his sight  for an instant.    He was tormented by the idea that some evil person might throw a stone  at the hound, so he assembled his servants and retainers and addressed  them.    He told them that the hound was the Queen of Creatures, the Pulse of his  Heart, and the Apple of his Eye, and he warned them that the person who  as much as looked sideways on her, or knocked one shiver out of her,  would answer for the deed with pains and indignities. He recited a list  of calamities which would befall such a miscreant, and these woes began  with flaying and ended with dismemberment, and had inside bits of such  complicated and ingenious torment that the blood of the men who heard it  ran chill in their veins, and the women of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28957"],[0,"The Acts of the General Assemblies of the Church of Scotland (#12)"],[1,"his, as the rest of the Popish corruptions are called his:  To wit, _Invocation of Saints_, _canonisation of Saints_, _dedication of  Altars_, &c. are called his, not that there is another lawfull  canonization, invocation, or dedication of altars: whatsoever corruption  was in the Kirk, either in doctrine, worship, or government since the  ministry of iniquitie began to work, and is retained, and maintained, by  the _Pope_, and obtruded upon the Kirk by his authority, are his. A  passage also out of the history of the councell of _Trent_ was alledged,  where it is related, that the Councell would not define the _Hierarchie_  by the _seven orders_: we have in our confession of Faith the _manifold  orders_ set apart and distinguished from the _Hierarchie_, but as it is  set down in the cannon above cited: We have in the book of Policie or  second booke of Discipline, in the end of the second chapter, this  conclusion agreed upon. _Therefore all the ambitious titles invented in  the kingdome of Antichrist, and in his usurped HIERARCHIE which are not of  one of these four sorts, To wit, Pastours, Doctours, Elders, and Deacons,  together with offices depending thereupon, in one word ought to be  rejected._    All which and many other warrands being publickly read, and particularly  at great length examined, and all objections answered in face of the  Assembly, all the members of the Assembly being many times desired and  required to propone their doubts, and scruples, and every one being heard  to the full, and after much agitation as fully satisfied; the Moderatour  at last exhorting every one to declare his minde, did put the matter to  voicing in these termes: _Whether according to the confession of faith, as  it was professed in the year_ 1580. 1581. and 1590. _There be any other  Bishop, but a Pastour of a particular flock, having no preheminence nor  power over his brethren, and whether by that Confession, as it was then  professed, all other episcopacie is abjured, and ought to bee removed out  of this Kirk._ The whole Assembly most unanimously, without contradiction  of any one (and with the hesitation of one allanerly) professing full  perswasion of minde, did voice, _that all Episcopacie different from that  of a Pastour over, a particular flock, was abjured in this Kirk, and to be  removed out of it_. And therefore Prohibites underr ecclesiasticall  censure any to usurpe accept, defend, or obey the pretended authoritie  thereof in time coming.          Act. Sess. 17. December 10. 1638.        _The Assembly at_ Glasgow, _declaring the five Articles of_ Perth _to have  been abjured and to bee removed._      The Assembly remembring the uniformity of worship which was in this Kirk,  before the articles of _Perth_, the great rent which entered at that time,  and hath continued since, with the lamentable effects, that it hath  produced both against Pastours, and professours, the unlawfulnesse and  nullitie of _Perth_ Assembly already declared by this Assembly, and that  in the necessarie renewing of the confession of Faith in _February_ 1638.  the practice of novations introduced in the worship of God, was suspended,  till they should be determined in a free generall Assembly: and that in  the same year at his Majesties command some had subscribed the confession  of Faith, as it was professed when it was first subscribed: For these  causes the Assembly entered into a diligent tryall of the foresaid  articles, whether they be constant to the confession of Faith, as it was  meaned and professed in the year 1580. 1581. 1590. and 1591. And findeth  that first in generall: In the confession of Faith we professe, _We  willingly agree in our consciences to the forme of Religion, of a long  time openly professed by the Kings Majestie, and Whole body of this Realme  in all points, as unto Gods undoubted truth and verity, grounded only upon  his written word, and therefore abhor and deteste all contrary Religion  and Doctrine, but chiefly, all kinde of papistrie in generall and  partrcular heads, even as they were then damned and confuted by the Word  of God and Kirk of_ Scotland, _and in speciall the Romane Antichrist his  five bastard sacraments, with all rites, ceremonies and false doctrine,  added to the ministration of the true Sacraments, without the word of God,  his cruell judgement against Infants departing without the Sacrament, his  absolute necessitie of baptisme, and finally, we deteste all his vain  allegories, rites, signes, and traditions brought into the Kirk without,  or against the word of God, and doctrine of this true reformed Kirk, to  the which we joyne our selves willingly in Doctrine, Faith, Religion,  Discipline, and use of the holy Sacraments, as lively members of the same  in Christ our Head; promising and swearing, &c._ And that these five  articles are contrarie to the Religion then professed, were confuted by  the word of God, and Kirk of _Scotland_, or are rites, and ceremonies,  added to the ministration, of the true Sacraments, without the word God,  or nourish the popish judgement against Infants departing without the  Sacrament, or absolute necessitie, of Baptisme or rites, signes, and  traditions brought in to the Kirk, with out or against the word of God,  and doctrine of this true reformed Kirk.    And next in particular, concerning festivall dayes, findeth, that in the  explication of the first head, of the first book of Discipline, it was  thought good that the feasts of _Christmas_, _Circumcision_, _Epiphanie_,  with the feasts of the Apostles, Martyres, and Virgine _Mary_, bee utterly  abolished, because they are neither commanded nor warranded by Scripture,  and that such as observe them be punished by civill Magistrats. Here utter  abolition is craved, and not reformation of abuses only, and that because  the observation of such feasts hath no warrand from the word of God. In  the generall Assembly holden at _Edinburgh_ _Anno_ 1556. the large  confession of _Helvetia_ was approved, but with speciall exception against  the same five dayes, which are now urged upon us. It was not then the  Popish observation only, with the Popish opinion of worship and merit,  which was disallowed; (for so the reformed Kirk in _Helvetia_ did not  observe them) but _simpliciter_ all observation. For this end was read a  letter in Latine, sent at that time by some of our divines to certaine  divines in these parts to this purpose. In the Assembly holden 1575. in  _August_, complaint was made against the Ministers and Readers beside  _Aberdene_; because they assembled the people to preaching and prayers  upon certane festival dayes: So that preaching and prayers upon festival  dayes was judged rebukable. It was ordained likewise, that complaint be  made to the Regent, upon the town of _Drumfreis_, for urging and convoying  a Reader to the Kirk with Tabret and Whistle, to read Prayers, all the  holy dayes of _Christmas_, upon the refusal of their own Reader. Among the  articles directed by this Assembly to the Regent: It was craved that all  holy dayes hereto-fore keeped holy, beside the Lords day, such a  _Yooleday_, and Saints dayes, and such others may bee abolished, and a  certain penaltie appointed for banqueting, playing, feasting upon these  dayes. In the Assembly holden in _April_, _Anno_ 1577. It was ordained  that the visitors with the advice of the Synodal Assembly, should admonish  Ministers, preaching or ministrating the Communion at _Easter_, or  _Christmas_, or other like superstitious times, or Readers reading, to  desist, under the paine of deprivation. In the ninth head of the first  book of Discipline, the reason is set down against _Easter_ Communion.  _Your honours are not ignorant how superstitiously the people run to that  action at Pascheven; as if the time gave vertue to the Sacrament, and how  the rest of the whole year, they are carelesse and negligent, as if it  appartained not to them, but at that time only. And for this reason, other  times were appointed by that book, for that holy action._ In the Assembly  holden 1596. begun in _March_ 1595. at which time the _Covenant_ was  renewed, superstition and idolatrie breaking forth in observing festival  dayes; setting out of bone-fires, singing Carols, are reakoned amongst the  corruptions which were to be amended: And the Pulpits did sound from time  to time, against all shew of observing any festival day whatsoever, except  the Lords day.    Concerning kneeling at the Communion, findeth that in the confession of  Faith prefixed before the Psalmes, and approved by our Kirk in the very  beginning of the reformation, we have these words, _Neither in the  ministration of the Sacraments, must we follow men: but as Christ himself  hath ordained, so must they be ministred._ In the large confession of  Faith chap. 23. It is required as necessary, for the right ministration of  the Sacraments, that they bee ministred in such elements, and in such  sort, as God hath appointed, and that men have adulterate the Sacraments  with their own inventions: So that no part of Christs action abideth in  the originall puritie. The judgement of our reformers, who drew up the  large Confession, was by cleare evidents shewed to be contrary to this  gesture in the act of receiving the Sacrament. In the order of celebrating  the Lords Supper, prefixed before the Psalmes in meeter, _sitting and  distributing by the Communicants_, are joined: as likewise by the second  head of the first book of Discipline, as nearest to Christs own action,  and to his perfect practise, and most convenient to that holy action, and  all inventions devised by man are condemned, as alterations and  accusations of Christs perfect ordinance: Ministers were enjoyned by act  of Assembly in _December 1562._ To observe the order of _Geneva_: that is  the English Kirk at _Geneva_: where Master _Knox_ had been sometime  Minister, in the ministration of the Sacraments."]]]
