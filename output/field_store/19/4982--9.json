[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36830"],[0,"The Badger: A Monograph (#12)"],[1," crippled with rheumatism, showing toothless gums when he smiles his  welcome, he has twice this summer found alone the badger earths, and  returned at evening, each time with his score of marks increased, and on  the last occasion he left one of his ears behind him![4] A terrier that  will go off to a badger earth on his own account, especially if a young  one, will probably end his days and find his grave there. I have known  several do so. Poor old Twig! Always happy, he seldom now wanders  further than the stable-yard, and spends his declining days playing with  the foxhound pup or sleeping in the sun, when in his dreams he fights  his battles over again, and thrice he slays the slain. When we were  young together he followed me every hunting morning to the meet, where  he at once incorporated himself with the pack, greeting his friends in  turn with a grin, a twist of his body, and a wag of his stump; and when  the daylight faded, and the horn sounded for home, I had always to carry  him off on my saddle, so reluctant was he, after the longest day, to  leave his comrades of the chase. This became so troublesome that at last  I yielded to the pressure of the huntsman, Will Nicholl, who then hunted  the Cleveland hounds, to permit him to join the kennel establishment.  For three seasons he scarcely missed a day, and when a fox was run to  ground, no matter after how long or fast a run, the question, \"Where is  Twig?\" was never asked twice. Always there when wanted, always  dependable and perfect at his work, he shifted many a sulky fox that  went to ground. Then Will Nicholl went to the Hurworth under Sir  Reginald Graham, and took Twig with him. He did two seasons in the  Hurworth country, from thence going to the Burton with Nicholl again.  After a season there I had a letter saying that Nicholl feared that the  old dog would not follow hounds another season, and he sent him back  with me. I summered him well; he did the next season with the Cleveland,  and came out the following season when hounds were handy or when  occasion required, making eight seasons with foxhounds, besides being  hunted at badger in the summer months. He had learnt not to be hard on a  fox, but I thought I detected him in an act of violence something more  than a year ago. We had run to ground in a drain, and Twig, who had  heard hounds, had come across country as fast as his old legs would  carry him, and was in before I could say \"Knife.\" No sooner was he in  than the fox was out, with Twig at his brush. This was not at all what  we wanted, as the whole pack was within fifteen yards. Twig collared the  fox as he bolted, and as the hounds were making a dash at him. I was  angry with Twig, lifted the fox and Twig, who I thought was holding the  fox, above my head to save reynard from the hounds. Here I had to hold  him for five minutes, but when I tried to choke the old dog off, I  discovered that the fox was holding Twig through the upper jaw, and the  dog was hanging with his whole weight suspended on the fox's teeth.  Having made the fox leave go Twig fell to the ground, and when all was  clear I put the fox down, when we had a sharp ten minutes to ground  again. I was there only just in time to prevent Twig from going in to  take his revenge--the fox this time being left in peace. It is as well  to have with you one bull-terrier, or a fox-terrier with a bit of bull  about him. In cases of emergency, and when close up, such a dog comes in  useful, but they are tiresome brutes as a rule to do with; they get so  excited that they do not care what they go at, it may be the dogs or  yourself, or I have seen them set to worry a big stone. They often go to  ground well, but have several faults. They _will_ tackle the badger, get  punished severely, and create all sorts of difficulties, and are  generally nearly mute except when fighting.        [4] Dead since this was written.    I had a rare life of it on one expedition with a little bull-terrier  called Nip that I bought from a Cornishman, after a long dig in which  Nip had distinguished himself. He was a dirty white, ugly, undershot,  crop-eared little brute, with a tail like a shaving-brush. Shy and  nervous, he had a fiendish amount of pugnacity and pluck. When not  otherwise employed, he wore his teeth to the gums in vain endeavours to  get into the interior of large stones. In a railway-carriage, so  delighted was he at all times to get to ground, that he would get under  the seat, and refuse to be removed if he had not on a collar and chain,  except with the badger-tongs. He had to be muzzled and chained when with  other dogs, and even then would make an utter fool of himself in his  attempts to fight on every occasion. He would, when he had lost a  badger, sulk and refuse to come out, and as it was impossible to put in  any other dog while he was there, he had to be dug to and drawn like a  brock. Whilst at the end of a day, when every other animal had had more  than enough, and was glad to get food and rest, he was ready to hold me  by the leg, and it would take the tongs and a couple of men to get his  collar on.    I have always had a great admiration for the short-coated, hard, Scotch  terrier, and believe that they are admirably adapted for this chase, but  I have had no experience of them. They seem cut out for it, being hardy,  the right size, sharp-tongued, and amongst the most intelligent of the  canine race. I knew of one who went to Craig Cluny in the edge of the  Ballochbuie forest, and spent some hours in a vain attempt to dislodge a  badger. He returned three miles to the inn at Braemar and found another  terrier like himself; they trotted back together, and by their united  efforts drew and killed an old badger! There is a spot near this place  in the forest called Stra-na-brach--or the badger's crag--but the badger  knows the place no more. The keeper has done his work with the trap  throughout Aberdeenshire.    Dandie Dinmont no doubt bred his dogs from these terriers, but I have no  belief that the present race is fitted for badger-hunting. Those one  sees on a show bench are too large to get to ground quickly and easily,  and I doubt if there is one of the race, as at present known, that has  ever exchanged civilities with the badger in his natural earth. Dandie  Dinmont bred his terriers for badgers, but I am sure his never were the  size they are now; and although Sir Walter Scott has surrounded Dandie  with a halo of interest, and made him immortal by his eulogies, his  fiendish cruelties have always made me hate his name, and prejudiced me  against a breed that was developed under a hideous system. It makes my  blood boil to read of his terriers trained to face the badger by taking  alive young and old badgers, and sawing off the under jaws, and  employing other indescribably cruel methods.    The dachshund and the small basset, when properly selected, are  splendidly adapted for badger-hunting. In Germany the former, and in  France the latter, are generally bred for this purpose. Full-voiced and  throwing a tongue like a hound, deep-chested, short-legged, and  strong-bodied, they are perhaps the best one can have, but I do not  think that they possess the endurance and quickness of an English  terrier.    There was a breed of wire-haired black-and-tan English terriers, but I  imagine them to be nearly, if not altogether, extinct, that from all  accounts must have been really good terriers in the true meaning of the  term.    In working dogs, be careful only to put in one at a time: you thus  economize your forces, and avoid the risk of their fighting in the  earth. More than this, if you let two dogs or a dog and a bitch in  together, you subject them to danger and the probability of severe  punishment. The dog in front is charged by the badger, the dog behind  cares for nothing but that he may get to close quarters, and it is a  case of those behind cry forward and those in front cry back. In such a  position your terrier may have his legs and head broken, and be killed  outright. Again, a good terrier works better and more steadily than with  a companion, as the competition leads to jealousy. Put in your dog at  the lowest or bottom hole of the set, driving the badger up-hill (or \"to  hill,\" as it is technically called) if you can. It is a much easier task  to get a badger out in this manner, as the further up-hill the fewer are  the passages, and generally speaking the nearer they lie to the surface.  Furthermore, take care that you have a collar and chain for each dog,  and that every terrier not on duty is securely fastened at a distance  from the earth, and out of reach of any other dog.    The following are the requisite implements for badger digging; they  should be good and handy tools:--      [Illustration: FIG. 7.]    1. and 2. Spades. These should be handy, and worn to that condition  when the edge is sharp, and the tool works easily, without having lost  its strength. They should vary but little from the ordinary garden or  rabbiting spade, except that where there is a depth of clay, and when in  a deep trench, it may be easier or a relief to use a drainer's long  narrow one.    3. A crowbar.    4. A scraper, or coal-rake.    [Illustration: FIG. 8.]    5 and 6. Shovels, for clearing out the loose earth, including a  short-handled one, or scoop, for opening the holes to let in air to the  dogs.    [Illustration: FIG. 9.]    7. An earth-piercer, in order to locate the fight.    8. Tongs. The handles should be of wood, as steel and iron \"give\" under  the pressure of a man's strength at one end and the badger at the other.  With wooden handles and steel fittings there will still be spring enough  to work the guard, which is put on to secure the hold on the animal.    9. Adze, or hatchet, for cutting roots of trees.    10 and 11. Picks, single or double.    Do not forget when starting on a badger-hunt to take plenty of  refreshment with you, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36844"],[0,"In New England Fields and Woods (#12)"],[1,"down from the aerial path, where he wends his  southward way, high and distinct above the shrill monotony of crickets  and August pipers. The listening sportsman may well imagine that the  departing bird is laughing at him as much as signaling his course to  companion wayfarers.    The woodland thrushes' flutes and bells have ceased to breathe and  chime, only the wood pewee keeps his pensive song of other days, yet  best befitting those of declining summer.    The trees are dark with ripened leafage; out of the twilight of the  woodside glow the declining disks of wild sunflowers and shine the  rising constellations of asters. The meadow sides are gay with unshorn  fringes of goldenrod and willow-herb, and there in the corners of the  gray fences droop the heavy clusters of elderberries, with whose purple  juice the flocking robins and the young grouse, stealing from the  shadowed copses along this belt of shade, dye their bills.    The brook trails its attenuated thread out of the woodland gloom to gild  its shallow ripples with sunshine and redden them with the inverted  flames of the cardinals that blaze on the sedgy brink. Here the brown  mink prowls with her lithe cubs, all unworthy yet of the trapper's  skill, but tending toward it with growth accelerated by full feasts of  pool-impounded minnows. Here, too, the raccoon sets the print of his  footsteps on the muddy shores as he stays his stomach with frogs and  sharpens his appetite with the hot sauce of Indian turnip while he  awaits the setting of his feast in the cornfields. The hounds are more  impatient than he for the opening of his midnight revel, and tug at  their chains and whimper and bay when they hear his querulous call  trembling through the twilight. They are even fooled to melodiously  mournful protest when their ears catch the shriller quaver of the  screech owl's note.    The woodcock skulks in the bordering alders, and when forced to flight  does so with a stronger wing than when a month ago his taking off was  first legally authorized. Another month will make him worthier game; and  then, too, the ruffed grouse need not be spared a shot, as full grown  and strong of pinion he bursts from cover; nor need the wood duck, now  but a vigorous bunch of pin feathers, be let go untried or unscathed,  when from his perch on a slanted log or out of a bower of rushes he  breaks into the upper air with startling flutter of wings and startled  squeak of alarm.    Summer wanes, flowers fade, bird songs falter to mournful notes of  farewell; but while regretfully we mark the decline of these golden  days, we remember with a thrill of expectation that they slope to the  golden days of autumn, wherein the farmer garners his latest harvest,  the sportsman his first worthy harvest, and that to him that waits, come  all things, and even though he waits long, may come the best.          XXVI    A VOYAGE IN THE DARK      A few days ago, a friend who is kind and patient enough to encumber  himself with the care of a blind man and a boy took me and my  twelve-year-old a-fishing. It was with a fresh realization of my  deprivation that I passed along the watery way once as familiar as the  dooryard path, but now shrouded for me in a gloom more impenetrable than  the blackness of the darkest night. I could only guess at the bends and  reaches as the south wind blew on one cheek or the other, or on my back,  only knowing where the channel draws near the shore upon which the  Indians encamped in the old days by the flutter of leaves overbearing  the rustle of rushes. By the chuckle of ripples under the bow, I guessed  when we were in mid-channel; by the entangled splash of an oar, when we  approached the reedy border where the water-lilies rode at anchor, and  discharged their subtle freight of perfume as they tossed in our wake. I  knew by his clatter, drawing nearer only with our progress, that a  kingfisher was perched on a channel-side fishing-stake, used in turn by  him and bigger but not more skillful fishers. I heard his headlong  plunge, but whether successful or not the ensuing clatter did not tell  me, for he has but one voice for all expressions. Yet as his rattling  cry was kept up till the rough edge of its harshness was worn away in  receding flight, I fancied he was proclaiming an unusually successful  achievement. For the sake of his reputation, he would never make such a  fuss over a failure, unless he was telling, as we do, of the big fish he  just missed catching. At any rate, I wished him good luck, for who would  begrudge a poor kingfisher such little fish as he must catch! They would  need years of growth to make them worth our catching or bragging over  the loss of, and by that time we may be done with fishing.    Suddenly there was a roar of multitudinous wings as a host of redwings  upburst from springing and swaying wild rice stalks, all of which I saw  through the blackness illumined for an instant by memory,--the dusky  cloud uprising like the smoke of an explosion, the bent rice springing  up beneath its lifted burden, the dull-witted or greedy laggards  dribbling upward to join the majority. My companions exclaimed in one  voice at the rare sight of a white bird in the flock, and by the same  light of memory I also saw it as I saw one in an autumn forty years ago,  when, with my comrade of those days, I came \"daown the crik\"  duck-shooting, or trolling as to-day. Again and again we saw this  phenomenal bird like a white star twinkling through a murky cloud. The  fitful gleam was seen day after day, till the north wind blew him and  his cloud away southward.    The pother of the blackbirds overhead disturbed the meditations of a  bittern, who, with an alarmed croak, jerked his ungainly form aloft in a  flurry of awkward wing-beats, and went sagging across the marshes in  search of safer seclusion. I wished that he might find it, and escape  the ruthless gunners that will presently come to desolate these  marshes. Very different from his uprising was that of a pair of wood  ducks, revealing their unsuspected presence with startling suddenness,  as they sprang from water to air with a splash and whistle of rapid  wings and their squeaking alarm cry, and then flew swiftly away, the  sibilant wing-beats pulsing out in the distance. These, too, I wished  might safely run the gauntlet of all the guns that will be arrayed  against them when the summer truce is broken. If I had not been mustered  out, or if my boy were mustered in, no doubt I should feel differently  toward the inhabitants of these marshes. Compulsory abstinence makes one  exceedingly virtuous, and because I am virtuous there shall be no cakes  and ale for any one.    The absence of the rail's cackle was noticeable, a clamor that used to  be provoked at this season by every sudden noise. We never got sight of  the \"ma'sh chickens\" as they skulked among the sedges; and when the  birds were pressed to flight, rarely caught more than a fleeting glimpse  as they topped the rushes for an instant, and dropped again into the  mazes of the marsh. But they were always announcing a numerous if  invisible presence where now not one answered to our voices or the noise  of our oars.    All this while our trolling gear was in tow: the boy's a \"phantom  minnow\" bristling with barbs, a veritable porcupine fish; mine a fluted  spoon. The larger fish seemed attracted by the better imitation, or  perhaps age and experience had given them discernment to shun the other  more glaring sham, and the best of them went to the boy's score; but the  unwise majority of smaller fish were evidently anxious to secure  souvenir spoons of Little Otter, and in consequence of that desire I was  \"high hook\" as to numbers. They were only pickerel at best, though some  of them, bearing their spots on a green ground, are honored with the  name of \"maskalonge\" by our fishermen. A scratch of the finger-nail  across the scaly gill-cover gives proof enough to convince even a blind  man of the worthlessness of this claim to distinction.    Once I enjoyed an exaltation of spirit only to suffer humiliation. There  was a tug at the hooks, so heavy that my first thought was of a snag,  and I was on the point of calling out to my friend to stop rowing. Then  there was a slight yielding, and the tremor that tells unmistakably of a  fish. \"Now,\" said I, with my heart but a little way back of my teeth, \"I  am fast to something like a fish, but I shall never be able to boat him.  He is too big to lift out with the hooks, and I can't see to get him by  the gills, and so I shall lose him.\" As he came in slowly, stubbornly  fighting against every shortening inch of line, I almost wished he had  not been hooked at all only to be lost at last. When, after a time, my  fish was hauled near the boat and in sight of my companions, my catch  proved to be no monster, but a pickerel of very ordinary size hooked by  the belly, and so my hopes and fears vanished together.    I think distances are magnified to the blind, for it seemed twice as far  as it did of old from the East Slang to the South Slang, as we passed  these oddly named tributaries of Little Otter.    At last I sniffed the fragrance of cedars and heard the wash of waves on  the southward-slanted shore of Garden Island, and these informed me we  were at the lake. In confirmation thereof was the testimony of my  companions, given out of their light to my darkness, of an eagle's royal  progress through his ethereal realm, making inspection of his disputed  earthly possession. I was glad to know that his majesty had escaped the  republican regicides who haunt the summer shores.    We made a difficult landing on the mainland, on the oozy shore of mixed  sawdust and mud, and followed the old trail to the old camping ground  under the rocks, a place full of pleasant memories for the elder two of  our trio, and offering to the boy the charms of freshness and discovery.  For him the "]]]
