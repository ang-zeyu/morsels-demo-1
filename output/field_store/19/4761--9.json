Lord Stanley will not venture to answer for the quality of the  vintage; but as the wine has been sent over with a loyal and dutiful  feeling, and the importer, as well as the colonists in general, might  feel hurt by a refusal of his humble offering, he ventures to hope  that he may be permitted to signify, through the Governor, your  Majesty's gracious acceptance of the first sample of a manufacture  which, if successful, may add greatly to the resources of this young  but now thriving colony.    The above is humbly submitted by your Majesty's most dutiful Servant  and Subject,    STANLEY.          [Pageheading: THE KING OF HOLLAND]      _Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._    OSBORNE, _29th July 1845._    MY DEAREST UNCLE,--Accept my best thanks for your very kind little  note of the 26th. As Albert writes to you about the King of Holland's  visit[18] I will say but little, except that it really went off  wonderfully well in our little house. We took him a sail in the  _Victoria and Albert_ on Saturday, which he admired amazingly, and  after luncheon he went away, Albert taking him over to Gosport. He  intends, I believe, to come here one morning for luncheon to take  leave. He is grown old, and has lost all his front teeth, but he is as  talkative and lively as he used to be, and seems very happy to be in  England again. He was very anxious that we should pay him a visit this  year, but was quite satisfied when we told him that this year it was  impossible, but that we hoped some other time to do so. He was much  struck at seeing me now independent and unembarrassed, and talking;  as when he was here in 1836[19] I was extremely crushed and kept  under and hardly dared say a word, so that he was quite astonished.  He thought me grown. Believe me, always, dearest Uncle, your devoted  Niece,    VICTORIA R.        [Footnote 18: This visit lasted ten days, and included a visit      to Goodwood races and a review of the Household troops in Hyde      Park. His Majesty was also appointed a Field-Marshal.]        [Footnote 19: _Ante_, vol. i. p. 47. He was then Prince of      Orange, and succeeded his father, who abdicated in his favour      in 1840.]          _Queen Victoria to Viscount Melbourne._    OSBORNE, _31st July 1845._    The Queen thanks Lord Melbourne very much for his last kind letter of  the 11th, by which she was truly rejoiced to see he was better. We are  comfortably and peacefully established here since the 19th, and derive  the greatest benefit, pleasure, and satisfaction from our little  possession here. The dear Prince is constantly occupied in directing  the many necessary improvements which are to be made, and in watching  our new house, which is a constant interest and amusement. We are most  anxiously waiting for the conclusion of the Session that we may set  off on our much-wished-for journey to Germany. The Queen is extremely  sorry to leave England without seeing Lord Melbourne, and without  having seen him all this season; but something or other always  prevented us from seeing Lord Melbourne each time we hoped to do so.  We only return the night before the Prorogation and embark that same  day. We have the children here. We went to the Undercliff--Ventnor,  Bonchurch, etc.--on Monday, and were much delighted with all we saw.  We had a visit from the King of Holland last week, who is grown old,  but otherwise just the same as he used to be.    The Queen joins with Lord Melbourne in unfeigned satisfaction at the  success of the Irish measures, after so much factious opposition. Lord  Grey's death[20] will have shocked Lord Melbourne, as it has us. Poor  Lord Dunmore's death is a very shocking event. The Prince wishes to be  most kindly remembered to Lord Melbourne.

Sir Robert Peel thinks it very probable that a motion will be made  upon the subject in the course of the next Session--particularly in  the event of any occurrence during your Majesty's absence, which might  cause public inconvenience from the want of immediate access to the  Royal authority, or compel any assumption of power on the part of your  Majesty's servants of a questionable character.    The present Law Officers of the Crown were rather startled at the  intention of departing from the precedent of George IV.'s reign, on  seeing the legal opinions of their predecessors; they did not differ  from the _legal_ doctrines laid down by them, but were not very well  satisfied on the point of discretion and policy.    Sir Robert Peel feels it to be his duty to state to your Majesty  what has passed on this subject, and to apprize your Majesty of the  possibility of a question being hereafter raised in Parliament upon  it.    Sir Robert Peel thinks that in the case of a short absence, and  a distance not precluding easy and rapid communication with your  Majesty, the appointment of Lords Justices may be dispensed with; but  he is humbly of opinion that were the distance greater or the period  of absence longer than that contemplated by your Majesty, the reasons  for the nomination of Lords Justices would preponderate.    Should the subject be again mentioned in Parliament and a direct  question be put upon it, Sir Robert Peel will, of course, assume  the entire responsibility for the non-appointment of Lords Justices;  vindicating the departure from the precedent of George IV. on the  ground of the shorter period of absence and the more easy means of  communication.[21]...        [Footnote 21: The Queen was accompanied by a Secretary of      State (Lord Aberdeen), so that an act of State could be      performed as well abroad as at home; see _Life of the Prince      Consort_, vol. i. p. 272.]          [Pageheading: VISIT TO THE CHATEAU D'EU]    [Pageheading: THE SPANISH MARRIAGES]      _The Earl of Aberdeen to Sir Robert Peel._    CHATEAU D'EU, _8th September 1845._    MY DEAR PEEL,--We left Antwerp very early yesterday morning, and  anchored for a few hours off Flushing.[22] We passing down the Channel  during the night, and as the weather was perfectly bright and fine,  found ourselves off Treport before nine o'clock this morning. The King  came off to the yacht, and took the Queen in his barge to land. I need  not say how joyfully she was received by all the Royal Family.    Although I shall have opportunities, both this evening and to-morrow  morning, of speaking again with the King and Guizot, I have already  discussed several subjects with each of them; and as the Queen  particularly desires to send a messenger this evening, I will give you  some notion of what has passed between us.    I think the marriage of the Queen of Spain is the subject on which the  greatest interest is felt at this moment. It was the first introduced,  both by the King and Guizot, and treated by both in the same manner.  They said, that having promised to support the King of Naples, they  were bound not to abandon the Count de Trapani, so long as there was a  chance of his being successful in his suit. I said in answer to  their desire, that we would assist this arrangement, that we had no  objection to Count Trapani, and that we would take no part against  him; but unless it should be the decided wish of the Spanish  Government and people, we could give no support to the marriage, as we  were honestly of opinion that it was not desired in Spain, and that  we saw nothing in the proposal to call for our support under these  circumstances. Both the King and Guizot said they had no objection to  the Duke of Saville[23] (Don Enrique), and that if it should be found  that Count Trapani was impossible, they would willingly support him.    With respect to the Infanta, they both declared in the most positive  and explicit manner, that _until the Queen was married and had  children_, they should consider the Infanta precisely as her sister,  and that any marriage with a French Prince would be entirely out of  the question. The King said he did not wish that his son should have  the prospect of being on the throne of Spain; but that if the Queen  had children, by whom the succession would be secured, he did not  engage to preclude himself from the possibility of profiting by the  great inheritance which the Infanta would bring his son. All this,  however, was uncertain, and would require time at all events to  accomplish; for I distinctly understood, that it was not only a  marriage and a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24790"],[0,"Early English Meals and Manners (#12)"],[1,"contention, strife, and conflicte, and in maner of an    honest envie who shall do beste, not oonlie in the ffrenche tongue    (wherin Mr Vallence after a wonderesly compendious, facile,    prompte, and redy waye, nott withoute painfull delegence and    laborious industrie doth enstructe them) but also in writynge,    playenge at weapons, and all other theire exercises, so that if    continuance in this bihalf may take place, whereas the laste    Diana, this shall (I truste) be consecrated to Apollo and the    Muses, to theire no small profecte and your good contentation and    pleasure.

[Headnote: STUDIES OF YOUTHS, TEMP. HEN. VIII. AND ELIZABETH.]    Of the course of study of 'well-bred youths' in the early years of  Elizabeth's reign we have an interesting account by Sir Nicholas Bacon,  Lord Keeper, father of the great Bacon, in a Paper by Mr J. Payne  Collier in the _Archæologia_, vol. 36, Part 2, p. 339, Article xxxi.[33]  \"Before he became Lord Keeper, Sir Nicholas Bacon had been Attorney of  that Court\" [the Court of Wards and Liveries] \"a most lucrative  appointment; and on the 27th May, 1561, he addressed a letter to Sir  William Cecil, then recently (Jan., 1561) made Master of the Wards,  followed by a paper thus entitled:--'Articles devised for the bringing  up in vertue and learning of the Queenes Majesties Wardes, being heires  males, and whose landes, descending in possession and coming to the  Queenes Majestie, shall amount to the cleere yearly value of c. markes,  or above.'\" Sir Nicholas asks the new Master of Wards to reform what he  justly calls most \"preposterous\" abuses in the department:--\"That the  proceeding hath bin preposterous, appeareth by this: the chiefe thinge,  and most of price, in wardeship, is the wardes mynde; the next to that,  his bodie; the last and meanest, his land. Nowe, hitherto the chiefe  care of governaunce hath bin to the land, being the meaneste; and to the  bodie, being the better, very small; but to the mynde, being the best,  none at all, which methinkes is playnely to sett the carte before the  horse\" (p. 343). Mr Collier then summarises Bacon's Articles for the  bringing up of the Wards thus: \"The wards are to attend divine service  at six in the morning: nothing is said about breakfast,[34] but they are  to study Latin until eleven; to dine between 11 and 12; to study with  the music-master from 12 till 2; from 2 to 3 they are to be with the  French master; and from 3 to 5 with the Latin and Greek masters. At 5  they are to go to evening prayers; then they are to sup; to be allowed  honest pastimes till 8; and, last of all, before they go to bed at 9,  they are again to apply themselves to music under the instruction of the  master. At and after the age of 16 they were to attend lectures upon  temporal and civil law, as well as _de disciplinâ militari_. It is not  necessary to insert farther details; but what I have stated will serve  to show how well-bred youths of that period were usually brought up, and  how disgracefully the duty of education as regards wards was  neglected.... It may appear singular that in these articles drawn up by  Sir Nicholas, so much stress is laid upon instruction in music[35]; but  it only serves to confirm the notion that the science was then most  industriously cultivated by nearly every class of society.\" Pace in 1517  requires that every one should study it, but should join with it some  other study, as Astrology or Astronomy. He says also that the greatest  part of the art had perished by men's negligence; \"For all that our  musicians do now-a-days, is almost trivial if compared with what the old  ones (_antiqui_) did, so that now hardly one or two (_unus aut alter_)  can be found who know what harmony is, though the word is always on  their tongue.\" (_De Fructu_, p. 54-5.) Ascham, while lamenting in 1545  (_Toxophilus_, p. 29) 'that the laudable custom of England to teach  children their plain song and prick-song' is 'so decayed throughout all  the realm as it is,' denounces the great practise of instrumental music  by older students: \"the minstrelsy of lutes, pipes, harps, and all other  that standeth by such nice, fine, minikin fingering, (such as the most  part of scholars whom I know use, if they use any,) is far more fit, for  the womanishness of it, to dwell in the Court among ladies, than for any  great thing in it which should help good and sad study, to abide in the  University among scholars.\"        [Headnote: NEGLECT OF EDUCATION BY MOTHERS.]    By 1577 our rich people, according to Harrison, attended properly to the  education of their children. After speaking \"of our women, whose beautie  commonlie exceedeth the fairest of those of the maine,\" he says:      \"This neuerthelesse I vtterlie mislike in the poorer sort of them,    for the wealthier doo sildome offend herein: that being of    themselues without competent wit, they are so carelesse in the    education of their children (wherein their husbands also are to be    blamed,) by means whereof verie manie of them neither fearing God,    neither regarding either manners or obedience, do oftentimes come    to confusion, which (if anie correction or discipline had beene    vsed toward them in youth) might haue prooued good members of    their common-wealth & countrie, by their good seruice and    industrie.\" --_Descr. of Britaine_, Holinshed, i. 115, col. 2.    This is borne out by Ascham, who says that young men up to 17 were well  looked after, but after that age were turned loose to get into all the  mischief they liked:      \"In deede, from seven to seventene, yong jentlemen commonlie be    carefullie enough brought up: But from seventene to seven and    twentie (the most dangerous tyme of all a mans life, and most    slipperie to stay well in) they have commonlie the rein of all    licens in their owne hand, and speciallie soch as do live in the    Court. And that which is most to be merveled at, commonlie the    wisest and also best men be found the fondest fathers in this    behalfe. And if som good father wold seek some remedie herein, yet    the mother (if the household of our Lady) had rather, yea, and    will to, have her sonne cunnyng and bold, in making him to lyve    trimlie when he is yong, than by learning and travell to be able    to serve his Prince & his countrie, both wiselie in peace, and    stoutlie in warre, whan he is old.      \"The fault is in your selves, ye noble mens sonnes, and therfore    ye deserve the greater blame, that commonlie the meaner mens    children cum to be the wisest councellours, and greatest doers, in    the weightie affaires of this realme.\" --_Scholemaster_, ed. Mayor,    p. 39-40.    Note lastly, on this subject of private tuition, that Mulcaster in his  _Elementarie_, 1582, complains greatly of rich people aping the custom  of princes in having private tutors for their boys, and withdrawing them  from public schools where the spirit of emulation against other boys  would make them work. The course he recommends is, that rich people  should send their sons, with their tutors, to the public schools, and so  get the advantage of both kinds of tuition.    _Girls' Home Education._ The earliest notice of an English Governess  that any friend has found for me is in \"the 34th Letter of Osbert de  Clare in Stephen's reign, A.D. 1135-54. He mentions what seems to be a  Governess of his children, '_quædam matrona quæ liberos ejus_ (sc.  _militis, Herberti de Furcis_) _educare consueverat_.' She appears to be  treated as one of the family: e.g. they wait for her when she goes into  a chapel to pray. I think a nurse would have been 'ancilla quæ liberos  ejus nutriendos susceperat.'\" Walter de Biblesworth was the tutor of the  \"lady Dionysia de Monchensi, a Kentish heiress, the daughter of William  de Monchensi, baron of Swanescombe, and related, apparently,[[35a]] to  the Valences, earls of Pembroke, and wrote his French Grammar, or rather  Vocabulary[36], for her. She married Hugh de Vere, the second son of  Robert, fifth earl of Oxford. (Wright.) Lady Jane Grey"]]]
