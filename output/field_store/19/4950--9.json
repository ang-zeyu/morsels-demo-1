Among the upper middle classes--to which I belonged--  the money-making proclivity is held in very low esteem, I assure you.  Our solicitude is to make ourselves mutually agreeable; and the natural result  is a grace and refinement which\"----    \"But what the (adj. sheol) good does that do the likes o' us (fellows)?\"  demanded Mosey impertinently--or perhaps I should say, pertinently.    --\"a grace and refinement which--if you will pardon me for saying so--  you can form no conception of.  Inherited wealth is the secret of it.\"    \"Beg parding,\" interposed Cooper apologetically--\"I was goin' to say  to Collins, before I forgit, that he can easy git over bein' a Port Philliper.  Friend o' mine, out on the Macquarie, name o' Mick Shanahan, he's one too;  an' when anybody calls him a Port Philliper, or a Vic., or a 'Sucker,  he comes out straight:  'You're a (adj.) liar,' says he; 'I'm a Cornstalk,  born in New South Wales.' An' he proves it too.  Born before the Separation,  in the District of Port Phillip, Colony of New South Wales.  That's his argyment, an' there's no gittin' over it.  Good idear, ain't it?\"    \"It is a good idea,\" I replied.  \"I'm glad you laid me on to it.  But, Willoughby, I can't help thinking you must feel the change very acutely.\"    \"I do.  But what is the use of grumbling?  Ver non semper viret.  No doubt you are surprised to see me in my present position.  It is owing,  in the first place, to a curious combination of circumstances,  and in the second place, to some of my own little pranks.  I am nephew to Sir Robert Brook, baronet, the present representative  of the Brooks of Brookcotes, Dorsetshire--a family, sir, dating from  the fourteenth century.  Possibly you have heard the name?\"    \"Often.\"    \"Not the Brookes of the King's Elms, Hants, pray observe.  The Brookes of the King's Elms gained their enormous wealth  as army contractors, during the struggle with Napoleon, and their baronetcy,  Heaven knows how!  The baronetcy of the Brooks of Brookcotes dates from 1615,  at which time my maternal ancestor, Sir Roger Brook, knight,  procured his patent by supplying thirty infantry for three years in the  subjugation of Ireland.  Independently of the title, our family  is many centuries older than the other.  We spell our name without\"----    \"My (adj.) fambly come all the way down from the Hark,\" observed Mosey,  with a rudeness which reflected little credit on his ancient lineage.    ----\"without the final 'e.' There is a manifest breach of trust in creation  of these new baronetcies.  It was more than implied--it was  distinctly stipulated--at the origination of the Order, by James I,  that the number of baronets should not exceed two hundred,  and that there should be no new creations to supply the place of such titles  as might lapse through extinction of families.\"    \"And is there no remedy for this?\"  I asked.    \"None whatever.  Not that I am personally interested in the exclusiveness  of the Order, my connection with the Brooks of Brookcotes being  on the distaff side.  My mother was Sir Robert's only sister.  My father was a military man--3rd Buffs--died when I was twelve  or thirteen years of age.  Sir Robert was a confirmed bachelor,  and I was his only nephew.  Now you see my position?\"    \"I think I do.\"    \"Four years ago, demme if Sir Robert did n't marry a manufacturer's daughter--  soap manufacturer--and within two years there was a lineal heir to Brookcotes!\"    \"You don't say so?\"    \"Fact, begad! Shortly afterward, I was detected--ha-ha! Sua cuique voluptas--  in a liaison with a young person who resided with my uncle's wife  as a companion.  Whereupon my lady used her influence with the demd old dotard,  and I was cut off with a shilling.  However, he gave me a saloon passage  to Melbourne, with an order on his agent in that city for £500.  My lady's father also gave me letters of introduction to some friends  in Sydney--business people.  Fact was, they wanted to get rid of me.\"    \"The £500 should have given you a fair start,\" I suggested.    \"Pardon me--it is impossible for you to enter into the feelings  of a man who has been brought up as presumptive heir to a rent-roll of £12,000.  You cannot imagine how the mind of a gentleman shrinks from the petty details,  the meanness, the vulgarities of trade.  You are aware, I presume,  that all avenues of ambition except the Church, the Army, and the Legislature,  are closed to our class?  You cannot imagine--pardon my repeating it--  the exclusiveness, the fine sense of honour\"    \"Holy sailor!\"  I heard Thompson whisper to himself.    ----\"which pervades the mind and controls the actions of a gentleman.  As a casual illustration of what is amusingly, though somewhat provokingly,  ignored here, you have, no doubt, observed that our gentlemen cricketers  will acknowledge no fellowship with professionals, though they may belong  to the same team, and be paid from the same funds.  However,  to proceed with a story which is, perhaps, not without interest.  I left Melbourne before my pittance was exhausted, and presented my credentials  in Sydney.  Mr. Wilcox, a relation of my lady's father, and a person  of some local importance, treated me at first with consideration--in fact,  there was always a knife and fork for me at his table--but I noticed,  as time went on, a growing coolness on his part.  I ought to mention  that his sister, Mrs. Bradshaw--a widow, fat, fair, and forty--  had considerable capital invested in his business; and I was paying  my addresses to her, deeming my birth and education a sufficient counterpoise  to her wealth.  I'd have married her too, begad I would!  At this time,  Wilcox was establishing gelatine works; and he had the demd effron\"----    \"What's gelatine?\" demanded Mosey.  \"I've of'en heard o' the (adj.) stuff.  What the (sheol) is it used in?\"    \"In commerce, principally, Mosey,\" I replied.    \"Neat, begad! As I was saying, Wilcox had the demd assurance to offer me  a clerkship in his new establishment.  We had a few words in consequence;  and shortly afterward I left Sydney, and found my way here.  Have you any acquaintance in Sydney--may I ask?\"    [A word of explanation.  Being only an official of the ninth class,  I received my appointment in Hay.  On that occasion, I asked the magistrate  who received my securities and otherwise attended to the matter--  I naturally asked him what chance I had for promotion.  He told me  that it would go strictly by seniority, but, as my immediate superior,  the Assistant-Sub-Inspector, was not eligible for any higher grade--  never having passed any examination whatever--and as I could not be advanced  over his head, my only chance was to step into his place when he vacated it   Now, I knew he was not likely to resign, for he had a good salary  all to himself, and nothing to do but refer me to the Central Office  for orders.  I knew in fact, that there was only one way  in which he was likely to quit his niche in the edifice of the State.  So I replied to Willoughby's question]    \"Well, I may say I have; and yet I'm not aware of anyone in Sydney  that I would know by sight.  My superior officer lives there.  Remotely possible you may know him--Rudolph Winterbottom, esquire.\"    \"Rudolph Winterbottom--did you say?  Yes, by Jove! rather a happy coincidence.  I remember him well.  I was introduced to him on a reception day  at Government House, and met him frequently afterward; dined in his company,  I think, on two occasions.\"    \"Is he a very old man?\"    \"No; the old gentleman is his father--Thomas Winterbottom--hale,  sturdy old boy, overflowing with vitality--came out, he told me,  in the time of Sir Richard Bourke.  But I scarcely think  Mr. Rudolph Winterbottom holds any Government situation.  His private fortune is fully sufficient for all demands of even good society.  Ah! now I have it! His son Rudy--his third or fourth son--  holds some appointment.  That will be your man.\"    \"Very likely.  An invalid--is he not?  Something wrong with his lungs?\"    \"So I should imagine, now that you mention it.  He was away on an excursion  to the mountains when his father spoke of him to me.\"    \"Git to sleep, chaps, for Gossake,\" murmured Cooper.  \"Guarantee there'll be  none o' this liveliness in the mornin', when you got to turn out.\"    Thus sensibly admonished, we committed ourselves to what Macbeth calls  'sore labour's bath'--the only kind of bath we were likely to have  for some time.    Among the thousand natural ills, there are two to which I never have been,  and probably never shall be, subject--namely, gout and insomnia.  My immunity from the former might be difficult to account for,  but my exemption from the latter may, I think, be attributed to the operation  of a mind at peace with all below.  Nevertheless, it used to be my habit  to wake punctually at 2 a.m., for the purpose of remembering  whether I had to listen for bells or not, and determining how long  I could afford to sleep.  So, at that exact hour, I opened my eyes  to see the calm, splendid stars above, whilst merciful darkness  half-veiled the sordid accessories of daily life below.  Yet I noticed  that the hammock under the rear of Dixon's wagon was empty.  All the other fellows were sleeping, except Bum, who seemed to have disappeared  altogether.  The two were probably up to something.  No business of mine.  And I dropped to sleep again.    I had set myself to wake at full daylight.  Just as I woke,  I heard the distant patter of a galloping horse.  Such a sound at such a time  is ominous to duffing bullock drivers; so, as I sprang to my feet,  you may be sure my companions were not much behind me.  Along the track,  a mile in advance of the wagons, we saw an approaching horseman.  And as if this was n't enough, we heard the sound of an axe in the selection.    \"Holy glory! there's somebody livin' in the hut, after all!\" ejaculated Mosey."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34736"],[0,"True Christianity (#12)"],[1,"obedience. Sufficient it surely was for him, that he was made  capable of all the benefits of the divine image; of sincere and unmixed  love and delight; of undisturbed and solid tranquillity of mind; of power,  fortitude, peace, light, and life. But not duly reflecting that he himself  was not the _chief good_, but merely a mirror of the Godhead, formed  purposely to receive the reflection of the divine nature, he erected  himself into a _God_; and thus choosing to be the highest _good_ to  himself, he was precipitated into the greatest of all evils, being  deprived of this inestimable image, and alienated from that communion with  God, which, by virtue of it, he before enjoyed.    9. Had self-will, self-love, and self-honor, been excluded, the image of  God could not have departed from man; but the Divine Being would have  continued to be his sole glory, honor, and praise. As everything is  capable of its like and not of its contrary, and in its like acquiesces  and delights, so man, being in the similitude of God, was thereby prepared  to receive God into himself, who was also ready to communicate himself to  man, with all the treasures of his goodness; goodness being of all things  the most communicative of itself.    10. Finally, man ought to have learned from the image of God, that by  means of it he is united to God; and that in this union, his true and  everlasting tranquillity, his rest, peace, joy, life, and happiness alone  consist. He should have learned that all restlessness of mind and vexation  of spirit, arise from nothing but a breach of this union, by which he  ceases to be the image of God; for man no sooner turns to the creature,  than he is deprived of that eternal good which is to be derived from God  alone.          Chapter II.                                 Of The Fall Of Adam.          _As by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by the      obedience of one shall many be made righteous._--ROM. 5:19.      The fall of Adam was disobedience to God, by which man turned away from  the Divine Being to himself, and robbed God of the honor due to him alone,  in that he _himself_ thought to be _as God_. But while he thus labored to  advance himself, he was stripped of that divine image, which the Creator  had so freely conferred on him; divested of hereditary righteousness; and  bereaved of that holiness with which he was originally adorned; becoming,  as it regards his _understanding_, dark and blind; as to his _will_,  stubborn and perverse; and as to all the powers and faculties of the soul,  entirely alienated from God. This evil has infected the whole mass of  mankind, by means of a fleshly generation; and has been inherited by all  men. The obvious consequence arising from this is, that man is become  spiritually dead and the child of wrath and damnation, until redeemed from  this miserable state by Jesus Christ. Let not then any who are called  Christians deceive themselves with regard to Adam's fall. Let them be  cautious, how they attempt to extenuate or lessen the transgression of  Adam, as though it were a small sin, a thing of little consequence, and,  at the worst, but the eating of an apple. Let them rather be assured, that  the guilt of Adam was that of Lucifer, namely, _he would be as God_: and  that it was the same most grievous, heinous, and hateful sin in both.    2. This apostasy (for it was nothing less), was, at first, generated in  the heart, and then made manifest by the eating of the forbidden fruit.  Though man was numbered with the sons of God; though he came forth from  the hands of the Almighty spotless both in body and in soul, and was the  most glorious object in the creation; though, to crown all, he was not  only a son, but the _delight_ of God; yet not knowing how to rest  satisfied with these high privileges, he attempted to invade Heaven, that  he might be yet higher; and nothing less would suffice him, than to exalt  himself like unto God. Hence, he conceived in his heart enmity and hatred  against the Divine Being, his Creator and Father, whom, had it been in his  power, he was disposed utterly to undo. Who could commit a sin more  detestable than this? or what greater abomination is there, that it was  possible to meditate?    3. Hence it was, that man became inwardly like Satan himself, bearing his  likeness in the heart; since both had now committed the same sin, both  having rebelled against the majesty of Heaven. Man no more exhibits an  image of God, but rather that of the Devil; he no longer is an instrument  in the hands of God, but is become an organ of Satan, and is thereby  rendered capable of every species of diabolical wickedness: so that,  having lost that image which was heavenly, spiritual, and divine, he is  altogether earthly, sensual, and brutish. For the devil, designing to  imprint his own image upon man, fascinated him so entirely by a train of  enticing and deceitful words, that man permitted him to sow that hateful  seed in his soul, which is hence termed the seed of the serpent; and by  which is chiefly meant, self-love, self-will, and the ambition of being as  God. On this account it is, that the Scriptures term those who are  intoxicated with self-love, \"a generation of vipers.\" Matt. 3:7. And all  those who are of a proud and devilish nature, \"the seed (progeny) of the  serpent.\" So the Almighty, addressing the serpent, says, \"I will put  enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed.\"  Gen. 3:15.    4. From this seed of the serpent nothing but deadly and horrible fruit can  possibly proceed; namely, Satan's image, the children of Belial, the  children of the devil. John 8:44. As in every natural seed, how minute  soever it may be, are contained, in a most wonderful and hidden manner,  the nature and properties of the future plant, all its parts and  proportions, its branches, leaves, and flowers, in miniature; so in that  seed of the serpent, Adam's self-love and disobedience (which has passed  unto all his posterity by a fleshly generation), there lies, as it were in  embryo, the tree of death, with its branches, leaves, and flowers, and  those innumerable fruits of unrighteousness which grow upon it. In short,  the whole image of Satan is secretly traced out there, with all its marks,  characters, and properties.    5. If we observe a little child with attention, we shall see how this  natural corruption displays itself from its very birth; and how self-will  and disobedience especially discover themselves, and break forth into  actions that effectually witness to the hidden root from which they  spring. Let us consider the child further, as it grows up to maturer  years. Observe the natural selfishness of the youth, his inbred ambition,  his thirst after worldly glory, his love of applause, his pursuit of  revenge, and his proneness to deceit and falsehood. And now these evils  multiply. Soon may be discovered in him vanity, arrogance, pride,  blasphemy, vain oaths, awful curses, frauds, skepticism, infidelity,  contempt of God and his holy Word, and disobedience to parents and  magistrates: wrath and contentiousness; hatred and envy; revenge and  murder, and all kinds of cruelty; especially if outward occasions offer  themselves, and call forth into action this latent and deadly seed, and  the various evils of Adam's depraved nature. In proportion as such  occasions continue to present themselves, we shall observe the appearance  of other vices; wantonness, adulterous thoughts, lewd imaginations,  obscene discourses, lascivious gestures, and all \"the works of the flesh:\"  we shall behold drunkenness, rioting, and every species of intemperance;  fickleness, excessive wantonness, and all that can please the appetite,  the lust of the eye, and the pride of life. And besides these, there may  soon be discovered, covetousness, extortion, chicanery, sophistry,  imposture, and every description of sinister practice; together with  knavery, overreaching in trade, and, in short, the whole troop, or rather  army of sins, iniquities, and crimes, which are so various and so many,  that it is impossible to recount or declare the number of them; according  to the words of the prophet Jeremiah, \"the heart is deceitful above all  things, and desperately wicked; who can know it?\" Ch. 17:9. And if to  those already enumerated there be added, in the last place, the seducing  and false spirits; then may be observed schisms in the church, wicked and  dangerous heresies, yea, the abjuring of God and Christ, idolatry, the  denial of the faith, hatred and persecution of the truth, the sin against  the Holy Ghost, with every kind of corruption in doctrine, perversion of  the Scriptures, and strong delusion. Now, what are all these but the image  of Satan, and the fruits of the serpent's seed sown in man?    6. Who could ever have supposed that such a depth of wickedness and  depravity could be found in such a weak and helpless child; that so  venomous a principle, so corrupt a heart, lay hid in a babe apparently so  harmless? Who could possibly have believed this, had not man himself, by  his sinful and abominable life, by the imaginations of his thoughts (being  \"only evil continually,\" and desperately bent on what is bad), of his own  will brought it to light, and expressed, from his childhood, what was  before concealed as in a seed? Gen. 6:5; 8:21.    7. Oh! most vile and most accursed root! from which springs the poisonous  tree that is so fruitful in the production of every kind of plague. Oh,  seed of the serpent, most hateful, most dreadful! from which an image at  once so deformed and foul is generated; and which continually enlarges  itself, as it is excited by outward temptations and by the scandals of the  world. Full well might the blessed Jesus so solemnly and strictly forbid,  that any, by bad example, should offend little children; knowing that the  seed of the serpent lurks in them, as the"]]]
