[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34607"],[0,"Woodcraft and Camping (#12)"],[1," The First Night]    Then follows an hour of busy work, bringing wood to camp and packing  browse. The wood is sufficient; but the browse is picked, or cut, all  too coarse, and there is only enough of it to make the camp look green  and pleasant--not enough to rest weary shoulders and backs. But, they  are sound on the bonfire. They pile on the wood in the usual way,  criss-cross and haphazard. It makes a grand fire, and lights up the  forest for fifty yards around, and the tired youngsters turn in. Having  the advantage of driving a team to the camping ground, they are well  supplied with blankets and robes. They ought to sleep soundly, but they  don't. The usual drawbacks of a first night in camp are soon manifested  in uneasy twistings and turnings, grumbling at stubs, knots, and sticks,  that utterly ignore conformity with the angles of the human frame. But  at last, tired nature asserts her supremacy, and they sleep. Sleep  soundly, for a couple of hours; when the bonfire, having reached the  point of disintegration, suddenly collapses with a sputtering and  crackling that brings them to their head's antipodes, and four dazed,  sleepy faces look out with a bewildered air, to see what has caused the  rumpus. All take a hand in putting the brands together and re-arranging  the fire, which burns better than at first; some sleepy talk, one or two  feeble attempts at a smoke, and they turn in again. But, there is not an  hour during the remainder of the night in which some one is not  pottering about the fire.    The O.W., who has abided by his blanket-bag all night--quietly taking in  the fun--rouses out the party at 4 A. M. For two of them are to fish  Asaph Run with bait, and the other two are to try the riffles of Marsh  Creek with the fly. As the wood is all burned to cinders and glowing  coals, there is no chance for a smoky fire; and, substituting coffee for  tea, the breakfast is a repetition of the supper.    By sunrise the boys are off, and the O. W. has the camp to himself. He  takes it leisurely, gets up a neat breakfast of trout, bread, butter,  and coffee, cleans and puts away his dishes, has a smoke, and picks up  the camp axe. Selecting a bushy hemlock fifteen inches across, he lets  it down in as many minutes, trims it to the very tip, piles the limbs in  a heap, and cuts three lengths of six feet each from the butt. This  insures browse and back logs for some time ahead. Two strong stakes are  cut and sharpened. Four small logs, two of eight and two of nine feet in  length, are prepared, plenty of night wood is made ready, a supply of  bright, dry hemlock bark is carried to camp, and the O. W. rests from  his labors, resuming his favorite pastime of sitting on a log and  smoking navy plug. Finally it occurs to him that he is there partly as  guide and mentor to the younger men, and that they need a lesson on  cleanliness. He brings out the frying-pans and finds a filthy-looking  mess of grease in each one, wherein ants, flies, and other insects have  contrived to get mixed. Does he heat some water, and clean and scour the  pans? Not if he knows himself. If he did it once he might keep on doing  it. He is cautious about establishing precedents, and he has a taste for  entomology. He places the pans in the sun where the grease will soften  and goes skirmishing for ants and doodle bugs. They are not far to seek,  and he soon has a score of large black ants, with a few bugs and  spiders, pretty equally distributed among the frying-pans. To give the  thing a plausible look a few flies are added, and the two largest pans  are finished off, one with a large earwig, the other with a  thousand-legged worm. The pans are replaced in the shanty, the embers  are leveled and nearly covered with bits of dry hemlock bark, and the O.  W. resumes his pipe and log        With such a face of Christian satisfaction,      As good men wear, who have done a virtuous action.    Before noon the boys are all in, and as the catch is twice as numerous  and twice as large as on the previous evening, and as the weather is all  that could be asked of the longest days in June, they are in excellent  spirits. The boxes are brought out, pork is sliced, a can of Indian meal  comes to the front, and they go for the frying-pans.    \"Holy Moses! Look here. Just see the ants and bugs.\"    Second Man.--\"Well, I should say! I can see your ants and bugs, and go  you an earwig better.\"    Third Man (inverting his pan spitefully over the fire).--\"D--n 'em, I'll  roast the beggars.\"    Bush D. (who is something of a cook and woodsman) \"Boys, I'll take the  pot. I've got a thousand-legged worm at the head of a pismire flush, and  it serves us right, for a lot of slovens. Dishes should be cleaned as  often as they are used. Now let's scour our pans and commence right.\"    [Sidenote: Their Lesson]    Hot water, ashes, and soap soon restore the pans to pristine brightness;  three frying-pans are filled with trout well rolled in meal; a fourth is  used for cooking a can of tomatoes; the coffee is strong, and everything  comes out without being smoked or scorched. The trout are browned to a  turn, and even the O. W. admits that the dinner is a success. When it is  over and the dishes are cleaned and put away, and the camp slicked up,  there comes the usual two hours of lounging, smoking, and story  telling, so dear to the hearts of those who love to go a-fishing and  camping. At length there is a lull in the conversation, and Bush D.  turns to the old woodsman with, \"I thought, 'Uncle Mart,' you were going  to show us fellows such a lot of kinks about camping out, camp-fires,  cooking, and all that sort of thing, isn't it about time to begin?  Strikes me you have spent most of the last twenty-four hours holding  down that log.\"    \"Except cutting some night wood and tending the fire,\" adds number two.    The old woodsman, who has been rather silent up to this time, knocks the  ashes leisurely from his pipe, and gets on his feet for a few remarks.  He says, \"Boys, a bumblebee is biggest when it's first born. You've  learned more than you think in the last twenty-four hours.\"    \"Well, as how? Explain yourself,\" says Bush D.    O. W.--\"In the first place, you have learned better than to stick your  cooking-kit into a tumbled down heap of knots, mulch and wet bark, only  to upset and melt down the pots, and scorch or smoke everything in the  pans, until a starving hound wouldn't eat the mess. And you have found  that it doesn't take a log heap to boil a pot of coffee or fry a pan of  trout. Also, that a level bed of live coals makes an excellent cooking  fire, though I will show you a better. Yesterday you cooked the worst  meal I ever saw in the woods. Today you get up a really good, plain  dinner; you have learned that much in one day. Oh, you improve some. And  I think you have taken a lesson in cleanliness today.\"    \"Yes; but we learned that of the ant--and bug,\" says number two.    O. W.--\"Just so. And did you think all the ants and doodlebugs blundered  into that grease in one morning? I put 'em in myself--to give you a  'kink.'\"    Bush D. (disgusted).--\"You blasted, dirty old sinner.\"    Second Man.--\"Oh, you miserable old swamp savage; I shan't get over that  earwig in a month.\"    Third Man (plaintively).--\"This life in the woods isn't what it's  cracked up to be; I don't relish bugs and spiders. I wish I were home.  I'm all bitten up with punkies, and----\"    Fourth Man (savagely).--\"Dashed old woods-loafer; let's tie his hands  and fire him in the creek.\"    O. W. (placidly).--\"Exactly, boys. Your remarks are terse, and to the  point. Only, as I am going to show you a trick or two on woodcraft this  afternoon, you can afford to wait a little. Now, quit smoking, and get  out your hatchets; we'll go to work.\"    Three hatchets are brought to light; one of them a two-pound clumsy  hand-axe, the others of an old time, Mt. Vernon, G. W. pattern. \"And  now,\" says good-natured Bush, \"you give directions and we'll do the  work.\"    [Illustration: G. W. HATCHET]    Under directions, the coarse browse of the previous night is placed  outside the shanty; three active youngsters, on hands and knees, feel  out and cut off every offending stub and root inside the shanty, until  it is smooth as a floor. The four small logs are brought to camp; the  two longest are laid at the sides and staked in place; the others are  placed, one at the head, the other at the foot, also staked; and the  camp has acquired definite outlines, and a measurable size of eight by  nine feet. Three hemlock logs and two sharpened stakes are toted to  camp; the stakes driven firmly, and the logs laid against them, one  above the other. Fire-dogs, fore-stick, etc., complete the arrangement,  and the camp-fire is in shape for the coming night, precisely as shown  in the engraving on page 33.    \"And now,\" says the O. W., \"if three of you will go down to the flat and  pick the browse clean from the two hemlock tops, Bush and I will fix a  cooking-range.\"    \"A--what?\" asks one.    \"Going to start a boarding-house?\" says another.    \"Notion of going into the hardware business?\" suggests a third.    \"Never mind, sonny; just 'tend to that browse, and when you see a smoke  raising on the flat by the spring, come over and see the range.\" And the  boys, taking a couple of blankets in which to carry the browse, saunter  away to the flat below.    A very leisurely aesthetic, fragrant occupation is this picking browse.  It should never be cut, but pulled, stripped or broken. I have seen a  Senator, ex-Governor, and a wealthy banker enjoying themselves hugely at  it, varying the occupation by hacking small timber with their G. W.  hatchets, like so many boys let loose from school. It may have looked a  trifle undignified, but I dare say they found their account in it.  Newport or Long Branch would have been more expensive, and much less  healthful.

They were both good and well-disposed, and as  they had never expected their married life to be spent in an earthly  paradise, they were not disappointed. Custom, a common occupation, and  mutual respect bound them to each other. Time passed uneventfully until  the end of the first year, when a child was born, and the young father  again felt his heart beat as it had not done for a long time. The infant  only survived its birth a few weeks, and grief brought the young couple  into closer sympathy than before. Old Manasse died about the same time,  and the whole responsibility of the business fell upon their shoulders.  Nathan had to go away on long journeys, and Chane became a trustworthy  stewardess of the great house. She learned to read and write German, so  as to be able to help her husband in the business, while his personal  comforts were her ceaseless care. He had the greatest esteem for her,  and brought her many presents from Lemberg and Czernowitz. They were  contented with their lot, and were happy enough.    Happy enough--why were they not quite happy?    Because they did not love one another. They knew nothing of love except  that Christians, previous to marriage, fell in love; and what concern  had a Jew in Christian usages?    They were happy enough, and their married life seemed firmly founded on  esteem for each other, and on their common interests and work; but the  storms of passion were to shake the structure to its base, and after  throwing it down, were to carry them onward to grief and pain.           *       *       *       *       *    Barnow is a very small town, a squalid nook in a God-forgotten corner of  the earth, where the great current of life hardly seems to cause the  faintest ripple--but it has its _casino_. This is only a modest little  room in the court behind Nathan's shop, containing two tables and a few  chairs. Nathan had opened it for the use of his principal customers.  Here the officials and magnates of Barnow are accustomed to drink their  morning glasses and discuss politics; and if their wives allow them,  they do the same again in the evening. The high-born Florian von  Bolwinski, a squire without land, and a bachelor, drinks not only his  morning and evening glasses in this room, but sundry others also,  filling up the intervals with expeditions to make love to a cook, or  squeeze a Jew, or execute some important business. The former district  judge, Herr Hippolyt Lozinski, had been a constant customer; and the  little room did him one good service in giving him a red nose, which was  a fine contrast to his yellow complexion. When the red deepened to ruby  color he died, rather to the delight of the district, and to the grief  of his many admirers. Frau Kasimira retired to the estate of the Von  Cybulskies, a small, heavily mortgaged farmhouse near Tarnopol; and the  new district judge, Herr Julko von Negrusz, took up his residence in the  first floor of the white house. He took the place of his predecessor at  the _casino_ also, but without frequenting it so continually as he had  been used to do.    Herr von Negrusz was a man of about thirty. He was recognized at once to  be an excellent jurist, and when better known, he was also considered a  good fellow. A district judge in Podolia is a sort of demigod, and is  either the blessing or curse of the district. Herr von Negrusz made a  good use of his power. There is not much to be said about his external  appearance: he was a slightly built man, with quiet brown eyes and a  face that could neither be called handsome nor ugly. The custom-house  officer's three sallow elderly daughters considered him a barbarian, and  quite unsusceptible to the charms of women. He did not care for ladies'  society.    Herr von Negrusz soon became a constant guest in the little parlor  behind the grocer's shop. He went there daily when he left the office,  and spent half an hour reading the newspapers before going home to the  dinner prepared by his old housekeeper. As the entrance by the court was  inconvenient and not very clean, he always, like most of the guests,  went through the shop where Nathan Silberstein's beautiful wife  superintended the business. It was his habit to pass her with a bow. He  never talked and joked with her, as did most of the older men and the  young officers. He had no particular reason for acting thus, except that  much laughing and joking was not in his way. He may also have thought  that what these men called compliments were probably objectionable to  her; but if so, he was mistaken--Chane was indifferent to what they  said, and regarded their talk as one of the annoyances inseparable from  attendance in the shop, as, for example, the draughts. Her manner was  very decided, and she was well able to protect herself from  impertinence. She answered the elder men with the same lightness as they  used in speaking to her, while she greeted the officers curtly and  laconically. When love was made the subject of conversation, she would  laugh and joke almost extravagantly. Love was not only an enigma to her,  for she had never felt it, but it was positively ludicrous in her eyes.  Whoever ventured, between the first and second pints, to say to her, \"I  love you,\" she openly derided and inwardly despised; but whoever  attempted to slip his arm round her waist ... well, to find this out,  you have only to ask little Lieutenant Albert Sturm, a forward,  ill-favored, saucy young fellow, why his right cheek was once redder and  rounder than his left for the space of a week.    She never needed to protect herself from word or look of the district  judge. For the first three months after his arrival they did not  exchange a word. Such stiffness was most unusual in Barnow, where every  one knew each other, more especially as she and Herr von Negrusz  inhabited the same house, and Chane expressed her surprise openly and  unaffectedly to her husband.    One day Nathan stood at the shop-door for a long time in earnest  conversation with the district judge and Florian von Bolwinski. At last  Negrusz went away to his office, while Florian entered the shop with the  merchant, in order to drink an extra glass for the good of his  digestion.    \"Nathan,\" said Chane, \"what a strange man the district judge is! He must  be very proud! He has never yet spoken to me.\"    \"No, he is not at all proud,\" answered Nathan. \"He is one of the most  good-natured men I know, but he is not a great talker. Why he is so  silent I can not tell--perhaps he is unhappy.\"    \"Ho, ho!\" growled Florian. \"What a vain woman your wife is, Pani Nathan!  We are all at her feet, but that is not enough for her. She wants young  Herr Julko to be the next victim. Ho, ho, ho! All her trouble will be  thrown away upon him, however, for he is already in love. God's  punishment is in store for her!\"    Chane waited patiently until the old toper had finished speaking: she  was accustomed to his rude witticisms.    \"We are not all as light-hearted as you are,\" she answered, \"and this  man really seems too sensible to be capable of falling in love.\"    Herr Florian put his hands on his sides and laughed and sniggered. \"Ho,  ho!\" he gasped. \"Did you ever hear such nonsense?... Ho, ho, ho!... As  if only stupid people could fall in love!... Am I stupid? and--Pani  Nathan, are you not jealous?--I am in love with her. To punish you, I  must assure you that he is already disposed of!... his heart is buried  in a grave. Ho, ho, ho!\"    \"Fool!\" muttered Chane impatiently, while Herr Florian staggered into  the _casino_ with Nathan.    She could not get what he had told her out of her head, and in the  evening, when she sat arranging business letters with her husband, who  was to leave home next day, she suddenly asked--    \"What did Bolwinski mean by saying that Herr von Negrusz's heart was  buried in a grave?\"    \"I do not know,\" replied Nathan; \"but the story goes that he was in love  with a girl who died, and that he will never marry. It may be true, for  Christians are fools when they are in love.\"    \"Ah!\" said Chane, staring thoughtfully at the flame of the lamp.    She soon took her pen again, and finished a letter to Moses Rosenzweig,  ordering a barrel of herrings and five hundredweights of sugar from  Czernowitz.           *       *       *       *       *    Next day a strange thing happened.    Herr Florian Bolwinski is not only a fat man, he is also a good-natured  man. As he has never injured any one, he is not afraid of any  one--except his landlady, although he has never injured her. He is  good-natured, but he has one great fault--he tells everything that he  knows, and even invents a little now and then. These additions are the  fruit, partly of a vivid imagination, and partly of his numerous  potations. Next morning, when he sat alone in the _casino_ with the  district judge, he related how Frau Chane had opened her heart to him,  and had confessed, with torrents of tears, her mad love for Herr von  Negrusz, and that she felt inclined to kill herself in despair, because  the object of her passionate love did not take any notice of her, and  would not waste one word upon her, even if she were dying.    Herr Florian did not make his story as short as I have given it above,  but he went into every little particular, giving the most graphic  descriptions of the whole scene.    He interrupted himself several times to laugh, \"Ho, ho, ho!\" and  ejaculate, \"Do you see!\" He had to do this to give himself breath, for  Herr von Negrusz said not a word. He listened gravely, only occasionally  allowing a sarcastic smile to play upon his lips. Herr Florian disliked  this smile, and as often as he saw it he could not help feeling  embarrassed. This he tried to hide by adorning his tale still more. \"Now  what do you think of it all?\" he concluded, out of breath.    \"What do I think of it?\" repeated the district judge. \"I only admire  your "]]]
