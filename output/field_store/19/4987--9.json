When feeding, as well as when resting, they remain  exposed upon the leaf and seem never to attempt to conceal themselves,  as is the habit with a large proportion of caterpillars. It is  probable that this instinct for remaining exposed to view bears some  relation to the curious means of protection possessed by this as well  as other Swallowtail caterpillars. When disturbed one of these larvae  will push out from just back of the head the strange-looking,  orange-yellow Y-shaped organ which gives off a very disagreeable odor.  These osmateria organs are generally believed to be defensive against  the attack of birds and various other enemies, although they seem not  to be effective against insect parasites.    The full-grown caterpillars are likely to leave their food plants when  ready to change to the chrysalis state. They wander in various  directions until suitable shelter is found. A piece of board, a fence  post, or possibly the bark of a tree will answer for this purpose.  Here the caterpillar spins a mat of silk in which to entangle its hind  legs and a short distance away near the front end of the body it spins  a loop of silk attaching the ends to the support. These serve to hold  the chrysalis in place during this helpless period. After the loop is  made the caterpillar keeps its head through it so that the loop holds  the insect in position a short distance back of the head. It is now  ready to moult its last caterpillar skin and become a chrysalis.    One who has watched hundreds of these caterpillars go through this  change, Miss Mary C. Dickerson, describes the process in these words:  \"In this final moult the chrysalis has to work very hard. The bulk of  the body is again slipped forward in the loosened caterpillar skin, so  that this becomes tensely stretched over the anterior end, and very  much wrinkled at the posterior end. The skin splits back of the head  and is forced back by its own taut condition and by the efforts of the  chrysalis, until only the extreme posterior end of the chrysalis is  within it. Then the chrysalis withdraws this posterior end with its  many very tiny hooks, from the skin on the dorsal side, and, reaching  around, securely fastens the hooks into the button of silk. Then the  old skin is removed both from its fastening to the chrysalis and from  its attachment in the button of silk.\"    A short time after the caterpillar's skin has thus been cast off the  chrysalis takes on a brownish color which as is so often the case is  likely to vary somewhat according to the tint of the surrounding  surfaces. This is doubtless a protective device and helps the insect  to escape attack by birds during the long period of exposure. For this  butterfly passes through the winter only in the chrysalis condition,  and the larva which went into the chrysalis in September does not come  out as a butterfly until the following May or June. There are,  however, two broods of the butterflies in the North and at least three  in the South. As the adults live for about two months and there is  considerable variation in the periods of their development it happens  that one can find these Black Swallowtail butterflies upon the wing  almost any time in warm weather, either North or South.       =The Giant Swallowtail=    _Papilio thoas_    The largest of our North American butterflies is a magnificent insect  with a wing expanse of some four inches and with a rich coloring of  black and yellow more or less suffused with greenish or bluish  iridescence that gives it a striking beauty as it flies leisurely  about from flower to flower or stops to lay an egg upon some bush or  tree. The tails are long and expanded toward the tip, their prevailing  color being black with a broad splash of yellow near the end. In a  general way we may say that the upper wing surface is black marked  with two bands of orange-yellow, while the under surface is yellow  marked with two bands of black. (_See plate, page 64._)    The Giant Swallowtail is a tropical species which is abundant  throughout the Southern states and during recent years seems to have  been gradually extending its northern range. It is now commonly found  as far north as forty-two degrees latitude, from Nebraska eastward. In  New England it is occasionally taken in Connecticut, Massachusetts,  and even in Maine, but its appearance in this region is exceptional.    In the orange-growing regions of the Southern states the caterpillars  of this butterfly feed freely upon the leaves of citrus fruits and  they are often called \"orange puppies\" or \"orange dogs.\" Probably  their curious appearance and their habit of resting for long periods  upon leaf or twig gave rise to this name. In the region indicated the  life-history of the insect may be summarized thus:    The mother butterfly deposits the eggs singly upon the young growth of  orange or other citrus fruit trees, generally near the tips of leaves  or branches. About a week later each egg hatches into a caterpillar  that feeds upon the young leaves, resting upon the lower surface when  not eating. After a few days of this feeding the caterpillar becomes  too large for the skin with which it was born and it moults, coming  forth with a new skin which soon hardens so that it can begin feeding  again. A week or so later it moults for the second time, and continues  these processes of feeding and moulting until full grown, which is  perhaps a month from the time of hatching from the egg. At first the  caterpillars eat only the succulent young leaves and branches, but as  they grow larger they feed more freely upon the older foliage. They  are very voracious and when abundant may often do much damage  especially to young trees. When ready to change to the chrysalis each  caterpillar attaches itself by silken threads to the bark of the  trunk or branch of the tree. Here it changes to a chrysalis which  takes on a color so similar to that of the bark that the insect is  surprisingly difficult to discover. A fortnight or so later it changes  again into a fully developed butterfly that sallies forth in search of  the nectar of flowers. (_See plate, page 240._)    These \"orange dogs,\" like the caterpillars of other Swallowtail  butterflies, have curious yellow scent organs which, when the  caterpillar is disturbed, protrude from the upper surface just behind  the head. These give forth a very disagreeable odor which is believed  to serve the purpose of repelling birds and possibly other enemies. It  has been noticed that these caterpillars are not molested by birds  although they are attacked by various insect enemies. Each mother  butterfly is known to be able to deposit four or five hundred eggs and  it has been suggested that the injuries of the caterpillars may be  checked by shooting the butterfly upon the wing with cartridges loaded  with small bird shot. In the South there are several broods in a  season.    The life-history of this species in more northern regions differs in  the choice of the food plant and the number of broods. It feeds upon  various members of the rue family, including common rue and prickly  ash, as well as upon certain poplars and probably other trees. It is  two brooded and apparently winters as a chrysalis. The butterflies of  the first brood come from the chrysalis about the last of May and are  found on the wing during June. Those of the second brood come from the  chrysalis about the last of July and are found on the wing during  August and September. The length of time required from the laying of  the egg to the emergence of the butterfly varies greatly with the  locality and the temperature. It commonly extends over a period of  four or five weeks.         [Illustration: _From a drawing by Mary E.

The sheen  of metallic color upon its wings is certainly suggestive of the broad  expanse of similar colorings in the gorgeous butterflies from South  America. This species is easily recognized by the general blackness of  the front wings and the basal parts of the hind ones as seen from  above, about two thirds of the area of the latter being overlaid with  blue-green scales that give the metallic lustre characteristic of the  species. Near the outer border of the basal half of the front wings  there is a row of about five rather indistinct whitish spots, this row  being continued more distinctly on the hind wings. On the under  surface the white spots of the front wings are more pronounced than on  the upper, while each hind wing is brilliantly marked with about seven  large orange spots, part of them fringed on one or both sides with a  distinct margin of white. The extreme side borders of all four wings  are distinctly marked with white crescents and the fringes on the  tails as well as more or less of the darker fringes of the hind wings  are of a beautiful purple color. In the males each hind wing has along  the inner border a slender, pocket-like depression which is said to be  the seat of the scent organs. (_See plate, page 65._)    This splendid butterfly is a southern species.

Only a few of its uses can be  stated here. The two leading ones are the reduction of Ca3(PO4)2  for artificial manures and the sodium carbonate manufacture.  Foods depend on the productiveness of soils and on fertilizers,  and thus indirectly our daily bread is supplied by means of this  acid; and from sodium carbonate glass, soap, saleratus, baking-  powders, and most alkalies are made directly or indirectly. H2SO4  is employed in bleaching, dyeing, printing, telegraphy,  electroplating, galvanizing iron and wire, cleaning metals,  refining Au and Ag, making alum, blacking, vitriols, glucose,  mineral waters, ether, indigo, madder, nitroglycerine, gun-  cotton, parchment, celluloid, etc., etc.    FUMING SULPHURIC ACID.    95. Nordhausen or Fuming Sulphuric Acid, H2S207 used in  dissolving indigo and preparing coal-tar pigments, is made by  distilling FeSO4. 4FeSO4 + H2O = H2S207 + 2Fe203 + 2S02. This was  the original sulphuric acid. It is also formed when S03 is  dissolved in H2SO4. When exposed to the air, S03 escapes with  fuming.    CHAPTER XX.    AMMONIUM HYDRATE.    96. Preparation of Bases.--We have seen that many acids are made  by acting on a salt of the acid required, with a stronger acid.  This is the direct way. The following experiments will show that  bases may be prepared in a similar way by acting on salts of the  base required with other bases, which we may regard as stronger  than the ones to be obtained.    97. Preparation of NH4OH and NH3.    Experiment 57.--Powder 10 g. ammonium chloride, NH4Cl, in a mortar  and mix with 10 g. calcium hydrate, Ca(OH)2; recently slaked lime  is the best. Cover with water in a flask, and connect with Woulff  bottles, as for making HCl (Fig. 22); heat the flask for fifteen  minutes or more. The experiment may be tried on a smaller scale  with a t.t. if desired.    The reaction is: 2NH4Cl + Ca(OH)2 = CaCl2 + 2NH4OH. NH4OH is  broken up into NH3, ammonia gas, and water. NH4OH = NH3 + H2O.  These pass over into the first bottle, where the water takes up  the NH3, for which it has great affinity. One volume of water at  0° will absorb more than 1000 volumes of NH3. Thus NH4OH may be  called a solution of NH3, in H2O. Write the reaction.    Experiment 58.--Powder and mix 2 or 3 g. each of ammonium  nitrate, NH4NO3, and Ca(OH)2; put them into a t.t., and heat  slowly. Note the odor. 2NH4NO3 + Ca(OH)2 = ?    98. Tests.    Experiment 59.--(1) Generate a little of the gas in a t.t., and  note the odor. (2) Test the gas with wet red litmus paper. (3)  Put a little HCl into an e.d., and pass over it the fumes of NH3  from a d.t. Note the result, and write the equation. (4) Fill a  small t.t. with the gas by upward displacement; then, while still  inverted, put the mouth of the t.t. into water. Explain the rise  of the water. (5) How might NH4Cl be obtained from the NH4OH in  the Woulff bottles? (6) Test the liquid in each bottle with red  litmus paper. (7) Add some from the first bottle to 5 or 10 cc.  of a solution of FeSO4 or FeCl2, and look for a ppt. State the  reaction.    99. Formation.--Ammonia, hartshorn, exists in animal and  vegetable compounds, in salts, and, in small quantities, in the  atmosphere. Rain washes it from the atmosphere into the soil;  plants take it from the soil; animals extract it from plants.  Coal, bones, horns, etc., are the chief sources of it, and from  them it is obtained by distillation. It results also from  decomposing animal matter. NH3 can be produced by the direct  union of N and H, only by an electric discharge or by ozone. It  may be collected over Hg like other gases that are very soluble  in water.    100. Uses. --Ammonium hydrate, NH4OH, and ammonia, NH3, are used  in chemical operations, in making artificial ice, and to some  extent in medicine; from them also may be obtained ammonium  salts. State what you would put with NH4OH to obtain (NH4)2SO4.  To obtain NH4NO3. The use of NH4OH in the laboratory may be  illustrated by the following experiment:--    Experiment 60.--Into a t.t. put 10 cc. of a solution of ferrous  sulphate, FeSO4. Into another put 10 cc. of sodium sulphate  solution, Na2SO4. Add a little NH4OH to each. Notice a ppt. in  the one case but none in the other. If solutions of these two  compounds were mixed, the metals Fe and Na could be separated by  the addition of NH4OH, similar to the separation of Ag and Cu by  HCl. Try the experiment.    CHAPTER XXI.    SODIUM HYDRATE.    101. Preparation.    Experiment 61.--Dissolve 3 g. sodium carbonate, Na2CO3, in 10 or  15 cc. H2O in an e.d., and bring it to the boiling-point. Then  add to this a mixture of 1 or 2 g. calcium hydrate, Ca(OH)2, in 5  or 10cc. H2O. It will not dissolve. Boil the whole for five  minutes. Then pour off the liquid which holds NaOH in solution.  Evaporate if desired. This is the usual mode of preparing NaOH.    The reaction is Na2CO3 + Ca(OH)2 = 2NaOH + CaCO3. The residue is  Ca(OH)2 and CaCO3; the solution contains NaOH, which can be  solidified by evaporating the water. Sodium hydrate is an  ingredient in the manufacture of hard soap, and for this use  thousands of tons are made annually, mostly in Europe. It is an  important laboratory reagent, its use being similar to that of  ammonium hydrate. Exposed to the air, it takes up water and CO2,  forming a mixture of NaOH and Na2CO3. It is one of the strongest  alkalies, and corrodes the skin.    Experiment 62.--Put 20 cc. of H2O in a receiver. With the forceps  take a piece of Na, not larger than half a pea, from the naphtha  in which it is kept, drop it into the H2O, and at once cover the  receiver loosely with paper or cardboard. Watch the action, as  the Na decomposes H2O. HOH + Na = NaOH + H. If the water be hot  the action is so rapid that enough heat is produced to set the H  on fire. That the gas is H can be shown by putting the Na under  the mouth of a small inverted t.t., filled with cold water, in a  water-pan. Na rises to the top, and the t.t. fills with H, which  can be tested. NaOH dissolves in the water.102. Properties.    Experiment 63.--(1) Test with red litmus paper the solutions  obtained in the last two experiments. (2) To 5cc.of alum  solution, K2A12(SO4)4, add 2cc.of the liquid, and notice the  color and form of the ppt.    POTASSIUM HYDRATE.    103. KOH is made in the Same Way as NaOH.    Describe the process in full (Experiment 61), and give the  equation.    Experiment 64.--Drop a small piece of K into a receiver of H2O,  as in Experiment 62. The K must be very small, and the experiment  should not be watched at too close a range. The receiver should  not be covered with glass, but with paper. The H burns, uniting  with O of the air. The purple color is imparted by the burning,  or oxidation of small particles of K. Write the equation for the  combustion of each.    H2O might be considered the symbol of an acid, since it is the  union of H and a negative element; or, if written HOH, it might  be called a base, since it has a positive element and the (OH)  radical. It is neutral to litmus, and on this account might be  called a salt. It is better, however, to call it simply an oxide.    Potassium hydrate, caustic potash, is employed for the  manufacture of soft soap. As a chemical reagent its action is  almost precisely like that of caustic soda, though it is usually  considered a stronger base, as K is a more electro-positive  element than Na.    CALCIUM HYDRATE.    104. Calcium Hydrate, the Most Common of the Bases, is nearly as  important to them as H2SO4 is to acids. Since it is used to make  the other bases, it might be called the strongest base; as H2SO4  is often called the strongest acid. The strength of an acid or  base, however,depends on the substance to which it is applied, as  well as on itself, and for most purposes this one is classified  as a weaker base than the three previously described.    Sulphuric acid, the most useful of the acids, is not made  directly from its salts, but has to be synthesized. Calcium  hydrate is also made by an indirect process, as follows:    CaCO3, i.e. limestone, marble, etc., is burnt in kilns with C, a  process which separates the gas, CO2, according to the reaction:  CaCO3 = CaO + CO2. CaO is unslaked lime, or quick-lime. On  treating this with water, slaked lime, Ca(OH)2 is formed, with  generation of great heat. CaO + H2O = Ca(OH)2. Its affinity for  H2O is so great that it takes the latter from the air, if  exposed.    Experiment 65.--Saturate some unslaked lime with water, in an  e.d., and look for the results stated above, leaving it as long  as may be necessary.    105. Resume.--From the experiments in the last few chapters on  the three divisions of chemical compounds, acids, bases and  salts, we have seen (1) that acids and bases are the chemical  opposites of each other; (2) that salts are formed by the union  of acids and bases; (3) that some acids can be obtained from  their salts by the action of a stronger acid; (4) that some bases  can be got from salts by the similar action of other bases; (5)  that the strongest acids and bases, as well as others, may be  obtained in an indirect way by synthesis.    CHAPTER XXII.    OXIDES OF NITROGEN.    106. There are five oxides of N, only two of which are important.    NITROGEN MONOXIDE (N2O).    107. Preparation.    Experiment 66.--Put into a flask, holding 200cc, lOg of ammonium  nitrate, NH4NO3; heat it over wire gauze or asbestus in an iron  plate, having a d.t. connected with a large t.t., which is held  in a receiver of water, and from this t.t., another d.t. passing  into a pneumatic trough, so as to collect the gas over water  (Fig. 30). Have all the bearings tight. The reaction is NH4NO3 =  2H2O + N2O. The t.t. is for collecting the H2O.    [Fig. 30.]    Note the color of the liquid in the t.t.; taste a drop, and test  it with litmus. If the flask is heated too fast, some NO is  formed, and this"]]]
