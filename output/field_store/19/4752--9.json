Now to answer the first summons of a Nereid meant madness. Of this the  woman was fully aware; and her cunning cheated them even of their  revenge.[30]    Sometimes these supernatural beings bestow gifts of a more distinctly  divine character than any of the foregoing. A midwife in Strathspey, on  one such occasion, was desired to ask what she would, and it should be  granted if in the power of the fairies. She asked that success might  attend herself and her posterity in all similar operations. The gift was  conferred; and her great-grandson still continued to exercise it when  Mr. Stewart was collecting the materials for his work on the  superstitions of the Highlanders, published in 1823. In like manner the  Mohel, to whose adventure I have already referred, and who was  originally an avaricious man, received the grace of benevolence to the  poor, which caused him to live a long and happy life with his family, a  pattern unto the whole world. The gift was symbolized by the  restoration to him of his own bunch of keys, which he found with many  others in the possession of his uncanny conductor. This personage had  held the keys by virtue of his being lord over the hearts of those who  never at any time do good: in other words, he was the demon of  covetousness. Here we have an instance, more or less conscious, of the  tendency, so marked in Jewish literature, to parable. But the form of  the parable bears striking testimony to its origin in a myth common to  many races. The keys in particular probably indicate that the recompense  at one time took the shape of a palladium. This is not at all uncommon  in the tales. The Countess Von Ranzau was once summoned from her castle  of Breitenburg in Schleswig to the help of a dwarf-woman, and in return  received, according to one account, a large piece of gold to be made  into fifty counters, a herring and two spindles, upon the preservation  of which the fortunes of the family were to depend. The gifts are  variously stated in different versions of the tale, but all the versions  agree in attaching to them blessings on the noble house of Ranzau so  long as they were kept in the family. The Frau Von Hahnen, in a Bohemian  legend, receives for her services to a water-nix three pieces of gold,  with the injunction to take care of them, and never to let them go out  of the hands of her own lineage, else the whole family would fall into  poverty. She bequeathed the treasures to her three sons; but the  youngest son took a wife, who with a light heart gave the fairy gold  away. Misery, of course, resulted from her folly; and the race of Hahnen  speedily came to an end.[31]    It is quite possible that the spoons bestowed by Vitra upon the  clergyman's wife in Lappmark were once reputed to be the subject of a  similar proviso. So common, forsooth, was the stipulation, that in one  way or other it was annexed to well-nigh all fairy gifts: they brought  luck to their possessor for the time being. Examples of this are  endless: one only will content us in this connection; and, like Vitra's  gift, we shall find it in Swedish Lappmark. A peasant who had one day  been unlucky at the chase, was returning disgusted, when he met a fine  gentleman who begged him to come and cure his wife. The peasant  protested in vain that he was not a doctor. The other would take no  denial, insisting that it was no matter, for if he would only put his  hands upon the lady she would be healed. Accordingly the stranger led  him to the very top of a mountain, where was perched a castle he had  never seen before. On entering it he found the walls were mirrors, the  roof overhead of silver, the carpets of gold-embroidered silk, and the  furniture of the purest gold and jewels. The stranger took him into a  room where lay the loveliest of princesses on a golden bed, screaming  with pain. As soon as she saw the peasant she begged him to come and put  his hands upon her. Almost stupefied with astonishment he hesitated to  lay his coarse hands upon so fair a dame. But at length he yielded; and  in a moment her pain ceased, and she was made whole. She stood up and  thanked him, begging him to tarry awhile and eat with them. This,  however, he declined to do, for he feared that if he tasted the food  which was offered him he must remain there. The stranger whom he had  followed then took a leathern purse, filled it with small round pieces  of wood, and gave it to the peasant with these words: \"So long as thou  art in possession of this purse money will never fail thee. But if thou  shouldst ever see me again, beware of speaking to me; for if thou speak  thy luck will depart.\" When the man got home he found the purse filled  with dollars; and by virtue of its magical property he became the  richest man in the parish. As soon as he found the purse always full,  whatever he took out of it, he began to live in a spendthrift manner  and frequented the alehouse. One evening as he sat there he beheld the  stranger with a bottle in his hand going round and gathering the drops  which the guests shook from time to time out of their glasses. The rich  peasant was surprised that one who had given him so much did not seem  able to buy himself a single dram, but was reduced to this means of  getting a drink. Thereupon he went up to him and said: \"Thou hast shown  me more kindness than any other man ever did, and I will willingly treat  thee to a little.\" The words were scarce out of his mouth when he  received such a blow on his head that he fell stunned to the ground; and  when again he came to himself the stranger and his purse were both gone.  From that day forward he became poorer and poorer, until he was reduced  to absolute beggary.[32]    This story exemplifies every point that had had interested us in this  discussion: the need of the Trolls for human help, the refusal of food,  fairy gratitude, and the conditions involved in the acceptance of  supernatural gifts. It mentions one further characteristic of fairy  nature--the objection to be recognized and addressed by men who are  privileged to see them. But the consideration of this requires another  chapter.      FOOTNOTES:    [15] \"Y Cymmrodor,\" vol. v. p. 70, translated from \"Y Brython,\" vol. iv.  p. 251.

Before we quit the subject of fairy births, we have a few more stories  to discuss. They resemble in their general tenor those already noticed;  but instead of one or other of the incidents considered in the previous  chapter we are led to a different catastrophe by the introduction of a  new incident--that of the Magical Ointment. The plot no longer hinges  upon fairy gratitude, but upon human curiosity and disobedience.    The typical tale is told, and exceedingly well told--though, alas! not  exactly in the language of the natives--by Mrs. Bray in her Letters to  Southey, of a certain midwife of Tavistock. One midnight, as she was  getting into bed, this good woman was summoned by a strange,  squint-eyed, little, ugly old fellow to follow him straightway, and  attend upon his wife. In spite of her instinctive repulsion she could  not resist the command; and in a moment the little man whisked her, with  himself, upon a large coal-black horse with eyes of fire, which stood  waiting at the door. Ere long she found herself at the door of a neat  cottage; the patient was a decent-looking woman who already had"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24616"],[0,"Bell's Cathedrals: Southwark Cathedral (#12)"],[1,"is known to have lived near the old Bear Garden  and his own theatre, \"The Globe,\" in Southwark, where his brother  Edmund also lived while trying his fortune on the stage. The immortal  name has, therefore, a direct association with St. Saviour's Church  and parish, entitling it to the special memorial.    The =Choir= was erected by Peter de Rupibus in the early part of the  thirteenth century. In its more mature and elaborate work it shows a  considerable advance on the simplest form of Early English, though the  apparently low elevation, and massiveness of the piers and lower  arcading, are obviously not free from Norman influences. It is divided  into five bays by alternate circular and octagonal piers, the dwarfed  appearance of which is relieved by triple vaulting shafts on the north  and south sides, and single shafts to support the arch mouldings. The  central shafts are not of Purbeck, as in the nave, and they are not  banded, except where crossed by the abacus moulding of the capitals  and the triforium string-course. The piers have all plain capitals and  well cut base mouldings. The triforium arcade, like that in the nave,  consists of four arched openings in each bay, and, unlike the  clerestory, has no continuous passage along the choir wall. Each bay,  however, has an opening at the back into the space between the vault  and roof of the aisle.    While both sides of the choir are alike in their main features, there  is an interesting difference in detail, especially to be noticed in  the greater simplicity of the south side, where the triforium capitals  are less elaborate, and the dog-tooth ornament is omitted from the  outer jambs of the openings.    On the south side, moreover, the arches have corbels, with sculptured  heads, to support their inner mouldings, in place of the full-length  shafts which occur on the responds at the ends, and on all the piers  of the opposite side. These differences, though perhaps partly  referable to the delightful vagaries of Gothic architecture, are  supposed to have a special significance at St. Saviour's, where the  north was the side of the Prior.       [Illustration: _Photo._     _G.P. Heisch._     THE CHOIR AND ALTAR SCREEN.]    The roof is not strictly original, most of it having been rebuilt in  1822-1824, when, however, the old material was worked in again as far  as possible, and the old quadripartite groining adhered to. It may be  noticed that the vaulting is carried out very systematically and  correctly, the only defect being that the wall-ribs die into the  vaulting surfaces, instead of being brought down to the clerestory  sill. The plough-share surfaces (as they are called) are nevertheless  well cut back to concentrate the lateral pressures against the  external buttresses. In the nave the new vaulting has the wall-ribs  properly supported by light shafts in the angles of the clerestory  openings, whilst in the transepts the inner archivolt of the windows  answers the same purpose.       [Illustration: _Photo._     _G.P. Heisch._     THE TRIFORIUM AND CLERESTORY OF THE CHOIR.]    It is highly probable that the choir formerly extended to the western  side of the tower, as indicated by the step between the nave and tower  pavement.    The =Altar-platform=, though raised seven steps above the nave  pavement, gives the altar a rather low elevation as compared with the  lofty Continental altars, whether abroad, or introduced here in recent  years on the Continental example. Herein it exhibits a peculiarity of  the English use, as illustrated in many pre-Reformation churches,  where the occasional deviations from rule can generally be accounted  for by the lofty crypt beneath, as, _e.g._, at Canterbury.[26]    Behind the altar rises the magnificent =Screen=, erected by Bishop Fox  in 1520, which almost fills the eastern end of the choir. This fine  work had been more or less mutilated through the iconoclastic zeal of  ultra-reformers, who deprived it of the sculptured figures in the  niches. It was further ill-treated during the architectural supremacy  of Sir Christopher Wren and his school, when the smaller canopies and  other projections were pared off to make a level surface for the  classical piece of woodwork placed in front of it. When this  incongruous structure was removed and the restoration taken in hand  (in 1833) by Mr. Wallace, liberties were again taken with the  unfortunate screen, more or less spoiling the design, though  undertaken on a good motive. Perhaps the least objectionable of these  innovations was the insertion of panels for the Creed, Lord's Prayer,  and Ten Commandments, in perpetuation of those in the wooden  altar-piece, where the formulae had been set up in the spirit of the  Injunctions of 1536 and 1538. Above the stages Mr. Wallace introduced  rows of angels, the highest row being surmounted by a cornice of  strawberry-leaf ornament for which there was no sort of precedent,  either in the original work here, or in other altar-screens of similar  character elsewhere.[27]    The screen is about thirty feet in height, and extends to the main  arcades on either side. Three tiers of canopied niches, ten in each  tier, divided down the centre by a perpendicular series of three  larger niches, all occupied by statues, made up a composition which  was at once \"a thing of beauty\" and an object lesson on the  Incarnation. The total number of niches (thirty-three) suggested a  mystic reference to the years of our Lord's earthly life, while the  image of the Pelican \"in her piety,\" here and there, besides being a  reminder of Bishop Fox (whose peculiar device it was), also typified  the sacrament of the altar. The original materials of which the screen  was built are quoted as \"Caen and fire-stone,\" for which Mr. Wallace  substituted stone from Painswick in Gloucestershire, as more easily  obtained and agreeing in colour with the old work.[28]    Above the altar the first architect had left a vacant panel (square)  possibly intending it for the reception of sculpture or mosaic. This  space, as well as some of the side panelling, was covered by the  Decalogue, etc., before mentioned. The space is now vacant, pending  the complete restoration of the screen, and is simply concealed by the  dorsal and lateral curtains. The doors on each side will be noticed,  with their depressed ogee headings, which indicate that this screen is  of somewhat later date than the corresponding one (also by Bishop Fox)  at Winchester. Another indication to the same effect has been detected  in the grotesque carvings in the spandrels, which are here of a  humorous character, whereas at Winchester the minor decorations are  entirely sacred, _e.g._, the Annunciation and Visitation.    On the north side of the choir, in the easternmost arch, is the  =Monument of Richard Humble=, erected by his son Peter in 1616. He  quotes his father in the inscription as \"Alderman of London,\" which is  supposed to be inaccurate, as the prospective alderman, though  represented in the official gown, is said to have declined office for  political reasons. The monument is a good specimen of the Jacobean  style. Under an arched canopy, supported by Ionic pillars, Richard  Humble is kneeling at a small altar, or _prie-Dieu_, with his two  wives behind him, the second wearing a conical hat, his sons and  daughters being represented in bas-relief on the north and south sides  of the basement. On the altar side there are also some verses, by an  unknown author, in which human life is compared to \"the damask rose  and blossom on the tree,\" with other images of its vanity and  shortness. There is a dash of Elizabethan vigour in the versification,  mixed with a certain quaintness which points to the decadence, and the  lines have been attributed to such different writers as Francis  Beaumont and Francis Quarles. The figures in the monument have been  \"beautified\" with imitations of marble and alabaster. The canopied  stalls for the Canons were erected as a memorial to Bishop Thorold,  from the diocese of Rochester, as notified on a plain brass tablet.    Those for the choir and cathedral officers were provided by an  anonymous benefactor. The absence of \"return stalls\" is accounted for  by the fact that St. Saviour's is a parish church as well as a  cathedral, for which reason it is desired to keep the choir as open as  possible.       [Illustration: _Photo._     _G.P. Heisch._     THE ALTAR AND THE HUMBLE MONUMENT.]    It may be here mentioned that the twelve boys who sing at the daily  services are known as \"the Wigan Chanters,\" after Sir Frederick Wigan,  Bart., who has made provision for their salary, and the silver badges  to be worn by them on Sundays and holy days. The badges are engraved  on the face with the priory arms--\"Argent, a cross fusilly gules: in  the dexter chief, a cinquefoil gules\"--with an inscription on the  reverse.    The low wrought-iron chancel-railing was presented by Mr. Barclay;  the holy table (a classical wooden structure), by Mr. J.F. France, in  place of the former table, also of classical design, which has been  transferred to the retro-choir. The chalice and paten, crosses, vases,  books, embroidery, etc., have been bestowed from time to time by  various friends and worshippers.       [Illustration: _Photo._     _G.P. Heisch._     THE LADY CHAPEL OR RETRO-CHOIR.]    The =Retro-choir= (now known as the =Lady Chapel=) was erected by  Peter de Rupibus at about the same time as the choir, but in a much  lighter and more graceful fashion, which places it among the best  examples of Early English architecture in the country. The groined  vault rests on six slender pillars, with detached shafts. The  divisions thus formed make up twelve compartments of nearly equal  size. Perhaps the best general prospect is to be obtained from the  south-east corner, which takes in the whole length of the chapel, with  the altar, now on the north, and the tomb"]]]
