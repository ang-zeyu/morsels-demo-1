This explains why, in some later palaces, slabs  were found with their sculptured face turned to the crude brick wall,  and the other smoothed and prepared for the artist, or with the  sculptures half erased, or piled up against the wall, ready to be put in  place. The nature of the injuries which caused the ancient buildings to  decay and lose all shape, is very faithfully described in an inscription  of the Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar, in which he relates how he  constructed the Ziggurat of Borsip on the site of an ancient  construction, which he repaired, as far as it went. This is what he  says: \"The temple of the Seven Spheres, the Tower of Borsip which a  former king had built ... but had not finished its upper part, from  remote days had fallen into decay. The channels for drawing off the  water had not been properly provided; rain and tempest had washed away  its bricks; the bricks of the roof were cracked; the bricks of the  building were washed away into heaps of rubbish.\" All this sufficiently  accounts for the peculiar aspect offered by the Mesopotamian ruins.  Whatever process of destruction the buildings underwent, whether natural  or violent, by conquerors' hands, whether through exposure to fire or to  stress of weather, the upper part would be the first to suffer, but it  would not disappear, from the nature of the material, which is not  combustible. The crude bricks all through the enormous thickness of the  walls, once thoroughly loosened, dislodged, dried up or soaked  through, would lose their consistency and tumble down into the courts  and halls, choking them up with the soft rubbish into which they  crumbled, the surplus rolling down the sides and forming those even  slopes which, from a distance, so deceivingly imitate natural hills.  Time, accumulating the drift-sand from the desert and particles of  fertile earth, does the rest, and clothes the mounds with the verdant  and flowery garment which is the delight of the Arab's eyes.    [Illustration: 26.--WINGED LION WITH HUMAN HEAD. (Perrot and Chipiez.)]    19. It is to this mode of destruction the Assyrian kings allude in their  annals by the continually recurring phrase: \"I destroyed their cities, I  overwhelmed them, I burned them in the fire, _I made heaps of them_.\"  However difficult it is to get at the treasures imbedded in these  \"heaps,\" we ought not to repine at the labor, since they owe their  preservation entirely to the soft masses of earth, sand and loose  rubbish which have protected them on all sides from the contact with  air, rain and ignorant plunderers, keeping them as safely--if not as  transparently--housed as a walnut in its lump of candied sugar. The  explorers know this so well, that when they leave the ruins, after  completing their work for the time, they make it a point to fill all the  excavated spaces with the very rubbish that has been taken out of them  at the cost of so much labor and time. There is something impressive and  reverent in thus re-burying the relics of those dead ages and nations,  whom the mysterious gloom of their self-erected tombs becomes better  than the glare of the broad, curious daylight. When Layard, before his  departure, after once more wandering with some friends through all the  trenches, tunnels and passages of the Nimrud mound, to gaze for the last  time on the wonders on which no man had looked before him, found himself  once more on the naked platform and ordered the workmen to cover them up  again, he was strongly moved by the contrast: \"We look around in vain,\"  says he, \"for any traces of the wonderful remains we have just seen, and  are half inclined to believe that we have dreamed a dream, or have been  listening to some tale of Eastern romance. Some, who may hereafter  tread on the spot when the grass again grows over the Assyrian palaces,  may indeed suspect that I have been relating a vision.\"    [Illustration: 27.--WINGED BULL. (Perrot and Chipiez.)]    20. It is a curious fact that in Assyria the ruins speak to us only of  the living, and that of the dead there are no traces whatever. One might  think people never died there at all. Yet it is well known that all  nations have bestowed as much care on the interment of their dead and  the adornment of their last resting-place as on the construction of  their dwellings--nay, some even more, for instance, the Egyptians. To  this loving veneration for the dead history owes half its discoveries;  indeed we should have almost no reliable information at all on the very  oldest races, who lived before the invention of writing, were it not for  their tombs and the things we find in them. It is very strange,  therefore, that nothing of the kind should be found in Assyria, a  country which stood so high in culture. For the sepulchres which are  found in such numbers in some mounds down to a certain depth, belong, as  is shown by their very position, to later races, mostly even to the  modern Turks and Arabs. This peculiarity is so puzzling that scholars  almost incline to suppose that the Assyrians either made away with their  dead in some manner unknown to us, or else took them somewhere to bury.  The latter conjecture, though not entirely devoid of foundation, as we  shall see, is unsupported by any positive facts, and therefore was never  seriously discussed. The question is simply left open, until something  happens to shed light on it.    [Illustration: 28.--MAN-LION. (Perrot and Chipiez.)]    21. It is just the contrary in Babylonia. It can boast few handsome  ruins or sculptures. The platforms and main walls of many palaces and  temples have been known from the names stamped on the bricks and the  cylinders found in the foundations, but they present only shapeless  masses, from which all traces of artistic work have disappeared. In  compensation, there is no country in the world where so many and such  vast cemeteries have been discovered. It appears that the land of  Chaldea,--perhaps because it was the cradle of nations which afterwards  grew to greatness, as the Assyrians and the Hebrews--was regarded as a  place of peculiar holiness by its own inhabitants, and probably also by  neighboring countries, which would explain the mania that seems to have  prevailed through so many ages, for burying the dead there in unheard of  numbers. Strangely enough, some portions of it even now are held sacred  in the same sense. There are shrines in Kerbela and Nedjif (somewhat to  the west of Babylon) where every caravan of pilgrims brings from Persia  hundreds of dead bodies in their felt-covered coffins, for burial. They  are brought on camels and horses. On each side of the animal swings a  coffin, unceremoniously thumped by the rider's bare heels. These coffins  are, like merchandise, unladen for the night--and sometimes for days  too--in the khans or caravanseries (the enclosed halting-places), where  men and beasts take their rest together. Under that tropical clime, it  is easy to imagine the results. It is in part to this disgusting custom  that the great mortality in the caravans is to be attributed, one fifth  of which leave their bones in the desert in _healthy_ seasons. However  that may be, the gigantic proportions of the Chaldean burying-grounds  struck even the ancient Greek travellers with astonishment, and some of  them positively asserted that the Assyrian kings used to be buried in  Chaldea. If the kings, why not the nobler and wealthier of their  subjects? The transport down the rivers presented no difficulties.  Still, as already remarked, all this is mere conjecture.    [Illustration: 29.--FRAGMENT OF ENAMELLED BRICK. (Perrot and Chipiez.)]    22. Among the Chaldeans cities ERECH (now WARKA) was considered from  very old times one of the holiest. It had many extremely ancient temples  and a college of learned priests, and around it gradually formed an  immense \"city of the dead\" or Necropolis. The English explorer, Loftus,  in 1854-5, specially turned his attention to it and his account is  astounding. First of all, he was struck by the majestic desolation of  the place. Warka and a few other mounds are raised on a slightly  elevated tract of the desert, above the level of the yearly inundations,  and accessible only from November to March, as all the rest of the time  the surrounding plain is either a lake or a swamp. \"The desolation and  solitude of Warka,\" says Loftus, \"are even more striking than the scene  which is presented at Babylon itself. There is no life for miles around.  No river glides in grandeur at the base of its mounds; no green date  groves flourish near its ruins. The jackal and the hyaena appear to shun  the dull aspect of its tombs. The king of birds never hovers over the  deserted waste. A blade of grass or an insect finds no existence there.  The shrivelled lichen alone, clinging to the weathered surface of the  broken brick, seems to glory in its universal dominion over those barren  walls. Of all the desolate pictures I have ever seen that of Warka  incomparably surpasses all.\" Surely in this case it cannot be said that  appearances are deceitful; for all that space, and much more, is a  cemetery, and what a cemetery! \"It is difficult,\" again says Loftus, \"to  convey anything like a correct idea of the piles upon piles of human  remains which there utterly astound the beholder. Excepting only the  triangular space between the three principal ruins, the whole remainder  of the platform, the whole space between the walls and an unknown extent  of desert beyond them, are everywhere filled with the bones and  sepulchres of the dead. There is probably no other site in the world  which can compare with Warka in this respect.\" It must be added that the  coffins do not simply lie one next to the other, but in layers, down to  a depth of 30-60 feet. Different epochs show different modes of burial,  among which the following four are"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24676"],[0,"Peeps at Many Lands: Norway (#12)"],[1,"well as a change of conveyance and horses. The _skydsgut_ (literally  post-boy, but frequently an old man, or even a woman), accompanies  the conveyance from his station to the next, and returns with it,  though nowadays it is more usual to engage a vehicle (if not also a  horse or pony) for a whole day's journey, which has the advantage of  avoiding the perpetual rearrangement of one's luggage.    There are four kinds of conveyance in general use: the _caleche_, drawn  by a pair of horses, and something like a heavily-built victoria;  the _trille_, a light, four-wheeled trap with two horses; and the  _stolkjaerre_ and the _carriole_, the last two being the most popular  and convenient vehicles for quick travelling.    The _stolkjaerre_ is a rough, box-like cart, with a seat for two  persons, and another little seat behind for the _skydsgut_. It has  the advantages of ample room for luggage, and economy when travelling  two together, the hire of one _stolkjaerre_ being less than that of two  _carrioles_; but, having no springs, it jolts and jars its occupants  most unmercifully.    The _carriole_ may be considered to be the national vehicle of Norway,  and is certainly the most comfortable. In appearance it resembles a  miniature buggy, and it holds one person, who can stretch his legs  in a long, narrow trough between the seat and the splash-board;  or, by straddling the trough, the occupant can rest his feet on two  conveniently-placed iron steps. The luggage is strapped on to a board  behind, and the _skydsgut_ sits on it. A day's drive in a _carriole_,  if the weather be fine and the pony a good one, is a real pleasure,  and an intelligent _skydsgut_ will enliven the journey with his  amusing babble, as well as with scraps of information about the  country traversed.    The ponies are generally about thirteen hands in height, good-tempered,  sure-footed, strong, and hardy, and think nothing of doing thirty or  forty miles a day, if given an occasional rest. Driving them requires  no great skill, and it is best to leave them as much as possible to  their own devices, since reins and bit have very little influence  over their movements. One may haul on to the reins for half an hour  without inducing the pony to pull up, but the magic sound of the  \"burr-r-r\" uttered by the _skydsgut_ will cause the little beast to  stop dead. And he will not go on again until he hears the peculiar  click of his master's tongue. So the stranger in the _carriole_  or _stolkjaerre_ will do well to hold the reins for the sake of  appearances, and allow his _skydsgut_ to do the rest.    One word of comfort to the adventurous driver: Do not be alarmed  if you notice that the harness is dropping to pieces. Your henchman  (up behind) will soon put matters right with some scraps of string  and a few bits of stick.    But the actual drive--how lovely it all is! Now you are passing up a  valley among the hayfields and orchards which border the river, and  by the roadside you find a profusion of wild flowers--great purple  gentians, blue harebells, yellow mountain globe flowers, and other  blossoms of varied colours. Butterflies there are also in abundance,  and, if you be an entomologist, your heart will rejoice at the sight of  such rare English insects as the Camberwell Beauty, the Northern Brown,  and others. Now you enter a dark pine-forest, to find yourself before  long emerging on to an open stretch of wild moorland; and so you cross  the col, and commence to drop down into another valley, narrow and  shut in by towering mountains. Waterfalls sparkle in the sun as they  tumble over the cliffs, and the still unmelted snow stands out white  and glistering on the distant hill-tops. The road swings from side to  side of the valley, crossing the torrent in its bottom by stout timber  bridges, and at last you reach the margin of the great lake, where  stands the neat little inn ready to provide you with your midday meal.    The organized tours, however short they be, always include a drive of  this description, and no Englishman would consider that he had visited  Norway unless he had driven through a part of the country. Even in  a week one can cover a deal of ground. One can go by steamer from  Bergen up the Hardanger Fjord to Eide, and thence drive across the  neck of land to the Sogne Fjord, through the finest and most varied  scenery imaginable, returning to Bergen, if needs be, by steamer down  the Sogne Fjord. Or, if there be a few days to spare, one can steam  across the head of the Sogne Fjord from Gudvangen to Laerdalsoeren, and  thence again take _carriole_ or _stolkjaerre_ to the Fillefjeld, and so  visit the wildest of Norway's mountain districts, the Jotunheim--the  Home of the Giants.            CHAPTER XIV    ARCTIC DAYS AND NIGHTS      Everyone has read of the midnight sun and of the sunless winter of the  North. They are features of all tales of Arctic exploration. Yet, in  order to see the sun shining at midnight or to experience pitch-dark  days, it is not necessary to be actually a seeker after the North  Pole. Sunny nights and black winter days may be enjoyed, or otherwise,  even in Norway, but only in the Far North--within the Arctic Circle.    It is not quite easy to realize what things are like right away up  in the North, as it were, on the top of the world, and why things  are as they are is difficult to explain without entering into a host  of scientific details. We will, therefore, avoid a long discussion  about the movements of the earth and suchlike matters, and merely  mention certain facts. At the North Pole itself there is continuous  day for six months of the year, and continuous night for the other  six months, while on the line known as the Arctic Circle the sun  shines at midnight once, and once only, in the year, and during one  entire day of twenty-four hours in the winter it does not rise above  the horizon at all. South of the Arctic Circle there is no such thing  as midnight sun or as a day without sunrise.    As far as Norway is concerned, a considerable tract of country lies  within the Arctic Circle--in fact, an area rather larger than that  of Ireland--so it is not very difficult to find a place where the  midnight sun can be seen for a period in the summer-time, and where  in the winter some of the days are really dark. Of course, to see  the midnight sun it is necessary to be at the place selected at the  right time, and even then there is always the chance of the sky being  clouded over, and no sun visible. For the latter reason travellers  with plenty of leisure endeavour to go as far North as possible,  so as to be almost certain of seeing the great sight.    Nowadays everything is made easy for everybody, and steamers take  passengers to the North Cape throughout the summer for the sole purpose  of enabling them to see the midnight sun from the very best point  of view. Here, provided that the sky is clear, the midnight sun can  be seen from May 13 to July 31. Between those dates it does not set,  and it would be a bad summer indeed if the clouds hid the sun for so  long a time.    To reach the North Cape takes a good deal of time, and many people  dislike a lengthy sea voyage; but even if one starts from Bergen  and goes all the way by sea, there is something of interest to be  seen every day, as the steamer keeps close to the coast, threads its  way among the innumerable small islands, and calls at many places  with beautiful scenery in the background, more especially Molde and  Christiansund.    A little farther on you come to Trondhjem; but if you would curtail  the sea voyage it is not necessary to take the steamer from Bergen,  since Trondhjem can be reached by rail from Christiania or by a  driving tour right through the country from various places. Onwards  from Trondhjem, however, you must go by sea, unless you are prepared  for a long and rough overland journey.    Trondhjem, the ancient capital of Norway, is a place of historic  interest, and contains the finest cathedral in Scandinavia. Its  name means \"throne home,\" as the old Kings of Norway used to reside  there, and it was the place where the coronation ceremony was always  performed. Though no longer the capital of the country, it is still  a flourishing town, and the present King (Haakon VII.) was crowned  there a few years ago.    Now the real sea voyage to the North Cape commences, and with luck  you may reach your destination in five days, but on every one of the  five you will stop somewhere or see something which will be worth  seeing. The town of Namsos is of no great interest, but the coast and  island scenery now becomes stupendous and grand, with great giant  rocks rising up out of the sea. The most remarkable of these are  Torghatten and Hestmanden.    The peculiarity of Torghatten lies in the fact that there is a hole  or tunnel straight through the massive rock, which itself is some  800 feet in height. As you sail past it you see daylight through the  hole, and if you land to examine it you will find that it is nearly  200 yards from end to end, and that its almost perpendicular sides  vary in height from 60 feet at one end to four times that height at  the other end. No man can account for this remarkable tunnel except  by quoting the local legend, and in this the Hestmand (the other  extraordinary rocky island) is mixed up.    Hestmanden, the \"man on horseback,\" is a wonderful mass of rock,  the outline of which, allowing for a little imagination, resembles  a man on a horse. And this is the legend:    Not far from Torghatten is an island called Lekoe, on which, in the  age of the giants, there lived a beautiful maiden. In those days  the Hestmand was a real live giant, and he fell desperately in love  with the Lekoe maiden. But the latter, who was only half a giantess,  was afraid of the great monster, and would have nothing to do with  him. So the Hestmand flew into a rage, and one day chased"]]]
