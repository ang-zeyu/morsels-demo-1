Area 6 has a length of 200 feet, an average width of 50 feet, and a  maximum depth of one and one-half feet. This is a shallow, quiet pool  over bedrock bottom, except for a small area of mud bottom at one side  of the upper end of the pool. A short, steep, rubble-riffle is included  in this area at the upstream end (Pl. 30, Fig. 2).    Areas 2, 4, and 7 resemble at least one of the areas described above but  were sampled less intensively. Data from areas 2, 4, and 7 are included  in discussion of the total fauna of the upper Neosho river but are  excluded from the discussion of representative parts of that fauna.      Methods    _Rotenone_    Rotenone was applied to an intermittent pool in 1957. In 1958 and 1959  rotenone was applied to the upper end of a pool and mixed by agitating  the water. The concentration in the pool was maintained by slowly  introducing part of the rotenone into the riffle at the head of the  pool. This was the most effective means of obtaining a large sample of  fish from the deeper, slowly flowing water of the upper Neosho. Pools in  which rotenone was used had areas of as much as one-half acre and depths  in excess of six feet.      _Shocker_    In 1959 the shocker was used extensively in several areas of the upper  Neosho. Because of the small size of the stream, \"tennis-racket\"  electrodes were used effectively by two men--one carrying the electrodes  and one picking up fish and placing them in a live-box. In fast water,  many fish floated into a seine placed across the lower end of the area.  A large segment of the population was collected in this manner. Areas in  which fish were collected by means of the shocker included riffles, and  pools having flowing water no more than three feet in maximum depth. The  bottom-type was usually gravel, rubble or bedrock, but a small amount of  mud bottom was present in many pools.    Because of the necessity of wading, we could not use the shocker  effectively in water more than three feet deep. In addition, turbidity  of the water prevented effective collection of stunned fish in the  deeper pools. Therefore, rotenone was more effective in deep water than  was the shocker. In shallow, swift riffles and pools, the shocker  yielded more reliable samples than did rotenone, because of difficulty  in maintaining adequate concentrations of rotenone where flow was swift.    The relative abundance of each species in the upper Neosho was  calculated from cumulative results obtained by use of the shocker in  seven areas in 1959. Population estimates were made by collecting fish  with the shocker, marking them by clipping fins or staining them in  Bismark Brown Y at a concentration of 1:20,000 (Deacon, 1961), returning  them to the stream, and making a second collection three hours (Areas 1  and 3) or 24 hours (Area 6) later. The same area was shocked again  within two to eight days. Collections throughout the one-half-mile  section yielded information on movement.      Changes in the Fauna at the Upper Neosho Station, 1957 Through 1959.    The following discussion is based principally on collections made with  rotenone in 1957, 1958 and 1959 (Table 12). Other supplementary data aid  in understanding the changes that occurred after the resumption of  normal flow at the upper Neosho station.    The population in 1957 was strongly dominated by black bullhead and  young-of-the-year channel catfish. Other common species were long-eared  sunfish, red shiner, yellow bullhead, orange-spotted sunfish and green  sunfish. This fauna, with the exception of young-of-the-year  individuals, was a fauna produced during the years of drought. Deacon  and Metcalf (1961:318-321) found a similar fauna in streams of the  Wakarusa River Basin that had been seriously affected by drought.    The black bullheads taken in 1957 were predominately yearlings. It is  likely that by 1956 the total fish population in the upper Neosho had  been decimated by drought. The ponded conditions prevalent in that year  were conducive to production and survival of young black bullheads. Fig.  3 shows that this dominant 1956 year-class reached an average length of  approximately 6.5 inches by August, 1959.    Reproduction by black bullheads was limited in 1957, 1958, and 1959, and  slight reduction in relative abundance occurred from 1957 to 1958. The  relative abundance in 1959 remained nearly stable. If stream-flow  remains essentially continuous for the next few years, the number of  black bullheads probably will decline as individuals of the 1956  year-class reach the end of their life-span.    Reference has been made to the large hatch of channel catfish in 1957,  in a discussion of that species. Conditions for survival of young  channel catfish at the upper Neosho station in 1957 were good because  there was continuous flow over many gravel-rubble riffles, which were  largely unoccupied by other fish, in the spring and summer of 1957.

Channel catfish also showed a slight decline in relative abundance after  1957, resulting from mortality in the 1957 year-class. With continuous  flow, channel catfish will probably remain abundant, although annual  reproductive success probably will be less than in 1957.    The big-mouthed buffalo, small-mouthed buffalo, creek chub and  orange-throated darter were not taken in 1957, but appeared in  collections in 1958. The river carpsucker, golden redhorse, red shiner,  fat-headed minnow, stoneroller, stonecat, and slender-headed darter also  increased in abundance between 1957 and 1959. The increased abundance of  all these species in 1958 and 1959 resulted in a more diversified fauna,  with lesser predominance by any single species, than in 1957 (Table 12);  this change is related to the increased, permanent flow in 1958 and  1959.      Local Variability of the Fauna in Different Areas at the Upper Neosho  Station, 1959    The shallow areas in which the shocker was used in 1959 are the  prevalent habitat in the upper Neosho River. The relative abundance of  fishes found in these areas is presented in Table 13. The red shiner was  most abundant and was followed (in decreasing order) by long-eared  sunfish, minnows of the genus _Pimephales_, green sunfish, red-finned  shiner, channel catfish, and stoneroller. Other species combined  comprise less than ten per cent of the population.    Table 13 also shows the variability in relative abundance of different  species among areas that have the same general kind of habitat. The  species composition is similar in all areas. The sample obtained with  rotenone in 1959 is included in Table 13 to show differences in the  fauna of deep, slowly flowing areas and shallower areas with stronger  current. The differences in relative abundance indicate the kind of  habitat that each species is able to utilize most fully.    Golden redhorse and black bullhead were most abundant in large, deep,  quiet pools (5.7 per cent and 32 per cent of the total population)  and were more abundant in Area 5 (3.2 per cent and 7.3 per cent  respectively) than in any of the other shallow areas. Area 5 has greater  average depth, more mud bottom, and less riffle area than areas 1, 3 and  6.    The golden redhorse and black bullhead have specific habitat preferences  that are not evident in the above discussion. My collections indicate  that the golden redhorse prefers deep water having some current, whereas  the black bullhead prefers little or no current.    Species that prevailed in or near riffles were: creek chub,  sucker-mouthed minnow, stoneroller, channel catfish (young-of-the-year  only), flathead (young-of-the-year only), stonecat, slender-headed  darter, and orange-throated darter.

(ll. 727-732) Do not stand upright facing the sun when you make water,  but remember to do this when he has set towards his rising. And do not  make water as you go, whether on the road or off the road, and do not  uncover yourself: the nights belong to the blessed gods. A scrupulous  man who has a wise heart sits down or goes to the wall of an enclosed  court.    (ll. 733-736) Do not expose yourself befouled by the fireside in your  house, but avoid this. Do not beget children when you are come back from  ill-omened burial, but after a festival of the gods.    (ll. 737-741) Never cross the sweet-flowing water of ever-rolling rivers  afoot until you have prayed, gazing into the soft flood, and washed your  hands in the clear, lovely water. Whoever crosses a river with hands  unwashed of wickedness, the gods are angry with him and bring trouble  upon him afterwards.    (ll. 742-743) At a cheerful festival of the gods do not cut the withered  from the quick upon that which has five branches [1338] with bright  steel.    (ll. 744-745) Never put the ladle upon the mixing-bowl at a wine party,  for malignant ill-luck is attached to that.    (ll. 746-747) When you are building a house, do not leave it rough-hewn,  or a cawing crow may settle on it and croak.    (ll. 748-749) Take nothing to eat or to wash with from uncharmed pots,  for in them there is mischief.    (ll. 750-759) Do not let a boy of twelve years sit on things which may  not be moved [1339], for that is bad, and makes a man unmanly; nor yet  a child of twelve months, for that has the same effect. A man should  not clean his body with water in which a woman has washed, for there is  bitter mischief in that also for a time. When you come upon a burning  sacrifice, do not make a mock of mysteries, for Heaven is angry at this  also. Never make water in the mouths of rivers which flow to the sea,  nor yet in springs; but be careful to avoid this. And do not ease  yourself in them: it is not well to do this.    (ll. 760-763) So do: and avoid the talk of men. For Talk is mischievous,  light, and easily raised, but hard to bear and difficult to be rid of.  Talk never wholly dies away when many people voice her: even Talk is in  some ways divine.    (ll. 765-767) Mark the days which come from Zeus, duly telling your  slaves of them, and that the thirtieth day of the month is best for one  to look over the work and to deal out supplies.    (ll. 769-768) [1340] For these are days which come from Zeus the  all-wise, when men discern aright.    (ll. 770-779) To begin with, the first, the fourth, and the seventh--on  which Leto bare Apollo with the blade of gold--each is a holy day. The  eighth and the ninth, two days at least of the waxing month [1341], are  specially good for the works of man. Also the eleventh and twelfth are  both excellent, alike for shearing sheep and for reaping the kindly  fruits; but the twelfth is much better than the eleventh, for on it the  airy-swinging spider spins its web in full day, and then the Wise One  [1342], gathers her pile. On that day woman should set up her loom and  get forward with her work.    (ll. 780-781) Avoid the thirteenth of the waxing month for beginning to  sow: yet it is the best day for setting plants.    (ll. 782-789) The sixth of the mid-month is very unfavourable for  plants, but is good for the birth of males, though unfavourable for a  girl either to be born at all or to be married. Nor is the first sixth  a fit day for a girl to be born, but a kindly for gelding kids and sheep  and for fencing in a sheep-cote. It is favourable for the birth of a  boy, but such will be fond of sharp speech, lies, and cunning words, and  stealthy converse.    (ll. 790-791) On the eighth of the month geld the boar and  loud-bellowing bull, but hard-working mules on the twelfth.    (ll. 792-799) On the great twentieth, in full day, a wise man should be  born. Such an one is very sound-witted. The tenth is favourable for a  male to be born; but, for a girl, the fourth day of the mid-month. On  that day tame sheep and shambling, horned oxen, and the sharp-fanged  dog and hardy mules to the touch of the hand. But take care to avoid  troubles which eat out the heart on the fourth of the beginning and  ending of the month; it is a day very fraught with fate.    (ll. 800-801) On the fourth of the month bring home your bride, but  choose the omens which are best for this business.    (ll. 802-804) Avoid fifth days: they are unkindly and terrible. On a  fifth day, they say, the Erinyes assisted at the birth of Horcus (Oath)  whom Eris (Strife) bare to trouble the forsworn. {[0-9]} (ll. 805-809)  Look about you very carefully and throw out Demeter's holy grain upon  the well-rolled [1343] threshing floor on the seventh of the mid-month.  Let the woodman cut beams for house building and plenty of ships'  timbers, such as are suitable for ships. On the fourth day begin to  build narrow ships.    (ll. 810-813) The ninth of the mid-month improves towards evening; but  the first ninth of all is quite harmless for men. It is a good day on  which to beget or to be born both for a male and a female: it is never  an wholly evil day.    (ll. 814-818) Again, few know that the twenty-seventh of the month is  best for opening a wine-jar, and putting yokes on the necks of oxen  and mules and swift-footed horses, and for hauling a swift ship of many  thwarts down to the sparkling sea; few call it by its right name.    (ll. 819-821) On the fourth day open a jar. The fourth of the mid-month  is a day holy above all. And again, few men know that the fourth day  after the twentieth is best while it is morning: towards evening it is  less good.    (ll. 822-828) These days are a great blessing to men on earth; but the  rest are changeable, luckless, and bring nothing. Everyone praises  a different day but few know their nature. Sometimes a day is a  stepmother, sometimes a mother. That man is happy and lucky in them who  knows all these things and does his work without offending the deathless  gods, who discerns the omens of birds and avoids transgressions.          THE DIVINATION BY BIRDS (fragments)    Proclus on Works and Days, 828: Some make the \"Divination by Birds\",  which Apollonius of Rhodes rejects as spurious, follow this verse  (\"Works and Days\", 828).          THE ASTRONOMY (fragments)    Fragment #1--Athenaeus xi, p. 491 d: And the author of \"The Astronomy\",  which is attributed forsooth to Hesiod, always calls them (the Pleiades)  Peleiades: 'but mortals call them Peleiades'; and again, 'the stormy  Peleiades go down'; and again, 'then the Peleiades hide away....'    Scholiast on Pindar, Nem. ii. 16: The Pleiades.... whose stars are  these:--'Lovely Teygata, and dark-faced Electra, and Alcyone, and  bright Asterope, and Celaeno, and Maia, and Merope, whom glorious Atlas  begot....' ((LACUNA)) 'In the mountains of Cyllene she (Maia) bare  Hermes, the herald of the gods.'      Fragment #2--Scholiast on Aratus 254: But Zeus made them (the sisters of  Hyas) into the stars which are called Hyades. Hesiod in his Book about  Stars tells us their names as follows: 'Nymphs like the Graces [1401],  Phaesyle and Coronis and rich-crowned Cleeia and lovely Phaco and  long-robed Eudora, whom the tribes of men upon the earth call Hyades.'      Fragment #3--Pseudo-Eratosthenes Catast. frag. 1: [1402] The Great  Bear.]--Hesiod says she (Callisto) was the daughter of Lycaon and  lived in Arcadia. She chose to occupy herself with wild-beasts in the  mountains together with Artemis, and, when she was seduced by Zeus,  continued some time undetected by the goddess, but afterwards, when she  was already with child, was seen by her bathing and so discovered. Upon  this, the goddess was enraged and changed her into a beast. Thus she  became a bear and gave birth to a son called Arcas. But while she was in  the mountains, she was hunted by some goat-herds and given up with  her babe to Lycaon. Some while after, she thought fit to go into the  forbidden precinct of Zeus, not knowing the law, and being pursued by  her own son and the Arcadians, was about to be killed because of the  said law; but Zeus delivered her because of her connection with him  and put her among the stars, giving her the name Bear because of the  misfortune which had befallen her.    Comm. Supplem. on Aratus, p. 547 M. 8: Of Bootes, also called the  Bear-warden. The story goes that he is Arcas the son of Callisto and  Zeus, and he lived in the country about Lycaeum. After Zeus had seduced  Callisto, Lycaon, pretending not to know of the matter, entertained  Zeus, as Hesiod says, and set before him on the table the babe which he  had cut up.      Fragment #4--Pseudo-Eratosthenes, Catast. fr. xxxii: Orion.]--Hesiod  says that he was the son of Euryale, the daughter of Minos, and of  Poseidon, and that there was given him as a gift the power of walking  upon the waves as though upon land. When he was come to Chios, he  outraged Merope, the daughter of Oenopion, being drunken; but Oenopion  when he learned of it was greatly vexed at the outrage and blinded him  and cast him out of the country. Then he came to Lemnos as a beggar and  there met Hephaestus who took pity on him and gave him Cedalion his own  servant to guide him. So Orion took Cedalion upon his shoulders and used  to carry him about while he pointed out the roads. Then he came to the  east and appears to have met Helius (the Sun) and to have been healed,  and so returned back again to Oenopion to punish him; but Oenopion was  hidden away by his people underground. Being disappointed, then, in his  search for the king, Orion went away to Crete and spent his time hunting  in company with Artemis and Leto. It seems that he threatened to kill  every beast there was on earth; whereupon, in her anger, Earth sent up  against him a scorpion of very great size by which he was stung and so  perished. After"]]]
