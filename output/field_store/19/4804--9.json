Not long ago a collar was presented to Bill as a reward for  his services; unfortunately for him, he has since lost this token of  public regard--a misfortune much to be regretted. The following verse  was engraved on the collar:--        'I am the fire-escape man's dog: my name is Bill.      When 'fire' is called I am never still:      I bark for my master, all danger brave,      To bring the escape--human life to save.'    Collared or collarless, Bill is always ready to lend a helping bark.  May his life be long, and his services properly esteemed!\"    The following anecdote shows extraordinary sense, if not reasoning  faculty, in a dog:--    A lady of high rank has a sort of colley, or Scotch sheep-dog. When he  is ordered to ring the bell, he does so; but if he is told to ring the  bell when the servant is in the room whose duty it is to attend, he  refuses, and then the following occurrence takes place. His mistress  says, \"Ring the bell, dog.\" The dog looks at the servant, and then  barks his bow wow, once or twice. The order is repeated two or three  times. At last the dog lays hold of the servant's coat in a  significant manner, just as if he had said to him--\"Don't you hear  that I am to ring the bell for you?--come to my lady.\" His mistress  always had her shoes warmed before she put them on, but one day during  the hot weather her maid was putting them on without their having been  previously placed before the fire. When the dog saw this he  immediately interfered, expressing the greatest indignation at the  maid's negligence. He took the shoes from her, carried them to the  fire, and after they had been warmed as usual, he brought them back to  his mistress with much apparent satisfaction, evidently intending to  say, if he could, \"It is all right now.\"    The dispositions and characters of dogs, as well as their  intelligence, vary very much. Let me give a few instances of this.    When that benevolent man, Mr. Backhouse, went to Australia, in hopes  of doing good among the convicts, he was residing in the house of a  gentleman who had a son about four years of age. This boy strayed one  morning into the bush, and could not be found after a long search had  been made for him. In the evening a little dog, which had accompanied  the child, scratched at the door, and on its being opened showed  unmistakeable signs of wishing to be followed. This was done; and he  led the way to the child, who was at last found sitting by the side of  a river three or four miles from the house.    At Albany in Worcestershire, at the seat of Admiral Maling, a dog went  every day to meet the mail, and brought the bag in his mouth to the  house. The distance was about a half-a-quarter of a mile. The dog  usually received a meal of meat as his reward. The servants having, on  _one day only_, neglected to give him his accustomed meal, the dog on  the arrival of the next mail buried the bag, nor was it found without  considerable search.    M. D'Obsonville had a dog which he had brought up in India from two  months old; and having to go with a friend from Pondicherry to  Bengalore, a distance of more than nine hundred miles, he took the  animal along with him. \"Our journey,\" says M. D'O., \"occupied nearly  three weeks; and we had to traverse plains and mountains, and to ford  rivers, and go along by-paths. The animal, which had certainly never  been in that country before, lost us at Bengalore, and immediately  returned to Pondicherry. He went directly to the house of my friend,  M. Beglier, then commandant of artillery, and with whom I had  generally lived. Now the difficulty is not so much to know how the dog  subsisted on the road (for he was very strong, and able to procure  himself food), but how he should so well have found his way after an  interval of more than a month! This was an effort of memory greatly  superior to that which the human race is capable of exerting.\"    A gentleman residing in Denmark, Mr. Decouick, one of the king's privy  councillors, found that he had a remarkable dog. It was the habit of  Mr. Decouick to leave Copenhagen on Fridays for Drovengourd, his  country seat. If he did not arrive there on the Friday evening, the  dog would invariably be found at Copenhagen on Saturday morning, in  search of his master. Hydrophobia becoming common, all dogs were shot  that were found running about, an exception being made in the case of  Mr. Decouick's dog on account of his sagacity and fidelity, a  distinctive mark being placed upon him.    The following anecdotes are from Daniel's \"Rural Sports:\"--    Upon the fidelity of dogs, the following facts deserve to be here  recorded: of this property, or other peculiar traits, if they  appertain to any class of sporting dogs, in that class they will be  noticed.    Dr. Beattie, in one of his ingenious and elegant essays, relates a  story, in his own knowledge, of a gentleman's life being saved, who  fell beneath the ice, by his dog's going in quest of assistance, and  almost forcibly dragging a farmer to the spot.    Mr. Vaillant describes the losing of a bitch while travelling in  Africa, when after firing his gun, and fruitlessly searching for her,  he despatched one of his attendants, to return by the way they had  proceeded; when she was found at about two leagues' distance, seated  by the side of a chair and basket, which had dropped unperceived from  his waggon: an instance of attentive fidelity, which must have proved  fatal to the animal, either from hunger or beasts of prey, had she not  been luckily discovered.    As instances of the dog's sagacity, the following are submitted. In  crossing the mountain St. Gothard, near Airola, the Chevalier Gaspard  de Brandenberg and his servant were buried by an avalanche; his dog,  who escaped the heap of snow, did not quit the place where he had lost  his master: this was, fortunately, not far from the convent; the  animal howled, ran to the convent frequently, and then returned.  Struck by his perseverance, the next morning the people from the house  followed him; he led them directly to the spot, scratched the snow,  and after thirty-six hours passed beneath it, the chevalier and his  domestic were taken out safe, hearing distinctly during their  confinement the howling of the dog and the discourse of their  deliverers. Sensible that to the sagacity and fondness of this  creature he owed his life, the gentleman ordered by his will that he  should be represented on his tomb with his dog; and at Zug, in the  church of St. Oswald, where he was buried in 1728, they still show the  monument and the effigy of this gentleman, with the dog lying at his  feet.    In 1792, a gentleman, who lived in Vere Street, Clare Market, went  with his family to the pit of Drury Lane Theatre, at about half-past  five in the evening, leaving a small spaniel, of King Charles's breed,  locked up in the dining-room, to prevent the dog from being lost in  his absence. At eight o'clock his son opened the door, and the dog  immediately went to the playhouse and found out his master, though the  pit was unusually thronged, and his master seated near its centre.    A large dog of Mr. Hilson's, of Maxwelhaugh, on the 21st of October,  1797, seeing a small one that was following a cart from Kelso carried  by the current of the Tweed, in spite of all its efforts to bear up  against the stream, after watching its motions attentively, plunged  voluntarily into the river, and seizing the tired animal by the neck,  brought it safely to land.    The docility of the dog is such, that he may be taught to practise  with considerable dexterity a variety of human actions: to open a door  fastened by a latch, and pull a bell when desirous to be admitted.  Faber mentions one belonging to a nobleman of the Medici family, which  always attended at its master's table, took from him his plates, and  brought him others; carried wine to him in a glass upon a salver,  which it held in its mouth, without spilling; the same dog would also  hold the stirrup in its teeth while its master was mounting his horse.  Mr. Daniel had formerly a spaniel, which he gave the honourable Mr.  Greville, that, beyond the common tricks which dogs trained to fetch  and carry exhibit, would bring the bottles of wine from the corner of  the room to the table by the neck, with such care as never to break  one; and, in fact, was the _boots_ of the mess-room.    Some few years since, the person who lived at the turnpike-house,  about a mile from Stratford-upon-Avon, had trained a dog to go to the  town for any small parcels of grocery, &c. which he wanted. A note,  mentioning the things required, was tied round his neck, and in the  same manner the articles were fastened, and arrived safe to his  master.    Colonel Hutchinson relates the following anecdote:--    \"A cousin of one of my brother-officers was taking a walk at Tunbridge  Wells, when a strange Newfoundland snatched her parasol from her hand,  and carried it off. The lady followed the dog, who kept ahead,  constantly looking back to see if she followed. The dog at length  stopped at a confectioner's, and went in, followed by the lady, who,  as the dog would not resign it, applied to the shopman for assistance.  He then told her that it was an old trick of the dog's to get a bun,  and that if she would give him one he would return the property. She  cheerfully did so, and the dog as willingly made the exchange.\"    The above anecdote proves that dogs are no mean observers of  countenances, and that he had satisfied himself by a previous scrutiny  as to the probability of his delinquencies being forgiven.    Of the abstinence and escape of a dog, the following narrative may not  be uninteresting:--    In 1789, when preparations were making at St. Paul's for the reception  of his majesty, a favourite dog followed its master up the dark stairs  of the dome. Here, all at once, it was missing;"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26556"],[0,"Myths and Marvels of Astronomy (#12)"],[1,"the opening of the  slant tunnel, then, by continuing this tunnelling through the base tiers  of the pyramid, the means would be obtained of correcting the  orientation.    This, I say, would be the course naturally suggested to astronomical  architects who had determined the latitude in the manner described  above. It may even be described as the only very accurate method  available before the telescope had been invented. So that if the  accuracy of the orientation appears to be greater than could be obtained  by the shadow method, the natural inference, even in the absence of  corroborative evidence, would be that the stellar method, and no other,  had been employed. Now, in 1779, Nouet, by refined observations, found  the error of orientation measured by less than 20 minutes of arc,  corresponding roughly to a displacement of the corners by about 37-1/2  inches from their true position, as supposed to be determined from the  centre; or to a displacement of a southern corner by 53 inches on an  east and west line from a point due south of the corresponding northern  corner. This error, for a base length of 9140 inches, would not be  serious, being only one inch in about five yards (when estimated in the  second way). Yet the result is not quite worthy of the praise given to  it by Professor Smyth. He himself, however, by much more exact  observations, with an excellent altazimuth, reduced the alleged error  from 20 minutes to only 4-1/2, or to 9-40ths of its formerly supposed  value. This made the total displacement of a southern corner from the  true meridian through the corresponding northern corner, almost exactly  one foot, or one inch in about twenty-one yards--a degree of accuracy  rendering it practically certain that some stellar method was used in  orienting the base.    Now there _is_ a slanting tunnel occupying precisely the position of the  tunnel which should, according to this view, have been formed in order  accurately to orient the pyramid's base, assuming that the time of the  building of the pyramid corresponded with one of the epochs when the  star Alpha Draconis was distant 3 deg. 42' from the pole of the heavens.  In other words, there is a slant tunnel directed northwards and upwards  from a point deep down below the middle of the pyramid's base, and  inclined 26 deg. 17' to the horizon, the elevation of Alpha Draconis at  its lower culmination when 3 deg. 42' from the pole. The last epoch when  the star was thus placed was _circiter_ 2160 B.C.; the epoch next before  that was 3440 B.C. Between these two we should have to choose, on the  hypothesis that the slant tunnel was really directed to that star when  the foundations of the pyramid were laid. For the next epoch before the  earlier of the two named was about 28,000 B.C., and the pyramid's date  cannot have been more remote than 4000 B.C.    The slant tunnel, while admirably fulfilling the requirements suggested,  seems altogether unsuited for any other. Its transverse height (that is,  its width in a direction perpendicular to its upper and lower faces) did  not amount to quite four feet; its breadth was not quite three feet and  a half. It was, therefore, not well fitted for an entrance passage to  the subterranean chamber immediately under the apex of the pyramid (with  which chamber it communicates in the manner suggested by the above  theory). It could not have been intended to be used for observing  meridian transits of the stars in order to determine sidereal time; for  close circumpolar stars, by reason of their slow motion, are the least  suited of all for such a purpose. As Professor Smyth says, in arguing  against this suggested use of the star, 'no observer in his senses, in  any existing observatory, when seeking to obtain the time, would observe  the transit of a circumpolar star for anything else than _to get the  direction of the meridian to adjust his instrument by_.' (The italics  are his.) It is precisely such a purpose (the adjustment, however, not  of an instrument, but of the entire structure of the pyramid itself),  that I have suggested for this remarkable passage--this 'cream-white,  stone-lined, long tube,' where it traverses the masonry of the pyramid,  and below that dug through the solid rock to a distance of more than 350  feet.    Let us next consider the dimensions of the square base thus carefully  placed in latitude 30 deg. north to the best of the builders' power, with  sides carefully oriented.    It seems highly probable that, whatever special purpose the pyramid was  intended to fulfil, a subordinate idea of the builders would have been  to represent symbolically in the proportions of the building such  mathematical and astronomical relations as they were acquainted with.  From what we know by tradition of the men of the remote time when the  pyramid was built, and what we can infer from the ideas of those who  inherited, however remotely, the modes of thought of the earliest  astronomers and mathematicians, we can well believe that they would look  with superstitious reverence on special figures, proportions, numbers,  and so forth. Apart from this, they may have had a quasi-scientific  desire to make a lasting record of their discoveries, and of the  collected knowledge of their time.    It seems altogether probable, then, that the smaller unit of measurement  used by the builders of the great Pyramid was intended, as Professor  Smyth thinks, to be equal to the 500,000,000th part of the earth's  diameter, determined from their geodetical observations. It was  perfectly within the power of mechanicians and mathematicians so  experienced as they undoubtedly were--the pyramid attests so much--to  measure with considerable accuracy the length of a degree of latitude.  They could not possibly (always setting aside the theory of divine  inspiration) have known anything about the compression of the earth's  globe, and therefore could not have intended, as Professor Smyth  supposes, to have had the 500,000,000th part of the earth's polar axis,  as distinguished from any other, for their unit of length. But if they  made observations in or near latitude 30 deg. north on the supposition  that the earth is a globe, their probable error would exceed the  difference even between the earth's polar and equatorial diameters. Both  differences are largely exceeded by the range of difference among the  estimates of the actual length of the sacred cubit, supposed to have  contained twenty-five of these smaller units. And, again, the length of  the pyramid base-side, on which Smyth bases his own estimate of the  sacred cubit, has been variously estimated, the largest measure being  9168 inches, and the lowest 9110 inches. The fundamental theory of the  pyramidalists, that the sacred cubit was exactly one 20,000,000th part  of the earth's polar diameter, and that the side of the base contained  as many cubits and parts of a cubit as there are days and parts of a day  in the tropical year (or year of seasons), requires that the length of  the side should be 9140 inches, lying between the limits indicated, but  still so widely removed from either that it would appear very unsafe to  base a theory on the supposition that the exact length is or was 9140  inches. If the measures 9168 inches and 9110 inches were inferior, and  several excellent measures made by practised observers ranged around the  length 9140 inches, the case would be different. But the best recent  measures gave respectively 9110 and 9130 inches; and Smyth exclaims  against the unfairness of Sir H. James in taking 9120 as 'therefore the  [probable] true length of the side of the great pyramid when perfect,'  calling this 'a dishonourable shelving of the honourable older observers  with their larger results.' The only other measures, besides these two,  are two by Colonel Howard Vyse and by the French _savants_, giving  respectively 9168 and 9163.44 inches. The pyramidalists consider 9140  inches a fair mean value from these four. The natural inference,  however, is, that the pyramid base is not now in a condition to be  satisfactorily measured; and assuredly no such reliance can be placed  on the mean value 9140 inches that, on the strength of it, we should  believe what otherwise would be utterly incredible, viz. that the  builders of the great pyramid knew 'both the size and shape of the earth  exactly.' 'Humanly, or by human science, finding it out in that age was,  of course, utterly impossible,' says Professor Smyth. But he is so  confident of the average value derived from widely conflicting base  measures as to assume that this value, not being humanly discoverable,  was of necessity 'attributable to God and to His Divine inspiration.' We  may agree, in fine, with Smyth, that the builders of the pyramid knew  the earth to be a globe; that they took for their measure of length the  sacred cubit, which, by their earth measures, they made very fairly  approximate to the 20,000,000th part of the earth's mean diameter; but  there seems no reason whatever for supposing (even if the supposition  were not antecedently of its very nature inadmissible) that they knew  anything about the compression of the earth, or that they had measured a  degree of latitude in their own place with very wonderful accuracy.[20]    But here a very singular coincidence may be noticed, or, rather, is  forced upon our notice by the pyramidalists, who strangely enough  recognise in it fresh evidence of design, while the unbeliever finds in  it proof that coincidences are no sure evidence of design. The side of  the pyramid containing 365-1/4 times the sacred cubit of 25 pyramid  inches, it follows that the diagonal of the base contains 12,912 such  inches, and the two diagonals together contain 25,824 pyramid inches, or  almost exactly as many inches as there are years in the great  precessional period. 'No one whatever amongst men,' says Professor Smyth  after"]]]
