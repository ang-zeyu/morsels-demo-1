Ned Brooke couldn't do such a thing--oh, no! The poor injured boy at  whom everyone has such an unlawful pick! I wonder if this will  convince them.\"    \"Do you think they can get it all back?\" I asked. \"It's not likely he  would have dared to use any of it yet.\"    \"I don't know. We'll have a try, anyhow. How long before this plate  will be dry enough to carry down to the Carrolls as circumstantial  evidence?\"    \"Three hours or thereabouts,\" I answered, \"but perhaps sooner. I'll  take two prints off when it is ready. I wonder what the Carrolls will  say.\"    \"It's a piece of pure luck that the plate should have turned out so  well after the slap-dash way in which it was taken and used. I say,  Amy, isn't this quite an adventure?\"    At last the plate was dry, and I printed two proofs. We wrapped them  up carefully and marched down to Mr. Carroll's.    You never saw people so overcome with astonishment as the Carrolls  were when Cecil, with the air of a statesman unfolding the evidence of  some dreadful conspiracy against the peace and welfare of the nation,  produced the plate and the proofs, and held them out before them.    Mr. Carroll and Cecil took the proofs and went over to the Brooke  shanty. They found only Ned and his mother at home. At first Ned, when  taxed with his guilt, denied it, but when Mr. Carroll confronted him  with the proofs, he broke down in a spasm of terror and confessed all.  His mother produced the pocketbook and the money--they had not dared  to spend a single cent of it--and Mr. Carroll went home in triumph.    Perhaps Ned Brooke ought not to have been let off so easily as he was,  but his mother cried and pleaded, and Mr. Carroll was too kind-hearted  to resist. So he did not punish them at all, save by utterly  discarding the whole family and their concerns. The place got too hot  for them after the story came out, and in less than a month all moved  away--much to the benefit of Mapleton.          In Spite of Myself      My trunk was packed and I had arranged with my senior partner--I was  the junior member of a law firm--for a month's vacation. Aunt Lucy had  written that her husband had gone on a sea trip and she wished me to  superintend the business of his farm and mills in his absence, if I  could arrange to do so. She added that \"Gussie\" thought it was a pity  to trouble me, and wanted to do the overseeing herself, but that  she--Aunt Lucy--preferred to have a man at the head of affairs.    I had never seen my step-cousin, Augusta Ashley, but I knew, from Aunt  Lucy's remarks concerning her, pretty much what sort of person she  was--just the precise kind I disliked immeasurably. I had no idea what  her age was, but doubtless she was over thirty, tall, determined,  aggressive, with a \"faculty\" for managing, a sharp, probing nose, and  a y-formation between her eyebrows. I knew the type, and I was assured  that the period of sojourn with my respected aunt would be one of  strife between Miss Ashley and myself.    I wrote to Aunt Lucy to expect me, made all necessary arrangements,  and went to bid Nellie goodbye. I had made up my mind to marry Nellie.  I had never openly avowed myself her suitor, but we were cousins, and  had grown up together, so that I knew her well enough to be sure of my  ground. I liked her so well that it was easy to persuade myself that I  was in love with her. She more nearly fulfilled the requirements of my  ideal wife than anyone I knew. She was pleasant to look upon, without  being distractingly pretty; small and fair and womanly. She dressed  nicely, sang and played agreeably, danced well, and had a cheerful,  affectionate disposition. She was not alarmingly clever, had no  \"hobbies,\" and looked up to me as heir to all the wisdom of the  ages--what man does not like to be thought clever and brilliant? I had  no formidable rival, and our families were anxious for the match. I  considered myself a lucky fellow. I felt that I would be very lonely  without Nellie when I was away, and she admitted frankly that she  would miss me awfully. She looked so sweet that I was on the point of  asking her then and there to marry me. Well, fate interfered in the  guise of a small brother, so I said goodbye and left, mentally  comparing her to my idea of Miss Augusta Ashley, much to the latter's  disadvantage.    When I stepped from the train at a sleepy country station next day I  was promptly waylaid by a black-eyed urchin who informed me that Mrs.  Ashley had sent him with an express wagon for my luggage, and that  \"Miss Gussie\" was waiting with the carriage at the store, pointing  down to a small building before whose door a girl was trying to soothe  her frightened horse.    As I went down the slope towards her I noticed she was tall--quite too  tall for my taste. I dislike women who can look into my eyes on a  level--but I had to admit that her form was remarkably symmetrical and  graceful. She put out her hand--it was ungloved and large, but white  and firm, with a cool, pleasant touch--and said, with a composure akin  to indifference, \"Mr. Carslake, I presume. Mother could not come to  meet you, so she sent me. Will you be kind enough to hold my horse for  a few minutes? I want to get something in the store.\" Whereupon she  calmly transferred the reins to me and disappeared.    At the time she certainly did not impress me as pretty, yet neither  could I call her plain. Taken separately, her features were good. Her  nose was large and straight, the mouth also a trifle large but firm  and red, the brow wide and white, shadowed by a straying dash of brown  curl or two. She had a certain cool, statuesque paleness, accentuated  by straight, fine, black brows, and her eyes were a bluish grey; but  the pupils, as I afterward found out, had a trick of dilating into  wells of blackness which, added to a long fringe of very dark lashes,  made her eyes quite the most striking feature of her face. Her  expression was open and frank, and her voice clear and musical without  being sweet. She looked about twenty-two.    At the time I did not fancy her appearance and made a mental note to  the effect that I would never like Miss Ashley. I had no use for cool,  businesslike women--women should have no concern with business. Nellie  would never have troubled her dear, curly head over it.    Miss Ashley came out with her arms full of packages, stowed them away  in the carriage, got in, told me which road to take, and did not again  speak till we were out of the village and driving along a pretty  country lane, arched over with crimson maples and golden-brown  beeches. The purplish haze of a sunny autumn day mellowed over the  fields, and the bunch of golden rod at my companion's belt was akin to  the plumed ranks along the fences. I hazarded the remark that it was a  fine day; Miss Ashley gravely admitted that it was. Then a deep smile  seemed to rise somewhere in her eyes and creep over her face,  discovering a dimple here and there as it proceeded.    \"Don't let's talk about the weather--the subject is rather stale,\" she  said. \"I suppose you are wondering why on earth Mother had to drag you  away out here. I tried to show her how foolish it was, but I didn't  succeed. Mother thinks there must be a man at the head of affairs or  they'll never go right. I could have taken full charge easily enough;  I haven't been Father's 'boy' all my life for nothing. There was no  need to take you away from your business.\"    I protested. I said I was going to take a vacation anyway, and  business was not pressing just then. I also hinted that, while I had  no doubt of her capacity, she might have found the duties of  superintendent rather arduous.    \"Not at all,\" she said, with a serenity that made me groan inwardly.  \"I like it. Father always said I was a born business manager. You'll  find Ashley's Mills very quiet, I'm afraid. It's a sort of charmed  Sleepy Hollow. See, there's home,\" as we turned a maple-blazoned  corner and looked from the crest of one hill across to that of  another. \"Home\" was a big, white, green-shuttered house buried amid a  riot of autumn colour, with a big grove of dark green spruces at the  back. Below them was a glimpse of a dark blue mill pond and beyond it  long sweeps of golden-brown meadow land, sloping up till they dimmed  in horizon mists of pearl and purple.    \"How pretty,\" I exclaimed admiringly.    \"Isn't it?\" said Gussie proudly. \"I love it.\" Her pupils dilated into  dark pools, and I rather unwillingly admitted that Miss Ashley was a  fine-looking girl.    As we drove up Aunt Lucy was standing on the steps of the verandah,  over whose white roof trailed a luxuriant creeper, its leaves tinged  by October frosts into lovely wine reds and tawny yellows. Gussie  sprang out, barely touching my offered hand with her fingertips.    \"There's Mother waiting to pounce on you and hear all the family  news,\" she said, \"so go and greet her like a dutiful nephew.\"    \"I must take out your horse for you first,\" I said politely.    \"Not at all,\" said Miss Ashley, taking the reins from my hands in a  way not to be disputed. \"I always unharness Charley myself. No one  understands him half so well. Besides, I'm used to it. Didn't I tell  you I'd always been Father's boy?\"    \"I well believe it,\" I thought in disgust, as she led the horse over  to the well and I went up to Aunt Lucy. Through the sitting-room  windows I kept a watchful eye on Miss Ashley as she watered and deftly  unharnessed Charley and led him into his stable with sundry pats on  his nose. Then I saw no more of her till she came in to tell us tea  was ready, and led the way out to the dining room.    It was evident Miss Gussie held the reins of household government, and  no doubt worthily. Those firm, capable white hands of hers looked as  though they might be equal to a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24875"],[0,"Lucy Maud Montgomery Short Stories, 1904 (#12)"],[1,"just touched her shoulders  and bobbed and fluttered with her every motion; behind, it was caught  up in a knot on her head and surmounted by a tiny lace cap.    She looks as if she had just stepped out of a bandbox of last century,  thought Mary.    \"Are you Cousin Abner's girls?\" demanded the little lady eagerly.  There was such excitement and expectation in her face and voice that  both the Seymour girls felt uncomfortably that they ought to be  \"Cousin Abner's girls.\"    \"No,\" said Mary reluctantly, \"we're not. We are only--Martin Seymour's  girls.\"    All the light went out of the little lady's face, as if some  illuminating lamp had suddenly been quenched behind it. She seemed  fairly to droop under her disappointment. As for the rest, the name of  Martin Seymour evidently conveyed no especial meaning to her ears. How  could she know that he was a multi-millionaire who was popularly  supposed to breakfast on railroads and lunch on small corporations,  and that his daughters were girls whom all people delighted to honour?    \"No, of course you are not Cousin Abner's girls,\" she said  sorrowfully. \"I'd have known you couldn't be if I had just stopped to  think. Because you are dark and they would be fair, of course; Cousin  Abner and his wife were both fair. But when I saw you coming down the  lane--I was peeking through the hall window upstairs, you know, I and  Juliana--I was sure you were Helen and Beatrice at last. And I can't  help wishing you were!\"    \"I wish we were, too, since you expected them,\" said Mary, smiling.  \"But--\"    \"Oh, I wasn't really expecting them,\" broke in the little lady. \"Only  I am always hoping that they will come. They never have yet, but  Trenton isn't so very far away, and it is so lonely here. I just long  for company--I and Juliana--and I thought I was going to have it  today. Cousin Abner came to see me once since I moved here and he said  the girls would come, too, but that was six months ago and they  haven't come yet. But perhaps they will soon. It is always something  to look forward to, you know.\"    She talked in a sweet, chirpy voice like a bird's. There were pathetic  notes in it, too, as the girls instinctively felt. How very quaint and  sweet and unworldly she was! Mary found herself feeling indignant at  Cousin Abner's girls, whoever they were, for their neglect.    \"We are out for a spin on our wheels,\" said Ida, \"and we are very  thirsty. We thought perhaps you would be kind enough to give us a  drink of water.\"    \"Oh, my dear, anything--anything I have is at your service,\" said the  little lady delightedly. \"If you will come in, I will get you some  lemonade.\"    \"I am afraid it is too much trouble,\" began Mary.    \"Oh, no, no,\" cried the little lady. \"It is a pleasure. I love doing  things for people, I wish more of them would come to give me the  chance. I never have any company, and I do so long for it. It's very  lonesome here at Golden Gate. Oh, if you would only stay to tea with  me, it would make me so happy. I am all prepared. I prepare every  Saturday morning, in particular, so that if Cousin Abner's girls did  come, I would be all ready. And when nobody comes, Juliana and I have  to eat everything up ourselves. And that is bad for us--it gives  Juliana indigestion. If you would only stay!\"    \"We will,\" agreed Ida promptly. \"And we're glad of the chance. We are  both terribly hungry, and it is very good of you to ask us.\"    \"Oh, indeed, it isn't! It's just selfishness in me, that's what it is,  pure selfishness! I want company so much. Come in, my dears, and I  suppose I must introduce myself because you don't know me, do you now?  I'm Miss Sally Temple, and this is Golden Gate Cottage. Dear me, this  _is_ something like living. You are special providences, that you are,  indeed!\"    She whisked them through a quaint little parlour, where everything was  as dainty and neat and old-fashioned as herself, and into a spare  bedroom beyond it, to put off their hats.    \"Now, just excuse me a minute while I run out and tell Juliana that we  are going to have company to tea. She will be so glad, Juliana will.  Make yourselves at home, my dears.\"    \"Isn't she delicious?\" said Mary, when Miss Sally had tripped out.  \"I'd like to shake Cousin Abner's girls. This is what Dot Halliday  would call an adventure, Ida.\"    \"Isn't it! Miss Sally and this quaint old spot both seem like a  chapter out of the novels our grandmothers cried over. Look here,  Mary, she is lonely and our visit seems like a treat to her. Let us  try to make it one. Let's just chum with her and tell her all about  ourselves and our amusements and our dresses. That sounds frivolous,  but you know what I mean. She'll like it. Let's be company in real  earnest for her.\"    When Miss Sally came back, she was attended by Juliana carrying a tray  of lemonade glasses. Juliana proved to be a diminutive lass of about  fourteen whose cheerful, freckled face wore an expansive grin of  pleasure. Evidently Juliana was as fond of \"company\" as her mistress  was. Afterwards, the girls overheard a subdued colloquy between Miss  Sally and Juliana out in the hall.    \"Go set the table, Juliana, and put on Grandmother Temple's wedding  china--be sure you dust it carefully--and the best tablecloth--and be  sure you get the crease straight--and put some sweet peas in the  centre--and be sure they are fresh. I want everything extra nice,  Juliana.\"    \"Yes'm, Miss Sally, I'll see to it. Isn't it great to have company,  Miss Sally?\" whispered Juliana.    The Seymour girls long remembered that tea table and the delicacies  with which it was heaped. Privately, they did not wonder that Juliana  had indigestion when she had to eat many such unaided. Being hungry,  they did full justice to Miss Sally's good things, much to that little  lady's delight.    She told them all about herself. She had lived at Golden Gate Cottage  only a year.    \"Before that, I lived away down the country at Millbridge with a  cousin. My Uncle Ephraim owned Golden Gate Cottage, and when he died  he left it to me and I came here to live. It is a pretty place, isn't  it? You see those two headlands out there? In the morning, when the  sun rises, the water between them is just a sea of gold, and that is  why Uncle Ephraim had a fancy to call his place Golden Gate. I love it  here. It is so nice to have a home of my own. I would be quite content  if I had more company. But I have you today, and perhaps Beatrice and  Helen will come next week. So I've really a great deal to be thankful  for.\"    \"What is your Cousin Abner's other name?\" asked Mary, with a vague  recollection of hearing of Beatrice and Helen--somebody--in Trenton.    \"Reed--Abner Abimelech Reed,\" answered Miss Sally promptly. \"A.A.  Reed, he signs himself now. He is very well-to-do, I am told, and he  carries on business in town. He was a very fine young man, my Cousin  Abner. I don't know his wife.\"    Mary and Ida exchanged glances. Beatrice and Helen Reed! They knew  them slightly as the daughters of a new-rich family who were  hangers-on of the fashionable society in Trenton. They were regarded  as decidedly vulgar, and so far their efforts to gain an entry into  the exclusive circle where the Seymours and their like revolved had  not been very successful.    \"I'm afraid Miss Sally will wait a long while before she sees Cousin  Abner's girls,\" said Mary, when they had gone back to the parlour and  Miss Sally had excused herself to superintend the washing of  Grandmother Temple's wedding china. \"They probably look on her as a  poor relation to be ignored altogether; whereas, if they were only  like her, Trenton society would have made a place for them long ago.\"    The Seymour girls enjoyed that visit as much as Miss Sally did. She  was eager to hear all about their girlish lives and amusements. They  told her of their travels, of famous men and women they had seen, of  parties they had attended, the dresses they wore, the little fads and  hobbies of their set--all jumbled up together and all listened to  eagerly by Miss Sally and also by Juliana, who was permitted to sit on  the stairs out in the hall and so gather in the crumbs of this  intellectual feast.    \"Oh, you've been such pleasant company,\" said Miss Sally when the  girls went away.    Mary took the little lady's hands in hers and looked affectionately  down into her face.    \"Would you like it--you and Juliana--if we came out to see you often?  And perhaps brought some of our friends with us?\"    \"Oh, if you only would!\" breathed Miss Sally.    Mary laughed and, obeying a sudden impulse, bent and kissed Miss  Sally's cheek.    \"We'll come then,\" she promised. \"Please look upon us as your 'steady  company' henceforth.\"    The girls kept their word. Thereafter, nearly every Saturday of the  summer found them taking tea with Miss Sally at Golden Gate. Sometimes  they came alone; sometimes they brought other girls. It soon became a  decided \"fad\" in their set to go to see Miss Sally. Everybody who met  her loved her at sight. It was considered a special treat to be taken  by the Seymours to Golden Gate.    As for Miss Sally, her cup of happiness was almost full. She had  \"company\" to her heart's content and of the very kind she  loved--bright, merry, fun-loving girls who devoured her dainties with  a frank zest that delighted her, filled the quaint old rooms with  laughter and life, and chattered to her of all their plans and frolics  and hopes. There was just one little cloud on Miss Sally's fair sky.    \"If only Cousin Abner's girls would come!\" she once said wistfully to  Mary. \"Nobody can quite take the place of one's own, you know. My  heart yearns after them.\"    Mary was very silent and thoughtful as she drove back to Trenton that  night. Two days afterwards, she went to Mrs. Gardiner's lawn party.  The Reed girls were there. They were tall, fair, handsome girls,  somewhat too lavishly and pronouncedly"]]]
