A dry-voiced little bird  whose unmusical, but distinctly uttered _chebec, chebec_ makes up in  character what it lacks in sweetness.

FAMILY ALAUDIDAE      PRAIRIE HORNED LARK    _Otocoris alpestris praticola. Case 2, Fig. 42_              Note the long hind-toe nail (or the track it            leaves), the little feathered 'horns,' the black            patch on cheeks and breast (less evident in            winter). Smaller than the Northern Horned Lark,            which visits the United States only in winter,            with the line over the eye white, and throat but            faintly tinged with yellow. L. 7-1/4.              _Range._ Nests in the Upper Mississippi Valley            from Missouri and in the Atlantic States            (locally), from Connecticut northward; winters            southward to Texas and Georgia. The Horned Lark            (_Otocoris alpestris alpestris_), is a more            northern race, nesting in the Arctic regions and            migrating southward as far as Ohio and rarely            Georgia, when it is often associated with the            resident Prairie Horned Lark. It is larger than            that race (L. 7-3/4) and has the throat and line            over the eye yellow.              Washington, common W.V., Aug. 11-Apl. Cambridge,            one record. N. Ohio, common P.R. Glen Ellyn,            common P.R. SE. Minn., S.R., Mch.-Nov., a few in            mild winters.    A bird of open places--shores, plains, and prairies, and roadways--who  runs (not hops) nimbly ahead of one, or, with a short note, rises, and  on its long, pointed wings, flies on ahead. He usually returns to the  ground, but may alight on a fence; his long hind toe-nail not being  suited to grasping a small perch. The weak, twittering song is uttered  on the wing, when the bird, like its relative the Skylark, mounts into  the air. It also sings from a perch near the ground.    The Prairie Horned Lark is the first of our small birds to nest, making  its home on the ground and laying four finely speckled eggs early in  March. After the nesting season the birds gather in flocks.          CROWS, JAYS, ETC. FAMILY CORVIDAE      BLUE JAY    _Cyanocitta cristata cristata. Case 2, Fig. 20_              Color, habits and voice combine to render the Blue            Jay conspicuous. L. 11-3/4.              _Range._ Eastern North America from Georgia to            Quebec; migratory only at the northern limit of            its range. The Florida Blue Jay (_Cyanocitta            cristata florincola_, Case 4, Fig. 75) is smaller            (L. 10-3/4) and grayer above. It is found            throughout Florida.              Washington, rather rare P.R., common T.V., Apl.            28-May 15; Sept. 15-Oct. 15. Ossining, tolerably            common P.R. Cambridge, common P.R., abundant T.V.,            Apl. and May; Sept. and Oct. N. Ohio, common P.R.            Glen Ellyn, common P.R. SE. Minn., common P.R.    If the Blue Jay were as good as he is beautiful he would be our most  popular bird. But fine feathers do not always make fine birds, and to  those who judge birds by human standards the Blue Jay's loud, harsh  voice, overbearing manners, and nest-robbing habits are unpardonable.  With all his faults, however, the true bird enthusiast loves him still.  His bright colors, dashing ways and intelligence win our admiration and  we feel honored when he makes his home near ours, building in early May  a well-made nest in a tree-crotch, for the reception of the 4-6  olive-green, thickly speckled eggs.      FLORIDA JAY    _Aphelocoma cyanea_              Size of the Blue Jay but quite unlike it in color.            The head, wings and tail are grayish blue without            white markings; the back is pale brown, the            underparts dirty white, with the throat            inconspicuously streaked and a faint bluish            breast-band.              _Range._ Florida between lat. 27 deg. and 30 deg., and            chiefly along the coasts.    This is the 'Scrub-Jay' of Florida and is not to be confused with the  Florida Blue Jay. It lives in districts where scrub palmetto grows, but  also comes into gardens and grows where it soon responds to proper  treatment and becomes semi-domesticated. It nests early in April.      CANADA JAY.    _Perisoreus canadensis canadensis_              Size of the Blue Jay; a gray bird with a black            crown and white forehead, cheeks and throat.              _Range._ Northern New England and northern New            York, northward; resident, rarely straggling            southward.              Cambridge, A.V., one record, Oct.    It is singular that the Canada Jay at the north and the Florida Jay in  the south should show exceptional confidence in man, while the Blue Jay  always seems to regard him with suspicion. The very day we make camp in  the north woods the Canada Jay or Whiskey Jack becomes our guest. As  though assured of a welcome he fearlessly joins our party, helping  himself to such supplies as please his fancy. Long before our arrival,  when snow still covered the ground, he has reared his family and for the  rest of the year has only his own wants to fill.      RAVEN    _Corvus corax principalis_              Much larger than the Crow, the throat with long,            pointed feathers, instead of short, rounded ones.            L. 24.              _Range._ North America rare and local in the            Eastern States, south to New Jersey on the coast            and to Georgia in the mountains.    Crows _caw_, while Ravens _croak_; but to be sure that you have actually  seen a Raven he should be with Crows, when the Raven's much larger size  is evident. Unless, however, you should visit the few localities in the  eastern States where Ravens live you are not likely to make the bird's  acquaintance. Ravens nest on cliffs as well as in trees. Their eggs,  which resemble those of the Crow in color, are laid in April.      CROW    _Corvus brachyrhynchos brachyrhynchos. Case 1, Fig. 19; Case 3, Fig. 27_              Sexes alike in color. L. 19-1/2.              _Range._ North America; migratory at the northern            limit of its range; roosting in colonies in            winter.              Washington, abundant P.R. Ossining, common P.R.            Cambridge, common P.R. abundant T.V. N. Ohio,            common P.R. Glen Ellyn, common P.R. SE. Minn.,            common S.R., Mch.-Nov., uncommon W.V.    The Crow and the Robin are probably the best known of all our birds. The  former we treat as an enemy and the latter as a friend, and one  therefore is as wild as the other is tame. Whether the Crow deserves to  be outlawed has not as yet been decided. But we should not condemn him  out of court and let us remember that as an intelligent, self-respecting  citizen, who animates wintry wastes with his shining sable form and  clarion call, he has other than economic claims to our consideration.  The nest is placed in a tree about 30 feet up, and 4-6 eggs, green  thickly marked with brownish are laid in April.    The Florida Crow (_C. b. pascuus_) is very near the northern bird, but  has the wings and tail smaller, the bill and feet larger. It lives  chiefly in the pine barrens of Florida and is much less common in the  state than the Fish Crow.      FISH CROW    _Corvus ossifragus_              Brighter, more uniformly colored above and below,            the feathers without dull tips.              _Range._ Atlantic and Gulf coast region from the            lower Hudson Valley and Long Island Sound            southward. Migratory only at the northern limit            of its range. Found throughout Florida, but            elsewhere usually not far from tidal water.              Washington, rather common P.R. Cambridge, A.V.,            one record, Mch.    In life the Fish Crow may be distinguished from the common Crow by its  smaller size and hoarser voice. The difference in size, however, is  evident only when the two are together, but once the cracked, reedy  _car_ (not _caw_) of the Fish Crow has been learned the species may  always be identified when heard. It is somewhat like the note of a young  Crow, but less immature. The nest and eggs are much like those of the  common Crow. The eggs are laid in May.          STARLINGS. FAMILY STURNIDAE      STARLING    _Sturnus vulgaris. Case 2, Figs. 24, 25_              In winter conspicuously dotted with whitish; in            summer with but few dots and a yellow bill; at all            times with a short tail and long wings. L 8-1/2.              _Range._ Introduced from Europe into Central Park,            New York City, in 1890, now more or less numerous            from Virginia to Maine; occasional west of the            Alleghanies. It is a quick, active bird, probing            the ground now this side, now that, as it walks            rapidly over our lawns. The short tail and long            wings are most noticeable in the air and            distinguish the Starling from our other black            birds.    A long-drawn whistle, such as one calls to a dog, is the Starling's most  common note, but it has many others. It nests in April, often after  quarreling with Flickers for possession of a nest-hole in which to lay  its pale bluish eggs. The young appear in mid-May and their harsh,  rasping food-call is a common note for several weeks; then the birds  begin to gather in companies which, later, form flocks of thousands.

[_Feb. 23, 1889._]    Your correspondent \"Roy's\" very interesting account of \"A Canine  Friendship\" tempts me to send you the following about two Dandy Dinmonts  in this neighbourhood.    Friends of mine in Dumfriesshire had in their house two Dandie Dinmont  dogs who were inseparable friends and constant companions in all that  was going on. One day one of these dogs disappeared unaccountably, and  nothing was seen of it for a week. His owners were very vexed, thinking  he must have got within the range of some keeper's gun or met with some  other accident.    But the absentee's home-keeping companion was greatly distressed; he  moped about, and would not touch any food for several days; till,  unexpectedly on my friend's part, the truant suddenly reappeared and  showed himself in the house. The dog who had remained at home, when he  saw the arrival of his former friend, looked steadily at him for a few  seconds, and then, without further parley, went at him and gave the  truant a thoroughly sound thrashing. I always explain this to myself by  supposing that the home-keeping dog decided that the truant had caused  him for several days needless anxiety and abstinence from food, and that  the truant must learn by painful experience that such behaviour could  not be lightly condoned by his inseparable companion.              J. G.      CONSCIOUS AUTOMATA.              [_July 31, 1875._]    I have lately heard a story that I hope you may think worthy of a place  among your illustrations of the thoughtful intelligence of \"Conscious  Automata.\" Many years ago, a family having a house in Grosvenor Square,  and a place in the country (I think in Warwickshire), owned a terrier,  who, in the country, made great friends with a large Newfoundland. When  they came to town they brought the terrier, and he resided in a mews  where he was much annoyed by a cur who lived next door, and attacked him  whenever he came out. One day the terrier disappeared, but after a  little time returned, bringing with him his big friend, who gave the  vulgar bully a satisfactory thrashing--not attempting to kill him. This  has been told me by an old servant, who was then a young man, living in  service in London, close to the owners of the dogs. He answers for the  facts of the story as he heard them at the time.              F. C.      DOG AND PIGEON.              [_Sept. 22, 1888._]    The _Spectator_ does not disdain anecdotes of dogs and their doings, and  I think the following history, to which I can bear personal testimony,  may be found not uninteresting to your readers. At this delightful house  in Perthshire, where I am on a visit, there is a well-bred pointer,  named Fop, who, when not engaged in his professional pursuits on the  moor, lives chiefly in a kennel placed in a loose-box adjoining the  other stables attached to the house. Nearly a year ago there were a pair  of pigeons who lived in and about the stable yard. One of the birds  died, and its bereaved mate at once attached itself for society and  protection to the dog, and has been its constant companion ever since.  On the days when the sportsmen are not seeking grouse the dog is in his  kennel, and the pigeon is always his close attendant. She roosts on a  rack over the manger of the stable, and in the day-time is either  strutting about preening her feathers, taking her meals from the dog's  biscuit and water tin, or quite as often sitting in the kennel by his  side, nestling close to him. Fop, who is an amiable and rather  sentimental being, takes no apparent notice of his companion, except  that we observe him, in jumping into or out of his kennel while the  pigeon is there, to take obvious care not to crush or disturb her in any  way. The only other symptom Fop has shown of being jealous for the  pigeon's comfort and convenience is that when of late two chickens from  the stable-yard wandered into the apartment where the dog and pigeon  reside, he very promptly bit their heads off, as if in mute intimation  that one bird is company, and two (or rather three) are none.    The story is rather one of a pigeon than a dog, for it is quite evident  that she is the devoted friend, and that he acquiesces in the  friendship. On the days when Fop is taken, to his infinite delight, on  to the moor, the pigeon is much concerned. She follows him as far as she  dare, taking a series of short flights over his head, until a little  wood is reached, through which the keeper and dogs have to take their  way. At this point her courage fails her, and she returns to the stable,  to wait hopefully for her comrade's return.    This singular alliance is a great joy and interest to the keepers,  coachmen, and grooms of the establishment, and as the keeper gave me a  strong hint that the story ought to be told in print, adding that he had  seen much less noteworthy incidents of animal life promoted to such  honour, I have ventured to send it to you. I may add that the pigeon is  of the kind called \"Jacobin,\" and is white, with a black wing. Is there  any precedent for such close intimacies between animals so widely  separated in kind and habit?              ALFRED AINGER.      A HEN AND PUPPIES.              [_Sept. 29, 1888._]    In reply to Mr. Ainger's question as to there being \"any precedent for  such close intimacies between animals so widely separated in kind and  habit\" as the dog and pigeon mentioned in his interesting letter, I can  mention two cases which have come under my notice this last summer at my  farm in Berkshire. In one case the friendship existed between a pullet  and a pig. The pullet never left the farmyard to join in the rambles of  the other fowls, but kept near the pig all day, occasionally roosting on  its friend's back when taking its afternoon nap.    The other case was more remarkable. A hen, with strong motherly  instincts, but no family of her own, acted for several weeks as  foster-mother to eight spaniel puppies. The real mother, a very gentle  creature, soon acquiesced in the arrangement. The hen covered the  puppies with her wings just as though they had been chickens, and  remained with them day and night. When they began to walk she was still  their constant attendant; when they learned to lap and eat a little she  would \"call\" them and break up their food. As they grew older the poor  foster-mother had her patience sorely tried. They barked and capered  around her, leading her altogether a sad life. After the puppies  deserted her she was often seen sitting close to their mother, the pair  apparently quite understanding each other. My children were naturally  delighted to watch these strange sights, and the hen, though not at  other times very tame, maintained perfect equanimity while they played  with the puppies around her.              F. C. MAXWELL.      A DOG AND A RABBIT.              [_Sept. 29, 1888._]    Mr. Ainger, in giving his interesting incident of strange friendships  between animals, asks if there are any precedents for such incongruous  intimacy as he saw between a dog and a pigeon. To most close observers  of animals, such curious cases, though always noteworthy, are well  known; naturalists like Buckland and many others have frequently  recorded them.    With the view of adding to the lore on this matter, permit me to cite  the following. Two Scotch terriers are lying before the fire. Prince is  an amiable sort of dog; Jack is rather surly; both good vermin-killers  and fond of hunting. I bring in a common buck rabbit, and place it  beside the dogs, with the intimation they were not to touch it. Trust,  and then alliance, quickly grew between it and Prince, whilst Jack shows  unmistakable hatred. In a few days the two friends, with their paws  absurdly clasping each other's necks, sleep happily on the rug; they  play together, they chase each other up and down the stairs and all over  the house at full speed, and when tired come back to the rug. Jack  refusing all this sort of thing, makes the rabbit look at him with a  sort of awe. Does Bunny make no mess in the house? None whatever; he  goes into the garden as the dogs do, and like them, scratches at the  door when he wants to return. All this he does without any instruction  from us. After a while, being very fond of him, we put on the floor a  pretty pink-eyed doe as a present. He stares, sniffs her all over, kills  her on the spot, and goes for a romp with his dear Prince. Jack always  sleeps under my bed from choice, and just before I put out the light as  I lie, stands up against the bed for his last pat and \"good-night.\"  Bunny has observed all this, and quietly creeps into the room, which he  refuses to leave; then likewise always asks for his \"good-night,\" and  sleeps somewhere near his great \"ideal.\"    Another instance, published in \"Loch Creran\" by my friend Mr. Anderson  Smith. I punished my cat for killing a chicken. The next day he is seen  to carry a live chicken in his mouth and lay it down to the hen he had  previously robbed. He and the chicken afterwards were frequently  observed leaving the orchard together, and travelling through the  courtyard and back passages, find their way to the kitchen fireplace,  where they would sleep in good fellowship. This chicken, I discovered,  had been stolen nearly two miles away. It is important to remark that  the cat, though a cruel bird-killer, never touched another chicken. Was  the idea of compensation in the cat's mind? If not that, all the  circumstances are singularly coincident. And why did the chicken prefer  the cat's companionship to that of its fellows?              E. W. PHIBBS.      ANOTHER PIGEON STORY.              [_Oct. 6, 1888._]    Mr. Ainger's letter in"]]]
