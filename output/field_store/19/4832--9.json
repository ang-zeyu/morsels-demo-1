At the time we speak of, Jews in Egypt, northern Africa, Italy, Spain,  France, and Germany were physicians in ordinary to caliphs, emperors,  and popes, and everywhere they are represented among medical writers.  The position occupied in the Arabian world by Israeli, in the Occident  was occupied by Sabattai Donnolo, one of the Salerno school in its early  obscure days, the author of a work on _Materia medica_, possibly the  oldest original production on medicine in the Hebrew language.    The period of Jewish prosperity in Spain has been called a fairy vision  of history. The culture developed under its genial influences pervaded  the middle ages, and projected suggestions even into our modern era. One  of the most renowned _savants_ at the beginning of the period was the  statesman Chasdai ben Shaprut, whose translation of Dioscorides's \"Plant  Lore\" served as the botanical textbook of mediaeval Europe. The first  poet was Solomon ibn Gabirol, the author of \"The Source of Life,\" a  systematic exposition of Neoplatonic philosophy, a book of most curious  fortunes. Through the Latin translation, made with the help of an  apostate Jew, and bearing the author's name in the mutilated form of  Avencebrol, later changed into Avicebron, scholasticism became saturated  with its philosophic ideas. The pious fathers of Christian philosophy,  Albertus Magnus and Thomas Aquinas, took pains to refute them, while  Duns Scotus and Giordano Bruno frequently consulted the work as an  authority. In the struggle between the Scotists and the Thomists it had  a prominent place as late as the fourteenth century, the contestants  taking it to be the work of some great Christian philosopher standing on  the threshold of the Occident and at the portals of philosophy. So it  happened that the author came down through the centuries, recognized by  none, forgotten by his own, until, in our time, behind the  Moorish-Christian mask of Avencebrol, Solomon Munk discovered the Jewish  thinker and poet Solomon ibn Gabirol.    The work _De Causis_, attributed to David, a forgotten Jewish  philosopher, must be classed with Gabirol's \"Source of Life,\" on account  of its Neoplatonism and its paramount influence upon scholasticism. In  fact, only by means of a searching analysis of these two works can  insight be gained into the development and aberrations of the dogmatic  system of mediaeval philosophy.    Other sciences, too, especially mathematics, flourished among them. One  century after he wrote them, the works of Abraham ibn Ezra, renowned as  an astronomer and mathematician, were translated into Latin by Italians,  among whom his prestige was so great that, as may still be seen, he was  painted among the expounders of mathematical science in an Italian  church fresco representing the seven liberal arts. Under the name  Abraham Judaeus, later corrupted into Avenare, he is met with throughout  the middle ages. Abraham ben Chiya, another distinguished scientist,  known by the name Savasorda, compiled the first systematic outline of  astronomy, and in his geographical treatise, he explained the sphericity  of the earth, while the Latin translation of his geometry, based on  Arabic sources, proves him to have made considerable additions to the  stock of knowledge in this branch. Moses Maimuni's intellectual vigor,  and his influence upon the schoolmen through his medical, and more  particularly his religio-philosophical works, are too well known to need  more than passing mention.    Even in southern France and in Germany, whither the light of culture did  not spread so rapidly as in Spain, Jews participated in the development  of the sciences. Solomon ben Isaac, called Rashi, the great exegete, was  looked up to as an authority by others beside his brethren in faith.  Nicolas de Lyra, one of the most distinguished Christian Bible exegetes,  confesses that his simple explanations of Scriptural passages are  derived pre-eminently from Rashi's Bible commentary, and among  scientific men it is acknowledged that precisely in the matter of  exegesis this French monk exercised decisive influence upon Martin  Luther. So it happens that in places Luther's Bible translation reveals  Rashi seen through Nicolas de Lyra's spectacles.    In the quickened intellectual life of Provence Jews also took active  part. David Kimchi has come to be regarded as the teacher _par  excellence_ of Hebrew grammar and lexicography, and Judah ibn Tibbon,  one of the most notable of translators, in his testament addressed to  his son made a complete presentation of contemporary science, a  cyclopaedia of the Arabic and the Hebrew language and literature,  grammar, poetry, botany, zoology, natural history, and particularly  religious philosophy, the studies of the Bible and the Talmud.    The golden age of letters was followed by a less creative period, a  significant turning-point in the history of Judaism as of spiritual  progress in general. The contest between tradition and philosophy  affected every mind. Literature was widely cultivated; each of its  departments found devotees. The European languages were studied, and  connections established between the literatures of the nations. Hardly a  spiritual current runs through the middle ages without, in some way,  affecting Jewish culture. It is the irony of history that puts among the  forty proscribers of the Talmud assembled at Paris in the thirteenth  century the Dominican Albertus Magnus, who, in his successful efforts to  divert scholastic philosophy into new channels, depended entirely upon  the writings and translations of the very Jews he was helping to  persecute. Schoolmen were too little conversant with Greek to read  Aristotle in the original, and so had to content themselves with  accepting the Judaeo-Arabic construction put upon the Greek sage's  teachings.    Besides acting as intermediaries, Jews made original contributions to  scholastic philosophy. For instance, Maimonides, the first to reconcile  Aristotle's teachings with biblical theology, was the originator of the  method adopted by schoolmen in the case of Aristotelian principles at  variance with their dogmas. Frederick II., the liberal emperor, employed  Jewish scholars and translators at his court; among them Jacob ben  Abba-Mari ben Anatoli, to whom an annuity was paid for translating  Aristotelian works. Michael Scotus, the imperial astrologer, was his  intimate friend. His contemporaries were chiefly popular philosophers or  mystics, excepting only the prominent Provencal Jacob ben Machir, or  Profatius Judaeus, as he was called, a member of the Tibbon family of  translators. His observations on the inclination of the earth's axis  were used later by Copernicus as the basis of further investigations. He  was a famous teacher at the Montpellier academy, which reminds me to  mention that Jews were prominently identified with the founding and the  success of the medical schools at Montpellier and Salerno, they, indeed,  being almost the only physicians in all parts of the known world.  Salerno, in turn, suggests Italy, where at that period translations were  made from Latin into Hebrew. Hillel ben Samuel, for instance, the same  who carried on a lively philosophic correspondence with another  distinguished Jew, Maestro Isaac Gayo, the pope's physician, translated  some of Thomas Aquinas's writings, Bruno di Lungoburgo's book on  surgery, and various other works, from Latin into Hebrew.    These successors of the great intellects of the golden age of  neo-Hebraic literature, thoroughly conversant with Arabic literature,  busied themselves with rendering accessible to literary Europe the  treasury of Indian and Greek fables. Their translations and compilations  have peculiar value in the history of literary development. During the  middle ages, when the memory of ancient literature had perished, they  were the means of preserving the romances, fairy tales, and fables that  have descended, by way of Spain and Arabia, from classical antiquity  and the many-hued Oriental world to our modern literatures. Between the  eleventh and the thirteenth century, the foundations were laid for our  narrative literature, demonstrating the importance of delight in fable  lore, stories of travel, and all sorts of narratives, for to it we owe  the creation of new and the transformation of old, literary forms.    In Germany at that time, a Jewish minnesinger and strolling minstrel,  Suesskind von Trimberg, went up and down the land, from castle to castle,  with the poets' guild; while Santob di Carrion, a Jewish troubadour,  ventured to impart counsel and moral lessons to the Castilian king Don  Pedro before his assembled people. A century later, another Jew, Samson  Pnie, of Strasburg, lent his assistance to the two German poets at work  upon the continuation of _Parzival_. The historians of German literature  have not laid sufficient stress upon the share of the Jews, heavily  oppressed and persecuted though they were, in the creation of national  epics and romances of chivalry from the thirteenth to the fifteenth  century. German Jews, being more than is generally recognized diligent  readers of the poets, were well acquainted with the drift of mediaeval  poetry, and to this familiarity a new department of Jewish literature  owed its rise and development. It is said that a Hebrew version of the  Arthurian cycle was made as early as the thirteenth century, and at the  end of the period we run across epic poems on Bible characters, composed  in the _Nibelungen_ metre, in imitation of old German legend lore and  national poetry.    If German Jews found heart for literary interests, it may be assumed as  a matter of course that Spanish and Provencal Jews participated in the  advancement of their respective national literatures and in Troubadour  poetry. In these countries, too, the new taste for"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27911"],[0,"The Giraffe Hunters (#12)"],[1,"night, making fourteen hippopotami  killed within twenty-four hours.  This was a greater number, so Macora  said, than had been killed by his own people within the two preceding  years.        CHAPTER SEVENTEEN.    TO THE GIRAFFE COUNTRY.    After passing some four or five weeks in hippopotamus hunting, Groot  Willem became anxious to engage in the real business for which he had  undertaken the hunting expedition.    They had collected more than seven hundred pounds' weight of the finest  ivory, but this success did not hinder them from becoming weary of a  pursuit that was no longer amusement, but business.    From several conversations held with Macora about giraffes, they had  learnt that the young of those animals could not be taken alive without  the greatest ingenuity and trouble.    Where camelopards are discovered they can easily be run down and shot;  but to secure the young unharmed, is a different affair, and an  undertaking, which, from Macora's account, promised to occupy all the  time that the hunters wished to remain away from Graaf Reinet.    Groot Willem was anxious to secure the name, fame, and reward, now  depending on the delivery of the two young giraffes to the Dutch Consul.  Hendrik and Arend wished to return to their sweethearts; and Hans was  longing to under take his intended voyage to Europe.    Under these circumstances, a proposal from Willem, that they should make  a move, was well received by all.    When the intention and object of their leaving was made known to Macora,  the chief seemed in much trouble.    \"I cannot allow you to go alone,\" said he; \"there would be danger in  your journey to my native land, perhaps death.  Instead of capturing  camelopards alive, you might leave your bones to bleach upon the plain.  You must not go alone.  Though we may not procure what you are in search  of, I shall be your companion, and my best warriors shall attend you.  The tyrant Moselekatse may destroy us all, but I will go.  Macora will  not allow his friends to encounter the peril without sharing it with  them.  To-morrow I shall be ready with all my men.\"    Such was the substance of Macora's speech, as interpreted by Congo; and  the young hunters, much as they respected the chief for his many acts of  kindness towards them, were gratified by this new proof of his  friendship.    He proposed to forsake his home and undertake an expedition of nearly  two hundred miles, in which he had nothing to gain and everything to  lose.  This he was willing to do, out of gratitude to one whom fate had  brought to his assistance through the merest accident.    Macora's offer was not rejected; and preparations for the journey were  immediately commenced.    The ivory obtained from the hippopotami was stored away for safe keeping  until their return.    This was about the only preparation for a departure our adventurers had  to make; but such was not the case with Macora's warriors.  Poisoned  arrows had to be prepared, bows and shields repaired, and assegais  sharpened.    On the morning of the next day after Macora had determined on the  journey, he led forth from his village fifty-three of his best men; and  a start was made towards the North.    Several oxen were taken along, laden with dried hippopotamus flesh,  crushed maize, and other articles of food to be used on the journey.  Several cows were also driven along to yield a supply of milk.    One of the pack-horses belonging to our hunters had been placed at the  disposal of the chief; and on this he rode, generally keeping close by  the side of Groot Willem.    Owing to the nature of the country, and the inability of the oxen for  fast travelling, their progress was but slow.    They found plenty of game along the route, but none of it was pursued  for the sake of amusement.  Only a sufficient quantity was killed to  provide the camp with fresh meat, and no time was lost in procuring it,  as antelopes were constantly coming within shot of the hunters, as they  moved along the line of march.    Only one incident worthy of notice occurred during the journey, in their  camp of the sixth night after starting.  One of the Makololo had risen  to put some fresh fagots on a fire burning near him.  Placing his hand  upon the ground for the purpose of picking up a piece of wood, he  suddenly started back, at the same time uttering a cry of terror.    Several of his companions sprang to their feet; and, for a moment, a  scene of confusion ensued that baffled every attempt on the part of the  young hunters to obtain an explanation of it.  At length, it transpired  that a snake had caused the commotion.  One of about eight feet in  length was dragged up to the light of the fire and submitted to  examination.  It was writhing in the agonies of death.  Its head had  been crushed by a blow.  Its colour, which was nearly black, left no  doubt in the minds of the natives as to the nature of the reptile they  had killed.    \"Picakholu! picakholu!\" exclaimed several at the same time, and their  attention was immediately turned to the man who had first made its  acquaintance.    He exhibited two deep scratches on the back of his right hand.  On  beholding them, his companions uttered a cry of commiseration, and stood  gazing at the unfortunate man with an expression that seemed to say:  \"_You must surely die_.\"    His colour soon changed to a deeper brown.  Then his fingers and lips  began to move spasmodically, and his eyes assumed a fixed and glassy  expression.    In about ten minutes from the time he had been bitten, he seemed quite  unconscious of anything but agony; and would have rolled into the fire,  had he not been held back by those around him.    In less than half an hour, he was dead,--dead, while the body of the  serpent with the mangled head was still writhing along the grass.    The Makololo was buried at sunrise, three hours after death; and so  virulent is the poison of the picakholu that, ere the body was deposited  in the grave, it was already in a state of decomposition!        CHAPTER EIGHTEEN.    A GIRAFFE CHASE.    In the evening of the twelfth day after leaving the Limpopo, they  reached a small river, which Macora called the Luize.  He informed the  hunters, that one day's journey down this stream would take him to the  ruins of the village where he had been born and had lived until within  the last two or three years, and his desire to see his native place was  about to be gratified.    On one thing Macora could congratulate himself.  The chief Moselekatse,  by driving him from his country, had profited but little.  All the  Makololo cattle and other objects of plunder had been safely got away  out of reach of the robber chief.  None of Macora's people had remained  in the land, so that there was no one to pay tribute to the conqueror;  and the country had been left to the undisturbed possession of the wild  beasts.    Macora's tribe were not now living in a conquered condition; nor were  they now prevented from paying a visit to their former home.    The plan proposed by the Makololo chief for catching the young giraffes,  was to build a _hopo_ or trap, in some convenient place where a herd of  giraffes might be driven into it,--the old ones killed and the young  ones secured alive.    No better plan could be devised than this, and it was unanimously  adopted.    A site for the _hopo_ has to be chosen with some judgment, so that  labour may be saved in its construction; and, satisfied that the chief  would act for the best, the hunters determined on leaving to him all the  arrangements regarding it.    A suitable place for the trap, Macora remembered having seen, a few  miles down the river; and thither they repaired.    On the way, they passed the ruins of the deserted village, and many of  the natives recognised amid the heaps of rubbish the places that had  once been their homes.    Five miles farther down, they reached the place which was to be enclosed  as a hopo.  It was a narrow valley or pass, leading from a large forest  to the river-bank,--and the variety and quantity of spoor over its  surface, proved that most animals of the country daily passed through  it.    The forest consisted chiefly of mimosa-trees, whose leaves are the  favourite food of the giraffe.  Plenty of other timber was growing near,  such as would be needed in constructing the required inclosure.    Macora promised that his people should go to work on the following day;  when pits should be dug and trees felled for the fence of the hopo.    Willem inquired if they had not better first make sure that giraffes  were in the neighbourhood, before expending their labour in constructing  the trap.  This Macora declared was not necessary.  He was quite certain  that they would be found by the time the trap was ready for receiving  them.  He also advised the hunters to refrain from molesting any  giraffes they might see before the inclosure should be completed, which,  according to his calculation, would be in about two weeks.    The hunters now began to understand the difficulties of the task they  had undertaken, and were thankful for the good fortune that had brought  them the assistance of the Makololo chief.  But for him and his people,  it would have been idle for them to have attempted taking the giraffes  alive.    Well mounted, they might ride them down and shoot as many as they  pleased, but this would have been but poor sport; and even Groot Willem  would, in due time, have got tired of it.  It was not for this they had  come so far.    Next morning, the work of making the hopo was commenced; and to inspire  the young hunters with the hope that the labour would not be in vain,  Macora showed them the spoor of a drove of giraffes that had visited the  river during the night.    The chief would not allow his guests to take any part in the toil, and  unwilling to be idle, Groot Willem, Hendrik, and Arend determined on  making an excursion down the river. "]]]
