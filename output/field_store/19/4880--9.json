White Sugar.    2 lbs. Glucose.    3 pints Water.    Vanilla Flavoring.    PROCESS.--Dissolve the sugar with water in a clean pan; add the glucose  and boil in the usual way to the degree of feather, 243; pour the  contents on a damp slab; let it remain a few minutes to cool; then with  a pallette knife work it up to white cream, adding a tint of blue to  bleach it; when the whole has become a smooth cream, return it to the  pan and melt it just sufficient that it may pour out smooth and level;  stir in the flavor and run on pouring plate 1/2 inch thick; when set  cut into bars.      RASPBERRY OR ROSE CREAM BARS.      7 lbs. White Sugar.    2 lbs. Glucose.    3 pints Water.    Raspberry or Rose Flavor.    PROCESS.--Melt the sugar in the water, add the glucose and boil to 243;  pour contents on slab, and when cool divide the boil into three parts;  color one part red, add some pure chocolate to another, and to a third  add a pinch of blue, cream each part by rubbing on slab to a smooth  paste; in rubbing in the pure chocolate, see that you have enough to  make it a rich brown; for red portion use just sufficient to give a  light rose pink. When all finished, melt each portion separately in the  pan just sufficiently soft to run to a level surface; pour out first the  red, then the chocolate on top of red sheet, then the white on top of  chocolate; this will make a cream cake to cut up into bars. Some do not  take the trouble to melt the cream, being satisfied to spread the paste  out, smoothing it on top with a pallette knife; this answers the purpose  but does not look so well.      COCOANUT CREAM.      7 lbs. White Sugar.    3 lbs. Cocoanut peeled and sliced.    2 lbs. Glucose.    Red Coloring.    3 pints Water.    PROCESS.--Boil the sugar, glucose and water in the usual way to the  degree 245; pour contents on slab; divide the boil into two lots; when  cool, color one part light pink and put a small touch of blue in the  other; add the sliced cocoanut, half into each part, then commence to  cream them by rubbing. When both parts have been mixed into a smooth  paste, it is ready for sale, being usually sold by cutting from rough  block.    N.B.--Cut almonds, ground walnuts, etc., are used in the same way as  directed for cocoanuts. The boils may or may not be flavored, but a  little improves it and makes it fragrant.      MAPLE CREAM.      8 lbs. Yellow Sugar.    1 quart Sweet Cream.    2 lbs. Glucose.    PROCESS.--Boil the sugar, glucose and cream to 242 on thermometer,  stirring all the time; when done lift off the fire and let stand till  nearly cold (placing it where it will cool quickly), then stir until it  sets; then melt over a slow fire (stirring constantly) until it becomes  a nice creamy consistency, pour on a well greased tin, lay about one  inch deep, let stand till cold, when by turning over the tin it will  fall out. After the batch is set to cool in the tin, on no account  disturb it as it will make the cream crack into pieces when turning out.  If this is too expensive a recipe use milk instead of cream and add half  a pound of butter.      CHRISTMAS PUDDING (IMITATION).      7 lbs. White Sugar.    1 lb. Raisins.    1/2 lb. Sweet Almonds blanched chopped.    1 lb. Currants.    1 lb. Sultanas.    1/2 lb. Mixed Peel.    1 oz. Mixed Spice.    2 pints Water.    PROCESS.--Prepare fruit by washing currants in cold water, afterwards  drying them; stone raisins; blanch and chop almonds; cut the peel in  stripes, then mix them together, adding the spice; boil the sugar and  water to ball degree; remove the pan from the fire: grain the boil by  rubbing the syrup against the side of the pan in the usual way; when it  becomes creamy, add the mixed fruit, carefully stirring the whole until  thoroughly incorporated; have some wet cloths ready, into which divide  the boil; tie them very tight and hang them up until set hard. The  blanched almonds are used to represent suet and should be chopped  accordingly.      BROWN CREAM PUDDING.      7 lbs. Brown Sugar.    2 lbs. Glucose.    1 lb. Currants.    1/2 lb. Sultanas.    1/2 lb. Raisins.    1/2 lb. Mixed Peel.    1/2 oz. Mixed Spice.    2 pints Water.

The cattle were mine, the horses were my brother's, and in transferring  his allegiance from the cow-stable to the horse-stable Bingo seemed to  give me up too, and anything like daily companionship ceased, and yet,  whenever any emergency arose Bingo turned to me and I to him, and both  seemed to feel that the bond between man and dog is one that lasts as  long as life.    The only other occasion on which Bingo acted as cowherd was in the  autumn of the same year at the annual Carberry Fair. Among the dazzling  inducements to enter one's stock there was, in addition to a prospect of  glory, a cash prize of 'two dollars' for the 'best collie in training'.    Misled by a false friend, I entered Bingo, and early on the day fixed,  the cow was driven to the prairie just outside of the village. When the  time came she was pointed out to Bingo and the word given--'Go fetch the  cow.' It was the intention, of course, that he should bring her to me at  the judge's stand.    But the animals knew better. They hadn't rehearsed all summer for  nothing. When Dunne saw Bingo's careering form she knew that her only  hope for safety was to get into her stable, and Bingo was equally sure  that his sole mission in life was to quicken her pace in that direction.  So off they raced over the prairie, like a wolf after a deer, and  heading straight toward their home two miles way, they disappeared from  view.    That was the last that judge or jury ever saw of dog or cow. The prize  was awarded to the only other entry.    III    Bingo's loyalty to the horses was quite remarkable; by day he trotted  beside them, and by night he slept at the stable door. Where the team  went Bingo went, and nothing kept him away from them. This interesting  assumption of ownership lent the greater significance to the following  circumstance.    I was not superstitious, and up to this time had had no faith in omens,  but was now deeply impressed by a strange occurrence in which Bingo took  a leading part. There were but two of us now living on the De Winton  Farm. One morning my brother set out for Boggy Creek for a load of hay.  It was a long day's journey there and back, and he made an early start.  Strange to tell, Bingo for once in his life did not follow the team. My  brother called to him, but still he stood at a safe distance, and eyeing  the team askance, refused to stir. Suddenly he raised his nose in the  air and gave vent to a long, melancholy howl. He watched the wagon out  of sight, and even followed for a hundred yards or so, raising his voice  from time to time in the most doleful howlings.    All that day he stayed about the barn, the only time that he was  willingly separated from the horses, and at intervals howled a very  death dirge. I was alone, and the dog's behavior inspired me with an  awful foreboding of calamity, that weighed upon us more and more as the  hours passed away.    About six o'clock Bingo's howlings became unbearable, so that for lack  of a better thought I threw something at him, and ordered him away. But  oh, the feeling of horror that filled me! Why did I let my brother go  away alone? Should I ever again see him alive? I might have known from  the dog's actions that something dreadful was about to happen.    At length the hour for his return arrived, and there was John on his  load. I took charge of the horses, vastly relieved, and with an air of  assumed unconcern, asked, \"All right?\"    \"Right,\" was the laconic answer.    Who now can say that there is nothing in omens?    And yet when, long afterward, I told this to one skilled in the occult,  he looked grave, and said, \"Bingo always turned to you in a crisis?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Then do not smile. It was you that were in danger that day; he stayed  and saved your life, though you never knew from what.\"    IV    Early in the spring I had begun Bingo's education. Very shortly  afterward he began mine.    Midway on the two-mile stretch of prairie that lay between our shanty  and the village of Carberry, was the corner-stake of the farm; it was a  stout post in a low mound of earth, and was visible from afar.    I soon noticed that Bingo never passed without minutely examining this  mysterious post. Next I learned that it was also visited by the prairie  wolves as well as by all the dogs in the neighborhood, and at length,  with the aid of a telescope, I made a number of observations that helped  me to an understanding of the matter and enabled me to enter more fully  into Bingo's private life.    The post was by common agreement a registry of the canine tribes. Their  exquisite sense of smell enabled each individual to tell at once by the  track and trace what other had recently been at the post. When the snow  came much more was revealed. I then discovered that this post was but  one of a system that covered the country; that, in short, the entire  region was laid out in signal stations at convenient intervals. These  were marked by any conspicuous post, stone, buffalo skull, or other  object that chanced to be in the desired locality, and extensive  observation showed that it was a very complete system for getting and  giving the news.    Each dog or wolf makes a point of calling at those stations that are  near his line of travel to learn who has recently been there, just as a  man calls at his club on returning to town and looks up the register.    I have seen Bingo approach the post, sniff, examine the ground about,  then growl, and with bristling mane and glowing eyes, scratch fiercely  and contemptuously with his hind feet, finally walking off very stiffly,  glancing back from time to time. All of which, being interpreted, said:    \"Grrrh! woof! there's that dirty cur of McCarthy's. Woof! I'll 'tend to  him tonight. Woof! woof!\" On another occasion, after the preliminaries,  he became keenly interested and studied a coyote's track that came and  went, saying to himself, as I afterward learned:    \"A coyote track coming from the north, smelling of dead cow. Indeed?  Pollworth's old Brindle must be dead at last. This is worth looking  into.\"    At other times he would wag his tail, trot about the vicinity and come  again and again to make his own visit more evident, perhaps for the  benefit of his brother Bill just back from Brandon! So that it was not  by chance that one night Bill turned up at Bingo's home and was taken  to the hills, where a delicious dead horse afforded a chance to suitably  celebrate the reunion.    At other times he would be suddenly aroused by the news, take up the  trail, and race to the next station for later information.    Sometimes his inspection produced only an air of grave attention, as  though he said to himself, \"Dear me, who the deuce is this?\" or \"It  seems to me I met that fellow at the Portage last summer.\"    One morning on approaching the post Bingo's every hair stood on end, his  tail dropped and quivered, and he gave proof that he was suddenly sick  at the stomach, sure signs of terror. He showed no desire to follow up  or know more of the matter, but returned to the house, and half an hour  afterward his mane was still bristling and his expression one of hate or  fear.    I studied the dreaded track and learned that in Bingo's language the  half-terrified, deep-gurgled 'grr-wff' means 'timber wolf.'    These were among the things that Bingo taught me. And in the after time  when I might chance to see him arouse from his frosty nest by the stable  door, and after stretching himself and shaking the snow from his shaggy  coat, disappear into the gloom at a steady trot, trot, trot, I used to  think:    \"Ahh! old dog, I know where you are off to, and why you eschew the  shelter of the shanty. Now I know why your nightly trips over the  country are so well timed, and how you know just where to go for what  you want, and when and how to seek it.\"    V    In the autumn of 1884, the shanty at De Winton farm was closed and Bingo  changed his home to the establishment--that is, to the stable, not the  house--of Gordon Wright, our most intimate neighbor.    Since the winter of his puppyhood he had declined to enter a house at  any time excepting during a thunderstorm. Of thunder and guns he had a  deep dread--no doubt the fear of the first originated in the second, and  that arose from some unpleasant shot-gun experiences, the cause of which  will be seen. His nightly couch was outside the stable, even during  the coldest weather, and it was easy to see he enjoyed to the full  the complete nocturnal liberty entailed. Bingo's midnight wanderings  extended across the plains for miles. There was plenty of proof of this.  Some farmers at very remote points sent word to old Gordon that if  he did not keep his dog home nights, they would use the shot-gun, and  Bingo's terror of firearms would indicate that the threats were not  idle. A man living as far away as Petrel said he saw a large black wolf  kill a coyote on the snow one winter evening, but afterward he changed  his opinion and 'reckoned it must 'a' been Wright's dog.' Whenever  the body of a winter-killed ox or horse was exposed, Bingo was sure  to repair to it nightly, and driving away the prairie wolves, feast to  repletion.    Sometimes the object of a night foray was merely to maul some distant  neighbor's dog, and notwithstanding vengeful threats, there seemed no  reason to fear that the Bingo breed would die out. One man even avowed  that he had seen a prairie wolf accompanied by three young ones which  resembled the mother, excepting that they were very large and black and  had a ring of white around the muzzle.    True or not as that may be, I know that late in March, while we were  out in the sleigh with Bingo trotting behind, a prairie wolf was started  from a hollow. Away it went with Bingo in full chase, but the wolf did  not greatly exert itself to escape, and within a short distance Bingo  was close up, yet"]]]
