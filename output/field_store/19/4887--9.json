He worked with stock as a very young boy       and this was his duty during and after the Civil War, as he       remained with his boss for three years after emancipation. He then       came to old Ben Ficklin four miles south of the present San Angelo,       Texas, when it was the county seat of Tom Green County and before       there was a San Angelo. He continued his work on ranches here and       has never done any other kind of work. For the past several years       he has been very feeble and has made his home with a daughter in       San Angelo, Texas.      Jack who was assisted out of bed and dressed by his grandson, hobbled in  on his cane and said, \"I was jes' a small boy workin' on de ranch when I  hear talk 'bout conscription' de men for de war what was agoin' to set  de slaves free. We didn' know hardly what dey was a talkin' 'bout 'cause  we knowed dat would be too good to be true. I jes' keeps on workin' wid  my hosses and my cattle (dere wasn't no sheep den) jes' like dere wasn't  no war, 'cause dat was all I ever knowed how to do.    \"Our ole marster, he wasn't so very mean to us, course he whips us once  and awhile but dat wasn't like de slave holders what had dem colored  drivers. Dey sho' was rough on de slaves. I's been told lots 'bout de  chains and de diffe'nt punishments but our treatment wasn't so bad. Our  beds was pretty good when we uses dem. Lots of de time we jes' sleeps on  de groun', 'specially in summer.    \"Our log huts was comfortable and we had some kind of floors in all of  dem. Some was plank and some was poles but dat was better den de dirt  floors some cabins have.    \"De eats we have was jes' good eats, lots of meats and vegetables and de  like; 'possum and coon and beef and pork all cooked good. Our clothes  was jes' home spun like all de others.    \"We didn' have such a big ranch and not many slaves but we all gits  along. We learns a little 'bout readin' and writin'.    \"I don't 'member any camp meetin's 'til after de war. We had a few den  and on Christmas times we jes' tears up de country. Lawdy! Lawd! Dat  fiddlin' went on all night, and we dance awhile den lay down and sleeps,  den gits up and dances some mo'e. We would have big cakes and  everything good to eat.    \"When we gits sick dey jes' gives us some kind of tea, mostly made from  weeds. Mos' of de time we gits well.    \"When de news comes dat we was free our boss, he say, 'You free now.'  Course we was glad but we didn' know nothin' to do but jes' stay on  dere, and we did 'bout three years and de boss pays us a little by de  month for our work.    \"I's lef' dere den and comes to old Ben Ficklin to work on a ranch.

Now I's  jes' stayin' 'round wid my chillun and dey takes good care of me.\"          420170           ELLEN BETTS, 118 N. Live Oak St., Houston, Texas, is 84. All of her       people and their masters came from Virginia and settled in       Louisiana about 1853. Her grandparents belonged to the Green family       and her parents, Charity and William Green, belonged to Tolas       Parsons. Ellen lives with friends who support her. Her sole       belonging is an old trunk and she carries the key on a string       around her neck.      \"I got borned on de Bayou Teche, clost to Opelousas. Dat in St. Mary's  Parish, in Louisiana, and I belonged to Tolas Parsons, what had 'bout  500 slaves, countin' de big ones and de little ones, and he had God know  what else. When my eyes jes' barely fresh open, Marse Tolas die and will  de hull lot of us to he brother, William Tolas. And I tells you dat  Marse William am de greates' man what ever walk dis earth. Dat's de  truth. I can't lie on him when de pore man's in he grave.    \"When a whuppin' got to be done, old Marse do it heself. He don't 'low  no overseer to throw he gals down and pull up dere dress and whup on  dere bottoms like I hear tell some of 'em do.

Don't hit one dem niggers for God's sake, or Parsons sho' eat your  jacket up.'    \"Aunt Rachel what cook in de big house for Miss Cornelia had four  young'uns and dem chillen fat and slick as I ever seen. All de niggers  have to stoop to Aunt Rachel jes' like dey curtsy to Missy. I mind de  time her husband, Uncle Jim, git mad and hit her over de head with de  poker. A big knot raise up on Aunt Rachel's head and when Marse 'quire  'bout it, she say she done bump de head. She dassn't tell on Uncle Jim  or Marse sho' beat him. Marse sho' proud dem black, slick chillen of  Rachels. You couldn't find a yaller chile on he place. He sho' got no  use for mixin' black and white.    \"Marse William have de pretties' place up and down dat bayou, with de  fine house and fine trees and sech. From where we live it's five mile to  Centerville one way and five mile to Patterson t'other. Dey hauls de  lumber from one place or t'other to make wood houses for de slaves.  Sometime Marse buy de furniture and sometime de carpenter make it.    \"Miss Sidney was Marse's first wife and he had six boys by her. Den he  marry de widow Cornelius and she give him four boys. With ten chillen  springin' up quick like dat and all de cullud chillen comin' 'long fast  as pig litters, I don't do nothin' all my days, but nuss, nuss, nuss.

De louder day bawl  de louder I bawl. Sometime when Marse hear de babies cry, he come down  and say, 'Why de chillen cry like dat, Ellen?' I say, 'Marse, I git so  hongry and tired I done drink de milk up.'

He plant little  bitty patches close to de house and each li'l nigger have a patch and he  work it till it got growed. Marse have de house girls make popcorn for  'em and candy.    \"I nuss de sick folks too. Sometime I dose with Blue Mass pills and  sometime Dr. Fawcett leave rhubarb and ipicac and calomel and castor oil  and sech.

It is indeed marvelous that in the latitude of the northern United  States and southern Canada so many circumstances favorable to human  happiness are combined. Fertile soil, level plains, easy passage across  the mountains, coal, iron, and other metals imbedded in the rocks, and  a stimulating climate, all shower their blessings upon man. And with all  these blessings goes the advantage of a coast which welcomes the mariner  and brings the stimulus of foreign lands, while at the same time it  affords rest and inspiration to the toilers here at home.        CHAPTER IV. THE GARMENT OF VEGETATION    No part of the world can be truly understood without a knowledge of its  garment of vegetation, for this determines not only the nature of the  animal inhabitants but also the occupations of the majority of  human beings. Although the soil has much to do with the character of  vegetation, climate has infinitely more. It is temperature which causes  the moss and lichens of the barren tundras in the far north to be  replaced by orchids, twining vines, and mahogany trees near the equator.  It is rainfall which determines that vigorous forests shall grow in the  Appalachians in latitudes where grasslands prevail in the plains and  deserts in the western cordillera.    Forests, grass-lands, deserts, represent the three chief types of  vegetation on the surface of the earth. Each is a response to certain  well-defined conditions of climate. Forests demand an abundance of  moisture throughout the entire season of growth. Where this season  lasts only three months the forest is very different from where it lasts  twelve. But no forest can be vigorous if the ground habitually becomes  dry for a considerable period during which the weather is warm enough  for growth. Desert vegetation, on the other hand, which consists  primarily of bushes with small, drought-resistant leaves, needs only a  few irregular and infrequent showers in order to endure long periods  of heat and drought. Discontinuity of moisture is the cause of deserts,  just as continuity is the necessary condition of forest growth. Grasses  prevail where the climatic conditions are intermediate between those of  the forest and the desert. Their primary requisite is a short period of  fairly abundant moisture with warmth enough to ripen their seeds. Unlike  the trees of the forests, they thrive even though the wet period be only  a fraction of the entire time that is warm enough for growth. Unlike  the bushes of the desert, they rarely thrive unless the ground is  well soaked for at least a few weeks. Most people think of forests as  offering far more variety than either deserts or grass-lands. To them  grass is just grass, while trees seem to possess individuality. In  reality, however, the short turfy grass of the far north differs from  the four-foot fronds of the bunchy saccaton grass of Arizona, and from  the far taller tufts of the plumed pampas grass, much more than the pine  tree differs from the palm. Deserts vary even more than either forests  or grass-lands. The traveler in the Arizona desert, for example, has  been jogging across a gravelly plain studded at intervals of a few yards  with little bushes a foot high. The scenery is so monotonous and the  noon sunshine so warm that he almost falls asleep. When he wakes from  his daydream, so weird are his surroundings that he thinks he must be in  one of the places to which Sindbad was carried by the roc. The trail has  entered an open forest of joshuas, as the big tree yuccas are called in  Arizona. Their shaggy trunks and uncouth branches are rendered doubly  unkempt by swordlike, ashy-yellow dead leaves that double back on the  trunk but refuse to fall to the ground. At a height of from twelve to  twenty feet each arm of the many-branched candelabrum ends in a stiff  rosette of gray-green spiky leaves as tough as hemp. Equally bizarre and  much more imposing is a desert \"stand\" of giant suhuaros, great fluted  tree-cacti thirty feet or more high. In spite of their size the suhuaros  are desert types as truly as is sagebrush.    In America the most widespread type of forest is the evergreen  coniferous woodland of the north. Its pines, firs, spruces, hemlocks,  and cedars which are really junipers, cover most of Canada together with  northern New England and the region south of Lakes Huron and Superior.  At its northern limit the forest looks thoroughly forlorn. The gnarled  and stunted trees are thickly studded with half-dead branches bent down  by the weight of snow, so that the lower ones sweep the ground, while  the upper look tired and discouraged from their struggle with an  inclement climate. Farther south, however, the forest loses this  aspect of terrific struggle. In Maine, for example, it gives a pleasant  impression of comfortable prosperity. Wherever the trees have room to  grow, they are full and stocky, and even where they are crowded together  their slender upspringing trunks look alert and energetic. The signs  of death and decay, indeed, appear everywhere in fallen trunks, dead  branches, and decayed masses of wood, but moss and lichens, twinflowers  and bunchberries so quickly mantle the prostrate trees that they do not  seem like tokens of weakness. Then, too, in every open space thousands  of young trees bank their soft green masses so gracefully that one has  an ever-present sense of pleased surprise as he comes upon this younger  foliage out of the dim aisles among the bigger trees.    Except on their southern borders the great northern forests are not good  as a permanent home for man. The snow lies so late in the spring and the  summers are so short and cool that agriculture does not prosper. As a  home for the fox, marten, weasel, beaver, and many other fur-bearing  animals, however, the coniferous forests are almost ideal. That is why  the Hudson's Bay Company is one of the few great organizations which  have persisted and prospered from colonial times to the present. As long  ago as 1670 Charles II granted to Prince Rupert and seventeen noblemen  and gentlemen a charter so sweeping that, aside from their own powers  of assimilation, there was almost no limit to what the \"Governor and  Company of Adventurers of England trading into Hudson's Bay\" might  acquire. By 1749, nearly eighty years after the granting of the charter,  however, the Company had only four or five forts on the coast of Hudson  Bay, with about 120 regular employees. Nevertheless the poor Indians  were so ignorant of the value of their furs and the consequent profits  were so large that, after Canada had been ceded to Great Britain in  1763, a rival organization, the Northwest Fur Company of Montreal, was  established. Then there began an era that was truly terrible for the  Indians of the northern forest. In their eagerness to get the valuable  furs the companies offered the Indians strong liquors in an abundance  that ruined the poor red man, body and soul. Moreover the fur-bearing  animals were killed not only in winter but during the breeding season.  Many mother animals were shot and their little ones were left to die.  Hence in a short time the wild creatures of the great northern forest  were so scarce that the Indians well-nigh starved.    In spite of this slaughter of fur-bearing animals, the same Company  still draws fat dividends from the northern forest and its furry  inhabitants. If the forest had been more habitable, it would long ago  have been occupied by settlers, as have its warmer, southern portions,  and the Company would have ceased to exist. Aside from the regions too  cold or too dry to support any vegetation whatever, few parts of the  world are more deadening to civilization than the forests of the far  north. Near the northern limit of the great evergreen forest of North  America wild animals are so rare that a family of hunting Indians can  scarcely find a living in a thousand square miles. Today the voracious  maw of the daily newspaper is eating the spruce and hemlock by means of  relentless saws and rattling pulp-mills. In the wake of the lumbermen  settlers are tardily spreading northward from the more favored tracts  in northern New England and southern Canada. Nevertheless most of the  evergreen forests of the north must always remain the home of wild  animals and trappers, a backward region in which it is easy for a great  fur company to maintain a practical monopoly.    Outliers of the pine forest extend far down into the United States. The  easternmost lies in part along the Appalachians and in part along the  coastal plain from southern New Jersey to Texas. The coastal forest  is unlike the other coniferous forests in two respects, for its  distribution and growth are not limited by long winters but by sandy  soil which quickly becomes dry. This drier southern pine forest lacks  the beauty of its northern companion. Its trees are often tall and  stately, but they are usually much scattered and are surrounded by  stretches of scanty grass. There is no trace of the mossy carpet and  dense copses of undergrowth that add so much to the picturesqueness of  the forests farther north. The unkempt half-breed or Indian hunter  is replaced by the prosaic gatherer of turpentine. As the man of the  southern forests shuffles along in blue or khaki overalls and carries  his buckets from tree to tree, he seems a dull figure contrasted with  the active northern hunter who glides swiftly and silently from trap to  trap on his rawhide snowshoes. Yet though the southern pine forest may  be less picturesque than the northern, it is more useful to man. In  spite of its sandy soil, much of this forest land is being reclaimed,  and all will some day probably be covered by farms.    Two other outliers of the northern evergreen forest extend southward  along the cool heights of the Rocky Mountains and of the Pacific coast  ranges of the United"]]]
