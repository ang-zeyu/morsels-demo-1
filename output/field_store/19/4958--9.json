Some  shrapnel burst over us and scattered on all sides. I felt as if a hail  storm was coming down, and wanted to turn my back, but it was over in  an instant. The whistle of a shell is unpleasant. You hear it begin  to scream; the scream grows louder and louder; it seems to be coming  exactly your way; then you realize that it has gone over. Most of them  fell between our guns and wagons. Our position was quite in the open.          With Ian Hamilton's column near Balmoral.      The day was cold, much like a December day at home, and by my kit going  astray I had only light clothing. The rain was fearfully chilly. When we  got in about dark we found that the transport could not come up, and it  had all our blankets and coats. I had my cape and a rubber sheet for  the saddle, both soaking wet. Being on duty I held to camp, the others  making for the house nearby where they got poor quarters. I bunked out,  supperless like every one else, under an ammunition wagon. It rained  most of the night and was bitterly cold. I slept at intervals, keeping  the same position all night, both legs in a puddle and my feet being  rained on: it was a long night from dark at 5.30 to morning. Ten men  in the infantry regiment next us died during the night from exposure.  Altogether I never knew such a night, and with decent luck hope never to  see such another.      As we passed we saw the Connaughts looking at the graves of their  comrades of twenty years ago. The Battery rode at attention and gave  \"Eyes right\": the first time for twenty years that the roll of a British  gun has broken in on the silence of those unnamed graves.    We were inspected by Lord Roberts. The battery turned out very smart,  and Lord Roberts complimented the Major on its appearance. He then  inspected, and afterwards asked to have the officers called out. We were  presented to him in turn; he spoke a few words to each of us, asking  what our corps and service had been. He seemed surprised that we were  all Field Artillery men, but probably the composition of the other  Canadian units had to do with this. He asked a good many questions about  the horses, the men, and particularly about the spirits of the men.  Altogether he showed a very kind interest in the battery.      At nine took the Presbyterian parade to the lines, the first  Presbyterian service since we left Canada. We had the right, the Gordons  and the Royal Scots next. The music was excellent, led by the brass band  of the Royal Scots, which played extremely well. All the singing was  from the psalms and paraphrases: \"Old Hundred\" and \"Duke Street\"  among them. It was very pleasant to hear the old reliables once more.  \"McCrae's Covenanters\" some of the officers called us; but I should not  like to set our conduct up against the standard of those austere men.          At Lyndenburg:      The Boers opened on us at about 10,000 yards, the fire being accurate  from the first. They shelled us till dark, over three hours. The guns on  our left fired for a long time on Buller's camp, the ones on our right  on us. We could see the smoke and flash; then there was a soul-consuming  interval of 20 to 30 seconds when we would hear the report, and about  five seconds later the burst. Many in succession burst over and all  around us. I picked up pieces which fell within a few feet. It was a  trying afternoon, and we stood around wondering. We moved the horses  back, and took cover under the wagons. We were thankful when the sun  went down, especially as for the last hour of daylight they turned all  their guns on us. The casualties were few.    The next morning a heavy mist prevented the enemy from firing. The  division marched out at 7.30 A.M. The attack was made in three columns:  cavalry brigade on the left; Buller's troops in the centre, Hamilton's  on the right. The Canadian artillery were with Hamilton's division. The  approach to the hill was exposed everywhere except where some cover  was afforded by ridges. We marched out as support to the Gordons, the  cavalry and the Royal Horse Artillery going out to our right as a flank  guard. While we were waiting three 100-pound shells struck the top of  the ridge in succession about 50 to 75 yards in front of the battery  line. We began to feel rather shaky.    On looking over the field at this time one could not tell that anything  was occurring except for the long range guns replying to the fire from  the hill. The enemy had opened fire as soon as our advance was pushed  out. With a glass one could distinguish the infantry pushing up in  lines, five or six in succession, the men being some yards apart. Then  came a long pause, broken only by the big guns. At last we got the order  to advance just as the big guns of the enemy stopped their fire. We  advanced about four miles mostly up the slope, which is in all about  1500 feet high, over a great deal of rough ground and over a number of  spruits. The horses were put to their utmost to draw the guns up the  hills. As we advanced we could see artillery crawling in from both  flanks, all converging to the main hill, while far away the infantry and  cavalry were beginning to crown the heights near us. Then the field  guns and the pompoms began to play. As the field guns came up to a broad  plateau section after section came into action, and we fired shrapnel  and lyddite on the crests ahead and to the left. Every now and then a  rattle of Mausers and Metfords would tell us that the infantry were at  their work, but practically the battle was over. From being an infantry  attack as expected it was the gunners' day, and the artillery seemed to  do excellent work.    General Buller pushed up the hill as the guns were at work, and  afterwards General Hamilton; the one as grim as his pictures, the other  looking very happy. The wind blew through us cold like ice as we stood  on the hill; as the artillery ceased fire the mist dropped over us  chilling us to the bone. We were afraid we should have to spend the  night on the hill, but a welcome order came sending us back to camp, a  distance of five miles by the roads, as Buller would hold the hill, and  our force must march south. Our front was over eight miles wide and the  objective 1500 feet higher than our camp, and over six miles away. If  the enemy had had the nerve to stand, the position could scarcely have  been taken; certainly not without the loss of thousands.      For this campaign he received the Queen's Medal with three clasps.          VI. Children and Animals      Through all his life, and through all his letters, dogs and children  followed him as shadows follow men. To walk in the streets with him was  a slow procession. Every dog and every child one met must be spoken to,  and each made answer. Throughout the later letters the names Bonfire and  Bonneau occur continually. Bonfire was his horse, and Bonneau his dog.    This horse, an Irish hunter, was given to him by John L. Todd. It was  wounded twice, and now lives in honourable retirement at a secret place  which need not be disclosed to the army authorities. One officer who  had visited the hospital writes of seeing him going about the wards with  Bonneau and a small French child following after. In memory of his love  for animals and children the following extracts will serve:      You ask if the wee fellow has a name--Mike, mostly, as a term of  affection. He has found a cupboard in one ward in which oakum is stored,  and he loves to steal in there and \"pick oakum\", amusing himself as long  as is permitted. I hold that this indicates convict ancestry to which  Mike makes no defence.      The family is very well, even one-eyed Mike is able to go round the yard  in his dressing-gown, so to speak. He is a queer pathetic little beast  and Madame has him \"hospitalized\" on the bottom shelf of the sideboard  in the living room, whence he comes down (six inches to the floor) to  greet me, and then gravely hirples back, the hind legs looking very  pathetic as he hops in. But he is full of spirit and is doing very well.      As to the animals--\"those poor voiceless creatures,\" say you. I wish you  could hear them. Bonneau and Mike are a perfect Dignity and Impudence;  and both vocal to a wonderful degree. Mike's face is exactly like the  terrier in the old picture, and he sits up and gives his paw just like  Bonneau, and I never saw him have any instruction; and as for voice,  I wish you could hear Bonfire's \"whicker\" to me in the stable or  elsewhere. It is all but talk. There is one ward door that he tries  whenever we pass. He turns his head around, looks into the door, and  waits. The Sisters in the ward have changed frequently, but all alike  \"fall for it\", as they say, and produce a biscuit or some such dainty  which Bonfire takes with much gravity and gentleness. Should I chide  him for being too eager and give him my hand saying, \"Gentle now,\" he  mumbles with his lips, and licks with his tongue like a dog to show how  gentle he can be when he tries. Truly a great boy is that same. On this  subject I am like a doting grandmother, but forgive it.    I have a very deep affection for Bonfire, for we have been through so  much together, and some of it bad enough. All the hard spots to which  one's memory turns the old fellow has shared, though he says so little  about it.      This love of animals was no vagrant mood. Fifteen years before in South  Africa he wrote in his diary under date of September 11th, 1900:      I wish I could introduce you to the dogs of the force. The genus dog  here is essentially sociable, and it is a great pleasure to have them  about. I think I have a personal acquaintance with them all. There  are our pups--Dolly, whom I always know by her one black and one white  eyebrow; Grit and Tory, two smaller gentlemen, about the size of a pound  of butter--and fighters; one small white gentleman who rides on a horse,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35304"],[0,"The Last Stroke: A Detective Story (#12)"],[1,"his brother's things, an' so I jest hands out the  key and no questions asked.\"    A look of sudden alertness shot from the eyes of the detective, and he  arrested the doctor's evident impatience by a quick shake of the head  unperceived by the woman, who was addressing her narrative to the  doctor, as was natural.    \"I s'pose,\" she went on, \"that I shouldn't a' done it, but I didn't  scent anything wrong then. Mrs. Robson went home in a few minutes, and  then I roused my little girl up and took her in and put her to bed. She  was asleep again a'most as soon as her head touched the pillow, and the  night was so pleasant-like that I threw my shawl on my shoulders and  went out onto the front stoop. I felt sort o' lonesome in the house all  alone.\"    \"Of course,\" commented Ferrars, seeing the dread of their criticism or  displeasure that was manifest in her face as she paused and looked from  one to the other. \"One naturally would in your place.\"    \"Yes, I suppose so,\" she went on, reassured. \"Well, I hadn't been out  there two minutes when that same boy came running up the walk, all out  of breath, and says, sort of panting between words, 'Ma'am, the lady  that lives next the engine-house by the corner stopped me just now an'  asked me to come back here an' beg you to come down there quick! Her  little boy's got himself burned awful!'\"    \"Ah! I see!\" Ferrars spoke low, as if to himself, and his face wore the  look of one who is beginning to understand a riddle. \"You went, of  course?\"    \"Yes, I went.\"    \"Go on with the story, please. Tell it all as you have begun. Let us  have the details,\" and he again nodded toward the doctor, who was  regarding him with profound surprise, and put a finger to his lip.    \"My sister-in-law lives in the house by the engine-house,\" Mrs. Fry  hurried on, \"and knowing how careless she is about keepin' things in the  house against such times, I ran back into my bedroom and got a bottle of  camphor and a roll of cotton batt. 'Run ahead, boy,' I says to the boy,  'an' tell her I am coming; I must lock up my doors and winders.' 'She's  in an awful hurry,' he says, 'cryin' fit to kill. I'll set right down  here and watch your house, ma'am; I can do no good there.' The boy spoke  so honest, and Mary's boy is such a dear little fellow, that I jest lost  my head complete, and ran off down the sidewalk. At the corner I looked  back. The boy was sittin' on the doorstep, an' I heard him whistlin';  someway it made me feel quite easy. But when I got to the house and  found them all in the sitting-room, and Neddy not hurt at all, but sound  asleep on the floor, I was so took back that I just dropped down on a  chair and acted like a wild woman. Instead of rushin' back that very  minute, I sat there and told how I had been tricked, and scolded about  that boy, an' vowed I'd have him well punished, and so on, until Mary  reminded me that I'd better get back home and see if the house was all  right, or if 'twas only a boy's trick.\"    \"It looked like one, surely,\" was the detective's easy comment.    \"That's what Mr. Jones said. He's my neighbour. He was just going home,  and we overtook him. Mary told him about the boy and he laughed and said  that some boys had played that sort of trick last summer two or three  times, sending people running across the town on some such fool's  errand. He thought maybe 'twas some boy that I had offended some way;  and then I thought about how crisp I was about givin' the boy Mr.  Brierly's key, and it made me feel sort of easier. But Mr. Jones went in  with us when we got to my house. We looked all around downstairs and  everything was all right. Nellie was fast asleep still, and not a thing  had been disturbed. Then we went upstairs, 'just for form's sake,' Mr.  Jones said, and looked in all the bedrooms, and even tried Mr. Brierly's  door. Everything seemed right, and so Mr. Jones and Mary went away, and  I went to bed. But someway I couldn't sleep sound. I felt provoked and  angry about that boy, and the more I thought of him, of his being a  stranger and all, the uneasier I got. Then I began to imagine I heard  queer sounds, and creaking doors, and, right on the heels of all that,  came a loud slam that waked Nellie, and made me skip right out of bed.\"    \"A shutter, of course,\" said the doctor, as she paused for breath.    \"Yes, a shutter, and I knew well that every shutter on my house was  either shut tight or locked open. I look to that every night, as soon  as it's lamp-lighting time; them downstairs I shut, them upstairs I  open, sometimes. I knew where that slammin' shutter was by the sound,  and it set me to dressing quick. I had opened the shutters on Mr.  Brierly's windows that very afternoon, thinking the rooms would not seem  quite so dreary and lonesome when his brother came to look through 'em  and they was locked open, I knew well! All the same, it was them  shutters, or one of 'em, that was clattering then, and I knew it.\"    \"Were you alone in the house, you and your little girl?\" asked Ferrars.    \"All alone, yes, sir; and I took Nellie with me and went out into the  hall----\"    \"You mean downstairs?\"    \"Yes, sir. We sleep downstairs. Now, I thought I had seen that  everything was right when Mr. Jones and Mary was with me, but when we  went into that hall--Doctor--\" turning again toward that gentlemen, for  she had addressed her later remarks to Ferrars,--\"I guess you may  remember a shelf just at the foot of the stairs. It's right behind the  door, when it stands open, and that's why we hadn't seen it, or I hadn't  before. Well, I always set the lamp for Mr. Brierly's room--his bedroom  lamp, that is--on that shelf for him every morning, as soon as it had  been filled for the night's burning; and the morning he was killed I  had put it there as usual, and it had been there ever since. It was  there when Mr. Brierly and you two gentlemen called, after the inquest.\"    A queer little sound escaped the detective's throat, and again he  checked the doctor's impatience with that slight movement of the head.    \"I don't call myself brave,\" the woman went on, \"but I caught Nellie by  the hand--I was carrying my bedroom lamp--and ran up the stairs and  straight to Mr. Brierly's door. I don't know what made me do it, but I  stooped down to look through the keyhole, and there in the door was the  very key I had given to that boy to take to Mr. Brierly's brother.\"    \"What did you do?\" asked the doctor, breathlessly.    \"I set down my lamp very softly, told Nellie in a whisper not to make a  noise, and then very carefully tried the key. It turned in the lock. I  didn't dare go in, but I locked the door, left the key in it, and went  downstairs and out at the front door. I went around the house and stood  under the window of that room. The side window shutter that I had  fastened back was swinging loose. I went back to the sitting-room,  locking the front door and the doors from the hall into the front room  and sitting-room, taking out the key of the front door, and leaving the  other keys in the locks, on my side. Then I lit the big lamp, pulled  down the curtains, fixed the side door so I could open it quick, and set  the big dinner bell close by it. I made Nellie lie down on the lounge  with her clothes on, and there I sat till morning. Before daylight I  went into the kitchen and moved about very softly to get myself a cup of  coffee, and a bite of breakfast for Nellie. I had been careful not to  let her see how I was scared, and she went sound asleep right away. As  soon as I thought you would be up I awoke my little girl, and left her  sitting upon the side stoop, while I came here to you. Mr. Brierly's  brother ought to be first to enter that room, and--if there was anyone  there last night--they're there yet.\"    \"What room is that which I ought to enter, Mrs. Fry?\" said a voice  behind them, and turning, all together, they saw Robert Brierly standing  at the edge of the porch where it joined the wall of the doctor's room.    \"I was afraid of this,\" muttered Doctor Barnes. But the detective seemed  in nowise disconcerted. Neither did he seem inclined to listen, or allow  Brierly to listen to a repetition of Mrs. Fry's story.    \"You are here just in time, Mr. Brierly,\" he said, briskly. \"Mrs. Fry  believes that someone has paid a visit to your brother's room during the  night, and as she says, you are the one who should investigate, and I  think it ought to be done at once, if you feel up to it.\"    \"I'll be with you in a moment,\" replied Brierly, promptly, and he went  indoors by way of the French windows which had given him egress.          CHAPTER IX.    A LETTER.      As Robert Brierly entered the house, the detective, now taking the lead  as a matter of course, turned toward Mrs. Fry.    \"I see that you are anxious to get back home,\" he said to her. \"And it  is as well that you go back in advance of us, for people are beginning  to move about. Wait for us at the side door.\" And then, as the woman  hastened away, he turned toward the doctor. \"You need not feel uneasy  because of your guest, Doc.,\" he said, with his rare and fine smile.  \"There are times when the physical man is in subjection to the spiritual  man, or the will power within him, if you like that better. Brierly has  already endured a severe mental strain, I grant, but he's not at the end  of his endurance yet. In fact, if he's the journalist, and I begin to  think so, he knows how to sustain mental strain long and steadily. You  don't fancy he could be persuaded to wait for meat and drink now, do  you?\"    \"My soul, man!\" exclaimed Doctor Barnes, \"how you do read a man's  thoughts! No! Brierly wouldn't stop for anything now. Nor you, either,  for that matter, What do you make of this?\"    \"I can tell you better in an hour from now, I hope. Here's Brierly. Now  then, gentlemen, try and look as if this was merely a morning walk. We  don't want to excite the"]]]
