You  may be of service to the world--you may find you are utterly powerless.  You surely will die. But you know the machines and the monsters; your  knowledge may be of value in an attack.\" He waited. The silence lasted  for only a moment.    \"Why, sure,\" said Cyrus Thurston.           *       *       *       *       *    He looked at the eucalyptus grove with earnest appraisal. The sun made  lovely shadows among their stripped trunks: the world was a beautiful  place. A lingering death, MacGregor had intimated--and horrible....  \"Why, sure,\" he repeated steadily.    Slim Riley shoved him firmly aside to stand facing MacGregor.    \"Sure, hell!\" he said. \"I'm your man, Mr. MacGregor.    \"What do you know about flying?\" he asked Cyrus Thurston. \"You're  good--for a beginner. But men like you two have got brains, and I'm  thinkin' the world will be needin' them. Now me, all I'm good for is  holdin' a shtick\"--his brogue had returned to his speech, and was  evidence of his earnestness.    \"And, besides\"--the smile faded from his lips, and his voice was  suddenly soft--\"them boys we saw take their last flip was just pilots to  you, just a bunch of good fighters. Well, they're buddies of mine. I  fought beside some of them in France.... I belong!\"    He grinned happily at Thurston. \"Besides,\" he said, \"what do you know  about dog-fights?\"    MacGregor gripped him by the hand. \"You win,\" he said. \"Report to  Washington. The Secretary of War has all the dope.\"           *       *       *       *       *    He turned to Thurston. \"Now for you! Get this! The enemy machines almost  attacked New York. One of them came low, then went back, and the four  flashed out of sight toward the west. It is my belief that New York is  next, but the devils are hungry. The beast that attacked us was  ravenous, remember. They need food and lots of it. You will hear of  their feeding, and you can count on four days. Keep Riley  informed--that's your job.    \"Now I'm going over the hill. If this experiment works, there's a chance  we can repeat it on a larger scale. No certainty, but a chance! I'll be  back. Full instructions at the hotel in case....\" He vanished into the  scrub growth.    \"Not exactly encouraging,\" Thurston pondered, \"but he's a good man, Mac,  a good egg! Not as big a brain as the one we saw, but perhaps it's a  better one--cleaner--and it's working!\"    They were sheltered under the brow of the hill, but the blast from the  valley beyond rocked them like an earthquake. They rushed to the top of  the knoll. MacGregor was standing in the valley; he waved them a  greeting and shouted something unintelligible.    The gas had mushroomed into a cloud of steamy vapor. From above came  snowflakes to whirl in the churning mass, then fall to the ground. A  wind came howling about them to beat upon the cloud. It swirled slowly  back and down the valley. The figure of MacGregor vanished in its  smothering embrace.    \"Exit, MacGregor!\" said Cyrus Thurston softly. He held tight to the  struggling figure of Slim Riley.    \"He couldn't live a minute in that atmosphere of hydrogen,\" he  explained. \"They can--the devils!--but not a good egg like Mac. It's our  job now--yours and mine.\"    Slowly the gas retreated, lifted to permit their passage down the slope.           *       *       *       *       *    MacGregor was a good prophet. Thurston admitted that when, four days  later, he stood on the roof of the Equitable Building in lower New York.    The monsters had fed as predicted. Out in Wyoming a desolate area marked  the place of their meal, where a great herd of cattle lay smothered and  frozen. There were ranch houses, too, in the circle of destruction,  their occupants frozen stiff as the carcasses that dotted the plains.  The country had stood tense for the following blow. Only Thurston had  lived in certainty of a few days reprieve. And now had come the fourth  day.    In Washington was Riley. Thurston had been in touch with him frequently.    \"Sure, it's a crazy machine,\" the pilot had told him, \"and 'tis not much  I think of it at all. Neither bullets nor guns, just this big glass  contraption and speed. She's fast, man, she's fast ... but it's little  hope I have.\" And Thurston, remembering the scientist's words, was  heartless and sick with dreadful certainty.    There were aircraft ready near New York; it was generally felt that here  was the next objective. The enemy had looked it over carefully. And  Washington, too, was guarded. The nation's capital must receive what  little help the aircraft could afford.    There were other cities waiting for destruction. If not this  time--later! The horror hung over them all.           *       *       *       *       *    The fourth day! And Thurston was suddenly certain of the fate of New  York. He hurried to a telephone. Of the Secretary of War he implored  assistance.    \"Send your planes,\" he begged. \"Here's where we will get it next. Send  Riley. Let's make a last stand--win or lose.\"    \"I'll give you a squadron,\" was the concession. \"What difference whether  they die there or here...?\" The voice was that of a weary man, weary  and sleepless and hopeless.    \"Good-by Cy, old man!\" The click of the receiver sounded in Thurston's  ear. He returned to the roof for his vigil.    To wait, to stride nervously back and forth in impotent expectancy. He  could leave, go out into open country, but what were a few days or  months--or a year--with this horror upon them? It was the end. MacGregor  was right. \"Good old Mac!\"    There were airplanes roaring overhead. It meant.... Thurston abruptly  was cold; a chill gripped at his heart.    The paroxysm passed. He was doubled with laughter--or was it he who was  laughing? He was suddenly buoyantly carefree. Who was he that it  mattered? Cyrus Thurston--an ant! And their ant-hill was about to be  snuffed out....    He walked over to a waiting group and clapped one man on the shoulder.  \"Well, how does it feel to be an ant?\" he inquired and laughed loudly at  the jest. \"You and your millions of dollars, your acres of factories,  your steamships, railroads!\"    The man looked at him strangely and edged cautiously away. His eyes,  like those of the others, had a dazed, stricken look. A woman was  sobbing softly as she clung to her husband. From the streets far below  came a quavering shrillness of sound.    The planes gathered in climbing circles. Far on the horizon were four  tiny glinting specks....           *       *       *       *       *    Thurston stared until his eyes were stinging. He was walking in a waking  sleep as he made his way to the stone coping beyond which was the street  far below. He was dead--dead!--right this minute. What were a few  minutes more or less? He could climb over the coping; none of the  huddled, fear-gripped group would stop him. He could step out into space  and fool them, the devils. They could never kill him....    What was it MacGregor had said? Good egg, MacGregor! \"But we can die  fighting....\" Yes, that was it--die fighting. But he couldn't fight; he  could only wait. Well, what were the others doing, down there in the  streets--in their homes? He could wait with them, die with them....    He straightened slowly and drew one long breath. He looked steadily and  unafraid at the advancing specks. They were larger now. He could see  their round forms. The planes were less noisy: they were far up in the  heights--climbing--climbing.    The bulbs came slantingly down. They were separating. Thurston wondered  vaguely.    What had they done in Berlin? Yes, he remembered. Placed themselves at  the four corners of a great square and wiped out the whole city in one  explosion. Four bombs dropped at the same instant while they shot up to  safety in the thin air. How did they communicate? Thought transference,  most likely. Telepathy between those great brains, one to another. A  plane was falling. It curved and swooped in a trail of flame, then fell  straight toward the earth. They were fighting....           *       *       *       *       *    Thurston stared above. There were clusters of planes diving down from on  high. Machine-guns stuttered faintly. \"Machine-guns--toys! Brave, that  was it! 'We can die fighting.'\" His thoughts were far off; it was like  listening to another's mind.    The air was filled with swelling clouds. He saw them before the blast  struck where he stood. The great building shuddered at the impact. There  were things falling from the clouds, wrecks of planes, blazing and  shattered. Still came others; he saw them faintly through the clouds.  They came in from the West; they had gone far to gain altitude. They  drove down from the heights--the enemy had drifted--they were over the  bay.    More clouds, and another blast thundering at the city. There were  specks, Thurston saw, falling into the water.    Again the invaders came down from the heights where they had escaped  their own shattering attack. There was the faint roar of motors behind,  from the south. The squadron from Washington passed overhead.    They surely had seen the fate that awaited. And they drove on to the  attack, to strike at an enemy that shot instantly into the sky leaving  crashing destruction about the torn dead.    \"Now!\" said Cyrus Thurston aloud.           *       *       *       *       *    The big bulbs were back. They floated easily in the air, a plume of  vapor billowing beneath. They were ranging to the four corners of a  great square.    One plane only was left, coming in from the south, a lone straggler,  late for the fray. One plane! Thurston's shoulders sagged heavily. All  they had left! It went swiftly overhead.... It was fast--fast. Thurston  suddenly knew. It was Riley in that plane.    \"Go back, you fool!\"--he was screaming at the top of his  voice--\"Back--back--you poor, damned, decent"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2865"],[0,"Otto of the Silver Hand (#12)"],[1,"tle, ran a  long stone gallery, opening at one end upon the court-yard by a high  flight of stone steps. A man-at-arms in breast-plate and steel cap, and  bearing a long pike, paced up and down the length of this gallery, now  and then stopping, leaning over the edge, and gazing up into the starry  sky above; then, with a long drawn yawn, lazily turning back to the  monotonous watch again.    A dark figure crept out from an arched doorway at the lower part of the  long straight building, and some little distance below the end gallery,  but the sentry saw nothing of it, for his back was turned. As silently  and as stealthily as a cat the figure crawled along by the dark shadowy  wall, now and then stopping, and then again creeping slowly forward  toward the gallery where the man-at-arms moved monotonously up and down.  It was One-eyed Hans in his bare feet.    Inch by inch, foot by foot--the black figure crawled along in the angle  of the wall; inch by inch and foot by foot, but ever nearer and nearer  to the long straight row of stone steps that led to the covered gallery.  At last it crouched at the lowest step of the flight. Just then the  sentinel upon watch came to the very end of the gallery and stood there  leaning upon his spear. Had he looked down below he could not have  failed to have seen One-eyed Hans lying there motionlessly; but he was  gazing far away over the steep black roofs beyond, and never saw the  unsuspected presence. Minute after minute passed, and the one stood  there looking out into the night and the other lay crouching by the  wall; then with a weary sigh the sentry turned and began slowly pacing  back again toward the farther end of the gallery.    Instantly the motionless figure below arose and glided noiselessly and  swiftly up the flight of steps.    Two rude stone pillars flanked either side of the end of the gallery.  Like a shadow the black figure slipped behind one of these, flattening  itself up against the wall, where it stood straight and motionless as  the shadows around it.    Down the long gallery came the watchman, his sword clinking loudly in  the silence as he walked, tramp, tramp, tramp! clink, clank, jingle.    Within three feet of the motionless figure behind the pillar he turned,  and began retracing his monotonous steps. Instantly the other left the  shadow of the post and crept rapidly and stealthily after him. One step,  two steps the sentinel took; for a moment the black figure behind him  seemed to crouch and draw together, then like a flash it leaped forward  upon its victim.    A shadowy cloth fell upon the man's face, and in an instant he was flung  back and down with a muffled crash upon the stones. Then followed a  fierce and silent struggle in the darkness, but strong and sturdy as the  man was, he was no match for the almost superhuman strength of One-eyed  Hans. The cloth which he had flung over his head was tied tightly and  securely. Then the man was forced upon his face and, in spite of his  fierce struggles, his arms were bound around and around with strong fine  cord; next his feet were bound in the same way, and the task was done.  Then Hans stood upon his feet, and wiped the sweat from his swarthy  forehead. \"Listen, brother,\" he whispered, and as he spoke he stooped  and pressed something cold and hard against the neck of the other.  \"Dost thou know the feel of this? It is a broad dagger, and if thou  dost contrive to loose that gag from thy mouth and makest any outcry, it  shall be sheathed in thy weasand.\"    So saying, he thrust the knife back again into its sheath, then stooping  and picking up the other, he flung him across his shoulder like a sack,  and running down the steps as lightly as though his load was nothing at  all, he carried his burden to the arched doorway whence he had come a  little while before. There, having first stripped his prisoner of  all his weapons, Hans sat the man up in the angle of the wall. \"So,  brother;\" said he, \"now we can talk with more ease than we could up  yonder. I will tell thee frankly why I am here; it is to find where the  young Baron Otto of Drachenhausen is kept. If thou canst tell me,  well and good; if not, I must e'en cut thy weasand and find me one who  knoweth more. Now, canst thou tell me what I would learn, brother?\"    The other nodded dimly in the darkness.    \"That is good,\" said Hans, \"then I will loose thy gag until thou hast  told me; only bear in mind what I said concerning my dagger.\"    Thereupon, he unbound his prisoner, and the fellow slowly rose to his  feet. He shook himself and looked all about him in a heavy, bewildered  fashion, as though he had just awakened from a dream.    His right hand slid furtively down to his side, but the dagger-sheath  was empty.    \"Come, brother!\" said Hans, impatiently, \"time is passing, and once lost  can never be found again. Show me the way to the young Baron Otto or--.\"  And he whetted the shining blade of his dagger on his horny palm.    The fellow needed no further bidding; turning, he led the way, and  together they were swallowed up in the yawning shadows, and again the  hush of night-time lay upon the Castle of Trutz-Drachen.          XI. How Otto was Saved.    Little Otto was lying upon the hard couch in his cell, tossing in  restless and feverish sleep; suddenly a heavy hand was laid upon him and  a voice whispered in his ear, \"Baron, Baron Otto, waken, rouse yourself;  I am come to help you. I am One-eyed Hans.\"    Otto was awake in an instant and raised himself upon his elbow in the  darkness. \"One-eyed Hans,\" he breathed, \"One-eyed Hans; who is One-eyed  Hans?\"    \"True,\" said the other, \"thou dost not know me. I am thy father's  trusted servant, and am the only one excepting his own blood and kin  who has clung to him in this hour of trouble. Yes, all are gone but me  alone, and so I have come to help thee away from this vile place.\"    \"Oh, dear, good Hans! if only thou canst!\" cried Otto; \"if only thou  canst take me away from this wicked place. Alas, dear Hans! I am weary  and sick to death.\" And poor little Otto began to weep silently in the  darkness.    \"Aye, aye,\" said Hans, gruffly, \"it is no place for a little child  to be. Canst thou climb, my little master? canst thou climb a knotted  rope?\"    \"Nay,\" said Otto, \"I can never climb again! See, Hans;\" and he flung  back the covers from off him.    \"I cannot see,\" said Hans, \"it is too dark.\"    \"Then feel, dear Hans,\" said Otto.    Hans bent over the poor little white figure glimmering palely in the  darkness. Suddenly he drew back with a snarl like an angry wolf. \"Oh!  the black, bloody wretches!\" he cried, hoarsely; \"and have they done  that to thee, a little child?\"    \"Yes,\" said Otto, \"the Baron Henry did it.\" And then again he began to  cry.    \"There, there,\" said Hans, roughly, \"weep no more. Thou shalt get away  from here even if thou canst not climb; I myself will help thee. Thy  father is already waiting below the window here, and thou shalt soon be  with him. There, there, cry no more.\"    While he was speaking Hans had stripped off his peddler's leathern  jacket, and there, around his body, was wrapped coil after coil of stout  hempen rope tied in knots at short distances. He began unwinding the  rope, and when he had done he was as thin as ever he had been before.  Next he drew from the pouch that hung at his side a ball of fine cord  and a leaden weight pierced by a hole, both of which he had brought with  him for the use to which he now put them. He tied the lead to the end of  the cord, then whirling the weight above his head, he flung it up toward  the window high above. Twice the piece of lead fell back again into the  room; the third time it flew out between the iron bars carrying the cord  with it. Hans held the ball in his hand and paid out the string as the  weight carried it downward toward the ground beneath. Suddenly the cord  stopped running. Hans jerked it and shook it, but it moved no farther.  \"Pray heaven, little child,\" said he, \"that it hath reached the ground,  for if it hath not we are certainly lost.\"    \"I do pray,\" said Otto, and he bowed his head.    Then, as though in answer to his prayer, there came a twitch upon the  cord.    \"See,\" said Hans, \"they have heard thee up above in heaven; it was thy  father who did that.\" Quickly and deftly he tied the cord to the end of  the knotted rope; then he gave an answering jerk upon the string. The  next moment the rope was drawn up to the window and down the outside by  those below. Otto lay watching the rope as it crawled up to the window  and out into the night like a great snake, while One-eyed Hans held the  other end lest it should be drawn too far. At last it stopped. \"Good,\"  muttered Hans, as though to himself. \"The rope is long enough.\"    He waited for a few minutes and then, drawing upon the rope and finding  that it was held from below, he spat upon his hands and began slowly  climbing up to the window above. Winding his arm around the iron bars of  the grating that guarded it, he thrust his hand into the pouch that hung  by his side, and drawing forth a file, fell to work cutting through all  that now lay between Otto and liberty.    It was slow, slow work, and it seemed to Otto as though Hans would never  finish his task, as lying upon his hard couch he watched that figure,  black against the sky, bending over its work. Now and then the file  screeched against the hard iron, and then Hans would cease for a moment,  but only to begin again as industriously as ever. Three or four times he  tried the effects of his work, but still the iron held. At last he  set his shoulder against it, and as Otto looked he saw the iron bend.  Suddenly there was a sharp crack, and a piece of the grating went flying  out into the night.    Hans tied the rope securely about the stump of the stout iron bar that  yet remained, and then slid down again into the room below.    \"My little lord,\""]]]
