According to Professor Williamson the young Melicerta commences her  house by secreting \"a thin hyaline cylinder,\" and the first row of  pellets are deposited, not at the base as would be expected, but in a  ring about the middle of the tube. \"At first new additions are made to  both extremities of the enlarging ring; but the jerking constrictions of  the animal at length force the caudal end of the cylinder down upon the  leaf, to which it becomes securely cemented by the same viscous  secretion as causes the little spheres to cohere.\"    Round the margins of the lobes or expansions may be seen delicate  threads towards which others radiate; these are thought by Mr. Gosse to  be portions of a nervous system, and two calcars or feelers serve as  organs of relation. The young Melicertas are likewise furnished with a  pair of eyes, which are probably rudimentary, and disappear as they grow  up.    The Melicerta tubes, being large enough to be visible to the naked eye,  are easily crushed in the live-box, and to avoid this, they are  conveniently viewed in a shallow glass cell, covered up as before  described. By occasionally changing the water one may be kept for days  in the same cell, and will reward the pains by frequently exposing its  flower-like head. Usually the horns or feelers come out first, and then  a lump of flesh. After this, if all seems right, the wheels appear, and  make a fine whirlpool, as may be readily seen by the use of a little  indigo or carmine.    The Melicerta is, however, an awkward object to undertake to show to our  friends, for as they knock at the door she is apt to turn sulky, and  when once in this mood it is impossible to say when her fair form will  reappear. At times the head is wagged about in all directions with  considerable vehemence, playing singular antics, and distorting her  lobes so as to exhibit a Punch and Judy profile. When these creatures  die they leave their tubes, which are often found empty in the ponds  they frequent. The Melicertas are conveniently viewed with a power of  from sixty to one hundred linear, and a colony of them may be kept alive  for some weeks in a glass jar or tank.    Among the remainder of my tiny captives were two beautiful members of  the Vorticella family, _Epistylis_ and _Carchesium_. The reader will  remember that in the Vorticella previously described, the bells stood  upon stalks that were very flexible, and retractile by means of a muscle  running down their length. The _Epistylis_ is, as its name imports, the  dweller on a _pillar_. The stem is stiff, or only slightly flexible, and  has no apparatus by which it can be drawn down. The specimen mentioned  stood like a palm-tree, and the large oval bells drooped elegantly on  all sides, as its portrait will show. At times they nodded with a rapid  jerk.    [Illustration: Epistylis.]    The _Carchesium_ differs from the common _Vorticella_, by branching like  a tree, but the stems are all retractile, although the trunk seldom  exercises the power. A group of these creatures presents a spectacle of  extraordinary beauty--it looks like a tree from fairy-land, in which  every leaf has a sentient life. In general structure the bells of the  _Epistylis_ and the _Carchesium_ resemble the common _Vorticella_, and  like them may be seen with a power of about one hundred linear for  general effect, and with a higher one for the examination of special  points. Pritchard notices three species of _Carchesium_, and eighteen of  _Epistylis_;[13] some of which it is to be hoped will turn out to be  only varieties.    [13] An interesting _Epistylis_, called _Digitalis_, from its bells  resembling fox-glove flowers in shape, occurs as a parasite upon the  _Cyclops quadricornis_, a very common entomostracan in fresh-water  ponds. At this moment I have a beautiful specimen, branching like a  bushy tree, and attached to the tail of a _Cyclops_, who can scarcely  move under his burden, which is like Sinbad's \"Old Man of the Sea.\"    Towards the end of this month rotifers abounded, and polyps were  plentiful. Among the rotifers was one about a two-hundredth of an inch  long, protected by a carapace, and having a tail terminating in a single  style, hence called \"Monostyle.\" There is perhaps no class of creatures  that present so many curious and unexpected forms as the rotifers; and  although we have noticed a good many, there are far more that remain to  be found and described.    The water in which the preceding animals dwelt was enlivened by the  jumps of the _Halteria_, a little globe surrounded by long fine cilia,  with which its movements were effected; and its companion was the  _Aspidisca lynceus_, an oval animalcule, having a distinct cilia or  _lorica_, and furnished, in addition to cilia, with bristles, which  enable it to walk and climb as well as swim.    There were also some eggs of rotifers attached to the water plants, in  which motion could be descried at intervals, and a little red eye  observed. These eggs are always large in proportion to the creatures  that lay them, and if they escape being devoured by enemies, may be  watched until their contents step forth.    In this, as in other months, omission is made of creatures that have  already come under notice, or our list would assume larger dimensions.          CHAPTER VII.    JUNE AND JULY.

A Pressure of other occupations prevented full use being made of June  and July, nor was the weather at all propitious. For this reason the  microscopic doings of these two months are recorded in one chapter.    As usual the Kentish Town ponds were productive of objects, and among  them were several rotifers not found in the previous months. The first  of these was a very small worm-like thing, with one eye, a tuft of cilia  about the mouth, and two toes at the tail end. Had it not been for the  jaws, which were working like fingers thrust against each other, and  which were unmistakably of the rotifer pattern, the animal might have  been supposed to belong to some other class. According to the  'Micrographic Dictionary,' the _Lindia torulosa_ is 1--75\" long, but  this specimen was only about 1--200\". It was possibly very young, and  did not thrust out its cilia in two distinct tufts, as Cohn describes,  although it may have had the power of doing so. At times it sprang  quickly backwards and forwards, bringing its head where its tail was  before. This object required for its comfortable elucidation a power of  about six hundred linear.    [Illustration: OEcistes crystallinus.]    Among the common water-plants, which are worth examining as the probable  abodes of rotifers or infusoria, is the pretty little thing called  \"star-weed,\" some of which was obtained from the last-mentioned ponds,  and on examination yielded a specimen of a tube-dwelling rotifer, the  _OEcistes crystallinus_, which, although less beautiful than the  Floscules or the Melicerta, is, nevertheless, a pretty and interesting  object. In this instance a little rough dirty tube, about 1--70\" long,  was observed to contain an animal capable of rising up and expanding a  round mouth garnished with a wreath of cilia; while a little below, the  indefatigable and characteristic gizzard of the tribe was in full play.  A power of two hundred and forty linear sufficed to afford a good view,  and it was seen that a long, irregular, conical body was supported upon  a short wrinkled stalk. The usual drawings represent this creature with  a short bell-shaped body upon a very long slender pedicle. Possibly this  one might have been able to show himself under this guise, but he did  not attempt it; his appearance being always pretty much as described,  which made the foot shorter and the body longer than the measurements  which naturalists have given, and according to which the whole creature  is 1--36\" long, although the body is only 1--140\". The tube of the  _OEcistes_ is called a \"lorica,\" or carapace; but it has in truth no  right whatever to the appellation.    Another strange rotifer, of whose name I am uncertain, had an ovalish  oblong body, and a pair of legs like compasses, twice as long as  himself. His antics were those of a posture-master, or \"Professor of  Deportment\" on stilts. Sometimes he stood bolt upright, bringing his  legs close together; then they were jauntily crossed, and the body  carried horizontally; then the two legs would be slightly opened, and  the body thrown exactly at right-angles to them. These antics were  repeated all the while the observation lasted, and had a very funny  effect in proving that drollery is practised, if not understood, in the  rotatorial world.    [Illustration: Philodina (swimming).]    Another kind of rotifer was abundant--the _Philodina_, which belongs to  the same family as the common wheel-bearer, namely, the _Philodinaea_.  The _Philodina_ is a good deal like the common wheel-bearer, or _Rotifer  vulgaris_, but is usually of a stouter build, and carries his eyes in a  different place. In the common rotifer these organs are situated on the  proboscis, while those of the Philodina are lower, and said to be  \"cervical.\" The changes of form in this rotifer are still more  remarkable than"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36922"],[0,"Antarctic Penguins: A Study of Their Social Habits (#12)"],[1,"50. A PERFECT DIVE INTO DEEP WATER (Page 83)]    Whilst in the water the penguins usually hunted and played in parties,  just as they had entered it, though a fair number of solitary  individuals were also to be seen. When a party had satisfied their  appetites and their desire for play, they would swim to a distance of  some thirty to forty yards from the ice-foot, when they might be seen  all to stretch their necks up and take a good look at the proposed  landing-place. Having done this, every bird would suddenly disappear  beneath the surface, not a ripple showing which direction they had  taken, till suddenly, sometimes in a bunch, sometimes in a stream, one  after the other they would all shoot out of the water, clean up on to  the top of the ice-foot. (Figs. 41 and 42.) Several times I measured the  distance from the surface of the water to the ledge on which they  landed, and the highest leap I recorded was exactly five feet. The \"take  off\" was about four feet out from the edge, the whole of the necessary  impetus being gained as the bird approached beneath the water.    The most important thing to note about this jumping from the water was  the accuracy with which they invariably rose at precisely the right  moment, the exact distance being judged during their momentary survey of  a spot from a distance, before they dived beneath the water, and carried  in their minds as they approached the ice. I am sure that this  impression was all they had to guide them, as with a ripple on the  water, and at the pace they were going, they could not possibly have  seen their landing-place at all clearly as they approached it, besides  which, in many cases, the ledge of ice on which they landed projected  many feet forwards from the surface, yet I never saw them misjudge their  distance so as to come up under the overhanging ledge.    During their approach they swam at an even distance of about three or  four feet beneath the surface, projecting themselves upwards by a sudden  upward bend of the body, at the same time using their tail as a helm, in  the manner well shown in one of my photographs, in which one of the  birds is seen in the air at the moment it left the water, the tail being  bent sharply up towards the back.    Their quickness of perception is shown very well as they land on the  ice. If the surface is composed of snow, and so affords them a good  foothold, they throw their legs well forward and land on their feet, as  shown in Figs. 41 and 42, but should they find themselves landing on a  slippery ice-surface, they throw themselves forward, landing on their  breasts in the tobogganing position as shown in Fig. 43.    The Adelies dive very beautifully. We did not see this at first, before  the sea-ice had gone out, because to enter the water they had only to  drop a few inches, but later, when entering from the ice terraces, we  constantly saw them making the most graceful dives.      [Illustration: Fig. 51. SEA-LEOPARDS \"LURK BENEATH THE OVERHANGING    LEDGES OF THE ICE-FOOT, OUT OF SIGHT OF THE BIRDS OVERHEAD\" (Page 84)]    At the place where they most often went in, a long terrace of ice about  six feet in height ran for some hundreds of yards along the edge of the  water, and here, just as on the sea-ice, crowds would stand near the  brink. When they had succeeded in pushing one of their number over, all  would crane their necks over the edge (Fig. 44), and when they saw the  pioneer safe in the water, the rest followed.    When diving into shallow water they fall flat (Figs. 45, 46, and 47),  but into deep water, and from any considerable height, they assume the  most perfect positions (Fig. 50) and make very little splash.  Occasionally we saw them stand hesitating to dive at a height of some  twenty feet, but generally they descended to some lower spot, and did  not often dive from such a height, but twelve feet was no uncommon dive  for them.    The reluctance shown by each individual of a party of intending bathers  to be the first to enter the water may partly have been explained when,  later on, we discovered that a large number of sea-leopards were  gathered in the sea in the neighbourhood of the rookery to prey on the  penguins. These formidable animals, of which I show some photographs,  used to lurk beneath the overhanging ledges of the ice-foot, out of  sight of the birds on the ice overhead. (Fig. 51.) They lay quite still  in the water, only their heads protruding, until a party of Adelies  would descend into the water almost on top of them, when with a sudden  dash and snap of their great formidable jaws, they would secure one of  the birds.    It seemed to me then, that all the chivvying and preliminaries which  they went through before entering the water, arose mainly from a desire  on the part of each penguin to get one of its neighbours to go in first  in order to prove whether the coast was clear or not, though all this  manoeuvring was certainly taken very lightly, and quite in the nature of  a game. This indeed was not surprising, for of all the animals of which  I have had any experience, I think the Adelie penguin is the very  bravest. The more we saw of them the fonder we became of them and the  more we admired their indomitable courage. The appearance of a  sea-leopard in their midst was the one thing that caused them any panic.  With dozens of these enemies about they would gambol in the sea in the  most light-hearted manner, but the appearance of one among them was the  signal for a stampede, but even this was invariably gone through in an  orderly manner with some show of reason, for, porpoising off in a clump,  they at once spread themselves out, scattering in a fan-shaped formation  as they sped away, instead of all following the same direction.      [Illustration: Fig. 52. A SEA-LEOPARD'S HEAD (Page 87)]    As far as I could judge, however, the sea-leopards are a trifle faster  in the water than the Adelies, as one of them occasionally would catch  up with one of the fugitives, who then, realizing that speed alone would  not avail him, started dodging from side to side, and sometimes swam  rapidly round and round in a circle of about twelve feet diameter for a  full minute or more, doubtless knowing that he was quicker in turning  than his great heavy pursuer, but exhaustion would overtake him in the  end, and we could see the head and jaws of the great sea-leopard rise to  the surface as he grabbed his victim. The sight of a panic-stricken  little Adelie tearing round and round in this manner was a sadly common  sight late in the season.    Sea-leopards are no mean customers and should be treated with caution.  Commander Campbell and I used to hunt them from a little Norwegian pram  (a species of dinghy) which we rowed quietly up and down close under the  ice-foot, shooting at the sea-leopards with a rifle when we saw their  heads above water.    One day we had an interesting little adventure. We had shot and killed  one, a fine bull about ten feet long, which had sunk to the bottom in  some five fathoms. Having just pulled away from him, we were about ten  yards from the ice-foot, when another very large sea-leopard overtook  us, swimming from the direction of the dead bull. It passed under the  pram, bumping against the keel in doing so. When about ten yards ahead  of us it turned and made straight back for us, but as we were bows-on to  it, it came right alongside the boat, churning up the water and wetting  us. At this moment it turned on its side, its right fore-flipper beating  the surface and its belly towards us, and was just starting to rear its  head up when we both lunged at it with our paddles, and so pushed the  little boat away from it. This brought us alongside the ice-foot, from  which Campbell got a shot at it half a minute later, and wounded it in  the neck. The moment after we lunged at it with our paddles it dived,  then reappeared ten or fifteen yards off, rearing its head out of the  water, and it was at this moment that Campbell shot it. After this it  reappeared several times at the surface, but drifted away with the tide  and we lost it.      [Illustration: Fig. 53. A Sea-Leopard 10 ft. 61/2 ins. long]      [Illustration: Fig. 54. A Young Sea-Leopard on Sea-Ice (Page 87)]    The sea-leopard has not a reputation for attacking men in boats, and  this one may have been actuated by curiosity merely, but in favour of  its meaning to attack us were, first, that it came to us straight from  the direction of the dead bull we had shot, and secondly, that it seems  hardly likely that after bumping against our keel, mere curiosity could  have tempted it to come back and try to look over the gunwale! As a rule  we had to drift very quietly along when hunting sea-leopards, as the  slightest sound frightened them away.    All that we could do to protect our friends was to shoot as many of  these sea-leopards as possible but though we may have made some  difference, there were always many about.    Some idea of the depredations committed by these animals may be gathered  from the fact that in the stomach of one which we shot I found the  bodies of eighteen penguins, in various stages of digestion, the beast's  intestines being literally stuffed with the feathers remaining from the  disintegration of many more. Photographs of these animals are seen in  Figs. 52, 53, and 54.    Though the actual presence of a sea-leopard put the Adelies to  confusion, causing them to \"porpoise\" madly away for a few hundred  yards, yet once away from the immediate neighbourhood of the arch enemy,  they appeared to think no more of him, and behaved as though there were  no further need for anxiety, though probably they kept a sharp look-out  nevertheless. Evidence goes to show that the sea-leopard is the only  living enemy, excepting man, that threatens the life of the adult Adelie  penguin.    One day, as I watched some hundreds of Adelies bathing in an open lead,"]]]
