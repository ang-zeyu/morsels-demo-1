She looked at the shining ones in their high seats, and said,    \"If I take that sword, it will be to use it against you as Ban Cruach  did!\"    Stark knew that the seven had understood the thought behind her words.  He felt that they were amused.    \"The secret of that sword was lost a million years ago, the day Ban  Cruach died. Neither you nor anyone now knows how to use it as he did.  But the sword's radiations of warmth still lock us here.    \"We cannot approach that sword, for its vibrations of heat slay us if we  do. But you warm-bodied ones can approach it. And you will do so, and  take it from its place. _One of you will take it!_\"    They were very sure of that.    \"We can see, a little way, into your evil minds. Much we do not  understand. But--the mind of the large man is full of the woman's image,  and the mind of the woman turns to him. Also, there is a link between  the large man and the small man, less strong, but strong enough.\"    The thought-voice of the seven finished, \"The large man will take away  the sword for us because he must--to save the other two.\"    Ciara turned to Stark. \"They cannot force you, Stark. Don't let them. No  matter what they do to me, don't let them!\"    Balin stared at her with a certain wonder. \"You would die, to protect  Kushat?\"    \"Not Kushat alone, though its people too are human,\" she said, almost  angrily. \"There are my red wolves--a wild pack, but my own. And others.\"  She looked at Balin. \"What do _you_ say? Your life against the  Norlands?\"    Balin made an effort to lift his head as high as hers, and the red jewel  flashed in his ear. He was a man crushed by the falling of his world,  and terrified by what his mad passion had led him into, here beyond the  Gates of Death. But he was not afraid to die.    He said so, and even Ciara knew that he spoke the truth.    But the seven were not dismayed. Stark knew that when their  thought-voice whispered in his mind,    \"It is not death alone you humans have to fear, but the manner of your  dying. You shall see that, before you choose.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Swiftly, silently, those of the ice-folk who had borne the captives into  the city came up from behind, where they had stood withdrawn and  waiting. And one of them bore a crystal rod like a sceptre, with a spark  of ugly purple burning in the globed end.    Stark leaped to put himself between them and Ciara. He struck out,  raging, and because he was almost as quick as they, he caught one of the  slim luminous bodies between his hands.    The utter coldness of that alien flesh burned his hands as frost will  burn. Even so, he clung on, snarling, and saw the tendrils writhe and  stiffen as though in pain.    Then, from the crystal rod, a thread of darkness spun itself to touch  his brain with silence, and the cold that lies between the worlds.    He had no memory of being carried once more through the shimmering  streets of that elfin, evil city, back to the stupendous well of the  tower, and up along the spiral path of ice that soared those dizzy  hundreds of feet from bedrock to the glooming crystal globe. But when he  again opened his eyes, he was lying on the wide stone ledge at  ice-level.    Beside him was the arch that led outside. Close above his head was the  control bank that he had seen before.    Ciara and Balin were there also, on the ledge. They leaned stiffly  against the stone wall beside the control bank, and facing them was a  squat, round mechanism from which projected a sort of wheel of crystal  rods.    Their bodies were strangely rigid, but their eyes and minds were awake.  Terribly awake. Stark saw their eyes, and his heart turned within him.    Ciara looked at him. She could not speak, but she had no need to. _No  matter what they do to me...._    She had not feared the swordsmen of Kushat. She had not feared her red  wolves, when he unmasked her in the square. She was afraid now. But she  warned him, ordered him not to save her.    _They cannot force you. Stark! Don't let them._    And Balin, too, pleaded with him for Kushat.    They were not alone on the ledge. The ice-folk clustered there, and out  upon the flying spiral pathway, on the narrow bridges and the spans of  fragile ice, they stood in hundreds watching, eyeless, faceless, their  bodies drawn in rainbow lines across the dimness of the shaft.    Stark's mind could hear the silent edges of their laughter. Secret,  knowing laughter, full of evil, full of triumph, and Stark was filled  with a corroding terror.    He tried to move, to crawl toward Ciara standing like a carven image in  her black mail. He could not.    Again her fierce, proud glance met his. And the silent laughter of the  ice-folk echoed in his mind, and he thought it very strange that in this  moment, now, he should realize that there had never been another woman  like her on all of the worlds of the Sun.    The fear she felt was not for herself. It was for him.    Apart from the multitudes of the ice-folk, the group of seven stood upon  the ledge. And now their thought-voice spoke to Stark, saying,    \"Look about you. Behold the men who have come before you through the  Gates of Death!\"    Stark raised his eyes to where their slender fingers pointed, and saw  the icy galleries around the tower, saw more clearly the icy statues in  them that he had only glimpsed before.           *       *       *       *       *    Men, set like images in the galleries. Men whose bodies were sheathed in  a glittering mail of ice, sealing them forever. Warriors, nobles,  fanatics and thieves--the wanderers of a million years who had dared to  enter this forbidden valley, and had remained forever.    He saw their faces, their tortured eyes wide open, their features frozen  in the agony of a slow and awful death.    \"They refused us,\" the seven whispered. \"They would not take away the  sword. And so they died, as this woman and this man will die, unless you  choose to save them.    \"We will show you, human, how they died!\"    One of the ice-folk bent and touched the squat, round mechanism that  faced Balin and Ciara. Another shifted the pattern of control on the  master-bank.    The wheel of crystal rods on that squat mechanism began to turn. The  rods blurred, became a disc that spun faster and faster.    High above in the top of the tower the great globe brooded, shrouded in  its cloud of shimmering darkness. The disc became a whirling blur. The  glooming shadow of the globe deepened, coalesced. It began to lengthen  and descend, stretching itself down toward the spinning disc.    The crystal rods of the mechanism drank the shadow in. And out of that  spinning blur there came a subtle weaving of threads of darkness, a  gossamer curtain winding around Ciara and Balin so that their outlines  grew ghostly and the pallor of their flesh was as the pallor of snow at  night.    And still Stark could not move.    The veil of darkness began to sparkle faintly. Stark watched it, watched  the chill motes brighten, watched the tracery of frost whiten over  Ciara's mail, touch Balin's dark hair with silver.    Frost. Bright, sparkling, beautiful, a halo of frost around their  bodies. A dust of splintered diamond across their faces, an aureole of  brittle light to crown their heads.    Frost. Flesh slowly hardening in marbly whiteness, as the cold slowly  increased. And yet their eyes still lived, and saw, and understood.    The thought-voice of the seven spoke again.    \"You have only minutes now to decide! Their bodies cannot endure too  much, and live again. Behold their eyes, and how they suffer!    \"Only minutes, human! Take away the sword of Ban Cruach! Open for us the  Gates of Death, and we will release these two, alive.\"    Stark felt again the flashing stab of pain along his nerves, as one of  the shining creatures moved behind him. Life and feeling came back into  his limbs.    He struggled to his feet. The hundreds of the ice-folk on the bridges  and galleries watched him in an eager silence.    He did not look at them. His eyes were on Ciara's. And now, her eyes  pleaded.    \"Don't, Stark! Don't barter the life of the Norlands for me!\"    The thought-voice beat at Stark, cutting into his mind with cruel  urgency.    \"Hurry, human! They are already beginning to die. Take away the sword,  and let them live!\"    Stark turned. He cried out, in a voice that made the icy bridges  tremble:    \"I will take the sword!\"    He staggered out, then. Out through the archway, across the ice, toward  the distant cairn that blocked the Gates of Death.          IX      Across the glowing ice of the valley Stark went at a stumbling run that  grew swifter and more sure as his cold-numbed body began to regain its  functions. And behind him, pouring out of the tower to watch, came the  shining ones.    They followed after him, gliding lightly. He could sense their  excitement, the cold, strange ecstasy of triumph. He knew that already  they were thinking of the great towers of stone rising again above the  Norlands, the crystal cities still and beautiful under the ice, all  vestige of the ugly citadels of man gone and forgotten.    The seven spoke once more, a warning.    \"If you turn toward us with the sword, the woman and the man will die.  And you will die as well. For neither you nor any other can now use the  sword as a weapon of offense.\"    Stark ran on. He was thinking then only of Ciara, with the  frost-crystals gleaming on her marble flesh and her eyes full of mute  torment.    The cairn loomed up ahead, dark and high. It seemed to Stark that the  brooding figure of Ban Cruach watched him coming with those shadowed  eyes beneath the rusty helm. The great sword blazed between those dead,  frozen hands.

Chauncey Mitchell Depew (New York: D. O. Haines,  1895), p. 530. (Smithsonian photo 42542-A.)]      The \"Sewing-Machine Combination\"    With the basic elements of a successful sewing machine assembled, the  various manufacturers should have been able to produce good machines  unencumbered. The court order, however, which restrained several firms  from selling Singer machines while the Howe suit was pending, started a  landslide; soon Wheeler, Wilson and company, Grover and Baker company,  and several others[64] purchased rights from Elias Howe. This gave Howe  almost absolute control of the sewing-machine business as these  companies agreed to his royalty terms of $25 for every machine sold. In  an attempt to improve his own machine, Howe was almost immediately  caught up in another series of legal battles in which he was the  defendant; the companies he had defeated were able to accuse him of  infringing on patents that they owned. To compound the confusion,  individual companies also were suing each other on various grounds.    Because of this situation Orlando B. Potter, president of the Grover and  Baker company, advanced in 1856 the idea of a \"Combination\" of  sewing-machine manufacturers. He pointed out how the various companies  were harming themselves by continuing litigation and tried to convince  Howe that all would benefit by an agreement of some kind. He proposed  that Elias Howe; Wheeler, Wilson and company; I. M. Singer and company;  and Grover and Baker company pool their patents covering the essential  features of the machine. The three companies had started production  about the same time and approved of Potter's idea; Howe opposed it as he  felt that he had the most to lose by joining the \"Combination.\" He  finally consented to take part in Potter's plan if the others would  agree to certain stipulations. The first requirement was that at least  twenty-four manufacturers were to be licensed. The second was that, in  addition to sharing equally in the profits with the three companies,  Howe would receive a royalty of $5 for each machine sold in the United  States and $1 for each machine exported. It has been estimated that, as  a result of this agreement, Howe received at least $2,000,000 as his  share of the license fees between 1856 and 1867 when his patent  expired.[65]    The organization was called the Sewing-Machine Trust and/or the  Sewing-Machine Combination. The important patents contributed to it  were:         1. The grooved, eye-pointed needle used with a shuttle to form the       lockstitch (E. Howe patent, held by E. Howe);         2. The four-motion feeding mechanism (A. B. Wilson patent, held by       Wheeler and Wilson company);         3. The needle moving vertically above a horizontal work-plate       (Bachelder patent), a continuous feeding device by belt or wheel       (Bachelder patent), a yielding presser resting on the cloth       (Bachelder patent), the spring or curved arm to hold the cloth by a       yielding pressure (Morey and Johnson patent), the heart-shaped cam       as applied to moving the needle bar (Singer patent); all these       patents, held by the Singer Company.[66]    The Grover and Baker company contributed several patents of relative  importance, but its most important claim for admission was the fact that  Potter had promoted the idea.    The consent of all four member-parties was required before any license  could be granted, and all were required to have a license--even the  member companies. The fee was $15 per machine. A portion of this money  was set aside to pay the cost of prosecuting infringers, Howe received  his initial fee, and the rest was divided between the four parties. The  advantage to the licensee was that he was required to pay only one fee.  Most license applications were granted; only those manufacturing a  machine specifically imitating the product of a licensed manufacturer  were refused.    The \"Combination's\" three company members each continued to manufacture,  improve, and perfect its own machine. Other than the joint control of  the patents, there was no pooling of interests, and each company  competed to attract purchasers to buy its particular type of machine, as  did the companies who were licensed by them.    In 1860, the year Howe's patent was renewed, the general license fee was  reduced from $15 to $7, and Howe's special royalty was reduced to $1 per  machine. Howe remained a member until his patent ran out in 1867. The  other members continued the \"Combination\" until 1877, when the Bachelder  patent, which had been extended twice, finally expired. By that time the  fundamental features of the sewing machine were no longer controlled by  anyone. Open competition by the smaller manufacturers was possible, and  a slight reduction in price followed. Many new companies came into  being--some destined to be very short-lived.    From the beginning to the end of the \"Combination\" there was an army of  independents, including infringers and imitators, who kept up a constant  complaint against it, maintaining that its existence tended to retard  the improvement of the sewing machine and that the public suffered  thereby. In the period immediately following the termination of the  \"Combination,\" however, only a few improvements of any importance were  made, and most of these were by the member companies.    FOOTNOTES:    [64] These included the American Magnetic Sewing Machine Co.; A.  Bartholf; Nichols and Bliss; J. A. Lerow; Woolridge, Keene, and Moore;  and A. B. Howe. _New York Daily Tribune_, Sept. 3, 1853.    [65] \"Who Invented the Sewing-Machine,\" unsigned article in _The  Galaxy_, vol. 4, August 31, 1867, pp. 471-481.    [66] Singer has sometimes been credited as the inventor of the various  improvements covered by the patents that the Singer company purchased  and later contributed to the efforts of the Combination.          _Chapter Four_    [Illustration: Figure 38.--GIBBS' PATENT MODEL, 1857. (Smithsonian photo  45504-E.)]    Less Expensive Machines      While the \"Combination\" was attempting to solve the problems of patent  litigation, another problem faced the would-be home users of this new  invention. The budget limitations of the average family caused a demand  for a less expensive machine, for this first consumer appliance was a  most desirable commodity.[67]    There were many attempts to satisfy this demand, but one of the best and  most successful grew out of a young man's curiosity. James E. A. Gibbs'  first exposure to the sewing machine was in 1855 when, at the age of 24,  he saw a simple woodcut illustration of a Grover and Baker machine. The  woodcut represented only the upper part of the machine. Nothing in the  illustration indicated that more than one thread was used, and none of  the stitch-forming mechanism was visible. Gibbs assumed that the stitch  was formed with one thread; he then proceeded to imagine a mechanism  that would make a stitch with one thread. His solution was described in  his own statement:         As I was then living in a very out of the way place, far from       railroads and public conveyances of all kinds, modern improvements       seldom reached our locality, and not being likely to have my       curiosity satisfied otherwise, I set to work to see what I could       learn from the woodcut, which was not accompanied by any       description. I first discovered that the needle was attached to a       needle arm, and consequently could not pass entirely through the       material, but must retreat through the same hole by which it       entered. From this I saw that I could not make a stitch similar to       handwork, but must have some other mode of fastening the thread on       the underside, and among other possible methods of doing this, the       chainstitch occurred to me as a likely means of accomplishing the       end.         I next endeavored to discover how this stitch was or could be made,       and from the woodcut I saw that the driving shaft which had the       driving wheel on the outer end, passed along under the cloth"]]]
