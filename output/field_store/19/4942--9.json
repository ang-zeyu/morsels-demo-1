Some say that if pedigreed dogs were trained they would beat the  other dogs. The question is to train them. Hounds which come from  untrained or from partly or badly trained stock will always be poor  hunters. They will never be the dogs that they would have been had  they come from highly trained stock, that is that their sire and dam  and grand sire and grand dam were all trained by persons who  thoroughly understood the way of breeding and rearing as well as the  age and proper way of training. A hound coming from such selected  stock will learn and pick up in a day what will take others months  and probably a whole season to learn. I never kept a hound which  after having shown him the game and also blooded him once or twice  would not at once start to hunt because I consider that the sooner a  sportsman will shoot such dogs the better.    There are plenty of fox dogs that are good coon dogs, and a great  many coon dogs will run a fox to a finish, but the fox and coon dogs  are two very different dogs. There is also a greater difference in  the opinions of hunters, in regard to the coon dog than in any other  dogs.    Some want the full blooded hound, and some a cross with a foxhound;  here they differ again as to what dog to cross with; others want no  hound blood at all, but a shepherd; one wants a collie and another  just a dog. Then here is a hunter who insists on a silent dog; and  the next one says the silent trailer doesn't camp with him.    Now as I am not looking for trouble, I will agree with all of you.  Where coons are plentiful and you are likely to strike a coon track  in every cornfield, the half hound or even a cur dog, will get coons;  but where they are scarce and you may tramp until near morning, and  then strike a trail five or six hours old, if you get that coon, you  will need a dog with a good nose and one that tongues on a trail. But  there is one point on which you will all agree--if your dog does not  stay at a tree and bark good and plenty, he isn't much of a coon dog.  Consequently in breeding for coon dogs, this is the most important  point. Get as many other coon points as you can, but be sure his  ancestors have been good tree dogs, as far back as you can trace  them.    The very reason that there are so many culls in this country, is  because many hunters think a dog is a dog, and that any dog with long  ears is a hound. Ears count for nothing but looks; bent legs, ditto;  the only way that you can perfect the breed, which in your  estimation, is the ideal, is by choosing the dogs of the best  particular kind which you prefer. For instance, how could a hunter  expect to produce a strain of dogs with good, loud voices, if he  chooses as his breeders the poorest squallers in the lot? Nature is  nature, and it is only by studying her laws that we are able to  produce our ideal of any kind; also, if he wants an intelligent dog,  he must pick out the one with the most desired good points, and then  he is on the fair way to success.    In short, in order to have a hound that will repay you for his  training, he must be bred right in every detail or the hunter is  doomed to disappointment. If the hunter does not own a first class  pair to breed from and cannot secure a good strain in his locality,  he should buy from a reliable dealer, one whom he knows has made a  success of breeding this class of dogs. It is also advisable to buy a  young pup as the chances of securing the best are alike to all, or  even though the parent dogs are No. 1 in every respect, there will be  some in the litter that will be weak in points before they have  reached the age of eight months, the breeder himself will have  difficulty in choosing any one as the best.    There is a standard for judging the so-called high class pedigree  show dogs but which does not cut much ice with a fox and coon hunter.  Regardless of color, the qualities most desirable in an all around  fox hound are: 1st, staying qualities and powers of endurance. 2d,  voice, feet and general make up.      [Illustration: One-half English Bloodhound Pups.]    Personally, I like a hound that stands from 20 to 24 inches at  shoulder, long in body, deep chested, heavy boned with a coat of  rather long hair, the feet should be round in shape with a good  covering of hair to protect the soles or pads. A foxhound should not  have a second claw on the hind leg for this shows a cross in his  breeding. A dog that has these claws will not stand much hard running  in crust for by rubbing against trees, etc., they will gradually  become sore and bleeding, and the hound although willing enough is  handicapped with a pair of sore legs. Some hunters cut these claws  off while young. In the pure strain of fox dogs this would be  unnecessary as they would not have them on.    The first cost of a young hound is nothing compared with the time and  trouble it takes to bring him to a hunting age. Therefore, it is  advisable to buy the best obtainable for even though the price be  high at first cost, the hunter will be better satisfied for his time  and money when the dog has fully developed for the chase. In making a  choice for breeding, select a pair that has been thoroughly tried and  are known to have no weak points, such as poor voice, quitters, back  trackers, etc. It is also advisable to hunt with the bitch as much as  possible up to the very time the pups are whelped. The pups will be  stronger and better in every way than if the mother had been housed  in all the time, and a hunter will find that a pup so bred will take  to hunting almost as soon as he can run.    Do not breed a pair of young dogs, rather select if possible, an old  dog for a young bitch for by breeding two young dogs their pups are  apt to be hot-headed, over-anxious and these qualities are not wanted  in a foxhound.    To be sure of a strain of dogs the breeder must know their ancestors  three generations back for it is surprising how far back a pup will  breed from, not only in color but in characteristics, habits, etc.      [Illustration: Fox Hounds.]      [Illustration: Some Young Hunters.]        CHAPTER XIV--BREEDING (Continued).    Crossing for Coon Dogs.    My experience has been that the crossing of an English pointer dog  and American fox hound slut for 'coon dogs, are the best I ever saw,  writes an Ohio night hunter of rare judgment and experience, and I  will illustrate by relating the accomplishments of a certain dog of  the breeding. I will say further that the sire of this dog I mention  was the most remarkable I ever heard of--a fine large pointer, and  often when hunting quails or pheasants in the woods he would bark up  and had done it many times before they found out the cause.    One day while hunting pheasants he began to bark up a hollow beech  stub, and when called, refused to leave his post, and his hair was  slightly raised, which excited the hunter's curiosity and they  procured an axe and felled the stub. To their surprise, two large  'coons came rolling out and were dispatched. This solved the problem,  and after that, he was the cause of many 'coons losing their life, as  he located them in the den and trees where they had not stepped a  foot on the ground. I for one can surely recommend this cross to make  good 'coon dogs.      * * *    A few points in regard to a stud dog for fox. Pick a dog with a deep  chest, good strong loin, long head and stands with his feet well  under him. About the feet--take the foot in your hand, press gently,  and if it feels firm and springy like a piece of rubber, that dog has  a good foot, which is very necessary in a fox dog, but if he has a  soft, mushy foot, let that dog alone, no matter how good he looks,  for he will not stand long chases, and the old adage that like begets  like, will surely show itself in this case.      * * *    There are a great many worthless dogs, but the dogs are not to blame.  I am writing on fox dogs, but it holds good on all dogs. There is  always a worthless bitch, and sometimes several of them to be had for  nothing, and some fellow who wants a dog but don't want to pay a fair  price says, \"I'll get that bitch and breed her to that dog down at  Graysville. They say he's a crackerjack, and I'll get some good dogs  and they won't cost me anything either.\"    Well, when the time comes to breed it's five miles to Graysville, and  the roads are awful muddy, and he concluded to breed to Jim Jones'  dog just over the way, saying he ain't much of a dog, and a cousin to  the bitch, but his great-grandmother got more foxes than any dog over  in these parts, and some of the pups will breed back. He gets eight  or ten pups, which he gets perhaps $1.00 a piece for, and it costs  just as much to raise a poor one as a good one. The owners spend a  lot of time trying to make dogs of them and have nothing at last.    In a running dog these are the qualities I think are needed. First,  endurance, because no dog can make a race after a red fox without it.  Then speed, a good nose, lots of ambition, good sense and the more of  that the better; and will need to be able to hear well to enable him  to cut corners if he happens to get behind, as any dog is liable to  do.    After the pups are born, don't let the bitch run until they are  weaned, for it will hurt both mother and puppies. Should she get very  hot and then get to her pups you would likely lose some or perhaps  all of them.    Here we have still another favorite breed for 'coon hunting, advanced  by an old and tried hunter. Says he: My choice of a breed of coon dog  is a grade hound crossed on a bull or one-half hound, one-fourth rat  terrier and one-fourth Scotch collie or shepherd or fox hound and  beagle.    Says another: A hound to be a fine ranger does not require many years  of training if he comes from a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3434"],[0,"The Koran (Al-Qur'an) (#12)"],[1,"boil,    And when souls shall be paired with their bodies,    And when the female child that had been buried alive shall be asked    For what crime she was put to death,3    And when the leaves of the Book shall be unrolled,    And when the Heaven shall be stripped away,4    And when Hell shall be made to blaze,    And when Paradise shall be brought near,    Every soul shall know what it hath produced.

One day, the disturbing trumpet-blast shall disturb it,    Which the second blast shall follow:    Men's hearts on that day shall quake:    Their looks be downcast.    The infidels will say, \"Shall we indeed be restored as at first?    What! when we have become rotten bones?\"    \"This then,\" say they, \"will be a return to loss.\"    Verily, it will be but a single blast,    And lo! they are on the surface of the earth.    Hath the story of Moses reached thee?    When his Lord called to him in Towa's holy vale:    Go to Pharaoh, for he hath burst all bounds:    And say, \"Wouldest thou become just?    Then I will guide thee to thy Lord that thou mayest fear him.\"    And he showed him a great miracle,    But he treated him as an impostor, and rebelled;    Then turned he his back all hastily,    And gathered an assembly and proclaimed,    And said, \"I am your Lord supreme.\"    So God visited on him the punishment of this life and of the other.    Verily, herein is a lesson for him who hath the fear of God.    Are ye the harder to create, or the heaven which he hath built?    He reared its height and fashioned it,    And gave darkness to its night, and brought out its light,    And afterwards stretched forth the earth,    He brought forth from it its waters and its pastures;    And set the mountains firm    For you and your cattle to enjoy.    But when the grand overthrow shall come,    The day when a man shall reflect on the pains that he hath taken,    And Hell shall be in full view of all who are looking on;    Then, as for him who hath transgressed    And hath chosen this present life,    Verily, Hellthat shall be his dwelling-place:    But as to him who shall have feared the majesty of his Lord, and shall have  refrained his soul from lust,    Verily, Paradisethat shall be his dwelling-place.
