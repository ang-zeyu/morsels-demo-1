In the midst of so many discordant appearances, the mind is perplexed,  and can hardly fix upon any cause to which female delicacy is to be  ascribed. If we attend, however, to the whole animal creation, if we  consider it attentively wherever it falls under our observation, it will  discover to us, that in the female there is a greater degree of delicacy  or coy reserve than in the male. Is not this a proof, that, through the  wide extent of creation, the seeds of delicacy are more liberally  bestowed upon females than upon males?    In the remotest periods of which we have any historical account, we find  that the women had a delicacy to which the other sex were strangers.  Rebecca veiled herself when she first approached Isaac, her future  husband. Many of the fables of antiquity mark, with the most  distinguishing characters, the force of female delicacy. Of this kind is  the fable of Actaeon and Diana. Actaeon, a famous hunter, being in the  woods with his hounds, beating for game, accidentally spied Diana and  her nymphs bathing in a river. Prompted by curiosity, he stole silently  into a neighboring thicket, that he might have a nearer view of them.  The goddess discovering him, was so affronted at his audacity, and so  much ashamed to have been seen naked, that in revenge she immediately  transformed him into a stag, set his own hounds upon him, and encouraged  them to overtake and devour him. Besides this, and other fables, and  historical anecdotes of antiquity, their poets seldom exhibit a female  character without adorning it with the graces of modesty and delicacy.  Hence we may infer, that these qualities have not been only essential to  virtuous women in civilized countries, but were also constantly praised  and esteemed by men of sensibility; and that delicacy is an innate  principle in the female mind.    There are so many evils attending the loss of virtue in women, and so  greatly are the minds of that sex depraved when they have deviated from  the path of rectitude, that a general contamination of their morals may  be considered as one of the greatest misfortunes that can befal a state,  as in time it destroys almost every public virtue of the men. Hence all  wise legislators have strictly enforced upon the sex a particular purity  of manners; and not satisfied that they should abstain from vice only,  have required them even to shun every appearance of it.    Such, in some periods, were the laws of the Romans; and such were the  effects of these laws, that if ever female delicacy shone forth in a  conspicuous manner, it was perhaps among those people, after they had  worn off much of the barbarity of their first ages, and before they  became contaminated, by the wealth and manners of the nations which they  plundered and subjected. Then it was that we find many of their women  surpassing in modesty almost every thing related by fable; and then it  was that their ideas of delicacy were so highly refined, that they could  not even bear the secret consciousness of an involuntary crime, and far  less of having tacitly consented to it.      INFLUENCE OF FEMALE SOCIETY.    The company of ladies has a very powerful influence on the sentiments  and conduct of men. Women, the fruitful source of half our joys, and  perhaps of _more_ than half our sorrows, give an elegance to our manner,  and a relish to our pleasures. They soothe our afflictions, and soften  our cares. Too much of their company will render us effeminate, and  infallibly stamp upon us many signatures of the female nature. A rough  and unpolished behavior, as well as slovenliness of person, will  certainly be the consequence of an almost constant exclusion from it. By  spending a reasonable portion of our time in the company of women, and  another in the company of our own sex, we shall imbibe a proper share of  the softness of the female, and at the same time retain the firmness and  constancy of the male.    As little social intercourse subsisted between the two sexes, in the  more early ages of antiquity, we find the men less courteous, and the  women less engaging. Vivacity and cheerfulness seem hardly to have  existed. Even the Babylonians, who appear to have allowed their women  more liberty than any of the ancients, seem not to have lived with them  in a friendly and familiar manner. But, as their intercourse with them  was considerably greater than that of the neighboring nations, they  acquired thereby a polish and refinement unknown to any of the people  who surrounded them. The manners of both sexes were softer, and better  calculated to please.    They likewise paid more attention to cleanliness and dress.    After the Greeks became famous for their knowledge of the arts and  sciences, their rudeness and barbarity were only softened a _few  degrees_. It is not therefore arts, sciences, and _learning_, but the  company of the other sex, that forms the manner and renders the man  _agreeable_.    The Romans were, for some time, a community without any thing to soften  the ferocity of male nature. The Sabine virgins, whom they had stolen,  appear to have infused into them the first ideas of politeness. But it  was many ages before this politeness banished the roughness of the  warrior, and assumed the refinement of the gentleman.    During the times of chivalry, female influence was at the zenith of its  glory and perfection. It was the source of valor, it gave birth to  politeness, it awakened pity, it called forth benevolence, it restricted  the hand of oppression, and meliorated the human heart. \"I cannot  approach my mistress,\" said one, \"till I have done some glorious deed to  deserve her notice. Actions should be the messengers of the heart; they  are the homage due to beauty, and they only should discover love.\"    Marsan, instructing a young knight how to behave so as to gain the favor  of the fair, has these remarkable words:--\"When your arm is raised, if  your lance fail, draw your sword directly; and let heaven and hell  resound with the clash. Lifeless is the soul which beauty cannot  animate, and weak is the arm which cannot fight valiantly to defend it.\"    The Russians, Poles, and even the Dutch, pay less attention to their  females than any of their neighbors, and are, by consequence, less  distinguished for the graces of their persons, and the feelings of their  hearts.    The lightness of their food, and the salubrity of their air, have been  assigned as reasons for the vivacity and cheerfulness of the French, and  their fortitude, in supporting their spirits through all the adverse  circumstances of this world. But the constant mixture of the young and  old, of the two sexes, is no doubt one of the _principal_ reasons why  the cares and ills of life sit lighter on the shoulders of that  fantastic people, than on those of any other country in the world.    The French reckon an excursion dull, and a party of pleasure without  relish, unless a mixture of both sexes join to compose in. The French  women do not even withdraw from the table after meals; nor do the men  discover that impatience to have them dismissed, which they so often do  in England.    It is alleged by those who have no relish for the conversation of the  fair sex, that their presence curbs the freedom of speech, and  restrains the jollity of mirth. But, if the conversation and the mirth  are decent, if the company are capable of relishing any thing but wine,  the very reverse is the case. Ladies, in general, are not only more  cheerful than gentlemen, but more eager to promote mirth and good humor.    So powerful, indeed, are the company and conversation of the fair, in  diffusing happiness and hilarity, that even the cloud which hangs on the  _thoughtful brow_ of an Englishman, begins in the present age to  brighten, by his devoting to the ladies a larger share of time than was  formerly done by his ancestors.    Though the influence of the sexes be reciprocal, yet that of the ladies  is certainly the greatest. How often may one see a company of men, who  were disposed to be riotous, checked at once into decency by the  accidental entrance of an amiable woman; while her good sense and  obliging deportment charms them into at least a temporary conviction,  that there is nothing so delightful as female conversation, in its  best form! Were such conviction frequently repeated, what might we not  expect from it at last?    \"Were virtue,\" said an ancient philosopher, \"to appear amongst men in a  visible shape, what vehement desires would she enkindle!\" Virtue,  exhibited without affectation, by a lovely young person, of improved  understanding and gentle manners, may be said to appear with the most  alluring aspect, surrounded by the _Graces_.    It would be an easy matter to point out instances of the most evident  reformation, wrought on particular men, by their having happily  conceived a passion for virtuous women.    To form the manners of men, various causes contribute; but nothing,  perhaps, so much as the turn of the women with whom they converse. Those  who are most conversant with women of virtue and understanding, will be  always found the most amiable characters, other circumstances being  supposed alike. Such society, beyond every thing else, rubs off the  _corners_ that gives many of our sex an ungracious roughness. It  produces a polish more perfect, and more pleasing than that which is  received from a general commerce with the world. This last is often  specious, but commonly superficial. The other is the result of gentler  feelings, and more humanity. The heart itself is moulded. Habits of  undissembled courtesy are formed. A certain flowing urbanity is  acquired.

[58]    If she had long continued to assemble round her the best society of  London, it is probable that her kindness and courtesy would have done  much to efface the unfavourable impression made by his stern and frigid  demeanour. Unhappily his physical infirmities made it impossible for him  to reside at Whitehall. The air of Westminster, mingled with the fog  of the river which in spring tides overflowed the courts of his palace,  with the smoke of seacoal from two hundred thousand chimneys, and with  the fumes of all the filth which was then suffered to accumulate in  the streets, was insupportable to him; for his lungs were weak, and his  sense of smell exquisitely keen. His constitutional asthma made rapid  progress. His physicians pronounced it impossible that he could live  to the end of the year. His face was so ghastly that he could hardly be  recognised. Those who had to transact business with him were shocked to  hear him gasping for breath, and coughing till the tears ran down his  cheeks. [59] His mind, strong as it was, sympathized with his body. His  judgment was indeed as clear as ever. But there was, during some  months, a perceptible relaxation of that energy by which he had been  distinguished. Even his Dutch friends whispered that he was not the man  that he had been at the Hague. [60] It was absolutely necessary that he  should quit London. He accordingly took up his residence in the purer  air of Hampton Court. That mansion, begun by the magnificent Wolsey, was  a fine specimen of the architecture which flourished in England under  the first Tudors; but the apartments were not, according to the notions  of the seventeenth century, well fitted for purposes of state. Our  princes therefore had, since the Restoration, repaired thither seldom,  and only when they wished to live for a time in retirement. As William  purposed to make the deserted edifice his chief palace, it was necessary  for him to build and to plant; nor was the necessity disagreeable to  him. For he had, like most of his countrymen, a pleasure in decorating  a country house; and next to hunting, though at a great interval, his  favourite amusements were architecture and gardening. He had already  created on a sandy heath in Guelders a paradise, which attracted  multitudes of the curious from Holland and Westphalia. Mary had laid the  first stone of the house. Bentinck had superintended the digging of the  fishponds. There were cascades and grottoes, a spacious orangery, and  an aviary which furnished Hondekoeter with numerous specimens of  manycoloured plumage. [61] The King, in his splendid banishment, pined  for this favourite seat, and found some consolation in creating another  Loo on the banks of the Thames. Soon a wide extent of ground was laid  out in formal walks and parterres. Much idle ingenuity was employed in  forming that intricate labyrinth of verdure which has puzzled and amused  five generations of holiday visitors from London. Limes thirty years  old were transplanted from neighbouring woods to shade the alleys.  Artificial fountains spouted among the flower beds. A new court, not  designed with the purest taste, but stately, spacious, and commodious,  rose under the direction of Wren. The wainscots were adorned with the  rich and delicate carvings of Gibbons. The staircases were in a blaze  with the glaring frescoes of Verrio. In every corner of the mansion  appeared a profusion of gewgaws, not yet familiar to English eyes. Mary  had acquired at the Hague a taste for the porcelain of China, and amused  herself by forming at Hampton a vast collection of hideous images, and  of vases on which houses, trees, bridges, and mandarins were depicted  in outrageous defiance of all the laws of perspective. The fashion, a  frivolous and inelegant fashion it must be owned, which was thus set  by the amiable Queen, spread fast and wide. In a few years almost  every great house in the kingdom contained a museum of these grotesque  baubles. Even statesmen and generals were not ashamed to be renowned as  judges of teapots and dragons; and satirists long continued to repeat  that a fine lady valued her mottled green pottery quite as much as she  valued her monkey, and much more than she valued her husband. [62] But  the new palace was embellished with works of art of a very different  kind. A gallery was erected for the cartoons of Raphael. Those great  pictures, then and still the finest on our side of the Alps, had been  preserved by Cromwell from the fate which befell most of the other  masterpieces in the collection of Charles the First, but had been  suffered to lie during many years nailed up in deal boxes. They were  now brought forth from obscurity to be contemplated by artists with  admiration and despair. The expense of the works at Hampton was a  subject of bitter complaint to many Tories, who had very gently blamed  the boundless profusion with which Charles the Second had built and  rebuilt, furnished and refurnished, the dwelling of the Duchess of  Portsmouth. [63] The expense, however, was not the chief cause of the  discontent which William's change of residence excited. There was no  longer a Court at Westminster. Whitehall, once the daily resort of the  noble and the powerful, the beautiful and the gay, the place to which  fops came to show their new peruques, men of gallantry to exchange  glances with fine ladies, politicians to push their fortunes, loungers  to hear the news, country gentlemen to see the royal family, was now,  in the busiest season of the year, when London was full, when Parliament  was sitting, left desolate. A solitary sentinel paced the grassgrown  pavement before that door which had once been too narrow for the  opposite streams of entering and departing courtiers. The services which  the metropolis had rendered to the King were great and recent; and it  was thought that he might have requited those services better than by  treating it as Lewis had treated Paris. Halifax ventured to hint this,  but was silenced by a few words which admitted of no reply. \"Do you  wish,\" said William peevishly, \"to see me dead?\" [64]    In a short time it was found that Hampton Court was too far from the  Houses of Lords and Commons, and from the public offices, to be the  ordinary abode of the Sovereign. Instead, however, of returning to  Whitehall, William determined to have another dwelling, near enough to  his capital for the transaction of business, but not near enough to be  within that atmosphere in which he could not pass a night without risk  of suffocation. At one time he thought of Holland House, the villa of  the noble family of Rich; and he actually resided there some weeks.  [65] But he at length fixed his choice on Kensington House, the suburban  residence of the Earl of Nottingham. The purchase was made for eighteen  thousand guineas, and was followed by more building, more planting,  more expense, and more discontent. [66] At present Kensington House is  considered as a part of London. It was then a rural mansion, and could  not, in those days of highwaymen and scourers, of roads deep in mire and  nights without lamps, be the rallying point of fashionable society.    It was well known that the King, who treated the English nobility and  gentry so ungraciously, could, in a small circle of his own countrymen,  be easy, friendly, even jovial, could pour out his feelings garrulously,  could fill his glass, perhaps too often; and this was, in the view of  our forefathers, an aggravation of his offences. Yet our forefathers  should have had the sense and the justice to acknowledge that the  patriotism which they considered as a virtue in themselves, could not be  a fault in him. It was unjust to blame him for not at once transferring  to our island the love which he bore to the country of his birth. If, in  essentials, he did his duty towards England, he might well be suffered  to feel at heart an affectionate preference for Holland. Nor is it  a reproach to him that he did not, in this season of his greatness,  discard companions who had played with him in his childhood, who had  stood by him firmly through all the vicissitudes of his youth and  manhood, who had, in defiance of the most loathsome and deadly forms of  infection, kept watch by his sick-bed, who had, in the thickest of the  battle, thrust themselves between him and the French swords, and whose  attachment was, not to the Stadtholder or to the King, but to plain  William of Nassau. It may be added that his old friends could not but  rise in his estimation by comparison with his new courtiers. To the  end of his life all his Dutch comrades, without exception, continued  to deserve his confidence. They could be out of humour with him, it is  true; and, when out of humour, they could be sullen and rude; but  never did they, even when most angry and unreasonable, fail to keep  his secrets and to watch over his interests with gentlemanlike and  soldierlike fidelity. Among his English councillors such fidelity was  rare. [67] It is painful, but it is no more than just, to acknowledge  that he had but too good reason for thinking meanly of our national  character. That character was indeed, in essentials, what it has always  been. Veracity, uprightness, and manly boldness were then, as now,  qualities eminently English. But those qualities, though widely diffused  among the great body of the people, were seldom to be found in the  class with which William was best acquainted. The standard of honour and  virtue among our public men was, during his reign, at the very lowest  point. His predecessors had bequeathed to him a court foul with all the  vices of the Restoration, a court swarming with sycophants, who  were ready, on the first turn of fortune, to abandon him as they had  abandoned his uncle. Here and there, lost in that ignoble crowd, was to  be found a"]]]
