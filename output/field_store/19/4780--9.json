Mathematics, perhaps more even than the study of Greece and Rome, has  suffered from this oblivion of its due place in civilisation. Although  tradition has decreed that the great bulk of educated men shall know  at least the elements of the subject, the reasons for which the  tradition arose are forgotten, buried beneath a great rubbish-heap of  pedantries and trivialities. To those who inquire as to the purpose of  mathematics, the usual answer will be that it facilitates the making  of machines, the travelling from place to place, and the victory over  foreign nations, whether in war or commerce. If it be objected that  these ends--all of which are of doubtful value--are not furthered by  the merely elementary study imposed upon those who do not become  expert mathematicians, the reply, it is true, will probably be that  mathematics trains the reasoning faculties. Yet the very men who make  this reply are, for the most part, unwilling to abandon the teaching  of definite fallacies, known to be such, and instinctively rejected by  the unsophisticated mind of every intelligent learner. And the  reasoning faculty itself is generally conceived, by those who urge its  cultivation, as merely a means for the avoidance of pitfalls and a  help in the discovery of rules for the guidance of practical life. All  these are undeniably important achievements to the credit of  mathematics; yet it is none of these that entitles mathematics to a  place in every liberal education. Plato, we know, regarded the  contemplation of mathematical truths as worthy of the Deity; and  Plato realised, more perhaps than any other single man, what those  elements are in human life which merit a place in heaven. There is in  mathematics, he says, \"something which is _necessary_ and cannot be  set aside ... and, if I mistake not, of divine necessity; for as to  the human necessities of which the Many talk in this connection,  nothing can be more ridiculous than such an application of the words.  _Cleinias._ And what are these necessities of knowledge, Stranger,  which are divine and not human? _Athenian._ Those things without some  use or knowledge of which a man cannot become a God to the world, nor  a spirit, nor yet a hero, nor able earnestly to think and care for  man\" (_Laws_, p. 818).[10] Such was Plato's judgment of mathematics;  but the mathematicians do not read Plato, while those who read him  know no mathematics, and regard his opinion upon this question as  merely a curious aberration.    Mathematics, rightly viewed, possesses not only truth, but supreme  beauty--a beauty cold and austere, like that of sculpture, without  appeal to any part of our weaker nature, without the gorgeous  trappings of painting or music, yet sublimely pure, and capable of a  stern perfection such as only the greatest art can show. The true  spirit of delight, the exaltation, the sense of being more than man,  which is the touchstone of the highest excellence, is to be found in  mathematics as surely as in poetry. What is best in mathematics  deserves not merely to be learnt as a task, but to be assimilated as a  part of daily thought, and brought again and again before the mind  with ever-renewed encouragement. Real life is, to most men, a long  second-best, a perpetual compromise between the ideal and the  possible; but the world of pure reason knows no compromise, no  practical limitations, no barrier to the creative activity embodying  in splendid edifices the passionate aspiration after the perfect from  which all great work springs. Remote from human passions, remote even  from the pitiful facts of nature, the generations have gradually  created an ordered cosmos, where pure thought can dwell as in its  natural home, and where one, at least, of our nobler impulses can  escape from the dreary exile of the actual world.    So little, however, have mathematicians aimed at beauty, that hardly  anything in their work has had this conscious purpose. Much, owing to  irrepressible instincts, which were better than avowed beliefs, has  been moulded by an unconscious taste; but much also has been spoilt by  false notions of what was fitting. The characteristic excellence of  mathematics is only to be found where the reasoning is rigidly  logical: the rules of logic are to mathematics what those of structure  are to architecture. In the most beautiful work, a chain of argument  is presented in which every link is important on its own account, in  which there is an air of ease and lucidity throughout, and the  premises achieve more than would have been thought possible, by means  which appear natural and inevitable. Literature embodies what is  general in particular circumstances whose universal significance  shines through their individual dress; but mathematics endeavours to  present whatever is most general in its purity, without any irrelevant  trappings.    How should the teaching of mathematics be conducted so as to  communicate to the learner as much as possible of this high ideal?  Here experience must, in a great measure, be our guide; but some  maxims may result from our consideration of the ultimate purpose to be  achieved.    One of the chief ends served by mathematics, when rightly taught, is  to awaken the learner's belief in reason, his confidence in the truth  of what has been demonstrated, and in the value of demonstration. This  purpose is not served by existing instruction; but it is easy to see  ways in which it might be served. At present, in what concerns  arithmetic, the boy or girl is given a set of rules, which present  themselves as neither true nor false, but as merely the will of the  teacher, the way in which, for some unfathomable reason, the teacher  prefers to have the game played. To some degree, in a study of such  definite practical utility, this is no doubt unavoidable; but as soon  as possible, the reasons of rules should be set forth by whatever  means most readily appeal to the childish mind. In geometry, instead  of the tedious apparatus of fallacious proofs for obvious truisms  which constitutes the beginning of Euclid, the learner should be  allowed at first to assume the truth of everything obvious, and should  be instructed in the demonstrations of theorems which are at once  startling and easily verifiable by actual drawing, such as those in  which it is shown that three or more lines meet in a point. In this  way belief is generated; it is seen that reasoning may lead to  startling conclusions, which nevertheless the facts will verify; and  thus the instinctive distrust of whatever is abstract or rational is  gradually overcome. Where theorems are difficult, they should be first  taught as exercises in geometrical drawing, until the figure has  become thoroughly familiar; it will then be an agreeable advance to be  taught the logical connections of the various lines or circles that  occur. It is desirable also that the figure illustrating a theorem  should be drawn in all possible cases and shapes, that so the abstract  relations with which geometry is concerned may of themselves emerge  as the residue of similarity amid such great apparent diversity. In  this way the abstract demonstrations should form but a small part of  the instruction, and should be given when, by familiarity with  concrete illustrations, they have come to be felt as the natural  embodiment of visible fact. In this early stage proofs should not be  given with pedantic fullness; definitely fallacious methods, such as  that of superposition, should be rigidly excluded from the first, but  where, without such methods, the proof would be very difficult, the  result should be rendered acceptable by arguments and illustrations  which are explicitly contrasted with demonstrations.    In the beginning of algebra, even the most intelligent child finds, as  a rule, very great difficulty. The use of letters is a mystery, which  seems to have no purpose except mystification. It is almost  impossible, at first, not to think that every letter stands for some  particular number, if only the teacher would reveal _what_ number it  stands for. The fact is, that in algebra the mind is first taught to  consider general truths, truths which are not asserted to hold only of  this or that particular thing, but of any one of a whole group of  things. It is in the power of understanding and discovering such  truths that the mastery of the intellect over the whole world of  things actual and possible resides; and ability to deal with the  general as such is one of the gifts that a mathematical education  should bestow. But how little, as a rule, is the teacher of algebra  able to explain the chasm which divides it from arithmetic, and how  little is the learner assisted in his groping efforts at  comprehension! Usually the method that has been adopted in arithmetic  is continued: rules are set forth, with no adequate explanation of  their grounds; the pupil learns to use the rules blindly, and  presently, when he is able to obtain the answer that the teacher  desires, he feels that he has mastered the difficulties of the  subject. But of inner comprehension of the processes employed he has  probably acquired almost nothing.    When algebra has been learnt, all goes smoothly until we reach those  studies in which the notion of infinity is employed--the infinitesimal  calculus and the whole of higher mathematics. The solution of the  difficulties which formerly surrounded the mathematical infinite is  probably the greatest achievement of which our own age has to boast.  Since the beginnings of Greek thought these difficulties have been  known; in every age the finest intellects have vainly endeavoured to  answer the apparently unanswerable questions that had been asked by  Zeno the Eleatic. At last Georg Cantor has found the answer, and has  conquered for the intellect a new and vast province which had"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25449"],[0,"The Young Castellan: A Tale of the English Civil War (#12)"],[1,"  leave.\"    \"Quite right, Captain Roy,\" said Lady Royland, smiling.    The boy looked at her wonderingly.    \"My heart is more at rest, dear,\" she said, gently, \"and that aching  anxiety is at an end.  Roy, we know the worst, and we must act for the  best.\"        CHAPTER EIGHT.    BEN MEANS BUSINESS.    With his blood seeming to effervesce in his veins from the excitement he  felt, Roy placed the writing-materials in front of his mother and then  hurried out, crossed the drawbridge, and made for the little gate tower,  where, upon hearing steps, the old retainer came out, bent of head and  stooping, with one ear raised.    \"Master Roy's step,\" he said; and as the boy came closer: \"Yes, it's  you, sir; just like your father's step, sir, only younger.  What's the  news, Master Roy?\"    \"Bad, Jenk,--civil war has broken out.  Father is well and with his  regiment, but there is great trouble in the land.  I'm going to put the  castle in a state of defence.  Shut the gate again and keep it close.  No one is to come in or out without an order from my mother or from me.\"    \"That's right, Master Roy, sir; that's right,\" piped the retainer.  \"I'll just buckle on my sword at once.  She's as sharp and bright as  ever she was.  Nobody shall go by.  So there's to be a bit of a war, is  there?\"    \"Yes, I'm afraid so, Jenk.\"    \"Don't say afraid so, Master Roy; sounds as if you would be skeart, and  your father's son couldn't be that.  But nobody goes by here without  your orders, sir, or my lady's, and so I tell 'em.  I'm getting on a bit  in years, and I can't see quite as well as I should do, not like I used;  but it's the sperrit as does it, Master Roy.\"    \"So it is, Jenk; and you've got plenty in you, haven't you?\"    \"Ay, ay, ay, Master Roy,\" quavered the old man, \"plenty.  Up at the  house there they get talking about me as if I was so very old; but I'll  let some of 'em see.  Why, I want five year o' being a hundred yet, and  look at what they used to be in the Scripter.  I'll keep the gate fast,  sir--I did this morning, didn't I, when they three dragoons come up?\"    \"Yes, capitally, Jenk--but I must go.  I'm busy.\"    \"That's right, sir--you go.  Don't you be uneasy about the gate, sir.  I'll see to that.\"    \"Yes,\" said Roy to himself, \"it is the spirit that does it.  Now I  wonder whether I've got spirit enough to do all the work before me!\"    He hurried back over the drawbridge, and glanced down into the clear  moat where he could see the great pike lying, but he did not stop to  think about catching it, for he hurried on to the servants' hall,  drawing himself up as he felt the importance of his position, and upon  entering, the three troopers, who were seated at a good substantial  meal, all rose and saluted their colonel's son.    \"Got all you want, men?\" said Roy, startling himself by his decisive way  of speaking.    \"Yes, sir; plenty, sir,\" said the man who bore the despatch.  \"Master  Martlet saw to that.\"    \"That's right.  Now, look here, of course we want you and your horses to  have a good rest, but when do you think you'll be ready to take a  despatch back?\"    \"Take a despatch back, sir?\" said the man, staring.  \"We're not to take  anything back.\"    \"Yes; a letter to my father.\"    \"No, sir.  Colonel Sir Granby Royland's, orders were that we were to  stop here and to help take care of the castle.\"    \"Were those my father's commands?\" cried Roy, eagerly.    \"Yes, sir, to all three of us--all five of us, it were, and I'm sorry I  couldn't bring the other two with me; but I did my best, didn't I,  lads?\"    \"Ay, corporal,\" chorused the others.    \"Oh, that's capital!\" cried Roy, eagerly.  \"It relieves me of a good  deal of anxiety.  But my father--he'll expect a letter back.\"    \"No, sir; he said there was no knowing where he would be with the  regiment, and we were to stay here till he sent orders for us to  rejoin.\"    \"Where is Martlet?\" asked Roy then.    \"Said something about an armoury,\" replied the corporal.    Roy hurried off, and in a few minutes found the old soldier busy with a  bottle of oil and a goose feather, applying the oil to the mechanism of  a row of firelocks.    \"Oh, here you are, Ben,\" cried Roy, excitedly.  \"News for you, man.\"    \"Ay, ay, sir, I've heard,\" said the old soldier, sadly.  \"More rust.\"    \"Yes, for you to keep off.  My father's orders are that the castle is to  be put in a state of defence directly.\"    Down went the bottle on the floor, and the oil began to trickle out.    \"But--but,\" stammered the old fellow, \"what does her ladyship say?\"    \"That she trusts to my father's faithful old follower to work with me,  and do everything possible for the defence of the place.  Hurrah, Ben!  God save the king!\"    \"Hurrah!  God save the king!\" roared Ben; and running to the wall he  snatched a sword from where it hung, drew it, and waved it round his  head.  \"Hah!  Master Roy, you've made me feel ten years younger with  those few words.\"    \"Have I, Ben?  Why, somehow all this has made me feel ten years older.\"    \"Then you've got a bit off me that I had to spare, Master Roy, and good  luck to you with it.  Then,\" he continued, after listening with eager  attention to Roy's rendering of his father's orders, \"we must go to work  at once, sir.\"    \"Yes; at once, Ben.\"    \"Then the first thing is to order the gate to be kept shut, and that no  one goes out or in unless he has a pass from her ladyship or from you.\"    \"Done, Ben.  I have been to old Jenk, and he has shut the gate, and  buckled on his old sword.\"    \"Hah! hum! yes,\" said the old soldier, rubbing one of his ears; \"that  sounds very nice, Master Roy, but,\" he continued, with a look of  perplexity, \"it doesn't mean much, now, does it?\"    \"I don't understand you.\"    \"Why, sir, I mean this: that if any one came up to the gate and wanted  to come in--`Give the pass,' says Jenk.  `Haven't got one,' says whoever  it is.  `Can't pass, then,' says Jenk, and then--\"    \"Well, yes, and then?\" said Roy.  \"Why, sir, if he took a good deep  breath, and then gave a puff, he'd blow poor old Jenk into the moat.  He's a good old boy, and I don't want to hurt his feelings, but we can't  leave things at the gate like that.\"    \"But it would break his heart to be told he is--he--\"    \"Too rusty to go on, sir,\" said Ben, grimly.  \"But it would break her  ladyship's heart if we didn't do our duty, and we shan't be doing that  if we leave our outwork in the hands of poor old Jenk.\"    \"What's to be done?\"    \"I know, sir.  Tell him the gate's very important, and that he must have  two men with him, and let him suppose they're under his command.\"    \"That's it, capital!\" cried Roy.  \"Then we must place two men there with  him at once.\"    \"Ye-e-es, sir,\" said Ben, drily.  \"But who are we to place there--  ourselves?\"    Roy looked hard at Ben, and Ben looked hard at Roy.    \"You see, sir, we've got the castle and the weepuns, but we've no  garrison.  That's the first thing to see to.  Why, when those three  troopers have gone back with their despatch, we shall have as good as  nobody.\"    \"But they're not going back, Ben.  Father's orders are that they're to  stay.\"    \"Three trained soldiers, sir, to start with!\" cried Ben.  \"Me four, and  you five.  Why, that's just like five seeds out of which we can grow a  little army.\"    \"Then there are the men-servants.\"    \"Well, sir, they're more used to washing cups and cleaning knives, and  plate, and horses; but we shall have to lick 'em into shape.  Let's see,  there's the three men indoors, the groom, and coachman, that makes five  more.\"    \"And the two gardeners.\"    \"Of course, sir!  Why, they'll make the best of 'em all.  Twelve of us.\"    \"And Master Pawson, thirteen.\"    \"P'ff! him!\" cried Ben, with a look of contempt.  \"What's he going to  do?  Read to the sentries, sir, to keep 'em from going to sleep?\"    \"Oh, he'll be of some use, Ben.  We mustn't despise any one.\"    \"Right, sir; we mustn't: so as soon as he comes back--he's gone over to  Parson Meldew's--\"    \"Yes, I know.\"    \"You tell him to get to his books and read all he can about sword and  pike wounds, and how to take a bullet out of a man when he gets hit.  Then he can cut up bandages, and get ready knives and scissors and  thread and big needles.\"    \"Do you mean in case of wounds, Ben?\"    \"Why, of course, sir.\"    \"But do you think it likely that we shall have some--\"    \"Rather queer sort of siege if we don't have some damage done, sir.  Well, that settles about Master Pawson.  Now, what next?\"    \"The men at the farm, Ben.\"    \"Yes, sir; we ought to get about ten or a dozen.  They're good stout  lads.  We must have them up at once and do a bit of drilling.  They  needn't stay here yet, but they can be got in order and ready to come in  at a moment's notice.  Next?\"    \"All the tenants must be seen, Ben.  They'll all come too, and drill  ready for service if wanted.\"    \"And that means about another twenty, I suppose, sir.\"    \"Yes, or more, Ben.\"    \"If they're staunch, sir.\"    \"Ah, but they would be.  My father's own tenants!\"    \"I dunno, sir.  If times are going to be like we hear, you'll find  people pretty ready to go over to the strongest side.\"    \"Oh, nonsense!  There isn't a man round here who wouldn't shout for the  king.\"    \"Quite right, sir,\" said Ben.  \"I believe that.\"    \"Then why do you throw out such nasty hints?\"    \"'Cause I've got my doubts, sir.  Lots on 'em'll shout for the king, but  if it comes to the pinch and things are going wrong, I want to know how  many will fight for the king.\"    \"Every true man, Ben.\"    \"Azackly, sir; but, you see, there's a orful lot o' liars in the world.  But we shall see.\"    \"Well, we've got to keep the castle, Ben.\"    \"We have, sir, and keep it we will, till everybody's about wounded or  dead, and the enemy comes swarming and cheering in, and then they shan't  have it.\"    \"Why, they'll have got it, Ben,\" said Roy, laughing, but rather"]]]
