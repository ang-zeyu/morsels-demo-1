[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37215"],[0,"The Argus Pheasant (#12)"],[1,"an urgent  request to Van Slyck to come to his house at once.    Van Slyck was putting the finishing touches to an exquisite toilet when  he received the message.    \"What ails the doddering old fool now?\" he growled irritably as he read  Muller's appeal. \"Another Malay run amuck, I suppose. Every time a few  of these _bruinevels_ (brown-skins) get krissed he thinks the whole  province is going to flame into revolt.\"    Tossing the note into an urn, he leisurely resumed his dressing. It was  not until he was carefully barbered, his hair shampooed and perfumed,  his nails manicured, and his mustache waxed and twisted to the exact  angle that a two-months old French magazine of fashion dictated as the  mode, that the dapper captain left the stockade. He was quite certain  that the last living representative of the ancient house of Van Slyck of  Amsterdam would never be seen in public in dirty linen and unwashed,  regardless how far _mynheer the controlleur_ might forget his  self-respect and the dignity of his office.    Van Slyck was leisurely strolling along the tree-lined lane that led  from the iron-wood stockade to the cluster of houses colloquially  designated \"Amsterdam\" when the impatient Muller perceived his approach.    \"Devil take the man, why doesn't he hurry?\" the _controlleur_ swore.  With a peremptory gesture he signaled Van Slyck to make haste.    \"By the beard of Nassau,\" the captain exclaimed. \"Does that swine think  he can make a Van Slyck skip like a butcher's boy? Things have come to a  pretty pass in the colonies when a Celebes half-breed imagines he can  make the best blood of Amsterdam fetch and carry for him.\"    Deliberately turning his back on the _controlleur_, he affected to  admire the surpassingly beautiful bay of Bulungan, heaven's own blue  melting into green on the shingly shore, with a thousand sabres of  iridescent foam stabbing the morning horizon. Muller was fuming when the  commandant finally sauntered on the veranda, selected a fat, black cigar  from the humidor, and gracefully lounged in an easy chair.    \"_Donder en bliksem! kapitein_, but you lie abed later every morning,\"  he growled.    Van Slyck's thin lips curled with aristocratic scorn.    \"We cannot all be such conscientious public servants as you, _mynheer_,\"  he observed ironically.    Muller was in that state of nervous agitation that a single jarring word  would have roused an unrestricted torrent of abuse. Fortunately for Van  Slyck, however, he was obtuse to irony. He took the remark literally and  for the moment, like oil on troubled waters, it calmed the rising tide  of his wrath at what he deemed the governor-general's black ingratitude.    \"Well, _kapitein, gij kebt gelijk_ (you are right, captain)\" he assented  heavily. The blubbery folds under his chin crimsoned with his cheeks in  complacent self-esteem. \"There are not many men who would have done so  well as I have under the conditions I had to face--under the conditions  I had to face--_kapitein_. _Ja!_ Not many men. I have worked and slaved  to build up this residency. For two years now I have done a double  duty--I have been both resident and _controlleur_. _Jawel!_\"    Recollection of the skipper's unpleasant news recurred to him. His face  darkened like a tropic sky before a cloudburst.    \"And what is my reward, _kapitein_? What is my reward? To have some  _Amsterdamsche papegaai_ (parrot) put over me.\" His fist came down  wrathily on the arm of his chair. \"Ten thousand devils! It is enough to  make a man turn pirate.\"    Van Slyck's cynical face lit with a sudden interest.    \"You have heard from Ah Sing?\" he inquired.    \"Ah Sing? No. _Drommel noch toe!_\" Muller swore. \"Who mentioned Ah Sing?  That thieving Deutscher who runs the schooner we had in port over-night  told me this not an hour ago. The whole of Batavia knows it. They are  talking it in every _rumah makan_. And we sit here and know nothing.  That is the kind of friends we have in Batavia.\"    Van Slyck, apprehensive that the impending change might affect him,  speculated swiftly how much the _controlleur_ knew.    \"It is strange that Ah Sing hasn't let us know,\" he remarked.    \"Ah Sing?\" Muller growled. \"Ah Sing? That bloodsucker is all for  himself. He would sell us out to Van Schouten in a minute if he thought  he saw any profit in it. _Ja!_ I have even put money into his ventures,  and this is how he treats me.\"    \"Damnably, I must say,\" Van Slyck agreed sympathetically. \"That is, if  he knows.\"    \"If he knows, _mynheer kapitein_? Of course he knows. Has he not  _agenten_ in every corner of this archipelago? Has he not a spy in the  _paleis_ itself?\"    \"He should have sent us word,\" Van Slyck agreed. \"Unless _mynheer_, the  new resident, is one of us. Who did you say it is, _mynheer_?\"    \"How the devil should I know?\" Muller growled irritably. \"All I know is  what I told you--that the whole of Batavia says Bulungan is to have a  new resident.\"    Van Slyck's face fell. He had hoped that the _controlleur_ knew at least  the identity of the new executive of the province. Having extracted all  the information Muller had, he dropped the cloak of sympathy and  remarked with cool insolence:    \"Since you don't know, I think you had better make it your business to  find out, _mynheer_.\"    Muller looked at him doubtfully. \"You might make an effort also,  _kapitein_,\" he suggested. \"You have friends in Batavia. It is your  concern as well as mine, a new resident would ruin our business.\"    \"I don't think he will,\" Van Slyck replied coolly. \"If he isn't one of  us he won't bother us long. Ah Sing won't let any prying reformer  interfere with business while the profits are coming in as well as they  are.\"    A shadow of anxiety crossed Muller's face. He cast a troubled look at  Van Slyck, who affected to admire the multi-tinted color display of  jungle, sun, and sea.    \"What--what do you mean, _kapitein_?\" he asked hesitantly.    \"People sometimes begin voyages they do not finish,\" Van Slyck observed.  \"A man might eat a pomegranate that didn't agree with him--pouf--the  colic, and it is all over. There is nothing so uncertain as life,  _mynheer_.\"    The captain replaced his cigar between his teeth with a flourish.  Muller's pudgy hands caught each other convulsively. The folds under his  chin flutterred. He licked his lips before he spoke.    \"_Kapitein_--you mean he might come to an unhappy end on the way?\" he  faltered.    \"Why not?\" Van Slyck concentrated his attention on his cigar.    \"_Neen, neen_, let us have no bloodshed,\" Muller vetoed anxiously. \"We  have had enough--\" He looked around nervously as though he feared  someone might be overhearing him. \"Let him alone. We shall find some way  to get rid of him. But let there be no killing.\"    Van Slyck turned his attention from the landscape to the _controlleur_.  There was a look in the captain's face that made Muller wince and shift  his eyes, a look of cyincal contempt, calm, frank, and unconcealed. It  was the mask lifting, for Van Slyck despised his associate. Bold and  unscrupulous, sticking at nothing that might achieve his end, he had no  patience with the timid, faltering, often conscience-stricken  _controlleur_.    \"Well, _mynheer_,\" Van Slyck observed at length, \"you are getting  remarkably thin-skinned all of a sudden.\"    He laughed sardonically. Muller winced and replied hastily:    \"I have been thinking, _kapitein_, that the proa crews have been doing  too much killing lately. I am going to tell Ah Sing that it must be  stopped. There are other ways--we can unload the ships and land their  crews on some island--\"    \"To starve, or to be left to the tender mercies of the Bajaus and the  Bugis,\" Van Slyck sneered. \"That would be more tender-hearted. You would  at least transfer the responsibility.\"    Muller's agitation became more pronounced.    \"But we must not let it go on, _kapitein_,\" he urged. \"It hurts the  business. Pretty soon we will have an investigation, one of these  gun-boats will pick up one of our proas, somebody will tell, and what  will happen to us then?\"    \"We'll be hung,\" Van Slyck declared succinctly.    Muller's fingers leaped in an involuntary frantic gesture to his throat,  as though he felt cords tightening around his windpipe. His face paled.    \"_Lieve hemel, kapitein_, don't speak of such things,\" he gasped.    \"Then don't talk drivel,\" Van Slyck snarled. \"You can't make big profits  without taking big chances. And you can't have piracy without a little  blood-letting. We're in this now, and there's no going back. So stop  your squealing.\"    Settling back into his chair, he looked calmly seaward and exhaled huge  clouds of tobacco smoke. The frown deepened on Muller's troubled brow as  he stared vacantly across the crushed coral-shell highway.    \"You can think of no reason why his excellency should be offended with  us, _kapitein_?\" he ventured anxiously.    The _controlleur's_ eagerness to include him in his misfortune,  evidenced by the use of the plural pronoun, evoked a sardonic flicker in  Van Slyck's cold, gray eyes.    \"No, _mynheer_, I cannot conceive why the governor should want to get  rid of so valuable a public servant as you are,\" he assured ironically.  \"You have certainly done your best. There have been a few disturbances,  of course, some head-hunting, and the taxes have not been paid, but  outside of such minor matters everything has done well, very well  indeed.\"    \"_Donder en bliksem_,\" Muller exclaimed, \"how can I raise taxes when  those Midianites, the hill Dyaks, will not let my coast Dyaks grow a  spear of rice? Has there been a month without a raid? Answer me,  _kapitein_. Have you spent a whole month in the stockade without being  called to beat back some of these thieving plunderers and drive them  into their hills?\"    The sardonic smile flashed across Van Slyck's face again.    \"Quite true, _mynheer_. But sometimes I don't know if I blame the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3725"],[0,"Famous Men of the Middle Ages (#12)"],[1,"and invaded the beautiful  island.    The new invaders met with brave resistance. The Britons were headed  by King Arthur, about whom many marvelous stories are told. His  court was held at Caerleon (_caer'le-on_), in North Wales, where  his hundred and fifty knights banqueted at their famous \"Round  Table.\"    The British king and his knights fought with desperate heroism.  But they could not drive back the Saxons and their companions and  were obliged to seek refuge in the western mountainous parts of  the island, just as their forefathers had done when the Romans  invaded Britain. Thus nearly all England came into the possession  of the three invading tribes.    II    Arthur and his knights were devoted Christians. For the Romans  had not only made good roads and built strong walls and forts in  Britain, but they had also brought the Christian religion into the  island. And at about the time of the Saxon invasion St. Patrick  was founding churches and monasteries in Ireland, and was baptizing  whole clans of the Irish at a time. It is said that he baptized  12,000 persons with his own hand. Missionaries were sent out by  the Irish Church to convert the wild Picts of Scotland and at a  later day the distant barbarians of Germany and Switzerland.    The Saxons, Angles, and Jutes believed in the old Norse gods, and  Tiew and Woden, Thor and Friga, or Frija, were worshiped on the  soil of Britain for more than a hundred years.    The Britons tried to convert their conquerors, but the invaders did  not care to be taught religion by those whom they had conquered;  so the British missionaries found the work unusually hard. Aid came  to them in a singular way. At some time near the year 575 A.D.,  the Saxons quarreled and fought with their friends, the Angles.  They took some Angles prisoners and carried them to Rome to be  sold in the great slave-market there. A monk named Gregory passed  one day through the market and saw these captives. He asked the  dealer who they were. \"Angles,\" was the answer.    \"Oh,\" said the monk, \"they would be _angels_ instead of _Angles_  if they were only Christians; for they certainly have the faces  of angels.\"    [Illustration: ST. PATRICK BAPTIZING IRISH PRINCESSES]    Years after, when that monk was the Pope of Rome, he remembered this  conversation and sent the monk Au-gus'tine to England to teach the  Christian religion to the savage but angel-faced Angles. Augustine  and the British missionaries converted the Anglo-Saxons two hundred  years before the German Saxons were converted.    Still, though both Angles and Saxons called themselves Christians,  they were seldom at peace; and for more than two hundred years  they frequently fought. Various chiefs tried to make themselves  kings; and at length there came to be no less than seven small  kingdoms in South Britain.    In 784 Egbert claimed to be heir of the kingdom called Wessex;  but the people elected another man and Egbert had to flee for his  life. He went to the court of Charlemagne, and was with the great  king of the Franks in Rome on Christmas Day, 800, when the Pope  placed the crown on Charles' head and proclaimed him emperor.    Soon after this a welcome message came to Egbert. The mind of the  people in Wessex had changed and they had elected him king. So  bidding farewell to Charlemagne, he hurried to England.    Egbert had seen how Charlemagne had compelled the different quarreling  tribes of Germany to yield allegiance to him and how after uniting  his empire he had ruled it well.    Egbert did in England what Charlemagne had done in Germany. He  either persuaded the various petty kingdoms of the Angles, the  Saxons and the Jutes to recognize him as their ruler, or forced  them to do so; and thus under him all England became one united  kingdom.    But Egbert did even better than this. He did much to harmonize  the different tribes by his wise conciliation. The name \"England\"  is a memorial of this; for though Egbert himself was a Saxon, he  advised that to please the Angles the country should be called  An'gli-a, that is, Angleland or England, the land of the Angles,  instead of Sax-on-i'a, or Saxonland.          ROLLO THE VIKING    DIED 931 A.D.    I    For more than two hundred years during the Middle Ages the Christian  countries of Europe were attacked on the southwest by the Saracens  of Spain, and on the northwest by the Norsemen, or Northmen. The  Northmen were so called because they came into Middle Europe from  the north. Sometimes they were called Vi'kings, or pirates, because  they were adventurous sea-robbers who plundered all countries which  they could reach by sea.    Their ships were long and swift. In the center was placed a single  mast, which carried one large sail. For the most part, however,  the Norsemen depended on rowing, not on the wind, and sometimes  there were twenty rowers in one vessel.    The Vikings were a terror to all their neighbors; but the two regions  that suffered most from their attacks were the Island of Britain  and that part of Charlemagne's empire in which the Franks were  settled.    [Illustration: MARAUDING EXPEDITION OF NORTHMEN]    Nearly fifty times in two hundred years the lands of the Franks  were invaded. The Vikings sailed up the large rivers into the heart  of the region which we now call France and captured and pillaged  cities and towns. Some years after Charlemagne's death they went  as far as his capital, Aix (_aks_), took the place, and stabled  their horses in the cathedral which the great emperor had built.    In the year 860 they discovered Iceland and made a settlement upon  its shores. A few years later they sailed as far as Greenland, and  there established settlements which existed for about a century.    These Vikings were the first discoverers of the continent on which we  live. Ancient books found in Iceland tell the story of the discovery.  It is related that a Viking ship was driven during a storm to a  strange coast, which is thought to have been that part of America  now known as Labrador.    When the captain of the ship returned home he told what he had  seen. His tale so excited the curiosity of a young Viking prince,  called Leif the Lucky, that he sailed to the newly discovered coast.    Going ashore, he found that the country abounded in wild grapes;  and so he called it Vinland, or the land of Vines. Vinland is thought  to have been a part of what is now the Rhode Island coast.    The Vikings were not aware that they had found a great unknown  continent. No one in the more civilized parts of Europe knew anything  about their discovery; and after a while the story of the Vinland  voyages seems to have been forgotten, even among the Vikings themselves.    So it is not to them that we owe the discovery of America, but  to Columbus; because his discovery, though nearly five hundred  years later than that of the Norsemen, actually made known to all  Europe, for all time, the existence of the New World.    II    The Vikings had many able chieftains. One of the most famous was  Rollo the Walker, so called because he was such a giant that no  horse strong enough to carry him could be found, and therefore  he always had to walk. However, he did on foot what few could do  on horseback.    In 885 seven hundred ships, commanded by Rollo and other Viking  chiefs, left the harbors of Norway, sailed to the mouth of the Seine  (_san_), and started up the river to capture the city of Paris.    Rollo and his men stopped on the way at Rouen (_roe-on'_), which  also was on the Seine, but nearer its mouth. The citizens had heard  of the giant, and when they saw the river covered by his fleet they  were dismayed. However, the bishop of Rouen told them that Rollo  could be as noble and generous as he was fierce; and he advised them  to open their gates and trust to the mercy of the Viking chief.  This was done, and Rollo marched into Rouen and took possession  of it. The bishop had given good advice, for Rollo treated the  people very kindly.    Soon after capturing Rouen he left the place, sailed up the river  to Paris, and joined the other Viking chiefs. And now for six long  miles the beautiful Seine was covered with Viking vessels, which  carried an army of thirty thousand men.    A noted warrior named Eudes (_ude_) was Count of Paris, and he  had advised the Parisians to fortify the city. So not long before  the arrival of Rollo and his companions, two walls with strong  gates had been built round Paris.    It was no easy task for even Vikings to capture a strongly walled  city. We are told that Rollo and his men built a high tower and  rolled it on wheels up to the walls. At its top was a floor well  manned with soldiers. But the people within the city shot hundreds  of arrows at the besiegers, and threw down rocks, or poured boiling  oil and pitch upon them.    The Vikings thought to starve the Parisians, and for thirteen months  they encamped round the city. At length food became very scarce,  and Count Eudes determined to go for help. He went out through one  of the gates on a dark, stormy night, and rode post-haste to the  king. He told him that something must be done to save the people  of Paris.    [Illustration: A VIKING SHIP]    So the king gathered an army and marched to the city. No battle  was fought--the Vikings seemed to have been afraid to risk one.  They gave up the siege, and Paris was relieved.    Rollo and his men went to the Duchy of Burgundy, where, as now,  the finest crops were raised and the best of wines were made.    III    Perhaps after a time Rollo and his Vikings went home; but we do  not know what he did for about twenty-five years. We do know that  he abandoned his old home in Norway in 911. Then he and his people  sailed from the icy shore of Norway and again went up the Seine  in hundreds of Viking vessels.    Of course, on arriving in the land of the Franks, Rollo at once  began to plunder towns and farms.   "]]]
