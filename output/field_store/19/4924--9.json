It is doubtful if  Doctor Raymond knew how much his daughter loved him, or if he returned  her affection in like degree. He was much absorbed in his work, and had  been without her for so many years that it was hardly to be expected  that among so many interests she would be first. He did, however,  delight in the girl's quick comprehension and her devotion to study.  Then, too, Beatrice saw that he turned to her more and more for help in  his work, and that he seemed to enjoy talking to her of his plans, and  she was content, believing truly that all this would lead to a deep and  abiding affection.    As they entered the laboratory several butterflies rose from some twigs,  circled about the room and settled upon the portion of glass where the  sun shone brightest.    \"What children of the sun they are!\" exclaimed the scientist, his face  lighting up with enthusiasm.    \"Oh, father,\" cried Bee. \"Here is a drop of blood. Could one of the  pretty things have hurt itself?\"    \"No, child; some lepidopterous insects always leave a drop of red fluid  when emerging from the pupa state. This is especially true of the  Vanessa urtica. Have you ever read of red rain, or the showers of blood  of antiquity?\"    \"Yes;\" answered Beatrice, eager to show her knowledge. \"Professor  Lawrence told us about it. He read some lines from Ovid, too. Let me  see. I know:        \"'With threatening signs the lowering skies were filled      And sanguine drops from murky clouds distilled.'    \"He said that Ovid referred to the shower of blood.\"    \"Here you have the explanation of that phenomenon, Beatrice. It used to  be regarded as a prodigy that portended all sorts of evil, and whenever  it occurred people were alarmed, and referred all disasters to its  coming. It remained for the French philosopher, Peiresc, to give the  first satisfactory explanation of the phenomenon.    \"In July, 1608, an extensive shower of blood took place at Aix in  France, which threw the people of that city into the utmost  consternation. Great drops of blood were plainly to be seen in the city  itself, upon the walls of the church yard, upon the city walls, and also  upon the walls of villages and hamlets for several miles around.  Naturalists said that this kind of rain was due to vapor drawn up out of  red earth which congealing, fell afterward in this form. This  explanation did not suit Peiresc, because he knew that such as are drawn  aloft by heat ascend without color; as for example--red roses, the  vapors of which are congealed into transparent water.    \"In the meanwhile an accident happened that showed him the true cause of  the occurrence. Six months before he had shut up in a box a certain  worm, called palmer, which was nothing but a hairy caterpillar given the  name of palmer because it wandered everywhere. This one was unusually  large and of rare form. He had forgotten it, but one day, hearing a  buzzing in the box, he opened it, and found the worm turned into a  beautiful butterfly which presently flew away, leaving in the bottom of  the box a large, red drop. At the same time of the month that this  occurred an incredible number of butterflies were observed flying in the  air. He was therefore of the opinion that such kind of butterflies  resting upon the walls had there shed such drops of the same size and  bigness. Upon investigation he found that these drops were not found  upon housetops, nor upon round sides of stones which stuck out as would  have been the case if blood had fallen from the sky, but rather where  the stones were somewhat hollowed, and in holes where such small  creatures might shroud and nestle themselves. Moreover, the walls which  were spotted were not in the middle of towns, but such as bordered upon  the fields. Nor were they upon the highest places, but only upon those  of such moderate height as butterflies are wont to fly.    \"After this whenever an event of this nature occurred scientists would  find that it always happened when the Vanessa urtica, or the Vanessa  polychloros species of butterfly were uncommonly plentiful in that  particular district where the phenomenon was observed.\"    \"Why, how strange that is, father.\"    \"Yes, it is rather remarkable; but many of the so-called prodigies of  ancient times are explainable through natural causes. In France, during  the thirteenth century, one of these rains occurred, and the people,  believing that evil could be averted in no other way, slew ten thousand  hapless Jews.\"    \"And all because of a little butterfly,\" observed Bee musingly.    \"Yes; all because of a little insect that Moore calls 'winged flowers,'  or 'flying gems.'\"    \"How pretty!\" cried Bee. \"And they are like flowers, aren't they?\"    \"Well, they are certainly like them in that each kind has its own season  for appearing in perfect bloom; and thus they decorate the landscape.  Now let us go for our walk. When I return I must chloroform these  specimens. They are rather fine.\"    \"Do let the lovely things go until tomorrow,\" pleaded the girl. \"Surely,  they should have a little while of life.\"    \"There speaks the woman, Beatrice. That is the reason that there are so  few naturalists among the sex. Yet I would not have it otherwise. Yes;  they may have life until tomorrow since you wish it. Theirs is but a  brief span at best. Come, get your hat, my daughter! You have been in  the house too long today.\"          Chapter X    A Butterfly and a Boy        \"Out in the open country fields,        With the green grass blowing merrily,      The daisies nod and the dewdrop shine,        And the sunbeams dance right cheerily.        \"A lassie and laddie come tripping along,        Like the fair day smiling brightly;      They pluck the flowers and they hum a song        As they shake off the dewdrops lightly.\"        --_Mary Aimee Goodman._      \"Beatrice, do you see that butterfly on the verbena bed?\" asked Doctor  Raymond one bright morning in July, as he and his daughter sat at work  in the study.    Beatrice glanced through the open window to the bed of verbenas, over  which hovered a large butterfly.    \"It is beautiful!\" she exclaimed looking with delight at the insect's  broad expanse of wing. \"Wouldn't you call that an orange-red, father?  And see the white spots on the secondaries. What kind is it?\"    \"The Anosia Plexippus,\" answered her father. \"You know it better perhaps  as The Monarch, or Milkweed Butterfly. It is a magnificent specimen. I  must have it for my collection. Where is my net, child?\"    \"Let me capture it for you, father,\" cried Beatrice, catching up her net  hastily. \"I'll have it in a jiffy.\"    \"Be careful not to bruise it, Beatrice,\" cautioned the scientist as she  vaulted lightly through the window.    The insect still hovered over the verbena blossoms, but as the girl drew  near it rose and sailed away. Doctor Raymond gave an amused laugh at her  discomfiture.    \"Never you mind,\" cried Bee. \"I'll get it yet. See if I don't;\" and away  she sped in hot pursuit.    \"It has extraordinary powers of flight; so, if it lands you anywhere  near the postoffice, just see if there is any mail,\" called her father  teasingly.    Across the garden, through the grove, over the hedge and out into the  road the butterfly flew with Beatrice following after.    \"I just believe that it heard father,\" ejaculated she, as the coveted  insect winged its way in the direction of town. \"I don't care, I'll  follow it, anyway.\"    The naturalist and his daughter in pursuit of insects had become a  common sight to the people of Louisiana, and so the bareheaded, flushed  maiden in breathless pursuit of a beautiful butterfly caused only a few  persons to look after her curiously. Onward went the butterfly. Just as  the town was reached it began to rise in its flight, and Beatrice  realized that it was her last chance, for it would soon be lost over the  housetops. She made an upward leap, and by a fortunate sweep of the net  succeeded in capturing the prize.    \"Bravo!\" exclaimed a voice, and she looked around in some confusion to  discover a boy gazing at her with admiring eyes. \"I think that's pretty  good for a girl.\"    [Illustration: \"I THINK THAT'S PRETTY GOOD FOR A GIRL.\"]    \"Oh! indeed!\" cried Bee heatedly. \"Could you have done any better  yourself, even though you are a boy?\"    \"I don't know,\" replied the lad coolly. \"I never wanted a butterfly bad  enough to try it.\"    \"I don't believe that you ever even chased one in your life,\" said the  girl, staring at him scornfully. \"You look a namby-pamby sort.\"    The boy's face flushed. He was all of thirteen years old, but despite  the fact was garbed in black velvet knickerbockers, a ruffled white  blouse, long black stockings with low, ribbon-tied shoes, and had a  silken sash knotted about his waist. Worst of all, to the girl's mind,  he wore his hair in curls which fell far down upon his shoulders.    \"If you were a boy I'd fight you for that,\" cried the urchin angrily,  clenching his fists.    \"Pooh!\" sniffed Bee, turning up her nose. \"I would not be afraid of such  a baby if I were six times a boy. Where's your mother?\"    \"She's home, asleep. What's yours thinking about that she lets you go  wild like this? My mother said, when she saw you running through the  fields one day, that she wondered what kind of a woman she could be to  let you go like that. Where is she?\"    \"She is dead,\" answered the girl in a low voice. \"I think your mother is  horrid.\"    \"She isn't. She's lovely. Everybody says so. I am sorry that yours is  dead. You can't help being rude, of course, if you have no mother. Who  looks after you?\"    \"Why, father, of course,\" answered Bee. \"And I am not rude.\"    \"What makes you run after butterflies and things, then?\" demanded he  sternly. \"I saw you one day, and you had a worm--a great, ugly worm--in  your hand.\"    Beatrice gave way to a burst of laughter.    \"A worm?\" cried she"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33434"],[0,"The Squirrels and other animals (#12)"],[1,"tell you what I have heard about  _you_. I have heard that you _are rather fond of nuts_, and that, not  content with eating as many as you can possibly cram, you are such a  glutton that you carry a great many home with you, on purpose to stuff  yourself with in the winter.    BRUSH.    Well, and what harm? Nuts are very wholesome food, I am sure. And don't  _you_ lay up any store of provisions for the winter, then?    TOUCHMENOT.    Not I, indeed! I am better employed in the winter than in eating. I  sleep _all_ the winter, Mr. Nutcracker! When the weather gets a little  colder, perhaps in a few days, I shall creep into my snug nest which I  have made under the roots of a great tree. There I shall roll myself  up, in my bed of dry leaves, and when once fairly asleep, I am safe  till next spring. Nothing can make _me_ wake up. What a fool I should  be to trouble myself about collecting a quantity of food for the  winter, when I am sound asleep all the time!    BRUSH.    And what do you live upon, when you _are_ awake, if it isn't an unfair  question?    TOUCHMENOT.    Oh, I am not very particular. Almost anything will do at a pinch. I  often make a meal upon roots and vegetables, when I can find nothing  else. But I like animal food much better, such as insects, worms,  snails, bird's eggs, frogs, mice, and now and then I dine upon a snake  when I can contrive to catch him. Well! what's the matter now? What do  you jump up into the tree for?    BRUSH.    Oh, shocking! I never heard anything so dreadful in my life! I beg your  pardon. I mean, I should not like to dine upon snake at all.    TOUCHMENOT.    Very likely not. Tastes differ, you know. But here comes a gentleman  who will most certainly _dine upon you_, if you don't get up a little  higher into the tree; for though he can't climb, he is a pretty good  leaper. For my part, I scorn to run away from any animal, large or  small. Stay where you are, and you will see some fun.                     *       *       *       *       *    The animal that now approached was a hungry young fox, who would  certainly have made a meal of the squirrel if he could have caught him.  But after trying to reach him, by jumping till he was tired, he gave it  up at last for a bad job; and then, spying the hedgehog, he dashed at  him, as if he had intended to have swallowed him at a single mouthful.  But Touchmenot was quite prepared for the attack, for he had rolled  himself up into a round ball, with nothing but sharp spines sticking  out on every side; and when the fox attempted to seize his prey, you  would have laughed to have seen how very much surprised and  disappointed he looked. As he was but young, though he appeared more  than half-grown, I suppose he had never seen a hedgehog before, or he  would not have acted so imprudently, for he pounced upon this ball of  spines as he would upon a rabbit, or a pheasant, but he soon found out  his mistake, and retreated to a little distance, howling dismally, and  licking his bleeding lips and nose.    When he recovered a little from his surprise, he made another attempt.  But now he proceeded more cautiously, and rolled old Touchmenot over  and over with his paws, hoping to find some part of him that was not  protected by this spiny coat of armour. He could make nothing of it!  This strange-looking ball was spines above, spines below--strong, sharp  spines on every side. It was really very provoking, for it contained a  nice meal inside, no doubt, if he could but get at it.    After watching his vain attempts for some time, the squirrels saw that  the fox had no chance of succeeding, and they made the best of their  way home, keeping on the trees for fear he should leave Touchmenot, and  follow them instead. However, they had nothing to fear from this silly  young fellow, for he seemed fully occupied in rolling this tiresome  ball about, but how long he continued his amusement, I cannot tell.  However, I must inform you, that the hedgehog boasted rather too much,  when he said he could set _all_ his enemies at defiance, by his strange  plan of defence; for though very few animals will venture to attack him  when rolled up, it sometimes happens that a thoroughly game and  courageous terrier-dog will seize him, and kill him too, in spite of  his prickly armour. Of course, his own lips and mouth must suffer  severely from the animal's sharp spines.    A week or two after the interview with the hedgehog, one very cold  dismal afternoon, all the squirrels were in the nest, except the father  of the family, and he was gone abroad for a short time, just to stretch  his legs a little. Suddenly he darted into the hole, as if he had been  pursued by another wild-cat, and when he was asked what was the matter,  he exclaimed, \"_Snow!_ cold, dismal _snow_! Flakes of snow as large as  white butterflies, and falling so thickly that I could hardly see my  way back to the nest! Here I am, however, and here I mean to stay till  fine weather comes again. It will be a long while before that happens  though, I fancy.\"    Brush was a true prophet. The weather became colder and colder every  day, till at last, after a sharp frosty night, the squirrels quite  forgot to wake up in the morning, and then their first long nap of  several weeks began. If you could have looked in upon them in their  comfortable nest, you could hardly have believed that the little curled  up squirrels, with their blankets over their heads, were the same  active, playful creatures, whose summer gambols among the branches had  afforded you so much amusement.    Well, then, there _can_ be nothing more to say about these sleeping  squirrels, and now I must inform you what effect the cold weather had  upon the other animals, whose summer habits have been imperfectly  described in this history. The dormice, in their nests at the bottom of  the oak-tree, and the water-rats, in their holes in the bank of the  pond, were sound asleep also; but all these animals had taken the  precaution to provide a store of provisions for the early part of the  spring, and in case they should wake up for a few days in the winter.  Now, with respect to the curious little water-shrew-mouse, Velvet-coat,  I am not quite so certain about his winter habits. But no doubt he  slept comfortably in his hole till the spring; and as he was an  insect-feeder, we may conclude that he followed the example of  Touchmenot, in not laying up any food for the winter.    If we could have questioned old Leatherwing, I think he would have told  us that the harvest-mice, whose history he overheard related by  Minimus, abandoned their nest on the thistle, and made themselves a  warmer house, deep under the ground, where they passed the cold weather  in sleeping, and now and then nibbling the grains of wheat which they  had buried with them. The bat has already related how he passed the  winter himself, and how he was obliged to waste some part of it in  sleep, not altogether from the effects of cold, but also from the want  of food.          CHAPTER IX.      Though the history of the squirrels and their companions was finished  in the last chapter, I still feel unwilling to part from my young  friends, who have kindly taken some interest in the events I related  for their amusement. It is true, that in the following tale no mention  will be made of any of those \"smaller British quadrupeds\" of whose  \"habits and instincts\" the title-page has engaged to communicate some  information. But it is always better to do _more_ than _less_ than  we have promised. Therefore, perhaps you will not be displeased if this  little book should contain something that you did not expect to find  there, and I hope you will think this additional chapter not less  entertaining than those you have already read.    You may remember, that Leatherwing related to the squirrel the History  of Minimus, or \"Some Passages in the Life of the smallest Quadruped in  the World.\" In the following pages, you will find a companion to the  bat's story, and the title shall be,        SOME PASSAGES IN THE LIFE OF THE LARGEST QUADRUPED IN THE      WORLD!    As inquisitive readers may perhaps wish to be informed by what means  the following little history came into my possession, I will endeavour  to satisfy them as to its authenticity, by telling them that it was  related to me by an old man, a native of Sumatra, in which island, \"the  largest quadrupeds in the world\" are, or were, abundant in a wild  state. This old fellow was cook on board the ship, \"All's Well,\" in  which (fifty-three years ago,) I first went to sea as an apprentice,  and he was called \"Jolly,\" but what his real name was no one on board  knew nor cared. He was a merry-hearted old man, and had made himself  a great favourite, especially with us boys, by his extraordinary  abilities in \"_spinning a good yarn_,\" as the sea-phrase goes, meaning  neither more nor less than telling a good story. The following strange  history was a favourite \"yarn\" of old Jolly's; and though it is now  more than half a century since I first heard it, it is still fresh in  my memory, having so often related it to my little brothers, who, on my  return home, were always very eager in their inquiries about \"the  doings of the dreadful wild-beasts of foreign countries.\"    But I must mention, that our old friend Jolly boasted of other  accomplishments more extraordinary than story-telling, such as the art  of foretelling future events, of understanding the language of birds  and beasts, and he sometimes hinted, that he had the dangerous power of  killing an enemy who might be five hundred leagues distant, by the  performance of certain magical ceremonies. Perhaps you are not disposed  to believe that Jolly was such a clever old fellow. Well, I cannot help  it. I have no time now to endeavour to convince you, but here is his  story, though not in his own words, for if I had not corrected his bad  English, the"]]]
