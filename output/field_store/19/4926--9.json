This tree frog is widespread in the coastal lowlands and in the  Tepalcatepec Valley up to elevations of about 1200 meters. It is found  in numbers in the early part of the rainy season, at which time males  were heard calling from bushes and trees along ditches and temporary  ponds. The call is a loud nasal \"waank-waank-waank.\" One individual that  was emitting a long and unusually high-pitched call was found to have  one hind limb engulfed by a _Leptodeira maculata_.    When active at night these frogs usually are pale tan to reddish brown  above with dark brown markings. A specimen found sitting on a maguey  plant in the daytime was pale ashy gray with a pale green upper lip.      ~Hyla bistincta~ Cope         _Hyla bistincta_ Cope, Proc. Amer. Philos. Soc., 17:87,       1877.--Veracruz, Mexico. Type locality restricted to       Acultzingo, Veracruz, Mexico, by Smith and Taylor       (1950a:346).         Cerro San Andres; Dos Aguas (2); Los Conejos (3); Uruapan       (50).    In the Parque Nacional at Uruapan this species was found in abundance  during the day. The frogs hide in an entanglement of vines and  vegetation overhanging several small spring-fed streams. Tadpoles were  in the rocky streams, and metamorphosing young were on vegetation at the  edges of the streams.    In life the dorsum is greenish tan with brown mottling; in some  individuals the entire dorsum is dark chocolate brown. The flanks are  pale lemon yellow barred with lavender-brown. Notes on the color of a  living frog from Dos Aguas (UMMZ 119193) are: Dorsal ground color a  medium shade of brown with dark brown flecks; flanks black with silvery  white and pale yellow spots; belly pale yellowish white; throat mottled  with grayish brown; iris pale copper color.    [Illustration: FIG. 8. Tadpole of _Hyla bistincta_ (UMMZ 115231) from  Uruapan, Michoacan. x 2.]    Description of Tadpole: Body somewhat depressed; maximum width of body  slightly more than one-half of body length. Nostrils placed  dorsolaterally and directed anteriorly, situated about midway between  tip of snout and eye. Eyes of moderate size, dorsolateral in position  and directed upwards. Tail about twice as long as body, thrice as long  as deep, and tapering gradually to a rounded tip. Tail-musculature not  extending to tip of tail fin. Spiracle sinistral, lateral, and situated  at midbody. Vent dextral; the cloacal tube extending along ventral part  of tail for a distance equal to about one-eighth of body length (Fig.  8). Average body length of six tadpoles with small hind limb buds, 19.5  mm.; tail length, 38.3 mm. Mouth ventral, its width equal to about  two-thirds of greatest width of body. Lips bordered by two rows of small  papillae; row of larger papillae between upper lip and outer upper  tooth-row, similar row between lower lip and outer lower tooth-row;  laterally these rows degenerating into numerous small papillae. Horny  beaks well developed; upper beak moderately arched and deeply indented;  lower beak slightly indented. Serrations of beaks blunt and peglike,  moderately developed on both beaks, but slightly stronger on lower one.  Tooth-rows 2/3; upper rows nearly equal in length and slightly longer  than lower rows, which are subequal in length; inner upper tooth row  interrupted medially by rounded notch; inner lower tooth-row turned  downward laterally; teeth in all rows about equal in size, but  decreasing in length laterally (Fig. 9).    [Illustration: FIG. 9. Mouthparts of larval _Hyla bistincta_ (UMMZ  115231) from Uruapan, Michoacan. x 15.]    Color in formalin: pale grayish brown dorsally and laterally; pale gray  ventrally; tail-musculature brown; tail-fin translucent with scattered  melanophores most numerous on upper fin.    In most details these tadpoles resemble those of _Hyla robertsorum_  described by Rabb and Mosimann (1955).    Four metamorphosing young have snout-vent lengths of 23.0-23.5 (23.2);  a completely metamorphosed individual has a snout-vent length of 24.8  mm.    In Michoacan this stream-breeding hylid occurs at elevations of 1,600 to  2,400 meters in the Sierra de Coalcoman and in the mountains rising from  the Mexican Plateau.      ~Hyla eximia~ Baird         _Hyla eximia_ Baird, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Philadelphia,       7:61, October 20, 1854.--Valley of Mexico. Type locality       restricted to Coyoacan, Distrito Federal, Mexico, by Smith       and Taylor (1950a:329).         _Hyla microeximia_ Maslin, Herpetologica, 13:81, July 10,       1957.--3 miles northwest of Jocotepec, Jalisco, Mexico.

More than 80 per cent of the specimens from Michoacan have brown spots  between the lateral and dorsolateral dark stripes, and more than 50 per  cent have spots between the dorsolateral stripes, at least posteriorly.  In comparison with specimens from the Valley of Mexico, those from  Michoacan have more distinct dorsolateral stripes that extend farther  anteriorly, sometimes to the eyelid, and in this respect are more nearly  like those from Jalisco and Nayarit (Taylor, 1939b:425). Some specimens  from the western part of Michoacan possess certain characters used by  Maslin (1957:81) to distinguish _Hyla microeximia_ from _H. eximia_;  nevertheless, the variation is such that two species cannot be  distinguished in Michoacan. Four series of freshly preserved specimens  have been studied in detail; in the discussion below they are arranged  from west to east; the measurement is for snout-vent length of ten males  from each sample:         _Zamora._--Twenty-two specimens (UMMZ 102083), 24.0-27.6       (26.1) mm. Dorsolateral dark stripe, or row of dashes,       present in all specimens; dark spots in lateral and dorsal       green fields; lateral dark stripe confluent with       dorsolateral stripe posteriorly in 18 specimens; white line       not extending to groin.         _Temazcal._--Thirty-five specimens (UMMZ 119162), 26.5-31.1       (28.2) mm. Dorsolateral dark stripe of row of spots present       only posteriorly in most; both dorsolateral stripes and       dorsal spots lacking in four specimens; heavy spotting       dorsally in three others; lateral and dorsolateral dark       stripes confluent posteriorly in three; lateral white stripe       extending to groin in 16 specimens.         _Ciudad Hidalgo._--Thirty-six specimens (UMMZ 119163),       26.4-30.9 (28.2) mm. Dorsolateral dark stripe or row of       spots present only posteriorly in most; no brown spots in       the green fields of many specimens; large brown inguinal       spot in most specimens; heavy spotting dorsally in four;       lateral and dorsolateral dark stripes confluent posteriorly       in five; lateral white line extending to groin in most       specimens.         _Tuxpan._--Fifteen specimens (UMMZ 115227), 28.7-33.0 (30.5)       mm. Dorsolateral dark stripe or row of dashes in all       specimens; dark spots in lateral green fields, at least       posteriorly in most; dark spots posteriorly in the dorsal       green field in five; lateral dark stripe separated from       dorsolateral stripe in all specimens; lateral white line       extends to the groin in all specimens.    As can be seen from the above descriptions, the distinguishing  characters of _Hyla microeximia_--confluence of lateral and dorsolateral  dark stripes posteriorly, extent of lateral white stripe, and  distribution of dark spots dorsally--are found in individuals from all  of the populations sampled. In the samples from western Michoacan there  is a higher incidence of _microeximia_-like frogs than in those from  other parts of the state. _Hyla eximia_ is a wide-ranging species  varying greatly geographically and individually. A thorough review of  the species and related members of the _Hyla eximia_-group is necessary  before certain populations can justifiably be segregated as subspecies  or species.    In Michoacan _Hyla eximia_ has been collected in mesquite-grassland,  pine-oak forest, and cultivated areas on the Mexican Plateau from 1500  to 2300 meters; apparently it is absent from the Sierra de Coalcoman.  This is the most abundant frog on the southern part of the Mexican  Plateau; in the rainy season breeding choruses are found in temporary  pools and in the marshes adjacent to the permanent lakes.      ~Hyla lafrentzi~ Mertens and Wolterstorff         _Hyla lafrentzi_ Mertens and Wolterstorff, Zool. Anz.,       84:235, August 25, 1929.--Desierto de los Leones, Distrito       Federal, Mexico.         Cerro San Andres (26); Opopeo (9).    In March, 1949, James A. Peters collected this species at elevations of  2400 to 2800 meters on the west slope of Cerro San Andres. The frogs  were found beneath logs and rocks in a damp canyon in coniferous forest.  Among the juveniles in this series is a completely transformed  individual (UMMZ 102093) having a snout-vent length of 14.5 mm. Five  adults have snout-vent lengths of 36.2-39.5 (38.0) mm. _Hyla lafrentzi_  has noticeably longer hind limbs than _H. eximia_; in the former, when  the hind limb is brought forward along the body, the tibiotarsal  articulation extends to the snout. There are dark transverse bands on  the hind limbs; the dorsolateral stripe is broken into an anterior and a  posterior segment, and the latter is narrowly bordered by white in most  specimens.    _Hyla lafrentzi_ occurs at higher elevations than any other frog"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33619"],[0,"Maori and Settler: A Story of The New Zealand War (#12)"],[1,"three  officials mounted the gangway. The captain went forward to meet them.  \"Is there anything I can do for you, gentlemen?\"    \"There has been a crime committed on shore,\" the leader of the party  said, \"and it is suspected that some of those concerned in the matter  are on board one of the ships in the harbour. I have authority to make a  strict search on board each.\"    \"You are perfectly welcome to do so, sir,\" the captain said. \"One of  our officers will show you over the ship.\"    \"I must trouble you to show me your list of passengers and crew, and to  muster the men on deck. But first I must ask you, Did any of your boats  return on board late?\"    \"No,\" the captain replied. \"Our last boat was hauled up to the davits at  half-past nine. There was a heavy day's work before the men to-day, and  I therefore refused leave on shore.\"    The men were ordered to be mustered, and while they were collecting the  second-mate went round the ship with the officials, and they saw that no  one was below in his berth. The men's names were called over from the  list, and the officials satisfied that all were present and in good  health.    \"Now for the passengers,\" he said    \"I cannot ask them to muster,\" the captain observed, \"but I will walk  round with you and point out those on the list. There are some eight or  ten on shore. They will doubtless be off to lunch; and if you leave an  officer on board he will see that they are by no means the sort of  people to take part in such an affair as that which has happened on  shore.\"    The officials went round the deck, but saw nothing whatever to excite  their suspicion. Marion Renshaw was laughing and talking with Mr.  Atherton, Miss Mitford walking up and down the poop in conversation with  James Allen. After they had finished their investigations, the officials  left one of their party to inspect the remaining passengers as they came  on board, and to check them off the list. They then again took their  seats in the galley and were rowed to the next ship.    By dint of great exertions the cargo was got out by sunset, the sails  were at once loosened and the anchor weighed, and before the short  twilight had faded away the _Flying Scud_ was making her way with a  gentle breeze towards the mouth of the harbour.    \"We are well out of that,\" Mr. Atherton said as he looked back at the  lights of the city.    \"I think you are very well out of it indeed, in more senses than one,\"  said the surgeon, who was standing next to him; \"but you have had a  wonderfully close shave of it, Mr. Atherton. Another inch and either of  those blows might have been fatal. Besides, had you been detained for a  month or six weeks, it is as likely as not that, what with the heat and  what with the annoyance, your wound would have taken a bad turn. Now,  you must let me exercise my authority and order you to your berth  immediately. You ought not to have been out of it. Of the two evils,  getting up and detention, I chose the least; but I should be glad now if  you would go off at once. If you do not, I can assure you I may have you  on my hands all the rest of the voyage.\"    \"I will obey orders, doctor. The more willingly because for the last  hour or two my back has been smarting unmercifully. I do not feel the  other wound much.\"    \"That is because you have been sitting still. You will find it hurt you  when you come to walk. Please go down carefully; a sudden movement might  start your wounds again.\"    It was two or three days before Mr. Atherton again appeared on deck. His  left arm was bandaged tightly to his body so as to prevent any movement  of the shoulder-blade, and he walked stiffly to the deck-chair, which  had been piled with cushions in readiness.    \"I am glad to be out again, Mrs. Renshaw,\" Mr. Atherton said as she  arranged the cushions to suit him. \"Your husband, with Wilfrid and the  two Allens, have kept me company, one or other of them, all the time, so  I cannot say I have been dull. But it was much hotter below than it is  here. However, I know the doctor was right in keeping me below, for the  slightest movement gave me a great deal of pain. However, the wounds are  going on nicely, and I hope by the time we get to Buenos Ayres I shall  be fit for a trip on shore again.\"    \"I hardly think so, Mr. Atherton; for if the weather continues as it is  now--it is a nice steady breeze, and we have been running ever since we  left Rio--I think we shall be there long before you are fit to go  ashore.\"    \"I do not particularly care about it,\" Mr. Atherton said. \"Buenos Ayres  is not like Rio, but is for the most part quite a modern town, and even  in situation has little to recommend it. Besides, we shall be so far off  that there will be no running backwards and forwards between the ship  and the shore as there was at Rio. Of course it depends a good deal on  the amount of the water coming down the river, but vessels sometimes  have to anchor twelve miles above the town.\"    \"I am sure I have no desire to go ashore,\" Mrs. Renshaw said, \"and after  the narrow escape Wilfrid had at Rio I should be glad if he did not set  foot there again until we arrive at the end of the voyage.\"    \"He is not likely to get into a scrape again,\" Mr. Atherton said. \"Of  course it would have been wiser not to have stopped so late as they did  in a town of whose ways they knew nothing; but you may be sure he will  be careful another time. Besides, I fancy from what I have heard things  are better managed there, and the population are more peaceable and  orderly than at Rio. But, indeed, such an adventure as that which befell  them might very well have happened to any stranger wandering late at  night in the slums of any of our English seaports.\"    There was a general feeling of disappointment among the passengers when  the _Flying Scud_ dropped anchor in the turbid waters of the La Plata.  The shore was some five or six miles away, and was low and  uninteresting. The towers and spires of the churches of Buenos Ayres  were plainly visible, but of the town itself little could be seen. As  soon as the anchor was dropped the captain's gig was lowered, and he  started for shore to make arrangements for landing the cargo. The next  morning a steam tug brought out several flats, and the work of unloading  commenced. A few passengers went ashore in the tug, but none of the  Renshaws left the ship. Two days sufficed for getting out the goods for  Buenos Ayres. The passengers who had been staying at hotels on shore  came off with the last tug to the ship. Their stay ashore had been a  pleasant one, and they liked the town, which, in point of cleanliness  and order, they considered to be in advance of Rio.          CHAPTER V.    A BOAT EXPEDITION.      \"Well I am not sorry we are off again,\" Marion Renshaw said as the men  ran round with the capstan bars and the anchor came up from the shallow  water. \"What a contrast between this and Rio!\"    \"It is, indeed,\" Mr. Atherton, who was standing beside her, replied. \"I  own I should have liked to spend six months in a snug little craft going  up the La Plata and Parana, especially the latter. The La Plata runs  through a comparatively flat and--I will not say unfertile country,  because it is fertile enough, but--a country deficient in trees, and  offering but small attraction to a botanist; but the Parana flows north.  Paraguay is a country but little visited by Europeans, and ought to be  well worth investigation; but, as you say, I am glad enough to be out of  this shallow water. In a short time we shall be looking out our wraps  again. We shall want our warmest things for doubling Cape Horn, or  rather what is called doubling Cape Horn, because in point of fact we do  not double it at all.\"    \"Do you mean we do not go round it?\" Marion asked in surprise.    \"We may, and we may not, Miss Renshaw. It will depend upon the weather,  I suppose; but most vessels now go through the Straits which separate  Cape Horn itself from Tierra del Fuego.\"    \"Those are the Straits of Magellan, are they not?\"    \"Oh, no!\" Mr. Atherton replied. \"The Straits of Magellan lie still  further to the north, and separate Tierra del Fuego from the mainland. I  wish that we were going through them, for I believe the scenery is  magnificent.\"    \"But if they lie further north that must surely be our shortest way, so  why should we not go through them?\"    \"If we were in a steamer we might do so, Miss Renshaw; but the channels  are so narrow and intricate, and the tides and currents run with such  violence, that sailing-vessels hardly ever attempt the passage. The  straits we shall go through lie between Tierra del Fuego and the group  of islands of which the Horn is the most southerly.\"    \"Is the country inhabited?\"    \"Yes, by races of the most debased savages, with whom, I can assure you,  I have no desire whatever to make any personal acquaintance.\"    \"Not even to collect botanical specimens, Mr. Atherton?\" the girl asked,  smiling.    \"Not even for that purpose, Miss Renshaw. I will do a good deal in  pursuance of my favourite hobby, but I draw the line at the savages of  Tierra del Fuego. Very few white men have ever fallen into their hands  and lived to tell the tale, and certainly I should have no chance  whatever.\"    \"Why would you have less chance than other people, Mr. Atherton?\"    \"My attractions would be irresistible,\" Mr. Atherton replied gravely. \"I  should furnish meat for a whole tribe.\"    \"How horrible!\" Marion exclaimed. \"What! are they cannibals?\"    \"Very much so indeed; and one can hardly blame them, for it is the only  chance they have of getting flesh. Their existence is one long struggle  with famine and cold. They are not hunters, and are but poor fishermen.  I firmly believe that if I were in their place I should be a cannibal  myself.\"    \"How can you say such things?\" Marion asked indignantly. \"I never know  whether you are in earnest, Mr. Atherton."]]]
