Us niggers nebber ma'ied an'  don't 'member any big weddin's of de white folks. But dey buried folks  den de same as dey does now, in a box. Dey would bury de slaves same as  dey done de white folks, but us didn't eben have no babtizin' on 'count  of dat oberseer. He didn't lak for us to git no religion. Cose all  slaves didn't have hard treatment lak us did, 'caze dere oberseer an'  Marster warn't as mean as ourn.    \"No'm we didn't know nothin' 'bout no hoodoo stuff in dem days. Dey only  had homemade medicines, dat is unless dey got sho' nuff powerful sick  an' den dey would go to see a doctor. Us used bone-set tea made from a  weed. Lawd, it was bitterer dan quinine, an' it were good for de chills  an' fever, an' it would purge you too. Den us used life-everlastin' tea  for fever, an' Jerusalem brush-reed to get rid of worms.    \"But, Miss, I knows dere is gostes, 'caze when I was a little boy my  mammy come in from de fiel' an' laid across de bed an' I was sittin' in  front of de fireplace an' a big somp'n lak a cow widout no haid come in  de do' an' I commence to beat on it wid my fists. Den my mammy say:  'What matter wid you, nigger?' Den dat critter he walk raght out de do'.  I looked outen de window an' dere it was a-goin' in Aunt Marfa's cabin.  I neber did see it no mo'.

Atter dat  she were comforted. Anudder time, my pappy, Sam Cheatam, who was a  wicked man, was a-sittin' in front of de fire an' a big brindle dog come  to de do' an' started barkin'. My pappy say: 'What in de Hell am dat?'  an' snapped his fingers at de dog. De dog he den dropped daid. Some  folks say dat dere ain't no sich things as gostes, but I know dere is,  'caze dere is good spirits an' bad spirits.    \"Dem was good ol' days, Mistis, even iffen us did have a hard time an' I  don't know iffen it warn't better'n it is now.

Fact is, I believe I 'druther be alivin' back dere dan today  'caze us at least had plenty somp'n t'eat an' nothin' to worry about.  An' as for beatin'; dey beats folks now iffen dey don't do raght, so  what's de difference?

Battered cans and rickety boxes were filled with a profusion  of flowers of the common variety. Laura offered me a split-bottomed  chair and lowered herself slowly into a rocker that creaked even under  her frail body. \"Po'ly, Miss, po'ly,\" she responded to my query about  her health. \"Tain't lack de old days. I's crippled and mos' blin' now  atter all de years what I got.    \"I was born on Mr. Pleasant Powell's place in North Ca'lina, and when I  was 'bout six or seven years ole I reckon hit 'twas, Mr. Garret from  right up yonder in de bend, 'bout eight miles from Livingston gwine  no'th on de Livingston and Epes road, bought ten of us chillun in North  Ca'lina and sont two white men, and one was Mr. Skinner, to fotch us  back in waggins. En he fotch ole Julie Powell and Henry to look atter  us. Wa'n't none of dem ten chillun no kin to me, and he never bought my  mammy, so I had to leave her behine.    \"I recollect Mammy said to old Julie, 'Take keer my baby chile (dat was  me) an iffen I never sees her no mo' raise her for God.' Den she fell  off de waggin where us was all settin' and roll over on de groun' jes'  acryin'. But us was eatin' candy what dey done give us for to keep us  quiet, and I didn't have sense 'nuff for to know what ailed Mammy, but I  knows now and I never seed her no mo' in dis life.

My pappy's name I don't know ca'se he done been sole to somewhars else  when I was too little to recollect. But my mammy was de mother of  twenty-two chillun and she had twins in her lap when us driv' off. My  gran'mammy said when I lef', 'Pray, Laura, and be er good gal, and min'  bofe white and black. Ev'body will lack you and iffen you never see me  no mo' pray to meet me in heaven.' Den she cried. Her name was Rose  Powell.    \"Us all started den for Mr. Garrett's plantation down yonder in de bend,  ten chillun and two ole uns, and two white men, and us was travellin'  solid a month. Fuss thing Ole Marsa say was 'Now be good ter dese  motherless chillun.' Den he went to war, and de overseers forgot all  'bout dey promise. When Ole Marsa come back he done got his arm shot  off, but he let bofe dem overseers go, ca'se dey done whupped dat ole  'oman what come wid us to deaf.

But  my recollection is shaller. I ain't never read no verse in no Bible in  my life, ca'se I can't read. Some my chillun kin, though. My husban'  died and lef' me wid nine chillun, none of um couldn't pull de others  outer de fire iffen dey fell in. I had mo'n dat, but some come here dead  and some didn't.

De earth shake and tremble so hard dat  some loose bricks fell out my chimney and de pitcher fell off de  winder-sill down on de flo'. I was 'bout 50 years old den, if I 'members  correct. Dat come 'long in 1886.    \"I also 'members Gen. Wade Hampton, when I was a building up de  breastworks to keep de Yankees from shooting us. Dem was scary times,  but de Ku Klux days was scary times de most.    \"My young marster, Dr. Johnny Hill, used to have me drive him to  Padgett's Creek Church.

I would git a lot o' letters, fer in dem days,  de white folks rit letters to one another mo' dan dey does now. I guess  dese days de mos' writing dat is done is business writing. At de Sardis  sto' dey used to give big barbecues. Dem days barbecues was de mos'  source of amusement fer ev'ybody, all de white folks and de darkies de  whole day long. All de fiddlers from ev'ywhars come to Sardis and fiddle  fer de dances at de barbecues. Dey had a platform built not fer from de  barbecue table to dance on. Any darky dat could cut de buck and de  pigeon wing was called up to de platform to perform fer ev'ybody.    \"Night befo' dem barbecues, I used to stay up all night a-cooking and  basting de meats wid barbecue sass (sauce). It made of vinegar, black  and red pepper, salt, butter, a little sage, coriander, basil, onion,  and garlic. Some folks drop a little sugar in it. On a long pronged  stick I wraps a soft rag or cotton fer a swab, and all de night long I  swabs dat meat 'till it drip into de fire.

A daughter lives nearby. They like to tell of the days when they were  children:    \"Land o' de libbin, my maw, she wuz one o' de Hughes and Giles niggers.  She used to lob to set down by de fire an' tell us younguns 'bout de  times what de had down dar on de big ribber (Broad River). Our  plantation, she used to say, wuz de one what de white folks called Mt.  Drury. But when maw wuz rael young, jus big enough to wait on de fine  white ladies, she wuz put on de 'block', you nos what dat wuz, and sold  to Marse 'Matt' Wallace. Marse Matt took it into his haed dat he wuz a  gwine to a place what dey calls Arkansas. His white folks, specially his  wife's, dem wuz de Mengs, dey riz up an put forth mighty powferul  objections. Fer a long time he wuz jus onsettled in he mind 'bout zactly  what he really wuz a gwine to do.    \"Peers to me like my maw 'lowed dat he sorter kept his intentions secret  when he had rightly make up he mind 'bout de whole business. In dem  days, dere wo'nt no trains like dare is now. Everbody had to ride in  waggons, and de white ladies, dey allus rid in fine carriages. De  chilluns, dey rid wid de wimmen folks. Our Marster, he rid high steppin'  horse, cept on de Sabbath, when he rid wid de missus to meetin' house  out on de creek. (Brown's Creek).    \"Anyhow, one cold mornin' not long fore Christmas and jus atter  Thanksgivin' us sot out fore day, or dat is, my maw and pa did, kaise I  wuz not born till we got to Mississippi River. Dar wuz fo' in de white  folks carriage--I is heered Maw tell it a thousand times, over and  over--In de carriage dar wuz Missus; and de fo' chilluns, Jeanette,  Clough, Winter and Ida. Marse Matt, he rid de horse right by de side o'  de carriage. Paw--de call him 'Obie', he driv a waggin wid all de little  nigger chaps in it dat wuz too little to walk. De big nigger boys and  gals dat wuz strong, dey walked. De roads wuz jus narrow little trails  wide enough fer de carriage and de waggin to git through de lims o' de  trees. Dey would hit you in de face iffin you didn't duck 'em, so maw  allus 'lowed. Dey had pack mules dat fetched along de supplies, fer dey  had to spen' de night in de thick woods what nebber had been cut. All  kinds er varmints used to git atter dem and maw 'lowed dat dey wuz  scared when dey sot camp, and she used to tremble mo' den she slep. When  she did sleep, she 'lowed dat she drempt de awful varmints wuz a gittin'  atter her. De missus, she wuz scared at night too. Marse Matt, he 'lowed  he warn't one bit scared, but maw sat dat Missus say he jump powerful in  he sleep sometimes.    \"Marse Matt had done sot a task of so many miles fer dem to travel from  sun-up to sundown, but maw 'lowed dat dey nebber did hardly git dat fer.  De pack mules would git short winded, and sometime de carriage horses,  dey would git lame; or one o' de waggin wheels would take and break; or  it wuz allus some bad luck er follerin atter dem. Den Marse Matt, he  'lowed dat he didn't believe in no travelin' signs, and 'cause o' dat,  maw 'lowed dat dey had de worsest kind o' luck. Dat is de reason dat de  train did not git no further than 'Promoter' County, Miss. (Mr. Wallace  really went to Como, Desoto County, Miss., verified by Mrs. J. Clough  Wallace). It took dem fo' weeks to reach 'Promotor'. Dar dey set up de  new home. Maw 'lowed dat dey wuz called tender feeted poineers by dem  what had got dar ahead of dem. Peers like maw 'lowed dat dey stayed dar  five year. Anyway de fus year, a lot o' de niggers tuck all manner o'  ailiments and dey died. De Missus, she kept full o' cold in dat log  house. Dey had a fine house here, you nos de house what Miss Roberta  Wallace libs in, well, dat wuz de one, cepin it wuz not as fine as Miss  Roberta got it now. Anyway, maw and paw, dey didn't like it no better  dan missus, cepin dey wuz skeered to speak dere minds. Finally, de  Marster, he tuck down sick, and in spite o' all dat Missus do fer him,  maw 'lowed he kept a growin' worser and worser till he tuck and died one  bad night. Missus, 'Dandy' de Marster allus called her, had got so broke  down wid worry and sorrow, dat she wuz nigh to death's door, herself,  when de Marster died, maw said. Fer dat reason, dey kept it from her fer  two weeks. Dey thought dat she wuz gwine to have de pneumonia, like him,  but she started to gittin' well fore she tuck de pneumonia. Maw said dat  dey used all o' de ole nigger remedies on de Missus dat dey knowed and  fer dat reason dey brung her through. Maw is told me dem remedies but I  is so ole now, dat I jus remembers dem. If Bob wuz at hisself he could  give you some. You come by here some day when de moon is right and den  Bob'll be in his right mind to tell you some o' dem.    \"De Missus, she come back powerful slow, and it wuz mi' nigh  Thanksgiving when she got strong. It wuz so cold dat she used to 'low  how she wish fer her paws big warm fire, and de Carolina sunshine. So  one bad morning, she took and got a letter from her paw in Union. He  axed her to fetch us all back here to Union. It had done tuck de letter  over three weeks to git to her. Long fore de Marster had died he had gib  up hope er gwine to Arkansas. When dat letter rive, maw 'lowed dat de  Missus she tuck and started to cryin'. All dat day she cry and read it  over an over. De very next morning she called up all us, I wuz born den,  and maw 'lowed dat I wuz a carrin' a sugar tit in my mouf and dat I had  de cooter bones round my neck. Course I disremembers all cept dat what I  is been told over and over. When maw and paw went out dar, dey had one  little chile. He wuz six years ole when dey got back here. One had done  tuck and died fore dey lef here. Den me and my sister, we wuz born in  Miss.    \"Dat wuz one glad day fer us, kaise Missus 'lowed dat she wuz a gwine  back to her paw in Union. All de niggers, dey started to dancing and a  hollerin' like dey wuz wile. Maw 'lowed dat some folks dat libbed three  miles away tuck and come to see us. Some o' dem called us slackers, er  sometin' kaise we wuz a leavin'; but others, maw 'lowed, dat dey wished  dey could go as fer as Georgia wid us. But I is nebber liked Georgia  myself. Missus gib de orders fer us to begin packin' and maw said dat de  way dem niggers worked wuz a dyin' sin. De Missus, she sell her mules  and other stock, kaise we wuz a gwine to ride all de way back on de  railroad train. It had jus broke through to Miss. Some o' de ole niggers  'lowed"]]]
