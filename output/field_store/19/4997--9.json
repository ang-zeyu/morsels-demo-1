The  First Consul looked upon her as his child.\"    Napoleon has been accused of an improper affection for Hortense. The  world has been filled with the slander. Says Bourrienne, \"Napoleon  never cherished for her any feeling but a real paternal tenderness.  He loved her after his marriage with her mother, as he would have  loved his own child. At least for three years I was a witness  to all their most private actions, and I declare I never saw any  thing that could furnish the least ground for suspicion, nor the  slightest trace of a culpable intimacy. This calumny must be classed  among those which malice delights to take in the character of men  who become celebrated, calumnies which are adopted lightly and without  reflection. Napoleon is no more. Let his memory be accompanied only  by that, be it good or bad, which really took place. Let not this  reproach be made a charge against him by the impartial historian.  I must say, in conclusion, on this delicate subject, that his  principles were rigid in an extreme degree, and that any fault of  the nature charged, neither entered his mind, nor was in accordance  with his morals or his taste.\"    At St. Helena Napoleon was one day looking over a book containing  an account of his amours. He smiled as he glanced his eye over the  pages, saying, \"I do not even know the names of most of the females  who are mentioned here. This is all very foolish. Every body knows  that had no time for such dissipation.\"    One beautiful evening, in the year 1815, the parish priest of San  Pietro, a village a few miles distant from Sevilla, returned much  fatigued to his little cottage, where he found his aged housekeeper,  the Senora Margarita, watching for him. Notwithstanding that one is  well accustomed to the sight of poverty in Spain, it was impossible  to help being struck by the utter of destitution which appeared  in the house of the good priest; the more so, as every imaginable  contrivance had been restored to, to hide the nakedness of the  walls, and the shabbiness of the furniture. Margarita had prepared  for her master's super a rather small dish of olla-podriga , which  consisted, to say the truth, of the remains of the dinner, seasoned  and disguised with great skill, and with the addition of some sauce,  and a name . As she placed the savory dish upon the table, the  priest said: \"We should thank God for this good supper, Margarita:  this olla-podriga makes one's mouth water. My friend, you ought  to be grateful for finding so good a supper at the house of your  host!\" At the word host, Margarita raised her eyes, and saw a  stranger, who had followed her mater. Her countenance changed, and  she looked annoyed. .......... She glanced indignantly first at  the unknown, and then at the priest, who, looking down, said in a  low voice, and with the timidity of a child: \"What is enough for  two, is always enough for three; and surely you would not wish that  I should allow a Christian to die of hunger? He has not tasted food  for two days.\"    \"A Christian! He is more like a brigand!\" and Margarita let the  room, murmuring loudly enough to be heard.    Meanwhile, the unwelcome guest had remained standing at the door.  He was a man of great height, half-dressed in rags and covered  with mud; while his black hair, piercing eyes, and carbine, gave  him an appearance which, though hardly prepossessing, was certainly  interesting. \"Must I go?\" said he.    The priest replied with an emphatic gesture: \"Those whom I bring  under my roof are never driven forth, and are never unwelcome. Put  down your carbine. Let us say grace, and go to table.\"    \"I never leave my carbine, for, as the Castilian proverb says, \"Two  friends are one.' My carbine is my best friend; and I always keep  it beside me. Although you allow me to come into your house, and  do not oblige me to leave until I wish to do so, there are others  who would think nothing of hauling me out, and perhaps, with me  feet foremost. Come--to your good health, mine host, and let us to  supper.\"    The priest possessed an extremely good appetite, but the voracity  of the stranger soon obliged him to give up, for not contented with  eating, or rather devouring, nearly the whole of the olla-podriga,  the guest finished a large loaf of bread, without leaving a crumb.  While he ate, he kept continually looking round with an expression  of inquietude: he started at the slightest sound; and once, when  a violent gust of wind made the door bang, he sprang to his feet,  and seized his carbine, with an air which showed that, if necessary,  he would sell his life dearly. Discovering the cause of the alarm,  he reseated himself at table, and finished his repast.    \"Now,\" said he, \"I have one thing more to ask. I have been wounded,  and for eight days my wound has not been dressed. Give me a few  old rags, and you shall be no longer burdened with my presence.\"    \"I am in no haste for you to go,\" replied the priest, whose quest,  notwithstanding his constant watchfulness, had conversed very  entertainingly. \"I know something of surgery, and will dress your  wound.\"    So saying, he took from a cupboard a case containing every thing  necessary, and proceeded to do as he had said. The stranger had  bled profusely, a ball having passed through his thigh; and to have  traveled in this condition, and while suffering, too, from want of  food, showed a strength, which seemed hardly human.    \"You can not possibly continue your journey to-day,\" said the  host. \"You must pass the night here. A little rest will get up your  strength, diminish the inflammation of your wound, and--\"    \"I must go to--day, and immediately,\" interrupted the stranger.  \"There are some who wait for me,\" he added with a sigh--\"and there  are some, too,who follow me.\" And the momentary look of softness  passed from his features between the clauses of the sentence, and  gave place to an expression almost of ferocity. \"Now, is it finished?  That is well. See, I can walk as firmly as though I had never been  wounded. Give me some bread: pay yourself for your hospitality with  this piece of gold, and adieu.\"    The priest put back the gold with displeasure. \"I am not an innkeeper,  said he; \"and I do not sell my hospitality.\"    \"As you will, but pardon me; and now farewell, my kind host.\"    So saying he took the bread, which Margarita, at her master's command,  very unwillingly gave him, and soon his tall figure disappeared  among the thick foliage of a wood which surrounded the house, or  rather the cabin. An hour had scarcely passed, when musket-shots  were heard close by, and the unknown reappeared, deadly pale, and  bleeding from a deep wound near the heart.    \"Take these,\" said he, giving pieces of gold to his late host;  \"they are for my children--near the stream--in the valley.\"    [missing pages]    deadly agency, which it had power to exert. Even the roadway leading  up and down the mountain is not always safe, it would seem, from  these dangerous intruders. It is rocky and solitary, and is bordered  every where with gloomy ravines and chasms, all filled with dense and  entangled thickets, in which, and in the cavernous rocks of which  the strata of the mountain are composed, wild beast and noxious  animals of every kind find a secure retreat. The monks relate that  not many years ago a servant of the convent, who had been sent  down the mountain to Haifa, to accompany a traveler, was attacked  and seized by a panther on his return. The panther, however, instead  of putting his victim immediately to death, began to play with him  as a cat plays with a mouse which she has succeeded in making her  prey-holding him gently with her claws, for a time, and then, after  drawing back a little, darting upon him again, as if to repeat and  renew the pleasure of capturing such a prize. This was continued so  long, that the cries of the terrified captive brought to the spot  some persons that chanced to be near, when the panther was terrified  in her turn, and fled into the forests; and then the man was rescued  from his horrible situation unharmed.    For these and similar reasons, travelers who ascend to the convent  of Mt. Carmel, enjoy but little liberty there, but most confine  their explorations in most cases to the buildings of the monks,  and to some of the nearest caves of the ancient recluses. Still  the spot is rendered so attractive by the salubrity of the air,  the intrinsic beauty of the situation, the magnificence of the  prospect, and the kind and attentive demeanor of the monks, that  some visitors have recommended it as a place of permanent resort  for those who leave their homes in the West in pursuit of health,  or in search of retirement and repose. The rule that requires those  who have been guests of the convent more than two weeks to give  place to others more recently arrived, proves in facto be no serious  difficulty. Some kind of an arrangement can in such cases always,  be made, though it is seldom that any occasion arises that requires  it. The quarters, too, though plain and simple are comfortable and  neat, and although the visitor is somewhat restricted, from causes  that have already been named, in respect to explorations of the  mountain itself, there are many excursions that can be made in the  country below, of a very attractive character. He can visit Haifa,  he can ride or walk along the beach to Acre; he can go to Nazareth,  or journey down the coast, passing round the western declivity of  the mountain. In these and similar rambles he will find scenes of  continual novelty to attract him, and be surrounded every where  with the forms and usages of Oriental life.    The traveler who comes to Mt.

But the trouble is, I  don't know just where to look for them. We couldn't get much of a  line in Majumba on where the country of the red pygmies is located.  What do you think about it, Mr. Durban?\"    \"As far as elephant hunting goes we can probably do as well in the  pygmy land as anywhere else,\" answered the veteran, \"and perhaps it  will be well to head for that place. If we run across any elephant  herds in the meanwhile, we can stop, get the ivory, and proceed.\"    They discussed this plan at some length, and agreed that it was the  best thing to do. Mr. Durban had a map of the country around the  center of Africa, and he marked on it, as nearly as he could, the  location of the pygmies' country, while Mr. Anderson also had a  chart, showing the location of the mission which had been wiped out  of existence. It was in the midst of a wild and desolate region.    \"We'll do the best we can,\" declared Tom, \"and I think we'll  succeed. We ought to be there in about a week, if we have no bad  luck.\"    All that night the Black Hawk flew on over Africa, covering mile  after mile, passing over jungle, forest, plains, rivers and lakes,  and, doubtless, over many native villages, though they could not be  seen.    Morning found the travelers above a great, grassy plain, dotted here  and there with negro settlements which were separated by rivers,  lakes or thin patches of forest.    \"Well, we'll speed up a bit,\" decided Tom after breakfast, which was  eaten to the weird accompaniment of hundreds of native warning-drums,  beaten by the superstitious blacks.    Tom went to the engine room, and turned on more speed. He was about  to go back to the pilot house, to set the automatic steering  apparatus to coincide with the course mapped out, when there was a  crash of metal, an ominous snapping and buzzing sound, followed by a  sudden silence.    \"What's that?\" cried Ned, who was in the motor compartment with his  chum.    \"Something's gone wrong!\" exclaimed the young inventor, as he sprang  back toward the engine. The propellers had ceased revolving, and as  there was no gas in the bag at that time, it having been decided to  save the vapor for future needs, the Black Hawk began falling toward  the earth.    \"We're going down!\" yelled Ned.    \"Yes, the main motor has broken!\" exclaimed Tom. \"We'll have to  descend to repair it.\"    \"Say!\" yelled Mr. Damon, rushing in, \"we're right over a big African  village! Are we going to fall among the natives?\"    \"It looks that way,\" admitted Tom grimly, as he hastened to the  pilot house to shift the wings so that the craft could glide easily  to the ground.    \"Bless my shoe blacking!\" cried the eccentric man as he heard the  beating of drums, and the shouts of the savages.    A little later the airship had settled into the midst of a crowd of  Africans, who swarmed all about the craft.          CHAPTER XIII    ON AN ELEPHANT TRAIL      \"Get ready with your guns, everybody!\" cried the old elephant  hunter, as he prepared to leave the cabin of the Black Hawk. \"Tom  Swift, don't forget your electric rifle. There'll be trouble soon!\"    \"Bless my cartridge belt!\" gasped Mr. Damon. \"Why? What will happen?\"    \"The natives,\" answered Mr. Durban. \"They'll attack us sure as fate!  See, already they're getting out their bows and arrows, and  blowguns! They'll pierce the gas bag in a hundred places!\"    \"If they do, it will be a bad thing for us,\" muttered Tom. \"We can't  have that happen.\"    He followed the old elephant hunter outside, and Mr. Anderson, Ned  Newton and Mr. Damon trailed after, each one with a gun, while Tom  had his electric weapon. The airship rested on its wheels on some  level ground, just in front of a large hut, surrounded by a number  of smaller ones. All about were the natives, tall, gaunt black men,  hideous in their savagery, wearing only the loin cloth, and with  their kinky hair stuck full of sticks, bones and other odd objects  they presented a curious sight.     Some of them were dancing about, brandishing their weapons--clubs  spears, bows, and arrows, or the long, slender blowguns, consisting  merely of a hollow reed. Women and children there were, too, also  dancing and leaping about, howling at the tops of their voices.  Above the unearthly din could be heard the noise of the drums and  tom-toms, while, as the adventurers drew up in front of their  airship, there came a sort of chant, and a line of natives, dressed  fantastically in the skins of beasts, came filing out of the large  hut.    \"The witch-doctors!\" exclaimed Tom, who had read of them in African  travel books.    \"Are they going to attack us?\" cried Ned.    \"Bless my hymn book! I hope not!\" came from Mr. Damon. \"We wouldn't  have any chance at all in this horde of black men. I wish Eradicate  Sampson and his mule Boomerang were here. Maybe he could talk their  language, and tell them that we meant no harm.\"    \"If there's any talking to be done, I guess our guns will have to do  it,\" said Tom grimly.    \"I can speak a little of their language,\" remarked Mr. Durban, \"but  what in the world are the beggars up to, anyhow? I supposed they'd  send a volley of arrows at us, first shot, but they don't seem to be  going to do that.\"    \"No, they're dancing around us,\" said Tom.    \"That's it!\" exclaimed Mr. Anderson. \"I have it! Why didn't I think  of it before? The natives are welcoming us!\"    \"Welcoming us?\" repeated Ned.    \"Yes,\" went on the missionary seeker. \"They are doing a dance in our  honor, and they have even called out the witch-doctors to do us  homage.\"    \"That's right,\" agreed Mr. Durban, who was listening to the chanting  of the natives dressed in animal skins. \"They take us for spirits  from another land, and are making us welcome here. Listen, I'll see  if I can make out what else they are saying.\"    The character of the shouts and chants changed abruptly, and the  dancing increased in fervor, even the children throwing themselves  wildly about. The witch-doctors ran around like so many maniacs, and  it looked as much like an American Indian war dance as anything  else.    \"I've got it!\" shouted Mr. Durban, for he had to call loudly to be  heard above the din. \"They are asking us to make it rain. It seems  there has been a dry spell here, and their own rain-makers and  witch-doctors haven't been able to get a drop out of the sky. Now,  they take it that we have come to help them. They think we are going  to bring rain.\"    \"And if we don't, what will happen?\" asked Tom.    \"Maybe they won't be quite so glad to see us,\" was the answer.    \"Well, if they don't mean war, we might as well put up our weapons,\"  suggested Mr. Anderson. \"If they're going to be friendly, so much  the better, and if it should happen to rain while we're here, they'd  think we brought it, and we could have almost anything we wanted.  Perhaps they have a store of ivory hidden away, Mr. Durban. Some of  these tribes do.\"    \"It's possible, but the chances for rain are very small. How long  will we have to stay here, Tom Swift?\" asked the elephant hunter  anxiously.    \"Well, perhaps I can get the motor mended in two or three days,\"  answered the young inventor.    \"Then we'll have to stay here in the meanwhile,\" decided Mr. Durban.  \"Well, we'll make the best of it. Ha, here comes the native king to  do us honor,\" and, as he spoke there came toward the airship a  veritable giant of a black man, wearing a leopard skin as a royal  garment, while on his head was a much battered derby hat, probably  purchased at a fabulous price from some trader. The king, if such he  could be called, was accompanied by a number of attendants and  witch-doctors. In front walked a small man, who, as it developed,  was an interpreter. The little cavalcade advanced close to the  airship, and came to a halt. The king made a low bow, either to the  craft or to the elephant hunters drawn up in front of it. His  attendants followed his example, and then the interpreter began to  speak.    Mr. Durban listened intently, made a brief answer to the little man,  and then the elephant hunter's face lighted up.    \"It's all right,\" he said to Tom and the others. \"The king takes us  for wonderful spirits from another land. He welcomes us, says we can  have whatever we want, and he begs us to make it rain. I have said  we will do our best, and I have asked that some food be sent us.  That's always the first thing to do. We'll be allowed to stay here  in peace until Tom can mend the ship, and then we'll hit the air  trail again.\"    The talk between Mr. Durban and the interpreter continued for some  little time longer. Then the king went back to his hut, refusing, as  Mr. Durban said, an invitation to come aboard and see how a modern  airship was constructed. The natives, too, seemed anxious to give  the craft a wide berth.    The excitement had quieted down now, and, in a short time a crowd of  native women came toward the airship, bearing, in baskets on their  heads, food of various kinds. There were bananas, some wild fruits,  yams, big gourds of goats' milk, some boiled and stewed flesh of  young goats, nicely cooked, and other things, the nature of which  could only be guessed at.    \"Shall we eat this stuff, or stick to Mr. Damon's cooking?\" asked  Tom.    \"Oh, you'll find this very good,\" explained Mr. Durban. \"I've eaten  native cookery before. Some of it is excellent and as this appears  to be very good, Mr. Damon can have a vacation while we are here.\"    The old elephant hunter proved the correctness of his statement by  beginning to eat, and soon all the travelers were partaking of the  food left by the native women. They placed it down on the ground at  a discreet distance from the airship, and hurriedly withdrew. But if  the women and men were afraid, the children were not, and they were  soon swarming about the "]]]
