The President was lying carelessly upon a sofa, holding a newspaper in  his hands. \"Mother, you are too suspicious. I give you credit for  sagacity, but you are disposed to magnify trifles. Chase is a patriot,  and one of my best friends.\"    \"Yes, one of your best friends because it is his interest to be so. He  is anything for Chase. If he thought he could make anything by it, he  would betray you to-morrow.\"    \"I fear that you are prejudiced against the man, mother. I know that you  do him injustice.\"    \"Mr. Lincoln, you are either blind or will not see. I am not the only  one that has warned you against him.\"    \"True, I receive letters daily from all parts of the country, telling me  not to trust Chase; but then these letters are written by the political  enemies of the Secretary, and it would be unjust and foolish to pay any  attention to them.\"    \"Very well, you will find out some day, if you live long enough, that I  have read the man correctly. I only hope that your eyes may not be  opened to the truth when it is too late.\" The President, as far as I  could judge from his conversation with his wife, continued to confide in  Mr. Chase to the time of his tragic death.    Mrs. Lincoln was especially severe on Mr. Wm. H. Seward, Secretary of  State. She but rarely lost an opportunity to say an unkind word of him.    One morning I went to the White House earlier than usual. Mr. Lincoln  was sitting in a chair, reading a paper, stroking with one hand the head  of little Tad. I was basting a dress for Mrs. Lincoln. A servant  entered, and handed the President a letter just brought by a messenger.  He broke the seal, and when he had read the contents his wife asked:    \"Who is the letter from, father?\"    \"Seward; I must go over and see him today.\"    \"Seward! I wish you had nothing to do with that man. He cannot be  trusted.\"    \"You say the same of Chase. If I listened to you, I should soon be  without a Cabinet.\"    \"Better be without it than to confide in some of the men that you do.  Seward is worse than Chase. He has no principle.\"    \"Mother, you are mistaken; your prejudices are so violent that you do  not stop to reason. Seward is an able man, and the country as well as  myself can trust him.\"    \"Father, you are too honest for this world! You should have been born a  saint. You will generally find it a safe rule to distrust a  disappointed, ambitious politician. It makes me mad to see you sit still  and let that hypocrite, Seward, twine you around his finger as if you  were a skein of thread.\"    \"It is useless to argue the question, mother. You cannot change my  opinion.\"    Mrs. Lincoln prided herself upon her ability to read character. She was  shrewd and far-seeing, and had no patience with the frank, confiding  nature of the President.    When Andrew Johnson was urged for military Governor of Tennessee, Mrs.  Lincoln bitterly opposed the appointment.    \"He is a demagogue,\" she said, almost fiercely, \"and if you place him in  power, Mr. Lincoln, mark my words, you will rue it some day.\"    General McClellan, when made Commander-in-Chief, was the idol of the  soldiers, and never was a general more universally popular. \"He is a  humbug,\" remarked Mrs. Lincoln one day in my presence.    \"What makes you think so, mother?\" good-naturedly inquired the  President.    \"Because he talks so much and does so little. If I had the power I would  very soon take off his head, and put some energetic man in his place.\"    \"But I regard McClellan as a patriot and an able soldier. He has been  much embarrassed. The troops are raw, and the subordinate officers  inclined to be rebellious. There are too many politicians in the army  with shoulder-straps. McClellan is young and popular, and they are  jealous of him. They will kill him off if they can.\"    \"McClellan can make plenty of excuse for himself, therefore he needs no  advocate in you. If he would only do something, and not promise so much,  I might learn to have a little faith in him. I tell you he is a humbug,  and you will have to find some man to take his place, that is, if you  wish to conquer the South.\"    Mrs. Lincoln could not tolerate General Grant. \"He is a butcher,\" she  would often say, \"and is not fit to be at the head of an army.\"    \"But he has been very successful in the field,\" argued the President.    \"Yes, he generally manages to claim a victory, but such a victory! He  loses two men to the enemy's one. He has no management, no regard for  life. If the war should continue four years longer, and he should remain  in power, he would depopulate the North. I could fight an army as well  myself. According to his tactics, there is nothing under the heavens to  do but to march a new line of men up in front of the rebel breastworks  to be shot down as fast as they take their position, and keep marching  until the enemy grows tired of the slaughter. Grant, I repeat, is an  obstinate fool and a butcher.\"    \"Well, mother, supposing that we give you command of the army. No doubt  you would do much better than any general that has been tried.\" There  was a twinkle in the eyes, and a ring of irony in the voice.    I have often heard Mrs. Lincoln say that if Grant should ever be elected  President of the United States she would desire to leave the country,  and remain absent during his term of office.    It was well known that Mrs. Lincoln's brothers were in the Confederate  army, and for this reason it was often charged that her sympathies were  with the South. Those who made the hasty charge were never more widely  mistaken.    One morning, on my way to the White House, I heard that Captain  Alexander Todd, one of her brothers, had been killed. I did not like to  inform Mrs. Lincoln of his death, judging that it would be painful news  to her. I had been in her room but a few minutes when she said, with  apparent unconcern, \"Lizzie, I have just heard that one of my brothers  has been killed in the war.\"    \"I also heard the same, Mrs. Lincoln, but hesitated to speak of it, for  fear the subject would be a painful one to you.\"    \"You need not hesitate. Of course, it is but natural that I should feel  for one so nearly related to me, but not to the extent that you suppose.  He made his choice long ago. He decided against my husband, and through  him against me. He has been fighting against us; and since he chose to  be our deadly enemy, I see no special reason why I should bitterly mourn  his death.\"    I felt relieved, and in subsequent conversations learned that Mrs.  Lincoln had no sympathy for the South. \"Why should I sympathize with the  rebels,\" she would say; \"are they not against me? They would hang my  husband to-morrow if it was in their power, and perhaps gibbet me with  him. How then can I sympathize with a people at war with me and mine?\"  She always objected to being thought Southern in feeling.    Mr. Lincoln was generous by nature, and though his whole heart was in  the war, he could not but respect the valor of those opposed to him. His  soul was too great for the narrow, selfish views of partisanship. Brave  by nature himself, he honored bravery in others, even his foes. Time and  again I have heard him speak in the highest terms of the soldierly  qualities of such brave Confederate generals as Lee, Stonewall Jackson,  and Joseph E. Johns[t]on. Jackson was his ideal soldier. \"He is a brave,  honest Presbyterian soldier,\" were his words; \"what a pity that we  should have to fight such a gallant fellow! If we only had such a man to  lead the armies of the North, the country would not be appalled with so  many disasters.\"    As this is a rambling chapter, I will here record an incident showing  his feeling toward Robert E. Lee. The very morning of the day on which  he was assassinated, his son, Capt. Robert Lincoln, came into the room  with a portrait of General Lee in his hand. The President took the  picture, laid it on a table before him, scanned the face thoughtfully,  and said: \"It is a good face; it is the face of a noble, noble, brave  man. I am glad that the war is over at last.\" Looking up at Robert, he  continued: \"Well, my son, you have returned safely from the front. The  war is now closed, and we soon will live in peace with the brave men  that have been fighting against us. I trust that the era of good feeling  has returned with the war, and that henceforth we shall live in peace.  Now listen to me, Robert: you must lay aside your uniform, and return to  college. I wish you to read law for three years, and at the end of that  time I hope that we will be able to tell whether you will make a lawyer  or not.\" His face was more cheerful than I had seen it for a long while,  and he seemed to be in a generous, forgiving mood.          CHAPTER IX    BEHIND THE SCENES      Some of the freedmen and freedwomen had exaggerated ideas of liberty. To  them it was a beautiful vision, a land of sunshine, rest and glorious  promise. They flocked to Washington, and since their extravagant hopes  were not realized, it was but natural that many of them should bitterly  feel their disappointment. The colored people are wedded to  associations, and when you destroy these you destroy half of the  happiness of their lives. They make a home, and are so fond of it that  they prefer it, squalid though it be, to the comparative ease and luxury  of a shifting, roaming life. Well, the emancipated slaves, in coming  North, left old associations behind them, and the love for the past was  so strong that they could not find much beauty in the new life so  suddenly opened to them. Thousands of the disappointed, huddled together  in camps, fretted and pined like children for the \"good old times.\" In  visiting them in the interests of the Relief Society of which I was  president, they would crowd around me with pitiful stories of distress.  Often I heard them declare that they would rather go back to slavery "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25"],[0,"The 1991 CIA World Factbook (#12)"],[1,", Jewish 2%, other 6%      _#_Language: Spanish (official), English, Italian, German, French      _#_Literacy: 95% (male 96%, female 95%) age 15 and over can  read and write (1990 est.)      _#_Labor force: 10,900,000; agriculture 12%, industry 31%, services  57% (1985 est.)      _#_Organized labor: 3,000,000; 28% of labor force      _*_Government  _#_Long-form name: Argentine Republic      _#_Type: republic      _#_Capital: Buenos Aires (tentative plans to move to Viedma by  1990 indefinitely postponed)      _#_Administrative divisions: 22 provinces (provincias,  singular--provincia), 1 national territory* (territorio nacional), and 1  district** (distrito); Buenos Aires, Catamarca, Chaco, Chubut, Cordoba,  Corrientes, Distrito Federal**, Entre Rios, Formosa, Jujuy, La Pampa,  La Rioja, Mendoza, Misiones, Neuquen, Rio Negro, Salta, San Juan, San  Luis, Santa Cruz, Santa Fe, Santiago del Estero, Tierra del Fuego,  Antartida e Islas del Atlantico Sur*, Tucuman; note--the national  territory is in the process of becoming a province; the US does not  recognize claims to Antarctica      _#_Independence: 9 July 1816 (from Spain)      _#_Constitution: 1 May 1853      _#_Legal system: mixture of US and West European legal systems; has  not accepted compulsory ICJ jurisdiction      _#_National holiday: Revolution Day, 25 May (1810)      _#_Executive branch: president, vice president, Cabinet      _#_Legislative branch: bicameral National Congress (Congreso Nacional)  consists of an upper chamber or Senate (Senado) and a lower chamber or  Chamber of Deputies (Camara de Diputados)      _#_Judicial branch: Supreme Court (Corte Suprema)      _#_Leaders:    Chief of State and Head of Government--President Carlos Saul  MENEM (since 8 July 1989); Vice President Eduardo DUHALDE (since 8 July  1989)      _#_Political parties and leaders:  Justicialist Party (JP), Carlos Saul MENEM, Peronist umbrella political  organization;  Radical Civic Union (UCR), Raul ALFONSIN, moderately left of center;  Union of the Democratic Center (UCD), Alvaro ALSOGARAY, conservative  party;  Intransigent Party (PI), Dr. Oscar ALENDE, leftist party;  several provincial parties      _#_Suffrage: universal at age 18      _#_Elections:    President--last held 14 May 1989 (next to be held May 1995);  results--Carlos Saul MENEM was elected;    Chamber of Deputies--last held 14 May 1989 (next to be  held October 1991); results--JP 47%, UCR 30%, UCD 7%, other 16%;  seats--(254 total); JP 122, UCR 93, UCD 11, other 28      _#_Communists: some 70,000 members in various party organizations,  including a small nucleus of activists      _#_Other political or pressure groups: Peronist-dominated labor  movement, General Confederation of Labor (Peronist-leaning umbrella labor  organization), Argentine Industrial Union (manufacturers' association),  Argentine Rural Society (large landowners' association), business  organizations, students, the Roman Catholic Church, the Armed Forces      _#_Member of: AfDB, AG (observer), CCC, ECLAC, FAO, G-6, G-11,  G-19, G-24, G-77, GATT, IADB, IAEA, IBRD, ICAO, ICC, ICFTU, IDA, IFAD,  IFC, ILO, IMF, IMO, INMARSAT, INTELSAT, INTERPOL, IOC, IOM, ISO, ITU,  LAES, LAIA, LORCS, NAM, OAS, PCA, RG, UN, UNAVEM, UNCTAD,  UNESCO, UNHCR, UNIDO, UNIIMOG, UNTSO, UPU, WCL, WFTU, WHO, WIPO, WMO, WTO      _#_Diplomatic representation: Ambassador Ortiz de ROZAS;  Chancery at 1600 New Hampshire Avenue NW, Washington DC 20009; telephone  (202) 939-6400 through 6403; there are Argentine Consulates General in  Houston, Miami, New Orleans, New York, San Francisco, and San Juan  (Puerto Rico), and Consulates in Baltimore, Chicago, and Los Angeles;    US--Ambassador Terence A.

Nevertheless, following decades of  mismanagement and statist policies, the economy has encountered  major problems in recent years, leading to escalating inflation and  a recession in 1988-90.
