CHAPTER V.    STANDARD OF TASTE IN BEAUTY.      The expression, \"standard of taste,\" is used to signify the basis or  foundation of our judgments respecting beauty and deformity, and their  consequent certainty.    Setting aside such objection as might be raised to a standard of taste on  the doctrine of Berkeley (which I refuted in 1809, and which I need not  enter into here), this matter was long ago settled by David Hume; and I  have nothing new to say upon the subject (there is probably enough of  novelty in other chapters, whatever its worth may be), except that Burke  appears to have borrowed all he knew about it from that incomparably more  profound philosopher.    As I ought not, however, to omit here a view of the subject, I cannot do  better than transcribe the words of Hume and Burke respectively. While  this will put the reader in possession of all that I think necessary upon  this subject, it will farther tend to show in what Burke's ability as a  philosopher consisted.    I must first, however, observe that the word \"taste,\" as expressing our  judgment of beauty, is a metaphor whimsically borrowed from the lowest of  our senses, and is applied to our exercise of that faculty, as regards  both natural objects, and the fine arts which imitate these.    It is not wonderful that the variety and inconstancy of tastes respecting  the attributes and the characters of beauty, should have led many  philosophers to deny that there exist any certain combinations of forms  and of effects to which the term beauty ought to be invariably attached.    In his \"Philosophical Dictionary,\" Voltaire, after quoting some nonsense  from the crazy dreamer who did so much injury to Greek philosophy, says:  \"I am willing to believe that nothing can be more beautiful than this  discourse of Plato; but it does not give us very clear ideas of the nature  of the beautiful. Ask of a toad what is beauty, pure beauty, the [Greek:  to kalon]; he will answer you that it is his female, with two large round  eyes projecting from her little head, a large and flat throat, a yellow  belly, and a brown back. Ask the devil, and he will tell you that the  beautiful is a pair of horns, four claws, and a tail. Consult, lastly, the  philosophers, and they will answer you by rigmarole: they want something  conformable to the archetype of the beautiful in essence, to the [Greek:  to kalon].\" This is wit, not reason: let us look for that to a deeper  thinker--as proposed above.    David Hume says: \"It appears that, amid all the variety and caprice of  taste, there are certain general principles of approbation or blame, whose  influence a careful eye may trace in all operations of the mind. Some  particular forms or qualities from the original structure of the internal  fabric, are calculated to please, and others to displease.... If they fail  of their effect in any particular instance, it is from some apparent  _defect_ or imperfection in the organ.    \"In each creature there is a sound and a defective state; and the former  alone can be supposed to afford us a true standard of taste and sentiment.  If, in the sound state of the organ, there be an entire or a considerable  uniformity of sentiment among men, we may thence derive an idea of the  perfect beauty; in like manner as the appearance of objects in daylight,  to the eye of a man in health, is denominated their true and real color.\"    To the same purpose writes Burke, after some preliminary observations:--    \"All the natural powers in man, which I know, that are conversant about  external objects, are the senses, the imagination, and the judgment.    \"First, with regard to the senses. We do and we must suppose, that, as the  conformations of their organs are nearly or altogether the same in all  men, so the manner of perceiving external objects is in all men the same,  or with little difference.    \"As there will be little doubt that bodies present similar images to the  whole species, it must necessarily be allowed, that the pleasures and the  pains which every object excites in one man, it must raise in all mankind,  while it operates naturally, simply, and by its proper powers only.    \"Custom, and some other causes, have made many deviations from the natural  pleasures or pains which belong to these several tastes; but then the  power of distinguishing between the natural and the acquired relish  remains to the very last.    \"There is in all men a sufficient remembrance of the original natural  causes of pleasure, to enable them to bring all things offered to their  senses to that standard, and to regulate their feelings and opinions by  it.    \"Suppose one who had so vitiated his palate as to take more pleasure in  the taste of opium than in that of butter or honey, to be presented with a  bolus of squills; there is hardly any doubt but that he would prefer the  butter or honey to this nauseous morsel, or to any other bitter drug to  which he had not been accustomed; which proves that his palate was  naturally like that of other men in all things, that it is still like the  palate of other men in many things, and only vitiated in some particular  points.\"    In the same manner, Payne Knight observes that \"things, naturally the most  nauseous, become most grateful; and things, naturally most grateful, most  insipid.    \"This extreme effect, however, only takes place where the palate has  become morbid and vitiated by continued, and even forced gratification;  and even when the metaphors taken from this sense, and employed to express  intellectual qualities, show that it is always felt and considered as a  corruption, even by those who are most corrupted: for though there are  many who prefer port wine to malmsey, and tobacco to sugar, yet no one  ever spoke of a sour or bitter temper as pleasant, or of a sweet one as  unpleasant.\" By this concession, Knight answers several of his own  objections.    \"When it is said,\" farther observes Burke, very properly, \"taste cannot be  disputed, it can only mean, that no one can strictly answer what pleasure  or pain some particular man may find from the taste of some particular  thing. This indeed cannot be disputed; but we may dispute, and with  sufficient clearness too, concerning the things which are naturally  pleasing or disagreeable to the sense. But when we talk of any peculiar or  acquired relish, then we must know the habits, the prejudices, or the  distempers of this particular man, and we must draw our conclusions from  those.\"    Hume proceeds to a second point, by observing that \"one obvious cause, why  many feel not the proper sentiment of beauty, is the want of that  _delicacy_ of imagination which is requisite to convey a sensibility of  those finer emotions.    \"Where the organs are so fine, as to allow nothing to escape them, and at  the same time so exact, as to perceive every ingredient in the  composition; this we call delicacy of taste, whether we employ these terms  in the literal or metaphorical sense.\"    Burke enlarges on this, after preliminary observing that \"the power of the  imagination is incapable of producing anything absolutely new; it can only  vary the disposition of those ideas which it has received from the  senses. Now, the imagination is the most extensive province of pleasure  and pain, as it is the region of our fears and our hopes, and of all our  passions that are connected with them.    \"Since the imagination is only the representation of the senses, it can  only be pleased or displeased with the images, from the same principle on  which the sense is pleased or displeased with the realities; and  consequently there must be just as close an agreement in the imaginations  as in the senses of men.    \"There are some men formed with feelings so blunt, with tempers so cold  and phlegmatic, that they can hardly be said to be awake during the whole  course of their lives. Upon such persons, the most striking objects make  but a faint and obscure impression. There are others so continually in the  agitation of gross and merely sensual pleasures, or so occupied in the low  drudgery of avarice, or so heated in the chase of honors and distinction,  that their minds, which had been used continually to the storms of these  violent and tempestuous passions, can hardly be put in motion by the  delicate and refined play of the imagination. These men, though from a  different cause, become as stupid and insensible as the former; but  whenever either of these happen to be struck with any natural elegance or  greatness, or with these qualities in any work of art, they are moved upon  the same principle.\"    On a third point, Hume says: \"But though there be naturally a wide  difference in point of delicacy between one person and another, nothing  tends farther to increase and improve this talent, than _practice_ in a  particular art, and the frequent survey or contemplation of a particular  species of beauty.    \"So advantageous is practice to the discernment of beauty, that, before we  can give judgment on any work of importance, it will even be requisite  that that very individual performance be more than once perused by us, and  be surveyed in different lights with attention and deliberation.\"    This is well"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35413"],[0,"A Review of the Middle American Tree Frogs of the Genus Ptychohyla (#12)"],[1,"small  papillae; inner surfaces of mouth smooth; scattered large papillae  forming nearly one complete row around teeth; other papillae  laterally; beaks moderately developed, bearing long, pointed  denticulations; no lateral projections on upper beak; tooth-rows 3/3,  all short; second and third upper rows subequal in length; first upper  row shorter; first and third upper rows interrupted medially; first  lower row interrupted medially, equal in length to second and third  upper rows; second lower row slightly shorter; third lower row  shortest.    Body dark brown above and dark gray below; fleshy part of mouth creamy  gray mottled with dark brown; caudal musculature pale tan with heavy  suffusion of brown flecks; caudal fin transparent with brown spots;  dark brown streak mid-laterally on anterior one-fifth of caudal  musculature, bordered below by cream-colored spot; eye brown in life.    _Variation._--The third upper tooth-row is interrupted in all  specimens, but in some individuals the first upper row and first lower  row are complete. The only noted variation in color is the intensity  of brown pigmentation on the caudal musculature, which in most  specimens is sufficiently dense to make the tail look brown. In some  specimens the mid-lateral streak is indistinct, and the pale spot  below the streak is absent.    _Comparisons._--Aside from the characters listed in the diagnosis,  _Ptychohyla schmidtorum chamulae_ differs from _P. schmidtorum  schmidtorum_ by having dark brown webbing on the feet, instead of pale  creamy tan webbing, and in having in life a yellow venter, instead of  a white venter. _Ptychohyla ignicolor_ also is green in life, but has  red flash-colors on the thighs, red webbing on the feet, and lacks the  white lateral stripe diagnostic of _P. schmidtorum chamulae_.    _Plectrohyla matudai matudai_ and _P. guatemalensis_ are sympatric  with _Ptychohyla schmidtorum chamulae_. Each of the first two has a  bony prepollex, rugose skin on the dorsum, and heavy body. Also living  with _Ptychohyla chamulae_ are _Hyla chaneque_, a large species having  a tuberculate dorsum and webbed fingers, and _Hyla bivocata_, a small  yellow species having a broad, flat head, small indistinct tympanum,  and an axillary membrane.    _Life History._--Calling males were found on leaves of herbs and  bushes by cascading streams in cloud forest. The call consists of  series of short notes, three to nine notes per series, sounding like  \"raa-raa-raa.\" The duration of each note is .054 to .070 of a second,  and has a rate of 96 to 110 pulses per second. The dominant frequency  falls between 3350 and 3450 cycles per second (Pl. 11D). The call is  almost indistinguishable from that of _Ptychohyla schmidtorum  schmidtorum_.    Tadpoles were found in the cascading streams; the smallest tadpole has  a total length of 17.2 mm. and has only 3/2 tooth-rows. At a stream  6.2 kilometers south of Rayon Mescalapa, Chiapas, metamorphosing young  were found on June 16 and August 5, 1960. Each of two completely  metamorphosed young has a snout-vent length of 15.7 mm. Another having  a snout-vent length of 16.2 mm. has a tail stub 2 mm. long and a  completely metamorphosed mouth. Two others have snout-vent lengths of  13.6 and 14.1 mm. and tail lengths of 11.5 and 8.1 mm. respectively;  in these the mouth parts are incompletely metamorphosed.    _Remarks._--Duellman (1961:354) described _Ptychohyla chamulae_ and  stated that it probably was most closely related to _P. schmidtorum_.  Further study has revealed additional resemblance in morphological and  behavioral details. It is concluded that the two populations are more  realistically treated as subspecies than as species. The geographic  ranges, as now known, are disjunct. _Ptychohyla schmidtorum chamulae_  inhabits cloud forest on the Atlantic slopes of the Chiapan Highlands,  whereas _P. s. schmidtorum_ lives in cloud forest on the Pacific  slopes of the Sierra Madre in Chiapas and Guatemala. Between their  known geographic ranges are the pine clad Sierra Madre and Chiapan  Highlands, and intervening sub-humid Grijalva Valley.    _Distribution._--This species is known only from elevations between  1500 and 1700 meters on the Atlantic slopes of the Chiapan Highlands;  it is to be expected in cloud forests on the northern slopes of the  Sierra de Cuchumatanes in Guatemala.    _Specimens examined._--MEXICO: _Chiapas: 15 km.
