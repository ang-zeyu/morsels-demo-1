And this is what we  mean by the original contract of society; which, though perhaps in no  instance it has ever been formally expressed at the first institution  of a state, yet in nature and reason must always be understood and  implied, in the very act of associating together: namely, that the  whole should protect all it's parts, and that every part should pay  obedience to the will of the whole; or, in other words, that the  community should guard the rights of each individual member, and that  (in return for this protection) each individual should submit to the  laws of the community; without which submission of all it was  impossible that protection could be certainly extended to any.    FOR when society is once formed, government results of course, as  necessary to preserve and to keep that society in order. Unless some  superior were constituted, whose commands and decisions all the  members are bound to obey, they would still remain as in a state of  nature, without any judge upon earth to define their several rights,  and redress their several wrongs. But, as all the members of society  are naturally equal, it may be asked, in whose hands are the reins of  government to be entrusted? To this the general answer is easy; but  the application of it to particular cases has occasioned one half of  those mischiefs which are apt to proceed from misguided political  zeal. In general, all mankind will agree that government should be  reposed in such persons, in whom those qualities are most likely to be  found, the perfection of which are among the attributes of him who is  emphatically stiled the supreme being; the three grand requisites, I  mean, of wisdom, of goodness, and of power: wisdom, to discern the  real interest of the community; goodness, to endeavour always to  pursue that real interest; and strength, or power, to carry this  knowlege and intention into action. These are the natural foundations  of sovereignty, and these are the requisites that ought to be found in  every well constituted frame of government.    HOW the several forms of government we now see in the world at first  actually began, is matter of great uncertainty, and has occasioned  infinite disputes. It is not my business or intention to enter into  any of them. However they began, or by what right soever they  subsist, there is and must be in all of them a supreme, irresistible,  absolute, uncontrolled authority, in which the _jura summi imperii_,  or the rights of sovereignty, reside. And this authority is placed in  those hands, wherein (according to the opinion of the founders of such  respective states, either expressly given, or collected from their  tacit approbation) the qualities requisite for supremacy, wisdom,  goodness, and power, are the most likely to be found.    THE political writers of antiquity will not allow more than three  regular forms of government; the first, when the sovereign power is  lodged in an aggregate assembly consisting of all the members of a  community, which is called a democracy; the second, when it is lodged  in a council, composed of select members, and then it is stiled an  aristocracy; the last, when it is entrusted in the hands of a single  person, and then it takes the name of a monarchy. All other species of  government, they say, are either corruptions of, or reducible to,  these three.    BY the sovereign power, as was before observed, is meant the making of  laws; for wherever that power resides, all others must conform to, and  be directed by it, whatever appearance the outward form and  administration of the government may put on. For it is at any time in  the option of the legislature to alter that form and administration by  a new edict or rule, and to put the execution of the laws into  whatever hands it pleases: and all the other powers of the state must  obey the legislative power in the execution of their several  functions, or else the constitution is at an end.    IN a democracy, where the right of making laws resides in the people  at large, public virtue, or goodness of intention, is more likely to  be found, than either of the other qualities of government. Popular  assemblies are frequently foolish in their contrivance, and weak in  their execution; but generally mean to do the thing that is right and  just, and have always a degree of patriotism or public spirit. In  aristocracies there is more wisdom to be found, than in the other  frames of government; being composed, or intended to be composed, of  the most experienced citizens; but there is less honesty than in a  republic, and less strength than in a monarchy. A monarchy is indeed  the most powerful of any, all the sinews of government being knit  together, and united in the hand of the prince; but then there is  imminent danger of his employing that strength to improvident or  oppressive purposes.    THUS these three species of government have, all of them, their  several perfections and imperfections. Democracies are usually the  best calculated to direct the end of a law; aristocracies to invent  the means by which that end shall be obtained; and monarchies to carry  those means into execution. And the antients, as was observed, had in  general no idea of any other permanent form of government but these  three; for though Cicero[f] declares himself of opinion, \"_esse optime  constitutam rempublicam, quae ex tribus generibus illis, regali,  optimo, et populari, sit modice confusa_;\" yet Tacitus treats this  notion of a mixed government, formed out of them all, and partaking of  the advantages of each, as a visionary whim; and one that, if  effected, could never be lasting or secure[g].    [Footnote f: In his fragments _de rep._ _l._ 2.]    [Footnote g: \"_Cunctas nationes et urbes populus, aut primores, aut  singuli regunt: delecta ex his, et constituta reipublicae forma  laudari facilius quam evenire, vel, si evenit, haud diuturna esse  potest._\" _Ann._ _l._ 4.]    BUT happily for us of this island, the British constitution has long  remained, and I trust will long continue, a standing exception to the  truth of this observation. For, as with us the executive power of the  laws is lodged in a single person, they have all the advantages of  strength and dispatch, that are to be found in the most absolute  monarchy; and, as the legislature of the kingdom is entrusted to three  distinct powers, entirely independent of each other; first, the king;  secondly, the lords spiritual and temporal, which is an aristocratical  assembly of persons selected for their piety, their birth, their  wisdom, their valour, or their property; and, thirdly, the house of  commons, freely chosen by the people from among themselves, which  makes it a kind of democracy; as this aggregate body, actuated by  different springs, and attentive to different interests, composes the  British parliament, and has the supreme disposal of every thing; there  can no inconvenience be attempted by either of the three branches, but  will be withstood by one of the other two; each branch being armed  with a negative power, sufficient to repel any innovation which it  shall think inexpedient or dangerous.    HERE then is lodged the sovereignty of the British constitution; and  lodged as beneficially as is possible for society. For in no other  shape could we be so certain of finding the three great qualities of  government so well and so happily united. If the supreme power were  lodged in any one of the three branches separately, we must be exposed  to the inconveniences of either absolute monarchy, aristocracy, or  democracy; and so want two of the three principal ingredients of good  polity, either virtue, wisdom, or power. If it were lodged in any two  of the branches; for instance, in the king and house of lords, our  laws might be providently made, and well executed, but they might not  always have the good of the people in view: if lodged in the king and  commons, we should want that circumspection and mediatory caution,  which the wisdom of the peers is to afford: if the supreme rights of  legislature were lodged in the two houses only, and the king had no  negative upon their proceedings, they might be tempted to encroach  upon the royal prerogative, or perhaps to abolish the kingly office,  and thereby weaken (if not totally destroy) the strength of the  executive power. But the constitutional government of this island is  so admirably tempered and compounded, that nothing can endanger or  hurt it, but destroying the equilibrium of power between one branch of  the legislature and the rest. For if ever it should happen that the  independence of any one of the three should be lost, or that it should  become subservient to the views of either of the other two, there  would soon be an end of our constitution. The legislature would be  changed from that, which was originally set up by the general consent  and fundamental act of the society; and such a change, however  effected, is according to Mr Locke[h] (who perhaps carries his theory  too far) at once an entire dissolution of the bands of government; and  the people would be reduced to a state of anarchy, with liberty to  constitute to themselves a new legislative power.    [Footnote h: On government, part 2. Sec. 212.]    HAVING thus cursorily considered the three usual species of  government, and our own singular constitution, selected and compounded  from them all, I proceed to observe, that, as the power of making laws  constitutes the supreme authority, so wherever the supreme authority  in any state resides, it is the right of that authority to make laws;  that is, in the words of our definition, _to prescribe the rule of  civil action_. And this may be discovered from the very end and  institution of civil states. For a state is a collective body,  composed of a multitude of individuals, united for their safety and  convenience, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30850"],[0,"Philippine Mats (#12)"],[1,"and 12 mm. in diameter. The leaves are made into  straw from which coarse mats are woven.    Taboan is the name given to Pandanus dubius in Surigao while in  Bohol it is known as bacong. It is a rare species. It is said to be a  heavy, clumsy appearing tree with stem about 8 m. high, wide spreading  branches near the top, and soft, pulpy and stringy wood. The flowers  are grouped into an inflorescence. The male inflorescence, about  60 cm. long and partly covered by creamy yellow bracts, is erect  and occurs at the end of the branches. The leaves are deep green in  color on both sides, with an average length of 2.25 cm. and a width  of 20 cm. The drupes of this pandan are from 8 cm. to 13 cm. long and  from 5 cm. to 8 cm. wide. The plant is utilized to a small extent in  making mats.    In the Tagalog speaking provinces of Bulacan, Bataan, and in  and around Manila, Pandanus luzonensis is called \"alasas.\" It is  also called \"pandan\" but this name should be reserved for Pandanus  tectorius. The former is restricted in its habitat to the provinces  around Manila Bay, while the latter is found in most of the seacoast  provinces of the Philippines as well as in other tropical parts of  the world. Pandanus luzonensis attains a greater height than Pandanus  tectorius, but has narrower leaves than the latter. The male flowers  are borne in a fleshy, much-branched inflorescence from 20 to 30  cm. long. Each branch is partly surrounded by a broad thin bract,  8 cm. wide. Each individual flower has from 4 to 9 stamens. The whole  fruit is about 20 centimeters long and contains from 30 to 60 drupes,  yellowish red in color when ripe. Each drupe is from 3 to 4 cm. long,  2 to 2.5 cm. thick, and contains from 6 to 10 seeds. The straw from  this pandan is of inferior quality, though it is said to be used in  Bulacan for mats.        Unidentified Pandans.    Besides the pandans, the identity of which has been explained above,  there are several unidentified specimens or varieties from which mats  are made. It may be that some of these will be found identical with  those already discussed when sufficient botanical material has been  gathered to determine them.    In Isabela Province, a pandan known as \"langu\" having long, strong,  thin leaves, is made into mats in Santa Maria, Delena and Bolasi.    Mats are made along the coast of Cagayan Province, in the Ilocano  barrios of the towns of Claveria and Sanchez Mira, from a pandan  known as \"pataga.\" These are very coarse and thick and have an  unusually shiny surface. According to Mr. Otto Harwood, the leaves  vary in length from 10 cm. to 35.5 cm. and in width from 7.5 cm. to  15 cm. The straw is made by cutting the leaf into strips and drying  them in the sun. Although the industry is yet small, it is developing.    A species of pandan is employed in the towns of Camalaniugan, Aparri,  Gataran, and Lal-loc in Cagayan Province for making mats. Locally  they are valued at from 40 to 50 centavos, but in Isabela Province  to which they are exported they sell for as high as a peso and a half.    The only municipality in Pangasinan province in which the making  of mats has reached provincial and interprovincial importance is  Bolinao. The species of pandan employed is not known. The mats are  shipped to towns along the seacoast of Ilocos and Zambales Province  by sailing vessels, and are sold in the local markets or to local  merchants.    In Mindoro the town of Subang makes pandan mats which are shipped to  Batangas, Cavite, and Manila.    Two pandans, called lingo and baring were sent to the General Office  of the Bureau of Education from Guindalman, Bohol. It was impossible  to identify them as no fruit was included. They probably represent  two new species. Lingo has a leaf 2.9 m. in length and of an almost  uniform width of 5.5 cm. At 80 cm. from the tip, it is 4.5 cm. wide,  then gradually becomes acuminate. The marginal spines are 2 mm. long,  curved forward, from 6 to 8 mm. apart near the stem, but closer  together at the distal one-third of the leaf. Spines of 1 mm. or  less in length and 4 mm. or less apart, curved forward and extending  throughout the length of the leaf, occur on the lower surface of the  midrib only. The surface of the leaf is smooth and shiny. The leaf  of baring is 72 cm. long, 2.8 cm. wide, apparently spineless, smooth  and fine in texture. Both of these pandans would probably yield good  industrial materials.    In Iloilo, the town of Banate has a pandan mat industry of  interprovincial importance, whose product is an article of commerce  as far as Negros. The mats sell at about 50 centavos each.    There is a large export of pandan mats from Dao, Antique, to the  province of Iloilo.    Pandan mats are exported from Cuyo Island in Palawan. Some are sent  to the mainland of Palawan and others to Antique.    The Moro pandan mats are the most richly colored of all those  produced in the Philippines. At this writing, information is not at  hand to determine the method of preparing the straw or the species  of pandan from which they are made. Mats which have been exhibited  at successive Philippine expositions have undoubtedly been dyed with  imported coloring matter. The designs are of the general effect of  the mat reproduced on page 84. The colors are often well combined  and the effect is very striking. The Cottabato mats are double;  the under portion is woven of thick, heavy, uncolored straw, and the  upper portion is of finer material; the two parts are spliced together.        Sedge Straws.      Kinds of Sedges.      Botanical.    The sedges which form the family of Cyperaceae are grass-like or  rush-like herbs, with solid, jointless, usually triangular stems,  while the grasses (Gramineae) are mostly herbs, usually with hollow  stems closed and enlarged at the nodes. The former play an important  part in the manufacture of mats because of their length and freedom  from nodes. The family includes several genera of importance; viz.,  Scirpus, Cyperus, and Fimbristylis.    Of these the Fimbristylis is the most important, for two species of  Fimbristylis have a fairly large commercial use; they are therefore  taken up separately.    Of the genus Scirpus, the species S. grossus, known as \"balangot\" in  Ambos Camarines and Capiz, \"bagaas\" in Occidental Negros, \"tiquio\"  in Rizal, and \"bagui-bagui\" in Capiz, and S. erectus, are used for  mats. S. grossus is not a very suitable material for industrial  purposes, its distinctly three-cornered stalk being too coarse  in texture and too large to permit of weaving even a fair grade  article. S. erectus is much better. The stalk is about as fine as  tikug and grows to a height of 60 cm. The flowers sometimes occur in  a solitary cluster, but more often from 2 to 5 clusters of spikelets  are found on the side of the stalk near its top. The plant is widely  distributed in the Philippines and inhabits open grass lands. It bears  some flowers throughout the year. As yet only coarse mats are made  from it, but its general appearance would warrant experiments along  the lines of the processes by which tikug is treated. The only native  names noted are \"tayoc-tayoc\" and \"tikug\" by which names the plant is  known in Occidental Negros. These names, however, are more properly  applied to other plants. Scirpus mucronatus is somewhat like S. erectus  in general appearance. The stem of S. mucronatus is more robust and  coarser in texture and attains a height of 80 cm. Its dried stem has  an average width of 4 to 5 mm., while that of S. erectus measures  from 2 to 3 mm. The flowers of S. mucronatus appear in a very dense  head on the side of the plant from 2 to 9 cm. from the top. Each head  is made up of from 5 to 20 spikelets. These spikelets are from 6 to  15 mm. long, while those of S. erectus are never more than 1 cm. in  length. The coarser stalk of S. mucronatus makes it a less desirable  mat material than S. erectus. In the Ilocos provinces a very coarse  round sedge called tiker (Scirpus lacustris) occurs. It may be of value  if split and dried in the sun so that it curls up into a round straw.    The genus Cyperus includes a number of economic plants, among them  the Chinese matting sedge. The species most used in the Philippines  is C. malaccensis. This plant has an underground stem which, as it  continues its growth, sends out new stalks. The plant lives for  a number of years and when fully grown is from 0.5 to 1.5 meters  high. The stem is stout and three-sided in shape. It has few or no  leaves, and when present the leaves are not more than 3 cm. long. From  2 to 5 leaf-like stems (bracts) not more than 20 cm. long occur under  the inflorescence. The spikelets which make up the inflorescence  are somewhat crowded together; they are very narrow, from 1 to 2  cm. long. The plant occurs in the Philippines in brackish swamps  and along tidal streams. It is also found in tropical Africa, Asia,  the islands of Polynesia, and Australia. It is usually in flower  from July to December. It was formerly made into mats and hats and  is even now utilized in rare instances in weaving them, but it is  most important as a material for slippers, and possibly for matting.    Of the 125 species of Fimbristylis found only in warm regions, two are  of economic importance in the Philippines, while one more might perhaps  be tried out as a mat material. All the species of Fimbristylis have  tufted, fibrous or woody stems. The leaves occur near the base. The  inflorescence consists of a great number of flowers grouped closely  together to form one or more spikelets. The spikelets themselves may  be either solitary or clustered. The individual flowers are covered  by glumes and are arranged spirally on the axis. As the fruit matures,  the glumes of the flowers become the \"chaff\" of the grain.        Tikug.    This sedge (Fimbristylis utilis) grows usually more than a meter  long and has tufted stems which are shiny and smooth"]]]
