Selander and Baker (1957:345) list  Saltillo, Sabinas, and Monclova as the three known localities for this  swallow in the State.    *_Progne subis subis_ (Linnaeus).--Miller, Friedmann, Griscom, and  Moore (1957:107) reported, presumably on the basis of a published  record not found by me, that the Purple Martin breeds in Coahuila.    **_Progne chalybea chalybea_ (Gmelin).--The only record of the  Gray-breasted Martin in Coahuila was given by Ridgway (1904:42) when he  listed _P. c. chalybea_ from Sabinas.    **_Cyanocitta stelleri macrolopha_ Baird.--_Specimens examined:_ total  2: [Male] 32788 and [Female] 32787 from 13 mi. E San Antonio de las  Alazanas, 9950 ft., July 6, 1955.    From the paucity of records in the literature, I judge that Steller's  Jay is uncommon in Coahuila. Nos. 32787-32788 seemingly represent the  first records of this species in the State, and are referred to the  subspecies _macrolopha_ on the basis of relatively long (150, 151 mm.)  wing, near the maximum for _stelleri_ from Mexico. The date (July 6) of  collection suggests that these birds were resident in southeastern  Coahuila.    **_Aphelocoma coerulescens cyanotis_ Ridgway.--The Scrub Jay is common  in southeastern Coahuila. Burleigh and Lowery (1942:196) noted this  species in small numbers at the summit of Diamante Pass, daily on the  lower slopes of the mountains, and a few birds \"on the outskirts of  Saltillo, where they were probably nesting....\" Sutton and Burleigh  (1939a:35) also noted several flocks at Diamante Pass. Miller,  Friedmann, Griscom, and Moore (1957:123) reported _A. c. cyanotis_ from  El Diamante. Ridgway (1904:335) listed this subspecies of the Scrub Jay  (then called _Aphelocoma cyanotis_) from Carneros, Sierra Encarnacion,  and Sierra Guadalupe.    *_Aphelocoma ultramarina couchii_ (Baird).--_Specimens examined:_ total  14: [Female] 31051 from Sierra de la Encantada (=38 mi. S, 23 mi. E  Boquillas), 4400 ft., March 15, 1952; [Male] [Male] 29425-29426 and  [Female] [Female] 29427-29428 from Club Sierra del Carmen (=2 mi. N, 6  mi. W Piedra Blanca), 4950 ft., April 8, 1950; sex ? 31052 (skeleton  only) from 4 mi. W Hacienda La Mariposa, 2300 ft., March 25, 1952;  [Female] [Female] 31635-31636 from Canyon de Parazos in the Sierra de  la Parazos Azula (=9 mi. E Hermanas), 2100 ft., December 7, 1953;  [Female] 32082 from 4 mi. N, 21 mi. W Cuatro Cienegas, 6200 ft., July  3, 1952; [Female] 31053 (skeleton only) from 26 mi. W Santa Teresa,  7050 ft., April 5, 1952; [Male] 32081 from 7 mi. S, 4 mi. E Bella  Union, 7200 ft., June 25, 1952; [Female] 33173 (skeleton only) from 13  mi. E San Antonio de las Alazanas, 9950 ft., July 6, 1955; [Male] 31607  from 13 mi. E, 3 mi. S San Antonio de las Alazanas, 8900 ft., January  11, 1954; and [Male] 31654 from Sierra Guadalupe (=10 mi. S, 5 mi. W  General Cepeda), 7000 ft., April 13, 1953.    The Mexican Jay is common in Coahuila. This species occupies various  habitats in the State and has been collected at stations ranging from  2100 to 9950 feet.    Miller (1955a:167) stated that the Mexican Jay was the most abundant  species of bird in the Sierra del Carmen. Burleigh and Lowery  (1942:196) remarked that specimens of _A. u. couchii_ were obtained \"in  the area surrounding the summit of Diamante Pass.\" At no time did  Burleigh and Lowery (_loc. cit._) see this species below 6500 feet. The  Mexican Jay is restricted to the higher altitudes in southern Coahuila  but is more widespread in northern Coahuila. Dickerman saw Mexican Jays  in the Sierra del Pino on May 12, 1954; 16 mi. E and 18 mi. N Ocampo on  May 7, 1954; in the Sierra de la Madera on December 13, 1953; and 20  mi. S Ocampo on April 4, 1954.    Ridgway (1904:340) remarked that _Aphelocoma sieberii potosina_ Nelson  [=_A. u. couchii_ (Baird)] has been recorded in southern Coahuila, at  Carneros. Miller, Friedmann, Griscom, and Moore (1957:124) recorded _A.  u. couchii_ from Carneros, Nuevo Leon. I suspect (Ridgway, 1904:340 and  Goldman, 1951: map opposite p. 34) that the locality given by Miller,  Friedmann, Griscom, and Moore (_op. cit._) should be Carneros,  Coahuila, rather than Carneros, Nuevo Leon.    Specimens (31051, 29425-29428, 31635-31636, 32081-32082, 31607, and  31654) of the Mexican Jay increase in size from northern Coahuila to  southern Coahuila. The average length of the wings of Nos. 29425-29426  from Club Sierra del Carmen is 152 mm. whereas the average length of  the wings of No. 32081 from 7 mi. S and 4 mi. E Bella Union, of No.  31607 from 13 mi. E and 3 mi. S San Antonio de las Alazanas, and of No.  31654 from Sierra Guadalupe is 164 mm.    Miller (1955a:169) indicated that the Mexican Jay breeds in the Sierra  del Carmen. Burleigh and Lowery (1942:196) remarked that the species  breeds at Diamante Pass. The sizes of the testes (12, 11 mm.) of Nos.  29425-29426, the size of the ovum (8 mm.) of No. 29428, and the short  tail (126 mm.) of the immature female from 4 mi. N and 21 mi. W Cuatro  Cienegas are also evidence of breeding by this species in the State.    *_Corvus corax sinuatus_ Wagler.--The Common Raven seems to occur in  low density in Coahuila. Miller (1955a:168) saw ravens in the pine-oak  and cliff areas of the Sierra del Carmen, and took a breeding female at  the head of Corte Madera Canyon, 7500 feet. Burleigh and Lowery  (1942:196) found this species to be a bird of the higher slopes of the  mountains although not uncommon in the broad open valley south of  Diamante Pass. Sutton and Burleigh (1939a:35) took a male at Santa  Rosa.    *_Corvus cryptoleucus_ Couch.--_Specimens examined:_ total 4: [Male]  32080 from 2 mi. W Jimenez, 850 ft., June 20, 1952; [Female] 35404  (skeleton only) from 4 mi. N San Isidro (=16 mi. N Ocampo), May 10,  1954; and [Male] [Male] 31474-31475 from R. de Almendarez (=53 mi. NW  Ocampo), May 11, 1954.    The White-necked Raven occurs throughout Coahuila. Sutton and Burleigh  (1939a:36) observed this species \"in the vicinity of Saltillo,\" but not  farther west. Burleigh and Lowery (1942:197) noted _C. cryptoleucus_  frequently \"on the arid plateau around Saltillo\" and obtained a  specimen \"in the high fertile valley south of Diamante Pass.\" Burleigh  and Lowery (_loc. cit._) remarked that the White-necked Raven avoids  the mountain slopes; 7000 feet was the uppermost limit of occurrence.  The sizes of the testes (32080, 20 mm.; 31474: left, 12x20 mm., right,  10x16 mm.; and 31475: left, 10x16 mm., right, 10x14 mm.) of the  specimens that I have examined and the dates (May 11, June 20) on which  they were collected indicate breeding by the White-necked Raven in  Coahuila.    *_Parus sclateri eidos_ (Peters).--_Specimens examined:_ total 4:  [Female] 32083 from 7 mi. S, 4 mi. E Bella Union, 7200 ft., June 25,  1952; [Male] 31609 from 2 mi. E Mesa de Tablas, 9000 ft., January 15,  1954; [Male] 31656 and [Female] 31655 from the north slope of Sierra  Guadalupe (=11 mi. S, 7 mi. W General Cepeda), 7800 ft., April 20, 1953.    The Mexican Chickadee is common in southeastern Coahuila. Miller,  Friedmann, Griscom, and Moore (1957:133) stated that _P. s. eidos_ and  _P. s. sclateri_ intergrade in southern Coahuila. The specimens that I  have examined also show signs of intergradation, but are closer to _P.  s. eidos_.    Sutton and Burleigh (1939a:36) reported taking specimens of _P. s.  eidos_ at Diamante Pass where they saw several individuals. Burleigh  and Lowery (1942:197) also observed these chickadees \"in the pine woods  about the summit of Diamante Pass....\" The size of the testes (6x5 mm.)  of No. 31656 and the fact that No. 31655 was incubating eggs at the  time it was obtained are evidence of breeding by this chickadee in the  State.    **_Parus sclateri sclateri_ Kleinschmidt.--Miller, Friedmann, Griscom,  and Moore (1957:133) stated that a specimen (or specimens?) of _P. s.  sclateri_ which showed evidence of intergradation with _P. s. eidos_  was obtained at El Diamante.    **_Parus atricristatus dysleptus_ Van Tyne.--_Specimen examined:_ one,  [Male] 31054 from 37 mi. S, 21 mi. E Boquillas, 4100 ft., March 13,  1952.    Two subspecies of the Black-crested Titmouse are present in Coahuila.  _P. a. dysleptus_ occurs in northwestern Coahuila. Miller (1955a:168)  stated that the Black-crested Titmouse, identified as _dysleptus_, was  the only representative of the genus _Parus_ in the Sierra del Carmen.  The weak extension of black onto the nape in No. 31054 suggests  intergradation between _P. a. dysleptus_ and _P. a. atricristatus_; the  latter lacks the black nape of _dysleptus_.    *_Parus atricristatus atricristatus_ Cassin.--_Specimens examined:_  total 4: [Female] 32084 from 12 mi. N, 12 mi. W Jimenez, 850 ft., June  19, 1952; sex ? 32085 from 2 mi. W Jimenez, 850 ft., June 20, 1952;  [Female] 31055 (skeleton only) from Fortin (=33 mi. N, 1 mi. E San  Geronimo), 3300 ft., on March 29, 1952; and [Female] 35399 (skeleton  only) from 3.5 mi. W, 22 mi. S Ocampo, December 15, 1953, weight, 16  gms.    Typical _P. a. atricristatus_ occurs in Coahuila in the southeastern  sector (Dixon, 1955:184). Black-crested Titmice intermediate between  _atricristatus_ and _dysleptus_ were listed from Cuidad Muzquiz and  Sabinas by Dixon (_loc. cit._:189), as _dysleptus_ but were shown on  his map (_loc. cit._:184) as _atricristatus_. Our Nos. 32084 and 32085  (wing, 71, 71, tail, 63, 64 mm.) are small and fall in the upper range  of size for _atricristatus_ to which the specimens are here referred.    *_Auriparus flaviceps ornatus_ (Lawrence).--_Specimen examined:_ one,  [Male] 31056, from Sierra de la Encantada (=38 mi. S, 23 mi. E  Boquillas), 4400 ft., March 15, 1952.    The Verdin occurs up to about 5000 feet in Coahuila. Miller (1955a:168)  reported that \"this desert species followed the catclaw scrub up the  washes to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26113"],[0,"Handbook of Wool Knitting and Crochet (#12)"],[1,"way, missing every 2d stitch in 1st row  to draw in the cuff a little. Sew on pearl buttons to match the  buttonholes.    Cap: Chain 5, join to form a ring.    1. Chain 3, (yarn over hook, insert hook in ring, take up yarn and draw  through) twice, yarn over and draw through all the loops on needle,  chain 1 to close the \"bean,\" make 6 more bean-stitches in ring, and join  to top of 1st.    2. Chain 3, and make a bean in top of each of last row, and between each  2; join.    3. Chain 3, a bean-stitch between each 2 of last row, widening every 3d  or 4th by making a bean in top of bean.    4, 5. Same as 3d row, widening every 5th bean, or as necessary in order  to keep the shape.    Make 5 more rows without widening, which completes the body of cap.    For the border, turn cap wrong side out and tie in the blue yarn,  working on the wrong side to form the band so that it will turn up on  the right side.    1. Chain 3, draw a loop through 2d and 3d stitches from hook, also  through next 2 stitches of last row of cap, * take up wool and draw  through all the stitches on needle, chain 1 to close the star, draw up a  loop through eye of star last made, under the 1 chain, another through  back part of last loop of preceding star, and 2 loops in next 2  stitches; repeat from *, and continue until you have made 4 rows of  star-stitch. Fasten off neatly.    Make a tassel of the colored (blue) yarn, and attach to top of cap by a  crocheted cord.    This set will make a charming gift for a little girl. By using fourfold  Germantown the sweater will be large enough for the small mother herself  to wear, or it may be easily enlarged by using the heavier wool and  working in the same pattern on a longer foundation-chain. The cap may  also be made large enough for a child by adding to the number of  bean-stitches in each row.          Child's Cap in Bean-Stitch      [Illustration: Child's Cap in Bean-Stitch]    Materials required are one skein of cream-white Shetland floss and a  little light-blue Saxony yarn, with medium-sized bone hook. Chain 5,  join.    1. Draw up loop one-fourth inch long, yarn over, hook in ring, draw loop  through, over and draw through 3 loops now on needle, * chain 1, draw up  a loop in ring, over, draw up another loop in ring, over, draw through  all 4 loops; repeat to make 4 more bean-stitches, 6 in all, with 1 chain  between, and join last 1 chain to top of 1st stitch.    2. Draw loop up long over 1st bean-stitch, over, hook through same  stitch, draw through, over and draw through all the loops; this is 1st  stitch of each row. Chain 1, a bean-stitch in following space, chain 1,  bean-stitch in bean-stitch; repeat around, join.    3. Bean-stitch in 1st stitch, in each space and every 3d bean-stitch,  with 1 chain between, join.    4. Same as 3d row, with bean-stitch over every 4th bean-stitch.    5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. Same as 4th row, with an additional space between  widenings; in 5th row make a bean-stitch in every 5th, and so on, with  bean-stitch in every 10th, in 10th row.    11, 12, 13. Bean-stitch in each space.    14. Change to double crochet for head-band, making a double in each  stitch.    15, 16, 17, 18, 19. A double in each double, working in both veins of  stitch; narrow twice in each row.    20, 21. Double in each double.    22. A bean-stitch in each 2d double, 1 chain between.    23, 24, 25, 26, 27. Bean-stitch in each space; fasten off white yarn.    28. Fasten blue yarn in space, chain 4, draw up a loop in 2d chain from  hook, 1 in 3d and 1 in 4th, all rather long loops, over, draw through  all 4 loops, chain 1, fasten in next space with a single, and repeat.  This makes a small, pointed scallop and finishes edge of cap.    For the button: Using the blue yarn, chain 3, 8 doubles in 2d stitch of  chain. Continue around and around without joining, 1st row with 2  doubles in each stitch, then widen sufficiently to keep the work flat  until nearly as large as the button you wish to cover; after one or two  more rounds, decrease by working off 3 loops instead of 2, slip the  button in and continue, keeping the work tight over the button until you  have about half of space covered; then break the yarn, draw up with  needle and sew to center of crown.    This cap is large enough for a little boy or girl of three years, and  may be easily enlarged. The border may be turned down over the ears for  extra warmth.          Child's Crocheted Hood      [Illustration: Child's Crocheted Hood]    Use eiderdown or very heavy Germantown worsted, with a hook large enough  to carry the wool without fraying. Chain 4 stitches, join.    1. Chain 3, draw a loop through 2d and 3d stitches of chain, and 2  through the ring; take up wool and work off all together, chain 1 to  close the star, draw a loop through eye of star (under 1 chain just  made), another through back part of last loop, and 2 in ring; work off  as before, and repeat until you have made 6 stars; join.    2. Make 12 stars in the row, taking the 4th loop of each star in same  stitch with last stitch of preceding star, and 5th in stitch ahead, so  that you get 2 stars over each star of preceding row.    3. Make 16 stars, widening 4 times.    4, 5, 6. Leave 4 stars for back of neck and work back and forth for 3  rows. Break wool at end of each row and fasten in at beginning, so the  stars will come on the right side; chain 3, draw 2 loops through 2d and  3d stitches of chain, then proceed as usual.    Make 4 rows of doubles around the lower edge, then a row of stars  entirely around the hood, widening by putting an extra star at each  corner of front to prevent drawing.    For the rosette: Chain 3, join; chain 7, * a double treble in ring,  chain 3, repeat from * 6 times, and join to 4th of 7 chain. Run ribbon  in and out the spaces, sew the rosette in place, and finish with ties of  ribbon.    This hood is easily enlarged, by following general directions, and any  stitch, plain or fancy, may be used for it.          Child's Crocheted Hood in Wedge-Stitch      [Illustration: Child's Crocheted Hood in Wedge-Stitch]    Materials required are one and one-half hanks of 4-fold Germantown wool,  white, or any preferred color, and a bone crochet-hook of medium size.  While intended for a small child, this hood may be very easily enlarged  to fit any head.    Chain 4 stitches with white wool, join.    1. Chain 3 for a treble, 19 trebles in ring, join.    2. Draw up a loop, insert hook in 1st stitch, * wool over, draw up a  loop, wool over, hook in next stitch, over, draw up a loop, wool over,  draw through all the loops on hook, chain 1, insert hook in same stitch,  and repeat from * until there are 19 wedge-stitches in the round.    3. Draw up loop, insert hook in 1st space, draw up a loop, over, insert  hook in next space, draw up a loop, over, draw through all loops on the  needle, chain 1, * insert hook in same space, draw up a loop, over,  insert hook in next space, draw up a loop, over, draw through all  stitches on needle, chain 1, and repeat, widening by putting 2 stitches  in every 3d of previous round.    4. Widen in every 5th stitch.    5. Plain, that is, without widening.    6. Widen every 3d stitch.    7, 8, 9. Plain.    10. Plain to within 7 stitches of the end; break wool and fasten in at  other end again.    11, 12, 13, 14, 15. Same as 10th row, leaving the 7 stitches for back of  neck.    16. Fasten in, chain 3, and work a treble in every stitch. It is very  pretty to use a thread of ice-wool with the Germantown when making the  border.    17, 18. A double in each stitch around bottom or neck of hood.    19, 20, 21, 22, 23. A double in each stitch across front, working in  both veins of stitch.    Turn back the border, finish with a bow of ribbon at back, a rosette on  top, and ribbon ties.    To make the hood larger you have but to continue widening the crown  until of proper size, which will make the front proportionally longer  and leave the neck wider. Any fancy stitch may be used in the same way,  following the general directions given.          Child's Toque in Wedge-Stitch      [Illustration: Child's Toque in Wedge-Stitch]    This pretty cap, which will fit a girl of ten to fourteen years, and is  easily enlarged to any desired size, requires five hanks of  eiderdown-wool. If desired, two colors may be used, say white for cap  and blue for the turnover or border. It is worked in wedge-stitch, and  Germantown wool may be used by making more stitches. Use a bone hook of  suitable size, that is, one which will carry the wool easily without  catching in it. Make a chain of 4 stitches and join.    1. Draw out the loop, insert hook in ring, draw up a loop, wool over,  insert hook in ring, draw up another loop, wool over, draw through all  the loops on needle, chain 1, and repeat until you have 11  wedge-stitches in the ring; join.    2. Draw up loop, insert hook in 1st space, draw up a loop, wool over,  hook in next space, draw up a loop, wool over, draw through all loops on  needle, chain 1, * hook in same space, draw up a loop, wool over, hook  in next space, draw up a loop, wool over, draw through all on hook,  chain 1, and repeat from *, widening by making an extra stitch in every  other stitch of last round.    3. Widen in every 3d stitch.    4. Widen in every 6th stitch.    Work six times around plain, that is, without widening; then if color is  used for the turnover join it in and work once around, turn the work so  that the border will be right side out when turned up, and work around  five times more. Make a chain of 18 or 20 stitches, according to length  you wish the tassel, wind the wool over four fingers, or a card five  inches wide, 20 times, slip off, tie tightly near one end to form the  head of tassel, and cut open the other end.           *       *       *       *       *    NEEDLECRAFT pictures each month new and beautiful pieces of  needlework--knitting, crochet, including the exclusive Mary Card  designs, "]]]
