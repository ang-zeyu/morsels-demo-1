[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35829"],[0,"The 2009 CIA World Factbook (#12)"],[1,"names in the Factbook normally follows  the same transliteration system used by the US Board on Geographic  Names for spelling place names. At times, however, a foreign leader  expressly indicates a preference for, or the media or official  documents regularly use, a romanized spelling that differs from the  transliteration derived from the US Government standard. In such  cases, the Factbook uses the alternative spelling.      Personal Names - Titles    The Factbook capitalizes any valid title (or short form of it)  immediately preceding a person's name. A title standing alone is not  capitalized. Examples: President PUTIN and President BUSH are chiefs  of state. In Russia, the president is chief of state and the premier  is the head of the government, while in the US, the president is  both chief of state and head of government.      Petroleum    See entries under Oil.      Petroleum products    See entries under Oil.    Pipelines    This entry gives the lengths and types of pipelines for transporting  products like natural gas, crude oil, or petroleum products.      Piracy    Piracy is defined by the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law  of the Sea as any illegal act of violence, detention, or depredation  directed against a ship, aircraft, persons, or property in a place  outside the jurisdiction of any State. Such criminal acts committed  in the territorial waters of a littoral state are generally  considered to be armed robbery against ships.    Political parties and leaders    This entry includes a listing of significant political organizations  and their leaders.    Political pressure groups and leaders    This entry includes a listing of a country's political, social,  labor, or religious organizations that are involved in politics, or  that exert political pressure, but whose leaders do not stand for  legislative election. International movements or organizations are  generally not listed.    Population    This entry gives an estimate from the US Bureau of the Census based  on statistics from population censuses, vital statistics  registration systems, or sample surveys pertaining to the recent  past and on assumptions about future trends. The total population  presents one overall measure of the potential impact of the country  on the world and within its region. Note: Starting with the 1993  Factbook, demographic estimates for some countries (mostly African)  have explicitly taken into account the effects of the growing impact  of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. These countries are currently: The  Bahamas, Benin, Botswana, Brazil, Burkina Faso, Burma, Burundi,  Cambodia, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of  the Congo, Republic of the Congo, Cote d'Ivoire, Ethiopia, Gabon,  Ghana, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique,  Namibia, Nigeria, Rwanda, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania,  Thailand, Togo, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.    Population growth rate    The average annual percent change in the population, resulting from  a surplus (or deficit) of births over deaths and the balance of  migrants entering and leaving a country. The rate may be positive or  negative. The growth rate is a factor in determining how great a  burden would be imposed on a country by the changing needs of its  people for infrastructure (e.g., schools, hospitals, housing,  roads), resources (e.g., food, water, electricity), and jobs. Rapid  population growth can be seen as threatening by neighboring  countries.    Ports and terminals    This entry lists major ports and terminals primarily on the basis of  the amount of cargo tonnage shipped through the facilities on an  annual basis. In some instances, the number of containers handled or  ship visits were also considered.    Public debt    This entry records the cumulative total of all government borrowings  less repayments that are denominated in a country's home currency.  Public debt should not be confused with external debt, which  reflects the foreign currency liabilities of both the private and  public sector and must be financed out of foreign exchange earnings.    R        Radio broadcast stations    This entry includes the total number of AM, FM, and shortwave  broadcast stations.    Railways    This entry states the total route length of the railway network and  of its component parts by gauge: broad, standard, narrow, and dual.  Other gauges are listed under note.      Reference maps    This section includes world and regional maps.    Refugees and internally displaced persons    This entry includes those persons residing in a country as refugees  or internally displaced persons (IDPs). The definition of a refugee  according to a United Nations Convention is \"a person who is outside  his/her country of nationality or habitual residence; has a  well-founded fear of persecution because of his/her race, religion,  nationality, membership in a particular social group or political  opinion; and is unable or unwilling to avail himself/herself of the  protection of that country, or to return there, for fear of  persecution.\" The UN established the Office of the UN High  Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in 1950 to handle refugee matters  worldwide. The UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in  the Near East (UNRWA) has a different operational definition for a  Palestinian refugee: \"a person whose normal place of residence was  Palestine during the period 1 June 1946 to 15 May 1948 and who lost  both home and means of livelihood as a result of the 1948 conflict.\"  However, UNHCR also assists some 400,000 Palestinian refugees not  covered under the UNRWA definition. The term \"internally displaced  person\" is not specifically covered in the UN Convention; it is used  to describe people who have fled their homes for reasons similar to  refugees, but who remain within their own national territory and are  subject to the laws of that state.    Religions    This entry is an ordered listing of religions by adherents starting  with the largest group and sometimes includes the percent of total  population. The core characteristics and beliefs of the world's  major religions are described below.  Baha'i - Founded by Mirza Husayn-Ali (known as Baha'u'llah) in Iran  in 1852, Baha'i faith emphasizes monotheism and believes in one  eternal transcendent God. Its guiding focus is to encourage the  unity of all peoples on the earth so that justice and peace may be  achieved on earth. Baha'i revelation contends the prophets of major  world religions reflect some truth or element of the divine,  believes all were manifestations of God given to specific  communities in specific times, and that Baha'u'llah is an additional  prophet meant to call all humankind. Bahais are an open community,  located worldwide, with the greatest concentration of believers in  South Asia.  Buddhism - Religion or philosophy inspired by the 5th century B.C.  teachings of Siddhartha Gautama (also known as Gautama Buddha \"the  enlightened one\"). Buddhism focuses on the goal of spiritual  enlightenment centered on an understanding of Gautama Buddha's Four  Noble Truths on the nature of suffering, and on the Eightfold Path  of spiritual and moral practice, to break the cycle of suffering of  which we are a part. Buddhism ascribes to a karmic system of  rebirth. Several schools and sects of Buddhism exist, differing  often on the nature of the Buddha, the extent to which enlightenment  can be achieved - for one or for all, and by whom - religious orders  or laity.  Basic Groupings     Theravada Buddhism: The oldest Buddhist school, Theravada is  practiced mostly in Sri Lanka, Cambodia, Laos, Burma, and Thailand,  with minority representation elsewhere in Asia and the West.  Theravadans follow the Pali Canon of Buddha's teachings, and believe  that one may escape the cycle of rebirth, worldly attachment, and  suffering for oneself; this process may take one or several  lifetimes.     Mahayana Buddhism, including subsets Zen and Tibetan Buddhism:  Forms of Mahayana Buddhism are common in East Asia and Tibet, and  parts of the West. Mahayanas have additional scriptures beyond the  Pali Canon and believe the Buddha is eternal and still teaching.  Unlike Theravada Buddhism, Mahayana schools maintain the  Buddha-nature is present in all beings and all will ultimately  achieve enlightenment.  Christianity - Descending from Judaism, Christianity's central  belief maintains Jesus of Nazareth is the promised messiah of the  Hebrew Scriptures, and that his life, death, and resurrection are  salvific for the world. Christianity is one of the three  monotheistic Abrahamic faiths, along with Islam and Judaism, which  traces its spiritual lineage to Abraham of the Hebrew Scriptures.  Its sacred texts include the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament (or  the Christian Gospels).  Basic Groupings     Catholicism (or Roman Catholicism): This is the oldest  established western Christian church and the world's largest single  religious body. It is supranational, and recognizes a hierarchical  structure with the Pope, or Bishop of Rome, as its head, located at  the Vatican. Catholics believe the Pope is the divinely ordered head  of the Church from a direct spiritual legacy of Jesus' apostle  Peter. Catholicism is comprised of 23 particular Churches, or Rites  - one Western (Latin-Rite) and 22 Eastern. The Latin Rite is by far  the largest, making up about 98% of Catholic membership.  Eastern-Rite Churches, such as the Maronite Church and the Ukrainian  Catholic Church, are in communion with Rome although they preserve  their own worship traditions and their immediate hierarchy consists  of clergy within their own rite. The Catholic Church has a  comprehensive theological and moral doctrine specified for believers  in its catechism, which makes it unique among most forms of  Christianity.     Mormonism (including the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day  Saints): Originating in 1830 "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35830"],[0,"The 2010 CIA World Factbook (#12)"],[1,"the first to attempt to  reduce Roman-Dutch civil law into a system in his Jurisprudence of  Holland (written 1619-20, commentary published 1621). The Dutch  historian/lawyer Simon van Leeuwen coined the term \"Roman-Dutch law\"  in 1652.  Spanish Law - A type of civil law, often referred to as the Spanish  Civil Code, it is the present legal system of Spain and is the basis  of legal systems in 12 countries mostly in Central and South  America, but also in southwestern Europe, northern and western  Africa, and southeastern Asia. The Spanish Civil Code reflects a  complex mixture of customary, Roman, Napoleonic, local, and modern  codified law. The laws of the Visigoth invaders of Spain in the 5th  to 7th centuries had the earliest major influence on Spanish legal  system development. The Christian Reconquest of Spain in the 11th  through 15th centuries witnessed the development of customary law,  which combined canon (religious) and Roman law. During several  centuries of Hapsburg and Bourbon rule, systematic recompilations of  the existing national legal system were attempted, but these often  conflicted with local and regional customary civil laws. Legal  system development for most of the 19th century concentrated on  formulating a national civil law system, which was finally enacted  in 1889 as the Spanish Civil Code. Several sections of the code have  been revised, the most recent of which are the penal code in 1989  and the judiciary code in 2001. The Spanish Civil Code separates  public and private law. Public law includes constitutional law,  administrative law, criminal law, process law, financial and tax  law, and international public law. Private law includes civil law,  commercial law, labor law, and international private law.  United States Law - A type of common law, which is the basis of the  legal system of the United States and that of its island possessions  in the Caribbean and the Pacific. This legal system has several  layers, more possibly than in most other countries, and is due in  part to the division between federal and state law. The United  States was founded not as one nation but as a union of 13 colonies,  each claiming independence from the British Crown. The US  Constitution, implemented in 1789, began shifting power away from  the states and toward the federal government, though the states  today retain substantial legal authority. US law draws its authority  from four sources: constitutional law, statutory law, administrative  regulations, and case law. Constitutional law is based on the US  Constitution and serves as the supreme federal law. Taken together  with those of the state constitutions, these documents outline the  general structure of the federal and state governments and provide  the rules and limits of power. US statutory law is legislation  enacted by the US Congress and is codified in the United States  Code. The 50 state legislatures have similar authority to enact  state statutes. Administrative law is the authority delegated to  federal and state executive agencies. Case law, also referred to as  common law, covers areas where constitutional or statutory law is  lacking. Case law is a collection of judicial decisions, customs,  and general principles that began in England centuries ago, that  were adopted in America at the time of the Revolution, and that  continue to develop today.        Legislative branch      This entry contains information on the structure (unicameral,  bicameral, tricameral), formal name, number of seats, and term of  office. Elections includes the nature of the election process or  accession to power, date of the last election, and date of the next  election. Election results includes the percent of vote and/or  number of seats held by each party in the last election.        Life expectancy at birth      This entry contains the average number of years to be lived by a  group of people born in the same year, if mortality at each age  remains constant in the future. The entry includes total population  as well as the male and female components. Life expectancy at birth  is also a measure of overall quality of life in a country and  summarizes the mortality at all ages. It can also be thought of as  indicating the potential return on investment in human capital and  is necessary for the calculation of various actuarial measures.        Literacy      This entry includes a definition of literacy and Census Bureau  percentages for the total population, males, and females. There are  no universal definitions and standards of literacy. Unless otherwise  specified, all rates are based on the most common definition - the  ability to read and write at a specified age. Detailing the  standards that individual countries use to assess the ability to  read and write is beyond the scope of the Factbook. Information on  literacy, while not a perfect measure of educational results, is  probably the most easily available and valid for international  comparisons. Low levels of literacy, and education in general, can  impede the economic development of a country in the current rapidly  changing, technology-driven world.        Location      This entry identifies the country's regional location, neighboring  countries, and adjacent bodies of water.        M          Major infectious diseases      This entry lists major infectious diseases likely to be encountered  in countries where the risk of such diseases is assessed to be very  high as compared to the United States. These infectious diseases  represent risks to US government personnel traveling to the  specified country for a period of less than three years. The degree  of risk is assessed by considering the foreign nature of these  infectious diseases, their severity, and the probability of being  affected by the diseases present. The diseases listed do not  necessarily represent the total disease burden experienced by the  local population.  The risk to an individual traveler varies considerably by the  specific location, visit duration, type of activities, type of  accommodations, time of year, and other factors. Consultation with a  travel medicine physician is needed to evaluate individual risk and  recommend appropriate preventive measures such as vaccines.  Diseases are organized into the following six exposure categories  shown in italics and listed in typical descending order of risk.  Note: The sequence of exposure categories listed in individual  country entries may vary according to local conditions.  food or waterborne diseases acquired through eating or drinking on  the local economy:  Hepatitis A - viral disease that interferes with the functioning of  the liver; spread through consumption of food or water contaminated  with fecal matter, principally in areas of poor sanitation; victims  exhibit fever, jaundice, and diarrhea; 15% of victims will  experience prolonged symptoms over 6-9 months; vaccine available.  Hepatitis E - water-borne viral disease that interferes with the  functioning of the liver; most commonly spread through fecal  contamination of drinking water; victims exhibit jaundice, fatigue,  abdominal pain, and dark colored urine.  Typhoid fever - bacterial disease spread through contact with food  or water contaminated by fecal matter or sewage; victims exhibit  sustained high fevers; left untreated, mortality rates can reach 20%.  vectorborne diseases acquired through the bite of an infected  arthropod:  Malaria - caused by single-cell parasitic protozoa Plasmodium;  transmitted to humans via the bite of the female Anopheles mosquito;  parasites multiply in the liver attacking red blood cells resulting  in cycles of fever, chills, and sweats accompanied by anemia; death  due to damage to vital organs and interruption of blood supply to  the brain; endemic in 100, mostly tropical, countries with 90% of  cases and the majority of 1.5-2.5 million estimated annual deaths  occurring in sub-Saharan Africa.  Dengue fever - mosquito-borne (Aedes aegypti) viral disease  associated with urban environments; manifests as sudden onset of  fever and severe headache; occasionally produces shock and  hemorrhage leading to death in 5% of cases.  Yellow fever - mosquito-borne viral disease; severity ranges from  influenza-like symptoms to severe hepatitis and hemorrhagic fever;  occurs only in tropical South America and sub-Saharan Africa, where  most cases are reported; fatality rate is less than 20%.  Japanese Encephalitis - mosquito-borne (Culex tritaeniorhynchus)  viral disease associated with rural areas in Asia; acute  encephalitis can progress to paralysis, coma, and death; fatality  rates 30%.  African Trypanosomiasis - caused by the parasitic protozoa  Trypanosoma; transmitted to humans via the bite of bloodsucking  Tsetse flies; infection leads to malaise and irregular fevers and,  in advanced cases when the parasites invade the central nervous  system, coma and death; endemic in 36 countries of sub-Saharan  Africa; cattle and wild animals act as reservoir hosts for the  parasites.  Cutaneous Leishmaniasis - caused by the parasitic protozoa  leishmania; transmitted to humans via the bite of sandflies; results  in skin lesions that may become chronic; endemic in 88 countries;  90% of cases occur in Iran, Afghanistan, Syria, Saudi Arabia,  Brazil, and Peru; wild and domesticated animals as well as humans  can act as reservoirs of infection.  Plague - bacterial disease transmitted by fleas normally associated  with rats; person-to-person airborne transmission also possible;  recent plague epidemics occurred in areas of Asia, Africa, and South  America associated with rural areas or small towns and villages;  manifests as fever, headache, and painfully swollen lymph nodes;  disease progresses rapidly and without antibiotic treatment leads to  pneumonic form with a death rate in excess of 50%.  Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever - tick-borne viral disease;  infection may also result"]]]
