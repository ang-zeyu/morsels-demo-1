A problem that is     AI-complete is, in other words, just too hard.       Examples of AI-complete problems are `The Vision Problem' (building a     system that can see as well as a human) and `The Natural Language     Problem' (building a system that can understand and speak a natural     language as well as a human). These may appear to be modular, but all     attempts so far (1999) to solve them have foundered on the amount of     context information and `intelligence' they seem to require.

Derogatory term for IBM's perverted version of Unix, AIX, especially     for the AIX 3.? used in the IBM RS/6000 series (some hackers think it     is funnier just to pronounce \"AIX\" as \"aches\"). A victim of the     dreaded \"hybridism\" disease, this attempt to combine the two main     currents of the Unix stream ([420]BSD and [421]USG Unix) became a     [422]monstrosity to haunt system administrators' dreams. For example,     if new accounts are created while many users are logged on, the load     average jumps quickly over 20 due to silly implementation of the user     databases.

Typically this is created while debugging     user interface code. An example would be when there is a menu stating,     \"Select 1-3 or 9 to quit\" and 9 is not allowed by the function that     takes the selection from the user.       This term received its name from a programmer who had coded a modal     message box in MSAccess with no Ok or Cancel buttons, thereby     disabling the entire program whenever the box came up. The message box     had the proper code for dismissal and even was set up so that when the     non-existent Ok button was pressed the proper code would be called.       _________________________________________________________________       Node:aliasing bug, Next:[437]Alice and Bob, Previous:[438]Alderson     loop, Up:[439]= A =       aliasing bug n.       A class of subtle programming errors that can arise in code that does     dynamic allocation, esp. via malloc(3) or equivalent. If several     pointers address (`aliases for') a given hunk of storage, it may     happen that the storage is freed or reallocated (and thus moved)     through one alias and then referenced through another, which may lead     to subtle (and possibly intermittent) lossage depending on the state     and the allocation history of the malloc [440]arena. Avoidable by use     of allocation strategies that never alias allocated core, or by use of     higher-level languages, such as [441]LISP, which employ a garbage     collector (see [442]GC). Also called a [443]stale pointer bug. See     also [444]precedence lossage, [445]smash the stack, [446]fandango on     core, [447]memory leak, [448]memory smash, [449]overrun screw,     [450]spam.       Historical note: Though this term is nowadays associated with C     programming, it was already in use in a very similar sense in the     Algol-60 and FORTRAN communities in the 1960s.       _________________________________________________________________       Node:Alice and Bob, Next:[451]all-elbows, Previous:[452]aliasing bug,     Up:[453]= A =       Alice and Bob n.       The archetypal individuals used as examples in discussions of     cryptographic protocols. Originally, theorists would say something     like: \"A communicates with someone who claims to be B, So to be sure,     A tests that B knows a secret number K. So A sends to B a random     number X. B then forms Y by encrypting X under key K and sends Y back     to A\" Because this sort of thing is is quite hard to follow, theorists     stopped using the unadorned letters A and B to represent the main     players and started calling them Alice and Bob. So now we say \"Alice     communicates with someone claiming to be Bob, and to be sure, So Alice     tests that Bob knows a secret number K. Alice sends to Bob a random     number X. Bob then forms Y by encrypting X under key K and sends Y     back to Alice\". A whole mythology rapidly grew up around the     metasyntactic names; see     [454]http://www.conceptlabs.co.uk/alicebob.html.       In Bruce Schneier's definitive introductory text \"Applied     Cryptography\" (2nd ed., 1996, John Wiley & Sons, ISBN 0-471-11709-9)     he introduces a table of dramatis personae headed by Alice and Bob.     Others include Carol (a participant in three- and four-party     protocols), Dave (a participant in four-party protocols), Eve (an     eavesdropper), Mallory (a malicious active attacker), Trent (a trusted     arbitrator), Walter (a warden), Peggy (a prover) and Victor (a     verifier). These names for roles are either already standard or, given     the wide popularity of the book, may be expected to quickly become so.       _________________________________________________________________       Node:all-elbows, Next:[455]alpha geek, Previous:[456]Alice and Bob,     Up:[457]= A =       all-elbows adj.

PISTHETAERUS Ah, indeed! 'tis from that no doubt that we derive the word  'tribulation.'(1)      f(1) There is a similar pun in the Greek.    PROMETHEUS Most likely. But one thing I can tell you for certain,  namely, that Zeus and the celestial Triballi are going to send deputies  here to sue for peace. Now don't you treat, unless Zeus restores the  sceptre to the birds and gives you Basileia(1) in marriage.      f(1) i.e. the 'supremacy' of Greece, the real object of the war.    PISTHETAERUS Who is this Basileia?    PROMETHEUS A very fine young damsel, who makes the lightning for  Zeus; all things come from her, wisdom, good laws, virtue, the fleet,  calumnies, the public paymaster and the triobolus.    PISTHETAERUS Ah! then she is a sort of general manageress to the god.    PROMETHEUS Yes, precisely. If he gives you her for your wife, yours will  be the almighty power. That is what I have come to tell you; for you  know my constant and habitual goodwill towards men.    PISTHETAERUS Oh, yes! 'tis thanks to you that we roast our meat.(1)      f(1) Prometheus had stolen the fire from the gods to gratify mankind.    PROMETHEUS I hate the gods, as you know.    PISTHETAERUS Aye, by Zeus, you have always detested them.    PROMETHEUS Towards them I am a veritable Timon;(1) but I must return in  all haste, so give me the umbrella; if Zeus should see me from up there,  he would think I was escorting one of the Canephori.(2)      f(1) A celebrated misanthrope, contemporary to Aristophanes. Hating the  society of men, he had only a single friend, Apimantus, to whom he  was attached, because of their similarity of character; he also liked  Alcibiades, because he foresaw that this young man would be the ruin of  his country.    f(2) The Canephori were young maidens, chosen from the first families  of the city, who carried baskets wreathed with myrtle at the feast of  Athene, while at those of Bacchus and Demeter they appeared with gilded  baskets.--The daughters of 'Metics,' or resident aliens, walked behind  them, carrying an umbrella and a stool.    PISTHETAERUS Wait, take this stool as well.    CHORUS Near by the land of the Sciapodes(1) there is a marsh, from the  borders whereof the odious Socrates evokes the souls of men. Pisander(2)  came one day to see his soul, which he had left there when still alive.  He offered a little victim, a camel,(3) slit his throat and, following  the example of Ulysses, stepped one pace backwards.(4) Then that bat of  a Chaerephon(5) came up from hell to drink the camel's blood.      f(1) According to Ctesias, the Sciapodes were a people who dwelt on the  borders of the Atlantic. Their feet were larger than the rest of their  bodies, and to shield themselves from the sun's rays they held up one of  their feet as an umbrella.--By giving the Socratic philosophers the name  of Sciapodes here Aristophanes wishes to convey that they are walking in  the dark and busying themselves with the greatest nonsense.    f(2) This Pisander was a notorious coward; for this reason the poet  jestingly supposes that he had lost his soul, the seat of courage.    f(3) Considering the shape and height of the camel, (it) can certainly  not be included in the list of SMALL victims, e.g. the sheep and the  goat.    f(4) In the evocation of the dead, Book XI of the Odyssey.    f(5) Chaerephon was given this same title by the Herald earlier in this  comedy.--Aristophanes supposes him to have come from hell because he is  lean and pallid.    POSIDON(1) This is the city of Nephelococcygia, Cloud-cuckoo-town,  whither we come as ambassadors. (TO TRIBALLUS) Hi! what are you up to?  you are throwing your cloak over the left shoulder. Come, fling it quick  over the right! And why, pray, does it draggle in this fashion? Have  you ulcers to hide like Laespodias?(2) Oh! democracy!(3) whither, oh!  whither are you leading us? Is it possible that the gods have chosen  such an envoy?      f(1) Posidon appears on the stage accompanied by Heracles and a  Triballian god.    f(2) An Athenian general.--Neptune is trying to give Triballus some  notions of elegance and good behaviour.    f(3) Aristophanes supposes that democracy is in the ascendant in Olympus  as it is in Athens.    TRIBALLUS Leave me alone.    POSIDON Ugh! the cursed savage! you are by far the most barbarous of all  the gods.--Tell me, Heracles, what are we going to do?    HERACLES I have already told you that I want to strangle the fellow who  has dared to block us in.    POSIDON But, my friend, we are envoys of peace.    HERACLES All the more reason why I wish to strangle him.    PISTHETAERUS Hand me the cheese-grater; bring me the silphium for sauce;  pass me the cheese and watch the coals.(1)      f(1) He is addressing his servant, Manes.    HERACLES Mortal! we who greet you are three gods.    PISTHETAERUS Wait a bit till I have prepared my silphium pickle.    HERACLES What are these meats?(1)      f(1) Heracles softens at sight of the food.--Heracles is the glutton of  the comic poets.    PISTHETAERUS These are birds that have been punished with death for  attacking the people's friends.    HERACLES And you are seasoning them before answering us?    PISTHETAERUS Ah! Heracles! welcome, welcome! What's the matter?(1)      f(1) He pretends not to have seen them at first, being so much engaged  with his cookery.    HERACLES The gods have sent us here as ambassadors to treat for peace.    A SERVANT There's no more oil in the flask.    PISTHETAERUS And yet the birds must be thoroughly basted with it.(1)      f(1) He pretends to forget the presence of the ambassadors.    HERACLES We have no interest to serve in fighting you; as for you, be  friends and we promise that you shall always have rain-water in your  pools and the warmest of warm weather. So far as these points go we are  armed with plenary authority.    PISTHETAERUS We have never been the aggressors, and even now we are  as well disposed for peace as yourselves, provided you agree to one  equitable condition, namely, that Zeus yield his sceptre to the birds.  If only this is agreed to, I invite the ambassadors to dinner.    HERACLES That's good enough for me. I vote for peace.    POSIDON You wretch! you are nothing but a fool and a glutton. Do you  want to dethrone your own father?    PISTHETAERUS What an error! Why, the gods will be much more powerful if  the birds govern the earth. At present the mortals are hidden beneath  the clouds, escape your observation, and commit perjury in your name;  but if you had the birds for your allies, and a man, after having sworn  by the crow and Zeus, should fail to keep his oath, the crow would dive  down upon him unawares and pluck out his eye.    POSIDON Well thought of, by Posidon!(1)      f(1) Posidon jestingly swears by himself.    HERACLES My notion too.    PISTHETAERUS (TO THE TRIBALLIAN) And you, what's your opinion?    TRIBALLUS Nabaisatreu.(1)      f(1) The barbarian god utters some gibberish which Pisthetaerus  interprets into consent.    PISTHETAERUS D'you see? he also approves. But hear another thing in  which we can serve you. If a man vows to offer a sacrifice to some god,  and then procrastinates, pretending that the gods can wait, and thus  does not keep his word, we shall punish his stinginess.    POSIDON Ah! ah! and how?    PISTHETAERUS While he is counting his money or is in the bath, a kite  will relieve him, before he knows it, either in coin or in clothes, of  the value of a couple of sheep, and carry it to the god.    HERACLES I vote for restoring them the sceptre.    POSIDON Ask the Triballian.    HERACLES Hi Triballian, do you want a thrashing?    TRIBALLUS Saunaka baktarikrousa.    HERACLES He says, \"Right willingly.\"    POSIDON If that be the opinion of both of you, why, I consent too.    HERACLES Very well! we accord the sceptre.    PISTHETAERUS Ah! I was nearly forgetting another condition. I will leave  Here to Zeus, but only if the young Basileia is given me in marriage.    POSIDON Then you don't want peace. Let us withdraw.    PISTHETAERUS It matters mighty little to me. Cook, look to the gravy.    HERACLES What an odd fellow this Posidon is! Where are you off to? Are  we going to war about a woman?    POSIDON What else is there to do?    HERACLES What else? Why, conclude peace.    POSIDON Oh! you ninny! do you always want to be fooled? Why, you are  seeking your own downfall. If Zeus were to die, after having yielded  them the sovereignty, you would be ruined, for you are the heir of all  the wealth he will leave behind.    PISTHETAERUS Oh! by the gods! how he is cajoling you. Step aside, that  I may have a word with you. Your uncle is getting the better of you,  my poor friend.(1) The law will not allow you an obolus of the paternal  property, for you are a bastard and not a legitimate child.      f(1) Heracles, the god of strength, was far from being remarkable in the  way of cleverness.    HERACLES I a bastard! What's that you tell me?    PISTHETAERUS Why, certainly; are you not born of a stranger woman?  Besides, is not Athene recognized as Zeus' sole heiress? And no daughter  would be that, if she had a legitimate brother.    HERACLES But what if my father wished to give me his property on his  death-bed, even though I be a bastard?    PISTHETAERUS The law forbids it, and this same Posidon would be the  first to lay claim to his wealth, in virtue of being his legitimate  brother. Listen; thus runs Solon's law: \"A bastard shall not inherit, if  there are legitimate children; and if there are no legitimate children,  the property shall pass to the nearest kin.\"(1)      f(1) This was Athenian law.    HERACLES And I get nothing whatever of the paternal property?    PISTHETAERUS Absolutely nothing. But tell me, has your father had you  entered on the registers of his phratria?(1)      f(1)"]]]
