He might too have asked  Vasari, in what he considered grandeur and majesty of style to consist;  and from the example of the Greeks, and from reason herself, he might  have informed him, that the grand does not consist in the enlargement of  the muscles, or in an extravagance of attitude, but in adopting, as  Mengs has observed, the noblest, and neglecting the inferior and meaner  parts;[42] and exercising the higher powers of invention. Hence he would  have proceeded to point out the grandeur of style in the School of  Athens, in the majestic edifice, in the contour of the figures, in the  folds of the drapery, in the expression of the countenances, and in the  attitudes; and he would have easily traced the source of that sublimity  in the relics of antiquity. And if he appeared still greater in his  Isaiah, he might have refuted Vasari from his own account, who assigns  this work to a period anterior to 1511, and therefore contemporary as it  were with the School of Athens: adding, that he elevated his style by  propriety of character, and by the study of Grecian art. The Greeks  observed an essential difference between common men and heroes, and  again between their heroes and their gods; and Raffaello, after having  represented philosophers immersed in human doubts, might well elevate  his style when he came to figure a prophet meditating the revelations of  God.[43] All this might have been advanced by Raffaello, in order to  relieve Bramante and himself from so ill supported an imputation. As to  the rest, I believe he never would have denied, that the works of  Michelangiolo had inspired him with a more daring spirit of design, and  that in the exhibition of strong character, he had sometimes even  imitated him. But how imitated him? In rendering, as Crespi himself  observes, that very style more beautiful and more majestic, (p. 344). It  is indeed a great triumph to the admirers of Raffaello to be able to  say, whoever wishes to see what is wanting in the Sibyls of  Michelangiolo, let him inspect those of Raffaello; and let him view the  Isaiah of Raffaello, who would know what is wanting in the prophets of  Michelangiolo.    After public curiosity was gratified, and Raffaello had obtained a  glimpse of this new style, Bonarruoti closed the doors, and hastened to  finish the other half of his work, which was completed at the close of  1512, so that the Pope, on the solemnization of the Feast of Christmas,  was enabled to perform mass in the Sistine chapel. In the course of this  year, Raffaello was employed in the second chamber on the subject of  Heliodorus driven from the Temple by the prayers of Onias the high  priest, one of the most celebrated pictures of the place. In this  painting, the armed vision that appears to Heliodorus, scatters  lightnings from his hand, while the neighing of the steed is heard  amidst the attendant thunder. In the numerous bands, some of which are  plundering the riches of the Temple, and others are ignorant of the  cause of the surprise and terror exhibited in Heliodorus, consternation,  amazement, joy, and abasement, and a host of passions, are expressed. In  this work, and in others of these chambers, Raffaello, says Mengs, gave  to painting all the augmentation it could receive after Michelangiolo.  In this picture he introduced the portrait of Julius II., whose zeal and  authority is represented in Onias. He appears in a litter borne by his  grooms, in the manner in which he was accustomed to repair to the  Vatican, to view this work. The Miracle of Bolsena was also painted in  the lifetime of Julius.    The remaining decorations of these chambers were all illustrative of the  history of Leo X., whose imprisonment in Ravenna, and subsequent  liberation, is typified by St. Peter released from prison by the angel.  It was in this piece that the painter exhibited an astonishing proof of  his knowledge of light. The figures of the soldiers, who stand without  the prison, are illuminated by the beams of the moon: there is a torch  which produces a second light; and from the angel emanates a celestial  splendour, that rivals the beams of the sun. He has here, too, afforded  another proof how art may convert the impediments thrown in her way to  her own advantage; for the place where he was painting being broken by a  window, he has imagined on each side of it a staircase, which affords an  ascent to the prison, and on the steps he has placed the guards  overpowered with sleep; so that the painter does not seem to have  accommodated himself to the place, but the place to have become  subservient to the painter. The composition of S. Leo the Great, who  checks Attila at the head of his army, and that of the other chamber,  the battle with the Saracens in the port of Ostium, and the victory  obtained by S. Leo IV., justify Raffaello's claim to the epic crown: so  powerfully has he depicted the military array of men and horse, the arms  peculiar to each nation, the fury of the combat, and the despair and  humiliation of the prisoners. Near this performance, too, is the  wonderful piece of the Incendio di Borgo (a city enveloped in fire),  which is miraculously extinguished by the same S. Leo. This wonderful  piece alternately chills the heart with terror, or warms it with  compassion. The calamity of fire is carried to its extreme point, as it  is the hour of midnight, and the fire, which already occupies a  considerable space, is increased by a violent wind, which agitates the  flames that leap with rapidity from house to house. The affright and  misery of the inhabitants is also carried to the utmost extremity. Some  rush forward with water, but are driven back by the scorching flames;  others seek safety in flight, with naked feet, robeless, and with  dishevelled hair; women are seen turning an imploring look to the  Pontiff; mothers, whose own terrors are absorbed in fear for their  offspring; and here a youth, who bearing on his shoulders his aged and  infirm sire, and sinking beneath the weight, collects his almost  exhausted strength to place him out of danger. The concluding subjects  refer to Leo III.; the Coronation of Charlemagne, by the hand of that  Pontiff, and the Oath taken by the Pope on the Holy Evangelists, to  exculpate himself from the calumnies laid to his charge. In Leo, is  meant to be represented Leo X., who is thus honoured in the persons of  his predecessors; and in Charlemagne is represented Francis I., King of  France. Many persons of the age are also figured in the surrounding  group, so that there is not an historical subject in these chambers that  does not contain the most accurate likenesses. In this latter department  of art, also, Raffaello may be said to have been transcendant. His  portraits have deceived even persons the most intimately acquainted with  the subjects of them. He painted a remarkable picture of Leo X., and on  one occasion the Cardinal Datary of that time, found himself approaching  it with a bull, and pen and ink, for the Pope's signature.[44]    The six subjects which relate to Leo, elected in 1513, were finished in  1517. In the nine years which Raphael employed on these three chambers,  and also in the three following years, he made additional decorations to  the Pontifical Palace; he observed the style of ornament suitable to  each part of it, and thus made the Pope's residence a model of  magnificence and taste for all Europe. Few have adverted to this  instance of his merit. He superintended the new gallery of the palace,  availing himself in part of the design of Bramante, and in part  improving on him. \"He then made designs for the stuccos, and the various  subjects there painted, and also for the divisions, and he then  appointed Giovanni da Udine to finish the stuccos and arabesques, and  Giulio Romano the figures.\" The exposure of this gallery to the  inclemencies of the air, has left little remaining besides the squalid  grotesques; but those who saw it at an early period, when the unsullied  splendor of the gold, the pure white of the stuccos, the brilliancy of  the colours, and the newness of the marble, rendered every part of it  beautiful and resplendent, must have thought it a vision of paradise.  Vasari, in eulogizing it, says, \"It is impossible to execute, or to  conceive, a more exquisite work.\" The best which now remain are the  thirteen ceilings, in each of which are distributed four subjects from  holy writ, the first of which, the Creation of the World, Raffaello  executed with his own hand as a model for the others, which were painted  by his scholars, and afterwards retouched and rendered uniform by  himself, as was his custom. I have seen copies of these in Rome,  executed at great cost, and with great fidelity, for Catherine, Empress  of Russia, under the direction of Mr. Hunterberger, and from the effect  which was produced by the freshness of the colours, I could easily  conceive how highly enchanting the originals must have been. But their  great value consisted in Raffaello having enriched them by his  invention, expression, and design, and every one is agreed that each  subject is a school in itself. It appears certain too, that he was  desirous of competing with Michelangiolo, who had treated the same  subject in the Sistine chapel; and of appealing to the public to judge  whether or not he had equalled him. To describe in a suitable manner the  other pictures in chiaroscuro, and the numerous landscapes and  architectural subjects, the trophies, imitations of cameos, masks, and  other things which this divine artist either designed himself or formed  into new combinations from the antique, is a task, says Taja, far above  the reach of human powers. Taja has however himself given us a  delightful description of these works.[45] It confers the highest honour  on Raffaello, to whom we owe the fifty-two subjects, and all the  ornamental parts.
