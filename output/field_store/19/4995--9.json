Put her nearer.\"    Katheline cried out. But the alderman said:    \"You had better ask Satan, your friend, to refresh you.\"    And now her shoes were beginning to smoke in the heat of the fire,  so that she made a gesture as if to try and take them off.    \"Ask Satan to help you,\" said the alderman.    Ten o'clock struck. It was the madman's dinner hour. And he retired  with the torturer and the clerk of the court, leaving Katheline alone  in front of the fire in the place of torture.    An hour later they returned. Katheline was still sitting there stiff  and motionless. The clerk said:    \"I think she is dead.\"    The alderman commanded the torturer to remove Katheline from the  coffin-lid, and to take off the shoes from her feet. This he could  not do, so that he was forced to cut them, and Katheline's feet were  exposed to view, all red and bleeding. The alderman, whose thoughts  were still with his dinner, gazed at her without a word. But after  a while she came to her senses, and fell upon the ground, nor was  she able to get up again in spite of many attempts. Then she said to  the alderman:    \"Once you desired me for your wife. But now you shall have none of  me! Four times three is the sacred number, and my husband is the  thirteenth.\"    The alderman was going to answer her, but she forestalled him:    \"Be silent. His hearing is more delicate than that of the archangel  in heaven who counts the heart-beats of the just. Why are you so  late? Four times three is the sacred number. He killeth those who  hold me in desire.\"    The alderman said:    \"It seems she welcomes the devil to her bed!\"    \"The pains of the torture have turned her brain,\" said the clerk.    So Katheline was taken back into prison. And three days later there  was a meeting of the aldermen in the Council Hall; and after some  deliberation Katheline was condemned to suffer the ordeal by fire.    She was taken to the grand market of Damme by the torturer and his  assistants. There she was made to mount the scaffold. In the square  were assembled the provost, the herald, and the judges. The herald  sounded his trumpet thrice, then turned towards the crowd and made  the following announcement:    \"The Council of Damme,\" he cried, \"having taken pity upon the woman  Katheline, have decreed that punishment shall not be exacted to the  full extremity of the rigour of our laws. Nevertheless, in witness  that she is a sorceress, her hair shall be burned, she shall pay  a fine of twenty carolus d'or, and she shall be banished from the  territory of Damme for the space of three years, under penalty of  losing one of her limbs.\"    And at this rough gentleness the people broke into applause.    Then the torturer tied Katheline to the stake, placed on her shorn  scalp a wig of tow, and held it in the fire. And the tow burned for  a long time, and Katheline cried aloud and wept.    Then they released her, and she was put in a cart and taken away  outside the territory of Damme. She could not walk at all, because  of her feet that were burned.              XXVI      Ulenspiegel, meanwhile, had arrived in his wanderings at the  fish-market at Liege. There he descried a tall young fellow carrying  under his arm a net filled with all sorts of poultry, and another net  also which he was rapidly filling with haddock, trout, eels, and pike.    Ulenspiegel recognized him as none other than his old friend Lamme  Goedzak.    \"What are you doing here, Lamme?\" he said.    \"You must know,\" Lamme answered, \"that many people have lately  emigrated from Flanders to this gentle land of Liege. As for me,  I follow my loves. And you?\"    \"I am on the look-out for a master to serve for my daily bread,\"  said Ulenspiegel.    \"Bread is a dry sort of nourishment,\" said Lamme. \"You would do better  to try a chaplet of ortolans with a thrush for the Credo.\"    \"You have plenty of money?\" Ulenspiegel inquired.    Lamme Goedzak made answer:    \"I have lost my father and mother, and that young sister of mine that  used to beat me so. I shall inherit all their property, and now I am  living with a one-eyed servant who is very learned in the noble art  of making fricassees.\"    \"Would you like me to carry your fish and your poultry for  you?\" suggested Ulenspiegel.    \"Yes,\" said Lamme.    And together they began to wander through the market. All at once  Lamme said to his companion:    \"You are mad. Do you know why?\"    \"No,\" said Ulenspiegel.    \"Because you go carrying fish and poultry in your hand instead of in  your stomach.\"    \"You are right, Lamme,\" said Ulenspiegel; \"but since I have lacked  bread, ortolans will not even look at me.\"    \"You shall eat your fill of them,\" said Lamme, \"and serve me too,  if my cook takes a fancy to you.\"    While they were walking along, Lamme pointed out to Ulenspiegel a  beautiful young girl, who was walking through the market. She wore a  silk dress and gazed at Lamme with sweet and gentle eyes. An old man,  her father, walked just behind, carrying two nets, one filled with  fish, the other with game.    \"See that girl?\" said Lamme, pointing at her. \"I am going to marry  her.\"    \"Oh!\" said Ulenspiegel, \"I know her. She is a Flemish maid from  Zotteghem. She lives in the rue Vinave-d'Isle, and the neighbours say  that she lets her mother sweep the road in front of the house in her  stead, while her own father irons her underclothing.\"    To this Lamme made no answer, but exclaimed delightedly:    \"She looked at me just now!\"    By this time they were come to Lamme's lodging, near the  Pont-des-Arches. They knocked at the door, and a one-eyed servant  opened to them. Ulenspiegel saw that she was old, scraggy, lank,  and fierce of aspect.    Lamme addressed her as La Sanginne, and inquired if she would take  Ulenspiegel to help in the kitchen.    \"I will give him a trial,\" she said.    \"Then take him,\" said Lamme, \"and let him also make trial of the  delights of your kitchen.\"    La Sanginne put three black puddings on the table, a pint of ale,  and a large loaf of bread. Ulenspiegel set to with a will, and Lamme  began to nibble at one of the puddings.    \"Know you,\" Lamme asked presently, \"where it is that our souls abide?\"    \"No, Lamme,\" said Ulenspiegel.    \"In our stomachs,\" Lamme told him, \"so they can keep them excavated  continually, and for ever renew in our bodies the impulse for  life. And who are the best companions for a man? I'll tell you. The  best companions for a man are all good and jolly things to eat,  and wine from the Meuse to crown all!\"    \"True,\" said Ulenspiegel. \"A pudding is good company to a solitary  soul.\"    \"He's still hungry,\" said Lamme to La Sanginne. \"Give him some  more.\" And the woman served him with a second portion of pudding--white  this time.    While Ulenspiegel went on eating, Lamme grew thoughtful.    \"When I die,\" said he, \"my stomach will die with me, and down there  in purgatory they will leave me to fast, and I shall have to carry  my poor belly about with me, all empty and limp.\"    \"I like the black ones best,\" said Ulenspiegel.    \"You have eaten six already,\" said La Sanginne, \"and you won't have  any more.\"    \"You may be sure,\" said Lamme, \"that you will be well treated here,  and you will have just the same to eat as I do.\"    \"I shall remember this promise of yours,\" said Ulenspiegel. But  seeing that what his friend had told him was the truth, Ulenspiegel  was well content, and the puddings that he had swallowed gave him  such courage that on that very day he polished the kettles and the  pots and the pans till they shone like the sun. And he lived happily  in that house, frequenting willingly the kitchen and the wine-cellar,  and leaving the loft to the cats.    One day La Sanginne had two poulets to roast, and she asked Ulenspiegel  to turn the spit while she went to market for some herbs for a  seasoning. The two poulets being well roasted, Ulenspiegel took  one of them and ate it. When La Sanginne returned from the market  she remarked:    \"There were two poulets, but now I can only see one.\"    \"Just open your other eye,\" answered Ulenspiegel, \"and you will see  the two of them all right!\"    But she was angry, and went to Lamme Goedzak to tell him what had  happened. Lamme came down into the kitchen and said to Ulenspiegel:    \"Why do you make fun of my serving-maid? There were certainly two  poulets.\"    \"There were,\" said Ulenspiegel, \"but when I came you told me that I  was to eat and drink just as much as you. There were two poulets. Very  well. I have eaten one, and you will eat the other. My pleasure is  over. Yours is still to come. Are you not happier than I?\"    \"Yes,\" said Lamme smiling, \"but just you do what La Sanginne tells you,  and you'll find your work halved.\"    \"I will be careful to do as you say,\" said Ulenspiegel.    So every time that La Sanginne told him to do anything he did but  the half of it. If she asked him to go and draw two pails of water  he would only bring back one; and if she told him to go and fill a  pot of ale at the cask, he would pour the half of it down his throat  on the way--and so on and so on.    At last La Sanginne grew tired of these goings on, and she told Lamme  that either this good-for-nothing fellow must leave the house or she  must leave herself.    Lamme descended on Ulenspiegel and told him:    \"You'll have to go, my son, notwithstanding that you have looked so  much better in health since you have been here. Listen to that cock  crowing. And it's two o'clock of the afternoon! That means rain. I am  sorry to have to put you out of doors in bad weather. But there, my  son, you know that La Sanginne is the guardian angel of my life, with  her lovely fricassees. If she were to leave me I might die a speedy  death. I cannot risk it. Go then, my boy, and God be with you, and here  are three florins and this string of saveloys to liven your"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3760"],[0,"Sybil, Or, The Two Nations (#12)"],[1,"order at the Clarendon; there were  four hundred of us; the feeling was very strong.\"    \"A powerful party,\" said Egremont.    \"And a military order, sir, if properly understood. What could stand  against us? The Reform Bill could never have passed if the baronets had  been organized.\"    \"I have no doubt you could bring us in now,\" said Egremont.    \"That is exactly what I told Sir Robert. I want him to be brought in by  his own order. It would be a grand thing.\"    \"There is nothing like esprit de corps,\" said Egremont.    \"And such a body!\" exclaimed Sir Vavasour, with animation. \"Picture us  for a moment, to yourself going down in procession to Westminster for  example to hold a chapter. Five or six hundred baronets in dark green  costume,--the appropriate dress of equites aurati; each not only with  his badge, but with his collar of S.S.; belted and scarfed; his star  glittering; his pennon flying; his hat white with a plume of white  feathers; of course the sword and the gilt spurs. In our hand, the thumb  ring and signet not forgotten, we hold our coronet of two balls!\"    Egremont stared with irrepressible astonishment at the excited being,  who unconsciously pressed his companion's arm, as he drew this rapid  sketch of the glories so unconstitutionally withheld from him.    \"A magnificent spectacle!\" said Egremont.    \"Evidently the body destined to save this country,\" eagerly continued  Sir Vavasour. \"Blending all sympathies: the crown of which they are the  peculiar champions; the nobles of whom they are the popular branch; the  people who recognize in them their natural leaders. But the picture is  not complete. We should be accompanied by an equal number of gallant  knights, our elder sons, who, the moment they come of age, have the  right to claim knighthood of their sovereign, while their mothers and  wives, no longer degraded to the nomenclature of a sheriff's lady, but  resuming their legal or analogical dignities, and styled the 'honourable  baronetess,' with her coronet and robe, or the 'honourable knightess,'  with her golden collar of S.S., and chaplet or cap of dignity, may  either accompany the procession, or ranged in galleries in a becoming  situation, rain influence from above.\"    \"I am all for their going in the procession,\" said Egremont.    \"The point is not so clear,\" said Sir Vavasour solemnly; \"and indeed,  although we have been firm in defining our rightful claims in our  petitions, as for 'honorary epithets, secondary titles, personal  decorations, and augmented heraldic bearings.' I am not clear if  the government evinced a disposition for a liberal settlement of the  question, I would not urge a too stringent adherence to every point. For  instance, I am prepared myself, great as would be the sacrifice, even  to renounce the claim of secondary titles for our eldest sons, if for  instance they would secure us our coronet.\"    \"Fie, fie, Sir Vavasour,\" said Egremont very seriously, \"remember  principle: no expediency, no compromise.\"    \"You are right,\" said the baronet, colouring a little; \"and do you  know, Mr Egremont, you are the only individual I have yet met out of  the Order, who has taken a sensible view of this great question, which,  after all, is the question of the day.\"          Book 2 Chapter 3        The situation of the rural town of Marney was one of the most delightful  easily to be imagined. In a spreading dale, contiguous to the margin of  a clear and lively stream, surrounded by meadows and gardens, and backed  by lofty hills, undulating and richly wooded, the traveller on the  opposite heights of the dale would often stop to admire the merry  prospect, that recalled to him the traditional epithet of his country.    Beautiful illusion! For behind that laughing landscape, penury and  disease fed upon the vitals of a miserable population!    The contrast between the interior of the town and its external aspect,  was as striking as it was full of pain. With the exception of the dull  high street, which had the usual characteristics of a small agricultural  market town, some sombre mansions, a dingy inn, and a petty bourse,  Marney mainly consisted of a variety of narrow and crowded lanes formed  by cottages built of rubble, or unhewn stones without cement, and from  age, or badness of the material, looking as if they could scarcely hold  together. The gaping chinks admitted every blast; the leaning chimneys  had lost half their original height; the rotten rafters were evidently  misplaced; while in many instances the thatch, yawning in some parts  to admit the wind and wet, and in all utterly unfit for its original  purpose of giving protection from the weather, looked more like the top  of a dunghill than a cottage. Before the doors of these dwellings, and  often surrounding them, ran open drains full of animal and vegetable  refuse, decomposing into disease, or sometimes in their imperfect course  filling foul pits or spreading into stagnant pools, while a concentrated  solution of every species of dissolving filth was allowed to soak  through and thoroughly impregnate the walls and ground adjoining.    These wretched tenements seldom consisted of more than two rooms, in  one of which the whole family, however numerous, were obliged to  sleep, without distinction of age, or sex, or suffering. With the water  streaming down the walls, the light distinguished through the roof, with  no hearth even in winter, the virtuous mother in the sacred pangs of  childbirth, gives forth another victim to our thoughtless civilization;  surrounded by three generations whose inevitable presence is more  painful than her sufferings in that hour of travail; while the father of  her coming child, in another corner of the sordid chamber, lies stricken  by that typhus which his contaminating dwelling has breathed into his  veins, and for whose next prey is perhaps destined, his new-born child.  These swarming walls had neither windows nor doors sufficient to keep  out the weather, or admit the sun or supply the means of ventilation;  the humid and putrid roof of thatch exhaling malaria like all other  decaying vegetable matter. The dwelling rooms were neither boarded  nor paved; and whether it were that some were situate in low and damp  places, occasionally flooded by the river, and usually much below the  level of the road; or that the springs, as was often the case, would  burst through the mud floor; the ground was at no time better than so  much clay, while sometimes you might see little channels cut from  the centre under the doorways to carry off the water, the door itself  removed from its hinges: a resting place for infancy in its deluged  home. These hovels were in many instances not provided with the  commonest conveniences of the rudest police; contiguous to every  door might be observed the dung-heap on which every kind of filth was  accumulated, for the purpose of being disposed of for manure, so that,  when the poor man opened his narrow habitation in the hope of refreshing  it with the breeze of summer, he was met with a mixture of gases from  reeking dunghills.    This town of Marney was a metropolis of agricultural labour, for the  proprietors of the neighbourhood having for the last half century acted  on the system of destroying the cottages on their estates, in order to  become exempted from the maintenance of the population, the expelled  people had flocked to Marney, where, during the war, a manufactory had  afforded them some relief, though its wheels had long ceased to disturb  the waters of the Mar.    Deprived of this resource, they had again gradually spread themselves  over that land which had as it were rejected them; and obtained from  its churlish breast a niggardly subsistence. Their re-entrance into  the surrounding parishes was viewed with great suspicion; their renewed  settlement opposed by every ingenious contrivance; those who availed  themselves of their labour were careful that they should not become  dwellers on the soil; and though, from the excessive competition, there  were few districts in the kingdom where the rate of wages was more  depressed, those who were fortunate enough to obtain the scant  remuneration, had, in addition to their toil, to endure each morn and  even a weary journey before they could reach the scene of their labour,  or return to the squalid hovel which profaned the name of home. To that  home, over which Malaria hovered, and round whose shivering hearth were  clustered other guests besides the exhausted family of toil--Fever,  in every form, pale Consumption, exhausting Synochus, and trembling  Ague,--returned after cultivating the broad fields of merry England the  bold British peasant, returned to encounter the worst of diseases with  a frame the least qualified to oppose them; a frame that subdued by toil  was never sustained by animal food; drenched by the tempest could not  change its dripping rags; and was indebted for its scanty fuel to the  windfalls of the woods.    The eyes of this unhappy race might have been raised to the solitary  spire that sprang up in the midst of them, the bearer of present  consolation, the harbinger of future equality; but Holy Church at Marney  had forgotten her sacred mission. We have introduced the reader to the  vicar, an orderly man who deemed he did his duty if he preached  each week two sermons, and enforced humility on his congregation and  gratitude for the blessings of this life. The high Street and some  neighbouring gentry were the staple of his hearers. Lord and Lady Marney  came, attended by Captain Grouse, every Sunday morning with commendable  regularity, and were ushered into the invisible interior of a vast pew,  that occupied half of the gallery, was lined with crimson damask, and  furnished with easy chairs, and, for those who chose them, well-padded  stools of prayer.
