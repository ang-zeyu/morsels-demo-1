III    SONG (_Continued_)      \"But if beneath yon southern sky      A plaided stranger roam,    Whose drooping crest and stifled sigh,                          30    And sunken cheek and heavy eye,      Pine for his Highland home;    Then, warrior, then be thine to show    The care that soothes a wanderer's woe;    Remember then thy hap ere while,                                35    A stranger in the lonely isle.      \"Or if on life's uncertain main      Mishap shall mar thy sail;    If faithful, wise, and brave in vain,    Woe, want, and exile thou sustain                               40      Beneath the fickle gale;    Waste not a sigh on fortune changed,    On thankless courts, or friends estranged,    But come where kindred worth shall smile,    To greet thee in the lonely isle.\"                              45      IV      As died the sounds upon the tide,    The shallop reached the mainland side,    And ere his onward way he took,    The stranger cast a lingering look,    Where easily his eye might reach                                50    The Harper on the islet beach,    Reclined against a blighted tree,    As wasted, gray, and worn as he.    To minstrel meditation given,    His reverend brow was raised to heaven,                         55    As from the rising sun to claim    A sparkle of inspiring flame.    His hand, reclined upon the wire,    Seemed watching the awakening fire;    So still he sat, as those who wait                              60    Till judgment speak the doom of fate;    So still, as if no breeze might dare    To lift one lock of hoary hair;    So still, as life itself were fled,    In the last sound his harp had sped.                            65      V      Upon a rock with lichens wild,    Beside him Ellen sat and smiled--    Smiled she to see the stately drake    Lead forth his fleet upon the lake,    While her vexed spaniel, from the beach                         70    Bayed at the prize beyond his reach?    Yet tell me, then, the maid who knows,    Why deepened on her cheek the rose?    Forgive, forgive, Fidelity!    Perchance the maiden smiled to see                              75    Yon parting lingerer wave adieu,    And stop and turn to wave anew;    And, lovely ladies, ere your ire    Condemn the heroine of my lyre,    Show me the fair would scorn to spy,                            80    And prize such conquest of her eye!      VI      While yet he loitered on the spot,    It seemed as Ellen marked him not;    But when he turned him to the glade,    One courteous parting sign she made;                            85    And after, oft the knight would say,    That not when prize of festal day    Was dealt him by the brightest fair,    Who e'er wore jewel in her hair,    So highly did his bosom swell,                                  90    As at that simple mute farewell.    Now with a trusty mountain-guide,    And his dark stag-hounds by his side,    He parts--the maid, unconscious still,    Watched him wind slowly round the hill;                         95    But when his stately form was hid,    The guardian in her bosom chid--    \"Thy Malcolm! vain and selfish maid!\"    'Twas thus upbraiding conscience said--    \"Not so had Malcolm idly hung                                  100    On the smooth phrase of southern tongue;    Not so had Malcolm strained his eye    Another step than thine to spy.    Wake, Allan-bane,\" aloud she cried,    To the old Minstrel by her side--                              105    \"Arouse thee from thy moody dream!    I'll give thy harp heroic theme,    And warm thee with a noble name;    Pour forth the glory of the Graeme!\"    Scarce from her lip the word had rushed,                       110    When deep the conscious maiden blushed;    For of his clan, in hall and bower,    Young Malcolm Graeme was held the flower.      VII      The Minstrel waked his harp--three times    Arose the well-known martial chimes,                           115    And thrice their high heroic pride    In melancholy murmurs died.    \"Vainly thou bid'st, O noble maid,\"    Clasping his withered hands, he said,    \"Vainly thou bid'st me wake the strain,                        120    Though all unwont to bid in vain.    Alas! than mine a mightier hand    Has tuned my harp, my strings has spanned!    I touch the chords of joy, but low    And mournful answer notes of woe;                              125    And the proud march, which victors tread,    Sinks in the wailing for the dead.    O well for me, if mine alone    That dirge's deep prophetic tone!    If, as my tuneful fathers said,                                130    This harp, which erst Saint Modan swayed,    Can thus its master's fate foretell,    Then welcome be the minstrel's knell!      VIII      \"But ah! dear lady, thus it sighed    The eve thy sainted mother died;                               135    And such the sounds which, while I strove    To wake a lay of war or love,    Came marring all the festal mirth,    Appalling me who gave them birth,    And, disobedient to my call,                                   140    Wailed loud through Bothwell's bannered hall,    Ere Douglases to ruin driven,    Were exiled from their native heaven.    Oh! if yet worse mishap and woe,    My master's house must undergo,                                145    Or aught but weal to Ellen fair,    Brood in these accents of despair,    No future bard, sad Harp! shall fling    Triumph or rapture from thy string;    One short, one final strain shall flow,                        150    Fraught with unutterable woe,    Then shivered shall thy fragments lie,    Thy master cast him down and die!\"      IX      Soothing she answered him--\"Assuage,    Mine honored friend, the fears of age;                         155    All melodies to thee are known,    That harp has rung, or pipe has blown,    In Lowland vale or Highland glen,    From Tweed to Spey--what marvel, then,    At times, unbidden notes should rise,                          160    Confusedly bound in memory's ties,    Entangling, as they rush along,    The war-march with the funeral song?    Small ground is now for boding fear;    Obscure, but safe, we rest us here.                            165    My sire, in native virtue great,    Resigning lordship, lands, and state,    Not then to fortune more resigned,    Than yonder oak might give the wind;    The graceful foliage storms may reave,                         170    The noble stem they cannot grieve.    For me,\"--she stooped, and, looking round,    Plucked a blue hare-bell from the ground--    \"For me, whose memory scarce conveys    An image of more splendid days,                                175    This little flower, that loves the lea,    May well my simple emblem be;    It drinks heaven's dew as blithe as rose    That in the king's own garden grows;    And when I place it in my hair,                                180    Allan, a bard is bound to swear    He ne'er saw coronet so fair.\"    Then playfully the chaplet wild    She wreathed in her dark locks, and smiled.      X      Her smile, her speech, with winning sway,                      185    Wiled the old harper's mood away.    With such a look as hermits throw,    When angels stoop to soothe their woe,    He gazed, till fond regret and pride    Thrilled to a tear, then thus replied:                         190    \"Loveliest and best! thou little know'st    The rank, the honors, thou hast lost!    O might I live to see thee grace,    In Scotland's court, thy birth-right place,    To see my favorite's step advance,                             195    The lightest in the courtly dance,    The cause of every gallant's sigh,    And leading star of every eye,    And theme of every minstrel's art,    The Lady of the Bleeding Heart!\"                               200      XI      \"Fair dreams are these,\" the maiden cried    --Light was her accent, yet she sighed--    \"Yet is this mossy rock to me    Worth splendid chair and canopy;    Nor would my footsteps spring more gay                         205    In courtly dance than blithe strathspey,    Nor half so pleased mine ear incline    To royal minstrel's lay as thine.    And then for suitors proud and high,    To bend before my conquering eye--                             210    Thou, flattering bard! thyself wilt say,    That grim Sir Roderick owns its sway.

(1) We have been asked to DEFINE a savage. He cannot be defined in an  epigram, but by way of choice of a type:--    1. In material equipment the perfect savage is he who employs tools of  stone and wood, not of metal; who is nomadic rather than settled; who  is acquainted (if at all) only with the rudest forms of the arts of  potting, weaving, fire-making, etc.; and who derives more of his food  from the chase and from wild roots and plants than from any kind of  agriculture or from the flesh of domesticated animals.    2. In psychology the savage is he who (extending unconsciously to the  universe his own implicit consciousness of personality) regards all  natural objects as animated and intelligent beings, and, drawing no hard  and fast line between himself and the things in the world, is readily  persuaded that men may be metamorphosed into plants, beasts and stars;  that winds and clouds, sun and dawn, are persons with human passions  and parts; and that the lower animals especially may be creatures more  powerful than himself, and, in a sense, divine and creative.    3. In religion the savage is he who (while often, in certain moods,  conscious of a far higher moral faith) believes also in ancestral  ghosts or spirits of woods and wells that were never ancestral; prays  frequently by dint of magic; and sometimes adores inanimate objects, or  even appeals to the beasts as supernatural protectors.    4. In society the savage is he who (as a rule) bases his laws on the  well-defined lines of totemism--that is, claims descent from or other  close relation to natural objects, and derives from the sacredness of  those objects the sanction of his marriage prohibitions and blood-feuds,  while he makes skill in magic a claim to distinguished rank.    Such, for our purpose, is the savage, and we propose to explain the more  \"senseless\" factors in civilised mythology as \"survivals\" of these ideas  and customs preserved by conservatism and local tradition, or, less  probably, borrowed from races which were, or had been, savage.    (2) Aglaoph., i. 153. Had Lobeck gone a step farther and examined the  mental condition of veteres et priscae gentes, this book would have  been, superfluous. Nor did he know that the purer ideas were also  existing among certain low savages.      It is universally admitted that \"survivals\" of this kind do account for  many anomalies in our institutions, in law, politics, society, even in  dress and manners. If isolated fragments of earlier ages abide in these,  it is still more probable that other fragments will survive in anything  so closely connected as is mythology with the conservative religious  sentiment and tradition. Our object, then, is to prove that the \"silly,  savage, and irrational\" element in the myths of civilised peoples is,  as a rule, either a survival from the period of savagery, or has been  borrowed from savage neighbours by a cultivated people, or, lastly,  is an imitation by later poets of old savage data.(1) For example,  to explain the constellations as metamorphosed men, animals, or other  objects of terrestrial life is the habit of savages,(2)--a natural habit  among people who regard all things as on one level of personal life and  intelligence. When the stars, among civilised Greeks or Aryans of India,  are also popularly regarded as transformed and transfigured men, animals  and the like, this belief may be either a survival from the age when the  ancestors of Greeks and Indians were in the intellectual condition  of the Australian Murri; or the star-name and star-myth may have been  borrowed from savages, or from cultivated peoples once savage or apt to  copy savages; or, as in the case of the Coma Berenices, a poet of a late  age may have invented a new artificial myth on the old lines of savage  fancy.      (1) We may be asked why do savages entertain the irrational ideas which  survive in myth? One might as well ask why they eat each other, or  use stones instead of metal. Their intellectual powers are not fully  developed, and hasty analogy from their own unreasoned consciousness  is their chief guide. Myth, in Mr. Darwin's phrase, is one of the  \"miserable and indirect consequences of our highest faculties\". Descent  of Man, p. 69.    (2) See Custom and Myth, \"Star-Myths\".      This method of interpreting a certain element in mythology is, we must  repeat, no new thing, though, to judge from the protests of several  mythologists, it is new to many inquirers. We have seen that Eusebius  threw out proposals in this direction; that Spencer, De Brosses, and  Fontenelle unconsciously followed him; and we have quoted from Lobeck  a statement of a similar opinion. The whole matter has been stated as  clearly as possible by Mr. B. B. Tylor:--    \"Savages have been for untold ages, and still are, living in the  myth-making stage of the human mind. It was through sheer ignorance and  neglect of this direct knowledge how and by what manner of men myths  are really made that their simple philosophy has come to be buried under  masses of commentator's rubbish...\"(1) Mr. Tylor goes on thus (and his  words contain the gist of our argument): \"The general thesis maintained  is that myth arose in the savage condition prevalent in remote ages  among the whole human race; that it remains comparatively unchanged  among the rude modern tribes who have departed least from these  primitive conditions, while higher and later civilisations, partly by  retaining its actual principles, and partly by carrying on its inherited  results in the form of ancestral tradition, continued it not merely in  toleration, but in honour\".(2) Elsewhere Mr. Tylor points out that by  this method of interpretation we may study myths in various stages  of evolution, from the rude guess of the savage at an explanation of  natural phenomena, through the systems of the higher barbarisms, or  lower civilisations (as in ancient Mexico), and the sacerdotage of  India, till myth reaches its most human form in Greece. Yet even in  Greek myth the beast is not wholly cast out, and Hellas by no means \"let  the ape and tiger die\". That Mr. Tylor does not exclude the Aryan  race from his general theory is plain enough.(3) \"What is the Aryan  conception of the Thunder-god but a poetic elaboration of thoughts  inherited from the savage stage through which the primitive Aryans had  passed?\"(4)      (1) Primitive Culture, 2nd edit., i. p. 283.    (2) Op. cit., p. 275.    (3) Primitive Culture, 2nd edit., ii. 265.    (4) Pretty much the same view seems to be taken by Mr. Max Muller  (Nineteenth Century, January, 1882) when he calls Tsui Goab (whom the  Hottentots believe to be a defunct conjuror) \"a Hottentot Indra or  Zeus\".      The advantages of our hypothesis (if its legitimacy be admitted) are  obvious. In the first place, we have to deal with an actual demonstrable  condition of the human intellect. The existence of the savage state  in all its various degrees, and of the common intellectual habits and  conditions which are shared by the backward peoples, and again the  survival of many of these in civilisation, are indubitable facts. We are  not obliged to fall back upon some fanciful and unsupported theory of  what \"primitive man\" did, and said, and thought. Nay, more; we escape  all the fallacies connected with the terms \"primitive man\". We are not  compelled (as will be shown later)(1) to prove that the first men of all  were like modern savages, nor that savages represent primitive man.  It may be that the lowest extant savages are the nearest of existing  peoples to the type of the first human beings. But on this point it is  unnecessary for us to dogmatise. If we can show that, whether men began  their career as savages or not, they have at least passed through the  savage status or have borrowed the ideas of races in the savage  status, that is all we need. We escape from all the snares of theories  (incapable of historical proof) about the really primeval and original  condition of the human family.      (1) Appendix B.      Once more, our theory naturally attaches itself to the general system  of Evolution. We are enabled to examine mythology as a thing of gradual  development and of slow and manifold modifications, corresponding in  some degree to the various changes in the general progress of society.  Thus we shall watch the barbaric conditions of thought which produce  barbaric myths, while these in their turn are retained, or perhaps  purified, or perhaps explained away, by more advanced civilisations.  Further, we shall be able to detect the survival of the savage ideas  with least modification, and the persistence of the savage myths with  least change, among the classes of a civilised population which have  shared least in the general advance. These classes are, first, the  rustic peoples, dwelling far from cities and schools, on heaths or by  the sea; second, the conservative local priesthoods, who retain the more  crude and ancient myths of the local gods and heroes after these  have been modified or rejected by the purer sense of philosophers and  national poets. Thus much of ancient myth is a woven warp and woof of  three threads: the savage donnee, the civilised and poetic modification  of the savage donnee, the version of the original fable which survives  in popular tales and in the \"sacred chapters\" of local priesthoods. A  critical study of these three stages in myth is in accordance with the  recognised practice of science. Indeed, the whole system is only an  application to this particular province, mythology, of the method by  which the development either of organisms or of human institutions is  traced. As the anomalies and apparently useless and accidental features  in the human or in other animal organisms may be explained as stunted or  rudimentary survivals"]]]
