[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2748"],[0,"Derues (#12)"],[1,"-room.    \"What is that?\" cried the woman. \"Surely it is a dying person!\"    The sense of the danger which threatened made Derues pull himself  together. \"Do not be alarmed,\" he said. \"My wife has been seized with a  violent fever; she is quite delirious now, and that is why I told the  porter to let no one come up.\"    But the groans in the next room continued, and the unwelcome visitor,  overcome by terror which she could neither surmount nor explain, took a  hasty leave, and descended the staircase with all possible rapidity. As  soon as he could close the door, Derues returned to the bedroom.    Nature frequently collects all her expiring strength at the last moment  of existence. The unhappy lady struggled beneath her coverings; the  agony she suffered had given her a convulsive energy, and inarticulate  sounds proceeded from her mouth. Derues approached and held her on the  bed. She sank back on the pillow, shuddering convulsively, her hands  plucking and twisting the sheets, her teeth chattering and biting the  loose hair which fell over her face and shoulders. \"Water! water!\" she  cried; and then, \"Edouard,--my husband!--Edouard!--is it you?\" Then  rising with a last effort, she seized her murderer by the arm,  repeating, \"Edouard!--oh!\" and then fell heavily, dragging Derues down  with her. His face was against hers; he raised his head, but the dying  hand, clenched in agony, had closed upon him like a vise. The icy  fingers seemed made of iron and could not be opened, as though the  victim had seized on her assassin as a prey, and clung to the proof of  his crime.    Derues at last freed himself, and putting his hand on her heart, \"It is  over,\" he remarked; \"she has been a long time about it. What o'clock is  it? Nine! She has struggled against death for twelve hours!\"    While the limbs still retained a little warmth, he drew the feet  together, crossed the hands on the breast, and placed the body in the  chest. When he had locked it up, he remade the bed, undressed himself,  and slept comfortably in the other one.    The next day, February 1st, the day he had fixed for the \"going out\" of  Madame de Lamotte, he caused the chest to be placed on a hand-cart and  carried at about ten o'clock in the morning to the workshop of a  carpenter of his acquaintance called Mouchy, who dwelt near the Louvre.  The two commissionaires employed had been selected in distant quarters,  and did not know each other. They were well paid, and each presented  with a bottle of wine. These men could never be traced. Derues requested  the carpenter's wife to allow the chest to remain in the large workshop,  saying he had forgotten something at his own house, and would return to  fetch it in three hours. But, instead of a few hours, he left it for two  whole days--why, one does not know, but it may be supposed that he  wanted the time to dig a trench in a sort of vault under the staircase  leading to the cellar in the rue de la Mortellerie. Whatever the cause,  the delay might have been fatal, and did occasion an unforeseen  encounter which nearly betrayed him. But of all the actors in this scene  he alone knew the real danger he incurred, and his coolness never  deserted him for a moment.    The third day, as he walked alongside the handcart on which the chest  was being conveyed, he was accosted at Saint Germain l'Auxerrois by a  creditor who had obtained a writ of execution against him, and at the  imperative sign made by this man the porter stopped. The creditor  attacked Derues violently, reproaching him for his bad faith in language  which was both energetic and uncomplimentary; to which the latter  replied in as conciliatory a manner as he could assume. But it was  impossible to silence the enemy, and an increasing crowd of idlers began  to assemble round them.    \"When will you pay me?\" demanded the creditor. \"I have an execution  against you. What is there in that box? Valuables which you cart away  secretly, in order to laugh at my just claims, as you did two years  ago?\"    Derues shuddered all over; he exhausted himself in protestations; but  the other, almost beside himself, continued to shout.    \"Oh!\" he said, turning to the crowd, \"all these tricks and grimaces and  signs of the cross are no good. I must have my money, and as I know what  his promises are worth, I will pay myself! Come, you knave, make haste.  Tell me what there is in that box; open it, or I will fetch the police.\"    The crowd was divided between the creditor and debtor, and possibly a  free fight would have begun, but the general attention was distracted by  the arrival of another spectator. A voice heard above all the tumult  caused a score of heads to turn, it was the voice of a woman crying:    \"The abominable history of Leroi de Valine, condemned to death at the  age of sixteen for having poisoned his entire family!\"    Continually crying her wares, the drunken, staggering woman approached  the crowd, and striking out right and left with fists and elbows, forced  her way to Derues.    \"Ah! ah!\" said she, after looking him well over, \"is it you, my gossip  Derues! Have you again a little affair on hand like the one when you set  fire to your shop in the rue Saint-Victor?\"    Derues recognised the hawker who had abused him on the threshold of his  shop some years previously, and whom he had never seen since. \"Yes,  yes,\" she continued, \"you had better look at me with your little round  cat's eyes. Are you going to say you don't know me?\"    Derues appealed to his creditor. \"You see,\" he said, \"to what insults  you are exposing me. I do not know this woman who abuses me.\"    \"What!--you don't know me! You who accused me of being a thief! But  luckily the Maniffets have been known in Paris as honest people for  generations, while as for you----\"    \"Sir,\" said Derues, \"this case contains valuable wine which I am  commissioned to sell. To-morrow I shall receive the money for it;  to-morrow, in the course of the day, I will pay what I owe you. But I am  waited for now, do not in Heaven's name detain me longer, and thus  deprive me of the means of paying at all.\"    \"Don't believe him, my good man,\" said the hawker; \"lying comes natural  to him always.\"    \"Sir, I promise on my oath you shall be paid tomorrow; you had better  trust the word of an honest man rather than the ravings of a drunken  woman.\"    The creditor still hesitated, but, another person now spoke in Derues'  favour; it was the carpenter Mouchy, who had inquired the cause of the  quarrel.    \"For God's sake,\" he exclaimed, \"let the gentleman go on. That chest  came from my workshop, and I know there is wine inside it; he told my  wife so two days ago.\"    \"Will you be surety for me, my friend?\" asked Derues.    \"Certainly I will; I have not known you for ten years in order to leave  you in trouble and refuse to answer for you. What the devil are  respectable people to be stopped like this in a public place? Come, sir,  believe his word, as I do.\"    After some more discussion, the porter was at last allowed to proceed  with his hand-cart. The hawker wanted to interfere, but Mouchy warned  her off and ordered her to be silent. \"Ah! ah!\" she cried, \"what does it  matter to me? Let him sell his wine if he can; I shall not drink any on  his premises. This is the second time he has found a surety to my  knowledge; the beggar must have some special secret for encouraging the  growth of fools. Good-bye, gossip Derues; you know I shall be selling  your history some day. Meanwhile----    \"The abominable history of Leroi de Valine, condemned to death at the  age of sixteen for having poisoned his entire family!\"    Whilst she amused the people by her grimaces and grotesque gestures, and  while Mouchy held forth to some of them, Derues made his escape. Several  times between Saint-Germain l'Auxerrois and the rue de la Mortellerie he  nearly fainted, and was obliged to stop. While the danger lasted, he had  had sufficient self-control to confront it coolly, but now that he  calculated the depth of the abyss which for a moment had opened beneath  his feet, dizziness laid hold on him.    Other precautions now became necessary. His real name had been mentioned  before the commissionaire, and the widow Masson, who owned the cellar,  only knew him as Ducoudray. He went on in front, asked for the keys,  which till then had been left with her, and the chest was got downstairs  without any awkward questions. Only the porter seemed astonished that  this supposed wine, which was to be sold immediately, should be put in  such a place, and asked if he might come the next day and move it again.  Derues replied that someone was coming for it that very day. This  question, and the disgraceful scene which the man had witnessed, made it  necessary to get rid of him without letting him see the pit dug under  the staircase. Derues tried to drag the chest towards the hole, but all  his strength was insufficient to move it. He uttered terrible  imprecations when he recognised his own weakness, and saw that he would  be obliged to bring another stranger, an informer perhaps, into this  charnel-house, where; as yet, nothing betrayed his crimes. No sooner  escaped from one peril than he encountered another, and already he had  to struggle against his own deeds. He measured the length of the trench,  it was too short. Derues went out and repaired to the place where he had  hired the labourer who had dug it out, but he could not find the man,  whom he had only seen once, and whose name he did not know. Two whole  days were spent in this fruitless search, but on the third, as he was  wandering on one of the quays at the time labourers were to be found  there, a mason, thinking he was looking for someone, inquired what he  wanted. Derues looked well at the man, and concluding from his  appearance that he was probably rather simpleminded, asked--    \"Would you like to earn a crown of three livres by an easy job?\"   "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2749"],[0,"La Constantin (#12)"],[1," secret between us, and do not mention it to the so-called  Moranges.\"    \"I have your oath, monsieur, that you will give me notice before you use  the document I have given you against me, have I? But what guarantee  have I that you will keep your word?\"    \"My course of action till to-day, and the fact that I have pledged you  my word of my own free will.\"    \"I see, you hope not to have long to wait for the end.\"    \"I hope not; but meantime a premature disclosure would do me as much  harm as you. I have not the slightest rancour against you, commander;  you have robbed me of no treasure; I have therefore no compensation to  demand. What you place such value on would be only a burden to me, as it  will be to you later on. All I want is, to know as soon as it is no  longer in your possession, whether it has been removed by the will of  God or by your own, I am right in thinking that to-day there is some  hope of the chevalier's recovery, am I not?\"    \"Yes, Sir.\"    \"Do you give me your promise that if ever he leave this house safe and  sound you will let me know?\"    \"I give you my promise.\"    \"And if the result should be different, you will also send me word?\"    \"Certainly. But to whom shall I address my message?\"    \"I should have thought that since our first meeting you would have found  out all about me, and that to tell you my name would be superfluous. But  I have no reason to hide it: Maitre Quennebert, notary, Saint-Denis. I  will not detain you any longer now, commander; excuse a simple citizen  for dictating conditions to a noble such as you. For once chance has  been on my side although a score of times it has gone against me.\"    De Jars made no reply except a nod, and walked away quickly, muttering  words of suppressed anger between his teeth at all the--humiliations to  which he had been obliged to submit so meekly.    \"He's as insolent as a varlet who has no fear of a larruping before his  eyes: how the rapscallion gloried in taking advantage of his position!  Taking-off his hat while putting his foot on my neck! If ever I can be  even with you, my worthy scrivener, you'll pass a very bad quarter of an  hour, I can tell you.\"    Everyone has his own idea of what constitutes perfect honour. De Jars,  for instance, would have allowed himself to be cut up into little pieces  rather than have broken the promise he had given Quennebert a week ago,  because it was given in exchange for his life, and the slightest  paltering with his word under those circumstances would have been  dastardly. But the engagement into which he had just entered had in his  eyes no such moral sanction; he had not been forced into it by threats,  he had escaped by its means no serious danger, and therefore in regard  to it his conscience was much more accommodating. What he should best  have liked to do, would have been to have sought out the notary and  provoked him by insults to send him a challenge.    That a clown such as that could have any chance of leaving the ground  alive never entered his head. But willingly as he would have encompassed  his death in this manner, the knowledge that his secret would not die  with Quennebert restrained him, for when everything came out he felt  that the notary's death would be regarded as an aggravation of his  original offence, and in spite of his rank he was not at all certain  that if he were put on his trial even now he would escape scot free,  much less if a new offence were added to the indictment. So, however  much he might chafe against the bit, he felt he must submit to the  bridle.    \"By God!\" said he, \"I know what the clodhopper is after; and even if I  must suffer in consequence, I shall take good care that he cannot shake  off his bonds. Wait a bit! I can play the detective too, and be down on  him without letting him see the hand that deals the blows. It'll be a  wonder if I can't find a naked sword to suspend above his head.\"    However, while thus brooding over projects of vengeance, Commander de  Jars kept his word, and about a month after the interview above related  he sent word to Quennebert that the Chevalier de Moranges had left  Perregaud's completely recovered from his wound. But the nearly fatal  result of the chevalier's last prank seemed to have subdued his  adventurous spirit; he was no longer seen in public, and was soon  forgotten by all his acquaintances with the exception of Mademoiselle de  Guerchi. She faithfully treasured up the memory of his words of passion,  his looks of love, the warmth of his caresses, although at first she  struggled hard to chase his image from her heart. But as the Due de  Vitry assured her that he had killed him on the spot, she considered it  no breach of faith to think lovingly of the dead, and while she took the  goods so bounteously provided by her living lover, her gentlest  thoughts, her most enduring regrets, were given to one whom she never  hoped to see again.          CHAPTER VIII      With the reader's permission, we must now jump over an interval of  rather more than a year, and bring upon the stage a person who, though  only of secondary importance, can no longer be left behind the scenes.    We have already said that the loves of Quennebert and Madame Rapally  were regarded with a jealous eye by a distant cousin of the lady's late  husband. The love of this rejected suitor, whose name was Trumeau, was  no more sincere than the notary's, nor were his motives more honourable.  Although his personal appearance was not such as to lead him to expect  that his path would be strewn with conquests, he considered that his  charms at least equalled those of his defunct relative; and it may be  said that in thus estimating them he did not lay himself--open to the  charge of overweening vanity. But however persistently he preened him  self before the widow, she vouchsafed him not one glance. Her heart was  filled with the love of his rival, and it is no easy thing to tear a  rooted passion out of a widow's heart when that widow's age is  forty-six, and she is silly enough to believe that the admiration she  feels is equalled by the admiration she inspires, as the unfortunate  Trumeau found to his cost. All his carefully prepared declarations of  love, all his skilful insinuations against Quennebert, brought him  nothing but scornful rebuffs. But Trumeau was nothing if not  persevering, and he could not habituate himself to the idea of seeing  the widow's fortune pass into other hands than his own, so that every  baffled move only increased his determination to spoil his competitor's  game. He was always on the watch for a chance to carry tales to the  widow, and so absorbed did he become in this fruitless pursuit, that he  grew yellower and more dried up from day to day, and to his jaundiced  eye the man who was at first simply his rival became his mortal enemy  and the object of his implacable hate, so that at length merely to get  the better of him, to outwit him, would, after so long-continued and  obstinate a struggle and so many defeats, have seemed to him too mild a  vengeance, too incomplete a victory.    Quennebert was well aware of the zeal with which the indefatigable  Trumeau sought to injure him. But he regarded the manoeuvres of his  rival with supreme unconcern, for he knew that he could at any time  sweep away the network of cunning machinations, underhand insinuations,  and malicious hints, which was spread around him, by allowing the widow  to confer on him the advantages she was so anxious to bestow. The goal,  he knew, was within his reach, but the problem he had to solve was how  to linger on the way thither, how to defer the triumphal moment, how to  keep hope alive in the fair one's breast and yet delay its fruition. His  affairs were in a bad way. Day by day full possession of the fortune  thus dangled before his eyes, and fragments of which came to him  occasionally by way of loan, was becoming more and more indispensable,  and tantalising though it was, yet he dared not put out his hand to  seize it. His creditors dunned him relentlessly: one final reprieve had  been granted him, but that at an end, if he could not meet their  demands, it was all up with his career and reputation.    One morning in the beginning of February 1660, Trumeau called to see his  cousin. He had not been there for nearly a month, and Quennebert and the  widow had begun to think that, hopeless of success, he had retired from  the contest. But, far from that, his hatred had grown more intense than  ever, and having come upon the traces of an event in the past life of  his rival which if proved would be the ruin of that rival's hopes, he  set himself to gather evidence. He now made his appearance with beaming  looks, which expressed a joy too great for words. He held in one hand a  small scroll tied with a ribbon. He found the widow alone, sitting in a  large easy-chair before the fire. She was reading for the twentieth time  a letter which Quenriebert had written her the evening before. To judge  by the happy and contented expression of the widow's face, it must have  been couched in glowing terms. Trumeau guessed at once from whom the  missive came, but the sight of it, instead of irritating him, called  forth a smile.    \"Ah! so it's you, cousin?\" said the widow, folding the precious paper  and slipping it into the bosom of her dress. \"How do you do? It's a long  time since I saw you, more than a fortnight, I think. Have you been  ill?\"    \"So you remarked my absence! That is very flattering, my dear cousin;  you do not often spoil me by such attentions. No, I have not been ill,  thank God, but I thought it better not to intrude upon you so often. A  friendly call now and then such as to-day's is what you like, is it not?  By the way, tell me about your handsome suitor, Maitre Quennebert; how  is he getting along?\"    \"You look very knowing, Trumeau: have you heard of anything happening to  him?\"    \"No, and I"]]]
