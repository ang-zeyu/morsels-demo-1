The priests in  particular owed it to their special character to draw their blood for  the benefit of the gods, and nothing could be stranger than the refined  methods they adopted to accomplish this end. For instance, they would  pass strings or splinters through their lips or ears and so draw a  little blood. But then a fresh string or a fresh splinter must be added  every day, and so it might go on indefinitely, for the more there were,  the more meritorious was the act; nor can we doubt that the idea of the  suffering endured enhancing the merit of the deed itself, was already  widely spread in Mexico. There was a system of Mexican _asceticism_,  too, specially characterized by the long fasts which the faithful, and  more particularly the priests, endured. Indeed, fasting is one of the  most general and ancient forms of adoration. It rests, in the first  place, on an instinctive feeling that a man is more worthy to present  himself before the divine beings when fasting than when stuffed with  food; and, in the second place, on the fact that fasting is shown by  experience to promote dreams, hallucinations, extasies and so forth,  which have always been considered as so many forms of communication with  the deity.[24] It was only later that fasting became the sign and index  of mourning, and therefore of sincere repentance and profound sorrow.  Mexico had its solitaries or hermits, too, who sought to enter into  closer communion with the gods by living in the desert under conditions  of the severest asceticism. Are we not once more tempted to exclaim that  there is nothing new under the sun?    But the devotees of the ancient Mexican religion had other methods of  uniting themselves substantially and corporeally with their gods; and in  accordance with the notions which we have seen were accredited by their  religion, they had developed a kind (or kinds) of _communion_ from  which, with a little theology, a regular doctrine of transubstantiation  might have been drawn.    Thus, at the third great festival in honour of Uitzilopochtli  (celebrated at the time of his death), they made an image of the deity  in dough, steeped it in the blood of sacrificed children, and partook of  the pieces.[25] In the same way the priests of Tlaloc kneaded statuettes  of their god in dough, cut them up, and gave them to eat to patients  suffering from the diseases caused by the cold and wet.[26] The  statuettes were first consecrated by a small sacrifice. And so, too, at  the yearly festival of the god of fire, Xiuhtecutli, an image of the  deity, made of dough, was fixed in the top of a great tree which had  been brought into the city from the forest. At a certain moment the tree  was thrown down, on which of course the idol broke to pieces, and the  worshippers all scrambled for a bit of him to eat.    It has been asked how far any moral idea had penetrated this religion,  the repulsive aspects of which we have been describing. The question is  a legitimate one. I believe, Gentlemen, that in studying the religious  origins of the different peoples of the earth, we shall come to the  conclusion that the fusion of the religious and moral life--which has  long been an accomplished fact for us, especially since the Gospel, so  that we cannot admit the possibility of uniting immorality and piety for  a single instant--is not primitive, but is due to the development of the  human spirit, and to healthier, more complete and more religious ideas  concerning the moral law. At the beginning of things, and in our own day  amongst savages, nay, even amongst the most ignorant strata of the  population in civilized countries, it is obvious that religion and  morals have extremely little to do with each other. Some authors,  accordingly, in the face of all the monstrous cruelty, selfishness and  inhumanity of the Mexican religion, have concluded that no element of  morality entered into it at all, but that all was self-seeking and  fanaticism.    This is an exaggeration. We have seen that amongst the nature-gods of  Mexico there was one, Tezcatlipoca, who was looked upon as the austere  guardian of law and morals. If we are to believe Father Sahagun,--and  even if we allow for strong suspicions as to the accuracy of his  translations of the prayers and exhortations uttered under certain  circumstances by parents and priests,--it is evident that the Mexicans  were taught to consider a decent and virtuous life as required by the  gods. Indeed, they had a system of confession, in which the priest  received the statement of the penitent, laid a penance on him, and  assured him of the pardon of the gods. Generally the penitents delayed  their confession till they were advanced in age, for relapses were  regarded as beyond the reach of pardon.[27] It would be nearer the truth  to say that the religious ethics of the Mexicans had entered upon that  path of dualism[28] by which alone, in almost every case, the normal  synthesis or rational reconciliation of the demands of physical nature  and the moral life has been ultimately reached. For inasmuch as fidelity  to duty often involves a certain amount of suffering, the suffering  comes to be regarded as the moral act itself, and artificial sufferings  are voluntarily incurred under the idea that they are the appointed  price of access to a higher and more perfect life, in closer conformity  with the divine will. The cruel rites which entered into the very tissue  of the Mexican religion could hardly fail to strengthen the same ascetic  tendency, by encouraging the idea that pain itself was pleasant to the  eyes of the gods. But the truth is that in this matter we can discern no  more than tendencies. There are symptoms of men's minds being busy with  the relation of the moral to the religious life, but no fixed or  systematic conclusions had been reached. It might, perhaps, have been  otherwise in the sequel, and these tendencies might ultimately have  taken shape in corresponding theories and doctrines, had not the Spanish  conquest intervened to put an end for ever to the evolution of the  Mexican religion.    I have frequently spoken of the Mexican priests, and the time has now  come for dwelling more explicitly on this priesthood.    It was very numerous, and had a strong organization reared on an  aristocratic basis, into which political calculations manifestly  entered. The noblest families (including that of the monarch) had the  exclusive privilege of occupying the highest sacerdotal offices. The  priests of Uitzilopochtli held the primacy. Their chief was sovereign  pontiff, with the title of _Mexicatl-Teohuatzin_, \"Mexican lord of  sacred things,\" and _Teotecuhtli_, \"divine master.\" Next to him came the  chief priest of Quetzalcoatl, who had no authority, however, except over  his own order of clergy. He lived as a recluse in his sanctuary, and the  sovereign only sent to consult him on certain great occasions; whereas  the primate sat on the privy council and exercised disciplinary powers  over all the other priests in the empire. Every temple and every  quarter had its regular priests. No one could enter the priesthood until  he had passed satisfactorily through certain tests or examinations  before the directors of the _Calmecac_, or houses of religious  education, of which we shall speak presently. The power of the clergy  was very great. They instructed youth, fixed the calendar, preserved the  knowledge of the annals and traditions indicated by the hieroglyphics,  sang and taught the religious and national hymns, intervened with  special ceremonies at birth, marriage and burial, and were richly  endowed by taxes raised in kind upon the products of the soil and upon  industries. Every successful aspirant to the priesthood, having passed  the requisite examinations, received a kind of unction, which  communicated the sacred character to him. All this indicates a  civilization that had already reached a high point of development; but  the indelible stain of the Mexican religion re-appears every moment even  where it seems to rise highest above the primitive religions: amongst  the ingredients of the fluid with which the new priest was anointed was  the blood of an infant!    The priests' costume in general was black. Their mantles covered their  heads and fell down their sides like a veil. They never cut their hair,  and the Spaniards saw some of them whose locks descended to their knees.  Probably this was a part of the solar symbolism. The rays of the Sun are  compared to locks of hair, and we very often find the solar heroes or  the servants of the Sun letting their hair grow freely in order that  they may resemble their god. Their mode of life was austere and sombre.  They were subject to the rules of a severe asceticism, slept little,  rose at night to chant their canticles, often fasted, often drew their  own blood, bathed every night (in imitation of the Sun again), and in  many of the sacerdotal fraternities the most rigid celibacy was  enforced. You will see, then, that I did not exaggerate when I spoke of  the belief that the gods were animated by cruel wills and took pleasure  in human pain as having launched the Mexican religion on a path of a  systematic dualism and very stern asceticism.[29]    But the surprise we experience in noting all these points of resemblance  to the religious institutions of the Old World, perhaps reaches its  culminating point when we learn that the Mexican religion actually had  its convents. These convents were often, but not always, places of  education for both sexes, to which all the free families sent their  children from the age of six or nine years upwards. There the boys were  taught by"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34834"],[0,"A Text-Book of Astronomy (#12)"],[1,"along the ecliptic about twenty degrees per year, an extraordinarily  rapid perturbation, and one of great consequence in the theory of  eclipses.    [Illustration: FIG. 22.--A planet subject to great perturbations by  Jupiter.]    40. WEIGHING THE PLANETS.--Although these perturbations can not be  considered dangerous, they are interesting since they furnish a method  for weighing the planets which produce them. From the law of gravitation  we learn that the ability of a planet to produce perturbations depends  directly upon its mass, since the force _F_ which it exerts contains  this mass, _m´_, as a factor. So, too, the divisor _r^{2}_ in the  expression for the force shows that the distance between the disturbing  and disturbed bodies is a matter of great consequence, for the smaller  the distance the greater the force. When, therefore, the mass of a  planet such as Jupiter is to be determined from the perturbations it  produces, it is customary to select some such opportunity as is  presented in Fig. 22, where one of the small planets, called asteroids,  is represented as moving in a very eccentric orbit, which at one point  approaches close to the orbit of Jupiter, and at another place comes  near to the orbit of the earth. For the most part Jupiter will not exert  any very great disturbing influence upon a planet moving in such an  orbit as this, since it is only at rare intervals that the asteroid and  Jupiter approach so close to each other, as is shown in the figure. The  time during which the asteroid is little affected by the attraction of  Jupiter is used to study the motion given to it by the sun's  attraction--that is, to determine carefully the undisturbed orbit in  which it moves; but there comes a time at which the asteroid passes  close to Jupiter, as shown in the figure, and the orbital motion which  the sun imparts to it will then be greatly disturbed, and when the  planet next comes round to the part of its orbit near the earth the  effect of these disturbances upon its apparent position in the sky will  be exaggerated by its close proximity to the earth. If now the  astronomer observes the actual position of the asteroid in the sky, its  right ascension and declination, and compares these with the position  assigned to the planet by the law of gravitation when the attraction of  Jupiter is ignored, the differences between the observed right  ascensions and declinations and those computed upon the theory of  undisturbed motion will measure the influence that Jupiter has had upon  the asteroid, and the amount by which Jupiter has shifted it, compared  with the amount by which the sun has moved it--that is, with the motion  in its orbit--furnishes the mass of Jupiter expressed as a fractional  part of the mass of the sun.    There has been determined in this manner the mass of every planet in the  solar system which is large enough to produce any appreciable  perturbation, and all these masses prove to be exceedingly small  fractions of the mass of the sun, as may be seen from the following  table, in which is given opposite the name of each planet the number by  which the mass of the sun must be divided in order to get the mass of  the planet:        Mercury      7,000,000 (?)      Venus          408,000      Earth          329,000      Mars         3,093,500      Jupiter          1,047.4      Saturn           3,502      Uranus          22,800      Neptune         19,700    It is to be especially noted that the mass given for each planet  includes the mass of all the satellites which attend it, since their  influence was felt in the perturbations from which the mass was derived.  Thus the mass assigned to the earth is the combined mass of earth and  moon.    41. DISCOVERY OF NEPTUNE.--The most famous example of perturbations is  found in connection with the discovery, in the year 1846, of Neptune,  the outermost planet of the solar system. For many years the motion of  Uranus, his next neighbor, had proved a puzzle to astronomers. In  accordance with Kepler's first law this planet should move in an ellipse  having the sun at one of its foci, but no ellipse could be found which  exactly fitted its observed path among the stars, although, to be sure,  the misfit was not very pronounced. Astronomers surmised that the small  deviations of Uranus from the best path which theory combined with  observation could assign, were due to perturbations in its motion  caused by an unknown planet more remote from the sun--a thing easy to  conjecture but hard to prove, and harder still to find the unknown  disturber. But almost simultaneously two young men, Adams in England and  Le Verrier in France, attacked the problem quite independently of each  other, and carried it to a successful solution, showing that if the  irregularities in the motion of Uranus were indeed caused by an unknown  planet, then that planet must, in September, 1846, be in the direction  of the constellation Aquarius; and there it was found on September 23d  by the astronomers of the Berlin Observatory whom Le Verrier had invited  to search for it, and found within a degree of the exact point which the  law of gravitation in his hands had assigned to it.    This working backward from the perturbations experienced by Uranus to  the cause which produced them is justly regarded as one of the greatest  scientific achievements of the human intellect, and it is worthy of note  that we are approaching the time at which it may be repeated, for  Neptune now behaves much as did Uranus three quarters of a century ago,  and the most plausible explanation which can be offered for these  anomalies in its path is that the bounds of the solar system must be  again enlarged to include another disturbing planet.    42. THE SHAPE OF A PLANET.--There is an effect of gravitation not yet  touched upon, which is of considerable interest and wide application in  astronomy--viz., its influence in determining the shape of the heavenly  bodies. The earth is a globe because every part of it is drawn toward  the center by the attraction of the other parts, and if this attraction  on its surface were everywhere of equal force the material of the earth  would be crushed by it into a truly spherical form, no matter what may  have been the shape in which it was originally made. But such is not the  real condition of the earth, for its diurnal rotation develops in every  particle of its body a force which is sometimes called _centrifugal_,  but which is really nothing more than the inertia of its particles,  which tend at every moment to keep unchanged the direction of their  motion and which thus resist the attraction that pulls them into a  circular path marked out by the earth's rotation, just as a stone tied  at the end of a string and swung swiftly in a circle pulls upon the  string and opposes the constraint which keeps it moving in a circle. A  few experiments with such a stone will show that the faster it goes the  harder does it pull upon the string, and the same is true of each  particle of the earth, the swiftly moving ones near the equator having a  greater centrifugal force than the slow ones near the poles. At the  equator the centrifugal force is directly opposed to the force of  gravity, and in effect diminishes it, so that, comparatively, there is  an excess of gravity at the poles which compresses the earth along its  axis and causes it to bulge out at the equator until a balance is thus  restored. As we have learned from the study of geography, in the case of  the earth, this compression amounts to about 27 miles, but in the larger  planets, Jupiter and Saturn, it is much greater, amounting to several  thousand miles.    But rotation is not the only influence that tends to pull a planet out  of shape. The attraction which the earth exerts upon the moon is  stronger on the near side and weaker on the far side of our satellite  than at its center, and this difference of attraction tends to warp the  moon, as is illustrated in Fig. 23 where _1_, _2_, and _3_ represent  pieces of iron of equal mass placed in line on a table near a horseshoe  magnet, _H_. Each piece of iron is attracted by the magnet and is held  back by a weight to which it is fastened by means of a cord running over  a pulley, _P_, at the edge of the table. These weights are all to be  supposed equally heavy and each of them pulls upon its piece of iron  with a force just sufficient to balance the attraction of the magnet for  the middle piece, No. _2_. It is clear that under this arrangement No.  _2_ will move neither to the right nor to the left, since the forces  exerted upon it by the magnet and the weight just balance each other.  Upon No. _1_, however, the magnet pulls harder than upon No. _2_,  because it is nearer and its pull therefore more than balances the force  exerted by the weight, so that No. _1_ will be pulled away from No. _2_  and will stretch the elastic cords, which are represented by the lines  joining _1_ and _2_, until their tension, together with the force  exerted by the weight, just balances the attraction of the magnet. For  No. _3_, the force exerted by the magnet is less than that of the  weight, and it will also be pulled away from No. _2_ until its elastic  cords are stretched to the proper tension. The net result is that the  three blocks which, without the magnet's influence, would be held close  together by the elastic cords, are pulled apart by this outside force as  far as the resistance of the cords will permit.    [Illustration: FIG. 23.--Tide-raising forces.]    An entirely analogous set of forces produces a similar effect upon the  shape of the moon. The elastic cords of Fig. 23 stand for the attraction  of gravitation by which all the parts of the moon are bound together.  The magnet represents the earth pulling with unequal force upon  different parts of the moon. The weights are the inertia of the moon in  its orbital motion which, as"]]]
