Yet the free swing of  the elm's wide-spreading branches inevitably suggests the pointed Gothic  arch in simplicity and obvious strength.    It is difficult to say when the American elm is most worthy of  admiration. In summer those same arching branches are clothed and tipped  with foliage of such elegance and delicacy as the form of the tree would  seem to predicate. The leaf itself is ornate, its straight ribs making  up a serrated and pointed oval form of the most interesting character.  These leaves hang by slender stems, inviting the gentlest zephyr to  start them to singing of comfort in days of summer heat. The elm is  fully clothed down to the drooping tips of the branchlets with foliage,  which, though deepest green above, reflects, under its dense shade, a  soft light from the paler green of the lower side. It is no wonder that  New England claims fame for her elms, which, loved and cared for, arch  over the long village streets that give character to the homes of the  descendants of the Puritan fathers. The fully grown elm presents to the  sun a darkly absorbent hue, and to the passer-by who rests beneath its  shade the most grateful and restful color in all the rainbow's palette.    [Illustration: A mature American elm]    Then, too, the evaporative power of these same leaves is simply  enormous, and generally undreamed of. Who would think that a great,  spreading elm, reaching into the air of August a hundred feet, and  shading a circle of nearly as great diameter, was daily cooling the  atmosphere with tons of water, silently drawn from the bosom of Mother  Earth!    Like many other common trees, the American elm blooms almost unnoticed.  When the silver maple bravely pushes out its hardy buds in earliest  spring--or often in what might be called latest winter--the elm is  ready, and the sudden swelling of the twigs, away above our heads in  March or April, is not caused by the springing leaves, but is the  flowering effort of this noble tree. The bloom sets curiously about the  yet bare branches, and the little brownish yellow or reddish flowers are  seemingly only a bunch of stamens. They do their work promptly, and the  little flat fruits, or \"samaras,\" are ripened and dropped before most of  us realize that the spring is fully upon us. These seeds germinate  readily, and I recall the great pleasure with which a noted  horticultural professor showed me what he called his \"elm lawn,\" one  summer. It seemed that almost every one of the thousands of seeds that,  just about the time his preparations for sowing a lawn were completed,  had softly fallen from the great elm which guards and shades his  dooryard, had found good ground, and the result was a miniature forest  of tiny trees, giving an effect of solid green which was truly a tree  lawn.    [Illustration: The delicate tracery of the American elm in winter]    But, after all, I think it is in winter that the American elm is at its  finest, for then stand forth most fully revealed the wonderful symmetry  of its structure and the elegance of its lines. It has one advantage in  its great size, which is well above the average, for it lifts its  graceful head a hundred feet or more above the earth. The stem is  usually clean and regular, and the branches spread out in closely  symmetrical relation, so that, as seen against the cold sky of winter,  leafless and bare, they seem all related parts of a most harmonious  whole. Other great trees are notable for the general effect of strength  or massiveness, individual branches departing much from the average line  of the whole structure; but the American elm is regular in all its  parts, as well as of general stateliness.    As I have noted, the people of the New England States value and cherish  their great elms, and they are accustomed to think themselves the only  possessors of this unique tree. We have, however, as good elms in  Pennsylvania as there are in New England, and I hope the day is not far  distant when we shall esteem them as highly. The old elm monarch which  stands at the gingerbread brownstone entrance of the Capitol Park in  Pennsylvania's seat of government has had a hard battle, defenseless as  it is, against the indifference of those whom it has shaded for  generations, and who carelessly permitted the telegraph and telephone  linemen to use it or chop it at their will. But latterly there has been  an awakening which means protection, I think, for this fine old  landmark.    The two superb elms, known as \"Paul and Virginia,\" that make notable the  north shore of the Susquehanna at Wilkesbarre, are subjects of local  pride; which seems, however, not strong enough to prevent the erection  of a couple of nasty little shanties against their great trunks. There  can be no doubt, however, that the sentiment of reverence for great  trees, and of justice to them for their beneficent influence, is  spreading westward and southward from New England. It gives me keen  pleasure to learn of instances where paths, pavements or roadways have  been changed, to avoid doing violence to good trees; and a recent  account of the creation of a trust fund for the care of a great oak, as  well as a unique instance in Georgia, where a deed has been recorded  giving a fine elm a quasi-legal title to its own ground, show that the  rights of trees are coming to be recognized.    I have said little of the habitat, as the botanist puts it, of the  American elm. It graces all North America east of the Rockies, and the  specimens one sees in Michigan or Canada are as happy, apparently, as if  they grew in Connecticut or in Virginia. Our increasingly beautiful  national Capital, the one city with an intelligent and controlled system  of tree-planting, shows magnificent avenues of flourishing elms.    But I must not forget some other elms, beautiful and satisfactory in  many places. It is no discredit to our own American elm to say that the  English elm is a superb tree in America. It seems to be  characteristically British in its sturdy habit, and forms a grand trunk.    [Illustration: The English elm in winter]    The juicy inner bark of the red or \"slippery\" elm was always acceptable,  in lieu of the chewing-gum which had not then become so common, to a  certain ever-hungry boy who used to think as much of what a tree would  furnish that was eatable as he now does of its beauty. Later, the other  uses of the bark of this tree became known to the same boy, but it was  many years before he came really to know the slippery elm. One day a  tree branch overhead showed what seemed to be remarkable little green  flowers, which on examination proved to be, instead, the very  interesting fruit of this elm, each little seed securely held inside a  very neat and small flat bag. Looking at it earlier the next spring, the  conspicuous reddish brown color of the bud-scales was noted.    I have never seen the \"wahoo,\" or winged elm of the South, and there are  several other native elms, as well as a number of introductions from the  Eastern Hemisphere, with which acquaintance is yet to be made. All of  them together, I will maintain with the quixotic enthusiasm of lack of  knowledge, are not worth as much as one-half hour spent in looking up  under the leafy canopy of our own preeminent American elm--a tree  surely among those given by the Creator for the healing of the nations.    The tulip-tree, so called obviously because of the shape of its flowers,  has a most mellifluous and pleasing botanical name, _Liriodendron  Tulipifera_--is not that euphonious? Just plain \"liriodendron\"--how much  better that sounds as a designation for one of the noblest of American  forest trees than the misleading \"common\" names! \"Tulip-tree,\" for a  resemblance of the form only of its extraordinary blooms; \"yellow  poplar,\" probably because it is not yellow, and is in no way related to  the poplars; and \"whitewood,\" the Western name, because its wood is  whiter than that of some other native trees. \"Liriodendron\" translated  means \"lily-tree,\" says my learned friend who knows Greek, and that is a  fitting designation for this tree, which proudly holds forth its  flowers, as notable and beautiful as any lily, and far more dignified  and refined than the gaudy tulip. I like to repeat this smooth-sounding,  truly descriptive and dignified name for a tree worthy all admiration.  Liriodendron! Away with the \"common\" names, when there is such a  pleasing scientific cognomen available!    By the way, why should people who will twist their American tongues all  awry in an attempt to pronounce French words in which the necessary  snort is unexpressed visually and half the characters are \"silent,\"  mostly exclaim at the alleged difficulty of calling trees and plants by  their world names, current among educated people everywhere, while  preferring some misleading \"common\" name? Very few scientific plant  names are as difficult to pronounce as is the word \"chrysanthemum,\" and  yet the latter comes as glibly from the tongue as do \"geranium,\"  \"rhododendron,\" and the like. Let us, then, at least when we have as  good a name as liriodendron for so good a tree, use it in preference to  the most decidedly \"common\" names that belie and mislead.    I have said that this same tulip-tree--which I will call liriodendron  hereafter, at a venture--is a notable American tree, peculiar to this  country. So believed the botanists for many years, until an inquiring  investigator found that China, too, had the same tree, in a limited  way. We will still claim it as an American native, and tell the Chinamen  they are fortunate to have such a superb tree in their little-known  forests. They have undoubtedly taken advantage, in their art forms, of  its peculiarly shaped leaves, if not of the flowers and the curious  \"candlesticks\" that succeed them.    [Illustration:"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2882"],[0,"The Legends of the Jews — Volume 4 (#12)"],[1,"generous, Saul led the life of a  saint in his own house, observing even the priestly laws of purity.  Therefore God reproached David with having pronounced a curse  upon Saul in his prayer. (80) Also, David in his old age was  punished for having cut off the corner of Saul's mantle, for no  amount of clothing would keep him warm. (81) Finally, when a  great famine fell upon the land during the reign of David, God told  him it had been inflicted upon him because Saul's remains had not  been buried with the honor due to him, and at that moment a  heavenly voice resounded calling Saul \"the elect of God.\" (82)     THE COURT OF SAUL    The most important figure at the court of Saul was his cousin  Abner, the son of the witch of En-dor. (83) He was a giant of  extraordinary size. A wall measuring six ells in thickness could be  moved more easily than one of Abner's feet. (84) David once  chanced to get between the feet of Abner as he lay asleep, and he  was almost crushed to death, when fortunately Abner moved them,  and David made his escape. (85) Conscious of his vast strength he  once cried out: \"If only I could seize the earth at some point, I  should be able to shake it.\" Even in the hour of death, wounded  mortally by Joab, he grasped his murderer like a worsted ball. He  was about to kill him, but the people crowded round them, and  said to Abner: \"If thou killest Joab, we shall be orphaned, and our  wives and children will be prey to the Philistines.\" Abner replied:  \"What can I do? He was about to extinguish my light.\" The people  consoled him: \"Commit thy cause to the true Judge.\" Abner  thereupon loosed his hold upon Joab, who remained unharmed,  while Abner fell dead instantly. God had decided against him. (86)  The reason was that Joab was in a measure justified in seeking to  avenge the death of his brother Asahel. Asahel, the supernaturally  swift runner, (87)   so swift that he ran through a field without  snapping the ears of wheat (88)   had been the attacking party. He  had sough to take Abner's life, and Abner contended, that in killing  Asahel he had but acted in self-defense. Before inflicting the fatal  wound, Joab held a formal court of justice over Abner. He asked:  \"Why didst thou no render Asahel harmless by wounding him  rather than kill him?\" Abner replied that he could not have done it.  \"What,\" said Joab, incredulous, \"if thou wast able to strike him  under the fifth rib, dost thou mean to say thou couldst not have  made him innocuous by a wound, and saved him alive?\" (89)    Although Abner was a saint, (90) even a \"lion in the law,\" (91) he  perpetrated many a deed that made his violent death appear just. It  was in his favor that he had refused to obey Saul's command to do  away with the priests of Nob. (92) Yet a man of his stamp should  not have rested content with passive resistance. He should have  interposed actively, and kept Saul from executing his blood design.  And granted that Abner could not have influenced the king's mind  in this matter, (93) at all events he is censurable for having  frustrated a reconciliation between Saul and David. When David,  holding in his hand the corner of the king's mantle which he had  cut off, sought to convince Saul of his innocence, it was Abner  who turned the king against the suppliant fugitive. \"Concern not  thyself about it,\" he said to Saul. \"David found the rag on a  thornbush in which thou didst catch the skirt of thy mantle as thou  didst pass it.\" (94) On the other hand, no blame attaches to Abner  for having espoused the cause of Saul's son against David for two  years and a half. He knew that God had designated David for the  royal office, but, according to an old tradition, God had promised  two kings to the tribe of Benjamin, and Abner considered it his  duty to transmit his father's honor to the son of Saul the Benjamite.  (95)    Another figure of importance during Saul's reign, but a man of  radically different character, was Doeg. Doeg, the friend of Saul  from the days of his youth, (96) died when he was thirty-four years  old, (97) yet at that early age he had been president of the  Sanhedrin and the greatest scholar of his time. He was called  Edomi, which means, not Edomite, but \"he who causes the blush  of shame,\" because by his keen mind and his learning he put to  shame all who entered into argument with him. (98) But his  scholarship lay only on his lips, his heart was not concerned in it,  and his one aim was to elicit admiration. (99) Small wonder, then,  that his end was disastrous. At the time of his death he had sunk so  low that he forfeited all share in the life to come. (100) Wounded  vanity caused his hostility to David, who had got the better of him  in a learned discussion. (101) From that moment he bent all his  energies to the task of ruining David. He tried to poison Saul's  mind against David, by praising the latter inordinately, and so  arousing Saul's jealousy. (102) Again, he would harp on David's  Moabite descent, and maintain that on account of it he could not  be admitted into the congregation of Israel. Samuel and other  prominent men had to bring to bear all the weight of their  authority to shield David against the consequences of Doeg's  sophistry. (103)    Doeg's most grievous transgression, however, was his informing  against the priests of Nob, whom he accused of high treason and  executed as traitors. For all his iniquitous deeds he pressed the law  into his service, and derived justification of his conduct from it.  Abimelech, the high priest at Nob, admitted that he had consulted  the Urim and Thummim for David. This served Doeg as the basis  for the charge of treason, and he stated it as an unalterable Halakah  that the Urim and Thummim may be consulted only for a king. In  vain Abner and Amasa and all the other members of the Sanhedrin  demonstrated that the Urim and Thummim may be consulted for  any on whose undertaking concerns the general welfare. Doeg  would not yield, and as no one could be found to execute the  judgement, he himself officiated as hangman. (104) When the  motive of revenge actuated him, he held cheap alike the life and  honor of his fellow-man. He succeeded in convincing Saul that  David's marriage with the king's daughter Michal had lost its  validity from the moment David was declared a rebel. As such, he  said, David was as good as dead, since a rebel was outlawed.  Hence his wife was no longer bound to him. (105) Doeg's  punishment accorded with his misdeeds. He who had made  impious use of his knowledge of the law, completely forgot the  law, and even his disciples rose up against him, and drove him  from the house of study. In the end he died a leper.    Dreadful as this death was, it was not accounted an atonement for  his sins. One angel burned his soul, and another scattered his ashes  in all the house of study and prayer. (106) The son of Doeg was  Saul's armor-bearer, who was killed by David for daring to slay the  king even though he longed for death. (107)    Along with Abner and Doeg, Jonathan distinguished himself in the  reign of his father. His military capacity was joined to deep  scholarship. To the latter he owed his position as Ab Bet Din.  (108) Nevertheless he was one of the most modest men known in  history. (109) Abinadab was another one of Saul's sons who was  worthy of his father, wherefore he was sometimes called Ishvi.  (110) As for Saul's grandson Mephibosheth. He, too, was reputed a  great man. David himself did not scorn to sit at his feet, and he  revered Mephibosheth as his teacher. (111) The wrong done him  by David in granting one-half his possessions to Ziba, the slave of  Mephibosheth, did not go unavenged. When David ordered the  division of the estate of Mephibosheth, a voice from heaven  prophesied: \"Jeroboam and Rehoboam shall divide the kingdom  between themselves.\" (112)     DAVID'S BIRTH AND DESCENT    David, the \"elect of God,\" (1) was descended from a family which  itself belonged to the elect of Israel. Those ancestors of his who  are enumerated in the Bible by name are all of them men of  distinguished excellence. Besides, David was a descendant of  Miriam, (2) the sister of Moses, and so the strain of royal  aristocracy was reinforced by the priestly aristocracy. Nor was  David the first of his family to occupy the throne of a ruler. His  great-grandfather Boaz was one and the same person with Ibzan,  the judge of Bethlehem. (3) Othniel, too, the first judge in Israel  after the death of Joshua, and Caleb, (4) the brother of Othniel,  were connected with David's family. As examples of piety and  virtue, David had his grandfather and more particularly his father  before him. His grandfather's whole life was a continuous service  of God, (5) whence his name Obed, \"the servant,\" and his father  Jesse was one of the greatest scholars of his time, (6) and one of  the four who died wholly untainted by sin. (7) If God had not  ordained death for all the descendants of our first parents after  their fall, Jesse would have continued to live forever. As it was, he  died at the age of four hundred, (8) and then a violent death, by the  hand of the Moabite king, (9) in whose care David, trusting in the  ties of kinship between the Moabites and the seed of Ruth, left his  family when he was fleeing before Saul. Jesse's piety will not go  unrewarded. In the Messianic time he will be one of the eight  princes to rule over the world. (10)    In spite of his piety, Jesse was not always proof against temptation.  One of his slaves caught his fancy, and he would have entered into  illicit relations with her, had his wife, Nazbat, the daughter of  Adiel, not frustrated the plan. She disguised herself as the slave,  and Jesse, deceived by the ruse, met his own wife. The child borne  by Nazbat was given out as the son of the freed slave, so that the  father might not discover the deception practiced upon him. This  child was David. "]]]
