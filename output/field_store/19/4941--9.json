The  thing has nothing in common with the larva of the Anthrax, it suggests  rather some microscopic Thread worm that, by accident, has made its way  through the skin of its host and come to enjoy itself outside. I do not  reckon my discovery as of much value, because I am so greatly puzzled  by the creature's appearance. No matter: we will take a small glass  tube and place inside it the Chalicodoma grub and the mysterious thing  wriggling on the surface. Suppose it should be what I am looking for?  Who knows?    Once warned of the probable difficulty of seeing the animalcule for  which I am hunting, I redouble my attention, so much so that, in a  couple of days, I am the owner of half a score of tiny worms similar  to the one which caused me such excitement. Each of them is lodged in  a glass tube with its Chalicodoma grub. The infinitesimal thing is so  small, so diaphanous, blends to such good purpose with its host that the  least fold of skin conceals it from my view. After watching it one day  through the lens, I sometimes fail to find it again on the morrow. I  think that I have lost it, that it has perished under the weight of the  overturned larva and returned to that nothing to which it was so closely  akin. Then it moves and I see it again. For a whole fortnight, there  was no limit to my perplexity. Was it really the original larva of the  Anthrax? Yes, for I at last saw my bantlings transform themselves into  the larva previously described and make their first start at draining  their victims with kisses. A few moments of satisfaction like those  which I then enjoyed make up for many a weary hour.    Let us resume the story of the wee animal, now recognized as the genuine  origin of the Anthrax. It is a tiny worm about a millimeter long and  almost as slender as a hair. It is very difficult to see because of its  transparency. When tucked away in a fold of the skin of its fostering  larva, an excessively fine skin, it remains undiscoverable to the lens.  But the feeble creature is very active: it tramps over the sides of the  rich morsel, walks all round it. It covers the ground pretty quickly,  buckling and unbuckling by turns, very much after the manner of the  looper caterpillar. Its two extremities are its chief points of support.  When at a standstill, it moves its front half in every direction, as  though to explore the space around it; when walking, it swells out,  magnifies its segments and then looks like a bit of knotted string.    The microscope shows us thirteen rings, including the head. This head is  small, slightly horny, as is proved by its amber color, and bristles in  front with a small number of short, stiff hairs. On each of the three  segments of the thorax there are two long hairs, fixed to the lower  surface; and there are two similar and still longer hairs at the end of  the terminal ring. These four pairs of bristles, three in front and one  behind, are the locomotory organs, to which we must add the hairy edge  of the head and also the anal button, a sustaining base which might  very well work with the aid of a certain stickiness, as happens with  the primary larva of the Sitaris [a Parasitic Beetle noted for the  multiplicity of transformations undergone by the grub]. We see, through  the transparent skin, two long air tubes running parallel to each other  from the first thoracic segment to the last abdominal segment but one.  They ought to end in two pairs of breathing holes which I have not  succeeded in distinguishing quite plainly. Those two big respiratory  vessels are characteristic of the grubs of flies. Their mouths  correspond exactly with the points at which the two sets of stigmata  open in the Anthrax larva in its second form.    For a fortnight, the feeble grub remains in the condition which I have  described, without growing and very probably also without nourishment.  Assiduous though my visits be, I never perceive it taking any  refreshment. Besides, what would it eat? In the cocoon invaded there is  nothing but the larva of the mason bee; and the worm cannot make use  of this before acquiring the sucker that comes with the second form.  Nevertheless, this life of abstinence is not a life of idleness. The  animalcule explores its dish, now here, now elsewhere; it runs all over  it with looper strides; it pries into the neighborhood by lifting and  shaking its head.    I see a need for this long wait under a transitory form that requires  no feeding. The egg is laid by the mother on the surface of the nest,  somewhere near a suitable cell, I dare say, but still at a distance from  the fostering larva, which is protected by a thick rampart. It is for  the new born grub to make its own way to the provisions, not by violence  and house breaking, of which it is incapable, but by patiently slipping  through a maze of cracks, first tried, then abandoned, then tried again.  It is a very difficult task, even for this most slender worm, for the  bee's masonry is exceedingly compact. There are no chinks due to bad  building; no fissures due to the weather; nothing but an apparently  impenetrable homogeneity. I see but one weak part and that only in a few  nests: it is the line where the dome joins the surface of the stone. An  imperfect soldering between two materials of different nature, cement  and flint, may leave a breach wide enough to admit besiegers as thin as  a hair. Nevertheless, the lens is far from always finding an inlet of  this kind on the nests occupied by Anthrax flies.    And so I am ready to allow that the animalcule wandering in search of  its cell has the whole area of the dome at its disposal when selecting  an entrance. Where the line auger of the Leucospis can enter, is there  not room enough for the even slimmer Anthrax grub? True, the Leucospis  possesses muscular force and a hard boring tool. The Anthrax is  extremely weak and has nothing but invincible patience. It does at  great length of time what the other, furnished with superior implements,  accomplishes in three hours. This explains the fortnight spent by the  Anthrax under the initial form, the object of which is to overcome  the obstacle of the mason's wall, to pierce through the texture of the  cocoon and to reach the victuals.    I even believe that it takes longer. The work is so laborious and  the worker so feeble! I cannot tell how long it is since my bantlings  attained their object. Perhaps, aided by easy roads, they had reached  their fostering larvae long before the completion of their first  babyhood, the end of which they were spending before my eyes, with no  apparent purpose, in exploring their provisions. The time had not yet  come for them to change their skins and take their seats at the table.  Their fellows must still, for the most part, be wandering through the  pores of the masonry; and this was what made my search so vain at the  start.    A few facts seem to suggest that the entrance into the cell may be  delayed for several months by the difficulty of the passages. There are  a few Anthrax grubs beside the remains of pupae not far removed from the  final metamorphosis; there are others, but very rarely, on Mason bees  already in the perfect state. These grubs are sickly and appear to be  ailing; the provisions are too solid and do not lend themselves to  the delicate suckling of the worms. Who can these laggards be but  animalcules that have roamed too long in the walls of the nest? Failing  to make their entrance at the proper time, they no longer find viands to  suit them. The primary larva of the Sitaris continues from the autumn to  the following spring. Even so the initial form of the Anthrax might well  continue, not in inactivity, but in stubborn attempts to overcome the  thick bulwark.    My young worms, when transferred with their provisions into tubes,  remained stationary, on the average, for a couple of weeks. At last, I  saw them shrink and then rid themselves of their epidermis and become  the grub which I was so anxiously expecting as the final reply to all  my doubts. It was indeed, from the first, the grub of the Anthrax, the  cream-colored cylinder with the little button of a head, followed by  a hump. Applying its cupping glass to the mason bee, the worm, without  delay, began its meal, which lasts another fortnight. The reader knows  the rest.    Before taking leave of the animalcule, let us devote a few lines to its  instinct. It has just awakened to life under the fierce kisses of the  sun. The bare stone is its cradle, the rough clay its welcomer, as it  makes its entrance into the world, a poor thread of scarce cohering  albumen. But safety lies within; and behold the atom of animated glair  embarking on its struggle with the flint. Obstinately, it sounds each  pore; it slips in, crawls on, retreats, begins again. The radical of the  germinating seed is no more persevering in its efforts to descend into  the cool earth than is the Anthrax grub in creeping into the lump of  mortar. What inspiration urges it towards its food at the bottom of the  clod, what compass guides it? What does it know of those depths, of what  lies therein or where? Nothing. What does the root know of the earth's  fruitfulness? Again nothing. Yet both make for the nourishing spot.  Theories are put forward, most learned theories, introducing capillary  action, osmosis and cellular imbibition, to explain why the caulicle  ascends and the radical descends. Shall physical or chemical forces  explain why the animalcule digs into the hard clay? I bow profoundly,  without understanding or even trying to understand. The question is far  above, our inane means.    The biography of the Anthrax is now complete, save for the details  relating to the egg, as yet unknown. In the vast majority of insects  subject to metamorphoses, the hatching yields the larval form which  will remain unchanged until the nymphosis.

Three of these Old Hands were conversing together just behind the  partition of Dawes's bunk. As we have said, the berths were five feet  square, and each contained six men. No. 10, the berth occupied by Dawes,  was situated on the corner made by the joining of the starboard and  centre lines, and behind it was a slight recess, in which the scuttle  was fixed. His \"mates\" were at present but three in number, for John Rex  and the cockney tailor had been removed to the hospital. The three that  remained were now in deep conversation in the shelter of the recess. Of  these, the giant--who had the previous night asserted his authority  in the prison--seemed to be the chief. His name was Gabbett. He was  a returned convict, now on his way to undergo a second sentence  for burglary. The other two were a man named Sanders, known as the  \"Moocher\", and Jemmy Vetch, the Crow. They were talking in whispers, but  Rufus Dawes, lying with his head close to the partition, was enabled to  catch much of what they said.    At first the conversation turned on the catastrophe of the burning ship  and the likelihood of saving the crew. From this it grew to anecdote of  wreck and adventure, and at last Gabbett said something which made the  listener start from his indifferent efforts to slumber, into sudden  broad wakefulness.    It was the mention of his own name, coupled with that of the woman he  had met on the quarter-deck, that roused him.    \"I saw her speaking to Dawes yesterday,\" said the giant, with an oath.  \"We don't want no more than we've got. I ain't goin' to risk my neck for  Rex's woman's fancies, and so I'll tell her.\"    \"It was something about the kid,\" says the Crow, in his elegant slang.  \"I don't believe she ever saw him before. Besides, she's nuts on Jack,  and ain't likely to pick up with another man.\"    \"If I thort she was agoin' to throw us over, I'd cut her throat as soon  as look at her!\" snorts Gabbett savagely.    \"Jack ud have a word in that,\" snuffles the Moocher; \"and he's a curious  cove to quarrel with.\"    \"Well, stow yer gaff,\" grumbled Mr. Gabbett, \"and let's have no more  chaff. If we're for bizness, let's come to bizness.\"    \"What are we to do now?\" asked the Moocher. \"Jack's on the sick list,  and the gal won't stir a'thout him.\"    \"Ay,\" returned Gabbett, \"that's it.\"    \"My dear friends,\" said the Crow, \"my keyind and keristian friends, it  is to be regretted that when natur' gave you such tremendously thick  skulls, she didn't put something inside of 'em. I say that now's the  time. Jack's in the 'orspital; what of that? That don't make it no  better for him, does it? Not a bit of it; and if he drops his knife and  fork, why then, it's my opinion that the gal won't stir a peg. It's on  his account, not ours, that she's been manoovering, ain't it?\"    \"Well!\" says Mr. Gabbett, with the air of one who was but partly  convinced, \"I s'pose it is.\"    \"All the more reason of getting it off quick. Another thing, when the  boys know there's fever aboard, you'll see the rumpus there'll be.  They'll be ready enough to join us then. Once get the snapper chest, and  we're right as ninepenn'orth o' hapence.\"    This conversation, interspersed with oaths and slang as it was, had an  intense interest for Rufus Dawes. Plunged into prison, hurriedly tried,  and by reason of his surroundings ignorant of the death of his  father and his own fortune, he had hitherto--in his agony and sullen  gloom--held aloof from the scoundrels who surrounded him, and repelled  their hideous advances of friendship. He now saw his error. He knew that  the name he had once possessed was blotted out, that any shred of his  old life which had clung to him hitherto, was shrivelled in the fire  that consumed the \"Hydaspes\". The secret, for the preservation of  which Richard Devine had voluntarily flung away his name, and risked a  terrible and disgraceful death, would be now for ever safe; for Richard  Devine was dead--lost at sea with the crew of the ill-fated vessel in  which, deluded by a skilfully-sent letter from the prison, his mother  believed him to have sailed. Richard Devine was dead, and the secret of  his birth would die with him. Rufus Dawes, his alter ego, alone should  live. Rufus Dawes, the convicted felon, the suspected murderer, should  live to claim his freedom, and work out his vengeance; or, rendered  powerful by the terrible experience of the prison-sheds, should seize  both, in defiance of gaol or gaoler.    With his head swimming, and his brain on fire, he eagerly listened for  more. It seemed as if the fever which burnt in his veins had consumed  the grosser part of his sense, and given him increased power of hearing.  He was conscious that he was ill. His bones ached, his hands burned, his  head throbbed, but he could hear distinctly, and, he thought, reason on  what he heard profoundly.    \"But we can't stir without the girl,\" Gabbett said. \"She's got to stall  off the sentry and give us the orfice.\"    The Crow's sallow features lighted up with a cunning smile.    \"Dear old caper merchant! Hear him talk!\" said he, \"as if he had the  wisdom of Solomon in all his glory? Look here!\"    And he produced a dirty scrap of paper, over which his companions  eagerly bent their heads.    \"Where did yer get that?\"    \"Yesterday afternoon Sarah was standing on the poop throwing bits o'  toke to the gulls, and I saw her a-looking at me very hard. At last she  came down as near the barricade as she dared, and throwed crumbs and  such like up in the air over the side. By and by a pretty big lump,  doughed up round, fell close to my foot, and, watching a favourable  opportunity, I pouched it. Inside was this bit o' rag-bag.\"    \"Ah!\" said Mr. Gabbett, \"that's more like. Read it out, Jemmy.\"    The writing, though feminine in character, was bold and distinct. Sarah  had evidently been mindful of the education of her friends, and had  desired to give them as little trouble as possible.    \"All is right. Watch me when I come up to-morrow evening at three bells.  If I drop my handkerchief, get to work at the time agreed on. The sentry  will be safe.\"    Rufus Dawes, though his eyelids would scarcely keep open, and a terrible  lassitude almost paralysed his limbs, eagerly drank in the whispered  sentence. There was a conspiracy to seize the ship. Sarah Purfoy was  in league with the convicts--was herself the wife or mistress of one of  them. She had come on board armed with a plot for his release, and this  plot was about to be put in execution. He had heard of the atrocities  perpetrated by successful mutineers. Story after story of such nature  had often made the prison resound with horrible mirth. He knew the  characters of the three ruffians who, separated from him by but two  inches of planking, jested and laughed over their plans of freedom and  vengeance. Though he conversed but little with his companions, these men  were his berth mates, and he could not but know how they would proceed  to wreak their vengeance on their gaolers.    True, that the head of this formidable chimera--John Rex, the  forger--was absent, but the two hands, or rather claws--the burglar and  the prison-breaker--were present, and the slimly-made, effeminate Crow,  if he had not the brains of the master, yet made up for his flaccid  muscles and nerveless frame by a cat-like cunning, and a spirit of  devilish volatility that nothing could subdue. With such a powerful ally  outside as the mock maid-servant, the chance of success was enormously  increased. There were one hundred and eighty convicts and but fifty  soldiers. If the first rush proved successful--and the precautions taken  by Sarah Purfoy rendered success possible--the vessel was theirs.  Rufus Dawes thought of the little bright-haired child who had run so  confidingly to meet him, and shuddered.    \"There!\" said the Crow, with a sneering laugh, \"what do you think of  that? Does the girl look like nosing us now?\"    \"No,\" says the giant, stretching his great arms with a grin of delight,  as one stretches one's chest in the sun, \"that's right, that is. That's  more like bizness.\"    \"England, home and beauty!\" said Vetch, with a mock-heroic air,  strangely out of tune with the subject under discussion. \"You'd like to  go home again, wouldn't you, old man?\"    Gabbett turned on him fiercely, his low forehead wrinkled into a frown  of ferocious recollection.    \"You!\" he said--\"You think the chain's fine sport, don't yer? But I've  been there, my young chicken, and I knows what it means.\"    There was silence for a minute or two. The giant was plunged in gloomy  abstraction, and Vetch and the Moocher interchanged a significant  glance. Gabbett had been ten years at the colonial penal settlement of  Macquarie Harbour, and he had memories that he did not confide to his  companions. When he indulged in one of these fits of recollection, his  friends found it best to leave him to himself.    Rufus Dawes did not understand the sudden silence. With all his senses  stretched to the utmost to listen, the cessation of the whispered  colloquy affected him strangely. Old artillery-men have said that, after  being at work for days in the trenches, accustomed to the continued roar  of the guns, a sudden pause in the firing will cause them intense pain.  Something of this feeling was experienced by Rufus Dawes. His faculties  of hearing and thinking--both at their highest pitch--seemed to break  down. It was as though some prop had been knocked from under him. No  longer stimulated by outward sounds, his senses appeared to fail him.  The blood rushed into his eyes and ears. He made a violent, vain effort  to retain his consciousness, but with a faint cry fell back, striking  his head against the edge of the bunk.    The noise roused the burglar in an instant. There was someone in the  berth! The three looked into each other's eyes, in guilty alarm,"]]]
