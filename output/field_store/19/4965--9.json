With this explanation of the distinction  between the Jews as a people and Judaism as a system, we may employ  the terms \"Jews\" and \"Jewish\" according to common usage, keeping in  mind, however, the true signification of the terms.    9. Judaistic opposition to the Church was predicted. While Jesus  ministered in the flesh He specifically and repeatedly warned the  apostles of the persecution they would have to meet. In answering  certain inquiries Christ said to Peter and others: \"But take heed to  yourselves: for they shall deliver you up to councils, and in the  synagogues ye shall be beaten: and ye shall be brought before rulers  and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them.\"--(Mark 13:9;  compare Matt. 10:16-18; 24:9-13; Luke 21:12.)    10. Shortly before His betrayal the Lord repeated the warning with  solemn impressiveness, citing the persecutions to which He had been  subject, and declaring that His disciples could not escape: \"If the  world hate you, ye know that it hated me before it hated you. If ye  were of the world, the world would love his own; but because ye are  not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore  the world hateth you. Remember the word that I said unto you, The  servant is not greater than his lord. If they have persecuted me, they  will also persecute you.\"--(John 15:18-20.)    11. The extreme of depravity to which the bigoted persecutors would  sink is set forth in these further words of the Savior: \"They shall  put you out of the synagogues: yea, the time cometh, that whosoever  killeth you will think that he doeth God service. And these things  will they do unto you, because they have not known the Father, nor  me.\"--(John 16:2, 3; compare 9:22, and 12:42.)    12. These predictions had speedy and literal fulfilment. From the time  of the crucifixion, Jewish malignity and hatred were directed against  all who professed a belief in the divinity of Jesus Christ. In the  early stages of their ministry several of the apostles were  imprisoned--(Acts 5:18; compare 4:3.) and the priestly leaders sought  to take their lives.--(Acts 5:33.) Stephen was stoned to death because  of his testimony;--(See Acts 6:8-15; 7:54-60.) and the persecution  against the Church became general.--(See Acts 8:1.) James, the son of  Zebedee, was slain by order of Herod,--(Acts 12:1, 2.) and Peter was  saved from a similar fate only by a miraculous intervention.--(Verses  3:10.) The scriptural record informs us as to the ultimate fate of but  few of the apostles; and secular history is likewise incomplete. That  Peter would be numbered with the martyrs was made known by the  resurrected Lord.--(See John 21:18, 19.) Paul sets forth the fact that  the apostles lived in the very shadow of death--(I Cor. 4:9.) and that  persecution was their heritage.--(Verses 11-13; see also II Cor. 4:8,  9; 6:4, 5.)    13. Not only did the Jews wage relentless persecution against those of  their number who professed Christ, but they sought to stir up  opposition on the part of the Romans, and to accomplish this end  charged that the Christians were plotting treason against the Roman  government. Even during the personal ministry of the early apostles,  persecution of the saints had spread from Jerusalem, throughout  Palestine and into the adjacent provinces. In this evil work the Jews  sought to incite their own people living in the outlying parts, and  also to arouse the opposition of the officers and rulers of the Roman  dominions. As evidence of this phase of the persecution, partly Jewish  and partly pagan, instigated by Jews and participated in by others,  the following quotation from Mosheim may suffice:    14. \"The Jews who lived out of Palestine, in the Roman provinces, did  not yield to those of Jerusalem in point of cruelty to the innocent  disciples of Christ. We learn from the history of the Acts of the  Apostles, and other records of unquestionable authority, that they  spared no labor, but zealously seized every occasion of animating the  magistrates against the Christians, and setting on the multitude to  demand their destruction. The high priest of the nation and the Jews  who dwelt in Palestine were instrumental in inciting the rage of these  foreign Jews against the infant Church, by sending messengers to  exhort them, not only to avoid all intercourse with the Christians,  but also to persecute them in the most vehement manner. For this  inhuman order they endeavored to find out the most plausible pretexts;  and therefore, they gave out that the Christians were enemies to the  Roman emperor, since they acknowledged the authority of a certain  person whose name was Jesus, whom Pilate had punished capitally as a  malefactor by a most righteous sentence, and on whom, nevertheless,  they conferred the royal dignity.\"--(Mosheim, \"Ecclesiastical  History,\" Cent. I, Part I, 5:2.)    15. In the latter half of the first century, the scene of Judaistic  persecution of the church had shifted from Jerusalem to the outlying  provinces; and the cause of this was the general exodus of Christians  from the city whose destruction had been decreed.--(See Note 4, end of  chapter.) Our Lord's predictions as to the fate of Jerusalem and His  warnings to the people--(See Luke 21:5-9, 20-24.) had been very  generally heeded. Eusebius--(Eusebius, \"Ecclesiastical History,\" Book  III, ch. 5.) informs us that the body of the Church had moved from  Jerusalem into the provinces beyond the Jordan, and thus largely  escaped the calamities of the Jews who remained.      NOTES    1. _Persecution in Different Dispensations_. It may be argued that,  judging from the history of the re-established Church in the present  dispensation, may tend to strengthen rather than to weaken the Church,  and that therefore violent opposition in earlier times cannot be  considered a true cause leading to final disruption. In reply it may  be said that the present is the dispensation of the fulness of  times,--a period in which the Church shall triumph, and during which  the powers of evil are limited and restrained in their opposition;  whereas the period of the apostasy was one of temporary victory for  Satan. Our belief in the eventual triumph of good over evil must not  blind us to the fact that evil is frequently allowed a short-lived  success, and a seeming victory. The permanency of the Latter-day  Church has been not less surely predicted than was the temporary  duration of the Primitive Church. Satan was given power to overcome  the saints in former days, and the persecutions he waged against them  and the officers of the Church contributed to his passing success. It  has been decreed that he shall not have power to destroy the Church in  the last dispensation, and his persecution of the saints today will be  futile as a means of bringing about a general apostasy in these latter  times.    2. _Persecution as a Possible Cause of Apostasy_. \"Let it not be a  matter of surprise that I class those persecutions as among the means  through which the church was destroyed. The force of heathen rage was  aimed at the leaders and strong men of the body religious; and being  long-continued and relentlessly cruel, those most steadfast in their  adherence to the Church invariably became its victims. These being  stricken down, it left none but weaklings to contend for the faith,  and made possible those subsequent innovations in the religion of  Jesus which a pagan public sentiment demanded, and which so completely  changed both the spirit and form of the Christian religion as to  subvert it utterly. Let me further ask that no one be surprised that  violence is permitted to operate in such a case. The idea that the  right is always victorious in this world, that truth is always  triumphant and innocence always divinely protected, are old, fond  fables with which well-meaning men have amused credulous multitudes;  but the stern facts of history and actual experience in life correct  the pleasing delusion. Do not misunderstand me. I believe in the  ultimate victory of the right, the ultimate triumph of truth, the  final immunity of innocence from violence. These--innocence, truth and  the right--will be at the last more than conquerors; they will be  successful in the war, but that does not prevent them from losing some  battles. It should be remembered always that God has given to man his  agency; and that fact implies that one man is as free to act wickedly  as another is to do righteousness. Cain was as free to murder his  brother as that brother was to worship God; and so the pagans and Jews  were as free to persecute and murder the Christians as the Christians  were to live virtuously and worship Christ as God. The agency of man  would not be worth the name if it did not grant liberty to the wicked  to fill the cup of their iniquity, as well as liberty to the virtuous  to round out the measure of their righteousness. Such perfect liberty  or agency God has given man; and it is only so variously modified as  not so thwart His general purposes.\" (B. H. Roberts, \"A New Witness  for God,\" pp. 47, 48.)    3. _Early Persecutions by the Jews_. \"The innocence and virtue that  distinguished so eminently the lives of Christ's servants the  apostles, the purity of the doctrine they taught, were not sufficient  to defend them against the virulence and malignity of the Jews. The  priests and rulers of that abandoned people not only loaded with  injuries and reproach the apostles of Jesus and their disciples, but  condemned as many of them as they could to death, and executed in the  most irregular and barbarous manner their decrees. The murder of  Stephen, of James the son of Zebedee, and of James surnamed the Just,  bishop of Jerusalem, furnished dreadful examples of the truth of what  we here advance. "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35534"],[0,"How to be Happy Though Married: Being a Handbook to Marriage (#12)"],[1,"o'  taste: I rayther think it isn't.\" Strange that a philosopher of the  senior Mr. Weller's profundity should underestimate in this way the  value of matrimony as a teacher. We have it on the authority of a  widower who was thrice married, that his first wife cured his romance,  the second taught him humility, and the third made him a philosopher.  Another veteran believes that five or six years of married life will  often reduce a naturally irascible man to so angelic a condition that it  would hardly be safe to trust him with a pair of wings.    Webster asks--      \"What do you think of marriage?    I think, as those do who deny purgatory,    It locally contains either heaven or hell,    There is no third place in it.\"    Is this true? We think not, for we know many married people who live in  a third place, the existence of which is here denied. They are neither  intensely happy nor intensely miserable; but they lose many faults, and  are greatly developed in character by passing through a purgatorial  existence. Nor is this an argument against matrimony, except to those  who deny that \"it is better to be seven times in the furnace than to  come out unpurified.\"    Sweet are the uses of this and every other adversity when these words of  Sir Arthur Helps are applicable to its victims or rather victors: \"That  man is very strong and powerful who has no more hopes for himself, who  looks not to be loved any more, to be admired any more, to have any more  honour or dignity, and who cares not for gratitude; but whose sole  thought is for others, and who only lives on for them.\"    The young husband may imagine that he only takes a wife to add to his  own felicity; taking no account of the possibility of meeting a  disposition and temper which may, without caution, mar and blight his  own. Women are not angels, although in their ministrations they make a  near approach to them. Women, no more than men, are free from human  infirmities; the newly-married man must therefore calculate upon the  necessity of amendment in his wife as well as of that necessity in  himself. The process, however, as well as the result of the process,  will yield a rich reward. At a minister's festival meeting \"Our Wives\"  was one of the toasts. One of the brethren, whose wife had a temper of  her own, on being sportively asked if he would drink it, exclaimed,  \"Aye, heartily; Mine brings me to my knees in prayer a dizzen times a  day, an' nane o' you can say the same o' yours.\"    If even bad matrimonial bargains have so much influence in disciplining  character, how much more may be learned from a happy marriage! Without  it a man or woman is \"Scarce half made up.\" The enjoyments of celibacy,  whatever they may be, are narrow in their range, and belong to only a  portion of our nature; and whatever the excellences of the bachelor's  character, he can never attain to a perfected manhood so long as such a  large and important part of his nature as the affections for the  gratification of which marriage provides, is unexercised and  undeveloped. There are in his nature latent capabilities, both of  enjoyment and affection, which find no expression. He is lacking in  moral symmetry. The motives from which he keeps himself free from  marriage responsibilities may be worthy of the highest respect, but this  does not hinder his character from being less disciplined than it might  have been.                         \"For indeed I know    Of no more subtle master under heaven    Than is the maiden passion for a maid,    Not only to keep down the base in man,    But teach high thoughts and amiable words,    And love of truth, and all that makes a man.\"    On both sides marriage brings into play some of the purest and loftiest  feelings of which our nature is capable. The feeling of identity of  interest implied in the marriage relation--the mutual confidence which  is the natural result--the tender, chivalrous regard of the husband for  his wife as one who has given herself to him--the devotion and respect  of the wife for the husband as one to whom she has given herself--their  mutual love attracted first by the qualities seen or imagined by each in  the other, and afterwards strengthened by the consciousness of being  that object's best beloved--these feelings exert a purifying, refining,  elevating influence, and are more akin to the religious than any other  feelings. Love, like all things here, is education. It renders us wise  by expanding the soul and stimulating the mental powers.      \"Yes, love indeed is light from heaven:      A spark of that immortal fire    With angels shared, by Allah given,      To lift from earth our low desire.    Devotion wafts the mind above,    But heaven itself descends in love;    A feeling from the Godhead caught,    To wean from self each sordid thought;    A ray of Him who formed the whole;    A glory circling round the soul!\"    It has been well said, \"The first condition of human goodness is  something to love; the second, something to reverence.\" Both these  conditions meet in a well-chosen alliance.    Married people may so abuse matrimony as to make it a very school for  scandal; but it may and ought to be what Sir Thomas More's home was said  to be, \"a school and exercise of the Christian religion.\" \"No wrangling,  no angry word, was heard in it; no one was idle; every one did his duty  with alacrity and not without a temperate cheerfulness.\" This atmosphere  of love and duty which pervaded his home must have been owing in a great  measure to the household goodness of Sir Thomas himself. For though his  first wife was all that he could have desired, his second was  ill-tempered and little capable of appreciating the lofty principles  that actuated her husband. \"I have lived--I have laboured--I have loved.  I have lived in them I loved, laboured for them I loved, loved them for  whom I laboured.\" Well might Sir Thomas add after this reflection, \"My  labour hath not been in vain;\" for to say nothing of its effect upon  others, how it must have disciplined his own character!    \"There is nothing,\" you say, \"in the drudgery of domestic life to  soften.\" No; but, as Robertson of Brighton says, \"a great deal to  strengthen with the sense of duty done, self-control, and power. Besides  you cannot calculate how much corroding rust is kept off, how much of  disconsolate, dull despondency is hindered. Daily use is not the  jeweller's mercurial polish, but it will keep your little silver pencil  from tarnishing.\"    \"Family life,\" says Sainte-Beuve, \"may be full of thorns and cares; but  they are fruitful: all others are dry thorns.\" And again: \"If a man's  home at a certain period of life does not contain children, it will  probably be found filled with follies or with vices.\"    Even if it were a misfortune to be married, which we emphatically deny,  has not the old Roman moralist taught us that, \"to escape misfortune is  to want instruction, and that to live at ease is to live in ignorance\"?  Misfortune to be married? Rather not.      \"Life with all it yields of joy and woe    And hope and fear....    Is just our chance o' the prize of the learning love--    How love might be, hath been indeed, and is.\"          CHAPTER VIII.    BEING MARRIED.         \"If ever one is to pray--if ever one is to feel grave and       anxious--if ever one is to shrink from vain show and vain babble,       surely it is just on the occasion of two human beings binding       themselves to one another, for better and for worse till death       part them.\"--_Letters and Memorials of Jane Welsh Carlyle._      An elderly unmarried lady of Scotland, after reading aloud to her two  sisters, also unmarried, the births, marriages, and deaths in the  ladies' corner of a newspaper, thus moralized: \"Weel, weel, these are  solemn events--death and marriage; but ye ken they're what we must all  come to.\" \"Eh, Miss Jeanny, but ye have been lang spared!\" was the reply  of the youngest sister. Those who in our thoughts were represented as  being only in prospect of marriage are spared no longer. They have now  come to what they had to come to--a day \"so full of gladness, and so  full of pain\"--a day only second in importance to the day of birth; in  a word, to their wedding day.                          \"Are [they] sad or merry?    Like to the time o' the year between the extremes    Of hot and cold: [they are] nor sad nor merry.\"    And yet few on such a day are as collected as the late Duke of  Sutherland is said to have been. Just two hours before the time fixed  for his marriage with one of the most beautiful women in England, a  friend came upon him in St. James's Park, leaning carelessly over the  railings at the edge of the water, throwing crumbs to the waterfowl.  \"What! you here to-day! I thought you were going to be married this  morning?\" \"Yes,\" replied the duke, without moving an inch or stopping  his crumb-throwing, \"I believe I am.\"    To men of a shyer and more nervous temperament, to be married without  chloroform is a very painful operation. They find it difficult to screw  their courage to the marrying place. On one occasion a bridegroom so far  forgot what was due to himself and his bride as to render himself unfit  to take the vows through too frequent recourse on the wedding morn to  the cup that cheers--and inebriates. The minister was obliged to refuse  to proceed with the marriage. A few days later, the same thing occurred  with the same couple; whereupon the minister gravely remonstrated with  the bride, and said they must not again present themselves with the  bridegroom in such a state. \"But, sir, he--_he winna come when he's  sober_,\" was the candid rejoinder. It is possible that this bridegroom,  whose courage was so very Dutch, might have been deterred by the  impending fuss and publicity of a marriage ceremony, rather than by any  fear of or want of affection for her who was to become his wife.
