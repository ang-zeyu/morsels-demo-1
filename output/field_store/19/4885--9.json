The muscle 22  elevates the ribs in inspiration.]    159. The diaphragm, or midriff, is the muscular division between the  thorax and the abdomen. It is penetrated by the oesophagus on its way  to the stomach, by the aorta conveying blood toward the lower  extremity, and by the ascending vena cava, or vein, on its way to the  heart.

The finer and  more delicate movements of the fingers are performed by small muscles  situated in the palm and between the bones of the hand, and by which  the fingers are expanded and moved in all directions with wonderful  rapidity.\"    [Illustration: Fig. 43.

Where are the muscles situated that effect the larger movements  of the hand? That perform the delicate movements of the fingers? Give  the use of some of the muscles represented by fig. 43. Those  represented by fig. 44.      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=          CHAPTER IX.    PHYSIOLOGY OF THE MUSCLES.      161. The muscles exercise great influence upon the system. It is by  their contraction that we are enabled to pursue different employments.  By their action the farmer cultivates his fields, the mechanic wields  his tools, the sportsman pursues his game, the orator gives utterance  to his thoughts, the lady sweeps the keys of the piano, and the young  are whirled in the mazy dance. As the muscles bear so intimate a  relation to the pleasures and employments of man, a knowledge of the  laws by which their action is governed, and the conditions upon which  their health depends, should be possessed by all.    162. The peculiar characteristic of muscular fibres is _contractility_,  or the power of shortening their substance on the application of  stimuli, and again relaxing when the stimulus is withdrawn. This is  illustrated in the most common movements of life. Call into action the  muscles that elevate the arm, by the influence of the _will_, or mind,  (the common stimulus of the muscles,) and the hand and arm are  raised; withdraw this influence by a simple effort of the will, and  the muscles, before rigid and tense, become relaxed and yielding.    163. The contractile effect of the muscles, in producing the varied  movements of the system, may be seen in the bending of the elbow.  The tendon of one extremity of the muscle is attached to the  shoulder-bone, which acts as a fixed point; the tendon of the  other extremity is attached to one of the bones of the fore-arm. When  the swell of the muscle contracts, or shortens, its two extremities  approach nearer each other, and by the approximation of the  terminal extremities of the muscle, the joint at the elbow bends.  On this principle, all the joints of the system are moved. This is  illustrated by fig. 45.      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    161-172. _Give the physiology of the muscles._ 161. What are some of  the influences exerted by the muscles on the system? 162. What is  peculiar to muscular fibres? How is this illustrated? 163. Explain how  the movements of the system are effected by the contraction of the  muscles.      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    [Illustration: Fig. 45. A representation of the manner in which all of  the joints of the body are moved. 1, The bone of the arm above the elbow.  2, One of the bones below the elbow. 3, The muscle that bends the elbow.  This muscle is united, by a tendon, to the bone below the elbow, (4,) at  the other extremity, to the bone above the elbow, (5,) 6, The muscle that  extends the elbow. 7, Its attachment to the point of the elbow. 8, A  weight in the hand to be raised. The central part of the muscle 3  contracts, and its two ends are brought nearer together. The bones below  the elbow are brought to the lines shown by 9, 10, 11. The weight is  raised in the direction of the curved line. When the muscle 6 contracts,  the muscle 3 relaxes and the fore-arm is extended.]    _Experiments._ 1st. Clasp the arm midway between the shoulder and  elbow, with the thumb and fingers of the opposite hand. When the arm  is bent, the inside muscle will become hard and prominent, and its  tendon at the elbow rigid, while the muscle on the opposite side will  become flaccid. Extend the arm at the elbow, and the outside muscle  will swell and become firm, while the inside muscle and its tendon at  the elbow will be relaxed.      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    Explain fig. 45. Give experiment 1st.      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    2d. Clasp the fore-arm about three inches below the elbow, then open  and shut the fingers rapidly, and the swelling and relaxation of the  muscles on the opposite sides of the arms, alternating with each  other, will be felt, corresponding with the movement of the fingers.  While the fingers are bending, the inside muscles swell, and the  outside ones become flaccid; and, while the fingers are extending, the  inside muscles relax, and the outside ones swell. The alternate  swelling and relaxation of antagonist muscles may be felt in the  different movements of the limbs.    164. Each fibre of the several muscles receives from the brain, through  the nervous filament appropriated to it, a certain influence, called  nervous fluid, or stimulus. It is this that induces contraction, while  the suspension of this stimulus causes relaxation of the fibres. By  this arrangement, the action of the muscular system, both as regards  duration and power, is, to a limited extent, under the control of the  mind.

Wherefore, I deem that an enemy hath cast the  shadow of me on the air of that land.\"    \"Yea, my Lady,\" said Walter; \"and what enemy mightest thou have to have  done this?\"    She was slow of answer, but spake at last from a quivering mouth of  anger: \"Knowest thou not the saw, that a man's foes are they of his own  house?  If I find out for a truth who hath done this, the said enemy  shall have an evil hour with me.\"    Again she was silent, and she clenched her hands and strained her limbs  in the heat of her anger; so that Walter was afraid of her, and all his  misgivings came back to his heart again, and he repented that he had told  her so much.  But in a little while all that trouble and wrath seemed to  flow off her, and again was she of good cheer, and kind and sweet to him  and she said: \"But in sooth, however it may be, I thank thee, my Squire  and friend, for telling me hereof.  And surely no wyte do I lay on thee.  And, moreover, is it not this vision which hath brought thee hither?\"    \"So it is, Lady,\" said he.    \"Then have we to thank it,\" said the Lady, \"and thou art welcome to our  land.\"    And therewith she held out her hand to him, and he took it on his knees  and kissed it: and then it was as if a red-hot iron had run through his  heart, and he felt faint, and bowed down his head.  But he held her hand  yet, and kissed it many times, and the wrist and the arm, and knew not  where he was.    But she drew a little away from him, and arose and said: \"Now is the day  wearing, and if we are to bear back any venison we must buckle to the  work.  So arise, Squire, and take the hounds and come with me; for not  far off is a little thicket which mostly harbours foison of deer, great  and small.  Let us come our ways.\"          CHAPTER XV: THE SLAYING OF THE QUARRY      So they walked on quietly thence some half a mile, and ever the Lady  would have Walter to walk by her side, and not follow a little behind  her, as was meet for a servant to do; and she touched his hand at whiles  as she showed him beast and fowl and tree, and the sweetness of her body  overcame him, so that for a while he thought of nothing save her.    Now when they were come to the thicket-side, she turned to him and said:  \"Squire, I am no ill woodman, so that thou mayst trust me that we shall  not be brought to shame the second time; and I shall do sagely; so nock  an arrow to thy bow, and abide me here, and stir not hence; for I shall  enter this thicket without the hounds, and arouse the quarry for thee;  and see that thou be brisk and clean-shooting, and then shalt thou have a  reward of me.\"    Therewith she drew up her skirts through her girdle again, took her bent  bow in her hand, and drew an arrow out of the quiver, and stepped lightly  into the thicket, leaving him longing for the sight of her, as he  hearkened to the tread of her feet on the dry leaves, and the rustling of  the brake as she thrust through it.    Thus he stood for a few minutes, and then he heard a kind of gibbering  cry without words, yet as of a woman, coming from the thicket, and while  his heart was yet gathering the thought that something had gone amiss, he  glided swiftly, but with little stir, into the brake.    He had gone but a little way ere he saw the Lady standing there in a  narrow clearing, her face pale as death, her knees cleaving together, her  body swaying and tottering, her hands hanging down, and the bow and arrow  fallen to the ground; and ten yards before her a great-headed yellow  creature crouching flat to the earth and slowly drawing nigher.    He stopped short; one arrow was already notched to the string, and  another hung loose to the lesser fingers of his string-hand.  He raised  his right hand, and drew and loosed in a twinkling; the shaft flew close  to the Lady's side, and straightway all the wood rung with a huge roar,  as the yellow lion turned about to bite at the shaft which had sunk deep  into him behind the shoulder, as if a bolt out of the heavens had smitten  him.  But straightway had Walter loosed again, and then, throwing down  his bow, he ran forward with his drawn sword gleaming in his hand, while  the lion weltered and rolled, but had no might to move forward.  Then  Walter went up to him warily and thrust him through to the heart, and  leapt aback, lest the beast might yet have life in him to smite; but he  left his struggling, his huge voice died out, and he lay there moveless  before the hunter.    Walter abode a little, facing him, and then turned about to the Lady, and  she had fallen down in a heap whereas she stood, and lay there all  huddled up and voiceless.  So he knelt down by her, and lifted up her  head, and bade her arise, for the foe was slain.  And after a little she  stretched out her limbs, and turned about on the grass, and seemed to  sleep, and the colour came into her face again, and it grew soft and a  little smiling.  Thus she lay awhile, and Walter sat by her watching her,  till at last she opened her eyes and sat up, and knew him, and smiling on  him said: \"What hath befallen, Squire, that I have slept and dreamed?\"    He answered nothing, till her memory came back to her, and then she  arose, trembling and pale, and said: \"Let us leave this wood, for the  Enemy is therein.\"    And she hastened away before him till they came out at the thicket-side  whereas the hounds had been left, and they were standing there uneasy and  whining; so Walter coupled them, while the Lady stayed not, but went away  swiftly homeward, and Walter followed.    At last she stayed her swift feet, and turned round on Walter, and said:  \"Squire, come hither.\"    So did he, and she said: \"I am weary again; let us sit under this quicken-  tree, and rest us.\"    So they sat down, and she sat looking between her knees a while; and at  last she said: \"Why didst thou not bring the lion's hide?\"    He said: \"Lady, I will go back and flay the beast, and bring on the  hide.\"    And he arose therewith, but she caught him by the skirts and drew him  down, and said: \"Nay, thou shalt not go; abide with me.  Sit down again.\"    He did so, and she said: \"Thou shalt not go from me; for I am afraid: I  am not used to looking on the face of death.\"    She grew pale as she spoke, and set a hand to her breast, and sat so a  while without speaking.  At last she turned to him smiling, and said:  \"How was it with the aspect of me when I stood before the peril of the  Enemy?\"  And she laid a hand upon his.    \"O gracious one,\" quoth he, \"thou wert, as ever, full lovely, but I  feared for thee.\"    She moved not her hand from his, and she said: \"Good and true Squire, I  said ere I entered the thicket e'en now that I would reward thee if thou  slewest the quarry.  He is dead, though thou hast left the skin behind  upon the carcase.  Ask now thy reward, but take time to think what it  shall be.\"    He felt her hand warm upon his, and drew in the sweet odour of her  mingled with the woodland scents under the hot sun of the afternoon, and  his heart was clouded with manlike desire of her.  And it was a near  thing but he had spoken, and craved of her the reward of the freedom of  her Maid, and that he might depart with her into other lands; but as his  mind wavered betwixt this and that, the Lady, who had been eyeing him  keenly, drew her hand away from him; and therewith doubt and fear flowed  into his mind, and he refrained him of speech.    Then she laughed merrily and said: \"The good Squire is shamefaced; he  feareth a lady more than a lion.  Will it be a reward to thee if I bid  thee to kiss my cheek?\"    Therewith she leaned her face toward him, and he kissed her  well-favouredly, and then sat gazing on her, wondering what should betide  to him on the morrow.    Then she arose and said: \"Come, Squire, and let us home; be not abashed,  there shall be other rewards hereafter.\"    So they went their ways quietly; and it was nigh sunset against they  entered the house again.  Walter looked round for the Maid, but beheld  her not; and the Lady said to him: \"I go to my chamber, and now is thy  service over for this day.\"    Then she nodded to him friendly and went her ways.          CHAPTER XVI: OF THE KING'S SON AND THE MAID      But as for Walter, he went out of the house again, and fared slowly over  the woodlawns till he came to another close thicket or brake; he entered  from mere wantonness, or that he might be the more apart and hidden, so  as to think over his case.  There he lay down under the thick boughs, but  could not so herd his thoughts that they would dwell steady in looking  into what might come to him within the next days; rather visions of those  two women and the monster did but float before him, and fear and desire  and the hope of life ran to and fro in his mind.    As he lay thus he heard footsteps drawing near, and he looked between the  boughs, and though the sun had just set, he could see close by him a man  and a woman going slowly, and they hand in hand; at first he deemed it  would be the King's Son and the Lady, but presently he saw that it was  the King's Son indeed, but that it was the Maid whom he was holding by  the hand.  And now he saw of him that his eyes were bright with desire,  and of her that she was very pale.  Yet when he heard her begin to speak,  it was in a steady voice that she said: \"King's Son, thou hast threatened  me oft and unkindly, and now thou threatenest me again, and no less  unkindly.  But whatever were thy need herein before, now is there no more  need; for my Mistress, of whom thou wert weary, is now grown weary of  thee, and belike will not now reward me for drawing thy love to me, as  once"]]]
