The season during which the adult warble flies and nostril flies harass  the Caribou probably lasts only a few weeks in July and August. While  the adults evidently cause no pain, they no doubt arouse an instinctive  dread in the prospective hosts of their larvae. While I have no  information as to whether they follow the hosts into the wooded country,  it would appear quite likely that they do so if we are to credit  statements by Franklin (1823: 242), Richardson (1829: 251), and B. R.  Ross (1861: 438) that these pests infest the Woodland Caribou as well as  the Barren Ground species. Furthermore, _Cephenemyia_ has been reported  in Pennsylvania as a parasite of the White-tailed Deer (_Odocoileus_)  (Stewart, 1930?). The scarcity of available study material may be judged  from the fact that the Canadian Arctic Expedition of 1913-18 secured  only three adults of _Oedemagena_ and none of _Cephenemyia_ (Malloch,  1919: 55-56).    From the foregoing it may be seen that the wooded country represents a  virtually fly-free haven for the Barren Ground Caribou during nearly ten  months of the year. Is it any wonder, then, that they hasten throughout  August toward or into the shelter of the woods, to gain freedom from the  winged scourges of the Barrens? (See also _Retrograde autumnal  movement_.)    In the spring migration of 1947 the last of the Caribou passed the Windy  River area on July 1, just before the mosquitoes and black flies had  become seriously troublesome. It might be surmised that the animals keep  marching northward in advance of the appearance of these flies, as long  as that is feasible; and that when fairly overwhelmed by the winged  hordes, they desist from further progress in that direction. The fawns  are born at such a time (in late May or June) as to pass their first few  tender weeks before becoming subject to serious insect attacks.    (See also _Retrograde autumnal movement_; _Relations to flies_.)      _References._--Richardson, \"1825\": 328-329; Hoare, 1930: 33,    37-38; Jacobi, 1931: 193-195; Soper, 1936: 429; Hamilton, 1939:    247, 301; Clarke, 1940: 95-96; Porsild, 1943: 389; Banfield,    1951a: 27-29.      _Effect of combined environmental factors on distribution_    The sum total of environmental factors apparently makes the Barren  Grounds a distinctly more favorable summer habitat for the present  species than the wooded country, since the latter region is virtually  entirely deserted at that season. In general, the wooded country must be  a more favorable winter habitat, since the bulk of the animals evidently  resort to it at that time; yet its advantages are by no means clear-cut  or overwhelming, since a very considerable proportion of the Caribou  elect to spend the winter on the Barrens (Hanbury, 1904: 93, 120, 139;  Hoare, 1930: 22; Clarke, 1940: 8-9, 11, fig. 4; Anonymous, 1952: 267).      _Relations to man_    The Caribou dominates the thoughts, the speech, and the general human  activities of the Barren Grounds. As the chief food resource of that  region and the adjacent timbered country, it plays a highly important  role in the economy of both primitive and civilized man. As long as  those regions were occupied only by native Eskimos and Indians,  employing such primitive weapons as bows and spears, the species was in  no danger. Its vast numbers were maintained steadily from generation to  generation, and were perhaps limited only by the grazing or browsing  capacity of their range.    With the advent of civilized man and the placing of firearms in the  hands of the natives, the situation has deteriorated at a rate that  becomes accelerated with the passage of time. If it had not been for the  encroachment of civilization and the introduction of its instruments of  destruction, the natives would have been assured of a proper meat supply  for an indefinite period. Here and there some of them would miss a  caribou migration and starve to death; yet the animals have been so  generally available that many of the natives even today lack the  foresight to put up an adequate supply of fish as an alternative winter  food.    Almost everywhere the annual slaughter is both excessive and wasteful.  Few inhabitants of the North, whether native or white, stay their hands  while Caribou are present and ammunition is available. There is undue  reliance on a continuation of past abundance, and an indifference to the  welfare or rights of posterity. The whole culture of the inland Eskimos  and the northern Indians (the Caribou-eater Chipewyans in particular) is  so thoroughly based upon Caribou that the decimation of these animals  would mean a fundamental modification or virtual extermination of their  culture.    The average trapper of the Barren Grounds apparently aims at killing  annually at least 100 Caribou. Only a small portion is required to feed  himself and his family. The rest is designed for use as fox bait and dog  feed. In September he goes over his trap-line, perhaps 100 miles long,  and endeavors to kill Caribou at convenient intervals throughout its  length. (In October, 1944, a single trapper killed 90 during two days of  a big movement.) The animals are left where they fall. Presently spells  of warm weather may render the meat unsuitable for any one with more  fastidious tastes than a hardy man of the Barrens. In any event, the  beasts of the field evidently get the lion's share, even when the  trapper endeavors to cover the carcasses with rocks or spruces. Bears,  Wolves, Foxes, Weasels, Wolverines, Lemmings, Rough-legged Hawks,  Ravens, and Canada Jays help themselves to the free feast. Bears in  particular are likely to consume the whole carcass; in the autumns of  1944 and 1947 they thus disposed of about 70 and 40 caribou bodies,  respectively, within a few miles of the Windy River post. If the season  turns out to be a particularly poor one for Arctic Foxes, the trapper  may abandon his trap-line for that winter, and dozens or scores of  Caribou will have been sacrificed in vain.    Fish, which are available in abundance nearly everywhere, would serve  well enough for both fox bait and dog feed. But the average trapper  prefers to secure Caribou--a less laborious matter than putting up a  winter's supply of fish; at the same time he may admit that fish are  easier to handle in feeding and are preferable from that point of view.  Charles Schweder has rarely found Caribou along his trap-line between  the upper Kazan River and Dubawnt Lake. By using fish (out of the Little  Dubawnt River) for fox bait, he avoids the necessity of making an early  fall trip over that long distance to secure Caribou for his winter  operations. A trapper from northern Manitoba informed me that the local  Indians were complying with a recent government regulation that each  owner must put up a certain number of fish for the consumption of his  dogs--but, they were still feeding them with Caribou. The Split Lake  band of Indians on the Nelson River, Manitoba, were reported to have  killed 4,000 of the animals during the winter of 1946-47; the greater  part of these were utilized ingloriously as dog feed.    The hunting of such an extraordinarily unwary animal as the Barren  Ground Caribou calls for extremely little skill. Scarcely anything more  is required of the hunter (at least in southwestern Keewatin) than to  place himself on their line of march and to await their arrival. No  concealment is necessary, but quick movements are to be avoided, and the  direction of the wind should be such that it will not carry the dread  human scent to the animals. Even in perfectly open terrain one may  generally walk slowly up to within shooting distance of resting Caribou.  But if they are on the march and have already gone past, the hunter may  not succeed in getting close to them. Pursuing them on the run is likely  to send them off in a panic. (There is some evidence that on the Arctic  Coast and in the Barren Grounds of Mackenzie, where hunters are probably  more numerous than in southwestern Keewatin, the Caribou are usually  much more wary--_cf._ Amundsen, 1908, +1+: 103; Stefánsson, 1913b:  278; Blanchet, 1925: 34; Ingstad, 1933: 88.) In the section on  _Disposition_ the destruction of about a quarter of a herd of 100 or  more by a single hunter is described. On September 9 an Eskimo boy  killed 13. On November 3 eight out of a herd of 50 were secured by  another hunter in a few minutes' time. During the autumn migration of  1947 one of the Eskimos on the upper Kazan had killed 85 before the end  of September. This band of Eskimos is said to have once slaughtered 500  animals, half of them in the river, where they did not even bother to  pull them out; they had killed for the sheer delight of killing rather  than for utilization. It is customary for them to spear more animals  than they shoot. A trader's family in the Nueltin Lake region used to  kill 500 Caribou per year for their own use and for their 23 dogs. In  one instance a number of Caribou were shot from across a river; several  hours elapsed before a canoe became available, and by that time the  bodies were frozen so stiff that no attempt was made to use them. It was  reported that tractor crews operating between Reindeer Lake and Flin  Flon brought out many hind quarters to sell illegally at the latter  point, leaving other parts of the bodies along the way. In the winter of  1944-45 Nueltin Lake was said to have been covered with the bodies of  Caribou that the Chipewyans had shot for \"fun\" and had neglected to  utilize. It was also reported that in May, 1947, there were many  neglected bodies in the vicinity of Duck Lake, the local Chipewyans  having killed the animals during the previous fall; meanwhile the spring"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33767"],[0,"Campward Ho! A Manual for Girl Scout Camps (#12)"],[1,"other boat or boats are on patrol.    Under no circumstances should these boats be used for anything but  life-saving duty.    _Ring Buoys._ Ring buoys should be placed on every dock. These should  not be over nineteen inches in diameter, and should be equipped with  sixty feet of 1/4\" line with a float or \"lemon\" on end. Ring buoys are  valueless unless ready at all times for use, so should be mounted on a  rack the shape of a cross, painted red, having a peg, 5\" long, on the  end of each arm, for the rope to be loosely coiled around. The top loop  of the buoy hangs on the top peg. By this arrangement, the buoy is  always ready for use.    Water glasses, first aid equipment, grappling irons, and extra boat  equipment, such as oars, rowlocks, and boat hooks, should be kept on  hand ready for instant use.    _Row Boats and Canoes._ All row boats should be placed in first class  condition and tested out to find their safety capacity. The way to  determine this is to fill the boat full of water and find out how many  it will support in the water holding on to sides; this then is the safe  number to carry in the boat when free from water. If boats are equipped  with a small air-tight compartment of metal in bow and stern, it will  increase their buoyancy to a great extent. Every boat should be plainly  marked: THE CAPACITY OF THIS BOAT IS..., with white paint on both sides.      The Life Saving Corps    _Choosing the Crew._ Every camp should build up around its Master of  Aquatics a Life Saving Corps from among the campers. Choosing the  personnel of the Corps is a very important matter. The applicants should  understand that it is an honor to be a member of this unit.    [Illustration: THE GOODNIGHT STORY]    It will be found that if the members of the Corps are allowed to have  separate sleeping quarters, near the water, over which they fly the Red  Cross Life Saving Corps flag, mess together and be relieved of K. P.  duty, that they will develop an esprit de corps which will make for  efficiency in their work and be of great value to the general morale of  the camp.    Everyone trying for membership should first have a medical examination  to prove that he is physically able to stand the very difficult work  which he may have to perform at any time. The group of applicants should  then be tested out as to their swimming ability, especially being  required to swim on back without hands, and on side with one arm only.    _Training._ After your applicants have been culled out, the ones that  you decide to use should be given a thorough course of training, first  being obliged to pass the Red Cross life saving test. They must be  instructed in boat handling and the methods of taking another person  into the boat, in the proper method of throwing the life buoy, using a  60-foot line and a 19-inch buoy. They should be capable of tying knots  needed in their work, such as a square knot, clove hitch, two half  hitches, bowline, short splice and eye splice. Much emphasis should be  placed on instruction in resuscitation by the Schaefer method, and no  attempt should be made to instruct them in the use of any mechanical  respiratory devices as they are practically useless.    During the camp season, if possible, members should have thorough  instruction in first aid, especially as it applies to water accidents,  the most common of which are abrasions, sun burn, seasickness, broken  arms from backfire of gasoline engines, sickness from gasoline fumes of  motor boat engines, and submersion.    _Duties of Crew._ The Life Saving Corps should be familiar with the  water at all points and should buoy any especially dangerous spots, such  as submerged tree stumps or very deep holes. This can be done with a  line, anchor, and float painted red.    The Life Saving Corps should be in charge of Mates under the command of  the Master of Aquatics who is the Captain. A log of each day's work  should be kept, recording such events as concern the Corps, such as  weather report, officer in charge of day's watch, number of swimmers,  name of day's swimming instructor, number taught to swim, etc. Watches  should be so arranged that members of crew are not on duty more than two  days out of three.    [Illustration: \"GOOD MORROW, LORD SUN!\"]    During the bathing periods, which should be at least two hours after  meals, the Corps members will be in charge of the protection and  discipline of bathers, the instruction of swimming, and supervision of  diving.    The following is suggested as a good distribution. Two in each life  boat, oarsman and coxswain, one person on the dock, two lookouts and  messenger in the tower, one at diving board and one or two instructing  swimming (change instructors every third day).    _The Swimming Test._ After every camper has had a medical examination he  should have a test in swimming and be graded in one of three classes:  Non-Swimmer, red knot on right shoulder; Beginner--the ones that will  still bear watching--white knot on right shoulder; Swimmer, American Red  Cross Junior Life Saving Corps emblem.    Check your list up every once in a while to see that everybody is in the  right class. Hold frequent tests to re-classify two lower grades. The  graded Red Cross tests are recommended and arrangements can be made for  Red Cross awards.      Supervision of Boating    A Non-Swimmer should never be allowed to take out a boat unless  accompanied by a swimmer. The Beginners should be limited in the  distance they can go and only the Swimmers should be allowed to go where  they please. At least two-thirds of every boat load should be able to  swim and take care of those who cannot swim.    Under no circumstances allow more than one boat to be towed behind a  motor or sail boat, and then only if boat being towed is in hands of an  expert coxswain.    No boating should be allowed during bathing periods.    Detail one of the crew to give instructions in boat handling if  necessary.    Have all boats in by \"Mess gear\" unless special permission is given.    No boating after dark without special permission.    Every camper should know how to tie up a boat, if he wishes to use them.  See that he does it.    A simple set of rules may be drawn up and posted in prominent places so  that every camper will know exactly what the bathing regulations are.  The following are a few suggestions. No one is allowed to swim for at  least two hours after meals. No swimming allowed in the heat of the day.  No one is allowed to swim if he has any stomach disorder. A limit set  on number allowed in boats. No boats loaded with campers allowed to be  towed behind motor boats. Absolutely no swimming to be permitted unless  life boat is on hand for protection of bathers.    Of course these rules may be modified to suit each camp's local  problems, but if these suggestions are adhered to in the main, it will  be almost impossible for any accidents to happen.    One accidental drowning case may ruin the reputation of a camp. Build up  the confidence of your campers and their families by making your safety  system as near foolproof as possible.    _Send every camper home a swimmer; and, if possible, able to swim for  two._    _For information about life saving, write American Red Cross Life Saving  Corps, 44 East 23rd St., New York City._    [Illustration: MONARCHS OF ALL THEY SURVEY]          VIII.    THE CAMP PROGRAM      The program is one of the most important factors in the well-organized  camp and must be given much thought. It is the thing which gives  continuity to the summer's work and holds the entire group together.  Without it there would be disorder and confusion.    While including as many activities as possible without causing any  feeling of hurry, rush or forcing, it must be planned so that repetition  will not prove monotonous. It should provide for periods of work and  play, rest and leisure; it must afford ample opportunity for  self-expression and development. Parts of the program must necessarily  be obligatory for all, others optional, still others optional as to time  only.    The fact that the group is composed of Scouts and is living out of doors  should bring to the fore, subjects for study which are particularly in  keeping with the Scout program, such as nature lore, simple astronomy,  woodcraft, campcraft, carpentry, gardening, hiking, map-making, swimming  and boating; Scout grade test requirements, and some of the Merit Badge  work. Specific directions for teaching these subjects are not given  here, as they are covered in the Handbook, \"Scouting for Girls,\" and  other publications.    Periods for play may include games, group singing, rowing, hikes,  entertainments, and so forth. Leisure moments are for the individual.  She should be allowed to follow her own inclination so long as she does  not infringe upon the rights of others or break the necessary camp rules  which protect the safety and health of the group. Hours of rest which  all observe at stated periods are, of course, most essential. While a  daily program is absolutely necessary as a basis of work, it should  occasionally be put one side to allow the entire group to take advantage  of particularly propitious weather conditions for walking and hiking, or  for an entertainment or field day. The daily program in every Girl Scout  camp should always include the formal ceremony of raising and lowering  the flag, inspection, a period of rest directly after dinner, a period  for the discussion of the Scout Promise and Laws, and a short period for  Setting-up Exercises, preferably the first thing in the morning. On  Sundays a simple Scout service should be held.    [Illustration: A Sun Clock never runs down. Stake five feet high driven  firmly in ground in open space.
