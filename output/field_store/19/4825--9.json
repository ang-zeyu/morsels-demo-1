Algeria has the fifth-largest    reserves of natural gas in the world and is the second largest gas    exporter; it ranks fourteenth for oil reserves. Algiers' efforts to    reform one of the most centrally planned economies in the Arab world    began after the 1986 collapse of world oil prices plunged the    country into a severe recession. In 1989, the government launched a    comprehensive, IMF-supported program to achieve economic    stabilization and to introduce market mechanisms into the economy.    Despite substantial progress toward economic adjustment, in 1992 the    reform drive stalled as Algiers became embroiled in political    turmoil. In September 1993, a new government was formed, and one    priority was the resumption and acceleration of the structural    adjustment process. Burdened with a heavy foreign debt, Algiers    concluded a one-year standby arrangement with the IMF in April 1994    and the following year signed onto a three-year extended fund    facility which ended 30 April 1998. Progress on economic reform, a    Paris Club debt rescheduling in 1995, and oil and gas sector    expansion have contributed to a recovery since 1995. Investments in    developing hydrocarbon resources have spurred growth, but the    economy remains heavily dependent on volatile oil and gas revenues.    The government has continued efforts to diversify the economy by    attracting foreign and domestic investment outside the energy sector    in order to reduce high unemployment and improve living standards.
