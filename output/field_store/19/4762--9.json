It is Ingolf's grave.\"    Then men laid Ingolf upon his shield and carried him and placed him on  the high deck in the stern near the pilot's seat where he had sat to  steer to Iceland. They hung his sword over his shoulder. They laid his  spear by his side. In his hand they put his mead-horn. Into the ship  they set a great treasure-chest filled with beautiful clothes and  bracelets and head-bands. Beside the treasure-chest they piled up many  swords and spears and shields. They put gold-trimmed saddles and bridles  upon three horses. Then they killed the horses and dragged them into the  ship. They killed hunting-dogs and put them by the horses; for they  said:    \"All these things Ingolf will need in Valhalla. When he walks through  the door of that feast hall, Odin must know that a rich and brave man  comes. When he fights with those heroes during the day, he must have  weapons worthy of him. He must have dogs for the hunt. When he feasts  with those heroes at night he must wear rich clothes, so that those  feasters shall know that he was a wealthy man and generous, and that his  friends loved him.\"    Ingolf's son tied on his hell-shoes for the long journey.    \"If these shoes come untied,\" he said, \"I do not know how to fasten  hell-shoes.\"    Then he went out of the ship and stood on the ground with his family.  All the men of Iceland were there.    \"This is a glorious sight,\" they said. \"Surely no ship ever carried a  richer load. Inside and out the boat blazes with gold and bronze, and,  high over his riches, lies the great Ingolf, ready to take the tiller  and guide to Valhalla, where all the heroes will rise up and shout him  welcome.\"    Then the thralls heaped a mound of earth over the ship. This hill stood  up against the sky and seemed to say: \"Here lies a great man.\" Sighvat  put a stone on the top, with runes on it telling whose grave it was.  All this time a skald stood by and played on his harp and sang a song  about that time when Ingolf came to Iceland. He called him the father of  Iceland. People of that country still read an old story that the men of  that long ago time wrote about Ingolf, and they love him because he was  a brave man and \"the first of men to come to Iceland.\"    [Decoration]      FOOTNOTES:    [10] See note about foster-brothers on page 197.

[Illustration]    Eric the Red      It was a spring day many years after Ingolf died. All the freemen in the  west of Iceland had come to a meeting. Here they made laws and punished  men for having done wrong. The meeting was over now. Men were walking  about the plain and talking. Everybody seemed much excited. Voices were  loud, arms were swinging.    \"It was an unjust decision,\" some one cried. \"Eric killed the men in  fair fight. The judges outlawed him because they were afraid. His foe  Thorgest has many rich and powerful men to back him.\"    \"No, no!\" said another. \"Eric is a bloody man. I am glad he is out of  Iceland.\"    Just then a big man with bushy red hair and beard stalked through the  crowd. He looked straight ahead and scowled.    \"There he goes,\" people said, and turned to look after him.    \"His hands are as red as his beard,\" some said, and frowned.    But others looked at him and smiled, saying:    \"He walks like Thor the Fearless.\"    \"His story would make a fine song,\" one said. \"As strong and as brave  and as red as Thor! Always in a quarrel. A man of many places--Norway,  the north of Iceland, the west of Iceland, those little islands off the  shore of Iceland. Outlawed from all of them on account of his quarrels.  Where will he go now, I wonder?\"    This Eric strode down to the shore with his men following.    \"He is in a black temper,\" they said. \"We should best not talk to him.\"    So they made ready the boat in silence. Eric got into the pilot's seat  and they sailed off. Soon they pulled the ship up on their own shore.  Eric strolled into his house and called for supper. When the  drinking-horns had been filled and emptied, Eric pulled himself up and  smiled and shouted out so that the great room was full of his big  voice:    \"There is no friend like mead. It always cheers a man's heart.\"    [Illustration: \"_He looked straight ahead of him and scowled_\"]    Then laughter and talking began in the hall because Eric's good temper  had come back. After a while Eric said:    \"Well, I must off somewhere. I have been driven about from place to  place, like a seabird in a storm. And there is always a storm about me.  It is my sword's fault. She is ever itching to break her peace-bands[14]  and be out and at the play. She has shut Norway to me and now Iceland.  Where will you go next, old comrade?\" and he pulled out his sword and  looked at it and smiled as the fire flashed on it.    \"There are some of us who will follow you wherever you go, Eric,\" called  a man from across the fire.    \"Is it so?\" Eric cried, leaping up. \"Oh! then we shall have some merry  times yet. Who will go with me?\"    More than half the men in the hall jumped to their feet and waved their  drinking-horns and shouted:    \"I! I!\"    [Illustration: \"_More than half the men in the hall jumped to their  feet_\"]    Eric sat down in his chair and laughed.    \"O you bloody birds of battle!\" he cried. \"Ever hungry for new frolic!  Our swords are sisters in blood, and we are brothers in adventure. Do  you know what is in my heart to do?\"    He jumped to his feet, and his face glowed. Then he laughed as he looked  at his men.    \"I see the answer flashing from your eyes,\" he said, \"that you will do  it even if it is to go down to Niflheim and drag up Hela, the pale queen  of the stiff dead.\"    His men pounded on the tables and shouted:    \"Yes! Yes! Anywhere behind Eric!\"    \"But it is not to Niflheim,\" Eric laughed. \"Did you ever hear that story  that Gunnbiorn told? He was sailing for Iceland, but the fog came down,  and then the wind caught him and blew him far off. While he drifted  about he saw a strange land that rose up white and shining out of a blue  sea. Huge ships of ice sailed out from it and met him. I mean to sail to  that land.\"    A great shout went up that shook the rafters. Then the men sat and  talked over plans. While they sat, a stranger came into the hall.    \"I have no time to drink,\" he said. \"I have a message from your friend  Eyjolf. He says that Thorgest with all his men means to come here and  catch you to-night. Eyjolf bids you come to him, and he will hide you  until you are ready to start; for he loves you.\"    \"Hunted like a wolf from corner to corner of the world!\" Eric cried  angrily. \"Will they not even let me finish one feast?\"    Then he laughed.    \"But if I take my sport like a wolf, I must be hunted like one. So we  shall sleep to-night in the woods about Eyjolf's house, comrades,  instead of in these good beds. Well, we have done it before.\"    \"And it is no bad place,\" cried some of the men.    \"I always liked the stars better than a smoky house fire,\" said one.    \"Can no bad fortune spoil your good nature?\" laughed Eric. \"But now we  are off. Let every man carry what he can.\"    So they quickly loaded themselves with clothes and gold and swords and  spears and kettles of food. Eric led his wife Thorhild and his two young  sons, Thorstein and Leif. All together they got into the boat and went  to Eyjolf's farm. For a week or more they stayed in his woods, sometimes  in a secret cave of his when they knew that Thorgest was about. And  sometimes Eyjolf sent and said:    \"Thorgest is off. Come to my house for a feast.\"    All this time they were making ready for the voyage, repairing the ship  and filling it with stores. Word of what Eric meant to do got out, and  men laughed and said:    \"Is that not like Eric? What will he not do?\"    Some men liked the sound of it, and they came to Eric and said:    \"We will go with you to this strange land.\"    So all were ready and they pushed off with Eric's family aboard and  those friends who had joined him. They took horses and cattle with them,  and all kinds of tools and food.    \"I do not well know where this land is,\" Eric said. \"Gunnbiorn said only  that he sailed east when he came home to Iceland. So I will steer  straight west. We shall surely find something. I do not know, either,  how long we must go.\"    So they sailed that strange ocean, never dreaming what might be ahead of  them. They found no islands to rest on. They met heavy fogs.    One day as Eric sat in the pilot's seat, he said:    \"I think that I see one of Gunnbiorn's ships of ice. Shall we sail up to  her and see what kind of a craft she is?\"    \"Yes,\" shouted his men.    So they went on toward it.    \"It sends out a cold breath,\" said one of the men.    They all wrapped their cloaks about them.    \"It is a bigger boat than I ever saw before,\" said Eric. \"The white  mast stands as high as a hill.\"    \"It must be giants that sail in it, frost giants,\" said another of the  men.    But as they came nearer, Eric all at once laughed loudly and called out:    \"By Thor, that Gunnbiorn was a foolish fellow. Why, look! It is only a  piece of floating ice such as we sometimes see from Iceland. It is no  ship, and there is no one on it.\"    His men laughed and one called to another and said:    \"And you thought of frost giants!\"    Then they sailed on for days and days. They met many of these icebergs.  On one of them was a white bear.    \"Yonder is a strange pilot,\" Eric laughed.    \"I have seen bears come floating so to the north shore of Iceland,\" an  old man said. \"Perhaps they come from the land that we are going to  find.\"    One day Eric said:    \"I see afar off an iceberg larger than any one yet. Perhaps that is our  white land.\"    [Illustration: \"_It is a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24821"],[0,"Diamond Dyke (#12)"],[1,"you see that  fat young bull with the dark markings on its back and shoulders?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"That is the one we must ride for.--Ready!  Mount, and off.\"    They sprang into their saddles together, and dashed off to follow the  elands, while at their first movements the whole plain was covered with  the startled herds, one communicating its panic to the other.  There was  the rushing noise of a tremendous storm; but Dyke in the excitement saw  nothing, heard nothing, but the elands, which went tearing away in their  long, lumbering gallop, the horses gaining upon them steadily, and the  herd gradually scattering, till the young bull was all alone, closely  followed by the brothers; Emson dexterously riding on the great brute's  near side, and edging it off more and more so as to turn its head in the  direction of Kopfontein; hunting it homeward, so that, if they were  successful at last in shooting it, the poor brute would have been  helping to convey itself part of the way, no trifling advantage with so  weighty a beast.    On and on at a breakneck gallop, the horses stretching out like  greyhounds in the long race; but the eland, long and lumbering as it  was, kept ahead.  Its companions were far behind, and the plain, which  so short a time before had been scattered with herds of various animals,  now seemed to have been swept clear once more.    At last the tremendous pace began to tell upon both horses and eland,  while the difficulty of driving it in the required direction grow less.  But all at once, rendered savage by the persistency of the pursuit, the  great antelope turned toward the horses and charged straight at Dyke.    The boy was so much astonished at this sudden and unexpected attack that  he would have been overturned, but for the activity of Breezy, who  wheeled round, gave one bound, and just carried his rider clear.    It was no light matter, and Dyke wondered that, in the sudden twist  given to his loins by the cob's spring round, he had not been unhorsed.    But the eland did not attempt to renew the attack, gathering up its  forces and bearing away for the distant herds, with Duke snapping at its  flank; and the chase was again renewed, with Emson's horse beginning to  lose ground, while Breezy seemed to have been roused to greater effort.    Emson shouted something to Dyke, who was some distance to the left, but  what it was the boy did not hear.  He had one idea in his mind, and that  was to secure the game so necessary to their existence, and to this end  he urged his cob on, getting it at last level with the great antelope,  which was a few yards to his right.    It was all a chance, he knew, but Emson was beaten, and the antelope  seemed ready to go on for hours; so, waiting his time, he checked his  speed a little, and let the animal go on while he rode to the other side  and brought it on his left.    There was good reason for the act.  He could now let the barrel of his  heavy piece rest upon his left arm, as he held it pistol-wise, and at  last, when well abreast, he levelled it as well as he could, aiming at  the broad shoulder, and fired.    A miss, certainly, and then he galloped on for another hundred yards  before he ventured to draw trigger again, this time watchfully, for fear  of a sudden turn and charge, and not till he was pretty close and  perfectly level.    Breezy was in full stride, and going in the most elastic way in spite of  the long run, but the eland was labouring heavily, as Dyke drew trigger,  felt the sharp, jerking recoil shoot right up his arm to the shoulder;  and then to his astonishment, as he dashed on out of the smoke, he was  alone, and the eland lying fifty yards behind, where it had come down  with a tremendous crash.        CHAPTER NINE.    A QUEER PREDICAMENT.    \"Bravo! splendid!\" panted Emson, as he and his brother met by the side  of the dead eland, upon whose flank Duke had mounted, and stood with his  red tongue out, too much run down to bark.  \"Why, Dyke, lad, how did you  manage it?  Right through the shoulder.  You couldn't have done better  at a stationary target.\"    \"All chance,\" said the boy, panting as heavily as the dog; and lowering  himself off his nag, he loosened the girths, and then sank at full  length upon the sand.    \"Tired?\"    \"Thirsty,\" replied the boy.    \"That you must bear, then, till I come back.\"    \"Where are you going?\"    \"To fetch Jack and a span of bullocks.  I won't be longer than I can  help.  Keep Duke with you, but don't leave the game.  One moment: make a  fire, and cook yourself a steak.\"    \"Stop and have some, Joe.\"    \"No time,\" said Emson, and he strode away, leaving his brother alone  with the great antelope and his two dumb companions.    \"Well, I didn't reckon upon this,\" said Dyke, as he lay upon his side  watching his brother's figure grow slowly more distant, for he was  walking beside his horse, which hung its head, and kept giving its tail  an uneasy twitch.  \"Not very cheerful to wait here hours upon hours; and  how does he know that I've got any matches?  Fortunately I have.\"    There was a pause during which his cob gave itself a shake which  threatened to send the saddle underneath it, an act which brought Dyke  to his feet for the purposes of readjustment.    This done, and feeling not quite so breathless from exertion and  excitement, he walked round the great antelope.    \"Well, it was all chance,\" he said to himself.  \"The first shot was an  awful miss.  Good job for us there was so much to shoot at.  I could  hardly miss hitting that time.  What a bit of luck, though.  A big bit  of luck, for we wanted the fresh meat very badly.\"    After scanning the goodly proportions of the animal for some time, it  struck the boy that he had not reloaded his rifled gun, and this he  proceeded to do, opening the breech, taking out the empty brass  cartridges, carefully saving them for refilling, and then putting his  hand to the canvas pouch in which the cartridges were packed.    His hand stopped there, and, hot as he was, he felt a shiver pass  through him.    There was not a single cartridge left.    Dyke stood there, half-stunned.    Had he forgotten them?  No, he had felt them since he started; but where  they were now, who could say?  All he could think was that they must  have been jerked out during the violent exertion of the ride.    How his heart leaped.  They were in the leather pouch, which he had  slung from his shoulder by a strap, and the excitement had made him  forget this.  \"What a good--\"    That pouch was gone.  The buckle of the strap had come unfastened, and  it was lost, and there was he out in the middle of that plain, with the  carcass of the antelope to act as a bait to attract lions or other  fierce brutes, and he was without any means of defence but his knife and  his faithful dog.    The knife was sharp, so were Duke's teeth, but--    Dyke turned cold at the thought of his position, and involuntarily began  to sweep the plain for signs of danger, knowing, as he did full well,  that beasts of prey always hang about the herds of wild creatures in  their migrations from feeding ground to feeding ground; the lions to  treat the strong as their larder when on their way to water; the hyaenas  and jackals to pick up the infirm and tender young.  Then the boy's eyes  were directed to the distant figure of his brother, and his first  thought was to shout to him and ask for ammunition.    But no cry, however piercing, could have reached Emson then, as Dyke  well knew, and acting upon sudden impulse, he ran to his horse to  tighten the girths of his saddle to gallop off after him.    \"And if I do,\" he said to himself, \"the minute I am gone, the sneaking  jackals and vultures will appear as if by magic, and begin spoiling the  beautiful meat; Joe will laugh at me first for being a coward, and then  turn angry because I have left the eland for the animals to maul.\"    Dyke stood with his forehead puckered up, terribly perplexed.  He did  not mind the anger, but the thought of Emson thinking that he was too  cowardly to stop alone out there in the plain and keep watch for a few  hours was too much for him, and he rapidly loosened the girths again.    Then came the thought of a family of lions, which had perhaps been  unsuccessful, scenting out the eland, and coming up to find him in that  unprotected state.    It was horrible, and, with a shiver, he tightened up the girths, sprang  upon the cob, pressed its sides, and went off after Emson at a gallop,  followed by Duke, who barked joyously, as if applauding his master's  decision.    Dyke felt lighter hearted and as if every stride took him out of danger,  and he gave a glance round, saw dots here and there in the sky which he  knew were vultures hurrying up to the banquet, and drawing his left  rein, he made Breezy swing round, and rode in a semicircle back to the  eland with teeth set, a frown on his brow, and determination strong: for  he had mastered the feeling of panic that had assailed him, and though  he did not grasp the fact himself, he had made a grand stride in those  few minutes toward manhood.    \"Let 'em come,\" he said bitterly; \"I won't run away like that.  Why, I  could only have done this if a lion as big as that one we shot were  already here.\"    In another five minutes, with the dots in different parts around growing  plainer, Dyke was back by the eland, and hobbling his horse's forefeet,  he loosened the girths again with almost angry energy; then unstrapping  the bit, left the cob to crop such green shoots as it could find.    As the boy performed these acts, he could not help stealing a glance  here and there; and then standing on the eland, so as to raise himself a  little, he shaded his eyes and carefully swept the plain.    He could see distant patches, which he made out to be herds, gradually  growing fainter, and several more dots in the sky, but no sign of danger  in the shape of lions; but he"]]]
