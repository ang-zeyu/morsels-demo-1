And for thy foemen, though their words were brave,  Boasting to bring thee back, they are like to find  The seas between us wide and hard to sail.  Such my firm purpose, but in any case  Take heart, since Phoebus sent thee here.  My name,  Though I be distant, warrants thee from harm.    CHORUS  (Str. 1)       Thou hast come to a steed-famed land for rest,            O stranger worn with toil,       To a land of all lands the goodliest            Colonus' glistening soil.       'Tis the haunt of the clear-voiced nightingale,            Who hid in her bower, among       The wine-dark ivy that wreathes the vale,            Trilleth her ceaseless song;       And she loves, where the clustering berries nod            O'er a sunless, windless glade,       The spot by no mortal footstep trod,       The pleasance kept for the Bacchic god,       Where he holds each night his revels wild       With the nymphs who fostered the lusty child.    (Ant. 1)       And fed each morn by the pearly dew            The starred narcissi shine,       And a wreath with the crocus' golden hue            For the Mother and Daughter twine.       And never the sleepless fountains cease            That feed Cephisus' stream,       But they swell earth's bosom with quick increase,            And their wave hath a crystal gleam.       And the Muses' quire will never disdain       To visit this heaven-favored plain,       Nor the Cyprian queen of the golden rein.    (Str. 2)       And here there grows, unpruned, untamed,            Terror to foemen's spear,       A tree in Asian soil unnamed,       By Pelops' Dorian isle unclaimed,            Self-nurtured year by year;       'Tis the grey-leaved olive that feeds our boys;       Nor youth nor withering age destroys       The plant that the Olive Planter tends       And the Grey-eyed Goddess herself defends.    (Ant. 2)       Yet another gift, of all gifts the most       Prized by our fatherland, we boast--       The might of the horse, the might of the sea;       Our fame, Poseidon, we owe to thee,       Son of Kronos, our king divine,       Who in these highways first didst fit       For the mouth of horses the iron bit;       Thou too hast taught us to fashion meet       For the arm of the rower the oar-blade fleet,       Swift as the Nereids' hundred feet       As they dance along the brine.    ANTIGONE  Oh land extolled above all lands, 'tis now  For thee to make these glorious titles good.    OEDIPUS  Why this appeal, my daughter?    ANTIGONE                                Father, lo!  Creon approaches with his company.    OEDIPUS  Fear not, it shall be so; if we are old,  This country's vigor has no touch of age.  [Enter CREON with attendants]    CREON  Burghers, my noble friends, ye take alarm  At my approach (I read it in your eyes),  Fear nothing and refrain from angry words.  I come with no ill purpose; I am old,  And know the city whither I am come,  Without a peer amongst the powers of Greece.  It was by reason of my years that I  Was chosen to persuade your guest and bring  Him back to Thebes; not the delegate  Of one man, but commissioned by the State,  Since of all Thebans I have most bewailed,  Being his kinsman, his most grievous woes.  O listen to me, luckless Oedipus,  Come home!  The whole Cadmeian people claim  With right to have thee back, I most of all,  For most of all (else were I vile indeed)  I mourn for thy misfortunes, seeing thee  An aged outcast, wandering on and on,  A beggar with one handmaid for thy stay.  Ah! who had e'er imagined she could fall  To such a depth of misery as this,  To tend in penury thy stricken frame,  A virgin ripe for wedlock, but unwed,  A prey for any wanton ravisher?  Seems it not cruel this reproach I cast  On thee and on myself and all the race?  Aye, but an open shame cannot be hid.  Hide it, O hide it, Oedipus, thou canst.  O, by our fathers' gods, consent I pray;  Come back to Thebes, come to thy father's home,  Bid Athens, as is meet, a fond farewell;  Thebes thy old foster-mother claims thee first.    OEDIPUS  O front of brass, thy subtle tongue would twist  To thy advantage every plea of right  Why try thy arts on me, why spread again  Toils where 'twould gall me sorest to be snared?  In old days when by self-wrought woes distraught,  I yearned for exile as a glad release,  Thy will refused the favor then I craved.  But when my frenzied grief had spent its force,  And I was fain to taste the sweets of home,  Then thou wouldst thrust me from my country, then  These ties of kindred were by thee ignored;  And now again when thou behold'st this State  And all its kindly people welcome me,  Thou seek'st to part us, wrapping in soft words  Hard thoughts.  And yet what pleasure canst thou find  In forcing friendship on unwilling foes?  Suppose a man refused to grant some boon  When you importuned him, and afterwards  When you had got your heart's desire, consented,  Granting a grace from which all grace had fled,  Would not such favor seem an empty boon?  Yet such the boon thou profferest now to me,  Fair in appearance, but when tested false.  Yea, I will proved thee false, that these may hear;  Thou art come to take me, not to take me home,  But plant me on thy borders, that thy State  May so escape annoyance from this land.  _That_ thou shalt never gain, but _this_ instead--  My ghost to haunt thy country without end;  And for my sons, this heritage--no more--  Just room to die in.  Have not I more skill  Than thou to draw the horoscope of Thebes?  Are not my teachers surer guides than thine--  Great Phoebus and the sire of Phoebus, Zeus?  Thou art a messenger suborned, thy tongue  Is sharper than a sword's edge, yet thy speech  Will bring thee more defeats than victories.  Howbeit, I know I waste my words--begone,  And leave me here; whate'er may be my lot,  He lives not ill who lives withal content.    CREON  Which loses in this parley, I o'erthrown  By thee, or thou who overthrow'st thyself?    OEDIPUS  I shall be well contented if thy suit  Fails with these strangers, as it has with me.    CREON  Unhappy man, will years ne'er make thee wise?  Must thou live on to cast a slur on age?    OEDIPUS  Thou hast a glib tongue, but no honest man,  Methinks, can argue well on any side.    CREON  'Tis one thing to speak much, another well.    OEDIPUS  Thy words, forsooth, are few and all well aimed!    CREON  Not for a man indeed with wits like thine.    OEDIPUS  Depart!  I bid thee in these burghers' name,  And prowl no longer round me to blockade  My destined harbor.    CREON                      I protest to these,  Not thee, and for thine answer to thy kin,  If e'er I take thee--    OEDIPUS                      Who against their will  Could take me?    CREON                 Though untaken thou shalt smart.    OEDIPUS  What power hast thou to execute this threat?    CREON  One of thy daughters is already seized,  The other I will carry off anon.    OEDIPUS  Woe, woe!    CREON            This is but prelude to thy woes.    OEDIPUS  Hast thou my child?    CREON                      And soon shall have the other.    OEDIPUS  Ho, friends! ye will not surely play me false?  Chase this ungodly villain from your land.    CHORUS  Hence, stranger, hence avaunt!  Thou doest wrong  In this, and wrong in all that thou hast done.    CREON (to his guards)  'Tis time by force to carry off the girl,  If she refuse of her free will to go.    ANTIGONE  Ah, woe is me! where shall I fly, where find  Succor from gods or men?    CHORUS                           What would'st thou, stranger?    CREON  I meddle not with him, but her who is mine.    OEDIPUS  O princes of the land!    CHORUS                           Sir, thou dost wrong.    CREON  Nay, right.    CHORUS                 How right?    CREON                           I take but what is mine.    OEDIPUS  Help, Athens!    CHORUS  What means this, sirrah? quick unhand her, or  We'll fight it out.    CREON                      Back!    CHORUS                           Not till thou forbear.    CREON  'Tis war with Thebes if I am touched or harmed.    OEDIPUS  Did I not warn thee?    CHORUS                      Quick, unhand the maid!    CREON  Command your minions; I am not your slave.    CHORUS  Desist, I bid thee.    CREON (to the guard)                      And O bid thee march!    CHORUS            To the rescue, one and all!            Rally, neighbors to my call!            See, the foe is at the gate!            Rally to defend the State.    ANTIGONE  Ah, woe is me, they drag me hence, O friends.    OEDIPUS  Where art thou, daughter?    ANTIGONE                           Haled along by force.    OEDIPUS  Thy hands, my child!    ANTIGONE                      They will not let me, father.    CREON  Away with her!    OEDIPUS                 Ah, woe is me, ah woe!    CREON  So those two crutches shall no longer serve thee  For further roaming.  Since it pleaseth thee  To triumph o'er thy country and thy friends  Who mandate, though a prince, I here discharge,  Enjoy thy triumph; soon or late thou'lt find  Thou art an enemy to thyself, both now  And in time past, when in despite of friends  Thou gav'st the rein to passion, still thy bane.    CHORUS  Hold there, sir stranger!    CREON                           Hands off, have a care.    CHORUS  Restore the maidens, else thou goest not.    CREON  Then Thebes will take a dearer surety soon;  I will lay hands on more than these two maids.    CHORUS  What canst thou further?    CREON                           Carry off this man.    CHORUS  Brave words!    CREON                 And deeds forthwith shall make them good.    CHORUS  Unless perchance our sovereign intervene.    OEDIPUS  O shameless voice!  Would'st lay an hand on me?    CREON  Silence, I bid thee!    OEDIPUS                      Goddesses, allow  Thy suppliant to utter yet one curse!

This hero  acknowledged the excellences of his lady; but, requesting them to look  on his shoe, which appeared to be well made, he observed, \"None of you  know where the shoe pinches!\" He either used a proverbial phrase, or by  its aptness it has become one of the most popular.    There are, indeed, proverbs connected with the characters of eminent  men. They were either their favourite ones, or have originated with  themselves. Such a collection would form a historical curiosity. To the  celebrated Bayard are the French indebted for a military proverb, which  some of them still repeat, \"_Ce que le gantelet gagne le gorgerin le  mange_\"--\"What the gauntlet gets, the gorget consumes.\" That reflecting  soldier well calculated the profits of a military life, which consumes,  in the pomp and waste which are necessary for its maintenance, the  slender pay it receives, and even what its rapacity sometimes acquires.  The favourite proverb of Erasmus was _Festina lente_!--\"Hasten  slowly!\"[38] He wished it be inscribed wherever it could meet our eyes,  on public buildings, and on our rings and seals. One of our own  statesmen used a favourite sentence, which has enlarged our stock of  national proverbs. Sir Amias Pawlet, when he perceived too much hurry in  any business, was accustomed to say, \"Stay awhile, to make an end the  sooner.\" Oliver Cromwell's coarse but descriptive proverb conveys the  contempt he felt for some of his mean and troublesome coadjutors: \"Nits  will be lice!\" The Italians have a proverb, which has been occasionally  applied to certain political personages:--      _Egli e quello che Dio vuole;    E sara quello che Dio vorra!_      He is what God pleases;    He shall be what God wills!    Ere this was a proverb, it had served as an embroidered motto on the  mystical mantle of Castruccio Castracani. That military genius, who  sought to revolutionise Italy, and aspired to its sovereignty, lived  long enough to repent the wild romantic ambition which provoked all  Italy to confederate against him; the mysterious motto he assumed  entered into the proverbs of his country! The Border proverb of the  Douglases, \"It were better to hear the lark sing than the mouse cheep,\"  was adopted by every Border chief, to express, as Sir Walter Scott  observes, what the great Bruce had pointed out, that the woods and hills  of their country were their safest bulwarks, instead of the fortified  places which the English surpassed their neighbours in the arts of  assaulting or defending. These illustrations indicate one of the sources  of proverbs; they have often resulted from the spontaneous emotions or  the profound reflections of some extraordinary individual, whose  energetic expression was caught by a faithful ear, never to perish!    The poets have been very busy with proverbs in all the languages of  Europe: some appear to have been the favourite lines of some ancient  poem: even in more refined times, many of the pointed verses of Boileau  and Pope have become proverbial. Many trivial and laconic proverbs bear  the jingle of alliteration or rhyme, which assisted their circulation,  and were probably struck off extempore; a manner which Swift practised,  who was a ready coiner of such rhyming and ludicrous proverbs:  delighting to startle a collector by his facetious or sarcastic humour,  in the shape of an \"old saying and true.\" Some of these rhyming  proverbs are, however, terse and elegant: we have      Little strokes    Fell great oaks.    The Italian--      _Chi duo lepri caccia    Uno perde, e l'altro lascia._      Who hunts two hares, loses one and leaves the other.    The haughty Spaniard--      _El dar es honor,    Y el pedir dolor._      To give is honour, to ask is grief.    And the French--      _Ami de table    Est variable._      The friend of the table    Is very variable.    The composers of these short proverbs were a numerous race of poets,  who, probably, among the dreams of their immortality never suspected  that they were to descend to posterity, themselves and their works  unknown, while their extempore thoughts would be repeated by their own  nation.    Proverbs were at length consigned to the people, when books were  addressed to scholars; but the people did not find themselves so  destitute of practical wisdom, by preserving their national proverbs, as  some of those closet students who had ceased to repeat them. The various  humours of mankind, in the mutability of human affairs, had given birth  to every species; and men were wise, or merry, or satirical, and mourned  or rejoiced in proverbs. Nations held an universal intercourse of  proverbs, from the eastern to the western world; for we discover among  those which appear strictly national, many which are common to them all.  Of our own familiar ones several may be tracked among the snows of the  Latins and the Greeks, and have sometimes been drawn from \"The Mines of  the East:\" like decayed families which remain in obscurity, they may  boast of a high lineal descent whenever they recover their lost  title-deeds. The vulgar proverb, \"To carry coals to Newcastle,\" local  and idiomatic as it appears, however, has been borrowed and applied by  ourselves; it may be found among the Persians: in the \"Bustan\" of Sadi  we have _Infers piper in Hindostan_; \"To carry pepper to Hindostan;\"  among the Hebrews, \"To carry oil to the City of Olives;\" a similar  proverb occurs in Greek; and in Galland's \"Maxims of the East\" we may  discover how many of the most common proverbs among us, as well as some  of Joe Miller's jests, are of oriental origin.    The resemblance of certain proverbs in different nations, must, however,  be often ascribed to the identity of human nature; similar situations  and similar objects have unquestionably made men think and act and  express themselves alike. All nations are parallels of each other! Hence  all paroemiographers, or collectors of proverbs, complain of the  difficulty of separating their own national proverbs from those which  have crept into the language from others, particularly when nations have  held much intercourse together. We have a copious collection of Scottish  proverbs by Kelly, but this learned man was mortified at discovering  that many which he had long believed to have been genuine Scottish, were  not only English, but French, Italian, Spanish, Latin, and Greek ones;  many of his Scottish proverbs are almost literally expressed among the  fragments of remote antiquity. It would have surprised him further had  he been aware that his Greek originals were themselves but copies, and  might have been found in D'Herbelot, Erpenius, and Golius, and in many  Asiatic works, which have been more recently introduced to the enlarged  knowledge of the European student, who formerly found his most extended  researches limited by Hellenistic lore.    Perhaps it was owing to an accidental circumstance that the proverbs of  the European nations have been preserved in the permanent form of  volumes. Erasmus is usually considered as the first modern collector,  but he appears to have been preceded by Polydore Vergil, who bitterly  reproaches Erasmus with envy and plagiarism, for passing by his  collection without even a poor compliment for the inventor! Polydore was  a vain, superficial writer, who prided himself in leading the way on  more topics than the present. Erasmus, with his usual pleasantry,  provokingly excuses himself, by acknowledging that he had forgotten his  friend's book! Few sympathise with the quarrels of authors; and since  Erasmus has written a far better book than Polydore Vergil's, the  original \"_Adagia_\" is left only to be commemorated in literary history  as one of its curiosities.[39]    The \"Adagia\" of Erasmus contains a collection of about five thousand  proverbs, gradually gathered from a constant study of the ancients.  Erasmus, blest with the genius which could enliven a folio, delighted  himself and all Europe by the continued accessions he made to a volume  which even now may be the companion of literary men for a winter day's  fireside. The successful example of Erasmus commanded the imitation of  the learned in Europe, and drew their attention to their own national  proverbs. Some of the most learned men, and some not sufficiently so,  were now occupied in this new study.    In Spain, Fernandez Nunes, a Greek professor, and the Marquis of  Santellana, a grandee, published collections of their _Refranes_, or  Proverbs, a term derived A REFERENDO, because it is often repeated. The  \"Refranes o Proverbios Castellanos,\" par Caesar Oudin, 1624, translated  into French, is a valuable compilation. In Cervantes and Quevedo, the  best practical illustrators, they are sown with no sparing hand. There is  an ample collection of Italian proverbs, by Florio, who was an  Englishman, of Italian origin, and who published \"Il Giardino di  Ricreatione\" at London, so early as in 1591, exceeding six thousand  proverbs; but they are unexplained, and are often obscure. Another  Italian in England, Torriano, in 1649, published an interesting  collection in the diminutive form of a twenty-fours. It was subsequent to  these publications in England, that in Italy, Angelus Monozini, in 1604,  published his collection; and Julius Varini, in 1642, produced his  _Scuola del Vulgo_. In France, Oudin, after others had preceded him,  published a collection of French proverbs, under the title of _Curiosites  Francoises_. Fleury de Bellingen's _Explication de Proverbes Francois_,  on comparing it with _Les Illustres Proverbes Historiques_, a subsequent  publication, I discovered to be the same work. It is the first attempt to  render the study of proverbs somewhat amusing. The plan consists of a  dialogue between a philosopher and a Sancho Panca, who blurts out his  proverbs with more delight than understanding. The philosopher takes  that opportunity of"]]]
