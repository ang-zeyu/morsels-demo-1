Sturm and Girou  have given analogous cases with other breeds of sheep and with cattle, the  prepotency running in these cases through the male side; but I was assured on  good authority in South America, that when niata cattle are crossed with  common cattle, though the niata breed is prepotent whether males or females  are used, yet that the prepotency is strongest through the female line. The  Manx cat is tailless and has long hind legs; Dr. Wilson crossed a male Manx  with common cats, and, out of twenty-three kittens, seventeen were destitute  of tails; but when the female Manx was crossed by common male cats all the  kittens had tails, though they were generally short and imperfect. (14/8. Mr.  Orton 'Physiology of Breeding' 1855 page 9.)    In making reciprocal crosses between pouter and fantail pigeons, the pouter-  race seemed to be prepotent through both sexes over the fantail. But this is  probably due to weak power in the fantail rather than to any unusually strong  power in the pouter, for I have observed that barbs also preponderate over  fantails. This weakness of transmission in the fantail, though the breed is an  ancient one, is said (14/9. Boitard and Corbie 'Les Pigeons' 1824 page 224.)  to be general; but I have observed one exception to the rule, namely, in a  cross between a fantail and laugher. The most curious instance known to me of  weak power in both sexes is in the trumpeter pigeon. This breed has been well  known for at least 130 years: it breeds perfectly true, as I have been assured  by those who have long kept many birds: it is characterised by a peculiar tuft  of feathers over the beak, by a crest on the head, by a singular coo quite  unlike that of any other breed, and by much-feathered feet. I have crossed  both sexes with turbits of two sub-breeds, with almond tumblers, spots, and  runts, and reared many mongrels and recrossed them; and though the crest on  the head and feathered feet were inherited (as is generally the case with most  breeds), I have never seen a vestige of the tuft over the beak or heard the  peculiar coo. Boitard and Corbie (14/10. 'Les Pigeons' pages 168, 198.) assert  that this is the invariable result of crossing trumpeters with other breeds:  Neumeister (14/11. 'Das Ganze' etc. 1837 s. 39.), however, states that in  Germany mongrels have been obtained, though very rarely, which were furnished  with the tuft and would trumpet: but a pair of these mongrels with a tuft,  which I imported, never trumpeted. Mr. Brent states (14/12. 'The Pigeon Book'  page 46.) that the crossed offspring of a trumpeter were crossed with  trumpeters for three generations, by which time the mongrels had 7/8ths of  this blood in their veins, yet the tuft over the beak did not appear. At the  fourth generation the tuft appeared, but the birds though now having 15-16ths  trumpeter's blood still did not trumpet. This case well shows the wide  difference between inheritance and prepotency; for here we have a well-  established old race which transmits its characters faithfully, but which,  when crossed with any other race, has the feeblest power of transmitting its  two chief characteristic qualities.    I will give one other instance with fowls and pigeons of weakness and strength  in the transmission of the same character to their crossed offspring. The Silk  fowl breeds true, and there is reason to believe is a very ancient race; but  when I reared a large number of mongrels from a Silk hen by a Spanish cock,  not one exhibited even a trace of the so-called silkiness. Mr. Hewitt also  asserts that in no instance are the silky feathers transmitted by this breed  when crossed with any other variety. But three birds out of many raised by Mr.  Orton from a cross between a silk cock and a bantam hen had silky feathers.  (14/13. 'Physiology of Breeding' page 22; Mr. Hewitt in 'The Poultry Book' by  Tegetmeier 1866 page 224.) So that it is certain that this breed very seldom  has the power of transmitting its peculiar plumage to its crossed progeny. On  the other hand, there is a silk sub-variety of the fantail pigeon, which has  its feathers in nearly the same state as in the Silk fowl: now we have already  seen that fantails, when crossed, possess singularly weak power in  transmitting their general qualities; but the silk sub-variety when crossed  with any other small-sized race invariably transmits its silky feathers!  (14/14. Boitard and Corbie 'Les Pigeons' 1824 page 226.)    The well-known horticulturist, Mr. Paul, informs me that he fertilised the  Black Prince hollyhock with pollen of the White Globe and the Lemonade and  Black Prince hollyhocks reciprocally; but not one seedling from these three  crosses inherited the black colour of the Black Prince. So, again, Mr. Laxton,  who has had such great experience in crossing peas, writes to me that  \"whenever a cross has been effected between a white-blossomed and a purple-  blossomed pea, or between a white-seeded and a purple-spotted, brown or maple-  seeded pea, the offspring seems to lose nearly all the characteristics of the  white-flowered and white-seeded varieties; and this result follows whether  these varieties have been used as the pollen-bearing or seed-producing  parents.\"    The law of prepotency comes into action when species are crossed, as with  races and individuals. Gartner has unequivocally shown (14/15.  'Bastarderzeugung' s. 256, 290, etc. Naudin 'Nouvelles Archives du Museum'  tome 1 page 149 gives a striking instance of prepotency in Datura stramonium  when crossed with two other species.) that this is the case with plants. To  give one instance: when Nicotiana paniculata and vincaeflora are crossed, the  character of N. paniculata is almost completely lost in the hybrid; but if N.  quadrivalvis be crossed with N. vincaeflora, this latter species, which was  before so prepotent, now in its turn almost disappears under the power of N.  quadrivalvis. It is remarkable that the prepotency of one species over another  in transmission is quite independent, as shown by Gartner, of the greater or  less facility with which the one fertilises the other.    With animals, the jackal is prepotent over the dog, as is stated by Flourens,  who made many crosses between these animals; and this was likewise the case  with a hybrid which I once saw between a jackal and a terrier. I cannot doubt,  from the observations of Colin and others, that the ass is prepotent over the  horse; the prepotency in this instance running more strongly through the male  than through the female ass; so that the mule resembles the ass more closely  than does the hinny. (14/16. Flourens 'Longevite Humaine' page 144 on crossed  jackals. With respect to the difference between the mule and the hinny I am  aware that this has generally been attributed to the sire and dam transmitting  their characters differently; but Colin, who has given in his 'Traite Phys.  Comp.' tome 2 pages 537-539, the fullest description which I have met with of  these reciprocal hybrids, is strongly of opinion that the ass preponderates in  both crosses, but in an unequal degree. This is likewise the conclusion of  Flourens, and of Bechstein in his 'Naturgeschichte Deutschlands' b. 1 s. 294.  The tail of the hinny is much more like that of the horse than is the tail of  the mule, and this is generally accounted for by the males of both species  transmitting with greater power this part of their structure; but a compound  hybrid which I saw in the Zoological Gardens, from a mare by a hybrid ass-  zebra, closely resembled its mother in its tail.) The male pheasant, judging  from Mr. Hewitt's descriptions (14/17. Mr. Hewitt who has had such great  experience in raising these hybrids says ('Poultry Book' by Mr. Tegetmeier  1866 pages 165-167) that in all, the head was destitute of wattles, comb, and  ear-lappets; and all closely resembled the pheasant in the shape of the tail  and general contour of the body. These hybrids were raised from hens of  several breeds by a cock-pheasant; but another hybrid, described by Mr.  Hewitt, was raised from a hen-pheasant, by a silver-laced Bantam cock, and  this possessed a rudimental comb and wattles.), and from the hybrids which I  have seen, preponderates over the domestic fowl; but the latter, as far as  colour is concerned, has considerable power of transmission, for hybrids  raised from five differently coloured hens differed greatly in plumage. I  formerly examined some curious hybrids in the Zoological Gardens, between the  Penguin variety of the common duck and the Egyptian goose (Anser aegyptiacus);  and although I will not assert that the domesticated variety preponderated  over the natural species, yet it had strongly impressed its unnatural upright  figure on these hybrids.    I am aware that such cases as the foregoing have been ascribed by various  authors, not to one species, race, or individual being prepotent over the  other in impressing its character on its crossed offspring, but to such rules  as that the father influences the external characters and the mother the  internal or vital organs. But the great diversity of the rules given by  various authors almost proves their falseness. Dr. Prosper Lucas has fully  discussed this point, and has shown (14/18. 'L'Hered. Nat.' tome 2 book 2  chapter 1.) that none of the rules (and I could add others to those quoted by  him) apply to all animals. Similar rules have been announced for plants, and  have been proved by Gartner (14/19. 'Bastarderzeugung' s. 264-266. Naudin  'Nouvelles Archives du Museum' tome 1 page 148 has arrived at a similar  conclusion.) to be all erroneous. If we confine our view to the domesticated  races of a single species, or perhaps even "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28752"],[0,"Pleasures of the telescope (#12)"],[1,"we try in Booetes, Sigma 1772, requires the use of  the four-inch, and the five-inch shows it more satisfactorily. The  magnitudes are sixth and ninth, distance 5\", p. 140 deg.. On the other side  of Arcturus we find zeta, a star that we should have had no great  difficulty in separating thirty years ago, but which has now closed up  beyond the reach even of our five-inch. The magnitudes are both fourth,  and the distance less than a quarter of a second; position angle  changing. It is apparently a binary, and if so will some time widen  again, but its period is unknown. The star 279, also known as Sigma  1910, near the southeastern edge of the constellation, is a pretty  double, each component being of the seventh magnitude, distance 4\", p.  212 deg.. Just above zeta we come upon pi, an easy double for the  three-inch, magnitudes four and six, distance 6\" p. 99 deg.. Next is xi, a  yellow and purple pair, whose magnitudes are respectively five and  seven, distance less than 3\", p. 200 deg.. This is undoubtedly a binary with  a period of revolution of about a hundred and thirty years. Its distance  decreased about 1\" between 1881 and 1891. It was still decreasing in  1899, when it had become 2.5\". The orbital swing is also very apparent  in the change of the position angle.    The telescopic gem of Booetes, and one of \"the flowers of the sky,\" is  epsilon, also known as Mirac. When well seen, as we shall see it  to-night, epsilon Booetis is superb. The magnitudes of its two component  stars are two and a half (according to Hall, three) and six. The  distance is about 2.8\", p. 326 deg.. The contrast of colors--bright orange  yellow, set against brilliant emerald green--is magnificent. There are  very few doubles that can be compared with it in this respect. The  three-inch will separate it, but the five-inch enables us best to enjoy  its beauty. It appears to be a binary, but the motion is very slow, and  nothing certain is yet known of its period.    In delta we have a very wide and easy double; magnitudes three and a  half and eight and a half, distance 110\", p. 75 deg.. The smaller star has a  lilac hue. We can not hope with any of our instruments to see all of the  three stars contained in , but two of them are easily seen; magnitudes  four and seven, distance 108\", p. 172 deg.. The smaller star is again  double; magnitudes seven and eight, distance 0.77\", p. 88 deg.. It is  clearly a binary, with a long period. A six-inch telescope that could  separate this star at present would be indeed a treasure. Sigma 1926 is  another object rather beyond our powers, on account of the contrast of  magnitudes. These are six and eight and a half; distance 1.3\", p. 256 deg..    Other doubles are: 44 (Sigma 1909), magnitudes five and six, distance  4.8\", p. 240 deg.; 39 (Sigma 1890), magnitudes both nearly six, distance  3.6\", p. 45 deg.. Smaller star light red; iota, magnitudes four and a half  and seven and a half, distance 38\", p. 33 deg.; kappa, magnitudes five and a  half and eight, distance 12.7\", p. 238 deg.. Some observers see a greenish  tinge in the light of the larger star, the smaller one being blue.    There are one or two interesting things to be seen in that part of Canes  Venatici which is represented on map No. 11. The first of these is the  star cluster 3936. This will reward a good look with the five-inch. With  large telescopes as many as one thousand stars have been discerned  packed within its globular outlines.    The star 25 (Sigma 1768) is a close binary with a period estimated at  one hundred and twenty-five years. The magnitudes are six and seven or  eight, distance about 1\", p. 137 deg.. We may try for this with the  five-inch, and if we do not succeed in separating the stars we may hope  to do so some time, for the distance between them is increasing.    Although the nebula 3572 is a very wonderful object, we shall leave it  for another evening.    Eastward from Booetes shines the circlet of Corona Borealis, whose form  is so strikingly marked out by the stars that the most careless eye  perceives it at once. Although a very small constellation, it abounds  with interesting objects. We begin our attack with the five-inch on  Sigma 1932, but not too confident that we shall come off victors, for  this binary has been slowly closing for many years. The magnitudes are  six and a half and seven, distance 0.84\", p. 150 deg.. Not far distant is  another binary, at present beyond our powers, eta. Here the magnitudes  are both six, distance 0.65\", p. 3 deg.. Hall assigns a period of forty  years to this star.    The assemblage of close binaries in this neighborhood is very curious.  Only a few degrees away we find one that is still more remarkable, the  star gamma. What has previously been said about 42 Comae Berenicis  applies in a measure to this star also. It, too, has a comparatively  small orbit, and its components are never seen widely separated. In 1826  their distance was 0.7\"; in 1880 they could not be split; in 1891 the  distance had increased to 0.36\", and in 1894 it had become 0.53\", p.  123 deg.. But in 1899 Lewis made the distance only 0.43\". The period has  been estimated at one hundred years.    While the group of double stars in the southern part of Corona Borealis  consists, as we have seen, of remarkably close binaries, another group  in the northern part of the same constellation comprises stars that are  easily separated. Let us first try zeta. The powers of the three-inch  are amply sufficient in this case. The magnitudes are four and five,  distance 6.3\", p. 300 deg.. Colors, white or bluish-white and blue or green.    Next take sigma, whose magnitudes are five and six, distance 4\", p.  206 deg.. With the five-inch we may look for a second companion of the tenth  magnitude, distance 54\", p. 88 deg.. It is thought highly probable that  sigma is a binary, but its period has simply been guessed at.    Finally, we come to nu, which consists of two very widely separated  stars, nu^1 and nu^2, each of which has a faint companion. With the  five-inch we may be able to see the companion of nu^2, the more  southerly of the pair. The magnitude of the companion is variously given  as tenth and twelfth, distance 137\", p. 18 deg..    With the aid of the map we find the position of the new star of 1866,  which is famous as the first so-called temporary star to which  spectroscopic analysis was applied. When first noticed, on May 12, 1866,  this star was of the second magnitude, fully equaling in brilliancy  alpha, the brightest star of the constellation; but in about two weeks  it fell to the ninth magnitude. Huggins and Miller eagerly studied the  star with the spectroscope, and their results were received with deepest  interest. They concluded that the light of the new star had two  different sources, each giving a spectrum peculiar to itself. One of the  spectra had dark lines and the other bright lines. It will be  remembered that a similar peculiarity was exhibited by the new star in  Auriga in 1893. But the star in Corona did not disappear. It diminished  to magnitude nine and a half or ten, and stopped there; and it is still  visible. In fact, subsequent examination proved that it had been  catalogued at Bonn as a star of magnitude nine and a half in 1855.  Consequently this \"blaze star\" of 1866 will bear watching in its  decrepitude. Nobody knows but that it may blaze again. Perhaps it is a  sun-like body; perhaps it bears little resemblance to a sun as we  understand such a thing. But whatever it may be, it has proved itself  capable of doing very extraordinary things.    We have no reason to suspect the sun of any latent eccentricities, like  those that have been displayed by \"temporary\" stars; yet, acting on the  principle which led the old emperor-astrologer Rudolph II to torment his  mind with self-made horoscopes of evil import, let us unscientifically  imagine that the sun _could_ suddenly burst out with several hundred  times its ordinary amount of heat and light, thereby putting us into a  proper condition for spectroscopic examination by curious astronomers in  distant worlds.    But no, after all, it is far pleasanter to keep within the strict  boundaries of science, and not imagine anything of the kind.          CHAPTER V    IN SUMMER STAR-LANDS    \"I heard the trailing garments of the night    Sweep through her marble halls,  I saw her sable skirts all fringed with light    From the celestial walls.\"--H. W. LONGFELLOW.      In the soft air of a summer night, when fireflies are flashing their  lanterns over the fields, the stars do not sparkle and blaze like those  that pierce the frosty skies of winter. The light of Sirius, Aldebaran,  Rigel, and other midwinter brilliants possesses a certain gemlike  hardness and cutting quality, but Antares and Vega, the great summer  stars, and Arcturus, when he hangs westering in a July night, exhibit a  milder radiance, harmonizing with the character of the season. This  difference is, of course, atmospheric in origin, although it may be  partly subjective, depending upon the mental influences of the mutations  of Nature.    [Illustration: MAP NO. 12.]    The constellation Scorpio is nearly as striking in outline as Orion, and  its brightest star, the red Antares (alpha in map No. 12), carries  concealed in its rays a green jewel which, to the eye of the enthusiast  in telescopic recreation, appears more beautiful and inviting each time  that he penetrates to its hiding place.    We shall begin our night's work with this object, and the four-inch  glass will serve our purpose, although the untrained observer would be  more certain of success with the five-inch. A friend of mine has seen  the companion of Antares with a three-inch, but I have never tried the  star with so small an aperture. When the air is steady and the companion  can be well viewed, there is no finer sight among the double stars. The  contrast of colors is"]]]
