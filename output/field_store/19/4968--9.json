At this time it was the  duty of the valet de chambre to follow the carriage on horseback. One  day the First Consul, while returning to Paris, ascertained a short  distance from the chateau that he had forgotten his snuff-box, and sent  me for it. I turned my bridle, set off at a gallop, and, having found  the snuff-box on his desk, retraced my steps to overtake him, but did not  succeed in doing so till he had reached Ruelle. Just as I drew near the  carriage my horse slipped on a stone, fell, and threw me some distance  into a ditch. The fall was very severe; and I remained stretched on the  ground, with one shoulder dislocated, and an arm badly bruised. The  First Consul ordered the horses stopped, himself gave orders to have me  taken up, and cautioned them to be very careful in moving me; and I was  borne, attended by-him, to the barracks of Ruelle, where he took pains  before continuing his journey to satisfy himself that I was in no danger.  The physician of his household was sent to Ruelle, my shoulder set, and  my arm dressed; and from there I was carried as gently as possible to  Malmaison, where, good Madame, Bonaparte had the kindness to come to see  me, and lavished on me every attention.    The day I returned to service, after my recovery, I was in the  antechamber of the First Consul as he came out of his cabinet. He drew  near me, and inquired with great interest how I was. I replied that,  thanks to the care taken of me, according to the orders of my excellent  master and mistress, I was quite well again. \"So much the better,\" said  the First Consul. \"Constant, make haste, and get your strength back.  Continue to serve me well, and I will take care of you. Here,\" added he,  placing in my hand three little crumpled papers, \"these are to replenish  your wardrobe;\" and he passed on, without listening to the profuse thanks  which, with great emotion, I was attempting to express, much more for the  consideration and interest in me shown by him than for his present, for I  did not then know of what it consisted. After he passed on I unrolled my  papers: they were three bank-bills, each for a thousand francs! I was  moved to tears by so great a kindness. We must remember that at this  period the First Consul was not rich, although he was the first  magistrate of the republic. How deeply the remembrance of this generous  deed touches me, even to-day. I do not know if details so personal to me  will be found interesting; but they seem to me proper as evidence of the  true character of the Emperor, which has been so outrageously  misrepresented, and also as an instance of his ordinary conduct towards  the servants of his house; it shows too, at the same time, whether the  severe economy that he required in his domestic management, and of which  I will speak elsewhere, was the result, as has been stated, of sordid  avarice, or whether it was not rather a rule of prudence, from which he  departed willingly whenever his kindness of heart or his humanity urged  him thereto.    I am not certain that my memory does not deceive me in leading me to put  in this place a circumstance which shows the esteem in which the First  Consul held the brave soldiers of his army, and how he loved to manifest  it on all occasions. I was one day in his sleeping-room, at the usual  hour for his toilet, and was performing that day the duties of chief  valet, Hambard being temporarily absent or indisposed, there being in the  room, besides the body servants, only the brave and modest Colonel  Gerard Lacuee, one of the aides-de-camp of the First Consul. Jerome  Bonaparte, then hardly seventeen years of age, was introduced. This  young man gave his family frequent cause of complaint, and feared no one  except his brother Napoleon, who reprimanded, lectured, and scolded him  as if he had been his own son. There was a question at the time of  making him a sailor, less with the object of giving him a career, than of  removing him from the seductive temptations which the high position of  his brother caused to spring up incessantly around his path, and which he  had little strength to resist. It may be imagined what it cost him to  renounce pleasures so accessible and so delightful to a young man. He  did not fail to protest, on all occasions, his unfitness for sea-service,  going so far, it is said, that he even caused himself to be rejected by  the examining board of the navy as incompetent, though he could easily  have prepared himself to answer the few questions asked. However, the  will of the First Consul must be obeyed, and Jerome was compelled to  embark. On the day of which I have spoken, after some moments of  conversation and scolding, still on the subject of the navy, Jerome said  to his brother, \"Instead of sending me to perish of ennui at sea, you  ought to take me for an aide-de-camp.\"--\"What, take you, greenhorn,\"  warmly replied the First Consul; \"wait till a ball has furrowed your face  and then I will see about it,\" at the same time calling his attention to  Colonel Lacuee, who blushed, and dropped his eyes to the floor like a  young girl, for, as is well known, he bore on his face the scar made by a  bullet. This gallant colonel was killed in 1805 before Guntzbourg; and  the Emperor deeply regretted his loss, for he ways one of the bravest and  most skillful officers of the army.    It was, I believe, about this time that the First Consul conceived a  strong passion for a very intelligent and handsome young woman, Madame D.  Madame Bonaparte, suspecting this intrigue, showed jealousy; and her  husband did all he could to allay her wifely suspicions. Before going to  the chamber of his mistress he would wait until every one was asleep in  the chateau; and he even carried his precautions so far as to go from his  room to hers in his night-dress, without shoes or slippers. Once I found  that day was about to break before his return; and fearing scandal, I  went, as the First Consul had ordered me to do in such a case, to notify  the chambermaid of Madame D. to go to her mistress and tell her the hour.  It was hardly five minutes after this timely notice had been given, when  I saw the First Consul returning, in great excitement, of which I soon  learned the cause. He had discovered, on his return, one of Madame  Bonaparte's women, lying in wait, and who had seen him through the window  of a closet opening upon the corridor. The First Consul, after a  vigorous outburst against the curiosity of the fair sex, sent me to the  young scout from the enemy's camp to intimate to her his orders to hold  her tongue, unless she wished to be discharged without hope of return.  I do not know whether I added a milder argument to these threats to buy  her silence; but, whether from fear or for compensation, she had the good  sense not to talk. Nevertheless, the successful lover, fearing another  surprise, directed me to rent in the Allee des Ireuves a little house  where he and Madame D. met from time to time. Such were, and continued  to be, the precautions of the First Consul towards his wife. He had the  highest regard for her, and took all imaginable care to prevent his  infidelities coming to her knowledge. Besides, these passing fancies did  not lessen the tenderness he felt for her; and although other women  inspired him with love, no other woman had his confidence and friendship  to the same extent as Madame Bonaparte. There have been a thousand and  one calumnies repeated of the harshness and brutality of the First Consul  towards women. He was not always gallant, but I have never seen him  rude; and, however singular it may seem after what I have just related,  he professed the greatest veneration for a wife of exemplary conduct,  speaking in admiring terms of happy households; and he did not admire  cynicism, either in morals or in language. When he had any liaisons he  kept them secret, and concealed them with great care.          CHAPTER VI.    The 3d Nivose, year IX. (Dec. 21, 1800),       [Under the Republican regime the years were counted from the     proclamation of the Republic, Sept. 22, 1792. The year was divided     into twelve months of thirty days each, re-named from some     peculiarity, as Brumaire (foggy); Nivose (snowy); Thermidor (hot);     Fructidor (fruit), etc.; besides five supplementary days of     festivals, called 'sans-culottides'. The months were divided into     three decades of ten days instead of weeks, the tenth day (decadi)     being in lieu of Sunday. The Republican calendar lasted till Jan 1,     1806, as to the years and months at least, though the Concordat     had restored the weeks and Sabbaths.--TRANS.]    the Opera presented, by order, The Creation of Haydn; and the First  Consul had announced that he would be present, with all his household, at  this magnificent oratorio. He dined on that day with Madame Bonaparte,  her daughter, and Generals Rapp, Lauriston, Lannes, and Berthier. I was  on duty; but as the First Consul was going to the Opera, I knew that I  should not be needed at the chateau, and resolved, for my part, to go to  the Feydeau, occupying the box which Madame Bonaparte allowed us, and  which was situated under hers. After dinner, which the First Consul  bolted with his usual rapidity, he rose from the table, followed by his  officers, with the exception of General Rapp, who remained with Madame  Josephine and Hortense. About seven o'clock the First Consul entered his  carriage with Lannes, Berthier, and Lauriston, to go to the Opera. When  they arrived in the middle of Rue Sainte-Nicaise, the escort who preceded  the carriage found the road obstructed by a cart, which seemed to be  abandoned, and on which a cask was found fastened strongly with ropes.  The chief of the escort had this cart removed to the side of the street;  and the First Consul's coachman, whom this delay had made impatient,  urged on his horses vigorously, and they shot"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35802"],[0,"Lusitania: Canti popolari portoghesi (#12)"],[1,"barque aborda.
