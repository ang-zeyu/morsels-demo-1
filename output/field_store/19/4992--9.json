He  put his finger in, and the gold stuck to it, and, wipe and rub as  he would, the gold would not come off; so he wrapped a piece of rag  around it, and when his supposed father came home and saw the rag,  and asked him what he had been doing to his finger, he was afraid to  tell him the truth, so he said that he had cut it.    Not very long after, Mchaawee went away again, and the youth took  the keys and continued his investigations.    The first room he opened was filled with the bones of goats, the  next with sheep's bones, the next with the bones of oxen, the fourth  with the bones of donkeys, the fifth with those of horses, the sixth  contained men's skulls, and in the seventh was a live horse.    \"Hullo!\" said the horse; \"where do you come from, you son of Adam?\"    \"This is my father's house,\" said Keejaanaa.    \"Oh, indeed!\" was the reply. \"Well, you've got a pretty nice parent! Do  you know that he occupies himself with eating people, and donkeys,  and horses, and oxen and goats and everything he can lay his hands  on? You and I are the only living things left.\"    This scared the youth pretty badly, and he faltered, \"What are we  to do?\"    \"What's your name?\" said the horse.    \"Keejaanaa.\"    \"Well, I'm Faaraa'see. Now, Keejaanaa, first of all, come and  unfasten me.\"    The youth did so at once.    \"Now, then, open the door of the room with the gold in it, and I  will swallow it all; then I'll go and wait for you under the big  tree down the road a little way. When the magician comes home,  he will say to you, 'Let us go for firewood;' then you answer,  'I don't understand that work;' and he will go by himself. When he  comes back, he will put a great big pot on the hook and will tell you  to make a fire under it. Tell him you don't know how to make a fire,  and he will make it himself.    \"Then he will bring a large quantity of butter, and while it is  getting hot he will put up a swing and say to you, 'Get up there,  and I'll swing you.' But you tell him you never played at that game,  and ask him to swing first, that you may see how it is done. Then  he will get up to show you; and you must push him into the big pot,  and then come to me as quickly as you can.\"    Then the horse went away.    Now, Mchaawee had invited some of his friends to a feast at his  house that evening; so, returning home early, he said to Keejaanaa,  \"Let us go for firewood;\" but the youth answered, \"I don't understand  that work.\" So he went by himself and brought the wood.    Then he hung up the big pot and said, \"Light the fire;\" but the  youth said, \"I don't know how to do it.\" So the magician laid the  wood under the pot and lighted it himself.    Then he said, \"Put all that butter in the pot;\" but the youth answered,  \"I can't lift it; I'm not strong enough.\" So he put in the butter  himself.    Next Mchaawee said, \"Have you seen our country game?\" And Keejaanaa  answered, \"I think not.\"    \"Well,\" said the magician, \"let's play at it while the butter is  getting hot.\"    So he tied up the swing and said to Keejaanaa, \"Get up here, and learn  the game.\" But the youth said: \"You get up first and show me. I'll  learn quicker that way.\"    The magician got into the swing, and just as he got started Keejaanaa  gave him a push right into the big pot; and as the butter was by this  time boiling, it not only killed him, but cooked him also.    As soon as the youth had pushed the magician into the big pot, he  ran as fast as he could to the big tree, where the horse was waiting  for him.    \"Come on,\" said Faaraasee; \"jump on my back and let's be going.\"    So he mounted and they started off.    When the magician's guests arrived they looked everywhere for him,  but, of course, could not find him. Then, after waiting a while, they  began to be very hungry; so, looking around for something to eat, they  saw that the stew in the big pot was done, and, saying to each other,  \"Let's begin, anyway,\" they started in and ate the entire contents of  the pot. After they had finished, they searched for Mchaawee again,  and finding lots of provisions in the house, they thought they would  stay there until he came; but after they had waited a couple of days  and eaten all the food in the place, they gave him up and returned  to their homes.    Meanwhile Keejaanaa and the horse continued on their way until they  had gone a great distance, and at last they stopped near a large town.    \"Let us stay here,\" said the youth, \"and build a house.\"    As Faaraasee was agreeable, they did so. The horse coughed up all the  gold he had swallowed, with which they purchased slaves, and cattle,  and everything they needed.    When the people of the town saw the beautiful new house and all the  slaves, and cattle, and riches it contained, they went and told their  sultan, who at once made up his mind that the owner of such a place  must be of sufficient importance to be visited and taken notice of,  as an acquisition to the neighborhood.    So he called on Keejaanaa, and inquired who he was.    \"Oh, I'm just an ordinary being, like other people.\"    \"Are you a traveler?\"    \"Well, I have been; but I like this place, and think I'll settle  down here.\"    \"Why don't you come and walk in our town?\"    \"I should like to very much, but I need some one to show me around.\"    \"Oh, I'll show you around,\" said the sultan, eagerly, for he was  quite taken with the young man.    After this Keejaanaa and the sultan became great friends; and in the  course of time the young man married the sultan's daughter, and they  had one son.    They lived very happily together, and Keejaanaa loved Faaraasee as  his own soul.                X.    THE PHYSICIAN'S SON AND THE KING OF THE SNAKES.      Once there was a very learned physician, who died leaving his wife  with a little baby boy, whom, when he was old enough, she named,  according to his father's wish, Hassee'boo Kareem' Ed Deen'.    When the boy had been to school, and had learned to read, his mother  sent him to a tailor, to learn his trade, but he could not learn  it. Then he was sent to a silversmith, but he could not learn his  trade either. After that he tried many trades, but could learn none  of them. At last his mother said, \"Well, stay at home for a while;\"  and that seemed to suit him.    One day he asked his mother what his father's business had been,  and she told him he was a very great physician.    \"Where are his books?\" he asked.    \"Well, it's a long time since I saw them,\" replied his mother,  \"but I think they are behind there. Look and see.\"    So he hunted around a little and at last found them, but they were  almost ruined by insects, and he gained little from them.    At last, four of the neighbors came to his mother and said, \"Let  your boy go along with us and cut wood in the forest.\" It was their  business to cut wood, load it on donkeys, and sell it in the town  for making fires.    \"All right,\" said she; \"to-morrow I'll buy him a donkey, and he can  start fair with you.\"    So the next day Hasseeboo, with his donkey, went off with those  four persons, and they worked very hard and made a lot of money that  day. This continued for six days, but on the seventh day it rained  heavily, and they had to get under the rocks to keep dry.    Now, Hasseeboo sat in a place by himself, and, having nothing else to  do, he picked up a stone and began knocking on the ground with it. To  his surprise the ground gave forth a hollow sound, and he called to  his companions, saying, \"There seems to be a hole under here.\"    Upon hearing him knock again, they decided to dig and see what was  the cause of the hollow sound; and they had not gone very deep before  they broke into a large pit, like a well, which was filled to the  top with honey.    They didn't do any firewood chopping after that, but devoted their  entire attention to the collection and sale of the honey.    With a view to getting it all out as quickly as possible, they told  Hasseeboo to go down into the pit and dip out the honey, while they  put it in vessels and took it to town for sale. They worked for three  days, making a great deal of money.    At last there was only a little honey left at the very bottom of the  pit, and they told the boy to scrape that together while they went  to get a rope to haul him out.    But instead of getting the rope, they decided to let him remain in the  pit, and divide the money among themselves. So, when he had gathered  the remainder of the honey together, and called for the rope, he  received no answer; and after he had been alone in the pit for three  days he became convinced that his companions had deserted him.    Then those four persons went to his mother and told her that they had  become separated in the forest, that they had heard a lion roaring,  and that they could find no trace of either her son or his donkey.    His mother, of course, cried very much, and the four neighbors pocketed  her son's share of the money.    To return to Hasseeboo.    He passed the time walking about the pit, wondering what the end  would be, eating scraps of honey, sleeping a little, and sitting down  to think.    While engaged in the last occupation, on the fourth day, he saw a  scorpion fall to the ground--a large one, too--and he killed it.    Then suddenly he thought to himself, \"Where did that scorpion come  from? There must be a hole somewhere. I'll search, anyhow.\"    So he searched around until he saw light through a tiny crack; and  he took his knife and scooped and scooped, until he had made a hole  big enough to pass through; then he went out, and came upon a place  he had never seen before.    Seeing a path, he followed it until he came to a very large house,  the door of which was not fastened. So he went inside, and saw golden  doors, with golden locks, and keys of pearl, and beautiful chairs"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3751"],[0,"The Psychology of Beauty (#12)"],[1,"been  brought.  The background fades; the foreground satisfies,  incites no movement; and with the disappearance of the  possibility of action which would connect the two, fades also  that which dwells in this feeling of transition,--the sense  of personality.  The depth of aesthetic feeling lies not in  the worthy countryman who interrupts the play with cries for  justice on the villain, but in him who creates the drama again  with the poet, who lives over again in himself each of the  thrills of emotion passing before him, and loses himself in  their web.  The object is a unity or our whirling circle of  impulses, as you like to phrase it.  At any rate, out of that  unity the soul does not return upon itself; it remains one  with it in the truest sense.    The loss of the sense of personality is an integral part of  the aesthetic experience; and we have seen how it is a  necessary psychological effect of the unity of the object.  From another point of view it may be said that the unity of  the object is constituted just by the inhibition of all  tendency to movement through the balance or centrality of  impulses suggested by it.  In other words, the balance of  impulses makes us feel the object a unity.  And this balance  of impulses, this inhibition of movement, corresponding to  unity, is what we know as aesthetic repose.  Thus the conditions  of aesthetic repose and of the loss of self-feeling are the  same.  In fact, it might be said that, within this realm,  the two conceptions are identical.  The true aesthetic repose  is just that perfect rest in the beautiful object which is  the essence of the loss of the sense of personality.    Subtler and rarer, again, than the raptures of mysticism and  of beauty worship is the ecstasy of intellectual production;  yet the \"clean, clear joy of creation,\" as Kipling names it,  is not less to be grouped with those precious experiences in  which the self is sloughed away, and the soul at one with its  content.  I speak, of course, of intellectual production in  full swing, in the momentum of success.  The travail of soul  over apparently hopeless difficulties or in the working out  of indifferent details takes place not only in full self-  consciousness, but in self-disgust; there we can take Carlyle  to witness.  But in the higher stages the fixation of truth  and the appreciation of beauty are accompanied by the same  extinction of the feeling of individuality.  Of testimony we  have enough and to spare.  I need not fill these pages with  confessions and anecdotes of the ecstatical state in which  all great deeds of art and science are done.  The question is  rather to understand and explain it on the basis of the formal  scheme to which we have found the religious and the aesthetic  attitudes to conform.    Jean Paul says somewhere that, however laborious the completion  of a great work, its conception came as a whole,--in one flash.  We remember the dreams of Schiller in front of his red curtain  and the resulting musikalische Stimmung,--formless, undirected,  out of which his poem shaped itself; the half-somnambulic  state of Goethe and his frantic haste in fixation of the vision,  in which he dared not even stop to put his paper straight, but  wrote over the corners quite ruthlessly.  Henner once said to  a painter who mourned that he had done nothing on his picture  for the Salon, though he saw it before him, \"What!  You see  your picture!  Then it is done.  You can paint it in an hour.\"  If all these traditions be true, they are significant; and  the necessary conditions of such composition seem to be highly  analogous to those of the aesthetic emotion.  We have, first  of all, a lack of outward stimulation, and therefore possible  disappearance of the background.  How much better have most  poets written in a garret than in a boudoir!  Goethe's bare  little room in the garden house at Weimar testifies to the  severe conditions his genius found necessary.  Tranquillity  of the background is the condition of self-absorption, or--  and this point seems to me worth emphasizing--a closed circle  of outer activities.  I have never believed, for instance, in  the case of the old tale of Walter Scott and the button, that  it was the surprise of his loss that tied the tongue of the  future author's rival.  The poor head scholar had simply made  for himself a transitionless experience with that twirling  button, and could then sink his consciousness in its object,--  at that moment the master's questions.  It is with many of  us a familiar experience, that of not being able to think  unless in constant motion.  Translated into our psychological  scheme, the efficiency of these movements would be explained  thus:  Given the \"whirling circles,\"--the background of  continuous movement sensations, which finally dropped out of  consciousness, and the foreground of continuous thought,--the  first protected, so to speak, the second, since they were  mutually exclusive, and what broke the one destroyed the other.    But to return from this digression, a background fading into  nothingness, either as rest or as a closed circle of automatic  movements, is the first condition of the ecstasy of mental  production.  The second is given in the character of its  object.  The object of high intellectual creation is a unity,--  a perfect whole, revealed, as Jean Paul says, in a single  movement of genius.  Within the enchanted circle of his  creation, the thinker is absorbed, because here too all his  impulses are turned to one end, in relation to which nothing  else exists.    I am aware that many will see a sharp distinction here between  the work of the creator or discoverer in science and the artist.  They may maintain, in Schopenhauer's phrase, that the aim and  end of science is just the connection of objects in the service  of the will of the individual, and hence transition between the  various terms is constant; while art, on the other hand, indeed  isolates its object, and so drops transitions.  But I think  where we speak of \"connection\" thus, we mean the larger sweep  of law.  If the thinker looks beyond his special problem at  all, it is, like Buddha, to \"fix his eyes upon the chain of  causation.\"  The scientist of imagination sees his work under  the form of eternity, as one link of that endless chain, one  atom in that vortex of almighty purposes, which science will  need all time to reveal.  For him it is either one question,  closed within itself by its own answer, or it is the Infinite  Law of the Universe,--the point or the circle.  From all points  of view, then, the object of creation in art or science is a  girdle of impulses from which the mind may not stray.  The two  conditions of our formal scheme are given:  a term which  disappears, and one which is a perfect whole.  Transition  between background and foreground has dropped.  Between the  objects of attention in the foreground it has no meaning,  because the foreground is an indissoluble unity.  With that  object the self must feel itself one, since the distinctive  self-feeling has disappeared with the opportunity for transition.    We have thus swung around the circle of mystical, aesthetic,  and creative emotion, and we have found a single formula to  apply, and a single explanation to avail for the loss of  personality.  The conditions of such experiences bring about  the disappearance of one term, and the impregnable unity of  the other.  Without transition between two terms in consciousness,  two objects of attention, the loss of the feeling of personality  takes place according to natural psychological laws.  It is no  longer a mystery that in intense experience the feeling of  personality dissolves.    One point, however, does remain still unexplained,--the bliss  of self-abandonment.  Whence are the definiteness and intensity  of the religious and aesthetic emotions?  The surrender of the  sense of personality, it seems, is based on purely formal  relations of the elements of consciousness, common to all three  groups of the analyzed emotions. Yet it is precisely with a  fading of self-feeling that intensity and definiteness deepen.  But how can different and emotionally significant feelings  arise from a single formal process?  How can the worship of  God become ecstatic joy through the loss of personality?  The  solution of this apparent paradox is demanded not only in  logic, but also by those who would wish to see the religious  trance distinguished also in its origin from those of baser  content.    But it is, after all, the formal nature of the phenomenon that  gives us light.  If variation in the degree of self-feeling is  the common factor, and the disappearance of the transition-  feeling its cause, then the lowest member of the scale, in  which the loss of self-feeling takes place with mathematical  completeness, must be included.  That is the hypnotic trance.  It is not necessary at this place to emphasize the fact that  our theory, if accepted, would constitute a theory and a  definition also of hypnotism.  Of interest to our inquiry is  merely a characteristic mark of the hypnotic state,--its  tremendous suggestibility.  Why is this?  Our theory would  answer that all impulses are held in equilibrium, and that an  external suggestion has thus no rivals.  Whatever the cause,  this last is at any rate the fact.  All suggestions seem to  double in emotional value.  Tell the hypnotic subject that  he is sailing up the Rhine, and the most vivid admiration is  in his aspect; he gazes in heart-felt devotion if it is a  pretty girl he is bid to look at; he quaffs a glass of water  with livelier delight than he would show for the draught of  Chateau Yquem of which he is led to think.    Now in religious and aesthetic experience there is brought  about the same equilibrium or unity of impulses, resulting  in analogous loss of self-feeling.  But it is a most  interesting fact that the FORM"]]]
