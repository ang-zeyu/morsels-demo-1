All our material welfare  has been brought about by men of enterprise. I feel almost ashamed of  writing down so trite a remark. Even if we were a nation of  entrepreneurs--such as absurdly exaggerated accounts make us out to  be--we should not require another nation to live on. We do not depend  on the circulation of old commodities, because we produce new ones.    The world possesses slaves of extraordinary capacity for work, whose  appearance has been fatal to the production of handmade goods: these  slaves are the machines. It is true that workmen are required to set  machinery in motion; but for this we have men in plenty, in  super-abundance. Only those who are ignorant of the conditions of Jews  in many countries of Eastern Europe would venture to assert that Jews  are either unfit or unwilling to perform manual labor.    But I do not wish to take up the cudgels for the Jews in this  pamphlet. It would be useless. Everything rational and everything  sentimental that can possibly be said in their defence has been said  already. If one's hearers are incapable of comprehending them, one is  a preacher in a desert. And if one's hearers are broad and high-minded  enough to have grasped them already, then the sermon is superfluous. I  believe in the ascent of man to higher and yet higher grades of  civilization; but I consider this ascent to be desperately slow. Were  we to wait till average humanity had become as charitably inclined as  was Lessing when he wrote \"Nathan the Wise,\" we should wait beyond our  day, beyond the days of our children, of our grandchildren, and of our  great-grandchildren. But the world's spirit comes to our aid in  another way.    This century has given the world a wonderful renaissance by means of  its technical achievements; but at the same time its miraculous  improvements have not been employed in the service of humanity.  Distance has ceased to be an obstacle, yet we complain of insufficient  space. Our great steamships carry us swiftly and surely over hitherto  unvisited seas. Our railways carry us safely into a mountain-world  hitherto tremblingly scaled on foot. Events occurring in countries  undiscovered when Europe confined the Jews in Ghettos are known to us  in the course of an hour. Hence the misery of the Jews is an  anachronism--not because there was a period of enlightenment one  hundred years ago, for that enlightenment reached in reality only the  choicest spirits.    I believe that electric light was not invented for the purpose of  illuminating the drawing-rooms of a few snobs, but rather for the  purpose of throwing light on some of the dark problems of humanity.  One of these problems, and not the least of them, is the Jewish  question. In solving it we are working not only for ourselves, but  also for many other over-burdened and oppressed beings.    The Jewish question still exists. It would be foolish to deny it. It  is a remnant of the Middle Ages, which civilized nations do not even  yet seem able to shake off, try as they will. They certainly showed a  generous desire to do so when they emancipated us. The Jewish question  exists wherever Jews live in perceptible numbers. Where it does not  exist, it is carried by Jews in the course of their migrations. We  naturally move to those places where we are not persecuted, and there  our presence produces persecution. This is the case in every country,  and will remain so, even in those highly civilized--for instance,  France--until the Jewish question finds a solution on a political  basis. The unfortunate Jews are now carrying the seeds of  Anti-Semitism into England; they have already introduced it into  America.    I believe that I understand Anti-Semitism, which is really a highly  complex movement. I consider it from a Jewish standpoint, yet without  fear or hatred. I believe that I can see what elements there are in it  of vulgar sport, of common trade jealousy, of inherited prejudice, of  religious intolerance, and also of pretended self-defence. I think the  Jewish question is no more a social than a religious one,  notwithstanding that it sometimes takes these and other forms. It is a  national question, which can only be solved by making it a political  world-question to be discussed and settled by the civilized nations of  the world in council.    We are a people--one people.    We have honestly endeavored everywhere to merge ourselves in the  social life of surrounding communities and to preserve the faith of  our fathers. We are not permitted to do so. In vain are we loyal  patriots, our loyalty in some places running to extremes; in vain do  we make the same sacrifices of life and property as our  fellow-citizens; in vain do we strive to increase the fame of our  native land in science and art, or her wealth by trade and commerce.  In countries where we have lived for centuries we are still cried down  as strangers, and often by those whose ancestors were not yet  domiciled in the land where Jews had already had experience of  suffering. The majority may decide which are the strangers; for this,  as indeed every point which arises in the relations between nations,  is a question of might. I do not here surrender any portion of our  prescriptive right, when I make this statement merely in my own name  as an individual. In the world as it now is and for an indefinite  period will probably remain, might precedes right. It is useless,  therefore, for us to be loyal patriots, as were the Huguenots who were  forced to emigrate. If we could only be left in peace....    But I think we shall not be left in peace.    Oppression and persecution cannot exterminate us. No nation on earth  has survived such struggles and sufferings as we have gone through.  Jew-baiting has merely stripped off our weaklings; the strong among us  were invariably true to their race when persecution broke out against  them. This attitude was most clearly apparent in the period  immediately following the emancipation of the Jews. Those Jews who  were advanced intellectually and materially entirely lost the feeling  of belonging to their race. Wherever our political well-being has  lasted for any length of time, we have assimilated with our  surroundings. I think this is not discreditable. Hence, the statesman  who would wish to see a Jewish strain in his nation would have to  provide for the duration of our political well-being; and even a  Bismarck could not do that.    For old prejudices against us still lie deep in the hearts of the  people. He who would have proofs of this need only listen to the  people where they speak with frankness and simplicity: proverb and  fairy-tale are both Anti-Semitic. A nation is everywhere a great  child, which can certainly be educated; but its education would, even  in most favorable circumstances, occupy such a vast amount of time  that we could, as already mentioned, remove our own difficulties by  other means long before the process was accomplished.    Assimilation, by which I understood not only external conformity in  dress, habits, customs, and language, but also identity of feeling and  manner--assimilation of Jews could be effected only by intermarriage.  But the need for mixed marriages would have to be felt by the  majority; their mere recognition by law would certainly not suffice.    The Hungarian Liberals, who have just given legal sanction to mixed  marriages, have made a remarkable mistake which one of the earliest  cases clearly illustrates; a baptized Jew married a Jewess. At the  same time the struggle to obtain the present form of marriage  accentuated distinctions between Jews and Christians, thus hindering  rather than aiding the fusion of races.    Those who really wished to see the Jews disappear through intermixture  with other nations, can only hope to see it come about in one way. The  Jews must previously acquire economic power sufficiently great to  overcome the old social prejudice against them. The aristocracy may  serve as an example of this, for in its ranks occur the  proportionately largest numbers of mixed marriages. The Jewish  families which regild the old nobility with their money become  gradually absorbed. But what form would this phenomenon assume in the  middle classes, where (the Jews being a bourgeois people) the Jewish  question is mainly concentrated? A previous acquisition of power could  be synonymous with that economic supremacy which Jews are already  erroneously declared to possess. And if the power they now possess  creates rage and indignation among the Anti-Semites, what outbreaks  would such an increase of power create? Hence the first step towards  absorption will never be taken, because this step would involve the  subjection of the majority to a hitherto scorned minority, possessing  neither military nor administrative power of its own. I think,  therefore, that the absorption of Jews by means of their prosperity is  unlikely to occur. In countries which now are Anti-Semitic my view  will be approved. In others, where Jews now feel comfortable, it will  probably be violently disputed by them. My happier co-religionists  will not believe me till Jew-baiting teaches them the truth; for the  longer Anti-Semitism lies in abeyance the more fiercely will it break  out. The infiltration of immigrating Jews, attracted to a land by  apparent security, and the ascent in the social scale of native Jews,  combine powerfully to bring about a revolution. Nothing is plainer  than this rational conclusion.    Because I have drawn this conclusion with complete indifference to  everything but the quest of truth, I shall probably be contradicted  and opposed by Jews who are in easy circumstances.

Conscious desire is made up partly of what is essential to desire,  partly of beliefs as to what we want. It is important to be clear as to  the part which does not consist of beliefs.    The primitive non-cognitive element in desire seems to be a push, not  a pull, an impulsion away from the actual, rather than an attraction  towards the ideal. Certain sensations and other mental occurrences have  a property which we call discomfort; these cause such bodily movements  as are likely to lead to their cessation. When the discomfort ceases,  or even when it appreciably diminishes, we have sensations possessing a  property which we call PLEASURE. Pleasurable sensations either stimulate  no action at all, or at most stimulate such action as is likely to  prolong them. I shall return shortly to the consideration of what  discomfort and pleasure are in themselves; for the present, it is  their connection with action and desire that concerns us. Abandoning  momentarily the standpoint of behaviourism, we may presume that hungry  animals experience sensations involving discomfort, and stimulating such  movements as seem likely to bring them to the food which is outside the  cages. When they have reached the food and eaten it, their discomfort  ceases and their sensations become pleasurable. It SEEMS, mistakenly, as  if the animals had had this situation in mind throughout, when in fact  they have been continually pushed by discomfort. And when an animal  is reflective, like some men, it comes to think that it had the final  situation in mind throughout; sometimes it comes to know what situation  will bring satisfaction, so that in fact the discomfort does bring the  thought of what will allay it. Nevertheless the sensation involving  discomfort remains the prime mover.    This brings us to the question of the nature of discomfort and pleasure.  Since Kant it has been customary to recognize three great divisions of  mental phenomena, which are typified by knowledge, desire and feeling,  where \"feeling\" is used to mean pleasure and discomfort. Of course,  \"knowledge\" is too definite a word: the states of mind concerned are  grouped together as \"cognitive,\" and are to embrace not only beliefs,  but perceptions, doubts, and the understanding of concepts. \"Desire,\"  also, is narrower than what is intended: for example, WILL is to be  included in this category, and in fact every thing that involves any  kind of striving, or \"conation\" as it is technically called. I do not  myself believe that there is any value in this threefold division of the  contents of mind. I believe that sensations (including images) supply  all the \"stuff\" of the mind, and that everything else can be analysed  into groups of sensations related in various ways, or characteristics of  sensations or of groups of sensations. As regards belief, I shall give  grounds for this view in later lectures. As regards desires, I have  given some grounds in this lecture. For the present, it is pleasure and  discomfort that concern us. There are broadly three theories that might  be held in regard to them. We may regard them as separate existing  items in those who experience them, or we may regard them as intrinsic  qualities of sensations and other mental occurrences, or we may regard  them as mere names for the causal characteristics of the occurrences  which are uncomfortable or pleasant. The first of these theories,  namely, that which regards discomfort and pleasure as actual contents in  those who experience them, has, I think, nothing conclusive to be said  in its favour.* It is suggested chiefly by an ambiguity in the word  \"pain,\" which has misled many people, including Berkeley, whom it  supplied with one of his arguments for subjective idealism. We may use  \"pain\" as the opposite of \"pleasure,\" and \"painful\" as the opposite of  \"pleasant,\" or we may use \"pain\" to mean a certain sort of sensation, on  a level with the sensations of heat and cold and touch. The latter use  of the word has prevailed in psychological literature, and it is now  no longer used as the opposite of \"pleasure.\" Dr. H. Head, in a recent  publication, has stated this distinction as follows:**         * Various arguments in its favour are advanced by A.       Wohlgemuth, \"On the feelings and their neural correlate,       with an examination of the nature of pain,\" \"British Journal       of Psychology,\" viii, 4. (1917). But as these arguments are       largely a reductio ad absurdum of other theories, among       which that which I am advocating is not included, I cannot       regard them as establishing their contention.         ** \"Sensation and the Cerebral Cortex,\" \"Brain,\" vol. xli,       part ii (September, 1918), p. 90. Cf. also Wohlgemuth, loc.       cit. pp. 437, 450.    \"It is necessary at the outset to distinguish clearly between  'discomfort' and 'pain.' Pain is a distinct sensory quality equivalent  to heat and cold, and its intensity can be roughly graded according to  the force expended in stimulation. Discomfort, on the other hand,  is that feeling-tone which is directly opposed to pleasure. It may  accompany sensations not in themselves essentially painful; as for  instance that produced by tickling the sole of the foot. The reaction  produced by repeated pricking contains both these elements; for it  evokes that sensory quality known as pain, accompanied by a disagreeable  feeling-tone, which we have called discomfort. On the other hand,  excessive pressure, except when applied directly over some nerve-trunk,  tends to excite more discomfort than pain.\"    The confusion between discomfort and pain has made people regard  discomfort as a more substantial thing than it is, and this in turn has  reacted upon the view taken of pleasure, since discomfort and pleasure  are evidently on a level in this respect. As soon as discomfort is  clearly distinguished from the sensation of pain, it becomes more  natural to regard discomfort and pleasure as properties of mental  occurrences than to regard them as separate mental occurrences on their  own account. I shall therefore dismiss the view that they are separate  mental occurrences, and regard them as properties of such experiences as  would be called respectively uncomfortable and pleasant.    It remains to be examined whether they are actual qualities of such  occurrences, or are merely differences as to causal properties. I do not  myself see any way of deciding this question; either view seems equally  capable of accounting for the facts. If this is true, it is safer to  avoid the assumption that there are such intrinsic qualities of  mental occurrences as are in question, and to assume only the causal  differences which are undeniable. Without condemning the intrinsic  theory, we can define discomfort and pleasure as consisting in causal  properties, and say only what will hold on either of the two theories.  Following this course, we shall say:    \"Discomfort\" is a property of a sensation or other mental occurrence,  consisting in the fact that the occurrence in question stimulates  voluntary or reflex movements tending to produce some more or less  definite change involving the cessation of the occurrence.    \"Pleasure\" is a property of a sensation or other mental occurrence,  consisting in the fact that the occurrence in question either does not  stimulate any voluntary or reflex movement, or, if it does, stimulates  only such as tend to prolong the occurrence in question.*         * Cf. Thorndike, op. cit., p. 243.    \"Conscious\" desire, which we have now to consider, consists of desire  in the sense hitherto discussed, together with a true belief as to its  \"purpose,\" i.e. as to the state of affairs that will bring quiescence  with cessation of the discomfort. If our theory of desire is correct,  a belief as to its purpose may very well be erroneous, since only  experience can show what causes a discomfort to cease. When the  experience needed is common and simple, as in the case of hunger, a  mistake is not very probable. But in other cases--e.g. erotic desire in  those who have had little or no experience of its satisfaction--mistakes  are to be expected, and do in fact very often occur. The practice of  inhibiting impulses, which is to a great extent necessary to civilized  life, makes mistakes easier, by preventing experience of the actions to  which a desire would otherwise lead, and by often causing the inhibited  impulses themselves to be unnoticed or quickly forgotten. The perfectly  natural mistakes which thus arise constitute a large proportion of what  is, mistakenly in part, called self-deception, and attributed by Freud  to the \"censor.\"    But there is a further point which needs emphasizing, namely, that a  belief that something is desired has often a tendency to cause the very  desire that is believed in. It is this fact that makes the effect of  \"consciousness\" on desire so complicated.    When we believe that we desire a certain state of affairs, that often  tends to cause a real desire for it. This is due partly to the influence  of words upon our emotions, in rhetoric for example, and partly to the  general fact that discomfort normally belongs to the belief that we  desire such-and-such a thing that we do not possess. Thus what was  originally a false opinion as to the object of a desire acquires a  certain truth: the false opinion generates a secondary subsidiary  desire, which nevertheless becomes real. Let us take an illustration.  Suppose you have been jilted in a way which wounds your vanity. Your  natural impulsive desire will be of the sort expressed in Donne's poem:         When by thy scorn, O Murderess, I am dead,    in which he explains how he will haunt the poor lady as a ghost, and  prevent her from enjoying a moment's peace. But two things stand in "]]]
