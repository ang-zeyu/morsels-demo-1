For from the time that we left the islands of Cape Verde until now, we  had been continually navigating within the Torrid Zone, and twice we  had crossed the equinoctial line; for, as I said before, we went 5 deg.  beyond it to the south, and now we were in 15 deg.[96] to the north. Being  in this state of mind, it pleased the Holy Spirit to give us some rest  from our great hardships; for as we were searching for a port in which  to repair our ships, we came upon a people who received us with much  friendship. We found that they had a very great quantity of oriental  pearls, and exceedingly good ones. We stayed with them forty-seven days,  and obtained from them 119 marcs of pearls for very little merchandise  in exchange. I believe the pearls did not cost us the value of forty  ducats. What we gave them was nothing but bells, and looking-glasses, and  beads,[97] and ten bells, and tin foil. For one bell a native gave all  the pearls he had. Here we learnt how they fished for them, and where,  and they gave us many shells in which they are born. We bartered for a  shell in which were born 130 pearls, and in others less. This one of 130  the Queen took, and others I put aside that they might not be seen. Your  Magnificence must know that if the pearls are not mature, and are not  detached, they soon perish, and of this I have had experience. When they  are mature, they are detached in the shell, and are placed among the  flesh. These are good. When they were bad the greater part were cracked  and badly bored. Nevertheless they are worth a good deal of money when  sold in the market.    At the end of forty-seven days we took leave of these very friendly  natives. We departed, and, for the sake of obtaining many things of which  we were in need, we shaped a course for the island of _Antiglia_,[98]  being that which Christopher Columbus discovered a few years ago. Here  we took many supplies on board, and remained two months and seventeen  days.[99] Here we endured many dangers and troubles from the same  Christians who were in this island with Columbus. I believe this was  caused by envy; but to avoid prolixity, I will refrain from recounting  what happened. We departed from the said island on the 22nd of July,[100]  and after a voyage of a month and a half, we entered the port of Cadiz  on the 8th of September,[101] being my second voyage. God be praised.    END OF THE SECOND VOYAGE.           *       *       *       *       *      EVIDENCE OF ALONSO DE HOJEDA    (_Respecting his Voyage of 1499-1500_).      _Alonzo de Hojeda_ gave evidence that the true reply to the question is,  that this witness is the said Hojeda, who was the first man that went  to make discoveries after the said Admiral, and that he discovered the  mainland to the south and coasted it for nearly 200 leagues to Paria,  and went out by the \"Boca del Drago\", and there he knew that the Admiral  had been at the island of Trinidad, near the \"Boca del Drago\", and that  he went on and discovered the coast of the mainland as far as the Gulf  of Pearls and the island of Margarita, where he landed, because he knew  that the Admiral had only sighted it, and thence he proceeded to discover  all the coast of the mainland from \"Los Frayles\" to the \"Islas de  los Gigantes\", the Gulf of Venecia, which is on the mainland, and the  provinces of Quinquilacoa. On all that land, from 200 leagues beyond  Paria, and from Paria to the Pearls, and from the Pearls to Quinquilacoa,  which this witness discovered, no one else had discovered or touched at,  neither the Admiral nor any other person, and in this voyage the said  witness took with him Juan de la Cosa and Morigo Vespuche, and other  pilots, and this witness was despatched for this voyage by order of  the said Don Juan de Fonseca, Bishop of Palencia, by order of their  Highnesses.[102]           *       *       *       *       *      VOYAGE OF HOJEDA, 1499-1500.    (_From Navarrete_, iii, pp. 3-11.)    In December 1498 the news arrived of the discovery of Paria. The splendid  ideas of the discoverer touching the beauty and wealth of that region  were presently made known, and the spirit of maritime enterprise was  revived with renewed vigour. Some of those who had sailed with the  Admiral, and had benefited by his instruction and example, solicited and  obtained from the Court licences to discover, at their own proper cost,  the regions beyond what was already known, paying into the Treasury a  fourth or fifth part of what they acquired.    The first who adventured was Alonso de Hojeda, a native of Cuenca.  Owing to his energy and the favour of the Bishop Don Rodriguez de Fonseca,  he soon collected the funds and the crews necessary for the equipment of  four vessels in the Port of Santa Maria, where Juan de la Cosa resided,    a great mariner according to popular ideas, and not inferior to the  Admiral himself in his own conceit. He had been a shipmate and pupil  of the Admiral in the expedition of Cuba and Jamaica. This man was the  principal pilot of Hojeda. They also engaged others who had been in the  Paria voyage. Among the other sharers in the enterprise, the Florentine  Americo Vespucci merits special mention. He was established in Seville,  but became tired of a mercantile life, and entered upon the study of  cosmography and nautical subjects, with the desire of embracing a more  glorious career. Perhaps this passion was excited by intercourse with the  Admiral in the house of Juan Berardi, a merchant, and also a Florentine,  and owing to his having become acquainted through this house with the  armaments and provisions for the Indies, so that he desired to place  his services at the disposal of the commander of the present enterprise.    With such useful companions Hojeda put to sea on the 18th[103] or the 20th  of May 1499.[104] They touched at the Canaries, where they took in such  supplies as they needed, and entered on the ocean voyage from Gomera,  following the route of the last voyage of the Admiral, for Hojeda was in  possession of the marine chart which Columbus had drawn. At the end of  twenty-four days they came in sight of the continent of the new world,  further south than the point reached by the Admiral, and apparently on  the coast of Surinam. They sailed along in sight of the coast for nearly  200 leagues, from the neighbourhood of the equator to the Gulf of Paria,  without landing. In passing, besides other rivers, they saw two very  large ones which made the sea water to be fresh for a long distance,  one coming from south to north, which should be the river now called  Essequibo in Dutch Guiana, and which was for some time called the _Rio  Dulce_. The course of the other was from west to east, and may have  been the Orinoco, the waters of which flow for many leagues into the sea  without mixing with the salt water. The land on the coast was, generally,  low and covered with very dense forest. The currents were exceedingly  strong towards the N. E., following the general direction of the coast.    The first inhabited land seen by our navigators was the island of  Trinidad, on the south coast of which they saw a crowd of astonished  people watching them from the shore. They landed at three different places  with the launches well provisioned, and twenty-two well-armed men. The  natives were Caribs, or Cannibals, of fine presence and stature, of great  vigour, and very expert in the use of bows and arrows, and shields, which  were their proper arms. Although they showed some reluctance to come near  the Spaniards at first, they were very soon satisfied of the friendly  intentions of the strangers, and bartered with them amicably. Thence  they entered the Gulf of Paria, and anchored near the river Guarapiche,  where they also saw a populous village of peaceful Indians near the  shore. They opened communications with the inhabitants, and, among  other presents, received from them a kind of cider made of fruits, as  well as some fruit like _mirabolans_, of exquisite flavour, and here  some pearls were obtained. They saw parrots of various colours; and they  parted company with these people on friendly terms. Hojeda says that they  found traces of the Admiral having been in the island of Trinidad, near  the Dragon's Mouth, which circumstance was carefully omitted by Vespucci.    Having passed the mouth of the terrible strait, Hojeda continued his  discovery along the coast of the mainland as far as the Gulf of Pearls  or Curiana, visiting and landing on the island of Margarita, which is  in front, as he knew that Columbus had only sighted it in passing. In  passing he noticed the islets called _Los Frailes_, which are nine miles  to the east, and north of Margarita, and the rock _Centinela_. Thence he  stood in shore by the cape _Isleos_ (now called _Codera_), anchoring in  the road which he called _Aldea vencida_. He continued to coast along  from port to port, according to the expression of the pilot Morales,  until he reached the _Puerto Flechado_, now _Chichirivichi_, where he  seems to have had some encounter with the Indians, who wounded twenty-one  of his men, of whom one died, as soon as he was brought to be cured,  in one of the coves that are between that port and the _Vela de Coro_,  where they remained twenty days. From this place they shaped a course  for the island of Curacoa, which they called _Isla de los Gigantes_,  where Americo supposed there was a race of uncommon stature. Perhaps  he did not understand the expressions of horror with which the natives  referred to the Caribs, and this sufficed to make Vespucci assert that he  had seen Pontasiloas and Antaeus.[105] They then crossed to a land which  they judged to be an island, distant ten leagues from Curacoa, and saw  the cape forming a peninsula, which they named _San Roman_, probably  because it was discovered on the 9th of August, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36962"],[0,"My Attainment of the Pole (#12)"],[1,"furniture. Their dress of furs gives the  Eskimos a look of savage fierceness which their kindly faces and easy  temperament do not warrant.    On board the yacht were busy days of barter. Furs and ivory were  gathered in heaps in exchange for guns, knives and needles. Every  seaman, from cabin boy to captain, suddenly got rich in the gamble of  trade for prized blue-fox skins and narwhal tusks.    The Eskimos were equally elated with their part of the bargain. For a  beautiful fox skin, of less use to a native than a dog pelt, he could  secure a pocket knife that would serve him half a lifetime!    A woman exchanged her fur pants, worth a hundred dollars, for a red  pocket handkerchief with which she would decorate her head or her igloo  for years to come.    Another gave her bearskin mits for a few needles, and she conveyed the  idea that she had the long end of the trade! A fat youth with a fatuous  smile displayed with glee two bright tin cups, one for himself and one  for his prospective bride. He was positively happy in having obtained  nine cents' worth of tin for only an ivory tusk worth ninety dollars!    With the coming of the midnight tide we lifted the schooner to an even  keel from the makeshift dry-dock on the beach. She was then towed out  into the bay by the launch and two dories, and anchored.    Our first walrus adventures began in Wolstenholm Sound during the  beautiful nightless days of mid-August. The local environment was  fascinating. The schooner was anchored in North Star Bay, a lake of  glitter in which wild men in skin canoes darted after seals and  eider-ducks. On grassy shores were sealskin tents, about which fur-clad  women and children vied with wolf-dogs for favorite positions to see the  queer doings of white men. A remarkable landmark made the place  conspicuous. A great table-topped rock rose suddenly out of a low  foreland to an altitude of about six hundred feet. About this giant  cliff, gulls, guillemots and ravens talked and winged uproariously. The  rock bore the native name of Oomanaq. With the unique Eskimo manner of  name-coining, the village was called Oomanooi.    Wolstenholm Sound is a large land-locked body of water, with arms  reaching to the narrow gorges of the overland sea of ice, from which  icebergs tumble ceaslessly. The sparkling water reflected the  surroundings in many shades of blue and brown, relieved by strong  contrasts of white and black. On the western sky line were the chiseled  walls of Acponie and other islands, and beyond a steel-gray mist in  which was wrapped the frozen sea of the Polar gateway. Fleets of  icebergs moved to and fro, dragging tails of drift bejeweled with blue  crystal.    Far out--ten miles from our outlook--there was a meeting of the  currents. Here, small pieces of sea-ice slowly circled in an eddy, and  upon them were herds of walruses. We did not see them, but their shrill  voices rang through the icy air like a wireless message. This was a  call to action which Mr. Bradley could not resist, and preparations were  begun for the combat.    The motor boat--the most important factor in the chase--had been  especially built for just such an encounter. Covered with a folding  whale-back top entirely painted white to resemble ice, we had hoped to  hunt walrus under suitable Arctic cover.    Taking a white dory in tow, two Eskimo harpooners were invited to  follow. The natives in kayaks soon discovered to their surprise that  their best speed was not equal to ours--for the first time they were  beaten in their own element. For ages the Eskimos had rested secure in  the belief that the kayak was the fastest thing afloat. They had been  beaten by big ships, of course, but these had spiritual wings and did  not count in the race of man's craft. This little launch, however, with  its rapid-fire gas explosions, made their eyes bulge to a wondering,  wide-open, seal-like curiosity. They begged to be taken aboard to watch  the loading of the engines; they thought we fed it with cartridges.    After a delightful run of an hour, a pan of ice was sighted with black  hummocks on it. \"_Ahwek! Ahwek!_\" the Eskimos shouted. A similar sound  floated over the oily waters from many walrus throats. The walruses were  about three miles to the southwest. At a slower speed we advanced two  miles more. In the meantime Mr. Bradley cleared the deck for action. The  direction of the hunting tactics was now turned over to My-ah. The mate  was at the wheel. I pushed the levers of the gasoline kicker. Our line  of attack was ordered at right angles to the wind. As we neared the  game, the engines were stopped.    Looking through glasses, the sight of the gregarious herd made our  hearts quicken. They were all males of tremendous size, with glistening  tusks with which they horned one another in efforts for favorable  positions. Some were asleep, others basked in the sun with heads turning  lazily from side to side. Now and then, they uttered sleepy, low grunts.  They were quivering in a gluttonous slumber, while the organs piled up  their bank account of fat to pay the costs of the gamble of the coming  winter night.    With muffled paddles the launch was now silently propelled forward,  while the kayaks stealthily advanced to deliver the harpoons. The Eskimo  reason for this mode of procedure is based on a careful study of the  walrus' habits. Its nose in sleep is always pointed windwards. Its ears  are at all times sensitive to noises from every direction, while the  eyes during wakeful moments sweep the horizon. But its horizon is very  narrow. Only the nose and the ear sense the distant alarm. We advanced  very slowly and cautiously, and that only when all heads were down. Our  boat slowly got within three hundred yards of the herd. Preparing their  implements to strike, the Eskimos had advanced to within fifty feet. The  moment was tense. Of a sudden, a tumultuous floundering sound smote the  air. The sleeping creatures awoke, and with a start leaped into the sea.  Turning their kayaks, the Eskimos paddled a wild retreat and sought the  security of the launch. The sport of that herd was lost to us. Although  they darted about under water in a threatening manner, they only rose to  the surface at a safe distance.    Scanning the surroundings with our glasses, about two miles to the  south another group was sighted. This time Bradley, as the chief nimrod,  assumed direction. The kayaks and the Eskimos were placed in the dory.  Tactics were reversed. Instead of creeping up slowly, a sudden rush was  planned. No heed was taken of noise or wind. The carburetor was opened,  the spark lever of the magneto was advanced to its limit, and we shot  through the waters like a torpedo boat. As we neared the herd, the dory,  with its Eskimos, was freed from the launch. The Eskimos were given no  instructions, and they wisely chose to keep out of the battle.    As we got to within two hundred yards, the canvas top of the launch fell  and a heavy gun bombardment began. The walruses had not had time to  wake; the suddenness of the onslaught completely dazed them. One after  another dropped his ponderous head with a sudden jerk as a prize to the  marksmen, while the launch, at reduced speed, encircled the  walrus-encumbered pan. Few escaped. There were heads and meat and skins  enough to satisfy all wants for a long time to follow. But the game was  too easy--the advantage of an up-to-date sportsman had been carried to  its highest degree of perfection. It was otherwise, however, in the  walrus battles that followed later--battles on the success of which  depended the possibility of my being able to assail the northern ice  desert, in an effort to reach the Polar goal.    Oomanooi was but one of six villages among which the tribe had divided  its two hundred and fifty people for the current season. To study these  interesting folk, to continue the traffic and barter, and to enjoy for a  short time the rare sport of sailing and hunting in this wild region,  we decided to visit as many of the villages as possible.    In the morning the anchor was raised and we set sail in a light wind  headed for more northern villages. It was a gray day, with a quiet sea.  The speed of the yacht was not fast enough to be exciting, so Mr.  Bradley suggested lowering the launch for a crack at ducks, or a chase  at walrus or a drive at anything that happened to cut the waters. His  harpoon gun was taken, as it was hoped that a whale might come our way,  but the gun proved unsatisfactory and did not contribute much to our  sport. In the fleet launch we were able to run all around the schooner  as she slowly sailed over Wolstenholm Sound.    Ducks were secured in abundance. Seals were given chase, but they were  able to escape us. Nearing Saunders Island, a herd of walruses was seen  on a pan of drift ice far ahead. The magneto was pushed, the carburetor  opened, and out we rushed after the shouting beasts. Two, with splendid  tusks, were obtained, and two tons of meat and blubber were turned over  to our Eskimo allies.    The days of hunting proved quite strenuous, and in the evening we were  glad to seek the comfort of our cosy cabin, after dining on eider-ducks  and other game delicacies.    A few Eskimos had asked permission to accompany us to a point farther  north. Among them was a widow, to whom, for herself and her children, we  had offered a large bed, with straw in it, between decks, but which,  savage as she was, she had refused, saying she preferred the open air on  deck. There she arranged a den among the anchor chains, under a shelter  of seal skins.    In tears, she told us the story of her life, a story which offered a  peep into the tragedy and at the same time the essential comedy of  Eskimo existence. It came in response to a question from me as to how  the world had used her, for I had known her years before. At my simple  question, she buried her face in her hands and "]]]
