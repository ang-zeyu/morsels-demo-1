Even in the case of a rarely generous-minded, tolerant and understanding  man, who judged the offence at its true computation, such knowledge  would only prove disturbing and a source of insecurity to conjugal  happiness. No good purpose of any kind can be served, and the ease which  confession is proverbially supposed to gain for the sinner would be  bought at a very heavy price.    'But two wrongs don't make a right, and surely it can't be proper for a  woman to deceive a man on such a vital point,' the stern moralist may  exclaim. Possibly not, according to the strictly ideal standard of  ethics; but, viewed from the larger standpoints of life and of  commonsense, this 'deceit' would appear to be advisable. And be assured,  my unpleasant moralist (I'm sure you are an unpleasant person), that the  sinner will not get off 'scot free,' as you seem to fear. Many and many  a stab will be her portion, for memory is a potent poison, and every  expression of love and trust from her husband will most likely carry its  own special sting, whilst the round, innocent eyes of adoring little  children, to whom she is a being that can do no wrong, will be a meet  punishment for an infinitely greater fault. Meanwhile the man is _in all  probability_ in every way a gainer by the woman's silence, for doubtless  he is doubly dear to her for the very fact that the first man treated  her badly, and she may perhaps be a better wife, a stronger and sweeter  woman, a more capable mother, by reason of the suffering she has  undergone.    Now let no maliciously obtuse person attribute to me the pernicious  doctrine that a woman with a past is the best wife for a man. I merely  say that a good woman who has surrendered herself to an ardent lover and  been afterwards deserted by him must necessarily have gone through such  intense suffering that her character is probably deepened thereby and  her capacity for love and faithfulness increased. It is another truism  that suffering is necessary to bring out the best qualities in women.    Men too should keep the details of their wild oats severely to  themselves. In married life there are bound to be secrets and the  happiest couples are those who know how to keep them, each to him or her  self. A very good motto for the newly betrothed would be that of Tom  Broadbent in _John Bull's Other Island_--'Let us have no  tellings--perfect confidence, but no tellings: that's the way to avoid  rows!'            V      A PLEA FOR THE WISER TRAINING OF GIRLS      If girls were more reasonably trained with regard to matters of sex,  there would be far fewer miserable wives in the world, and fewer  husbands would be driven to seek happiness outside their home circle.  If, when girls reach years of discretion, they were systematically  taught some rudimentary outline of the fundamental principles of  existence, instead of being left in utter ignorance as at present, the  extraordinarily false notions of sex which they now pick up would cease  to obtain, and a great deal of harm would thus be avoided. As it is,  maidens are now given tacitly to understand that the subject of sex is a  repulsive one, wholly unfit for their consideration, and the functions  of sex are loathsome, though necessary. I write tacitly with intention,  for little if anything is ever said to a girl on this subject; indeed,  it is extraordinary how the ideas are conveyed to her without words, but  inculcated somehow they certainly are, and it is difficult to understand  how mothers manage to reconcile this teaching with their evident wish  that their girls should marry. The ideal held up to girls nowadays is  apparently the sexless sort of Diana one--not merely chastity, but  sterility.    Most girls are aware from a very early age of the social advantages and  importance of marriage, and grow up with a keen desire to accomplish it  in due course, although secretly dreading it, because of their absurd  perverted ideas of its physical side. Why cannot girls--and boys too,  for that matter--be taught the plain truth (in suitable language of  course) that sex is the pivot on which the world turns, that the  instincts and emotions of sex are common to humanity, and in themselves  not base or degrading, nor is there any cause for shame in possessing  them, although it is necessary that they should be strenuously  controlled. Why cannot girls be taught that _all love_, even the  romantic love which occupies so large a portion of their dreams,  _springs from the instinct of sex_?[4] This may be thought a dangerous  lesson, but the present policy of silence on this subject is far more  dangerous, inducing as it does a tendency to brood over the forbidden  theme.        [Footnote 4: Schopenhauer's _Metaphysics of Love_.]    I remember when in my early teens a schoolfellow of about fifteen  confided in me that 'a man'--he was a harmless boy of about twenty--had  kissed her hand when passing her a tennis racquet. She drew her hand  indignantly away, and said: 'How dare you insult me!' then left the  tennis court and refused to play any more. I do not think many girls are  so silly as this, but the incident illustrates the general tone  inculcated at that school. And it shows what an emphasis on sex matters  the girl's mind had received, when she saw an insult in a perfectly  innocent and courteous act of admiring homage. What a harmful  preparation for life such training must be! This is the kind of teaching  that results in those wretched honeymoons which one occasionally hears  of in secret, and which produces unwilling wives whose disdainful  coldness is their husbands' despair. This lack of feeling and lack of  comprehension of the needs of stronger, warmer natures is one of the  deepest and most incurable causes of married misery.    Let us teach our girls to regard sex as a _natural_ and _ordinary_ fact,  and the infinite evils which spring from regarding it as extraordinary  and repulsive will thus be avoided. Let us bring them up to think that  loving wifehood, passionate motherhood are the proper expression of a  woman's nature and the best possible life for her.    In a very interesting book called _Woman in Transition_, recently  published, this view of woman's destiny is repeatedly scoffed at. The  writer, Annette B. Meakin, is a fellow of the Anthropological Institute,  and evidently widely read and travelled. I will give a few quotations:  'In the happy future when higher womanly ideals have spread around us we  shall all realise, no matter to which sex we belong, that to hold  unqualified motherhood before every girl's eyes as her highest ideal is  to play the traitor to our race and to humanity.' . . . 'English Head  Mistresses--though often unmarried themselves--still consider it their  pious duty to tell their pupils that motherhood is woman's highest  destiny, and the pupils . . . make marriage their first aim, and other  success in life has consequently to take a second place.' . . . 'Some  very good women in England are still telling our young girls that  motherhood is, for every woman, the worthiest goal, without suspecting  that the doctrine they preach is dangerously conducive to that legal  prostitution euphemistically known as loveless marriage, if not to  greater evils.' . . . 'How can any girl who has been taught that  maternity is woman's only destiny dare to run the risk of losing it?'    In answer to these objections: of course no sane person would hold  _unqualified_ motherhood up to girls as their noblest ideal. Nor does  any thoughtful individual believe that maternity is woman's _only_  destiny. But as to _highest_ (_i.e._ most noble) destiny--if worthy  motherhood (and by the word worthy I wish to imply all the fine  qualities of body and mind that go to produce healthy, intelligent, and  well-trained children) does not fulfil it, I should like to know what  does? In answer to this question that naturally springs to the mind of  every reader, Miss Meakin contents herself with the statement: 'In  Finland and Australia, as in America and Norway, the young girl is  taught that woman's highest destiny is within the reach of every woman;  that her highest destiny and her highest ideals depend, not on some man  who may or may not come her way, but on herself; and that the highest  ideal of womanhood is to be a true woman.' This is well enough, but it  is far too vague to be held up as woman's standard. We want a more  definite ideal than this to aim at. What, for instance, _is_ a 'true  woman' specifically? I should have thought the most essential part of  such a one's outfit was her potentialities for wifehood and motherhood.    Miss Meakin blames teachers for inculcating the importance of motherhood  into their pupils' minds with the result that 'other success in life has  to take a second place.' What then does this writer consider ought to  take the first place? Does she seriously think the success of women in  business or politics, as municipal councillors, as writers, artists,  thinkers, is of more importance than the success of women as mothers?  _Is it possible?_ . . . I recall a poem of W. E. Henley's on the woman  question, one line of which runs 'God in the garden laughed outright.'  Surely there must often be uproarious laughter in heaven nowadays when  the woman question is being discussed on earth!    So much for abstract ideals, but when we come to facts I must admit the  lady's argument is sound. 'In a country where there are a million and a  half more women than men,' she pertinently states, 'it is worse than  foolish to teach young girls that motherhood is their highest destiny.  Such teaching, if persisted in, will lead to greater evils than we care  to contemplate even at a distance.'
