A monthly magazine of the outdoors that is made for  outdoor men and women. Short, meaty, to-the-point articles tell the  \"how\" of living and playing in the open--whether hunting, fishing,  canoeing, camping, ice boating, skiing, swimming, shooting at the traps,  or any other outdoor sport. The adventure stories and fiction are the  kind that anyone with red blood likes to read. In addition to the great  number of articles and stories in ALL OUTDOORS is a feature that alone  makes the magazine worth its price--pictures. The best of outdoor  pictures are used to illustrate it. And each picture has a long caption  of concise information. ALL OUTDOORS is a magazine that not only  radiates the spirit of the woods and fields, streams and rivers, but it  tells you how to enjoy all these to the fullest. 15 cents a copy. $1.00  a year.    YACHTING. An illustrated monthly magazine devoted to the interest of the  man who loves the water--sailing and motor boating.

Every number combines the solid value  of sober fact with the alluring thrill of mystery and adventure that  still beckons us to the out-of-doors. $3.00 a year, 25c. a copy."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29728"],[0,"Cookery and Dining in Imperial Rome (#12)"],[1,"dants, even friends and advisors of men in high places,  emperors, (cf. life of Vitellius) and through their subtle influence  upon the mighty they may have contributed in no mean measure to the  fate of the nation. But such invisible string-pullers have not been  confined to those days alone. (Take Rasputin! Take the valet to  William I, reputed to have had more \"say\" than the mighty Bismarck,  who, as it developed, got \"the air\" while the valet died in his  berth.)    Such being the case, what potential power reposed in a greasy cookery  manuscript! And, if so, why bare such wonderful secrets to Tom, Dick  and Harry?    Weights and measures are given by Apicius in some instances. But just  such figures can be used artfully to conceal a trap. Any mediocre  cook, gaining possession of a choice collection of detailed and  itemized recipes would have been placed in an enviable position.  Experimenting for some time (at his master's expense) he would soon  reach that perfection when he could demand a handsome compensation for  his ministrations. Throughout antique times, throughout the middle  ages down to the present day (when patent laws no longer protect a  secret) strict secrecy was maintained around many useful and lucrative  formulae, not only by cooks, but also by physicians, alchemists and the  various scientists, artisans and craftsmen. Only the favorite  apprentice would be made heir to or shareholder in this important  stock in trade after his worthiness had been proven to his master's  satisfaction, usually by the payment of a goodly sum of  money--apprentice's pay. We remember reading in Lanciani (Rodolfo L.:  Ancient Rome in the Light of Recent Discoveries) how in the entire  history of Rome there is but one voice, that of a solitary,  noble-minded physician, complaining about the secrecy that was being  maintained by his colleagues as regards their science. To be sure,  those fellows had every reason in the world for keeping quiet: so  preposterous were their methods in most cases! This secrecy indeed  must have carried with it a blessing in disguise. Professional reserve  was not its object. The motive was purely commercial.    Seeing where the information given by Apicius is out of reason and  unintelligible we are led to believe that such text is by no means to  be taken very literally. On the contrary, it is quite probable that  weights and measures are not correct: they are quite likely to be of  an artful and studied unreliability. A secret private code is often  employed, necessitating the elimination or transposition of certain  words, figures or letters before the whole will become intelligible  and useful. If by any chance an uninitiated hand should attempt to  grasp such veiled directions, failure would be certain. We confess to  have employed at an early stage of our own career this same strategy  and time-honored camouflage to protect a precious lot of recipes.  Promptly we lost this unctuous manuscript, as we feared we would; if  not deciphered today, the book has long since been discarded as being  a record of the ravings of a madman.    The advent of the printing press changed the situation. With Platina,  ca. 1474, an avalanche of cookery literature started. The secrets of  Scappi, \"_cuoco secreto_\" to the pope, were \"scooped\" by an  enterprising Venetian printer in 1570. The guilds of French mustard  makers and sauce cooks (precursors of modern food firms and  manufacturers of ready-made condiments) were a powerful tribe of  secret mongers in the middle ages. English gastronomic literature of  the 16th, 17th and even the 18th century is crowded with \"closets  opened,\" \"secrets let out\" and other alluring titles purporting to  regale the prospective reader with profitable and appetizing secrets  of all sorts. Kitchen secrets became commercial articles.    These remarks should suffice to illustrate the assumption that the  Apicius book was not created for publication but that it is a  collection of abridged formulae for private use, a treasure chest as it  were, of some cook, which after the demise of its owner, collector,  originator, a curious world could not resist to play with, although  but a few experienced masters held the key, being able to make use of  the recipes.      MEAT DIET    In perusing Apicius only one or two instances of cruelty to animals  have come to our attention (cf. recipes No. 140 and 259). Cruel  methods of slaughter were common. Some of the dumb beasts that were to  feed man and even had to contribute to his pleasures and enjoyment of  life by giving up their own lives often were tortured in cruel,  unspeakable ways. The belief existed that such methods might increase  the quality, palatability and flavor of the meat. Such beliefs and  methods may still be encountered on the highways and byways in Europe  and Asia today. Since the topic, strictly speaking does not belong  here, we cannot depict it in detail, and in passing make mention of it  to refer students interested in the psychology of the ancients to such  details as are found in the writings of Plutarch and other ancient  writers during the early Christian era. It must be remembered,  however, that such writers (including the irreproachable Plutarch)  were advocates of vegetarianism. Some passages are inspired by true  humane feeling, but much appears to be written in the interest of  vegetarianism.    The ancients were not such confirmed meat eaters as the modern Western  nations, merely because the meat supply was not so ample. Beef was  scarce because of the shortage of large pastures. The cow was sacred,  the ox furnished motive power, and, after its usefulness was gone, the  muscular old brute had little attraction for the gourmet. Today lives  a race of beef eaters. Our beef diet, no doubt is bound to change  somewhat. Already the world's grazing grounds are steadily  diminishing. The North American prairies are being parcelled off into  small farms the working conditions of which make beef raising  expensive. The South American pampas and a strip of coastal land in  Australia now furnish the bulk of the world's beef supply. Perhaps  Northern Asia still holds in store a large future supply of meat but  this no doubt will be claimed by Asia. Already North America is  acclimating the Lapland reindeer to offset the waning beef, to utilize  its Northern wastes.    With the increasing shortage of beef, with the increasing facilities  for raising chicken and pork, a reversion to Apician methods of  cookery and diet is not only probably but actually seems inevitable.  The ancient bill of fare and the ancient methods of cookery were  entirely guided by the supply of raw materials--precisely like ours.  They had no great food stores nor very efficient marketing and  transportation systems, food cold storage. They knew, however, to take  care of what there was. They were good managers.    Such atrocities as the willful destruction of huge quantities of food  of every description on the one side and starving multitudes on the  other as seen today never occurred in antiquity.    Many of the Apician dishes will not appeal to the beef eaters. It is  worthy of note that much criticism was heaped upon Apicius some 200  years ago in England when beef eating became fashionable in that  country. The art of Apicius requires practitioners of superior  intellect. Indeed, it requires a superior clientele to appreciate  Apician dishes. But practitioners that would pass the requirements of  the Apician school are scarce in the kitchens of the beef eaters. We  cannot blame meat eaters for rejecting the average _chef d'{oe}uvre_  set before them by a mediocre cook who has learned little besides the  roasting or broiling of meats. Once the average man has acquired a  taste for the refined compositions made by a talented and experienced  cook, say, a composition of meats, vegetables or cereals, properly  \"balanced\" by that intuition that never fails the real artist, the  fortunate diner will eventually curtail the preponderant meat diet. A  glance at some Chinese and Japanese methods of cookery may perhaps  convince us of the probability of these remarks.    Nothing is more perplexing and more alarming than a new dish, but we  can see in a reversion to Apician cookery methods only a dietetic  benefit accruing to this so-called white race of beef eaters.    Apicius certainly excels in the preparation of vegetable dishes (cf.  his cabbage and asparagus) and in the utilization of parts of food  materials that are today considered inferior, hardly worth preparing  for the table except by the very careful and economical housekeeper.  Properly prepared, many of these things are good, often more  nutritious than the dearer cuts, and sometimes they are really  delicious.    One has but to study the methods of ancient and intelligent people who  have suffered for thousands of years under the perennial shortage of  food supplies in order to understand and to appreciate Apician  methods. Be it far from us to advocate their methods, or to wish upon  us the conditions that engendered such methods; for such practices  have been pounded into these people by dire necessity. They have  graduated from the merciless school of hunger.    Food materials, we repeat, were never as cheap and as abundant as they  are today. But who can say that they always will be so in the future?      SCIENCE CONFIRMING ANCIENT METHODS    We must not overlook the remarkable intuition displayed by the  ancients in giving preference to foods with body- and blood-building  properties. For instance, the use of liver, particularly fish liver  already referred to. The correctness of their choice is now being  confirmed by scientific re-discoveries. The young science of nutrition  is important enough to an individual who would stimulate or preserve  his health. But since constitutions are different, the most carefully  conceived dietary may apply to one particular "]]]
