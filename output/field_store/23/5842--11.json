It  is plain to be seen that great good was accomplished in the community  by this pair of Owls and their young, for the evil effects of the  rodents in life must have far overbalanced the good service of the one  useful Vesper Sparrow.    _A Seldom Recognised Blessing._--There are some large predatory birds  which destroy the lives of many game birds and others of the weaker  species.  On game farms, therefore, an unpleasant but necessary task is  the shooting or trapping of Hawks and Owls.  At first thought it might  seem best to wage a war of absolute extermination on these offenders,  and some game-keepers urge that this should be done.  Personally I am  opposed to any such course of action, one reason being that this would  not {117} necessarily forward the best interests of the game birds it  is desired to serve.  So important and yet so unexpected is the  ultimate effect of the activities of predatory creatures that in a  state of nature I am convinced the supply of game birds is increased  rather than decreased by being preyed upon.  Like all other creatures,  birds are subject to sickness and disease, but by the laws of nature it  appears that they are not designed to suffer long.  Their quick removal  is advisable if they are to be prevented from spreading contagion among  their fellows, or breeding and passing on their weakness to their  offspring.  Sometimes the Hawk, dashing at a covey of game birds, may  capture one of its strongest and healthiest members, but the chances  are that the afflicted member, which is not so quick on the rise or is  a little slower on the wing, is the one to be taken.  Just as some  savages are said to put to death the incompetent and unfit, so do the  laws operate which govern wild life.  If, therefore, we should destroy  all the Hawks, Owls, wild cats, foxes, skunks, {118} snakes, and other  predatory creatures, it is an open question whether in the long run our  game birds would be the gainers thereby.    Some time ago I visited a large game farm in one of the Southern  States, where for several years the owner had been engaged in raising  English Ring-necked Pheasants.   The gamekeeper stated that there were  about six thousand of these brilliantly coloured birds on the preserve  at that time.  He also pointed with pride to an exhibit on the walls of  a small house.  An examination showed that the two sides and one end of  this building were thickly decorated with the feet of Hawks, Crows,  Owls, domestic cats, minks, weasels, and other creatures that were  supposed to be the enemies of Pheasants.  Two men were employed on the  place to shoot and trap at all seasons, and the evidences of their  industry were nailed up, to let all men see that the owner of the big  game farm meant to allow no wild bird or animal to fatten on his game  birds.    A year later I again visited the same preserve and {119} found great  lamentation.  More than five thousand Pheasants had been swept away by  disease within a few weeks.  Is it going too far to say that the gunmen  and trappers had overdone their work?  So few Hawks or Owls or foxes  had been left to capture the birds first afflicted, that these had been  permitted to associate with their kind and to pass on weakness and  disease to their offspring until the general health tone of the whole  Pheasant community had become lowered.  In the end five-sixths of the  birds had succumbed to the devastations of disease.    All birds have their part to play in the great economy of the earth,  and it is a dangerous experiment to upset the balance of Nature.          {120}    CHAPTER VII    CIVILIZATION'S EFFECT ON THE BIRD SUPPLY    Twelve hundred kinds of wild birds have been positively identified in  North America.  About one-third of this number are called sub-species,  or climatic varieties.  To illustrate the meaning of \"sub-species,\" it  may be stated that in Texas the plumage of the Bob-White is lighter in  colour than the plumage of the typical eastern Bob-White, which was  first described to science; therefore, the Texas bird is known as a  sub-species of the type.  Distributed through North America are  nineteen sub-species of the eastern Song Sparrow.  These vary from the  typical bird by differences in size and shades of marking.  In a  similar way there are nine climatic variations of Screech Owls, six  Long-billed Marsh Wrens, and fourteen Horned Larks.  It is {121}  difficult to explain why this variation in colour and size is so  pronounced in some species and yet is totally absent in others of  equally wide range.  The Mourning Dove breeds in many localities from  the southern tier of Canadian Provinces southward throughout the United  States and Mexico, and yet everywhere over this vast range the birds  are the same in size and colour.  Nowhere do the individuals exhibit  any markings suggestive of climatic influences.    Some birds are very rare and are admitted to the list of North American  species because of the fact that during the years a few stragglers from  other parts of the world have been found on our continent.  Thus the  Scarlet Ibis from South America, and the Kestrel and Rook from western  Europe, are known to come to our shores only as rare wanderers who had  lost their way, or were blown hither by storms.  Eighty-five species of  the birds now listed for North America are of this extra-limital class.  Among those naturally inhabiting the country, some are, of course, much  more abundant than others, thus every one {122} knows that Bald Eagles  are comparatively rare, and that Robins and Chipping Sparrows exist by  millions.    _The Number of Birds in Different States._--The number of kinds of  birds found in any one State depends on the size of the State, its  geographical situation, and the varieties of its climate as affected by  the topography in reference to mountains, coastlines, etc.  The number  of bird students and the character of their field studies determine the  extent to which the birds of a State have been catalogued and listed.  The following list indicates the number of kinds of birds that have  been recorded in forty-three of the States and the District of  Columbia.  The authority for the statement in each instance and the  year in which the figures were given is also stated:      _Alabama_, 275 (Oberholser, 1909).    _Arizona_, 371 (Cooke, 1914).    _Arkansas_, 255 (Howell, 1911).    _California_, 541 (Grinnell, 1916).    _Colorado_, 403 (Cooke, 1912).    {123}    _Connecticut_, 334 (Sage and Bishop, 1913).    _Delaware_, 229 (Rennock, 1908).    _District of Columbia_, 293 (Cooke, 1913).    _Florida_, 362 (Thurston, 1916).    _Idaho_, 210 (Merrill, 1898).    _Illinois_, 390 (Cory, 1909).    _Indiana_, 321 (Butler, 1898).    _Iowa_, 356 (Anderson, 1907).    _Kansas_, 379 (Bunker, 1913).    _Kentucky_, 228 (Garman, 1894).    _Louisiana_, 323 (Byer, Allison, Kopman, 1915).    _Maine_, 327 (Knight, 1908).    _Maryland_, 290 (Kirkwood, 1895).    _Massachusetts_, 369 (Howe and Allen, 1901).    _Michigan_, 326 (Barrows, 1912).    _Minnesota_, 304 (Hatch, 1892).    _Missouri_, 383 (Widmann, 1907).    _Nebraska_, 418 (Swenk, 1915).    _Nevada_, 250 (Hoffman, 1881).    _New Hampshire_, 283 (Allen, 1904).    _New Jersey_, 358 (Stone, 1916).    {124}      _New Mexico_, 314 (Ford, 1911).    _New York_, 412 (Eaton, 1914).    _North Carolina_, 342 (Pearson and Brimley, '16).    _North Dakota_, 338 (Schmidt, 1904).    _Ohio_, 330 (Jones, 1916).    _Oregon_, 328 (Woodcock, 1902).    _Pennsylvania_, 300 (Warren, 1890).    _Rhode Island_, 293 (Howe and Sturtevant, 1899).    _South Carolina_, 337 (Wayne, 1910).    _Tennessee_, 223 (Rhoads, 1896).    _Texas_, 546 (Strecker, 1912).    _Utah_, 214 (Henshaw, 1874).    _Vermont_, 255 (Howe, 1902).    _Virginia_, 302 (Rives, 1890).    _Wellington_, 372 (Dawson, 1909).    _West Virginia_, 246 (Brooks, 1913).    _Wisconsin_, 357 (Kumlien and Hollister, 1903).    _Wyoming_, 288 (Knight, 1902).      For the five remaining States no list of the birds has as yet been  issued.    {125}    _Increase of Garden and Farm Birds._--The effect of civilization on the  bird life of North America has been both pronounced and varied in  character.  Ask almost any one over fifty years of age if there are as  many birds about the country as there were when he was a boy, and  invariably he will answer \"No!\"  This reply will be made, not because  all birds have decreased in numbers, but because there has come a  change in the man's ideas and viewpoint; in short, the change is  chiefly a psychological one.  The gentleman doubtless does not see the  birds as much as he did when he was a boy on a farm, or if he does,  they do not make the same impression on his mind.  It is but another  example of the human tendency to regard all things as better in the  \"good old times.\"  Let us turn then from such well-meant but inaccurate  testimony, and face the facts as they exist.  I have no hesitation in  saying that with many species of Finches, Warblers, Thrushes, and  Wrens, their numbers in North America have greatly increased since the  first coming of the white men to our shores.    {126}    It is a fact well known to careful observers that the deep, unbroken  forests do not hold the abundance of bird life that is to be found in a  country of farmlands, interspersed with thickets and groves.  Originally extensive regions of eastern North America were covered with  forests wherein birds that thrive in open countries could not find  suitable habitation.  As soon as the trees were cut the face of the  country began to assume an aspect which greatly favoured such species  as the Bobolink, Meadowlark, Quail, Vesper Sparrow, and others of the  field-loving varieties.  The open country brought them suitable places  to nest, and agriculture increased their food supply.  The settlers  began killing off the wolves, wild cats, skunks,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21012"],[0,"The Loyalists of America and Their Times, Vol. 1 of 2.

The remark  respecting the union between the colonies is not on the colony  records--it was inserted at the close of the copy delivered to the  Commissioners, in conformity to a letter from the Commissioners, written  to Governor Prince after they had left Plymouth. The conditions  expressed in the answer to the third proposition appeared so reasonable  to the Commissioners, that when they afterward met the General Assembly  of Connecticut, in April, 1663, their third proposition is qualified, in  substance, conformably to the Plymouth reply. (Morton's Memorial, Davis'  Ed., p. 417.)    It is thus seen that there was not the least desire on the part of King  Charles the Second, any more than there had been on the part of Charles  the First, to impose the Episcopal worship upon the colonists, or to  interfere in the least with their full liberty of worship, according to  their own preferences. All that was desired at any time was toleration  and acknowledgment of the authority of the Crown, such as the Plymouth  colony and that of Connecticut had practised from the beginning, to the  great annoyance of the Puritans of Massachusetts.    Several letters and addresses passed between Charles the Second and the  Pilgrim Government of Plymouth, and all of the most cordial character on  both sides; but what is given above supersedes the necessity of further  quotations.[15]    It was an object of special ambition with the Government of Plymouth to  have a Royal Charter like those of Massachusetts Bay, Connecticut, and  Rhode Island, instead of holding their land, acting under a Charter from  the Plymouth Council (England) and Charles the Second. In his last  address to Mr. Josiah Winslow, their Governor promised it to them in  most explicit terms; but there was a case of _quo warranto_ pending in  the Court of King's Bench against the Puritan Government for the  violation of their Charter, which delayed the issuing of a Royal Charter  to Plymouth. Charles died soon after;[16] the Charter of the  Massachusetts Corporation was forfeited by the decision of the Court,  and James the Second appointed a Royal Governor and a Royal  Commissioner, which changed for the time being the whole face of things  in New England.    It, however, deserves notice, that the Massachusetts Puritans, true to  their instinct of encroaching upon the rights of others, whether of the  King or of their neighbours, white or tawny, did all in their power to  prevent the Pilgrims of Plymouth--the pioneers of settlement and  civilization in New England--from obtaining a Royal Charter. This they  did first in 1630, again in the early part of Charles the Second's  reign, and yet again towards its end. Finally, after the cancelling of  the Massachusetts Charter, and the English Revolution of 1688, the  agents of the more powerful and populous Massachusetts colony succeeded  in getting the colony of Plymouth absorbed into that of Massachusetts  Bay by the second Royal Charter granted by William and Mary in 1692.  \"The junction of Plymouth with Massachusetts,\" says Moore, \"destroyed  all the political consequence of the former. The people of Plymouth  shared but few favours which the new Government had to bestow, and it  was seldom indeed that any resident of what was termed the old colony  obtained any office of distinction in the Provisional Government, or  acquired any influence in its councils.\"[17]    This seems a melancholy termination of the Government of the  Pilgrims--a princely race of men, who voluntarily braved the sufferings  of a double exile for the sake of what they believed to be the truth and  the glory of God; whose courage never failed, nor their loyalty wavered  amidst all their privations and hardships; who came to America to enjoy  religious liberty and promote the honour of England, not to establish  political independence, and granted that liberty to others which they  earned and had suffered so much to enjoy themselves; who were honourable  and faithful to their treaty engagements with the aborigines as they  were in their communications with the Throne; who never betrayed a  friend or fled from an enemy; who left imperishable footprints of their  piety and industry, as well as of their love of liberty and law, though  their self-originated and self-sustained polity perished at length, by  royal forgetfulness and credulity, to the plausible representations and  ambitious avarice of their ever aggressive Massachusetts Puritan  neighbours.    While the last act of the Pilgrims before leaving the _Mayflower_, in  the harbour of Cape Cod, was to enter into a compact of local  self-government for common protection and interests, and their first act  on landing at New Plymouth was, on bended knees, to commend themselves  and their settlement to the Divine protection and blessing, it is a  touching fact that the last official act of the General Assembly of the  colony was to appoint a day of solemn fasting and humiliation on the  extinction of their separate government and their absorption into that  of Massachusetts Bay.    It was among the sons and daughters of the Plymouth colony that almost  the only loyalty in New England during the American Revolution of the  following century was found. Most of the descendants of Edward Winslow,  and of his more distinguished son, Josiah Winslow, were loyalists during  that revolution.[18] In the councils of the mother country, the merits  of the posterity of the Pilgrims have been acknowledged; as in her  service some of them, by their talents and courage, have won their way  to eminence. Among the proudest names in the British navy are the  descendants of the original purchaser of Mattapoisett, in Swansey  (William Brenton, afterwards Governor of Rhode Island);[19] to the  distinguished title of one of the English peerage is attached the name  of one of the early settlers of Scituate, in the Plymouth colony  (William Vassall, who settled there in 1635.)[20]    \"In one respect,\" says Moore, \"the people of the Old Colony present a  remarkable exception to the rest of America. They are the purest English  race in the world; there is scarcely an intermixture even with the  Scotch or Irish, and none with the aboriginals. Almost all the present  population are descended from the original English settlers. Many of  them still own the lands which their early ancestors rescued from the  wilderness; and although they have spread themselves in every direction  through this wide continent, from the peninsula of Nova Scotia to the  Gulf of Mexico, some one of the family has generally remained to  cultivate the soil which was owned by his ancestors. The fishermen and  the navigators of Maine, the children of Plymouth, still continue the  industrious and bold pursuits of their forefathers. In that fine  country, beginning at Utica, in the State of New York, and stretching to  Lake Erie, this race may be found on every hill and in every valley, on  the rivers and on the lakes. The emigrant from the sandbanks of Cape Cod  revels in the profusion of the opulence of Ohio. In all the Southern and  South-Western States, the natives of the \"Old Colony,\" like the  Arminians of Asia, may be found in every place where commerce and  traffic offer any lure to enterprise; and in the heart of the peninsula  of Michigan, like their ancestors they have commenced the cultivation of  the wilderness--like them originally, with savage hearts and savage men,  and like them patient in suffering, despising danger, and"]]]
