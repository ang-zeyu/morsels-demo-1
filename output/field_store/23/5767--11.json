God be wi' you; and _God mend your       voices_. Come, Audrey.    The First Page's speech at l. 9. is most humorously appropriate. 'Both  in a tune, like two gipsies on a horse,' is a quaint description of a  duet. There is yet another pun on 'lost time' in ll. 36-8.    Jaques' cynicism comes out even in his limited dealings with music.    _As You_ IV, ii, 5.         _Jaques._ Have you no _song_, forester, for this purpose?         _2 Lord._ Yes, sir.         _Jaq._ Sing it; _'tis no matter how it be in tune, so it       make noise enough_.    Song follows, 'What shall he have, that kill'd the deer,' Rimbault, p.  19. Music by Hilton, date about 1600, probably the original setting, a  Round for four foresters.    This section will conclude with two quotations about singing of a more  serious turn.    _Tw._ II, iv, 1.         _Duke._ _Give me some music._--Now, good morrow, friends.            Now, good Cesario, but that _piece of song_,            That _old and antique song_, we heard last night;            Methought, it did relieve my passion much,            More than _light airs_, ...            Come; but _one verse_.         _Curio._ He is not here, so please your lordship, that       should sing it.         _Duke._ Who was it?         _Cur._ Feste, the jester, my lord: ...         _Duke._ Seek him out, and _play the tune the while_.         L. 20.         [To Cesario]--How dost thou like _this tune_?         _Viola._ _It gives a very echo_ to the seat            Where love is thron'd.         L. 43.         _Duke._ Mark it, Cesario; _it is old, and plain_;         [_Clown_ sings 'Come away, death.']         L. 67.         _Duke._ There's for thy pains.         _Clo._ _No pains, sir; I take pleasure in singing, sir._         _Duke._ I'll pay thy pleasure then.    'Light airs' in line 5 means 'vain fiddling jigs'--_i.e._, lively  instrumental music. Lines 20-22 and 43 are worth remembering for many  reasons.    The next and last passage requires no remark, except that 'organ pipe  of frailty' means simply the voice of the dying king.    _King John_ V, vii, 10. Death of K. John.         _Prince Henry._ Doth he still rage?         _Pembroke._                        He is more patient            Than when you left him: _even now he sung_.         _P. Hen._ _O vanity of sickness!..._            ... 'Tis _strange that death should sing_.            I am the _cygnet_ to this pale faint _swan_,            Who _chants a doleful hymn_ to his own death,            And, from the _organ-pipe of frailty_, sings            His soul and body to their lasting rest.          IV    SERENADES AND 'MUSIC'      The history of Serenades is as ancient as that of Songs. In the middle  of the 15th century, Sebastian Brant, a lawyer, wrote in Dutch his  'Stultifera Navis,' or 'Ship of Fools,' a severe satire on things in  general, and popular amusements in particular. The book was afterwards  translated into Latin, and thence into English. Here are some of the  verses that treat of Serenades in the year 1450.         'The furies fearful, sprong of the floudes of hell,       Bereft _these vagabonds_ in their minds, so       That by no meane can they abide ne dwell       Within their houses, but out they nede must go;       More wildly wandring then either bucke or doe.       Some with their _harpes_, another with their _lute_,       Another with his _bagpipe_, or a foolishe _flute_.         'Then measure they their _songes_ of melody       _Before the doores of their lemman deare_;       Howling with their foolishe songe and cry,       So that their lemman may their great folly heare:       'But yet moreover these fooles are so unwise,       That _in cold winter_ they use the same madness.       When all the houses are lade with snowe and yse,       O madmen amased, unstable, and witless!       What pleasure take you in this your foolishness?       What joy have ye to wander thus by night,       Save that _ill doers alway hate the light_?'    Another verse explains that not only the foolish young men of _low_  birth were given to this practice, but also--                 'States themselves therein abuse,'       'With _some yonge fooles of the spiritualtie_:       The foolish _pipe_ without all gravitie       Doth eche degree call to his frantic game:       The darkness of night expelleth feare of shame.'    Brant had no great opinion of the music provided either. He describes  their singing before their lady's window--         'One barketh, another bleateth like a shepe;       Some rore, some _counter_, some their _ballads fayne_:       Another from singing geveth himself to wepe;       When his soveraigne lady hath of him disdayne.'    Finally--a Parthian shot--         'Standing in corners like as it were a spye,       Whether that the wether be whot, colde, wet, or dry.'    Thus, one hundred years before Shakespeare was born, Serenades of  voices and instruments were common, and in general practice by all  classes of young men, and not only laymen, but also yonge fooles of  the spiritualtie.    The instruments mentioned are such as were still in use in  Shakespeare's time--viz., harp, lute, 'foolish' pipe, bagpipe, and  'foolish' flute, besides the several varieties of song, which  evidently included both solo and part singing--'feigned' ballads for a  single voice [ballads, that is, in the more refined 'keys' of 'Musica  Ficta'], and 'Countering,' which implies that two voices at least took  part.    The following passage is an example of this nocturnal serenading by a  company of gentlemen.    _Two Gent._ III, ii, 83.         _Proteus_ (advises Thurio)            'Visit by night your lady's chamber window            With some _sweet concert_: to their _instruments_            Tune a _deploring dump_:'         _Thu._ And thy advice this night I'll put in practice.            Therefore, sweet Proteus, my direction-giver,            Let us into the city presently,            _To sort some gentlemen well skilled in music_.    Proteus advises Thurio to get a 'consort' (probably of viols) to play  a 'dump' under Silvia's window. He goes to arrange for some of his  friends to attend for this purpose. The serenade takes place in the  next Act, where, in the 2nd scene, line 17, it is called 'evening  music,' but does not include the 'dump,' for Thurio has 'a sonnet that  will serve the turn,' so they sing 'Who is Silvia.'    Here is the passage, which is full of quibbles on musical terms.    _Two Gent._ IV, ii, 16.         _Proteus._ ... 'Now must we to her window,            And give _some evening music to her ear_.'         L. 24.         _Thu._ ... Now, gentlemen,            _Let's tune._         L. 28.         _Host_ (to Julia, in boy's clothes). I'll bring you where       you shall _hear music_, and see the gentleman that you ask'd       for.         _Jul._ But shall I _hear him speak_?         _Host._ Ay, that you shall.         _Jul._ _That will be music._         L. 54.         _Host._ How do you, man? (_i.e._, Julia) the _music likes       you not_.         _Jul._ You mistake: the _musician_ (_i.e._, Proteus) _likes       me not_.         _Host._ Why, my pretty youth?         _Jul._ He _plays false_, father.         _Host._ How? _out of tune on the strings_?         _Jul._ Not so; but yet _so false_, that he grieves my very       _heart-strings_.         _Host._ You have a _quick ear_.         _Jul._ Ay; I would I were deaf! it makes me have a _slow       heart_.         _Host._ I perceive, _you delight not in music_.         _Jul._ Not a whit, when it _jars_ so.         _Host._ Hark! what fine _change_ is in the music.         _Jul._ Ay, that _change_ (Proteus' unfaithfulness) is the       spite.         _Host_ (misunderstanding again). You would have them       _always_ play but _one thing_?         _Jul._ I would always have _one_ (Proteus) play but one       thing.         L. 85.         _Silvia_ (from window). 'I thank you for your music,       gentlemen.'    The next passage is of a serenade in the early morning. Cloten  arranges for the musicians (who seem in this case to be professional  players) to give two pieces, one instrumental, followed by a song.    _Cymbeline_ II, iii, 11. Cloten serenades Imogen.         _Cloten._ I would this _music would come_. I am advised to       give her _music o' mornings_; they say, it will penetrate.         _Enter Musicians._         Come on: _tune_. If you can penetrate her with your       _fingering_, so; we'll try with _tongue_ too: ... _First_, a       very excellent good-conceited thing; _after_, a wonderful       sweet air, with admirable rich words to it,--_and then_ let       her consider.         [The musicians perform 'Hark! hark! the lark.']         So, get you gone. If this penetrate, I will consider your       _music the better_; if it do not, it is a vice in _her       ears_, which _horse-hairs_, and _calves'-guts_, ... can       never amend.    In l. 14, 'fingering' and 'tongue' correspond to 'playing' and  'singing.' The first is to be a 'Fancy' for viols, 'a very excellent  good-conceited thing'; the second is the 'wonderful sweet air,' Hark!  hark! the lark.    'Good-conceited' means having many 'conceits.' These 'fancies' were  always contrapuntal, and the various artificial contrivances,  answering of points, imitations, and what not, are referred to under  this title. The mention of 'horse-hairs and calves'-guts' makes it  clear that the instruments in this 'morning music' were Viols.    Another 'evening music' is provided by Pericles, Prince of Tyre.    _Pericles_ II, v, 24. Pericles, a "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19699"],[0,"Encyclopaedia Britannica, 11th Edition, \"Bréquigny, Louis Georges Oudard Feudrix (#13)"],[1,"sent out of the brewery  within a week or ten days of mashing. It is usual to add some hops in cask  (this is called _dry hopping_) in the case of many of the better beers.  Running beers, which must be put into condition rapidly, or beers that have  become flat, are generally _primed_. Priming consists in adding a small  quantity of sugar solution to the beer in cask. This rapidly ferments and  so produces \"condition.\"    _Fining_.--As a very light article is desired nowadays, and this has to be  provided in a short time, artificial means must be resorted to, in order to  replace the natural fining or brightening which storage brings about.  _Finings_ generally consist of a solution or semi-solution of isinglass in  sour beer, or in a solution of tartaric acid or of sulphurous acid. After  the finings are added to the beer and the barrels have been well rolled,  the finings slowly precipitate (or work out through the bung-hole) and  carry with them the matter which would otherwise render the beer turbid.    _Bottling_.--Formerly it was the general custom to brew a special beer for  bottling, and this practice is still continued by some brewers. It is  generally admitted that the special brew, matured by storage and an  adequate secondary fermentation, produces the best beer for bottling, but  the modern taste for a very light and bright bottled beer at a low cost has  necessitated the introduction of new methods. The most interesting among  these is the \"chilling\" and \"carbonating\" system. In this the beer, when it  is ripe for racking, is first \"chilled,\" that is, cooled to a very low  temperature. As a result, there is an immediate deposition of much matter  which otherwise would require prolonged time to settle. The beer is then  filtered and so rendered quite bright, and finally, in order to produce  immediate \"condition,\" is \"carbonated,\" _i.e._ impregnated under pressure  with carbon dioxide (carbonic acid gas).    FOREIGN BREWING AND BEERS.--The system of brewing which differs most widely  from the English _infusion_ and _top fermentation_ method is the  _decoction_ and _bottom fermentation_ system, so widely employed, chiefly  on the continent of Europe, for the production of beers of the \"lager\"  type.    The method pursued in the decoction system is broadly as follows:--After  the grist has been mashed with cold water until a homogeneous mixture  ensues, sufficient hot water is introduced into the mash-tun to raise the  temperature to 85-100 deg. F., according to circumstances. Thereupon, about  one-third of the mash (including the \"goods\") is transferred to the _Maisch  Kessel_ (mash copper), in which it is gradually brought to a temperature of  (about) 165 deg. F., and this heat is maintained until the mash becomes  transparent. The _Dickmaische_, as this portion is called, is then raised  to the boil, and the ebullition sustained between a quarter and  three-quarters of an hour. Just sufficient of the _Dickmaische_ is returned  to the mash-tun proper to raise the temperature of the whole to 111-125 deg.  F., and after a few minutes a third is again withdrawn and treated as  before, to form the second \"thick mash.\" When the latter has been returned  to the mash-tun the whole is thoroughly worked up, allowed to stand in  order that the solids may deposit, and then another third (called the  _Laeutermaische_ or \"clear mash\") is withdrawn, boiled until the coagulable  albuminoids are precipitated, and finally reconveyed to the mash-tun, where  the mashing is continued for some time, the final heat being rather over  160 deg. F. The wort, after boiling with hops and cooling, much as in the  English system, is subjected to the peculiar system of fermentation called  _bottom fermentation_. In this system the \"pitching\" and fermentation take  place at a very low temperature and, compared with the English system, in  very small vessels. The fermenting cellars are maintained at a temperature  of about 37-38 deg. F., and the temperature of the fermenting wort does not  rise above 50 deg. F. The yeast, which is of a different type from that  employed in the English system, remains at the bottom of the fermenting  tun, and hence is derived the name of \"bottom fermentation\" (see  FERMENTATION). The primary fermentation lasts about eleven to twelve days  (as compared with three days on the English system), and the beer is then  run into store (lager) casks where it remains at a temperature approaching  the freezing-point of water for six weeks to six months, according to the  time of the year and the class of the beer. As to the relative character  and stability of decoction and infusion beers, the latter are, as a rule,  more alcoholic; but the former contain more unfermented malt extract, and  are therefore, broadly speaking, more nutritive. Beers of the German type  are less heavily hopped and more peptonized than English beers, and more  highly charged with carbonic acid, which, owing to the low fermentation and  storing temperatures, is retained for a comparatively long time and keeps  the beer in condition. On the other hand, infusion beers are of a more  stable and stimulating character. It is impossible to keep \"lager\" beer on  draught in the ordinary sense of the term in England. It will not keep  unless placed on ice, and, as a matter of fact, the \"condition\" of lager is  dependent to a far greater extent on the methods of distribution and  storage than is the case with infusion beers. If a cask is opened it must  be rapidly consumed; indeed it becomes undrinkable within a very few hours.  The gas escapes rapidly when the pressure is released, the temperature  rises, and the beer becomes flat and mawkish. In Germany every publican is  bound to have an efficient supply of ice, the latter frequently being  delivered by the brewery together with the beer.    In America the common system of brewing is one of infusion mashing combined  with bottom fermentation. The method of mashing, however, though on  infusion lines, differs appreciably from the English process. A very low  initial heat--about 100 deg. F.--at which the mash remains for about an hour,  is employed. After this the temperature is rapidly raised to 153-156 deg. F. by  running in the boiling \"cooker mash,\" _i.e._ raw grain wort from the  converter. After a period the temperature is gradually increased to about  165 deg. F. The very low initial heat, and the employment of relatively large  quantities of readily transformable malt adjuncts, enable the American  brewer to make use of a class of malt which would be considered quite unfit  for brewing in an English brewery. The system of fermentation is very  similar to the continental \"lager\" system, and the beer obtained bears some  resemblance to the German product. To the English palate it is somewhat  flavourless, but it is always retailed in exceedingly brilliant condition  and at a proper temperature. There can be little doubt that every nation  evolves a type of beer most suited to its climate and the temperament of  the people, and in this respect the modern American beer is no exception.  In regard to plant and mechanical arrangements generally, the modern  American breweries may serve as an object-lesson to the European brewer,  although there are certainly a number of breweries in the United Kingdom  which need not fear comparison with the best American plants.    It is a sign of the times and further evidence as to the growing taste for  a lighter type of beer, that lager brewing in its most modern form has now  fairly taken root in Great Britain, and in this connexion the process  introduced by Messrs Allsopp exhibits many features of interest. The  following is a brief description of the plant and the methods  employed:--The wort is prepared on infusion lines, and is then cooled by  means of refrigerated brine before passing to a temporary store tank, which  serves as a gauging vessel. From the latter the wort passes directly to the  fermenting tuns, huge closed cylindrical vessels made of sheet-steel and  coated with glass enamel. There the wort ferments under reduced pressure,  the carbonic acid generated being removed by means of a vacuum pump, and  the gas thus withdrawn is replaced by the introduction of cool sterilized  air. The fermenting cellars are kept at 40 deg. F. The yeast employed is a pure  culture (see FERMENTATION) bottom yeast, but the withdrawal of the products  of yeast metabolism and the constant supply of pure fresh air cause the  fermentation to proceed far more rapidly than is the case with lager beer  brewed on ordinary lines. It is, in fact, finished in about six days.  Thereupon the air-supply is cut off, the green beer again cooled to 40 deg. F.  and [v.04 p.0512] then conveyed by means of filtered air pressure to the  store tanks, where secondary fermentation, lasting three weeks, takes  place. The gases evolved are allowed to collect under pressure, so that the  beer is thoroughly charged with the carbonic acid necessary to give it  condition. Finally the beer is again cooled, filtered, racked and bottled,  the whole of these operations taking place under counter pressure, so that  no gas can escape; indeed, from the time the wort leaves the copper to the  moment when it is bottled in the shape of beer, it does not come into  contact with the outer air.    The preparation of the Japanese beer _sake_ (_q.v._) is of interest. The  first stage consists in the preparation of _Koji_, which is obtained by  treating steamed rice with a culture of _Aspergillus oryzae_. This  micro-organism converts the starch into sugar. The _Koji_ is converted into  _moto_ by adding it to a thin paste of fresh-boiled starch in a vat.  Fermentation is set up and lasts for 30 to 40 days. The third stage  consists in adding more rice and _Koji_ to the _moto_, together with some  water. A secondary fermentation, lasting from 8 to 10 days, ensues.  Subsequently the whole is"]]]
