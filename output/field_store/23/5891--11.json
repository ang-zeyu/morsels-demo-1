Backing with a start of affected surprise at the  sight of the strained cable, she pounced on it like a kitten, while the  spray of her descent burst through the hawse-holes with the report of a  gun. Shaking her head, she would say: \"Well, I'm sorry I can't stay any  longer with you. I'm going North,\" and would sidle off, halting  suddenly with a dramatic rattle of her rigging. \"As I was just going to  observe,\" she would begin, as gravely as a drunken man addressing a  lamp-post. The rest of the sentence (she acted her words in dumb-show,  of course) was lost in a fit of the fidgets, when she behaved like a  puppy chewing a string, a clumsy woman in a side-saddle, a hen with her  head cut off, or a cow stung by a hornet, exactly as the whims of the  sea took her.    \"See her sayin' her piece. She's Patrick Henry naow,\" said Dan.    She swung sideways on a roller, and gesticulated with her jib-boom from  port to starboard.    \"But-ez---fer-me, give me liberty--er give me-death!\"    Wop! She sat down in the moon-path on the water, courtesying with a  flourish of pride impressive enough had not the wheel-gear sniggered  mockingly in its box.    Harvey laughed aloud. \"Why, it's just as if she was alive,\" he said.    \"She's as stiddy as a haouse an' as dry as a herrin',\" said Dan,  enthusiastically, as he was stung across the deck in a batter of spray.  \"Fends 'em off an 'fends 'em off, an' 'Don't ye come anigh me,' she  sez. Look at her--jest look at her! Sakes! You should see one o' them  toothpicks h'istin' up her anchor on her spike outer fifteen-fathom  water.\"    \"What's a toothpick, Dan?\"    \"Them new haddockers an' herrin'-boats. Fine's a yacht forward, with  yacht sterns to 'em, an' spike bowsprits, an' a haouse that u'd take  our hold. I've heard that Burgess himself he made the models fer three  or four of 'em, Dad's sot ag'in' 'em on account o' their pitchin' an'  joltin', but there's heaps o' money in 'em. Dad can find fish, but he  ain't no ways progressive--he don't go with the march o' the times.  They're chock-full o' labour-savin' jigs an' sech all. 'Ever seed the  Elector o' Gloucester? She's a daisy, ef she is a toothpick.\"    \"What do they cost, Dan?\"    \"Hills o' dollars. Fifteen thousand, p'haps; more, mebbe. There's  gold-leaf an' everything you kin think of.\" Then to himself, half under  his breath \"Guess I'd call her Hattie S., too.\"        CHAPTER V    That was the first of many talks with Dan, who told Harvey why he would  transfer his dory's name to the imaginary Burgess-modelled haddocker.  Harvey heard a good deal about the real Hattie at Gloucester; saw a  lock of her hair--which Dan, finding fair words of no avail, had  \"hooked\" as she sat in front of him at school that winter--and a  photograph. Hattie was about fourteen years old, with an awful contempt  for boys, and had been trampling on Dan's heart through the winter. All  this was revealed under oath of solemn secrecy on moonlit decks, in the  dead dark, or in choking fog; the whining wheel behind them, the  climbing deck before, and without, the unresting, clamorous sea. Once,  of course, as the boys came to know each other, there was a fight,  which raged from bow to stern till Penn came up and separated them, but  promised not to tell Disko, who thought fighting on watch rather worse  than sleeping. Harvey was no match for Dan physically, but it says a  great deal for his new training that he took his defeat and did not try  to get even with his conqueror by underhand methods.    That was after he had been cured of a string of boils between his  elbows and wrists, where the wet jersey and oilskins cut into the  flesh. The salt water stung them unpleasantly, but when they were ripe  Dan treated them with Disko's razor, and assured Harvey that now he was  a \"blooded Banker\"; the affliction of gurry-sores being the mark of the  caste that claimed him.    Since he was a boy and very busy, he did not bother his head with too  much thinking. He was exceedingly sorry for his mother, and often  longed to see her and above all to tell her of his wonderful new life,  and how brilliantly he was acquitting himself in it. Otherwise he  preferred not to wonder too much how she was bearing the shock of his  supposed death. But one day, as he stood on the fo'c'sle ladder, guying  the cook, who had accused him and Dan of hooking fried pies, it  occurred to him that this was a vast improvement on being snubbed by  strangers in the smoking-room of a hired liner.    He was a recognised part of the scheme of things on the \"We're Here\";  had his place at the table and among the bunks; and could hold his own  in the long talks on stormy days, when the others were always ready to  listen to what they called his \"fairy-tales\" of his life ashore. It did  not take him more than two days and a quarter to feel that if he spoke  of his own life--it seemed very far away--no one except Dan (and even  Dan's belief was sorely tried) credited him. So he invented a friend, a  boy he had heard of, who drove a miniature four-pony drag in Toledo,  Ohio, and ordered five suits of clothes at a time, and led things  called \"germans\" at parties where the oldest girl was not quite  fifteen, but all the presents were solid silver. Salters protested that  this kind of yarn was desperately wicked, if not indeed positively  blasphemous, but he listened as greedily as the others; and their  criticisms at the end gave Harvey entirely new notions on \"germans,\"  clothes, cigarettes with gold-leaf tips, rings, watches, scent, small  dinner-parties, champagne, card-playing, and hotel accommodation.  Little by little he changed his tone when speaking of his \"friend,\"  whom Long Jack had christened \"the Crazy Kid,\" \"the Gilt-edged Baby,\"  \"the Suckin' Vanderpoop,\" and other pet names; and with his sea-booted  feet cocked up on the table would even invent histories about silk  pajamas and specially imported neckwear, to the \"friend's\" discredit.  Harvey was a very adaptable person, with a keen eye and ear for every  face and tone about him.    Before long he knew where Disko kept the old green-crusted quadrant  that they called the \"hog-yoke\"--under the bed-bag in his bunk. When he  'took the sun, and with the help of \"The Old Farmer's\" almanac found  the latitude, Harvey would jump down into the cabin and scratch the  reckoning and date with a nail on the rust of the stove-pipe. Now, the  chief engineer of the liner could have done no more, and no engineer of  thirty years' service could have assumed one half of the  ancient-mariner air with which Harvey, first careful to spit over the  side, made public the schooner's position for that day, and then and  not till then relieved Disko of the quadrant. There is an etiquette in  all these things.    The said \"hog-yoke,\" an Eldridge chart, the farming almanac, Blunt's  \"Coast Pilot,\" and Bowditch's \"Navigator\" were all the weapons Disko  needed to guide him, except the deep-sea lead that was his spare eye.  Harvey nearly slew Penn with it when Tom Platt taught him first how to  \"fly the blue pigeon\"; and, though his strength was not equal to  continuous sounding in any sort of a sea, for calm weather with a  seven-pound lead on shoal water Disko used him freely. As Dan said:  \"'Tain't soundin's dad wants. It's samples. Grease her up good, Harve.\"  Harvey would tallow the cup at the end, and carefully bring the sand,  shell, sludge, or whatever it might be, to Disko, who fingered and  smelt it and gave judgment. As has been said, when Disko thought of cod  he thought as a cod; and by some long-tested mixture of instinct and  experience, moved the \"We're Here\" from berth to berth, always with the  fish, as a blindfolded chess-player moves on the unseen board.    But Disko's board was the Grand Bank--a triangle two hundred and fifty  miles on each side a waste of wallowing sea, cloaked with dank fog,  vexed with gales, harried with drifting ice, scored by the tracks of  the reckless liners, and dotted with the sails of the fishing-fleet.    For days they worked in fog--Harvey at the bell--till, grown familiar  with the thick airs, he went out with Tom Platt, his heart rather in  his mouth. But the fog would not lift, and the fish were biting, and no  one can stay helplessly afraid for six hours at a time. Harvey devoted  himself to his lines and the gaff or gob-stick as Tom Platt called for  them; and they rowed back to the schooner guided by the bell and Tom's  instinct; Manuel's conch sounding thin and faint beside them. But it  was an unearthly experience, and, for the first time in a month, Harvey  dreamed of the shifting, smoking floors of water round the dory, the  lines that strayed away into nothing, and the air above that melted on  the sea below ten feet from his straining eyes. A few days later he was  out with Manuel on what should have been forty-fathom bottom, but the  whole length of the roding ran out, and still the anchor found nothing,  and Harvey grew mortally afraid, for that his last touch with earth was  lost. \"Whale-hole,\" said Manuel, hauling in. \"That is good joke on  Disko. Come!\" and he rowed to the schooner to find Tom Platt and the  others jeering at the skipper because, for once, he had led them to the  edge of the barren Whale-deep, the blank hole of the Grand Bank. They  made another berth through the fog, and that time the hair of Harvey's  head stood up when he went out in Manuel's dory. A whiteness moved in  the whiteness of the fog with a breath like the breath of the grave,  and there was a roaring, a plunging, and spouting. It was his first  introduction to the dread summer berg of the Banks, and he cowered in  the bottom of the boat"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22257"],[0,"Bulgaria (#13)"],[1,"still stuck to their trenches, and got in another volley.    The artillery work of the Bulgarians was very good indeed; they had an  excellent field-piece, practically the same field-piece as the French  army. Their work was very fine with regard to aim and to the bursting of  shrapnel, and their firing from concealed positions was also good. But I  never saw enterprising work on their part; I never saw them go into the  open, except during a brief time at Chatalja. They seemed to dig  themselves in behind the crest of a hill, where they could fire,  unobserved by the enemy.    Now, with regard to the conduct of the troops. Much has been said about  outrages in this war. I believe that in Macedonia, where irregular  troops were at work, outrages were frequent on both sides; but in my  observation of the main army there was a singular lack of any excess.  The war, as I saw it, was carried out by the Bulgarians under the most  humane possible conditions. At Chundra Bridge I was walking across  country, and I had separated myself from my cart. I arrived at the  bridge at eight o'clock at night, and found a vedette on guard. They  took me for a Turk. I had on English civilian green puttees, and green  was the colour of the Turks. It was a cold night, and I wished to take  refuge at the camp fire, waiting for my cart to come. Though they  thought I was a Turk, they allowed me to stay at their camp fire for two  hours. Then an officer who could speak French appeared, and I was safe;  the men attempted in no way to molest me during those two hours. They  made signs as of cutting throats, and so on, but they were doing it  humorously, and they showed no intention to cut mine. Yet I was there  irregularly, and I could not explain to them how I came to be there.    The extraordinary simplicity of the commissariat helped the Bulgarian  generals a great deal. The men had bread and cheese, sometimes even  bread alone; and that was accounted a satisfactory ration. When meat and  other things could be obtained, they were obtained; but there were long  periods when the Bulgarian soldier had nothing but bread and water. (The  water, unfortunately, he took wherever he could get it, by the side of  his route at any stream he could find. There was no attempt to ensure a  pure water supply for the army.) I do not think that without the  simplicity of commissariat it would have been possible for the Bulgarian  forces to have got as far as they did. There was an entire absence of  tinned foods. If you travelled in the trail of the Bulgarian army, you  found it impossible to imagine that an army had passed that way; because  there was none of the litter which is usually left by an army. It was  not that they cleared away their rubbish with them; it simply did not  exist. Their bread and cheese seemed to be a good fighting diet.    The transport was, naturally, the great problem which faced the  generals. I have already said something about the extreme difficulty of  that transport. I have seen at Seleniki, which is the point at which the  rail-head was, within thirty miles of Constantinople as the crow flies,  ox-wagons, which had come from the Shipka Pass, in the north of  Bulgaria. I asked one driver how long he had been on the road; he told  me three weeks. He was carrying food down to the front.    The way the ox-wagons were used for transport was a marvel of  organisation to me. The transport officer at Mustapha Pasha, with whom I  became very friendly, was lyrical in his praise of the ox-wagon. It was,  he said, the only thing that stuck to him during the war. The railway  got choked, and even the horse failed, but the ox never failed. There  were thousands of ox-wagons crawling across the country. These oxen do  not walk, they crawl, like an insect, with an irresistible crawl. It  reminded me of those armies of soldier ants which move across Africa,  eating everything which they come across, and stopping at nothing. I had  an ox-wagon coming from Mustapha Pasha to Kirk Kilisse, and we went over  the hills and down through the valleys, and stopped for nothing--we  never had to unload once.    And one can sleep in those ox-wagons. There is no jumping and pulling at  the traces, such as you get with a harnessed horse. The ox-wagon moved  slowly; but it always moved. If the ox-transport had not been so  perfectly organised, and if the oxen had not been so patiently  enduring as they proved to be, the Bulgarian army must have perished by  starvation.    [Illustration: THE SHIPKA PASS]    And yet at Mustapha Pasha a Censor would not allow us to send anything  about the ox-wagons. That officer thought the ox-cart was derogatory to  the dignity of the army. If we had been able to say that they had such  things as motor transport, or steam wagons, he would have cheerfully  allowed us to send it.    After Lule Burgas the ox-transport had to do the impossible. It was  impossible for it to maintain the food and the ammunition supply of the  army at the front, which I suppose must have numbered 250,000 to 300,000  men. That army had got right away from its base, with the one line of  railway straddled by the enemy, and with the ox as practically the only  means of transport.    The position of the Bulgarian nation towards its Government on the  outbreak of the war is, I think, extremely interesting as a lesson in  patriotism. Every man fought who could fight. But further, every family  put its surplus of goods into the war-chest. The men marched away to the  front; and the women of the house loaded up the surplus goods which they  had in the house, and brought them for the use of the military  authorities on the ox-wagons, which also went to the military  authorities to be used on requisition.    A Bulgarian law, not one which was passed on the outbreak of the  war--they were far too clever for that--but an Act which was part of the  organic law of the country, allowed the military authorities to  requisition all surplus food and all surplus goods which could be of  value to the army on the outbreak of hostilities. The whole machinery  for that had been provided beforehand. But so great was the voluntary  patriotism of the people that this machinery practically had not to be  used in any compulsory form. Goods were brought in voluntarily, wagons,  cart-horses, and oxen, and all the surplus flour and wheat, and--I have  the official figures from the Bulgarian Treasurer--the goods which were  obtained in this way totalled in value some six million pounds. The  Bulgarian people represent half the population of London. The population  is poor. Their national existence dates back only half a century. But  they are very frugal and saving; that six millions which the Government  signed for represented practically all the savings which the Bulgarian  people had at the outbreak of the war.          CHAPTER VII    A WAR CORRESPONDENT'S TRIALS IN BULGARIA      A sense of grievance was the first fruits of my experience as a war  correspondent in Bulgaria. It was the general policy of the Bulgarian  army and the Bulgarian military authorities to prevent war  correspondents seeing anything of their operations. They wished nothing  to interfere with the secrecy of their plans. There were only three  British journalists who succeeded, in the ultimate result, in getting to  the front and seeing the final battle of the first phase of the war, at  Chatalja. There were over a hundred correspondents who attempted to go.  Perhaps as I was one of three who succeeded, I do not think I,  personally, have any reason to complain. But I found a good deal of  vexation in the Bulgarian policy, which was to prevent any knowledge of  their plans, their dispositions, their strategy, and their tactics,  from getting beyond the small circle of their own General Staff. Even  some of their generals in the field were kept in partial ignorance.  Officers of high standing, unless they were on the General Staff, knew  little of the general plan; they were informed only about the particular  operations in which they were engaged.    This policy of secrecy was, however, a good thing from the point of view  of getting to know the Bulgarian people. If the military authorities had  given me facilities to go with the army and see its operations I should  have become familiar with the Headquarters Staff, perhaps with a few  regimental officers, but not with the great mass of the army nor with  the Bulgarian people generally. But the refusal of facilities to  accompany the army cast upon me the responsibility of trying to get  through somehow to the front, and in the process of getting through I  won to knowledge of the peasant soldiers and their home life.    Ultimately the residuum of my grievance was not with the secretive  methods of the Bulgarians--they were wise and necessary--but with the  wild fictions which some correspondents thought to be the proper  response to that policy of secretiveness.    Returned to Kirk Kilisse from the Bulgarian lines at Chatalja, I amused  myself in an odd hour with burrowing among a great pile of newspapers in  the Censor's office, and reading here and there the war news from  English, French, and Belgian papers.    Dazed, amazed, I recognised that I had seemingly mistaken the duties of  a war correspondent. For some six weeks I had been following an army in  breathless, anxious chase of facts; wheedling Censors to get some few of  those facts into a telegraph office; learning then, perhaps, that the  custom at that particular telegraph office was to forward telegrams to  Sofia, a ten days' journey, by bullock-wagon and railway, to give them  time to mature. Now here, piping hot, were the stories of the war.    There was the vivid story of the battle of Chatalja. This story was  started seven days too soon; had the positions and the armies all wrong;  the result all wrong; and the picturesque details were in harmony. But  for the purposes of "]]]
