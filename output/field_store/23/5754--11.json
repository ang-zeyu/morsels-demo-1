But, as has been  stated, the front has suffered much from restoration and later  additions, and must not be too severely judged. When it was restored by  Mr Street, pinnacles, which were late additions, were removed, and the  present ones, more in keeping with the rest of the front, were put in  their place.    #The South Side Of The Nave# resembles the north in most respects, but  the buttresses and pinnacles of the aisles are altogether different. The  buttresses rise some way above the battlements of the aisles. They are  plain to the level of these battlements, and above them are ornamented  with niches containing figures, with blind arches above the niches. They  are cut short by three gables, on the top of which are set lofty  pinnacles. The niches vary in detail, some of them having more elaborate  canopies than others. On these buttresses and on the wall of the nave  are the marks of flying buttresses which have been removed, as has been  stated in the account of the north side of the nave.    Three gargoyles spring from each buttress at the level of the battlement  of the aisle. This side of the nave is only less beautiful than the  other. The pinnacles, if they add to the richness of its decoration,  break the simplicity of outline so admirable in the northern exterior of  the nave. The stonework of the pinnacles and buttresses is much decayed,  and constantly requires renewal.    #The Central Tower# rises a single storey above the ridge of the roof  and is open inside to the top. But for small gables on the buttresses,  it is quite plain up to the level of the roof ridge. Above this it  contains two long and narrow Perpendicular windows on each side, of  three lights each, with a transom. These windows are ornamented with  ogee gables, and between them are three niches, one above the other,  with canopies. The external buttresses are split up with vertical  mouldings and ornamented with niches and panelling. The tower is crowned  with a battlement. Horizontal string courses with gargoyles divide the  buttresses at intervals. There are no pinnacles on these buttresses, and  they appear never to have been finished. It is possible that it was  intended to set another storey on the top of the present one, but this  is merely conjecture.    This tower, or rather its Perpendicular casing, for it was originally an  Early English tower, is, with the western the latest part of the  minster, but it is by no means the least beautiful. The English  architects of the sixteenth century, if they were inferior to earlier  builders in invention and vigour, were at any rate supreme in the  management of towers. Their wonderful sense of proportion, their  habitual use of vertical lines, and the character of their windows  helped them to build what are perhaps the finest towers in Europe, and  the central tower of York Minster is one of the finest of all. Even the  absence of pinnacles, if it is an accident, seems to be a lucky  accident, and gives this tower an unrivalled dignity and air of  restraint suitable to the character of the whole cathedral. For whatever  may be said against certain parts of the exterior, as a whole it is one  of the most magnificent in the world. It shows best from certain points  of view--from the north, for instance, or from the network of narrow  streets to the south. It may be contended that the central tower is not  quite lofty enough compared with the two western towers for perfect  symmetry of outline; that, seen from certain aspects, it is rather  square and box-like in appearance; that from no point of view are the  western towers satisfactory. But the minster produces its great effect  by its enormous bulk and dignity, its vast length, the variety and yet  unity of its outlines, the severity and restraint of its form.    [Illustration: Seal of St Mary's Abbey.]          CHAPTER IV    THE INTERIOR      #The Nave.#--The most casual observer will have noticed that churches of  the Gothic style are divided vertically into bays, and that in  cathedrals and large churches these bays are usually further divided  horizontally into three compartments, the lowest consisting of the main  arch and piers, the highest of a window or windows, known as the  clerestory, and the middle, called the triforium, consisting usually of  an arcade, sometimes blind, sometimes pierced, and occasionally even  glazed. This triforium fills up the space between the top of the main  arches and the bottom of the clerestory window which is covered on the  outside by the roof of the aisle. As a distinct division or  architectural feature, the triforium arcade is not a necessary part of  the structure. In smaller churches it seldom exists. But in most  cathedrals, as at York, a passage runs behind it, and is generally lit  by the holes in the arcading. As has been stated, however, the arcading  is often blank, and in such cases there might be nothing but a bare  space of wall in its place, for all the practical purpose it serves.  Since, therefore, its form is not dictated by considerations of utility,  there is far more variety in its treatment than in that of the other two  divisions, the main lines of which are formed by structural necessities;  and yet the success or failure of an interior often depend upon the  arrangement and proportion of the triforium; and the arrangement of the  triforium, its emphasis or subordination, was one of the chief problems  with which the builders of Gothic churches had to deal. Since such a  church is generally divided into three storeys, the main lines of the  interior would naturally be expected to be horizontal, and in many  interiors of the Norman and Early English periods they are so, as, for  instance, in the nave of Wells Cathedral. But the stone vault, which  played so important a part in the development of Gothic style naturally  emphasised, with its ribs converging at regular intervals, the vertical  division into bays as opposed to the horizontal division into storeys.  The supports of the outside wall were gradually concentrated by the use  of pinnacles and flying buttresses placed between the windows; the  windows themselves grew in size with the introduction and development of  tracery and the increasing taste for the decoration of stained glass;  until the final organism of Gothic architecture was attained, and the  typical Gothic Church, from being a building of three storeys, pierced  by windows, became a structure made up of vertical supports, with the  intervening spaces filled with glass. When this phase of development was  reached, the building became as organic in all its parts as the human  body. Structure was ornament, and ornament structure, and the two were  fused as they have never been in any other style of architecture.  Decoration and variety of outline were supplied by the mere disposition  of the supporting masses, the arrangement of structural lines; to the  exterior, by the flying buttresses, the pinnacles, and the window  tracery; to the interior, by the banded shafts, the capitals, the  groined ribs of the vaults, and the openings of the triforium. Outside  the church became a framework of glorified stone scaffolding; inside, an  avenue of columns rising from the ground to the vaults, with  intermediate spaces of tracery and coloured glass. But before this stage  was reached there were many compromises and passing phases, and every  considerable church in England, until the end of the fourteenth century,  may be classified and criticised, not only for its beauty, but as a link  in the development of Gothic architecture. The builders were grappling  with both tendencies, the vertical and the horizontal; they were not  consciously working on a theory of complete vertical development; they  made progress by structural experiment, and a sensitive eye for  possibilities of beauty; and in the meantime their problem, both  structural and artistic, was to make a happy compromise between vertical  and horizontal lines. It was a problem which probably presented itself  to them in the question how they were to treat the different storeys of  the building. Structural difficulties would be continually at war with  their aesthetic ambitions, and the heavy stone vault made structural  difficulties a serious matter. There was a growing desire for space, for  height and width, for light and colour. With every increase of height  and width the burden of the vault became more oppressive; with every  enlargement of windows its supports were weakened. As a rule, the  English builders were far less ambitious in their treatment of these  problems than the French. Amiens Cathedral, begun at the beginning of  the thirteenth century, is structurally as daring as can be. Salisbury,  but for its spire, a later addition, is comparatively modest and timid.  The French builders quickly reached the limits of structural  possibilities, and their type became fixed. The English, with less  economy of support, and a lower organisation of structure, were better  able to play with their forms. So their churches present a series of  continual and often inconsequent experiments in the treatment and  proportion of every storey, particularly of the triforium, and in  compromise between vertical and horizontal tendencies. Thus at Beverley,  Salisbury, and particularly in the nave of Wells, the horizontal  tendency is predominant, and the triforium is both important and  continuous, without regard for the vertical division of the bays. In the  Early English transept of the minster itself the triforium is the most  prominent feature of the design. These are all examples of Early English  work, but in the nave of Lichfield, which is Decorated, the triforium is  still far more prominent than the clerestory. In the same way a various  and experimental use may be noticed of the shafts dropping from the  point at which the ribs converge.

This rivalry between fishing guides is very common and  sometimes, I am sorry to say, it is less good-natured than here.\"    \"It seems very silly,\" Theo remarked.    \"It is the same old question of protecting the source of one's  income. Governments as well as individuals have to confront the  problem. You remember how the Chinese tried to shut every one out from  knowing how they made their porcelain?\"    \"Yes, indeed. And you never have told me yet how the European nations  found out the secret.\"    \"Until now we had not come to that story,\" replied Mr. Croyden. \"But  to-day it chances that that is the very tale I have in mind to tell  you.\"    Theo rubbed his hands, and with a contented smile settled back against  the pillows prepared to listen.    \"As I told you,\" began Mr. Croyden, \"about 1518 Portuguese traders  brought Chinese porcelains into Europe; and following their lead the  Dutch imported the same goods in even greater quantities. Everywhere  people marveled at the beauty of these wares just as you would have  done if up to that time you had never seen anything but crude clay  dishes. The whiteness of the porcelain seemed a miracle, and on every  hand people were eager to make such china themselves. Especially  eager were the rulers of the different European countries, who were  clever enough to see that such production would greatly increase their  national fame and prosperity. Now there chanced to be a Prussian by  the name of Boettger, an alchemist, who because of the wars had fled  for safety to Meissen. He was a man well-versed in the composition of  minerals and chemicals, and in consequence Augustus II, who was at  that time Elector of Saxony, sent for him, and asked him to join his  other skilled chemists, who for a long time had been busy  experimenting with clays in the hope of discovering how the Chinese  made their porcelain. This was no unusual thing, for chemists of most  of the other countries were working feverishly in their laboratories  at the same enigma.\"    \"Doesn't it seem funny?\"    \"As you look back on it, yes,\" answered Mr. Croyden. \"It is almost  tragic when you consider the time, patience, and money that went into  these experiments--most of them failures, at that.\"    \"Did Boettger fail too?\"    \"I am coming to that,\" replied the story-teller. \"While mixing  various combinations of clays Boettger and his associates came upon a  hard pottery clay which was neither white nor translucent like the  Chinese, but which nevertheless was nearer that ware than anything  they had previously succeeded in making. In 1708 some dishes were  made from this material, but they were not very satisfactory. After  that Boettger tried again. You see he was not a person who was easily  discouraged. The next time he got a white ware, but it was not thin;  instead it was thick and ugly. He now had the hardness and the  whiteness, but not the semi-transparency and fine texture of the  Chinese porcelain; and although he tried repeatedly he was unable to  fathom the secret of these qualities.\"    Theo waited while Mr. Croyden stopped to rest.    \"The one thing Boettger needed he did not know where to find and that  was----\"    \"Kaolin!\" cried Theo.    \"Exactly,\" assented Mr. Croyden. \"What a pity it is that you could not  have shouted the magic word in his ear as lustily as you have in  mine. It would have saved poor Boettger no end of worry and hard  work. However, even if he had heard the name it probably would have  conveyed nothing to him, for no one in Europe had ever heard of  kaolin.\"    \"I suppose it is a Chinese word.\"    \"Yes. The name was taken from the Chinese mountain of Kailing, where  the first kaolin, or decomposed feldspar, was found.\"    \"Now please go on with the story,\" urged Theo.    \"Well, one day it happened that a rich Saxon iron-master was taking a  ride, and as he went along his horse's foot stuck in the soft clay at  the roadside. As the rider glanced down to see what the trouble was he  was amazed to discover that the clay was white, and being a business  man the thought instantly came into his mind that here was a way to  make some money. At that time all the nobles of the Court wore  powdered wigs, and the quick-witted iron-master said to himself: 'I  will get some of this clay, sift it very fine, do it up in packages,  and sell it for powdering the hair; thus I will make my fortune.'  Accordingly his servants dug some of the clay, and after it had been  carefully sifted through cloth, he put it upon the market as a new  wig-powder. Now in those days the more well-to-do persons had several  wigs or at least two, in order that while the one was being worn the  other might be sent away to the hair-dresser's to be curled and  powdered. Therefore, in the course of time it chanced that Boettger's  servant, like others, sent away his master's wig to have it freshened  up. When it came back it was beautifully dressed and was powdered with  some of the iron-master's new powder. It looked very fine indeed, and  Boettger had no fault to find with it until he took it up to put it on  his head; then he observed that it was strangely heavy. 'What's this!'  he cried to his servant. 'What have you been doing to my wig, rascal?'  Terror-stricken the servant protested that he had done nothing.  Boettger carried the wig into his laboratory that he might examine it  more carefully, and he soon came to the conclusion that the weight of  the article lay in the powder. He therefore shook it off and set to  work to analyze it. What was his surprise to find the powder a white  mineral substance of which he knew nothing. You may be sure he was not  long in tracking down the hair-dresser and learning from him where he  got his new powder. Next he went to the Saxon iron-master and bought  from him a great quantity of the stuff, after which the chemist shut  himself up in his laboratory to try out the new material. Think how  excited he must have been! And think how much more excited he was when  he found that this mysterious white clay was the substance for which  he had so long been searching!\"    [Illustration: \"HIS SERVANTS DUG SOME OF THE CLAY\"]    \"Kaolin?\" gasped Theo.    \"Kaolin!\"    The room was very still; then Theo stammered hurriedly:    \"And what happened next?\"    \"Well, you can imagine the joy the discovery brought; but it was a  carefully stifled joy, for with all his delight Boettger was far too  discreet to allow his wonderful discovery to travel outside the  confines of his laboratory. When the Elector Augustus was told the  news at his Dresden palace near by he was wild with delight, and  immediately began building a great porcelain factory at Meissen. By  1715 there was enough of the new ware ready to be put on sale at  Leipsic; and thus our beautiful porcelain, dubbed Dresden ware in  honor of the Saxon capitol, came into being. The first that was made  was plain white with a decoration of vines and leaves in low  relief. Later some of the dishes were made with a perforated border in  imitation of the Chinese and Japanese 'grains-of-rice' pattern.  Afterward the potters attempted the use of blue in a vain attempt to  reproduce Nankin Blue ware.\"    \"I guess the other countries were pretty sore when they found Saxony  had learned how to make porcelain,\" put in Theo.    \"They were greatly agitated, my son,\" laughed Mr. Croyden. \"They  begged, bribed, and schemed to find out what the new clay was; but all  to no purpose. The works at Meissen were guarded day and night, and  every person employed in the factory was compelled to swear to keep  the great secret. Men were cautioned they would be shot should they  divulge the process. _Be secret to Death_ was the motto of the  manufactory, and that meant not only that they never should tell  anybody all their life-long; but if threatened with harm they should  prefer death to betraying their trust. They must even endure torture  itself rather than open their mouths. Some histories go so far as to  say that in order to secure absolute secrecy only the deaf and dumb  were allowed to transport the clay.\"    \"I don't see but they were just as selfish as the Chinese.\"    \"Quite as selfish, alas!\"    \"What became of Boettger?\"    \"I am sorry to say he never did much of anything else that was  praiseworthy. Sometimes too much success spoils people. But he had  done his work, and a great work, too, in launching this vast  industry. When he died he left behind him a group of thriving  factories. After his death the artists at the Meissen works gradually  abandoned copying Chinese and Japanese designs and began inventing  decorations of their own, using both gold and an increasing variety of  colors. They also began to secure the aid of sculptors, among them the  famed sculptor Kaendler who modeled statuettes of saints, animals,  birds, and persons in much the way the Dutch had done. These figures  or groups, however, were more finely executed, and were beautifully  colored. As the makers of them became more expert larger figures were  attempted until some of them were life-sized.\"    \"Goodness!\"    \"It does seem absurd, doesn't it?\" agreed Mr. Croyden. \"It is a  childish impulse to want to make everything as big as one can make it.  Nevertheless in a land where much of the population was Catholic you  can readily understand how these gigantic figures readily found places  upon altars in the churches of Europe. All might have gone well with  this great porcelain plant had not the Seven Years' War arisen just at  this time, lasting from 1756 to 1763. During this period Frederick the  Great, the grandfather of the present Emperor of Germany, went into  Saxony, stopped the royal factories at Meissen, and took the workmen  as captives to Berlin.\"    \"But----\" began Theo indignantly.    \"Such things are the issues of war,\" said Mr. Croyden gravely. \"We  cannot uphold them, nor cease to "]]]
