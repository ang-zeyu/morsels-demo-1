[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2160"],[0,"The Expedition of Humphry Clinker (#13)"],[1,"at all the taverns in Bath and Bristol,  till his guests are gorged with good chear: he has bought a dozen suits  of fine clothes, by the advice of the Master of the Ceremonies, under  whose tuition he has entered himself. He has lost hundreds at billiards  to sharpers, and taken one of the nymphs of Avon-street into keeping;  but, finding all these channels insufficient to drain him of his current  cash, his counsellor has engaged him to give a general tea-drinking  to-morrow at Wiltshire's room. In order to give it the more eclat, every  table is to be furnished with sweet-meats and nosegays; which, however,  are not to be touched till notice is given by the ringing of a bell, and  then the ladies may help themselves without restriction. This will be no  bad way of trying the company's breeding.'    'I will abide by that experiment (cried my uncle) and if I could find  a place to stand secure, without the vortex of the tumult, which I know  will ensue, I would certainly go thither and enjoy the scene.' Quin  proposed that we should take our station in the music-gallery, and  we took his advice. Holder had got thither before us, with his horns  perdue, but we were admitted. The tea-drinking passed as usual, and the  company having risen from the tables, were sauntering in groupes, in  expectation of the signal for attack, when the bell beginning to  ring, they flew with eagerness to the dessert, and the whole place was  instantly in commotion. There was nothing but justling, scrambling,  pulling, snatching, struggling, scolding, and screaming. The nosegays  were torn from one another's hands and bosoms; the glasses and china  went to wreck; the tables and floors were strewed with comfits. Some  cried; some swore; and the tropes and figures of Billingsgate were used  without reserve in all their native zest and flavour; nor were those  flowers of rhetoric unattended with significant gesticulation. Some  snapped their fingers; some forked them out; some clapped their hands,  and some their back-sides; at length, they fairly proceeded to pulling  caps, and every thing seemed to presage a general battle; when Holder  ordered his horns to sound a charge, with a view to animate the  combatants, and inflame the contest; but this manoeuvre produced an  effect quite contrary to what he expected. It was a note of reproach  that roused them to an immediate sense of their disgraceful situation.  They were ashamed of their absurd deportment, and suddenly desisted.  They gathered up their caps, ruffles, and handkerchiefs; and great part  of them retired in silent mortification.    Quin laughed at this adventure; but my uncle's delicacy was hurt. He  hung his head in manifest chagrin, and seemed to repine at the triumph  of his judgment--Indeed, his victory was more complete than he imagined;  for, as we afterwards learned, the two amazons who singularized  themselves most in the action, did not come from the purlieus of  Puddle-dock, but from the courtly neighbourhood of St James's palace.  One was a baroness, and the other, a wealthy knight's dowager--My uncle  spoke not a word, till we had made our retreat good to the coffee-house;  where, taking off his hat and wiping his forehead, 'I bless God (said  he) that Mrs Tabitha Bramble did not take the field today!' 'I would pit  her for a cool hundred (cried Quin) against the best shake-bag of the  whole main.' The truth is, nothing could have kept her at home but the  accident of her having taken physic before she knew the nature of the  entertainment. She has been for some days furbishing up an old suit of  black velvet, to make her appearance as Sir Ulic's partner at the next  ball.    I have much to say of this amiable kinswoman; but she has not been  properly introduced to your acquaintance. She is remarkably civil to  Mr Quin; of whose sarcastic humour she seems to stand in awe; but her  caution is no match for her impertinence. 'Mr Gwynn (said she the other  day) I was once vastly entertained with your playing the Ghost of Gimlet  at Drury-lane, when you rose up through the stage, with a white face and  red eyes, and spoke of quails upon the frightful porcofine--Do, pray,  spout a little the Ghost of Gimlet.' 'Madam (said Quin, with a glance of  ineffable disdain) the Ghost of Gimlet is laid, never to rise again'--  Insensible of this check, she proceeded: 'Well, to be sure, you looked  and talked so like a real ghost; and then the cock crowed so natural.  I wonder how you could teach him to crow so exact, in the very nick of  time; but, I suppose, he's game--An't he game, Mr Gwynn?' 'Dunghill,  madam.'--'Well, dunghill, or not dunghill, he has got such a clear  counter-tenor, that I wish I had such another at Brambleton-hall, to  wake the maids of a morning. Do you know where I could find one of his  brood?' 'Probably in the work-house at St Giles's parish, madam; but I  protest I know not his particular mew!' My uncle, frying with vexation,  cried, 'Good God, sister, how you talk! I have told you twenty times,  that this gentleman's name is not Gwynn.'--'Hoity toity, brother mine  (she replied) no offence, I hope--Gwynn is an honorable name, of true  old British extraction--I thought the gentleman had been come of Mrs  Helen Gwynn, who was of his own profession; and if so be that were the  case, he might be of king Charles's breed, and have royal blood in his  veins.'--'No, madam (answered Quin, with great solemnity) my mother was  not a whore of such distinction--True it is, I am sometimes tempted  to believe myself of royal descent; for my inclinations are often  arbitrary--If I was an absolute prince, at this instant, I believe I  should send for the head of your cook in a charger--She has committed  felony, on the person of that John Dory, which is mangled in a cruel  manner, and even presented without sauce--O tempora! O mores!'    This good-humoured sally turned the conversation into a less  disagreeable channel--But, lest you should think my scribble as tedious  as Mrs Tabby's clack, I shall not add another word, but that I am as  usual    Yours, J. MELFORD BATH, April 30.          To Dr LEWIS.    DEAR LEWIS,    I received your bill upon Wiltshire, which was punctually honoured; but  as I don't choose to keep so much cash by me, in a common lodging house,  I have deposited 250l. in the bank of Bath, and shall take their bills  for it in London, when I leave this place, where the season draws to an  end--You must know, that now being a-foot, I am resolved to give Liddy a  glimpse of London. She is one of the best hearted creatures I ever knew,  and gains upon my affection every day--As for Tabby, I have dropt such  hints to the Irish baronet, concerning her fortune, as, I make no doubt,  will cool the ardour of his addresses. Then her pride will take the  alarm; and the rancour of stale maidenhood being chafed, we shall hear  nothing but slander and abuse of Sir Ulic Mackilligut--This rupture,  I foresee, will facilitate our departure from Bath; where, at present,  Tabby seems to enjoy herself with peculiar satisfaction. For my part, I  detest it so much, that I should not have been able to stay so long in  the place if I had not discovered some old friends; whose conversation  alleviates my disgust--Going to the coffeehouse one forenoon, I  could not help contemplating the company, with equal surprize and  compassion--We consisted of thirteen individuals; seven lamed by the  gout, rheumatism, or palsy; three maimed by accident; and the rest  either deaf or blind. One hobbled, another hopped, a third dragged his  legs after him like a wounded snake, a fourth straddled betwixt a pair  of long crutches, like the mummy of a felon hanging in chains; a fifth  was bent into a horizontal position, like a mounted telescope, shoved in  by a couple of chairmen; and a sixth was the bust of a man, set upright  in a wheel machine, which the waiter moved from place to place.    Being struck with some of their faces, I consulted the  subscription-book; and, perceiving the names of several old friends,  began to consider the groupe with more attention. At length I discovered  rear-admiral Balderick, the companion of my youth, whom I had not seen  since he was appointed lieutenant of the Severn. He was metamorphosed  into an old man, with a wooden leg and a weatherbeaten face, which  appeared the more ancient from his grey locks, that were truly  venerable--Sitting down at the table, where he was reading a news-paper,  I gazed at him for some minutes, with a mixture of pleasure and regret,  which made my heart gush with tenderness; then, taking him by the hand,  'Ah, Sam (said I) forty years ago I little thought'--I was too much  moved to proceed. 'An old friend, sure enough! (cried he, squeezing my  hand, and surveying me eagerly through his glasses) I know the looming  of the vessel, though she has been hard strained since we parted; but I  can't heave up the name'--The moment I told him who I was, he exclaimed,  'Ha! Matt, my old fellow cruizer, still afloat!' And, starting up,  hugged me in his arms. His transport, however, boded me no good; for, in  saluting me, he thrust the spring of his spectacles into my eye, and,  at the same time, set his wooden stump upon my gouty toe; an attack that  made me shed tears in sad earnest--After the hurry of our recognition  was over, he pointed out two of our common friends in the room: the bust  was what remained of colonel Cockril, who had lost the use of his  limbs in making an American campaign; and the telescope proved to be  my college chum, sir Reginald Bently; who, with his new title, and  unexpected inheritance, commenced fox-hunter, without having served  his apprenticeship to the mystery; and, in consequence of following the  hounds through a river, was seized with an inflammation of his bowels,  which has contracted him into his present attitude.    Our former correspondence was forthwith renewed, with the most"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21614"],[0,"For the Temple: A Tale of the Fall of Jerusalem (#13)"],[1,"as slaves--but the young ones--\" and he stopped.    \"I have thought it over, my son, and even if your mother remains  here with me, I will assuredly send off Mary, and the young  maidens, to the mountain. Make your mind easy, on that score. We  old people have taken root on the land which was our fathers'. I  shall not leave, whatever may befall--and it may be that your  mother will tarry here, with me--but the young women shall  assuredly be sent away, until the danger is over.    \"Not that I think the peril is as great as it seems, to you. Our  people have ever shown themselves courageous, in great danger. They  know the fate that awaits them, after provoking the anger of Rome.  They know they are fighting for faith, for country, and their  families, and will fight desperately. They greatly outnumber the  Romans--at least, the army by which we shall first be attacked--and  maybe, if we can resist that, we may make terms with Rome for,  assuredly, in the long run she must overpower us.\"    \"I should think with you, father,\" John said, shaking his head, \"if  I saw anything like union among the people; but I lose all heart,  when I see how divided they are, how blind to the storm that is  coming against us, how careless as to anything but the trouble of  the day, how intent upon the work of their farms and businesses,  how disinclined to submit to discipline, and to prepare themselves  for the day of battle.\"    \"You are young, my son, and full of enthusiasm; but it is hard to  stir men, whose lives have traveled in one groove, from their  ordinary course. In all our history, although we have been ready to  assemble and meet the foe, we have ever been ready to lay by the  sword, when the danger is past, and to return to our homes and  families. We have been a nation of fighting men, but never a nation  with an army.\"    \"Yes, father, because we trusted in God to give us victory, on the  day of battle. He was our army. When He fought with us, we  conquered; when He abstained, we were beaten. He suffered us to  fall into the hands of the Romans and, instead of repenting of our  sins, we have sinned more and more.    \"The news from Jerusalem is worse and worse. There is civil war in  its streets. Robbers are its masters. The worst of the people sit  in high places.\"    \"That is so, my son. God's anger still burns fiercely, and the  people perish; yet it may be that He will be merciful, in the end.\"    \"I hope so, father, for assuredly our hope is only in Him.\"    Early in the spring, Vespasian was joined by King Agrippa, with all  his forces; and they advanced to Ptolemais and, here, Titus joined  his father, having brought his troops from Alexandria by sea. The  force of Vespasian now consisted of the Fifth, Tenth, and Fifteenth  Legions. Besides these he had twenty-three cohorts; ten of which  numbered a thousand footmen, the rest, each, six hundred footmen  and a hundred and fifty horse. The allied force, contributed by  Agrippa and others, consisted of two thousand archers, and a  thousand horse; while Malchus, King of Arabia, sent a thousand  horse, and five thousand archers. The total force amounted to sixty  thousand regular troops, besides great numbers of camp followers--who  were all trained to military service, and could fight, in case of need.    Vespasian had encountered no resistance, on his march down to  Ptolemais. The inhabitants of the country through which he passed  forsook the villages and farms; and retired, according to the  orders they had received, to the fortified towns. There was no army  to meet the Romans in the field. The efforts at organization which  Josephus had made bore no fruit, whatever. No sooner had the  invader entered the country, than it lay at his mercy; save only  the walled cities into which the people had crowded.    In the range of mountains stretching across Upper Galilee were  three places of great strength: Gabara, Gischala, and Jotapata. The  last named had been very strongly fortified, by Josephus himself;  and here he intended to take up his own position.    \"It is a pitiful sight, truly,\" Joab remarked to John, as they saw  the long line of fugitives--men, women, and children--with such  belongings as they could carry on their own backs, and those of  their beasts of burden. \"It is a pitiful sight, is it not?\"    \"It is a pitiful sight, Joab, and one that fills me with  foreboding, as well as with pity. What agonies may not these poor  people be doomed to suffer, when the Romans lay siege to Jotapata?\"    \"They can never take it,\" Joab said, scornfully.    \"I wish I could think so, Joab. When did the Romans ever lay siege  to a place, and fail to capture it? Once, twice, three times they  may fail but, in the end, they assuredly will take it.\"    \"Look at its position. See how wild is the country through which  they will have to march.\"    \"They have made roads over all the world, Joab. They will make very  short work of the difficulties here. It may take the Romans weeks,  or months, to besiege each of these strong places; but they will  assuredly carry them, in the end--and then, better a thousand times  that the men had, in the first place, slain the women, and rushed  to die on the Roman swords.\"    \"It seems to me, John,\" Joab said stiffly, \"that you are over bold,  in thus criticising the plans of our general.\"    \"It may be so,\" John said, recklessly, \"but methinks, when we are  all risking our lives, each man may have a right to his opinions. I  am ready, like the rest, to die when the time comes; but that does  not prevent me having my opinions. Besides, it seems to me that  there is no heresy in questioning the plans of our general. I love  Josephus, and would willingly give my life for him. He has shown  himself a wise ruler, firm to carry out what is right, and to  suppress all evildoers but, after all, he has not served in war. He  is full of resources, and will, I doubt not, devise every means to  check the Romans but, even so, he may not be able to cope, in war,  with such generals as theirs, who have won their experience all  over the world. Nor may the general's plan of defense, which he has  adopted, be the best suited for the occasion.    \"Would you have us fight the Romans in the open?\" Joab said,  scornfully. \"What has been done in the south? See how our people  marched out from Jerusalem--under John the Essene, Niger of Peraea,  and Silas the Babylonian--to attack Ascalon, held by but one cohort  of Roman foot, and one troop of horse. What happened? Antoninus,  the Roman commander, charged the army without fear, rode through  and through them, broke them up into fragments, and slew till night  time--when ten thousand men, with John and Silas, lay dead.    \"Not satisfied with this defeat, in a short time Niger advanced  again against Ascalon; when Antoninus sallied out again, and slew  eight thousand of them. Thus, eighteen thousand men were killed, by  one weak cohort of foot and a troop of horse; and yet you say we  ought not to hide behind our walls, but to meet them in the open!\"    \"I would not meet them in the open, where the Roman cavalry could  charge--at any rate, not until our people have learned discipline.  I would harass them, and attack them in defiles, as Cestius was  attacked; harassing them night and day, giving them no peace or  rest, never allowing them to meet us in the plains, but moving  rapidly hither and thither among the mountains--leaving the women  in the cities, which should offer no resistance, so that the Romans  would have no point to strike at--until at length, when we have  gained confidence and discipline and order, we should be able to  take bolder measures, gradually, and fight them hand to hand.\"    \"Maybe you are right, lad,\" Joab said, thoughtfully. \"I like not  being cooped up in a stronghold, myself; and methinks that a  mountain warfare, such as you speak of, would suit the genius of  the people. We are light limbed and active--inured to fatigue, for  we are a nation of cultivators--brave, assuredly, and ready to give  our lives.    \"They say that, in the fight near Ascalon, not a Jew fled. Fight  they could not, they were powerless against the rush of the heavy  Roman horse; but they died as they stood, destroyed but not  defeated. Gabara and Gischala and Jotapata may fall but, lad, it  will be only after a defense so desperate that the haughty Romans  may well hesitate; for if such be the resistance of these little  mountain towns, what will not be the task of conquering Jerusalem,  garrisoned by the whole nation?\"    \"That is true,\" John said, \"and if our deaths here be for the  safety of Jerusalem, we shall not have died in vain. But I doubt  whether such men as those who have power in Jerusalem will agree to  any terms, however favorable, that may be offered.    \"It may be that it is God's will that it should be so. Two days  ago, as I journeyed hither, after going down to Sepphoris with a  message from the general to some of the principal inhabitants  there, I met an old man, traveling with his wife and family. I  asked him whether he was on his way hither, but he said 'No,' he  was going across Jordan, and through Manasseh, and over Mount  Hermon into Trachonitis. He said that he was a follower of that  Christ who was put to death, in Jerusalem, some thirty-five years  since, and whom many people still believe was the Messiah. He says  that he foretold the destruction of Jerusalem, by the Romans; and  warned his followers not to stay in the walled cities, but to fly  to the deserts when the time came.\"    \"The Messiah was to save Israel,\" Joab said, scornfully. \"Christ  could not save even himself.\"    \"I know not,\" John said, simply. \"I have heard of him from others;  and my father heard him preach, several times, near the lake. He  says that he was a man of wondrous power, and that he preached a  new doctrine. He says that he did not talk about himself, or claim  to be the Messiah;"]]]
