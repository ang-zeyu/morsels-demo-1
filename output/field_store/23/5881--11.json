Also he killed his enemy and stole some  horses. It came out just as the ghost said. That is why people believe  what ghosts say.          THE WAKANDA, OR WATER GOD    _Yankton_      A man and his wife had only one child, they say, whom they loved very  much. He used to go playing every day, they say; and one day he fell  into the water. His father and mother and all his relations wailed  regularly. His father was very sad, they say. He would not sleep  within the lodge; he lay out of doors, without any pillow at all. When  he lay on the ground with his cheek on the palm of his hand, he heard  his child crying. He heard him crying down under the ground, they say.  Having assembled all his relations, he spoke of digging into the  ground. The relations collected horses to be given as pay; they  collected goods and horses. Then came two old men who said they were  sacred. They spoke of seeking for the child. An old man went to tell  the father. He brought the two sacred men to the lodge. The father  filled a pipe with tobacco. He gave it to the sacred men, and said,  \"If you bring my child back, I will give all this to you.\"    So they painted themselves; one made his body very black, the other  made his body very yellow. Both went into the deep water. So they  arrived there, they say. They talked to the wakanda. The child was not  dead; he was sitting up, alive.    The men said, \"The father demands his child. We have him; we will go  homeward,\" they said.    \"You have him; but if you take him homeward with you, he shall die.  Had you taken him before he ate anything, he might have lived. Begone  ye, and tell those words to his father.\"    The two men went. They arrived at the lodge, they say.    \"We have seen your child; the wakanda's wife has him. We saw him  alive, but he has eaten of the food of the wakandas. Therefore the  wakanda says that if we bring the child back with us out of the water,  he shall die.\"    Still, the father wished to see him.    \"If the wakanda's wife gives you back your child, she desires a very  white dog as pay.\"    \"I promise to give her the white dog,\" said the father.    Again the two men painted themselves; the one made himself very black,  the other made himself very yellow. Again they went beneath the water.  They arrived at the place again.    \"The father said we were to take the child back at any cost; he spoke  of seeing his child.\"    So the wakanda gave the child back to them; homeward they went with  him. When they reached the surface of the water with him, the child  died. They gave him back to his father. Then all the people wailed  when they saw the child, their relation.    They plunged the white-haired dog into the water. When they had buried  the child they gave pay to the two men.    After a while, the parents lost another child, a girl, in the same  way, they say. But she did not eat any of the wakanda's food,  therefore they took her home alive. But it was another wakanda who  took her, and he promised to give her back if they would give him four  white-haired dogs.          THE SPIRIT LAND    _Arapahoe_      The spirit world is toward the Darkening Land, higher up, and  separated from the world of living by a great lake. Now when the  spirits came back to this world [in the ghost-dance excitement] Crow  was their leader. That is because Crow is black; his color is the same  as that of the Darkening Land. Crow was followed by all the Indians.  But when they reached the edge of the shadow land, below them was a  great sea.    Far away, toward the Sunrise Land were their people in the world of  living. So Crow took a pebble in his beak. He dropped it into the  water, and it became a mountain, towering up to the shadow land. So  the Indians came down the mountain side to the edge of the water.    Then Crow took some dust in his bill. He flew out and dropped it into  the water, and it became solid land. It stretched between the spirit  land and the world of living.    Then Crow flew out again, with blades of grass in his beak. He  dropped these upon the new made land. At once the earth was covered  with green grass.    Again Crow flew out with twigs in his beak, and he dropped these upon  the new earth. At once it was covered with a forest of trees.    Again he flew back to the base of the mountain. Then he called all the  spirit Indians together. Now he is coming to help the living Indians.  He has already passed the sea. He is now on the western edge of the  world of living.          WAZIYA, THE WEATHER SPIRIT    _Teton_      The giant called Waziya knows when there is to be a change of weather.  He is a giant. When he travels, his footprints are large enough for  several Indians to stand in abreast. His strides are very far apart;  at one step he can go over a hill.    When it is cold, people say, \"Waziya has returned.\" They used to pray  to him, but when they found he paid no attention to him, they ceased  to do it.    When warm weather is coming, Waziya wraps himself in a thick robe. But  when cold weather is coming, he wears nothing at all. Waziya, the  giant god of the north, and Itokaga, the god of the south, are ever  battling. Each in turn wins the victory.          KANSAS BLIZZARDS    _Kansa_      When there is a blizzard, the other Kansa beg the members of the  Tcihaci gens to interpose, as they are the Wind People.    They say, \"Oh, grandfather, I wish good weather. Please have one of  your children decorated.\"    Then the youngest son of one of the Wind People, but one half grown,  is selected. He is painted all over with red paint. Then he goes out  into the storm and rolls over and over the snow, reddening it for some  distance. This stops the storm.          [Notes: \"KILLED TWO ARIKARA CHIEFS\"    (Indian drawing)    _The rank of the chiefs is shown by the white weasel skins attacked to  their costumes. The arrow in the thigh of the horseman indicates that  he was wounded._]    [Illustration: _Enlarged from a sketch in Report of the Bureau of  Ethnology_]      [Notes: MANY TONGUES, OR LOUD TALKER    _Oddly enough, the name is given as that of the vanquished, not of the  victor, although the balloon of sound would seemingly indicate  otherwise. The pipe between the two indicates that the victor is  entitled to celebrate his victory._]    [Illustration: _Enlarged from a sketch in Report of the Bureau of  Ethnology_]          IKTO AND THE SNOWSTORM    _Teton_      Ikto was the first person in this world. He is more cunning than human  beings. He it was who named all the animals and people. But sometimes  Ikto was tricked by the beings he had created.    One day Ikto was hungry; just then he caught a rabbit. He was about to  roast him.    Suddenly Rabbit said, \"Oh, Ikto, I will teach you a magic art.\"    Ikto said, \"I have created all things.\"    \"But I will show you something new,\" said Rabbit. Therefore Ikto  consented. He let go of Rabbit.    Rabbit stood in front of Ikto and said, \"Elder brother, if you wish  snow to fall at any time, take some hair such as this,\"--and he pulled  out some of his rabbit fur--\"and blow it in all directions; there will  be a blizzard.\"    Rabbit made a deep snow in this way, though the leaves were green.    At once, Ikto began to pull his own fur and say magic words. Rabbit  made a long leap and ran away. Ikto pulled his fur and blew it about.  But there was no snow. Then he pulled more fur, and blew it about.  Still there was no snow. It was only rabbit fur that made the snow.          THE SOUTHERN BRIDE    _Cherokee_      North went traveling, and after a long time, and after visiting many  tribes, he fell in love with the daughter of South.    South and his wife said, \"No. Ever since you came the weather has been  cold. If you stay we will all freeze.\"    North said he would go back to his own country. So South let his  daughter marry him. Then North went back to his own country with  South's daughter. All the people there lived in ice houses.    The next day, after sunrise, the houses began to leak. The ice began  to melt. It grew warmer and warmer. Then North's people came to him.  They said, \"It is the daughter of the South. If she lives here all the  lodges will melt. You must send her back to her father.\"    North said, \"No.\"    But every day it grew hotter. The lodges began to melt away. The  people said North must send his wife home. Therefore North had to send  her back to South.          THE FALLEN STAR    _Dakota_      A people had this camp. And there were two women sleeping out of doors  and looking up at the stars.    One of them said, \"I wish that that large and bright shining star were  my husband.\"    The other said, \"I wish the star that shines less brightly were my  husband.\"    And immediately both were immediately carried upward, they say. They  found themselves in a beautiful country which was full of beautiful  twin flowers. And they found that the star which had shone most  brightly was a large man; the other star was only a young man. So the  two stars married the two women and they lived in that beautiful Star  Country.    Now in that country was a plant, the Teepsinna, with large, attractive  stalks. The wife of the large star wanted to dig them. Her husband  said, \"No; no one does so here.\"    Then the camp moved. When the woman had pitched her tepee, and came  inside to lay the mats, she saw there a beautiful teepsinna. She said  to herself, \"I will dig this; no one will see me.\" So she took her  digging stick and dug the teepsinna; but when she pulled it out of the  earth, the foundation of the Star Country broke and she fell through  with her baby. So the woman died; but the baby was not injured. It lay  there stretched out.    An old man came that way. When he saw that the baby was alive, he took  it in his blanket and took it to his own lodge. He said to his wife,  \"Old woman, I saw "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22089"],[0,"The Liberty Minstrel (#13)"],[1,"a Nation's weal;  We'll trust thee in the battle's van--  We _hail_ thee as an honest man.

Oh! thus shall we mourn, and his memory's light    While it shines through our hearts will improve them;  For worth shall look fairer, and truth more bright,    When we think how he lived but to love them.

THE LIBERTY VOTER'S SONG.    Words by E. Wright, jr. Air, from \"Niel Gow's Farewell.\"      [Music]    The vote, the vote, the mighty vote,  Though once we used a humbler note,  And prayed our servants to be just,  We tell the now they must, they must.    Chorus.      The tyrant's grapple, by our vote,    We'll loosen from our brother's throat,    With Washington we here agree,    The vote's the weapon of the free.    We'll scatter not the precious power  On parties that to slavery cower;  But make it one against the wrong,  Till down it comes, a million strong.    The tyrant's grapple, &c.    We'll bake the dough-face with our vote,  Who stood the scorching when we wrote;  And paler than the milky way,  We'll bake the plastic face of CLAY.    The tyrant's grapple, &c.    Our vote shall teach all statesmen law,  Who in the Southern harness draw;  So well contented to be slaves,  They fain would prove their fathers knaves!    The tyrant's grapple, &c.    We'll not provoke our wives to use  A power that we through fear abuse;  His mother shall not blush to own  One voter of us for a son.    The tyrant's grapple, by our vote,    We'll loosen from our brother's throat;    With Washington we here agree,    Whose MOTHER taught him to be free!          THE LIBERTY BALL.    G.W.C. Air, \"Rosin the Bow.\"      [Music]    Come all ye true friends of the nation,    Attend to humanity's call;  Come aid the poor slave's liberation,    And roll on the liberty ball--      And roll on the liberty ball--      And roll on the liberty ball,      Come aid the poor slave's liberation,      And roll on the liberty ball.    The Liberty hosts are advancing--    For freedom to _all_ they declare;  The down-trodden millions are sighing--    Come, break up our gloom of despair.      Come break up our gloom of despair, &c.    Ye Democrats, come to the rescue,    And aid on the liberty cause,  And millions will rise up and bless you    With heart-cheering songs of applause,      With heart-cheering songs, &c.    Ye Whigs forsake CLAY and _John Tyler_!    And boldly step into our ranks;  We'll spread our pure banner still wider,    And invite all the friends of the banks,--      And invite all the friends of the banks, &c.    And when we have formed the blest union    We'll firmly march on, one and all--  We'll sing when we meet in communion,    And _roll on_ the liberty ball,      And roll on the liberty ball, &c.    How can you stand halting while virtue    Is sweetly appealing to all;  Then haste to the standard of duty,    And roll on the liberty ball;      And roll on the liberty ball, &c.    The question of test is now turning,    And freedom or slavery must fall,  While hope in the bosom is burning,    We'll roll on the liberty ball;      We'll roll on the liberty ball, &c.    Ye freemen attend to your voting,    Your ballots will answer the call;  And while others attend to _log-rolling_,    We'll roll on the liberty ball--      We'll roll on the liberty ball, &c.          The Trumpet of Freedom.      HARK! hark! to the TRUMPET of FREEDOM!    Her rallying signal she blows:  Come, gather around her broad banner,    And battle 'gainst Liberty's foes.    Our forefathers plighted their honor,    Their lives and their property, too,  To maintain in defiance of Britain,    Their principles, righteous and true.    We'll show to the world we are worthy    The blessings our ancestors won,  And finish the temple of Freedom,    That HANCOCK and FRANKLIN begun.    Hurra, for the old-fashioned doctrine,    That men are created all free!  We ever will boldly maintain it,    Nor care who the tyrant may be.    When Poland was fighting for freedom,    Our voices went over the sea,  To bid her God-speed in the contest--    That Poland, like us, might be free.    When down-trodden Greece had up-risen,    And baffled the Mahomet crew;  We rejoiced in the glorious issue,    That Greece had her liberty, too.    Repeal, do we also delight in--    Three cheers for the \"gem of the sea!\"  And soon may the bright day be dawning,    When Ireland, like us, shall be free.    Like us, who are foes to oppression;    But not like America now.  With shame do we blush to confess it,    Too many to slavery bow.    We're foes unto wrong and oppression,    No matter which side of the sea;  And ever intend to oppose them,    Till all of God's image are free.    Some tell us because men are colored,    They should not our sympathy share;  We ask not the form or complexion--    The seal of our Maker is there!    Success to the old-fashioned doctrine,    That men are created all free!  And down with the power of the despot,    Wherever his strongholds may be.    We're proud of the name of a freeman,    And proud of the character, too;  And never will do any action,    Save such as a freeman may do.    We'll finish the Temple of Freedom,    And make it capacious within,  That all who seek shelter may find it,    Whatever the hue of their skin.    For thus the Almighty designed It,    And gave to our fathers the plan;  Intending that liberty's blessings,    Should rest upon every man.    Then up with the cap-stone and cornice,    With columns encircle its wall,  Throw open its gateway, and make it    A HOME AND A REFUGE FOR ALL!          BREAK EVERY YOKE.    Tune--\"O no, we never mention her.\"      [Music]    Break every yoke, the Gospel cries,  And let th' oppressed go free,  Let every captive taste the joys  Of peace and liberty.    Send thy good Spirit from above,  And melt th' oppressor's heart,  Send sweet deliv'rance to the slave,  And bid his woes depart.    Lord, when shall man thy voice obey,  And rend each iron chain,  Oh when shall love its golden sway,  O'er all the earth maintain.    With freedom's blessings crown his day--  O'erflow his heart with love,  Teach him that straight and narrow way,  Which leads to rest above.          THE YANKEE GIRL.    Words by Whittier. Music by G.W.C.      [Music]    She sings by her wheel at that low cottage door,  Which the long evening shadow is stretching before;  With a music as sweet as the music which seems  Breathed softly and faint in the ear of our dreams!    How brilliant and mirthful the light of her eye,  Like a star glancing out from the blue of the sky!  And lightly and freely her dark tresses play  O'er a brow and a bosom as lovely as they!    Who comes in his pride to that low cottage-door--  The haughty and rich to the humble and poor?  'Tis the great Southern planter--the master who waves  His whip of dominion o'er hundreds of slaves.    \"Nay, Ellen--for shame! Let those Yankee fools spin,  Who would pass for our slaves with a change of their skin;  Let them toil as they will at the loom or the wheel,  Too stupid for shame, and too vulgar to feel!    \"But thou art too lovely and precious a gem  To be bound to their burdens and sullied by them--  For shame, Ellen, shame!--cast thy bondage aside,  And away to the South, as my blessing and pride.    \"Oh, come where no winter thy footsteps can wrong,  But where flowers are blossoming all the year long,  Where the shade of the palm tree is over my home,  And the lemon and orange are white in their bloom!    \"Oh, come to my home, where my servants shall all  Depart at thy bidding and come at thy call;  They shall heed thee as mistress with trembling and awe,  And each wish of thy heart shall be felt as a law.\"    Oh, could ye have seen her--that pride of our girls--  Arise and cast back the dark wealth of her curls,  With a scorn in her eye which the gazer could feel,  And a glance like the sunshine that flashes on steel!    \"Go back, haughty Southron! thy treasures of gold  Are dim with the blood of the hearts thou hast sold!  Thy home may be lovely, but round it I hear  The crack of the whip and the footsteps of fear!    \"And the sky of thy South may be brighter than ours,  And greener thy landscapes, and fairer thy flowers;  But, dearer the blast round our mountains which raves,  Than the sweet summer zephyr which breathes over slaves!    \"Full low at thy bidding thy negroes may kneel,  With the iron of bondage on spirit and heel;  Yet know that the Yankee girl sooner would be  In _fetters_ with _them_, than in freedom with _thee_!\"          FREEDOM'S GATHERING.    Words from the Pennsylvania Freeman. Music by G.W.C.      [Music]    A voice has gone forth, and the land is awake!  Our freemen shall gather from ocean to lake,  Our cause is as pure as the earth ever saw,  And our faith we will pledge in the thrilling huzza.      Then huzza, then huzza,  Truth's glittering falchion for freedom we draw.    Let them blacken our names and pursue us with ill,  Our hearts shall be faithful to liberty still;  Then rally!"]]]
