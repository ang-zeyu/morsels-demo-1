The popular tradition ran that, after his defeat,  Faesulae was destroyed, and its people, together with a colony  from Rome, made a settlement on the banks of the Arno, below the  mountain on which Faesulae had stood. The new town was named  Fiora, siccome fosse in fiore edificata, \"as though built among  flowers,\" but afterwards was called Fiorenza, or Florence. See G.  Villani, Cronica, I. xxxi.-xxxviii.      \"If all my entreaty were fulfilled,\" replied I to him, \"you would  not yet be placed in banishment from human nature; for in my mind  is fixed, and now fills my heart, the dear, good, paternal image  of you, when in the world hour by hour you taught me how man  makes himself eternal and in what gratitude I hold it, so long as  I live, it behoves that on my tongue should be discerned. That  which you tell me of my course I write, and reserve it to be  glossed with other text,[1] by a Lady, who will know how, if I  attain to her. Thus much would I have manifest to you: if only  that my conscience chide me not, for Fortune, as she will, I am  ready. Such earnest is not strange unto my ears; therefore let  Fortune turn her wheel as pleases her, and the churl his  mattock.\"[2]    [1] The prophecy by Ciacco of the fall of Dante's party, Canto  vi., and that by Farinata of Dante's exile, Canto x., which  Virgil had told should be made clear to him by Beatrice.

My Master then upon his right side turned himself back, and  looked at me; then said, \"He listens well who notes it.\"    Not the less for this do I go on speaking with Sir Brunetto, and  I ask, who are his most known and most eminent companions. And he  to me, \"To know of some is good, of the others silence will be  laudable for us, for the time would be short for so much speech.  In brief, know that all were clerks, and great men of letters,  and of great fame, defiled in the world with one same sin.  Priscian goes along with that disconsolate crowd, and Francesco  of Accorso;[1] and thou mightest also have seen, hadst thou had  desire of such scurf, him who by the Servant of Servants was  translated from Arno to Bacchiglione, where he left his  ill-strained nerves.[2] Of more would I tell, but the going on  and the speech cannot be longer, for I see yonder a new cloud  rising from the sand. Folk come with whom I must not be. Let my  Tesoro be commended to thee, in which I still am living, and more  I ask not.\"    [1] Priscian, the famous grammarian of the sixth century; Francis  of Accorso, a jurist of great repute, who taught at Oxford and at  Bologna, and died in 1294.

Third round of the Seventh Circle: of those who have  done violence to Nature.--Guido Guerra, Tegghiaio Aldobrandi and  Jacopo Rusticucci.--The roar of Phlegethon as it pours downward.--  The cord thrown into the abyss.    Now was I in a place where the resounding of the water that was  falling into the next circle was heard, like that hum which the  beehives make, when three shades together separated themselves,  running, from a troop that was passing under the rain of the  bitter torment. They came toward us, and each cried out, \"Stop  thou, that by thy garb seemest to us to be one from our wicked  city!\"    Ah me! what wounds I saw upon their limbs, recent and old, burnt  in by the flames. Still it grieves me for them but to remember  it.    To their cries my Teacher gave heed; he turned his face toward  me, and \"Now wait,\" he said; \"to these one should be courteous,  and were it not for the fire that the nature of the place shoots  out, I should say that haste better befitted thee than them.\"    They began again, when we stopped, the old verse, and when they  had reached us they made a wheel of themselves all three. As  champions naked and oiled are wont to do, watching their hold and  their vantage, before they come to blows and thrusts, thus,  wheeling, each directed his face on me, so that his neck in  contrary direction to his feet was making continuous journey.    \"Ah! if the misery of this shifting sand bring us and our prayers  into contempt,\" began one, \"and our darkened and blistered  aspect, let our fame incline thy mind to tell us who thou art,  that so securely plantest thy living feet in Hell. He whose  tracks thou seest me trample, though he go naked and singed, was  of greater state than thou thinkest. Grandson he was of the good  Gualdrada; his name was Guidoguerra, and in his life he did much  with counsel, and with the sword. The other who treads the sand  behind me is Tegghiaio Aldobrandi, whose fame should be welcome  in the world above. And I, who am set with them on the cross, was  Jacopo Rusticucci,[1] and surely my savage wife more than aught  else injures.    [1] Concerning Tegghiaio and Rusticucci Dante had enquired of  Ciacco, Canto vi. They and Guido Guerra were illustrious citizens  of Florence in the thirteenth century. Their deeds are recorded  by Villani and Ricordano Malespini. The good Gualdrada, famed for  her beauty and her modesty, was the daughter of Messer  Bellincione Berti, referred to in Cantos w. and wi. of Paradise  as one of the early worthies of the city. See O. Villani,  Cronica. V. xxxvii.      If I could have been sheltered from the fire I would have cast  myself below among them, and I think that the Teacher would have  permitted it; but because I should have been scorched and baked,  fear overcame my good will that made me greedy to embrace them.  Then I began: \"Not contempt, but grief, did your condition fix  within me, so that slowly will it be all divested, soon as this  my Lord said words to me by which I understood that such folk as  ye are might be coming. Of your city I am; and always your deeds  and honored names have I retraced and heard with affection. I  leave the gall and go for the sweet fruits promised me by my  veracious Leader; but far as the centre needs must I first  descend.\"    \"So may thy soul long direct thy limbs,\" replied he then, \"and so  may thy fame shine after thee, say if courtesy and valor abide in  our city as they were wont, or if they have quite gone forth from  it? For Guglielmo Borsiere,[1] who is in torment with us but  short while, and goes yonder with our companions, afflicts us  greatly with his words.\"    [1] Nothing is known from contemporary record of Borsiere, but  Boccaccio tells a story of him in the Decameron, giorn. i. nov.  8.      \"The new people and the sudden gains [1] have generated pride and  excess, Florence, in thee, so that already thou weepest thereat.\"  Thus cried I with face uplifted. And the three, who understood  that for answer, looked one at the other, as men look at hearing  truth.    [1] Florence had grown rapidly in population and in wealth during  the last years of the thirteenth century.      \"If other times it costeth thee so little,\" replied they all, \"to  satisfy others, happy thou that thus speakest at thy pleasure.  Therefore, if thou escapest from these dark places, and returnest  to see again the beautiful stars, when it shall rejoice thee to  say, 'I have been,' mind thou speak of us unto the people.\" Then  they broke the wheel, and in flying their swift legs seemed  wings.    Not an amen could have been said so quickly as they had  disappeared; wherefore it seemed good to my Master to depart. I  followed him, and we had gone little way before the sound of the  water was so near to us, that had we spoken we scarce had heard.  As that river on the left slope of the Apennine, which, the first  from Monte Veso toward the east, has its proper course,--which is  called Acquacheta up above, before it sinks valleyward into its  low bed, and at Forli no longer has that name,[1] --reverberates  from the alp in falling with a single leap there above San  Benedetto, where there ought to be shelter for a thousand;[2]  thus down from a precipitous bank we found that dark-tinted water  resounding, so that in short while it would have hurt the ears.    [1] At Forli the river is called the Montone; it was the first of  the rivers on the left of the Apennines that had its course to  the sea; the others before it being tributaries of the Po, which  rises on Monte Veso.    [2] These last words are obscure, and none of the commentators  explain them satisfactorily.      I had a cord girt around me, and with it I had once thought to  take the leopard of the dappled skin.[1] After I had loosed it  wholly from me, even as my Leader had commanded me, I reached it  to him wound up and coiled. Whereon he turned toward the right,  and somewhat far from the edge threw it down into that deep  abyss. \"And surely some strange thing must needs respond,\" said I  to myself, \"to the strange signal which the Master so follows  with his eye.\"    [2] The leopard of the dappled skin, which had often turned  back Dante from the Mountain to the Dark Wood (see Canto i.); the  type of sensual sin. The cord is the type of religions  asceticism, of which the poet no longer has need. The meaning of  its use as a signal is not apparent.      Ah! how cautious men ought to be near those who see not only the  act, but with their wisdom look within the thoughts. He said to  me: \"Soon will come up that which I await, and what thy thought  is dreaming must soon discover itself unto thy sight.\"    To that truth which has the aspect of falsehood ought one always  to close his lips so far as he can, because without"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19950"],[0,"Summa Theologica, Part III (Tertia Pars) (#13)"],[1,"another assuming it. For \"the works of the Trinity are  inseparable,\" as Augustine says (Enchiridion xxxviii). But as the  three Persons have one essence, so likewise They have one operation.  Now to assume is an operation. Therefore it cannot belong to one  without belonging to another.    Obj. 2: Further, as we say the Person of the Son became incarnate, so  also did the Nature; for \"the whole Divine Nature became incarnate in  one of Its hypostases,\" as Damascene says (De Fide Orth. iii, 6). But  the Nature is common to the three Persons. Therefore the assumption  is.    Obj. 3: Further, as the human nature in Christ is assumed by God, so  likewise are men assumed by Him through grace, according to Rom.  14:3: \"God hath taken him to Him.\" But this assumption pertains to  all the Persons; therefore the first also.    _On the contrary,_ Dionysius says (Div. Nom. ii) that the mystery of  the Incarnation pertains to \"discrete theology,\" i.e. according to  which something \"distinct\" is said of the Divine Persons.    _I answer that,_ As was said above (A. 1), assumption implies two  things, viz. the act of assuming and the term of assumption. Now the  act of assumption proceeds from the Divine power, which is common to  the three Persons, but the term of the assumption is a Person, as  stated above (A. 2). Hence what has to do with action in the  assumption is common to the three Persons; but what pertains to the  nature of term belongs to one Person in such a manner as not to  belong to another; for the three Persons caused the human nature to  be united to the one Person of the Son.    Reply Obj. 1: This reason regards the operation, and the conclusion  would follow if it implied this operation only, without the term,  which is a Person.    Reply Obj. 2: The Nature is said to be incarnate, and to assume by  reason of the Person in Whom the union is terminated, as stated above  (AA. 1, 2), and not as it is common to the three Persons. Now \"the  whole Divine Nature is\" said to be \"incarnate\"; not that It is  incarnate in all the Persons, but inasmuch as nothing is wanting to  the perfection of the Divine Nature of the Person incarnate, as  Damascene explains there.    Reply Obj. 3: The assumption which takes place by the grace of  adoption is terminated in a certain participation of the Divine  Nature, by an assimilation to Its goodness, according to 2 Pet. 1:4:  \"That you may be made partakers of the Divine Nature\"; and hence this  assumption is common to the three Persons, in regard to the principle  and the term. But the assumption which is by the grace of union is  common on the part of the principle, but not on the part of the term,  as was said above.  _______________________    FIFTH ARTICLE [III, Q. 3, Art. 5]    Whether Each of the Divine Persons Could Have Assumed Human Nature?    Objection 1: It would seem that no other Divine Person could have  assumed human nature except the Person of the Son. For by this  assumption it has been brought about that God is the Son of Man. But  it was not becoming that either the Father or the Holy Ghost should  be said to be a Son; for this would tend to the confusion of the  Divine Persons. Therefore the Father and Holy Ghost could not have  assumed flesh.    Obj. 2: Further, by the Divine Incarnation men have come into  possession of the adoption of sons, according to Rom. 8:15: \"For you  have not received the spirit of bondage again in fear, but the spirit  of adoption of sons.\" But sonship by adoption is a participated  likeness of natural sonship which does not belong to the Father nor  the Holy Ghost; hence it is said (Rom. 8:29): \"For whom He foreknew  He also predestinated to be made conformable to the image of His  Son.\" Therefore it seems that no other Person except the Person of  the Son could have become incarnate.    Obj. 3: Further, the Son is said to be sent and to be begotten by the  temporal nativity, inasmuch as He became incarnate. But it does not  belong to the Father to be sent, for He is innascible, as was said  above (I, Q. 32, A. 3; First Part, Q. 43, A. 4). Therefore at least  the Person of the Father cannot become incarnate.    _On the contrary,_ Whatever the Son can do, so can the Father and the  Holy Ghost, otherwise the power of the three Persons would not be  one. But the Son was able to become incarnate. Therefore the Father  and the Holy Ghost were able to become incarnate.    _I answer that,_ As was said above (AA. 1, 2, 4), assumption implies  two things, viz. the act of the one assuming and the term of the  assumption. Now the principle of the act is the Divine power, and the  term is a Person. But the Divine power is indifferently and commonly  in all the Persons. Moreover, the nature of Personality is common to  all the Persons, although the personal properties are different. Now  whenever a power regards several things indifferently, it can  terminate its action in any of them indifferently, as is plain in  rational powers, which regard opposites, and can do either of them.  Therefore the Divine power could have united human nature to the  Person of the Father or of the Holy Ghost, as It united it to the  Person of the Son. And hence we must say that the Father or the Holy  Ghost could have assumed flesh even as the Son.    Reply Obj. 1: The temporal sonship, whereby Christ is said to be the  Son of Man, does not constitute His Person, as does the eternal  Sonship; but is something following upon the temporal nativity.  Hence, if the name of son were transferred to the Father or the Holy  Ghost in this manner, there would be no confusion of the Divine  Persons.    Reply Obj. 2: Adoptive sonship is a certain participation of natural  sonship; but it takes place in us, by appropriation, by the Father,  Who is the principle of natural sonship, and by the gift of the Holy  Ghost, Who is the love of the Father and Son, according to Gal. 4:6:  \"God hath sent the Spirit of His Son into your hearts crying, Abba,  Father.\" And therefore, even as by the Incarnation of the Son we  receive adoptive sonship in the likeness of His natural sonship, so  likewise, had the Father become incarnate, we should have received  adoptive sonship from Him, as from the principle of the natural  sonship, and from the Holy Ghost as from the common bond of Father  and Son.    Reply Obj. 3: It belongs to the Father to be innascible as to eternal  birth, and the temporal birth would not destroy this. But the Son of  God is said to be sent in regard to the Incarnation, inasmuch as He  is from another, without which the Incarnation would not suffice for  the nature of mission.  _______________________    SIXTH ARTICLE [III, Q. 3, Art. 6]    Whether Several Divine Persons Can Assume One and the Same Individual  Nature?    Objection 1: It would seem that two Divine Persons cannot assume one  and the same individual nature. For, this being granted, there would  either be several men or one. But not several, for just as one Divine  Nature in several Persons does not make several gods, so one human  nature in several persons does not make several men. Nor would there  be only one man, for one man is \"this man,\" which signifies one  person; and hence the distinction of three Divine Persons would be  destroyed, which cannot be allowed. Therefore neither two nor three  Persons can take one human nature.    Obj. 2: Further, the assumption is terminated in the unity of Person,  as has been said above (A. 2). But the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost  are not one Person. Therefore the three Persons cannot assume one  human nature.    Obj. 3: Further, Damascene says (De Fide Orth. iii, 3, 4), and  Augustine (De Trin. i, 11, 12, 13), that from the Incarnation of God  the Son it follows that whatever is said of the Son of God is said of  the Son of Man, and conversely. Hence, if three Persons were to  assume one human nature, it would follow that whatever is said of  each of the three Persons would be said of the man; and conversely,  what was said of the man could be said of each of the three Persons.  Therefore what is proper to the Father, viz. to beget the Son, would  be said of the man, and consequently would be said of the Son of God;  and this could not be. Therefore it is impossible that the three  Persons should assume one human nature.    _On the contrary,_ The Incarnate Person subsists in two natures. But  the three Persons can subsist in one Divine Nature. Therefore they  can also subsist in one human nature in such a way that the human  nature be assumed by the three Persons.    _I answer that,_ As was said above (Q. 2, A. 5, ad 1), by the union  of the soul and body in Christ neither a new person is made nor a new  hypostasis, but one human nature is assumed to the Divine Person or  hypostasis, which, indeed, does not take place by the power of the  human nature, but by the power of the Divine Person. Now such is the  characteristic of the Divine Persons that one does not exclude  another from communicating in the same nature, but only in the same  Person. Hence, since in the mystery of the Incarnation \"the whole  reason of the deed is the power of the doer,\" as Augustine says (Ep.  ad Volusianum cxxxvii), we must judge of it in regard to the quality  of the Divine Person assuming, and not according to the quality of  the human nature assumed. Therefore it is not impossible that two or  three Divine Persons should assume one human nature, but it would be  impossible for them to assume one human hypostasis or person; thus  Anselm says in the book De Concep. Virg. (Cur Deus Homo ii, 9), that  \"several Persons cannot assume one and the same man to unity of  Person.\"    Reply Obj. 1: In the hypothesis that three Persons assume one human  nature, it would be true to say that the three Persons were one man,  because of the one human nature. For just as it is now true to say  the three Persons are one God on account of the one Divine Nature, so  it would be true to"]]]
