This cannot be said of  his most inelegant \"Valse Elegante,\" or of his numerous dances,  except, perhaps, his \"Valse Caprice.\"    He won in July, 1899, the prize offered to American composers by Henri  Marteau, for a sonata for violin and piano. The jury was composed of  such men as Dubois, Pierne, Diemer, and Pugno. The sonata is _quasi  fantasia_, and begins strongly with an evident intention to make use  of negro-tone. The first subject is so vigorously declared that one is  surprised to find that it is elastic enough to express a sweet pathos  and a deep gloom. It is rather fully developed before the second  subject enters; this, on the other hand, is hardly insinuated in its  relative major before the rather inelaborate elaboration begins. In  the romanza, syncopation and imitation are much relied on, though the  general atmosphere is that of a nocturne, a trio of dance-like manner  breaking in. The final rondo combines a clog with a choral intermezzo.  The work is noteworthy for its deep sincerity and great lyric beauty.      _Maurice Arnold._    The plantation dances of Maurice Arnold have an intrinsic interest  quite aside from their intrinsic value. Arnold, whose full name is  Maurice Arnold-Strothotte, was born in St. Louis in 1865. His mother  was a prominent pianist and gave him his first lessons in music. At  the age of fifteen he went to Cincinnati, studying at the College of  Music for three years. In 1883 he went to Germany to study  counterpoint and composition with Vierling and Urban in Berlin. The  latter discouraged him when he attempted to imbue a suite with a negro  plantation spirit.    Arnold now went upon a tramping tour in Hungary, Bulgaria, and Turkey.  Some of his compositions show the influence of his journey. He then  entered the Cologne Conservatory, studying under Wuellner, Neitzel,  and G. Jensen. His first piano sonata was performed there at a public  concert. He next went to Breslau, where, under the instruction of Max  Bruch, he wrote his cantata, \"The Wild Chase,\" and gave public  performance to other orchestral work. Returning now to St. Louis, he  busied himself as solo violinist and teacher, travelling also as a  conductor of opera companies. When Dvorak came here Arnold wrote his  \"Plantation Dances,\" which were produced in a concert under the  auspices of the Bohemian composer. Arnold was instructor of harmony at  the National Conservatory under Dvorak.    The \"Plantation Dances\" are Arnold's thirty-third opus, and they have  been much played by orchestras; they are also published as a piano  duet; the second dance also as a solo. Arnold has not made direct use  of Ethiopian themes, but has sought the African spirit. The first of  the dances is very nigresque; the second hardly at all, though it is a  delicious piece of music; the third dance uses banjo figures and  realizes darky hilarity in fine style; the fourth is a cake walk and  hits off the droll humor of that pompous ceremony fascinatingly.    Arnold's \"Dramatic Overture\" shows a fire and rush very characteristic  of him and likely to be kept up without sufficient contrast. So also  does his cantata, \"The Wild Chase.\" Arnold has written two comic  operas. I have heard parts of the first and noted moments of much  beauty and humor. The Aragonaise, which opens the third act, is  particularly delightful. The orchestration throughout displays  Arnold's characteristic studiousness in picturesque effect.    For piano there is a czardas, and a \"Valse Elegante\" for eight hands;  it is more Viennese than Chopinesque. It might indeed be called a  practicable waltz lavishly adorned. The fruits of Arnold's Oriental  journey are seen in his impressionistic \"Danse de la Midway  Plaisance;\" a very clever reminiscence of a Turkish minstrel; and a  Turkish march, which has been played by many German orchestras. There  is a \"Caprice Espagnol,\" which is delightful, and a \"Banjoenne,\" which  treats banjo music so captivatingly that Arnold may be said to have  invented a new and fertile and musical form. Besides these there are a  fugue for eight hands, a \"Minstrel Serenade\" for violin and piano, and  six duets for violin and viola.    There are also a few part songs and some solos, among which mention  should be made of \"Ein Maerlein,\" in the old German style, an  exquisitely tender \"Barcarolle,\" and a setting of the poem, \"I Think  of Thee in Silent Night,\" which makes use of a particularly beautiful  phrase for pre-, inter-, and postlude. Arnold has also written some  ballet music, a tarantelle for string orchestra, and is at work upon a  symphony, and a book, \"Some Points in Modern Orchestration.\" His  violin sonata (now in MS.) shows his original talent at its best. In  the first movement, the first subject is a snappy and taking example  of negro-tone, the second has the perfume of moonlit magnolia in its  lyricism. (In the reprise this subject, which had originally appeared  in the dominant major, recurs in the tonic major, the key of the  sonata being E minor.) The second movement is also in the darky  spirit, but full of melancholy. For finale the composer has flown to  Ireland and written a bully jig full of dash and spirit.      _N. Clifford Page._    The influence of Japanese and Chinese art upon our world of decoration  has long been realized. After considering the amount of interest shown  in the Celestial music by American composers, one is tempted to  prophesy a decided influence in this line, and a considerable spread  of Japanese influence in the world of music also. Japanese music has a  decorative effect that is sometimes almost as captivating as in  painting.    The city of San Francisco is the natural gateway for any such impulse,  and not a little of it has already passed the custom house. In this  field Edgar S. Kelley's influence is predominating, and it is not  surprising that he should pass the contagion on to his pupil,  Nathaniel Clifford Page, who was born in San Francisco, October 26,  1866. His ancestors were American for many years prior to the  Revolution. He composed operas at the age of twelve, and has used many  of these immature ideas with advantage in the later years. He began  the serious study of music at the age of sixteen, Kelley being his  principal teacher. His first opera, composed and orchestrated before  he became of age, was entitled \"The First Lieutenant.\" It was produced  in 1889 at the Tivoli Opera House in San Francisco, where most of the  critics spoke highly of its instrumental and Oriental color, some of  the scenes being laid in Morocco.    In instrumentation, which is considered Page's forte, he has never  had any instruction further than his own reading and investigation. He  began to conduct in opera and concert early in life, and has had much  experience. He has also been active as a teacher in harmony and  orchestration.    An important phase of Page's writing has been incidental music for  plays, his greatest success having been achieved by the music for the  \"Moonlight Blossom,\" a play based upon Japanese life and produced in  London in 1898. The overture was written entirely on actual Japanese  themes, including the national anthem of Japan. Page was three weeks  writing these twelve measures. He had a Japanese fiddle arranged with  a violin finger-board, but thanks to the highly characteristic  stubbornness of orchestral players, he was compelled to have this  part played by a mandolin. Two Japanese drums, a whistle used by a  Japanese shampooer, and a Japanese guitar were somehow permitted to  add their accent. The national air is used in augmentation later as  the bass for a Japanese song called \"K Honen.\" The fidelity of the  music is proved by the fact that Sir Edwin Arnold's Japanese wife  recognized the various airs and was carried away by the national  anthem.    Although the play was not a success, the music was given a cordial  reception, and brought Page contracts for other work in England,  including a play of Indian life by Mrs. Flora Annie Steel.    Previously to the writing of the \"Moonlight Blossom\" music, Page had  arranged the incidental music for the same author's play, \"The Cat  and the Cherub.\" Edgar S. Kelley's \"Aladdin\" music was the source from  which most of the incidental music was drawn; but Page added some  things of his own, among them being one of the most effective and  unexpected devices for producing a sense of horror and dread I have  ever listened to: simply the sounding at long intervals of two gruff  single tones in the extreme low register of the double basses and  bassoons. The grimness of this effect is indescribable.    An unnamed Oriental opera, and an opera called \"Villiers,\" in which  old English color is employed (including a grotesque dance of the  clumsy Ironsides), show the cosmopolitan restlessness of Page's muse.  An appalling scheme of self-amusement is seen in his \"Caprice,\" in  which a theme of eight measures' length is instrumented with almost  every contrapuntal device known, and with psychological variety that  runs through five movements, scherzando, vigoroso, con sentimento,  religioso, and a marcia fantastico. The suite called \"Village Fete\" is  an experiment in French local color. It contains five scenes: The  Peasants Going to Chapel; The Flower Girls; The Vagabonds; The Tryst;  The Sabot Dance; and the Entrance of the Mayor, which is a pompous  march.    On the occasion of a performance of this, Louis Arthur Russell wrote:  \"His orchestra is surely French, and as modern as you please. The  idiom is Berlioz's rather than Wagner's.\"          CHAPTER III.    THE ACADEMICS.      _John Knowles Paine._    [Illustration: JOHN KNOWLES PAINE.]    [Illustration: Autograph of John K.

Among the items to which I refer, are many of the customary salutations  and civilities of life; and the modes of _dress_. Now it is perfectly  obvious that many common phrases which are used at meeting and  separating, during the ordinary interviews and concerns of life, as  well as in correspondence, are in themselves wholly unmeaning. But  viewed as an introduction to things of more importance, these little  words and phrases at the opening of a conversation, and as the language  of hourly and daily salutation, are certainly useful. They are  indications of good and friendly feeling; and without them we should  not, and could not, secure the confidence of some of those among whom  we are obliged to live. They would regard us as not only unsocial, but  selfish; and not only selfish, but proud or misanthropic.    On account of meeting with much that disgusts us, many are tempted to  avoid society generally. The frivolous conversation, and still more  frivolous conduct, which they meet with, they regard as a waste of  time, and perhaps even deem it a duty to resign themselves to solitude.  This, however, is a great mistake. Those who have been most useful to  mankind acted very differently. They mingled with the world, in hopes  to do something towards reforming it. The greatest of philosophers, as  well as of Christians;--even the FOUNDER of Christianity himself--sat  down, and not only sat down, but ate and drank in the society of those  with whose manners, and especially whose vices, he could have had no  possible sympathy.    Zimmerman, who has generally been regarded as an apostle of solitude,  taught that men ought not to 'reside in deserts, or sleep, like owls,  in the hollow trunks of trees.' 'I sincerely exhort my disciples,' says  he, 'not to absent themselves morosely from public places, nor to avoid  the social throng; which cannot fail to afford to judicious, rational,  and feeling minds, many subjects both of amusement and instruction. It  is true, that we cannot relish the pleasures and taste the advantages  of society, without being able to give a patient hearing to the tongue  of folly, to excuse error, and to bear with infirmity.'    In like manner, we are not to disregard wholly, our dress. It is true  that the shape of a hat, or the cut of a coat may not add to the  strength of the mind, or the soundness of the morals; but it is also  true that people form an opinion often from our exterior appearance;  and will continue to do so: and first impressions are very difficult to  be overcome. If we regard our own usefulness, therefore, we shall not  consider the fashion or character of our dress as a little thing in its  results. I have said elsewhere that we ought neither to be the first  nor the last in a fashion.    We should remember, also, that the _world_, in its various parts and  aspects, is made up of little things. So true is this, that I have  sometimes been very fond of the paradoxical remark, that 'little things  are great things;' that is, in their _results_. For who does not know  that throughout the physical world, the mightiest results are brought  about by the silent working of small causes? It is not the tornado, or  the deluge, or even the occasional storm of rain, that renews and  animates nature, so much as the gentle breeze, the soft refreshing  shower, and the still softer and gentler dews of heaven.    So in human life, generally, they are the little things often, that  produce the mightier results. It is he who takes care of pence and  farthings, not he who neglects them, that thrives. It is he alone who  guards his lips against the first improper word,--trifling as it may  seem--that is secure against future profanity. He who indulges one  little draught of alcoholic drink, is in danger of ending a tippler; he  who gives loose to one impure thought, of ending the victim of lust and  sensuality. Nor is it one single gross, or as it were accidental act,  viewed as insulated from the rest--however injurious it may be--that  injures the body, or debases the mind, so much as the frequent  repetition of those smaller errors, whose habitual occurrence goes to  establish the predominating choice of the mind, or affection of the  soul.    Avoid then, the pernicious, the fatal error, that _little_ things are  of no consequence: little sums of money, little fragments of time,  little or trifling words, little or apparently unimportant actions. On  this subject I cannot help adopting--and feeling its force too,--the  language of a friend of temperance in regard to those who think  themselves perfectly secure from danger, and are believers in the  harmlessness of _little_ things. 'I tremble,' said he, 'for the man  that does not tremble for himself.'      SECTION XVII. _Of Anger, and the means of restraining it._    There is doubtless much difference of native temperament. One person is  easily excited, another, more slowly. But there is a greater difference  still, resulting from our habits.    If we find ourselves easily led into anger, we should be extremely  careful how we indulge the first steps that lead towards it. Those who  naturally possess a mild temper may, with considerable safety, do and  say many things which others cannot. Thus we often say of a person who  has met with a misfortune, 'It is good enough for him;' or of a  criminal who has just been condemned to suffer punishment, 'No matter;  he deserves it.' Or perhaps we go farther, and on finding him  acquitted, say, 'He ought to have been hanged, and even hanging was too  good for him.'    Now all these things, in the mouths of the irritable, lead the way to  an indulgence of anger, however unperceived may be the transition. It  is on this principle that the saying of St. John is so strikingly true;  'He that hateth his brother is a murderer;' that is, he that indulges  hatred has the seeds within him, not only of out-breaking anger, but of  murder.    It is on this account that I regret the common course taken with  children in relation to certain smaller tribes of the animal creation.  They are allowed not only to destroy them,--(which is doubtless often a  duty,) but to destroy them in _anger_; to indulge a permanent hatred  towards them; and to think this hatred creditable and scriptural. When  such feelings lead us to destroy even the most troublesome or  disgusting reptiles or insects _in anger_, we have so far prepared the  way for the indulgence of anger towards our fellow creatures, whenever  their conduct shall excite our displeasure.    We can hence see why he who has a violent temper should always speak in  a low voice, and study mildness and sweetness in his tones. For loud,  impassioned, and boisterous tones certainly excite impassioned  feelings. So do all the _actions_ which indicate anger. Thus Dr. Darwin  has said that any individual, by using the language and actions of an  angry person, towards an imaginary object of displeasure, and  accompanying them by threats, and blows, with a doubled or clinched  fist, may easily work himself into a rage. Of the justice of this  opinion I am fully convinced, from actual and repeated experiments.    If we find ourselves apt to be angry, we should endeavor to avoid the  road which leads to it. The first thing to be done, is to govern our  voice. On this point, the story of the Quaker and the merchant may not  be uninstructive.    A merchant in London had a dispute with a Quaker gentleman about the  settlement of an account. The merchant was determined to bring the  action _into court_,--a course of proceeding to which the Quaker was  wholly opposed;--he therefore used every argument in his power to  convince the merchant of his error; but all to no purpose.    Desirous of making a final effort, however, the Quaker called at the  house of the merchant, one morning, and inquired of the servant if his  master was at home. The merchant hearing the inquiry from the top of  the stairs, and knowing the voice, called out, loudly, 'Tell that  rascal I am not at home.' The Quaker, looking up towards him, said  calmly; 'Well, friend, may God put thee in a better mind.'    The merchant was struck with the meekness of the reply, and after  thinking more deliberately of the matter, became convinced that the  Quaker was right, and he in the wrong. He requested to see him, and  after acknowledging his error, said, 'I have one question to ask you.  How were you able to bear my abuse with so much patience?'    'Friend,' replied the Quaker, 'I will tell thee. I was naturally as hot  and violent as thou art. But I knew that to indulge my temper was  sinful, and also very foolish. I observed that men in a passion always  spoke very loud; and I thought if I could control my voice, I should  keep down my passions. I therefore made it a rule never to let it rise  above a certain key; and by a careful observance of this rule, I have,  with the blessing of God, entirely mastered my natural temper.'    When you are tempted by the conduct of those around you, to be angry,  endeavor to consider the matter for a few moments. If your temper be so  impetuous that you find this highly difficult, you may adopt some plan  or device for gaining time. Some recommend counting twenty or thirty,  deliberately. The following anecdote of the celebrated Zimmerman is  exactly in point, and may afford useful hints for instruction.    Owing in part to a diseased state of body, Zimmerman was sometimes  irritable. One day, a Russian princess and several other ladies entered  his apartment to inquire after his health; when, in a fit of petulance,  he rose, and requested them to leave the room. The prince entered some  time afterward, when Zimmerman had begun to repent of his rashness, and  after some intervening conversation, advised him, whenever he felt a  disposition to treat his friends so uncivilly again, to repeat,  _mentally_, the Lord's"]]]
