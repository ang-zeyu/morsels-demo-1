They  nearly resemble those which Mr. Banks has lately brought from the savage  countries in the Pacifick Ocean, and must have been made by a nation to  which the use of metals was unknown.    The number of this little community has never been counted by its ruler,  nor have I obtained any positive account, consistent with the result of  political computation.  Not many years ago, the late Laird led out one  hundred men upon a military expedition.  The sixth part of a people is  supposed capable of bearing arms: Raasay had therefore six hundred  inhabitants.  But because it is not likely, that every man able to serve  in the field would follow the summons, or that the chief would leave his  lands totally defenceless, or take away all the hands qualified for  labour, let it be supposed, that half as many might be permitted to stay  at home.  The whole number will then be nine hundred, or nine to a square  mile; a degree of populousness greater than those tracts of desolation  can often show.  They are content with their country, and faithful to  their chiefs, and yet uninfected with the fever of migration.    Near the house, at Raasay, is a chapel unroofed and ruinous, which has  long been used only as a place of burial.  About the churches, in the  Islands, are small squares inclosed with stone, which belong to  particular families, as repositories for the dead.  At Raasay there is  one, I think, for the proprietor, and one for some collateral house.    It is told by Martin, that at the death of the Lady of the Island, it has  been here the custom to erect a cross.  This we found not to be true.  The  stones that stand about the chapel at a small distance, some of which  perhaps have crosses cut upon them, are believed to have been not funeral  monuments, but the ancient boundaries of the sanctuary or consecrated  ground.    Martin was a man not illiterate: he was an inhabitant of Sky, and  therefore was within reach of intelligence, and with no great difficulty  might have visited the places which he undertakes to describe; yet with  all his opportunities, he has often suffered himself to be deceived.  He  lived in the last century, when the chiefs of the clans had lost little  of their original influence.  The mountains were yet unpenetrated, no  inlet was opened to foreign novelties, and the feudal institution  operated upon life with their full force.  He might therefore have  displayed a series of subordination and a form of government, which, in  more luminous and improved regions, have been long forgotten, and have  delighted his readers with many uncouth customs that are now disused, and  wild opinions that prevail no longer.  But he probably had not knowledge  of the world sufficient to qualify him for judging what would deserve or  gain the attention of mankind.  The mode of life which was familiar to  himself, he did not suppose unknown to others, nor imagined that he could  give pleasure by telling that of which it was, in his little country,  impossible to be ignorant.    What he has neglected cannot now be performed.  In nations, where there  is hardly the use of letters, what is once out of sight is lost for ever.  They think but little, and of their few thoughts, none are wasted on the  past, in which they are neither interested by fear nor hope.  Their only  registers are stated observances and practical representations.  For this  reason an age of ignorance is an age of ceremony.  Pageants, and  processions, and commemorations, gradually shrink away, as better methods  come into use of recording events, and preserving rights.    It is not only in Raasay that the chapel is unroofed and useless; through  the few islands which we visited, we neither saw nor heard of any house  of prayer, except in Sky, that was not in ruins.  The malignant influence  of Calvinism has blasted ceremony and decency together; and if the  remembrance of papal superstition is obliterated, the monuments of papal  piety are likewise effaced.    It has been, for many years, popular to talk of the lazy devotion of the  Romish clergy; over the sleepy laziness of men that erected churches, we  may indulge our superiority with a new triumph, by comparing it with the  fervid activity of those who suffer them to fall.    Of the destruction of churches, the decay of religion must in time be the  consequence; for while the publick acts of the ministry are now performed  in houses, a very small number can be present; and as the greater part of  the Islanders make no use of books, all must necessarily live in total  ignorance who want the opportunity of vocal instruction.    From these remains of ancient sanctity, which are every where to be  found, it has been conjectured, that, for the last two centuries, the  inhabitants of the Islands have decreased in number.  This argument,  which supposes that the churches have been suffered to fall, only because  they were no longer necessary, would have some force, if the houses of  worship still remaining were sufficient for the people.  But since they  have now no churches at all, these venerable fragments do not prove the  people of former times to have been more numerous, but to have been more  devout.  If the inhabitants were doubled with their present principles,  it appears not that any provision for publick worship would be made.  Where the religion of a country enforces consecrated buildings, the  number of those buildings may be supposed to afford some indication,  however uncertain, of the populousness of the place; but where by a  change of manners a nation is contented to live without them, their decay  implies no diminution of inhabitants.    Some of these dilapidations are said to be found in islands now  uninhabited; but I doubt whether we can thence infer that they were ever  peopled.  The religion of the middle age, is well known to have placed  too much hope in lonely austerities.  Voluntary solitude was the great  act of propitiation, by which crimes were effaced, and conscience was  appeased; it is therefore not unlikely, that oratories were often built  in places where retirement was sure to have no disturbance.    Raasay has little that can detain a traveller, except the Laird and his  family; but their power wants no auxiliaries.  Such a seat of  hospitality, amidst the winds and waters, fills the imagination with a  delightful contrariety of images.  Without is the rough ocean and the  rocky land, the beating billows and the howling storm: within is plenty  and elegance, beauty and gaiety, the song and the dance.  In Raasay, if I  could have found an Ulysses, I had fancied a Phoeacia.          DUNVEGAN      At Raasay, by good fortune, Macleod, so the chief of the clan is called,  was paying a visit, and by him we were invited to his seat at Dunvegan.  Raasay has a stout boat, built in Norway, in which, with six oars, he  conveyed us back to Sky.  We landed at Port Re, so called, because James  the Fifth of Scotland, who had curiosity to visit the Islands, came into  it.  The port is made by an inlet of the sea, deep and narrow, where a  ship lay waiting to dispeople Sky, by carrying the natives away to  America.    In coasting Sky, we passed by the cavern in which it was the custom, as  Martin relates, to catch birds in the night, by making a fire at the  entrance.  This practice is disused; for the birds, as is known often to  happen, have changed their haunts.    Here we dined at a publick house, I believe the only inn of the island,  and having mounted our horses, travelled in the manner already described,  till we came to Kingsborough, a place distinguished by that name, because  the King lodged here when he landed at Port Re.  We were entertained with  the usual hospitality by Mr. Macdonald and his lady, Flora Macdonald, a  name that will be mentioned in history, and if courage and fidelity be  virtues, mentioned with honour.  She is a woman of middle stature, soft  features, gentle manners, and elegant presence.    In the morning we sent our horses round a promontory to meet us, and  spared ourselves part of the day's fatigue, by crossing an arm of the  sea.  We had at last some difficulty in coming to Dunvegan; for our way  led over an extensive moor, where every step was to be taken with  caution, and we were often obliged to alight, because the ground could  not be trusted.  In travelling this watery flat, I perceived that it had  a visible declivity, and might without much expence or difficulty be  drained.  But difficulty and expence are relative terms, which have  different meanings in different places.    To Dunvegan we came, very willing to be at rest, and found our fatigue  amply recompensed by our reception.  Lady Macleod, who had lived many  years in England, was newly come hither with her son and four daughters,  who knew all the arts of southern elegance, and all the modes of English  economy.  Here therefore we settled, and did not spoil the present hour  with thoughts of departure.    Dunvegan is a rocky prominence, that juts out into a bay, on the west  side of Sky.  The house, which is the principal seat of Macleod, is  partly old and partly modern; it is built upon the rock, and looks upon  the water.  It forms two sides of a small square: on the third side is  the skeleton of a castle of unknown antiquity, supposed to have been a  Norwegian fortress, when the Danes were masters of the Islands.  It is so  nearly entire, that it might have easily been made habitable, were there  not an ominous tradition in the family, that the owner shall not long  outlive the reparation.  The grandfather of the present Laird, in  defiance of prediction, began the work, but desisted in a little time,  and applied his money to worse uses.    As the inhabitants of the Hebrides lived, for many ages, in continual  expectation of hostilities, the chief of every clan resided in a  fortress."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20656"],[0,"Old Christmas: from the Sketch Book of Washington Irving (#13)"],[1,"made into a pie, at one end of which the head appeared  above the crust in all its plumage, with the beak richly gilt; at the  other end the tail was displayed. Such pies were served up at the solemn  banquets of chivalry, when Knights-errant pledged themselves to  undertake any perilous enterprise; whence came the ancient oath, used by  Justice Shallow, \"by cock and pie.\"    The peacock was also an important dish for the Christmas feast; and  Massinger, in his City Madam, gives some idea of the extravagance with  which this, as well as other dishes, was prepared for the gorgeous  revels of the olden times:--          \"Men may talk of country Christmasses,         Their thirty pound butter'd eggs, their pies of carps' tongues:         Their pheasants drench'd with ambergris; _the carcases of three             fat wethers bruised for gravy, to make sauce for a single             peacock_!\"      NOTE G, p. 133.    The Wassail Bowl was sometimes composed of ale instead of wine; with  nutmeg, sugar, toast, ginger, and roasted crabs; in this way the  nut-brown beverage is still prepared in some old families, and round the  hearths of substantial farmers at Christmas. It is also called Lambs'  Wool, and is celebrated by Herrick in his \"Twelfth Night:\"--                \"Next crowne the bowle full               With gentle Lambs' Wool,            Add sugar, nutmeg, and ginger,               With store of ale too;               And thus ye must doe            To make the Wassaile a swinger.\"      NOTE H, p. 134.    \"The custom of drinking out of the same cup gave place to each having  his cup. When the steward came to the doore with the Wassel, he was to  cry three times, _Wassel, Wassel, Wassel_, and then the chappel  (chaplain) was to answer with a song.\"--ARCHAEOLOGIA.

NOTE J, p. 151.    Maskings or mummeries were favourite sports at Christmas in old times;  and the wardrobes at halls and manor-houses were often laid under  contribution to furnish dresses and fantastic disguisings. I strongly  suspect Master Simon to have taken the idea of his from Ben Jonson's  Masque of Christmas.      NOTE K, p. 156.    Sir John Hawkins, speaking of the dance called the Pavon, from pavo, a  peacock, says, \"It is a grave and majestic dance; the method of dancing  it anciently was by gentlemen dressed with caps and swords, by those of  the long robe in their gowns, by the peers in their mantles, and by the  ladies in gowns with long trains, the motion whereof, in dancing,  resembled that of a peacock.\"--_History of Music._          _Printed by_ R. & R.
