Folio was being piled upon folio, when a sudden blow  threatened to put an end to the whole proceeding in a summary manner.  The Cardinal was seized by violent illness, and appeared to be upon his  deathbed. Manning thought for a moment that his labours had been in vain  and that all was lost. But the Cardinal recovered; Monsignor Talbot used  his influence as he alone knew how; and a papal decree was issued by  which Dr. Errington was 'liberated' from the Coadjutorship of  Westminster, together with the right of succession to the See.    It was a supreme act of authority--a 'colpo di stato di Dominiddio', as  the Pope himself said--and the blow to the Old Catholics was  correspondingly severe. They found themselves deprived at one fell swoop  both of the influence of their most energetic supporter and of the  certainty of coming into power at Wiseman's death. And in the meantime,  Manning was redoubling his energies at Bayswater. Though his Oblates had  been checked over St. Edmund's, there was still no lack of work for them  to do. There were missions to be carried on, schools to be managed,  funds to be collected. Several new churches were built; a community of  most edifying nuns of the Third Order of St. Francis was established;  and L30,000, raised from Manning's private resources and from those of  his friends, was spent in three years. 'I hate that man,' one of the Old  Catholics exclaimed, 'he is such a forward piece.' The words were  reported to Manning, who shrugged his shoulders.    'Poor man,' he said, 'what is he made of? Does he suppose, in his  foolishness, that after working day and night for twenty years in heresy  and schism, on becoming a Catholic, I should sit in an easy-chair and  fold my hands all the rest of my life?'    But his secret thoughts were of a different caste.    'I am conscious of a desire,' he wrote in his Diary, 'to be in such a  position: (I) as I had in times past; (2) as my present circumstances  imply; (3) as my friends think me fit for; and (4) as I feel my own  faculties tend to.    'But, God being my helper, I will not seek it by the lifting of a finger  or the speaking, of a word.'    So Manning wrote, and thought, and prayed; but what are words, and  thoughts, and even prayers, to the mysterious and relentless powers of  circumstance and character? Cardinal Wiseman was slowly dying; the  tiller of the Church was slipping from his feeble hand; and Manning was  beside him, the one man with the energy, the ability, the courage, and  the conviction to steer the ship upon her course. More than that; there  was the sinister figure of a Dr. Errington crouching close at hand,  ready to seize the helm and make straight--who could doubt it?--for the  rocks. In such a situation the voice of self-abnegation must needs grow  still and small indeed. Yet it spoke on, for it was one of the paradoxes  in Manning's soul that that voice was never silent. Whatever else he  was, he was not unscrupulous. Rather, his scruples deepened with his  desires; and he could satisfy his most exorbitant ambitions in a  profundity of self-abasement. And so now he vowed to Heaven that he  would SEEK nothing--no, not by the lifting of a finger or the speaking  of a word. But, if something came to him--? He had vowed not to seek; he  had not vowed not to take. Might it not be his plain duty to take? Might  it not be the will of God?    Something, of course, did come to him, though it seemed for a moment  that it would elude his grasp. Wiseman died, and there ensued in Rome a  crisis of extraordinary intensity. 'Since the creation of the  hierarchy,' Monsignor Talbot wrote, it is the greatest moment for the  Church that I have yet seen.' It was the duty of the Chapter of  Westminster to nominate three candidates for succession to the  Archbishopric; they made one last effort, and had the temerity to place  upon the list, besides the names of two Old Catholic bishops, that of  Dr. Errington. It was a fatal blunder. Pius IX was furious; the Chapter  had committed an 'insulta al Papa', he exclaimed, striking his breast  three times in his rage. 'It was the Chapter that did it,' said Manning,  afterwards; but even after the Chapter's indiscretion, the fatal  decision hung in the balance for weeks.    'The great point of anxiety with me, wrote Monsignor Talbot to Manning,  'is whether a Congregation will be held, or whether the Holy Father will  perform a Pontifical act. He himself is doubting. I therefore say mass  and pray every morning that he may have the courage to choose for  himself, instead of submitting the matter to a Congregation. Although  the Cardinals are determined to reject Dr. Errington, nevertheless I am  afraid that they should select one of the others. You know very well  that Congregations are guided by the documents that are placed before  them; it is for this reason that I should prefer the Pope's acting  himself.'    But the Holy Father himself was doubting. In his indecision, he ordered  a month of prayers and masses. The suspense grew and grew. Everything  seemed against Manning. The whole English episcopate was opposed to him;  he had quarrelled with the Chapter; he was a convert of but few years'  standing; even the congregated Cardinals did not venture to suggest the  appointment of such a man. But suddenly, the Holy Father's doubts came  to an end. He heard a voice--a mysterious inward voice--whispering  something in his ear. 'Mettetelo li! Mettetelo li!' the voice repeated,  over and over again. Mettetelo li! It was an inspiration; and Pius IX,  brushing aside the recommendations of the Chapter and the deliberations  of the Cardinals, made Manning, by a Pontifical act, Archbishop of  Westminster.    Monsignor Talbot's felicity was complete; and he took occasion in  conveying his congratulations to his friend, to make some illuminating  reflections upon the great event.    'MY policy throughout,' he wrote, 'was never to propose you DIRECTLY to  the Pope, but, to make others do so, so that both you and I can always  say that it was not I who induced the Holy Father to name you--which  would lessen the weight of your appointment. This I say, because many  have said that your being named was all my doing. I do not say that the  Pope did not know that I thought you the only man eligible--as I took  care to tell him over and over again what was against all the other  candidates--and in consequence, he was almost driven into naming you.  After he had named you, the Holy Father said to me, \"What a diplomatist  you are, to make what you wished come to pass!\"    'Nevertheless,' concluded Monsignor Talbot, 'I believe your appointment  was specially directed by the Holy Ghost.'    Manning himself was apparently of the same opinion.    'My dear Child,' he wrote to a lady penitent, 'I have in these last  three weeks felt as if our Lord had called me by name. Everything else  has passed out of my mind. The firm belief that I have long had that the  Holy Father is the most supernatural person I have ever seen has given  me this feeling more deeply. 'Still, I feel as if I had been brought,  contrary to all human wills, by the Divine Will, into an immediate  relation to our Divine Lord.'    'If indeed,' he wrote to Lady Herbert, 'it were the will of our Divine  Lord to lay upon me this heavy burden, He could have done it in no way  more strengthening and consoling to me. To receive it from the hands of  His Vicar, and from Pius IX, and after long invocation of the Holy  Ghost, and not only without human influences, but in spite of manifold  aria powerful human opposition, gives me the last strength for such a  cross.'      VI    MANNING'S appointment filled his opponents with alarm. Wrath and  vengeance seemed to be hanging over them; what might not be expected  from the formidable enemy against whom they had struggled for so long,  and who now stood among them armed with archiepiscopal powers and  invested with the special confidence of Rome? Great was their amazement,  great was their relief, when they found that their dreaded master  breathed nothing but kindness, gentleness, and conciliation. The old  scores, they found, were not to be paid off, but to be wiped out. The  new archbishop poured forth upon every side all the tact, all the  courtesy, all the dignified graces of a Christian magnanimity. It was  impossible to withstand such treatment. Bishops who had spent years in  thwarting him became his devoted adherents; even the Chapter of  Westminster forgot its hatred. Monsignor Talbot was extremely surprised.  'Your greatest enemies have entirely come round,' he wrote. 'I received  the other day a panegyric of you from Searle. This change of feeling I  cannot attribute to anything but the Holy Ghost.' Monsignor Talbot was  very fond of the Holy Ghost; but, so far, at any rate as Searle was  concerned, there was another explanation. Manning, instead of dismissing  Searle from his position of 'oeconomus' in the episcopal household, had  kept him on--at an increased salary; and the poor man, who had not  scrupled in the days of his pride to call Manning a thief, was now duly  grateful.    As to Dr. Errington, he gave an example of humility and submission by at  once withdrawing into a complete obscurity. For years the Archbishop of  Trebizond, the ejected heir to the See of Westminster, laboured as a  parish priest in the Isle of Man. He nursed no resentment in his heart,  and, after a long and edifying life of peace and silence, he died in  1886, a professor of theology at Clifton.    It might be supposed that Manning could now feel that his triumph was  complete. His position was secure; his power was absolute; his prestige  was daily growing. Yet there was something that irked him still. As he  cast his eyes over the Roman Catholic community in England, he was aware  of one figure"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2449"],[0,"The Common Law (#13)"],[1,"is not to prevent trespasses, even when committed by night, but  only such trespasses as are the first step to wrongs of a greater  magnitude, like robbery or murder. /3/ In this case the function  of intent when proved appears more clearly than in theft, but it  is precisely similar. It is an index to the probability of  certain future acts which the law seeks to prevent. And here the  law gives evidence that this is the true explanation. For if the  apprehended act did follow, then it is no longer necessary to  allege that the breaking and entering was with that intent. An  indictment for burglary which charges that [75] the defendant  broke into a dwelling-house and stole certain property, is just  as good as one which alleges that he broke in with intent to  steal. /1/    It is believed that enough has now been said to explain the  general theory of criminal liability, as it stands at common law.  The result may be summed up as follows. All acts are indifferent  per se.    In the characteristic type of substantive crime acts are rendered  criminal because they are done finder circumstances in which they  will probably cause some harm which the law seeks to prevent.    The test of criminality in such cases is the degree of danger  shown by experience to attend that act under those circumstances.    In such cases the mens rea, or actual wickedness of the party, is  wholly unnecessary, and all reference to the state of his  consciousness is misleading if it means anything more than that  the circumstances in connection with which the tendency of his  act is judged are the circumstances known to him. Even the  requirement of knowledge is subject to certain limitations. A man  must find out at his peril things which a reasonable and prudent  man would have inferred from the things actually known. In some  cases, especially of statutory crimes, he must go even further,  and, when he knows certain facts, must find out at his peril  whether the other facts are present which would make the act  criminal. A man who abducts a girl from her parents in England  must find out at his peril whether she is under sixteen.    [76] In some cases it may be that the consequence of the act,  under the circumstances, must be actually foreseen, if it is a  consequence which a prudent man would not have foreseen. The  reference to the prudent man, as a standard, is the only form in  which blameworthiness as such is an element of crime, and what  would be blameworthy in such a man is an element;--first, as a  survival of true moral standards; second, because to punish what  would not be blameworthy in an average member of the community  would be to enforce a standard which was indefensible  theoretically, and which practically was too high for that  community.    In some cases, actual malice or intent, in the common meaning of  those words, is an element in crime. But it will be found that,  when it is so, it is because the act when done maliciously is  followed by harm which would not have followed the act alone, or  because the intent raises a strong probability that an act,  innocent in itself, will be followed by other acts or events in  connection with which it will accomplish the result sought to be  prevented by the law.      [77]          LECTURE III. -- TORTS.--TRESPASS AND NEGLIGENCE.    The object of the next two Lectures is to discover whether there  is any common ground at the bottom of all liability in tort, and  if so, what that ground is. Supposing the attempt to succeed, it  will reveal the general principle of civil liability at common  law. The liabilities incurred by way of contract are more or less  expressly fixed by the agreement of the parties concerned, but  those arising from a tort are independent of any previous consent  of the wrong-doer to bear the loss occasioned by his act. If A  fails to pay a certain sum on a certain day, or to deliver a  lecture on a certain night, after having made a binding promise  to do so, the damages which he has to pay are recovered in  accordance with his consent that some or all of the harms which  may be caused by his failure shall fall upon him. But when A  assaults or slanders his neighbor, or converts his neighbor's  property, he does a harm which he has never consented to bear,  and if the law makes him pay for it, the reason for doing so must  be found in some general view of the conduct which every one may  fairly expect and demand from every other, whether that other has  agreed to it or not.    Such a general view is very hard to find. The law did not begin  with a theory. It has never worked one out. The point from which  it started and that at which I shall [78] try to show that it has  arrived, are on different planes. In the progress from one to the  other, it is to be expected that its course should not be  straight and its direction not always visible. All that can be  done is to point out a tendency, and to justify it. The tendency,  which is our main concern, is a matter of fact to be gathered  from the cases. But the difficulty of showing it is much enhanced  by the circumstance that, until lately, the substantive law has  been approached only through the categories of the forms of  action. Discussions of legislative principle have been darkened  by arguments on the limits between trespass and case, or on the  scope of a general issue. In place of a theory of tort, we have a  theory of trespass. And even within that narrower limit,  precedents of the time of the assize and jurata have been applied  without a thought of their connection with a long forgotten  procedure.    Since the ancient forms of action have disappeared, a broader  treatment of the subject ought to be possible. Ignorance is the  best of law reformers. People are glad to discuss a question on  general principles, when they have forgotten the special  knowledge necessary for technical reasoning. But the present  willingness to generalize is founded on more than merely negative  grounds. The philosophical habit of the day, the frequency of  legislation, and the ease with which the law may be changed to  meet the opinions and wishes of the public, all make it natural  and unavoidable that judges as well as others should openly  discuss the legislative principles upon which their decisions  must always rest in the end, and should base their judgments upon  broad considerations of policy to which the traditions of the  bench would hardly have tolerated a reference fifty years ago.    [79] The business of the law of torts is to fix the dividing  lines between those cases in which a man is liable for harm which  he has done, and those in which he is not. But it cannot enable  him to predict with certainty whether a given act under given  circumstances will make him liable, because an act will rarely  have that effect unless followed by damage, and for the most  part, if not always, the consequences of an act are not known,  but only guessed at as more or less probable. All the rules that  the law can lay down beforehand are rules for determining the  conduct which will be followed by liability if it is followed by  harm--that is, the conduct which a man pursues at his peril. The  only guide for the future to be drawn from a decision against a  defendant in an action of tort is that similar acts, under  circumstances which cannot be distinguished except by the result  from those of the defendant, are done at the peril of the actor;  that if he escapes liability, it is simply because by good  fortune no harm comes of his conduct in the particular event.    If, therefore, there is any common ground for all liability in  tort, we shall best find it by eliminating the event as it  actually turns out, and by considering only the principles on  which the peril of his conduct is thrown upon the actor. We are  to ask what are the elements, on the defendant's side, which must  all be present before liability is possible, and the presence of  which will commonly make him liable if damage follows.    The law of torts abounds in moral phraseology. It has much to say  of wrongs, of malice, fraud, intent, and negligence. Hence it may  naturally be supposed that the risk of a man's conduct is thrown  upon him as the result of some moral short-coming. But while this  notion has been [80] entertained, the extreme opposite will be  found to have been a far more popular opinion;--I mean the notion  that a man is answerable for all the consequences of his acts,  or, in other words, that he acts at his peril always, and wholly  irrespective of the state of his consciousness upon the matter.    To test the former opinion it would be natural to take up  successively the several words, such as negligence and intent,  which in the language of morals designate various well-understood  states of mind, and to show their significance in the law. To  test the latter, it would perhaps be more convenient to consider  it under the head of the several forms of action. So many of our  authorities are decisions under one or another of these forms,  that it will not be safe to neglect them, at least in the first  instance; and a compromise between the two modes of approaching  the subject may be reached by beginning with the action of  trespass and the notion of negligence together, leaving wrongs  which are defined as intentional for the next Lecture.    Trespass lies for unintentional, as well as for intended wrongs.  Any wrongful and direct application of force is redressed by that  action. It therefore affords a fair field for a discussion of the  general principles of liability for unintentional wrongs at  common law. For it can hardly be supposed that a man's  responsibility for the consequences of his acts varies as the  remedy happens to fall on one side or the other of the penumbra  which separates trespass from the action on the case. And the  greater part of the law of torts will be found under one or the"]]]
