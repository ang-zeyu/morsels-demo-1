Miltiades and the remaining four contended that not a moment  should be lost in fighting the Persians, not only in order to avail  themselves of the present enthusiasm of the people, but still more to  prevent treachery from spreading among their ranks. Callimachus, the  Polemarch, yielded to the arguments of Miltiades, and gave his vote for  the battle.  The ten generals commanded their army in rotation, each  for one day; but they now agreed to surrender to Miltiades their days  of command, in order to invest the whole power in a single person.  While the Athenians were preparing for battle, they received unexpected  assistance from the little town or Plataea, in Boeotia.  Grateful to  the Athenians for the assistance which they had rendered them against  the Thebans, the whole force of Plataea, amounting to 1000 heavy-armed  men, marched to the assistance of their allies and joined them at  Marathon.  The Athenian army numbered only 10,000 hoplites, or  heavy-armed soldiers:  there were no archers or cavalry, and only some  slaves as light-armed attendants.  Of the number of the Persian army we  have no trustworthy account, but the lowest estimate makes it consist  of 110,000 men.    The plain of Marathon lies on the eastern coast of Attica, at the  distance of twenty-two miles from Athens by the shortest road. It is in  the form of a crescent, the horns of which consist of two promontories  running into the sea, and forming a semicircular bay.  This plain is  about six miles in length, and in its widest or central part about two  in breadth.  On the day of battle the Persian army was drawn up along  the plain about a mile from the sea, and their fleet was ranged behind  them on the beach.  The Athenians occupied the rising ground above the  plain, and extended from one side of the plain to the other.  This  arrangement was necessary in order to protect their flanks by the  mountains on each side, and to prevent the cavalry from passing round  to attack them in rear.  But so large a breadth of ground could not be  occupied with a small a number of men without weakening some portion of  the line.  Miltiades, therefore, drew up the troops in the centre in  shallow files, and resolved to rely for success upon the stronger and  deeper masses of his wings.  The right wing, which was the post of  honour in a Grecian army, was commanded by the Polemarch Callimachus;  the hoplites were arranged in the order of their tribes, so that the  members of the same tribe fought by each other's side; and at the  extreme left stood the Plataeans.    Miltiades, anxious to come to close quarters as speedily as possible,  ordered his soldiers to advance at a running step over the mile of  ground which separated them from the foe.  Both the Athenian wings were  successful, and drove the enemy before them towards the shore and the  marshes.  But the Athenian centre was broken by the Persians, and  compelled to take to flight. Miltiades thereupon recalled his wings  from pursuit, and charged the Persian centre.  The latter could not  withstand this combined attack.  The rout now became general along the  whole Persian line; and they fled to their ships, pursued by the  Athenians.    The Persians lost 6400 men in this memorable engagement:  of the  Athenians only 192 fell.  The aged tyrant Hippias is said to have  perished in the battle, and the brave Polemarch Callimachus was also  one of the slain.  The Persians embarked and sailed away to Asia.  Their departure was hailed at Athens with one unanimous burst of  heartfelt joy.  Marathon became a magic word at Athens. The Athenian  people in succeeding ages always looked back upon this day as the most  glorious in their annals, and never tired of hearing its praises  sounded by their orators and poets.  And they had reason to be proud of  it.  It was the first time that the Greeks had ever defeated the  Persians in the field.  It was the exploit of the Athenians alone.  It  had saved not only Athens but all Greece.  If the Persians had  conquered at Marathon, Greece must, in all likelihood, have become a  Persian province; the destinies of the world would have been changed;  and oriental despotism might still have brooded over the fairest  countries of Europe.    The one hundred and ninety-two Athenians who had perished in the battle  were buried on the field, and over their remains a tumulus or mound was  erected, which may still be seen about half a mile from the sea.    Shortly after the battle Miltiades requested of the Athenians a fleet  of seventy ships, without telling them the object of his expedition,  but only promising to enrich the state.  Such unbounded confidence did  the Athenians repose in the hero of Marathon, that they at once  complied with his demand.  This confidence Miltiades abused.  In order  to gratify a private animosity against one of the leading citizens of  Paros, he sailed to this island and laid siege to the town.  The  citizens repelled all his attacks; and having received a dangerous  injury on his thigh, he was compelled to raise the siege and return to  Athens. Loud was the indignation against Miltiades on his return.  He  was accused by Xanthippus, the father of Pericles, of having deceived  the people, and was brought to trial.  His wound had already begun to  show symptoms of gangrene.  He was carried into court on a couch, and  there lay before the assembled judges, while his friends pleaded on his  behalf.  They could offer no excuse for his recent conduct, but they  reminded the Athenians of the services he had rendered, and, begged  them to spare the victor of Marathon.  The judges were not insensible  to this appeal; and instead of condemning him to death as the accuser  had demanded, they commuted the penalty to a fine of fifty talents.  Miltiades was unable immediately to raise this sum and died soon  afterwards of his wound.  The fine was subsequently paid by his son  Cimon. The melancholy end of Miltiades must not blind us to his  offence. He had grossly abused the public confidence, and deserved his  punishment.  The Athenians did not forget his services at Marathon, and  it was their gratitude towards him which alone saved him from death.    Soon after the battle of Marathon a war broke out between Athens and  AEgina.  This war is of great importance in Grecian history, since to  it the Athenians were indebted for their navy, which enabled them to  save Greece at Salamis as they had already done at Marathon.  AEgina  was one of the chief maritime powers in Greece; and accordingly  Themistocles urged the Athenians to build and equip a large and  powerful fleet, without which it was impossible for them to humble  their rival.  There was at this time a large surplus in the public  treasury, arising from the produce of the silver-mines at Laurium.  It  had been recently proposed to distribute this surplus among the  Athenian citizens; but Themistocles persuaded them to sacrifice their  private advantage to the public good, and to appropriate the money to  building a fleet of 200 ships.    The two leading citizens of Athens at this period were Themistocles and  Aristides.  These two eminent men formed a striking contrast to each  other.  Themistocles possessed abilities of the most extraordinary  kind; but they were marred by a want of honesty.  Aristides was  inferior to Themistocles in ability, but was incomparably superior to  him in honesty and integrity.  His uprightness and justice were so  universally acknowledged that he received the surname of the \"Just.\"  Themistocles was the leader of the democratical, and Aristides of the  conservative party at Athens.  After three or four years of bitter  rivalry, the two chiefs appealed to the ostracism, and Aristides was  banished (B.C. 483).  We are told that an unlettered countryman gave  his vote against Aristides at the ostracism, because he was tired of  hearing him always called the Just.        CHAPTER VIII.    THE PERSIAN WARS.--THE BATTLES OF THERMOPYLAE, SALAMIS, AND PLATAEA,  B.C. 480-479.    The defeat of the Persians at Marathon served only to increase the  resentment of Darius.  He now resolved to collect the whole forces of  his empire, and to lead them in person against Athens. For three years  busy preparations were made throughout his vast dominions.  In the  fourth year his attention was distracted by a revolt of the Egyptians;  and before he could reduce them to subjection he was surprised by  death, after a reign of 37 years (B.C. 485).  Xerxes, the son and  successor of Darius, had received the education of an eastern despot,  and been surrounded with slaves from his cradle.  In person he was the  tallest and handsomest man amidst the vast hosts which he led against  Greece; but there was nothing in his mind to correspond to this fair  exterior.  His character was marked by faint-hearted timidity and  childish vanity.  Xerxes had not inherited his father's animosity  against Greece; but he was surrounded by men who urged him to continue  the enterprise.  Foremost among these was Mardonius, who was eager to  retrieve his reputation, and to obtain the conquered country as a  satrapy for himself after subduing Egypt (B.C. 484), Xerxes began to  make preparations for the invasion of Greece. For four years the din of  preparation sounded throughout Asia. Troops were collected from every  quarter of the Persian empire, and were ordered to assemble in  Cappadocia.  As many as forty-six different nations composed the  land-force, of various complexions, languages, dresses, and arms.  Meantime Xerxes ordered a bridge to be thrown across the Hellespont,  that his army might march from Asia into Europe:  and he likewise gave  directions that a canal should be cut through the isthmus of Mount  Athos, in order to avoid the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20967"],[0,"A Guide to Peterborough Cathedral (#13)"],[1,"at the west and east ends.    The distance from the inside of the west door of the cathedral to the  organ screen at the entrance into the choir is 267 feet.    From the organ screen to the altar screen, 117 feet.    From the altar table to the east window 38 feet. So that the distance  from the west door to the east window is 422 feet.    The length of the two cross aisles or transepts within, including the  diameter of the lantern, 180 feet.    The breadth of the nave within, measuring from the south wall to the  north wall, is 78 feet; that is half the breadth of the west front.    From the floor of the nave to its painted wooden roof is a height of 81  feet.    The height of the lantern within the church is 135 feet. The whole  height of it without is 150 feet.    The height of each gothic arch at the west front of the cathedral is 82  feet.    The distance from the ground to the top of each pinnacle at the corners  of the west front is 156 feet; that is, the same with the breadth of  the front.      The Interior of the Building    is grand beyond conception. The northern and southern aisles are formed  by massive ranges of pillars, supporting vast arches of singular  simplicity and beauty. The great pictured roof or ceiling in the nave  of the church, is a curious specimen of fanciful ingenuity. The  divisions are of a diagonal form filled with various devices, some  representing kings and queens or early patrons and founders of the  monastery: others being of an hieroglyphical character.    \"The nave and its aisles,\" says Mr. Britton, [page 70] \"display a  uniform style of architecture in their arches, piers, triforia, and  walls; but the windows of the clerestory, triforia, and aisles are all  of a later date, and are evident insertions in the original  walls,--excepting indeed the exterior walls of the triforium, which  appear to have been raised, and a new roof formed when some great  alterations were made to the church. On the eastern side of the  transept is an aisle, the southern division of which is separated into  three chapels, or oratories, as they were originally appropriated, but  now used as appendages to the choir. Over this aisle is a triforium,  behind an arched screen, which extends along the aisles of the choir to  their junction with the new work.\"    The lantern is another remarkable feature in this building. It \"is open  to the vaulted roof,\" and is a fearful height to contemplate.    The choir is nearly of the same kind of architecture as the transept.  Its vaulted roof is boarded, but assumes an imitation of the florid  pointed style,--being disposed in several compartments by thin ribs.  Over the altar end it is painted with an emblematical representation of  Christ as a vine, and his disciples the branches. The remaining portion  of the roof, which had been painted white and yellow, has also been  recently restored to its original character, the bosses being gilt and  the spandrils painted bright blue and richly ornamented.    Until the year 1827, the choir of this cathedral was composed of deal  painted to resemble oak, and \"although in good repair,\" was generally  allowed to be \"unworthy of the magnificent structure to which it  belonged.\" At the suggestion, and under the immediate patronage of the  then dean and chapter, a subscription was entered into for the purpose  of erecting a new choir and organ screen; and the sum of L5021 11s. 0d.  was shortly obtained towards that object. The architect employed was  the celebrated Mr. Blore, who, assisted by Mr. Ruddle, of Peterborough,  completed the work in 1830.    The organ screen is composed of clunch stone, and is decorated with  spiral turrets, having a number of gaudily painted shields in the  spandrils, which, together with the rainbow hues of the organ pipes,  give it an appearance rather offensive to modern taste, although  strictly in accordance with the rest of the work, which is in the style  of the 1st and 3rd Edward.    On the right of the entrance to the choir is a brass plate with the  following inscription:--                             THIS                       ORGAN SCREEN                         WITH THE                  CHOIR AND ALTAR SCREEN,                WAS ERECTED A.D. MDCCCXXX.                     BY SUBSCRIPTION       FROM THE MEMBERS OF THIS CATHEDRAL CHURCH,                 THE INHABITANTS OF THE         CITY AND NEIGHBOURHOOD OF PETERBOROUGH,                           AND      OTHER ADMIRERS OF ECCLESIASTICAL ARCHITECTURE,                  UNDER THE AUSPICES OF           THE VERY REV. JAMES HENRY MONK, D.D.,                           DEAN.      The New Pulpit,    Erected to the memory of the Rev. John James, D.D., for 40 years Canon  of the Cathedral, has a most massive appearance. The principal material  used in its construction is Dumfries stone, with pillars of Devonshire  and Greek marble. The body rests on a centre marble base, with corner  pillars of Greek marble. At each corner of the pulpit stand figures of  the four evangelists. The three panels are richly carved, and in the  centres are cut the figure of a lamb, a Norman cross, and the letters  I.H.S. Greek marble has been employed as pillars for the stair rails,  along which and around the upper part of the pulpit is Devonshire  marble. The following inscription inlaid with gold is cut in the Greek  marble bordering:--\"In Memoriam. Johannes James, S.T.P., hujus Ecclesiae  Cathedralis XL.; Anno Canonici P.C. Filii Superstites A.D. MDCCCLXXIII,  O.B. XV Dec. MDCCCLXVIII.\" The arms of the See and the Dean and Chapter  are cut in the stone body. The architect was Mr. Barry, of London, and  the work was executed by Messrs. Field, Poole, and Sons, Westminster.      Monuments.    There are very few ancient monuments remaining in this cathedral, the  greater portion having been destroyed by Cromwell's soldiers. A brazen  eagle, or lectern, in the centre aisle of the choir, from which the  daily lessons are read; an ancient stone at the east end of the  building, till lately supposed to be commemorative of the murder of  eighty-four monks by the Danes, in 870;[31] and a picture of old  Scarlet, who died in 1594, aged 98, are the principal objects of  interest.    Turning to the left, as you enter the west door of the cathedral, hangs  the portrait of this celebrated character, who buried within the walls  of the cathedral, Catherine of Arragon, who died at Kimbolton Castle,  in 1536; and Mary Queen of Scots, who was executed at Fotheringhay  Castle fifty-one years afterwards. The accompanying engraving is a  representation of the old sexton, with his spade, pickaxe, and other  emblems of office.    In the south-west or opposite corner of the nave, is an _ancient  font_, originally composed of native marble, obtained from the  quarries at Alwalton.[32] The basin of this font was, for many years, in  one of the prebendal gardens, where it was placed upon the base of an  old Norman pillar, and used for holding flowers, but was removed by Dr.  Monk, when dean of Peterborough, to the chapterhouse. The celebrated  statuary, Mr. Gresley, of Oxford, put it upon its present pediments,  which are composed of Purbeck marble, and it was then placed where it  now stands. It is considered a very fine piece of workmanship.

Dr. William Parker_, who died October 3rd,  1730.    Next, in a recess, is a tablet to abbot _Andreas_, and two of his  predecessors, with the following Latin inscription:--        \"Hos tres abbates quibus est prior abba Iohannes      Alter Martinus, Andreas ultimus unus      Hic claudit tumulus; pro clausis ergo rogemus.\"    The following is a free translation of the above:--        \"_These three abbots, of whom the first is abbot John,      The other Martin, the last Andrew,      This one tomb shuts up [incloses]; therefore for those shut up,          let us pray._\"    Above this is a small tablet to the memory of _Mary_, the wife of the  _Rev. Payne Edmunds_.    Next, is a marble tablet to _Robert Pemberton_, who was a magistrate of  this city, and steward to the Rev. the Dean and Chapter. He died in  1695, in the 75th year of his age.    Near these, removed from the old chapter-house, founded by king Peada,  are the statues of _three other abbots_, whose names are unknown.    Adjoining, is an effigy of _Abbot Alexander_, whose body, with his  boots and crosier, were found by some workmen when making a foundation  for the new choir in 1830, as related at page 15 of this work.    Opposite to this, is a black marble slab, beneath which the body of  _Mary, Queen of Scots_, was at first deposited, and remained for  twenty-five years, when it was disinterred and removed to Westminster  Abbey, by order of her son, king James the 1st. Hanging near it is the  original letter of the king ordering the removal. See note on page 29.    At the end of this aisle are two handsome compartments; the left hand,  to the memory of _Joseph Stamford_, who died in 1683; and the right  hand, to _Thomas Whitwell_, who died at Wisbech in 1759.    Above that of _Joseph Stamford_, is a tablet to _Francis Lockier_, who  died 1740; and below, a small tablet to _John Speechley_, for 33 years  organist of the cathedral.
