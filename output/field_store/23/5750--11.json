The couple  then dance backward between the lines to their starting point, then down  again, when they separate, the man taking his place in the rear of the  male line and the woman hers in the rear of the female line. This couple  starting down the second time, the man and woman immediately next in line  lock arms and pass down in the same manner, Hasjelti and Hostjoghon  scarcely waiting for the first couple to separate before dancing up to  meet the second couple; the remaining couples following in like order  until the first couple find themselves in their former position at the  head of the line. Now a group dance is indulged in for a minute or two  when lines are again formed, and a second figure exactly like the first is  danced. This figure was again repeated without variation, after which the  men and women fell into single file, and, led by Hasjelti and followed by  Hostjoghon, left the dancing ground. They did not go to the green,  however, but moved off a short distance to rest for a moment and returned.  Upon each return the invalid passed down the line on the north side  sprinkling each dancer with meal, Hasjelti and Hostjoghon performing with  the fawn skin and wands. This dance of four figures was repeated twelve  times, each time the dancers resting but a moment. After the twelve dances  the dancers passed to the green room, where they were relieved by a second  set of men. The second series of dances were exactly like the first. There  were twenty-one dances, four figures in each dance, and each time the  dancers appeared they were sprinkled with meal by the invalid, while  Hasjelti and Hostjoghon performed their antics with fawn skin and wands.  The third series embraced all the dances exactly like the above. The  fourth series embraced nineteen dances. The only variation in this was  that the leaders were often more clownish in their performances, and upon  several occasions only four men representing women appeared. In this case  two men danced together. Some of the dancers dropped out from weariness,  which caused diminution in some of the sets. The last dance closed at the  first light of day. The song-priest had preceded the last dancers to the  green room and awaited their arrival to obtain the masks, which were his  special property.            MYTHS OF THE NAVAJO.          CREATION OF THE SUN.      The first three worlds were neither good nor healthful. They moved all the  time and made the people dizzy. Upon ascending into this world the Navajo  found only darkness and they said \"We must have light.\"    In the Ute Mountain lived two women, Ahsonnutli, the turquoise  hermaphrodite, and Yolaikaiason, the white-shell woman. These two women  were sent for by the Navajo, who told them they wished light. The Navajo  had already partially separated light into its several colors. Next to the  floor was white indicating dawn, upon the white blue was spread for  morning, and on the blue yellow for sunset, and next was black  representing night. They had prayed long and continuously over these, but  their prayers had availed nothing. The two women on arriving told the  people to have patience and their prayers would eventually be answered.    Night had a familiar, who was always at his ear. This person said, \"Send  for the youth at the great falls.\" Night sent as his messenger a shooting  star. The youth soon appeared and said, \"Ahsonnutli, the ahstjeohltoi  (hermaphrodite), has white beads in her right breast and turquoise in her  left. We will tell her to lay them on darkness and see what she can do  with her prayers.\" This she did.(6) The youth from the great falls said to  Ahsonnutli, \"You have carried the white-shell beads and turquoise a long  time; you should know what to say.\" Then with a crystal dipped in pollen  she marked eyes and mouth on the turquoise and on the white-shell beads,  and forming a circle around these with the crystal she produced a slight  light from the white-shell bead and a greater light from the turquoise,  but the light was insufficient.    Twelve men lived at each of the cardinal points. The forty-eight men were  sent for. After their arrival Ahsonnutli sang a song, the men sitting  opposite to her; yet even with their presence the song failed to secure  the needed light. Two eagle plumes were placed upon each cheek of the  turquoise and two on the cheeks of the white-shell beads and one at each  of the cardinal points. The twelve men of the east placed twelve  turquoises at the east of the faces. The twelve men of the south placed  twelve white-shell beads at the south. The twelve men of the west placed  twelve turquoises at the west. Those of the north placed twelve  white-shell beads at that point. Then with the crystal dipped in corn  pollen they made a circle embracing the whole. The wish still remained  unrealized. Then Ahsonnutli held the crystal over the turquoise face,  whereupon it lighted into a blaze. The people retreated far back on  account of the great heat, which continued increasing. The men from the  four points found the heat so intense that they arose, but they could  hardly stand, as the heavens were so close to them. They looked up and saw  two rainbows, one across the other from east to west, and from north to  south. The heads and feet of the rainbows almost touched the men's heads.  The men tried to raise the great light, but each time they failed. Finally  a man and woman appeared, whence they knew not. The man's name was  Atseatsine and the woman's name was Atseatsan. They were asked \"How can  this sun be got up.\" They replied, \"We know; we heard the people down here  trying to raise it, and this is why we came.\" \"Chanteen\" (sun's rays),  exclaimed the man, \"I have the chanteen; I have a crystal from which I can  light the chanteen, and I have the rainbow; with these three I can raise  the sun.\" The people said, \"Go ahead and raise it.\" When he had elevated  the sun a short distance it tipped a little and burned vegetation and  scorched the people, for it was still too near. Then the people said to  Atseatsine and Atseatsan, \"Raise the sun higher,\" and they continued to  elevate it, and yet it continued to burn everything. They were then called  upon to \"lift it higher still, as high as possible,\" but after at certain  height was reached their power failed; it would go no farther.    The couple then made four poles, two of turquoise and two of white-shell  beads, and each was put under the sun, and with these poles the twelve men  at each of the cardinal points raised it. They could not get it high  enough to prevent the people and grass from burning. The people then said,  \"Let us stretch the world;\" so the twelve men at each point expanded the  world. The sun continued to rise as the world expanded, and began to shine  with less heat, but when it reached the meridian the heat became great and  the people suffered much. They crawled everywhere to find shade. Then the  voice of Darkness went four times around the world telling the men at the  cardinal points to go on expanding the world. \"I want all this trouble  stopped,\" said Darkness; \"the people are suffering and all is burning; you  must continue stretching.\" And the men blew and stretched, and after a  time they saw the sun rise beautifully, and when the sun again reached the  meridian it was only tropical. It was then just right, and as far as the  eye could reach the earth was encircled first with the white dawn of day,  then with the blue of early morning, and all things were perfect. And  Ahsonnutli commanded the twelve men to go to the east, south, west, and  north, to hold up the heavens (Yiyanitsinni, the holders up of the  heavens), which office they are supposed to perform to this day.          HASJELTI AND HOSTJOGHON.      Hasjelti and Hostjoghon were the children of Ahsonnutli, the turquoise,  and Yolaikaiason (white-shell woman, wife of the sun). Ahsonnutli placed  an ear of white corn and Yolaikaiason an ear of yellow corn on the  mountain where the fogs meet. The corn conceived, the white corn giving  birth to Hasjelti and the yellow corn to Hostjoghon. These two became the  great song-makers of the world. They gave to the mountain of their  nativity (Henry Mountain in Utah) two songs and two prayers; they then  went to Sierra Blanca (Colorado) and made two songs and prayers and  dressed the mountain in clothing of white shell with two eagle plumes  placed upright upon the head. From here they visited San Mateo Mountain  (New Mexico) and gave to it two songs and prayers, and dressed it in  turquoise, even to the leggings and moccasins, and placed two eagle plumes  on the head. Hence they went to San Francisco Mountain (Arizona) and made  two songs and prayers and dressed that mountain in abalone shells with two  eagle plumes upon the head. They then visited Ute Mountain and gave to it  two songs and prayers and dressed it in black beads. This mountain also  had two eagle plumes on its head. They then returned to the mountain of  their nativity to meditate, \"We two have made all these songs.\"    Upon inquiring of their mothers how they came into existence, and being  informed, they said, \"Well, let our number be increased; we can not get  along with only two of us.\" The woman placed more yellow and white corn on  the mountain and children were conceived as before. A sufficient number  were born so that two brothers were placed on each of the four mountains,  and to these genii of the mountains the clouds come first. All the  brothers consulted together as to what they should live upon and they  concluded to make game, and so all game was created.    Navajo prayers for rain and snow are addressed to Hasjelti and Hostjoghon."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19337"],[0,"A Christmas Carol (#13)"],[1,"drink his health. Here is a glass of mulled  wine ready to our hand at the moment; and I say, 'Uncle Scrooge!'\"    \"Well! Uncle Scrooge!\" they cried.    \"A merry Christmas and a happy New Year to the old man, whatever he is!\"  said Scrooge's nephew. \"He wouldn't take it from me, but may he have it  nevertheless. Uncle Scrooge!\"    Uncle Scrooge had imperceptibly become so gay and light of heart, that  he would have pledged the unconscious company in return, and thanked  them in an inaudible speech, if the Ghost had given him time. But the  whole scene passed off in the breath of the last word spoken by his  nephew; and he and the Spirit were again upon their travels.    Much they saw, and far they went, and many homes they visited, but  always with a happy end. The Spirit stood beside sick-beds, and they  were cheerful; on foreign lands, and they were close at home; by  struggling men, and they were patient in their greater hope; by poverty,  and it was rich. In almshouse, hospital, and gaol, in misery's every  refuge, where vain man in his little brief authority had not made fast  the door, and barred the Spirit out, he left his blessing, and taught  Scrooge his precepts.    It was a long night, if it were only a night; but Scrooge had his doubts  of this, because the Christmas holidays appeared to be condensed into  the space of time they passed together. It was strange, too, that, while  Scrooge remained unaltered in his outward form, the Ghost grew older,  clearly older. Scrooge had observed this change, but never spoke of it,  until they left a children's Twelfth-Night party, when, looking at the  Spirit as they stood together in an open place, he noticed that its hair  was grey.    \"Are spirits' lives so short?\" asked Scrooge.    \"My life upon this globe is very brief,\" replied the Ghost. \"It ends  to-night.\"    \"To-night!\" cried Scrooge.    \"To-night at midnight. Hark! The time is drawing near.\"    The chimes were ringing the three-quarters past eleven at that moment.    \"Forgive me if I am not justified in what I ask,\" said Scrooge, looking  intently at the Spirit's robe, \"but I see something strange, and not  belonging to yourself, protruding from your skirts. Is it a foot or a  claw?\"    \"It might be a claw, for the flesh there is upon it,\" was the Spirit's  sorrowful reply. \"Look here.\"    From the foldings of its robe it brought two children; wretched, abject,  frightful, hideous, miserable. They knelt down at its feet, and clung  upon the outside of its garment.    \"Oh, Man! look here! Look, look, down here!\" exclaimed the Ghost.    They were a boy and girl. Yellow, meagre, ragged, scowling, wolfish; but  prostrate, too, in their humility. Where graceful youth should have  filled their features out, and touched them with its freshest tints, a  stale and shrivelled hand, like that of age, had pinched, and twisted  them, and pulled them into shreds. Where angels might have sat  enthroned, devils lurked, and glared out menacing. No change, no  degradation, no perversion of humanity, in any grade, through all the  mysteries of wonderful creation, has monsters half so horrible and  dread.    Scrooge started back, appalled. Having them shown to him in this way, he  tried to say they were fine children, but the words choked themselves,  rather than be parties to a lie of such enormous magnitude.    \"Spirit! are they yours?\" Scrooge could say no more.    \"They are Man's,\" said the Spirit, looking down upon them. \"And they  cling to me, appealing from their fathers. This boy is Ignorance. This  girl is Want. Beware of them both, and all of their degree, but most of  all beware this boy, for on his brow I see that written which is Doom,  unless the writing be erased. Deny it!\" cried the Spirit, stretching out  its hand towards the city. \"Slander those who tell it ye! Admit it for  your factious purposes, and make it worse! And bide the end!\"    \"Have they no refuge or resource?\" cried Scrooge.    \"Are there no prisons?\" said the Spirit, turning on him for the last  time with his own words. \"Are there no workhouses?\"    The bell struck Twelve.    Scrooge looked about him for the Ghost, and saw it not. As the last  stroke ceased to vibrate, he remembered the prediction of old Jacob  Marley, and, lifting up his eyes, beheld a solemn Phantom, draped and  hooded, coming like a mist along the ground towards him.          STAVE FOUR    THE LAST OF THE SPIRITS      The Phantom slowly, gravely, silently approached. When it came near him,  Scrooge bent down upon his knee; for in the very air through which this  Spirit moved it seemed to scatter gloom and mystery.    It was shrouded in a deep black garment, which concealed its head, its  face, its form, and left nothing of it visible, save one outstretched  hand. But for this, it would have been difficult to detach its figure  from the night, and separate it from the darkness by which it was  surrounded.    He felt that it was tall and stately when it came beside him, and that  its mysterious presence filled him with a solemn dread. He knew no more,  for the Spirit neither spoke nor moved.    \"I am in the presence of the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come?\" said  Scrooge.    The Spirit answered not, but pointed onward with its hand.    \"You are about to show me shadows of the things that have not happened,  but will happen in the time before us,\" Scrooge pursued. \"Is that so,  Spirit?\"    The upper portion of the garment was contracted for an instant in its  folds, as if the Spirit had inclined its head. That was the only answer  he received.    Although well used to ghostly company by this time, Scrooge feared the  silent shape so much that his legs trembled beneath him, and he found  that he could hardly stand when he prepared to follow it. The Spirit  paused a moment, as observing his condition, and giving him time to  recover.    But Scrooge was all the worse for this. It thrilled him with a vague  uncertain horror to know that, behind the dusky shroud, there were  ghostly eyes intently fixed upon him, while he, though he stretched his  own to the utmost, could see nothing but a spectral hand and one great  heap of black.    \"Ghost of the Future!\" he exclaimed, \"I fear you more than any spectre I  have seen. But, as I know your purpose is to do me good, and as I hope  to live to be another man from what I was, I am prepared to bear you  company, and do it with a thankful heart. Will you not speak to me?\"    It gave him no reply. The hand was pointed straight before them.    \"Lead on!\" said Scrooge. \"Lead on! The night is waning fast, and it is  precious time to me, I know. Lead on, Spirit!\"    The phantom moved away as it had come towards him. Scrooge followed in  the shadow of its dress, which bore him up, he thought, and carried him  along.    They scarcely seemed to enter the City; for the City rather seemed to  spring up about them, and encompass them of its own act. But there they  were in the heart of it; on 'Change, amongst the merchants; who hurried  up and down, and chinked the money in their pockets, and conversed in  groups, and looked at their watches, and trifled thoughtfully with their  great gold seals; and so forth, as Scrooge had seen them often.    The Spirit stopped beside one little knot of business men. Observing  that the hand was pointed to them, Scrooge advanced to listen to their  talk.    \"No,\" said a great fat man with a monstrous chin, \"I don't know much  about it either way. I only know he's dead.\"    \"When did he die?\" inquired another.    \"Last night, I believe.\"    \"Why, what was the matter with him?\" asked a third, taking a vast  quantity of snuff out of a very large snuff-box. \"I thought he'd never  die.\"    \"God knows,\" said the first with a yawn.    \"What has he done with his money?\" asked a red-faced gentleman with a  pendulous excrescence on the end of his nose, that shook like the gills  of a turkey-cock.    \"I haven't heard,\" said the man with the large chin, yawning again.  \"Left it to his company, perhaps. He hasn't left it to _me_. That's all  I know.\"    This pleasantry was received with a general laugh.    \"It's likely to be a very cheap funeral,\" said the same speaker; \"for,  upon my life, I don't know of anybody to go to it. Suppose we make up a  party, and volunteer?\"    \"I don't mind going if a lunch is provided,\" observed the gentleman with  the excrescence on his nose. \"But I must be fed if I make one.\"    Another laugh.    \"Well, I am the most disinterested among you, after all,\" said the first  speaker, \"for I never wear black gloves, and I never eat lunch. But I'll  offer to go if anybody else will. When I come to think of it, I'm not at  all sure that I wasn't his most particular friend; for we used to stop  and speak whenever we met. Bye, bye!\"    Speakers and listeners strolled away, and mixed with other groups.  Scrooge knew the men, and looked towards the Spirit for an explanation.    The Phantom glided on into a street. Its finger pointed to two persons  meeting. Scrooge listened again, thinking that the explanation might lie  here.    He knew these men, also, perfectly. They were men of business: very  wealthy, and of great importance. He had made a point always of standing  well in their esteem: in a business point of view, that is; strictly in  a business point of view.    \"How are you?\" said one.    \"How are you?\" returned the other.    \"Well!\" said the first. \"Old Scratch has got his own at last, hey?\"    \"So I am told,\" returned the second. \"Cold, isn't it?\"    \"Seasonable for Christmas-time. You are not a skater, I suppose?\"    \"No. No. Something else to think of. Good morning!\"    Not another word. That was their meeting, their conversation, and their  parting.    Scrooge was at first inclined to be surprised that the Spirit should  attach importance to conversations apparently so trivial; but, feeling  assured that they must have some hidden purpose, he set himself to  consider what it was likely "]]]
