If the question is a real sensible  one, he'll give you a nice little answer--one about twelve hundred  words long.\"    \"Hurrah! Spouter is discovered at last!\" cried Fatty. \"Twelve hundred  words long just fits it--that is, if Spouter is in a hurry to cut it  short.\"    The Rover boys were much interested in what was taking place in the  gymnasium, and they even tried out some of the bars and swinging rings,  as well as one of the exercising machines.    \"This is certainly an up-to-date institution,\" remarked Jack. \"This gym  couldn't be better.\"    \"How about the boats?\" questioned Randy. He and his brother had owned a  rowboat on the Hudson River, and had often gone out in the craft.    \"Oh, we've got half a dozen good rowboats, as well as several racing  shells,\" answered Spouter. \"You'll probably get a chance to look them  over later.\"    While the Rover boys were taking in the sights to be seen in and around  the gymnasium, their attention was attracted to a tall, well-formed  cadet who was doing some clever work on one of the bars.    \"He's doing that almost as well as a circus performer,\" was Fred's  comment.    \"Yes; he's certainly very graceful,\" returned Jack. \"I wonder who he  is.\"    \"That is Walt Baxter,\" announced a cadet who had heard the talk.    \"Walt Baxter!\" exclaimed Randy. \"I wonder if he can be the son of Dan  Baxter, the man who made so much trouble for our fathers while at  Putnam Hall.\"    \"I'll soon find out,\" returned Jack. \"But please remember--Dan Baxter  reformed, and more than likely his son is a first-rate fellow.\"    As soon as Walter Baxter had gotten through with his exercise and had  dropped to the floor, Jack, followed by his cousins, went up to him.    \"Are you Walt Baxter--the son of Mr. Daniel Baxter?\" he questioned.    \"Yes,\" returned the other, and looked at Jack and the others with him  curiously.    \"I am Jack Rover--the son of Mr. Richard Rover. These are my cousins,\"  and Jack introduced them.    \"Oh! is that so?\" answered Walt Baxter, and shook hands rather  doubtfully. \"I--I--am glad to know you,\" he stammered.    \"And we are real glad to know you, Baxter,\" answered Randy, readily.  \"We heard you were at this school. We hope that we'll all be good  friends.\"    \"If we are not, it won't be my fault,\" and now there was a ring of  relief in Walter Baxter's voice. He lowered his tone a trifle. \"I know  your fathers did a lot for my father, and I am very thankful for it. If  I can do anything for you fellows here, I'll certainly do it.\"    \"And we'll do what we can for you, Baxter,\" answered Jack, quickly.    After that the talk became general, and Walt Baxter told much about  himself and the doings of the cadets at Colby Hall. When Nappy  Martell's name was mentioned, he drew down the corners of his mouth.    \"I never had any use for that chap,\" he declared. \"Once or twice my hot  temper got the better of me and we came pretty near having a fight. But  after that Martell gave me a wide berth.\"    \"I think I've got Martell to thank for something that is missing,\" said  Fred, and thereupon related the particulars regarding the lost  suitcase.    \"Say! I think I know something about that!\" cried Walter Baxter,  quickly. \"Yes, I'm sure I do!\"    \"Did you see Martell take the suitcase?\" demanded the youngest Rover,  quickly.    \"I can't say as to that, exactly. But I did see Martell sneaking off  through the backyard, past the stable, with something under his arm--a  big package wrapped up in a couple of newspapers.\"    \"When was this?\" questioned Jack, quickly.    \"About four o'clock this afternoon.\"    \"Just after we arrived at the Hall!\" burst out Randy.    \"What did he do with what package?\" asked Jack.    \"I don't know exactly, excepting that he went down past the stable on  to the roadway that leads to the farm fields.\"    \"Maybe he took the suitcase and threw it down in one of the fields,\"  ventured Andy.    \"You didn't see him come back?\" asked Fred.    \"Yes, come to think of it, I did--about a quarter of an hour after  that,\" answered Walt Baxter.    \"And did he have the package then?\"    \"No.\"    \"Then I'll wager it was the suitcase and he left it somewhere down on  the farm!\" cried Randy. \"Let us go and take a look. We are permitted to  go out in the farm fields, aren't we?\" he asked of Walt.    \"Oh, yes. You can go anywhere you please during off hours so long as  you don't go out of bounds,\" was the reply. \"If you want to go out of  bounds, you have to report at the office and get permission.\"    The matter was talked over for a few minutes more, and Walt Baxter said  he would gladly go along with the Rovers to show them just where he had  seen Nappy Martell with the bundle. The five boys were soon in the  neighborhood of the Hall stable, and then they passed beyond this to a  roadway which ran between the fields attached to the school farm.    \"It's a pity it's so dark,\" declared Jack. \"I doubt if we'll be able to  locate that suitcase even if we get quite close to it.\"    \"I'll tell you what I'll do,\" declared Randy. \"I'll run back to my room  and get my pocket flashlight. That will be just the thing.\"    It took him but a few minutes to obtain the article he had mentioned,  and with the flashlight to guide them, the five boys started along the  roadway behind the school. The light was flashed first on one side and  then on the other.    \"Looks like a wild goose chase,\" declared Andy, after they had passed  two farm fields. \"I don't think he would come this far with that heavy  suitcase.\"    \"Here is a cornfield full of stacks,\" said Walt Baxter. \"The stacks  would afford a dandy hiding place for almost anything.\"    They approached the first of the stacks, and Fred kicked some of the  corn stalks aside, but without result. Then they passed on to the next  stack.    \"Hello! here is something!\" exclaimed Jack, as the rays of the  flashlight fell upon the object. \"Fred, I guess we've found it all  right enough.\"    \"So we have!\" cried the youngest Rover; and in a moment more he thrust  his hand in between the cornstalks and pulled out the missing suitcase.          CHAPTER XI    DOWN IN THE CORNFIELD      The other boys gathered around in curiosity as Fred brought forth from  the stack of cornstalks his missing suitcase. Beside the bag were  several newspapers crumpled up into a wad.    \"Those must be the newspapers he had the suitcase wrapped in,\" remarked  Walt Baxter.    \"More than likely,\" answered Jack. He picked up the wad of papers and  glanced at them. \"New York newspapers, too,\" he cried. \"Nappy must have  brought them with him from home.\"    \"Was the suitcase locked, Fred?\" questioned Randy.    \"No. I didn't bother to lock it, because, you see, I had it with me. I  only lock a suitcase when I check it.\"    \"Then you'd better take a look inside and see if your duds are all  right,\" advised Andy.    The youngest Rover quickly unstrapped the suitcase and threw back the  catch. Then, as Randy sent the rays of the flashlight into the bag, he,  as well as the others, uttered various exclamations.    \"The mean fellow!\"    \"Fred, you ought to get after him for this!\"    For a quick look inside the suitcase had revealed the fact that Nappy  Martell had opened the bag and thrown handfuls of dirt amid the pieces  of clothing and the various other articles Fred had packed therein.    \"You'll have to have all that laundered stuff done over again before  you can wear it,\" declared Jack. \"And you'll have to have those  neckties cleaned, too, I am afraid. Say! this is a shame!\"    \"Just wait! I think I'll be able to get square with Nappy Martell,\"  muttered the youngest Rover.    \"He ought to be reported for this,\" broke in Walt Baxter. \"This isn't a  joke. It's a low-down, dirty trick.\"    At this remark all of the other Rover boys looked at Fred, and he  looked at his cousins in return.    \"I don't know about reporting this,\" he answered slowly. \"I rather  think I prefer to settle with Martell myself.\"    \"That's the talk!\" cried Andy. \"If you reported this, some of the  fellows might put you down for a softy and a sneak. I'd rather watch my  chance and give Martell as good as he sent.\"    \"And with interest,\" added his twin.    \"If you fellows are anything like your fathers were before you, I  reckon you'll know how to get square with Nappy,\" remarked Walt Baxter.  \"I've heard that the Rovers never took a back seat for anybody.\"    \"I'll figure out what I'm going to do after I get settled here,\"  returned Fred. He suddenly began to smile. \"Say! things have been  happening since we left home, haven't they?\"    \"I should say yes!\" answered Andy.    With Jack assisting his cousin in carrying the suitcase, the whole  crowd returned to Colby Hall, and here the Rovers started to separate  from Walt Baxter, first requesting him to remain silent regarding the  finding of the handbaggage.    \"If we don't say a word about it, maybe Nappy will get worried,\" said  Fred; \"and that is what I want him to do.\"    \"He may go down to the cornfield to see if the bag is still there.\"    \"Hold on!\" burst out Randy, suddenly. \"I've got an idea!\" and then in a  few words he explained what had occurred to him. The others listened  with interest, and even Walt Baxter had to laugh outright over what he  proposed.    \"I'll do it!\" declared the son of Dan Baxter, readily. \"I'll do it the  first chance I get. And, believe me, I'll fix it so Nappy Martell gets  into hot water!\"    \"I'd like to see what effect the story has on"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21899"],[0,"A Rip Van Winkle Of The Kalahari (#13)"],[1,"e. Hastily slipping it off I held the  bag in my right hand, and clutching my only handhold with the left, I  attempted to throw the loop over the sharp point above me. Again and  again I missed, and it was in an agony of despair, when, at last, it  fell clear over the point and held. I hauled at it with all the  strength of my free arm and it held firm. But would it hold my weight?  This I could not test, but I must perforce stake all upon the chance,  for there was no other chance. Should a strand of the canvas give, down  I must go hurtling to my death. There was no other way, and with an  inarticulate prayer I gripped the strap fast with my other hand and  swung myself upwards. A second later although in my agony it seemed an  eternity and my hand clutched the pinnacle itself; a wild convulsive  scramble and I was up safe . . . and free . . at last! And even as I  dragged myself into freedom, the haversack, loosened from its hold,  fell with all its precious contents into the black depths below!        CHAPTER VII        THE COUNTRY OF CRATERS, THE PATH OF SKULLS, AND THE SNAKE         Filled, as I could but be, with thankfulness at my escape from  captivity and from an awful death, I did not realize for a time what  the loss of the diamonds meant to me; indeed I was too exhausted by my  terrific struggle to do more than crawl a few yards away from the  brink, throw myself down in the sand and sink into the sleep of utter  weariness.    But with my awakening the bitter truth was borne upon me in a flash.  All my struggle had then been in vain. I had won my freedom but had  lost all that would make life bearable. Even if I could win back  through the desert, what had I now to compensate me for the horrible  disfigurement that would make me shunned and despised a leper amongst  my fellowmen?    Bitterly did I regret my pleasant prison down below surely it would  have been better to stay there in peace till I died, as fate had  apparently decreed; and if I could have done so I would certainly have  returned. But to return was impossible, and I must make up my mind to  struggle through the desert or die where I was. Moreover, in the midst  of my bitter reflections there came the comforting recollection that I  had still the blue diamonds that I had kept apart and put in my pocket.  Eagerly I felt for them yes! they were safe, and in themselves they  must be worth a fortune!    My spirits rose with a bound again; why should I dream of giving in? I  was strong and hard, and if I could win through, the diamonds would  surely enable me to fit out an expedition and return; and with ropes  the descent into the crater would be easy.    Rested by the cool of the night I felt little the worse for my climb,  and was all eagerness for dawn to break that I might see what manner of  country I was in, for I had been half demented when my terrible ride  from the pursuing sandstorm had brought me into it.    At last daylight came, and I saw that although in the midst of a wide  sandy plain, there were no dunes; scattered bushes grew here and there,  and dotted about in the distance were a number of bare granite rocks.  The crater I had climbed from went sheer down at my feet so abruptly  indeed, and with so little to denote its presence, that within a few  yards of its brink nothing whatever could be seen of it.    I looked once more into its depths, to where the pool lay dark in the  still dim light of dawn, and from it my eyes followed the course that I  had taken in my climb, and I marveled that I had ever reached the top.  And a great thankfulness rose in my heart and drowned the unworthy  regret that I had felt at the loss of the diamonds.    And with a last long look at my late prison, I turned and made my way  towards a prominent pile of rocks in the distance, from which I hoped  to be able to see more of my surroundings. My waterbottle was nearly  empty already, and the old haunting dread of thirst was beginning to  fill my mind, but soon this fear left me, for within a mile I found  t'samma flourishing, and at the first pile of rocks a little spring of  water.    Cheered and encouraged I made good progress in spite of the now blazing  sun, and soon I reached the pile of rocks. And to my astonishment I  found that they formed part of the margin of a crater almost identical  with the one from which I had escaped; deep and inaccessible, and with  a mass of vegetation filling the bottom.    This discovery gave me food for thought. It had never entered my head  that the queer place of my imprisonment had been one of many, and I had  thought that once I could reach even a friendly native tribe where some  kind of rope was obtainable I could locate the crater again and secure  the bag of diamonds. But I had already stumbled upon another crater,  and maybe there were many? And this indeed I found to be the case, for  they became more numerous as I proceeded, until the whole country was  pitted with them. They were of all sizes and depths, some mere pits of  fifty feet in diameter or less, some huge gulfs a mile or more across,  and so deep that it was difficult to distinguish what was at the  bottom. Invariably their walls were sheer and I could explore none of  them, but in nearly all I saw the gleam of water.    So numerous were they, as I penetrated farther into this strange  country, that I was forced to make wide detours in my endeavor to avoid  them, and so bewildering did this labyrinth of huge pits at last become  that I became hopelessly lost among them, and at times thought that I  should never break clear of them again. Day after day I wandered about  this vast and apparently level plain, finding every short distance a  huge yawning gulf at my feet, forced to try new routes, and constantly  being pulled up by similar obstacles. And all this time I saw no sign  of life, not even a spoor in the sand to show that mankind had ever  trod there. There was no animal life even; a few birds, and a few  snakes, nothing more indeed so deserted and dead was this weird land  that it appeared unreal, and often I imagined that by some strange  chance I had been transported to some other and long-dead planet, so  little was this maze of craters like Mother Earth.    I had food and water enough, and as the moon now gave plenty of light I  walked only at night, resting in the shadow of the rocks by day.    One night I had made better progress than usual, having walked for some  hours without having to deviate from my path, and was beginning to hope  that I had escaped from the labyrinth, when suddenly, at my very feet,  there yawned the usual abyss, but this time so huge that I could scarce  make out the farther cliffs, though the moon was full and it was almost  as light as day. It would mean a long and weary detour, and my heart  sank as I thought of it; then leapt as it had not leapt since the day I  found the diamond by the pool in the crater. For there in the misty  depths, far away towards the farther cliffs, twinkled a fire!    A fire! Yes; and I had seen no fire except of my own kindling since the  night that Inyati had died . . . months months surely it must have been  years ago? . . .    Here at last must be human beings: savages maybe, but still flesh and  blood like myself; and if they were in the crater there must be a way  down.    That night I walked as I had never walked before, following the brink  of the chasm, and scarcely taking my eyes from the tiny flame that  meant so much to me. A way out, a way back to civilization, to life  among beings like myself, all this it would mean to me, even if I found  but savages by the fire for they could put me in the right path . . .  and it never occurred to me to fear them.    Now as the broad moon rose higher I could see into the crater's depths,  and this, besides being more vast, was not as the others I had seen.  Its floor appeared to be quite level, and looked to be of pure white  sand; but everywhere it sparkled in the bright moonlight. Diamonds  surely?    I was near the fire now, though far above it, and now I could see there  was a path, a broad white path, down a steep slope, it must be broad to  show so plainly, for I was still a mile or more away!    In my eagerness I forgot my fatigue, and hastened panting towards this  first blessed sign of man's handiwork that I had seen for so long.    Here it was at last; a broad white road, running straight as an arrow  away across the sands in the one direction and leading down into the  pit on the other a road paved apparently with round white stones all of  one size.    Something in their appearance struck me: a loose one lay beside the  path, and I stooped to examine it.    It was a skull a human skull, the whole road was paved with them as far  as the eye could reach, there were thousands upon thousands myriads of  them.    And as I realized what they were, fear seized me, and I turned away  from this terrible pathway.    At last I threw myself down in the black shadow of some rocks, still  trembling and agitated, and tried to compose myself to think. What  manner of men were these I had found at last, and who watched there  below by the fire: what race was this that thus made grim mockery of  their dead?    At length I overcame my fears sufficiently to return not to the path  but to the edge of the crater at some distance from it, and peering  down could see that the fire was still burning, and here, hiding as  best I could, I waited till morning. Daylight showed me no sign of life  however, though still the pale flame flickered, and I could now make  out that it burnt before a sort of building which seemed to be of white  polished stone. Till well after broad daylight I lay and watched, but  nothing stirred; and I determined that I would go down and see what  manner of fire was this that burnt day and night without tending.    The skulls did not look as ghastly in sunlight as they had done in the  pale light of"]]]
