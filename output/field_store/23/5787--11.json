Of other evidence, there is not one jot  or tittle. No attempt has been made to prove that the prisoner was  in the habit of consorting with bad characters; no attempt has been  made to show any connection, whatever, between him and the men who  came in a horse and trap across the hills, for the purpose of  effecting a burglary at Mr. Ellison's; and who, as we know, did  effect it. No scrap of the property stolen from the house has been  found upon him and, in order to account for the severe wound on his  head, the counsel for the prosecution has started the hypothesis  that it was given in the course of a quarrel, during the division  of the plunder.    \"But had that been the case, gentlemen, the prisoner would not have  been standing here alone. Robbed and ill-treated by these  companions of his, he would naturally have put the officers of  justice on their track and, as he must have been in communication  with them, and well acquainted with their ways and haunts, he could  have given information which would have led to their early arrest.  He could well have done this, for the crown would have made no  difficulty, whatever, in promising a lad like this a free pardon,  on condition of his turning evidence against these burglars; whose  mode of procedure shows them to have been old hands, and who are,  no doubt, the same who have committed the various robberies which  have lately taken place in this part of the country.    \"The prisoner is the son of highly respectable parents. His  employer will come before you, and give you evidence of the  extremely high character he bears. Mr. Shrewsbury will tell you  that he has, for the last four years, devoted no inconsiderable  portion of his leisure time to improve his education, and enable  him to recover the position occupied by his father, who was a  much-respected miller in this neighbourhood. I shall leave the case  in your hands, gentlemen, with an absolute confidence that you  will, without a moment's hesitation, find a verdict proclaiming the  innocence of my client; and enable him to leave the dock, without a  stain upon his character.\"        Chapter 5: Not Guilty!      The schoolmaster was the first witness called for the defence.  After stating that, although no evening was actually settled for  his coming over, he expected the prisoner one evening that week;  and that he had promised to bring his tools over, to do a little  job of carpentering; he also detailed his visit to the lane, and  the result of his observation there; and then gave Reuben the  highest character, saying that he had known him for five years, and  that he had an absolute confidence in his integrity and honesty.    \"He has from the first,\" he said, \"proved a most intelligent and  hard-working boy, anxious to improve himself and to get on in the  world. He has learnt all that I could teach him, and more. He is  one of the last persons in the world whom I should consider capable  of the crime with which he is charged. As to his having any  animosity to Mr. Ellison, I can swear that, on many different  occasions, he has expressed his high opinion of him; and has  declared that it was quite natural that, with the evidence before  him, he should have thought him guilty of poisoning the dog.\"    The keeper of the wayside public house, where he had breakfasted,  proved that he was struck with the prisoner's appearance when he  entered; that he was very pale, and seemed scarcely able to walk.  He had asked him the nearest way to Lewes, and had inquired whether  there was any chance of getting a lift; as he was anxious to get  back, as soon as possible.    Mr. Penfold was the next witness. He said that the prisoner had  been apprenticed to him, four years previously; that his general  conduct had been most excellent, and that he was remarkably quick  and intelligent, and was an excellent workman. During the time that  he had been employed, he had never lost a day.    \"At the time he was apprenticed to you, Mr. Penfold,\" Reuben's  counsel asked, \"were you aware that the lad had been summarily  discharged by Mr. Ellison?\"    \"I was aware of that fact,\" Mr. Penfold answered; and Reuben, with  surprise, looked at his employer.    \"From whom did you hear of it?\"    \"I heard of it from Mr. Ellison himself, who called upon me about  the matter.\"    \"How was it he came to call upon you, Mr. Penfold?\"    \"The prisoner's mother had applied to me about apprenticing her  son. I had asked 50 pounds premium, and said that it wasn't my  custom to pay any wages for the first year. She said she could only  afford 20 pounds, and I thought that was an end of the matter until, a  few days later, Mr. Ellison called upon me, and said that he had  heard from the schoolmaster in his village, who was a friend of the  boy's mother, how matters stood; and that her application had  fallen through, owing to her being unable to find more than 20  pounds.    \"I said that this was so. Mr. Ellison then said that he was  prepared to make up the deficiency, that he had a regard for the  boy's father; and that, moreover, he himself had, through a hasty  misconception regarding the poisoning of the dog, discharged the  lad from his service; and that he felt uneasy, in his mind, at  having been guilty of a piece of injustice. Over and above the 30  pounds, he gave me six pound ten; in order that I might pay the boy  half a crown a week, for the first year, which he said would be a  matter of consequence to his mother. He requested me on no account  to let Mrs. Whitney know that he had intervened in the matter, but  to represent that I changed my mind, and was willing to take the 20  pounds she offered as a premium. He was particularly anxious on  this point; because, he said, she would certainly refuse to accept  assistance from him, owing to that unfortunate affair about the  dog.    \"I may say that, from that time to this, I have not mentioned the  fact to anyone; and the sum of 20 pounds was inserted in the  indenture of apprenticeship.\"    There was a little movement of applause in the court, as Mr.  Penfold gave his evidence; and Reuben looked gratefully towards Mr.  Ellison, and said heartily:    \"I thank you, sir, with all my heart.\"    The foreman of the yard was next examined. He confirmed the high  character Mr. Penfold had given Reuben, and adding that he knew the  lad never entered a public house, but spent his evenings almost  entirely at home studying; for that he himself had, many times,  called in and had, upon every occasion, found him so employed.    The counsel for the prosecution then addressed the jury, and threw  discredit upon Reuben's narrative; which, he said, was unsupported  in any material particular. That he met the rest of the party in  the lane was likely enough. He may have returned there with them  after the burglary, and probably it was there that, in a quarrel  over the spoil, he received the blow of which you have heard.    \"My learned friend has told you to dismiss from your mind the  question about that poisoning of the dog, four years ago; but it is  impossible for you to do so. You have heard that the dog was  poisoned, and that the evidence was so strong that his employer at  once dismissed him. It is true that Mr. Ellison has told you that  he afterwards changed his mind on the subject; but after the  evidence which Mr. Penfold has given, of the kindness of that  gentleman's heart, you will readily understand that no great stress  can be laid upon this. The matter, so far from being trivial, as my  friend represents it, is highly important; inasmuch as here we find  that, again, the dogs have been poisoned just as on the first  occasion. It is clear that burglars from London would be ignorant  of the whereabouts of the kennels, and were not likely to have come  down provided with a store of poisoned meat; had they not known,  from persons well acquainted with the place, of the steps that  would have to be taken before an entry could be effected into the  house. You will therefore see the extreme importance of this point.    \"I am perfectly ready to admit that the evidence is of a wholly  circumstantial nature but, from the nature of the case, it is  necessary that this should be so. Had Mrs. or Mr. Ellison awoke,  when the thieves entered their room, it is probable that much more  evidence would be forthcoming. It is, however, for you to weigh the  probabilities of the case. You have to consider whether the theory  which I have laid before you, as to the connection of the prisoner  with this affair, or this wild story which he tells you, is the  most probable.\"    The judge then summed up, with a strong bias against Reuben. He  told them that evidence for character was, of course, of  importance; but that it must not be relied upon too far. The  prisoner appeared undoubtedly to be intelligent and well-conducted,  but unfortunately his experience told him that many criminals were  men of unusual intelligence. Stress had been laid, by the counsel  for the defence, upon the fact that the prisoner was not known, at  any time, to have consorted with suspicious characters; but this,  after all, was only negative evidence. Affairs of this sort were  always conducted with secrecy and, had one of these men come down  from London, as was probable enough, to make inquiries as to houses  which could be broken into with a prospect of good booty, he would  naturally not make himself conspicuous.    They had heard the two stories, and must judge for themselves; but  he agreed, with the counsel for the prosecution, that the fact that  the prisoner had been discharged by Mr. Ellison for poisoning a  dog,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20034"],[0,"Scottish Ghost Stories (#13)"],[1,"decided me.  I took a few preliminary sips of whisky, stretched my rusty limbs,  and, placing one foot in a jagged crevice of the wall, swarmed  painfully up. How slow and how hazardous was the process! I scratched  my fingers, inured to the pen but a stranger to any rougher substance;  I ruined my box-calf boots, I split my trousers at the knees, and I  felt that my hat had parted with its shape for ever; and yet I  continued the ascent. The end came all too suddenly. When within an  ace of victory, I yielded to impulse, and with an energy the desperate  condition of my skin and clothes alone could account for, I swung up,  and--the outer edge of the wall melted beneath me, my hands  frantically clutched at nothingness, a hideous sensation of falling  surged through my brain, my ears and eyes filled to bursting, and with  a terrific crash that seemed to drive my head and spine right through  my stomach, I met the black, uprising earth, and lost consciousness.    Providentially for me, I had pitched head first into a furze bush  which broke the fall, otherwise I must have met with serious injury.  As it was, when I recovered my momentary loss of consciousness, I  found that I had sustained no worse harm than a severe shaking,  scratches galore, and the utter demolition of my clothes! I picked  myself up with difficulty, and spent some time searching for my hat  and stick--which I at length discovered, lodged, of course, where one  would least have thought of looking for them. I then took close stock  of my surroundings, and found them even grimmer than I had  anticipated. Though the trees were packed closely together, and there  was much undergrowth, the moonbeams were so powerful and so fully  concentrated on the spinney, that I could see no inconsiderable  distance ahead of me. Over everything hung a solemn and preternatural  hush. I saw shadows everywhere--shadows that defied analysis and had  no material counterparts. A sudden crashing of brushwood brought me to  a standstill, and sent the blood in columns to my heart. Then I  laughed loudly--it was only a hare, the prettiest and pertest thing  imaginable. I went on. Something whizzed past my face. I drew back in  horror--it was a bat, merely a bat. My nerves were out of order, the  fall had unsteadied them; I must pull myself together. I did so, and  continued to advance. A shadow, long, narrow, and grotesque, fell  across my path, and sent a thousand and one icy shivers down my back.  In an agony of terror I shut my eyes and plunged madly on. Something  struck me in the face and hurled me back. My eyes opened  involuntarily, and I saw a tree that, either out of pique or sheer  obstinacy, had planted itself half-way across the path. I examined its  branches to make sure they _were_ branches, and continued my march. A  score more paces, a sudden bend, and I was in an open space,  brilliantly illuminated by moonbeams and peopled with countless,  moving shadows. One would have to go far to find a wilder, weirder,  and more grimly suggestive spot. As I stood gazing at the scene in  awestruck wonder, a slight breeze rocked the tops of the pine trees,  and moaning through their long and gloomy aisles reverberated like  thunder. The sounds, suggesting slightly, ever so slightly, a tattoo,  brought with them vivid pictures of the Drummer, too vivid just then  to be pleasant, and I turned to go. To my unmitigated horror, a white  and lurid object barred my way. My heart ceased to beat, my blood  turned to ice; I was sick, absolutely sick, with terror. Besides this,  the figure held me spellbound--I could neither move nor utter a sound.  It had a white, absolutely white face, a tall, thin, perpendicular  frame, and a small, glittering, rotund head. For some seconds it  remained stationary, and then, with a gliding motion, left the path  and vanished in the shadows.    Again a breeze rustled through the tops of the pine trees, moaned  through their long and gloomy aisles, and reverberated like thunder;  rat-tat, tat, rat-tat, tat--and with this sound beating in my ears,  reaction set in, and I never ceased running till I had reached my  hotel.                                   CASE IX        THE ROOM BEYOND. AN ACCOUNT OF THE HAUNTINGS        AT HENNERSLEY, NEAR AYR      To me Hennersley is what the Transformation Scene at a Pantomime was  to the imaginative child--the dreamy child of long ago--a floral  paradise full of the most delightful surprises. Here, at Hennersley,  from out the quite recently ice-bound earth, softened and moistened  now by spring rain, there rises up row upon row of snowdrops,  hyacinths and lilies, of such surpassing sweetness and beauty that I  hold my breath in astonishment, and ecstatically chant a Te Deum to  the fairies for sending such white-clad loveliness.    And then--then, ere my wonder has had time to fade, it is summer. The  ground opens, and there springs up, on all sides, a veritable sea of  vivid, variegated colour,--scarlet, pink, and white geraniums; red,  white and yellow roses; golden honeysuckle; bright-hued marigolds;  purple pansies; pale forget-me-nots; wallflowers; sweet peas;  many-tinted azaleas; showy hydrangeas; giant rhododendrons; foxgloves,  buttercups, daisies, hollyhocks, and heliotropes; a floral host too  varied to enumerate.    Overcome with admiration, bewildered with happiness, I kneel on the  soft carpet of grass, and, burying my face extravagantly, in alternate  laps of luxurious, downy, scent-laden petals, fill my lungs with  soul-inspiring nectar.    My intoxication has barely worn off before my eyes are dimly conscious  that the soil all around me is generously besprinkled with the remains  of my floral friends. I spring hurriedly to my feet, and, gazing  anxiously about me, suddenly perceive the gaily nodding heads of new  arrivals--dahlias, sunflowers, anemones, chrysanthemums. As I continue  gazing, the aromatic odour of mellow apples from the Hennersley  orchards reaches my nostrils; I turn round, and there, there in front  of me, I see row upon row of richly-laden fruit trees, their leaves a  brilliant copper in the scintillating rays of the ruddy autumn sun. I  gasp for breath--the beauty of tint and tone surpasses all that I have  hitherto seen--it is sublime, the grand climax of transformation. As  the curtain falls with the approach of winter, I hurry to my Edinburgh  home and pray for the prompt return of early spring.    For many years my aged relatives, the Misses Amelia and Deborah  Harbordeens, lived at Hennersley. Rarest and kindest of old ladies,  they were the human prototypes of the flowers both they and I loved.  Miss Amelia, with her beautiful complexion, rounded form and regal  mien, suggested to my childish mind more, much more, than the mere  semblance of a rose, whilst Miss Deborah, with her sprightly grace and  golden hair, was only masquerading as a woman--she was in reality a  daffodil.    Unlike so many of the fair sex who go in for gardening, my aunts were  essentially dainty. Their figures were shapely and elegant, their  hands slim and soft. I never saw them working without gloves, and I  have good reason to believe they anointed their fingers every night  with a special preparation to keep them smooth and white. They were  not--decidedly not--\"brainy,\" neither were they accomplished, never  having made any special study of the higher arts; but they evinced  nevertheless the keenest appreciation of painting, music, and  literature. Their library--a large one--boasted a delightful  harbourage of such writers as Jane Austen, Miss Mitford, and Maria  Edgeworth. And in their drawing-room, on the walls of which art was  represented by the old as well as modern masters, might be seen and  sometimes heard--for the Misses Harbordeens often entertained--a  well-tuned Broadwood, and a Bucksen harpsichord. I will describe this  old-world abode, not as I first saw it, for when I first visited my  aunts Amelia and Deborah, I was only one year old, but as I first  remember it--a house with the glamour of a many-gabled roof and  diamond window-panes.    The house stood by the side of the turnpike road--that broad, white,  interminable road, originating from goodness knows where in the north,  and passing through Ayr--the nearest town of any importance--to  goodness knows where in the south. A shady avenue, entered by a wooden  swing gate bearing the superscription \"Hennersley\" in neat, white  letters, led by a circuitous route to it, and not a vestige of it  could be seen from the road. In front of it stretched a spacious lawn,  flanked on either side and at the farthest extremity by a thick growth  of chestnuts, beeches, poplars, and evergreens.    The house itself was curiously built. It consisted of two storeys, and  formed a main building and one wing, which gave it a peculiarly  lop-sided appearance that reminded me somewhat ludicrously of  Chanticleer, with a solitary, scant, and clipped appendage.    It was often on the tip of my tongue to ask my relatives the reason of  this singular disparity; whether it was the result of a mere whim on  the part of the architect, or whether it had been caused by some  catastrophe; but my curiosity was always held in check by a strange  feeling that my relatives would not like to be approached on the  subject. My aunts Amelia and Deborah belonged to that class of  people, unhappily rare, who possess a power of generating in others an  instinctive knowledge of \"dangerous ground\"--a power which enabled  them to avert, both from themselves and the might-be offender, many a  painful situation. To proceed--the nakedness of the walls of  Hennersley was veiled--who shall say it was not designedly veiled--by  a thick covering of clematis and ivy, and in the latter innumerable  specimens of the feathered tribe found a sure and safe retreat.    On entering the house, one stepped at once into a large hall. A  gallery ran round it, and from the"]]]
