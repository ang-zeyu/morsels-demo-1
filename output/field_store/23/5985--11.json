It is under the influence of alcohol that the young  man is almost sure to make his first visit to the house of  prostitution. If a girl lose her virtue, it takes place in a majority  of cases when she is under the influence of alcohol; but for this  influence lessening her control, she could not be seduced. _Hence one  of the requirements of continence is_ TOTAL ABSTINENCE.    Under the head of narcotics must be classed also tobacco, though  tobacco has several other effects than the narcotic one. It exerts  upon the mucous membranes an irritation and that is the reason why the  mucous glands of the mouth secrete so freely when one chews or smokes,  but the influence upon the nervous system is distinctly of a narcotic  character, and while tobacco is a mild narcotic, and while it can be  used by the adult moderately without serious results; this is certain,  that no man has ever been benefited by the use of tobacco. And while  many men have been injured, even by the moderate use, all men are  injured by the excessive use. Furthermore, boys and young men who have  not attained the full stature of their physical development are very  seriously injured and retarded in their development through even the  moderate use of tobacco. There is not an educator in America who will  not testify to the fact that the use of tobacco in any form by young  boys, retards both the physical and mental growth.    So tobacco certainly is another thing that is altogether proper to  leave alone, and its use at the very best cannot be defended on any  grounds other than that it is a sense gratification. And while it  must be admitted that it may serve as a sense gratification in the  case of the individual who participates in it, it must also be  remembered that tobacco smoke or the smell of tobacco is, in a very  high degree distasteful if not actually loathsome, to a large  proportion of society, and the young man who gratifies sense at the  expense of his neighbors, certainly is on the defensive.    In so far as tobacco is a narcotic, in just so far does it disarm and  put to sleep those aesthetic and moral impulses which are so helpful  in the maintenance of the continent life.    c. =The Dietetic Control of the Bowels.=--A most important hygienic  rule is to maintain a strict regularity of the bowels. By regularity  of the bowels we mean, a free, normal passage of the bowels at least  once in twenty-four hours. Two or three passages in twenty-four hours  are not too many.    A tendency towards constipation may be hereditary. The writer finds  that at least one case in four of persistent chronic constipation  among college men seems to be due to a hereditary tendency.    Those individuals who have from early infancy and throughout their  whole life suffered from a tendency to constipation and perhaps from  actual chronic constipation, find it exceedingly difficult to produce  normal regular daily movements of the bowels. Whether constipation is  chronic or occasional or whether it is hereditary or acquired, in any  case, it should be corrected if possible through modification of the  diet, and of daily habits.    First of all, one must remember in this connection that the lower  bowel or rectum is subject to education, and not by any means the  least important factor in overcoming a tendency to constipation, is  the regular morning visit to the water closet.    The author would discourage the habit which some have of \"straining at  stool.\" This act of straining at stool together with the pressure  which the hard fecal masses make on the blood vessels, increases the  blood pressure in the veins of the rectum to such a high degree that  it is likely to cause hemorrhoids or piles. But if the position  favorable to the passage of the bowels be taken regularly, every  morning, and a reasonable time spent in that position, and if the  daily passage is brought about at that time, the muscles of the rectum  will be educated to the point of contracting upon its contents at that  time and under those conditions regularly, and this will be a strong  factor towards regulating the movements of the bowels.    But the most important thing to consider in this condition is the  dietetic regulation of the bowels. There are some foods that tend to  constipate while others act as a laxative.    Such foods for example, as contain a considerable portion of tannin,  are always constipating. Strong teas have a constipating effect,  particularly such as the bitter English Breakfast teas, in which there  is a very large proportion of tannin. This large percentage of tannin  accounts for the prevalence of constipation among female tea drinkers.    Unripe fruits contain a high percentage of tannin which, in the  ripening processes of the fruit, becomes changed into cellulose and  sugar. Any fruit that quickly turns brown after a cut surface is  exposed to the air and that stains a steel-bladed knife black quickly  when the fruit is cut, possesses a high percentage of tannin, and is  not in a wholesome condition to eat. Unripe peaches and apples possess  this characteristic. These fruits should be eaten only when ripe.    If one's diet contains too small a percentage of cellulose or pulp  material, a tendency to constipation will be noticed. It has been  found from investigation of this subject that the cellulose or  undigested material of the cereals, vegetables and fruits, is an  absolute essential to good bowel action. The cellulose makes bulk in  the bowels and the simple presence of this bulk of undigested material  stimulates the muscular contractions.    If one were to choose for example, a diet of meat, eggs, nuts, corn  starch, tapioca, sugar, fats and oils, i.e., diets which will be  almost completely digested and absorbed, leaving a very small amount  of undigested material in the intestines, the bulk of the material in  the intestines would be so small that they would not be stimulated to  contract. Therefore this small bulk of material, together with certain  excretions from the liver and other organs, would be retained in the  bowel and undergo fermentation there. Injurious substances which  result from the fermentation would be absorbed, causing what is known  as autointoxication, complicated with constipation. If one, however,  mixes with the condensed foods named above a good proportion of  cereals, fruits and vegetables, all of which possess a considerable  percentage of undigestible material, the presence of this undigestible  material in the intestines leads to strong peristaltic movements,  causing the passage of this material along the intestinal tract to the  rectum, which will be periodically evacuated. In such cereal foods as  the coarser meals (like oatmeal, various wheat preparations and corn  meal), the proportion of bran substance serves as a local stimulation  to the intestinal activity. The little bran scales being  sharp-cornered and rough, serve as a local irritant or mechanical  stimulation.    What has just been said regarding the advisability of eating some  coarser cereals must not be taken to mean that white bread is not  wholesome. On the other hand, white bread made from the roller process  flour is in a high degree nutritious and wholesome, and may well make  an important part of any dietary.    It is not hygienic to eat white bread or biscuits hot out of the oven.  These hot breads tend to form doughy masses which are almost  completely impervious to the digestive juices, and while they are  eventually digested, it takes a very much longer time to do so than  would be the case with stale bread, which is so readily masticated  into a creamy consistency. If one is subjected to conditions where he  must either eat hot biscuits or perhaps embarrass a most hospitable  hostess, there is only one thing for him to do, i.e., to eat the  biscuits.    It is possible, though difficult, to masticate hot bread so perfectly  that it is reduced to a smooth, creamy consistency, and no one should  ever swallow any bread which has not been so masticated.    Among the fruits, figs, prunes and apples seem to have the most  clearly marked laxative effect, though all ripe fruits generally, and  especially those that are taken uncooked, have a moderate laxative  effect. Belonging to this class of foods is rhubarb which, though not  a fruit, is usually served as a fruit either stewed or in puddings or  pies. There is no doubt that it exerts its laxative effect better if  taken stewed rather than with pastry.    If one then who is annoyed by a tendency to constipation wishes to  correct it, a rational change of diet would be, _to eat freely of  cereals and coarse breads and of various fruits, particularly apples,  figs and prunes_.    The most effective way to use these laxative fruits is to eat freely  of them just before retiring. The apples and figs may be eaten just as  they are received from the market. Prunes may be soaked in cold water  for twenty-four hours, then taken directly from the cold water and  eaten.    If this is not effective a supplementary regime may be adopted that is  only in part dietetic, i.e., _to rise_ ONE HOUR BEFORE BREAKFAST,  _drink two glasses of cold water and take a brisk walk of fifteen to  thirty minutes_. The cold water has a tonic effect upon the stomach,  preparing it for a rapid digestion of the breakfast. It also washes  out the accumulation of mucus in the stomach, which may easily equal a  pint in volume. This pint of mucous plus the pint of water, making a  quart of liquid altogether, pours through the pylorus, and during the  rapid walk, works its way rapidly down through the alimentary tract,  washing the whole tract and preparing it to receive and rapidly to  digest the next meal. This slimy water, having washed out the stomach  and small intestine, then passes into the large"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24717"],[0,"Danger! A True History of a Great City's Wiles and Temptations (#13)"],[1,"slit in the dress from view. She now takes her muff, which, to the  uninitiated eye, has nothing to distinguish it, outwardly, from  thousands of other muffs, but which is a master-piece of ingenious  contrivance. It is covered with any kind of fur, just as honest muffs  are, with the significant exception that, instead of being padded with  cotton, the fur rests upon a framework of wire. Between the fur covering  and the wire supporting frame, the space usually filled with cotton is  left vacant, thus providing accommodation for quite a stock of valuable  lace, articles of jewelry, gloves, or anything small and valuable. In  the bottom of the muff there is a small slide, on the inside, worked by  the hand of the wearer, who, after introducing the stolen article into  the muff, presses back this slide and drops the plunder into the cavity  between the frame and the fur.    With one of these muffs, shop-lifting is so easy as to be successfully  practiced by novices, as not one store-walker in a thousand would  suspect that his counters could be worked through a muff worn as these  are when in action. Thus equipped, the expert female shop-lifter sallies  out. Generally, she dresses rather expensively. Sometimes she uses a  carriage, but more frequently walks, stopping to gaze in the store  windows as she saunters along; and in no particular can she be  distinguished from others of her sex, except, perhaps, that in some  cases she is rather more richly and attractively clothed. Upon  selecting a store that suits her, she walks boldly in, going at once,  and without noticeable hesitation, to the lace or other department,  before the counter of which she seats herself, adroitly arranging her  dress and the slit. Asking the saleswoman to be shown some kinds of  lace, she examines it critically, and, laying it down upon the counter,  asks to see another kind, or some feathers, or something else, and so  contrives to have several articles just before her, one covering the  other, if possible. Having accumulated a number of articles upon the  counter in an eligible position, she points to some things high up on a  shelf behind the counter, thus getting the saleswoman's back turned  towards her for an instant, when, with soft dexterity, she conveys  anything that happens to be handily in the way through the slit in her  dress into the bag between her legs. The goods examined and priced, \"not  suiting\" her, and other customers coming up, she takes the opportunity  of moving to another counter, where the same tactics are repeated, and  so on, till she is satisfied with her haul or exhausted her stowage  capacity.    The muff is worked in this way: The operator rests her hand, with the  muff on it, on the goods which she proposes to sample, and a moment of  diverted attention on the part of the salesman or saleswoman is ample  for her to transfer to her ingenious warehouse such samples as she can  conveniently and quickly pick up with one hand. The movement of  concealing the stolen articles is instantaneously executed, and, however  well the muff may be stuffed, it cannot be bulged out to attract  attention. It is surprising to know the vast quantities of material  these bags and muffs will contain. At police headquarters, once, in  examining the contents of one of these bags, it was found to actually  hold a piece of satin, several cards of lace, a camel's-hair shawl, two  large china ornaments, a number of spools of silk, several elegant fans,  expensive ostrich plumes, and numberless smaller articles, feathers,  artificial flowers and some minor trinkets. Shop-lifters are the terror  of the shop-keepers, for the thefts embrace everything of convenient  character lying about. With one dexterous sweep they will frequently put  out of sight a dozen small articles.    All the articles stolen are carried home, the trade-marks upon them  destroyed, and then subsequently sold to some \"fence\" for about  one-third their value, to finally be resold again over the counter of  some other store in another city. It is seldom the female shop-lifter  uses a male confederate, but it frequently happens that they travel in  couples, one engaging the attention of the seller while the other fills  her bag or muff, taking turn about until both have stolen sufficient for  the day. Sometimes several trips are made to the same store, but  generally one is enough.    It often happens that store-keepers make mistakes and wrongfully accuse  respectable ladies of shop-lifting, and in such cases the over-zealous  vender suffers greatly, both in loss of custom and, oftentimes, in heavy  damages in a court of law. All stores are provided with what are called  examination rooms. When a person is suspected of being a thief, some of  the attaches of the store, or a detective, as the case may be, taps the  person lightly upon the shoulder, and politely invites them into this  examination room. Here their bundles and packages are searched and, if  warranted, their clothing is personally inspected by some female  attendant. Here is where some very curious scenes are enacted. The  professional thief will resort to tears, expostulations, explanations,  excuses of all kinds, finally begging to be allowed to depart. The  discovery of the bag or the muff, however, invariably settles the case  and the offender is marched off to jail.    In the case of a mistake, as stated, the store-keeper generally makes  the explanations, excuses, and so forth, supplementing them afterwards  by payment in a suit for damages.    Men shop-lifters--or, more properly, store thieves--pursue an entirely  different method, and confine their operations to a far different kind  of store. They go into the thieving business to make it pay, and are not  tempted by the display of merely pretty things. They prefer to operate  in the wholesale stores, and how ingeniously and systematically they  accomplish their object, under the very eyes of people, borders on the  marvelous.    It has often been said that the same amount of ingenuity, thought, care  and planning, which is bestowed by criminals upon the perpetration of  felony, if directed properly upon some legitimate business would render  them successful and rich. Undoubtedly, this is true. What inventive  faculties they must have to devise such a convenient contrivance as the  shop-lifter's muff, the various burglar's implements, the safe-robber's  tools, their delicate files, saws, etc., made from the best of steel,  and thousands of other things used in various ways, including the store  thief's satchel, must be manifest to the most ordinary comprehension.    As this latter article is used by the class of thief about to be spoken  of, a short description of it will not be amiss. To all outward  appearance it is a very unpretentious traveling-bag. It looks honest,  and does not differ, apparently, from any other bag of its kind. A  careful scrutiny hardly discloses any variation from the ordinary  valise; but, nevertheless, it has a false side, so ingeniously arranged  as to open and close noiselessly, being caught with a well-oiled spring  or fastening. The hinges of this false side are made on the iron which,  in ordinary satchels, contains the lock, and it opens upwards, when  placed in the usual manner upon a table, instead of downwards--just the  reverse of the honest one. It is the simplest thing in the world, then,  for an expert, carrying a valise of this description by the handle, to  place it over a piece of valuable cloth, open the slide, which works  with a spring; at the precise moment slip the goods in, and, taking his  valise by the handle, walk off undiscovered. To any one who may be  watching, the action of the thief is the most natural one in the world,  and if the goods themselves are not missed no one would ever suspect  they were in the valise carried by the gentleman who merely let it rest  for a second on the table. But it is captured all the same, although you  cannot see it. It has changed from one place to the other under the  magical \"presto\" of the thief.    The store thief saunters down-town to the dry goods district, watches  the wholesale houses, notes the interior of the stores, and carefully  makes his selection of some one suitable to his purpose. The next  morning, bright and early, he attires himself like a country  store-keeper, and, taking his satchel in his hand, he makes haste to  reach the store he intends to work, appearing to the quietly-observant  porter like an out-of-town buyer, just come off some early incoming  train. Asking the porter or clerk, who, probably, about this time, is  sweeping out, in expectation of the arrival of some of the salesmen or  proprietors, if Mr. Smith, a salesman, is in, he is informed that none  of the clerks or salesmen are down yet. Remarking in answer that he will  wait a moment or two, as he has just arrived from Schenectady, he deftly  places his gripsack upon the counter, over some valuable piece of goods,  and saunters around the store, coming back to where his valise is, when,  embracing a favorable opportunity, he slips the one, two or three pieces  of cloth through the false portion of the valise, and, taking it by the  handle in the usual careless manner, \"guesses he will go to his hotel  and have a wash and return later,\" and leaves the store not only  undetected but entirely unsuspected. Very probably the theft remains  undiscovered until the next taking of stock, when it is impossible to  tell how the goods were lost, and in many cases some attache of the  store is discharged, never knowing for what sin of omission or  commission he was suspected. The success of this mode of theft is best  shown by the infrequency with which such cases are ever brought to light  or its perpetrator ever caught and arrested.        CHAPTER VII.
