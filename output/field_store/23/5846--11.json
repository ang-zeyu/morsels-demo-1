Because an animal is castrated, it surely will not  be claimed that therefore it is diseased. In man and in the higher  animals the power of reproduction ceases at certain ages, but it cannot  therefore be said that such men or animals are diseased. Neither is a  redundancy of parts an unequivocal evidence of disease.    Topknot fowls and ducks are as healthy as those which do not have such  appendages, and a Shetland pony is as healthy as a Percheron horse,  notwithstanding the difference in their size and weight. Again, color in  block or in variegation is not positive evidence of disease in animal  life. The white Caucasian is as healthy as the negro, the copper-colored  Malay as the red Indian. The horse, ox, and hog run through white and  red to black both in solid and party-color, and all are equally healthy;  so with the rabbit, dog, cat, and others of our domestic animals. In  wild animals, birds, reptiles, fishes, and insects, it is the same, so  that mere difference in color or combinations of color are not _prima  facie_ evidence of disease.    But some will say this may be true of animal life, but not of plant  life. That there is a strong and evident analogy, the one with the  other, is now universally admitted by physiologists. Formerly many  physiologists considered leaf variegation a disease, because it  generally ran in stripes lengthwise of the leaf or in spots. In the  former case it was supposed to originate from disease in the leaf cells  of the leaf stalk, which, as the cells grow longitudinally, naturally  prolonged it to the end of the leaf. But the originating of varieties in  which the variegation did not assume this form, with other  considerations, has done much to upset this theory. In the variegated  leaved snowberry we have the center and border of the leaf green,  separated the one from the other by an isolated white or yellow zone. In  the zebra-leaved eulalia and the zebra-leaved juncus, from Japan, we  have the variegation of the leaf transversely instead of longitudinally,  so that according to the old theory we have the anomaly of a healthy  portion of the leaf producing an unhealthy portion, and that again a  healthy one, and thus alternately along the whole length of the leaf.    When we dissect a leaf in its primal development, we find that its cells  contain colorless globules, by botanists called chlorophyl or  phyto-color; these undergo changes according as they are acted upon by  light, oxygen, or other agents, producing green, yellow, red, and other  tints. This chlorophyl only exists in the outer or superficial cells of  the parenchyma or cellular tissue of the leaf, and thus differs from  starch and other substances produced in the internal cells, from which  the light is more or less excluded. It is a fatty or wax-like substance,  readily dissolved in alcohol or ether. The primal color of all leaves  and flowers is white or a pale yellowish hue, as can readily be seen by  cutting open a leaf or flower bud. The seed leaves of the French bean  are white when they come out of the earth, but they become green an hour  afterward under the influence of bright sunshine. A case is on record  where in a certain section, some miles in extent, in this country, about  the time of the trees coming into leaf, the sun did not shine for twenty  days; the leaves developed to nearly their full size, but were of a pale  or whitish color; finally, one forenoon the sun shone out fully, and by  the middle of the afternoon the trees were in full summer dress. These  facts show that the green color of leaves is due to the action of light.  Variegation is sometimes produced independently of the chlorophyl, as in  _Begonia argyrostigma_ and _Carduus marianus_, in which it is produced  by a layer of air interposed between the epidermis or outer skin of the  leaf and the cells beneath; this gives the leaf a bright, silvery  appearance.    To what, then, are we to ascribe leaf variegation? I think that it is  entirely due to diminished root power; by this I do not mean that the  roots are diseased, but that they are either in an aberrant or abnormal  state; but disease cannot be predicated upon either of these states. To  explain: everybody knows _Spirea callosa_ to be a strong growing shrub,  having umbels of rosy-colored flowers and strong, stout roots; the white  flowered variety is quite dwarf, is more leafy and bushy than the  species, and has more fibrous and delicate roots than the type; the  crisp-leaved variety is still more dwarf, very bushy, and very leafy,  and has very fine threadlike roots. This would indicate that the  aberrance is in the roots; the two varieties are much more leafy in  proportion to their size than the species, so that if the leaves  controlled the roots, the latter should have been larger in proportion  than those of the species. Again, once when, in the autumn, I was  preparing my greenhouse plants for their winter quarters, I cut back a  \"Lady Plymouth\" geranium, which chanced to be set away in a cool and  somewhat damp cellar. When discovered the following February and started  into growth in the greenhouse it produced nothing but solid green  leaves, and never afterward produced a variegated leaf. This I  attributed to its having gained greater root power during its long  season of rest. By this I mean that the roots had grown and greatly  increased in size, although there had not been any leaf growth. That  roots under certain circumstances do so is well known. The roots of fir  trees have been found alive and growing forty five years after the  trunks were felled. The same has occurred in an ash tree after its trunk  had been sawn off level with the ground. A root of _Ipomea sellowii_ has  been known to keep on growing for twelve years after its top had been  destroyed by frost; and in all that time it never made buds or leaves,  yet it increased to seven times its original weight. The tuberous roots  of some of the _Tropoeolums_ will continue to grow and increase in  size after the tops have been accidentally broken off; and potatoes  buried so deep in the earth that they cannot produce tops will produce a  crop of new potatoes.    On the other hand, I have had an oak-leaved geranium overlooked in a  corner of the greenhouse until it was almost dried up for lack of water.  When its branches were pruned back and it was started into growth only  one branch showed the almost black center of the leaf, all the rest were  clear green. This was an evident case of diminished root power, but the  plant grew as thriftily as ever. The lack of the dark marking in the  leaves was equivalent to the variegation in other varieties, only in a  reverse direction.    In practice, when gardeners wish to produce an abnormal condition in a  tree or plant, they will, if they wish to dwarf it, graft it on a  species or variety of diminished root power, and contrariwise, if they  wish to increase its growth, will graft it upon a stock of strong root  power. But in neither case can the graft be said to be diseased by the  action of the roots of the stock.    When this root power is so far diminished as to produce complete  albinism, the shoots from such roots appear to partake of this  diminished power, and to lose the power of making roots, and thus become  very difficult to propagate. It is sometimes said that albino cuttings  cannot be rooted at all, but this is a mistake, for I have succeeded in  striking such cuttings from the variegated leaved _Hydrangea_. It  required much care to do it; they did not, however, retain their albino  character after they rooted and started into growth.    Albinism and white variegation in leaves appear to be due to the  chlorophyl in such leaves being able to resist the action of the three  (red, yellow, and blue) rays of light. What we call color in any  substance or thing is due to its reflecting these different rays in  various proportions of combination and absorbing the rest of them, the  various proportions giving the various shades of color. White is due to  the reflection of all of them, and black to the absorption of them. In  some plants with variegated foliage we have the curious fact that the  cells containing chlorophyl reflecting one color produce cells which  reflect an entirely different color. In the coleus \"Lady Burrill,\" for  instance, the lower half of the leaf is of a deep violet-crimson color,  and the upper half is golden yellow. In other varieties of coleus, in  _Perilla nankiensis_, and other plants, we have foliage without a  particle of green in it, and yet they are perfectly healthy. This shows  that green leaves are not absolutely necessary to the health of a plant.    As a proof of leaf variegation being a disease, the speaker alluded to  cited a case in which a green leaved abutilon, upon which a variegated  leaved variety had been grafted, threw out a variegated leaved shoot  below the graft. This can easily be explained. The growth of the trunk  or stem of all exogenous plants, or those which increase in size on the  outside of the stem, is brought about by the descent of certain  formative tissue called cambium, elaborated by the leaves and descending  between the old wood and the bark, where it is formed into alburnum or  woody matter. Some think that it is also formed by the roots and ascends  from them as well as descending from the leaves. Be this as it may,  there is no doubt about its descent. In such comparatively soft-wooded,  free growing plants as the abutilon the descent of the cambium is very  free and in considerable quantity, so that the stock would soon be  inclosed in a layer of it descending from the graft. When being  converted into woody matter it also forms adventitious buds which under  certain favorable circumstances will emit shoots of the same character  as the graft from which it was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21091"],[0,"The Life of William Ewart Gladstone, Vol. 1 (of 3) (#13)"],[1,"Peel. When Lord Liverpool offered him the  Greek professorship, with profuse compliments on his erudition, the  learned man replied, 'My Lord, I have received your letter, and accede  to the contents.--Yours, T. G.' And to the complaining parent of an  undergraduate he wrote, 'Dear Sir,--Such letters as yours are a great  annoyance to your obedient servant T. Gaisford.'[34] This laconic gift  the dean evidently had not time to transmit to all of his flock.    Christ Church in those days was infested with some rowdyism, and in one  bear-fight an undergraduate was actually killed. In the chapel the new  undergraduate found little satisfaction, for the service was scarcely  performed with common decency. There seems, however, to have been no  irreconcilable prejudice against reading, and in the schools the college  was at the top of its academic fame. The influence of Cyril Jackson, the  dean in Peel's time, whose advice to Peel and, other pupils to work like  a tiger, and not to be afraid of killing one's self by work, was still  operative.[35] At the summer examination of 1830, Christ Church won five  first classes out of ten. Most commoners, according to a letter of  Gaskell's, had from three hundred and fifty to five hundred pounds a  year; but gentlemen commoners like Acland and Gaskell had from five to  six hundred. At the end of 1829, Mr. Gladstone received a studentship  _honoris causa_, by nomination of the dean--a system that would not be  approved in our epoch of competitive examination, but still an advance  upon the time-honoured practice of deans and canons disposing of  studentships on grounds of private partiality without reference to  desert. We may assume that the dean was not indifferent to academic  promise when he told Gladstone, very good-naturedly and civilly, that he  had determined to offer him his nomination. The student designate wrote  a theme, read it out before the chapter, passed a nominal, or even  farcical, examination in Homer and Virgil, was elected as matter of  course by the chapter, and after chapel on the morning of Christmas eve,  having taken several oaths, was formally admitted in the name of the  Holy Trinity.    Mr. Biscoe, his classical tutor, was a successful lecturer on Aristotle,  especially on the Rhetoric. With Charles Wordsworth, son of the master  of Trinity at Cambridge, and afterwards Bishop of Saint Andrews, he read  for scholarship, apparently not wholly to his own satisfaction. While  still an undergraduate, he writes to his father (Nov. 2, 1830), 'I am  wretchedly deficient in the knowledge of modern languages, literature,  and history; and the classical knowledge acquired here, though sound,  accurate, and useful, yet is not such as to _complete_ an education.' It  looked, in truth, as if the caustic saying of a brilliant colleague of  his in later years were not at the time unjust, as now it would happily  be, that it was a battle between Eton and education, and Eton had won.    Mr. Gladstone never to the end of his days ceased to be grateful that  Oxford was chosen for his university. At Cambridge, as he said in  discussing Hallam's choice, the pure refinements of scholarship were  more in fashion than the study of the great masterpieces of antiquity in  their substance and spirit. The classical examination at Oxford, on the  other hand, was divided into the three elastic departments of  scholarship and poetry, history, and philosophy. In this list, history  somewhat outweighed the scholarship, and philosophy was somewhat more  regarded than history. In each case the examination turned more on  contents than on form, and the influence of Butler was at its climax.                        CHARACTER OF OXFORD TEACHING    If Mr. Gladstone had gone to Oxford ten years earlier, he would have  found the Ethics and the Rhetoric treated, only much less effectively,  in the Cambridge method, like dramatists and orators, as pieces of  literature. As it was, Whately's common sense had set a new fashion, and  Aristotle was studied as the master of those who know how to teach us  the right way about the real world.[36] Aristotle, Butler, and logic  were the new acquisitions, but in none of the three as yet did the  teaching go deep compared with modern standards. Oxford scholars of our  own day question whether there was even one single tutor in 1830, with  the possible exception of Hampden, who could expound Aristotle as a  whole--so utterly had the Oxford tradition perished.[37]    The time was in truth the eve of an epoch of illumination, and in these  epochs it is not old academic systems that the new light is wont to  strike with its first rays. The summer of 1831 is the date of Sir  William Hamilton's memorable exposure,[38] in his most trenchant and  terrifying style and with a learning all his own, of the corruption and  'vampire oppression of Oxford'; its sacrifice of the public interests to  private advantage; its unhallowed disregard of every moral and religious  bond; the systematic perjury so naturalised in a great seminary of  religious education; the apathy with which the injustice was tolerated  by the state and the impiety tolerated by the church. Copleston made a  wretched reply, but more than twenty years passed before the spirit of  reform overthrew the entrenchments of academic abuse. In that overthrow,  when the time came, Mr. Gladstone was called to play a part, though  hardly at first a very zealous one. This was not for a quarter of a  century; for, as we shall soon see, both the revival of learning and the  reform of institutions at Oxford were sharply turned aside from their  expected course by the startling theological movement that now proceeded  from her venerable walls.    What interests us here is not the system but the man; and never was  vital temperament more admirably fitted by its vigour, sincerity,  conscience, compass, for whatever good seed from the hand of any sower  might be cast upon it. In an entry in his diary in the usual strain of  evangelical devotion (April 25, 1830) is a sentence that reveals what  was in Mr. Gladstone the nourishing principle of growth: 'In practice  the great end is that the love of God may become the _habit_ of my soul,  and particularly these things are to be sought;--1. The spirit of love.  2. Of self-sacrifice. 3. Of purity. 4. Of energy.' Just as truly as if  we were recalling some hero of the seventeenth or any earlier century,  is this the biographic clue.    Gladstone constantly reproaches himself for natural indolence, and for a  year and a half he took his college course pretty easily. Then he  changed. 'The time for half-measures and trifling and pottering, in  which I have so long indulged myself, is now gone by, and I must do or  die.' His really hard work did not begin until the summer of 1830, when  he returned to Cuddesdon to read mathematics with Saunders, a man who  had the reputation of being singularly able and stimulating to his  pupils, and with whom he had done some rudiments before going into  residence at Christ Church. In his description of this gentleman to his  father, we may hear for the first time the redundant roll that was for  many long years to be so familiar and so famous. Saunders' disposition,  it appears, 'is one certainly of extreme benevolence, and of a  benevolence which is by no means less strong and full when purely  gratuitous and spontaneous, than when he seems to be under the tie of  some definite and positive obligation.' Dr. Gaisford would perhaps have  put it that the tutor was no kinder where his kindness was paid for,  than where it was not.                           CATHOLIC EMANCIPATION    The catholic question, that was helping many another and older thing to  divide England from Ireland, after having for a whole generation played  havoc with the fortunes of party and the careers of statesmen, was now  drawing swiftly to its close. The Christ Church student had a glimpse of  one of the opening scenes of the last act. He writes to his brother  (Feb. 6th, 1829):--         I saw yesterday a most interesting scene in the Convocation house.       The occasion was the debate on the anti-catholic petition, which it       has long been the practice of the university to send up year by       year. This time it was worded in the most gentle and moderate terms       possible. All the ordinary business there, is transacted in Latin;       I mean such things as putting the question, speaking, etc., and       this rule, I assure you, stops many a mouth, and I dare say saves       the Roman catholics many a hard word. There were rather above two       hundred doctors and masters of arts present. Three speeches were       made, two against and one in favour of sending up the petition.       Instead of aye and no they had _placet_ and _non-placet_, and in       place of a member dividing the House, the question was, \"_Petitne       aliquis scrutinium?_\" which was answered by \"_Peto!_\" \"_Peto!_\"       from many quarters. However, when the scrutiny took place, it was       found that the petition was carried by 156 to 48.... After the       division, however, came the most interesting part of the whole. A       letter from Peel, resigning the seat for the university, was read       before the assembly. It was addressed to the vice-chancellor and       had arrived just before, it was understood; and I suppose brought       hither the first positive and indubitable announcement of the       government's intention to emancipate the catholics.    A few days later, Peel accepted the Chiltern Hundreds, and after some  deliberation allowed himself to be again brought forward for  re-election. He was beaten by 755 votes to 609. The relics of the  contest, the figures and the inscriptions on the walls, soon  disappeared, but panic did not abate. On Gladstone's way to Oxford  (April 30, 1829), a farmer's wife got into the coach, and in  communicative vein informed him how"]]]
