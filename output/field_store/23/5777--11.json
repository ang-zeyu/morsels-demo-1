Together with these religious  writings works of fiction, also of Oriental origin, made their appearance,  such as the life of Alexander the Great, the story of Troy, the tales of  _Stephanit and Ichnilat_ and _Barlaam and Josaphat_, the latter founded on  the biography of Buddha. These were for the most part reproductions or  variations of the fantastical romances which circulated through Europe in  the middle ages, and many of them have left traces in the national legends  and folk-songs. In the 13th century, under the Asen dynasty, numerous  historical works or chronicles (_letopisi_) were composed. State records  appear to have existed, but none of them have been preserved. With the  Ottoman conquest literature disappeared; the manuscripts became the food of  moths and worms, or fell a prey to the fanaticism of the Phanariot clergy.  The library of the patriarchs of Trnovo was committed to the flames by the  Greek metropolitan Hilarion in 1825.    The monk Paisii (born about 1720) and Bishop Sofronii (1739-1815) have  already been mentioned as the precursors of the literary [v.04 p.0786]  revival. The _Istoria Slaveno-Bolgarska_ (1762) of Paisii, written in the  solitude of Mount Athos, was a work of little historical value, but its  influence upon the Bulgarian race was immense. An ardent patriot, Paisii  recalls the glories of the Bulgarian tsars and saints, rebukes his  fellow-countrymen for allowing themselves to be called Greeks, and  denounces the arbitrary proceedings of the Phanariot prelates. The _Life  and Sufferings of sinful Sofronii_ (1804) describes in simple and touching  language the condition of Bulgaria at the beginning of the 19th century.  Both works were written in a modified form of the church Slavonic. The  first printed work in the vernacular appears to have been the  _Kyriakodromion_, a translation of sermons, also by Sofronii, published in  1806. The Servian and Greek insurrections quickened the patriotic  sentiments of the Bulgarian refugees and merchants in Rumania, Bessarabia  and southern Russia, and Bucharest became the centre of their political and  literary activity. A modest _bukvar_, or primer, published at Kronstadt by  Berovitch in 1824, was the first product of the new movement. Translations  of the Gospels, school reading-books, short histories and various  elementary treatises now appeared. With the multiplication of books came  the movement for establishing Bulgarian schools, in which the monk Neophyt  Rilski (1793-1881) played a leading part. He was the author of the first  Bulgarian grammar (1835) and other educational works, and translated the  New Testament into the modern language. Among the writers of the literary  renaissance were George Rakovski (1818-1867), a fantastic writer of the  patriotic type, whose works did much to stimulate the national zeal, Liuben  Karaveloff (1837-1879), journalist and novelist, Christo Boteff  (1847-1876), lyric poet, whose ode on the death of his friend Haji Dimitr,  an insurgent leader, is one of the best in the language, and Petko  Slaveikoff (died 1895), whose poems, patriotic, satirical and erotic,  moulded the modern poetical language and exercised a great influence over  the people. Gavril Krstovitch, formerly governor-general of eastern  Rumelia, and Marin Drinoff, a Slavist of high repute, have written  historical works. Stamboloff, the statesman, was the author of  revolutionary and satirical ballads; his friend Zacharia Stoyanoff (d.  1889), who began life as a shepherd, has left some interesting memoirs. The  most distinguished Bulgarian man of letters is Ivan Vazoff (b. 1850), whose  epic and lyric poems and prose works form the best specimens of the modern  literary language. His novel _Pod Igoto_ (Under the Yoke) has been  translated into several European languages. The best dramatic work is  _Ivanko_, a historical play by Archbishop Clement, who also wrote some  novels. With the exception of Zlatarski's and Boncheff's geological  treatises and contributions by Georgieff, Petkoff, Tosheff and Urumoff to  Velnovski's _Flora Bulgarica_, no original works on natural science have as  yet been produced; a like dearth is apparent in the fields of philosophy,  criticism and fine art, but it must be remembered that the literature is  still in its infancy. The ancient folk-songs have been preserved in several  valuable collections; though inferior to the Servian in poetic merit, they  deserve scientific attention. Several periodicals and reviews have been  founded in modern times. Of these the most important are the  _Perioditchesko Spisanie_, issued since 1869 by the Bulgarian Literary  Society, and the _Sbornik_, a literary and scientific miscellany, formerly  edited by Dr Shishmanoff, latterly by the Literary Society, and published  by the government at irregular intervals.

BULGARIA, EASTERN, formerly a powerful kingdom which existed from the 5th  to the 15th century on the middle Volga, in the present territory of the  provinces of Samara, Simbirsk, Saratov and N. Astrakhan, perhaps extending  also into Perm. The village Bolgari near Kanzan, surrounded by numerous  graves in which most interesting archaeological finds have been made,  occupies the site of one of the cities--perhaps the capital--of that  extinct kingdom. The history, _Tarikh Bulgar_, said to have been written in  the 12th century by an Arabian cadi of the city Bolgari, has not yet been  discovered; but the Arabian historians, Ibn Foslan, Ibn Haukal, Abul Hamid  Andalusi, Abu Abdallah Harnati, and several others, who had visited the  kingdom, beginning with the 10th century, have left descriptions of it. The  Bulgars of the Volga were of Turkish origin, but may have assimilated  Finnish and, later, Slavonian elements. In the 5th century they attacked  the Russians in the Black Sea prairies, and afterwards made raids upon the  Greeks. In 922, when they were converted to Islam, Ibn Foslan found them  not quite nomadic, and already having some permanent settlements and houses  in wood. Stone houses were built soon after that by Arabian architects. Ibn  Dasta found amongst them agriculture besides cattle breeding. Trade with  Persia and India, as also with the Khazars and the Russians, and  undoubtedly with Biarmia (Urals), was, however, their chief occupation,  their main riches being furs, leather, wool, nuts, wax and so on. After  their conversion to Islam they began building forts, several of which are  mentioned in Russian annals. Their chief town, Bolgari or Velikij Gorod  (Great Town) of the Russian annals, was often raided by the Russians. In  the 13th century it was conquered by the Mongols, and became for a time the  seat of the khans of the Golden Horde. In the second half of the 15th  century Bolgari became part of the Kazan kingdom, lost its commercial and  political importance, and was annexed to Russia after the fall of Kazan.    (P. A. K.)

They are jarring  in the extreme, and are produced in the most leisurely manner, growing  louder and louder and finally ending with a slow quaver. At other times,  they grunt like small pigs. Hudson says that any quick noise, like the  report of a gun, produces a most startling effect among these little  animals. As soon as the report is broken on the stillness of the night a  perfect furore of cries issues forth from every direction. In a few  seconds it ceases for a momentary lull, and then suddenly breaks forth  again, louder than before. The tones of the different ones are so  different that the cries of nearby individuals may be plainly  distinguished amidst the babel of voices coming from the distance. It  sounds as if thousands upon thousands of them were striving to express  every emotion with their tiny tenor voices. No words can describe the  effect that these sounds produce. One of the most peculiar calls is the  special alarm-note, which is sharp, sudden, and shrill. It is reported  from one to another until every vizcacha is safe in his burrow.    But with all the kind and sociable qualities of these little animals,  they have characteristics which seem rather paradoxical, and chief among  these is their resentment of any intrusion of neighbours into their  burrows. Although a number of individuals may reside in adjoining  compartments in the same burrow, yet if one enters a burrow not his  own--woe is he! Even when pursued by fierce dogs a vizcacha will rarely  enter a room of another. If he does, he is immediately pounced upon by  the angry owner, and is usually driven clear out of the burrow. These  animals are undoubtedly far the most versatile and intelligent rodents  in the world.    A most unusual miner and underground dweller is the pocket gopher of  North and Central America. He is a rat-like animal, and is most  plentiful on the plains of the Mississippi region. He is unusual in  appearance, dressed in brown and grey fur, with tiny white feet, small  eyes and ears, and a short stubby tail. His feet are wonderfully strong,  and his fore-paws are armed with strong, curved claws. But he is famed  for his wonderful fur-lined pouches which open inside his cheeks and  serve a peculiar use.    His entire life, with rare exceptions, is spent underground. There he  makes long tunnels for the purpose of securing tender roots for food;  these tunnels are about twelve to eighteen inches below the surface, and  usually wind under the foot of a tree where a sinking passage goes down  four to five feet further and leads to a large living-room. This is the  family nest and nursery, lined with grass and soft fur which Mrs. Gopher  has taken from her own body. Adjoining the living-room is a storage bin  filled with nuts, dried bits of roots, tobacco, and potatoes.    Much that is exaggerated has been said in regard to the adaptability of  the gopher for his work. But it is a fact that he is of all the diggers  best suited for his task. He uses his strong teeth, like a trench-digger  uses a pick, to loosen the earth; and while his fore-feet are kept  constantly at work in digging and pressing the dirt back under the body,  the hind feet also aid in shovelling it still farther back. When a  sufficient amount has heaped up behind him, he performs the strangest of  all his feats--he turns around, and places his hands vertically against  his chin, thus forcing himself backwards, pushing the dirt ahead of  himself until it is forced out of the tunnel. At the outer end of the  tunnel is formed a little hillock.    Dr. Merriam has made a special study of the gopher, and in speaking of  the strange habit of running backwards, he says that even in carrying  food to one of his barns or storehouses the gopher rarely turns round  but usually runs backwards and forwards, over and over again like a  shuttle on its track.    The gopher uses his pouches for carrying food, not dirt. When he has  eaten a sufficient amount of food, he fills his pouches. If a potato is  too large to be carried in this way, he trims it off to the right size.  His method of emptying his pouches is most interesting; with his two  tiny paws he delicately presses the food from his cheeks.    The woodchuck is an American basement-dweller of considerable renown.  His peculiar whistling cry has won for him from the French the name of  _siffleur_; and we sometimes call him by the very inappropriate name of  ground-hog. He is a skilled weather prophet, and his appearance in the  early spring signifies that the winter is over. He never shows himself  until the cold is gone.    The home of the woodchuck is usually found under a hill, with a  sheltering rock to protect the entrance, which leads into a tunnel, from  twenty to thirty feet in length, finally ending by entering his home  proper. The tunnel descends obliquely for several feet, and again rises  towards the surface. His nest is rather large, and nicely lined with dry  grass and leaves, which serve as a carpet for the young woodchucks when  they come into the world. The young remain in the underground home until  they are about five months old, then they go out into the world for  themselves.    The ground squirrel long ago decided that he would rather have a  dwelling under the ground than in the tree-tops, for in an underground  home he would have more protection, a better place for storing food,  and a far safer nursery for rearing his precious babes. So snug, cosy  and hidden are the tiny quarters to which his runs or subways lead that  his family is quite safe against most enemies. The ingenuity and skill  shown in the construction of his home entitles him to rank among the  leading animal miners and excavators.    The most unusual of all the underground and basement dwellers is the  polar bear. This wise inhabitant of the Far North has long ago learned  that no animal needs to freeze to death in the snow. To him the snow is  a constant means of warmth and protection, and as winter approaches, he  seeks a position, usually near a big rock, where he digs out a hole of  small dimensions, and allows the snow to cover his body. Strangely  enough it is only the female bear that seeks this permanent snow hut;  the males do not care to spend so much time in seclusion. The same is  true of the unmated females. But the mated females always have snow huts  in which they give birth to their young, and where they reside until  early spring; then the mother bear comes forth with them to seek food  and teach them the ways of the world.    [Illustration: _American Museum of Natural History, New York_    TO THE POLAR BEAR THE ICE AND SNOW OF THE FAR NORTH MEAN WARMTH AND  PROTECTION. THE MOTHER BEAR DIGS HERSELF INTO A SNOWBANK, WHERE SHE  LIVES QUITE COMFORTABLY THROUGHOUT THE WINTER.]    [Illustration: THE SHARP CLAWS OF THE GROUND SQUIRREL ARE EFFICACIOUS  TOOLS IN DIGGING HIS COSY UNDERGROUND BURROW.]    There is no danger that the bears will stifle for air under the snow,  because the warmth of their breath always keeps a small hole open at  the top of the snow-cell. This snow-house increases as time goes on, the  heat exhaled from their bodies gradually melting the snow. Often Mrs.  Bear's home is discovered by means of the tiny hole in the roof around  which is collected quantities of hoar frost.    Hibernation is one of the strangest phenomena of the animal world, and  bears, especially the white bear of the polar regions, the black bear of  North America, and the brown bear of Europe, agree in the curious habit  of semi-hibernation. In the late fall of the season, the bears begin to  eat heavily and soon become enormously fat, preparatory for the long  winter of semi-sleep.    During the winter, at least for three months, the polar bear takes no  food, but lives entirely upon the store of fat which her body had  accumulated before she went into retirement. The same is true of many  hibernating animals, but in case of the bears it is more remarkable  because the mother bear must not only support herself but nourish her  young for a long period without taking any food for herself.    Another good example of a ground-dweller is the aard vark of Southern  Africa. He is as curious as his name, and scoops out immense quantities  of earth to form his home. This dwelling might be termed a cave, as he  heaps up the earth in the shape of a mammoth artificial ant-hill; on  one side is the entrance, which is so skilfully formed that it looks far  more like the work of man than of an animal.    His name is Dutch and means earth-hog. It is applied to him because his  head looks somewhat like that of a pig. His claws are powerful and  enormous, and with them he is able to dig into the hardest soil, and to  destroy the giant ant-hills which are dotted over the plains of South  Africa, and which can withstand the weight of a dozen men.    This strange creature sleeps during the day, and comes forth at evening  to seek his food. The first thing he does is to burst a hole in the  stony side of an ant-hill, to the utter dismay of its tiny inhabitants.  As they run among the ruins of their fallen city, he throws out his  slimy tongue and catches them by the hundreds. In a short time only the  shell of a half-destroyed wall remains.    These once stately ant-homes metamorphosed into caves, form homes for  the jackals and large serpents of the plains. The Kaffirs of Africa use  them as vaults into which are thrown their dead. The aard vark  outrivals, with his great claws, the most skilled burrowing tools of  man. These animals are therefore rarely captured. It is not uncommon for  a horse to fall into their excavations and be killed.    Miners, excavators, and underground dwellers teach us the great lesson  that, while many of them sought the ground as a protection, and found  there many difficulties to overcome, they not only have won in the great  struggle of life but have so skilfully"]]]
